REEVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter my return from Newfoundland, in the year 1791, I was curious to\r\nlook back into what had been done, in former times, on the subject upon\r\nwhich I had myself been just employed. I accordingly looked over the\r\nNEWFOUNDLAND ENTRIES, and the NEWFOUNDLAND BUNDLES among the books which\r\nbelonged to the late board of trade; and I then pursued the subject\r\nthrough the REGISTERS of the present committee of council for trade and\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nI was very much struck with the matter and reflections furnished by\r\nthis research; and I wished that the useful information, which I had\r\nderived from this retrospect, might be seen by those, who had at that\r\ntime to consider the subject of Newfoundland. Hence arose the present\r\nHistory; and as the same subject is now before the House of Commons, I\r\nhave ventured to print it, and throw it among the other materials under\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nIf this public enquiry had not been instituted, the story here told would\r\nhave been confined to the circle for which it was originally intended.\r\n\r\n                                                                    J.

This will comprise the struggles\r\nand vicissitudes of two contending interests.—The _planters_ and\r\n_inhabitants_ on the one hand, who, being settled there, needed the\r\nprotection of a government and police, with the administration of\r\njustice: and the _adventurers_ and _merchants_ on the other; who,\r\noriginally carrying on the fishery from this country, and visiting that\r\nisland only for the season, needed no such protection for themselves, and\r\nhad various reasons for preventing its being afforded to the others.\r\n\r\nThis narrative will divide itself into four periods, or parts. The\r\n_first_ will close with the passing of stat. 10 & 11. Will. 3. c. 25.\r\nby which the adventurers and merchants were supposed to have obtained a\r\npreference, and advantage over the pretensions of the inhabitants, and\r\nplanters. The _second_ will end with the appointment of a civil governor,\r\nand of justices of the peace in 1729; by which some stop was put to the\r\ndisorder and anarchy that had long prevailed in the island, especially\r\nduring the winter seasons. This may be considered as an advantage gained\r\nby the inhabitants and planters. The _third_ closes with Stat. 15, Geo.\r\n3. c. 31. commonly called in the island _Sir Hugh Palliser’s act_, which\r\nwas intended for giving an advantage to the fishery carried on from\r\nthe mother country; but, as it obliges both merchants and planters to\r\npay their servants’ wages, it is equally abhorred by both parties; and\r\nboth parties have shewn great readiness to join in asserting, that the\r\nfishery has gradually decayed ever since the passing of this act. The\r\n_fourth_ comes down to the year 1791, when a court of civil jurisdiction\r\nwas established upon principles which, it was thought, would secure the\r\nimpartial administration of justice to the merchant and the planter, the\r\nrich, and the poor, the master, and the fisherman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PART I.\r\n\r\nFrom Queen Elizabeth to Stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3.]\r\n\r\n    _Different Charters granted—Rules and Regulations of the Star\r\n    Chamber—Of appointing a Governor—Additional Rules—Report\r\n    against a Governor—Sir John Berry’s Advice—Bye Boat-keepers,\r\n    what?—Question of a Colony argued—Stat. 10 & 11. Will. 3. c.\r\n    25._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Different Charters granted.]\r\n\r\nNewfoundland, like other new discovered lands in America, was endeavoured\r\nto be settled, and improved by means of charters granted from the crown;\r\nit being hoped that individuals would, in this manner, be tempted\r\nto pursue the public advantage, through the medium of their private\r\ninterest. Charters were granted at five different times. The first was\r\nin 1578 to _Sir Humphry Gilbert_, who had thereby full power given him\r\nto possess all lands in Newfoundland not in actual possession of any\r\nChristian prince. By virtue of this authority, he, in 1583, landed in\r\n_St. John’s Bay_, and we are told, that calling together both English and\r\nstrangers then fishing, he took possession of the country in the queen’s\r\nname, and erected the arms of England upon a pillar of wood, in testimony\r\nof her majesty’s sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ charter was granted in 1610 by _king James_, to the _Earl\r\nof Northampton_, _Sir Francis Bacon_, and several others, by the name of\r\n_the Treasurer and Company of_ ADVENTURERS _and_ PLANTERS _of the City of\r\nLondon and Bristol, for the Colony in Newfoundland_, with all the usual\r\nprerogatives and immunities; but in this grant there was a reserve to all\r\npersons of an entire liberty to fish.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ charter was granted to _Sir Geo. Calvert_ (the grantee of\r\nthe province of Maryland) and his heirs, of a tract of land called\r\n_the Province of Avalon_, lying to the south east point of the island,\r\nextending between ports _Fermose_ and _Aquafort_ to _Petty Harbor_, and\r\nfrom thence westward to the bay of _Placentia_. There was also a grant\r\nto him of the property of all islands lying within ten leagues of the\r\neastern shore, together with the fishing of all sorts of fish, saving to\r\nthe English the free liberty of fishing, salting, and drying of fish.\r\n\r\nThe _fourth_ charter was granted in 1628, to the _Marquis of Hamilton_,\r\nthe _Earl of Pembroke_, _Earl of Holland_, _Sir David Kirk_, and others;\r\nand under pretence that Lord Baltimore (the heir of Sir Geo. Calvert)\r\nand other proprietors, had deserted the plantation, this grant included\r\nthe province of _Avalon_. In this grant it was provided, that no person\r\nshould plant or inhabit within six miles of the sea shore between cape\r\n_Race_ and cape _Bonavista_.\r\n\r\nThus far did the crown go in the granting of four exclusive rights\r\nin Newfoundland. But this detail gives us no information as to the\r\nconstitution and regulation of the island, its trade and fishery. On\r\nthis head we find, that in 1615 Captain _Richard Whitburne_ was sent out\r\nwith a commission from the high court of admiralty, authorizing him to\r\nimpannel juries, and to make inquiry upon oath, of sundry abuses, and\r\ndisorders committed every year, among the fishermen upon that coast.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rules and regulations of the star-chamber.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1633, the star-chamber took up the subject of the fishery:—a\r\npetition and complaint had been there preferred by the merchants and\r\nowners of ships in the west of England: and that court, after taking the\r\nsame into consideration, was pleased to issue the following order, for\r\nbetter regulating the trade.\r\n\r\nIf a man killed another, or stole to the value of forty shillings, the\r\noffender was to be brought to England, and the matter was to be tried\r\nby the Earl Marshal; and if the fact was proved by two witnesses, the\r\noffender was to suffer death.—No ballast was to be thrown out of ships to\r\nthe prejudice of the harbours—no person was to deface or spoil any stage,\r\ncook-room, or other building—the ship that first entered the harbour was\r\nto be admiral—no person should deface or alter the marks of any boats, to\r\ndefraud the owners—no person was to steal any fish, train, or salt, or\r\nother provision, belonging to the fishing ships—no person was to set fire\r\nto the woods, or rind the trees, except for cook-rooms—none were to cast\r\nanchor so as to hinder the haling of seines—none should rob the nets\r\nof any drift boats—no tavern should be set up for the selling of wine,\r\nbeer, strong water, or tobacco—the company were to assemble themselves on\r\nSunday to hear divine service—the mayors of _Southampton_, _Weymouth_,\r\nand certain other towns, were to take cognizance of all complaints made\r\nagainst any offender upon land—the vice-admiral in the counties of\r\n_Southampton_, _Dorset_, _Devon_, and _Cornwall_, was to proceed against\r\noffenders at sea.—These laws were to be in force till they were annulled\r\nby his Majesty; and the admiral in every harbour of the island was to\r\nmake proclamation of them.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of February following, a charter, being the _fifth_, was\r\ngranted according to the tenor of this order, made by the star-chamber,\r\nto _the merchants and traders to Newfoundland_.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1650, the council of state gave a commission to _John\r\nTreworgay_, merchant, who was then in the island, _to order affairs there\r\nfor the best advantage of the state_; which commission was renewed in\r\n1653. A commission was also obtained in 1655 by Sir _David Kirk_ (who had\r\nbeen one of the grantees in the charter of 1628), together with _John\r\nClaypole_, _John Goffe_, and others; but it does not appear that any\r\nthing was done thereupon.\r\n\r\nAfter the restoration, _Lord Baltimore_, who had been dispossessed of the\r\nprovince of _Avalon_, by the charter granted to the Marquis of Hamilton\r\nand others, obtained orders in 1660, for a restitution of that province.\r\nAnd there was also on the 24th January 1660 a renewal and confirmation\r\nof the charter granted to the merchants and traders in February 1633; on\r\nwhich occasion this additional provision was made: “That no master or\r\nowner of any ship should transport any persons to Newfoundland who were\r\nnot of the ship’s company, or such as were to plant and settle there.”\r\n\r\nIn support of this last provision, a letter was written on the 4th\r\nDecember 1663 by the lords of the privy council, enjoining the\r\nmagistrates of the western ports to take care that no owners of ships,\r\ntrading to Newfoundland, suffered any persons to be transported thither,\r\nother than such as were of the ship’s company, and _the officers of his\r\nMajesty’s customs_ in the several ports therein named directed, and to\r\ncharge all masters of ships to observe this rule. In the 15th year of\r\nCharles II. the parliament made some regulation respecting this trade and\r\nfishery. By statute 15 Car. 2, c. 16, penalties are imposed on planters\r\nand others, who destroy the fry of fish, or burn or destroy boats left in\r\nthe harbour, or pull down houses or stages built by the English to live\r\nin during the fishing season; and no toll is to be demanded for fish of\r\nEnglish catching.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of appointing a Governor.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1667, the fishery of Newfoundland underwent a more mature\r\ndiscussion than it seems before to have received. In August of that\r\nyear several petitions, were presented to the privy council from the\r\nmerchants, owners of ships, and others, inhabitants of the towns of\r\n_Totness_, _Plymouth_, _Dartmouth_, and places adjacent, concerned in\r\nthe trade to Newfoundland. They stated, that several persons, upon\r\nspecious purposes, and for sinister ends, were endeavouring to establish\r\na _governor_, which had always been pernicious to the fishery; and\r\nbecause they were unable to attend or bear the charges of solicitation,\r\nand sending witnesses to such a distance, they prayed his Majesty to\r\nempower such persons of the county of Devon, as his Majesty should think\r\nfit, to hear and examine the whole matter, and make report thereof to the\r\ncouncil. Upon consideration of these petitions, _Sir Edward Seymour_,\r\n_Sir John Northcott_, _Sir William Courtnay_, _Sir Thomas Carew_, _Sir\r\nWalter Young_, and other gentlemen of Devonshire, were appointed to\r\nenquire into facts concerning the miscarriage of former governors to the\r\ndamage of the trade; and the petitioners were also required to prepare\r\nreasons to make good the allegations of their petitions. In consequence\r\nof which, depositions were taken at _Totness_, in which were certified\r\nthe inconvenience of appointing a governor, and the prejudice that would\r\nnecessarily thereby ensue to the fishery.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the 6th December following, the company of merchants,\r\nadventurers, and owners of ships, trading from _Bristol_ to Newfoundland,\r\nand several other merchants, petitioned his Majesty to provide a remedy\r\nto the dangerous condition of the fishery (which, they said, was likely\r\nto fall into the hands of the French), by sending some able person as\r\n_governor_, with guns, arms, ammunition, and other materials, necessary\r\nfor fortifying some of the harbours. This matter was referred by his\r\nMajesty to the _Earl of Anglesey_, _Lord Ashley_, _Mr. Comptroller_, _Mr.\r\nVice-Chamberlain_, and _Sir William Coventry_. These persons entered\r\ninto an examination of all the papers, and also of sundry merchants and\r\nother persons; but no resolution appears to have been taken thereon till\r\n1669, when a Captain _Robert Robinson_ petitioned for the settlement of\r\na governor; and, on a reference of this question to the lords of the\r\ncommittee for trade and plantations, their lordships reported, after\r\nhearing several merchants and others concerned in the trade, “that\r\nthey did not think fit to recommend the petition and proposal of _Mr.\r\nRobinson_ for making him governor of Newfoundland; but, for keeping\r\npeople living there in Christianity, they proposed that his Majesty\r\nshould send a chaplain in the convoy-ships; and _that the captains of the\r\nsaid ships should have power to regulate abuses there_, with reference\r\nto his Majesty’s letters patent granted to the western towns;” which\r\nreport was confirmed in every thing by his majesty on the 4th of February\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of the same month, complaint was made, that many owners of\r\nships carried out passengers, and private _boat-keepers_, contrary to\r\nthe laws and constitutions of the fishery, to the great detriment of the\r\nfishing trade, and to the lessening of the number of ships and seamen;\r\nthat many owners also victualled their ships from _Ireland_, instead\r\nof _England_. Upon which, an order of council was made, directing that\r\nthe mayors and magistrates of the several towns mentioned in the above\r\nletters patent, should be careful that the constitutions were punctually\r\nobserved; that the officers of the customs should charge all masters and\r\nowners of ships to put those rules in execution; should stop offenders\r\ntherein from proceeding in their voyage, and immediately return their\r\nnames to the council.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding the objections made by many to the appointment\r\nof a _governor_, those very persons felt the need of government and\r\nregulation: for on the 23d of December 1670, a petition was presented\r\nto his majesty, from the western merchants and traders, “That additional\r\npowers might be granted for regulating the fishery.” The lords of the\r\ncouncil, appointed for matters of trade, upon this occasion recommended\r\nseveral rules; and his majesty ordered, that they should be added to the\r\nformer charter. These were called _additional rules_, and were as follows.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Additional Rules.]\r\n\r\nThat his majesty’s subjects might take bait and fish at Newfoundland,\r\nprovided they submitted to the established orders.—That no alien should\r\ntake bait.—That no planter should cut down any wood, or should plant\r\nwithin six miles of the sea shore.—That no inhabitant or planter should\r\ntake up the best stages before the arrival of the fishermen.—That no\r\nmaster or owner of any ship should transport seamen, or fishermen to\r\nNewfoundland, unless they belonged to his ship’s company.—That none\r\nshould carry more than sixty persons for a hundred tons.—That every\r\nfifth man should be a green man, that is, not a seaman.—That the masters\r\nof ships should provide victual in England, according to the number\r\nof men, for the whole voyage, salt only excepted.—That no fishing ship\r\nshould part hence for Newfoundland, before the month of _March_.—That\r\nmasters should give bond of a hundred pounds to the respective mayors\r\nof the western towns, not to carry to Newfoundland any of the sort of\r\npersons before prohibited, and to bring back such as they did carry out,\r\nor employed in carrying fish for the market voyages.—That no person\r\nshould take up a stage with less than twenty-five men.—That no seaman\r\nor fisherman should remain behind, after the fishing was ended. It was\r\nordered, that the admirals, vice admirals, and rear admirals should\r\nput these orders in execution, and preserve the peace.—Should bring to\r\nEngland offenders of any sort—Should proclaim on the 20th of September,\r\nyearly, his majesty’s orders.—Should keep journals.—It was ordered that\r\nthe recorders and justices of the peace of the several western towns,\r\nshould be joined in commission with the mayors.—That reasonable fines\r\nshould be imposed on offenders.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was ordered, that a bill should be prepared to pass the\r\ngreat seal, for the confirmation of the last _charter_, with these\r\n_additional_ powers; and that the clause touching the marshal should be\r\nreviewed by Mr. Attorney General, who should present to the board _some\r\nway of judicature_, for the determining of causes at Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nIn February 1674-5 the question of appointing a governor was again\r\nbrought forward[1]. A petition had been presented, in which was set forth\r\nthe great advantage that would attend the fishing trade, by a settlement\r\nunder a _governor_; This was referred by the king to the lords of the\r\ncommittee for trade and plantations; and after hearing the reasons of\r\nthe merchants and owners of ships in the west of England, who protested\r\nagainst a settlement, together with what the petitioners could allege in\r\nbehalf of a colony, their lordships made report to his majesty, of their\r\nopinion thereon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Report against a Governor in 1675.]\r\n\r\nIn this report it is stated, that for some late years, the fish had\r\nfailed in Newfoundland; that the adventurers had lost many of their\r\nships in the late wars, especially in that with _Spain_; and that the\r\nlate wars had much diminished the hands which used to take fish: that\r\nthe inhabitants and planters, who, contrary to their old charter, lived\r\nwithin six miles of the sea, had destroyed the woods, and continued to\r\ndestroy whatever the adventurers left behind them; that they possessed\r\nearly the places of greatest convenience, and, which was very pernicious,\r\nmost of them sold wine, and brandy, whereby the seamen were withdrawn\r\nfrom their labor, and many seduced to stay in the place, while their\r\nfamilies thereby became burthensome to their respective parishes at\r\nhome. That the inhabitants lived scattered in five-and-twenty different\r\nharbors, almost eighty leagues asunder; and that in all the winter, when\r\nabuses were chiefly committed, there was no passing from one place to\r\nanother, so that near forty harbors would have no government, though the\r\ngovernor were actually in the country.\r\n\r\nIt is also stated, that besides the charge of forts, and a governor,\r\nwhich the fish-trade could not support, it was needless to have any\r\nsuch defence against foreigners, the coast being defended in winter by\r\nthe ice, and in summer by the resort of the king’s subjects; so that\r\nunless there were proper reasons for a _colony_, there could be none for\r\n_governor_. That against a colony, there were not only the rigours of the\r\nclimate, and infertility of the land, which obliged those who were there\r\nall the winter, to idleness, and inclined them to debauchery, but this,\r\nthat they chiefly consumed the produce of _New England_, by the shipping\r\nof which country, they were furnished with French wine and brandy, and\r\n_Madeira_ wines, in exchange for their fish, without depending, as they\r\nshould, for supply from England; so that if the climate and soil should\r\nfavour a colony, the planters would rather adhere to _New England_,\r\nand so go on to tread in the same steps as those colonists did, to the\r\nloss of the many advantages which, by the present method of things,\r\nare yet enjoyed by the mother country; there being no hope for a like\r\nregulation on the product of this place as on the products of the other\r\nplantations, because fish cannot bear the charge of coming home, but must\r\ngo _directly_ to the markets abroad.\r\n\r\nIt was reported that the French did not manage their fishery otherwise,\r\nthan by adventurers’ ships, that went out, and returned back yearly. That\r\nthey maintained a fort at _Placentia_ to defend them from the Indians,\r\nwho, at certain times, came off from the main, and molested them in their\r\nbeaver-trade; for which trade, and not for fishing, the French had a\r\nresidence there.\r\n\r\nIt was reported, that the adventurers caught fish cheaper than the\r\nplanters.\r\n\r\nUpon full consideration of all these circumstances, their Lordships\r\nproposed, that _all plantations in Newfoundland should be discouraged_;\r\nand, in order thereunto, that the commander of the convoy should have\r\ncommission to declare to all the planters, to come voluntarily away;\r\nor else that the western charter should, from time to time, be put in\r\nexecution; by which charter all planters were forbid to inhabit within\r\nsix miles of the shore, from Cape _Race_, to Cape _Bonavista_. Their\r\nLordships further proposed, that the _additional rules_, settled on the\r\n10th of March, 1670, should be observed, and that the mayors of the\r\nwestern ports should be required to renew their charter accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis report, from the Lords of the committee of council for trade and\r\nplantations was approved by his majesty, and order was thereupon given\r\nfor carrying into effectual execution, what was there recommended.\r\n\r\nIn viewing these transactions we plainly discover the two contending\r\ninterests in the Newfoundland trade; the one that of the planters and\r\ninhabitants, the other that of the adventurers and merchants; and we\r\nshall see, in the course of this history, that according to the views\r\nof these different description of persons, representations were at\r\nvarious times made to the government at home, for promoting or opposing\r\nregulations and establishments in the island.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir John Berry’s Advice.]\r\n\r\nAn occasion soon offered for shewing this spirit. Sir John Berry was\r\nappointed to command the convoy for the ships trading to Newfoundland;\r\nand in pursuance of a special order of council of the 15th of April 1675,\r\nthis commander laid before the committee of council for trade the state\r\nof Newfoundland, as he found it, in relation as well to the _planters_\r\nand _inhabitants_, as to the _western adventurers_; and it is worth\r\nremarking how different is the account given by this commander, from that\r\nlately made by the adventurers, and which had induced the committee of\r\ncouncil to report in the terms we have just heard.\r\n\r\nHe says, that several disorders, attributed to the planters, were\r\nchiefly occasioned by the adventurers’ ships—That the inhabitants never\r\nsold their fish to those of _New England_ for wine and brandy.—That the\r\nadventurers’ men pulled down the stages, and store-houses:—And, that it\r\nwas _their_ fault, that the seamen were seduced to stay in the country,\r\nfor it was to save _thirty shillings for their passages_.\r\n\r\nThis letter was read at the committee in the presence of several\r\npersons, who appeared there in behalf of the west country merchants,\r\nand who complained of the encouragement _Sir John Berry_ had given the\r\nplanters, contrary to his majesty’s orders, and to the certain ruin of\r\nthe adventurers’ trade, for such would follow from the continuance of\r\nthe inhabitants and bye boat-keepers. Upon which the Lords advised them\r\nto settle the _additional rules_, allowed by his majesty; and this, some\r\ntime after, was accordingly put in execution.\r\n\r\n_Sir John Berry_, at his return, attended the committee, where he\r\nrepeated and confirmed what he had written, and assured their Lordships\r\nof the necessity of encouraging a _colony_ in Newfoundland, if not, the\r\nFrench would take advantage by the intended removal, to make themselves\r\nmasters of all the harbours and fishing places about the island, or would\r\notherwise entice the English planters to come and settle among them, to\r\nthe great prejudice of our fishery.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between the adventurers and planters now grew very violent.\r\nIn 1676, _John Downing_, an inhabitant of Newfoundland, petitioned the\r\nking against the endeavours of the adventurers to pull down the houses,\r\nand burn the stages of the planters, in order to drive them out of the\r\ncountry. This complaint was referred to the committee of trade, where\r\ncounsel were heard in behalf both of the adventurers and planters; and\r\nthe committee having reported their opinion thereon, the king signified\r\nhis pleasure, that the masters and seamen belonging to the fishing ships\r\nshould not any ways molest the planters, upon pretence of a clause in\r\nthe western charter, whereby, “No person was to inhabit within six miles\r\nof the shore,” until his majesty should proceed to a further resolution\r\nconcerning the fishery and plantation of Newfoundland. Direction was\r\naccordingly given, by order from his majesty, to the captains of the\r\nconvoy ships, to make publication of his majesty’s pleasure, that the\r\nplanters should be permitted to continue in the possession of their\r\nhouses and stages, according to the usage of the last years, until\r\nfurther order. Moreover, that the state of the colony and trade might be\r\nbetter known, they were ordered to return answers to several _heads of\r\ninquiry_ prepared by the committee for trade and plantations; and the\r\nfollowing are the answers thereto sent by _Sir William Pool_ from St.\r\nJohn’s harbour, dated the 10th of September 1677.\r\n\r\nHe says, the fishermen confessed, that of late years the planters had\r\ndone no prejudice to the fishery; so that, when they returned, they\r\nfound their stages in as good order as could be after a winter; so that\r\nthey were not obliged to come sooner to the island for the purpose of\r\nrepairing them—the planters affirmed, they did not meddle with any of\r\nthe adventurers’ fishing places, nor did they desire to do it, provided\r\nthey might quietly enjoy the same room they had possessed for several\r\nyears—the fishermen complained, that the planters took up the best places\r\nto cure their fish, did damage to their stages, and took possession\r\nof more than they had hands to manage—the planters affirmed, that it\r\nwas impossible to live six miles from the sea-side, by reason of the\r\nbarrenness of the country—the fishermen did not desire the removal of\r\nthe planters, but only a better regulation—the planters could not keep\r\na constant number of men or boats, unless they were supplied every year\r\nwith servants from England—the planters did not take so much fish,\r\nproportionably to the number of men and boats they kept, as the fishers\r\ndid, who were better artists; nor sell it so cheap, by reason of the\r\ngreater wages they were obliged to give their servants—it was not\r\npossible for the planters to observe the charter punctually—the planters\r\nall sold drink contrary to their charter—the fishermen rinded the trees,\r\nand employed six and seven stages for seventy men, contrary to the rule\r\nof their charter—the French managed their fishery generally by fish-ships\r\nfrom Europe, and their trade for fur was very inconsiderable—the French\r\nplanters were very much encouraged by the governor, and had the same\r\naccommodation in their harbours as the fishermen had—the fishermen\r\nconfessed the planters were of great use to them—the planters prepared\r\nmaterials for the fishermen against their coming, which otherwise could\r\nnot be made ready without a great loss of time; they preserved in their\r\nhouses the salt that remained of the fishery until the next season; and\r\nwhen shipping was wanting, the fishermen were glad to lodge their fish\r\nin a planter’s house until the following year—in case the fishermen were\r\nvisited with sickness, or were obliged to stay for their ships on their\r\nfirst arrival, they used the convenience of the planters’ houses—when\r\nthe fishermen wanted provisions, the planters supplied them out of their\r\nstores; or when they had an overplus, the planters bought it of them for\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nSuch were the answers given by the commander of the king’s ships on\r\nthis station to the first _heads of enquiry_ concerning the trade and\r\nfishery. This method of enquiry was followed in after times; and the\r\ninformation it produced, in this first attempt, may be made useful matter\r\nof comparison.\r\n\r\nIn December 1677, the committee for trade and plantations, in pursuance\r\nof an order of council, that had been made on the petition of the western\r\nadventurers, made report, that notwithstanding a clause in the western\r\ncharter, forbidding the transportation of any persons to Newfoundland,\r\nthan such as were of the ships’ company, the magistrates of the several\r\nwestern ports did permit passengers, and private _boat-keepers_, to\r\ntransport themselves thither, to the detriment of the fishery; but they\r\nwere of opinion this might, for the future, be prevented, if not only\r\nthose magistrates, but the vice-admirals and officers of the customs,\r\nwere strictly commanded to prevent this abuse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bye Boat-keepers, what.]\r\n\r\nThe private boat-keepers here spoken of, or _bye boat-keepers_, as they\r\notherwise were called, are described as persons who, not being willing\r\nor able to buy a share in a fishing ship, hired servants in the west\r\nof England, and carried them as passengers to Newfoundland, where they\r\nemployed them in private boats to catch and cure fish; and after the\r\nseason was over, they brought them back to England, or permitted them\r\nto take service with the planters, or on board the ships. These bye\r\nboat-keepers used to go over yearly in great numbers; but this practice\r\nbeing contrary to the western charter, and the king’s express command,\r\nbegun now to be much disused.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Question of a Colony argued.]\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned representation against the bye boat-keepers was soon\r\nfollowed by a petition in behalf of the inhabitants of Newfoundland,\r\npraying generally, that nothing might be ordered to their prejudice. To\r\nbring this matter into full discussion, it was ordered by the king, that\r\nboth the adventurers and planters should be heard by their counsel. And\r\nthus was the question of the convenience and inconvenience of a colony\r\nsolemnly argued at the council. After which it was referred to the\r\ncommittee for trade, to propose some regulation between the adventurers\r\nand planters, which might consist with the preservation of the interest\r\nof the crown, and the encouragement of navigation and the fishing\r\ntrade[2].\r\n\r\nIt does not appear what report was upon this occasion made by the\r\ncommittee for trade; and I find no other proceedings of the government\r\nrespecting this trade and fishery till after the year 1696, when the\r\nboard of trade was instituted.—In January 1697, the new board took up\r\nthis among other subjects that came within their cognizance; but not\r\nbefore they were called upon by petitions and representations from the\r\ntowns in the west concerned in this trade. These, like former petitions\r\nand representations from the adventurers and fishers, were calculated to\r\nadvance their pretensions, in opposition to those of the planters and\r\ninhabitants, to deprecate the appointment of a governor, and to pray a\r\nconvoy for the safety of the ships going out, either to _Portugal_ for\r\nsalt, or to Newfoundland, and to protect them in their return home, or\r\nin their voyage to market[3]. The report and representation made by the\r\nboard on this occasion applied rather to the present defence of the place\r\nthan to any matter of general regulation; and they at the same time\r\nexpressed an opinion, that planters, in a moderate number, were at all\r\ntimes convenient for the preparation and preservation of boats, stages,\r\nand other things necessary for the fishery; but that they should not\r\nexceed _one thousand_[4].\r\n\r\nIn the year 1698 was passed the stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. c. 25.\r\nintituled, _An Act to encourage the trade to Newfoundland_. It does not\r\nappear what were the steps that immediately led to the passing of the\r\nact; but it appears, in the matter of it, to be founded on the policy of\r\nformer times; and it is, in truth, little more than an enactment of the\r\nrules, regulations, and constitution that had mostly prevailed there for\r\nsome time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PART II.\r\n\r\nFrom Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3, to A. D. 1728.]\r\n\r\n    _Mr. Larkin’s Observations—Character of the fishing\r\n    Admirals—Character of the Commanders—Want of Police—Opinion\r\n    of the Board 1706—Representation 1708—For Sea Commanders to\r\n    command at Land—Such Commission issues—Laws and Orders made\r\n    at Newfoundland—Representation 1718—Claim of the Guipuscoans\r\n    to fish—Of the Lands ceded by the French—A Salmon Fishery\r\n    granted—Opinion on the 7th Sec. of Stat. 10 and 11 Will.\r\n    3.—Representation 1728—Recommends a civil Government—A civil\r\n    Governor is appointed—Disorders of Newfoundland, and Conduct\r\n    of the fishing Admirals during this Period—Complaints from the\r\n    Merchants._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has ever been the disposition of the principal merchants in the west\r\nof England to extol the provisions of stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. as the\r\nsoundest policy that could be pursued in relation to the fishery. We\r\nknow, after perusal of the former part of this historical enquiry,\r\nthat there was always an opposition and jealousy subsisting between\r\nthe _merchants and adventurers on the one hand_, and the _planters\r\nand inhabitants_ on the other; and the utmost credit we can give to\r\nthe former, on this subject, is to believe, that this statute fully\r\nestablished their claims and pretensions, and gave them an ascendancy\r\nover the latter; and that they now saw sanctioned by parliament, what\r\nbefore depended upon a tenure of less validity. So far, and no farther,\r\ncan this eulogy have a meaning; for as a scheme of regulation, that was\r\nto be generally beneficial, this act was, in the first place, no novelty;\r\nin the second place it seems never, from the very beginning, to have\r\nbeen completely executed; and thirdly, it gave power and jurisdiction\r\nto hands that were unfit to exercise it: and I shall presently shew,\r\nthat those concede too much, who allow this act might have been a very\r\ngood regulation at the time it passed; for it will appear from the best\r\nauthority, that, at the very time it was passed, it was in no way of\r\nbeing carried into execution as the parliament intended.\r\n\r\nTo the _heads of inquiry_, which were delivered and given in charge to\r\nthe commodore, who commanded the ships on that station, this act, and all\r\nthe particulars of it, were now added; and there appear in the returns\r\nmade thereto every year, their observations and opinion, both upon the\r\nact and its execution. Upon such a subject there cannot be adduced better\r\nauthority than this. In the answers given to these _heads of inquiry_,\r\nand in the correspondence of the commodores, may be traced, from time to\r\ntime, the actual state of the fishery; and it will be curious to bring\r\ntogether the information that may be collected from these sources. Among\r\nthe earliest information of this sort, I find a letter from _Mr. George\r\nLarkin_, written from St. John’s in the year 1701. This was recently\r\nafter the passing of the act; and the writer goes more fully into many\r\npoints of the trade, than the officers of government usually did. These\r\ncircumstances make this a valuable paper; and it becomes much more so,\r\nwhen it is considered, that Mr. Larkin was a gentleman bred to the civil\r\nlaw, who was sent out to make observations in the American settlements,\r\nfor the information of government at home, as to the state of the\r\nPlantations, and the execution of the laws of trade and navigation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Larkin’s Observations in 1701.]\r\n\r\nHe begins by saying, that the rules and orders of this act were not so\r\nmuch regarded as he could wish, which he ascribes to there being no\r\npenalties in it. The trees were rinded, and the woods destroyed, as much\r\nas before passing the act; and in a few years, he thought there would not\r\nbe a stick left fit for the use of the fishery within five or six miles\r\nof that, or other harbours. The flakes that were left standing, were most\r\nof them made use of by the inhabitants for firing in the winter.\r\n\r\nHe says, the then admiral of the harbour of St. John’s, _Captain Arthur\r\nHoldsworth_, of Dartmouth, brought over from England, that fishing\r\nseason, two hundred and thirty-six passengers, all or great part of which\r\nwere _bye boat-keepers_, and they were brought, under a pretence of being\r\nfreighters aboard his ship, though it was only for some few provisions\r\nfor their necessary use. These persons he had put and continued in the\r\nmost convenient stages, &c. in the harbour, which all along, since the\r\nyear 1685, had belonged to fishing ships; in so much, that several\r\nmasters of fishing ships had been obliged to hire rooms of the planters.\r\nThese bye boat-keepers were most of them, he says, able fishermen, and\r\nthere was not one fresh man, or green man, amongst them, as the act\r\nrequires. He says, that this person, and one or two more, who constantly\r\nused the fishery, made it their business in the beginning of the year, to\r\nride from one market town to another in the west of England, on purpose\r\nto get passengers; with whom they made an agreement, that in case they\r\nshould happen to be admirals of any of the harbours, they would put and\r\ncontinue Mr. Holdsworth, and such persons, in fishing ships’ rooms. This,\r\nhe says, was a very great abuse and discouragement to the adventurers:\r\nbesides, these bye boat-keepers could afford to sell their fish cheaper\r\nthan the adventurers, which must lessen the number of fishing ships.\r\n\r\nThere was great complaint of the _New England-men_, who for seven or\r\neight years, he says, had resorted to Newfoundland. They had also their\r\nagents in most of the harbours, and drove an indirect trade, supplying\r\nseveral commodities to the planters, which they ought to take from\r\nEngland. Such New England vessels generally made two or three trips in a\r\nyear, with bread, flour, pork, tobacco, molasses, sugar, lime-juice, and\r\nrum. They sold cheaper in general, but obliged their purchasers to take\r\ncertain quantities of rum. This the inhabitants sold to the fishermen,\r\nand so encouraged them to stay behind, and leave their families in\r\nEngland a burthen on the parish. The inhabitants also sold rum to their\r\nservants, who run in debt, and were forced to hire themselves in payment\r\nof their debt; so that one month’s profuse living, and a pair of shoes,\r\noften left them in bondage for a year; and good fishermen, who deserved\r\nfifteen or twenty pounds per annum, were thus made to serve for seven\r\npounds. He says, the _New Englanders_, at the close of the year, used to\r\ninveigle away a great many seamen and servants, with promises of great\r\nwages; but these men were often disappointed, and turned robbers and\r\npirates. The New England vessels were said, the last year, to have taken\r\naway five hundred men in this manner, in _Conception Bay_ only; many of\r\nthese were headed up in casks to prevent discovery. He recommends, for\r\npreventing this practice, that the masters of New England vessels should\r\ngive bond, when they cleared out, not to bring men from Newfoundland\r\nwithout leave from the commodore.\r\n\r\nWe find, in after times, the captains of the king’s ships used to oblige\r\nevery New England master of a ship to give such bond, in a penalty of\r\nfive hundred pounds, with two sureties in two hundred and fifty pounds\r\neach, not to carry any persons out of the island.\r\n\r\nAs to the fishery, he did not hear of more than one New England vessel\r\nfishing on the coast. Indeed it appears, that _their_ fishery was\r\nall carried on upon their own coast, where they had better fish, and\r\nthat they looked to Newfoundland for nothing but the sort of traffic\r\nabove-mentioned.\r\n\r\nHe informs us, that the inhabitants and planters of Newfoundland were\r\npoor, indigent, and withall a profuse sort of people, that cared not at\r\nwhat rates they got into debt, nor what obligations they gave, so they\r\ncould have credit. But the seizing of their fish for debt, seemed to this\r\ngentleman to be both irregular and unjust, as to the time and manner of\r\ndoing it; for the fishermen seeing the flakes stript before the fishing\r\nseason was half over, were discouraged from proceeding any further; which\r\noften proved the ruin and overthrow of several planters’ voyages.\r\n\r\nDebts used not to be paid till the 20th of August; but, for two and\r\nthree years, he says, the flakes had been stript by night, and the fish\r\ncarried off in June and July, without weighing. A second had come, and\r\ntaken it from the first—the planter had had twenty or thirty quintals of\r\nfish spoiled in the scuffle, and the rest of his creditors were forced\r\nto go without any satisfaction. The poor fishermen, who helpt to take\r\nthe fish, had, on these occasions, gone without one penny of wages—salt\r\nprovisions and craft being always payable before wages; and he expresses\r\nastonishment, how the planters and inhabitants could procure hands from\r\nEngland to fish for them, considering how ill they used them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the fishing admirals.]\r\n\r\nWhere complaints of this sort had been made to the commander in chief, he\r\nhad ordered them to re-deliver the fish, and a dividend to be made. But\r\nthere being five or six and twenty different harbours, besides coves, and\r\nit being a great distance from _Bonavista_ and _Fermose_, to _St. John’s_\r\nto make complaints, the commander could do little; and the admirals, he\r\nsays, did not concern themselves at all, but left all to the commander.\r\nThese admirals, says he, ought to see to the preservation of the peace\r\nand good government among the seamen and fishermen, that the order and\r\nregulation of the fishery be put in execution; and they should keep\r\njournals: but instead of this, they were the first to break these orders,\r\nand there was not one of them, where _he_ had been, who had kept any\r\njournal at all.\r\n\r\nHe observes, that the late act of king William gave the planters a\r\n_title_, and it was a pity but that they had some laws and rules by which\r\nthey should be governed; though, he says, it was the opinion of all,\r\nsince he had come there, that it had been better, if all plantations had\r\nbeen discouraged, for the island was then become a sanctuary and place\r\nof refuge for all people that broke in England. Besides, the masters\r\nof the fishing ships encouraged several of their men to stay behind,\r\npersuading them they would soon get estates there; and this they did\r\nmerely to save the charge of their passage back to England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Character of the Commanders.]\r\n\r\nIt had been customary for the commander in chief, upon complaints made,\r\nto send his lieutenants to the several harbours and coves, to decide\r\nall differences and disputes that happened between masters of merchant\r\nships and the inhabitants, and between them and their servants; this\r\ngentleman declares it a shame to hear how matters had been transacted\r\nupon such occasions. He that made a present of the most quintals of\r\nfish, was sure to have the determination in his favour. He says, the\r\nwhole country exclaimed against the lieutenants in _Captain Poulton_ and\r\n_Captain Fairbourne’s_ time; and did not scruple to declare, that some\r\nformer commanders in chief had been a little faulty. He says, the then\r\ncommander, _Captain Graydon_, had taken much pains to do the country\r\njustice, and to settle religion amongst them, and people seemed well\r\nsatisfied with him. He says, there had never been any registry kept of\r\nthe _orders_ or _rules_ that had been made for the good of the fishery.\r\nWhat one commander in chief had established, another had vacated; he\r\nsays, he had prevailed with the present commander to leave an abstract of\r\nall such as had been made during his time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Want of Police.]\r\n\r\nHe says, that quarrels and disputes happened after the fishing season\r\nwas over; and in the rigour of the winter season, masters beat servants,\r\nand servants their masters. He therefore recommends, that one of the\r\nmost substantial inhabitants should be appointed in every harbour in the\r\nnature of a justice, for preservation of the peace, and tranquillity\r\namong them; and that some one, who understood the law, should be sent\r\nwith the commander in chief, or should reside there, as should be\r\nthought most convenient, in the nature of a judge advocate, to decide\r\nall differences, and matters of _meum_ and _tuum_ between masters of\r\nships, inhabitants, planters, and servants; that this person should have\r\npower to administer an oath to parties, or witnesses, for determination\r\nthereof in the most summary way, and that he should be obliged to go\r\nevery year to the following places; viz. _Bonavista_, _Trinity_, _New\r\nPerlican_, _Old Perlican_, _Carboneer_, _St. John’s_, _Bay of Bulls_, and\r\n_Ferryland_, and to stay a fortnight or three weeks at each of them. He\r\nadds, that such a person would be useful there for several purposes, and\r\namong others, that a true account might be had from him, how all matters\r\nwere transacted at Newfoundland[5].\r\n\r\nThe picture here given of Newfoundland is hardly heightened, or varied\r\nby any colouring to be found in the representations made by successive\r\ncommanders. They are usually in the same strain. The grievances and\r\ncomplaints, the remedies and expedients are uniformly the same; and it is\r\na remarkable circumstance in the history of this trade, that many of the\r\npapers relating to it, whether coming from the commanders, or from the\r\nmerchants and adventurers, in the times of king William and Queen Anne,\r\nwould apply to later times, as well as to those in which they originated.\r\n\r\nThe _heads of enquiry_ given in charge to the commanders, and the answers\r\nreturned by them thereto, would furnish a history of the fishery. These\r\nheads soon encreased from twenty or thirty, to sixty or seventy. It\r\nis not my intention to go over all these, or to pursue every point\r\nthat has arisen, at various periods, with relation to this fishery and\r\ntrade; but principally to trace the progress made in affording that\r\nisland some sort of _constitution_; and the settling of this, like the\r\nsettling of all other constitutions, will involve in it the parties, and\r\ndifferent interests that have, and still continue to prevail amongst the\r\nindividuals concerned in the trade, both here and in Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nIn the answers made by Captain Graydon, the commander, at this time, we\r\nfind, that a survey was made that year of all the encroachments made by\r\nthe inhabitants upon the liberties of fishing ships, since the year 1685,\r\nand they were all corrected, as appears from him.—That the admirals of\r\nthe harbours were the persons, who mostly brought bye boat-keepers,\r\nand put them in possession of ship’s rooms, under notion of their being\r\nfreighters (as was before alledged) the admirals advancing them money\r\nin England at five shillings in the pound.—The admirals did not observe\r\nthe rules prescribed in the act of parliament, but on the contrary, when\r\nthey wheedled a poor planter into debt, they took his fish by force from\r\nhim, and would even break open his house to get it. As to the admirals\r\nkeeping journals, accounts, &c. he found but four of them _capable_ of\r\ndoing it.—The admirals, before the 20th of August, used to hear some\r\ncomplaints, but after that, none were made to them, they being generally\r\nthe greatest aggressors themselves.\r\n\r\nSuch are the observations made upon those points, that are more\r\nparticularly for our consideration at present. We shall find, as we go\r\non, how uniform were the complaints of abuses, and irregularities in the\r\npolice and government of the island.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opinion of the Board 106.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1702, the war with France broke out, and our fishery and\r\nconcerns there were greatly disturbed by the French. During this, the\r\nquestions agitated at the board of trade mostly concerned the defence\r\nof the island by sea and land. Notwithstanding this state of war, an\r\norder was made by the House of Commons, the 16th of January 1705-6, for\r\nlaying before the house a state of the trade, and fishery; a state was\r\nfor this purpose drawn up by the board; in this they give their opinion\r\nupon the different abuses and grievances; and, amongst other things,\r\nrecommend that power should be given by parliament to the commanders of\r\nthe queen’s ships, and to the admirals, to inflict fines and penalties on\r\nthe breaches of Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3, c. 25. they recommend also, that\r\nthe commanders of the queen’s ships should have the power of custom-house\r\nofficers to search ships from _New England_[6]—In the same year they\r\nrecommended to her majesty, that the mayors of the towns in the west,\r\nshould be written to, requiring them to enjoin the masters of ships, who\r\nmight become admirals, to keep journals, and discharge the other duties\r\nrequired of them by Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3, c. 25[7].\r\n\r\nThe board were called upon again the next year by the House of Commons\r\nfor a state of the trade[8], which was accordingly furnished, and in\r\nthis statement the same abuses were recounted and the same remedies were\r\nsuggested for their correction.\r\n\r\nOn the 31 of March 1708, the House of Commons addressed her majesty,\r\nbeseeching her to give directions, that the laws relating to the trade\r\nand fishery of Newfoundland might be effectually put in execution\r\nagainst such commanders of her majesty’s ships of war, or forts, or\r\nfortifications there, as should presume to exact, demand, or receive\r\nsums of money, or other rewards from any of the queen’s subjects, in\r\ntheir voyages, trade, or fishery to, from, or at Newfoundland: And\r\nthat such commanders and officers should be strictly forbidden to\r\nkeep, use, or employ any fishing boats for their own private use or\r\nadvantage: further, that the laws relating to the fishery should be\r\nduly executed[9]. This address was occasioned by some complaints made\r\nagainst a _Major Lloyd_, who commanded the troops at _St. John’s_; but\r\nof this gentleman’s conduct there were different accounts; the most\r\nunfavourable seem to have prevailed with the House of Commons to come to\r\nthis resolution.\r\n\r\nThis call for a due execution of the laws relating to the fishery, again\r\ndrew the attention of the board of trade to the Stat. 10 & 11 Will.\r\n3, c. 25. and the defect, so often complained of in that act, “not\r\nhaving any penalties specially annexed to the breach of it.” And on a\r\nquestion proposed by the board to Mr. _Montagu_, then solicitor general,\r\nhe declared it to be clear, that although no particular penalty was\r\nmentioned in an act of parliament, requiring or prohibiting any thing,\r\nyet any offender against such act may be fined at the discretion of the\r\ncourt, when found guilty on an indictment or information[10].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Representation 1708. For the sea commanders to command at\r\nland.]\r\n\r\nThe board then proceeded to make a representation to her majesty\r\non the occasion of the before-mentioned address; in which they say,\r\nthat no complaint had ever come to them of exactions, or demands made\r\nby commanders of the queen’s ships; and if there were, the offender\r\nshould be prosecuted on Stat. 15 Car. 2. c. 16. That the charge against\r\n_Major Lloyd_, for letting out the soldiers to work in the fishery, was\r\nunder examination at the board. But that for preventing any misconduct\r\nof officers with relation to the fishery and trade in future, they\r\nrecommended, that the commodore, during his stay there, should have\r\nthe command at land, as he used to have from the first sending out of\r\na garrison, till within the last three years, when that practice was\r\ndiscontinued. They thought this would contribute better to support\r\ngood order and peace, in a place where no regular civil government was\r\nestablished; and that it would enable him to superintend the queen’s\r\nstores, and to make better returns of the state of the trade and fishery.\r\nAs to the execution of the act in general, they stated the abuses and\r\nirregularity subsisting in the island; the ignorance and partiality of\r\nthe fishing admirals; and they recommended that the commodore should be\r\nimpowered to redress and punish all offences, and abuses committed at\r\nNewfoundland against Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3, c. 25.; as to those which he\r\ncould not redress, they recommended he should inform himself whether the\r\nprovisions of the act were duly complied with, and who were the offenders\r\nagainst them, in order that they might be proceeded against in this\r\nkingdom. They submitted whether it would not be proper to issue a royal\r\nproclamation for better observation of this law[11].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Such commission issues.]\r\n\r\nThis representation was approved by the queen, and an order of council\r\nwas made on the 20th of May 1708, directing a proclamation of the sort\r\ntherein recommended, to issue; and also a commission to be prepared\r\nannually by the Lords Commissioners for trade and plantations, for\r\nthe commodore of the Newfoundland convoys, to command at land,\r\nduring his stay in those parts, with such further _instructions_ for\r\nputting in execution that act of parliament, as were set forth in the\r\nrepresentation; the Lords were also directed to prepare a letter to\r\n_Major Lloyd_, disapproving his proceedings, and requiring him to yield\r\ndue obedience to the commodore’s commission: all which was accordingly\r\ncarried into execution[12]. _Instructions_ were delivered to the\r\ncommodore for executing this commission to command at land; and in one of\r\nthose he was directed to send answers to the _heads of enquiry_, which\r\nhad long been in use, relating to the trade and fishery, and which were\r\nalways prepared by the board of trade, and afterward given in charge to\r\nthe commander by the lord high Admiral.\r\n\r\nThis change in the command at Newfoundland set the lords of trade upon an\r\nenquiry after the commission (before noticed) given in 1615 to _Captain\r\nWhiteburn_ out of the court of admiralty for impanelling juries[13]. It\r\nseems also, that it was in agitation for the commissioners of the customs\r\nto appoint an officer for preventing illicit trade in Newfoundland. The\r\nlords of trade were informed from the custom-house, that when a court of\r\nadmiralty should be erected, and a person appointed to hear and determine\r\ncauses on informations of seisures, a revenue officer should have his\r\ncommission and instructions.\r\n\r\nBut the French had got so strong, and had so disturbed our possessions in\r\nthe island, that every thing gave way to plans of immediate and necessary\r\ndefence. Through the year 1710, the merchants were making representations\r\nto the board of trade, beseeching, that in any treaty of peace with the\r\nFrench, Newfoundland might be reserved wholly to the English. This idea\r\nwas adopted by the board, and they appear to have pressed it strongly\r\nwith her Majesty’s ministers[14].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Laws and orders made at Newfoundland.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1711, I find, what is called, _a record of several laws\r\nand orders made at St. John’s for the better discipline and good order\r\nof the people, and for correcting irregularities committed contrary to\r\ngood laws, and acts of parliaments, all which were debated at several\r\ncourts held, wherein were present the commanders of merchants’ ships,\r\nmerchants, and chief inhabitants; and witnesses being examined, it was\r\nbrought to the following conclusion between the 23d day of August and 23d\r\nday of October 1711._ Then follow fifteen articles of regulation[15],\r\nthat must have been very useful; and it is worth considering whether\r\nsuch a local legislature, which the people seem in this instance to have\r\ncreated for themselves, might not legally be lodged somewhere, for making\r\nbye-laws and regulations, as occasion should require. The commander\r\n_Captain Crowe_, presided at this voluntary assembly. His successor, it\r\nseems, followed his example, and held a meeting of the same sort. These\r\nassemblies were somewhat anomalous, a kind of legislative, judicial, and\r\nexecutive, all blended together[16]; and yet perhaps not more mixed than\r\nthe proceedings of parliaments in Europe, in very early times.\r\n\r\nAt the peace of Utrecht we were put into possession of Newfoundland in\r\na way we had not enjoyed it before, for some years. Placentia, and all\r\nthe parts occupied by the French, were now ceded to the king of Great\r\nBritain, in full sovereignty; the French retaining nothing more than a\r\nlicence to come and go during the fishing season. A new prospect now\r\nopened; and the government, not less than the merchants, turned their\r\nthoughts to that trade with a spirit that promised itself all the fruits\r\nof this new acquisition. A _Captain Taverner_ was employed to survey\r\nthe island, its harbours, and bays; a lieutenant-governor was appointed\r\nto command the fort at _Placentia_; the merchants beseeched the board\r\nof trade that the French might be strictly watched, and kept to their\r\nlimits, and that a ship should go round the island, to see they left the\r\ndifferent harbours at the close of the season.\r\n\r\n_Captain Taverner_, who had great experience in that trade, and was\r\nmuch attended to at this time, gave in to the board some remarks on the\r\nNewfoundland fishery and trade; and also heads of a proposed act of\r\nparliament[17]. It appears from the observations made by this gentleman,\r\nas well as many others, that nothing was more strongly expressed by all\r\npersons, who shewed any anxiety, or experience on this subject, than\r\nthe inefficiency of Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3, and the necessity of going to\r\nparliament for new regulations.\r\n\r\nIt had become a doubt, whether that part of the island, lately ceded by\r\nthe French, was subject to the provisions of Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3. This\r\npoint was brought forward, in consequence of the lieutenant-governor of\r\nthe garrison at _Placentia_, and some of the French planters having,\r\non leaving the place, disposed of their plantations for money, and, in\r\nthis manner, attempted to convey a right and property, which was not\r\nrecognised by the general usage of the island, as confirmed by that\r\nstatute. This matter was brought before the board of trade, and their\r\nlordships were of opinion, that Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3. extended to the\r\nceded lands, and that all the beaches, and plantations there, ought\r\nto be left to the public use, and be disposed of, as directed by that\r\nact[18]. Instructions to that effect were accordingly given to the\r\nlieutenant-governor of _Placentia_[19].\r\n\r\nAmong the proposals and suggestions for improving the trade of\r\nNewfoundland, some papers from _Mr. Campbell_, in the year 1714 are\r\ndeserving of notice[20].\r\n\r\nThe Newfoundland trade was taken up by the government in the year 1715,\r\nas an object of important consideration. _Captain Kempthorn_, then on\r\nthat station, was specially charged to make enquiry, and report every\r\ninformation he could acquire; and I find a very long letter written by\r\nhim to the secretary of the admiralty, and transmitted from thence to the\r\nboard of trade. This letter is very full, and was submitted by the board\r\nto the king’s government, as containing suggestions highly deserving\r\nconsideration[21]. The board were now satisfied that some new regulation\r\nought to be made by parliament; and preparatory thereto, they resolved to\r\nwrite to the towns in the west, concerned in this trade, desiring them\r\nto furnish such information as they possessed upon a subject where they\r\nhad so much experience[22]. They also laid a case before the attorney\r\ngeneral, _Sir Edward Northey_, for his opinion on the defects of Stat.\r\n10 & 11 Will. 3. and he was of opinion, that it would be necessary, in\r\norder to oblige the observation of the rules contained in that statute,\r\nfor a new act to be passed, inflicting _penalties_ for not observing the\r\nsame, and directing how and where such penalties should be paid; and he\r\nthought that a proclamation, requiring the observance of those rules\r\n(as was before proposed) would have no effect[23]. On this occasion.\r\n_Mr. Taverner_ suggested his remarks, and gave a sketch of a bill[24].\r\nAfter the board had derived the information that was to be obtained\r\nfrom the different sources, where they had applied, they drew up a long\r\n_representation_ to his majesty, dated the 2d of March 1715-6 containing\r\ntheir opinion upon the abuses, suggesting the remedies that would be\r\nproper to be applied[25], and recommending that a bill should be proposed\r\nto parliament for giving effect to the suggestions there made.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Representation 1718.]\r\n\r\nNothing was at that time done; but the board continued to pursue the\r\ncourse they had taken for obtaining information: for in August 1718, we\r\nfind a very full answer given in by _Captain Passenger_ upon the whole\r\nof the subject of the trade and fishery; and in December following, the\r\nboard made a _representation_ to his majesty, more elaborate, full, and\r\ncomprehensive, than any performance that had yet been seen, respecting\r\nthis trade and fishery; and to this they afterwards added the _heads of\r\na bill_, to be proposed to parliament, for establishing the trade and\r\nfishery, and correcting the abuses to which it had been subject[26]. This\r\nrepresentation, and the heads of the bill, have been lately laid before\r\nthe house of commons, and are now printed by their order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Claim of the Guipuscoans to fish.]\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the _Guipuscoans_ had set up an antient right to\r\nfish at Newfoundland; and application had been made to our court for\r\nasserting and allowing this claim. This matter was referred to the board\r\nof trade; and that board did, on the 11th of September 1719, make a\r\n_representation_ to the lords justices; in which they say, that by the\r\nfifteenth article of the treaty of _Utrecht_, the _Guipuscoans_ could\r\nclaim no right, but such as they could make out by some prior title; they\r\nthen recapitulated the ancient history of our discovery and possession\r\nof the island; and that by stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. all aliens are\r\nexpressly excluded from the fishery; and they conclude, that the island\r\nand the fishery are the undoubted property of his majesty, and that the\r\n_Guipuscoans_ had no manner of right to fish or trade there[27]. They\r\ntake this occasion to remind the lords justices of the representation\r\nthey had made last year, and of the heads of a bill then suggested for\r\nbetter regulating the fishery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the Lands ceded by the French.]\r\n\r\nThe parts that had been surrendered by the French, occasioned in various\r\nways great contest and discontent. We have before seen, that it was the\r\nopinion of the board, that those parts fell under all the regulations\r\nof the stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3.; and this was confirmed by the opinion\r\nof the law officers. Another difficulty arose, in consequence of an\r\nagreement made by the Queen with the king of France, which went beyond\r\nthe terms of the treaty of Utrecht. The French were by the treaty\r\nallowed to remain and enjoy their estates and settlements, provided\r\nthey qualified themselves to be subjects of Great Britain—those who\r\nwould not do this, had leave to go elsewhere; and take with them their\r\n_moveable_ effects. _Queen Anne_, in consideration of the king of France\r\nreleasing a number of protestant slaves out of the gallies, permitted the\r\nFrench inhabitants of _Placentia_, who were not willing to become her\r\nsubjects, to sell their _houses_ and _lands_ there. It became therefore\r\na _question_, whether this permission of the queen was valid, so as to\r\ndispose of _lands_ which came to the crown by treaty. This point was\r\nsubmitted to _Mr. West_, counsel to the board of trade, for his opinion;\r\nand it was material to settle it, because many British subjects had\r\npurchased such lands from the French inhabitants.\r\n\r\nHis answer was, that the queen could not by her letter dispose of lands\r\ngranted to the crown by treaty; but if she entered into any regular\r\nagreement with the court of France for that purpose, she was, by the\r\nlaw of nations, engaged to do every thing in her power to enable the\r\nFrench to have the benefit of it; which might be done by her confirming\r\ntitles to such of her subjects as should pay the French a confederation\r\nin money, or otherwise, for their lands or houses[28]. Many such lands\r\npurchased by _Governor Moody_, having been used for fortifications, the\r\nboard recommended compensation to be made him by the crown.\r\n\r\nBut when this question was so answered, what became of the right to\r\nships’ rooms, as established by stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. which statute\r\nwas held to apply to the French parts now ceded, as well as to the other?\r\n_Placentia_ being the best part for fishing, the English complained\r\nthey were deprived of the benefit they had promised themselves, by this\r\nnew acquisition, as they could not resort thither, without paying high\r\nrents for a plantation to cure their fish. In truth, many French still\r\ncontinued there, and they gave encouragement also to _Biscayans_, and to\r\nthe people of _Guipuscoa_, who, we have seen, were starting a pretension\r\nto fish at Newfoundland, of right. All these together constituted a\r\nsource of great discontent, and so continued for several years[29].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Salmon Fishery granted.]\r\n\r\nAnother question, as to the right of property at Newfoundland, arose\r\nupon a _salmon fishery_, which had been carried on and improved by _Mr.\r\nSkeffington_, between _Cape Bonavista_ and _Cape John_, in a part never\r\nfrequented by any fishing ships; he had cleared the country up the rivers\r\nfor forty miles, and had built houses and stages. This person applied\r\nfor an exclusive grant of this fishery for a term of years;—the matter\r\nbeing referred to _Mr. West_, he reported, that such a grant would not be\r\ninconsistent with the stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3[30]. The board accordingly\r\nrecommended to his majesty, that a term of 21 years, in a sole fishery\r\nfor salmon, in _Fresh-water Bay_, _Ragged Harbour_, _Gander Bay_, and\r\n_Dog Creek_, might very well be granted by his majesty, with liberty to\r\ncut wood and timber in the parts adjacent, provided it were at six miles\r\ndistant from the shore[31].\r\n\r\nIn the close of the year 1728, we find the board of trade once more\r\ntook up the subject of this trade and fishery, in consequence of the\r\nrepresentations made by _Lord Vere Beauclerck_, the commodore on that\r\nstation. In order to bring the subject under full discussion, they caused\r\nletters to be written to the chief magistrates of the different towns\r\nin the west, requesting the merchants to send their thoughts, whether\r\nany thing, and what, might be done for the further encouragement of the\r\nfishery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opinion on Sec. 7, of Stat. 10 and 11 Will 3.]\r\n\r\nWith a view of understanding the situation and tenure by which persons\r\nheld their lands in Newfoundland, the board referred, at this time, a\r\nquestion to _Mr. Fane_ on the seventh clause of stat. 10 and 11 Will 3.\r\n“Whether the possessors had an inheritance therein, or only an estate for\r\nlife?” and he was of opinion, that by the words of this clause, an estate\r\nfor life only passed to the possessors, and consequently a right of\r\nalienation only for that interest, for the following reasons:—1st. From\r\nthe general rule of law, that the king’s right and interest can never be\r\nbound by general words—2dly. From the inconvenience that would ensue,\r\nif by these general words an estate of inheritance should be construed\r\nto be given; for these houses, &c. might fall into hands improper for\r\ncarrying on the fishery, or be bought by such as are in the interest of\r\nour enemies; or such new erections, houses, &c. might be purchased by\r\none person, or two, and so an engrossing established, against the design\r\nand intention of the act—3dly. From the words of the clause, which seem\r\nto confine the possession to the builder; for the act says, _to_ HIS\r\n_or_ THEIR _use_; which implies, as he apprehended, that this is only\r\na personal privilege; and a privilege it was sufficient, to have an\r\nestate for life in a house, &c. probably slightly built; and which, in\r\nall likelihood, would only last for the life of the builder—4thly. This\r\nact was made, he apprehended, in disfavour of the Newfoundland-men; and\r\nit could not be supposed such a favourable provision, in this instance,\r\nwould be made for them, when they were discountenanced in every other\r\nclause of the act; especially too against the right and interest of the\r\ncrown, which, in all doubtful cases, must be preferred[32].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Representation 1728.]\r\n\r\nThe letter to the mayors of the western towns produced only two answers;\r\none of which consisted of a complaint against _Colonel Gledhill_, the\r\nlieutenant governor of _Placentia_, for encroaching upon the fishing\r\nrooms, engaging in the fishery, and using his power in an illegal and\r\narbitrary manner; the other complained of the illicit trade of the _New\r\nEngland men_. Not the least advice was given as to any mode of correcting\r\nirregularities, nor was any thing said as to the want of order, and good\r\ngovernment. The board were, therefore, left to take such course as they\r\nin their wisdom should think proper. They accordingly proceeded on such\r\nevidence as they had, and drew up a representation to his majesty, dated\r\nthe 20th of December 1728. In which they declare, “That the want of\r\nsufficient power in the commodore for enforcing the act of parliament,\r\nand the general contempt, into which the authority vested in the fishing\r\nadmirals had fallen, had reduced the fishery to a very bad condition;\r\nand, unless proper remedies were applied, in all probability we should\r\nentirely be deprived of the advantages derived by the nation from this\r\ntrade.”\r\n\r\nThey then go over the abuses and irregularities so often complained of;\r\nthe increase of bye boat-keepers, the settling of persons in the island,\r\nthe enticing away of seamen, and fishermen by the _New Englanders_,\r\nwho also carried on an illicit trade; the disorders of the garrison at\r\n_Placentia_; the clashing interests of the adventurers and the planters;\r\nand the inefficacy of Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3. They remind his majesty\r\nof their representations of the 2d of March 1715-16, and especially of\r\nthat of the 16th of December 1718, and the _heads of a bill_ annexed to\r\nthe latter. They submit that so much of that, as may be thought proper,\r\nmay be proposed to parliament immediately; they judging that an _intire\r\nremedy_ for the evils complained of, could not be effected, without the\r\nassistance of the legislature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recommends civil government.]\r\n\r\nHowever, they said, there were some irregularities, which could be\r\ncorrected by the king’s own authority, without the interposition of\r\nparliament; those were, the irregularities of the garrison, and the\r\ndisorders committed in the winter season. With respect to the former,\r\nthey recommend, that considering the lieutenant governor of _Placentia_\r\nthought himself accountable to no one but the king, a nearer controul and\r\ncheck over his conduct would keep him within bounds; and therefore, that\r\nthe commodore on the station should be commander in chief both by sea and\r\nland, as had formerly been the practice, which would at once put an end\r\nto the competition, and jealousy, which had so long subsisted between the\r\nland and sea forces. As to the second, they recommend, that the commodore\r\nmight have power to appoint judges, and justices of the peace, to decide\r\ndisputes between the inhabitants, and distribute justice amongst them\r\nduring the winter season. This they thought would alleviate the misery\r\nof those unhappy people, which was great enough without additional\r\nevils from the anarchy in which they lived. They say, that heretofore\r\nmuch encouragement had not been given the settlers, to continue in the\r\nisland, and therefore regular governors, as in other colonies, had very\r\nseldom been appointed for them; and it was their opinion, that these poor\r\npeople, should rather be encouraged to settle in _Nova Scotia_. They were\r\nabout _three thousand_ in number, with their wives and children, and\r\nmight be of service there, where inhabitants were wanted.\r\n\r\nThey took into consideration the claim of property made to stages, &c.\r\nin prejudice of the fishing ships, upon which _Mr. Fane’s_ opinion had\r\nbeen taken; and they thought many such titles, if enquired into, would\r\nbe found to be defective; they therefore proposed, that some person,\r\nskilled in the laws, might attend the next commodore, and assist him to\r\nenquire into them, in behalf of the crown. The same person might likewise\r\nbe useful in forming regulations for the better government of the\r\ninhabitants, during the winter season, so long as they continue there.\r\nThey also recommended, that the bishop of London, as ordinary of the\r\nplantations, should send a clergyman, whose salary might be put on the\r\nestablishment of the garrison at _Placentia_[33].\r\n\r\nThis representation of the lords of trade was taken into consideration\r\nat the committee of council. The committee referred to the board to\r\nconsider whether, as the commission, proposed to be given to the _Lord\r\nVere Beauclerck_, would vacate his seat in parliament, the service\r\nintended might not be equally well carried on by _instructions_ to be\r\ngiven to the _Lord Vere Beauclerck_, for putting in execution all the\r\npowers entrusted to the commodore, by stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3. and by a\r\n_commission_, to be given by his majesty to a person skilled in the laws,\r\nwho should accompany the _Lord Vere Beauclerck_, for appointing justices\r\nof the peace, and establishing some form of civil government among the\r\npeople who had settled themselves in that island, that they might not be\r\nleft in a state of anarchy, upon the departure of his majesty’s ships of\r\nwar. If their lordships saw no objection thereto, they were desired to\r\nconsider of a proper form of commission and instructions.\r\n\r\nThey were also desired to consider, whether it might be adviseable to\r\nseparate the government of _Placentia_ from that of _Nova Scotia_.\r\n\r\nThe committee made another order the 19 of April 1729, in which they\r\nrecommended to his majesty all the points proposed by the lords\r\ncommissioners of trade.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the first order of the committee of council, the lords\r\nreport, that they thought a commission to some person to attend the _Lord\r\nVere Beauclerck_, with proper instructions, might serve instead of a\r\ncommission to his lordship. They prepared a commission and instructions\r\naccordingly, whereby such person was required to take the advice of\r\n_Lord Vere Beauclerck_, and to execute such matters as his lordship\r\nshould propose to him in writing, for his majesty’s service. Among\r\nthe instructions they inserted some relative to the acts of trade and\r\nnavigation; which, however, their lordships thought would prove of small\r\neffect till his majesty should be pleased to erect a court of admiralty,\r\nor some other proper jurisdiction in Newfoundland, to take cognizance of\r\noffences against those acts.\r\n\r\nThey drew up instructions for _Lord Vere Beauclerck_, and made the old\r\nheads of enquiry a part of them.\r\n\r\nThey remark, that they had added an instruction, which required his\r\nlordship to send home all offenders, in robbery, murder, and felony, and\r\nlikewise the witnesses, which had not always been done. This was to be\r\npractised till such time as some other method should be established for\r\ntrying offenders in the country, which may, say their lordships, perhaps\r\nbe thought necessary, so soon as the island shall have been put under\r\nbetter regulations, and some person skilled in the laws may hereafter be\r\nannually sent thither for this purpose, with his majesty’s commission of\r\noyer and terminer.\r\n\r\nThey were of opinion that the government of _Placentia_ should be\r\nseparated from that of _Nova Scotia_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A civil governor is appointed.]\r\n\r\nThis design for establishing some sort of government in Newfoundland\r\nended in the appointment, not of _a person skilled in the law_, but of\r\n_Captain Henry Osborn_, commander of his majesty’s ship _the Squirrel_.\r\n\r\nThe commission given to Captain Osborn begins by revoking so much of\r\nthe commission to the governor of _Nova Scotia_, as related to the\r\ngovernment of _Placentia_, or any other forts in Newfoundland; and\r\nthen goes on to appoint _Henry Osborn governor and commander in chief\r\nin and over our said island of Newfoundland, our fort and garrison at\r\nPlacentia, and all other forts and garrisons erected and to be erected\r\nin that island_. It then gives him authority to administer the oaths to\r\ngovernment, and to appoint justices of the peace, with other necessary\r\nofficers and ministers for the better administration of justice, and\r\nkeeping the peace and quiet of the island. But neither he nor the\r\njustices were to do any thing contrary to the Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3,\r\nnor obstruct the powers thereby given to the admirals of harbours, or\r\ncaptains of the ships of war. The justices were required to be aiding and\r\nassisting to the commodore, or commanders of the ships of war, and the\r\nfishing admirals, in putting in execution the said statute. The governor\r\nwas to erect a court-house and prison; all officers, civil and military\r\nwere to be aiding and assisting to him in executing this commission. In\r\ncase of his death, the government was to devolve on the first lieutenant\r\nof _the Oxford_, the ship commanded by _Lord Vere Beauclerck_.\r\n\r\nSuch were the terms of the first commission of civil governor, granted\r\nfor Newfoundland. The instructions that accompanied this commission, have\r\nnothing in them very particular. They are fourteen in number; and the\r\nlast required him to execute all such matters as _Lord Vere Beauclerck_\r\nshould propose to him, for his majesty’s service. The instructions to his\r\nlordship contained all the _heads of enquiry_ relating to the trade and\r\nfinery, and the abuses and irregularities so long complained of, and they\r\nwere fifty in number.\r\n\r\nWe are told, that on the 24th of May 1729, a box was sent to the _Lord\r\nVere Beauclerck_, in which were eleven setts of _Shaw’s Practical Justice\r\nof the Peace_, each impressed on the covers, in gold letters, with one\r\nof these titles, _Placentia_, _St. John’s_, _Carboneer_, _Bay of Bulls_,\r\n_St. Mary’s_, _Trepassey_, _Ferryland_, _Bay de Verd_, _Trinity Bay_,\r\n_Bonavista_, _Old Parlekin_ IN NEWFOUNDLAND; together with thirteen\r\nprinted copies of Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3, and a bundle containing the acts\r\nrelating to the trade and navigation of this kingdom. And thus provided,\r\nhis lordship and the governor set sail for Newfoundland[34], in the\r\nsummer of the year 1729.\r\n\r\nHaving brought down this history to the period, when an attempt was made\r\nto afford some sort of civil government to Newfoundland, I shall make a\r\nshort pause in the narrative; and call the reader’s attention to some\r\nfew documents, that will more strongly impress upon his mind the actual\r\nstate of things in that island, and the pressing necessity there was for\r\nthe interposition of the parliament, or of the executive government, to\r\ncorrect abuses, and establish some sort of regular authority. I have\r\nbefore given a particular account of the enormities subsisting within\r\nthree years after passing Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3, from a letter written\r\nby a person then confided in by the government at home; I mean Mr.\r\nLarkin[35]. It is very plainly to be collected, from the representation\r\nmade by that gentleman, that this statute was ineffective and inadequate\r\nfrom the very beginning. What is inapplicable in its origin, is not\r\nlikely to become more useful in a course of time. It will be found, in\r\nfact, that in all the time that elapsed between passing that act, and\r\nthe year 1729, disorder and anarchy increased more and more; and nothing\r\nremained but to try another system.\r\n\r\nThe documents I shall produce will be extracts from the correspondence\r\nand communications made by the commodores and commanders on the\r\nNewfoundland station, to the board of trade. In these it will be seen,\r\nwhat was the nature of the disorders and irregularities committed in the\r\nisland; and it will appear how very inadequate was the authority and\r\njurisprudence conferred by the statute of King William, and how ill the\r\nauthority and jurisdiction so given, was administered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disorders in Newfoundland, and conduct of the fishing admirals\r\nduring this period.]\r\n\r\nOne of the correspondents writes in this manner.—“The admirals which are\r\nappointed by the Newfoundland act, to decide differences, in relation to\r\nfishing-rooms, &c. have entirely neglected it in all its parts. Indeed,\r\nat their first arrival, they claim their prerogative, as by the said\r\nact, as far as it suits with their own interest and no further; except a\r\nparticular friend of theirs should arrive with a fishing ship; in such\r\ncase should the ships fishing rooms of that harbour be taken up before\r\nhe arrives, they often remove some planter or other for him, pretending\r\nthat the planter’s title is not good to the room he possesses, when the\r\ncommanders of men of war, some years before, adjudged it to be the said\r\nplanter’s right.”\r\n\r\n“These things are often done, and several of the inhabitants’ fishing\r\nvoyages ruined thereby. It is common, that what is done one year,\r\nin relation to fishing rooms, is contradicted the next; so that the\r\nfishing-rooms, are not settled to this very day. Many times these\r\n_admirals_ never were in the land before, nor knew any thing of the\r\nmatter; in which case some old west country master commonly takes care\r\nthat the said admiral do nothing but what he pleases.—Those are the\r\npatrons that are commonly called _kings_ in that country, who sacrifice\r\nother people’s interest frequently to serve their own. The admirals\r\nare some of the first men to cut down the roofs of their stages,\r\ncook-rooms, and flakes, which paves the way for the inhabitants to follow\r\ntheir example, who in the winter season generally carry away all the\r\nremainder. It is certain the admirals are seldom or never at leisure to\r\nhear any complaints whatsoever, except one of their favourites is the\r\nplaintiff[36].”\r\n\r\n“The masters of ships in Newfoundland generally endeavour to force their\r\ngoods upon the inhabitants, especially the poorer sort, who generally\r\npay dearest. Say they, if he makes a good voyage, we shall be all paid;\r\nand if he does not (says every one to himself) I will be quick enough\r\nto get my payment. By this means they have a jealous eye, the one over\r\nthe other. If the fishing does not prove so good as was expected, some\r\nof these matters will fall upon them, before the fishing season is half\r\nover, take away their fish before half made; another comes and takes away\r\nhis train; and many times there comes a third, who has more men than\r\nthey, and takes it away from the former; he that has most men is sure\r\nto have the greatest share. This is a common practice in Newfoundland.\r\nThey never acquaint the admirals with this proceeding before they do it;\r\nneither do the admirals trouble themselves with it afterwards. But the\r\nconsequence lies here; the planters’ men will catch no more fish, because\r\nthey have no hopes of getting any wages; the planter is ruined, and all\r\nthe rest of the creditors unpaid; who, if they had given him the liberty\r\nto make his fishing-voyage, might have paid them all. The merchants of\r\nEngland have suffered exceedingly by this unparalleled thing, there being\r\nno precedent for it in the whole Christian world. I am fully satisfied\r\nthat by this thing, and the multiplicity of liquors imported into\r\nNewfoundland yearly, the trade thereof has suffered more, than by the\r\nFrench plundering it so often in the late wars.”\r\n\r\n“It is most certain that the admirals in Newfoundland have _never_ taken\r\nany care about the good of that trade; and their reasons generally\r\ngiven for it are, that they come to Newfoundland to mind their owner’s\r\nbusiness; and as nothing was allowed them for defraying the charges of\r\nkeeping courts, they could not do it[37].”\r\n\r\nAnother writes thus.—“But what I would more particularly represent to\r\ntheir lordships, is the clandestine and illegal commerce carried on\r\nbetween the _New England men_, and several of the British masters,\r\nespecially the fishing admirals; who after they have, according to the\r\nact, qualified themselves in England for fishing ships, depart for\r\n_France_, _Spain_, or _Portugal_, where they freight with wines and\r\nbrandies; which early in the year they carry directly to Newfoundland;\r\nand either dispose of to the planters, or barter with the New England-men\r\nfor the produce of the plantations. By these means Newfoundland is not\r\nonly supplied with these foreign European commodities, but it is become\r\na mart, from whence other American plantations are (in fraud of his\r\nmajesty’s duties) in a good measure furnished.”\r\n\r\n“As the admirals are chiefly concerned in this unfair trade, so their\r\ntyranny and oppression in the harbours, where there are none of his\r\nmajesty’s ships, is not to be reckoned amongst the least causes of the\r\ndecay of the fishery; those who labor in it, having learnt by experience,\r\nthat the rule of their decision is their private interest, and that\r\nfishermen are not to expect any justice from them. This contributes to\r\na scarcity of men, which occasions wages to be so extravagant, that the\r\nfish which they catch is often not sufficient to pay the servants. And\r\nthe inhabitants are thereby so much discouraged, that there have not been\r\nhalf the number of boats employed by them as formerly.”\r\n\r\n“But whatever redress the corrupt administration of the admirals is\r\ncapable of, another great disadvantage, which the fishery labors under,\r\nproceeds from the country being, during its long winter, without the\r\nleast form of government or order. It is my humble opinion, that it\r\nwould be of considerable service to it, if some of the inhabitants were\r\nintrusted with commissions of the peace for the administration of justice\r\nduring that season[38].”\r\n\r\nAnother writes—“I flattered myself that as there was no garrison here\r\n(namely at _St. John’s_) to terrify or interfere, I should find a\r\nstricter obedience to the laws and regulations that had been made for\r\nthe government of the place; and that proper regard was shewn to the\r\nauthority vested by law in the fishing admirals; but on the contrary I\r\nfind, that through the ignorance of some, and negligence of more, for\r\nsome years past, they have been so slighted, that unless the captains\r\nof the men of war are present to assist and countenance them at their\r\ncourts, their meetings would be nothing but confusion, and their orders\r\nof no use, which is the reason we are obliged _to usurp_ power, which, I\r\napprehend, does not properly belong to us, of publishing orders in our\r\nown names; to prevent, as much as we can, the threats, the rioting, and\r\ndisorders, which, to the great detriment of the fishery, are generally\r\npractised in our absence.”\r\n\r\n“The great misfortune, and which I think is the origin of all the rest\r\nthat attend this country, is, that no body in the winter season is\r\nempowered to keep peace, and administer justice; that the sober and\r\nindustrious are every day liable to be insulted and robbed by the\r\nidle and profligate, unless they can oppose them with greater force.\r\nIn the _heads of inquiry_ from the lords commissioners for trade and\r\nplantations, there is an article which directs, the names of the persons\r\nto be returned them, who administered justice during the last winter;\r\nbut I cannot find that we are any where authorized so to empower proper\r\npersons upon leaving the country; which is so well known by every body,\r\nthat were we to pretend to appoint any body, not the least regard would\r\nbe shewn them.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of _Placentia_, and the part surrendered by the French at the\r\ntreaty of _Utrecht_; he says,—“Before the arrival of the men of war,\r\nthey are threatened and intimidated into a compliance with whatever\r\nis required of them; the admiral’s powers are contemned; their court\r\nrepresented as ridiculous and invalid, and of course, no justice to\r\nbe had. But as this has been already represented by petition from the\r\nmasters of ships, and other methods, I will not take up your time by\r\nenumerating more particulars, which would only be a repetition of what\r\nis already sufficiently known to their lordships. Although I could not\r\nsettle every thing in the order it ought to be, I endeavoured to do all\r\nI could; and as I found the regard to the fishing admirals so mightily\r\ndiminished, as made me justly apprehend, orders from them would be but\r\nnegligently obeyed, I therefore gave out in my name, such as I found\r\nabsolutely necessary, the copies of which I have herewith sent; and have\r\nalso entered them in a book, which I have left sealed up with one of the\r\nprincipal inhabitants, to be delivered to the next officer that shall\r\ncome after me, that he may know what I did, and my reasons for so doing.\r\nI beg leave to say, that if such a register of the proceedings of every\r\nofficer had been kept ever since we had possession of the place, it would\r\nnot be so difficult to decide every one’s property; which really, as\r\nthings were, I could not pretend to do, without running a risk of doing\r\ninjustice.”\r\n\r\n“I found disputes had been very differently decided; sometimes according\r\nto the laws and customs that were in force in the time of the French, and\r\nsometimes according to those observed in the other parts of Newfoundland.\r\nFor no new act having passed since the acquisition of the place, and\r\nno certain rules presented by _the heads of inquiry_ from the lords of\r\ntrade, every one has decided as he thought proper[39].”\r\n\r\nAnother says, “there is another great occasion of disorder, which always\r\nstores up large stock of complaints, to perplex us upon our arrival—the\r\nneglect of deputing some body to maintain order in the winter, or the\r\nwant of power rather to depute some body for that purpose; so that\r\nthe winter season is a sort of respite from all observance of law or\r\ngovernment. At that time, theft, murder, rapes, or disorders of any kind\r\nwhatsoever, may be committed, and most of them are committed without\r\ncontroul, and time enough given for the offender to make off: for\r\nshould any one concern himself to secure the party, his design would be\r\nwithstood, as an usurped authority; and most would take part with the\r\noffender, to suppress the usurpation, without regard what became of the\r\ncriminal, or what may be the consequence of the crime; and I have been\r\nacquainted with some cases of this kind: so that there seems an absolute\r\nnecessity, that this particular should be provided for, that people may\r\nalways have somebody to apply to for justice; that somebody may always\r\nbe at hand to suppress disorder and riot, and to have a lawful power to\r\ncommand the assistance of his majesty’s subjects in the execution of a\r\nduty exercised for the public good. _St. John’s_ is the metropolis of the\r\nisland, and the discipline which is kept up there, whether bad or good,\r\nwill have a great influence upon all the rest of the harbours. If good\r\norder could be established here, it might easily be effected in all other\r\nplaces; and I do not know any thing that tends more to confusion, and\r\nproves more prejudicial to the fishery, than that irregularity.”\r\n\r\nAfter having spoken of the oppression from debts, the imposition in\r\nprices, the seizing for payment, and the like, he goes on—“It is likewise\r\nnecessary to acquaint their lordships, that although it is reasonable\r\nfor them to believe, that the authority given by the statute to the\r\nadmirals of harbours, is sufficient to secure them peace and quietness,\r\nand to prevent any disturbances that may happen, to the detriment of\r\nthe fishery, yet the experience of any one that has but once known this\r\ntrade, will affirm, that was it not for the yearly expectation of a ship\r\nof war coming among them, the power of their admirals would be of little\r\nregard; so that one may modestly affirm, they only commence regulation\r\nupon the arrival of any of his majesty’s ships, and lay it down the\r\nmoment they are gone; upon which account several go and come with the\r\ntrade, which charge, I believe, they would gladly be freed from, could\r\nthey be secure of good order in the winter[40].”\r\n\r\nAnother writes, “I have made it my particular care to inform myself about\r\nthe government, _that_ being the material and only thing wanting: for\r\nwithout that there is nothing; and with that, I mean a good government,\r\nthere would be every thing—it would give a new life and spirit to every\r\nthing; for then every man would know his own, and no more; every one\r\nwould know his master, and obey; and every one would know his servant,\r\nand no more; every servant would do his master’s work, and every master\r\nwould pay his servants’ wages without fraud; he would know his own\r\npile of fish, his boat, his stage, his nets, &c. But on the foot it is\r\nnow on, he that happens to be the strongest, knows every thing to be\r\nhis own, and the weakest knows nothing, or had as good as know nothing,\r\nexcept in that little interval of time when his majesty’s ship, or ships,\r\nhappen to be there; and very often the aggressor absconds, runs into the\r\nwoods, and flies from justice, until the ships are gone; and then down\r\nhe comes, and reigns lord again. This has been done by a great many, but\r\nespecially by one _Ford_, who had a power left him by a commander of one\r\nof his majesty’s ships to be governor of _Petty Harbour_. I have seen,\r\nand heard so very much of this, that I faithfully believe, and I have\r\ndone myself the honour in two letters to my lords of trade, to acquaint\r\nthem, as I here do, that no man living in the country of Newfoundland\r\nis fit to govern. For the set of people that live here, are those that\r\ncannot live in Great Britain, or any where else, but in a place without\r\ngovernment; and it is my opinion, without there is a _governor_, a man of\r\nhonour and justice sent to Newfoundland, I mean a _civil governor_, that\r\nshall not reside altogether at one place, but must have a sloop, or some\r\nembarkation, to transport him from cove to cove, and set order and rule\r\namongst them, the fishery and trade to that place must fall in a little\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\n“I have given out several orders for the admirals, and the oldest masters\r\nand planters to survey the stages and cook-rooms, &c. to know what belong\r\nto ship-rooms, and what was boat-rooms; and their report to me was, that\r\nthey had not been surveyed so long, that there was none, either admirals,\r\nmasters, or inhabitants, knew one from another; which was the best, and\r\nall that I could get on that head[41].”\r\n\r\nAgain—“for the most part the admirals are for their own private benefit,\r\nand not the public good, in general; they have some privileges more than\r\nthe others, and especially in collecting their debts due to themselves,\r\nand very little else is minded of the act of parliament, relating to the\r\nadmirals of the harbours, if they are not compelled by the commanders of\r\nhis majesty’s ships of war, and all this is for want of a governor on the\r\nspot. The admirals determine differences, and very often they appeal\r\nto the commanders of his majesty’s ships for a final determination; but\r\nstand by that no longer than while the captain is on the spot[42].”\r\n\r\nAnother writes, “I had several complaints from the inhabitants and\r\nothers, of injustice done them by the _admirals_, _vice-admirals_, &c.\r\nof their taking their fish off the rocks before cured, and other goods,\r\nfor debts by them contracted, without any law or justice, which has been\r\na common thing amongst them; so that they wholly ruin the fishery, for\r\nthe planters have nothing to work with next year. These things are done\r\nby masters of ships, when the admiral has been in harbour, without his\r\norder. By this irregular proceeding the strongest man gets all, and the\r\nrest of the creditors nothing; so that the next year a planter is forced\r\nto hire himself out for a servant.”\r\n\r\nAgain—“as for the people complaining to admirals of any injustice done\r\nthem by others, I do not find that any master of a ship values him, but\r\nthe strongest side takes away every thing by force[43]”.\r\n\r\nAnother writes, “the admirals prove generally the greatest knaves, and\r\ndo most prejudice, being both judge and party, in hearing suits for\r\ndebt; and when they have saved themselves, then they will do justice to\r\nothers: so it would be requisite to have a civil government, and persons\r\nappointed to administer justice in the most populous and frequented\r\nplaces, that they may be governed as Britons, and not live like a\r\nbanditti or forsaken people, without law or gospel, having no means of\r\nreligion, there being but one clergyman in all the country[44].”\r\n\r\nWhile the king’s officers, and persons employed and trusted by the\r\ngovernment, were making such uniform complaints of the abuses and\r\ndisorders in the government of Newfoundland, the merchants adventurers\r\nseem to have been wholly blind to these irregularities. In several\r\nrepresentations and memorials from them, sent in consequence of letters\r\nfrom the board of trade, written in the year 1715, there are complaints\r\nof grievances, but those were quite of a different sort; and if _they_\r\nwere removed, they appear to have been wholly unconcerned as to the\r\ncontinuance of those we have just been recounting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complaints from the Merchants.]\r\n\r\nThey complain of the great quantities of liquor and tobacco, which had\r\npaid no duty, and were imported by the _New England-men_, whereby the\r\nfishermen were debauched, and the fishery generally hindered; that the\r\nNew England ships enticed away the seamen, and were encouraged thereto\r\nby a premium of forty shillings per head, given by the government of New\r\nEngland for bringing seamen and fishermen. They prayed that all import of\r\nliquor and tobacco, except from Great Britain, should be prohibited, and\r\nthe articles forfeited; and that the fishing admirals should have power\r\nto seize, and to have half the forfeiture.\r\n\r\nThey prayed, that all store-houses, &c. built by planters since 1685, in\r\nthe front of fishing ships’ rooms, towards the water, should be declared\r\nby act of parliament to belong to the ship to which the fishing room\r\nbelonged—this to be enforced by forfeitures, to be levied by the fishing\r\nadmirals. For better preservation of store-houses, cook-rooms, stages,\r\n&c. &c. they prayed that the fishing admirals, at the end of the season,\r\nshould inspect them all, and depute some honest and best inhabitant of\r\nthe harbour, to take care that no one presumed to demolish or injure\r\nthem; and that such person so deputed should receive twenty shillings\r\nfrom the fishing ship which occupied it next season.\r\n\r\nThey propose some strict regulations, to prevent aliens and strangers\r\nsending out ships as English owned; with a power to the fishing admirals\r\nto administer an oath to the masters of ships, as to the ownership; and\r\nto seize, as forfeited, all foreign ships; half the forfeiture to go to\r\nthe person seizing.\r\n\r\nThey complain, that the French parts were not so open for fishing ships\r\nto get rooms as they should be, _Governor Moody_ and others pretending\r\nto have bought the French plantations; that the governor had permitted\r\nFrench ships to come, and had taken all power out of the hands of the\r\nfishing admirals.\r\n\r\nIn order that the poor labouring fishermen might not suffer oppression\r\nand disturbance from any military, or public officer, soldier, they\r\ndesired, that no military person, on any pretence whatsoever, should\r\nintermeddle with the fishery or fishermen, inhabitants, or others; nor\r\nshould let the soldiers out to hire, nor keep suttling houses, nor have,\r\nfor their private use, any house out of the lines of the fortification,\r\nor any gardens that have served, or may serve, for fishing rooms,\r\naccording to the judgment of the fishing admirals of the harbour.\r\n\r\nAnd because the commodores of late years had taken upon them to keep\r\ncourts, and send warrants to several remote harbours, for commanders of\r\nfishing ships, in the height of the season, upon frivolous complaints\r\nof idle and debauched men, and others, without the complaint being\r\nfirst heard by the fishing admirals, according to act of parliament,\r\nto the great prejudice of the fishery—they prayed, that the commodore\r\nmight not in future be permitted to do the like; that all complaints\r\nmight be decided by the fishing admirals, and that no commodore should\r\npresume to intermeddle with debts between merchants, masters, planters,\r\nand fishermen, as they had lately done, to the great prejudice of the\r\nmerchants. They pray, that the ships of war, which were there to project\r\nthe trade, might be obliged to come or send assistance, in case of piracy\r\nor mutiny in any of the harbours.\r\n\r\nThey pray, that none should retail liquors to fishermen, or persons\r\nconcerned in the fishery, but only to their own servants; that goods, the\r\nproduce or manufacture of Great Britain, might be exported duty free, for\r\nthe benefit of the fishery; that all oil, blubber, furs, and fish, taken\r\nor made in Newfoundland by British subjects, might be imported duty free,\r\nand that Mediterranean passes for the ships carrying fish might be given\r\ngratis.\r\n\r\nThey pray, that fishermen should be obliged to fish till the last day of\r\nAugust, if required by their masters. The usual day had been the 20th of\r\nAugust; but the fish now came later. That fishing admirals should have\r\npower to give corporal punishment to all persons, of what degree soever,\r\nwho profaned the Lord’s-day, and all common drunkards, swearers, and lewd\r\npersons; that a sufficient number of ministers should be sent to the\r\nprincipal harbours, to instruct the inhabitants; and that they might be\r\npaid from England, the country being very poor[45].\r\n\r\nOthers represented, that it would be proper to add penalties to stat.\r\n10 and 11 Will. 3.; that masters of ships should give bond to bring\r\nback such persons as they carried out; or, if they went to a foreign\r\nmarket, to procure others to do it; that bye boat-keepers should give\r\nbond to return and bring back all their servants and hired men, with the\r\nlike proviso, in case of going to a foreign market; that masters coming\r\nfrom any place but Great Britain, should give bond not to take away any\r\nfishermen or seamen—the penalty to be fixed by the fishing admirals; that\r\nseamen, or fishermen, who refused to return home, should forfeit all\r\ntheir wages; that no master of a ship, bye boat-keeper, or other person,\r\ngoing or trading to Newfoundland, should give credit to any servant or\r\nfisherman to more than forty shillings; nor any other person selling\r\nliquor to more than five shillings; that a debenture, or bounty, be\r\nallowed on all beef and pork, as if exported for sale; and also for all\r\nbread, flour, and malt, that should be shipped off in fishing ships bound\r\nfor Newfoundland[46]. To these particulars were added the same complaints\r\nabout foreigners interloping in the fishery, as in the former memorials.\r\nThe mayor of Plymouth, in answer to the same sort of letter from the\r\nboard, says, that the merchants had no other complaint to make than the\r\nencroachments of foreigners[47].\r\n\r\nSuch were the representations made by the officers of the crown on\r\none hand, and by the merchants on the other, respecting the trade and\r\ngovernment of the island. I have delivered them in their own words, and\r\nthe reader will decide between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PART III.\r\n\r\nFrom A. D. 1728, to Stat. 15, Geo. 3.]\r\n\r\n    _Justices appointed—Opinion on raising Money by the\r\n    Justices—Contest between the Justices and fishing\r\n    Admirals—Opinion on the Authority of the Admirals—A Court\r\n    of Oyer and Terminer proposed.—Such Commission issued—Lord\r\n    Baltimore revives his Claim—The Peace of 1763—Remarks\r\n    of the Board on Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3.—Newfoundland a\r\n    Plantation—Custom-house established—Property in Flakes, &c.\r\n    discussed—Stat. 15, Geo. 3, c. 31._\r\n\r\n\r\nSome hope might reasonably be entertained, that the establishment of a\r\ncivil government, and the appointment of justices of the peace, with\r\nproper officers for executing the law, would have been received by all\r\nas a desirable improvement in the state of society in the island, and\r\nit might be expected, that such an appointment could not fail of its\r\neffect. But the cause which had always operated to prevent any sufficient\r\nauthority being introduced into that place, opposed itself to this new\r\nestablishment. The _western merchants_, who had been silent, while this\r\nmeasure was in agitation, were ready enough to bring complaints of its\r\nconsequences, when carried into execution; and we shall soon see the\r\nstruggle made to prevent any lawful authority taking root an Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nThe government soon had to regret, that they had not taken the advice of\r\nthe board of trade, to bring forward a bill in parliament for correcting\r\nall the abuses, then subsisting there; for it will be found that the\r\nopposition raised against the civil governor and his justices, was on\r\naccount of their not deriving their authority from parliament, but only\r\nfrom the king in council. How futile soever this reason may be, it had\r\nits effect in staggering many, and contributing to bring the office, and\r\npersons bearing it, into great question, if not contempt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Justices appointed.]\r\n\r\n_Mr. Osborn_, upon his arrival, proceeded to carry into execution\r\nhis commission. He divided the island into convenient districts, and\r\nappointed in each of them, out of the inhabitants and planters of the\r\nbest character, such a number of _justices of the peace_ and constables,\r\nas seemed necessary. In order for building a prison, he ordered a rate,\r\nsuch as the justices represented, he says, to him as of little burthen\r\nto be raised, within the districts of _St. John’s_, and _Ferryland_; and\r\na prison was to be built in each of those places. It was not greater\r\nthan half a quintal of merchantable fish per boat, and half a quintal\r\nfor every boats’-room, including the ships-rooms of ships fishing on the\r\nbank, that had no boats; with the like proportionable rate upon such\r\npersons in trade as were not concerned in the fishery; this rate was\r\nonly for one fishing season. He erected several pair of stocks, and he\r\nexpressed a hope that the measures he had taken would be sufficient to\r\nsuppress the great disorders that had so long prevailed.\r\n\r\nBut he says he most feared, that as the best of the magistrates were but\r\nmean people, and not used to be subject to any government, they would\r\nbe obedient to orders given them, no longer than they had a superior\r\namongst them. He says, that he and _Lord Vere_ had done many acts of\r\njustice to the inhabitants and planters, particularly at _Placentia_,\r\nwhere they restored several plantations that _Colonel Gledhill_ had\r\nunjustly possessed for several years; and many more might have been taken\r\nfrom that officer, had the real proprietors been on the spot to sue for\r\nthem[48].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opinion on raising money by the justices.]\r\n\r\nWhen _Lord Vere_, and _Mr. Osborn_, returned to England, they made a\r\nreport of what they had done; in order to be ascertained of the ground on\r\nwhich they acted, they wished the opinion of the law-officers might be\r\ntaken on some points, and four questions were accordingly referred to the\r\nattorney-general, then _Sir Philip Yorke_. The main point was the levying\r\nmoney for building the prisons; and the attorney-general was clearly of\r\nopinion that the justices of the peace in Newfoundland had not sufficient\r\nauthority to raise money for building a _prison_, by laying a tax upon\r\nfish caught, or upon fishing-boats; the rather because Stat. 10 & 11\r\nWill. 3. directs that it shall be a free trade. The power of justices of\r\nthe peace in England for building gaols depends, says he, upon Stat. 11 &\r\n12 Will. 3, c. 19. by which they are enabled to make an assessment upon\r\nthe several divisions of their respective counties, after a presentment\r\nmade by the grand jury at the assizes, great sessions, or general gaol\r\ndelivery. As the justices of peace were by their commissions, to act\r\naccording to the law of England, he apprehended they ought to have\r\npursued that act of parliament as nearly as the circumstances of the case\r\nwould admit, and to have laid the tax, after a presentment by some grand\r\njury; and then it should have been laid upon the _inhabitants_, and not\r\nupon the _fish_ or _fishing-boats_. So far as the people had submitted to\r\nthis tax, there might, he said, be no occasion to call it in question;\r\nbut he could not advise the taking of rigorous methods to compel a\r\ncompliance with it.\r\n\r\nAs to assaulting any of the justices or constables, or any resistance to\r\ntheir authority; that, says he, might be punished by indictment, fine,\r\nand imprisonment at the quarter sessions; and for contemptuous words\r\nspoken of the justices or their authority, such offenders could only be\r\nbound to their good behaviour. Destroying the stocks or whipping-posts\r\nwere indictable offences. He was of opinion the justices could not decide\r\ndifferences relating to property, their power being restrained wholly to\r\nthe criminal matters mentioned in their commission.\r\n\r\nHe thought neither _Captain Osborn_, nor the justices had power to raise\r\nany tax for _repairing churches_, or any other public work, except such\r\nworks for which power was given to justices of the peace in England to\r\nlevy money, by particular acts of parliament[49].\r\n\r\n_Mr. Fane_ was likewise consulted upon these points, and was of the same\r\nopinion; however he adds, for their lordship’s consideration, admitting\r\nthe Stat. 11 & 12 Will. 3. had not been strictly pursued, yet as the\r\nassessment of fish was equally laid, as the people had submitted to it,\r\nas no other way could be thought of for raising the tax; and as his\r\nmajesty’s commission would be intirely ineffectual, unless a gaol was\r\nbuilt, whether any inconvenience could arise, if upon the refusal of any\r\nof the persons assessed, the method laid down by Stat. 11 & 12 Will.\r\n3. were pursued to compel a compliance with it[50]. Upon being again\r\nconsulted, he says, he thought _Captain Osborn_, as he had acted with so\r\nmuch caution and prudence, and had taken no arbitrary step, in execution\r\nof his commission, could not be liable to a prosecution in England, in\r\ncase the inhabitants should not acquiesce in the tax. He thought it\r\nabsolutely necessary the tax should be levied according to the Stat. 11\r\n& 12 Will. 3. and notwithstanding the proceeding already had was not\r\nentirely agreeable to that law, he thought _Captain Osborn_ would be very\r\nwell justified in pursuing it, as it seemed the only method whereby the\r\ndesign of his majesty’s commission could be executed[51].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contest between the justices and fishing admirals.]\r\n\r\nSuch were the discussions raised on the occasion of these attempts\r\nto improve the police of the island. _Mr. Osborn_ again went to\r\nNewfoundland: but in a letter from St. John’s in September 1730, he gives\r\na very bad account of the new institution. He says, he had hoped that a\r\nproper submission and respect would have been paid to the orders he had\r\ngiven, and to the magistrates he had appointed; but instead thereof, the\r\n_fishing admirals_, and some of the rest of the masters of ships and\r\ntraders in the island had ridiculed the justices’ authority very much,\r\nand had used their utmost endeavours to lessen them in the eyes of the\r\nlower sort of people, and in some parts had, in a manner, wrested their\r\npower from them. The admirals had brought the powers given them by the\r\nfishing act in competition with that of the justices, and had not even\r\nscrupled to touch upon that of the _governor_. All this discord proceeded\r\nfrom a jealousy the admirals and the rest of the masters of ships had\r\nconceived, that their privileges granted them by Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3.\r\nwere invaded by these magistrates; which power, says he, “those admirals\r\ncould hardly ever be brought to make use of (without it was to serve\r\ntheir own purposes) before, nor till they saw these officers established;\r\nand they are now, adds the governor, doing all they can against these\r\nmen, only because they bear this commission. Indeed, says he, I find by\r\ntheir will, they would be sole rulers, and have nobody to controul them\r\nin their arbitrary proceedings. He expostulated with them, but it seemed\r\nto serve no other purpose than to raise their resentment against him, as\r\nthe abettor of the justices. He could not charge the justices with having\r\ntaken any arbitrary steps; their fault was rather the contrary, whereas\r\nthe admirals were guilty of many.”\r\n\r\n“The commission of the peace was in general disliked by all the _masters\r\nof ships_, who were the chief people that opposed most of the steps the\r\ngovernor had taken; for which reason, and partly from the indifference\r\nof some of the justices, in their offices, who thought they suffered in\r\ntheir way of trade, and got the ill will of the people they dealt with,\r\nand partly from the incapacity of others, the commissions of the peace\r\nwere but indifferently executed. However the governor, notwithstanding\r\nthis opposition, proceeded to make appointments in places where he had\r\nbefore made none.”\r\n\r\nThe _prison_ and _court house_ at St. John’s were nearly finished, and\r\npeople had very well complied with the rate. He agreed to a presentment\r\nfor a rate to build a prison at _Ferryland_; and he said, he did not\r\ndoubt but the very sight of these two prisons would, in some measure,\r\ncheck many people in their evil courses[52].\r\n\r\nMemorials were presented to the governor, by the justices of _St.\r\nJohn’s_, complaining that they were obstructed in their duty by the\r\nfishing admirals, who had taken upon them the whole power and authority\r\nof the justices, bringing under their cognizance all riots, breaches of\r\nthe peace, and other offences, and had seized, fined, and whipped at\r\ntheir pleasure; they had likewise appointed public-houses to sell liquor,\r\nwithout any licence from the justices; the admirals told the justices,\r\n_they_ were only _winter justices_, and seemed to doubt of the governor’s\r\nauthority for appointing; that the authority of the admirals was by act\r\nof parliament—the _governor’s_ only from the privy council[53]. This\r\ndistinction in the authority from whence they derived their power, was\r\nthought sufficient for the admirals to presume upon; and the comparative\r\npretensions of them and the justices were rated accordingly in the minds\r\nof the ignorant and malicious[54].\r\n\r\nThe towns in the west were not backward to join in this clamour against\r\nthe justices; they complained that the governor had taken the power out\r\nof the hands of the fishing admirals, and vested it in the justices, who\r\nhad proceeded in an arbitrary way to tax the servants and inhabitants;\r\nhad issued out their warrants not only against servants, but against\r\nthe masters of vessels themselves, in the midst of their fishery; to\r\ntheir great prejudice, and in defiance of the admirals and the act of\r\nparliament. They suggested that these justices were, some of them New\r\nEngland men; and none of them ever coming to England, as the admirals\r\ndid, there was no redress to be obtained against them for their illegal\r\nproceedings. They said, some of the justices supplied the fishermen and\r\nseamen with liquor at exorbitant rates, though the merchants would\r\nsupply them at a moderate advance. After stating such plausible topics,\r\nwhich, it was well known, would always be listened to when Newfoundland\r\nwas in question; they prayed, “That such justices might have no power\r\nduring the stay of the fishing ships; but that the admirals might resume\r\ntheir authority, and that the commodore and captains of men of war should\r\nbe ordered to be aiding and assisting to them therein[55].”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Opinion on the authority of the admirals.]\r\n\r\nThis competition between the fishing admirals and the justices was taken\r\ninto consideration by the board of trade, who called for the opinion of\r\n_Sir Philip Yorke_, then attorney-general, and he reported, that upon a\r\nview of the commission to the justices, of Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3. and of\r\nall the complaints, it appeared to him the whole authority granted to the\r\nfishing admirals was restrained to seeing the rules and orders contained\r\nin that act, concerning the regulation of the fishery, duly put in\r\nexecution; and to the determination of differences arising between the\r\nmasters of fishing boats, and the inhabitants, or any bye boat-keepers,\r\ntouching the right and property of fishing-rooms, stages, flakes, &c.\r\nwhich was a sort of civil jurisdiction in particular cases of property;\r\nwhereas the authority of justices extended only to breaches of the peace.\r\nHe was therefore of opinion, that the powers granted to the justices were\r\nnot inconsistent with any of the provisions of the act, and that there\r\nwas no interfering between the powers given by the act to the admirals,\r\nand those by the commission to the justices[56].\r\n\r\nThe struggle between the fishing admirals and the justices was still\r\nkept up; the west country merchants, and masters of ships supporting the\r\nformer, and the governor standing by the latter. This produced complaints\r\non both sides; and no doubt, in such a contest a just cause of complaint\r\nmight often be found on both sides. But the aggressors were certainly\r\nthose who set themselves against the authority of the governor and\r\njustices, and who, by their conduct on this occasion, plainly shewed\r\nthey wished the inhabitants and poor planters should be deprived of all\r\nprotection from legal government, and should be left wholly at _their_\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nIt was given in special charge to the succeeding governor, _Captain\r\nClinton_, and to his successors, to make a report of what was done\r\ntowards carrying into execution the new commission of the peace. In\r\ncompliance with that charge, we find the governors return such accounts\r\nof the opposition of these admirals to the civil government, as are\r\nhardly to be credited but by those who have read what went before; and\r\nafter that it would be tiresome and nauseous to detail any more upon the\r\nsubject[57]. This contest continued for some years, till it was found\r\nthat no opposition could induce his majesty’s ministers to withdraw this\r\nsmall portion of civil government, which had not been granted till it\r\nhad been loudly called for by the necessities of the island. The fishing\r\nadmirals then became as quiet, and useless as before, and contented\r\nthemselves with minding their own business, in going backwards and\r\nforwards to the banks.\r\n\r\nWhile this question of the competition between the fishing admirals, and\r\nthe justices, was agitated, _Mr. Fane_ also was consulted, respecting\r\nthe distinct jurisdiction of these officers, and he agreed in opinion\r\nwith the attorney-general; he also at the same time delivered an opinion\r\nthat is worth remembering; namely, that all the statute laws made here,\r\nprevious to his majesty’s subjects settling in Newfoundland are in force\r\nthere; it being a settlement in an infidel country; but that as to the\r\nlaws passed here, subsequent to the settlement, he thought they would\r\nnot extend to that country, unless it was particularly noticed[58]. The\r\nquestion then will be, _when_ did this settlement take place? And it may\r\nbe urged, that the policy having all along been to prevent settlement,\r\nand that persons should resort thither only for the fishing season,\r\nthere is to this purpose a settlement commencing annually; and that\r\nin truth, British subjects carry with them the laws of this country,\r\nas often as they go thither; if so, all the law of England, as far as\r\nit is applicable to the state and circumstances of Newfoundland, is\r\nconstitutionally and legally of force there. This was a question of much\r\nimportance, but it has since been settled by the wording of the act of\r\nlast session for establishing a court there; which court is to determine\r\naccording to the law of England, as far as the same is applicable to the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A commission of oyer and terminer proposed.]\r\n\r\nNothing material appears respecting the civil government of\r\nNewfoundland, till the year 1737, when the board of trade listened to\r\nthe representation that had frequently been made by the governor, of\r\nthe inconvenience of sending over to England for trial, persons who had\r\ncommitted capital felonies. In such cases the witnesses were glad to keep\r\nout of the way; the felon was sent to England, without any person to\r\nprove his guilt; a great expence was incurred, justice was disappointed;\r\nor if the fact were proved, the poor witnesses was left to get back as\r\nthey could, with the expence of their voyage and residence, and the\r\ncertain loss of one season’s fishing.\r\n\r\nIt had been provided by stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. that such capital\r\nfelonies might be tried in any county in England; and in the commission\r\nof the peace lately given, this policy was so closely adhered to, that\r\nthe justices were therein restrained from proceeding _in cases of doubt\r\nand difficulty, such as robberies, murders, and felonies, and all other\r\ncapital offences_. It appeared to the board of trade that this scruple\r\nmight now be got over; and they proposed inserting in the commission\r\nthat was to be given to _Captain Vanbrugh_, a clause, authorising him\r\nto appoint _commissioners of Oyer and Terminer_; but the board wishing\r\nto be assured that the king’s prerogative was not restrained in this\r\nparticular, by the above provision in stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. they\r\nconsulted the attorney and solicitor general, who thought the king’s\r\npower was not abridged by that act. The board, in their representation\r\nto his majesty, state the example of a commission being granted to the\r\ncommodores with other persons, for trials of piracy, as a precedent\r\nfor trusting them with this authority to issue commissions for trying\r\nfelons; and that it was no more than was given to other governors of\r\nplantations. But they inform his majesty, that as this power might be\r\ntoo much to be entrusted in the hands of judges and juries very little\r\nskilled in such proceedings, they had added an article, which restrained\r\nthe governor from allowing more than one court of Oyer and Terminer in a\r\nyear, and that only when he was resident; and he was further instructed,\r\nnot to suffer any sentence to be executed, till report thereof be made to\r\nhis majesty[59]. But when the commission went before the privy council\r\nfor approbation, all that part which gave this authority was directed to\r\nbe left out; so fearful were they of trusting such authority to those in\r\nwhom they had lodged the civil government of the island[60].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Such Commission issued.]\r\n\r\nSo this point rested till the year 1750; when _Captain Rodney_, who was\r\nthen governor, pressed the secretary of state for such a power to be\r\ngranted. It was referred to the board of trade, where they recurred to\r\nwhat was projected in the year 1738 for _Captain Vanbrugh’s_ commission.\r\nA doubt arose with the board, whether this power might be given by\r\n_instruction_, or whether it must be inserted in the commission; and _Sir\r\nD. Ryder_, then attorney-general, being consulted, he was of opinion,\r\nthat such power could not be granted by instruction, nor any otherwise\r\nthan under the great seal; but that the manner of exercising such power\r\nmight be prescribed by instruction; he thought the clause drawn for the\r\ncommission of 1738 was sufficient, only that neither the power of trying,\r\nnor that of pardoning _treason_, should be entrusted with the governor,\r\nor any court erected by him. The commission issued accordingly, with this\r\nnew power, to _Captain Francis William Drake_[61].\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked of this commission of Oyer and Terminer, issued under\r\nthe new power given to the governor, that it has not been executed\r\nwithout some question being raised as to its legality. Persons, who were\r\nobstinately bent to believe there was no law in Newfoundland but stat.\r\n10 and 11 Will. 3. were disposed to doubt the power of the crown to give\r\nauthority for issuing this, as well as the commission of the peace. It\r\nhas been the interest and inclination of many at Newfoundland to contest\r\nevery thing that was not founded upon the same parliamentary authority\r\nas stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. But this spirit, whether of ignorance or\r\nwilfulness, has worn off, in a great measure, of late years, though\r\nit is occasionally at work even now. And it is to be lamented at this\r\nmoment, that the advice given by the board of trade in the year 1718,\r\nand afterwards on the occasion of establishing the civil government in\r\n1728, was not followed; and an act of parliament passed for remedying all\r\nthe abuses and irregularities at once, instead of resorting to the half\r\nmeasure that was then adopted, and which had all the difficulty we have\r\nseen to support itself.\r\n\r\nIf we are to judge from the dearth of matter in the books of the board of\r\ntrade, things went on very quietly at Newfoundland for several years. We\r\nonly find some scattered facts of no great importance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Baltimore revives his Claim.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1754, _Lord Baltimore_ laid in his claim to be put in\r\npossession of a large tract of land in the island, by the name of _the\r\nprovince of Avalon_, and of all the royal jurisdictions and prerogatives\r\nthereto belonging, and prayed that his majesty would approve _John\r\nBradstreet, Esq._ as governor thereof. This grant has been before\r\nmentioned[62]. A claim so important was referred by the board of trade to\r\nthe attorney and solicitor general; who, after inspection of such papers\r\nas were furnished by the board, and hearing what could be urged by Lord\r\nBaltimore, were of opinion, that as, notwithstanding the determination in\r\n1660 in favour of the grant in 1623, there was no evidence of any actual\r\npossession of the province, nor the exercise of any powers of government\r\nthere by the Baltimore family; as, on the contrary, it was most probable,\r\nthat, at least from 1638, they had been out of possession; as from the\r\nyear 1669 there had been many proceedings, which appeared from the books\r\nof the board of trade, and even an act of parliament passed in the 10 and\r\n11 Will. 3. inconsistent with the right now set up, without taking the\r\nleast notice thereof, and without any claim or interposition on the part\r\nof the Baltimore family; and as his majesty’s approbation of a governor\r\nought to be in consequence of a clear title of proprietorship, they were\r\nof opinion, his majesty should not comply with the petition. This opinion\r\nof the law officers seems to have been adopted by the board, and no more\r\nhas since been heard of the province of _Avalon_[63].\r\n\r\nThe board of trade in November 1758, shewed a disposition to take into\r\nconsideration the trade and fishery of Newfoundland, which were then said\r\n_to have declined of late years_. For the purpose of obtaining every\r\ninformation that could be derived from those experienced and interested\r\nin the question, they directed letters to be written to the towns in\r\nthe west; but they received for answer nothing but such matter as had\r\nrelation to the inconveniences resulting to the trade from a state of\r\nwar; and the only remedies proposed were a due regulation of convoys, and\r\nthat seamen employed in that trade should not be subject to pressing[64].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Peace 1763.]\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the peace in 1763, a more favourable opportunity\r\nseemed to present itself for doing something towards the encouragement\r\nof the fishery. Upon this occasion, as upon former ones, when this\r\nsubject was under deliberation, the board of trade called upon the\r\nwestern towns for advice and information; and now they joined to them\r\nsuch towns in _Ireland_ and _Scotland_ as had lately engaged in that\r\ntrade; namely, _Cork_, _Waterford_, _Belfast_, and _Glasgow_.[65]\r\n\r\nThe French turned their attention to the arrangements to be made in their\r\nown fishery, in consequence of the peace. The French ambassador presented\r\nto our court a project of arrangement, to be reciprocally agreed upon\r\nbetween the two crowns, for avoiding disturbance and dispute between the\r\nEnglish and French in carrying on the concurrent fishery. This matter\r\ncame before the board of trade, who referred it to _Sir George Hay_,\r\nthe king’s advocate, and _Sir Fletcher Norton_, and _Mr. de Grey_, the\r\nattorney and solicitor general, for their opinion, whether the project\r\nwas consistent with stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3.? and whether the crown\r\ncould legally enter into, and had power to enforce such regulations,\r\nso far as they related to the subjects of Great Britain? To which they\r\nanswered, that the project contained many things contrary to the act, as\r\nwell in respect of the rights of the king’s subjects, as to the mode of\r\ndetermining controversies arising there; and that the crown had no power\r\nto enter into, or enforce such regulations[66].\r\n\r\nIt was, however, thought proper to draw up some _additional instructions_\r\nto the governor, with a view of preventing any interruption or\r\ndisturbance being given by the English to the French in carrying on their\r\nfishery within the limits appointed by treaty. These were also submitted\r\nto the same law-officers for their opinion as to the statute, and the\r\npower in the king to make them. The law-officers made some alterations\r\nin these instructions, and declared, that in such form they might be\r\nlegally given to the governor, being conformable with the thirteenth\r\narticle of the treaty of Utrecht, and not repugnant to the statute.\r\nFor, say they, although the statute seems to confine the whole trade of\r\nNewfoundland to English subjects; yet as the French were at the time of\r\npassing the act, and had been for many years before, in possession of\r\nseveral parts of the island, and notoriously carried on an open fishery,\r\nand claimed to be entitled thereto; and as that claim, and the exercise\r\nof a fishery there, had not been rejected or disallowed by the treaty of\r\n1686, nor by the treaty of _Ryswick_ in 1697, although several petitions\r\nof merchants and others had been presented to the house of commons in the\r\nyear 1696, complaining of encroachments of the French upon the English\r\ntrade and fishery there; it seemed to them, that the statute was not\r\nmeant to extend to such parts of the island, and its adjacent isles\r\nand places, as were then left in the possession of the French; nor to\r\nabridge or restrain the power of the crown over the same, consequential\r\nupon the making of peace; the exercise of which, in this instance, had\r\nreceived the repeated approbation of both houses of parliament in their\r\nresolutions upon the treaties of _Utrecht_ and _Paris_[67].\r\n\r\nThe board of trade adopted the amendments made by the law-officers,\r\nand recommended to his majesty the instructions so altered to be given\r\nin charge to _Mr. Palliser_, then governor of Newfoundland. They took\r\noccasion, in their representation at that time, to enlarge upon the\r\nnature of that trade.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remarks of the Board on Stat. 10 and 11 W. 3.]\r\n\r\nThey said, that in framing these additional instructions, it became\r\nnecessary to consider, with the closest attention, the provisions and\r\nregulations of stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3.; which act, having been framed\r\nand passed at a time when the crowns of Great Britain and France had\r\ndistinct rights and possessions on that island, and the subjects of both\r\ncarried on distinct fisheries upon those parts of the coasts, which\r\nbelonged to each respectively, was, they humbly conceived, in no respect\r\nproperly applicable to the permissive fishery, which the subjects of\r\nFrance were entitled by treaty to carry on in common with the English\r\nsubjects within the limits described; although, being an act in full\r\nforce, they had found themselves under the necessity, in framing these\r\nadditional instructions, to conform to the regulations and provisions\r\nof it, in many points, which did, in their opinion, render those\r\ninstructions less effectual and extensive than they might otherwise have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nBut independent of this objection to the act, they conceived it highly\r\nexceptionable in almost every other light in which it could be viewed.\r\nThe regulations intended for the fishery were in general by no means\r\napplicable to the present state of it, and such of them as might be\r\nof use were not enforced by proper penalties. And, considered as a\r\nregulation of government and civil jurisdiction, this act, they said, was\r\nthe most loose and imperfect that could have been framed, and necessity\r\nhad already introduced deviations from it in many essential points.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into the particular regulations of the act, and\r\nconsidering only its principal imperfection, namely, the fishery of the\r\nisland being altogether changed and varied from what it was, when the\r\nact was passed, it appeared to them to be disgraceful to suffer it to\r\nremain in the statute-book. But as they feared it was too late in that\r\nsession to enter upon any new parliamentary regulations, the further\r\nconsideration must be deferred for the present, unless his majesty should\r\nbe of opinion that a repeal of the act should be moved for, and a short\r\nlaw enacted, impowering the king, by proclamation, order in council,\r\nor instruction to the governor, to make such regulations with respect\r\nto this branch of commerce, as he should, with the advice of his privy\r\ncouncil, judge most expedient[68].\r\n\r\nBut nothing was done towards correcting or repealing an act that had been\r\ncondemned so often by public and private opinions of persons best able to\r\njudge of its merits.\r\n\r\nThe attention of government was now occupied by the questions which the\r\nlate treaty had brought forward. The French court, more anxious than ever\r\nfor the interests of their fishery, had started a doubt about the limits\r\nat Newfoundland, which drew on a long discussion at the board of trade.\r\nIt had been intimated in the before-mentioned project of arrangement, and\r\nwas afterwards pressed in a special memorial from the French ambassador,\r\nthat _Point Riche_, mentioned in the treaty of Utrecht, was the same as\r\n_Cape Ray_; and that the French limits on that side should, therefore,\r\nbe extended as low as _Cape Ray_. This piece of geography was, on their\r\npart, founded on no better authority than a map of _Herman Moll_; and\r\nwas shewn, by the board of trade in a representation, drawn with great\r\naccuracy and much at length, to be without any foundation. In this report\r\nof the board, it is demonstrated that all the French geographers united\r\nwith those of England in assigning different places to _Point Riche_ and\r\n_Cape Ray_, and that the wording of several public papers and documents,\r\nmade it beyond all doubt the clear intention of both nations, that the\r\nFrench limits should end at _Point Riche_, and should not come down\r\nso low as _Cape Ray_, confining the French to the limit called _Petit\r\nNord_[69].\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the French at this time gave great uneasiness. At\r\nthe close of this year, the board of trade made a representation to\r\nhis majesty, respecting several ships of war being sent by the French\r\nto _St. Pierre_ and _Miquelon_, which had been ceded to them by the\r\npeace; these, it was supposed, were sent thither, with a view to a sudden\r\nrupture, or at least to give improper countenance and hopes to the French\r\nin those parts; at any rate such a measure was considered as contrary\r\nto the treaty, by which those places were ceded merely as a shelter\r\nto the French fishermen[70]. It was feared a fishery was meant to be\r\nforced there out of the French limits, and an illicit trade carried on\r\nwith the Indians. The ruinous state of our forts and fortifications in\r\nNewfoundland made these appearances the more alarming. It was therefore,\r\nrecommended to put the forts upon a respectable footing[71].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Representation 1765.]\r\n\r\nThe board still kept in view the improvement of the advantages obtained\r\nfor the fisheries in those parts, amongst which that of Newfoundland\r\nwas the chief; and on the 29th of April 1765, they made a second\r\nrepresentation to his majesty, more full than either of the former; and\r\nfor those who wish to be informed of the nature of this trade, a very fit\r\ncompanion to the representation made in the year 1718. This was followed\r\nby a third, dated the 27th of March 1766, which also deserves particular\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAmong other improvements meditated for Newfoundland, it was resolved to\r\nestablish custom-house officers. The commissioners of the customs, in\r\nMarch and May 1764, issued out deputations constituting a collector and\r\ncontroller of the customs at Newfoundland. We find that _Captain Byng_\r\nhad, in the year 1743, appointed a naval officer as a necessary assistant\r\nto him, in checking the illicit trade there carried on. It does not\r\nappear whether this appointment was continued by his successors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Newfoundland a plantation.]\r\n\r\nA seizure was made about this time at Newfoundland of a ship, for\r\nwant of a register; it appeared to the commissioners of the customs\r\nthat Newfoundland had hitherto been looked upon merely in the light\r\nof _a fishery_, and vessels going thither were not thought liable to\r\nthe same regulations, as those going to the other British colonies\r\nand plantations: they now applied to the treasury for advice on this\r\npoint[72]; and the treasury referred it to the board of trade for their\r\nopinion; who report, that they saw no reason to doubt its being a part\r\nof his majesty’s plantations, and they thought its commerce, and the\r\nships bound thither, should be under the same regulations as in the other\r\nplantations: their lordships further thought, that as the governor had\r\nsuspected that many foreigners were sharers in the fishery and commerce\r\nof that island, and had made seizure of three ships, in two of which it\r\nclearly appeared that Spaniards were concerned, it was highly expedient\r\nand necessary, that the laws of navigation should be carried into\r\nexecution there[73].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Custom-house established.]\r\n\r\nThus by the establishment of a custom-house, and the introduction of the\r\nlaws of navigation, was another pillar added to the civil government\r\nof that place. But this was considered and treated as an innovation by\r\nthose who clamoured for a free fishery, and Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3. and\r\nthis institution being effected without the authority of parliament,\r\nwas questioned in the same manner, and upon the same ground, as the\r\ncommissioners of the peace, and of oyer and terminer. The article of\r\nfees was a topic on which a complaint might be founded with most hopes\r\nof success, where the interests of a fishery were concerned. This the\r\nmerchants pushed with petitions and memorials for some time without\r\nprevailing: and the fees of the custom-house are a cause of complaint to\r\nthis very day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Property in flakes, &c. discussed.]\r\n\r\nThe activity of _Mr. Palliser_ during his government, had contributed to\r\nbring forward the old debated question of property in flakes and stages.\r\nThese questions were of different sorts, the first related to the parts\r\nbetween _Bonavista_ and _Point Riche_, the two limits of the French\r\nfishery. Many tracts of land within those limits were claimed as private\r\nproperty; and, as such, might interfere with the concurrent right of the\r\nFrench to fish there. This matter was agitated at the board of trade,\r\nand an additional instruction upon that head was given to the governor,\r\nby which he was commanded, not upon any pretence whatsoever, to allow any\r\n_exclusive possession_ to be taken, as private property, of any lands,\r\nrivers, or islands in the northern parts, between _Bonavista_ and _Point\r\nRiche_; taking special care that such ships as resorted to that part,\r\nshould chuse their stations as they arrived, and should take up, and\r\noccupy, subject to the governor’s controul, such space only of beach as\r\nwas proportioned to the number of their boats, conformable to Stat. 10 &\r\n11 Will. 3[74].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Justices appointed.]\r\n\r\nThis provision was with a design of preserving peace between the\r\nfishermen of the two nations. But the exclusive property which some\r\npersons claimed in stages, flakes, and beach, was a question that applied\r\nto the whole of the island; and had become of a magnitude to call for\r\nsome discussion and adjustment. The board of trade thought proper to\r\nconsult _Mr. Yorke_, then attorney general, upon this point. They\r\nproposed to him two questions; first, Whether exclusive property in\r\nany part of Newfoundland can be acquired under colour of any provision\r\nof Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3, without a grant or patent from the crown?\r\nsecondly, If any part of that act does warrant such exclusive property,\r\nwhat is the nature and extent of it? Can it be acquired for the purposes\r\nof cultivation, and settlement of the land, or is it confined to the\r\npurposes of fishing; and in what manner, and upon what principles, and by\r\nwhom are any disputes arising thereupon to be decided?\r\n\r\nBy the answer to these queries, it was hoped to obtain some clear\r\njudgment upon these points, for the direction of the governors; who\r\nhad sometimes considered this as real, sometimes as personal property,\r\nat other times as no property at all; and were involved in great\r\ndifficulties, and exposed to vexatious suits for what they had done\r\nat Newfoundland, in relation to this doubtful sort of occupation and\r\npossession. But I do not find that these questions were resolved by\r\nthe attorney-general, or that the board pressed him for any answer to\r\nthem[75]. So that these points remained for examination in after-times.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Palliser_ carried into execution upon the coast of _Labrador_\r\n(which by proclamation, the 7th of October 1763, had been separated from\r\n_Canada_, and annexed to the government of Newfoundland) that plan of a\r\nfree fishery, to be carried on by ships from Great Britain, which was\r\npractised at Newfoundland, and which he had shewn himself so determined\r\nto maintain upon its original principles. In order to accomplish this\r\nhe had contest with exclusive property. Several persons claimed on that\r\ncoast a property in fishing-posts and settlements; some under grants\r\nfrom the French governors of _Canada_; some from _General Murray_. These\r\nhe broke in upon, and withal he treated the American subjects of Great\r\nBritain, who were concerned in some of these settlements, as excluded\r\nfrom this fishery, by Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3. which statute he held\r\nto apply to _Labrador_, now it was brought within the government of\r\nNewfoundland, and under the authority thereof he contested the private\r\nrights set up on that coast. To give effect to these principles, he made\r\nsome _rules and regulations_ for carrying on the fishery in those parts.\r\n\r\nThese novelties caused many complaints to be brought before the board\r\nof trade, which led to very long enquiry for three or four years, at\r\ndifferent times.\r\n\r\nUpon these questions, the board of trade took some measures; with regard\r\nto the Americans, they were of opinion that it was not the design of the\r\nStat. 10 & 11 Will. 3. to exclude from the fishery ships fitted out from\r\nAmerica. With regard to the other points which turned upon considerations\r\nof property and legal topics, they referred to the attorney and solicitor\r\ngeneral, some cases of grants from French governors. Upon view of these\r\ncases, the law officers were of opinion, that these could not be allowed\r\nas valid in any judicial enquiry, and ought not to stand in the way of\r\nany rules, or regulations to be made in the government of that coast[76].\r\n\r\nSome time after, it appeared to the board, that the forcing of these\r\nrules and regulations, in order to throw open the fishery there to\r\nadventurers from Great Britain, was not a wise policy. They were\r\ncalculated only for a cod, or whale fishery, whereas the seal fishery,\r\nwhich was most pursued here, was a _sedentary fishery_, and needed\r\nthe encouragement of exclusive property, to support the expence of\r\nthe adventure. They therefore, on the 24th of June 1772, recommended\r\nto his majesty that the coast of _Labradore_ should be re-annexed to\r\nthe government of _Quebec_[77]. This would certainly put an end to the\r\ndisquietude under which persons laboured, who had private property there,\r\nwhich they saw exposed to the operation of Stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3. This,\r\nhowever, does not seem to have been the reason for the board recommending\r\nsuch measure; for being called upon to reconsider their opinion as to the\r\nre-annexing of the coast of _Labradore_ to the government of _Quebec_;\r\nthey said, that it was not in consideration of the loss which individuals\r\nwould sustain, if private property was disturbed, but they said, when\r\nit appeared to them that a great part of that coast was claimed as\r\nprivate property, under grants from the governors of _Canada_; and that\r\nhis majesty was bound by treaty to admit those claims; they thought he\r\ncould not in justice enforce regulations that were subversive of those\r\nrights[78]. According to the principle here laid down, the _Quebec act_\r\nStat. 14, Geo. 3, c. 83, annexed to that government all such territories,\r\nislands, and countries as had, since the 10th February 1763, been part of\r\nthe government of Newfoundland, and they were so to continue during his\r\nmajesty’s pleasure[79].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Stat. 15, Geo. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe last measure taken respecting Newfoundland, during this period, was\r\npassing Stat. 15, Geo. 3, c. 31, commonly called in the island, _Sir Hugh\r\nPalliser’s act_; it being supposed to have originated from the advice and\r\nassistance, principally, of that gentleman. The design of this act was\r\nto favour, and keep alive, the principle of a ship-fishery carried on\r\nfrom England: one of the regulations of it, was to enforce the payment\r\nof wages, another to secure the return of seamen, and fisherman to this\r\ncountry; the provisions of it are all enforced by a special penalty, the\r\nwant of which in Stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. had been so often lamented.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the provisions of this act, and the rigour with which it\r\nwas easy to enforce them, contributed to make this law very unpopular in\r\nthe island; and after all the alterations that had been made, without the\r\naid of parliament, since Stat. 10 & II Will. 3. none was so ill received\r\nas this; but, being an act of the legislature, it was submitted to with\r\nsilent discontent. When persons concerned in this trade complain of the\r\ninnovations made of late years in the trade of Newfoundland, and express\r\na wish to be put on the footing of Stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3, they mean,\r\nthat they wish to be relieved from this act of parliament; and they\r\nhave, many of them, no scruple to say, that since _Sir Hugh Palliser’s\r\nact_, it is with the greatest difficulty that merchants can carry on the\r\nfishery with profit to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe regulations made by this act were very important. It was now\r\ndeclared, that the privilege of drying fish on the shores of\r\nNewfoundland, should be enjoyed only by his majesty’s subjects arriving\r\nat Newfoundland from Great Britain, or one of the British dominions in\r\nEurope; which settled the question that had been raised in favour of the\r\ncolonists. This act gave several bounties for encouraging industry in\r\nthe take of fish. It provided for securing the return of the seamen to\r\nEurope; by empowering the master to detain, out of their wages, forty\r\nshillings for paying their passage home; and obliging him to see his\r\nmen put on board passage-vessels. It forbad masters to suffer seamen to\r\ntake up more than half their wages in articles of supply; and obliged\r\nthem to pay the other half in cash, or good bills on England or Ireland.\r\nIt gave to the seamen a lien on the fish, and oil for their wages;\r\nand, to secure the execution of this act, penalties were annexed to the\r\nvarious provisions, and a jurisdiction given to the court of session, and\r\nvice-admiralty to enforce those penalties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PART IV.\r\n\r\nFrom Stat. 15, Geo. 3, to A. D. 1793.]\r\n\r\n    _Import of live Stock, ~&c.~—Representation on a Bill brought\r\n    in by the Western Merchants—Three Acts passed—Complaints\r\n    about Courts—Review of the Courts at Newfoundland—Fishing\r\n    Admirals—Surrogates—The Governor holds a Court—Courts of\r\n    Vice-Admiralty and Sessions—The Governors cease to hold\r\n    Courts—Court of Common Pleas instituted—Complaints against\r\n    it—Representation—An Act passed for a Court of Civil\r\n    Jurisdiction._\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last five or six years that the board of trade continued in\r\nexistence, there appears nothing of importance upon the books respecting\r\nthis trade and fishery. That board was abolished in 1782. It was not till\r\nJune 1784, that a committee of council was appointed by his majesty for\r\nmatters of trade and plantations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Import of live Stock, &c.]\r\n\r\nIn this interval, the war had determined, and the independence of the\r\nUnited States of America had produced, a new position of affairs in that\r\npart of the world, by which Newfoundland was affected, as well as the\r\nother parts of his majesty’s territories in America. One of the first\r\nquestions that was occasioned by this revolution was, the supply of\r\nprovisions for Newfoundland and the fishery. These had before the war,\r\ncome in a great measure from the Colonies that were now separated; and\r\nbefore the new situation of things was quite understood, this supply, it\r\nwas thought, might still be occasionally permitted, and, in a case of\r\ndistress, had actually been resorted to. The western merchants took alarm\r\nat the appearance of an intercourse being allowed between the United\r\nStates and their fishery; they presented memorials to have a stop put\r\nto it; they alledged the place might be supplied from _Great Britain_\r\nor _Canada_. The allegations on both sides, of those who argued for a\r\nsupply, under certain limitations, from the United States, and of those\r\nwho were wholly against this intercourse, led to long examination of\r\nwitnesses, and various considerations of policy, before the lords of the\r\ncommittee[80]. This ended in the committee resolving, in January 1785,\r\nto recommend to his majesty, that a permission should be given to import\r\nbread, flour, and live stock, in British bottoms, which ships should\r\nclear out from the king’s dominions in Europe, with a licence from the\r\ncommissioners of the customs, which should be in force for seven months.\r\nAs this licence was to be for seven months, and the temporary act for\r\nregulating the intercourse with the United States would expire in less\r\ntime, it was suggested by the attorney and solicitor general, whether\r\nit might not be better to pass a special act for this purpose[81]. The\r\ncommittee accordingly recommended to his majesty, that a bill to that\r\neffect should be proposed in parliament, but that it should be in force\r\nfor that season only[82]. Such an act was accordingly passed; namely,\r\nstat. 26 Geo. 3. C.I. The same question was revived the following year;\r\nwhen it was considered whether the act should be renewed. Examinations in\r\nlike manner were had; in which the merchants declared, they were of the\r\nsame opinion as they had been last year; but that they had rather the\r\nbill of last year should be renewed, than the trade between Newfoundland\r\nand the United States should be laid intirely open[83]. The committee\r\ncame to the resolution, that the act should be renewed[84].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Representation on a Bill brought in by the Western Merchants.]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the encouragement of the fishery had come under the\r\nconsideration of the committee—A bill had been brought into the house\r\nof commons at the instance of the western merchants; in this bill it\r\nwas intended to make several alterations in the law of Newfoundland;\r\nthe principal points of which were, to give the present possessors\r\na permanent interest in their lands, and to repeal some material\r\nregulations of stat. 15 Geo. 3. which the merchants had always disliked.\r\n\r\nOn 9th December 1785, his majesty was pleased to refer the matter of\r\nthis bill to the committee for them to consider it, and to report their\r\nopinion thereon. This bill was read at the board on the 14th of January\r\n1786, and every provision of it was separately discussed. The subject\r\nof the fishery was under consideration for several weeks[85]. At length\r\nthe committee made a report on the intended bill. This report contains\r\ntheir opinion upon most of the points relating to Newfoundland, and is\r\ntherefore well deserving of notice. It has been laid before the house of\r\ncommons, and is now in print. The report was unfavourable to the bill,\r\nwhich was accordingly laid aside[86]. However, another was introduced,\r\nand passed into a law, and is stat. 26 Geo. 3. c. 26. This act continued\r\nthe bounties given by stat. 15 Geo. 3. and contributed to render more\r\ncomplete the plan begun by that statute, for preventing the seamen and\r\nfishermen withdrawing themselves from this country, either by staying at\r\nNewfoundland, or deserting to other places.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1788, the intercourse between the United States and\r\nNewfoundland was again agitated; and upon the strong representations of\r\nthe _Quebec_ merchants, the committee were of opinion for proposing a\r\nbill to parliament, to prevent entirely the supply of bread, flour, and\r\nlive stock, from the United States; but, at the instance of the western\r\nmerchants, this intention was dropt[87]. The following year the mode of\r\noccasional supply was continued, at the desire of the western merchants,\r\nand so it has gone on ever since by authority of stat. 28 Geo. 3. c. 6.\r\ns. 13.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two acts passed.]\r\n\r\nIn this and the following sessions two acts of parliament were passed\r\nrespecting Newfoundland. By stat. 28 Geo. 3. c. 35. his majesty\r\nwas enabled to make some regulations at Newfoundland, to prevent\r\ninconveniencies that might arise from the competition of the English and\r\nthe French in the fishery. By stat. 29 Geo. 3. c. 53. it is declared,\r\nthat fish, not caught by subjects of Great Britain going from the British\r\ndominions in Europe, may not be landed or dried at Newfoundland. This\r\nlast act was occasioned by the people of _Bermuda_ having engaged in the\r\nfishery, and selling their fish to those who had a clear right to dry\r\nand cure on the island; by this provision the design of stat. 15 Geo. 3.\r\nc. 31. in confining the fishery to ships going from Europe, was fully\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complaints about courts.]\r\n\r\nA new subject of complaint had grown up in Newfoundland—this was the\r\nhearing and determining of _civil causes_. Among all the grievances, and\r\nthe expedients for remedying them, during the tract of time we have gone\r\nthrough, there seems to have been no solicitude or attempt to provide\r\n_a court of civil jurisdiction_. While this place continued merely a\r\nfishery, the causes of action between parties were simple and of less\r\nmagnitude; but of late years the population had encreased, and among\r\nthe persons resident there were dealings of a mercantile nature to a\r\ngreat extent, and of a sort to need a judicature, that would command\r\nmore confidence than any of the old establishments had been thought\r\nentitled to. There arose therefore, from time to time, discontents upon\r\nthis head, and these led to measures that ended in making an intire\r\nnew establishment of a court. To make this subject more intelligible,\r\nwe should look back to the courts that had hitherto been known at\r\nNewfoundland, the nature and jurisdiction of which were brought under\r\nconsideration at this time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Review of the Courts of Newfoundland.]\r\n\r\nThe first regulation that looked at all like a court, was the authority\r\ngiven by stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3. c. 25. s. 15. to the fishing admirals,\r\nto hear and determine controversies and differences between the masters\r\nof fishing ships, and the inhabitants, or any bye boat-keeper, concerning\r\nthe right and property of fishing rooms, stages, flakes, or any other\r\nbuildings or conveniency for fishing or curing fish; and if either party\r\nthought himself aggrieved, he might appeal to the commander of any of the\r\nking’s ships belonging to the convoy. This was a civil judicature of a\r\nlimited sort—the _adventurers_ or _merchants_, it should seem, were not\r\nliable to it; it was confined also in its object; _debts_ still remained\r\nwithout any mode of recovery, as well as all other personal wrongs of a\r\ncivil nature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fishing Admirals]\r\n\r\nAnother jurisdiction was given to the fishing admirals by this act: by\r\nsect. 14 they were to see the rules and orders contained in that act\r\nconcerning the regulation of the fishery duly put in execution; and\r\nthis was given them, as the act expresses it, _to preserve peace and\r\ngood government among the_ SEAMEN _and_ FISHERMEN, _as well in their\r\nrespective harbours, as on the shore_. This was a sort of police invested\r\nin them, which might be considered as partaking both of a civil and\r\ncriminal authority. But this also, like the former, was limited as to\r\nthe persons; no authority was given that could be exercised over the\r\nmerchants and adventurers, who seem to be considered by this act as\r\npersons who might have right done them; but against whom it was not\r\nnecessary to do any justice whatsoever—for, by the rules and orders\r\nof this act, the fishing admirals would be obliged to see they had\r\nships-room; and their seamen and fishermen would be kept quiet and\r\nunder controul; but if these adventurers had taken possession of any\r\n_fishing rooms, stages, flakes, or other conveniency for the fishery_,\r\nthe admirals had no jurisdiction to call them to account, and to make\r\nrestitution to the right owner, their jurisdiction in that particular\r\nbeing confined to the _masters of fishing ships, inhabitants, and bye\r\nboat-keepers_.\r\n\r\nThe merchants and adventurers being therefore subjected by this act to\r\nno controul or authority whatsoever, when they begun to settle, and to\r\nhave mercantile dealings, to a great amount, they had nothing to do but\r\nto take the law into their own hands; and having possessed themselves\r\nof plantations or fish, or any thing else, in payment of debts, real\r\nor pretended, there subsisted, under this act, no power whatsoever\r\nto call them to account; and it was, no doubt, for this reason, that\r\nthe merchants have so constantly adhered to the support of this act,\r\ndeclaring that a free fishery, conducted under the policy of this act,\r\nwas all they wanted, and complaining that every regulation made since\r\nthat act has invariably operated to injure the trade and fishery. It\r\nwas indeed the policy of this country to support a free fishery there,\r\nfor ships going from hence, and to prevent settlement. So far the views\r\nof the government and the interest of the merchants concurred; but the\r\napplication of this principle had the effect of leaving the island to\r\nthe mercy of the adventurers, who found it their interest at length\r\neven to promote _settlement_ to a certain degree; contrary to their own\r\ndeclarations, and to the policy of stat. 10 & 11 Will. 3.; for no part\r\nof which they seem to have had any value, but the feeble judicature and\r\npolice it gave the island; in consequence of which, they saw the whole\r\nfishery abandoned to their sole will and pleasure.\r\n\r\nThese observations upon the incomplete form of this judicature and\r\npolice, suggest themselves upon the bare reading of the act; but the\r\nexperience of the manner in which it was executed, shewed all this in a\r\nmore aggravated appearance. It has been too often repeated in the course\r\nof this historical enquiry to need repetition here, that the admirals\r\nwere the servants of the merchants, inasmuch as they were the masters\r\nof some of their ships; that in many cases, therefore, justice was not\r\nto be expected from them; that is, in cases where their owners were\r\nconcerned. In many others, where their owners or themselves were not\r\nconcerned, there was always a partiality towards the description and\r\nclass of persons with which they were connected; and a poor planter, or\r\ninhabitant, (who was considered as little better than a law-breaker in\r\nbeing such) had but small chance of justice, in opposition to any great\r\nwest-country merchant. This bias must have been a strong impediment to\r\nthe equal administration of justice in the hands of the fishing admirals.\r\nBesides this which arose from their employment and connection, there was\r\nanother disqualification, that was to be corrected by no integrity or\r\nfairness whatsoever. It should seem, that persons, educated as masters\r\nof merchant ships, could not in general possess that discrimination and\r\ndiscernment, which was necessary for determining right and property, even\r\nin fishing stages and flakes.\r\n\r\nSuch being the judicature established by the statute of King William,\r\nand such the hands in which it was lodged, we have found, that it was\r\nexecuted fully as ill as could from the nature of it be expected. We\r\nfind that the admirals were most of their time out on the fishery; that,\r\nwhen in harbour, they were still employed about curing of their fish,\r\nand the other parts of their business; that the commanders of the king’s\r\nships were obliged to summon, enjoin, and enforce them to hold courts;\r\nthat discovering the sluggishness of the admirals, they were under the\r\nnecessity of taking liberties not given by the statute; that, being only\r\na court of appeal, they were obliged to erect themselves into an original\r\ncourt. This they did by degrees, and with a sort of deference to the\r\nprovisions of the act of parliament. At first they got the admirals to\r\nsit with them; and I have seen many judgments and proceedings to which\r\nthe commander of some of the king’s ships has first subscribed his name,\r\nand the admirals have added theirs. It is not to be wondered, that the\r\ncommanders of the king’s ships, with their superior endowments, should\r\ngradually obtain an ascendancy; and having thus blended their appellate\r\njurisdiction with the original one lodged in the admirals, should at\r\nlength wholly dispense with their attendance of the fishing admirals (who\r\nwould be glad enough to be excused), and so in time succeed to a complete\r\noriginal exercise of judicial authority in the place of the admirals.\r\n\r\nSo indeed it happened. But there were not wanting occasions, when\r\nthe admirals awaked from their lethargy, and shewed a steadiness in\r\nasserting the dormant powers lodged in them by the statute. These were\r\nwhen the adventurers and merchants perceived the government at home were\r\nmaking any attempt to introduce a better system of law and order into\r\nNewfoundland. Accordingly, we have seen, that upon the appointment of\r\na civil governor and justices, in the year 1729, the admirals bestirred\r\nthemselves; and, from the impulse which the competition inspired for the\r\nmoment, they actually took upon them all the authority they possessed\r\nunder the statute. They even went further, and claimed a criminal as\r\nwell as a civil judicature; and proceeded to issue warrants, and do acts\r\nwhich belong to justices of the peace. In these usurpations they were\r\nsupported by the western merchants, whose language it was to represent\r\nthe provisions of stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3 as competent to the complete\r\ngovernment of the island in all matters, both civil and criminal.\r\n\r\nBut with all this support, so limited a power, lodged in such feeble\r\nhands, could not sustain the contest; and the admirals soon fell back\r\ninto the inactivity, neglect, and contempt, where they had before\r\nslumbered. As they sunk, the commanders of the king’s ships rose into\r\nimportance; the statute of William grew to be looked upon as a dead\r\nletter; and the administration of justice, in all the points there\r\nconferred on the admirals, was expected from nobody but the commanders\r\nof the king’s ships, when they came to the island in the summer season.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Surrogates.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the hearing of certain matters, by way of _appeal_, was given\r\nto the commanders by the statute, yet the hearing of them _originally_\r\nwas not authorized. The possession of the former gave a colour for\r\nassuming the latter; and crude as this may seem, it was, perhaps, as\r\nwell warranted as some of the instances of jurisdiction now exercised,\r\nand from long usage allowed to the first courts in Westminster-hall.\r\nWhen the captains were in possession of this, they proceeded, as happens\r\nmostly in the exercise of power and authority; they found in that place,\r\nas it is elsewhere, that all judges have the quality which is invariably\r\nsupposed to belong to the best, that of enlarging the sphere of their\r\ncognizance[88]: and we find very soon, that the captains of ships took\r\ncognizance of _debts_ contracted; and held courts, in which they enquired\r\nof, heard, and determined all possible causes of complaints; and with\r\nno other lights than those furnished by the statute of _William_, the\r\ninstructions from the governor, and the suggestions of their own good\r\nsense; paying always a due regard to the customs and usages of the\r\ncountry. They did every thing, that the fishing admirals might do, and\r\nevery thing the admirals had at different times pretended to have a\r\nright to do. From their situation, and the support they received from\r\nthe governor, they were enabled to maintain the jurisdiction they had\r\nassumed. The governor conferred on them the title of _surrogates_, an\r\nidea taken from the admiralty-law; to which, and which alone the naval\r\ngovernors were in the habit of looking, and under which it had long\r\nbeen a notion, that the fishery, as an admiralty concern, ought to be\r\nregulated. A _surrogate_ is well known in Newfoundland, as legally\r\ndeputed by the governor, to act as his deputy. Under this character the\r\nauthority of the governor was exercised very beneficially. The time of\r\n_surrogating_ was looked forward to as a season when all wrongs were to\r\nbe redressed against all oppressors; and this naval judicature was flown\r\nto by the poor inhabitants and planters, as the only refuge they had from\r\nthe west country merchants, who were always their creditors, and were\r\ngenerally regarded as their oppressors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The governor holds a court.]\r\n\r\nWhile the _surrogates_ in the different parts of the island were\r\nadministering justice in this manner, the _governor_ had also his court\r\nat _St. John’s_; and, it is easy to believe, that every thing which the\r\nsurrogates permitted to themselves, the governor thought himself equally\r\nentitled to do and command. Every matter, civil, and criminal, used to\r\nbe heard, and determined in open court before the governor. Where no\r\nspecial direction was pointed out by law, a person in that situation\r\nwas to be commended for striking out such a course as the exigency of\r\nthe situation, and the good of the place required. This desire of doing\r\ngood sometimes carried the governors further than strict legal propriety\r\ncould warrant. They used to preside in the sessions of justices, although\r\nit was from their authority that the commission of the justices issued.\r\nIt would be endless and unnecessary to enter into the instances of\r\nirregularity that must follow, when judicatures were instituted in such\r\na place as this, by persons who had nothing for their guide but the\r\nrectitude of their intentions, and a very honourable disposition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Courts of vice-admiralty and session.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1765, a custom-house being established at _St. John’s_,\r\na court of vice-admiralty, (the court of revenue in the plantations)\r\nwas placed there. This court, in the absence of the governor, during\r\nthe winter, had entertained complaints in other matters than those\r\npeculiarly belonging to it. In this it only followed the example of\r\nthe _court of sessions_, where the justices had allowed the hearing of\r\nmatters of _debt_, and other subjects of difference of a civil nature.\r\nIt was in consequence of this usage, that the parliament afterwards\r\nconferred on the court of vice-admiralty, and the session, a jurisdiction\r\nof a civil nature. By Stat. 15, Geo. 3, c. 32. they have authority to\r\ndetermine disputes concerning the wages of seamen and fishermen, and the\r\noffences committed by their hirers and employers against that act. This\r\njurisdiction was taken from the court of vice-admiralty, by Stat. 26,\r\nGeo. 3, c. 26, owing to the unfavourable impressions that had been made\r\nrespecting the practice which had prevailed in that court.\r\n\r\nAlthough the parliament took away from the vice-admiralty court the\r\nauthority vested in it by law, it still continued to exercise that\r\nwhich no law had conferred on it; and both that court and the sessions\r\nwere resorted to in the absence of the governor and surrogates, for\r\nthe administration of justice in all civil cases whatsoever. Justice\r\nadministered under such circumstances could have but little of the\r\nauthority and effect, which should attend upon the sentence of a court.\r\nThere was no doubt in the minds of any, above the very lowest class,\r\nbut the whole of this judicature was an usurpation: it was, therefore,\r\nmore frequently employed as an engine of authority, to obtain that by a\r\ncourse of law, which could not, perhaps, be attained by open violence,\r\nthan as the means of protecting the weak against the powerful. A merchant\r\nrather chose to have the assistance of the court of session or admiralty,\r\nto attach and seize the effects of his debtor, than incur the odium of\r\ntaking them with force. The appearance of a legal course was preferable.\r\nBut should a wealthy merchant become defendant in one of these courts,\r\nit was not so sure that he would approve the same legal course, or yield\r\nthe same obedience to a sentence. He, as well as the court knew, there\r\nwas no legal authority to compel; and it was a question of prudence\r\nonly, whether such a defendant would submit quietly to their order. If\r\nthe court happened to have in it persons who acted with vigour, and had\r\ncharacter and influence sufficient to cause its decrees to be duely\r\nexecuted; it would, in such case, be but a bad prospect for a merchant\r\nto look for redress by an action, to be brought in England against a man\r\nwho, perhaps, never might make a visit there. Such considerations might\r\noperate with the merchants to obey these courts, even when they decided\r\nagainst them. Besides, a merchant might think it for his advantage to\r\nyield, in one instance, to a court, which in so many others he found\r\nuseful; he being more frequently plaintiff than defendant.\r\n\r\nIt was in this manner, by a sort of convention, upon views partly\r\nprivate, partly public, with a design sometimes selfish, often generally\r\nbeneficial, but never without the concurrence and support of the majority\r\nof those most interested, was a judicature gradually conferred on these\r\ntwo courts, which with the governor, and the surrogates, possessed all\r\nthe judicature in the island, civil as well as criminal.\r\n\r\nBut a time was coming, when a judicature, that stood on so weak a\r\nfoundation, was to be shaken. Though the justices, and the judge of\r\nthe admiralty court might never come to England, the governor and his\r\nsurrogates necessarily did. In the time of _governor Edwards_, some\r\npersons, discontented with a judgement made by him in court, at _St.\r\nJohn’s_, and carried into execution by the sheriff there, meant to\r\nredress themselves by bringing an action against the governor for a\r\ntrespass in so depriving them of their property. This was to have been\r\ntried at _Exeter_, but it was made up before the case was gone through to\r\nthe jury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The governors cease to hold courts.]\r\n\r\nThe governor got well quit of this business, and he proceeded, during\r\nthe remainder of his time, to hear causes in person, without the least\r\ndoubt or difficulty, as his predecessors had before done. But the minds\r\nof men were changed upon this subject; and his successor _Admiral\r\nCampbell_, 1782, was advised not to take upon him to sit in court, as\r\nhis predecessors had done, nor to determine any causes whatsoever. He\r\nsubstituted in the room of this, a mode which was certainly without\r\nexception; and which, in a country like that, could not fail of having a\r\nvery useful, and very extensive effect. The petitions which used to be\r\nbrought to the governor in great numbers, upon all sorts of questions\r\nand subjects, were still received as before; but instead of holding a\r\ncourt, and making decisions, which were to be enforced by the sheriff,\r\nhe directed his secretary to hear the complainant, and if necessary, the\r\nparty, against whom the complaint was made, and thereupon to write at the\r\nbottom of the petition the governor’s opinion, and give such _advice_,\r\nas if followed, would have the effect of complete justice. Advice and\r\ndirection given from such authority was most usually followed; and the\r\nadministration of justice was, in a great degree, attained in this mode\r\nof application, without any course of process, as in a regular and open\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nHowever, in many cases, this method was not acceptable; and many more\r\npersons began, after this time, to recur to the courts of session, and\r\nvice-admiralty; and these two courts, as they were open all the winter,\r\npresented a more useful, and certain course of redress, than the above\r\nmode of petition. These two courts encreased very much in business from\r\nthe beginning of _Admiral Campbell’s_ government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Court of common pleas instituted.]\r\n\r\nBut these two courts derived this accession of business from the\r\nnecessity of circumstances merely; their authority was still as feeble\r\nas before, and the exercise of it depended upon the like precarious\r\ncircumstances, for being carried into effect. As the population of St.\r\nJohn’s encreased, and as the light of later times, which spreads every\r\nwhere, had reached that place, it became necessary to have something\r\nmore than opinion and sufferance to found a judicial authority upon.\r\nWhen _Admiral Milbanke_ was to set out to his government, in the summer\r\nof 1789, he was strongly advised by his secretary, Mr. Graham, (who had\r\nbeen secretary to the three preceding governors) to get something of a\r\ncourt established, that might stand on unquestionable authority; and the\r\ngovernor’s commission being searched for this purpose, it was found that\r\nhe had full power to appoint _judges, and in cases necessary, justices\r\nof oyer and terminer, &c._ It was suggested to him, that _judges_,\r\ncontrasted as the word there seemed to be with _justices of oyer and\r\nterminer_, ought to be considered as meaning something different from\r\nsuch justices; and that being in a popular, untechnical sense, usually\r\napplied to those who preside in the three courts in Westminster-hall, it\r\nhad grown in the minds of unprofessional men to signify more especially\r\njudges in _civil_ matters; that it therefore seemed, the governor, by\r\nthese words, had authority to institute a court of _civil_ jurisdiction;\r\nand he was accordingly advised to institute a court of _common pleas_ to\r\nproceed by a jury in the manner of a court of common law in this kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Justices appointed.]\r\n\r\nThis opinion upon the wording of the commission, was urged not to be\r\na strained exposition, to obtain _totidem verbis_, an authority which\r\nperhaps might not have been intended to be given; but to be a necessary\r\none, and such alone, as could be drawn from the words. But those who\r\nhave read the foregoing history, of the first granting to the governor\r\nthe authority of appointing commissioners of oyer and terminer, will be\r\nsatisfied, when he reads the same words in the first commission granted\r\nfor that purpose, that they were designed to convey nothing more than\r\nthat simple authority. One may be a little surprised how a power of\r\nappointing commissioners of oyer and terminer should be penned so as to\r\nstand _judges, and in cases necessary justices of oyer and terminer_. But\r\nit appears that in commissions to West India, and other governors, where\r\nit was meant to convey the power of appointing standing _judges_, as well\r\nas occasional _justices_, these words are to be found, placed in this\r\nmanner; and in the way precedents are followed, these words were copied,\r\nwhere it was meant to appoint only justices of oyer and terminer, and\r\nthose occasionally.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Complaints against it.]\r\n\r\nThe governor’s authority, whatever it might be, was actually carried into\r\neffect, by an appointment of a court of common pleas, and judges, in\r\nthe summer 1789. This court of common pleas transacted business during\r\nthe following winter; but the western merchants preferred very heavy\r\ncomplaints against the proceedings of this court; what they alledge\r\nagainst it may be seen shortly stated in the representation afterwards\r\nmade by the committee of trade, and now printed by order of the House\r\nof Commons. Their great objection, which they do _not_ state, but\r\nwhich I will venture to do for them is this; that they now saw a court\r\nestablished (as they believed) upon good authority, with which they could\r\nnot trifle, as they had been used to do with the feeble judicatures\r\nbefore-mentioned; those inefficient courts they preferred, because they\r\ncould make use of them when they needed their assistance, and could\r\nintimidate the justices, and obstruct their proceedings, whenever they\r\nthemselves were to be the objects of animadversion. They had been in\r\nthe habit of seeing this species of weakness and anarchy ever since\r\nNewfoundland was frequented, from father to son; it was favourable to\r\ntheir old impressions, that Newfoundland was _theirs_, and that all the\r\nplanters and inhabitants were to be spoiled and devoured at _their_\r\npleasure; in support of this, they had opposed, as we have seen, every\r\nattempt at introducing order and government into that place. It was in\r\nthis spirit, that they questioned the king’s right to appoint a civil\r\ngovernor, to appoint justices of the peace, to appoint commissioners of\r\noyer and terminer; that they complained of the custom-house, and even\r\ntalked of presenting it as a nuisance, because erected on ship’s room;\r\nthat they treated Stat. 15, Geo. 3, as destructive to the fishery,\r\nbecause it compels the payment of servants’ wages; and that they brought\r\nforward a bill in 1785, in order to expose the servants once more to the\r\nwill of their masters, as to the payment of their wages.\r\n\r\nThese clamours were backed with the popular representation, that the\r\nfishery should be _free_, and that a fishery carried on from this\r\ncountry, as the western merchants carried it on, was the old and true\r\npolicy for Newfoundland. But their claims to a free fishery seem to\r\nbe these; namely, to be free of all inspection from government; no\r\njustices, no courts, no custom-house. This is what they mean, when they\r\nwish all _restraints_ to be taken off the fishery, so as they may carry\r\nit on upon the footing of Stat. 10 and 11 Will. 3.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Representation.]\r\n\r\nThe pretences urged by the merchants against the court were seen through\r\nby his majesty’s servants; but it appearing to the law-officers, that\r\nthe governor had not authority under the words of his commission before\r\nobserved upon, to institute that, or any other court, for civil causes;\r\nand it appearing to the committee of council for trade, that _a court of\r\ncivil jurisdiction_ ought to be established there, they recommended to\r\nhis majesty to appoint or to authorise the governor, by proper words,\r\nto appoint one; and this court, they recommended, should proceed in a\r\nsummary way. The opinion of the board on this matter will be better seen\r\nin the _representation_ they made to his majesty, which was laid before\r\nthe house of commons, and has been printed by their order.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Act passed for a Court of Civil Judication.]\r\n\r\nHowever, no court was then established; and the court of common pleas,\r\ninstituted by the governor, continued, during the year 1790, to\r\nproceed as before. The subject was taken up by the committee of trade\r\nin the year 1791; and a bill was presented to parliament, under their\r\ndirection, for instituting a court of the sort they had recommended in\r\nthe representation made in 1790. This bill passed into a law; and being\r\nintended as an experiment of a new judicature, it was to endure for one\r\nyear only. The result of that experiment was to propose another bill in\r\nthe sessions of 1792, for instituting a court somewhat different from\r\nthat of the preceding bill. This also was only for a year.\r\n\r\nIt is now for the consideration of parliament finally to determine what\r\ncourts are to be established in the island for the administration of\r\njustice in future.\r\n\r\n                                                            _April 1793._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX:\r\n\r\nCONTAINING\r\n\r\nThe STATUTES relating to\r\n\r\nNEWFOUNDLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Stat. 10 & 11 _Gul._ III.

King’s subjects to have free trade to\r\n_Newfoundland_.
