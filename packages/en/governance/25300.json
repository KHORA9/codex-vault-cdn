TACITUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_LONDON_:\r\n\r\nPrinted for J. S. JORDAN, No. 166, Fleet Street.\r\n\r\n[PRICE ONE SHILLING AND SIXPENCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE REBELLION,\r\n\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW SUBJECTS,\r\n\r\nIt is always a bold undertaking in a private individual to become the\r\nadvocate of a suffering people. It is peculiarly difficult at the\r\npresent moment to be the advocate of the people of Ireland, because\r\nthere are among them men who have taken the power of redress into their\r\nown hands, and committed acts of outrage and rebellion which no\r\nsufferings could justify, and which can only tend to aggravate ten-fold\r\nthe other calamities of their country. Deeply impressed, however, as I\r\nam with a conviction that these difficulties stand in my way, I shall\r\nyet venture to state to Englishmen the case of Ireland. In doing so, I\r\nrest not on a vain confidence in my own strength, but on the nature of\r\nthe cause I plead; for I am convinced, that when the train of measures\r\nwhich have led that miserable country into its present situation shall\r\nbe fully disclosed, it will be but little difficult to rouze the people\r\nof England not merely to commiserate a distressed country, but excite\r\nthem to exert their constitutional endeavours, as head of the British\r\nempire, to avert the destruction of its principal member.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance which gives me hope. The people of England\r\nat this hour feel themselves much more interested in what concerns\r\nIrishmen, than they have ever done at any former period. Whatever\r\nmischiefs may have resulted to human society from that kind of\r\nphilosophic illumination by which modern times are distinguished, one\r\ncertain good at least has been produced by it--men have become better\r\nacquainted--the bond of a common nature has been strengthened--and each\r\ncountry begins to feel an interest in the concerns of every other. It is\r\nnot to a more extensive personal intercourse, or to the creation of any\r\nnew principles of political union, that this is to be attributed. It is\r\nowing solely to an increased communication of sentiment and feeling--to\r\na knowledge which has diffused itself through the world that the human\r\nmind is every where made of the same materials, and that on all the\r\ngreat questions which concern man's interest in society, the men of\r\nevery country think alike. Hence has arisen an increased sympathy\r\nbetween nations--if not between those who govern them, at least between\r\nthose by whom they are constituted; and hence too has it followed, that\r\nthose national antipathies which had so long debased and afflicted\r\nmankind, are now become less strong and rancorous; and, it may be\r\nreasonable to hope, will one day be known no more.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, on the influence of this nascent principle of\r\nphilanthropy among nations that I ground my principal hope, when I call\r\non Englishmen to hear with an ear of kindness and concern the complaint\r\nof a sister-country. I resort to a still more powerful principle--I\r\nshall call on them as a people famed even in barbarous times for those\r\nfeelings of generosity and compassion, which are inseparable from\r\nvalour--I shall call on them as a FREE people, to watch with caution the\r\nprogress of despotism toward their own shores, stalking in all its\r\nhorrors of murder, pillage, and flames, through the territory of a\r\nneighbour--I shall call even on their INTEREST, to save from utter ruin,\r\npolitical, commercial, and constitutional, the most valuable member of\r\nthe British empire! If Englishmen look with horror on the enormities of\r\nFrance, I will call on them to let crimes of as black a dye perpetrated\r\nin Ireland meet their share of detestation. If they who subvert the good\r\norder of society--who overleap the bounds fixed by the law of Nature\r\nitself to guard the liberty, life, and property of individuals against\r\nthe spoiler, be fit objects of reprobation, I shall turn the eyes of all\r\nthe good and wise in England toward that faction by whose counsels and\r\nwhose deeds the fairest island in the British empire has been made a\r\ntheatre on which lawless outrage has played its deadly freaks!\r\n\r\nWhen I speak in terms thus strong of that system under which the people\r\nof Ireland have suffered for some years, and by which they have been\r\ngoaded into acts of folly and madness which no good man is either able\r\nor inclined to defend, let me not too early be charged with declamation.\r\nThere are some cases in which no language can be declamatory because no\r\nwords can aggravate them. If I shall not shew before I conclude this\r\naddress that the case of Ireland is one of them, let me _then_ be\r\nbranded with the epithet of empty talker!\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary for me, in stating to the people of England\r\nthe calamities under which Ireland smarts, and the causes which produced\r\nthem, to go farther back than that period at which she became, nominally\r\nat least, an independent country. What remains of her history before\r\nthat period the honour of both countries calls on us to forget--a\r\nmistaken but overbearing principle of domination and monopoly on one\r\nhand, fed and strengthened by a servile and base acquiescence on the\r\nother, constitute the outline of the sketch--an idle and beggared\r\npopulace, a jobbing legislature, proscriptions, penal laws, &c. &c. are\r\nthe disgusting materials with which it must be filled. That Time should\r\nquickly draw his veil over such a scene, and cover it with oblivion\r\nwould be the natural wish of every British and Irish heart, were it not\r\nthat scenes still more disgraceful to both countries and more calamitous\r\nto one of them have succeeded--scenes which force the mind to revert\r\nwith regret to those days of poverty and peace, when, as there existed\r\nlittle wealth to excite avarice, and little spirit to aggravate the\r\nambition of party, that little remained inviolate, and the miserable\r\ncabin, though filled with objects of disgusting wretchedness, was yet\r\nthe secure covering and castle of its humble owner.--How different his\r\npresent situation! when in laying down his head at night he fears lest\r\nbefore morning he shall be rouzed by the cries of his family in flames,\r\nor dragged from his bed by military ruffians, to be hanged at his own\r\ndoor!\r\n\r\nForgetting then the many causes of discontent with the people of England\r\nwhich existed in Ireland prior to the year 1782, I shall call the\r\nattention of this country to only those transactions which have taken\r\nplace since that time--and indeed to many of those transactions it would\r\nnot be necessary to advert at all, were it not for that minute and\r\nelaborate detail which has been made of them by a well known public\r\ncharacter in a late publication,[1] for the purpose of proving that\r\nIreland deserved what she suffered--that she has been always sottishly\r\ndiscontented and basely ungrateful. But I call on Englishmen to judge\r\nimpartially for themselves--nor let the confident assertion or bold\r\nrecrimination of an accused man pre-occupy their decision on the merits\r\nand the sufferings of an unhappy people.\r\n\r\nIt will scarcely be denied at this day, that the people of Ireland did\r\nright in calling for the independence of their legislature in the year\r\n1782, and in pressing that claim on the British minister, until he\r\nyielded to its force.--It is admitted that Ireland, on that occasion,\r\nwhile she armed herself to repel the foes of Britain, while her\r\npopulation poured to her shores to resist the insulting fleet of the\r\nenemy, and preserve her connexion with the empire, acted with the proper\r\nand true spirit of a brave and loyal people in calling on the British\r\nParliament for a renunciation of that claim to rule her which was\r\noriginally founded only on her weakness, and was supported by no other\r\nargument than power. While this then is admitted, let it be remembered,\r\nthat they who opposed this just claim of Ireland to be free, must have\r\nbeen the advocates of a slavish system--and that the people of Ireland\r\nmight fairly entertain doubts of the sincere attachment of such men to\r\nher cause.--Let it be remembered, that the men who said to a country\r\nstruggling for the legitimate power of governing for itself, \"You have\r\nno right to make your own laws--you are materials fit only to be\r\ngoverned by strangers,\" were not men in whom that country, when she\r\nsucceeded in the struggle, could place much confidence. In fact, she\r\ndid not confide in them. It was thought necessary to watch attentively\r\nthe measures of men who had reluctantly assented to the manumission of\r\ntheir country, and who were believed to have such a deeply rooted\r\nattachment to the principles of the old court, that they would lose no\r\nopportunity of re-inducing upon the nation those bonds which she had\r\nbroken only by a combination of fortunate circumstances, concurring with\r\nher own efforts.\r\n\r\nIn this consciousness of the danger with which they were surrounded from\r\nfalse friends, originated that doubt which is now charged on the people\r\nof Ireland as a first proof of wanton discontent--I mean a doubt about\r\nthe validity of the simple repeal of the 6th Geo. III. as an act of\r\nrenunciation. Discontent on this subject arose and became general in\r\nIreland almost immediately on the repeal of that obnoxious statute; and\r\nfrom the zeal and warmth with which it was attempted to _beat it down_,\r\ndid for a time put the kingdom in a ferment. The men who have since that\r\ntime scourged Ireland with a rod of iron, charge this as the\r\ncommencement of the crimes of the country--the first overt act of her\r\nintemperance and violent propensity to discontent. Whether it deserves\r\nthat epithet Englishmen will judge, when they learn that this doubt was\r\nfirst suggested by some of the best lawyers--the warmest friends and the\r\nmost enlightened and able men whom Ireland ever knew--by Walter Hussey\r\nBurgh--by Henry Flood, and by the brilliant phalanx of constitutional\r\nlawyers who at that time graced the popular cause--men \"to whom\r\ncompared\" the most proud and petulant of her present persecutors \"are\r\nbut the insects of a summer's day.\" These gentlemen had been the\r\nlong-tried friends of the country--they had been found pure in\r\nprinciple, and in intellect superior to their contemporaries. Where,\r\ntherefore, was the wonder, that the people should adopt an opinion\r\nsanctioned and inculcated by such venerable names? What was there\r\nstrange or criminal in believing, that a country which only retracted in\r\nsilence a claim for more than half a century enforced and acted on, did\r\nbut suspend for the present a right which she believed to exist, and\r\nwhich she would not fail to urge again in more favourable circumstances?\r\nThe partisans of the Irish Chancellor act with as much confidence on\r\n_his_ opinions in cases where common understandings have less to guide\r\nthem: why then should the people of Ireland be branded as seditious and\r\ndisaffected, for following, in a matter of law, the counsels of men\r\nwhose integrity she had tried, and whose talents were acknowledged?\r\n\r\nIt is true, indeed, there was on the other side of this question a name\r\nto which Ireland owed much, and to whose subsequent exertions in her\r\ncause, though fruitless, she owes perhaps still more--Mr. Grattan. _He_\r\nthought the simple repeal of itself a valid and full renunciation. But\r\nit may be said for the people of Ireland, that Mr. Grattan, when this\r\nquestion was agitated, stood in circumstances which deducted much from\r\nhis high authority. He had but just come from the Treasury, after\r\nreceiving 50,000l. for his past services--and it was too generally known\r\nin Ireland, that there was some quality in Treasury gold, however\r\nacquired, which attracted the possessor powerfully towards the Castle.\r\nThe private judgement of Mr. Grattan might also be reasonably supposed\r\nto have a bias on the question, from the circumstance of being himself\r\nthe adviser of the simple repeal--the idea of an explicit renunciation\r\nnot having been started when Mr. Grattan's principal exertions, seconded\r\nby the voice of the people, triumphed over the old system. There was\r\nanother reason--Mr. Grattan's influence was weakened, if not lost, by\r\nthe fallen character of those with whom he then acted. The people of\r\nIreland were naturally jealous of those men who had uniformly supported\r\nthe dominating principles of the British party in Ireland, and who had\r\nas violently opposed (though by more legitimate means) the exertions of\r\nthe popular party to obtain an independent legislature, as they now do\r\nto prevent the reform of the legislative body. And finally, the opinion\r\nand authority of Mr. Grattan, however respectable were not thought an\r\nadequate counterpoize to the weight of those very numerous and most\r\nrespectable opinions which were on this question in opposition to his.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the charge of sottish discontent, which has\r\nbeen so confidently made against the Irish nation, will appear to be one\r\nof those foul calumnies by which a desperate and enraged faction strive\r\nto cover their own enormities. Englishmen, and the world, will see, that\r\nhad Ireland at that critical moment adopted the advice of those who had\r\nalways acted as enemies to her best interests, and rejected the counsels\r\nand opinions of those to whom she owed the most important obligations,\r\nshe would _then_ indeed have been incorrigibly sottish.\r\n\r\nThe next _crime_ with which the Irish nation stands charged, is their\r\nearly and zealous efforts for parliamentary reform.--It has been\r\nenumerated as one of the causes which have produced the present horrible\r\nsystem of administration in Ireland, that shortly after the\r\nestablishment of their legislative independence, a convention met in\r\nDublin, consisting of representatives from the different Volunteer\r\nAssociations, by whom the country had been saved from the common enemy,\r\nand who were supposed to have contributed much to the establishment of\r\nher independence. This convention had been constituted on the same\r\nprinciple (but with more circumspection and order) as that which was so\r\nwell known by the name of the Dungannon meeting--an assembly, which\r\nthough perfectly military, so far as its being constituted by armed\r\ncitizens could make it so, did more towards asserting the independence\r\nof Ireland and procuring for her the most important advantages of\r\nconstitution and commerce than any other which ever sat in Ireland. To\r\nthe Dungannon meeting, however, no exceptions were taken--they were\r\nsuffered to meet--to resolve--and to point out in the most decisive tone\r\nthe grievances under which they supposed the country laboured. Their\r\nremonstrances were carried even to the foot of the throne, and the\r\nfather of his people, uninfluenced by that romantic sense of dignity,\r\nwhich has since produced such lamentable effects in Irish\r\nParliaments--graciously received, and wisely attended to their\r\nremonstrances.--The jesuitical or Machiavelian distinction between\r\ncitizens in red clothes and in coloured ones, had not yet been thought\r\nof--it was considered sufficient to entitle an address or petition to a\r\nrespectful hearing, if it was substantially the sense of a great body of\r\nthe property and population of the state, no matter whether they spoke\r\nin the character of volunteers associated to defend the constitution, or\r\nas freeholders assembled only to exercise its privileges.\r\n\r\nIt is not for me now to defend the convention of that day from the\r\nimputation of false policy and imprudence, in preferring the character\r\nof soldiers to that of citizens in their deliberative capacity, but I\r\ncannot help observing--First, that the Irish administration have never\r\nmanifested any dislike of military bodies--real, mercenary, foreign\r\nsoldiers,--expressing publicly _their_ sentiments on great public\r\nquestions, when those sentiments coincided with the politics of the\r\nCastle--witness the manifestoes with which the Irish newspapers have\r\nfor the last year or two been crouded, from Scotch and English mercenary\r\ntroops, in which these zealous advocates for religion and liberty\r\ndeclare themselves friends to this or that measure, publish their\r\ndetermination to support them--and sometimes conclude by letting the\r\nIrish public know--_they had not come thither to be trifled\r\nwith_.--Secondly, I must remark, that tho' the great objection to the\r\nvolunteer convention was its being armed, and consisting of the\r\nrepresentatives of an armed body, yet opposition equally violent has\r\nbeen since made to other representative bodies _not_ military--instance\r\nthe calumny with which the servants of the Irish administration have\r\nblackened the Catholic committee--and, above all, instance the Athlone\r\nconvention, the meeting of which administration were so solicitous to\r\nprevent, that they ventured on a law to prevent for ever the meeting of\r\nany representative body--the House of Commons excepted.\r\n\r\nBy these circumstances it seems sufficiently clear, that the\r\ninconceivable aversion entertained against this body, and the memory of\r\nit, was founded not in its being military, but in its being\r\nrepresentative and popular--not in its constitution, but in its\r\nobject.--With respect to its being a representative body, I profess, for\r\nmy own part, I cannot conceive why for that reason the Irish government\r\nand the Irish Chancellor have held it so much in abomination. You,\r\nEnglishmen, who understand that constitution of which you are properly\r\nso proud, will be surprized to hear that representative bodies are\r\nunconstitutional.--If you heard this asserted with much confidence by a\r\nlawyer, you would say he had studied special pleading rather than the\r\nBritish constitution.--If you heard this doctrine swallowed implicitly\r\nby an assembly of legislators, you would say they were still unfit to\r\ngovern themselves. What is it, you would ask, that forms the general and\r\npervading principle of the British constitution, if not the\r\nrepresentative one? Every petty corporation, you would observe, elects\r\nrepresentatives to act for them in their Common Council--the council\r\nelect Aldermen, and these again their Mayor--all on the same\r\nprinciple--that of having the sense of the multitude concentrated, and\r\ntheir business dispatched at once with ease and order. Nay, every\r\nFreeman is himself but a representative, not indeed of other men--but of\r\nhis own property.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible that this should have been the real ground of\r\nobjection to the Convention, however it might have been urged as the\r\nostensible one--for it is obvious, that if the principle of\r\nrepresentation be a fair and useful principle to adopt in collecting the\r\nsense of the people with respect to laws or taxes, it must also be a\r\nuseful and fair principle to resort to, in every other instance, where\r\ngreat bodies of men are permitted to express their common sense as they\r\nare _unquestionably_ in petitioning for redress of grievances, &c. No,\r\nEnglishmen! it was not because the Convention was unconstitutional as\r\nbeing representative, but because it was chosen to recommend, as the\r\nsense of the Irish people (for the Volunteers of that day were people of\r\nIreland,)--a parliamentary reform, and to consider of a specific plan.\r\nIt was this that the corrupt part of the Irish Government dreaded. They\r\nhad been stunned by the unexpected blow struck by the people in\r\nasserting the independence of the legislature: for whatever credit the\r\nParliament of that day may assume for the part which they acted in that\r\nbusiness, it requires no argument to prove to a discerning man, that\r\nthey were passive instruments in the people's hand--they only re-echoed\r\nthe voice of an armed nation which they conceived too loud to be\r\nsmothered, and were hurried on irresistibly by that enthusiastic\r\nsentiment for national independence, which the ability of _one_ great\r\nmind, aided by a fortunate concurrence of existing circumstances, had\r\nexcited. But at the period I now speak of, the party of the British\r\nMinister had recovered from the astonishment into which the successful\r\nand prompt energy of the nation had thrown him. He now began to reflect\r\non the extensive consequence which must follow from the restoration to\r\nIreland of the right of legislating for herself. It was soon felt, that\r\nthere now remained in the hands of the court faction in Ireland, only\r\none instrument by which the effect of the recent revolution could be\r\nchecked or frustrated; and that was, the borough system. It was seen,\r\nthat whatever nominal independence the Irish legislature might have\r\nattained, yet while a majority of the Commons' House was constituted of\r\nmembers returned immediately by the crown influence, the will of the\r\ncrown or the will of the British Cabinet must still be the law which\r\nwould bind Ireland. To preserve the borough system then, at all hazards,\r\nbecame from that moment the great object of the dominating faction. The\r\nConvention was an engine which seemed to threaten its immediate and\r\ncomplete overthrow; it was therefore resolved, by all means, to effect\r\nits ruins. The staunch hounds which had fattened for years on the vitals\r\nof the country, but had been for some time kept at bay by the universal\r\nenergy of the public mind, were again hallooed into action. In addition\r\nto these were introduced new forces from every quarter, but principally\r\nfrom the old aristocratic families, who had monopolized for a century\r\nthe power and wealth of the country. On the memorable night when Mr.\r\nFlood presented to the House the petition of the Convention, was made\r\nthe grand effort which was to decide whether the will of the nation or\r\nthat of the old faction should govern. The latter was victorious. The\r\npeople, with the characteristic levity of their nation, repulsed in this\r\ngreat effort, for the present, at least, shrunk back from the contest.\r\nThe victorious party, possessing means of the most extensive and\r\ncorrupting influence, strained them to the utmost; and gaining ground\r\nfrom that moment on the sense of the nation on that main point, have\r\ncontinued triumphantly and insolently to prostrate the people of\r\nIreland. Every thinking and steady Irishman, however, retained his\r\nopinion as to the necessity of reform, and continued by the few means in\r\nhis power, to promote it. At this point, then, commenced the separation\r\nbetween the Irish administration with their partisans in Parliament and\r\nthe Irish people, and from that time they have gone in directly opposite\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nSuch, Englishmen, is another of the crimes with which we are charged,\r\nand for which the highest law authority in our country has declared we\r\nmerit to be deprived of all the benefits of the British constitution!\r\nFor this we have been called a sottish, an insatiable, and tumultuous\r\npeople--and to punish us for this offence the world has been told we\r\ndeserve all those horrible calamities which, year after year, since that\r\ntime have been inflicted on us!\r\n\r\nI have already said, that the people and the parliamentary supporters of\r\nadministration separated from the moment when the Irish House of Commons\r\nextinguished the public hope on the important measure of parliamentary\r\nreform. The grand argument urged by the House of Commons against a\r\nreform at that time was, that it would be a surrender of the dignity and\r\nindependence of the legislature to adopt a measure proposed to it on the\r\npoint of a bayonet. The Convention proved the malice of the argument by\r\nthe manner in which they bore the insulting rejection of their petition:\r\nhaving discharged the duty which they were created to perform, they\r\ndissolved, not only without a threat but without a murmur. The people,\r\nwith a patience and moderation of which perhaps few more laudable\r\ninstances are to be found in the history of any country, acquiesced, or\r\nsubmitted in silence to the decision of the legislation on this their\r\nmost esteemed and favourite application. No doubt they hoped that a\r\nParliament who refused to receive the petition of the people when\r\npresented as soldiers, would listen with a more patient ear to their\r\nclaims when presented in another character. But this hope having been\r\ntried for five years without effect, was at last relinquished. The\r\npertinacity with which all applications on the subject of reform were\r\nrejected, put it beyond doubt that reform was an object which by\r\nordinary means could never be obtained. It was, however, a measure too\r\nbig, when it had once gotten possession of the public mind, to be let go\r\nwithout a struggle. Accordingly, whatever of intelligence, of zeal, or\r\nof public spirit the country possessed, continued to be directed toward\r\nthe acquisition of this great object. Among other modes which had been\r\ndevised for giving greater efficacy to the public will on this subject,\r\nwas that of forming societies which should have for their sole object to\r\nanimate, to direct, to concentrate, the exertions of the people in the\r\npursuit of this favourite and vital measure. Of these societies the\r\nfirst was formed in Dublin, of a few men whose talents, principles, and\r\ncharacter, moral and political, gave such weight and popularity to their\r\nunion, as soon swelled its numbers to a great magnitude, which, while it\r\ngave hope to the friends of the popular cause, excited in the\r\nadministration very lively alarm. But it was yet more the principles of\r\nthis body than its numbers which alarmed administration. The original\r\nmembers of the society, men of minds not only firmly attached to the\r\npolitical interests of this country, but superior to the influence of\r\nbigotry, which had been the most powerful instrument in the hands of the\r\nCourt faction for dividing and weakening the people, made it a radical\r\nprinciple of their union to promote an abolition of all religious\r\ndistinction, and to procure for _all_ the freemen of the state, whatever\r\nmight be their religious sentiments, a participation in _all_ the\r\nprivileges of the British constitution. A reform in Parliament,\r\naccompanied by such a principle as this, became a measure in which every\r\nman in the country was interested; and the catholics, who constitute\r\nthe great majority of the people, more interested than others. The\r\nconsequence was, that men of every description of religion, men of every\r\nrank in life, not immediately under the controul or influence of the\r\nCastle, adopted the principles of the society, or solicited admission\r\ninto the ranks. The fear and the hatred of administration was soon\r\nmanifested. Every art was used to blacken the principles of the\r\nsociety--its principal members were pointed out as the agitators of\r\nsedition--the enemies of social order--and men who aimed at nothing less\r\nthan a subversion of the constitution and separation from Great Britain,\r\nunder the pretext of reform and emancipation. The prints which were in\r\nthe pay of the Castle vomited out daily the most gross, the most\r\nmalignant, and irritating calumnies; and even the senate itself, now\r\nreally forgetting its dignity, condescended to become the scurrilous\r\naggressor not merely of the society at large, but of particular, and, in\r\nmany instances, inconsiderable members of it.\r\n\r\nIt was this despicable conduct in the prevailing faction in Ireland that\r\nlaid the ground work of all the mischiefs which have since affected our\r\nunhappy country. The Irish Minister who paid the money of the people to\r\ncover their name with infamy and their principles with dishonour, him I\r\ncharge with having first implanted in the minds of the multitude that\r\ninvincible detestation of the system by which they were governed, that\r\nhas since ended in assassination and treason. His subordinate agents,\r\nwho in the folly and venom of their hearts at one time charged the great\r\nbody of the Catholics with disaffection, at another held up to ridicule\r\nand odium the names of individuals of the most respectable and unsullied\r\ncharacters--at one time sneering at the merchant, at another insulting\r\nthe tradesman, them I charge with having irritated the people of Ireland\r\nwantonly and wickedly, by calling forth the personal feelings, the\r\npride, and sensibility of individuals, into a personal and revengeful\r\nopposition to the British name and British connection. What would\r\nEnglishmen have felt, how would Englishmen have acted, had two or three\r\nindividuals, strangers to their country, despicable in point of birth or\r\ntalents, and considerable only from fortuitous elevation to offices\r\nwhich they were unfit to fill, ventured to insult their national\r\ncharacter--to accuse of treason every man who dared to complain of his\r\nsufferings or his privations, or assumed the courage to exercise the\r\nhumble privilege of petitioning for redress? If the saucy hirelings of a\r\nforeign Cabinet should publicly avow contempt for the men who uphold the\r\nstrength and consequence of the state by useful industry, and tell the\r\nmerchant and manufacturer that it was not for such fellows to deal in\r\npolitics, to seek for rights, or talk of constitution--would not the\r\nspirit of the nation rise against their insolence, and make them feel\r\nhow much more valuable _he_ is who promotes the comfort and welfare of\r\nsociety by commerce or by labour, than _he_ who lives upon the spoil of\r\nthe community in something _worse_ than idleness?\r\n\r\nIt was this arrogance in the Castle servants, the result of their\r\nconscious strength in corruption, that scouted with contempt and insult,\r\nout of the Irish House of Commons in 1795, the petition of three\r\nmillions of Catholics, fully and impartially represented. Was not this\r\nan aggression of administration against the people? And yet the\r\npartisans of that administration--nay, the first mover in it, has had\r\nthe confidence to assert, that the discontents and tumults of the people\r\n_preceded_ the measures of which they complain. Englishmen will\r\ndetermine, whether the Irish nation, consisting principally of\r\nCatholics, had or had not reason to be disgusted with the administration\r\nof the government under which they lived, when by the influence of that\r\nadministration not only their wishes were not consulted, not only their\r\ngeneral sense disregarded, but even their supplications spurned without\r\na hearing from that body which professed to be, and which ought to be,\r\ntheir representatives.\r\n\r\nIf it be granted that such conduct in the popular representation of a\r\nnation was calculated to excite discontent and destroy confidence, what\r\nfollowed that transaction must have had a much more powerful tendency to\r\nalienate the affection of the people, and produce those direful\r\nconsequences which are now boldly said to have arisen unprovoked. When\r\nthe Irish Catholics perceived, from the manner in which their petition\r\nfor the elective franchise was treated, that in the Irish House of\r\nCommons they were not to look for friends, they resorted to the Throne.\r\nThe supplications which had met only with contumely when addressed to\r\nthe Irish Commons, was received with favour by a British King, acting\r\nwith the advice of a British Cabinet. In the next session, the speech\r\nfrom the throne recommended to the Irish Parliament to take into their\r\nconsideration the situation of the King's Catholic subjects. No sooner\r\nwas this hint received from the British Cabinet, than those very men,\r\nwho but last year pledged their lives and fortunes to perpetuate the\r\nexclusion of the Irish Catholics from the privileges of freemen, because\r\nto admit them to share those privileges would be a subversion of the\r\nconstitution and establishment, surrendered that opinion with as much\r\npromptness and facility as they had shewn violence and rancour in taking\r\nit up. Without any petition from the Catholics, without any change of\r\ncircumstances, except the declaration of the will of the British\r\nCabinet, that privilege which was last year refused with so much\r\nharshness and disdain, was this year spontaneously conceded!\r\n\r\nWill any man who knows any thing of men and of the feelings and motives\r\nwhich actuate them, assert that there was any thing in this concession\r\nwhich should attach more firmly the Irish Catholics to the Irish House\r\nof Commons? Will he say that this was one of those gracious measures\r\nwhich an enlightened legislature would adopt to soften the exasperation\r\nof national discontent? Probably he will rather say, it was fitted to\r\nevince more strongly than ever the necessity of reforming the\r\nconstitution of that assembly, which, from the inconsistency of its\r\nmeasures, appeared evidently the instrument of a foreign will, not the\r\nauthentic organ of the national sense.\r\n\r\nLet him, or them whose hot folly, whose rank bigotry, or whose petulant\r\nand stolid zeal led the Irish Commons into this disgraceful and\r\ncontemptible situation, feel the blush of shame and confusion burn their\r\ncheek, when they reflect on these scenes. Let them, while it is yet in\r\ntheir power, atone to their offended country for the fatal consequences\r\nof their advice, before those records which are to inform future ages\r\nimpress on their names for ever the indelible character of--PUBLIC\r\nENEMY.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of these transactions I have not attended to chronological\r\naccuracy. There were other measures to which the administration of\r\nIreland had resorted to prop up their power, and form a substitute for\r\nthat legitimate strength which is to be found only in the chearful\r\nsupport of a contented people--there were other measures which they\r\nadopted to beat down the public voice, and overbear the general sense of\r\nthe nation. Among these were wanton prosecutions of innocent and\r\nrespectable men, sometimes for libels, which all publications were\r\nconstrued to be that dared to talk of reform as a good measure, or of\r\nconstitutional rights as things to be desired; others for crimes of a\r\ndeeper die--for sedition and for treason. The evidence adduced in\r\nsupport of these charges were often the vilest of the rabble, whose\r\ntestimony on the trials was discredited even by themselves, and the\r\nprisoners discharged, to the honour of themselves and the detestation of\r\ntheir accusers. Such was the case of the Drogheda merchants, on whose\r\ntrial came out proofs of subornation and perjury which would shock\r\ncredibility. These, however, were but venial errors, compared with those\r\nmore mortal sins against the constitution and against common right, with\r\nwhich the Irish administration stands charged--sins, which including a\r\nviolation of general and vital principles, may be fairly reckoned among\r\nthose great and leading causes which have reduced Ireland to the\r\ndreadful state of discontent and disorder in which she now stands.\r\n\r\nOf these, one was the Convention Bill--a measure proposed by\r\nadministration, and adopted by the Parliament of that day, for the\r\navowed purpose of preventing the Catholics from collecting the sense of\r\ntheir body on a petition to Parliament, or to the Throne, for the\r\nelective franchise. This bill, if it did not annihilate a popular right,\r\ncertainly narrowed it to a degree which, in a great measure, under the\r\nthen existing circumstances, destroyed its efficacy. It had been one of\r\nthe special pleading tricks of the Irish Court, when the people\r\nexpressed their sense on particular measures, if there happened to be\r\nany variations of mode or sentiment in the application of different\r\nbodies, to take occasion, from these variations, to reject the whole as\r\ninconsistent. This scheme had been practised with much plausibility on\r\nthe question of reform. No reform, they contended, was practicable,\r\nwhich would content the nation; because of the many petitions which had\r\nbeen presented from the different counties, cities, and towns in the\r\ncountry, and of the many plans which had been proposed, no two were\r\nfound perfectly to correspond--as if when the general sense of the\r\npeople was fully expressed, no attention should be paid to it, because\r\nthere was not to be found in the various expressions of that sense that\r\nperfect coincidence which on a general question of morals or politics it\r\nis absolutely impossible to attain. It had also been boldly and\r\nshamelessly asserted by administration, in opposition to the most\r\ngeneral and public declaration of the Catholic body, that the claim of\r\nthe elective franchise was only the suggestion of a few turbulent\r\nagitators, and that the great bulk of the Catholics had neither\r\nsolicitude nor desire about the matter. To give the lie to this hardy\r\nand absurd assertion, the Catholics resolved upon a measure which would\r\nput the matter beyond doubt, and by collecting into a focus the sense of\r\ntheir body, and expressing that sense in a simple and explicit manner,\r\nwould take from their enemies the two great arguments by which they had\r\ndefeated the popular applications for reform. Administration, however,\r\nwere too vigilant to suffer the Catholics to get hold of this powerful\r\nweapon. The Convention Bill, by which all representative assemblies were\r\nmade illegal, and punishable with the severest penalties, proposed in\r\nhaste, and passed with precipitation, deprived them of the only means of\r\ngiving to the legislature that simple and indubitable declaration of\r\nthe general sense, which, however, the legislature insisted on as a\r\nnecessary preliminary to hearing their complaints.\r\n\r\nHere certainly was another of those measures which without any crime in\r\nthe people of Ireland was levelled at one of their most valuable\r\nprivileges. Let the people of England judge, whether under the\r\ncircumstances I have mentioned, it was not likely to wound deeply the\r\nfeelings of three-fourths of his Majesty's Irish subjects--and, combined\r\nas it was with the insulting rejection of the Catholic petition, and the\r\nsubsequent concession, at the instance of the British Cabinet, of that\r\nfavour which was refused to Irish supplication--let Englishmen say,\r\nwhether it may not fairly be reckoned among the wanton and unprovoked\r\ncauses of the present discontents.\r\n\r\nThe Convention Bill, however mischievous it may have been by aggravating\r\nthe discontent which had already spread through the mass of the people,\r\nwas yet more mischievous by stopping up that channel through which\r\npopular discontent discharges itself with most safety--that of petition\r\nand remonstrance. So little effect had been found to result from the\r\npetitions of individuals in the legislature on any of the great\r\nquestions which in any degree interfered with the system adopted by\r\nadministration, and in which they seemed resolved to persevere, that it\r\nwas thought futile and absurd to resort to that mode of stating\r\ncomplaint or soliciting redress. If a corporation petitioned, they were\r\nanswered only by an observation on the manner in which the petition was\r\nobtained, by contrasting it with other petitions procured by Castle\r\ninfluence, or by some sarcastic remark on their profession or character.\r\nIf a body of citizens petitioned, they were porter-house politicians or\r\nbankrupt traders. There remained, therefore, no way in which the people\r\ncould lay their complaints before the legislature, with any hope of\r\nrelief, but in that general way of a representative body, which, while\r\nit gave weight and consistency to their application, obviated those\r\npitiful arts by which the Castle continued to elude and frustrate the\r\nwishes of the people. The Convention Bill, by rendering that mode\r\nimpracticable, compressed the public discontents, and while it encreased\r\nthe irritation, left no vent to its violence but in assassination and\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\nThat such would be the consequence of this measure, administration were\r\nsolemnly warned. It was urged on them, but without effect, that in every\r\ncountry where the freedom of remonstrance and complaint was denied,\r\nsecret conspiracy or open insurrection took the place of angry but\r\nharmless petition. Italy was mentioned; and it was said, rather with the\r\nspirit of a prophet than a politician, that if this bill passed, Ireland\r\nwould become more infamous for private assassination than Italy itself.\r\nThe Society of United Irishmen was not yet become a clandestine or an\r\nillegal body--but it was foretold, that this bill would create\r\nclandestine and seditious meetings: for it was easy to see, that when\r\ndiscontented people were prevented from uttering their complaints, they\r\nwould substitute other modes of redress for angry publication. But with\r\nthe administration of Ireland, or the Irish House of Commons of that\r\nday, advice and remonstrance were vain. They boldly ventured on a\r\nmeasure of which these consequences were foreseen, yet now profess to\r\nwonder why such consequences have happened. On the folly of their\r\ncounsels, then, the people of Ireland are justified in charging the\r\nassassinations--the sedition--the conspiracy, which have disgraced their\r\ncountry: they are not the native growth of her soil! They have been\r\nbegotten only by insolence and injury upon the stifled indignation of a\r\nvolatile and feeling people!\r\n\r\nBut the Convention act was not the only measure to which the party\r\nabusing the powers of government in Ireland resorted, to tame or to\r\nirritate the Irish people. The Gunpowder Bill, prior in order and time,\r\nwhich deprived the Irish subject in a great measure of the\r\nconstitutional power of self-defence, prepared the minds of the people\r\nfor receiving the full impression of the Convention act, which narrowed\r\nanother of his rights. The attempt to annihilate the independence of the\r\ncountry, by insisting on the right of Britain to choose a regent for\r\nIreland, and the subsequent attempt of the same kind in 1785 to\r\nsubstitute a commercial boon for the right of self-government, had\r\nalready gone far toward producing a tendency to irritation in the\r\npeople, which these more vital attacks completed.\r\n\r\nNor did even these measures, insidious, violent, and unconstitutional as\r\nthey were, produce so much discontent as the tone and the spirit in\r\nwhich they were tarried into execution. The most insulting imputations\r\non the loyalty, and even on the intellect of the nation, were daily\r\nmade by the needy adventurers, whom chance, or perhaps infamous\r\nservices, had raised to a place in the administration. The public prints\r\nwere polluted by the foulest calumny against every man who had the\r\nvirtue and the courage to oppose a system which he foresaw must\r\neventually terminate in the ruin of the country. Some of the basest of\r\nmankind, distinguished, however, by more than usual talents for\r\nperversion and invective, were appointed to conduct those publications\r\nwhich were paid by the public money for abusing the national character.\r\nThe Whig Club, consisting of noblemen and gentlemen who, by possessing\r\nlarge property and extensive connections in the country, felt themselves\r\nbound to oppose the mad measures of men who, as they were mostly\r\nforeigners, had no interest but to turn the present moment to most\r\nadvantage, were held up to the public, both in and out of Parliament, as\r\nenemies to the tranquillity of the state, and anxious only, at all\r\nevents, to raise themselves to power.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of administration to the Whig Club, indeed, deserves\r\npeculiar confederation, as it evinces, in the fullest manner, that it\r\nwas not the irregular or unconstitutional proceedings of this or that\r\nbody of men--of the Volunteer Convention, or of the United Irish\r\nSociety--but the measures which these bodies recommended, against which\r\nthe influence and force of government was turned. The Whig Club had\r\nformed themselves on the most constitutional and moderate principles.\r\nTheir object was to obtain for the people of Ireland, by a concentration\r\nof their parliamentary influence and exertions, those laws by which the\r\nBritish constitution was guarded, against the encroachments of the\r\nexecutive power; and by the want of which in Ireland, her constitution\r\nseemed to have but a precarious existence at the pleasure of the Court.\r\nSuch were a Pension Bill, for limiting the influence resulting to the\r\nCrown by an indefinite power of granting pensions--a Place Bill, to\r\nsecure the independence of the House of Commons, by making the\r\nacceptance of office by a member a vacation of his seat--a\r\nResponsibility Bill, by which the men intrusted with the management of\r\nthe public treasure, or enjoying high official situations in the\r\ngovernment of the country, should be responsible to Parliament for their\r\nconduct and advice. These were the measures which the Club undertook at\r\ntheir formation to press upon minister. They subsequently adopted\r\nothers on which the sense of the people became too generally known to be\r\nat all doubtful. The question of reform and Catholic emancipation they\r\ndid not take up, until the nation called for them in a manner which\r\nproved the concession of them to be essential to the peace of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOf the constitutionality of those measures which the Whig Club\r\noriginally espoused, no man could entertain a doubt. They were the law\r\nof England. The manner in which these measures were urged by the Whig\r\nClub was equally constitutional. They brought them before Parliament by\r\nbill and by motion, supported by arguments which were answered only by\r\nmajorities consisting of those placemen and pensioners, those borough\r\nmembers and irresponsible officers, against whose parliamentary\r\nexistence they were levelled. This constitutional pursuit of\r\nconstitutional measures--how did the Irish administration treat it? By\r\nimputing the worst motives to those by whom they were proposed--by\r\nimpeaching their loyalty to their Sovereign--by the most open and bold\r\navowal of the existence, and the necessity of corruption in the\r\ngovernment--by the most contumelious indifference for the public voice,\r\nand, finally, by affixing the most disgraceful and irritating marks of\r\nsuspicion on every nobleman and man of property in either house of\r\nParliament, who dared to support those pretensions of the people to the\r\nbenefits of the British constitution. The removal of that good and\r\nestimable character, the Earl of Charlemont, from the office of Governor\r\nof the County of Armagh--an office which might be considered as\r\nhereditary in his family, and to which his estate in that county gave\r\nhim a kind of indefeasible right, is one instance of a number. It will\r\never be remembered as a damning proof of the foolish and wicked\r\nmalignity of the Irish administration against the friends of the Irish\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThese arts of the Castle, however, were unable to counteract or repress\r\nthe persevering effects of the Whig Club. It is not necessary in this\r\nplace to enter into a defence of the motives of that body in thus\r\ncontending for the interests of the public. It is sufficient that the\r\nmeasures which they patronized were in a high degree beneficial to the\r\nIrish nation; and whether they urged them from a wish to raise\r\nthemselves to office, or from a principle of pure patriotism, was to\r\nthe public immaterial. That they supported them zealously and\r\nfaithfully, from whatever motive, was indubitable. _So_ zealously and\r\nfaithfully indeed did they exert themselves, that the very same men who\r\nhad for years made a constant and violent opposition to those measures,\r\nexhausting every epithet of reprobation which the English language\r\nafforded, both against them and their supporters, yet at last found\r\nthemselves obliged to concede them to the unrelaxing vigour of these\r\ngentlemen, supported by the general sense of the country. It is the\r\nconcession of these measures that the friends of the Irish junto call\r\n\"CONCILIATION!\" These are the favours which they say Ireland has\r\nreceived, and which they contend ought for ever to have silenced popular\r\ncomplaint, and put a period to the demands of the country! Had they been\r\nyielded at an earlier time, before the long, long irritation which the\r\nobstinate refusal of them for several successive years had produced,\r\nthey would have been received with gratitude by the nation, and the\r\neffect would have been general tranquillity and content. But the Irish\r\nadministration knew neither how to concede nor withhold--their\r\nresistance was without strength, and their concessions without kindness.\r\nLike the Roman King and the Sybils, they withheld the price of public\r\ncontent, until the people, aggravated by refusal, insisted on still\r\nhigher terms; and, indeed, rose in their demands, beyond what an\r\nadministration, bankrupt in character and confidence, were able to grant\r\nthem. What a Minister of comprehensive mind and enlarged views would\r\nhave granted to the people with magnanimity at once, and what if thus\r\ngranted, would have taken the tongue from discontent, and left\r\ndisaffection no handle to use against the peace of the country, the\r\nIrish administration conceded piece-meal--one little measure after\r\nanother--reluctantly and with hesitation; thus teaching the people that\r\nwhat was granted could not be withheld, and that the same means which\r\nhad extorted one concession from the weakness of government would be\r\nequally successful in extorting others. Nay, at the very moment when\r\nthey were yielding those measures to the perseverance of opposition,\r\nsupported by the public sense, they continued to load those very men by\r\nwhole exertions they had been obtained with scurrilous and foul\r\ninvective; and while with one hand they affected to conciliate the\r\npeople, with the other they scattered the seeds of disaffection widely\r\nthrough the land by the most inflammatory and ill-judged libels upon the\r\ncountry and its claims. Thus, in the hands of those men, the benignity\r\nof the Sovereign was perverted into an instrument of discontent, and\r\nthose rich concessions which, if judiciously administered, would have\r\nbound Ireland to Britain by indissoluble ties, were made means of\r\nexciting in numbers of the inhabitants of that country a deep hatred of\r\nthe British name and connection.\r\n\r\nWhen Englishmen contemplate for a moment this picture of the\r\n\"conciliation\" which the Irish nation has received with so much\r\ningratitude, it is possible they may conclude that nothing has happened\r\nwhich might not have reasonably been expected. Possibly they will think\r\nit not unnatural that the people should have received, with little sense\r\nof obligation, measures which were never conceded until they came to\r\nform only a small part of what was demanded as rights--and that they\r\nshould rather feel indignant at the insult and abuse heaped on them by a\r\nfew contemptible and obscure adventurers, than acknowledge gratitude for\r\nbenefits long kept back, and, at length, reluctantly yielded.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt thus long on the early conduct of the Irish administration\r\nfor two reasons--the one to vindicate the people of Ireland from the\r\ninsolent charge made against them by their enemies--\"That conciliation\r\nhad been tried in vain with that sottish and discontented people--that\r\nthey had not intellect to understand, nor gratitude to acknowledge\r\nbenefits--and that, therefore, the present system of unconstitutional\r\ncoercion and deprivation was resorted to of necessity:\"--the other was\r\nto shew, that whatever discontent has been recently shewn in Ireland,\r\nwhatever crimes have been committed for political purposes, had their\r\nremote origin in that system by which the powers of government had been\r\nabused in Ireland for several years back. Whether I have succeeded in\r\nthis attempt, I leave to Englishmen, who know and value freedom and\r\nconstitution, to determine. For myself I shall only say, that my mind is\r\nincapable of feeling a greater degree of moral certainty, than that the\r\npeople of Ireland are innocent of causeless discontent and of\r\ningratitude; and that all the evils which now lacerate that unhappy\r\ncountry, (for the mere suppression of present discontents will not end\r\nthe danger,) and threaten the mutilation of the empire, are the\r\nnecessary and inevitable effects of the wicked system adopted by the\r\nweak, hot-headed, and petulant men to whom the administration of Ireland\r\nwas entrusted, operating upon a generous and loyal but irritable and\r\nwarm people.\r\n\r\nBut had the Irish junto rested at the point to which we have now come in\r\ndescribing their system, Ireland would not now have to appeal for pity\r\nor for aid to the British nation. It is the subsequent measures to which\r\nthey resorted, and for which no precedent is to be found in the history\r\nof this or any other country pretending to laws, or rights, or\r\nconstitution, that we complain of. It is by these that Ireland has been\r\nlashed into madness, and driven to crimes and to follies which her sober\r\nreason would have looked at with detestation. It shall be now my\r\nbusiness to advert to those measures--to shew that they have generally\r\npreceded those crimes of the people which are alledged to have produced\r\nthem--that they have been severe and desperate beyond what the necessity\r\nof the case called for--that their probable result will be a military\r\ndespotism--that they cannot tranquillize the country but by the\r\ndestruction of every degree of constitutional liberty--that, therefore,\r\nthe people of Great Britain are interested in preventing the progress of\r\nthat system in Ireland--and, finally, that if the two great objects of\r\nthe public in Ireland were honestly and fully conceded, and if the\r\npeople were re-instated in the blessings of the constitution by the\r\nestablishment of a mild and just administration, peace and content would\r\nbe restored to the country, disaffection would vanish, and the\r\nconnection of the two islands become closer and more permanent than\r\never.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the Convention and Gunpowder Acts, and the\r\ndiscontent which these laws had excited. Administration felt, that on\r\nthese questions there was but one opinion amongst the people of Ireland.\r\nThey perceived, that though these acts were of the strongest kind, their\r\noperation would not be adequate to the suppression of the existing and\r\nencreasing discontent; and they therefore resorted to a device, which,\r\nhaving been but too often and too successfully tried in Ireland on\r\nformer occasions, would, it was hoped, be equally successful at present.\r\nA religious feud was excited, and suffered to rage without check or\r\nintermission, until it nearly desolated a whole county. Some petty\r\nquarrels had, a considerable time back, taken place in the county of\r\nArmagh, between a few Catholics and Presbyterians, which, however,\r\nproduced no serious mischief, and were almost instantly terminated\r\neither by the interposition of the magistrates, or by the mutual\r\ncompromise of the parties. Subsequent to this, the county of Armagh\r\nenjoyed the most profound tranquillity, until about this period a party\r\nstarted up on the sudden, without visible motive, without provocation,\r\nand, to the surprize of the people in Ireland, commenced a most\r\noutrageous and unaccountable persecution of the Catholic inhabitants. It\r\nwould shock the ears of an Englishman, and, perhaps, exceed his belief,\r\nwere I to give a minute detail of the ferocious barbarities which were\r\ncommitted by this party. It may suffice to say, that under the name of\r\nOrange-men, and under colour of attachment to the constitution and\r\naffection for the Protestant establishment, they not only burned the\r\nhouses and destroyed the persons of numbers of the unfortunate Catholics\r\nin the heat of blood and fervour of outrage, but with a cool and settled\r\nsystem proceeded to banish the whole of them. Entire districts were\r\nproscribed in a night. Labels were affixed on all the Catholic houses in\r\na village, with the words \"To Connaught or to Hell!\" Nor was the threat\r\nvain;--for in numberless instances where the unfortunate inhabitants\r\nrefused to obey the mandate, their habitations were pulled down or\r\nburned by these bravadoes of the constitution, happy if they thus\r\nescaped personal destruction. In many cases these outrages were\r\naccompanied by plunder; but plunder did not seem to constitute any part\r\nof the system under which the Orange-men acted, unless perhaps the\r\nplunder of arms, to deprive the Catholics of which was one of their\r\nproposed objects.\r\n\r\nWith what reason the Irish administration were charged with having\r\nclandestinely excited, or culpably connived at the excesses of these\r\nmen, the people of England may determine when they hear that the\r\nmagistracy of that country remained for many months inactive spectators\r\nof these scenes; nay, indeed, in some cases, are said to have given\r\ncountenance and support to the offenders, by executing the laws with the\r\nmost inflexible rigour against the Catholics when they happened to fall\r\ninto any casual error in repelling the attacks of their persecutors,\r\nwhile these latter were left in the enjoyment of perfect impunity.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the only circumstance which may assist an Englishman to\r\njudge how far the Irish administration participated in the guilt of\r\nthese disturbances--there is another which seems pretty decisive on\r\nthis point; and that is, that notwithstanding this palpable and\r\nnotorious misconduct of the Armagh magistracy, not one man was turned\r\nout of the commission for his negligence and connivance on those\r\noccasions! What apology did the Irish Chancellor offer for not removing\r\nthose magistrates?--\"That better men could not be found in the country!\"\r\n\r\nThis feud, so malignant in its origin, and so destructive in its\r\nprogress, was possibly expected to have weakened the efficacy of the\r\npopular sentiment against the Irish Ministers, by throwing the different\r\nreligious descriptions to a consideration of their respective and\r\npeculiar interests. It produced a very contrary effect. The persecution\r\ncommenced against the Catholics in Armagh, alarmed the Catholics in\r\nevery quarter of the country; and when they saw such enormities\r\ncommitted against them with impunity, if not with the approbation of the\r\nCastle, they naturally apprehended that a general persecution was\r\ndesigned. They knew, however, that the great body of the Protestants in\r\nIreland were too enlightened to assist in such a scheme--for they had\r\nalready experienced that the rigour of old prejudices was abated, and\r\nthat men now began to consider each other rather as men than as\r\nreligionists.--But they also knew the character of the administration;\r\nand the recent transactions in Armagh and elsewhere, taught them, that\r\nthough they had no reason to fear persecution from the great body of\r\ntheir Protestant fellow-subjects, they were yet not exempt from danger.\r\nThese fears suggested the necessity of drawing still more closely the\r\nbond of union between them and their countrymen of other persuasions.\r\nThe Protestants met them half way in their advances toward a conjunction\r\nof interests--for they perceived, that though the present blow was\r\nstruck against the Catholics, yet the warfare of administration was not\r\nagainst them only, but against the constitution, against the people,\r\ntheir privileges, and their interests.\r\n\r\nHad these been the only consequences that followed this dreadful\r\nexperiment, the partial evil would have been compensated by the union\r\nwhich it produced. But this was not the case. The alarm which the Armagh\r\npersecution produced on the minds of the enlightened Catholics, and on\r\nthe lower orders of that description were very different. In the former\r\nit produced a desire to unite more closely with his Protestant brethren,\r\nin order to form by their conjunction the stronger barrier against the\r\napprehended assault of the Irish Cabinet upon both. In the latter, it\r\nexcited a fear of extermination, which resolved itself into the most\r\nviolent and unjustifiable measures, of what they considered personal\r\ndefence--The Orange-men had deprived the Catholics of their arms--the\r\nlower order of Catholics co-operating in many instances with their\r\nProtestant neighbours of the same rank, who detested the conduct of\r\nOrange-men, betook themselves to retaliate on those whom they considered\r\nsuspected characters. The robbery of arms became a general measure of\r\nsafety, and those who exerted themselves in this way obtained the name\r\nof Defenders--a body of men, whom that administration which suffered the\r\nOrange-men to violate the laws with impunity, followed with the utmost\r\nseverity of legal punishment.\r\n\r\nNo man who values the interests of society, or knows the value of peace\r\nand good order in a community, can be supposed for a moment to justify\r\nthe intemperate and incautious conduct of those deluded men. If such\r\nlicence as they usurped were permitted, human society must be dissolved,\r\nand man be thrown back to a state of savage nature. But on the other\r\nhand, no man who has any regard for truth, or who enjoys a capacity of\r\ndistinguishing between different ideas, can deny, that the crimes of the\r\nDefenders were provoked by the preceding crimes of the Orange-men, and\r\nthat those powers which, contrary to justice, were suffered to lie\r\ndormant against the one class, whose guilt was original and unprovoked,\r\nwere exercised without mercy against the latter; whose errors were the\r\nebullition of untaught nature repelling in an untaught way, the most\r\nwanton and unparalleled aggression.\r\n\r\nThere were some collateral circumstances which contributed to give full\r\neffect to the impression which the enormities of the Orange society were\r\ncalculated to make on the minds of the lower orders. The severity with\r\nwhich administration had followed the United Irishmen by dispersing\r\ntheir meetings, seizing their papers, and prosecuting as libels every\r\npublication which emanated from them, had driven them to the necessity\r\nof meeting secretly, and admitting members into their society in a\r\nprivate and mysterious manner. Between secret meetings and conspiracy\r\nthe interval is small--between meeting secretly for constitutional\r\npurposes and meeting to alter or overthrow the constitution, the\r\ninterval is perhaps still less. Whether the objects or the United Irish\r\nsocieties were at this period unconstitutional or not, it is certain the\r\nmeetings were clandestine, and that of the lower class of people numbers\r\nflocked to them who were admitted only on condition of taking an oath to\r\nbe true to the body--_i. e._ to keep its secrets, and to devote\r\nthemselves to the pursuit of the two great popular objects--Catholic\r\nEmancipation and Parliamentary Reform. The impression which the minds of\r\nthe lower order of the people would be apt to receive at the discussion\r\nof these meetings cannot be considered as very likely to mitigate their\r\nzeal in opposition to the persecutors of the Catholics, or to form their\r\nminds to receive with patient forbearance the severities which were now\r\nevery where exercised indiscriminately against the United Irishmen and\r\nDefenders--terms which, in the indiscriminating language of the senate\r\nand the Castle, were considered as synonymous.\r\n\r\nIn considering the effect which the extensive and secret meetings of the\r\nUnited Irishmen produced on the dispositions of the lower people it is\r\nnot necessary to ascertain whether the designs of that body were or were\r\nnot treasonable. It is sufficient that were they precisely limited to\r\ntheir professed objects, emancipation and reform, the effect of them on\r\nthe mass of the public by whom they were constituted must be adverse to\r\nthe system which administration had adopted, and which they now began to\r\nforce on the nation by means the most unjustifiable.\r\n\r\nIf this statement of facts, which I have now submitted to the English\r\nnation, as demonstrative that the Irish administration were themselves\r\nthe authors of those enormities which they have since made a pretext for\r\nintroducing fire and sword through the country--if this statement, I\r\nsay, be true, and I defy any part of it to be disproved, their guilt and\r\nthe emptiness of the pretences by which they have endeavoured to screen\r\nit, are incontrovertible:\r\n\r\nWhat was the next measure of administration? The Insurrection Act. The\r\noutrages which commenced in Armagh, and had been but too successfully,\r\nthough faintly, imitated in several parts of the country, administration\r\nnow affected to consider as incurable by any of the ordinary powers with\r\nwhich the law invested the executive authority. A law was therefore\r\npropounded and adopted, by which any district which the magistrates of\r\nit might think proper to declare in a state of disturbance, or in\r\nimmediate danger of becoming so, (phrases so vague that it required but\r\nlittle artifice to make them applicable at that time to any county in\r\nthe kingdom,) was put into such a state of regimen, that any individual\r\nmagistrate might on his own authority, without trial or proof, seize the\r\nperson of any inhabitant and send him to serve on board his Majesty's\r\nfleet--_i. e._ transport him for life.\r\n\r\nIn such districts the privileges of the constitution with respect to\r\nliberty, and I may add, life, were completely suspended; for whether\r\nunder pretended authority derived from this act, or from the\r\nsuperabundant zeal of the military protectors of the public peace, who\r\nwere employed to assist in the execution of it, numbers fell, either by\r\nbeing shot at their own doors, or by the newly-invented process of\r\nstrangulation, adopted to procure confession of crimes which perhaps had\r\nnever been committed, or the accusation of others, whose innocence might\r\nhave made it impossible to convict them by other evidence.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into a more minute detail of the disgusting enormities\r\nor the sufferings to which this measure gave birth, I may safely refer\r\nit to the judgement of men accustomed to enjoy the uninterrupted\r\nblessings of British law and liberty, whether the infliction of this\r\nmeasure on the people of Ireland was not of itself enough to aggravate\r\nfeelings already irritated into discontent the most alarming. I do not\r\nmean surely to justify assassination or treason, but I appeal to men who\r\nhave the feelings of freemen, whether to see a father, a brother, or a\r\nson, fall, perhaps innocently, under the bayonet of a military\r\nexecutioner, or transported for life from his helpless family and\r\nnearest connections--it may be without guilt, because the punishment was\r\ninflicted without trial--may not in some degree account for, though it\r\ncannot justify, the shocking crimes which have, since the introduction\r\nof that measure, been committed by individuals in Ireland? A magistrate\r\nwho exerts himself in carrying this law into effect, and who, in\r\nobedience to the will of the legislature, sends numbers of his\r\ncountrymen from the soil in which they drew breath, and the connections\r\nwhich make life dear to them, merely because he suspects their loyalty,\r\ndoes that which, being legal, ought not to induce on him either odium or\r\npunishment; but while human nature shall continue to be composed of its\r\npresent materials, there will be found men among the people over whom he\r\nexerts such authority, whose vindictive passions will be apt to mark him\r\nas their victim. In many deplorable instances has this been verified in\r\nIreland. The Insurrection Act was adopted to prevent such enormities;\r\nunhappily it but encreased, greatly encreased, the black catalogue.\r\n\r\nI ask unprejudiced men, whether these measures, carried into execution\r\nagainst a people who from the recent acquisition of independence felt\r\nmuch of the pride and sensibility of freedom, were not most likely to be\r\nattended with the consequences which have followed? What then, I ask,\r\nmust have been the effect of that measure, at which freedom and justice\r\nfeels still more abhorrence--a legal indemnity for all crimes committed\r\nagainst the people, under colour of preserving the peace? Good heavens!\r\nwas it not enough that a law was passed which left the subjects' liberty\r\nand person at the mercy of the magistrates--but must the military or\r\ncivil tyrant be protected _by_ law _against_ law, in the perpetration\r\nof acts which even by the spirit of that act would be illegal and\r\noppressive? The first Bill of Indemnity Was designed to protect my Lord\r\nCarhampton, who had played the part of a self-created Dictator in\r\nIreland. What the particular measures pursued by his Lordship were, I\r\nshall not enumerate. They are known, and I believe will be remembered by\r\nboth countries. He is indemnified for his zeal; and his measures,\r\ninstead of quieting, have been unfortunately found to have produced a\r\ncontrary effect. From that time to the present, Bills of Indemnity have\r\nbecome an established part of the system of government in Ireland; so\r\nthat he who can contrive means to cover the most malicious and\r\noppressive crimes by the easy pretext of securing the public peace, may\r\nrest as firmly on an act to indemnify him in the succeeding session, as\r\nthe public creditor may depend on the passing of the money bills.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating these successive steps which have been taken in Ireland,\r\nprofessedly to tranquillize the country, but which have operated only to\r\nrender it outrageous, I might have mentioned the appointment and the\r\nrecall of my Lord Fitzwilliam. But in speaking to the people of England\r\nit were superfluous to dwell on that event; for with the circumstances\r\nof _that_, _they_, as well as the people of Ireland, are acquainted. I\r\nshall therefore content myself with saying, that of the many irritating\r\nmeasures which have goaded Ireland, the recall of my Lord Fitzwilliam\r\nwas the most mischievously efficacious. With that nobleman, Hope fled\r\nfrom the country. What has since followed has been the counsel of\r\nDespair. By that event it was placed beyond doubt, that the Cabinets of\r\nthe two countries formed a junction against reform--against the\r\nrestoration of the constitution to Ireland--and against a mitigation of\r\nthe coercive system. If treason have spread widely through the\r\ncountry--if the friends of the French system have become numerous, it\r\nmust be since that insulting act of the British Cabinet told the people,\r\nthat if they felt the pressure of present evils, or looked for a further\r\nextension of constitutional rights, their hope must be turned to another\r\nquarter than to the influence of the British connection.\r\n\r\nBy the operation of the measures which I have now described, the Irish\r\npeople and the Irish administration were put at issue. The system to\r\nwhich the Castle had resorted to silence murmur, had produced\r\noutrage--the measures which they took to punish outrage had created\r\nconspiracy, assassination, and, in many instances, treason. Throughout\r\nthe whole process of discontent, I have shewed that administration were\r\naggressors, and that the irregularities which have followed were but the\r\nreaction of an high and irritable spirit in the people, compressed by\r\ncoercion, which left no vent to its feelings but in acts of private or\r\npublic violence.\r\n\r\nAt this point the administration found it necessary to pause. The\r\nmeasures which they had already tried to smother the discontents of the\r\npeople, and to repress those violent and illegal consequences of it, had\r\nnot only proved ineffectual, but had aggravated, to a most alarming\r\nheight, the mischiefs which they were sottishly expected to remedy. In\r\nalmost every part of the country the most extreme disorder prevailed. It\r\nwas not now a Volunteer Convention, consisting of men of known loyalty\r\nand great stake in the country, meeting to petition for reform--it was\r\nnot now a Catholic Convention sitting in Dublin, pursuing open and\r\nconstitutional measures to obtain elective franchise, or a full\r\nadmission to the privileges of the constitution--it was not, I say,\r\nsuch bodies as these that administration had to cope with. They had put\r\ndown those. Other more numerous and more dangerous difficulties were now\r\nto be encountered. The populace of the country was now organized, and an\r\n_imperium in imperio_ formed, which, from its privacy and the numbers of\r\nwhich it consisted, was truly alarming. The professed objects of this\r\nsociety, the most singular which perhaps had ever been formed in any\r\ncountry, still continued what they originally were--Reform and\r\nEmancipation. But papers were found which were supposed to prove, that\r\ntheir designs were more dangerous and more extensive; and a letter from\r\na Mr. Tone, which clearly expressed a treasonable opinion respecting a\r\nseparation of the two countries was taken as full evidence that this was\r\nthe sentiment of the society at large, consisting, as was believed, of\r\nnot less than 600,000 men. Whatever might be _their_ real designs, it\r\nwas certain, that the conduct of the Orange-men of Armagh had been\r\nsuccessfully imitated by the peasantry in many parts of Ireland. The\r\nplunder of arms was carried on systematically; the quantity taken was\r\nknown to be considerable; and in the proclaimed districts several\r\nmagistrates who had been active in transporting suspected persons, &c.\r\n&c. had been assassinated.\r\n\r\nIn this critical moment, the best and wisest men in Ireland, gentlemen\r\npossessed of the most extensive property in the country, and at the same\r\ntime of character above the slightest imputation of disaffection or\r\nloyalty, urged on administration the necessity of changing that system\r\nwhich had been found to produce such horrible effects. They urged, that\r\nthe great body of the nation was loyal--that even of the United Irishmen\r\nthe greater part wished only for the admission of the Catholics and\r\nreform--and that to concede these would throw such a weight into the\r\nscale of government as would effectually tranquillize the country.\r\nAdministration, however, took up the contrary opinion, and decided on a\r\ncontinuation of coercive measures. They pretended, that the people of\r\nIreland were rebels, and that with rebels conciliation should not be\r\ntried. They assumed, in the first place, that all the United Irishmen\r\nwere traitors--in the second, that that society comprehended the great\r\nbody of the people, or that those who were not of that body approved\r\nheartily of all the measures which had been carried on for some years\r\nback by the Irish Cabinet. No account was made of that great and\r\nrespectable class of men who, while they looked with detestation on\r\nthose acts of insubordination, of assassination, and treason, which had\r\nfollowed the adoption of the present system, contemplated with the most\r\nunqualified reprobation that system itself. Determined, therefore, to\r\nscourge the nation out of that ill temper into which the scourge had\r\ndriven it, what step did administration fix on? They send a military\r\nforce under General Lake to the province of Ulster, and enjoin him to\r\nact at his discretion for disarming the freemen of the North, and\r\nenforcing content and tranquillity at the point of the bayonet!\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to waste much reasoning on this measure. The\r\nconstitution prescribes the interposition of the sword only in cases of\r\nopen insurrection or rebellion. If the province of Ulster was in that\r\nstate, what indignation must not the two countries feel at the wicked\r\npertinacity of the Irish Cabinet in a system which led to that issue? If\r\nit were not in rebellion, what punishment could be too great for those\r\nwho resorted without necessity to that last and dreadful remedy--a\r\nmilitary force vested with discretionary powers, for disorders properly\r\nwithin the cognizance of the civil magistrate? But the administration\r\njustify themselves by the plea, that the proceedings of these United\r\nIrishmen were too subtle and cautious to be met by the ordinary\r\nexertions of the civil power, though they were not yet in open\r\nrebellion. They must take the praise, therefore, of having created a new\r\nspecies of opposition to established government, hitherto unknown, by\r\ndirecting, without intermission, the force of the state not against open\r\nviolence, but against political principle; by warring, not with men\r\nwhose aim was anarchy and plunder, but men skilled in, and zealous for,\r\nthe perfection of the representative system.\r\n\r\nBut I deny that Ulster was in such a state as to justify the measure\r\nthat was then taken--for it was not in open and avowed rebellion, nor\r\nwas the system of the disorderly people in that province either too\r\nsubtle or too strong for an active magistracy, constitutionally aided by\r\nthe military. The disturbances amounted to nothing more than the\r\nassemblage now and then of parties of people on the original principle\r\nof the Orange-men (who to the disgrace of legislature, have, in a\r\ncertain place, more than once, been called the friends of the\r\nconstitution,) breaking houses and plundering arms; and I contend, that\r\nwith a proper force left always at the disposal and under the direction\r\nof active magistrates, those individual acts of outrage might have been\r\nprevented. The pretext, that the magistrates were terrified from acting\r\nby frequent assassination, is empty--courage is not exclusively the\r\nboast of the military in Ireland; and every country in which the\r\nInsurrection Act has been carried into operation has produced numbers of\r\nmagistrates who dared to meet all the odium and all the danger which the\r\nexecution of that unpopular act imposed on them.\r\n\r\nUnder this Proclamation, Gen. Lake deprived of arms not only the\r\ntraiterous and the disaffected, but the loyal and most zealous friends\r\nof the constitution. Where arms were expected and not found, a very new\r\nmode of trial was instituted. The suspected or accused person was\r\nsuspended by the neck until the process of strangulation was nearly\r\ncompleted. He was then let down, and if he was still pertinacious, the\r\ntouchstone was again tried, until he either confessed or accused others.\r\nIn other cases, it was ascertained what quantity of arms should be\r\nbrought in by a certain village or district--if the full quantity could\r\nnot be produced by the inhabitants, their habitations were reduced to\r\nashes to detect the concealment. These seem to have been ordinary modes\r\nof proceeding under the military system; there were others more\r\nirregular and eccentric which the zeal of the soldiers frequently\r\nprompted them to indulge in.\r\n\r\nOf the system thus steadily pursued by the Irish administration, the\r\nIrish legislature expressed their most hearty and zealous\r\napprobation.--Throughout the whole train of violent measures to which\r\nthe Irish administration resorted, the Irish Parliament went with them\r\n_pari passu_. Without stopping to enquire whether this co-operation of\r\nthe legislature tended rather to reconcile the people to the system than\r\nto encrease the discontents which it was naturally calculated to\r\nproduce, it is certain that some very celebrated characters, whose\r\nopinions in this case deserve to be respected, had declared the most\r\ndecided disapprobation of at least that part of it which related to the\r\nmilitary. The conduct of my Lord Moira, in the Parliament of both\r\ncountries, himself a soldier, an Irish nobleman, and one possessed of\r\nsuch a stake in the country as must make him anxious for its welfare\r\nand its peace, has already perhaps inclined the British public to doubt\r\nwhether the enormities practised under that system were tolerable in any\r\ncountry. The manly and candid opinion of the brave old Abercrombie,\r\n\"That the conduct of the army in Ireland was calculated to make them\r\nformidable only to their friends,\" must have also had its weight in\r\nascertaining the merits of that system. That the feelings and the honour\r\nof that venerable officer did not suffer him longer to remain in the\r\ncommand of the Irish army, Ireland will long have reason to lament. The\r\ninfluence of even _one_ such mind on Irish politics would have produced\r\nthe most important benefits.\r\n\r\nFor some time the administration boasted that they had at length found\r\nthe way to quiet the country. In fact, the operations of the military in\r\nUlster did reduce that province to a state of peace, and no disturbance\r\nexisted but what the army itself created. Less violent and\r\nunconstitutional measures would have prevented acts of outrage--but\r\nneither this, nor any measure of coercion, could have eradicated\r\ndiscontent. As the infliction of the military system produced a gloomy\r\nquiet in one part of the island, the disturbances broke out with much\r\nencreased enormity in other parts of the country.--The South, hitherto\r\ntranquil, and which at the moment of danger, when the enemy appeared on\r\nthe coast a few months before, exhibited the most enthusiastic spirit of\r\nzeal and loyalty, now became convulsed by partial risings to an alarming\r\ndegree. The interior of the country, the King's and Queen's County, the\r\nCounty of Kildare, and even the vicinity of the metropolis, the Counties\r\nof Wicklow and of Dublin, were now in as bad a state as the pacified\r\nNorth had ever been. Every reasonable man, who believes that nothing can\r\nbe produced without a producing cause, must attribute this change of\r\ntemper in the South and other parts of the country to some circumstance\r\nwhich did not exist at the time of the invasion; and that circumstance\r\ncould only be the introduction of the military system--of the efficacy\r\nof which administration had so much vaunted. But powerful as they\r\nsupposed that system to be, they were not inclined to depend on its\r\nefficacy, such as they had tried it. They therefore now resorted to a\r\nmeasure which has hitherto been used only by irritated victors over\r\nperfidious and vanquish'd enemies--they sent them troops, not to disarm\r\nthe inhabitants of a district, or to act with discretionary powers for,\r\nwhat was now a general pretext for violence of every species, the\r\npreservation of the public peace; but permanently to live at free\r\nquarters on all the inhabitants of those counties which were in what was\r\ncalled a disturbed state. Under this measure, excesses were committed\r\nwhich Ireland, much as she had suffered, had not yet witnessed. It was\r\nnot the burning of a peasant's house, or the strangulation of one or two\r\nindividuals in a village, which struck the eye of a spectator--but the\r\nhouses of the most respectable farmers in the country, nay, houses of\r\ngentlemen of large fortune, and, in many instances, of the most approved\r\nloyalty, converted into barracks by the soldiery--the females of the\r\nfamily flying from the insults of these new guests, who rioted on the\r\nprovision, emptied the cellars of their unwilling hosts, and when they\r\nhad exhausted the house which they occupied sent their mandate to the\r\nneighbourhood to bring in a fresh stock!\r\n\r\nAt this point I stop--for here the fate of Ireland comes to its crisis.\r\nThis measure was in operation not three weeks, when the rebels, the\r\ntraitors, or the people of Ireland, to the sorrow of every friend to\r\npeace, to the Irish name, and to the British connection, stood forth in\r\nopposition to the King's troops. The scene of blood is now opened.\r\nIreland is wasting her vital strength in convulsion; and whether victory\r\nor defeat await them, humanity, loyalty, and patriotism must weep over\r\nthe event!\r\n\r\nWhen I solicit the people of England attentively to consider that long\r\ntrain of harsh and hideous measures which I have now enumerated, and\r\nwhich have brought Ireland into this lamentable condition--when I call\r\non them to examine with anxious care the motives in which they\r\noriginated, and the end to which they lead--I call on them to attend to\r\nthat in which they are deeply interested. In my mind they have been\r\nadopted but for one purpose--to raise on the broad basis of CORRUPT\r\nINFLUENCE a system of government, which, under the form of the British\r\nconstitution, should stand independent of, and in opposition to, the\r\nsense of the nation. I rest this opinion on two grounds--The one is,\r\nbecause each successive measure taken up by administration to counteract\r\nthe wishes of the people, carried in it features of despotism, which in\r\na free country the necessity of the case could not call for. Every bill\r\nof pains and penalties to which they resorted involved and asserted a\r\ngeneral and permanent principle, or gave the Executive a general and\r\nextraordinary power, inconsistent with the spirit of the constitution,\r\nthough the occasions which gave rise to those measures were but partial\r\nor transient. I refer for instances to the Convention Act, the\r\nInsurrection Act, the Gunpowder Act, and the Press Bill, a measure\r\nwhich, in my enumeration of the violent steps taken by the Irish\r\ngovernment, escaped me, though perhaps it is, of all the dreadful\r\ngroupe, the most prominent and most fatal to liberty and the\r\nconstitution.--The other reason on which my opinion rests is, because\r\nadministration have persevered in that system without making any one\r\neffort to allay discontent or satisfy the moderate and loyal part of the\r\ncommunity by the concession of any of those measures on which the heart\r\nof the nation was fixed--because they have gone on in opposition to the\r\nsense of the best men in the empire to force the people of Ireland, or\r\nthe discontented part of it, into open and avowed rebellion, rather than\r\ntry any means to prevent that catastrophe by conciliating\r\nmeasures--because this intention was avowed and gloried in[2]--and,\r\nfinally, because from the outset of their career they have resorted to\r\nmilitary coercion in every case where they could find, or create, the\r\nslightest pretence for the use of that dreadful engine.\r\n\r\nThe flame which by these means has been kindled in Ireland can be\r\nextinguished but in one of two ways--either the rebels aided by the\r\npower of France will succeed in wresting Ireland from the British\r\nconnection, or the military force with which the Irish government is\r\nentrusted will stifle in blood the discontents of the country. Of the\r\nfirst there is happily no danger. The numbers of the insurgents is much\r\ntoo small to endanger the connection, and that moderate and loyal party,\r\nwhich administration have hitherto treated with contempt, is too strong\r\nand too much attached to the present form of government, notwithstanding\r\nwhat they had suffered, either to be overcome by the force, or seduced\r\nby the artifice of disaffection, to forego their allegiance. There\r\nremains then only the other alternative--and of that what will be the\r\neffect? Rebellion will be quelled by power, but the existing causes of\r\ndiscontent--those causes which through a long series of petty conflicts\r\nhave at length terminated in the present dreadful issue, will remain\r\nrankling in the bosom of the country. Conscious of its force,\r\nadministration will, with an high hand, bear still more hard on the\r\nconstitutional rights of the people--at least against those rights which\r\nare calculated to guard them against the tyranny of an ambitious\r\nfaction. Knowing the hatred which the Irish nation bear to the set who\r\nhave heaped on her head those calamities under which she now groans, and\r\nof which centuries will not remove the effects, will the Irish\r\nadministration, think you, resign that extraordinary unconstitutional\r\nforce which in course of the struggle they have acquired? Impossible! If\r\nwe can reason at all on the event, it is most reasonable to believe,\r\nthat the military system which shall have subdued the discontents of\r\nIreland, will continue to govern it. Will it be for the safety, or for\r\nthe honour of England that her sister country should be a military\r\ndespotism?\r\n\r\nIn one event only, then, does there appear to be a gleam of hope that\r\nIreland may yet become a free, happy, and contented member of the\r\nBritish empire--and that is, in a suppression of the present\r\ninsurrection--in a change of the men by whom the affairs of Ireland have\r\nbeen for some years so abominably administered--and in a change of that\r\nsystem which has hitherto been pursued by them. If Englishmen value\r\ntheir own liberty, which the contiguity of despotism must always hazard,\r\nor feel sympathy for the sufferings of an unfortunate people, whose\r\nattachment to Britain has been proved during the course of an anxious\r\nand changeful century, to these objects will they direct their efforts.\r\n\r\nAlready thousands of the people of Ireland have fallen in the\r\ncontest--and yet the standard of rebellion is erect. More of the blood\r\nof Ireland must be shed, before Ireland, under the present system, is\r\nrestored to peace. A military chief governor has been sent over, not to\r\nappease but to subdue. He _may_ subdue--but is it the pride of a British\r\nKing to rule a depopulated, a desolated, and a discontented country?\r\nWill fire and sword restore content and confidence to the land? Will the\r\nslaughter of a hundred thousand of the people of Ireland reconcile the\r\nsurvivors to that system of mal-government which they have risen to\r\noppose? Will the faction which has provoked this scene of slaughter,\r\nbecome more popular by the carnage they have occasioned?\r\n\r\nEnglishmen!--your fellow subjects of Ireland now call on you to\r\nconsider the case of a distracted country, as that of brethren united by\r\nthe tie of a common nature, and by the still closer tie of a common\r\nSovereign; both entitled to the advantages of the same constitution,\r\neach depending, in some measure, on the others strength. For one hundred\r\nyears you have found in the people of Ireland a faithful and firm\r\nfriend--though for much of that period we laboured under the most\r\ndistressing disadvantages, destitute of the means of wealth, and aliens\r\nfrom the most important benefits of the British constitution, we have\r\nyet borne our sufferings with patient and uncomplaining attachment to a\r\nBritish Sovereign, and to the British cause. In our poverty we still\r\ncontributed to the exigencies of the empire. When an extension of our\r\nmeans enabled us to give more largely towards the common stock, we\r\npoured forth our blood and treasure in the cause of Britain with more\r\nthan the zeal of brothers. In our fallen state, with an island reeking\r\nwith blood, and the sword at our throat, directed by an administration\r\nin the best and in the worst of times hostile to Ireland, we call upon\r\nyou to assist in rescuing our country from utter and irretrievable\r\nruin--we implore you to interfere for us with our common Sovereign--to\r\nsolicit at his paternal hand the removal of those wicked men, who by\r\nabusing the confidence of their Sovereign, and sacrificing their duty to\r\nhis people, to the gratification of ambitious views or native\r\nmalevolence, have belied the Irish nation; and by their obstinate and\r\nrelentless cruelty have driven it to madness. We conjure you to think of\r\nus as of men enamoured of liberty and animated by that zealous\r\nattachment to monarchy, limited by law, which has given immortality to\r\nthe name of Englishmen--though at the same time, as of men, among whom\r\nmany have been hurried into unpardonable indiscretions while the great\r\nbody remain a loyal, though a suffering people.--In a word, we solicit\r\nyour sympathy as brethren, and your influence as fellow subjects, with\r\nthe common Father of both kingdoms, to save four millions of people from\r\nthe insulting tyranny of Ministers who have abused their powers, and,\r\ninstead of the mild genius of the British constitution, have governed by\r\nthe galling despotism of a military mob!\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Vide Irish Chancellor's speech on Lord Moira's motion.\r\n\r\n[2] See Mr. J.
