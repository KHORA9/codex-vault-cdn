The United States,\r\nindeed, is still in the process of fusion following the earlier fission\r\nprocess. It has not yet reached the stability that comes to some nations\r\nin history, and which is marked by a fixed pattern of population growth,\r\nland use, day-to-day habits, and philosophic beliefs. It is, rather, a\r\ncountry in which every generation can look back to a strangely different\r\nera that existed before it came of age.\r\n\r\nThe period 1625-1660 in Virginia history is an important one for the\r\nstudy of the fission-fusion process in America. During those years\r\nVirginia's population increased perhaps twenty-five or thirty fold, and\r\nthe settlements spread from a thin belt along the James River to the\r\nwhole of Tidewater Virginia. Human atoms were propelled outwards in\r\nevery direction in an uncontrolled and only feebly directed expansion.\r\n\r\nThe years 1607 to 1625 had created a base for this expansion. Those had\r\nbeen crucial years and difficult ones. Settlements had resembled\r\nmilitary camps and individual colonists had been commanded like\r\nsoldiers. Rigorous administration of justice, fear of the Indians, and\r\nthe strict economic regulations imposed by the London Company had served\r\nto restrain the potentially expansive nature of the colonists.\r\n\r\nThe year 1625 saw Virginia under a new King and under a new form of\r\ngovernment. The charter of the London Company was made void, and the\r\ncolony passed from the control of a commercial company to the direct\r\ncontrol of King Charles I.\r\n\r\nThe official census of the non-Indian population of Virginia in 1625\r\nshowed 1,232 persons in the colony. Nine hundred and fifty-two were\r\nmales, twelve of them Negroes. Two hundred and eighty were females,\r\neleven of them Negroes. Although the colony had been in existence for\r\neighteen years the fissioning process had hardly begun. But it was\r\nbeginning. Five years later the population had more than doubled to\r\napproximately 3,000. In 1640 the population jumped to 8,000, and by 1670\r\nto 40,000, of whom 2,000 were Negroes. Every aspect of Virginia\r\nlife--political, physical, economic, social, and moral--was to be\r\naffected by this explosive and uncontrolled growth.\r\n\r\nVirginia did not develop any cities or even towns during the period\r\n1625-1660. Indeed, the towns, such as Jamestown and Henrico, that had\r\nearlier been established, declined in population or were totally\r\nabandoned. The immigrants who were funneled into the colony through\r\nJamestown were soon attracted to the ever widening frontier. During the\r\nfirst twenty years colonists had lived in organized farming communities,\r\nseparated from other such settlements, but strictly supervised by local\r\n\"plantation commanders.\" The separate settlements were variously called\r\n\"colonies,\" \"plantations,\" \"hundreds,\" and \"particular plantations,\" and\r\nsometimes contained hundreds of planters. Frequently the \"plantation\"\r\nwas located within a loop of the James River. The members of the\r\nsettlement planted their crops within the loop, and set up palisades and\r\nforts at the open end for their common defense. Sentinels and guards\r\nwere provided cooperatively to man the defenses. As the settlers\r\nincreased in numbers and the power of their governors and of the Indians\r\nto restrain them decreased, however, they tended to leave the organized\r\ncommunities and to carve out for themselves individual plantations in\r\nthe wilderness. Thus, even while the population of the colony grew by\r\nleaps and bounds, the population of Jamestown and other areas where\r\npopulation was once concentrated declined. It was a process, one might\r\ncall it, of de-urbanization.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that reversed the process of urbanization that was going on\r\nin the mother country? The attraction was, of course, the land and its\r\nfruits. England, with her five or six millions, was not overpopulated by\r\nmodern standards. Nor was she overpopulated by comparison with the great\r\nnations of the Orient such as China which could even in that period\r\ncount its population in the hundreds of millions. But her few millions\r\nseemed at times to oppress the English soil. On the other hand, America\r\nwas a relatively new home of the human species. Perhaps less than a\r\nmillion Indians lived within the present bounds of the United States,\r\nand the Indians with whom the English in Virginia came in contact\r\nnumbered less than 10,000. \"In the beginning all the world was America,\"\r\nwrote John Locke, and the English townsmen, villagers, and yeomen who\r\ncame to America found it natural to revert back to the time when Adam\r\nwent forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was\r\ntaken. It would be more truthful to say, however, that the English went\r\nnot so much in sorrow as in confidence, as the sons of Abraham to whom\r\nGod had promised all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession.\r\n\r\nTobacco was the richest fruit of the land. Despite the moral opprobrium\r\nin which the \"vile, stinking weed\" was held by men in England, including\r\nKing James himself, the public soon developed an insatiable appetite for\r\nit. Having for the Europeans the attraction of novelty and utility, it\r\ncommanded an enormous price in the early years of the settlement. With\r\nSpanish tobacco selling at eighteen shillings a pound in 1619, the\r\nopportunities for gain from tobacco production seemed unlimited. Here\r\nwas the \"gold\" that Virginia had to offer, and soon all hands could\r\nthink of nothing else. The earliest settlers, hoping to emulate the\r\nSpaniards in finding great treasures and living off the labor of the\r\nIndians, had suffered bitterly from shortages of food. Later settlers,\r\nthough they did not hold to the expectations of the first arrivals,\r\nstill sought the avenue of quickest and greatest gain, and tobacco\r\nprovided that avenue. Throughout the 1620's many planters neglected to\r\ngrow corn or wheat, preferring to obtain their food supply by barter or\r\nseizure from the Indians, or by purchase from planters who were willing\r\nto divert their labor to such crops. Who would bother with grain when\r\ntobacco sold for as much per pound as grain did per bushel? Frenchmen,\r\nbrought over to introduce vine-growing in the colony, neglected their\r\nspecialty to plant tobacco and had to be restrained by an act of\r\nFebruary 1632. An act of February 1633 similarly required all gunsmiths,\r\nbrickmakers, carpenters, joiners, sawyers, and turners to work at their\r\ntrades and not to plant tobacco or do other work in the ground.\r\n\r\nAnother booklet in this series deals with agriculture in Virginia. It is\r\nenough to say here that as the total production of tobacco increased so\r\ndid the price decline. Our present-day farm surplus problem is not new.\r\nEven when the price had plummeted to a penny a pound the planters were\r\nnot discouraged from planting. Attempts were made on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic to fix prices and to control the amount of production in order\r\nto restore prosperity to the tobacco farmers. The important questions\r\nwere whose interests would be served, and how would they be served best?\r\n\r\nThe death of James I and the dissolution of the Virginia Company\r\noccurred almost at the same time. Charles I, his son, assumed the throne\r\nin 1625 and promptly assured the planters that though the form of\r\nVirginia's government had changed, the individual planters could be sure\r\nthat their rights and property would be respected. Charles informed the\r\ncolonists, however, that he would take over the buying of their tobacco\r\nas a royal monopoly and give them such prices as would satisfy and\r\nencourage them. Agreement with the planters, nevertheless, was difficult\r\nto obtain. The Virginians were solidly united as a special interest in\r\nfavoring the highest prices and the greatest production. Their\r\nrepresentatives, both in the House of Burgesses and on the Council, were\r\ntheir ardent spokesmen, themselves planters, whose interest lay in\r\nfighting the battle of all Virginians. On the other hand the King, and\r\nthe English merchants and associates through whom he dealt, desired to\r\nbuy Virginia's tobacco at the lowest possible prices and in moderate\r\nquantities. The tug of war between the two sides continued for many\r\nyears without any clear-cut resolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA UNDER WYATT AND YEARDLEY, 1625-1627: TOBACCO AND DEFENSE\r\n\r\nSir Francis Wyatt, who had been the London Company's Governor in the\r\nperiod 1621-1624, was appointed Governor by James I the first year the\r\ncolony was under royal control. Although the King made no specific\r\nprovision for the continuation of a representative Assembly, Wyatt and\r\nthe Council called together representatives of the various settlements\r\nto meet in a General Assembly on May 10, 1625, in Jamestown. There they\r\ndrew up a petition complaining of the old Company rule and the miserable\r\nstate in which it had kept the colony during the previous twelve years,\r\nand pleading with the King not to allow a monopoly of the tobacco trade.\r\nThe King's advisers, they feared, were those who had formerly oppressed\r\nthem and who would do so again should the King consent to a \"pernitious\r\ncontract\" taking all their tobacco at unfair rates. To present their\r\ncase against the contract they chose Sir George Yeardley, former\r\nGovernor, to go to England as their agent. The willingness of Wyatt and\r\nthe Council to call such an Assembly and the unanimity of views deriving\r\nfrom it, show how single in their economic interests all Virginians\r\nwere.\r\n\r\nGovernor Wyatt attempted to prevent disorderly expansion of settlement\r\nand to build positions of strength in the colony, but he knew that the\r\n\"affection\" of the planters to \"their privat dividents\" was too strong a\r\nforce to resist. Hence he recommended that a palisade be built from\r\nMartin's Hundred on the James River to Chiskiack on the York River,\r\nwith houses spaced along it at convenient intervals. In this way the\r\nIndians might be kept out of the entire lower portion of the peninsula,\r\nthe cattle kept in, and the colony provided with a secure base for the\r\ndevelopment of its economy. After the economy was flourishing, there\r\nwould be a chance for finding the riches in the mountains to the west\r\nand the longed-for passage to the South Sea, so confidently believed to\r\nlie just beyond the Appalachians. All these enterprises presupposed the\r\n\"winning of the Forest\" between the York and the James, which Wyatt\r\nhoped to accomplish by means of his palisade scheme.\r\n\r\nWyatt's project was not immediately put into effect. In 1626 he was\r\nreplaced by Sir George Yeardley. Yeardley, like Wyatt, devoted much of\r\nhis time to devising means to promote the security of the colony against\r\nattack by land or by sea.\r\n\r\nIt is hard for us to realize how desperately concerned with their\r\nsecurity were the few thousand Englishmen who inhabited Virginia at this\r\ntime. Separated from the mother country by 3,000 miles of ocean, a\r\ndangerous crossing usually taking two months, the settlers had only a\r\nprecarious toe hold on a vast continent. From the ocean side the\r\nsettlers feared possible attack from other European colonizing powers:\r\nthe Spanish, French, or Dutch. The Spanish ambassador in London in the\r\nearly period of the Virginia settlement had frequently urged his\r\ngovernment to wipe out the struggling colony. But the indecision of\r\nSpain's monarch had saved the colony.\r\n\r\nThe Virginians themselves had engaged in expeditions against the French\r\nsettled in Maine, and spoke menacingly of the Dutch who had established\r\na settlement on the King's domain in Hudson's River in 1613. The claims\r\nof the European monarchs to the American continent conflicted with one\r\nanother, and there seemed little chance that a resolution would come by\r\nany other means than war. So it proved to be, later. In the meantime, at\r\nhome, Virginia settlers stood on guard. Governor Yeardley appointed\r\nCapt. William Tucker, one of the Virginia Council, to check at Point\r\nComfort all ships entering the James River. Tucker was provided with a\r\nwell-armed shallop and absolute authority to check all ships arriving.\r\nHe could not do battle with an enemy warship, of course, but he could\r\ngive the alarm in case the enemy appeared. A few years later a fort was\r\nbuilt at Point Comfort to defend the entrance to Virginia's great river.\r\nAlthough the channel was too wide ever to be adequately commanded by the\r\ncannon of the day, the fort provided some protection to the colony.\r\n\r\nYeardley made similar efforts to strengthen Virginia's position on land\r\nagainst the numerically superior Indians. Like Wyatt he urged the\r\nnecessity of \"planting the forest\" rather than jumping beyond it to\r\nareas far from existing settlements. As a means of controlling the\r\npopulation Yeardley issued a proclamation requiring that anyone who\r\ndesired to move his place of residence within the colony must obtain\r\nprior permission from the Governor and Council. Even to be absent for a\r\nshort time from his place of residence, a planter was required to get\r\npermission from his \"plantation commander.\" As was pointed out earlier,\r\n\"plantations\" in this early period were usually not the\r\nindividually-owned, individually-operated plantations of later times,\r\nbut \"private colonies\" or \"particular plantations,\" organized on a\r\njoint-stock basis, on which more than a hundred men might live.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with his conception of the colony as a military outpost,\r\nYeardley made plans for an armed settlement on the York at Chiskiack,\r\nand devised a project for a surprise attack on all the surrounding\r\nIndians on the first day of August 1627. Each \"particular plantation\"\r\nwas to march against an Indian town, kill as many Indians as possible,\r\nand seize or cut down what corn it could. The attack was a success, but\r\nbecause of a scarcity of shot the English failed in their desired goal\r\nof utterly extirpating the red men.\r\n\r\nIn November 1627 Yeardley died, and the Council chose one of its\r\nnumber, Captain Francis West, to assume the role of Governor and Captain\r\nGeneral.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA UNDER FRANCIS WEST AND DR. JOHN POTT, 1627-1630\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the King had grown increasingly disgusted that Virginia's\r\neconomy continued to be \"built on smoke,\" and he ordered the Virginians\r\nto concentrate on crops and products other than tobacco. Among the\r\nproducts urged on the colonists were iron, salt, pitch and tar, potash,\r\nand pipe staves. As his directives went unheeded, the King determined to\r\nforce a drastic reduction in the planting of the profitable tobacco\r\ncrop. In instructions sent out in 1627 he directed that no master of a\r\nfamily be allowed to plant above 200 pounds of tobacco and no servant\r\nmore than 125 pounds. He also ordered that all tobacco was to be\r\nconsigned to him or his representatives.\r\n\r\nCharles directed that a general assembly of the planters'\r\nrepresentatives be summoned to deal with his proposals, and Governor\r\nWest and the Council ordered an Assembly to meet on March 10, 1628. The\r\nAssembly thanked the King for prohibiting the importation of Spanish\r\ntobacco into the English market, but cried that they would be at the\r\nmercy of covetous individuals in England if a monopoly on Virginia\r\ntobacco was allowed. They proposed, however, that since the King\r\nintended to take all their tobacco, he should agree to take at least\r\n500,000 pounds of tobacco at 3 shillings 6 pence the pound delivered in\r\nVirginia, or 4 shillings delivered in London. If the King was unwilling\r\nto take so much, they desired the right to export again from England to\r\nthe Low Countries, Ireland, Turkey, and elsewhere. As to the King's\r\nproposal to limit tobacco cultivation to 200 pounds for the master of a\r\nfamily and 125 pounds for a servant, \"every weake judgment,\" they\r\nasserted, could see that this would not be sufficient for their\r\nmaintenance. As to the King's desire that the colonists should produce\r\npitch and tar, pipe staves, and iron, they complained that much capital\r\nwas needed to put such enterprises in operation. Few planters either\r\ncould or would undertake such schemes when tobacco culture required so\r\nlittle capital and produced such quick and profitable results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: National Portrait Gallery, London\r\n\r\nKING CHARLES I\r\n\r\nPainting by Daniel Mytens]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly commissioned Sir Francis Wyatt, then in England, and two\r\nVirginians to represent them in negotiations with the King. They were to\r\nbe allowed to come down six pence on each of the figures insisted upon\r\nby Governor, Council, and Burgesses in their answer to the King's\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nAs in 1625, the opportunity to join in Assembly for the purpose of\r\nagreeing on regulations for tobacco production allowed the planters to\r\ndeal with other matters. Wesley Frank Craven has written that\r\n\"representative government in America owes much in its origins to an\r\nattempt to win men's support of a common economic program by means of\r\nmutual consent.\" Had the King been less desirous of taking every\r\nplanter's tobacco and less concerned with the neglect of staple\r\ncommodities, he might well have governed the colony without calling the\r\nplanters together in periodic \"assemblies.\"\r\n\r\nDr. John Pott was elected by the Council on March 5, 1629, to succeed\r\nWest as Governor, and he governed in Virginia for one year. Few men\r\npossess a less savory record than this first representative of the\r\nmedical profession in America. In 1624 he had been ordered removed from\r\nthe Virginia Council, at the insistence of the Earl of Warwick, for his\r\npart in the attempt to poison the colony's Indian foes. He was later\r\nconvicted of cattle stealing but spared punishment because he was the\r\nonly doctor in the colony and therefore in great demand.\r\n\r\nBoth West and Pott were foes of the Indians, and in numerous orders and\r\nproclamations denounced former treaties of peace with them, and directed\r\nthat perpetual enmity and wars be maintained against them. A pretended\r\npeace was, however, authorized to be extended to the Indians in August\r\n1628 until certain captive Englishmen were redeemed; then it was to be\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nThe colonists, too, suffered during the administrations of West and\r\nPott. One man expressed the hope for \"an Easterly wind to blow to send\r\nin Noble Capt. Harvey, And then I shall have wright for all my wrong.\"\r\nCapt. John Harvey was known in the colony for the investigation he had\r\nconducted in Virginia in 1624-1625, and the King had appointed him\r\nGovernor on March 26, 1628. Harvey did not actually take up his\r\ngovernment in Virginia until two years later. In the meantime West and\r\nPott administered the colony.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA UNDER JOHN HARVEY, 1630-1632: EXPANSION AND DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nWhen Harvey arrived in 1630 he found that inadequate restrictions placed\r\non tobacco production in the previous years had created an enormous\r\nsurplus which had forced the price down to a penny a pound. Harvey found\r\nalso that because of their \"greedie desires to make store of Tobackoe,\"\r\nthe settlers had neglected to plant sufficient corn, let alone to\r\ndevelop different commodities as instructed by the King. Calling an\r\nAssembly, he convinced the representatives to agree to reduce the amount\r\nof tobacco planted, and to increase the amount of corn. He also sent\r\nships into the Chesapeake and southward to Cape Fear to trade for corn\r\nwith the Indians to make up the deficit left by the negligent planters.\r\nBut most important of all, Harvey put into effect the long-dreamed-of\r\nplan to secure the entire area between the James and the York by\r\nbuilding a palisade between Archer's Hope Creek (now College Creek),\r\nemptying into the James River, and Queen's Creek, emptying into the York\r\nRiver. Harvey's plan called also for a settlement on the south side of\r\nthe York. This outpost would serve as an advance base and point of\r\ndefense for operations against Opechancanough, King of the Pamunkeys,\r\nand his many warriors. Six hundred acres apiece were granted there in\r\n1630 to Capt. John West, brother of Lord Delaware, and to Capt. John\r\nUtie, who were made commanders of the settlement. Fifty acres were\r\noffered to any person who would settle there during the first year of\r\nits existence and twenty-five during the next year. Exactly when the\r\nfirst settlers moved to the York is uncertain, but it was probably in\r\n1631. West and Utie settled on either side of a bay formed by the\r\njoining of King's Creek and Felgate's Creek about four miles above\r\nmodern Yorktown. The tourist who speeds along the Colonial Parkway from\r\nJamestown to Yorktown crosses the bay within sight of the tracts granted\r\nWest and Utie. Today he may drive from Jamestown to the York with\r\ncomfort and safety in a few minutes. It took the early settlers\r\ntwenty-four years to cover the same distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map 1]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, probably in 1630, another distant settlement was\r\nestablished. William Claiborne, Secretary of the Council of State of\r\nVirginia, with one hundred men, settled Kent Island 150 miles up\r\nChesapeake Bay. In the Assembly of February 1632 both \"Kiskyacke and the\r\nIsle of Kent\" were represented by Capt. Nicholas Martiau, ancestor of\r\nGeorge Washington.\r\n\r\nThe great expansion had now begun. Settlers crossed from the James to\r\nthe York, and provision was made by an act of the Assembly of February\r\n1633 for building houses at Middle Plantation, situated strategically\r\nbetween College Creek and Queen's Creek, and for \"securing\" the tract of\r\nland lying between the two creeks.\r\n\r\nBesides being concerned with questions of defense, Harvey pursued a\r\npolicy of encouraging trade with other colonies in the New World.\r\nNumerous commissions were issued by the Governor in March and April of\r\n1632 authorizing individuals to trade with New England, Nova Scotia, and\r\nthe Dutch plantation in Hudson's River, as well as with the West Indies.\r\nHarvey even gave instructions to Nathaniel Basse, one of the traders and\r\na member of the Council, to encourage people from the other colonies to\r\ncome to Virginia. \"If those of Newe England shall dislike the coldnes of\r\nthere clymate or the barrenness of the soyle,\" wrote Harvey, \"you may\r\npropose unto them the plantinge of Delaware bay, where they shall have\r\nwhat furtherance wee cann afford them, and noe impediment objected\r\nagainst theire owne orders and lawes.\"\r\n\r\nBut all was not well in the government of the colony. Harvey found the\r\nCouncil members constantly opposing him, disputing his authority,\r\nresisting his attempts to administer equal justice to all men. The royal\r\nGovernor was not supreme as we now sometimes mistakenly assume. He was\r\nfirst among equals only. Decisions at this time were made by majority\r\nvote, and the Governor was frequently outvoted. Moreover the Councilors,\r\nwho could devote more of their time to their private affairs, tended to\r\nbe better off financially than the Governor himself, who found it next\r\nto impossible to get his salary from the King, and who was forced to\r\nentertain at his own expense all who came to James City. Harvey\r\ncomplained that he should be called the \"host\" rather than the\r\n\"Governor\" of Virginia. In contrast, Samuel Mathews, one of Harvey's\r\nenemies on the Council, owned the finest estate in Virginia. William\r\nClaiborne, another of Harvey's enemies on the Council, besides a large\r\nestate, had a royal commission and English backers for his powerful\r\ntrading company.\r\n\r\nHarvey made every effort to reconcile the differences which arose\r\nbetween him and the Council members, and on December 20, 1631, all\r\nsigned an agreement promising to work in harmony and to mend their\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nFortified by this agreement, Harvey went forward with his efforts to put\r\nVirginia's agricultural economy on a sound basis. The principal problem\r\nwas to force the planters to diversify. Many tears are shed for the\r\npoverty of the planters of Virginia, and their customary indebtedness to\r\nEnglish creditors is usually cited as proof of their poverty. But this\r\n\"poverty\" was not based on the inability of the planter to raise enough\r\nfood to support himself and his family, but on the fluctuations of the\r\nmarket price of the crop--tobacco--to which he had devoted most of his\r\nenergies as a speculative venture. Strange as it may seem, the planter\r\nhad to be forced to raise enough food for his own support, so avid was\r\nhis desire for quick tobacco profits.\r\n\r\nGovernor Harvey's Assembly of February 1632 directed that every man\r\nworking in the ground should plant and tend at least two acres of corn\r\nper head, on penalty of forfeiture of his entire crop of tobacco. Harvey\r\nhoped to make Virginia \"the granarie to his Majesty's Empire,\" as Sicily\r\nhad been to Rome. Another act allowed corn to be sold for as high a\r\nprice as could be obtained, contrary to the usual European and colonial\r\nhabit of fixing prices on basic commodities used by the people. The\r\nreason given for this freedom from price fixing was that the precedents\r\nof other countries did not apply to America, \"for none are so poore\r\nheere, as that they may not have as much corne, as they will plant,\r\nhavinge land enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of 1632 did, however, fix a price on tobacco, requiring\r\nthat it not be sold at less than six pence per pound, a law they went to\r\ngreat pains to justify to the King. Tobacco was Virginia's primary\r\neconomic interest, and the Virginians were willing to go to any lengths\r\nto advance that interest. They urged the King not to place any\r\nimpediment to their \"free trade,\" or right to sell their tobacco\r\nwherever they could, and mentioned that they had already constructed\r\nseveral barques and had begun trading with the Dutch plantation on\r\nHudson's River. Governor Harvey asked why the English merchants could\r\nnot afford to allow them a penny a pound for their tobacco when the\r\nDutch paid eighteen pence per pound.\r\n\r\nThe English merchants who traded with Virginia formed a tight little\r\ngroup which used its favored position to charge excessive prices for\r\nEnglish-made goods, and to give abnormally low prices for Virginia\r\ntobacco. Such a policy was not entirely owing to covetousness. The\r\nEnglish economy was shackled by a conception of economic life which\r\nbelieved in the necessity of monopolies and restrictive devices of all\r\nsorts. The Dutch nation, on the other hand, had thrown off many of the\r\ntraditional mercantilist restraints on trade. Holland soon enjoyed a\r\nlevel of prosperity that made her the envy of the rest of Europe. Her\r\nrivals attributed Dutch success to the energy of her people. \"Go to beat\r\nthe Dutch\" became a byword which has persisted to this day. Not until a\r\ncentury later did the English realize that Dutch prosperity was caused\r\nnot so much by hard work as by the policy of freeing trade from\r\nunnecessary restraints. As Dutch prosperity increased, Dutch ships\r\nappeared in every sea, underselling all rivals and paying better prices\r\nfor local products. The complaint that the London merchants allowed only\r\none penny a pound for the Virginians' tobacco while the Dutch gave\r\neighteen strikingly illustrates the measure of Dutch commercial\r\nsuperiority. No wonder that the London merchants should demand that the\r\nDutch be excluded from the Virginia market! For the same reason\r\nVirginians, whether Governors, Councilors, Burgesses, or planters, were,\r\nthroughout the seventeenth century, almost unanimously opposed to the\r\nEnglish government's policy of restricting trade with Virginia to\r\nEnglish ships and confining that trade to English ports.\r\n\r\nAlthough Governor Harvey supported the Burgesses and Council in their\r\nstrong defense of tobacco production, he privately wrote that he had not\r\nonly endeavored to have reduced the amount of tobacco planted \"but if it\r\nmight have been, to have utterly rooted out this stinking commodity.\" He\r\nreported that only the powerful hand of the King and his Council could,\r\nhowever, effect such an end, so \"indeared\" were the planters to the\r\ntraffic. Moreover, Harvey admitted that until some more staple commodity\r\ncould be developed, tobacco could not be prohibited without the utter\r\nruin of the colony. Virginia was rooted to tobacco--seemingly for ever.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia planters' proposals, of course, met the opposition of the\r\nLondon merchants, who complained to their powerful friends and\r\nassociates in the government and urged the King and his Council to\r\nnullify the restrictions which the Virginians tried to place on the sale\r\nof their tobacco. The merchants were particularly opposed to the desire\r\nof the Virginians to by-pass them and trade with foreign nations\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\nIt is hard for us to realize today the immense importance of merchants\r\nand traders in influencing the colonial policies of the English\r\ngovernment. Virginia was founded by a commercial company. All the early\r\nattempts at settlement were made by private persons who were willing to\r\n\"adventure\" their capital or their skill. Behind the great explorers\r\nstood private individuals who risked their money on the success of the\r\nvoyage or settlement. The \"government\"--perhaps it would be truer to say\r\nthe Kings and their advisers--did not have the funds or the foresight to\r\nsupport these ventures. They were perfectly willing to sign papers\r\ngranting lands they did not own to those who were willing to attempt the\r\nsettlement, but they were reluctant to put up their own money except on\r\na sure thing.\r\n\r\nOnce the settlements were functioning, once revenues were patently\r\nobvious, the monarchs showed more concern with their government.\r\nMerchants still, however, continued to provide the link between the King\r\nand colony to a great extent. In an age of state regulation and\r\nmonopolies, in an age which did not provide fixed salaries for men in\r\nhigh position, there was a close relationship between the Exchange and\r\nthe Court. A merchant dealing with overseas trade could not be\r\nsuccessful unless he had influence at Court. Even after the King took\r\naway the charter of the Virginia Company, merchants continued to apply\r\npressure to the committees and commissions set up to advise the King on\r\ncolonial policy. Although the colonists feared that Charles I might\r\nreinstitute a company over them, and the former representatives of the\r\nVirginia Company pressed for such a move, the merchants were not able to\r\nre-establish direct control over the colony.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA UNDER HARVEY, 1632-1634: PROSPERITY AND DECENTRALIZATION\r\n\r\nIn September 1632, under Governor Harvey's direction, the first revisal\r\nof Virginia's laws was made. Twenty-five years of experience under\r\nvarying forms of government lay behind the revisal. All previous laws\r\nwere examined and brought into conformity with existing conditions. Most\r\nof the legislation concerned the Church, tobacco, and the Indians, good\r\nindications of what most concerned the early settlers. Highways were\r\nalso authorized to be laid out in convenient places, the first sign that\r\nsettlement was spreading from the rivers--the traditional highways of\r\nVirginia--into the interior. Virginia was becoming more than a military\r\noutpost. It was becoming a \"home.\"\r\n\r\nThe success of Harvey's attempt to stabilize and diversify agricultural\r\nproduction is confirmed in the account of Captain Thomas Young of his\r\nvoyage to Virginia and Delaware Bay in 1634. Sailing up the James River\r\nhe noticed that \"the cuntry aboundeth with very great plentie of milk,\r\ncheese, butter and corne, which latter almost every planter in the\r\ncountry hath.\" The grim threat of starvation that had in former times\r\nhung over the colony had been dispelled. Although there had been a rapid\r\nincrease in population, the food supply more than kept up with the\r\nincrease, and thousands of bushels of corn were even transported and\r\nsold to the New England colonists.\r\n\r\nThe year 1634 also marked the establishment of the county form of local\r\ngovernment in Virginia. The scattered plantations and settlements,\r\nrapidly expanding and hence more difficult to govern from James City,\r\nwere now organized into eight counties. For each a monthly court was\r\nestablished by commission from the Governor and Council. Provision for\r\nseparate courts in outlying areas had been made as early as 1618. Now\r\nthe shift to decentralized government was formalized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map 2]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"THRUSTING OUT\" OF GOVERNOR HARVEY AND ITS AFTERMATH, 1635-1641\r\n\r\nIn 1635, in one of the most famous incidents in Virginia's early\r\nhistory, Governor Harvey was deposed by his Council. Many historians\r\nhave assumed that Harvey was deposed by a spontaneous uprising of the\r\npeople no longer able to bear his oppressive government. There is,\r\nhowever, little justification for this view. Many more accusations have\r\nbeen hurled at Harvey by later historians than by his contemporaries,\r\nand it is undoubtedly Harvey's position as a royal Governor and his\r\nquick temper that have caused historians to take such a hostile view of\r\nhim. Ever since the successful American Revolution of 1776, American\r\nhistorians, in interpreting the events of the colonial period, have\r\njumped at any evidence of discontent as an anticipation of, and\r\njustification for, the War for Independence. They have not stopped to\r\ndetermine whether the charges hurled at the royal Governors were true or\r\nnot. It is enough that someone accused them of oppression.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the revolt against Harvey were various. Of first\r\nimportance was the continual opposition that existed between the\r\nGovernor and his Council. The revolt was not primarily a revolt of the\r\npeople but a revolt by certain members of the Council who attempted to\r\ngive their particular insubordination the appearance of a general\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nHarvey's commission was such that he could do nothing except by majority\r\nvote of himself and the Council sitting as a single body. The Council\r\nfrequently outvoted him, effectively blocking his proposals. Harvey\r\nbitterly disputed the Council's power to thwart his will. He pointed out\r\nthat the King had sent him to Virginia not only as the new Governor but\r\nwith the specific duty of correcting the abuses that were reported to\r\nhave existed under previous Governors, especially those abuses for which\r\nmembers of the Council were responsible. Previous to his arrival the\r\ngovernment had been in the hands of Francis West and Dr. John Pott,\r\nelected to office by the other members of the Council. Pott, whose\r\nreputation has been mentioned earlier, was not pleased to be brought to\r\njustice for his dishonest actions. Nor was Samuel Mathews, an important\r\nmember of the Council, pleased to be brought to justice for withholding\r\nthe cattle and property of other men. (Mathews, the richest man in the\r\ncolony, successfully resisted all legal attempts to divest him of this\r\nproperty.) Nor were the Council members pleased when, in accordance with\r\nHis Majesty's commands, Harvey attempted to punish those responsible for\r\nthe ill treatment of William Capps, sent earlier by the King to start\r\nproduction of tar, potash, salt, pipe staves and other commodities. The\r\nCouncil had discouraged him from his mission, except in so far as it\r\nconcerned the production of salt, and Pott had issued an order\r\npreventing him from leaving the colony to report to the King.\r\n\r\nAnother cause for grievance against Harvey was the peace he made with\r\nthe local Indians. The colonists distrusted the Indians more than they\r\ndistrusted other Europeans. The great massacre of 1622, when the Indians\r\nmade a desperate attempt to destroy the English settlement, had placed\r\nIndian-white relations on a basis of perpetual enmity. Legally, the\r\nIndians had never been considered to have the same rights as the\r\nEnglish. English law throughout the seventeenth century maintained the\r\ndoctrine that between Christians and infidels there could exist nothing\r\nbut perpetual enmity, a view which was a hangover from the period of the\r\nCrusades, wars against the Turks, and expansion by militant Christian\r\nnations into heathen lands during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\r\nIt is true that practical co-operation and on-the-spot recognition of\r\nIndian rights had developed in Virginia in the early years. The massacre\r\nof 1622, however, gave Virginians an excuse for abandoning all forms of\r\nco-operation with, and respect for, the Indians. Deceit and breach of\r\nfaith were elevated into acknowledged instruments of policy. The right\r\nof the Indians even to occupy the land of their forefathers was denied.\r\nThey were admitted to exist and to hold land _in fact_, but the English\r\nrefused to recognize _in law_ either their existence or their title to\r\nland. Total extirpation was resolved against those Indian nations which\r\nhad taken part in the massacre. \"Marches\" were periodically ordered\r\nagainst the various tribes with the purpose of destroying or seizing\r\ntheir corn, burning their shelters, and killing as many members of the\r\ntribe as possible.\r\n\r\nGovernor Harvey reversed this policy and made peace with the Indians\r\nagainst the advice of Dr. Pott and other Councilors. He also attempted\r\nto see that some measure of equity was extended to Indian-white\r\nrelations. As a result, the more aggressive planters accused him of\r\npromoting a second massacre.\r\n\r\nWhat really set off the revolt against Harvey, however, was the\r\ninjection of the hottest issue of the day into the controversy: whether\r\nHarvey was \"soft\" on Catholicism. This issue was brought to a head\r\nbecause of the grant of a portion of Virginia's original territory to\r\nGeorge Calvert, first Lord Baltimore. Harvey had extended a helping hand\r\nto Baltimore's colonists. Although his actions in this regard were\r\nspecifically required of him by the King, and although he received\r\nespecially warm commendation from the English government for doing so,\r\nthe Virginia colonists objected. The King's grant, for one thing, had\r\nbeen carved out of the Virginia Company's old bounds which had been left\r\nundisturbed when the Company lost its right to govern the area. Already\r\nVirginians were beginning to eye the benefits of settlement in the\r\nnorthern reaches of Chesapeake Bay. One, Colonel William Claiborne,\r\nSecretary of the colony, had obtained a royal commission to trade in the\r\narea and had established a settlement on Kent Island, opposite the\r\npresent Annapolis, far up Chesapeake Bay. By acting on the King's\r\ninstructions and supporting Baltimore's authority in the area against\r\nClaiborne's claims, Harvey turned the second most important man in the\r\ncolony against him.\r\n\r\nHarvey at first backed the Virginia Council's assertion that Kent\r\nIsland was a part of Virginia, and not part of the supposedly\r\nuncultivated wilderness granted to Baltimore by the King. But in the\r\nface of Charles's obvious desire to take the area away from Virginia,\r\nand because Claiborne's patent authorized trade rather than settlement,\r\nHarvey soon accepted Lord Baltimore's position that Claiborne's trading\r\npost lay within the limits of Baltimore's jurisdiction. Irritation\r\nbetween the two men increased when Harvey attempted jointly with the\r\nMaryland authorities to conduct an examination of charges that Claiborne\r\nwas stirring up Maryland's Indians against the new settlers. Claiborne\r\nwas accused of telling the local Indians that the new settlers were not\r\nEnglishmen but Spaniards. The investigation which ensued was hampered at\r\nevery turn by Claiborne and his friends on the Virginia Council.\r\n\r\nThe Virginians were most concerned not by the apparent violation of\r\nVirginia's territorial integrity, but by the fact that the new\r\nsettlement was being established and settled by Roman Catholics. The\r\nVirginians were less tolerant than the King in wishing success to Lord\r\nBaltimore, a Catholic, and his fellow religionists, in establishing a\r\ncolony on their northern border. The Virginia Council wrote Charles in\r\n1629 thanking him for \"the freedome of our Religion which wee have\r\nenjoyed,\" and asserting proudly that \"noe papists have beene suffered to\r\nsettle amongst us.\" They insisted upon tendering the oaths of supremacy\r\nand allegiance to Lord Baltimore when he arrived in Virginia in October\r\n1629 to consider a possible settlement, and reported to the King that he\r\nhad refused to take those oaths. Charles I had married a Catholic,\r\nHenrietta Maria of France, and, like his father, James I, was not\r\ndisposed to allow too rigorous penalties against those who professed\r\nreligious allegiance to Rome. But the Parliament, and the people in\r\ngeneral, feared and hated Catholics, believing their religious beliefs\r\nto be incompatible with loyalty to a Protestant state.\r\n\r\nBy means of the oaths of allegiance and supremacy Catholics were\r\nrequired to recognize the English sovereign as their rightful ruler in\r\nmatters spiritual and ecclesiastical as well as temporal, to repudiate\r\nthe papal claim to depose heretical princes, to promise to fight for the\r\nKing in case of rebellion caused by a papal sentence of deposition, and\r\nto denounce the doctrine that princes, being excommunicated, could be\r\ndeposed or murdered, or that subjects could be absolved from their oath\r\nof allegiance. The oaths were based on a real fear which identified\r\nRoman Catholicism with treason. Protestants felt that Catholics owed\r\ntheir highest allegiance to a foreign power, and hence were not good\r\nEnglishmen. The problem was a complicated one, and much debated at the\r\ntime and since. Now it is generally accepted that one can owe spiritual\r\nallegiance to Rome while remaining a faithful subject of a non-Catholic\r\nstate. In England in the seventeenth century, however, the Church of\r\nRome was too closely identified with England's mortal enemies to allow\r\nher freely to tolerate Catholics in her midst. For a long period England\r\nhad feared Spain as the greatest threat to her existence. Even after the\r\ndefeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588 this fear persisted and to a\r\ncertain extent was transferred to France, another Catholic power. The\r\nmeasures taken against the Catholics in England were similar to those\r\ntaken against Communists in this country today, and they were taken for\r\nthe same reason: the fear that the followers of a universal ideology\r\nwould turn against their local allegiance if the two ever came in\r\nconflict.\r\n\r\nEventually Charles's easy attitude towards Catholics helped bring about\r\nhis downfall. In a similar way Harvey's compliance with the King's\r\ninstructions to aid and respect Baltimore's colonists weakened his\r\npopularity in Virginia.\r\n\r\nAs the locus of power in England shifted from the King and his lords\r\ntowards the Parliament and the people, a stronger Protestant and\r\ndemocratic policy became necessary. The eventual result of this shift in\r\npower became evident with the beheading of Charles I in 1649 and, later,\r\nwith the Glorious Revolution of 1689 and the crowning of William and\r\nMary as constitutional symbols of the power of the English nation.\r\n\r\nSo great was the popular feeling in Virginia against the \"Papists\" in\r\nMaryland that many, in casual conversation, exclaimed that they would\r\nrather knock their cattle on the head than sell them to Maryland. To\r\naccommodate the needs of the new settlers in Maryland, Harvey sent them\r\nsome cows of his own and did his best to ease their early struggles, in\r\naccordance with the King's commands. He could not do all he wished,\r\nhowever, because he was frequently outvoted at the Council meetings on\r\nanything that had to do with Maryland.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of Governor Harvey had its origin on April 27, 1635, in a\r\nmutinous gathering held in the York River area, Virginia's first\r\nfrontier settlement outside the James River. The ring-leader seems to\r\nhave been Francis Pott, brother of Doctor Pott, who harangued the\r\nmeeting about the alleged injustice of Governor Harvey, and about the\r\nGovernor's toleration for Indians, which he said would bring on another\r\nmassacre. Francis Pott had formerly been commander of the fort at Point\r\nComfort but had a short time before been discharged by Harvey for\r\nmisbehavior.\r\n\r\nHarvey ordered the principals in the York meeting arrested, and called\r\nthe Council together to consider what action should be taken against\r\nthem. The Council opposed Harvey's desire to proceed against them by\r\nmartial law, and began to excuse the dissidents on the grounds of the\r\nmany complaints the people had about the government. Harvey thereupon\r\ndemanded opinions in writing on what should be done with the mutineers.\r\nGeorge Menefie, the first Councilor of whom Harvey demanded such a\r\nwritten statement, said he was but a young lawyer and dared not give a\r\nsudden opinion. A violent debate ensued. The rest of the Council also\r\nrefused to put their opinions in writing. At the next meeting of the\r\nCouncil, Menefie began to recount the grievances of the country, naming\r\nHarvey's detention of the Assembly's letter to the King as the principal\r\none. The original of this letter, refusing the King's propositions\r\nconcerning a tobacco contract, Harvey had retained, as likely to\r\ninfuriate the monarch and do the country no good. Instead he had sent a\r\ncopy of the letter to the Secretary of State. At Menefie's words,\r\nHarvey, in a rage, brought his hand down sharply on the Councilor's\r\nshoulder and said, \"Do you say so? I arrest you on suspicion of treason\r\nto his Majesty.\" Then Capt. John Utie and Capt. Samuel Mathews seized\r\nHarvey and said, \"And we you upon suspicion of treason to his Majesty.\"\r\nSecretary Richard Kemp immediately stepped between the men and told Utie\r\nand Mathews that Harvey was the King's Lieutenant and that they had done\r\nmore than they could answer for. Mathews and Utie released their hold on\r\nthe Governor but demanded that he go to England to answer the people's\r\ncomplaints. To emphasize their demand Dr. John Pott signaled forty\r\nsoldiers who had been concealed outside the Governor's house (where the\r\nmeeting was held) to march up to the door, apparently as a form of\r\nthreat, although the mutineers protested that the guard was for the\r\nGovernor's safety. More days of negotiations passed. The rebellious\r\nCouncil called an Assembly to hear charges against Harvey, and chose\r\nCapt. John West to be Governor until His Majesty's pleasure might be\r\nknown. Finally Harvey agreed to return to England. Francis Pott went on\r\nthe same ship home.\r\n\r\nIn England the Privy Council heard the charges against Harvey and his\r\ndefense. None of the accusations stood up, and he was able to show why\r\nthe Council had private reasons to desire his removal. The King directed\r\nhim to return to his government with increased power, and ordered the\r\nCouncilors who had been instrumental in deposing him to be sent to\r\nEngland for trial. Harvey was able to collect some of his back pay and\r\nto obtain the King's agreement that he should return in a ship of war.\r\nUnfortunately, an old and unseaworthy prize ship was provided him which\r\nhad to turn back shortly after its departure, and Harvey was forced to\r\ntake passage on an ordinary merchant ship which arrived in Virginia\r\nJanuary 18, 1637. Harvey suffered great losses because of the\r\nunseaworthiness of the prize ship, and petitioned the King for\r\nrecompense. He was, however, ordered to pay out of his own pocket all\r\nthe losses he had sustained by the affair, although he was authorized to\r\ncollect an equivalent amount from the estates of the mutinous Councilors\r\nshould they be convicted.\r\n\r\nThe sending of the mutinous Councilors--Capt. John West, Samuel Mathews,\r\nJohn Utie, and William Pierce--as prisoners to England, strangely enough\r\nallowed them to accomplish what they had been unable to do in Virginia.\r\nSo many and so powerful were their friends, so wealthy were they\r\nthemselves, and so many were the charges that they contrived against\r\nHarvey now that he was back in the colony and unable to answer them,\r\nthat the King soon reversed himself and ordered Harvey relieved of his\r\npost. The King's action illustrates one of the little appreciated\r\nfactors in American colonial history: the role played by petitions to\r\nthe King. Three thousand miles of ocean, and months, even years, in\r\ntime, separated the assertion from the proof, encouraged the most\r\nexaggerated charges, and contributed to the unjustified sympathy\r\nextended by the King to many petitioners who did not deserve such\r\nconsideration. Some of the \"crimes\" charged against Harvey were even\r\ndiscovered to have their origin in the King's own commands or in earlier\r\nacts of Assembly. Yet they contributed to clouding the atmosphere and\r\nblinding the lords of England to the true worth of their representative\r\nin Virginia.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of unjustified or unsupported charges concerning Harvey's\r\nalleged misappropriation of the mutinous Councilors' estates, which had\r\nbeen seized for the King pending their trial, the King, on May 25, 1637,\r\nordered these estates returned to their owners. Harvey complied\r\nimmediately as far as four of the Councilors were concerned, but he had\r\nalready allowed legal action to be directed against Mathews' estate by\r\nthose who had claims against Mathews, and judgments had been made in\r\nfavor of the plaintiffs. When the English government heard he had not\r\nturned back Mathews' property, it promptly ordered that he do so without\r\ndelay, which order Harvey then tried to put into effect as best he\r\ncould. The damage had been done, however, and the impression created\r\nthat he had willfully misappropriated Mathews' property and disobeyed\r\nthe King's commands.\r\n\r\nHarvey's fight against the charges his enemies brought against him in\r\nEngland suffered another blow when Mr. Anthony Panton, a minister who\r\nhad been twice banished from the colony, returned to England to add his\r\ncomplaints to those of the others. Harvey was not given a chance to\r\ndefend himself against the new charges, and on January 11, 1639, Sir\r\nFrancis Wyatt was appointed to succeed him.\r\n\r\nOn Wyatt's arrival Harvey's estate was seized and the old Governor\r\nprevented from returning to England until he could satisfy his\r\ncreditors. To meet their demands, Harvey, in 1640, was forced to sell\r\nall his land and much of his personal property. The fact that he was in\r\ndebt to many persons in the colony is itself a significant indication\r\nthat he had not abused the powers of his office. It is a curious fact\r\nthat both Governor Sir William Berkeley and Governor Harvey were much in\r\ndebt when the rebellions against their rule began, while their principal\r\nenemies were among the wealthiest men in the colony.\r\n\r\nHarvey was finally able to return to England, probably in 1641. There he\r\nfound Anthony Panton continuing his campaign of defamation against him.\r\nPanton was not content to accuse the previous government in Virginia of\r\nevery sort of general crime (although he failed to cite any specific\r\ninstance of oppression) but charged that the commission the King had\r\ngranted to Sir William Berkeley in August 1641 to replace Wyatt had been\r\nsurreptitiously obtained. The House of Lords therefore ordered\r\nBerkeley's voyage delayed while they examined the case. The House of\r\nCommons, on the basis of an earlier petition from Panton, had similarly\r\nprevented the return to Virginia of Richard Kemp, Secretary of the\r\ncolony, and Christopher Wormeley. Both Berkeley and the two Virginians\r\npresented counterpetitions, the one pointing out that he was charged\r\nwith nothing and hence desired not to be held up on his costly voyage,\r\nthe others asserting that all Panton's accusations were untrue and\r\nsimilarly requesting permission to leave. The House of Lords thereupon\r\ngranted these petitions, sending Panton's charges to the Governor and\r\nCouncil of Virginia for a decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY ADMINISTRATION OF SIR WILLIAM BERKELEY, 1642-1644: AN ERA OF\r\nGOOD FEELING\r\n\r\nIn March 1642 Sir William Berkeley took up his duties in Virginia and\r\nbegan a career which ended both gloriously and ignominiously thirty-five\r\nyears later. Berkeley came from a distinguished family, was a graduate\r\nof Oxford and the Inns of Court, a playwright, and a courtier much\r\nadmired by the King. Men frequently wondered why he chose to waste his\r\ntalents in the American wilderness when he might have achieved eminence\r\nat Court. The mystery will probably ever remain. In Virginia Berkeley\r\nhad to work with many of the same Councilors who bedeviled Harvey, but\r\nBerkeley was able to get along well with them and with the Assembly and\r\npeople of Virginia. No Governor of Virginia in the seventeenth century\r\nwas ever so well or so deservedly loved by the people. Since he ended\r\nhis long career as Governor amidst a colonial rebellion against his rule\r\nin 1676, historians have found it hard to determine whether to bestow\r\npraise or blame upon him. Usually he is praised for his early years in\r\nthe government and condemned for his later years, thus taking on a Dr.\r\nJekyll and Mr. Hyde character. The last word has not yet been written on\r\nGovernor Berkeley, however, and his character may prove to be more\r\nconsistent than historians have realized.\r\n\r\nBerkeley's first action was to join the Burgesses and Council in a\r\nviolent denunciation of those who were attempting to reinstitute the old\r\nVirginia Company's control over the colony. In a \"Declaration against\r\nthe Company\" Berkeley and the Assembly asserted that government under\r\nthe Company had been intolerable and if introduced again would destroy\r\nall the democratic rights allowed by the King's instructions, such as\r\nlegal trial by jury, the right to petition the King, and yearly\r\nAssemblies. The readmission of the Company would also, the declaration\r\nasserted, impeach the \"freedom of our trade (which is the blood and life\r\nof a commonwealth).\" The declaration went on to order that anyone who\r\npromoted the restoration of the Company's power would, upon due\r\nconviction, be held an enemy to the colony and forfeit his whole estate.\r\n\r\nBerkeley's next action was to recommend the repeal of the tax of four\r\npounds of tobacco per poll which formerly had been levied for the\r\nGovernor's use. The Assembly acknowledged this as \"a benefit descending\r\nunto us and our posterity ... contributed to us by our present\r\nGovernor.\" Berkeley abolished certain other valuable emoluments due him\r\nby virtue of his office \"wherein,\" the Assembly declared, \"we may not\r\nlikewise silence the bounty of our present Governor in preferring the\r\npublic freedom before his particular profit.\" Finally Berkeley\r\nrecommended that taxes be proportioned in some measure \"according to\r\nmens abilities and estates\" rather than by the old poll tax system, and\r\nthe new scheme was, for a brief period, put into effect.\r\n\r\nGovernor Berkeley not only showed himself selfless in restraining his\r\nown opportunities for profit, but fearless in restraining the colonists'\r\nitch for land. A few months before his arrival, the Assembly had\r\nauthorized settlement both on the north side of the York and in the\r\nRappahannock area, if it could be done in great enough force.\r\nOpechancanough was to be offered fifty barrels of corn a year for the\r\narea between the York and the Piankatank, although the English proposed\r\nto take the area whether Opechancanough accepted the offer or not.\r\nTwenty-four years had elapsed before English settlement jumped from the\r\nJames to the York. Now, ten years after the first settlements on the\r\nYork, Virginians were settling on the next great river to the north, the\r\nRappahannock. By the time Berkeley arrived, some settlers had\r\nestablished themselves in the area, and many more had claimed grants.\r\nIndian hostility was great, however, and soon a number of the settlers\r\nreturned to more secure areas of the country.\r\n\r\nBerkeley, working with the Assembly of March 1643, obtained a law which\r\nprovided that the Rappahannock River region should remain \"unseated,\"\r\nthough grants might be tentatively claimed in the area, until the\r\nGovernor, Council, and Burgesses, that is, the Grand Assembly, should\r\nauthorize settlement there. The Governor was attempting to regulate the\r\nexpansion of the colony so that the twin goals of security for the\r\nEnglish and justice for the Indians could both be secured. In this he\r\nwas not entirely successful, since he could only guide, not arbitrarily\r\ndirect, the representatives of the people. The rich, virgin land of the\r\nfrontier exerted a continuing attraction to the tobacco planters, and\r\nfive years later, in 1648, the restrictions on settlement in the\r\nRappahannock region, as well as in the Potomac region, were officially\r\nlifted.\r\n\r\nMany other important policy decisions were made at the March 1643\r\nmeeting of the Grand Assembly. One of these decisions concerned church\r\ngovernment. The first act provided for the establishment of church\r\ngovernment according to the Anglican form. Virginia was not formed as a\r\nprotest against the Church of England, as were the Puritan colonies in\r\nNew England in large measure. Conformity in religious matters was\r\nconsidered a virtue in Virginia. The Assembly, indeed, enacted that\r\nnonconformist ministers be compelled to depart the colony, an act which\r\ndid much to sour Virginia's relations with New England. What was\r\nsignificant about the act, however, was that, with certain exceptions\r\nand qualifications, it gave the vestry of every parish power to elect\r\nthe minister of the parish. Because established landlords and nobles\r\ndid not exist to build and endow churches as in England, the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, in the vestry, had to assume the role of\r\npatron, to build the church, and to provide for the support of the\r\nminister. In such circumstances it was natural that much of the power\r\nthat remained in the hierarchy of church, state, and society in England\r\nshould, in Virginia, pass to the ordinary people and be exercised\r\nthrough their representatives--the vestry and Burgesses. The people, not\r\nthe King, became the patron of the Church of England in Virginia.\r\nPopular responsibility replaced clerical responsibility and added one\r\nmore phase of life to those controlled directly by the people in the New\r\nWorld. It is significant that Patrick Henry, years before the\r\nRevolution, should first have asserted the doctrine of popular\r\nresponsibility and authority in a case--the celebrated \"Parsons'\r\nCause\"--involving the people's authority over the church.\r\n\r\nAn even more significant indication of the shift in power in the\r\ngovernment was the provision in one of the acts of the Assembly of 1643\r\nthat appeals from the General Court (composed of the Governor and\r\nCouncil, all appointees of the Crown) should be made to the Grand\r\nAssembly (composed of the representatives of the people plus the\r\nGovernor and Council).\r\n\r\nStill another demonstration of the _de facto_ shift in power from the\r\nCrown to the people was the third act of the 1643 Assembly which\r\ndeclared that the Governor and Council \"shall not lay any taxes or\r\nimpositions upon this collonie their lands or comodities otherwise then\r\nby the authority of the Grand Assembly to be leavied and imployed as by\r\nthe Assembly shall be appointed.\" The first such law had been passed in\r\nMarch 1624 and renewed in February 1632. The process of wresting control\r\nof the purse strings from the representatives of the Crown was to be a\r\nlong-drawn-out process in America, as indeed it was in England. In\r\nVirginia the battle was won without a fight either because the Governors\r\nwere unable to oppose the power of the Burgesses or because they\r\nidentified their interests with those of the people. In the case of the\r\nrights won by the people of Virginia during Sir William Berkeley's\r\ngovernorship, these seem to have been the results as much of the\r\nGovernor's benevolence as of the Burgesses' power.\r\n\r\nThe colony also took its economic welfare into its own hands in the\r\nearly years of Berkeley's administration. Dutch traders were encouraged\r\nby an act which made it free and lawful for any Dutch merchant or\r\nshipowner to bring merchandise into the colony and to take tobacco out\r\nof it. Means were provided to ease the difficulty caused by the\r\nrequirement that the Dutch give security for payment of the King's\r\ncustoms at the port of London.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT MASSACRE AND INDIAN WAR, 1644-1646\r\n\r\nOn April 18, 1644, occurred the second great Indian massacre in\r\nVirginia's history. Opechancanough, King of the Pamunkey Indian\r\nconfederation, planned and executed the massacre, which most historians\r\nattribute to the steadily increasing pressure exerted by the English on\r\nthe Indians' lands. The white population had increased from 3,000 in\r\n1630 to 8,000 in 1640, and more were pouring in yearly. Nearly four\r\nhundred English, living in exposed areas of the colony, reportedly lost\r\ntheir lives in the massacre. The gallant young Berkeley, as proficient a\r\nsoldier as he was a playwright and courtier, struck back hard at the\r\nIndians. The entire colony was put on a war footing. Campaigns, usually\r\nby small mobile forces, were conducted against the Indians where they\r\ncould be found. The June Assembly passed an act for \"perpetuall warre\r\nwith the Indians\" promising to \"pursue and root out those which have any\r\nway had theire hands in the shedding of our blood and massacring of our\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nAs in the case of so many Indian wars, there was a difference of opinion\r\nas to which Indian nations were guilty of the attack. The Assembly's act\r\nattempted to restrict reprisals to those who had actually perpetrated\r\nthe massacre. Some individuals, however, like Col. William Claiborne,\r\nseem to have desired to extend the reprisals to the Indians living\r\nbetween the Rappahannock and the Potomac, where the land interests of\r\nClaiborne and others were concentrated at this time.\r\n\r\nLittle progress was made in defeating the enemy in the early months of\r\nthe war. The Assembly, meeting in June 1644, foreseeing ruin and\r\ndesolation unless the colony could be furnished with a greater supply of\r\narms and ammunition, entreated Governor Berkeley to return to England\r\nand implore His Majesty for assistance to the country. The Assembly also\r\ncommissioned Mr. Cornelius Lloyd as agent for the colony to obtain what\r\nsupplies he could from the Dutch plantation in Hudson's River, from the\r\nSwedish plantation on the Delaware, and from the New England\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem, from the records available, that either mission was\r\nsuccessful. Governor Berkeley found England involved in full-scale war\r\nbetween the forces of the King and those of Parliament. Instead of\r\nreceiving aid from the King, Berkeley lent his own assistance to the\r\nKing's cause in his English campaigns. Berkeley returned to Virginia a\r\nyear later.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Virginia's agent to the northern colonies apparently met\r\nwith similar lack of success. Governor John Winthrop of Massachusetts\r\nBay attributed the massacre to Virginia's expulsion of certain \"godly\r\nministers\" sent from New England a short time before, and told the\r\nVirginia agent that Massachusetts could not spare the powder requested.\r\nWhen Massachusetts' principal powder store shortly thereafter blew up,\r\nWinthrop wondered whether God's wrath might not have been kindled\r\nagainst the Bay Colony for her refusal to provide powder to fellow\r\nEnglishmen in need.\r\n\r\nThe war with Opechancanough continued throughout the fall and winter of\r\n1644 and into the spring of 1645. At the Assembly of February 1645\r\nprovision was made for sending out the usual military parties. But in\r\naddition three forts were ordered built: one in the Pamunkey territory,\r\none at the falls of the James, and a third along the Chickahominy.\r\n\r\nEfforts were made to see that the expenses of the war were equitably\r\nshared. The settlers at Northumberland, on the south bank of the\r\nPotomac, were ordered to contribute to the cost of the war on the north\r\nside of the James. Chickacoan, as the area was known at first, had\r\nserved for several years as a rallying point for Protestants disaffected\r\nwith the government of Lord Baltimore, but this was the first official\r\nnotice of the settlement by the Virginia Assembly. Settlement along the\r\nPotomac was significant, of course, because it placed a body of citizens\r\nfarther from effective control than any had been in the past. It had\r\nbeen hard enough for Harvey to control the citizens on the south side of\r\nthe York River; now two broad rivers, the York and Rappahannock, lay\r\nbetween the frontier settlements and Jamestown.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of February 1645 found time to deal with matters other than\r\nthe conduct of the war. It passed an act providing \"That Free trade be\r\nallowed to all the inhabitants of the collony to buy and sell at their\r\nbest advantage.\" Because some questions had been asked by the merchants\r\nof London concerning a rumored prohibition of trade with them, it was\r\nthought fit to explain that Virginia's free trade extended to them as to\r\nother Englishmen.\r\n\r\nFollowing Sir William Berkeley's return from England June 7, 1645,\r\nvigorous measures were taken to end the protracted war with\r\nOpechancanough, and a new Assembly was called to reform abuses which had\r\nsprung up. This Assembly met in November and passed reform laws which\r\ndemonstrate the concern Berkeley had for satisfying all the legitimate\r\ngrievances of the people. Action was taken against innkeepers who\r\ncharged unreasonable rates and fraudulently mixed their wines and\r\nliquors with water. Similar action was taken against millers who\r\novercharged the people. Attorneys at law who charged fees for their\r\nservices were expelled from office, the colony having become outraged\r\nat their exactions. The prohibition against professional attorneys\r\ncontinued for a number of years before it was finally relaxed. Strict\r\nregulations were instituted to curb the abuses of administrators of\r\ndeceased persons and orphans. Because of the trouble and charge to\r\nplaintiffs and defendants of coming to Jamestown to attend the General\r\nCourt, county courts were allowed power to try all causes at common law\r\nand equity. The tradition that appeals should lie from county courts to\r\nthe General Court and from the General Court to the Assembly was\r\nreaffirmed. General poll taxes, which had been reintroduced, were\r\nabolished on the grounds that they were \"inconvenient\" and had \"become\r\ninsupportable for the poorer sorte to beare.\" All levies were ordered to\r\nbe raised \"by equall proportions out of the visible estates in the\r\ncollony.\" Exemptions from taxation extended to members of the Council\r\nwere canceled for the duration of the war. It is not hard to imagine the\r\npraise that would have been heaped on the initiator of such reforms, had\r\nit seemed that they were the result of a democratic uprising.\r\n\r\nIn March 1646 the Assembly met again. The policy of building forts had\r\nevidently been considered successful enough to encourage the Assembly to\r\norder another, Fort Henry, constructed at the falls of the Appomattox\r\nfor the defense of the inhabitants on the south side of the James River\r\nand to deprive the Indians of their fishing in the area. The war had\r\nbeen going on for a year and a half and the enemy forces were still not\r\ndestroyed. The Assembly, considering the vast expense that the conflict\r\nhad caused and considering \"the almost impossibility of a further\r\nrevenge upon them, they being dispersed and driven from their townes and\r\nhabitations, lurking up and downe the woods in small numbers, and that a\r\npeace (if honourably obtained) would conduce to the better being and\r\ncomoditie of the country,\" authorized Capt. Henry Fleet, the colony's\r\ninterpreter, and sixty men, to go out and try to make a peace with\r\nOpechancanough. If they could not make such a peace, they were to erect\r\na fort on the Rappahannock River or between it and the York.\r\n\r\nThe \"break\" in the war came with the daring capture of Opechancanough\r\nhimself by Governor Berkeley. Berkeley, who frequently led the troops of\r\nthe colony in the field, was apprised of the Indian leader's\r\nwhereabouts, and with characteristic boldness led a troop of men in a\r\nraid on his headquarters. The raid was successful: Opechancanough was\r\ncaptured and brought back to Jamestown. The old chief, said to be over\r\n100 years, acted the part of Emperor of the Indian confederation with\r\ngrave dignity. The historian Robert Beverley tells us that one day the\r\nnearly blind warrior heard \"a great noise of the treading of people\r\nabout him; upon which he caused his eye-lids to be lifted up; and\r\nfinding that a crowd of people were let in to see him, he call'd in high\r\nindignation for the Governour; who being come, Opechancanough scornfully\r\ntold him, that had it been his fortune to take Sir William Berkeley\r\nprisoner, he should not meanly have exposed him as a show to the\r\npeople.\" Berkeley accepted the rebuke, and ordered him treated with all\r\nthe dignity due his position as the leader of many Indian nations.\r\nUnfortunately the life of Opechancanough was shortly after snuffed out\r\nby one of his guards who shot him in the back, despite his defenseless\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nPeace was concluded with Necotowance, Opechancanough's successor, by the\r\nfirst act of the October 1646 Assembly. The treaty is a document of\r\nhistoric importance. Under its provisions Necotowance acknowledged that\r\nhe held his kingdom from the King of England and that his successors\r\nmight be appointed or confirmed by the King's Governors. Twenty beaver\r\nskins were to be paid to the Governor yearly \"at the going away of the\r\ngeese\" in acknowledgment of this subjection. Necotowance and his people\r\nwere given freedom to inhabit and hunt on the north side of York River\r\nwithout interference from the English, provided that if the Governor and\r\nCouncil thought fit to permit any English to inhabit the lower reaches\r\nof the peninsula, where land grants had been made before the massacre,\r\nNecotowance first should be acquainted therewith. Necotowance in turn\r\nsurrendered all claim to the land between the falls of the James and the\r\nYork rivers downward to Chesapeake Bay. Indians were not allowed on this\r\nland unless specially designated as messengers to the English. Similarly\r\nit was a felony for an Englishmen to repair to the north side of the\r\nYork River except temporarily under special conditions authorized by the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the treaty lies in the fact that the Indians were to\r\nbe treated as equals, with equal rights to live on the land with the\r\nEnglish and to enjoy the rights of human beings. They were no longer\r\nconsidered as vermin to be exterminated whenever the opportunity\r\npresented itself. For the first time in Virginia's history, the Indian\r\nwas considered to have an unquestioned legal right to the land. The\r\nsetting aside of a reservation for the Indians into which English\r\nintrusion was forbidden marked the end of the \"perpetual enmity\" policy\r\nof earlier days. When differences arose, they might still be settled by\r\npeace or by war, but the right of either side to exist would not be\r\nquestioned.\r\n\r\nDespite the improvement in the status of the Indian nations occasioned\r\nby the treaty of 1646 it proved impossible to preserve their rights in\r\nthe face of the enormous increase in English population. The fate of the\r\neastern Indians proved identical to the fate of their western brothers\r\nin the nineteenth century, when white population increased around the\r\nareas set aside for Indian occupancy. But in Virginia the attempt was\r\nmade to establish a fair settlement, and Governor Berkeley honestly and\r\ncourageously labored to keep faith with the Indians, even though he lost\r\npopularity and eventually his position as a result.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of October 1646 also provided for the maintenance of the\r\nforts built during the war. This was done by granting the land on which\r\nthey were built, plus adjoining acres, to individuals who would\r\nguarantee to maintain the forts and to keep a certain number of men\r\nconstantly on the place. By this method the valuable forts of the\r\ncolony were preserved, yet the people were spared the heavy taxes that\r\nwould normally have been necessary to maintain them.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly made further provision that those who had settled along the\r\nPotomac in Northumberland should not be allowed to avoid taxes as they\r\nhad done during the war. The English in this remote area had evidently\r\nignored the act of the February 1645 Assembly which attempted to tax\r\nthem, and followed instead their own interests, free from any effective\r\ncontrol by Virginia's government during the conflict with\r\nOpechancanough.\r\n\r\nFinally the October Assembly enacted the strictest and most democratic\r\nvoting law ever made in Virginia. Not only were all freemen (as well as\r\ncovenanted servants) allowed to vote, but they were fined 100 pounds of\r\ntobacco for failing to do so. This act seems to have continued in effect\r\nuntil 1655 when the Assembly prohibited freemen from voting unless they\r\nwere also householders.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADMINISTRATION OF BERKELEY IN 1647-1648: TRADE AND EXPANSION\r\n\r\nFollowing the war Virginia returned to its two great peacetime\r\ninterests--trade and expansion. In the Assembly of April 1647 Berkeley,\r\nthe Council, and the Burgesses joined in a declaration which reveals the\r\nextent to which the colony relied on Dutch traders. It noted that\r\n\"absolute necessities\" had caused earlier Assemblies to invite the Dutch\r\nto trade with the inhabitants of Virginia, \"which now for some few\r\nyeares they have injoyed with such content, comfort and releife that\r\nthey esteeme the continuance thereof, of noe lesse consequence then as a\r\nrelative to theire being and subsistence.\" Rumors had been raised, the\r\ndeclaration went on, that by a recent ordinance of Parliament, all\r\nforeigners were prohibited from trading with any of the English\r\nplantations \"which wee conceive to bee the invention of some English\r\nmerchants on purpose to affright and expell the Dutch, and make way for\r\nthemselves to monopolize not onely our labours and fortunes, but even\r\nour persons.\" The declaration noted the baneful effects on the colony of\r\nthe greed of the English merchants and pointed out that by ancient\r\ncharter and right the inhabitants of Virginia were allowed to trade with\r\nany nation in amity with the King. It would be inconceivable that\r\nParliament would abridge this right \"especially without hearing of the\r\nparties principally interested, which infringeth noe lesse the libertye\r\nof the Collony and a right of deare esteeme to free borne persons:\r\n_viz._, that no lawe should bee established within the kingdome of\r\nEngland concerninge us without the consent of a grand Assembly here.\"\r\nBut since they had heard nothing officially concerning the rumored act,\r\n\"wee can interprett noe other thing from the report, then a forgerye of\r\navaritious persons, whose sickle hath bin ever long in our harvest\r\nallreadye.\" To provide for Virginia's subsistence the Governor, Council,\r\nand Burgesses ordered that the right of the Dutch nation to trade with\r\nVirginia be reiterated and preserved, and her traders given every\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nVirginia's other great problem, that of unregulated expansion, was dealt\r\nwith by the Grand Assembly of November 1647 in an extraordinary way. The\r\nGovernor, Council, and Burgesses ordered that persons inhabiting\r\nNorthumberland and \"other remote and straying plantations on the south\r\nside of Patomeck River, Wicokomoko, Rappahannock and Fleets Bay\" be\r\ndisplanted and removed. They justified this act on the basis of frequent\r\ninstructions from the King to Berkeley and the Council directing that\r\nthe planters not be allowed to scatter themselves too widely, and also\r\nbecause they considered such settlement \"pernicious\" and \"destructive\"\r\nto the peace and safety of the colony, animating the Indians to attack,\r\nand thus imbroiling the country in troublesome and expensive wars. Since\r\nwinter was approaching, the inhabitants were allowed one year to remove\r\nthemselves to the south side of York River.\r\n\r\nThe same session of the Assembly authorized Capt. Edward Hill and others\r\nto establish, at the head of Rappahannock River, a military and trading\r\noutpost which was deemed valuable to the peace and safety of the colony.\r\nHill and his associates were to provide forty men to man the fort which\r\nwas not to exceed five acres at most, on pain of having the grant\r\nrevoked.\r\n\r\nIt was a brave and sensible policy which Berkeley and the Assembly\r\npursued, but one that was destined to be overridden by the power,\r\nself-interest, and numbers of the thousands of new members of the\r\ncolony, both those being born in Virginia in ever-increasing numbers,\r\nand those who had left behind them the civil strife of England. In less\r\nthan a year the Assembly enacted that the tract of land between the\r\nRappahannock and Potomac rivers should be called Northumberland and that\r\nit should have power to elect Burgesses. The reasons of \"state\" that had\r\nconvinced the Assembly of November 1647 to order the utter dissolution\r\nof the Northumberland settlements were thus thrown to the winds by the\r\nnext Assembly. No doubt the pressure of the inhabitants, would-be\r\ninhabitants, and speculators, in addition to the difficulty of enforcing\r\nthe decision, caused the repeal of the act. The restraining hand of the\r\nGovernor was never again to be felt as it had been in the period\r\nfollowing the 1646 peace. The explosive growth of settlement in Virginia\r\nhad proved impossible to control.\r\n\r\nThe justification of the settlement south of the Potomac River was not\r\nthe only victory of the people in the Assembly of October 1648. Upon the\r\nrepresentation of the Burgesses to the Governor and Council complaining\r\nof the worn-out lands and insufficient cattle ranges of the earlier\r\nsettlements, the Governor and Council, after long debate, joined the\r\nBurgesses in authorizing settlement on the north side of the York and\r\nRappahannock rivers. The act declared, however, that \"for reasons of\r\nstate to ... [the Governor and Council] appearing, importing the safety\r\nof the people in their seating,\" no one was to go there before the first\r\nof September of the following year. Surveys of the area were allowed at\r\nonce, however, and land patents were authorized to be taken out. The act\r\nmaking it a felony to go to the north side of York River was repealed.\r\nThe settlers' and speculators' victory was complete. Reasons of \"policy\"\r\nand \"state\" proved only of sufficient power to delay the inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTION OF CHARLES I AND CAPTURE OF COLONY BY PARLIAMENTARY FORCES,\r\n1649-1652\r\n\r\nOn January 30, 1649, King Charles I was beheaded by the Parliamentary\r\nforces. It was a logical climax to the turmoil into which English\r\ninstitutions and values had been cast by the long years of civil war\r\nthat preceded the deed. The execution of the King shocked Englishmen as\r\nwell as foreigners. The reaction of the Virginians came in the form of\r\nAct I of the Assembly of October 1649 which hailed \"the late most\r\nexcellent and now undoubtedly sainted king,\" denounced the perpetrators\r\nof the deed, and declared that if any person in the colony should defend\r\n\"the late traiterous proceedings ... under any notion of law and\r\njustice\" by words or speeches, such person should be adjudged an\r\naccessory _post factum_ to the death of the King. Anyone who expressed\r\ndoubt, by words and speeches, as to the inherent right of Charles II to\r\nsucceed his father as King of England and Virginia, was likewise to be\r\nadjudged guilty of high treason.\r\n\r\nThe death of Charles I left the Parliamentary forces supreme in England.\r\nSome royalists retired to the continent of Europe, and some came to\r\nVirginia. England became a Commonwealth without a King; Oliver Cromwell\r\nwas later named Protector. The new government, after consolidating its\r\npower in England, attempted to extend its control over the colonies,\r\nsome of which, like Virginia, continued to demonstrate their loyalty to\r\nroyal authority. On October 3, 1650, Parliament, as a punitive measure,\r\nprohibited the trade of the colonies with foreign nations except as the\r\nParliamentary government should allow. \"This succession to the exercise\r\nof the kingly authority,\" wrote Jefferson later, \"gave the first colour\r\nfor parliamentary interference with the colonies, and produced that\r\nfatal precedent which they continued to follow after they had retired,\r\nin other respects, within their proper functions.\"\r\n\r\nThe reaction of the Virginia Burgesses to this act was as violent as\r\ntheir reaction to the beheading of Charles I. Their temper on both\r\noccasions owed much to the eloquence of their Governor, and to the\r\nadmiration in which he was held by the people. In March 1651 they met to\r\nconsider the Parliamentary threat to their beliefs and to their\r\nlivelihood. Sir William Berkeley spoke to them on the subject of\r\nParliament's claim to speak for the English nation. Said the Governor:\r\n\r\n    If the whole current of their reasoning were not as ridiculous, as\r\n    their actions have been tyrannicall and bloudy, we might wonder with\r\n    what browes they could sustaine such impertinent assertions: For if\r\n    you looke into it, the strength of their argument runs onely thus:\r\n    we have laid violent hands on your land-lord, possessed his manner\r\n    house where you used to pay your rents, therfore now tender your\r\n    respects to the same house you once reverenced.... They talke indeed\r\n    of money laid out on this country in its infancy: I will not say how\r\n    little, nor how centuply repaid, but will onely aske, was it\r\n    theirs?... Surely Gentlemen we are more slaves by nature, then their\r\n    power can make us if we suffer our selves to be shaken with these\r\n    paper bulletts, and those on my life are the heaviest they either\r\n    can or will send us.\r\n\r\nBerkeley was confident that if Virginia put up a determined resistance,\r\nthe new English rulers would beg the colony to trade with them. He\r\ncompared the state of England with the state of Virginia, to the\r\ndisadvantage of the former. The Parliamentary government of England, he\r\nasserted, did not represent the will of the people who would not endure\r\ntheir \"slavery, if the sword at their throats did not compell them to\r\nlanguish under the misery they howrely suffer.\" As for Virginia, \"there\r\nis not here an arbitrary hand that dares to touch the substance of\r\neither poore or rich.\" Berkeley called on the Burgesses to support his\r\nstand against the act, asking:\r\n\r\n    What is it can be hoped for in a change, which we have not allready?\r\n    Is it liberty? The sun looks not on a people more free then we are\r\n    from all oppression. Is it wealth? Hundreds of examples shew us that\r\n    industry and thrift in a short time may bring us to as high a degree\r\n    of it, as the country and our conditions are yet capable of: Is it\r\n    securely to enjoy this wealth when gotten? With out blushing I will\r\n    speake it, I am confident theare lives not that person can accuse me\r\n    of attempting the least act against any mans property. Is it peace?\r\n    The Indians, God be blessed round about us are subdued; we can onely\r\n    feare the Londoners, who would faine bring us to the same poverty,\r\n    wherein the Dutch found and relieved us; would take away the liberty\r\n    of our consciences, and tongues, and our right of giving and selling\r\n    our goods to whom we please. But Gentlemen by the Grace of God we\r\n    will not so tamely part with our King, and all these blessings we\r\n    enjoy under him; and if they oppose us, do but follow me, I will\r\n    either lead you to victory, or loose a life which I cannot more\r\n    gloriously sacrifice then for my loyalty, and your security.\r\n\r\nThe speech being ended the House of Burgesses, unanimously with the\r\nGovernor and Council, agreed to reject the Parliamentary act of October\r\n3, 1650, as illegal, and to continue in allegiance to King Charles II,\r\nalways praying for his restoration to the throne and for the repentance\r\nof those who, \"to the hazard of their soules\" opposed him. The Assembly\r\nproclaimed that they would continue to trade freely with all persons of\r\nwhatever nation who came to trade with them, not excluding the\r\nLondoners.\r\n\r\nThis assertion of Virginia's traditional freedom and rights was, of\r\ncourse, a direct challenge to the Parliamentary government. In the fall\r\nof 1651 that government determined to chastise the rebellious colony and\r\nsubject it by force. A fleet was dispatched in October to conquer\r\nVirginia and Barbados, another rebellious colony. Robert Dennis, Richard\r\nBennett, Thomas Stegge, and William Claiborne were chosen commissioners\r\nto take over the government of Virginia once it had been conquered.\r\nBennett and Claiborne were living in Virginia at the time.\r\n\r\nPart of the fleet arrived in Virginia waters in January 1652. Berkeley\r\ncalled upon the people to prepare for resistance. One thousand troops,\r\nit is said, gathered in James City for the purpose. Five hundred Indian\r\nallies of the colony promised their aid. Berkeley denounced the leaders\r\nof the Parliamentary expedition as bloody tyrants, pirates, and robbers.\r\nHe warned the Virginians that, if they did not repel the attack, their\r\nland titles would be thrown into doubt and they would be brought under a\r\ncompany of merchants who would order them at their pleasure and keep\r\nthem from trade with all others. To counteract the Governor's influence,\r\nthe Parliamentary commissioners circulated letters and declarations\r\nthroughout the country denying any such evil intentions. Finally, on\r\nJanuary 19, they sent a summons to the Governor and Council to\r\nsurrender, and set sail from the lower reaches of the James to\r\nJamestown. A milder answer than expected was returned, setting forth\r\nvarious demands and privileges desired by the Virginians.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners' reply to these proposals was favorable enough to\r\ncause Berkeley to call an Assembly, and negotiations were entered into\r\nbetween the Governor, Council, and Burgesses on the one hand, and the\r\nParliamentary commissioners on the other. Articles of submission were\r\nagreed upon which were honorable to both sides, Virginia receiving\r\nguarantees of the privileges of freeborn people of England, authority\r\nfor the Grand Assembly to continue to function, guarantees of immunity\r\nfor acts or words done or spoken in opposition to Parliament, guarantees\r\nof the bounds of Virginia, of the fifty-acre headright privilege, and of\r\nthe right to \"free trade as the people of England do enjoy to all places\r\nand with all nations according to the lawes of that commonwealth.\"\r\nSpecial provisions were made which allowed the Governor and Council to\r\nrefrain from taking any oath to the Commonwealth for one year and\r\nguaranteed them for one year from censure for speaking well of the King\r\nin their private houses. Berkeley and the Council were given leave to\r\nsell their estates and quit Virginia, either for England or Holland. No\r\npenalties were to be imposed on those who had served the King.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners of Parliament considered that they had been lucky to\r\nreduce the colony without bloodshed, even though forced to agree to such\r\nmild terms. At the same time the event suggests that the bitterness\r\nwhich existed in England between Roundheads and Cavaliers was not quite\r\nso extreme in the colonies, where little blood had been shed for the\r\ncause of either. The colonies had interests of their own which ran\r\ncounter to those of the mother country, whether in the hands of King or\r\nParliament. Governor, Council, and Burgesses in Virginia were closer to\r\neach other economically and politically than they were to their\r\nrespective counterparts in England. What held the colonies to the mother\r\ncountry was not self-interest but ties of historical tradition and\r\nracial patriotism. The execution of Charles I and seizure of the colony\r\nby the Parliamentary fleet loosened these ties. The Crown, symbol of\r\ncontinuity with past ages of English subjects and of unity among all the\r\nKing's realms, was now not only removed but denounced by those who had\r\ndone the deed.\r\n\r\nVirginia never showed sympathy for those who had killed the King, and\r\nthe Assembly took to heart Governor Berkeley's warning of 1651 that the\r\nblood of Charles I \"will yet staine your garments if you willingly\r\nsubmit to those murtherers hands that shed it.\" It is true that\r\nfollowing the surrender the Parliamentary commissioners agreed with the\r\nrepresentatives of the people on a provisional government for Virginia,\r\nbut the bonds that held Virginia to England had lost much of the cement\r\nof love and tradition. Local and self-interest were now to dominate to a\r\ngreat extent Virginia's actions. Such motives had always been latent,\r\nand indeed active. But under royal government, the Governor could often\r\nexert a countervailing force to prevent such interests from overriding\r\nthe interests of nation and morality.\r\n\r\nUnder the terms of the settlement the Grand Assembly was to continue to\r\nfunction, and the Assembly and commissioners agreed that Richard\r\nBennett, one of the commissioners, should act as Governor for a year. It\r\nwas expected that orders would shortly arrive from England establishing\r\nnew patterns of government. Such instructions were especially necessary\r\nto determine the role and authority of the Governor and Council,\r\nformerly appointed by the King. The new rulers in England were made\r\naware of the need for a new policy for the colonies, but they never\r\nfound time to make the necessary decisions. At intervals the colonists\r\nwere informed that Cromwell had not forgotten them and that His Highness\r\nwould soon let them know his pleasure. But instructions never came\r\nexcept spasmodically and inadequately. The merchants who stood to gain\r\nfrom the Navigation Act of 1651, which generally excluded foreign ships\r\nfrom the colonies and attempted to restrain colonial trade with foreign\r\ncountries, complained at the failure of the colonists to obey the act\r\nand demanded that orders be sent to enforce it, but no adequate\r\nprovisions were ever made.\r\n\r\nThus the colony was left to its own devices during the period. Virginia\r\ntraders paid little attention to Parliamentary restrictions on their\r\ncommerce. They insisted that the provision of the Articles of Surrender\r\nallowing them free trade with all nations according to the laws of the\r\nCommonwealth did not prevent them from trading with foreigners. They\r\nargued that since the first article of the surrender agreement\r\nguaranteed them the rights of freeborn Englishmen, an act discriminating\r\nagainst them in matters of trade because they happened to live in the\r\ncolonies was illegal. Dutch ships called often, though perhaps not so\r\nfrequently as some have believed, and individual Virginians traded as\r\nthey pleased with the Dutch and English colonies in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPANSION IN VIRGINIA, 1650-1656\r\n\r\nThe existence of a weak executive, dependent on the people for his\r\nauthority, inevitably brought about a dispersal of power and authority\r\nfrom the center to the outer edges of settlement. The explosive force\r\nof expansion was no longer limited by the strong hand of a royal\r\nGovernor, and each increment of population in the colony and power in\r\nthe hands of the local authorities added fuel to the combustion.\r\n\r\nOne of Virginia's frontiers at this time was the Eastern Shore. It was a\r\nfrontier community because the law of the colonial government in\r\nJamestown rarely extended to it. The local commissioners of the county\r\ncourt, later called \"justices,\" provided what justice existed on the\r\nEastern Shore. But since these commissioners were sometimes the worst\r\noffenders against the policies of the Governor, Council, and Burgesses,\r\njustice was often sacrificed to interest, especially when Indians were\r\ninvolved. The leaders on the Eastern Shore, like Edmund Scarborough,\r\nwere among the richest men and greatest landowners of the colony. They\r\nconducted the county's business as if it were their own, which indeed it\r\nwas to a great extent. Their oppression of the Eastern Shore Indians\r\nmakes a sorry history, despite the efforts of Governor Berkeley to\r\nrestrain them. In April 1650, for example, Berkeley was forced to write\r\nto the commissioners of Northampton asking them not to allow any land to\r\nbe taken from the Laughing King Indians. Berkeley pointed out that\r\nduring the massacre of 1644 these Indians had remained faithful to the\r\nEnglish. How could Virginia expect them to do the same again, asked\r\nBerkeley, \"unless we correspond with them in acts of charity and amity,\r\nespecially unless we abstain from acts of rapine and violence, which\r\nthey say we begin to do, by taking away their land from them, by\r\npretence of the sale of a patent.\"\r\n\r\nHonest attempts were made both before and after the retirement of Sir\r\nWilliam Berkeley in 1652 to restrain the frontier barons in their savage\r\nattacks on unsuspecting Indian towns. But often the law was too weak and\r\nthe guilty too strong. Neither the Indians in front of them nor the\r\ngovernment behind them had the power to curb their desires except in a\r\nlimited fashion. This was one of the benefits--to the frontiersmen--of\r\nliving under English law. The government could not effectively restrain\r\nthe Englishman nor protect the Indian. As a result the reckless\r\nexpansion went on into the lands of other tribes. As each new Indian\r\ntribe was reached the same dismal pattern of subjugation or extirpation\r\nwas repeated, despite the efforts of the Governor and Council to see\r\nthat the rights of the Indians were preserved.\r\n\r\nEvery extension of settlement strengthened local rule. In May 1652 the\r\npeople of Northampton County, which comprised the whole of the Eastern\r\nShore of Virginia, protested to the Assembly against a tax levied on\r\nthem, asserting that since they had not sent representatives to the\r\nAssembly since 1647, except for one Burgess in 1651, they did not think\r\nthe Assembly could tax them. They asked that they be allowed to have a\r\nseparate government and the right to try all causes in their own courts.\r\nAlthough Northampton was not allowed to dissociate itself entirely from\r\nthe rest of Virginia, acts of 1654 and 1656 allowed the county to\r\nconstitute laws and customs for itself on matters dealing with Indians\r\nand manufactures.\r\n\r\nVirginia's most important frontier region in the 1650's was the area\r\nalong the Potomac River, although settlement went on simultaneously\r\nwestward up the James, York, and Rappahannock, southward into Carolina,\r\nand northward up the Eastern Shore to Maryland. Sometimes individuals\r\nobtained grants to explore, settle, and monopolize the trade of these\r\nregions. But usually the expansion was catch as catch can. Since land\r\ntravel was still more difficult than water travel, expansion up the\r\nPotomac, the last great unsettled tidewater river, was fastest.\r\nIndividuals who already had plantations in the older areas of settlement\r\naround Jamestown sailed their barques up the Potomac and, without\r\nbothering to go ashore, took the bounds of likely pieces of land. The\r\nbest spots were often the corn fields of the Indians and sometimes the\r\nvery towns where they lived. The fact that the Indians occupied the land\r\ncounted for little in the thoughts of the settlers and speculators who\r\nflocked to the area. Following their surveys, the explorers rushed back\r\nto James City and put in claims for the waterfront acreages, presenting\r\none \"headright\"--proof that someone had been imported into the colony by\r\ntheir agency--for every fifty acres. The Patent Books of the colony\r\nfrequently show signs of fraud in the presentation of headrights.\r\nOccasionally more land was granted than the claimant was entitled to on\r\nthe basis of the headrights he presented. But the headright system, even\r\nimperfectly administered, remained during the Parliamentary period as\r\none of the elements of restraint on the unbounded desires of the\r\nplanters. Land acquisition was thus tied in a fixed ratio to population\r\nincrease. There was, as a result, some assurance that land acquired\r\nwould be populated and farmed. It was not until late in the seventeenth\r\ncentury that anyone could buy land for money alone, a practice which\r\nenabled some individuals in the eighteenth century to obtain holdings\r\nexceeding 100,000 acres. In the middle of the seventeenth century 10,000\r\nacres was a practical \"top\" limit.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Commonwealth period in Virginia a number of new\r\ncounties were set up. The Assembly of April 1652 listed two new ones:\r\nGloucester, north of the York, and Lancaster, north of the Rappahannock.\r\nThe Assembly of November 1652 listed Surry, south of the James, for the\r\nfirst time. Settlers had moved into these areas earlier when they were\r\nparts of other counties, and in two cases the county organization may\r\nhave been set up prior to April 1652. The Assembly of July 1653, in\r\naddition to authorizing exploration and settlement on the Roanoke and\r\nChowan rivers in present-day North Carolina, and exploration into the\r\nAppalachian Mountains, ordered that a county to be called Westmoreland\r\nshould be set up west of Northumberland County on the Potomac, with\r\nboundaries from Machodoc River to the falls of the Potomac above the\r\ntown of the Anacostan Indians. It was thus intended not only to include\r\nin the new county all the lands of the Doeg Indians, but also those of\r\nthe Anacostans. The Assembly of November 1654 authorized the\r\nestablishment of New Kent County along both sides of the upper York\r\nRiver and far up the Pamunkey and Mattaponi rivers.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of November 1654 also authorized the three new northern\r\ncounties of Lancaster, Northumberland, and Westmoreland to march against\r\nthe Rappahannock Indians to punish various \"injuries and insolencies\r\noffered\" by them. One hundred men were to be raised in Lancaster, forty\r\nin Northumberland, and thirty in Westmoreland. The commissioners of\r\nthese counties were authorized to raise the troops, and one of their\r\nnumber was appointed commander-in-chief of the expedition. He was to\r\nmarch to the Rappahannock Indian town and demand and receive \"such\r\nsatisfaction as he shall thinke fitt for the severall injuries done unto\r\nthe said inhabitants not using any acts of hostility but defensive in\r\ncase of assault.\" The charge of the war was to be borne by the three\r\ncounties concerned. This expedition was like many others that both\r\npreceded and followed it. In each case, enormous authority and\r\nresponsibility were given to local officials who were themselves\r\nfrequently the leading oppressors of the Indians. Such expeditions not\r\ninfrequently took on the character of private wars between the big\r\nlandowners of the frontier and the Indian towns in the vicinity. The\r\nGovernor, Council, and Burgesses frequently heard the complaints of the\r\nlocal settlers, but rarely the complaints of the Indians. The\r\nauthorization to the local community to administer justice to the\r\nIndians often proved a cover for their expulsion or extirpation.\r\n\r\nThe usual grievances of the settlers against the Indians were not the\r\nviolent murders and massacres so often associated in the public mind\r\nwith Indian-white relations, but minor irritations concerning property\r\nand animals. The settlers let their hogs run wild. The hogs would get\r\ninto the Indians' corn. The Indians would kill the hogs. The settlers\r\nwould demand satisfaction. Many acts of the Assembly testify to the fact\r\nthat shooting of wild hogs was one of the most frequent points of\r\ndispute not only between the English and the Indians but among the\r\nEnglish themselves. It was one reason why early Assemblies provided\r\nstrict rules for erecting adequate fences around cultivated fields and\r\nestablishing lines of responsibility for damage caused by straying\r\ncattle or hogs. On the frontier, however, such refinements of\r\ncivilization as fences were long in coming. What was more natural than\r\nthat the same conflicts which arose among the English in the early years\r\nof settlement should arise between the English and the Indians on the\r\nfrontier. The tragedy was that English-Indian conflicts were not\r\nnormally settled in the courts as were conflicts between Englishmen. The\r\ncourts did deal with Indian-white conflicts to a certain extent, but, as\r\nnoted before, the local justices were often the very persons the Indians\r\naccused of oppressing them. Sometimes the Indians were able to bring\r\ntheir complaints before the General Court in Jamestown. But often the\r\ndispute was settled in the wilderness in the traditional frontier way:\r\nby violence. Since the settlers had weapons of violence superior to\r\nthose possessed by the Indians, it was not very frequently that the\r\nIndians won their \"case.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Assemblies of these years there is occasional mention of the\r\nsplitting of counties in two parts, or of the formation of new parishes.\r\nUsually these divisions were made along rivers or streams. Such\r\nlegislation suggests that settlement was spreading back from the water\r\nroutes into the land area between streams. The early counties were\r\nnormally set up to embrace the area on both sides of watercourses, even\r\nbroad rivers like the James and York. The rivers were, in the early\r\nperiod of settlement, bonds that linked the settlers on either side to\r\neach other. It was natural that rivers should be the principal\r\nthoroughfares of the country. But as settlement spread into the\r\ninterior, up the tributary streams that issued into the larger rivers,\r\nthe natural social unit that developed was that of communities on the\r\nsame side of the river. Hence the gradual conversion of rivers into\r\npolitical boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of March 1655, for the first time in Virginia's history,\r\nrestricted the voting privilege to \"housekeepers whether freeholders,\r\nleaseholders, or otherwise tenants.\" Freemen who could not qualify as\r\nhouseholders, even though they may have been grown sons living in their\r\nfather's house, could not vote. It is significant that this first\r\nrestriction on the right to vote in Virginia came not under a royal\r\ngovernor, but under so-called \"Parliamentary\" rule. So unpopular was\r\nthis enactment that it was amended by an act of the Assembly of March\r\n1656 on the grounds that \"we conceive it something hard and unagreeable\r\nto reason that any persons shall pay equall taxes and yet have no votes\r\nin elections.\" Freemen were again allowed to vote provided that they did\r\nnot do so \"in a tumultuous way.\"\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of March 1656 passed an act which attempted to solve the\r\nIndian problem in a way that had never been tried before but has been\r\nfrequently tried since. The plan was to encourage the growth of an\r\nacquisitive spirit among the Indians to serve as a counterweight to the\r\nacquisitive spirit of the English. The preamble to the act asserted that\r\nthe danger of war from the Indians stemmed from two causes: \"our\r\nextreame pressures on them and theire wanting of something to hazard and\r\nloose beside their lives.\" Therefore the Assembly enacted that for every\r\neight wolves' heads brought in by the Indians, the King or great man of\r\nthe Indians should have a cow delivered to him at the public charge.\r\n\"This will be a step to civilizing them and to making them Christians,\"\r\nthe act went on; \"besides it will certainly make the comanding Indians\r\nwatch over their own men that they do us no injuries, knowing that by\r\ntheire default they may be in danger of losing their estates.\" The\r\nAssembly also attempted to make the lands possessed by the Indians under\r\nthe seal of the colony inalienable to the English. Otherwise, constant\r\npressure on the Indians by the settlers would force them over and over\r\nagain to dispose of their lands.\r\n\r\nMany people fail to realize that the Indians of Virginia lived in\r\nwell-defined towns or settlements. It was, indeed, the Indians who lived\r\nan \"urban\" life in the seventeenth century while the English settlers\r\nwere usually scattered about the countryside. The conventional picture\r\nof the Indian roaming the forests, living solely by hunting and fishing,\r\nis mistaken. The Indian did hunt and fish, as many of us do today. But\r\nhis support came in large measure from the corn and vegetables growing\r\nin the fields which adjoined every Indian town. The Indians had a\r\nclose-knit and harmonious community life. They were only indirectly\r\ntouched by the white man's money economy and were usually content to\r\nraise only what food they needed for their own consumption. They were\r\nnot infected with the restless, individualistic spirit of the white\r\nsettler who constantly worked to accumulate a monetary surplus from the\r\nreturns on his single cash crop, tobacco.\r\n\r\nLike later attempts to destroy the group-centered society of the Indians\r\nin favor of a self-centered society, this attempt of 1656 was not\r\ncompletely successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN TROUBLES, 1656-1658\r\n\r\nEarly in 1656 word was received that six or seven hundred strange\r\nIndians from the mountains had come down and seated themselves near the\r\nfalls of the James. The March Assembly, considering how much blood it\r\nhad cost to \"expell and extirpate those perfidious and treacherous\r\nIndians which were there formerly,\" and considering how the area lay\r\nwithin the limits \"which in a just warr were formerly conquered by us,\"\r\nordered the two upper counties under Col. Edward Hill to send 100 men to\r\nremove the intruders peacefully, making war only in self-defense.\r\nMessages were sent to obtain the aid of the Pamunkeys, Chickahominies,\r\nand other neighboring Indians. Tottopottomoy, the King of the Pamunkeys,\r\njoined Hill with 100 of his warriors, although only the summer before\r\nhis brother had been murdered by an Englishman.\r\n\r\nThe western Indians had apparently come down to treat with the English\r\nabout trade, bringing with them many beaver skins to begin the\r\ncommerce. Col. Hill, however, despite the Assembly's command to avoid\r\nthe use of force, perfidiously had five of the kings who came to parley\r\nwith him put to death. \"This unparalleled hellish treachery and\r\nanti-christian perfidy more to be detested than any heathenish\r\ninhumanity,\" a contemporary wrote, \"cannot but stink most abominably in\r\nthe nosetrils of as many Indians, as shall be infested with the least\r\nscent of it, even to their perpetual abhorring and abandoning of the\r\nvery sight and name of an English man, till some new generation of a\r\nbetter extract shall be transplanted among them!\" In the fight that\r\nensued Tottopottomoy lost his life fighting bravely for the English.\r\nDespite his fidelity, neither he nor his tribe was honorably treated by\r\nthe English, the very land he owned being extorted from him and his\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nHill himself was found guilty by the unanimous vote of the Burgesses and\r\nCouncil of \"crimes and weaknesses\" in his conduct of the campaign. He\r\nwas ordered suspended from all offices, military and civil, and made\r\nliable for the charge of procuring a peace with the Indians with whom he\r\nhad so treacherously dealt.\r\n\r\nThe disgraceful episode of Hill's campaign may have caused some\r\nsoul-searching in the Assembly that met following the event, for, in\r\naddition to censuring Hill, it repealed an act which had made it lawful\r\nto kill an Indian committing a trespass. It pointed out that since the\r\noath of the person killing the Indian was considered sufficient evidence\r\nto prove the alleged trespass, killing Indians, \"though never so\r\ninnocent,\" had come to be of \"small account\" with the settlers. Since\r\nthe colony would probably be involved in endless wars and might \"expect\r\na success answerable to the injustice of our beginning if no act be made\r\nfor the future to prevent this wanton and unnecessary shedding of\r\nblood,\" the Assembly attempted to provide some protection for the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThat expansion into the Indians' territory continued is shown by the\r\nauthorization given by this same Assembly of December 1656 to form the\r\ncounty of Rappahannock on both sides of the Rappahannock River above\r\nLancaster County. Confirmation of the movement towards the frontier is\r\nshown in the report to the same Assembly by the sheriffs of Isle of\r\nWight County and Elizabeth City County, both at the mouth of the James\r\nRiver, that their counties were overrated in the tax lists of \"tithable\"\r\npersons by thirty-eight and thirty-two persons respectively. The\r\nAssembly ordered that their tax allotments should be reduced accordingly\r\nand laid upon Lancaster County \"where they are increased since the last\r\nyear's list 152 persons.\" An act of the Assembly of March 1658 similarly\r\ntook note of the numbers of inhabitants who had \"deserted their\r\nplantations and receded into the bay of Chisapeake\" without having\r\nsatisfied their creditors. It prescribed penalties for removing without\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nBills guaranteeing the Indians their lands, justice, and personal\r\nfreedom continued to pass. The acts freely admitted that previous\r\nguarantees to this effect had been ineffective and that \"manie English\r\ndoe still intrench upon the said Indians' land,\" which the Assembly\r\nconceived to be \"contrary to justice, and the true intent of the English\r\nplantation in this country.\" Nevertheless attempts to legislate justice\r\nfor the Indians continued. It could not be done. The power of the\r\nAssembly's acts was not equal to the power of the frontiersmen's\r\nmuskets. However, the acts of the Assembly were not without effect, and\r\nin many cases served their purpose. One of the most notable acts of this\r\nAssembly provided that no grants of land should be made to any\r\nEnglishman in the future until the Indians had first been guaranteed\r\nfifty acres for each bowman. The good intent of this act seems to have\r\nbeen a direct consequence of the practice that had arisen in the\r\npreceding years of granting patents to Englishmen for land occupied by\r\nthe Indians. It was an attempt to make sure that the Indians would not\r\nbe wholly dispossessed to satisfy the land hunger of the English.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: National Portrait Gallery, London\r\n\r\nOLIVER CROMWELL\r\n\r\nPainting by Robert Walker]\r\n\r\n\r\nPARLIAMENTARY GOVERNORS, 1652-1659\r\n\r\nEarly writers on Virginia history tended to overemphasize how completely\r\naffairs in Virginia during the Commonwealth and Protectorate periods\r\nwere in the hands of the House of Burgesses. Still, the House did assume\r\nto itself many of the powers of government in the period and asserted\r\nits ultimate authority in all other matters. It took this position out\r\nof necessity, and always with the proviso that, should instructions come\r\nfrom the supreme power in England, it would obey them.\r\n\r\nThe first Governor under the Commonwealth, Richard Bennett, was\r\nappointed by an act of Assembly on April 30, 1652, his term to last for\r\none year or until the following meeting of the Assembly, with the\r\nfurther proviso that the appointment should be in effect \"untill the\r\nfurther pleasures of the states be knowne.\" Bennett, a planter of\r\nNansemond County, was a Puritan in his religious outlook and was one of\r\nthose who had invited New England to send ministers to Virginia in the\r\nearly 1640's. When Parliament decided to conquer the colony in 1651 it\r\nappointed him one of the commissioners for the enterprise. It is\r\nprobable that the secret instructions issued to Bennett by the\r\nParliamentary authorities required him to come to some agreement with\r\nthe Burgesses on who should be Governor until a more formal commission\r\nfor the office should issue from the supreme power in England. However,\r\nas the years passed, and as instructions from England failed to deal\r\nwith Virginia's problems, the House of Burgesses asserted its\r\nprerogative more and more.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 1655, Edward Digges was elected Governor by the Assembly to\r\nreplace Bennett. Digges was the son of Sir Dudley Digges, Master of the\r\nRolls under Charles I. He came to Virginia sometime before 1650 and\r\nbought a plantation on the York River, subsequently known as\r\n\"Bellfield.\" The plantation become famous for the quality of the tobacco\r\ngrown there, and was also the scene of Digges's efforts at silk\r\nproduction, in the culture of which he employed three Armenians. When\r\nDigges decided to return to England in 1656, Samuel Mathews was elected\r\nto succeed him. There is some confusion as to whether Governor Mathews\r\nwas the man who so bedeviled Sir John Harvey in the 1630's, or his son\r\nof the same name.\r\n\r\nWhen Mathews and the Council attempted to dissolve the Assembly on April\r\n1, 1658, the Burgesses answered that the Governor's action was illegal,\r\nand that they would remain and complete their work. Mathews refused to\r\nconcede their point formally, though he declared his willingness to\r\nallow them to continue in fact while the dispute was submitted to the\r\nLord Protector in England. The Burgesses declared his answer\r\nunsatisfactory. They demanded a specific acknowledgment that the House\r\nremained undissolved. Mathews and the Council finally agreed to revoke\r\nthe declaration of dissolution, but still insisted on referring the\r\ndispute to the Lord Protector. The House rejected this answer as well,\r\nasserting that the present power of Virginia resided in the Burgesses,\r\nwho were not dissolvable by any power extant in Virginia but themselves.\r\nThey directed the High Sheriff of James City County not to execute any\r\nwarrant but from the Speaker of the House. In addition, they ordered\r\nCol. William Claiborne, the Secretary of the Council, to surrender the\r\nrecords of the country into the hands of John Smith, the Speaker of the\r\nAssembly, on the basis of the Burgesses' declaration to hold \"supreame\r\npower of this country.\"\r\n\r\nThat the House of Burgesses did not mean its actions to be in defiance\r\nof the power that existed in England, however, is shown by its agreement\r\nto proclaim Richard, son of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector when the\r\nGovernor sent down, at the March 1659 session, an official letter from\r\nHis Highness' Council requiring that it be done. Immediately after\r\nagreeing to proclaim Richard, the Burgesses decided to address the new\r\nLord Protector for confirmation of the privilege granted to the\r\nAssembly, perhaps under the terms of Bennett's secret instructions, to\r\nelect its own officers. Although the Speaker of the House assured the\r\nBurgesses that the Governor was willing to join them in such a request,\r\nsome of the Burgesses expressed a desire to hear the assurance from the\r\nGovernor's own lips. Accordingly, he was sent for and, to the\r\nsatisfaction of the Burgesses, \"acknowledged the supream power of\r\nelecting officers to be by the present lawes resident in the Grand\r\nAssembly.\" He promised to join them in requesting confirmation of these\r\nprivileges from His Highness.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, at this same session, passed an act electing Mathews\r\nGovernor again for two years \"and then the Grand Assembly to elect a\r\nGovernour as they shall think fitt.\" The act was to be in force \"until\r\nhis Highness pleasure be further signified.\" William Claiborne was\r\nappointed Secretary of State on his acknowledgment that he received the\r\nplace from the Assembly, and with the proviso that he should continue\r\nSecretary until the next Assembly or until the Lord Protector's pleasure\r\nshould be further signified to the colony.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly of 1659 marks the high water point of local government in\r\nVirginia. Not only were the Burgesses supreme in matters of general\r\nlegislation, compelling the Governor and Secretary to bow to their\r\nsovereign power, but in their home counties affairs were conducted much\r\nas the local justices saw fit. The Assembly of 1659 even authorized free\r\ntrade with the Indians by anyone in any goods--even guns and ammunition.\r\nNever before had regulation on a point of such vital interest to the\r\nsecurity of the colony been so utterly abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECALL OF SIR WILLIAM BERKELEY BY THE ASSEMBLY, 1659-1660\r\n\r\nSoon after the Assembly of March 1659 ended, Richard Cromwell resigned\r\nthe reins of government in England. The English nation was again plunged\r\ninto turmoil. Letters arriving in Virginia spoke of the people divided\r\n\"some for one Government some for another.\" The prospect of London\r\n\"burned into Ashes and the streets running with blood\" was held a\r\nlikely outcome of the divisions.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this troublous situation, Governor Mathews died. The\r\nnext Assembly met in March 1660. In a move that has astonished\r\nhistorians since that time it asked Sir William Berkeley, the royal\r\nGovernor whom its former leaders had deposed, to govern Virginia again.\r\nNo royal banners were unfurled; Charles II was not proclaimed King. The\r\nHouse of Burgesses, holding the supreme power in the colony, merely\r\noffered the governorship to the man who had been universally admired for\r\nhis justice, humanity, and willingness to sacrifice his own interest to\r\nthat of the colony.\r\n\r\nBerkeley had been unwilling to disavow his loyalty to the Crown in 1652\r\nand he was not prepared to do so now. He replied to the Burgesses'\r\ninvitation by saying that he would not dare to offend the King by\r\naccepting a commission to govern from any power in England opposed to\r\nhim. He urged them to choose instead a more vigorous man from amongst\r\ntheir own number. But he did offer to accept the governorship directly\r\nfrom the House of Burgesses if the Council would concur with the\r\nBurgesses in offering it to him. He promised that if thereafter any\r\nsupreme power in England succeeded in re-establishing its authority in\r\nVirginia he would immediately lay down his commission and \"will live\r\nmost submissively obedient to any power God shall set over me, as the\r\nexperience of eight yeares have shewed I have done.\" He would not refuse\r\ntheir call, he wrote, if they accepted his conditions, for \"I should be\r\nworthily thought hospitall mad, if I would not change povertie for\r\nwealth,--contempt for honor.\"\r\n\r\nThe Council on March 21, 1660, unanimously concurred in the Burgesses'\r\nchoice of Berkeley as Governor, and the King's loyal servant was\r\nthereupon installed in the office.\r\n\r\nSome historians have seen the election of Berkeley as the signal for a\r\nroyalist purge of the Parliamentary influences that were thought to\r\nhave existed in the colony since 1652. A study of the membership of the\r\nHouse of Burgesses, Council, and county courts, however, shows a\r\ncontinuity of membership which extends from before the Parliamentary\r\nseizure of the colony until after the restoration of King Charles II.\r\nThe evidence suggests that there was no violent division between\r\nroyalists and Parliamentarians in Virginia. The people were Virginians\r\nfirst and royalists or Parliamentarians second. The solidarity of their\r\npolitical interests was a harbinger of the American independence that\r\nwas slowly to mature in the next century.\r\n\r\nOn May 29, 1660, the birthday of Charles II, that monarch returned to\r\nLondon and was restored to the throne of England. Word of the\r\nrestoration was received in Virginia in the fall, and Berkeley ordered\r\nthe sheriffs and chief officers of all counties to proclaim Charles II\r\nKing of England, and to cause all writs and warrants from that time on\r\nto issue in His Majesty's name. The Assembly of March 1661, taking into\r\nconsideration the fact that the colony, by submitting to the \"execrable\r\npower\" of the Parliamentary forces, had thereby become guilty of the\r\ncrimes of that power, enacted that January 30, the day Charles I was\r\nbeheaded, should \"be annually solemnized with fasting and prayers that\r\nour sorrowes may expiate our crime and our teares wash away our guilt.\"\r\nAnother act declared May 29, the day of Charles II's birth and\r\nrestoration, a holy day to be annually celebrated \"in testimony of our\r\nthankfulnesse and joy.\"\r\n\r\nThus ended the brief period in which Virginia's government was turned\r\nupside down and permanent alteration caused in her relations with\r\nEngland. Although the King once more became the symbol of the unity of\r\nthe colony and the mother country, the royal prerogative would never\r\nagain be blindly accepted by the people of either place. Larger\r\ndevelopments in the economic, social, and intellectual spheres were\r\nbringing to an end the era of all-powerful Kings. Power had descended to\r\nthe lower ranks of society, and that power was beginning to be brought\r\ninto play.\r\n\r\nThis larger shift of power has been chronicled in the story of Virginia\r\nfrom 1625 to 1660. It is the story of a small community of Englishmen\r\ntransplanted to American shores, living for a time subject to\r\ntraditional English restraints, then, in a period of rapid expansion,\r\nlosing their cohesiveness and their values under the impact of the\r\nAmerican experience and their own natures. Their political expression\r\nsoon passed from a passive to an active mode. The law became something\r\nthey made, not something someone else applied to them. Land was\r\nsimilarly not something bestowed on them by generous parents, but\r\nsomething one took from Nature, or Nature's surrogate, the Indian. Labor\r\nwas no longer a privilege allowed the individual by the community, but a\r\nprecious gift contributed by the individual to the community. In sum,\r\nthe ordinary people who had removed themselves to the New World soon\r\ndiscovered that they were no longer humble servants of great lords, but\r\nwere themselves lords of the American earth. If they had the power why\r\nnot exercise it? The process by which the rulers of the people were\r\nforced to become the \"servants\" of their \"subjects\" thereupon began. The\r\nculmination of this rearrangement of the political atoms of society was\r\nthe War for Independence of 1776. Whether the swing from authority to\r\nliberty was for good or for evil is not for the historian to say.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother booklet in this series contains a selected bibliography of works\r\non seventeenth-century Virginia. The interested student should consult\r\nthat booklet for a more detailed listing of works used in preparing this\r\naccount of Virginia in the period 1625-1660.\r\n\r\nThe best secondary account of Virginia in the period covered by this\r\nbooklet is Wesley Frank Craven, _The Southern Colonies in the\r\nSeventeenth Century, 1607-1689_ (Baton Rouge, 1949). Craven skilfully\r\ncombines research in Virginia local history with a broad understanding\r\nof developments in England and in other colonies. He points out the\r\nsocial and political significance of many hitherto ignored aspects of\r\nVirginia history. Other important works include Charles McLean Andrews,\r\n_The Colonial Period of American History_, I (New Haven, 1934), Thomas\r\nJefferson Wertenbaker, _Virginia under the Stuarts_ (Princeton, 1914),\r\nHerbert L. Osgood, _The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century_, 3\r\nvols. (New York, 1904-1907), and Edward D. Neill, _Virginia Carolorum:\r\nThe Colony under the Rule of Charles the First and Second, A.D.\r\n1625-A.D. 1685_ (Albany, 1886).\r\n\r\nAny study of colonial Virginia must begin with a perusal of Philip\r\nAlexander Bruce, _Economic History of Virginia in the Seventeenth\r\nCentury_, 2 vols. (New York, 1895), and his _Institutional History of\r\nVirginia in the Seventeenth Century_, 2 vols. (New York, 1910). Bruce's\r\nwork is the indispensable platform upon which political and social\r\naccounts of the period must rest. Morgan Poitîaux Robinson, _Virginia\r\nCounties: Those Resulting from Virginia Legislation_ [Virginia State\r\nLibrary, Bulletin, IX, Nos. 1-3] (Richmond, 1916), is a carefully\r\ndocumented study of the growth of Virginia as evidenced by the formation\r\nof its counties. Maps showing the area of settlement at frequent\r\nintervals give a graphic account of the nature and extent of Virginia's\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of local histories chronicling the growth of\r\nparticular regions in Virginia. An outstanding local history is Fairfax\r\nHarrison, _Landmarks of Old Prince William_ (Richmond, 1924), which\r\nanalyzes the growth of settlement in the Potomac River valley. Histories\r\nof the Eastern Shore are numerous: Susie M. Ames, _Studies of the\r\nVirginia Eastern Shore in the Seventeenth Century_ (Richmond, 1940),\r\nJennings Cropper Wise, _Ye Kingdome of Accawmacke, or the Eastern Shore\r\nof Virginia in the Seventeenth Century_ (Richmond, 1911), and Ralph T.\r\nWhitelaw, _Virginia's Eastern Shore_, 2 vols. (Richmond, 1951).\r\n\r\nA reading of but a few works in Virginia history will be enough to show\r\nthat the interpretations and conclusions of the authors must be accepted\r\nwith extreme caution. There are two conflicting interpretations for\r\nnearly every important event in Virginia's history. History may be\r\ndefined as the attempt to state what happened in the past on the basis\r\nof inadequate evidence existing in the present. The reader should keep\r\nalways in mind that historical writing is largely a series of guesses\r\nmore or less intelligently elaborated.\r\n\r\nMuch of the original manuscript material upon which an account of the\r\nperiod must be based has been published in the following sources:\r\nWilliam Waller Hening, _The Statutes at Large; being a Collection of all\r\nthe Laws of Virginia_, Vol. I (Richmond, 1809), H. R. McIlwaine,\r\n_Minutes of the Council and General Court of Colonial Virginia,\r\n1622-1632, 1670-1676_ (Richmond, 1924), H. R. McIlwaine, _Journals of\r\nthe House of Burgesses of Virginia, 1619-1658/59_ (Richmond, 1914), Nell\r\nMarion Nugent, _Cavaliers and Pioneers: Abstracts of Virginia Land\r\nPatents and Grants, 1623-1666_ (Richmond, 1934), _Virginia Magazine of\r\nHistory and Biography_ (Richmond, 1893 to present), _William and Mary\r\nQuarterly_ (Williamsburg, 1892 to present), _The Southern Literary\r\nMessenger_, January 1845 (documents on the recall of Governor Berkeley\r\nby the Burgesses and Council of Virginia in 1660), and W. Noel\r\nSainsbury, _Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, 1574-1660,\r\nPreserved in the State Paper Department of Her Majesty's Public Record\r\nOffice_ (London, 1860). The essential guide to most of this material is\r\nEarl G. Swern, _Virginia Historical Index_, 2 vols. (Roanoke, 1934).\r\n\r\nThe most important unpublished manuscript materials of the period are\r\nthe county records, some of which are complete from the earliest period\r\nof settlement. Originals or transcripts of the county records are\r\navailable in the Virginia State Library, Richmond. Another important\r\nsource of unpublished manuscript material for the period is the\r\n\"Virginia, Book No. 43\" manuscript in the Library of Congress,\r\nWashington, D. C., which contains numerous commissions and proclamations\r\nfor the period 1626-1634. Among the Virginia papers of the Barons of\r\nSackville, Knole Park, are a few documents relating to the period which\r\nhave not been printed either in the documentary articles in the\r\n_American Historical Review_, XXVII (1922), Nos. 3-4, or elsewhere. They\r\nare now available on microfilm in the Library of Congress, having been\r\nphotographed by the British Manuscripts Project of the American Council\r\nof Learned Societies.\r\n\r\nImportant unpublished dissertations include James Kimbrough Owen, \"The\r\nVirginia Vestry: A Study in the Decline of a Ruling Class\" (Ph. D.\r\ndissertation, Princeton University, 1947), and Edna Jensen, \"Sir John\r\nHarvey: Governor of Virginia\" (M. A. thesis, University of Virginia,\r\n1950).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Virginia Farrer Map of Virginia, 1651, showing common\r\ngeographical misconceptions of the period.]",
