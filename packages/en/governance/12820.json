  "content": "THE CASE FOR INDIA\r\n\r\nThe Presidential Address Delivered by Annie Besant at the\r\nThirty-Second Indian National Congress Held at Calcutta\r\n26th December 1917\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFELLOW-DELEGATES AND FRIENDS,\r\n\r\nEveryone who has preceded me in this Chair has rendered his thanks in\r\nfitting terms for the gift which is truly said to be the highest that\r\nIndia has it in her power to bestow. It is the sign of her fullest love,\r\ntrust, and approval, and the one whom she seats in that chair is, for\r\nhis year of service, her chosen leader. But if my predecessors found\r\nfitting words for their gratitude, in what words can I voice mine, whose\r\ndebt to you is so overwhelmingly greater than theirs? For the first time\r\nin Congress history, you have chosen as your President one who, when\r\nyour choice was made, was under the heavy ban of Government displeasure,\r\nand who lay interned as a person dangerous to public safety. While I was\r\nhumiliated, you crowned me with honour; while I was slandered, you\r\nbelieved in my integrity and good faith; while I was crushed under the\r\nheel of bureaucratic power, you acclaimed me as your leader; while I was\r\nsilenced and unable to defend myself, you defended me, and won for me\r\nrelease. I was proud to serve in lowliest fashion, but you lifted me up\r\nand placed me before the world as your chosen representative. I have no\r\nwords with which to thank you, no eloquence with which to repay my debt.\r\nMy deeds must speak for me, for words are too poor. I turn your gift\r\ninto service to the Motherland; I consecrate my life anew to her in\r\nworship by action. All that I have and am, I lay on the Altar of the\r\nMother, and together we shall cry, more by service than by words: VANDE\r\nMATARAM.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, one value in your election of me in this crisis of\r\nIndia’s destiny, seeing that I have not the privilege to be Indian-born,\r\nbut come from that little island in the northern seas which has been, in\r\nthe West, the builder-up of free institutions. The Aryan emigrants, who\r\nspread over the lands of Europe, carried with them the seeds of liberty\r\nsown in their blood in their Asian cradle-land. Western historians trace\r\nthe self-rule of the Saxon villages to their earlier prototypes in the\r\nEast, and see the growth of English liberty as up-springing from the\r\nAryan root of the free and self-contained village communities.\r\n\r\nIts growth was crippled by Norman feudalism there, as its\r\nmillennia-nourished security here was smothered by the East India\r\nCompany. But in England it burst its shackles and nurtured a\r\nliberty-loving people and a free Commons’ House. Here, it similarly\r\nbourgeoned out into the Congress activities, and more recently into\r\nthose of the Muslim League, now together blossoming into Home Rule for\r\nIndia. The England of Milton, Cromwell, Sydney, Burke, Paine, Shelley,\r\nWilberforce, Gladstone; the England that sheltered Mazzini, Kossuth,\r\nKropotkin, Stepniak, and that welcomed Garibaldi; the England that is\r\nthe enemy of tyranny, the foe of autocracy, the lover of freedom, that\r\nis the England I would fain here represent to you to-day. To-day, when\r\nIndia stands erect, no suppliant people, but a Nation, self-conscious,\r\nself-respecting, determined to be free; when she stretches out her hand\r\nto Britain and offers friendship not subservience; co-operation not\r\nobedience; to-day let me: western-born but in spirit eastern, cradled in\r\nEngland but Indian by choice and adoption: let me stand as the symbol of\r\nunion between Great Britain and India: a union of hearts and free\r\nchoice, not of compulsion: and therefore of a tie which cannot be\r\nbroken, a tie of love and of mutual helpfulness, beneficial to both\r\nNations and blessed by God.\r\n\r\nGONE TO THE PEACE.\r\n\r\nIndia’s great leader, Dadabhai Naoroji, has left his mortal body and is\r\nnow one of the company of the Immortals, who watch over and aid India’s\r\nprogress. He is with V.C. Bonnerjee, and Ranade, and A.O. Hume, and\r\nHenry Cotton, and Pherozeshah Mehta, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale: the\r\ngreat men who, in Swinburne’s noble verse, are the stars which lead us\r\nto Liberty’s altar:\r\n\r\n    These, O men, shall ye honour,\r\n        Liberty only and these.\r\n    For thy sake and for all men’s and mine,\r\n    Brother, the crowns of them shine,\r\n    Lighting the way to her shrine,\r\n    That our eyes may be fastened upon her,\r\n        That our hands may encompass her knees.\r\n\r\nNot for me to praise him in feeble words of reverence or of homage. His\r\ndeeds praise him, and his service to his country is his abiding glory.\r\nOur gratitude will be best paid by following in his footsteps, alike in\r\nhis splendid courage and his unfaltering devotion, so that we may win\r\nthe Home Rule which he longed to see while with us, and shall see, ere\r\nlong, from the other world of Life, in which he dwells to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nPRE-WAR MILITARY EXPENDITURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great War, into the whirlpool of which Nation after Nation has been\r\ndrawn, has entered on its fourth year. The rigid censorship which has\r\nbeen established makes it impossible for any outside the circle of\r\nGovernments to forecast its duration, but to me, speaking for a moment\r\nnot as a politician but as a student of spiritual laws, to me its end is\r\nsure. For the true object of this War is to prove the evil of, and to\r\ndestroy, autocracy and the enslavement of one Nation by another, and to\r\nplace on sure foundations the God-given Right to Self-Rule and\r\nSelf-Development of every Nation, and the similar right of the\r\nIndividual, of the smaller Self, so far as is consistent with the\r\nwelfare of the larger Self of the Nation. The forces which make for the\r\nprolongation of autocracy--the rule of one--and the even deadlier\r\nbureaucracy--the rule of a close body welded into an iron system--these\r\nhave been gathered together in the Central Powers of Europe--as of old\r\nin Ravana--in order that they may be destroyed; for the New Age cannot\r\nbe opened until the Old passes away. The new civilisation of\r\nRighteousness and Justice, and therefore of Brotherhood, of ordered\r\nLiberty, of Peace, of Happiness, cannot be built up until the elements\r\nare removed which have brought the old civilisation crashing about our\r\nears. Therefore is it necessary that the War shall be fought out to its\r\nappointed end, and that no premature peace shall leave its object\r\nunattained. Autocracy and bureaucracy must perish utterly, in East and\r\nWest, and, in order that their germs may not re-sprout in the future,\r\nthey must be discredited in the minds of men. They must be proved to be\r\nless efficient than the Governments of Free Peoples, even in their\r\nfavourite work of War, and their iron machinery--which at first brings\r\nouter prosperity and success--must be shown to be less lasting and\r\neffective than the living and flexible organisations of democratic\r\nPeoples. They must be proved failures before the world, so that the\r\nglamour of superficial successes may be destroyed for ever. They have\r\nhad their day and their place in evolution, and have done their\r\neducative work. Now they are out-of-date, unfit for survival, and must\r\nvanish away.\r\n\r\nWhen Great Britain sprang to arms, it was in defence of the freedom of a\r\nsmall nation, guaranteed by treaties, and the great principles she\r\nproclaimed electrified India and the Dominions. They all sprang to her\r\nside without question, without delay; they heard the voice of old\r\nEngland, the soldier of Liberty, and it thrilled their hearts. All were\r\nunprepared, save the small territorial army of Great Britain, due to the\r\ngenius and foresight of Lord Haldane, and the readily mobilised army of\r\nIndia, hurled into the fray by the swift decision of Lord Hardinge. The\r\nlittle army of Britain fought for time; fought to stop the road to\r\nParis, the heart of France; fought, falling back step by step, and\r\ngained the time it fought for, till India’s sons stood on the soil of\r\nFrance, were flung to the front, rushed past the exhausted regiments who\r\ncheered them with failing breath, charged the advancing hosts, stopped\r\nthe retreat, and joined the British army in forming that unbreakable\r\nline which wrestled to the death through two fearful winters--often,\r\nthese soldiers of the tropics, waist-deep in freezing mud--and knew no\r\nsurrender.\r\n\r\nIndia, with her clear vision, saw in Great Britain the champion of\r\nFreedom, in Germany the champion of Despotism. And she saw rightly.\r\nRightly she stood by Great Britain, despite her own lack of freedom and\r\nthe coercive legislation which outrivalled German despotism, knowing\r\nthese to be temporary, because un-English, and therefore doomed to\r\ndestruction; she spurned the lure of German gold and rejected German\r\nappeals to revolt. She offered men and money; her educated classes, her\r\nVakils, offered themselves as Volunteers, pleaded to be accepted. Then\r\nthe never-sleeping distrust of Anglo-India rejected the offer, pressed\r\nfor money, rejected men. And, slowly, educated India sank back,\r\ndepressed and disheartened, and a splendid opportunity for knitting\r\ntogether the two Nations was lost.\r\n\r\nEarly in the War I ventured to say that the War could not end until\r\nEngland recognised that autocracy and bureaucracy must perish in India\r\nas well as in Europe. The good Bishop of Calcutta, with a courage worthy\r\nof his free race, lately declared that it would be hypocritical to pray\r\nfor victory over autocracy in Europe and to maintain it in India. Now it\r\nhas been clearly and definitely declared that Self-Government is to be\r\nthe objective of Great Britain in India, and that a substantial measure\r\nof it is to be given at once; when this promise is made good by the\r\ngranting of the Reforms outlined last year in Lucknow, then the end of\r\nthe War will be in sight. For the War cannot end till the death-knell of\r\nautocracy is sounded.\r\n\r\nCauses, with which I will deal presently and for which India was not\r\nresponsible, have somewhat obscured the first eager expressions of\r\nIndia’s sympathy, and have forced her thoughts largely towards her own\r\nposition in the Empire. But that does not detract from the immense aid\r\nshe has given, and is still giving. It must not be forgotten that long\r\nbefore the present War she had submitted--at first, while she had no\r\npower of remonstrance, and later, after 1885, despite the constant\r\nprotests of Congress--to an ever-rising military expenditure, due partly\r\nto the amalgamation scheme of 1859, and partly to the cost of various\r\nwars beyond her frontiers, and to continual recurring frontier and\r\ntrans-frontier expeditions, in which she had no real interest. They were\r\nsent out for supposed Imperial advantages, not for her own.\r\n\r\nBetween 1859 and 1904--45 years--Indian troops were engaged in\r\nthirty-seven wars and expeditions. There were ten wars: the two Chinese\r\nWars of 1860 and 1900, the Bhutan War of 1864-65, the Abyssinian War of\r\n1868, the Afghan War of 1878-79, and, after the massacre of the Kabul\r\nMission, the second War of 1879-80, ending in an advance of the\r\nfrontier, in the search for an ever receding “scientific frontier”; on\r\nthis occasion the frontier was shifted, says Keene, “from the line of\r\nthe Indus to the western slope of the Suleiman range and from Peshawar\r\nto Quetta”; the Egyptian War of 1882, in which the Indian troops\r\nmarkedly distinguished themselves; the third Burmese War of 1885 ending\r\nin the annexation of Upper Burma in 1886; the invasions of Tibet in 1890\r\nand 1904. Of Expeditions, or minor Wars, there were 27; to Sitana in\r\n1858 on a small scale and in 1863 on a larger (the “Sitana Campaign”);\r\nto Nepal and Sikkim in 1859; to Sikkim in 1864; a serious struggle on\r\nthe North-west Frontier in 1868; expeditions against the Lushais in\r\n1871-72, the Daflas in 1874-75, the Nagas in 1875, the Afridis in 1877,\r\nthe Rampa Hill tribes in 1879, the Waziris and Nagas in 1881, the Akhas\r\nin 1884, and in the same year an expedition to the Zhob Valley, and a\r\nsecond thither in 1890. In 1888 and 1889 there was another expedition\r\nagainst Sikkim, against the Akozais (the Black Mountain Expedition) and\r\nagainst the Hill Tribes of the North-east, and in 1890 another Black\r\nMountain Expedition, with a third in 1892. In 1890 came the expedition\r\nto Manipur, and in 1891 there was another expedition against the\r\nLushais, and one into the Miranzal Valley. The Chitral Expedition\r\noccupied 1894-95, and the serious Tirah Campaign, in which 40,000 men\r\nwere engaged, came in 1897 and 1898. The long list--which I have closed\r\nwith 1904--ends with the expeditions against the Mahsuds in 1901,\r\nagainst the Kabalis in 1902, and the invasion of Tibet, before noted.\r\nAll these events explain the rise in military expenditure, and we must\r\nadd to them the sending of Indian troops to Malta and Cyprus in 1878--a\r\nsomewhat theatrical demonstration--and the expenditure of some\r\n£2,000,000 to face what was described as “the Russian Menace” in 1884.\r\nMost of these were due to Imperial, not to Indian, policy, and many of\r\nthe burdens imposed were protested against by the Government of India,\r\nwhile others were encouraged by ambitious Viceroys. I do not think that\r\neven this long list is complete.\r\n\r\nEver since the Government of India was taken over by the Crown, India\r\nhas been regarded as an Imperial military asset and training ground, a\r\nposition from which the jealousy of the East India Company had largely\r\nprotected her, by insisting that the army it supported should be used\r\nfor the defence and in the interests of India alone. Her value to the\r\nEmpire for military purposes would not so seriously have injured at once\r\nher pride and her finances if the natural tendencies of her martial\r\nraces had been permitted their previous scope; but the disarming of the\r\npeople, 20 years after the assumption of the Government by the Crown,\r\nemasculated the Nation, and the elimination of races supposed to be\r\nunwarlike, or in some cases too warlike to be trusted, threw recruitment\r\nmore and more to the north, and lowered the physique of the Bengalis and\r\nMadrasis, on whom the Company had largely depended.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the Punjab, on which Sir Michael O’Dwyer so\r\nvehemently insisted the other day, is an artificial superiority, created\r\nby the British system and policy; and the poor recruitment elsewhere, on\r\nwhich he laid offensive insistence, is due to the same system and\r\npolicy, which largely eliminated Bengalis, Madrasis and Mahrattas from\r\nthe army. In Bengal, however, the martial type has been revived, chiefly\r\nin consequence of what the Bengalis felt to be the intolerable insult of\r\nthe high-handed Partition of Bengal by Lord Curzon.\r\n\r\nOn this Gopal Krishna Gokhale said:\r\n\r\n     Bengal’s heroic stand against the oppression of a harsh and\r\n     uncontrolled bureaucracy has astonished and gratified all\r\n     India.... All India owes a deep debt of gratitude to Bengal.\r\n\r\nThe spirit evoked showed itself in the youth of Bengal by a practical\r\nrevolt, led by the elders, while it was confined to Swadeshi and\r\nBoycott, and rushing on, when it broke away from their authority, into\r\nconspiracy, assassination and dacoity: as had happened in similar\r\nrevolts with Young Italy, in the days of Mazzini, and with Young Russia\r\nin the days of Stepniak and Kropotkin. The results of their despair,\r\nnecessarily met by the halter and penal servitude, had to be faced by\r\nLord Hardinge and Lord Carmichael during the present War. Other results,\r\nhappy instead of disastrous in their nature, was the development of grit\r\nand endurance of a high character, shown in the courage of the Bengal\r\nlads in the serious floods that have laid parts of the Province deep\r\nunder water, and in their compassion and self-sacrifice in the relief of\r\nfamine. Their services in the present War--the Ambulance Corps and the\r\nreplacement of its _materiel_ when the ship carrying it sank, with the\r\nsplendid services rendered by it in Mesopotamia; the recruiting of a\r\nBengali regiment for active service, 900 strong, with another 900\r\nreserves to replace wastage, and recruiting still going on--these are\r\ninstances of the divine alchemy which brings the soul of good out of\r\nevil action, and consecrates to service the qualities evoked by\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nIn England, also, a similar result has been seen in a convict, released\r\nto go to the front, winning the Victoria Cross. It would be an act of\r\nstatesmanship, as well as of divinest compassion, to offer to every\r\nprisoner and interned captive, held for political crime or on political\r\nsuspicion, the opportunity of serving the Empire at the front. They\r\nmight, if thought necessary, form a separate battalion or a separate\r\nregiment, under stricter supervision, and yet be given a chance of\r\nredeeming their reputation, for they are mostly very young.\r\n\r\nThe financial burden incurred in consequence of the above conflicts, and\r\nof other causes, now to be mentioned, would not have been so much\r\nresented, if it had been imposed by India on herself, and if her own\r\nsons had profited by her being used as a training ground for the\r\nEmpire. But in this case, as in so many others, she has shared Imperial\r\nburdens, while not sharing Imperial freedom and power. Apart from this,\r\nthe change which made the Army so ruinous a burden on the resources of\r\nthe country was the system of “British reliefs,” the using of India as a\r\ntraining ground for British regiments, and the transfer of the men thus\r\ntrained, to be replaced by new ones under the short service system, the\r\ncost of the frequent transfers and their connected expenses being\r\ncharged on the Indian revenues, while the whole advantage was reaped by\r\nGreat Britain. On the short service system the Simla Army Commission\r\ndeclared:\r\n\r\n     The short service system recently introduced into the British\r\n     Army has increased the cost and has materially reduced the\r\n     efficiency of the British troops in India. We cannot resist the\r\n     feeling that, in the introduction of this system, the interest\r\n     of the Indian tax-payer was entirely left out of consideration.\r\n\r\nThe remark was certainly justified, for the short service system gave\r\nIndia only five years of the recruits she paid heavily for and trained,\r\nall the rest of the benefit going to England. The latter was enabled, as\r\nthe years went on, to enormously increase her Reserves, so that she has\r\nhad 400,000 men trained in, and at the cost of, India.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 the Indian army consisted of 140,000 men, with 65,000 white\r\nofficers. Great changes were made in 1885-1905, including the\r\nreorganisation under Lord Kitchener, who became Commander-in-Chief at\r\nthe end of 1902. Even in this hasty review, I must not omit reference to\r\nthe fact that Army Stores were drawn from Britain at enormous cost,\r\nwhile they should have been chiefly manufactured here, so that India\r\nmight have profited by the expenditure. Lately under the necessities of\r\nWar, factories have been turned to the production of munitions; but this\r\nshould have been done long ago, so that India might have been enriched\r\ninstead of exploited. The War has forced an investigation into her\r\nmineral resources that might have been made for her own sake, but\r\nGermany was allowed to monopolise the supply of minerals that India\r\ncould have produced and worked up, and would have produced and worked up\r\nhad she enjoyed Home Rule. India would have been richer, and the Empire\r\nsafer, had she been a partner instead of a possession. But this side of\r\nthe question will come under the matters directly affecting merchants,\r\nand we may venture to express a hope that the Government help extended\r\nto munition factories in time of War may be continued to industrial\r\nfactories in time of Peace. The net result of the various causes\r\nabove-mentioned was that the expense of the Indian army rose by leaps\r\nand bounds, until, before the War, India was expending, £21,000,000 as\r\nagainst the £28,000,000 expended by the United Kingdom, while the\r\nwealthy Dominions of Canada and Australia were spending only 1-1/2 and\r\n1-1/4 millions respectively. (I am not forgetting that the United\r\nKingdom was expending over £51,000,000 on her Navy, while India was free\r\nof that burden, save for a contribution of half a million.)\r\n\r\nSince 1885, the Congress has constantly protested against the\r\never-increasing military expenditure, but the voice of the Congress was\r\nsupposed to be the voice of sedition and of class ambition, instead of\r\nbeing, as it was the voice of educated Indians, the most truly patriotic\r\nand loyal class of the population. In 1885, in the First Congress, Mr.\r\nP. Rangiah Naidu pointed out that military expenditure had been\r\n£1,463,000 in 1857 and had risen to £16,975,750 in 1884. Mr. D.E. Wacha\r\nascribed the growth to the amalgamation scheme of 1859, and remarked\r\nthat the Company in 1856 had an army of 254,000 men at a cost of 11-1/2\r\nmillions, while in 1884 the Crown had an army of only 181,000 men at a\r\ncost of 17 millions. The rise was largely due to the increased cost of\r\nthe European regiments, overland transport service, stores, pensions,\r\nfurlough allowances, and the like, most of them imposed despite the\r\nresistance of the Government of India, which complained that the changes\r\nwere “made entirely, it may be said, from Imperial considerations, in\r\nwhich Indian interests have not been consulted or advanced.” India paid\r\nnearly, £700,000 a year, for instance, for “Home Depôts”--Home being\r\nEngland of course--in which lived some 20,000 to 22,000 British\r\nsoldiers, on the plea that their regiments, not they, were serving in\r\nIndia. I cannot follow out the many increases cited by Mr. Wacha, but\r\nmembers can refer to his excellent speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Fawcett once remarked that when the East India Company was abolished\r\n\r\n     the English people became directly responsible for the\r\n     Government of India. It cannot, I think, be denied that this\r\n     responsibility has been so imperfectly discharged that in many\r\n     respects the new system of Government compares unfavourably\r\n     with the old.... There was at that time an independent control\r\n     of expenditure which now seems to be almost entirely wanting.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Crown assumed the rule of India, Mr. Disraeli asked\r\nthe House of Commons to regard India as “a great and solemn trust\r\ncommitted to it by an all-wise and inscrutable Providence.” Mr. George\r\nYule, in the Fourth Congress, remarked on this: “The 650 odd members had\r\nthrown the trust back upon the hands of Providence, to be looked after\r\nas Providence itself thinks best.” Perhaps it is time that India should\r\nremember that Providence helps those who help themselves.\r\n\r\nYear after year the Congress continued to remonstrate against the cost\r\nof the army, until in 1902, after all the futile protests of the\r\nintervening years, it condemned an increase of pay to British soldiers\r\nin India which placed an additional burden on the Indian revenues of\r\n£786,000 a year, and pointed out that the British garrison was\r\nunnecessarily numerous, as was shown by the withdrawal of large bodies\r\nof British soldiers for service in South Africa and China. The very next\r\nyear Congress protested that the increasing military expenditure was not\r\nto secure India against internal disorder or external attack, but in\r\norder to carry out an Imperial policy; the Colonies contributed little\r\nor nothing to the Imperial Military Expenditure, while India bore the\r\ncost of about one-third of the whole British Army in addition to her own\r\nIndian troops. Surely these facts should be remembered when India’s\r\nmilitary services to the Empire are now being weighed.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 and 1905, the Congress declared that the then military\r\nexpenditure was beyond India’s power to bear, and in the latter year\r\nprayed that the additional ten millions sterling sanctioned for Lord\r\nKitchener’s reorganisation scheme might be devoted to education and the\r\nreduction of the burden on the raiyats. In 1908, the burdens imposed by\r\nthe British War Office since 1859 were condemned, and in the next year\r\nit was pointed out that the military expenditure was nearly a third of\r\nthe whole Indian revenue, and was starving Education and Sanitation.\r\n\r\nLord Kitchener’s reorganisation scheme kept the Indian Army on a War\r\nfooting, ready for immediate mobilisation, and on January 1, 1915, the\r\nregular army consisted of 247,000 men, of whom 75,000 were English; it\r\nwas the money spent by India in maintaining this army for years in\r\nreadiness for War which made it possible for her to go to the help of\r\nGreat Britain at the critical early period to which I alluded. She spent\r\nover £20 millions on the military services in 1914-15. In 1915-16 she\r\nspent £21.8 millions. In 1916-17 her military budget had risen to £12\r\nmillions, and it will probably be exceeded, as was the budget of the\r\npreceding year by £1-2/3 million.\r\n\r\nLord Hardinge, the last Viceroy of India, who is ever held in loving\r\nmemory here for his sympathetic attitude towards Indian aspirations,\r\nmade a masterly exposition of India’s War services in the House of Lords\r\non the third of last July. He emphasised her pre-War services, showing\r\nthat though 19-1/4 millions sterling was fixed as a maximum by the\r\nNicholson Committee, that amount had been exceeded in 11 out of the last\r\n13 budgets, while his own last budget had risen to 22 millions. During\r\nthese 13 years the revenue had been only between 48 and 58 millions,\r\nonce rising to 60 millions. Could any fact speak more eloquently of\r\nIndia’s War services than this proportion of military expenditure\r\ncompared with her revenue?\r\n\r\nThe Great War began on August 4th, and in that very month and in the\r\nearly part of September, India sent an expeditionary force of three\r\ndivisions--two infantry and one cavalry--and another cavalry division\r\njoined them in France in November. The first arrived, said Lord\r\nHardinge, “in time to fill a gap that could not otherwise have been\r\nfilled.” He added pathetically: “There are very few survivors of those\r\ntwo splendid divisions of infantry.” Truly, their homes are empty, but\r\ntheir sons shall enjoy in India the liberty for which their fathers died\r\nin France. Three more divisions were at once sent to guard the Indian\r\nfrontier, while in September a mixed division was sent to East Africa,\r\nand in October and November two more divisions and a brigade of cavalry\r\nwent to Egypt. A battalion of Indian infantry went to Mauritius, another\r\nto the Cameroons, and two to the Persian Gulf, while other Indian troops\r\nhelped the Japanese in the capture of Tsingtau. 210,000 Indians were\r\nthus sent overseas. The whole of these troops were fully armed and\r\nequipped, and in addition, during the first few weeks of the War, India\r\nsent to England from her magazines “70 million rounds of small-arm\r\nammunition, 60,000 rifles, and more than 550 guns of the latest pattern\r\nand type.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, Lord Hardinge speaks of sending to England\r\n\r\n     enormous quantities of material,... tents, boots, saddlery,\r\n     clothing, etc., but every effort was made to meet the\r\n     ever-increasing demands made by the War Office, and it may be\r\n     stated without exaggeration that India was bled absolutely\r\n     white during the first few weeks of the war.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, though Lord Hardinge has not reckoned it, that\r\nall wastage has been more than filled up, and 450,000 men represent this\r\nhead; the increase in units has been 300,000, and including other\r\nmilitary items India had placed in the field up to the end of 1916 over\r\na million of men.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this a British force of 80,000 was sent from India, fully\r\ntrained and equipped at Indian cost, India receiving in exchange, many\r\nmonths later, 34 Territorial battalions and 29 batteries, “unfit for\r\nimmediate employment on the frontier or in Mesopotamia, until they had\r\nbeen entirely re-armed and equipped, and their training completed.”\r\n\r\nBetween the autumn of 1914 and the close of 1915, the defence of our own\r\nfrontiers was a serious matter, and Lord Hardinge says:\r\n\r\n     The attitude of Afghanistan was for a long time doubtful,\r\n     although I always had confidence in the personal loyalty of our\r\n     ally the Amir; but I feared lest he might be overwhelmed by a\r\n     wave of fanaticism, or by a successful Jehad of the tribes....\r\n     It suffices to mention that, although during the previous three\r\n     years there had been no operations of any importance on the\r\n     North-West frontier, there were, between November 29, 1914, and\r\n     September 5, 1915, no less than seven serious attacks on the\r\n     North-West frontier, all of which were effectively dealt with.\r\n\r\nThe military authorities had also to meet a German conspiracy early in\r\n1915, 7,000 men arriving from Canada and the United States, having\r\nplanned to seize points of military vantage in the Panjab, and in\r\nDecember of the same year another German conspiracy in Bengal,\r\nnecessitating military preparations on land, and also naval patrols in\r\nthe Bay of Bengal.\r\n\r\nLord Hardinge has been much attacked by the Tory and Unionist Press in\r\nEngland and India, in England because of the Mesopotamia Report, in\r\nIndia because his love for India brought him hatred from Anglo-India.\r\nIndia has affirmed her confidence in him, and with India’s verdict he\r\nmay well rest satisfied.\r\n\r\nI do not care to dwell on the Mesopotamia Commission and its\r\ncondemnation of the bureaucratic system prevailing here. Lord Hardinge\r\nvindicated himself and India. The bureaucratic system remains\r\nundefended. I recall that bureaucratic inefficiency came out in even\r\nmore startling fashion in connection with the Afghan War of 1878-79 and\r\n1879-80. In February 1880, the war charges were reported as under £4\r\nmillions, and the accounts showed a surplus of £2 millions. On April 8th\r\nthe Government of India reported: “Outgoing for War very alarming, far\r\nexceeding estimate,” and on the 13th April “it was announced that the\r\ncash balances had fallen in three months from thirteen crores to less\r\nthan nine, owing to ‘excessive Military drain’ ... On the following day\r\n(April 22) a despatch was sent out to the Viceroy, showing that there\r\nappeared a deficiency of not less than 5-1/4 crores. This vast error was\r\nevidently due to an underestimate of war liabilities, which had led to\r\nsuch mis-information being laid before Parliament, and to the sudden\r\ndiscovery of inability to ‘meet the usual drawings.’”\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the Government knew only the amount audited, not the\r\namount spent. Payments were entered as “advances,” though they were not\r\nrecoverable, and “the great negligence was evidently that of the heads\r\nof departmental accounts.” If such a mishap should occur under Home\r\nRule, a few years hence--which heaven forbid--I shudder to think of the\r\ncomments of the _Englishman_ and the _Madras Mail_ on the shocking\r\ninefficiency of Indian officials.\r\n\r\nIn September last, our present Viceroy, H.E. Lord Chelmsford, defended\r\nIndia against later attacks by critics who try to minimise her\r\nsacrifices in order to lessen the gratitude felt by Great Britain\r\ntowards her, lest that gratitude should give birth to justice, and\r\njustice should award freedom to India. Lord Chelmsford placed before his\r\nCouncil “in studiously considered outline, a summary of what India has\r\ndone during the past two years.” Omitting his references to what was\r\ndone under Lord Hardinge, as stated above, I may quote from him:\r\n\r\n     On the outbreak of war, of the 4,598 British officers on the\r\n     Indian establishment, 530 who were at home on leave were\r\n     detained by the War Office for service in Europe. 2,600\r\n     Combatant Officers have been withdrawn from India since the\r\n     beginning of the War, excluding those who proceeded on service\r\n     with their batteries or regiments. In order to make good these\r\n     deficiencies and provide for war wastage the Indian Army\r\n     Reserve of Officers was expanded from a total of 40, at which\r\n     it stood on the 4th August, 1914, to one of 2,000.\r\n\r\n     The establishment of Indian units has not only been kept up to\r\n     strength, but has been considerably increased. There has been\r\n     an augmentation of 20 per cent. in the cavalry and of 40 per\r\n     cent. in the infantry, while the number of recruits enlisted\r\n     since the beginning of the War is greater than the entire\r\n     strength of the Indian Army as it existed on August 4, 1914.\r\n\r\nLord Chelmsford rightly pointed out:\r\n\r\n     The Army in India has thus proved a great Imperial asset, and\r\n     in weighing the value of India’s contribution to the War it\r\n     should be remembered that India’s forces were no hasty\r\n     improvisation, but were an army in being, fully equipped and\r\n     supplied, which had previously cost India annually a large sum\r\n     to maintain.\r\n\r\nLord Chelmsford has established what he calls a “Man-Power Board,” the\r\nduty of which is “to collect and co-ordinate all the facts with regard\r\nto the supply of man-power in India.” It has branches in all the\r\nProvinces. A steady flow of reinforcements supplies the wastage at the\r\nvarious fronts, and the labour required for engineering, transport,\r\netc., is now organised in 20 corps in Mesopotamia and 25 corps in\r\nFrance. In addition 60,000 artisans, labourers, and specialists are\r\nserving in Mesopotamia and East Africa, and some 20,000 menials and\r\nfollowers have also gone overseas. Indian medical practitioners have\r\naccepted temporary commissions in the Indian Medical Service to the\r\nnumber of 500. In view of this fact, due to Great Britain’s bitter need\r\nof help, may we not hope that this Service will welcome Indians in time\r\nof peace as well as in time of war, and will no longer bar the way by\r\ndemanding the taking of a degree in the United Kingdom? It is also\r\nworthy of notice that the I.M.S. officers in charge of district duties\r\nhave been largely replaced by Indian medical men; this, again, should\r\ncontinue after the War. Another fact, that the Army Reserve of Officers\r\nhis risen from 40 to 2,000, suggests that the throwing open of King’s\r\nCommissions to qualified Indians should not be represented by a meagre\r\nnine. If English lads of 19 and 20 are worthy of King’s Commissions--and\r\nthe long roll of slain Second Lieutenants proves it--then certainly\r\nIndian lads, since Indians have fought as bravely as Englishmen, should\r\nfind the door thrown open to them equally widely in their own country,\r\nand the Indian Army should be led by Indian officers.\r\n\r\nWith such a record of deeds as the one I have baldly sketched, it is not\r\nnecessary to say much in words as to India’s support of Great Britain\r\nand her Allies. She has proved up to the hilt her desire to remain\r\nwithin the Empire, to maintain her tie with Great Britain. But if\r\nBritain is to call successfully on India’s man-power, as Lord Chelmsford\r\nsuggests in his Man-Power Board, then must the man who fights or labours\r\nhave a man’s Rights in his own land. The lesson which springs out of\r\nthis War is that it is absolutely necessary for the future safety of the\r\nEmpire that India shall have Home Rule. Had her Man-Power been utilised\r\nearlier there would have been no War, for none would have dared to\r\nprovoke Great Britain and India to a contest. But her Man-Power cannot\r\nbe utilised while she is a subject Nation. She cannot afford to maintain\r\na large army, if she is to support an English garrison, to pay for their\r\ngoings and comings, to buy stores in England at exorbitant prices and\r\nsend them back again when England needs them. She cannot afford to train\r\nmen for England, and only have their services for five years. She cannot\r\nafford to keep huge Gold Reserves in England, and be straitened for\r\ncash, while she lends to England out of her Reserves, taken from her\r\nover-taxation, £27,000,000 for War expenses, and this, be it remembered,\r\nbefore the great War Loan. I once said in England: “The condition of\r\nIndia’s loyalty is India’s freedom.” I may now add: “The condition of\r\nIndia’s usefulness to the Empire is India’s freedom.” She will tax\r\nherself willingly when her taxes remain in the country and fertilise it,\r\nwhen they educate her people and thus increase their productive power,\r\nwhen they foster her trade and create for her new industries.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain needs India as much as India needs England, for prosperity\r\nin Peace as well as for safety in War. Mr. Montagu has wisely said that\r\n“for equipment in War a Nation needs freedom in Peace.” Therefore I say\r\nthat, for both countries alike, the lesson of the War is Home Rule for\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nLet me close this part of my subject by laying at the feet of His\r\nImperial Majesty the loving homage of the thousands here assembled, with\r\nthe hope and belief that, ere long, we shall lay there the willing and\r\ngrateful homage of a free Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF THE NEW SPIRIT IN INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from the natural exchange of thought between East and West, the\r\ninfluence of English education, literature and ideals, the effect of\r\ntravel in Europe, Japan and the United States of America, and other\r\nrecognised causes for the changed outlook in India, there have been\r\nspecial forces at work during the last few years to arouse a New Spirit\r\nin India, and to alter her attitude of mind. These may be summed up as:\r\n\r\n     (a) The Awakening of Asia.\r\n\r\n     (b) Discussions abroad on Alien Rule and Imperial Reconstruction.\r\n\r\n     (c) Loss of Belief in the Superiority of the White Races.\r\n\r\n     (d) The Awakening of Indian Merchants.\r\n\r\n     (e) The Awakening of Indian Womanhood to claim its Ancient\r\n         Position.\r\n\r\n     (f) The Awakening of the Masses.\r\n\r\nEach of these causes has had its share in the splendid change of\r\nattitude in the Indian Nation, in the uprising of a spirit of pride of\r\ncountry, of independence, of self-reliance, of dignity, of self-respect.\r\nThe War has quickened the rate of evolution of the world, and no country\r\nhas experienced the quickening more than our Motherland.\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKENING OF ASIA.\r\n\r\nIn a conversation I had with Lord Minto, soon after his arrival as\r\nViceroy, he discussed the so-called “unrest in India,” and recognised it\r\nas the inevitable result of English Education, of English Ideals of\r\nDemocracy, of the Japanese victory over Russia, and of the changing\r\nconditions in the outer world. I was therefore not surprised to read his\r\nremark that he recognised, “frankly and publicly, that new aspirations\r\nwere stirring in the hearts of the people, that they were part of a\r\nlarger movement common to the whole East, and that it was necessary to\r\nsatisfy them to a reasonable extent by giving them a larger share in the\r\nadministration.”\r\n\r\nBut the present movement in India will be very poorly understood if it\r\nbe regarded only in connexion with the movement in the East. The\r\nawakening of Asia is part of a world-movement, which has been quickened\r\ninto marvellous rapidity by the world-war. The world-movement is towards\r\nDemocracy, and for the West dates from the breaking away of the American\r\nColonies from Great Britain, consummated in 1776, and its sequel in the\r\nFrench Revolution of 1789. Needless to say that its root was in the\r\ngrowth of modern science, undermining the fabric of intellectual\r\nservitude, in the work of the Encyclopædists, and in that of\r\nJean-Jacques Rousseau and of Thomas Paine. In the East, the swift\r\nchanges in Japan, the success of the Japanese Empire against Russia, the\r\ndownfall of the Manchu dynasty in China and the establishment of a\r\nChinese Republic, the efforts at improvement in Persia, hindered by the\r\ninterference of Russia and Great Britain with their growing ambitions,\r\nand the creation of British and Russian “spheres of influence,”\r\ndepriving her of her just liberty, and now the Russian Revolution and\r\nthe probable rise of a Russian Republic in Europe and Asia, have all\r\nentirely changed the conditions before existing in India. Across Asia,\r\nbeyond the Himalayas, stretch free and self-ruling Nations. India no\r\nlonger sees as her Asian neighbours the huge domains of a Tsar and a\r\nChinese despot, and compares her condition under British rule with those\r\nof their subject populations. British rule profited by the comparison,\r\nat least until 1905, when the great period of repression set in. But in\r\nfuture, unless India wins Self-Government, she will look enviously at\r\nher Self-Governing neighbours, and the contrast will intensify her\r\nunrest.\r\n\r\nBut even if she gains Home Rule, as I believe she will, her position in\r\nthe Empire will imperatively demand that she shall be strong as well as\r\nfree. She becomes not only a vulnerable point in the Empire, as the\r\nAsian Nations evolve their own ambitions and rivalries, but also a\r\npossession to be battled for. Mr. Laing once said: “India is the\r\nmilch-cow of England,” a Kamadhenu, in fact, a cow of plenty; and if\r\nthat view should arise in Asia, the ownership of the milch-cow would\r\nbecome a matter of dispute, as of old between Vashishtha and\r\nVishvamitra. Hence India must be capable of self-defence both by land\r\nand sea. There may be a struggle for the primacy of Asia, for supremacy\r\nin the Pacific, for the mastery of Australasia, to say nothing of the\r\ninevitable trade-struggles, in which Japan is already endangering Indian\r\nindustry and Indian trade, while India is unable to protect herself.\r\n\r\nIn order to face these larger issues with equanimity, the Empire\r\nrequires a contented, strong, self-dependent and armed India, able to\r\nhold her own and to aid the Dominions, especially Australia, with her\r\nsmall population and immense unoccupied and undefended area. India alone\r\nhas the man-power which can effectively maintain the Empire in Asia, and\r\nit is a short-sighted, a criminally short-sighted, policy not to build\r\nup her strength as a Self-Governing State within the Commonwealth of\r\nFree Nations under the British Crown. The Englishmen in India talk\r\nloudly of their interests; what can this mere handful do to protect\r\ntheir interests against attack in the coming years? Only in a free and\r\npowerful India will they be safe. Those who read Japanese papers know\r\nhow strongly, even during the War, they parade unchecked their\r\npro-German sympathies, and how likely after the War is an alliance\r\nbetween these two ambitious and warlike Nations. Japan will come out of\r\nthe War with her army and navy unweakened, and her trade immensely\r\nstrengthened. Every consideration of sane statesmanship should lead\r\nGreat Britain to trust India more than Japan, so that the British Empire\r\nin Asia may rest on the sure foundation of Indian loyalty, the loyalty\r\nof a free and contented people, rather than be dependent on the\r\ncontinued friendship of a possible future rival. For international\r\nfriendships are governed by National interests, and are built on\r\nquicksands, not on rock.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen in India must give up the idea that English dominance is\r\nnecessary for the protection of their interests, amounting, in 1915, to\r\n£365,399,000 sterling. They do not claim to dominate the United States\r\nof America, because they have invested there £688,078,000. They do not\r\nclaim to dominate the Argentine Republic, because they have invested\r\nthere £269,808,000. Why then should they claim to dominate India on the\r\nground of their investment? Britons must give up the idea that India is\r\na possession to be exploited for their own benefit, and must see her as\r\na friend, an equal, a Self-Governing Dominion within the Empire, a\r\nNation like themselves, a willing partner in the Empire, and not a\r\ndependent. The democratic movement in Japan, China and Russia in Asia\r\nhas sympathetically affected India, and it is idle to pretend that it\r\nwill cease to affect her.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSIONS ABROAD ON ALIEN RULE AND IMPERIAL RECONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nBut there are other causes which have been working in India, consequent\r\non the British attitude against autocracy and in defence of freedom in\r\nEurope, while her attitude to India has, until lately, been left in\r\ndoubt. Therefore I spoke of a splendid opportunity lost. India at first\r\nbelieved whole-heartedly that Great Britain was fighting for the freedom\r\nof all Nationalities. Even now, Mr. Asquith declared--in his speech in\r\nthe House of Commons reported here last October, on the peace resolution\r\nof Mr. Ramsay Macdonald--that “the Allies are fighting for nothing but\r\nfreedom, and, an important addition--for nothing short of freedom.” In\r\nhis speech declaring that Britain would stand by France in her claim for\r\nthe restoration of Alsace-Lorraine, he spoke of “the intolerable\r\ndegradation of a foreign yoke.” Is such a yoke less intolerable, less\r\nwounding to self-respect here, than in Alsace-Lorraine, where the rulers\r\nand the ruled are both of European blood, similar in religion and\r\nhabits? As the War went on, India slowly and unwillingly came to realise\r\nthat the hatred of autocracy was confined to autocracy in the West, and\r\nthat the degradation was only regarded as intolerable for men of white\r\nraces; that freedom was lavishly promised to all except to India; that\r\nnew powers were to be given to the Dominions, but not to India. India\r\nwas markedly left out of the speeches of statesmen dealing with the\r\nfuture of the Empire, and at last there was plain talk of the White\r\nEmpire, the Empire of the Five Nations, and the “coloured races” were\r\nlumped together as the wards of the White Empire, doomed to an\r\nindefinite minority.\r\n\r\nThe peril was pressing; the menace unmistakable. The Reconstruction of\r\nthe Empire was on the anvil; what was to be India’s place therein? The\r\nDominions were proclaimed as partners; was India to remain a Dependency?\r\nMr. Bonar Law bade the Dominions strike while the iron was hot; was\r\nIndia to wait till it was cold? India saw her soldiers fighting for\r\nfreedom in Flanders, in France, in Gallipoli, in Asia Minor, in China,\r\nin Africa; was she to have no share of the freedom for which she fought?\r\nAt last she sprang to her feet and cried, in the words of one of her\r\nnoblest sons: “Freedom is my birthright; and I want it.” The words “Home\r\nRule” became her Mantram. She claimed her place in the Empire.\r\n\r\nThus, while she continued to support, and even to increase, her army\r\nabroad, fighting for the Empire, and poured out her treasures as water\r\nfor Hospital Ships, War Funds, Red Cross organisations, and the gigantic\r\nWar Loan, a dawning fear oppressed her, lest, if she did not take order\r\nwith her own household, success in the War for the Empire might mean\r\ndecreased liberty for herself.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the right of the Indian Government to make its voice\r\nheard in Imperial matters, when they were under discussion in an\r\nImperial Conference, was a step in the right direction. But\r\ndisappointment was felt that while other countries were represented by\r\nresponsible Ministers, the representation in India’s case was of the\r\nGovernment, of a Government irresponsible to her, and not the\r\nrepresentative of herself. No fault was found with the choice itself,\r\nbut only with the non-representative character of the chosen, for they\r\nwere selected by the Government, and not by the elected members of the\r\nSupreme Council. This defect in the resolution moved by the Hon. Khan\r\nBahadur M.M. Shafi on October 2, 1915, was pointed out by the Hon. Mr.\r\nSurendranath Bannerji. He said:\r\n\r\n     My Lord, in view of a situation so full of hope and promise, it\r\n     seems to me that my friend’s Resolution does not go far enough.\r\n     He pleads for _official_ representation at the Imperial\r\n     Conference: he does not plead for _popular_ representation. He\r\n     urges that an address be presented to His Majesty’s Government,\r\n     through the Secretary of State for India, for official\r\n     representation at the Imperial Council. My Lord, official\r\n     representation may mean little or nothing. It may indeed be\r\n     attended with some risk; for I am sorry to have to say--but say\r\n     it I must--that our officials do not always see eye to eye with\r\n     us as regards many great public questions which affect this\r\n     country; and indeed their views, judged from our standpoint,\r\n     may sometimes seem adverse to our interests. At the same time,\r\n     my Lord, I recognise the fact that the Imperial Conference is\r\n     an assemblage of officials pure and simple, consisting of\r\n     Ministers of the United Kingdom and of the self-governing\r\n     Colonies. But, my Lord, there is an essential difference\r\n     between them and ourselves. In their case, the Ministers are\r\n     the elect of the people, their organ and their voice,\r\n     answerable to them for their conduct and their proceedings. In\r\n     our case, our officials are public servants in name, but in\r\n     reality they are the masters of the public. The situation may\r\n     improve, and I trust it will, under the liberalising influence\r\n     of your Excellency’s beneficent administration; but we must\r\n     take things as they are, and not indulge in building castles in\r\n     the air, which may vanish “like the baseless fabric of a\r\n     vision.”\r\n\r\nIt was said to be an epoch-making event that “Indian Representatives”\r\ntook part in the Conference. Representatives they were, but, as said, of\r\nthe British Government in India, not of India, whereas their colleagues\r\nrepresented their Nations. They did good work, none the less, for they\r\nwere able and experienced men, though they failed us in the Imperial\r\nPreference Conference and, partially, on the Indentured Labour question.\r\nYet we hope that the presence in the Conference of men of Indian birth\r\nmay prove to be the proverbial “thin end of the wedge,” and may have\r\nconvinced their colleagues that, while India was still a Dependency,\r\nIndia’s sons were fully their equals.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Public Services Commission, though now too obviously\r\nobsolete to be discussed, caused both disappointment and resentment; for\r\nit showed that, in the eyes of the majority of the Commissioners,\r\nEnglish domination in Indian administration was to be perpetual, and\r\nthat thirty years hence she would only hold a pitiful 25 per cent. of\r\nthe higher appointments in the I.C.S. and the Police. I cannot, however,\r\nmention that Commission, even in passing, without voicing India’s thanks\r\nto the Hon. Mr. Justice Rahim, for his rare courage in writing a\r\nsolitary Minute of Dissent, in which he totally rejected the Report, and\r\nlaid down the right principles which should govern recruitment for the\r\nIndian Civil Services.\r\n\r\nIndia had but three representatives on the Commission; G.K. Gokhale died\r\nere it made its Report, his end quickened by his sufferings during its\r\nwork, by the humiliation of the way in which his countrymen were\r\ntreated. Of Mr. Abdur Rahim I have already spoken. The Hon. Mr. M.B.\r\nChaubal signed the Report, but dissented from some of its most important\r\nrecommendations. The whole Report was written “before the flood,” and it\r\nis now merely an antiquarian curiosity.\r\n\r\nIndia, for all these reasons, was forced to see before her a future of\r\nperpetual subordination: the Briton rules in Great Britain, the\r\nFrenchman in France, the American in America, each Dominion in its own\r\narea, but the Indian was to rule nowhere; alone among the peoples of the\r\nworld, he was not to feel his own country as his own. “Britain for the\r\nBritish” was right and natural; “India for the Indians” was wrong, even\r\nseditious. It must be “India for the Empire,” or not even for the\r\nEmpire, but “for the rest of the Empire,” careless of herself. “British\r\nsupport for British Trade” was patriotic and proper in Britain.\r\n“Swadeshi goods for Indians” showed a petty and anti-Imperial spirit in\r\nIndia. The Indian was to continue to live perpetually, and even\r\nthankfully, as Gopal Krishna Gokhale said he lived now, in “an\r\natmosphere of inferiority,” and to be proud to be a citizen (without\r\nrights) of the Empire, while its other component Nations were to be\r\ncitizens (with rights) in their own countries first, and citizens of the\r\nEmpire secondarily. Just as his trust in Great Britain was strained\r\nnearly to breaking point came the glad news of Mr. Montagu’s appointment\r\nas Secretary of State for India, of the Viceroy’s invitation to him, and\r\nof his coming to hear for himself what India wanted. It was a ray of\r\nsunshine breaking through the gloom, confidence in Great Britain\r\nrevived, and glad preparation was made to welcome the coming of a\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of India has changed to meet the changed attitude of the\r\nGovernments of India and Great Britain. But let none imagine that that\r\nconsequential change of attitude connotes any change in her\r\ndetermination to win Home Rule. She is ready to consider terms of peace,\r\nbut it must be “peace with honour,” and honour in this connection means\r\nFreedom. If this be not granted, an even more vigorous agitation will\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nLOSS OF BELIEF IN THE SUPERIORITY OF WHITE RACES\r\n\r\nThe undermining of this belief dates from the spreading of the Arya\r\nSamaj and the Theosophical Society. Both bodies sought to lead the\r\nIndian people to a sense of the value of their own civilisation, to\r\npride in their past, creating self-respect in the present, and\r\nself-confidence in the future. They destroyed the unhealthy inclination\r\nto imitate the West in all things, and taught discrimination, the using\r\nonly of what was valuable in western thought and culture, instead of a\r\nmere slavish copying of everything. Another great force was that of\r\nSwami Vivekananda, alike in his passionate love and admiration for\r\nIndia, and his exposure of the evils resulting from Materialism in the\r\nWest. Take the following:\r\n\r\n     Children of India, I am here to speak to you to-day about some\r\n     practical things, and my object in reminding you about the\r\n     glories of the past is simply this. Many times have I been told\r\n     that looking into the past only degenerates and leads to\r\n     nothing, and that we should look to the future. That is true.\r\n     But out of the past is built the future. Look back, therefore,\r\n     as far as you can, drink deep of the eternal fountains that are\r\n     behind, and after that, look forward, march forward, and make\r\n     India brighter, greater, much higher than she ever was. Our\r\n     ancestors were great. We must recall that. We must learn the\r\n     elements of our being, the blood that courses in our veins; we\r\n     must have faith in that blood, and what it did in the past: and\r\n     out of that faith, and consciousness of past greatness, we must\r\n     build an India yet greater than what she has been.\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n     I know for certain that millions, I say deliberately, millions,\r\n     in every civilised land are waiting for the message that will\r\n     save them from the hideous abyss of materialism into which\r\n     modern money-worship is driving them headlong, and many of the\r\n     leaders of the new Social Movements have already discovered\r\n     that Vedanta in its highest form can alone spiritualise their\r\n     social aspirations.\r\n\r\nThe process was continued by the admiration of Sanskrit literature\r\nexpressed by European scholars and philosophers. But the effect of these\r\nwas confined to the few and did not reach the many. The first great\r\nshock to the belief in white superiority came from the triumph of Japan\r\nover Russia, the facing of a huge European Power by a comparatively\r\nsmall Eastern Nation, the exposure of the weakness and rottenness of the\r\nRussian leaders, and the contrast with their hardy virile opponents,\r\nready to sacrifice everything for their country.\r\n\r\nThe second great shock has come from the frank brutality of German\r\ntheories of the State, and their practical carrying out in the treatment\r\nof conquered districts and the laying waste of evacuated areas in\r\nretreat. The teachings of Bismarck and their practical application in\r\nFrance, Flanders, Belgium, Poland, and Serbia have destroyed all the\r\nglamour of the superiority of Christendom over Asia. Its vaunted\r\ncivilisation is seen to be but a thin veneer, and its religion a matter\r\nof form rather than of life. Gazing from afar at the ghastly heaps of\r\ndead and the hosts of the mutilated, at science turned into devilry and\r\never inventing new tortures for rending and slaying, Asia may be\r\nforgiven for thinking that, on the whole, she prefers her own religions\r\nand her own civilisations.\r\n\r\nBut even deeper than the outer tumult of war has pierced the doubt as to\r\nthe reality of the Ideals of Liberty and Nationality so loudly\r\nproclaimed by the foremost western Nations, the doubt of the honesty of\r\ntheir champions. Sir James Meston said truly, a short time ago, that he\r\nhad never, in his long experience, known Indians in so distrustful and\r\nsuspicious a mood as that which he met in them to-day. And that is so.\r\nFor long years Indians have been chafing over the many breaches of\r\npromises and pledges to them that remain unredeemed. The maintenance\r\nhere of a system of political repression, of coercive measures increased\r\nin number and more harshly applied since 1905, the carrying of the\r\nsystem to a wider extent since the War for the sanctity of treaties and\r\nfor the protection of Nationalities has been going on, have deepened the\r\nmistrust. A frank and courageous statesmanship applied to the honest\r\ncarrying out of large reforms too long delayed can alone remove it. The\r\ntime for political tinkering is past; the time for wise and definite\r\nchanges is here.\r\n\r\nTo these deep causes must be added the comparison between the\r\nprogressive policy of some of the Indian States in matters which most\r\naffect the happiness of the people, and the slow advance made under\r\nBritish administration. The Indian notes that this advance is made under\r\nthe guidance of rulers and ministers of his own race. When he sees that\r\nthe suggestions made in the People’s Assembly in Mysore are fully\r\nconsidered and, when possible, given effect to, he realises that without\r\nthe forms of power the members exercise more real power than those in\r\nour Legislative Councils. He sees education spreading, new industries\r\nfostered, villagers encouraged to manage their own affairs and take the\r\nburden of their own responsibility, and he wonders why Indian incapacity\r\nis so much more efficient than British capacity.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, after all, for Indians, Indian rule may be the best.\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKENING OF THE MERCHANTS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKENING OF INDIAN WOMANHOOD.\r\n\r\nThe position of women in the ancient Aryan civilisation was a very noble\r\none. The great majority married, becoming, as Manu said, the Light of\r\nthe Home; some took up the ascetic life, remained unmarried, and sought\r\nthe knowledge of Brahma. The story of the Rani Damayanti, to whom her\r\nhusband’s ministers came, when they were troubled by the Raja’s\r\ngambling, that of Gandhari, in the Council of Kings and Warrior Chiefs,\r\nremonstrating with her headstrong son; in later days, of Padmavati of\r\nChitoor, of Mirabai of Marwar, the sweet poetess, of Tarabai of Thoda,\r\nthe warrior, of Chand Bibi, the defender of Ahmednagar, of Ahalya Bai of\r\nIndore, the great Ruler--all these and countless others are well known.\r\n\r\nOnly in the last two or three generations have Indian women slipped away\r\nfrom their place at their husbands’ side, and left them unhelped in\r\ntheir public life. But even now they wield great influence over husband\r\nand son. Culture has never forsaken them, but the English education of\r\ntheir husbands and sons, with the neglect of Sanskrit and the\r\nVernacular, have made a barrier between the culture of the husband and\r\nthat of the wife, and has shut the woman out from her old sympathy with\r\nthe larger life of men. While the interests of the husband have\r\nwidened, those of the wife have narrowed. The materialising of the\r\nhusband tended also, by reaction, to render the wife’s religion less\r\nbroad and wise.\r\n\r\nThe wish to save their sons from the materialising results of English\r\neducation awoke keen sympathy among Indian mothers with the movement to\r\nmake religion an integral part of education. It was, perhaps, the first\r\nmovement in modern days which aroused among them in all parts a keen and\r\nliving interest.\r\n\r\nThe Partition of Bengal was bitterly resented by Bengali women, and was\r\nanother factor in the outward-turning change. When the editor of an\r\nExtremist newspaper was prosecuted for sedition, convicted and\r\nsentenced, five hundred Bengali women went to his mother to show their\r\nsympathy, not by condolences, but by congratulations. Such was the\r\nfeeling of the well-born women of Bengal.\r\n\r\nThen the troubles of Indians outside India roused the ever quick\r\nsympathy of Indian women, and the attack in South Africa on the\r\nsacredness of Indian marriage drew large numbers of them out of their\r\nhomes to protest against the wrong.\r\n\r\nThe Indentured Labour question, involving the dishonour of women, again,\r\nmoved them deeply, and even sent a deputation to the Viceroy composed of\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThese were, perhaps, the chief outer causes; but deep in the heart of\r\nIndia’s daughters arose the Mother’s voice, calling on them to help Her\r\nto arise, and to be once more mistress in Her own household. Indian\r\nwomen, nursed on Her old literature, with its wonderful ideals of\r\nwomanly perfection, could not remain indifferent to the great movement\r\nfor India’s liberty. And during the last few years the hidden fire, long\r\nburning in their hearts, fire of love to Bharatamata, fire of resentment\r\nagainst the lessened influence of the religion which they passionately\r\nlove, instinctive dislike of the foreigner as ruling in their land, have\r\ncaused a marvellous awakening. The strength of the Home Rule movement is\r\nrendered tenfold greater by the adhesion to it of large numbers of\r\nwomen, who bring to its helping the uncalculating heroism, the\r\nendurance, the self-sacrifice, of the feminine nature. Our League’s best\r\nrecruits are among the women of India, and the women of Madras boast\r\nthat they marched in procession when the men were stopped, and that\r\ntheir prayers in the temples set the interned captives free. Home Rule\r\nhas become so intertwined with religion by the prayers offered up in the\r\ngreat Southern Temples, sacred places of pilgrimage, and spreading from\r\nthem to village temples, and also by its being preached up and down the\r\ncountry by Sadhus and Sannyasins, that it has become in the minds of the\r\nwomen and of the ever religious masses, inextricably intertwined with\r\nreligion. That is, in this country, the surest way of winning alike the\r\nwomen of the higher classes and the men and women villagers. And that is\r\nwhy I have said that the two words, “Home Rule,” have become a Mantram.\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKENING OF THE MASSES.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWHY INDIA DEMANDS HOME RULE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndia demands Home Rule for two reasons, one essential and vital, the\r\nother less important but necessary: Firstly, because Freedom is the\r\nbirthright of every Nation; secondly, because her most important\r\ninterests are now made subservient to the interests of the British\r\nEmpire without her consent, and her resources are not utilised for her\r\ngreatest needs. It is enough only to mention the money spent on her\r\nArmy, not for local defence but for Imperial purposes, as compared with\r\nthat spent on primary education.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE VITAL REASON.\r\n\r\nWhat is a Nation?\r\n\r\nSelf-Government is necessary to the self-respect and dignity of a\r\nPeople; Other-Government emasculates a Nation, lowers its character, and\r\nlessens its capacity. The wrong done by the Arms Act, which Raja Rampal\r\nSingh voiced in the Second Congress as a wrong which outweighed all the\r\nbenefits of British Rule, was its weakening and debasing effect on\r\nIndian manhood. “We cannot,” he declared, “be grateful to it for\r\ndegrading our natures, for systematically crushing out all martial\r\nspirit, for converting a race of soldiers and heroes into a timid flock\r\nof quill-driving sheep.” This was done not by the fact that a man did\r\nnot carry arms--few carry them in England--but that men were deprived of\r\nthe _right_ to carry them. A Nation, an individual, cannot develop his\r\ncapacities to the utmost without liberty. And this is recognised\r\neverywhere except in India. As Mazzini truly said:\r\n\r\n     God has written a line of His thought over the cradle of every\r\n     people. That is its special mission. It cannot be cancelled; it\r\n     must be freely developed.\r\n\r\nFor what is a Nation? It is a spark of the Divine Fire, a fragment of\r\nthe Divine Life, outbreathed into the world, and gathering round itself\r\na mass of individuals, men, women and children, whom it binds together\r\ninto one. Its qualities, its powers, in a word, its type, depend on the\r\nfragment of the Divine Life embodied in it, the Life which shapes it,\r\nevolves it, colours it, and makes it One. The magic of Nationality is\r\nthe feeling of oneness, and the use of Nationality is to serve the world\r\nin the particular way for which its type fits it. This is what Mazzini\r\ncalled “its special mission,” the duty given to it by God in its\r\nbirth-hour. Thus India had the duty of spreading the idea of Dharma,\r\nPersia that of Purity, Egypt that of Science, Greece that of Beauty,\r\nRome that of Law. But to render its full service to Humanity it must\r\ndevelop along its own lines, and be Self-determined in its evolution. It\r\nmust be Itself, and not Another. The whole world suffers where a\r\nNationality is distorted or suppressed, before its mission to the world\r\nis accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe Cry for Self-Rule.\r\n\r\nHence the cry of a Nation for Freedom, for Self-Rule, is not a cry of\r\nmere selfishness demanding more Rights that it may enjoy more happiness.\r\nEven in that there is nothing wrong, for happiness means fulness of\r\nlife, and to enjoy such fulness is a righteous claim. But the demand for\r\nSelf-Rule is a demand for the evolution of its own nature for the\r\nService of Humanity. It is a demand of the deepest Spirituality, an\r\nexpression of the longing to give its very best to the world. Hence\r\ndangers cannot check it, nor threats appal, nor offerings of greater\r\npleasures lure it to give up its demand for Freedom. In the adapted\r\nwords of a Christian Scripture, it passionately cries: “What shall it\r\nprofit a Nation if it gain the whole world and lose its own Soul? What\r\nshall a Nation give in exchange for its Soul?” Better hardship and\r\nfreedom, than luxury and thraldom. This is the spirit of the Home Rule\r\nmovement, and therefore it cannot be crushed, it cannot be destroyed, it\r\nis eternal and ever young. Nor can it be persuaded to exchange its\r\nbirthright for any mess of efficiency-pottage at the hands of the\r\nbureaucracy.\r\n\r\nStunting the Race.\r\n\r\nComing closer to the daily life of the people as individuals, we see\r\nthat the character of each man, woman and child is degraded and weakened\r\nby a foreign administration, and this is most keenly felt by the best\r\nIndians. Speaking on the employment of Indians in the Public Services,\r\nGopal Krishna Gokhale said:\r\n\r\n     A kind of dwarfing or stunting of the Indian race is going on\r\n     under the present system. We must live all the days of our life\r\n     in an atmosphere of inferiority, and the tallest of us must\r\n     bend, in order that the exigencies of the system may be\r\n     satisfied. The upward impulse, if I may use such an expression,\r\n     which every schoolboy at Eton or Harrow may feel that he may\r\n     one day be a Gladstone, a Nelson, or a Wellington, and which\r\n     may draw forth the best efforts of which he is capable, that is\r\n     denied to us. The full height to which our manhood is capable\r\n     of rising can never be reached by us under the present system.\r\n     The moral elevation which every Self-governing people feel\r\n     cannot be felt by us. Our administrative and military talents\r\n     must gradually disappear owing to sheer disuse, till at last\r\n     our lot, as hewers of wood and drawers of water in our own\r\n     country, is stereotyped.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Mr. Bhupendranath Basu has spoken on similar lines:\r\n\r\n     A bureaucratic administration, conducted by an imported agency,\r\n     and centring all power in its hands, and undertaking all\r\n     responsibility, has acted as a dead weight on the Soul of\r\n     India, stifling in us all sense of initiative, for the lack of\r\n     which we are condemned, atrophying the nerves of action and,\r\n     what is more serious, necessarily dwarfing in us all feeling of\r\n     self-respect.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion the warning of Lord Salisbury to Cooper’s Hill\r\nstudents is significant:\r\n\r\n     No system of Government can be permanently safe where there is\r\n     a feeling of inferiority or of mortification affecting the\r\n     relations between the governing and the governed. There is\r\n     nothing I would more earnestly wish to impress upon all who\r\n     leave this country for the purpose of governing India than\r\n     that, if they choose to be so, they are the only enemies\r\n     England has to fear. They are the persons who can, if they\r\n     will, deal a blow of the deadliest character at the future rule\r\n     of England.\r\n\r\nI have ventured to urge this danger, which has increased of late years,\r\nin consequence of the growing self-respect of the Indians, but the\r\nostrich policy is thought to be preferable in my part of the country.\r\n\r\nThis stunting of the race begins with the education of the child. The\r\nSchools differentiate between British and Indian teachers; the Colleges\r\ndo the same. The students see first-class Indians superseded by young\r\nand third-rate foreigners; the Principal of a College should be a\r\nforeigner; foreign history is more important than Indian; to have\r\nwritten on English villages is a qualification for teaching economics in\r\nIndia; the whole atmosphere of the School and College emphasises the\r\nsuperiority of the foreigner, even when the professors abstain from open\r\nassertion thereof. The Education Department controls the education\r\ngiven, and it is planned on foreign models, and its object is to serve\r\nforeign rather than native ends, to make docile Government servants\r\nrather than patriotic citizens; high spirits, courage, self-respect, are\r\nnot encouraged, and docility is regarded as the most precious quality in\r\nthe student; pride in country, patriotism, ambition, are looked on as\r\ndangerous, and English, instead of Indian, Ideals are exalted; the\r\nblessings of a foreign rule and the incapacity of Indians to manage\r\ntheir own affairs are constantly inculcated. What wonder that boys thus\r\ntrained often turn out, as men, time-servers and sycophants, and,\r\nfinding their legitimate ambitions frustrated, become selfish and care\r\nlittle for the public weal? Their own inferiority has been so driven\r\ninto them during their most impressionable years, that they do not even\r\nfeel what Mr. Asquith called the “intolerable degradation of a foreign\r\nyoke.”\r\n\r\nIndia’s Rights.\r\n\r\nIt is not a question whether the rule is good or bad. German efficiency\r\nin Germany is far greater than English efficiency in England; the\r\nGermans were better fed, had more amusements and leisure, less crushing\r\npoverty than the English. But would any Englishman therefore desire to\r\nsee Germans occupying all the highest positions in England? Why not?\r\nBecause the righteous self-respect and dignity of the free man revolt\r\nagainst foreign domination, however superior. As Mr. Asquith said at the\r\nbeginning of the War, such a condition was “inconceivable and would be\r\nintolerable.” Why then is it the one conceivable system here in India?\r\nWhy is it not felt by all Indians to be intolerable? It is because it\r\nhas become a habit, bred in us from childhood, to regard the sahib-log\r\nas our natural superiors, and the greatest injury British rule has done\r\nto Indians is to deprive them of the natural instinct born in all free\r\npeoples, the feeling of an inherent right to Self-determination, to be\r\nthemselves. Indian dress, Indian food, Indian ways, Indian customs, are\r\nall looked on as second-rate; Indian mother-tongue and Indian literature\r\ncannot make an educated man. Indians as well as Englishmen take it for\r\ngranted that the natural rights of every Nation do not belong to them;\r\nthey claim “a larger share in the government of the country,” instead of\r\nclaiming the government of their own country, and they are expected to\r\nfeel grateful for “boons,” for concessions. Britain is to say what she\r\nwill give. The whole thing is wrong, topsy-turvy, irrational. Thank God\r\nthat India’s eyes are opening; that myriads of her people realise that\r\nthey are men, with a man’s right to freedom in his own country, a man’s\r\nright to manage his own affairs. India is no longer on her knees for\r\nboons; she is on her feet for Rights. It is because I have taught this\r\nthat the English in India misunderstand me and call me seditious; it is\r\nbecause I have taught this that I am President of this Congress to-day.\r\n\r\nThis may seem strong language, because the plain truth is not usually\r\nput in India. But this is what every Briton feels in Britain for his own\r\ncountry, and what every Indian should feel in India for his. This is the\r\nFreedom for which the Allies are fighting; this is Democracy, the Spirit\r\nof the Age. And this is what every true Briton will feel is India’s\r\nRight the moment India claims it for herself, as she is claiming it\r\nnow. When this right is gained, then will the tie between India and\r\nGreat Britain become a golden link of mutual love and service, and the\r\niron chain of a foreign yoke will fall away. We shall live and work side\r\nby side, with no sense of distrust and dislike, working as brothers for\r\ncommon ends. And from that union shall arise the mightiest Empire, or\r\nrather Commonwealth, that the world has ever known, a Commonwealth that,\r\nin God’s good time, shall put an end to War.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SECONDARY REASONS.\r\n\r\nTests of Efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe Secondary Reasons for the present demand for Home Rule may be summed\r\nup in the blunt statement: “The present rule, while efficient in less\r\nimportant matters and in those which concern British interests, is\r\ninefficient in the greater matters on which the healthy life and\r\nhappiness of the people depend.” Looking at outer things, such as\r\nexternal order, posts and telegraphs--except where political agitators\r\nare concerned--main roads, railways, etc., foreign visitors, who\r\nexpected to find a semi-savage country, hold up their hands in\r\nadmiration. But if they saw the life of the people, the masses of\r\nstruggling clerks trying to educate their children on Rs. 25 (28s.\r\n0-1/4d.) a month, the masses of labourers with one meal a day, and the\r\nhuts in which they live, they would find cause for thought. And if the\r\neducated men talked freely with them, they would be surprised at their\r\nbitterness. Gopal Krishna Gokhale put the whole matter very plainly in\r\n1911:\r\n\r\n     One of the fundamental conditions of the peculiar position of\r\n     the British Government in this country is that it should be a\r\n     continuously progressive Government. I think all thinking men,\r\n     to whatever community they belong, will accept that. Now, I\r\n     suggest four tests to judge whether the Government is\r\n     progressive, and, further, whether it is continuously\r\n     progressive. The first test that I would apply is what measures\r\n     it adopts for the moral and material improvement of the mass of\r\n     the people, and under these measures I do not include those\r\n     appliances of modern Governments which the British Government\r\n     has applied in this country, because they were appliances\r\n     necessary for its very existence, though they have benefited\r\n     the people, such as the construction of Railways, the\r\n     introduction of Post and Telegraphs, and things of that kind.\r\n     By measures for the moral and material improvement of the\r\n     people, I mean what the Government does for education, what the\r\n     Government does for sanitation, what the Government does for\r\n     agricultural development, and so forth. That is my first test.\r\n     The second test that I would apply is what steps the Government\r\n     takes to give us a larger share in the administration of our\r\n     local affairs--in municipalities and local boards. My third\r\n     test is what voice the Government gives us in its Councils--in\r\n     those deliberate assemblies, where policies are considered.\r\n     And, lastly, we must consider how far Indians are admitted into\r\n     the ranks of the public service.\r\n\r\nA Change of System Needed.\r\n\r\nThose were Gokhale’s tests, and Indians can supply the results of their\r\nknowledge and experience to answer them. But before dealing with the\r\nfailure to meet these tests, it is necessary to state here that it is\r\nnot a question of blaming men, or of substituting Indians for\r\nEnglishmen, but of changing the system itself. It is a commonplace that\r\nthe best men become corrupted by the possession of irresponsible power.\r\nAs Bernard Houghton says: “The possession of unchecked power corrupts\r\nsome of the finer qualities.” Officials quite honestly come to believe\r\nthat those who try to change the system are undermining the security of\r\nthe State. They identify the State with themselves, so that criticism of\r\nthem is seen as treason to the State. The phenomenon is well known in\r\nhistory, and it is only repeating itself in India. The same writer--I\r\nprefer to use his words rather than my own, for he expresses exactly my\r\nown views, and will not be considered to be prejudiced as I am thought\r\nto be--cogently remarks:\r\n\r\n     He (the official) has become an expert in reports and returns\r\n     and matters of routine through many years of practice. They are\r\n     the very woof and warp of his brain. He has no ideas, only\r\n     reflexes. He views with acrid disfavour untried conceptions.\r\n     From being constantly preoccupied with the manipulation of the\r\n     machine he regards its smooth working, the ordered and\r\n     harmonious regulation of glittering pieces of machinery, as the\r\n     highest service he can render to the country of his adoption.\r\n     He determines that his particular cog-wheel at least shall be\r\n     bright, smooth, silent, and with absolutely no back-lash. Not\r\n     unnaturally in course of time he comes to envisage the world\r\n     through the strait embrasure of an office window. When perforce\r\n     he must report on new proposals he will place in the forefront,\r\n     not their influence on the life and progress of the people, but\r\n     their convenience to the official hierarchy and the manner in\r\n     which they affect its authority. Like the monks of old, or the\r\n     squire in the typical English village, he cherishes a\r\n     benevolent interest in the commonalty, and is quite willing,\r\n     even eager, to take a general interest in their welfare, if\r\n     only they do not display initiative or assert themselves in\r\n     opposition to himself or his order. There is much in this\r\n     proviso. Having come to regard his own judgment as almost\r\n     divine, and the hierarchy of which he has the honour to form a\r\n     part as a sacrosanct institution, he tolerates the laity so\r\n     long as they labour quietly and peaceably at their vocations\r\n     and do not presume to inter-meddle in high matters of State.\r\n     That is the heinous offence. And frank criticism of official\r\n     acts touches a lower depth still, even _lèse majesté_. For no\r\n     official will endure criticism from his subordinates, and the\r\n     public, who lie in outer darkness beyond the pale, do not in\r\n     his estimation rank even with his subordinates. How, then,\r\n     should he listen with patience when in their cavilling way they\r\n     insinuate that, in spite of the labours of a high-souled\r\n     bureaucracy, all is perhaps not for the best in the best of all\r\n     possible worlds--still less when they suggest reforms that had\r\n     never occurred even to him or to his order, and may clash with\r\n     his most cherished ideals? It is for the officials to govern\r\n     the country; they alone have been initiated into the sacred\r\n     mysteries; they alone understand the secret working of the\r\n     machine. At the utmost the laity may tender respectful and\r\n     humble suggestions for their consideration, but no more. As for\r\n     those who dare to think and act for themselves, their ignorant\r\n     folly is only equalled by their arrogance. It is as though a\r\n     handful of schoolboys were to dictate to their masters\r\n     alterations in the traditional time-table, or to insist on a\r\n     modified curriculum.... These worthy people [officials] confuse\r\n     manly independence with disloyalty; they cannot conceive of\r\n     natives except either as rebels or as timid sheep.\r\n\r\nNon-Official Anglo-Indians.\r\n\r\nThe problem becomes more complicated by the existence in India of a\r\nsmall but powerful body of the same race as the higher officials; there\r\nare only 122,919 English-born persons in this country, while there are\r\n245,000,000 in the British Raj and another 70,000,000 in the Indian\r\nStates, more or less affected by British influence. As a rule, the\r\nnon-officials do not take any part in politics, being otherwise\r\noccupied; but they enter the field when any hope arises in Indian hearts\r\nof changes really beneficial to the Nation. John Stuart Mill observed on\r\nthis point:\r\n\r\n     The individuals of the ruling people who resort to the foreign\r\n     country to make their fortunes are of all others those who most\r\n     need to be held under powerful restraint. They are always one\r\n     of the chief difficulties of the Government. Armed with the\r\n     prestige and filled with the scornful overbearingness of the\r\n     conquering Nation, they have the feelings inspired by absolute\r\n     power without its sense of responsibility.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Sir John Lawrence wrote:\r\n\r\n     The difficulty in the way of the Government of India acting\r\n     fairly in these matters is immense. If anything is done, or\r\n     attempted to be done, to help the natives, a general howl is\r\n     raised, which reverberates in England, and finds sympathy and\r\n     support there. I feel quite bewildered sometimes what to do.\r\n     Everyone is, in the abstract, for justice, moderation, and\r\n     suchlike excellent qualities; but when one comes to apply such\r\n     principles so as to affect anybody’s interests, then a change\r\n     comes over them.\r\n\r\nKeene, speaking of the principle of treating equally all classes of the\r\ncommunity, says:\r\n\r\n     The application of that maxim, however, could not be made\r\n     without sometimes provoking opposition among the handful of\r\n     white settlers in India who, even when not connected with the\r\n     administration, claimed a kind of class ascendancy which was\r\n     not only in the conditions of the country but also in the\r\n     nature of the case. It was perhaps natural that in a land of\r\n     caste the compatriots of the rulers should become--as Lord\r\n     Lytton said--a kind of “white Brahmanas”; and it was certain\r\n     that, as a matter of fact, the pride of race and the possession\r\n     of western civilisation created a sense of superiority, the\r\n     display of which was ungraceful and even dangerous, when not\r\n     tempered by official responsibility. This feeling had been\r\n     sensitive enough in the days of Lord William Bentinck, when the\r\n     class referred to was small in numbers and devoid of influence.\r\n     It was now both more numerous, and--by reason of its connection\r\n     with the newspapers of Calcutta and of London--it was far\r\n     better able to make its passion heard.\r\n\r\nDuring Lord Ripon’s sympathetic administration the great outburst\r\noccurred against the Ilbert Bill in 1883. We are face to face with a\r\nsimilar phenomenon to-day, when we see the European Associations--under\r\nthe leadership of the _Madras Mail_, the _Englishman_ of Calcutta, the\r\n_Pioneer of_ Allahabad, the _Civil and Military Gazette_ of Lahore, with\r\ntheir Tory and Unionist allies in the London Press and with the aid of\r\nretired Indian officials and non-officials in England--desperately\r\nresisting the Reforms now proposed. Their opposition, we know, is a\r\ndanger to the movement towards Freedom, and even when they have failed\r\nto impress England--as they are evidently failing--they will try to\r\nminimise or smother here the reforms which a statute has embodied. The\r\nMinto-Morley reforms were thus robbed of their usefulness, and a similar\r\nattempt, if not guarded against, will be made when the Congress-League\r\nScheme is used as the basis for an Act.\r\n\r\nThe Re-action on England.\r\n\r\nWe cannot leave out of account here the deadly harm done to England\r\nherself by this un-English system of rule in India. Mr. Hobson has\r\npointed out:\r\n\r\n     As our free Self-Governing Colonies have furnished hope,\r\n     encouragement, and leading to the popular aspirations in Great\r\n     Britain, not merely by practical success in the art of\r\n     Self-Government, but by the wafting of a spirit of freedom and\r\n     equality, so our despotically ruled Dependencies have ever\r\n     served to damage the character of our people by feeding the\r\n     habits of snobbish subservience, the admiration of wealth and\r\n     rank, the corrupt survivals of the inequalities of\r\n     feudalism.... Cobden writing in 1860 of our Indian Empire, put\r\n     this pithy question: “Is it not just possible that we may\r\n     become corrupted at home by the reaction of arbitrary political\r\n     maxims in the East upon our domestic politics, just as Greece\r\n     and Rome were demoralised by their contact with Asia?” Not\r\n     merely is the reaction possible, it is inevitable. As the\r\n     despotic portion of our Empire, has grown in area, a large\r\n     number of men, trained in the temper and methods of autocracy,\r\n     as soldiers and civil officials in our Crown Colonies,\r\n     Protectorates and Indian Empire, reinforced by numbers of\r\n     merchants, planters, engineers, and overseers, whose lives have\r\n     been those of a superior caste living an artificial life\r\n     removed from all the healthy restraints of ordinary European\r\n     Society, have returned to this country, bringing back the\r\n     characters, sentiments and ideas imposed by this foreign\r\n     environment.\r\n\r\nIt is a little hard on the I.C.S. that they should be foreigners here,\r\nand then, when they return to their native land, find that they have\r\nbecome foreigners there by the corrupting influences with which they\r\nare surrounded here. We import them as raw material to our own\r\ndisadvantage, and when we export them as manufactured here, Great\r\nBritain and India alike suffer from their reactionary tendencies. The\r\nresults are unsatisfactory to both sides.\r\n\r\nThe First Test Applied.\r\n\r\nLet us now apply Gokhale’s first test. What has the Bureaucracy done for\r\n“education, sanitation, agricultural improvement, and so forth”? I must\r\nput the facts very briefly, but they are indisputable.\r\n\r\n_Education_. The percentage to the whole population of children\r\nreceiving education is 2.8, the percentage having risen by 0.9 since Mr.\r\nGokhale moved his Education Bill six years ago. The percentage of\r\nchildren of school-going age attending school is 18.7. In 1913 the\r\nGovernment of India put the number of pupils at 4-1/2 millions; this has\r\nbeen accomplished in 63 years, reckoning from Sir Charles Wood’s\r\nEducational Despatch in 1854, which led to the formation of the\r\nEducation Department. In 1870 an Education Act was passed in Great\r\nBritain, the condition of Education in England then much resembling our\r\npresent position; grants-in-aid in England had been given since 1833,\r\nchiefly to Church Schools. Between 1870 and 1881 free and compulsory\r\neducation was established, and in 12 years the attendance rose from 43.3\r\nto nearly 100 per cent. There are now 6,000,000 children in the schools\r\nof England and Wales out of a population of 40 millions. Japan, before\r\n1872, had a proportion of 28 per cent. of children of school-going age in\r\nschool, nearly 10 over our present proportion; in 24 years the\r\npercentage was raised to 92, and in 28 years education was free and\r\ncompulsory. In Baroda education is free and largely compulsory and the\r\npercentage of boys is 100 per cent. Travancore has 81.1 per cent. of\r\nboys and 33.2 of girls. Mysore has 45.8 of boys and 9.7 of girls. Baroda\r\nspends an. 6-6 per head on school-going children, British India one\r\nanna. Expenditure on education advanced between 1882 and 1907 by 57\r\nlakhs. Land-revenue had increased by 8 crores, military expenditure by\r\n13 crores, civil by 8 crores, and capital outlay on railways was 15\r\ncrores. (I am quoting G.K. Gokhale’s figures.) He ironically calculated\r\nthat, if the population did not increase, every boy would be in school\r\n115 years hence, and every girl in 665 years. Brother Delegates, we hope\r\nto do it more quickly under Home Rule. I submit that in Education the\r\nBureaucracy is inefficient.\r\n\r\n_Sanitation and Medical Relief_. The prevalence of plague, cholera, and\r\nabove all malaria, shows the lack of sanitation alike in town and\r\ncountry. This lack is one of the causes contributing to the low average\r\nlife-period in India--23.5 years. In England the life-period is 40\r\nyears, in New Zealand 60. The chief difficulty in the way of the\r\ntreatment of disease is the encouragement of the foreign system of\r\nmedicine, especially in rural parts, and the withholding of grants from\r\nthe indigenous. Government Hospitals, Government Dispensaries,\r\nGovernment doctors, must all be on the foreign system. Ayurvaidic and\r\nUnani medicines, Hospitals, Dispensaries, Physicians, are unrecognised,\r\nand to “cover” the latter is “infamous” conduct. Travancore gives\r\ngrants-in-aid to 72 Vaidyashalas, at which 143,505 patients--22,000 more\r\nthan in allopathic institutions--were treated in 1914-15 (the Report\r\nissued in 1917). Our Government cannot grapple with the medical needs of\r\nthe people, yet will not allow the people’s money to be spent on the\r\nsystems they prefer. Under Home Rule the indigenous and the foreign\r\nsystems will be treated with impartiality. I grant that the allopathic\r\ndoctors do their utmost to supply the need, and show great\r\nself-sacrifice, but the need is too vast and the numbers too few.\r\nEfficiency on their own lines in this matter is therefore impossible for\r\nour bureaucratic Government; their fault lies in excluding the\r\nindigenous systems, which they have not condescended to examine before\r\nrejecting them. The result is that in sanitation and medical relief the\r\nBureaucracy is inefficient.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Development_. The census of 1911 gives the agricultural\r\npopulation at 218.3 millions. Its frightful poverty is a matter of\r\ncommon knowledge; its ever-increasing load of indebtedness has been\r\ndwelt on for at least the last thirty odd years by Sir Dinshaw E. Wacha.\r\nYet the increasing debt is accompanied with increasing taxation, land\r\nrevenue having risen, as just stated, in 25 years, by 8\r\ncrores--80,000,000--of rupees. In addition to this there are local\r\ncesses, salt tax, etc. The salt tax, which presses most hardly on the\r\nvery poor, was raised in the last budget by Rs. 9 millions. The\r\ninevitable result of this poverty is malnutrition, resulting in low\r\nvitality, lack of resistance to disease, short life-period, huge\r\ninfantile mortality. Gopal Krishna Gokhale, no mischievous agitator,\r\nrepeated in 1905 the figures; often quoted:\r\n\r\n     Forty millions of people, according to one great Anglo-Indian\r\n     authority--Sir William Hunter--pass through life with only one\r\n     meal a day. According to another authority--Sir Charles\r\n     Elliot--70 millions of people in India do not know what it is\r\n     to have their hunger fully satisfied even once in the whole\r\n     course of the year. The poverty of the people of India, thus\r\n     considered by itself, is truly appalling. And if this is the\r\n     state of things after a hundred years of your rule, you cannot\r\n     claim that your principal aim in India has been the promotion\r\n     of the interests of the Indian people.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes said: “Why harp on these figures? We know them.” Our\r\nanswer is that the fact is ever harping in the stomach of the people,\r\nand while it continues we cannot cease to draw attention to it. And\r\nGokhale urged that “even this deplorable condition has been further\r\ndeteriorating steadily.” We have no figures on malnutrition among the\r\npeasantry, but in Madras City, among an equally poor urban population,\r\nwe found that 78 per cent. of our pupils were reported, after a medical\r\ninspection, to be suffering from malnutrition. And the spareness of\r\nframe, the thinness of arms and legs, the pitiably weak grip on life,\r\nspeak without words to the seeing eye. It needs an extraordinary lack of\r\nimagination not to suffer while these things are going on.\r\n\r\nThe peasants’ grievances are many and have been voiced year after year\r\nby this Congress. The Forest Laws, made by legislators inappreciative of\r\nvillage difficulties, press hardly on them, and only in a small number\r\nof places have Forest Panchayats been established. In the few cases in\r\nwhich the experiment has been made the results have been good, in some\r\ncases marvellously good. The paucity of grazing grounds for their\r\ncattle, the lack of green manure to feed their impoverished lands, the\r\nabsence of fencing round forests, so that the cattle stray in when\r\nfeeding, are impounded, and have to be redeemed, the fines and other\r\npunishments imposed for offences ill-understood, the want of wood for\r\nfuel, for tools, for repairs, the uncertain distribution of the\r\navailable water, all these troubles are discussed in villages and in\r\nlocal Conferences. The Arms Act oppresses them, by leaving them\r\ndefenceless against wild beasts and wild men. The union of Judicial and\r\nExecutive functions makes justice often inaccessible, and always costly\r\nboth in money and in time. The village officials naturally care more to\r\nplease the Tahsildar and the Collector than the villagers, to whom they\r\nare in no way responsible. And factions flourish, because there is\r\nalways a third party to whom to resort, who may be flattered if his rank\r\nbe high, bribed if it be low, whose favour can be gained in either case\r\nby cringing and by subservience and tale-bearing. As regards the\r\ncondition of agriculture in India and the poverty of the agricultural\r\npopulation, the Bureaucracy is inefficient.\r\n\r\nThe application of Mr. Gokhale’s first test to Indian handicrafts, to\r\nthe strengthening of weak industries and the creation of new, to the\r\ncare of waterways for traffic and of the coast transport shipping, the\r\nprotection of indigo and other indigenous dyes against their German\r\nsynthetic rivals, etc., would show similar answers. We are suffering now\r\nfrom the supineness of the Bureaucracy as regards the development of the\r\nresources of the country, by its careless indifference to the usurping\r\nby Germans of some of those resources, and even now they are pursuing a\r\nsimilar policy of _laissez faire_ towards Japanese enterprise, which,\r\nleaning on its own Government, is taking the place of Germany in\r\nshouldering Indians out of their own natural heritage.\r\n\r\nIn all prosperous countries crafts are found side by-side with\r\nagriculture, and they lend each other mutual support. The extreme\r\npoverty of Ireland, and the loss of more than half its population by\r\nemigration, were the direct results of the destruction of its\r\nwool-industry by Great Britain, and the consequent throwing of the\r\npopulation entirely on the land for subsistence. A similar phenomenon\r\nhas resulted here from a similar case, but on a far more widespread\r\nscale. And here, a novel and portentous change for India, “a\r\nconsiderable landless class is developing, which involves economic\r\ndanger,” as the _Imperial Gazeteer_ remarks, comparing the census\r\nreturns of 1891 and 1901. “The ordinary agricultural labourers are\r\nemployed on the land only during the busy seasons of the year, and in\r\nslack times a few are attracted to large trade-centres for temporary\r\nwork.” One recalls the influx into England of Irish labourers at harvest\r\ntime. Professor Radkamal Mukerji has laid stress on the older conditions\r\nof village life. He says:\r\n\r\n     The village is still almost self-sufficing, and is in itself an\r\n     economic unit. The village agriculturist grows all the food\r\n     necessary for the inhabitants of the village. The smith makes\r\n     the plough-shares for the cultivator, and the few iron utensils\r\n     required for the household. He supplies these to the people,\r\n     but does not get money in return. He is recompensed by mutual\r\n     services from his fellow villagers. The potter supplies him\r\n     with pots, the weaver with cloth, and the oilman with oil. From\r\n     the cultivator each of these artisans receives his traditional\r\n     share of grain. Thus almost all the economic transactions are\r\n     carried on without the use of money. To the villagers money is\r\n     only a store of value, not a medium of exchange. When they\r\n     happen to be rich in money, they hoard it either in coins or\r\n     make ornaments made of gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThese conditions are changing in consequence of the pressure of poverty\r\ndriving the villagers to the city, where they learn to substitute the\r\ncompetition of the town for the mutual helpfulness of the village. The\r\ndifference of feeling, the change from trustfulness to suspicion, may be\r\nseen by visiting villages which are in the vicinity of a town and\r\ncomparing their villagers with those who inhabit villages in purely\r\nrural areas. This economic and moral deterioration can only be checked\r\nby the re-establishment of a healthy _and interesting_ village life, and\r\nthis depends upon the re-establishment of the Panchayat as the unit of\r\nGovernment, a question which I deal with presently. Village industries\r\nwould then revive and an intercommunicating network would be formed by\r\nCo-operative Societies. Mr. C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar says in his pamphlet,\r\n_Co-operative Societies and Panchayats_:\r\n\r\n     The one method by which this evil [emigration to towns] can be\r\n     arrested and the economic and social standards of life of the\r\n     rural people elevated is by the inauguration of healthy\r\n     Panchayats in conjunction with the foundation of Co-operative\r\n     institutions, which will have the effect of resuscitating\r\n     village industries, and of creating organised social forces.\r\n     The Indian village, when rightly reconstructed, would be an\r\n     excellent foundation for well-developed co-operative industrial\r\n     organisation.\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n     The resuscitation of the village system has other bearings, not\r\n     usually considered in connection with the general subject of\r\n     the inauguration of the Panchayat system. One of the most\r\n     important of these is the regeneration of the small industries\r\n     of the land. Both in Europe and in India the decline of small\r\n     industries has gone on _pari passu_ with the decline of farming\r\n     on a small scale. In countries like France agriculture has\r\n     largely supported village industries, and small cultivators in\r\n     that country have turned their attention to industry as a\r\n     supplementary source of livelihood. The decline of village life\r\n     in India is not only a political, but also an economic and\r\n     industrial, problem. Whereas in Europe the cultural impulse has\r\n     travelled from the city to the village, in India the reverse\r\n     has been the case. The centre of social life in this country is\r\n     the village, and not the town. Ours was essentially the cottage\r\n     industry, and our artisans still work in their own huts, more\r\n     or less out of touch with the commercial world. Throughout the\r\n     world the tendency has been of late to lay considerable\r\n     emphasis on distributive and industrial co-operation based on a\r\n     system of village industries and enterprise. Herein would be\r\n     found the origins of the arts and crafts guilds and the Garden\r\n     Cities, the idea underlying all these being to inaugurate a\r\n     reign of Socialism and Co-operation, eradicating the entirely\r\n     unequal distribution of wealth amongst producers and consumers.\r\n     India has always been a country of small tenantry, and has\r\n     thereby escaped many of the evils the western Nations have\r\n     experienced owing to the concentration of wealth in a few\r\n     hands. The communistic sense in our midst, and the fundamental\r\n     tenets of our family life, have checked such concentration of\r\n     capital. This has been the cause for the non-development of\r\n     factory industries on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe need for these changes--to which England is returning, after full\r\nexperience of the miseries of life in manufacturing towns--is pressing.\r\n\r\nAddressing an English audience, G.K. Gokhale summed up the general state\r\nof India as follows:\r\n\r\n     Your average annual income has been estimated at about £42 per\r\n     head. Ours, according to official estimates, is about £2 per\r\n     head, and according to non-official estimates, only a little\r\n     more than £1 per head. Your imports per head are about £13:\r\n     ours about 5s. per head. The total deposits in your Postal\r\n     Savings Bank amount to 148 million sterling, and you have in\r\n     addition in the Trustees’ Savings Banks about 52 million\r\n     sterling. Our Postal Savings Bank deposits, with a population\r\n     seven times as large as yours, are only about 7 million\r\n     sterling, and even of this a little over one-tenth is held by\r\n     Europeans. Your total paid-up capital of joint-stock companies\r\n     is about 1,900 million sterling. Ours is not quite 26 million\r\n     sterling, and the greater part of this again is European.\r\n     Four-fifths of our people are dependent upon agriculture, and\r\n     agriculture has been for some time steadily deteriorating.\r\n     Indian agriculturists are too poor, and are, moreover, too\r\n     heavily indebted, to be able to apply any capital to land, and\r\n     the result is that over the greater part of India agriculture\r\n     is, as Sir James Caird pointed out more than twenty-five years\r\n     ago, only a process of exhaustion of the soil. The yield per\r\n     acre is steadily diminishing, being now only about 8 to 9\r\n     bushels an acre against about 30 bushels here in England.\r\n\r\nIn all the matters which come under Gokhale’s first test, the\r\nBureaucracy has been and is inefficient.\r\n\r\nGive Indians a Chance.\r\n\r\nAll we say in the matter is: You have not succeeded in bringing\r\neducation, health, prosperity, to the masses of the people. Is it not\r\ntime to give Indians a chance of doing, for their own country, work\r\nsimilar to that which Japan and other nations have done for theirs?\r\nSurely the claim is not unreasonable. If the Anglo-Indians say that the\r\nmasses are their peculiar care, and that the educated classes care not\r\nfor them, but only for place and power, then we point to the Congress,\r\nto the speeches and the resolutions eloquent of their love and their\r\nknowledge. It is not their fault that they gaze on their country’s\r\npoverty in helpless despair. Or let Mr. Justice Rahim answer:\r\n\r\n     As for the representation of the interests of the many scores\r\n     of millions in India, if the claim be that they are better\r\n     represented by European Officials than by educated Indian\r\n     Officials or non-Officials, it is difficult to conceive how\r\n     such reckless claim has come to be urged. The inability of\r\n     English Officials to master the spoken language of India and\r\n     their habits of life and modes of thought so completely divide\r\n     them from the general population, that only an extremely\r\n     limited few, possessed with extraordinary powers of insight,\r\n     have ever been able to surmount the barriers. With the educated\r\n     Indians, on the other hand, this knowledge is instinctive, and\r\n     the view of religion and custom so strong in the East make\r\n     their knowledge and sympathy more real than is to be seen in\r\n     countries dominated by materialistic conceptions.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be remembered that it is not lack of ability which has\r\nbrought about bureaucratic inefficiency, for British traders and\r\nproducers have done uncommonly well for themselves in India. But a\r\nBureaucracy does not trouble itself about matters of this kind; the\r\nRussian Bureaucracy did not concern itself with the happiness of the\r\nRussian masses, but with their obedience and their paying of taxes.\r\nBureaucracies are the same everywhere, and therefore it is the system we\r\nwage war upon, not the men; we do not want to substitute Indian\r\nbureaucrats for British bureaucrats; we want to abolish Bureaucracy,\r\nGovernment by Civil Servants.\r\n\r\nThe Other Tests Applied.\r\n\r\nI need not delay over the second, third, and fourth tests, for the\r\nanswers _sautent aux yeux_.\r\n\r\n_The second test, Local Self-Government:_ Under Lord Mayo (1869-72) some\r\nattempts were made at decentralisation, called by Keene “Home Rule” (!),\r\nand his policy was followed on non-financial lines as well by Lord\r\nRipon, who tried to infuse into what Keene calls “the germs of Home\r\nRule” “the breath of life.” Now, in 1917, an experimental and limited\r\nmeasure of local Home Rule is to be tried in Bengal. Though the Report\r\nof the Decentralisation Committee was published in 1909, we have not yet\r\narrived at the universal election of non-official Chairmen. Decidedly\r\ninefficient is the Bureaucracy under test 2.\r\n\r\n_The third test, Voice in the Councils:_ The part played by Indian\r\nelected members in the Legislative Council, Madras, was lately described\r\nby a member as “a farce.” The Supreme Legislative Council was called by\r\none of its members “a glorified Debating Society.” A table of\r\nresolutions proposed by Indian elected members, and passed or lost, was\r\nlately drawn up, and justified the caustic epithets. With regard to the\r\nMinto-Morley reforms, the Bureaucracy showed great efficiency in\r\ndestroying the benefits intended by the Parliamentary Statute. But the\r\nthird test shows that in giving Indians a fair voice in the Councils the\r\nBureaucracy was inefficient.\r\n\r\n_The fourth test, the Admission of Indians to the Public Services:_ This\r\nis shown, by the Report of the Commission, not to need any destructive\r\nactivity on the part of the Bureaucracy to prove their unwillingness to\r\npass it, for the Report protects them in their privileged position.\r\n\r\nWe may add to Gokhale’s tests one more, which will be triumphantly\r\npassed, the success of the Bureaucracy in increasing the cost of\r\nadministration. The estimates for the revenue of the coming year stand\r\nat £86,199,600 sterling. The expenditure is reckoned at £85,572,100\r\nsterling. The cost of administration stands at more than half the total\r\nrevenue:\r\n\r\n    Civil Departments Salaries and Expenses     £19,323,300\r\n    Civil Miscellaneous Charges                   5,283,300\r\n    Military Services                            23,165,900\r\n                                                ___________\r\n                                                £47,772,500\r\n                                                ___________\r\n\r\nThe reduction of the abnormal cost of government in India is of the most\r\npressing nature, but this will never be done until we win Home Rule.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the Secondary Reasons for the demand for Home Rule\r\nare of the weightiest nature in themselves, and show the necessity for\r\nits grant if India is to escape from a poverty which threatens to lead\r\nto National bankruptcy, as it has already led to a short life-period and\r\na high death rate, to widespread disease, and to a growing exhaustion of\r\nthe soil. That some radical change must be brought about in the\r\ncondition of our masses, if a Revolution of Hunger is to be averted, is\r\npatent to all students of history, who also know the poverty of the\r\nIndian masses to-day. This economic condition is due to many causes, of\r\nwhich the inevitable lack of understanding by an alien Government is\r\nonly one. A system of government suitable to the West was forced on the\r\nEast, destroying its own democratic and communal institutions and\r\nimposing bureaucratic methods which bewildered and deteriorated a people\r\nto whom they were strange and repellent. The result is not a matter for\r\nrecrimination, but for change. An inappropriate system forced on an\r\nalready highly civilised people was bound to fail. It has been rightly\r\nsaid that the poor only revolt when the misery they are enduring is\r\ngreater than the dangers of revolt.
