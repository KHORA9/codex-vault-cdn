In many nooks and corners of the country today we have\r\nrelics of this provincial and frontier society. In such districts this\r\nplan for state and municipal governments is entirely satisfactory\r\nin practice. To depart from it would be unwise, for the reason that\r\nin matters of government that which is and which is not positively\r\nobjectionable should be let alone. Frequently men of talent and power,\r\nwhose youth was spent in the provincial and frontier era of our social\r\nand political development, still find conditions about them not so\r\nmuch changed. To them the mid-nineteenth-century plan and its practice\r\nare entirely satisfactory. Any criticism of it would at once meet\r\nwith a vigorous and, no doubt, from the point of view of provincial\r\nand frontier conditions, a complete defense. To the inhabitants of\r\nthose parts of the United States where such provincial and frontier\r\nconditions still exist the following essay is not addressed.\r\n\r\nSo long as the more simple and primitive conditions of society which\r\nobtained in the first half of the nineteenth century were all but\r\nuniversal in the United States, any criticism of the plan of state\r\nand municipal government which prevailed was a purely academic\r\nexercise. Even when, in some districts, conditions had changed and\r\ngreat cities had arisen with enormous wealth and population, to which\r\nthe mid-nineteenth-century plan of government did not seem to fit in\r\npractice, the majority were still so far satisfied as to make any\r\ncriticism of that plan of merely speculative value. But in the second\r\ndecade of the twentieth century the provincial and frontier type of\r\nsociety will be found to embrace a distinct minority of the population\r\nof the country. The social conditions presented by a large population\r\nin a small area, with a highly organized and differentiated social\r\nstructure, have become common to a large portion of the population of\r\nthe entire country. Whether the application of a mid-nineteenth-century\r\nplan of government to these conditions is satisfactory is, therefore,\r\nno longer an academic or speculative question. Its due consideration\r\nhas perhaps rather become to the last degree vital to the life of the\r\nnation. To those who are face to face with this problem the following\r\nessay is addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF THE POLITOCRATS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n UNPOPULAR GOVERNMENT--DEFINED--HOW FORMERLY MAINTAINED--PRECAUTIONS\r\n TAKEN TO AVOID IT\r\n\r\n\r\nUnpopular government is, and indeed always has been, a government of\r\nthe few, by the few, and for the few, at the expense and against the\r\nwish of the many.\r\n\r\nIn a former era unpopular government was achieved and maintained\r\nwith simple directness. All governmental power was, by a monarchical\r\nor oligarchical plan, openly placed in the hands of the few. Human\r\ncharacteristics insured the selfish use of that power. The maintenance\r\nof such selfish use of governmental power against the wish of the\r\nmajority was accomplished by denying any legal opportunity to the\r\nmajority to express itself, and by the perpetuation of power in the\r\nhands of the few by inheritance or appointment.\r\n\r\nThe makers of our mid-nineteenth-century state and municipal\r\ngovernments undertook to free this land from unpopular government.\r\nIf all governments must be tyrannical from the point of view of some,\r\nthey preferred the tyranny of the majority to the tyranny of the\r\nminority. Their aim was to establish and maintain a government “of\r\nthe people, by the people, and for the people,” as distinguished from\r\na government of the few, by the few, and for the few, at the expense\r\nof the many and against their wish. They could not, however, change\r\nhuman characteristics. The tendency, therefore, to use power selfishly\r\ncontinued. They did endeavor to prevent the concentration of power in\r\nthe hands of the few by splitting the power of government up among\r\nmany separate and distinct offices and limiting the power which any\r\none officeholder might exercise. They sought to make impossible the\r\nretention of power in the face of popular disapproval by requiring\r\nall offices of importance in the government to be filled by popular\r\nelection and the elections to be held frequently. For the greater part\r\nof a century these ways and means of heading off unpopular government\r\nhave been constantly employed in the development of our state and\r\nmunicipal governments. The belief of the people in popular government\r\nhas become a belief in these two means of obtaining it. In popular\r\nestimation the means have become the end. Inevitably these expedients\r\nfor securing immunity from unpopular government have been pressed to\r\ngreat extremes.\r\n\r\nThe application of the principle that governmental power must be\r\nkept out of the hands of the few is responsible for that fundamental\r\ncharacteristic of American constitutions known as the separation of\r\npowers among the three departments of government. The entire power\r\nof the government is exercised by the executive, the legislative,\r\nand the judicial departments. None is allowed to perform any of the\r\nfunctions which belong to either of the others. If it does so, its\r\naction is unconstitutional and void. Each department is, therefore,\r\nsupreme and independent in its own field. This is the beginning of\r\ndecentralization. In the distribution of powers, each department is\r\ndesigned to be a check upon the others. The legislature, being the\r\nmost powerful by reason of its control over the making of the laws and\r\nappropriations, is naturally a substantial check upon the executive\r\nand judicial departments. Our constitution-makers have, therefore,\r\nbeen particular to devise checks upon the legislature by the other\r\ntwo departments. The executive is given a wide veto power upon all\r\nlegislation, although the veto may be overridden by a two-thirds\r\nvote of the legislature. The courts in their power to declare laws\r\nunconstitutional are given, potentially at least, an effective\r\nveto power upon legislation. The scope of it is narrower than the\r\nexecutive veto, but on the other hand the veto of the courts cannot\r\nbe overridden by any action of the legislature. The actual operation\r\nof these checks and balances, coupled with the complete separation\r\nof powers, has resulted in irritation and bickering between the\r\ndepartments. The trouble between the executive and the legislative\r\ndepartments especially is frequent and acute. The executive is the\r\nmost conspicuous single official. He is elected upon a platform of\r\npledges for legislation. He seeks to redeem those pledges by promoting\r\nthe introduction of bills and pushing them through the legislature.\r\nThe legislature feels hostile toward the executive for attempting to\r\ncoerce its action. The executive loses patience with the legislature\r\nfor not redeeming the pledges of the executive to the electorate.\r\nThe legislature is frequently hostile toward the Supreme Court for\r\ndeclaring laws unconstitutional. The executive also comes in conflict\r\nwith the judiciary by reason of the fact that the latter upsets\r\nlegislation which the executive has sometimes been able to secure only\r\nby trading for votes important appointments which cannot be recalled.\r\nThe executive and legislative departments are likely to feel that\r\nthe Supreme Court has gone beyond its judicial power in declaring\r\nlaws unconstitutional. The result is that each of the departments of\r\ngovernment fails to work in harmony with the others. Each tends to\r\nretire to its own constitutional sphere and there spend considerable\r\ntime in doing what it pleases, regardless of the other departments,\r\nand from time to time blocking and hampering them. In this way the\r\nleast progress is made with the important business of legislation and\r\nthe functioning of the executive and the judicial departments.\r\n\r\nOur constitution-makers, however, went even farther in preventing the\r\nconcentration of the powers of government. They split up and dissipated\r\nthe powers of each department among as many different offices as\r\npossible. They split up the legislative power between two chambers,\r\neach operating as a check upon the other. In Illinois they went a\r\nstep farther and split up the power of the lower house by providing\r\na method whereby every third member might be the representative of\r\na minority party. A general check upon the power of the legislature\r\nis frequently found in the provision that it can meet for general\r\nlegislative business only every two years, or that it can remain\r\nin session for such general legislative purposes only a specified\r\nnumber of days. The result is that the legislative power is not only\r\nhampered from without by executive and judicial vetoes and the\r\nlimited time in which to act, but it is divided within among bodies\r\nwhich are more or less antagonistic to each other. The executive\r\npower of the state, if lodged wholly in the governor, acting through\r\nhis appointees, might still have been a very extensive power, but it\r\nwould have been too much power in one man to meet the approval of our\r\nconstitution-makers. Hence the executive power has been split up among\r\nseveral independently elected executive officers, viz., the governor,\r\nthe attorney-general, the secretary of state, the state treasurer,\r\nthe state auditor, the state superintendent of public instruction,\r\nand the trustees of the state university. Each one of these officers\r\nis independent in the discharge of his statutory or constitutional\r\nduties. So far as they divide executive power among them, they take\r\npower from the chief executive. In the judicial department we find\r\nthe same pains to give out the minimum amount of power to any single\r\njudge or group of judges. We find usually several courts of original\r\njurisdiction, each with power to handle limited and defined classes\r\nof cases. There are justices of the peace, municipal courts, probate\r\ncourts, juvenile courts, criminal courts, and circuit courts, the\r\nlast having the most general jurisdiction. Then follow a succession\r\nof appellate tribunals, each with a limited jurisdiction to hear\r\nappeals. The trial judges have had their power restricted by being\r\nforbidden to exercise any control over juries by oral instructions\r\nupon the law. They have no power to give any instructions upon the\r\nevidence. They have been reduced in jury trials to the position of\r\numpires for forensic duels between lawyers. In the appellate tribunals\r\nthey are usually forbidden to review questions of fact. Their function\r\nis confined very narrowly to the affirming of the decision below, or\r\nreversing it without remanding it, or reversing and remanding it for\r\na new hearing. They are denied any power of hearing further evidence\r\nor making a proper order so as to settle the litigation if possible\r\nin the appellate tribunal. The work of appellate courts consists to\r\nso large an extent of opinion writing and closet work that the office\r\nis inconspicuous and not very attractive. In most states the judges\r\nare elected. Each one is independent in the exercise of the duties of\r\nhis statutory jurisdiction. Even the clerks of the various separate\r\ncourts are in many instances elected. They are absolutely independent\r\nof the judiciary or of any other officer of the legal government in the\r\nexercise of their statutory duties. There is no administrative head of\r\nthe court with large powers over the direction of the work of other\r\njudges and the clerical force and a corresponding responsibility for\r\nthe conduct of judicial business. In the everyday work of his office\r\nthe judge, under the present plan of government, is amenable to no\r\nauthority except his own conscience and a fear of unfavorable public\r\ncomment upon his actions.\r\n\r\nIn our municipal governments the legislative power is usually exercised\r\nby a single chamber, though there are instances of double chambers in\r\nthe city council. In the less important municipal governments, such\r\nas counties, villages, and special commissions, we frequently find a\r\npart of the executive power vested in the municipal legislative body\r\nor in some member of it. Thus, in county governments we frequently\r\nfind the chief executive the presiding and most influential member of\r\nthe board of commissioners. In the cities, however, there is usually\r\na complete separation of the legislative and executive functions,\r\nthe legislative power being committed to a council and the executive\r\nfunctions to a mayor and other subordinate officers. There is a\r\ngeneral tendency toward the splitting-up of the executive power among\r\ndifferent executive officers who are elected and are independent of any\r\nsuperior authority in the performance of their statutory duties. A city\r\ngovernment will usually distribute the executive power among a mayor, a\r\ntreasurer, a comptroller, and a clerk. The executive power of a county\r\ngovernment will be split up among a president of the county board, a\r\ncounty clerk, a sheriff, a county treasurer, a county superintendent of\r\nschools, members of the board of assessors, and the board of review.\r\nA great deal of unobserved splitting-up of executive and legislative\r\nfunctions in municipal governments has been accomplished by the\r\ncreating of several municipal corporations with special functions\r\noperating in the same territory. For instance, where a city and county\r\ngovernment cover the same territory we have two municipal legislatures\r\noperating in the same territory, and also two sets of executive\r\nofficers. Thus is the legislative and executive power necessary for a\r\ngiven district split in half. If a drainage district, a park district,\r\na school district, a public library district, each controlled by\r\ncommissioners or trustees with executive and legislative power, be\r\nadded, all operating in the same territory with a city government and\r\na county government, we have still further split up the municipal\r\nexecutive and legislative power. Such situations are common enough.\r\n\r\nThe principle of decentralization has even been applied so as to\r\nprevent the assistance to the government which might be derived from\r\nexperts in various lines. The place where the largest number and\r\nvariety of experts in the most departments of learning can be found\r\nis the largest city of the state. If that city happens to be one of\r\nthe great cities of the country and of the world, it will also be an\r\nimportant center of intellectual activity of all sorts. It will very\r\nlikely have in or near it one or more great universities. Yet in such\r\nstates we are likely to find that an ancient fear of mob influence over\r\nlegislation has placed the state capital at some distant geographical\r\ncenter which is not even a transportation center. Not infrequently the\r\nstate university will be found at some point more or less inaccessible\r\nto both the largest city of the state and the capital. These are\r\narrangements which tend directly to the separation of the government\r\nfrom the aid of expert knowledge and the best intelligence of the\r\nstate.[1]\r\n\r\nMembers of the state and municipal legislatures are, of course,\r\nelective. Moreover, the judges and state, county, and city\r\nadministrative officers are also elective. In addition to preventing\r\nany officer from holding his place and his power against the will of\r\nthe majority, the wide application of the elective principle aids in\r\nthe decentralization of the executive power. It tends to make every\r\nelective officer independent of every other officer in the discharge of\r\nhis statutory duties. By subjecting to an election at a given time a\r\npart only of the total number of officers elected, a further check upon\r\nthe concentration of power is secured. The officers who do not come up\r\nfor election at a particular time may be of a different political faith\r\nfrom those who are elected. In the same administration, therefore, some\r\nofficeholders may stand as a check upon the actions of the others. In\r\nobedience to the principle of frequent elections all officers hold for\r\nbrief terms of one, two, four, or six years--usually for two or four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThose who devised this plan of government for use in the United States\r\nno doubt thought that the citadel of popular government as thus guarded\r\nwas absolutely impregnable. How could the power of government fall into\r\nthe hands of the few when it had been so carefully split up among so\r\nmany who could not possibly work together in harmony? How could the\r\npower of government be retained in the face of popular disapproval\r\nwhen those who exercised it were subject to such frequent elections?\r\nNevertheless, the impossible has again happened. The impregnable\r\ncitadel has been taken. The manner of its assault and capture is even\r\nnow one of the unexpected and, to many who appreciate only in a general\r\nway what has occurred, one of the incomprehensible events of history.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Compare Godkin, _Essays on Problems of Modern Democracy_, pp. 305-6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n UNPOPULAR GOVERNMENT--HOW ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES IN SPITE OF\r\n THE PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT IT\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 1\r\n\r\nIntroductory\r\n\r\nIn brief outline this is what has occurred: As the population of the\r\ncountry has grown and communities and states have passed more and more\r\nbeyond the frontier stage of development, the decentralization of\r\ngovernmental power has constantly increased and the elective principle\r\nhas been more and more extensively applied. As a consequence the burden\r\nplaced upon the electorate has become more and more onerous. The voter\r\nhas been called upon to vote more often and for an increasing number\r\nof officers. He must theoretically examine into the qualifications of\r\na large number of candidates at frequent intervals. This has placed\r\nupon intelligent voting an enormous educational qualification. The task\r\nof the voter to obtain sufficient information about candidates long\r\nago passed beyond what even the very intelligent citizen could fulfil\r\nand still maintain his place in competitive industry. The result is\r\nthat the voter, though extremely intelligent in general, comes to the\r\npolls in utter ignorance of candidates and their qualifications for\r\noffice. Nevertheless, he insists, in spite of his political ignorance,\r\nupon voting for someone. He takes his voting seriously and endeavors\r\nto make a show of voting intelligently. This attitude necessarily\r\nrequires him to secure advice from someone as to whom to vote for. At\r\nonce there is created the opportunity for the adviser to the voter. He\r\nfirst appears naturally as a local leader whom the electorate trusts.\r\nSoon, however, there arises the man who makes advising the politically\r\nignorant voter his profession. Then this professional adviser becomes\r\nmore of a director to the politically ignorant voter. This process\r\ngoes on in every electoral district where the voter is politically\r\nignorant enough to need some advice. It is not long before there is\r\ndeveloped a hierarchy of professional advisers and directors to the\r\npolitically ignorant voter. Sometimes there are competing hierarchies\r\nof such advisers and directors. One or the other, however, is the more\r\ngenerally successful, or both by agreement divide the privilege of\r\nadvising the politically ignorant voter how to vote--each helping the\r\nother in its exclusive territory. Those who direct the politically\r\nignorant majority how to vote have filled the state and municipal\r\noffices with those who are loyal to them first and to the governed\r\nafterward. The leaders of the successful organization of advisers\r\nand directors to the politically ignorant electorate have become an\r\nextra-legal but none the less real government. A decentralized legal\r\ngovernment has been replaced by a centralized extra-legal government.\r\nThus the power of government has again drifted into the hands of the\r\nfew. These, pursuant to well-known human characteristics, use that\r\npower selfishly. The decentralized character of the legal governmental\r\npower, the fact that only part of the offices are filled at any\r\ntime, and the enormous advantage which comes from having a standing\r\narmy of advisers and directors to guide the mass of politically\r\nignorant voters, make it difficult to replace at the polls with real\r\nrepresentatives of the electorate the appointees of this extra-legal\r\ngovernment. We have, therefore, come finally to a well-defined\r\nextra-legal but none the less real government of the few, by the few,\r\nand for the few, at the expense and against the wish of the many. We\r\nhave, in a word, achieved the establishment of a substantial unpopular\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn form the politically ignorant voter is aided by the altruistic\r\nadvice of those who know who should be elected. In form the voter\r\ncan take the advice or not as he pleases. In reality, however, and\r\nin actual practice, the power of the electorate to fill the state\r\nand municipal offices has been confided by the politically ignorant\r\nmajority to the leaders in the successful hierarchy of professional\r\nadvisers and directors to the politically ignorant voter. The elector,\r\nby being required to vote too much, has been compelled to surrender to\r\na large extent his right to vote at all, and to permit others to cast\r\nhis ballot as they see fit. Formerly people were disfranchised when\r\nthey were given no opportunity to vote. Today they are disfranchised\r\nby being required to vote too much. Formerly the legal rulers of\r\nthe disfranchised masses were selected for them by the few without\r\nequivocation. Today our legal rulers are selected for us by the few\r\nthrough the subterfuge of the masses casting their ballots according\r\nto the directions of the few. In other forms of unpopular government\r\nthe central figure has been the monarch, the autocrat, the oligarch, or\r\nthe aristocrat. In ours it is the politocrat. We have avoided monarchy,\r\nautocracy, oligarchy, and aristocracy, only to find ourselves tightly\r\nin the grasp of a politocracy.\r\n\r\nSo startling a conclusion with respect to our governmental condition\r\ninvites a detailed consideration of each step upon which that\r\nconclusion is founded.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 2\r\n\r\n The Burden upon the Electorate--The Inverted Pyramid of Governmental\r\n and Electoral Districts--The Offices to Be Filled and the Number of\r\n Electors in Each District\r\n\r\nNo doubt the average American voter in most districts will readily\r\nconcede the great burden of his political duties. But unless he has\r\nanalyzed his particular situation he will hardly realize how great is\r\nthat burden. Of course, the condition of voters in different places\r\nwill differ in detail, but the important features are much the same\r\neverywhere. For the sake of example I will analyze my own situation as\r\na voter of the Village of Winnetka, Township of New Trier, County of\r\nCook, and State of Illinois.[2]\r\n\r\nI am one of about 600 voters in a village which elects each spring,\r\non one day, about one-half of the following officers: a president,\r\n6 trustees, a clerk, a treasurer, a marshal and collector, 2 police\r\nmagistrates, and 6 library trustees; and on another day, shortly\r\nafterward, a common-school trustee.\r\n\r\nI am one of about 2,000 voters in a township which elects, on the same\r\nday that the principal village officers are elected, but at a different\r\npolling place, about one-half of the following officers: a supervisor,\r\na clerk, an assessor, a collector, a commissioner of highways, 5\r\njustices of the peace, 5 constables, and a poundmaster; and at a\r\nlater day (but on the same day that the trustee for common schools is\r\nelected), 2 high-school trustees.\r\n\r\nI am one of about 18,000 voters to elect one member of the state Senate\r\nevery four years and 3 members of the House of Representatives of the\r\nstate legislature every two years at the regular November election.\r\n\r\nI am one of about 28,000 voters who elect 5 county commissioners at the\r\nregular November election every other year.\r\n\r\nI am one of about 42,000 voters who elect one member of Congress at\r\nthe regular November election and one member of the State Board of\r\nEqualization every two years.\r\n\r\nI am one of about 322,000 voters who elect 3 sanitary trustees every\r\ntwo years at the regular November election and a president of the\r\nSanitary District every five years.\r\n\r\nI am one of about 350,000 voters who elect the following county\r\nofficers every other year at the November election: 2 of the 5 members\r\nof the Board of Assessors, 1 of the 3 members of the Board of Review,\r\n6 of the 18 judges of the Superior Court of Cook County; also about\r\none-half of the following officers: president of the Board of County\r\nCommissioners, judge of the Probate Court, judge of the County Court,\r\nstate’s attorney, recorder of deeds, clerk of the Circuit Court, clerk\r\nof the Superior Court, clerk of the Criminal Court, clerk of the\r\nAppellate Court, clerk of the Probate Court, coroner, sheriff, county\r\nclerk, county superintendent of schools, and county surveyor. I am\r\none of about 350,000 voters to elect, every other June at a special\r\nelection, about 5 of the 15 judges of the Circuit Court of Cook County.\r\n\r\nI am one of about 380,000 voters to elect 1 of the 7 justices of the\r\nSupreme Court of the state every nine years.\r\n\r\nI am one of about 1,100,000 to elect at the regular November election\r\nevery two years about one-half of the following state officers: a\r\ngovernor, a lieutenant-governor, a secretary of state, an auditor, a\r\ntreasurer, a state superintendent of public instruction, 6 trustees\r\nof the state university, clerk of the state Supreme Court, and 2\r\ncongressmen at large.\r\n\r\nI am one of about 15,000,000 voters who elect a president and\r\nvice-president of the United States every four years at the regular\r\nNovember election.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the voting booth at the regular November election in\r\n1912, the ballot given me to mark was 22 × 28 inches in size. It called\r\nupon the voter to do his part in filling, exclusive of presidential\r\nelectors, 34 offices. It presented for his consideration, exclusive of\r\npresidential electors, 181 names from which to make selections.[3]\r\n\r\nAn enumeration of the offices to be filled by election merely\r\nemphasizes the number of candidates whom the voter should inform\r\nhimself about. The extent of the burden upon the voter is not fully\r\nappreciated until it is perceived how difficult actual conditions make\r\nit for him to obtain information regarding candidates for office. The\r\nleast important and most inconspicuous state and local offices, as well\r\nas the most important and conspicuous, must engage the attention of\r\nthe electorate of the entire governmental district. But the candidates\r\nfor inconspicuous and unimportant offices must usually be men who\r\nare inconspicuous or unimportant in the community. Furthermore, the\r\nimportance and conspicuousness of subordinate offices do not increase\r\nin proportion to the increase of population. The clerk of a court\r\nor a county surveyor is not a more conspicuous officer because he\r\nholds his office in a county having over two million inhabitants. He\r\nis, therefore, proportionately less conspicuous and important as the\r\npopulation increases. The voter is, therefore, constantly presented\r\nwith candidates whose reputations are in inverse ratio to the size\r\nand population of the electoral district. The more electors there are\r\nin the district the smaller in proportion is the reputation of the\r\ncandidate. The more the character and qualifications of the candidates\r\nare hidden, the more difficult it is for the voter to obtain the\r\ninformation which he should have in order to vote intelligently. For\r\ninstance, the 600 voters in the village where the writer resides are\r\ncalled upon to select a clerk, a treasurer, a marshal and collector,\r\n2 police magistrates, and library and school trustees. In so small\r\na community the voter may with some effort actually know who the\r\ncandidates for these places are. As a matter of fact, however, that\r\neffort is considerably more than the large majority of voters will\r\npush themselves to perform. The 2,000 voters in the township where\r\nthe writer resides are called upon to elect a supervisor, a clerk, an\r\nassessor, a collector, a commissioner of highways, 5 justices of the\r\npeace, 4 constables, a poundmaster, and high-school trustees. These\r\noffices are not intrinsically more conspicuous or more important than\r\nthe village offices just enumerated. Hence the enlargement from 600 to\r\n2,000 voters causes the candidates for office to be proportionately\r\nless conspicuous in the community. To the same extent the difficulty to\r\nthe voter of obtaining information as to the character and attainments\r\nof the candidates has been increased. The members of the state Senate\r\nand House of Representatives are important officers because they\r\nexercise the legislative power of the state. The conspicuousness and\r\nimportance of each of these offices is, however, weakened by the\r\nexistence of the other, for between the representatives and senators\r\nthe legislative power is divided and each is a check upon the other.\r\nThe members of the House of Representatives in the state legislature\r\nare hidden to some extent from the voters because 3 are elected at\r\nlarge from a senatorial district containing 18,000 voters. It is more\r\ndifficult for the voter to find out about a legislator when he is one\r\nof 18,000 than when he is one of 6,000 voters. Twenty-eight thousand\r\nelectors of the County of Cook outside of the city of Chicago are\r\ncalled upon to vote for 5 of the 15 county commissioners. The office is\r\nnot likely to be held by men whom it is easy for the average voter of\r\nthe district to pick up direct information about. To elect one member\r\nof the state Board of Equalization 42,000 voters are called upon.\r\nAgain, the size of the electorate makes it difficult to know who the\r\ncandidates for the place may be. Three hundred and twenty-two thousand\r\nvoters are called upon to elect 7 sanitary trustees. Here the darkness\r\nof the average voter becomes Egyptian, and he is practically excluded\r\nfrom any means of a personal knowledge of who the candidates for the\r\nsanitary trustees are. The same is equally true of the members of the\r\nBoard of Review, members of the Board of Assessors, the 30 judges\r\nof Cook County, the president of the Board of County Commissioners,\r\nthe judge of the Probate Court, the judge of the County Court, the\r\nstate’s attorney, the recorder, the 5 clerks of the different courts,\r\nthe sheriff, the county clerk, the county superintendent of public\r\ninstruction, and the county surveyor. There are 350,000 voters who\r\nregularly cast their ballots for these officers. Among a population\r\ncontaining so many voters it is practically impossible, even for the\r\nvoter who makes an unusual effort, to acquire any personal knowledge\r\nof who the candidates for these offices are. Take the most prominent\r\nofficials in the list--the judges and state’s attorney. The intelligent\r\nman who is a voter has very little chance to acquire any personal\r\nknowledge of the fitness of the candidates for these offices. A\r\nparticular judge or a particular candidate for state’s attorney may\r\nbecome to some extent known to the voter and have the confidence of\r\nthe voter. But these are exceptional cases. The average candidate for\r\nthese offices is beyond the reach of any thoroughgoing knowledge on\r\nthe part of the voter. The difficulty of obtaining information about\r\none inconspicuous member of so large a population is too great. In\r\nIllinois, to select a secretary of state, an auditor, a treasurer, a\r\nstate superintendent of schools, 6 trustees of the state university, a\r\nclerk of the state Supreme Court, and 2 congressmen at large, 1,100,000\r\nvoters are called upon. Here again the inconspicuousness of the offices\r\ncompared with the size of the electorate is such that the obstacle to\r\nthe voter informing himself about candidates is practically insuperable.\r\n\r\nOne would think that the voter had difficulty enough in finding out\r\nabout candidates as a result of the simple process of requiring\r\ncomparatively inconspicuous and unimportant offices to be filled by\r\na very numerous electorate. But his difficulty has been enormously\r\nincreased by the process of requiring the voter to do the larger part\r\nof his investigating for the purpose of voting at a single election.\r\nFor instance, the writer is called upon at a single election in\r\nNovember to investigate the qualifications for office of a president\r\nand vice-president of the United States, a congressman for his\r\ndistrict, 2 congressmen at large, about one-half of the state officers,\r\nand about one-half of the county officers. To be exact, he must look up\r\ncandidates for 34 different offices (not including the presidential\r\nelectors) presented upon the long ballot given _supra_ (opposite p.\r\n29), to the number of 181. Assuming that information about some of\r\nthe candidates for the more important offices, such as members of\r\nCongress and members of the state legislature, could be looked up and\r\nreliable information obtained, the chances are that this will not be\r\ndone because other more important offices, like that of president of\r\nthe United States and governor of the state, are to be filled. This\r\nprocess of preventing the voter from investigating candidates for even\r\nimportant and conspicuous offices by putting so much investigating upon\r\nhim at a single election that he cannot do it has operated to produce\r\npolitical ignorance on the part of the electorate as to candidates for\r\nCongress and the state legislature. These are important and conspicuous\r\noffices. The candidates come from comparatively small districts. If\r\nselected at an election where they were the only offices to be filled,\r\na very considerable amount of intelligence might be displayed by the\r\nelectorate. But these offices are hidden among half a hundred other\r\noffices for which several hundred other candidates are running. In\r\nthe mass the voter is distracted and fails to a considerable extent\r\nto distinguish the important from the unimportant. The extraordinary\r\namount of investigating to be done overwhelms and discourages him,\r\nand he goes to the polls too frequently utterly ignorant of the\r\nqualifications of candidates for members of Congress and the state\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nThat the decentralization of governmental power and the increased\r\napplication of the elective principle has necessarily cast upon the\r\nelectorate an enormous burden in order that it may vote intelligently\r\nis clear enough from the everyday experience of the voter at the\r\npolls. At least one political scientist has directed an experiment to\r\nemphasize it. President Judson, a few years ago, gave to a graduate\r\nclass at the University of Chicago, four weeks before the regular fall\r\nelection in Cook County, a list of all the candidates for office on a\r\nballot substantially similar to that which appears _supra_ (p. 29),\r\nand required them to report at the time of the election such facts as\r\nthey could ascertain about the candidates and their qualifications.\r\nWith diligent work on the part of the really mature men in Dr. Judson’s\r\nclass a satisfactory report was turned in with regard to only a small\r\npercentage of the entire list. This, Dr. Judson thought, fairly\r\nindicated what the average voter could do on his own responsibility in\r\nthe way of securing information respecting candidates if he had spent\r\nthe same amount of time with that object in view.\r\n\r\nNot only is it obvious that the voter is under a great burden with\r\nrespect to seeking and securing information about the candidates\r\nfor office he is called upon to vote for, but it is clear that the\r\ntask is so great as to be impossible of fulfilment by the large mass\r\nof the electorate who have their place in competitive industry to\r\nmaintain. A small handful of intelligent men of commanding position\r\nin the community, after many years of experience, may be able with\r\ncomparatively little expenditure of time to inform themselves\r\naccurately concerning a large number of the candidates of the two\r\nor three principal parties on the ballot. But the average man whose\r\nposition in the community and experience with affairs is more limited\r\ncould not obtain the proper amount of information without an actual\r\nneglect of his business or profession--a neglect which he dare not\r\npermit. The voter who occupies a salaried position which demands a\r\nfull day of work for his employer throughout the year has no time,\r\ninclination, nor opportunity for prolonged investigation into the\r\nqualifications of candidates for public office. The residuary mass of\r\nthe electorate have neither the time, the experience, nor the interest\r\nto investigate in advance and inform themselves of the qualifications\r\nof candidates to be presented for a large number of offices.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3\r\n\r\n The Resulting Political Ignorance of the Voter and His Consequent\r\n Disfranchisement\r\n\r\nOf course, there is some political ignorance due to illiteracy and\r\ngeneral lack of intelligence. With this, however, we are not now\r\nprincipally concerned. It is here assumed that except in small\r\nand exceptional districts the great majority of voters are neither\r\nilliterate nor unintelligent, but are of a fair average intelligence\r\nand capable of reaching and following sound moral and political\r\njudgments. The fact which is now to be emphasized is that the burden\r\nupon the voter is such that the vote of the most intelligent man is\r\nmade quite as politically ignorant as that of the least intelligent.\r\nThe percentage of politically ignorant voting has become very high, not\r\nbecause the voter is unintelligent, but in spite of the fact that he\r\nmay be extremely intelligent. An electorate that is capable of casting\r\nan 85 per cent intelligent vote on a given matter of importance has,\r\nby the simple process of requiring the voter to vote too much, been\r\nreduced to the voting effectiveness of a Filipino who is not yet ready\r\nfor popular institutions. To the extent that our intelligent voter has\r\nthus artificially been made ignorant in the discharge of his political\r\nduties he has been disfranchised. Too much of what popularly passes\r\nfor democracy has resulted in too little real democracy.\r\n\r\nWhen the voter faces in the voting booth such a ballot as that already\r\nexhibited _supra_ (opposite p. 29), or even a much simpler one, he has\r\nno time to analyze his condition of knowledge or ignorance. He must\r\nvote quickly and be about his business. If we could secure a revelation\r\nfrom the voter of the state of his mind as he faces the ballot, would\r\nnot his condition of ignorance be appalling? He would, of course, admit\r\nthat he knew nothing of the duties of a large number of the offices to\r\nbe filled. He would admit that he knew nothing of the qualifications of\r\na large number of the men who were seeking office. Indeed, many of them\r\nhe would never have heard of. The average voter would no doubt have\r\nprepared himself, by reading, by following events, and by discussing\r\nthe matter with other voters, to vote for a particular candidate for\r\npresident of the United States. From the same sources he might acquire\r\na personal preference among the candidates for governor of the state.\r\nHe might have a personal preference founded upon some actual knowledge\r\nor current rumor as to the proper candidate for congressman or member\r\nof the state legislature or president of the county board. He might be\r\nsatisfied that some one of the several candidates running for several\r\nvacancies on the bench ought to be elected. It is hardly probable,\r\nhowever, that he will have any personal preference founded upon any\r\nactual knowledge as to the candidates for all these places at once.\r\nOutside the candidates for three or four places he will be utterly\r\nand entirely devoid of any personal knowledge upon which to base an\r\nintelligent vote.\r\n\r\nTo make this position more concrete I will describe my own state of\r\nmind as to the ballot illustrated _supra_ (facing p. 29). I never\r\nheard the names of any of the candidates on the Socialist Labor,\r\nthe Socialist, or Prohibition tickets except those of Debs and\r\nChafin, and of these I had an impression about the qualifications\r\nfor office only with respect to Mr. Debs. On the Democratic ticket I\r\nthink I was intelligent with respect to Mr. Wilson’s candidacy for\r\npresident and Mr. Dunne’s for governor. I had some personal knowledge\r\nregarding one candidate for a trustee of the state university, the\r\ncandidates for state’s attorney and for president of the Board of\r\nCounty Commissioners. The other names on the Democratic ticket\r\nmeant nothing to me. On the Republican ticket I regarded myself as\r\ninformed sufficiently to vote intelligently on Mr. Taft’s candidacy\r\nfor president, and Mr. Deneen’s for governor. I had some personal\r\nknowledge regarding one candidate for representative at large in\r\nCongress, the candidates for representative in Congress from the\r\ncongressional district, and for president of the Board of County\r\nCommissioners. Of the remaining thirty-nine names on the Republican\r\nticket I recognized one as that of the son of a war governor, one as a\r\nformer attorney-general, one as a former county judge, three seeking\r\nclerkships and the office of coroner, as the incumbents of the offices\r\nfor which they were running, and one as a lawyer with whom I had some\r\npersonal acquaintance. The names of the other candidates at the time I\r\nvoted meant absolutely nothing to me. On the Progressive ticket I was\r\nintelligent with respect to Mr. Roosevelt’s candidacy for president\r\nand Mr. Johnson’s for vice-president; also to the candidacy of those\r\nseeking the offices of attorney-general and representative to the state\r\nlegislature. I had some acquaintance with one of the candidates for\r\ntrustee of the University of Illinois, and one of the five candidates\r\nfor county commissioner. The rest of the names meant nothing whatever\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nIf the offices which the voter was called upon to fill while\r\npolitically ignorant were few in number and altogether insignificant in\r\nthe extent of the governmental power which they controlled, not much\r\nharm would be done. But little by little, as population has increased\r\nand social and governmental organization has become more complex and\r\nthe political duties of the voter have grown heavier, the political\r\nignorance of the voter has extended to a constantly increasing number\r\nof candidates for office, until the sum total of the governmental\r\npower of all the offices for which the voter casts his ballot in\r\npolitical ignorance constitutes the principal part of the entire local\r\nand state governmental power. The great sources of governmental power\r\nare the Congress of the United States, the legislatures of the state\r\nand local governments. When the tide of political ignorance on the part\r\nof the intelligent voter rises so high that it embraces the candidates\r\nfor the local, state, and federal legislative bodies, the situation is\r\nserious. When it includes the local judiciary and all but the president\r\nof the United States, the highest executive officer of the state and of\r\nthe principal local government, the situation has become desperate.\r\n\r\nSo far as the electorate is too ignorant to vote intelligently it has\r\nbeen in effect disfranchised. It does not really vote at all. If the\r\nvoter were required to vote blindfolded, or if the ballot were made up\r\nin cipher, he would know that he was disfranchised. Suppose, however,\r\nthat the voter is blindfolded or the ballot done in cipher only in\r\nthose instances where the voter is called upon to vote without any\r\npolitical information necessary to enable him to vote intelligently.\r\nWould he be any worse off because of the cipher or the bandage on his\r\neyes? Does not the political ignorance of the voter as clearly deprive\r\nhim of his power to vote as the use of a cipher or blindfolding? In\r\nboth cases he goes through the mechanical act of voting, but he records\r\nnothing at all by so doing.\r\n\r\nThe ignorance of the voter and his consequent disfranchisement\r\nfollow necessarily from our present plan of government. They result\r\nimmediately from the burdens placed upon the electorate. Those in\r\nturn arise from the application of the two principles of government\r\nwhich we have constantly heretofore applauded and proclaimed--the\r\ndecentralization of governmental power and the principle that all\r\noffices of any consequence should be elective. These principles of\r\ngovernment are still regarded by the mass of the people as the true and\r\nonly sources of democracy and the necessary protection of the people\r\nfrom all forms of unpopular government. The application of these\r\nprinciples is in varying degrees protected by state constitutions which\r\nprovide for the separation of the powers of government, both state\r\nand local, among departments and officers, and require local as well\r\nas state subordinate officers to be elected at frequent intervals.[4]\r\nThus do the letter and the spirit of our governmental theory and\r\npractice necessarily induce the wholesale ignorance and consequent\r\ndisfranchisement of the large majority of the electorate in regard to\r\ncandidates for offices, which, when filled, wield a very large, if not\r\nthe larger, part of the state and local governmental power.\r\n\r\nFormerly unpopular government was founded upon the absence of any\r\nvoting. Today the electorate, while voting furiously, has nevertheless\r\nbeen deprived to a large extent of the ballot because a burden of\r\nknowledge--an educational qualification, in effect--has been placed\r\nupon it which, under present conditions, it does not and cannot\r\nfulfil. Thus, by the simple process of too much so-called popular\r\ndemocracy--that is, too much decentralization of governmental power\r\nand too much voting--we have arrived at the essential condition\r\nwhich invites the establishment of unpopular government--namely, the\r\ndisfranchisement of the electorate.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4\r\n\r\n The Power of the Electorate Passes to Those Who Take Advantage of Its\r\n Political Ignorance to Direct It How to Vote\r\n\r\nThe severe educational qualification which has been imposed upon the\r\nelectorate today has done more than merely deprive the voter of the\r\npower to vote. It has presented to others the _opportunity_ to direct\r\nthe voter how to vote and thus in effect to cast his ballot for him.\r\nThat opportunity has at once been taken advantage of by men who have\r\nbeen quick to perceive the vast political power which the privilege\r\nof casting the voter’s ballot for him confers. This combination of\r\nopportunity and selfish motive is the complete cause of the passing of\r\na considerable part of the political power of the electorate at large\r\nto the few who direct it how to vote. It is important that the way in\r\nwhich the effect follows from the causal conditions be set forth in as\r\ndetailed and precise a manner as possible.\r\n\r\nThe voting for a large number of the most important offices in the\r\nstate and municipal government is done during a few hours on election\r\nday. In these few hours great masses of voters come face to face with\r\nsuch a ballot as appears opposite p. 29. They have no opinion as to any\r\nof the candidates except a very few, for the most part at the head of\r\nthe ticket. They do not, however, because of their ignorance refrain\r\nfrom voting. Neither do they pitch a coin to decide for whom they shall\r\nvote. They insist on voting, and they take their voting seriously.\r\nIt follows that when they are politically ignorant they vote the way\r\nthey are told to vote by somebody. The important questions are: Who\r\ntells them how to vote? and By what means are they told? The small\r\nminority, including many of the most intelligent, vote the way they\r\nare directed by some newspaper. At one time a prominent newspaper in\r\nChicago was credited with the ability to direct about one-tenth of\r\nthe voters in a county or city election how to cast their ballots.\r\nBut this was possible only when the newspaper concentrated its entire\r\ninfluence on the filling of one or two offices. The newspaper gives\r\nvery little advice to the voter with respect to the filling of a\r\nconsiderable majority of offices for which elections are held. Even\r\nas to the few offices with regard to the candidates for which the\r\nnewspaper makes a great effort to advise voters, its influence is\r\nlimited. A large proportion of the electorate vote the party circle.\r\nSome are moved by sentiment or strong prejudices; others by the fact\r\nthat men of whom they know something personally are responsible for\r\nthe nominations or appear as candidates in a prominent place on a\r\nparticular ticket. In every case a vote in the party circle, which is a\r\nblanket vote for a great number of party candidates of whom the voter\r\nhas no knowledge, is a vote according to the direction of those who\r\npromoted or directed the nomination of the men who appear as candidates\r\nin that party column. It is believed, however, that a very large body\r\nof voters--especially in districts where large numbers are generally\r\nignorant or illiterate--need, and indeed must have, advice as to how\r\nto vote from some individual whom they either look up to and trust,\r\nor fear. These voters do not ask for political leadership. They do\r\nnot desire information upon which to found political opinions. All\r\nthey ask for is advice as to how to mark their ballots. In congested\r\ncenters of population this advice is sought within a few hours in a\r\nsingle day by tens and even hundreds of thousands of voters. The voter\r\nwants information as he approaches the booth. Even those who allow a\r\nnewspaper to direct them how to vote need advice in voting for offices\r\nwhich the newspaper ignores. So the practice of independent voting and\r\nsplitting tickets causes the voter to seek advice from those who make\r\nit their business to know something about the candidates. If these\r\nmasses do not obtain instruction and advice as to whom to vote for\r\nthey must refrain from voting, or pitch a coin, or fall back upon the\r\nparty circle. They do the last as the most rational, and thus take\r\nthe directions of those who are able to place the names of candidates\r\nunder the party circle. In brief, the entire situation is something\r\nlike this: As to four-fifths of the candidates for office the voters\r\nare politically ignorant; yet they insist upon voting and in taking\r\nseriously their duty as a citizen to vote. They will not pitch a coin.\r\nHence they must vote the way they are told. Nine-tenths of the voters\r\nwho cast ballots for four-fifths of the offices are directed to vote\r\nby those who have placed the names upon the ballot or by someone\r\nwho makes a special appeal to the voter at the polls or by a special\r\ncanvass before election.\r\n\r\nNot only, however, does the political ignorance of the voter present\r\nan obvious opportunity to someone to direct him how to vote and thus\r\ncast his ballot for him, but an overwhelming self-interest on the\r\npart of individuals invokes at once the strongest motive to use the\r\nopportunity. The man that can control the power of the electorate will\r\nsecure the power to appoint to office. He who can regularly place the\r\ncandidate in office will soon control the holder of the office and\r\nexercise the governmental power which the officeholder wields. The\r\nsecuring of such governmental power has always been an object in itself\r\nto a proportion of the individuals in every community. When seen as a\r\nsource of personal profit and advancement, the numbers who will strive\r\nfor it and the efforts which they will make are greatly increased.\r\nIndeed, the prize which the successful secure is such as to produce the\r\nkeenest competition and the most exhaustive effort.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice that the necessities of candidates quickly\r\nreveal the extent of the political ignorance of the voter and the\r\nopportunity which this affords for someone to direct him how to vote.\r\nThe candidate, of whom the vast majority of voters are politically\r\nignorant because his office is obscure and inconspicuous, finds that\r\nhis election is not a matter of his policies and efficiency, but of the\r\nefforts of workers at the polls and the canvassing of voters before\r\nelection. Such a candidate needs the support of successful advisers to\r\nthe politically ignorant voter. He needs the support of that man or\r\ncombination of men in the community that can cast the largest number of\r\nvotes of the politically ignorant. A little experience in fulfilling\r\nthis apparently innocent and legitimate demand for a campaign manager\r\nwill reveal to the manager the character of the voter’s political\r\nignorance and the fact that someone must always direct him how to vote,\r\nand that this is the means by which political power is to be secured.\r\nA slight actual experience is all that is necessary to point the real\r\npath to the exercise by the few of governmental power.\r\n\r\nSuch conditions of opportunity revealed and ever-present selfish\r\nmotives must inevitably produce men who aspire to be successful\r\nadvisers to the electorate. Active competition for these places\r\nnaturally ensues. Success, then, means the survival of the fittest.\r\nThat means that among the professionals those win who take their\r\nprofession seriously, understand it thoroughly, and practice it\r\nassiduously and with judgment, tact, and craft. Here, then, we have\r\nthe local political boss or professional politician. He is merely the\r\nsuccessful local adviser and director to the politically ignorant\r\nvoter. He is the man who can, more than anyone else, in a local\r\ndistrict, direct the largest number of the politically ignorant how\r\nto vote. He advises and directs the voter how to vote principally by\r\npersonal canvasses of the voters and solicitations at the polls and\r\nby controlling the machinery of nominations so as to determine who\r\nshall appear as a candidate under a given party name. The political\r\nignorance of the voter is one of the necessary conditions to his\r\nexistence. The fact that most voters cannot make a show of voting\r\nintelligently without someone to help them provides the opportunity\r\nwhich calls him into being. The power of the successful adviser and\r\ndirector to the voter is in direct ratio to the political ignorance of\r\nthe electorate. It makes no difference whether that ignorance be the\r\nresult of general lack of intelligence or be artificially produced by\r\nplacing a special educational qualification upon the voter which he\r\ncannot or will not fulfil. To the extent that the adviser and director\r\nof the politically ignorant voter can direct and advise the voter how\r\nto vote, he can fill the offices of the state and local governments\r\nwith those who are loyal to him, and thus control some part of the\r\npower of government.\r\n\r\nSince the business of directing the politically ignorant voter how to\r\nvote has fallen into the hands of a professional class and since the\r\nprize to be won is the control of governmental power, it is not to be\r\nwondered at that the profession has become highly organized for the\r\npurpose of achieving its object; that men of extraordinary power and\r\nability have arisen as its leaders, and that to a very great extent the\r\nobject of the organization has been achieved.\r\n\r\nThe political boss or adviser to the politically ignorant voter\r\nfirst appears in the smaller election districts. His advent is\r\ncoincident with a certain degree of political ignorance on the part\r\nof the electorate. At first that ignorance was the result of the\r\nactual illiteracy which appeared in the majority of the voters of a\r\nparticular district, usually in a large city. Thus we first hear of\r\nthe ward boss in our larger cities. His ward usually contains a large\r\nforeign population living in the densest political ignorance, easily\r\nterrified, easily cajoled, and easily corrupted. The steady increase in\r\nthe length of ballots and the burden placed upon the electorate soon,\r\nhowever, began to produce artificially a state of political ignorance\r\non the part of the most intelligent electorate. This at once produced\r\nthe political boss for districts where the electorate was possessed\r\nof a high average of character and intelligence. This boss was of a\r\ndifferent type from a river-ward boss. It took longer to make him. He\r\nwas of a somewhat finer grain. He had some inkling of the fact that he\r\nreally bore a fiduciary relation to the politically ignorant electorate\r\nwhom he advised and directed and whose vote he cast. He had to possess\r\nhimself of the confidence and the trust of his constituents. His\r\nsuccess was obtained only by close attention to his profession and by\r\nqualities of tact and leadership. His supremacy was retained only by\r\ncare and subtlety. The moment each one of any considerable number of\r\nlocal election districts developed such a professional political boss\r\nit was inevitable that they should begin to act together to direct and\r\nadvise the politically ignorant voters of the larger districts how to\r\nvote when it came to the filling of a more important office in a larger\r\nelection district. Thus the bosses of the city wards and the country\r\ndistricts combined to agree on who should be presented to the voter\r\nfor election and to direct the voter how to vote. Naturally out of\r\nthe combination some men emerged capable of leading the combination\r\nof bosses. Thus arose the city or county machine. In extraordinary\r\ninstances a single man became a city or county boss for a particular\r\nparty organization. In the same way, when the districts of a state\r\nwere well provided with permanent political bosses, there was a\r\nmovement among the leaders to combine into a state machine. Again, in\r\nextraordinary cases a single man was great enough to be the supreme\r\npolitical leader of a political party organization in a state and to\r\nlead it regularly to victory at the polls.\r\n\r\nThus almost imperceptibly, but with astonishing rapidity, there have\r\nbeen developed state-wide feudal organizations for the purpose--in\r\nform at least--of advising the politically ignorant voter how to\r\nvote, but in reality for the purpose of casting his vote for him, and\r\nthus securing the political power of the electorate. In each smallest\r\nelection precinct there is a regular band of workers under a precinct\r\ncaptain. In each collection of precincts which make the smallest\r\nelectoral district, like a ward in a city or a township in the country,\r\nthere must be a mesne lord whom the captains obey. In larger election\r\ndistricts, such as a city or a county, or a combination of counties,\r\nthere must be tenants in chief over the mesne lords. Finally, there\r\nis the great lord paramount for the whole state. No precinct captain\r\nis permitted to have any idea of principles or policies. It is his\r\nduty, with his aids, to produce delegates for conventions who will\r\nvote as the organization chiefs direct, canvass the precinct before\r\nelection and buy, command, instruct, persuade, or coerce, as the\r\nexigencies of the case may require, votes for the candidates named by\r\nthe organization chiefs. When the precinct captain and his workers fail\r\nto perform these services successfully, out they must go, and others,\r\nwaiting eagerly for promotion, will take their places. When they show\r\nability they will make progress in the organization. The district boss\r\nmust equally keep his captains in obedience and effectiveness. For him\r\nalso there is promotion or reduction to the ranks in prospect. It is\r\nthe law of life and the source of the organization’s power that its\r\nofficers render implicit obedience to their immediate chiefs and that a\r\nmighty personality direct the whole.\r\n\r\nThus does the power of the electorate pass to those who take advantage\r\nof the political ignorance of the electorate to direct it how to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5\r\n\r\n The Power of Government Passes into the Hands of Those Who Are Able\r\n to Direct the Majority of the Politically Ignorant How to Vote. They\r\n Constitute an Extra-legal but None the Less Real Government\r\n\r\nThe professional adviser and director to the politically ignorant\r\nvoter aims to secure control of as much of the power of government as\r\npossible. His means to that end consist in becoming the most important\r\nsingle factor in the filling of the offices of the legal government.\r\nSuccess in advising and directing a majority of the politically\r\nignorant voters how to vote places in his hands the power to fill by\r\nappointment all offices for which candidates are presented who are\r\nunknown to the electorate generally. Our political boss naturally\r\ntends to appoint men who are loyal to him and to his power, and by\r\nthis means he naturally secures a certain control over part of the\r\nlocal governmental power. In the same way, the prize of a combination\r\nof successful local bosses is the power to appoint the majority of the\r\nofficeholders of some more extensive and important local municipal\r\ngovernment and thus obtain control of a part of its governmental power.\r\nWhen the state-wide organization of the feudal army of directors\r\nand advisers to the politically ignorant voter has been thoroughly\r\nperfected, with a man of great ability at its head, the prize to be\r\nobtained is the principal part of the entire governmental power,\r\nwhether state or local. More and more such an organization will fill\r\nwith men loyal to its leaders the local and state legislative bodies,\r\nthe local and state executive offices, and even places upon the bench.\r\nSuch an organization, when continuously successful for any length\r\nof time, will have actually filled all of the less conspicuous and\r\nless important offices in the executive, legislative, and judicial\r\ndepartments of the state and local governments.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of such an organization will go farther than this.\r\nBeing in existence and efficient, it will often be a determining factor\r\nin nominating and electing a candidate for an office so important,\r\nand, viewed by itself, so conspicuous, that in a special election\r\nto fill that one office the intelligence of the electorate would be\r\ndisplayed at its maximum. For instance, if we look at the federal\r\ngovernment alone, we find that the voter casts his ballot only for\r\npresident, vice-president, and usually only one congressman. The\r\ncongressman is selected for the most part from a fairly small district.\r\nTaking the federal government by itself, the voter’s function in\r\nselecting a congressman is so simple and direct that no professional\r\nadvice or direction is needed except in the unusual case where the\r\ndistrict is filled with an actual illiterate vote. But the moment the\r\nvote-directing organization is called into being in the congressional\r\ndistrict because of the artificially produced political ignorance of\r\nthe voter in respect to candidates for various local municipal offices\r\nand state offices, such an organization at once exercises an important\r\ncontrol over the nomination and election of the congressman. In the\r\nsame way the organization will gain a very considerable influence over\r\nthe nomination and election of candidates for local municipal offices\r\nwhere they consist only of the mayor and an alderman from each ward,\r\nwho are elected at a special election. Such an organization will have\r\nat all times a vast influence in the nomination and election of judges,\r\neven when they are chosen at a special election. There is no doubt that\r\nthe nomination for governor of the state and president of the United\r\nStates may from time to time be greatly influenced by politocrats whose\r\npower is based upon the political ignorance of the voter in respect to\r\ncandidates for all manner of obscure offices in the state and local\r\ngovernments. Speaking generally, if the voter is habitually so ignorant\r\npolitically that the politocrats have secured, to a considerable\r\nextent, the power to direct him how to vote, then the politocrats\r\nwill exercise a great deal of influence in determining who shall be\r\nelected to offices so conspicuous and important that if they were the\r\nonly ones filled by election the voter would exercise a high degree of\r\nindependence and intelligence in making his selection and the services\r\nof the same politocrats would be wholly dispensed with.\r\n\r\nA vote-directing organization which is steadily successful in a given\r\nstate or local government for eight years will reach a point where it\r\nactually places in practically all the state and local offices that\r\nare filled by election, and also in the House of Representatives, in\r\nCongress, and in the United States Senate, men who are loyal to the\r\norganization and its leaders before everything else. The leader of such\r\nan organization may even have obtained a controlling influence with the\r\ngovernor of the state and the president of the United States, so far\r\nas their power extends to local appointments and affairs. When this\r\noccurs, the leaders of the state and local vote-directing organization\r\nhave become the real though extra-legal government. The real power of\r\ngovernment, both state and local, and an important influence in the\r\npower of the federal government are in their hands. Local and state\r\nexecutive officers and local and state legislators will take orders\r\nfrom these leaders. Judges in a more subtle way will take account of\r\ntheir wishes.\r\n\r\nThus we have, however imperceptibly, none the less effectively changed\r\nthe character of our government. The very excess of our precautions\r\nto prevent the power of government from coming into the hands of\r\nthe few has delivered the power of government into the hands of the\r\nfew. So obviously and completely has the elaborate effort of our\r\nconstitution-makers failed to keep governmental power out of the\r\nhands of the few that we might as well accept it as axiomatic that\r\ngovernmental authority in any highly organized society cannot be\r\nprevented from becoming concentrated in the hands of the few. Our form\r\nof government has indeed changed from the decentralized democracy\r\nof the frontier to the centralized politocracy of a highly organized\r\ncivilization. We have turned our back upon the autocrat and the\r\naristocrat only to find ourselves in the hands of the politocrat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6\r\n\r\n The Extra-legal Government Uses Its Power Selfishly to Maintain Itself\r\n and to Benefit Those Who Have Organized and Supported It\r\n\r\nOur extra-legal government is not one of altruists. It may be relied\r\nupon to act selfishly in two respects: First, it will use all of its\r\ninfluence and power to maintain itself. Then as its tenure of power\r\nbecomes more secure it will use that power to reward the leaders who\r\nhave organized and supported it.\r\n\r\nThe clear perception of what is necessary for the maintenance of\r\nthe extra-legal government will provide the wise politocrat with\r\na deep-rooted political philosophy. His creed, if uttered, would\r\nsound something like this: “I believe in the disfranchisement of the\r\nvoter by keeping him too ignorant politically to vote intelligently.\r\nI believe that all voters, no matter how intelligent in general,\r\ncan be made politically ignorant in voting by placing upon them a\r\nburden of investigating candidates and attending elections which\r\nthey can conceivably, but will not in fact, perform. I believe that\r\nsuch a burden upon the voter can be produced most readily by the\r\ndecentralization of governmental power in every possible way, and the\r\nconstant application of the elective principle. I therefore believe\r\nin fostering the popular fear of kings, the popular prejudice against\r\nthe centralization of power and the filling of offices by appointment.\r\nAbove all I believe in more democracy (i.e., more applications of the\r\nelective principle) as the cure for the ills of democracy.”\r\n\r\nWith these deep-seated convictions, the course of action of the wise\r\npolitocrat in many respects is not difficult to predict and not\r\ndifficult to understand when it is observed. The chief executive of\r\nthe state or of the United States who, in response to any popular\r\ndemand, attempts to influence or coerce the legislature must be\r\npublicly rebuked. It must be pointed out that he is overstepping the\r\nbounds of his constitutional power. He must confine himself to the\r\nlimited constitutional sphere of the executive. When a man becomes\r\ngovernor or president he must cease to be a citizen. The promotion\r\nof decentralization of governmental power through the creation of\r\nseveral new municipal corporations operating in the same district is\r\na step which should always receive the favorable attention of the\r\npolitocrats. The constant application of the elective principle to\r\neach newly created office must be maintained. The election district\r\nfurthermore should always be kept as large as possible and always\r\nlarger than the personal reputation of anyone who would be likely to\r\nseek a given office which the voters of the district select. Methods\r\nof redistricting can be devised and carried out so as to yield the\r\nmaximum amount of power for the extra-legal government for the time\r\nbeing in power. Election laws must be so shaped and administrative\r\nacts so directed as to enable the organization to marshal its votes in\r\nthe most effective way. New parties and independent movements must be\r\ndiscouraged. One of the neatest devices to effect such discouragement\r\nis to retain the party circle and at the same time provide that no\r\ncandidate shall appear on more than one ticket on the ballot. That\r\nwill force all candidates who can secure the extra-legal government’s\r\nparty nomination to take it as against an independent nomination.\r\nThe fact that the extra-legal government puts up some men who are\r\nsatisfactory and who cannot also be placed upon an independent ticket\r\nwill discourage the putting in the field of any independent ticket. No\r\nharm will be done to the extra-legal government by politocrats if the\r\nnetwork of governmental bodies becomes very complex, or if the details\r\nof carrying out provisions of election laws become so difficult to\r\nunderstand that the whole machinery of elections must be directed by a\r\nfew experts.\r\n\r\nBut the chief care of the wise politocrat will not be to acquire a\r\nselfish political philosophy or a selfish program for governmental\r\nlegislation. Of paramount importance is the organizing, recruiting,\r\ntraining, feeding, and caring for the feudal army of directors and\r\nadvisers to the politically ignorant voter and the rewarding of the\r\nofficers and lesser leaders of that army according to their position.\r\nSo far as possible, of course, the district and precinct workers will\r\nbe given places upon the public pay-rolls and so fed and clothed from\r\nthe public treasury. In return for what they receive from the public\r\nthey will do the minimum amount of work for the public and the maximum\r\namount for the organization. Places on the pay-rolls of private\r\ncorporations may also be at the disposal of the leaders among the\r\npolitocrats. In a city of any size much small graft connected with the\r\nissuing of licenses of all sorts, the selling of liquor, the business\r\nof vice, and the activities of the underworld may be picked up by the\r\nprivates and captains in the organization. The lesser politocrats\r\nwill take the higher salaried positions and fee offices. It will not\r\ninterfere with their obtaining these places that they must submit to an\r\nelection. The work of the office will be done by a chief deputy paid\r\nout of the public treasury. The holder of the office will, therefore,\r\nbe enabled to spend his entire time conducting the business of advising\r\nand directing the politically ignorant voter whom to vote for. The\r\nlarger graft connected with the protection of the business of vice\r\nand the activities of the underworld will go to those who are still\r\nhigher up among the politocrats. This, however, is a dirty and risky\r\nmode of reward and the protection which can be given has its limits.\r\nMany politocrats, and among them the most powerful, will not touch\r\nit personally. In certain districts men of excellent social standing\r\nand mental attainments can be used to advantage by the extra-legal\r\ngovernment. In most instances material of this sort can be drawn from\r\namong lawyers. The reward for those who are constant and effective in\r\ntheir service will be a place in the corporation counsel’s office or\r\nthe state’s attorney’s office, and finally a place upon the bench. The\r\nlarger graft of public contracts is reserved for the overlords of the\r\nfeudal organization. But even this the great leaders will not touch.\r\n\r\nThe great prize which is reserved for the lord paramount and his\r\ntenants in chief is the privilege of entering into an alliance,\r\noffensive and defensive, with special business and property interests\r\nwhich need the aid of the local or state governmental power to exploit\r\nto the best advantage the many, or the protection from governmental\r\ninterference at the demand of the many who are being exploited. Indeed,\r\nso close may the relations become between the great captains of such\r\nspecial business and property interests and the extra-legal government\r\nby politocrats, that the real power of government may to some extent\r\nactually reside in the former rather than the latter. It will indeed\r\nbe difficult in many instances to tell which group commands and which\r\nobeys. Where the leaders of both are equally able there will be a\r\ncomplete partnership.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 7\r\n\r\n The Extra-legal Government Is Able to Maintain Itself in the Face of\r\n Popular Disapproval\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which extra-legal government exercises its power\r\nand the manner of that exercise furnish it with certain considerable\r\nadvantages in its very natural effort to maintain itself in the face of\r\npopular disapproval.\r\n\r\nThe extra-legal government has the advantage of being hidden from the\r\nelectorate. The mass of voters can tell who only a few conspicuous\r\nofficeholders in the legal government at any one time are. Of the\r\nexistence of a thoroughly organized extra-legal government they have\r\nno real knowledge whatever. If they have some idea of machines and\r\nbosses it is vague and imperfect. They see only a little at a time and\r\nhave no idea who it is that casts their ballots for them. The voter\r\nwho masters such secrets is rare indeed. Even the very intelligent\r\nman who is a voter cannot tell anything in his own district about the\r\nextra-legal government. He only knows that there are bosses whom he\r\nnever seems to have a chance to vote against. This secrecy on the part\r\nof the extra-legal government is an invaluable asset in enabling it to\r\nretain power. So long as extra-legal government remains hidden, there\r\nis little chance of the voter causing it any serious damage.\r\n\r\nThe extra-legal government has a great advantage also in the fact that\r\nwhile it is the real government, the electorate is constantly voting\r\nfor the legal but dummy government of officeholders. Of course, if the\r\nvoter knew the connection between each officeholder and the extra-legal\r\ngovernment he might vote intelligently, but that is information of\r\nthe most secret kind. In many instances it is impossible for anyone\r\nto obtain it. Certainly it cannot be expected that a voter who is\r\nin ignorance of the qualifications and personality of most of the\r\ncandidates for office will ever know what connection any of them have\r\nwith a more or less secret extra-legal government.\r\n\r\nThe wise politocrat appreciates the advantage which his extra-legal\r\ngovernment has in hiding behind the legal government and in the fact\r\nthat his power is not subject directly to the approval or disapproval\r\nof the electorate. He knows, however, that from time to time some loyal\r\nadherent of the extra-legal government will demand and must be given\r\nthe nomination for an office so prominent that his record will be fully\r\ninvestigated and his relation to the extra-legal government become\r\nwidely known. Then the existence of extra-legal government will, in the\r\ncontest for that office, become an issue, especially if there be an\r\nindependent anti-politocratic candidate. But experience will make it\r\nclear that such an issue must be avoided. The extra-legal government\r\nmust drop as a candidate for an office of any prominence a man known\r\nby the electorate to be loyal to the politocracy. In his place may be\r\nput a fresh dummy or a real independent, as the exigencies of the case\r\nrequire. The former step is, of course, from the point of view of the\r\npolitocrat, to be preferred. When, however, the outlook is dark and\r\nforbidding for the extra-legal government in power, its leaders will\r\nassent with a show of enthusiasm to the nomination of a Hughes or a\r\nWilson. They know that the naming of an independent and popular man who\r\nis likely to be successful at the polls will enable their extra-legal\r\ngovernment to appoint to office the subordinate elective officeholders\r\nin the legal government. They know that a governor surrounded by\r\nindependent subordinate officers and opposed by legislators selected\r\nby and loyal to the extra-legal government can do that government no\r\npermanent damage. They know that most men can, during their term of\r\noffice, when placed in close contact with such opposition, be worn down\r\nand disheartened, so that they are glad to quit when the opportunity\r\nfor promotion to a place where they need no longer war upon extra-legal\r\ngovernment is tendered them. Thus, a popular governor may be induced to\r\naccept the position of vice-president or a place upon the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe failure to observe this principle of action at the Republican\r\nNational Convention of 1912 has started the most widespread and serious\r\nmovement against extra-legal government that we have yet had. According\r\nto all the rules of astute politocratic management, the representatives\r\nof extra-legal government in that convention should have acquiesced\r\nin the selection of the most popular and prominent leader available,\r\nin spite of the fact of his independence. They should have driven\r\ninto power with him as many of their adherents as possible, or let\r\nhim go down to defeat. Whichever happened, extra-legal government, as\r\nconducted by means of the control of an extra-legal oligarchy over\r\nsuccessful candidates for office, would not have been disrupted and a\r\ngeneral movement inimical to the whole basis of extra-legal government\r\nwould have been averted. The revelation of the existence of a power\r\nin a few hands which could legally override popular desires in the\r\nselection of a candidate for the president of the United States, and\r\nthe exhibition of what, to a large number of people, must have seemed\r\nto be the actual exercise of such a power, and the defeat of the\r\npopular will clearly expressed could have only the result of launching\r\none of the greatest independent political movements of half a century,\r\nwith its principal attack upon extra-legal government as it has grown\r\nup in the United States. This is the same sort of mistake that the\r\nadvocates of slavery made when they underestimated the unexpressed\r\ndetermination of the North to preserve the Union.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, as many rival vote-directing organizations as\r\nthere are political parties which have become established and have a\r\nname with any good-will attached. If two of these organizations are at\r\nall well matched and occupy practically the entire field, their leaders\r\nfrequently make secret agreements according to which the governmental\r\npower is divided. One takes the city and the other the county, or one a\r\ngreat metropolitan district and the other the state. Such arrangements\r\nare preferred to a life-and-death struggle for supremacy. They result\r\nin a combination which it is exceedingly difficult for the politically\r\nignorant majority of the electorate to overcome.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, do not the people rule? Does not the power of\r\nsuch extra-legal government continue by their choice? Can they not\r\nsmash it if they choose? Theoretically, yes; practically, no! The\r\nextreme decentralization of the legal government--the success of the\r\nconstitution and laws in preventing the concentration of power at\r\nany one point in any one office in a legal government--is the very\r\nfoundation upon which the existence of the extra-legal government\r\nrests. It is also the chief reason for its continuance in power.\r\nThe paramount power of the electorate as a whole is broken into\r\ninfinitesimal fragments by the constitution and laws providing for a\r\nmultitude of independent offices to be filled by election. To turn\r\nout an extra-legal government which has filled practically all of\r\nthe offices in the legal government the electorate must be vigilant,\r\nactive, and successful, not in filling one office or a few offices at\r\na single election, but in the filling of a hundred offices voted for\r\nat all the elections occurring during a period of from four to eight\r\nyears. The extra-legal government stands as a solid, well-organized,\r\nsingle-headed army against a large but disorganized mass. The latter\r\nmay triumph at points or on occasions, but it will exhaust its\r\nstrength in comparatively small and unimportant victories. Coming\r\nto the voting booth constantly handicapped by the densest political\r\nignorance, without organization and without leaders, it falls again and\r\nagain before the trained and permanent feudal army of vote-directors.\r\nThere will be no serious danger to our extra-legal government from\r\nthe electorate as a whole while the officers of the legal government\r\nare shorn of power or the opportunity by combination to secure power\r\nand compelled to face constantly an electorate ignorant of their\r\npersonalities and their qualifications for office. It is one of the\r\nmaxims of modern warfare that the important thing is to destroy or\r\ndisrupt the opposing army--not merely to occupy a particular place\r\nor a particular territory. In the same way, in a war upon unpopular\r\ngovernment, it is important to destroy or disrupt it, not merely to\r\nfill a few offices, or even many offices, with good men who are opposed\r\nto an extra-legal government which still continues in existence, ready\r\nagain to seize the power of government when occasion offers. So long\r\nas the real government is in an extra-legal oligarchy at the head of a\r\nfeudal organization of vote-directors which remains unimpaired, while\r\nthe popular army occupies for the time being a few offices denuded\r\nof power, the campaign has accomplished next to nothing. In a few\r\nmore elections the extra-legal government will again have secured as\r\ncomplete control as before.\r\n\r\nEven when monarchy was absolute and a popular uprising overthrew it by\r\nmeans of a successful revolution, the ultimate result was merely to\r\nsubstitute a new absolute monarchy for the old one. So with us today,\r\nwhen one extra-legal government by politocrats is overthrown by the\r\nextraordinary and prolonged efforts of the electorate, nothing happens\r\nultimately but the substitution of a new extra-legal government for the\r\nold. The fact is that so long as we know of no other form of government\r\nexcept an absolute monarchy, or insist upon a plan of government\r\nwhich necessarily results in a decentralized legal government being\r\ncontrolled by a centralized extra-legal government of politocrats,\r\nwe shall never have any other form of government except a monarchy or\r\nan extra-legal politocracy. The tendency of the mass of the people to\r\nacquiesce in any governmental arrangement that they seem not to be\r\nable to escape from is a great asset to the maintenance of power by\r\nthe extra-legal government. If it takes a supreme effort for a number\r\nof years successively to oust a present extra-legal government, and\r\nwhen the result of so doing is merely to substitute another extra-legal\r\ngovernment of the same sort, what is the use of the extraordinary\r\neffort made? Why not advise the voter to concentrate his efforts\r\nfrom time to time in getting good men in the more important offices\r\nand letting the rest go? This attitude of mind becomes more and more\r\ncommon, especially among intelligent men who see the actual situation.\r\nIt is substantially a surrender of all the offices to the control of\r\nthe extra-legal government.\r\n\r\nSuch are the circumstances which a priori make the continuance of our\r\nextra-legal government, in the face of popular disapproval, probable.\r\nThe fact that it has and does now so continue is becoming every day\r\nmore apparent. Suppose, for instance, at any time in the last ten years\r\nthe direct issue could have been presented to the electorate whether\r\nthey preferred government by an extra-legal oligarchy of politocrats,\r\nsubject only indirectly and very slightly at any single election to the\r\nelectorate, or a legal government, subject directly to the will of the\r\nelectorate. Can there be any doubt that the great majority would vote\r\nthe extra-legal government out of power and abolish politocracy as they\r\nwould abolish absolute monarchy or a self-perpetuating oligarchy? If\r\nany demonstration of the temper of the electorate on such an issue be\r\nneeded, we have it in the steady popularity of all measures which have\r\nbeen put forward aimed at the so-called political bosses and government\r\nby them. Twenty-five years ago it was apparent to the electorate that\r\nthe ward boss in some districts of our larger cities maintained himself\r\nin part at least upon corrupt voting. Hence the Australian ballot.\r\nThen it was observed that political machines supported their workers\r\nby salaries from the public pay-rolls. Hence the civil service acts.\r\nThen the extra-legal government’s control over nominations seemed to\r\nbe the true source of its power. Hence the direct primary. It was also\r\nobserved that the extra-legal government had a grip on the state and\r\nmunicipal legislatures and the state and local executive offices and\r\nthe judges. Hence the initiative, the referendum, and the recall. It\r\nwas observed that the origin of the extra-legal government and the\r\ngreat source of its power came from the complexity of our municipal\r\ngovernments, their cumbersome administrative machinery, and the\r\nnumber of offices submitted to the electorate. Hence the movement\r\nfor the consolidation of municipal governments and their control by\r\na commission. It has been observed that the governor often expressed\r\nin a satisfactory manner the desires of a majority of the electorate,\r\nbut that he had no power to initiate legislation. Hence the two recent\r\nproposals that the governor’s bills be given the right of way upon\r\nthe legislative calendar so that they could be brought to a vote and\r\nnot quietly strangled by the crowding of the legislative docket and\r\nthe action of committees; and that the governor be allowed to submit\r\nfor approval by the electorate generally any bill presented to the\r\nlegislature and not passed by it.[5] The judges, especially those of\r\nthe Supreme Court, were observed to be declaring laws, in favor of\r\nwhich there was great popular sentiment, unconstitutional. The courts\r\nwere then at once placed by the electorate in the same camp with\r\nthe extra-legal government--quite unjustly perhaps--and the demand\r\narose for the recall of judges, or the recall of judicial decisions\r\non constitutional questions, or in any event the greatest possible\r\nrestriction upon the court’s power to declare acts of the legislature\r\nunconstitutional, or the elimination of that power altogether.\r\nFinally, we have had most recently a new national party, which has\r\nbeen dedicated in general to the war on extra-legal government and\r\nto a program of governmental reform believed to be inimical to its\r\nexistence. Every one of these movements upon analysis shows the\r\nelectorate conscious of the deprivation of its power to express its\r\nwill and to enforce responsibility to it from the officers of the legal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWe are obviously in the midst of a great effort to meet an overpowering\r\nextra-legal governmental force which has been depriving the electorate\r\nof its power and legitimate influence in the functioning of the legal\r\ngovernment. Such continued, increasingly aggressive, and always popular\r\nefforts to rid ourselves of extra-legal government by politocrats\r\npoints very clearly to the conclusion that our state and municipal\r\ngovernments have in a greater or less degree fallen into the hands of\r\nthat sort of government, and that it has been able for a generation,\r\nand is even now able, to maintain itself in the face of popular\r\ndisapproval. A practical, workable form of unpopular government has, in\r\nspite of the precautions taken to prevent it, been established in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] See frontispiece.\r\n\r\n[3] The ballot which the voter in Chicago faced at the same election\r\nwas even larger. It was 19 × 31 inches and presented elections to\r\n53 offices, exclusive of the presidential electors, and 267 names,\r\nexclusive of the presidential electors, to be voted upon. At the fall\r\nelection in Cook County in 1910 the ballot was 17 × 20 inches. It\r\npresented 52 offices to be filled and 190 candidates for the voter to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\n[4] In Illinois, for instance, the following state and local offices\r\nare provided for in the state constitution, protected by the state\r\nconstitution, and required by the constitution to be filled by\r\nelection: governor, lieutenant-governor, secretary of state, auditor of\r\npublic accounts, state treasurer, superintendent of public instruction,\r\nattorney-general, judge of the Supreme Court, clerk of the Supreme\r\nCourt; in counties outside of Cook County: the county judge, state’s\r\nattorney, sheriff, county clerk, treasurer, recorder, coroner, clerk\r\nof the Circuit Court, county superintendent of schools, judge of the\r\nProbate Court, judge of the Circuit Court; in Cook County: 15 county\r\ncommissioners, judge of the County Court, 14 judges of the Circuit\r\nCourt, 18 judges of the Superior Court, state’s attorney, recorder,\r\ncoroner, sheriff, county treasurer, county clerk, clerk of the Circuit\r\nCourt, clerk of the Superior Court, and county superintendent of\r\nschools. This includes all the state and local offices named in the\r\nlong ballot printed opposite p. 29, except 3 trustees for the state\r\nuniversity, 3 representatives in Congress, 1 member of the State Board\r\nof Equalization, 2 members of the Board of Assessors, 1 member of the\r\nBoard of Review, the county surveyor, and 3 trustees of the Sanitary\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\n[5] _Post_, chap. xv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE WAR ON POLITOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDISSIPATION OF POLITICAL IGNORANCE BY SELF-TAUGHT POLITICAL EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIf extra-legal unpopular government by politocrats rests upon a\r\ncondition of political ignorance on the part of the electorate, then\r\nit will be said that the obvious cure is to dissipate that ignorance\r\nby political education. It would not, however, be suggested that this\r\npolitical education be compulsory and at the expense of the state by\r\ncompetent teachers. That would irritate the electorate, be expensive,\r\nand probably end in the establishment of a state-paid boss. No! The\r\npolitical education of the voter must be self-taught. He must be\r\naroused to more knowledge and a more conscientious performance of\r\nhis political duties; more investigating of the qualifications of\r\ncandidates and greater efforts to secure the proper sort of candidates.\r\nHe must spend the time necessary to perform all his political duties\r\nand to do so intelligently enough to make an individual choice as to\r\nevery candidate for every office at every election.\r\n\r\nMany persons of intelligence will regard this as the only means of\r\nsuccessful assault and permanent overthrow of extra-legal and unpopular\r\ngovernment by politocrats. They are therefore content to sit still and\r\nawait the millennium of self-taught political education which will\r\nenlighten the voter. The difficulty is that dissipation of political\r\nignorance by such means will never occur. Since political education\r\nis not compulsory, we have to deal, not with the political knowledge\r\nwhich the voter might conceivably obtain, but that which he actually\r\nsecures. The fact is the electorate is the sole judge of how much work\r\nit will do in securing political knowledge and performing political\r\nduties. On occasions it may be aroused to an exceptional activity; on\r\nother occasions it may do nothing at all. Obviously then, in order to\r\nobtain the highest percentage of intelligent voting on an average it\r\nis necessary that the political duties of the electorate be adjusted\r\nto the amount of self-taught and self-acquired political education\r\nthat the electorate will generally and in the long run secure. If the\r\npolitical duties and education required are out of all proportion to\r\nwhat the electorate will obtain for itself, then political ignorance\r\nand neglect of political duties follows as a matter of course and is\r\na fixed and continuing condition. It is futile then to insist upon\r\nthe performance of duties which the electorate will not perform or\r\nthe attainment of a political education which the electorate will not\r\nsecure by its own efforts and which cannot be had in any other way.\r\nThe proper course is to readjust the political duties of the voter so\r\nthat what he is called upon to do he will accomplish with the minimum\r\namount of ignorance in view of the effort which he himself is likely to\r\ndevelop to inform himself and make an intelligent choice.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we find an extra-legal unpopular government by\r\npolitocrats established by reason of the long-continued and increasing\r\npolitical ignorance of the voters, who are on the whole an educated and\r\nintelligent class of citizens, the necessary inference is that the\r\npolitical duties of the voter and the requirements of self-obtained\r\npolitical education have been placed far beyond his willingness to\r\nperform, or perhaps even beyond the possibility of fulfilment by him.\r\nTo insist then upon self-taught political education which the voter has\r\nnot in the past and will not in the future and perhaps actually cannot\r\nsecure is to all practical intents and purposes to ignore utterly the\r\ncause which makes the existence of extra-legal unpopular government\r\nby politocrats permanent. It offers no means whatever for ridding\r\nourselves of such government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE AUSTRALIAN BALLOT AND CIVIL-SERVICE ACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the modern politocracy began with the ward boss in\r\ndistricts of our larger cities where voting was ignorant because the\r\npopulation was largely foreign, illiterate, and easily corrupted,\r\ncajoled, or frightened. The boss’s methods of carrying elections were\r\ncoarse. The business of vice and the activities of the underworld were\r\nprotected and the corrupt and illegal vote increased to the utmost.\r\nIndeed, to the average citizen and his leaders it seemed that the\r\npower of the boss rested mainly upon the corrupt and illegal vote.\r\nThey saw that the opportunity of securing this vote was large because\r\nof the loose method of conducting elections. At once advocacy of the\r\nAustralian ballot law became a part of the fight against the boss.\r\nVoters must be registered in advance of election day and opportunity\r\ngiven to challenge all voters so registered. The ballot must be\r\nsecret, so that the corrupter could never be sure that the bribed\r\ndelivered the vote which he had been paid for. The remedy proposed\r\nreceived an overwhelming popular approval a generation ago and\r\nelaborately drawn Australian ballot laws are now almost everywhere in\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Australian ballot laws were a needed and valuable reform\r\nindeed, but the power of the boss did not rest ultimately upon the\r\nillegal and corrupt vote. Fundamentally it depended upon the political\r\nignorance of the voter. The power of the ward boss not only survived\r\nthe Australian ballot laws, but it tended to increase with the spread\r\nof political ignorance on the part of the voter. Other bosses of a\r\ndifferent type sprang up and ruled in districts where the corrupt and\r\nillegal vote was negligible, but where political ignorance prevailed\r\namong an intelligent population. Then a hierarchy of bosses became\r\na machine and by means of the machine secured the control of the\r\ngovernmental power of a municipality.\r\n\r\nIn moments when the electorate turned its attention to the matter it\r\nobserved that the machine and its leaders practiced spoils politics on\r\na large scale. Its workers were being cared for by means of salaries\r\nfrom the public treasury. Efficiency in the service of the machine was\r\na more important qualification for office or employment than efficiency\r\nin the service of the municipality. Naturally the enemies of the\r\nextra-legal government began an agitation for civil-service acts which\r\nshould take the places in the public service out of politics--that\r\nis, out of the control of the politocrats. Government employees must\r\nbe appointed only from eligible lists made up by a civil-service\r\ncommission after holding an examination designed to test the efficiency\r\nof applicants. Once appointed from such a list, the appointee must\r\nbe protected in his position from a discharge based upon political\r\nreasons. The enemies of politocracy rallied to the support of the\r\ncivil-service acts and an appeal to the popular disapproval of the\r\nextra-legal government in general secured very widely the adoption of\r\ncivil-service principles.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the civil-service acts were necessary and valuable\r\nlegislation, but the power of the bosses did not rest fundamentally\r\nupon their ability to place their workers on the public pay-rolls any\r\nmore than it had rested upon the corrupt and illegal vote. The power\r\nof the extra-legal government still was predicated upon the political\r\nignorance of the voter. This cause not only lay undisturbed, but, with\r\nthe increase in the number of elective officers, and the multiplication\r\nof local governments operating in the same territory, each with a\r\ncorps of elective officers, it became more and more pronounced and\r\nwidespread. Even the most intelligent man became by an artificial\r\nprocess politically ignorant and befogged. Local bosses became more\r\nusual, less coarse in their methods, and more able. Combinations\r\nof bosses secured more governmental power in widening areas of\r\ngovernmental control.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nALTRUISTIC EFFORTS TO ENLIGHTEN THE VOTER\r\n\r\n\r\nA few astute friends of the electorate have perceived that the power\r\nof the extra-legal politocracy rested fundamentally upon the political\r\nignorance of the voter, especially the political ignorance of the voter\r\nwho was an intelligent man and who could render a valuable judgment if\r\nhe could have the facts. This idea produced the Independent Voters’\r\nLeague, which through a small executive committee undertakes to gather\r\nfacts and give out information to the voters about candidates for\r\noffice. The electorate, of course, should be given information about\r\nall candidates in every election. But such a task is too large and (if\r\nindeed it be possible at all) would require more money than could be\r\nraised by subscription from a comparatively few people. These leagues\r\ntherefore, when formed, have devoted all their energies to giving the\r\nvoter information about the candidates for a single office. Thus in\r\nChicago the Municipal Voters’ League informs the electorate in each\r\nward of the city about the candidates for aldermen and those alone. The\r\nIllinois Legislative Voters’ League gives out information concerning\r\ncandidates for the state legislature.\r\n\r\nIt has been noticeable that of the two the Municipal Voters’ League\r\nhas been the more effective. This is due in part at least to the fact\r\nthat at the Chicago aldermanic elections the ballot is very short. In\r\nmany elections the candidates for the aldermanic office and those alone\r\nappear upon the ballot. Thus the voter’s attention is concentrated upon\r\nthe candidate for a single office from a single district. The advice\r\nof the league is, therefore, more easily noted and remembered. On the\r\nother hand, the Legislative Voters’ League attempts to advise the voter\r\nat an election at which are filled state, county, and judicial offices.\r\nThe length of the ballot and the number of offices to be filled has\r\nalready been indicated by the specimen ballot printed, _ante_, opposite\r\np. 29. Naturally the advice is lost in the babel of voices which\r\ngoes up concerning the candidates for the important local, state, and\r\nnational offices to be filled.\r\n\r\nThe bar primaries as they have been held in Chicago are the weakest\r\nof all these altruistic efforts to inform the voter how to vote. Such\r\nprimaries are merely the expression of preferences by the lawyers of\r\nCook County with respect to the candidates for judicial office. They do\r\nnot characterize any candidate or give any facts concerning his record.\r\nNor is any effort made to promote the election of the men approved at\r\nsuch bar primary. Where a large number of judges are to be selected\r\nby an electorate of several hundred thousand, the bar primary is very\r\nweak indeed in its function of giving information to the politically\r\nignorant voter.\r\n\r\nPractical experience would seem to indicate that altruistic efforts to\r\nenlighten the political ignorance of the voter who is an intelligent\r\nman, to be effective at all, must consist of non-partisan, direct, and\r\npersonal criticisms of candidates’ qualifications and records. Even\r\nthen not much can be done unless the election is for a single important\r\noffice and the election district is wieldy[6] in size. Whenever the\r\ncandidates about whom the voter is to be informed are only four or five\r\nout of two or three hundred running for fifty different offices, the\r\ninformation and criticism lose much of their force. If the altruistic\r\neffort were directed toward informing the electorate about candidates\r\nfor unimportant and inconspicuous offices, not only would funds fail to\r\nbe forthcoming, but its voice would be unheeded and unheard. Thus the\r\nlimitations upon the effectiveness of the efforts of altruistic voters’\r\nleagues are very definitely fixed.\r\n\r\nOf course, newspapers wield a great influence in elections, even when\r\npartisan in the dissemination of news regarding candidates and in their\r\ncomments upon the news. But this exhibition of partisanship occurs\r\nlargely with reference to the head of the ticket or to candidates\r\nfor two or three of the most important offices. The influence of a\r\nnewspaper in advising and directing the voter how to vote when he\r\nis ignorant of the qualifications of the candidates and has heard\r\nno public discussion in regard to them, depends upon much the same\r\nconsiderations as does the influence of the altruistic voters’\r\nleague. To be an effective adviser to the voter as to candidates for\r\nsubordinate offices, about whom there is no public discussion, a\r\nnewspaper must be to some extent at least non-partisan. It must be\r\ndirect and explicit in its recommendations and characterization of the\r\ncandidates. It must concentrate its efforts on some one point in the\r\nballot and let everything else go. These rules are as a matter of fact\r\nregularly observed by newspapers. The practice of them very much limits\r\nthe actual scope of a newspaper’s power as an adviser and director of\r\nthe politically ignorant voter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] I.e., “one not so large but that the candidate who is willing to\r\nrun may be known with a fair degree of ease by the electorate and be\r\nable with the least expense to make a personal canvass” (see chap. xii,\r\np. 148).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nABOLITION OF THE PARTY CIRCLE AND PARTY COLUMN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a rough way it has long been perceived that the party circle and\r\nparty column on ballots are a vital part of the machinery necessary\r\nto direct the politically ignorant voter how to vote. If the voter is\r\nnot only politically ignorant but also illiterate, the party circle\r\nis about all he can use, and only by directing his attention to that\r\ncan he be told what to do. If the politically ignorant voter is an\r\nintelligent man he needs the party column at least so that he may\r\ntake its suggestion when he attempts to vote for candidates about\r\nwhom he knows nothing. It is not strange, therefore, that, in the\r\nwar on politocracy, the abolition of both the party circle and the\r\nparty column have been proposed. The more remarkable fact is that\r\nsuch a proposal has received so little support. The fact is that with\r\nour long ballots the abolition of the party circle and the party\r\ncolumn would result either in a clumsy restoration of the party column\r\nby the furnishing of party lists to the individual voter, or else\r\nin a disfranchisement of the voter so startling and complete, and a\r\ngovernmental chaos so much more inimical to good government than the\r\nextra-legal politocracy, that popular support for such a movement has\r\nbeen generally withheld.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPECIMEN BALLOT. 10th Congressional, 7th Senatorial\r\nDistrict.]\r\n\r\nImagine, for instance, the party circle and party column abolished\r\nfor the state and local offices on the long ballot in Cook County\r\nreproduced, _ante_, opposite p. 29. We should then have a ballot with a\r\nsingle column to fill 34 offices, with 181 candidates, the Republican,\r\nDemocratic, Prohibitionist, Socialist, Social Labor, and Progressive,\r\nall lumped together. The large majority of voters could not rely upon\r\ntheir own knowledge of the candidates to make an intelligent choice.\r\nThe burden upon the voter is too great. If the electorate voted at\r\nrandom there would arise a political chaos in officeholding. The voter\r\nwould be least likely to do this. If the voter felt he could not vote\r\nat all he would be plainly and utterly disfranchised. The voter would\r\nundoubtedly enter the voting booth with a party list in his hand as the\r\nmost rational method of securing advice as to whom to vote for. That\r\nwould be in effect a restoration of the party column which had been\r\nabolished. No wonder then that popular sentiment cannot be aroused over\r\nthe general abolition of the party circle and the party column where\r\nthe excessively long ballot is placed before large numbers of voters at\r\nfrequent intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMARIES\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the first appearance of the professional adviser and director to\r\nthe politically ignorant voter he became a power in the presentation\r\nof candidates for election. It was indeed an essential part of his\r\nbusiness in advising the voter how to vote that he should furnish\r\nhim with a candidate for whom the adviser and director could vouch.\r\nAt first the adviser and director of the politically ignorant voter\r\nnamed only candidates in the smallest governmental districts. But as\r\nthe power and influence of the vote-directing organization spread to\r\nlarger and more important governmental areas its leaders continued to\r\ncontrol the nomination of candidates for office. At first the friends\r\nof the electorate sought to meet the formidable advantage which the\r\nvote-directing organization possessed by reason of its power to\r\ncontrol party nominations by laws which permitted the nomination of\r\nindependent candidates by petition. Of course, if the law provided\r\nthat no candidate should appear on more than one ticket, independent\r\nnominations were likely to be very much discouraged. But even when the\r\nelection laws were most liberal in permitting independent nominations,\r\nthe vote-directing organizations were still able to hold the field\r\nagainst all but the most violent and revolutionary independent\r\nmovements. In short, unpopular government by politocrats was still\r\nreasonably safe.\r\n\r\nThere were two reasons for this. In the first place, the vote-directing\r\norganization exists and prevails because the voter is ignorant with\r\nrespect to the personality and qualifications of candidates for\r\noffice. He must be advised and directed how to vote. The independent\r\nmovement simply matches the strength of a temporary and sporadic\r\neffort to advise and direct the unorganized and inflamed but still\r\nignorant voter how to vote, against a permanent and well-organized\r\nvote-directing machine. In the long run the latter will prevail.\r\nSecondly, the permanent organization for directing and advising the\r\npolitically ignorant voter has always secured possession of a revered\r\nparty name. This has heretofore given it an overwhelming advantage. It\r\nmakes every independent an apostate of some party. So great has been\r\nthe good-will of the two principal national parties in the last fifty\r\nyears that independent movements have been confined largely to local\r\nelections, and even then it is difficult to obtain candidates because\r\nof the fear of party irregularity. Of these two reasons clearly the\r\nformer is the more important. The two principal national parties of the\r\nlast half-century might cease, but if the voter remained politically\r\nignorant as before, extra-legal government would still go on. On the\r\nother hand, if the voter could be made politically intelligent at all\r\nelections and in filling all offices from the candidates presented,\r\nthen extra-legal government would have to go and party names would not\r\nmilitate seriously against independent movements.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, when the friends of the electorate came to appreciate\r\nthe failure of independent movements to make headway against the\r\nextra-legal government they did not plan to attack the fundamental\r\ndifficulty of enlightening the voter’s political ignorance. Instead,\r\nthey did as they had done before and sought a cure by attempting\r\nto eliminate the superficial and obvious cause. Mr. La Follette in\r\nWisconsin thought that he could have no political success unless he\r\ncontinued to be a member of the Republican party. As matters stood,\r\nhowever, he could not obtain the nomination from that party because\r\nit was controlled by men who did not want him in office. Yet Mr. La\r\nFollette was more popular with the electorate who usually voted the\r\nRepublican ticket than were the gentlemen who controlled the use of\r\nthe party name. The obvious move for Mr. La Follette was to take the\r\ncontrol of the party name from those who held it. This he did by\r\nmeans of legislation which permitted any candidate who could secure a\r\nplurality of votes of the Republican party voters at a primary election\r\nto use the Republican party name in the election for the office.\r\nThis was merely a legal and orderly way of depriving an extra-legal\r\ngovernment of the advantage of using a revered and popular party name.\r\nThat is the proper function of a primary election law.\r\n\r\nThe availability of the primaries might, of course, have been limited\r\nto situations such as Mr. La Follette created in the Republican party\r\nin Wisconsin--namely, when an independent in the party wished to\r\nwrest the control of the party name from an extra-legal government\r\nwhich had lost the confidence of the party electorate. If so limited\r\nits use would practically have been confined to the occasions when\r\na well-organized revolt was in progress against the wing of a party\r\nin control of the party name. Such occasions would be infrequent\r\nbecause such revolts are infrequent. Extra-legal government having\r\nbecome established and having obtained control of the party name,\r\nthe tendency would be to let the matter alone. Small uprisings in\r\nregard to nominations for some particular office might occur, but a\r\nwell-organized, persistent, and ably led revolt such as Mr. La Follette\r\nhas conducted in Wisconsin is the event of a generation. Illinois, and\r\nno doubt many other states, are just as much in need of the leadership\r\nof a man like Mr. La Follette as Wisconsin. But no such leader appears.\r\nNone seems likely to appear. Our state lines have very effectively\r\nexcluded Mr. La Follette’s efforts from every state in the Union except\r\nhis own. The use of the primary as a means of permanently and wholly\r\ndepriving an extra-legal government of its power to control the use of\r\na party name must be regarded as unusual and extraordinary and not at\r\nall likely to occur.\r\n\r\nThe use of primaries, however, has not been limited to occasions\r\nwhen an organized attempt has been made to deprive the minority of\r\na party of the use of the party name. Instead, primaries have been\r\nmade compulsory and applied to the nomination of practically all\r\nelective officers. They must be gone through with, although there is no\r\norganized revolt against the usual nominating authority. This extreme\r\napplication of the primaries has been justified on the ground that\r\nthe holding of primaries would operate automatically and regularly\r\non all occasions to rid the electorate of control of the extra-legal\r\ngovernment. Again, we have had a popular application of the theory that\r\nthe cure for the ills of democracy is more democracy. If the number of\r\nappeals to the electorate which we had before the primaries did not do\r\nany good, we must have double the number of appeals. The futility of\r\nthis course will be observed no more clearly than in the operation of\r\nthe universal and compulsory primary.\r\n\r\nUnder the usual circumstances of normal conditions, when no organized\r\nrevolt is being led against it, the extra-legal government will as\r\neffectively control the results at primaries as it does results at\r\nelections themselves. The permanent organization of advisers and\r\ndirectors to the politically ignorant voter will, of course, have a\r\nslate of candidates for nomination, just as it provided a slate of\r\nnominees under the convention system. There may be some independent\r\ncandidates for nominations. Most frequently, however, these are obscure\r\nindividuals who try for a nomination on the theory that they are no\r\nmore unknown than the slate candidates. The voter’s burden has been\r\ndoubled. Consequently his political ignorance, both at the primary\r\nelection for candidates and at the election itself, is probably greater\r\nthan it was at the election for office alone. At all events, the\r\nvoter comes to the primaries (if he comes at all) just as ignorant\r\nof the personality and qualifications of candidates for nomination\r\nas he formerly did of the candidates for office. His ignorance may\r\nbe so apparent that he does not vote at all. Perhaps he votes only\r\nfor a few names that he happens to recognize. In either case his vote\r\nis negligible. The effective voter at the primaries is the one who\r\nvotes for candidates for all places. He must, however, as a result\r\nof his dense political ignorance, vote the way he is told. As usual\r\nthe most effective force for telling him how to vote is the permanent\r\norganization of advisers and directors to the politically ignorant\r\nvoter. It is that organization which will most often carry the primary\r\nelection which nominates candidates for most of the offices. In short,\r\nthe extra-legal government will influence and control the results\r\nof the ordinary primary just as it has influenced and controlled the\r\nresults of ordinary elections. It is only in the language of the stump\r\nthat the primaries enable the people to nominate. While an extra-legal\r\ngovernment exists the people can no more nominate at primaries than\r\nthey can choose at elections. Such precisely has been the experience\r\nin Cook County, Illinois. There, from the time the primaries first\r\nwent into effect, the leaders of the two principal vote-directing\r\norganizations have made slates more or less secretly, secured the most\r\nfavorable position for the slate on the primary ballot, pushed the\r\nslate at the primaries, and obtained the nomination in practically\r\nevery case of the slate candidates. In primary elections we have an\r\nappeal to voters on matters apparently less important and conspicuous\r\nthan the filling of the offices themselves. If the vote-directing\r\norganization can in the long run control elections to a majority of the\r\noffices, it can certainly in the long run control the nominations for\r\nthose offices at the primary election.\r\n\r\nWe must not overlook one great advantage to the extra-legal government\r\nin making nominations at primaries instead of at conventions. In the\r\nconvention the leaders of the extra-legal government were so openly\r\nand publicly the makers of nominations that they were in a degree\r\nresponsible. They had to consider very carefully the popular temper\r\nin giving each candidate a place on the ballot. Under the primaries,\r\nhowever, the result is, in the language of the stump, “the judgment\r\nof the people.” If, therefore, any black sheep slip into nominations\r\nfor obscure places it is the fault of the people, just as it used to\r\nbe the fault of the people when bad men were elected to office. The\r\npopular demand, however, for primaries is a confession that elections\r\ndid not produce the choice of the people. Before long, experience with\r\nuniversal and compulsory primaries to make nominations for long ballots\r\nwill indicate that they do not produce nominations by the people.\r\n\r\nNot only is the compulsory primary for all elective offices entirely\r\nineffective to break up the power of the extra-legal government to\r\ndirect the nomination of its loyal adherents, but in the long run\r\nits presence exaggerates the very condition which necessarily causes\r\nthe existence of a centralized extra-legal government controlling\r\na decentralized legal government. That condition is the burden of\r\npolitical duties cast upon the voter which he will not and very likely\r\ncannot possibly carry. It is that which makes him politically ignorant\r\nand forces him to fall back upon the assistance of the professional\r\npolitical adviser. When the primaries double the burden on the voter\r\nthey increase twofold the necessity for permanent organizations for\r\ndirecting and advising the politically ignorant voter how to vote.\r\nConsequently, so far from disrupting an extra-legal government, the\r\nuniversal and compulsory primary makes its continued existence even\r\nmore certain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE INITIATIVE AND THE REFERENDUM\r\n\r\n\r\nNicholas Longworth, when congratulated on his election to Congress,\r\nis reported to have said: “Election! I wasn’t elected; I was\r\nappointed.”[7] This contains a very real truth. As the power of the\r\nextra-legal government has increased it has gained a large and in\r\nsome instances predominant influence in our legislative bodies and\r\nparticularly the state legislatures, through its power to appoint\r\nmembers who would be loyal to it. Once obtained this influence may be\r\nused to protect certain interests from legislation which they do not\r\nwant, but for which there may be a proper popular demand. It may be\r\nused also to promote legislation which the electorate is against or\r\nwould be against if it understood the situation. When such a condition\r\nof affairs exists and becomes widely known, we have a demand for the\r\ninitiative to compel the enactment of laws which the majority of the\r\nelectorate wants but which the legislature will not pass. We have also\r\na demand for the referendum to veto acts which the legislature has\r\npassed but which the majority of the electorate does not want.\r\n\r\nOf course, in extraordinary and unusual situations, when the electorate\r\nis organized and led against some attempted act of the extra-legal\r\ngovernment, the initiative and referendum may be used to defeat and\r\ndiscomfort the latter. But that is not a normal situation. It is the\r\nextraordinary and unusual occurrence. The real effect of the initiative\r\nand the referendum on the extra-legal government cannot be determined\r\nwith reference to abnormal circumstances. It must be looked at in\r\nconnection with normal everyday events. The usual and normal situation\r\nis that of political quiet. The extra-legal government governs from\r\nday to day and from election to election. The placing on the ballot\r\nat any election of a number of acts to be initiated or approved on a\r\nreferendum adds more burdens to the already greatly overloaded voter.\r\nHe must now read over the acts, study their details, and understand the\r\nultimate effect or possibilities of certain clauses. The legislation to\r\nbe considered by the voter may be of relatively small importance to the\r\nmajority of the voters, or the desire of the majority for the general\r\nobject may be so great that the means are not to be considered. The\r\nballot may contain counter propositions and additional acts upon the\r\nsame subject. Some reformers might present one act and the extra-legal\r\ngovernment another on the same subject. When these occasions arise,\r\none thing we may be certain of: the average voter will be most densely\r\nignorant of what it is all about. Who, then, in the usual case will\r\nhave the privilege of directing him how to vote? Why, of course,\r\nthe same organization that directs the voter regularly how to cast\r\nhis ballot for candidates for office. The power of the extra-legal\r\ngovernment to advise and direct the politically ignorant voter how\r\nto vote will be just as effective in the normal election to carry or\r\ndefeat an act on an initiative or referendum as it is to place men\r\nloyal to it in the offices of the legal government.\r\n\r\nThe initiative and the referendum, then, while they may at times give\r\nthe righteous a desirable advantage, will in normal conditions place in\r\nthe hands of the extra-legal government the opportunity to secure the\r\npassage of undesirable laws or to defeat good ones and to insist for a\r\ntime at least that this is “the judgment of the people”; just as for\r\nyears they have declared that when the system of frequent elections for\r\nmany offices produced undesirable officeholders, it was the result of\r\nthe will of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] George Kibbe Turner, “The Thing above the Law,” _McClure’s\r\nMagazine_, XXXVIII, 575.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE RECALL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has been said of the initiative and the referendum is almost\r\nprecisely applicable to the recall.\r\n\r\nThe movement for the recall began just as soon as it was generally\r\nperceived that our system of frequent elections to fill a large number\r\nof offices did not prevent the extra-legal government from placing in\r\noffice men loyal to it. The movement for the recall is the frankest\r\nadmission that this system of elections has been a failure. The real\r\ncause for this failure was the fact that too much voting had overloaded\r\nthe voter and his resulting political ignorance had delivered him into\r\nthe hands of an organization which in effect cast his ballot for him.\r\nAgain, however, this was entirely neglected, and the superficial and\r\nobvious remedy was put forward of having a new election whenever it\r\nwas discovered that an officeholder was objectionable because of his\r\nsubservience to an extra-legal government. The statutes, however, do\r\nnot undertake to submit to the electorate the question whether the\r\nofficers subject to the recall elections have been too subservient to\r\nthe extra-legal government and that alone. Instead, the voters may cast\r\ntheir votes for the recall of an officer on any ground they please.\r\n\r\nIf there is an organized and effectively led revolt against extra-legal\r\ngovernment, then obviously the weapon of the recall may be of great\r\nservice. It will enable the attacking party to sweep out of office\r\nadherents of the extra-legal government who would otherwise have held\r\nuntil the next election, when the tide of popular sentiment in favor\r\nof the attack might have begun to ebb. But revolts are not at all\r\nfrequent. There has always been an opportunity at regular elections for\r\nsuch movements through independent nominations by petition. A revolt\r\nof any consequence would have undertaken to use this method. In spite,\r\nhowever, of the opportunity thus afforded, the general revolt against\r\nextra-legal government in local districts is the occurrence of a\r\ndecade, if not of a generation.\r\n\r\nIt is the effect of the recall under normal circumstances, when no\r\nrevolt against extra-legal government is in progress, that must\r\nprincipally concern us. At such times the recall is more valuable to\r\nthe extra-legal government than it is to the electorate at large.\r\nThe recall is as available to the extra-legal government as it is to\r\nthe electorate at large. In fact, the extra-legal government must of\r\nnecessity become familiar with its use. Every officer of the dummy\r\nlegal government must, therefore, at all times act with the knowledge\r\nthat the extra-legal government may start a recall election against\r\nhim. Imagine what this means to the host of subordinate officers that\r\nwere put in apparently by the electorate, but of whom the electorate\r\nnever had any knowledge whatever. They have no popular following.\r\nThey have no money with which to advise and instruct the voters of\r\nthe character of the fight that is being made against them. What\r\npossible chance would such officeholders stand against the permanent\r\norganization of advisers and directors to the ignorant voter which the\r\nextra-legal government controls? The recall under normal, everyday\r\nconditions would place the majority of officeholders even more\r\ncompletely in the control of the extra-legal government than they are\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe recall, if applied to the judiciary, would in usual and normal\r\ntimes operate to give the extra-legal government the same power over\r\nthe judges that it would have over other officeholders.[8] A judge\r\nis one of the most helpless of all elective officers. He can run\r\non no platform; he can have no political program. He cannot point\r\ndramatically to any achievements on behalf of the people. Whether\r\nhe is a good judge or not is a matter of expert opinion that only a\r\ncomparatively few persons are competent to pass upon. His reputation\r\ncan be easily blasted by the circulation of false statements. He may\r\neven be hurt by the performance of his duty in a particular case. His\r\nretention in office at elections is in a great number of instances\r\npurely a matter of accident. If he is up at a fall presidential\r\nelection, his retention in office will practically depend upon the\r\nsuccess of the national party in whose column his name happens to be.\r\nIt will make little difference whether he has been one of the best\r\njudges that the county or state has ever had, or one of the worst.\r\nElections place the judge very largely at the mercy of the extra-legal\r\ngovernment. That government may not be able to return him to office,\r\nbut the judge knows that without its support his re-election will\r\nbecome practically impossible. To give the extra-legal government the\r\nopportunity to use the recall upon a judge is to hold above the judge’s\r\nhead at all times the threat of an extra election which he is in no\r\nwise prepared to undergo. Nothing could more clearly increase the power\r\nof the extra-legal government over the judiciary. If the recall of\r\njudges be advocated on the ground that they have become subservient to\r\nthe politocrats, the conditions which have caused them to become so\r\nwill have been greatly increased by the very device which is advocated\r\nas a means of ridding us of that subserviency.\r\n\r\nWe may conclude, therefore, that there is no more danger to extra-legal\r\ngovernment in the recall than there is in frequent elections and\r\nindependent nominations by petition. On the other hand, the free use,\r\nor freely threatened use, of the recall by the extra-legal government\r\nwill give it a power over officeholders and judges greater than that\r\nwhich it now has.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] See _post_, chap. xvii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENT MOVEMENTS AND THE NEW PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nIndependent movements have been launched in different localities\r\nfrom time to time. These have been prompted by the too open and too\r\nviolently selfish use of power by the extra-legal government. They\r\nhave often been temporarily successful. But they have been available\r\nonly upon extraordinary occasions and have proved of merely temporary\r\neffect. In the first place they did not develop any organization\r\nof professional advisers and directors to the politically ignorant\r\nvoter. They did not continuously put forth the effort to establish a\r\ncentralized extra-legal government which the condition of decentralized\r\nlegal government demanded. Secondly, the independent movement suffered\r\nunder the disadvantage of operating in opposition to the candidates of\r\nthe two great historical parties--the Democratic and the Republican.\r\nThis was an almost insuperable obstacle when the local, state and\r\nnational elections were held together.\r\n\r\nOne of the important independent movements of the last fifty years is\r\nthat which brought into existence the Progressive party. The spark\r\nwhich touched this off was what appeared to a large number of voters to\r\nbe the refusal of those who legally controlled the Republican National\r\nConvention to make a nomination for president of the United States\r\nin accordance with the express wishes of a majority of the rank and\r\nfile of the party. It was in effect an exhibition of the arbitrary\r\naction of the minority in refusing to carry out the expressed will\r\nof the majority. Those legally in control of the convention were\r\nsupported principally by the delegates who had been sent as the result\r\nof the action of local political organizations in the states where\r\nno primaries had been held. Those who did not legally control the\r\nconvention were supported by the delegates who were directed by the\r\nmajority of the party electorate actually voting in the primaries, to\r\nnominate Mr. Roosevelt. In short, a great independent revolt had been\r\nstarted in the Republican party at the primaries. In the convention\r\nthe popular will was directly matched against the forces, similar in\r\nappearance, if not in fact the same, to those of the usual extra-legal\r\ngovernment. Naturally the efforts of the new party have been expressly\r\ndedicated to the disrupting of extra-legal government in this country.\r\nFor the first time a national party has begun to proclaim the fact that\r\nextra-legal government does exist; that it can maintain and exercise\r\nits power against the will of a majority, and that it must be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThese utterances are of enormous value, but when we look at the\r\nplatform of the new party for the ways and means of accomplishing\r\nthe result the outlook is not encouraging. We find the new party\r\napproving of the primaries, the initiative, the referendum, and the\r\nrecall of officers other than judges. These proposals, as we have\r\nalready analyzed them, hold out no promise of permanently disrupting\r\nextra-legal government. It is true the short ballot is advocated,\r\nbut as yet there seems to be no clear perception of the connection\r\nbetween the long ballot, the decentralization of governmental power,\r\nthe political ignorance of the voter even when he is an intelligent\r\nman, and the rise and permanent acquisition of governmental power by\r\nthe extra-legal government. The short ballot seems to be included in\r\nthe Progressive party’s platform, not because it embodies a theory\r\nof government which is entirely opposed to that upon which our state\r\ngovernments were founded and have been developed, but because it is\r\none of several panaceas and because of its superficial and obvious\r\nappeal. The Progressive party does not reveal itself as yet ready to\r\nassume a theory of government which lies at the basis of the short\r\nballot and which insists upon the centralization of governmental power\r\nexercised in subordination to the popular will, as distinguished from\r\nthe decentralization of governmental power exercised in subordination\r\nto the influence of an extra-legal government not readily answerable to\r\nthe popular will.\r\n\r\nIf our state governments remain as they are with only such alterations\r\nas come from a shorter ballot, the primary, the initiative, the\r\nreferendum, and the recall, extra-legal government will not be\r\neliminated. The Progressive party must then either cease to exist,\r\nas so many other lesser independent movements have done, or it must\r\nacquire an organization precisely such as the old parties have had.\r\nIt must acquire the same multitude of legal vote-directing machines,\r\nthe same feudal hierarchy of politocrats, and by this means establish\r\nan extra-legal centralized government to run the decentralized legal\r\ngovernment. Whichever happens, the new party, as the champion of the\r\npower of the electorate against the power of the politocrats, will\r\nhave failed. The new party is indeed doomed to failure unless it\r\ncan so change our theory of government and induce the making of new\r\ngovernmental arrangements pursuant to that theory, that extra-legal\r\ngovernment on its present grand scale will no longer be possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE SECURITY OF EXTRA-LEGAL UNPOPULAR GOVERNMENT BY POLITOCRATS IN THE\r\nUNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\nExtra-legal unpopular government rests fundamentally upon the fact that\r\na few are able to cast the ballots of the voters for them. This is\r\naccomplished through the process of advising and directing the voter\r\nhow to vote. The opportunity to do this at all is presented whenever\r\nthe voter is politically ignorant and still insists upon voting with\r\nan apparent show of intelligence. The opportunity to advise and direct\r\nthe voter how to vote is presented on a large scale when the entire\r\nelectorate, no matter what its average intelligence may be, is made\r\npolitically ignorant concerning a majority of the candidates for\r\noffice. The decentralization of governmental power, as manifested in\r\nthe multiplication of elective offices and the frequency of elections,\r\nhas placed upon the voter--even when he is a most intelligent man--a\r\nburden which he does not and practically cannot carry. He therefore\r\ngoes to the polls politically ignorant and the essential condition\r\nis presented upon which the rise and establishment of an extra-legal\r\nunpopular government rests. It may be observed, therefore, of all\r\nefforts to disrupt and destroy a system of extra-legal unpopular\r\ngovernment, that so long as the assault upon it consists of a more\r\nfrequent appeal to the electorate on occasions of ever-lessening\r\nimportance, the more the assault will in reality contribute to the\r\ncondition which makes the existence of some extra-legal government\r\nunassailable.\r\n\r\nThe growth and security of extra-legal unpopular government rests\r\nupon the increase of the political burdens upon the voter. Every\r\npolitical theory, every governmental bogey, and every practical\r\ninnovation which tends toward the multiplication of elective offices,\r\nthe frequency of elections and the consequent decentralization of the\r\npower of government, whether state or local, must be advocated and\r\nencouraged by the politocrat. Every effort must be made by him to\r\nfoster and maintain the popular conviction that the centralization and\r\nconcentration of governmental power in the hands of a few, even though\r\nthose few hold office as a whole at the mere whim and pleasure of a\r\nmajority of the electorate, is the real basis of unpopular government\r\nand inimical to free institutions. He must make every effort to foster\r\nand maintain the popular conviction that the only hope of popular\r\ngovernment and free institutions lies in as many appeals to the\r\nelectorate on as many occasions as possible. This idea may be conveyed\r\nin convincing and epigrammatical form by repeating the wisdom that the\r\ncure for the ills of democracy is more democracy. The electorate should\r\nnever be allowed to forget that by reason of the constant appeals to\r\nthem they are ruling, and that whatever happens they are responsible.\r\n\r\nIn short, the security of unpopular government lies in the maintaining\r\nof the popular conviction that our present constitution and laws are\r\nsound. The bulwark of unpopular government in the United States today\r\nis the man who believes that our institutions are fundamentally\r\nsatisfactory; that in the main our scheme of government is the best\r\nthat was ever devised or can be devised; that it is the fault of the\r\nelectorate that bad men are in office; that the electorate at the last\r\nelection put the machine out of business, or came near it, and is going\r\nto do better the next time; that if the machine is not disrupted,\r\nthen the people themselves are at fault and richly deserve what they\r\nget; that if any improvements are needed they will be found in the\r\nmore frequent appeals to the electorate through such devices as the\r\nprimaries, the initiative, the referendum, and the recall. Extra-legal\r\nunpopular government must encourage men of this stamp and teach these\r\nfundamental principles to its supporters. While such men represent the\r\nviews of the masses extra-legal unpopular government will be safe.\r\n\r\nUnpopular government in the United States will be secure until our\r\npresent popular convictions about the science of government are\r\nreversed and popular and persistent opinions prevail that the ability\r\nof the electorate to vote intelligently is limited; that the moment the\r\nvoter is called upon to fill any other than a few offices which wield\r\ngreat power and are therefore conspicuous and important, he becomes\r\npolitically ignorant, even though he be an unusually intelligent man;\r\nthat it makes no difference that this may be his fault, for the fact\r\nremains and will remain; that it is this artificially stimulated\r\npolitical ignorance of the voter that delivers his vote to a permanent\r\norganization maintained for the purpose of directing him how to vote;\r\nthat to prevent this artificially stimulated political ignorance on the\r\npart of the voter he must be called upon to exercise such a limited\r\nvoting power as he is able to use with intelligence. This means that\r\nthe power of government must be centralized and concentrated in the\r\nhands of a few officeholders of the legal government who are prevented\r\nfrom perpetuating their power and so establishing an unpopular\r\ngovernment by being at all times subject to be ousted or kept in\r\noffice at the pleasure of the majority of the electorate. The moment\r\nthe real government, be it legal or extra-legal, can be swept out of\r\noffice as a whole at a popular election easily initiated, which makes\r\nthe existence and action of the real government a direct issue, the\r\nmost effective means yet devised for preventing a real government from\r\nbecoming unpopular--i.e., maintaining the selfish exercise of power in\r\nthe face of popular disapproval--has been found. When these principles\r\nof government are received by the masses with the same conviction\r\nthat they now support the theory of government that a minimum amount\r\nof power should reside in any one officer or department of the legal\r\ngovernment and that appeals to the electorate should be upon as many\r\nmatters and as often as possible, the downfall of extra-legal unpopular\r\ngovernment will be imminent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE MENACE TO UNPOPULAR GOVERNMENT OF THE COMMISSION FORM OF GOVERNMENT\r\nFOR SMALLER CITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took a flood and a hurricane which overwhelmed a prosperous city to\r\nreverse the popular convictions which lie at the basis of government\r\nin the United States. In 1900 Galveston was all but destroyed by the\r\nwaters of the Gulf rising during a hurricane. Confronted with a great\r\nemergency in which quick and efficient action was imperative if the\r\ncity was to be restored at all, the people abandoned the fear of kings\r\nand of centralized governmental power. The entire municipal power of\r\ngovernment, executive and legislative, was vested in a single board of\r\nfive commissioners. These were both the legislature and the executive.\r\nThey made the ordinances and wielded the executive power through\r\nsubordinate officers appointed by them. The governmental principle\r\nwhich was thus applied in the commission plan is the concentration\r\nof governmental power by the union of the legislative and executive\r\nfunctions of government in the hands of a few[9] who are controlled\r\nand prevented from becoming an unpopular government because they are\r\nsubject to the electorate through elections at frequent intervals. The\r\noffice of commissioner was made conspicuous and elections interesting.\r\nThe population of Galveston was about 40,000. Hence the entire city was\r\nnot so large but that a candidate might be personally known with a fair\r\ndegree of ease by the electorate, and with the least possible expense\r\nmake a personal canvass. It was, in short, a wieldy district. Hence\r\nthe coming forward of candidates was increased to the maximum, and the\r\nneed for a vote-directing machine practically eliminated. The maximum\r\namount of thought and intelligence was obtained from the voter because\r\nhis attention was concentrated on filling a few important offices.\r\nExcessive and artificial political ignorance was thus diminished.\r\nThe ultimate result was a real expression of the will of the\r\nelectorate through the representatives chosen and full power in those\r\nrepresentatives to enact that will into law and also enforce the law\r\nthus made. In actual operation the results of applying this principle\r\nleft little to be desired in Galveston. Here are the comments of a\r\nkeen observer,[10] writing in 1911:\r\n\r\n To Americans accustomed to inefficiency in public office as contrasted\r\n with private enterprise, the story of the achievements of this\r\n Commission reads like a romance. Unhampered by checks and balances\r\n and legal red-tape, the Commission reorganized the city government,\r\n restored the city property, planned and financed and built the\r\n great sea-wall that now bars out the sea, raised the ground level\r\n of the city, and, withal, reduced the tax-rate and the debt! The\r\n annual running expenses of the city were decreased one-third. The\r\n new government displayed foresight, intelligence, and dispatch. It\r\n appeared sensitive to that public clamor which the average politician\r\n considers so needless.\r\n\r\n There was striking change in the attitude of the public toward the\r\n doings at City Hall. The people began to “take an interest” in their\r\n common property, to discuss the doings of the Commission on street\r\n corners, to have “civic pride” (since there was now at last something\r\n to be proud of), to criticize or applaud the work of their servants.\r\n They seemed to have actually a proprietary interest in the government!\r\n Amid this widespread discussion the influence of the politicians of\r\n the town was swamped and counted for only its true numerical strength.\r\n\r\n Now every American city has its spells of good government--the\r\n reactions that follow orgies of corruption and scandal--and the\r\n fact that the new Galveston government saved money is not in itself\r\n significant. The vital difference is that these good administrators\r\n in Galveston, without building up personal “machines” or intrenching\r\n themselves in power by the usual army-like methods of political\r\n organization, were able to secure re-election again and again. They\r\n won favor by serving all the people well. They did their work in the\r\n spot-light of public scrutiny, where every citizen could see and\r\n appreciate and applaud.\r\n\r\nUnless, however, the fundamental principles at the basis of government\r\nby commission are observed and applied, there can be much apparent\r\ncommission form of government for cities which will not in any way\r\nmilitate against extra-legal unpopular government.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance, a municipal government by commission is planted\r\nin a territory where several other municipal governments are also\r\noperating, each with a long list of elective officers, very little\r\nhas been accomplished toward that centralization of governmental\r\npower in a few commissioners which tends to eliminate extra-legal\r\ngovernment. Each of the municipal governments operating in the same\r\nterritory will divide the entire local governmental power among\r\nthem. The decentralization of governmental power will still exist in\r\nexaggerated form and the political ignorance of the voter must still\r\nbe such that he will need to be advised and directed how to vote, and\r\nthe professional adviser and director to the politically ignorant\r\nvoter will still continue to satisfy that need. Once the professional\r\nadviser and director to the politically ignorant voter is retained in\r\nthe district where the commission form of government operates, he will\r\nbegin to exercise an influence in the nomination and selection of the\r\ncommissioners. Extra-legal government as conducted by him may even\r\ncapture a majority of the commissioners and use the great governmental\r\npower vested in them in a scandalous manner. The present situation in\r\nChicago well illustrates this danger. There the municipal government\r\nis very highly centralized. The voter casts his ballot only for a\r\nmayor every four years, a city clerk and the city treasurer every two\r\nyears and two aldermen from each of the 35 wards--one alderman being\r\nselected from each ward every year. The other administrative officers\r\nnot under civil service are appointed by the mayor with the consent\r\nof the council. If Chicago were the only local government in the\r\nterritory which it occupies it would be a fair type of responsible city\r\ngovernment wielding a highly centralized governmental power. Machine\r\npolitics would thrive only in the districts where the majority of\r\nthe voters were illiterate and where corrupt and illegal voting was\r\npracticed on a considerable scale. But operating in the same territory\r\nwith the city of Chicago is the Sanitary District with 9 trustees,\r\nand Cook County with 73 elective officers. It is the long ballot for\r\nCook County which causes the densest political ignorance on the part\r\nof the voter and makes the existence of the professional adviser and\r\ndirector of the politically ignorant voter necessary and therefore\r\nthe existence of extra-legal government certain and permanent. Such\r\nan extra-legal government, when once established, naturally exerts a\r\ngreat influence even in city elections. If the two principal party\r\nvote-directing machines agree to divide the city and county governments\r\nbetween them and each helps the other to appoint those who are to fill\r\nthe legal offices in that government which it is agreed each shall\r\ncontrol, the power of extra-legal government in the city will be very\r\ngreat indeed. In the same way, if a commission form of government\r\nbe provided for smaller cities which must divide governmental power\r\nwith a township government, a county government, and a drainage or a\r\nlevee district, all operating in the same territory and all having a\r\nconsiderable list of elective officers, there is little hope for a real\r\ntrial of the effect of the concentration of governmental power in a\r\nfew elective offices to disrupt extra-legal government. It is of the\r\nutmost importance to the success of the commission form of government\r\nfor smaller cities that such government be the only local government\r\noperating in the territory occupied by the city.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, it is necessary that municipal corporations\r\nwith special powers and functions and collecting taxes from a special\r\ndistrict for a special purpose should occupy territory in which several\r\nother units of municipal government operate. For instance, the Sanitary\r\nDistrict in Cook County properly levies taxes upon property in the\r\ncity of Chicago and in part of Cook County, and builds a canal running\r\nthrough Cook County and Will County. How is it possible to avoid having\r\nthe commissioners of such a sanitary district elected from the district\r\nwhere its revenues are obtained? The answer is very simple. Such\r\ncommissioners should be appointed by the different municipal units of\r\ngovernment occupying the territory included in the sanitary district.\r\nThe city of Chicago, of course, should appoint the majority of the\r\ncommissioners. The municipal governments outside the city of Chicago\r\nshould be combined together in groups and the legislative bodies of\r\nthe municipalities in each group be given a voice in the selection\r\nof commissioners for the Sanitary District. The same principle of\r\nappointment may be adopted whenever a special board with special\r\nfunctions is to occupy territory which includes several units of local\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of the commission form of government for cities to\r\noust extra-legal government requires the election of each commissioner\r\nfrom a wieldy district, i.e., one not so large but that the candidate\r\nwho is willing to run may be known with a fair degree of ease by the\r\nelectorate and be able with the least expense to make a personal\r\ncanvass.[11] The supposed advantage of electing commissioners at large\r\nfrom an unwieldy district is that this method insures the candidacy\r\nand election of men prominent in the entire district and hence more\r\nfit to hold office. But this is precisely what it does not do. It is\r\ntrue such a plan _demands_ candidates with a wide general reputation\r\nin the whole district. But such candidates do not come forward simply\r\nbecause the method of election suggests that such candidates should\r\nappear. Men with wide reputations in a large district are almost\r\ncertain to be occupying offices of greater importance in the state and\r\nfederal governments, or else they are not available at all for the\r\nholding of public office. The leading citizen will not as a rule be a\r\ncandidate for a position in the municipal government. The available\r\ncandidates are almost sure in the long run to be men whose reputations\r\nare confined to some district of the larger community. When they run\r\nfor election in a district which stretches beyond the zone of their\r\npersonal influence and reputation, some machinery for enlightening the\r\nvoters’ ignorance as to who they are and what they stand for must be\r\ndevised. This means that the candidate must have money and backing.\r\nThose requirements may seriously limit the number of candidates and\r\ntherefore the choice of the voter. Furthermore, in promoting slates of\r\ncandidates care will usually be taken to select men with reference to\r\nparticular districts in the community at large, so that each district\r\nwill feel that it has a representative on the ticket. Thus a provision\r\nfor the election of commissioners at large from an unwieldy district\r\nis likely to relapse in practice into the presentation of candidates\r\nrepresenting small districts, each with a local reputation in his own\r\ndistrict. This becomes in substance an election of commissioners from\r\ndistricts and yet the range of choice by the voter resulting from the\r\ncoming forward of candidates will be very much restricted because\r\nof the expense of making a canvass in the unwieldy district and the\r\nnecessity for an organized support. Candidates who are successful in\r\nbeing elected from the unwieldy district are likely to be beholden to\r\nan organization, whether it be temporary or permanent, which has aided\r\nthem in the election. A system of electing commissioners at large from\r\nan unwieldy district in a greater or less degree produces a condition\r\nwhich tends to keep alive the extra-legal government. On the other\r\nhand, with elections in wieldy districts the number of candidates who\r\ncome forward is the largest possible. The choice of the voter is,\r\ntherefore, the widest. Each candidate may become most easily personally\r\nknown to the electorate. The sharp contest between individuals in a\r\nsmall district is always peculiarly enlightening to the electorate\r\nand stimulating to his interest in political matters. The expense of\r\na canvass may, therefore, be reduced without lessening the amount of\r\nknowledge which the voter will obtain regarding issues and candidates.\r\nThe services of an extensive organization for the purpose of directing\r\nthe politically ignorant voter who to vote for would naturally give way\r\nto organizations for dispensing actual knowledge concerning candidates\r\nand conditions. The services of a highly developed and permanent\r\nmachine designed to direct the politically ignorant how to vote must\r\nbecome of the least possible value.\r\n\r\nThe practice of the principle of selecting commissioners from wieldy\r\ndistricts may take several forms, depending largely upon the size of\r\nthe electorate.\r\n\r\nIf the whole city is not more than a wieldy district in itself, then of\r\ncourse the election of all the commissioners at large is in accordance\r\nwith the sound principle announced. Such election may very properly be\r\naccording to any one of several plans.\r\n\r\n_First_: The candidates to the number of commissioners to be selected\r\nreceiving the highest vote at a single election may be declared\r\nelected, although none receive an actual majority of the votes cast.\r\nThis is the simplest method. It is the one in use at Galveston, with a\r\npopulation of about 40,000, and seems to have given satisfaction.\r\n\r\n_Second_: The commissioners elected at large may be required to receive\r\nan actual majority. If there are more than two candidates for each\r\nplace, this may be secured at a single election by the voters marking\r\ntheir first and other choices for each of the places to be filled, so\r\nthat if no election is had by a majority according to the first choice\r\nof the voters, the second and other choices may be used to indicate\r\nwhich ones receive an actual majority. Or a second election may be held\r\nat which only candidates in double the number of places to be filled\r\nwho have received the highest number of votes at the first election\r\nare placed upon the final ballot. The second election may be required\r\neven though candidates receiving the highest votes at the first\r\nelection actually receive a majority. This last is the plan adopted,\r\napparently with good results, in Des Moines, Iowa.[12]\r\n\r\n_Third_: Then there is the Hare plan of proportional representation and\r\nthe single transferable vote.[13] To insure an election a candidate\r\nneed only obtain a “quota” of the votes cast--i.e., that number of\r\nvotes which can be obtained by the number of candidates equal to the\r\nnumber of places to be filled, but by no more. Thus if the electorate\r\nnumber 5,000 and there are 5 places to be filled, the “quota” or number\r\nof votes required for an election would be 834. Five persons could\r\nreceive this number of votes, but the sixth candidate could not do\r\nso. Each voter is allowed to indicate his first, second, third, and\r\nother choices, but can indicate only one first choice and one second\r\nchoice, etc. At the first count only first choices are reckoned and\r\nthe candidates who have received a “quota” or more according to first\r\nchoices are declared elected. If all the places have not then been\r\nfilled up, the surplus votes of those candidates who have received\r\nmore than the “quota” are transferred according to the names marked\r\n(2) on them. If these transfers do not bring the requisite number of\r\ncandidates up to the “quota,” the lowest candidate is eliminated and\r\nhis votes transferred according to the next preference, and so on\r\nuntil all the places are filled. The object of this plan is to give\r\nrepresentation to minorities or to groups less than a majority.\r\n\r\nSo far as the disruption of extra-legal government by politocrats is\r\nconcerned, it is doubtful if it makes any difference which of the above\r\nplans of election be adopted in commission-governed municipalities\r\nwhich as a whole constitute only a single wieldy district of, let us\r\nsay, not to exceed 6,000 male voters and 50,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSuppose now the municipality be larger than a single wieldy district,\r\nbut still small enough so that it is very plainly a unit in its\r\ninterests and collective activities--let us say a city with not to\r\nexceed 25,000 male voters and a population of not more than 150,000.\r\nHere there will be a distinct danger in electing commissioners at large\r\nat a single election at which are chosen those who obtain the highest\r\nvotes, even though less than a majority. If the choice is to be by a\r\nplurality at a single election the municipality should be divided into\r\nwards with a single commissioner elected from each, but no candidate\r\nshould be required to reside in the ward where he stands for election.\r\nThe Hare plan is entirely available and consistent with the choice\r\nof commissioners from wieldy districts. In Des Moines, Iowa, with a\r\npopulation of about 86,000, the double election plan seems to have\r\nbeen used with success. This may also be regarded as consistent in a\r\nway with the election of commissioners from wieldy districts. True,\r\na single district with a population of 80,000 might be regarded as\r\nunwieldy for the purpose of a single election. But the double election\r\nsecures the same education for the electorate that the voter would\r\nobtain in a single election in a district one-half as large. Hence a\r\nwieldy district having a double election can be considerably larger\r\nthan a wieldy district having a single election.\r\n\r\nSuppose, however, that the municipality be large enough to be readily\r\ndivided into as many wieldy districts as there are commissioners to\r\nthe number of from five to nine. For instance, let us assume a city\r\nof to exceed 25,000 male voters and a population exceeding 150,000.\r\nHere the district is too unwieldy for the election at large of those\r\ncandidates receiving the highest votes at a single election. It may be\r\ndoubted whether the double election will produce satisfactory results\r\nin the way of securing a really intelligent vote. We have probably\r\ncome to a situation where the principle of electing commissioners from\r\nwieldy districts requires either a division of the city into wards\r\nwith a commissioner elected from each, or else the election at large\r\nof all the commissioners by the Hare plan, in which only a “quota” of\r\nvotes is required for a choice. The advantage which the Hare plan has\r\nof permitting the candidates for commissioner to come from any part\r\nof the city can be duplicated to some extent in the ward plan by not\r\nrequiring any residence by candidates in the ward of the city where\r\nthey stand for election. Under either arrangement candidates will in\r\nall probability come from particular districts and localities where\r\ntheir strength lies.\r\n\r\nIt is no part of the writer’s plan to discuss at length the comparative\r\nmerits of the system of election from wieldy geographical districts\r\nand wieldy “quotas.” Each has its advantages and disadvantages. The\r\nwieldy geographical district has the advantage of presenting an issue\r\nof extreme simplicity to the voter and inducing interest in it by\r\nthe dramatic element of personal contest. The field in which the\r\ncandidates contest being limited, there is more concentrated work\r\nupon the education of the electorate and the electorate focuses its\r\nattention. It is not so clearly the fact that in a municipal election a\r\nlarge minority may be wholly unrepresented as it might be in elections\r\nto a national legislative body. The Hare plan insures minority\r\nrepresentation, or rather representation of different groups throughout\r\nthe district. It, however, departs from a desirable simplicity in\r\nvoting and vote-counting. It tends to eliminate the sharpness of\r\npersonal contest between candidates. Under the Hare plan candidates\r\nwill go on a still hunt all over the district for a “quota” and bid\r\nto various classes and cliques in the municipality for first and\r\nsecond choices. This develops what is called “minority thinking” and\r\n“particularist politics.” The candidates do not run against each other\r\nso much as they dodge in and out about each other. This also tends\r\nto puzzle the voter, confuse the issues, and achieve results which\r\nare unexpected. The test of the Hare plan in cities of over 150,000\r\ninhabitants in the United States is, it is believed, still to be made.\r\n\r\nIf the principles of the commission form of government be applied\r\nfaithfully and completely, there is no doubt that extra-legal\r\ngovernment in its present violent form must go. The voter’s duty\r\nwill be simple and he can perform it with the maximum amount of\r\nintelligence. The function of the electorate in voting is vital\r\nbecause it confers the whole power of the local government upon a body\r\nwhich is directly responsible to the electorate. What place, then, is\r\nthere for the professional adviser and director to the politically\r\nignorant voter? None! There is no such political ignorance as calls\r\nfor a director and adviser. The voter needs only enlightenment as\r\nto which of two honest and fairly efficient men has a program which\r\nthe voter on the whole favors. The voter is seeking information of a\r\nhighly organized sort. He can obtain that only by the use of his mind\r\nand a consideration of the promises and programs of the candidates.\r\nThe candidates now must make an appeal to the voter’s intelligence.\r\nWhat, then, is the need of the present-day extra-legal government? Of\r\ncourse, parties and party organizations will spring up, but they will\r\ncease to be mere machines for directing the ignorant voter how to cast\r\nhis ballot. Instead, they will become instruments for disseminating\r\npropaganda on social, economic, and governmental issues.\r\n\r\nOnce the extra-legal government is eliminated by the concentration of\r\ngovernmental power in the hands of a few, each of whom is elected to\r\noffice from a wieldy district or by a wieldy “quota,” the electorate\r\nmay with perfect safety secure control of its representatives in a\r\nvariety of ways. It may insist upon the recall, the initiative, and\r\nthe referendum. It is the promotion of these expedients while the\r\nballot is still left as long as at present and the governmental power\r\ndecentralized as it now is that tends to promote the existence and\r\nsecurity of extra-legal unpopular government. With irresponsible\r\nextra-legal government replaced by a responsible legal government\r\nsubject to frequent elections, one might hazard the guess that neither\r\nthe recall, the initiative, nor the referendum would be much used.\r\nThe primaries would be utterly out of place. No party names would\r\nappear on any ballot. In theory every individual legally qualified for\r\noffice would have the privilege of running at an election. Individuals\r\nshould be allowed to put themselves up. To discourage the running of\r\nirresponsible persons who have no real chance of election a sum should\r\nbe forfeited by all candidates who do not receive a certain percentage\r\nof the vote cast. Parties with principles and programs would naturally\r\nbe the only ones which would have any standing. It is highly improbable\r\nthat any such parties would exist for municipal elections. If they did,\r\nthey should be left free to run their affairs in their own way, since\r\ntheir candidates must always compete with individuals who wish to come\r\nforward in opposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] The question is frequently put whether it is better to have\r\nfive commissioners and let them choose their own chairman as a mere\r\npresiding officer, or to provide that one commissioner specially\r\nelected shall be chairman, with special executive and administrative\r\npowers. The two plans represent simply a difference in the degree\r\nwith which the executive and legislative powers are united. If one\r\ncommissioner is elected specially as a chairman or a mayor, with\r\nadministrative and executive duties, and the other commissioners are\r\nmerely an advisory board, you have a certain degree of separation\r\nof the executive and legislative functions. The chairman or mayor\r\nmust in that case be elected at large from the city. His office will\r\nbe so conspicuous and important as to overshadow the offices of the\r\ncommissioners, and there will be the probability of deadlocks between\r\nthe executive and the commissioners exercising the legislative power.\r\nIf, on the other hand, all the commissioners are equally possessed\r\nof the executive and legislative power, there is a complete union of\r\nboth functions. The majority of the commission then becomes entirely\r\nresponsible, not only for the making, but for the enforcement, of\r\nthe laws and administrative measures. So far as the disrupting of\r\nextra-legal government in cities the size of Galveston is concerned,\r\nit is believed not to make any material difference which plan be\r\nadopted. The surer course is that of making the majority of all the\r\ncommissioners responsible for the exercise of the entire legislative\r\nand executive powers.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely in accordance with the principle of the union of\r\nexecutive and legislative powers in the commission that it hire a\r\nprofessional municipal administrator to hold office at the pleasure\r\nof the commission and delegate to him such executive duties and\r\nlegislative power, subject always to the control of the commission, as\r\nthe commission sees fit.\r\n\r\n[10] Richard S. Childs, _Short-Ballot Principles_, pp. 66-67.\r\n\r\n[11] For a further exposition of a wieldy district see Richard S.\r\nChilds, _Short-Ballot Principles_, pp. 51-58.\r\n\r\n[12] John J.

Hoag, “The Representative Council Plan of City\r\nGovernment,” _The American City_, April, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF THE COMMISSION FORM OF GOVERNMENT APPLIED TO THE\r\nLARGER CITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the city be a larger one, with 100,000 male voters and upward,\r\nand a population of 700,000 to 1,000,000 and upward, its government\r\nby a small commission, each member of which is elected from a wieldy\r\ndistrict, or by a wieldy “quota” under the Hare plan, becomes\r\nimpossible. When districts begin to have more than 6,000 male voters\r\nand a population of more than 50,000, or the “quotas” are over 6,000\r\nmale voters, they are probably no longer wieldy. Yet a commission of\r\n16 and upward is no longer a body which can exercise legislative and\r\nexecutive power in a convenient manner, like a board of 5, or even 9.\r\nThe problem of the application of the principles of the commission form\r\nof government to the larger cities is therefore this: How can districts\r\nor “quotas” be kept wieldy and the city at the same time be governed by\r\na small commission having both legislative and executive powers?\r\n\r\nOne solution of the problem is as follows: The control of the entire\r\nexecutive and legislative power of the municipality should be vested\r\nin the municipal council. This should be composed of as many members\r\nas there are wieldy districts or wieldy “quotas” in the municipality.\r\nTaking 3,000 voters as making up a wieldy district or “quota,” this\r\nwould give a city of 100,000 male voters a council of 33 and a city\r\nof 300,000 male voters a council of 100. This last might be reduced\r\nto 50 if the maximum of 6,000 male voters be taken as the measure\r\nof a wieldy district or “quota.” This council should then appoint\r\nthe mayor and perhaps, with the mayor’s approval, the heads of the\r\ndepartments, all to hold office at the pleasure of the council.[14]\r\nThe mayor and his heads of departments should then form a governing\r\ncommission or board with such executive and legislative powers as might\r\nbe conferred by ordinances passed by the council and subject at all\r\ntimes to the control of the council. Such a scheme would retain the\r\nsystem of electing representatives from wieldy districts. There would\r\nrest upon them full responsibility for the exercise of the legislative\r\nand executive power. Yet they would be left free to delegate executive\r\npower and some legislative power to a commission of administrators\r\nwhose whole business it was to serve the municipal government. Such\r\na commission might be composed of the leaders of the majority of the\r\ncouncil or of expert municipal managers brought from any part of the\r\nworld, or both. The council should be left free to choose what method\r\nit would adopt.\r\n\r\nA plan of government for our larger cities frequently adopted is\r\nthis: Single aldermen are elected from each wieldy district in the\r\nmunicipality. All the aldermen thus selected form a city council which\r\nexercises the legislative power. The mayor is elected at large. He\r\npresides over the city council and, with the heads of his executive\r\ndepartments who hold at his pleasure, wields the entire executive\r\npower. The new Cleveland charter gives the department heads seats\r\nin the council with the right to address that body. There is here a\r\nproximity of the executive and legislative power, rather than a real\r\nunion of it. Whatever union there may be is largely on the side of\r\ngiving the executive a position in the deliberations of the legislative\r\nbody. The council has no function in the actual exercise of the\r\nexecutive power. The entire executive power is really concentrated in a\r\nsingle individual elected at large and holding office for two and often\r\nfour years. This feature is in sharp contrast to the vesting of the\r\nexecutive power in the representatives of wieldy districts or “quotas,”\r\nwho control and direct the exercise of that power by a single executive\r\nwho holds at their pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe one plan that should not be attempted in our larger cities is\r\nthat of providing for the union of the executive and legislative\r\nfunctions in a few commissioners elected at large, thereby violating\r\nthe essential principle of electing representatives from wieldy\r\ngeographical districts or by wieldy “quotas.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] See Richard S. Childs, “The Theory of the New Controlled-Executive\r\nPlan,” _National Municipal Review_, II, 76 (January, 1913); C. G. Hoag,\r\n“The Representative Plan of Government,” _The American City_, April,\r\n1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLES OF THE COMMISSION FORM OF GOVERNMENT APPLIED TO THE STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principles at the basis of the commission form of government for\r\ncities may equally well be applied to a state government.\r\n\r\nOur first care must be to eliminate the division of power which comes\r\nfrom having two legislative chambers, each equally representing the\r\nelectorate. The legislative power as it comes from the electorate at\r\nlarge must be lodged in a single legislative chamber.\r\n\r\nIn the second place we must provide for the election of members to\r\nthis single chamber from “quotas” or districts which are as wieldy\r\nas possible. One member should be elected by each “quota” or from\r\neach district.[15] The requirement that districts or “quotas” which\r\nelect members be wieldy is so important that it must determine the\r\nminimum number of members in the single legislative chamber. If it be\r\ndetermined that a district or “quota” with 4,000 male voters would be\r\nsuitably wieldy, then each district would contain a population of about\r\n25,000, and for a state like Illinois there would be 200 districts.\r\n\r\nLastly, following the commission form of government for cities we must\r\nplace the control of the entire executive power in the hands of this\r\nsingle legislative chamber. In short, we must apply the principle\r\nof uniting the executive and the legislative power in the same body.\r\nHow, it will be asked, can this be done? It is essential that the\r\nlegislature should have two hundred members so that the districts\r\nor “quotas” may be wieldy. How, then, is it possible to give to the\r\nlegislature control of the executive power?\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the plan of a state executive selected by the\r\nsingle-chamber legislature and holding at its pleasure, after the\r\nmanner of the controlled executive for the larger cities, will not\r\ndo. It is true the state executive may not handle so large a budget\r\nas some cities, but the state executive power is not for that reason\r\nless important or extensive. The legislative power of the state, which\r\nis greater than the legislative power of any city, may build up the\r\nstate executive functions so that they are quite beyond those of any\r\ncity. The state executive functions are, therefore, always potentially\r\nmore extensive than those of the city executive. Then in the state\r\nlegislature composed of one hundred members or more representing\r\ndifferent political and party programs, there are far greater chances\r\nof a serious deadlock than in a city council. When a deadlock occurs\r\nin the state legislature it may be difficult, if not impossible, to\r\ndetermine what are the controlling elements in the legislative assembly\r\nif the power of selection is left with the legislature itself. There is\r\nneed, therefore, of an independent authority outside the legislature\r\nto select from it those who shall wield the executive power and\r\nthus rescue the exercise of that power from any deadlock among the\r\nlegislators.\r\n\r\nThese considerations lead naturally to the following plan: All\r\nexecutive acts must be done as now, in the name of a single executive.\r\nBut the control of all executive acts must be placed in the hands of\r\na council of state, to be composed of (let us say) seven members,\r\nwho should usually be drawn from the leaders of the regularly voting\r\nmajority of the legislative chamber. It will be the important duty\r\nof the single executive to determine who are the regularly voting\r\nmajority, and who are its leaders, to summon them to form a council\r\nof state, to determine when those leaders have ceased to possess a\r\nregularly voting majority and, when that occurs, to dismiss them or\r\naccept their resignations and replace them with a council of state\r\nwhich has at its command a regularly voting majority. Once the council\r\nof state is selected, however, the actual control of the executive\r\nfunction will reside in it. Thus the real executive is the council of\r\nstate, and since it must usually control a majority of the legislature,\r\nit will have possession of the legislative power as well. This is the\r\nneat and feasible scheme for applying the essential principle of the\r\ncommission form of government when a large representative assembly is a\r\nnecessity. The method of selecting the single executive whose principal\r\nduty it is to place the executive power of the state from time to\r\ntime in the control of a proper council of state, selected from among\r\nthe leaders of a majority of the legislature, is not very important.\r\nVery likely the only practicable way would be by election at large at\r\nconsiderable intervals of time.\r\n\r\nVery little alteration in our present state constitutions is necessary\r\nin order to bring about the greater part of the change in the plan of\r\ngovernment suggested. The members of the lower house of the legislature\r\nare usually elected from fairly wieldy districts. The union of the\r\nexecutive and legislative functions is very simply accomplished by\r\ndropping from the list of elective officers the lieutenant-governor,\r\nthe secretary of state, the auditor of public accounts, the treasurer,\r\nthe superintendent of public instruction, the attorney-general, and\r\nothers and adding the following provisions:\r\n\r\n There shall be an executive council to advise the governor in the\r\n government of the state. The members thereof shall be chosen and\r\n summoned by the governor and serve as executive councilors. They shall\r\n hold office during the pleasure of the governor.\r\n\r\n The executive power vested in the governor by this constitution\r\n shall, unless in this constitution otherwise specified, be exercised\r\n by the governor acting with the advice of the executive council. The\r\n provisions of this constitution, referring to the governor in council,\r\n shall be construed as referring to the governor acting with the advice\r\n of the executive council.\r\n\r\n The governor may appoint officers not exceeding ten in number to\r\n administer such departments of the state as the governor in council\r\n may establish and until such establishment, to administer the\r\n departments of state, public accounts, treasury, public instruction,\r\n justice, and state institutions. Such officers shall hold office\r\n during the pleasure of the governor. They shall be the members of the\r\n executive council and after the first general election of members of\r\n the general assembly, as herein provided, _no member of the executive\r\n council shall hold office for a longer period than three months unless\r\n he is or becomes a member of either house[16] of the general assembly_.\r\n\r\nThe necessary result of such changes would be that the governor could\r\ndo no important act without the consent of the council. The council\r\nwould in fact be the executive. The election which put the governor in\r\noffice might be expected to put a majority of the same party in the\r\nlegislature, and the executive council would naturally be selected from\r\nthe leaders of that majority. Even if the governor and the majority of\r\nthe legislature belonged to different parties, yet there would be the\r\nstrongest motive for the selection of an executive council from the\r\nmajority of the legislature, thus avoiding the responsibility for a\r\ncontest between the majority in the legislature and the executive which\r\nwould throw the government into confusion.\r\n\r\nThe complete success of a plan which involves the union of the\r\nexecutive and legislative power in the leaders of a majority of\r\nthe legislature requires the presence in the legislature of some\r\nat least of the leaders of the principal parties. The absence from\r\nthe legislature of such leaders would leave the control of the most\r\nimportant powers of government in the hands of the less experienced\r\nand less able members of the party. The opposition also might have\r\na less effective representation. This would be a serious matter for\r\nthe parties themselves. The public service also would suffer. It is\r\nin the interest of the best administration of the affairs of state\r\nthat the ability and experience of the party leaders of both the\r\nmajority and the minority be kept in the service of the state as long\r\nas possible. It is also important that the executive and legislative\r\npowers be exercised for the benefit of the state as a whole and not\r\nfor the purpose of furthering the parochial interests of individual\r\nlegislators. This is most surely accomplished by the presence in the\r\nlegislature of the party leaders of the majority. There are several\r\nways of insuring the return to the legislature of some at least of the\r\nleaders of the principal parties, even when they may not be able to\r\nsecure a plurality of the votes cast in the district where they run:\r\nFirst, candidates for the legislature may be permitted to stand for\r\nelection in any district of the state, no matter where they reside.\r\nThat does not go far, however, in the direction of returning party\r\nleaders unless elections are held at different times in different\r\ndistricts. Second, if elections are held at the same time in all\r\ndistricts the elector might be permitted to vote for a candidate\r\nrunning in his own or any other district. This would enable the party\r\nto switch some of its votes in a district where it was strong to\r\nspecial leaders standing for election in districts where their success\r\nwas in doubt. This is one of the proposals of the People’s Power\r\nLeague of Oregon. Third, a direct way of accomplishing the desired\r\nresult would be to permit each party polling at least 25 per cent of\r\nthe total vote cast at an election for members of the legislature to\r\nappoint as many representatives as the entire party vote contains\r\ntenths of the total vote cast. Fourth, the same result might be\r\nobtained by providing for the election at large of a small number of\r\nlegislators by “quotas,” according to the Hare plan.[17]\r\n\r\nNow observe the effect of the application of the principles of the\r\ncommission form of government for cities to the state government. The\r\noffice of legislator has been made important and conspicuous because it\r\nis the only office in the state government (except that of governor)\r\nfor which the voter casts his ballot, and because the successful\r\ncandidate will cast one of two hundred ballots for the selection of\r\nthe real executive. Under such a system it is certain that the voter\r\nwill know in advance that a vote for candidate A means a vote for B,\r\nas the real executive or leader of the council of state. Thus a vote\r\nfor state legislator will be a vote to confer the entire legislative\r\nand executive power of the state upon a given group of legislators\r\nand their leaders. We have indeed made the voting privilege of the\r\nelector so important that he will not only be sure to vote, but he\r\nmay be expected to do much to keep himself fully informed about the\r\ncandidates. We have made the act of voting so simple that the elector\r\ncannot fail to use such intelligence as he has and to spend any extra\r\ntime which he may have in informing himself further. By providing for\r\nthe election of single legislators from wieldy districts or by wieldy\r\n“quotas” we have brought the voter as near the candidates as possible.\r\nBy stimulating the number of candidates we have given the voter as\r\nwide a range of choice as possible. These devices all have a tendency\r\nto eliminate the politically ignorant vote. The actual intelligence of\r\nthe electorate is given the fullest possible play, and even stimulated\r\nto unusual efforts of comprehension. This is a guaranty, and it is the\r\nonly guaranty, against that political ignorance on the part of a large\r\nnumber of voters which provides the opportunity for the professional\r\npolitician to step in and, in the guise of advising and directing the\r\nvoter how to vote, in effect to cast his ballot for him. The essential\r\ncondition upon which a vote-directing political machine is founded and\r\nmaintained has, therefore, been eliminated. Under such circumstances\r\na vote-directing machine, instead of slipping over, in the darkness\r\nand obscurity which comes from a multiplicity of elections and offices\r\nto be filled, those whom it can control, for ends of which the\r\nelectorate does not really approve, must begin to appeal to the voter’s\r\nintelligence with candidates of character, arguments, platforms, and\r\npledges of legislation which those elected have the power to keep.\r\nSuch activities on the part of any organization will at once change it\r\nfrom a mere vote-directing machine into a legitimate party with real\r\nprinciples and a real program. The leaders of such an organization\r\nwill necessarily stand for election in the real government, which will\r\nnow be the legal government. Real party leaders will appear in the\r\nlegislature with real party programs for legislation and real party\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, in the scheme of state government presented, not\r\nonly done our utmost to destroy at the roots extra-legal unpopular\r\ngovernment, but we have provided a government which can operate. We\r\nhave cut off all bickering between the legislature and executive. We\r\nhave given power to an executive council which will enable it to do\r\nsomething. We have constituted a government which will be inactive,\r\nnot because its hands are tied, but because it chooses not to do\r\nanything. The leader of the successful party cannot say that he has\r\nfailed to keep the party pledges because he had no power to act. No\r\none, however, need fear that the concentration of power in the hands of\r\na few will prove in any way dangerous to the liberties of the people.\r\nThe council of state can exercise power only so long as it retains the\r\nconfidence of a majority in the legislature. Even out of the season\r\nof elections the legislature will necessarily be sensitive to public\r\nopinion, and a council of state that did not consider the effect of\r\npublic opinion upon a majority of the members of the legislature could\r\nnot long hold power. By frequent elections the majority may be changed\r\nand the council recalled in favor of the leader of an opposition. The\r\neffectiveness of voting will thus be enormously increased, for the\r\nelectorate will not have to turn out a dozen different officers at\r\nseveral different elections in order to change control of the legal\r\ngovernment. Voting at a single election does it. Upon a poll of the\r\ndistricts or of the “quotas” it is determined whether one set of\r\nlegislators or another shall control the executive and legislative\r\npower centered in a single chamber. No government can be unpopular\r\nor an executive council remain in office against the will of the\r\nelectorate under such a scheme of government. No government can remain\r\nin office and avoid the consequences of failure and inefficiency when\r\nso organized.\r\n\r\nIf such a scheme of government does not break the malign influence\r\nof an extra-legal government founded upon a vote-directing machine,\r\nthen such a power cannot be broken. If the scheme of government which\r\nhas been outlined does not give the electorate a real opportunity to\r\nexpress its will through its representatives and to make that will into\r\nlaw and then enforce the law through those same representatives, then\r\nour attempt to achieve representative government will have failed and\r\nwe shall have been unsuccessful in securing that which other nations,\r\neven though in form at least still governed by kings, have been able to\r\nachieve.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] The Illinois plan of minority representation in the legislature\r\nprovides for the election of three representatives from each district\r\nand allows each voter to cast three votes as he pleases, one for each\r\ncandidate or three for one candidate or one and a half for each of two\r\ncandidates. Where extra-legal government by politocrats is strong, this\r\nhas for years resulted in members of the legislature being appointed\r\nby the extra-legal government. The electorate has been wholly and\r\npalpably disfranchised. If there are two political machines in the\r\ndistrict, one dominant and the other with a fair strength, they have\r\nby agreement between them arranged that the dominant machine should\r\nnominate only two candidates and the other only one. Thus the voter is\r\ngiven no choice whatever and the nominations are an appointment. If\r\nthere are three equally strong political machines, each by agreement\r\nwill nominate one candidate. As a matter of fact without agreement the\r\nnumber of candidates nominated will usually be as above indicated under\r\nthe circumstances named. Thus the electorate in very many Illinois\r\ndistricts has had comparatively little or no real representation in\r\nthe lower house of the legislature for years. The worst elements in\r\nthe house have under this system been returned again and again. See\r\neditorial in the _Chicago Tribune_ for December 22, 1912, on “Minority\r\nRepresentation.”\r\n\r\n[16] This assumes the existence of a second chamber as suggested in\r\nchap. xvi.\r\n\r\n[17] See _ante_, p. 153.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n CONTEMPORARY PLANS LOOKING TOWARD THE UNION OF THE EXECUTIVE AND\r\n LEGISLATIVE POWERS OF STATE GOVERNMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOur state legislatures are now for the most part composed of members\r\nelected from fairly wieldy districts. Governmental changes then which\r\nlook toward the application of the principles of commission government\r\nto the state, as outlined in the preceding chapter, have to do\r\nprincipally with the union of the executive and legislative powers.\r\nSeveral recent proposals for changes, coming from Illinois, Wisconsin,\r\nKansas, and Oregon, indicate that legislators, governors, and political\r\nscientists with practical experience have concluded that the executive\r\nand legislative powers must be brought nearer together. The interesting\r\nfact, however, is that no plans have been suggested by which the\r\nlegislature is to absorb the control of the executive power by placing\r\nit in the hands of the leaders of a majority of the legislature. On\r\nthe contrary, the proposals for bringing the executive and legislature\r\nnearer together have, with one exception, been along the line of\r\nconferring upon the executive greater power to control and coerce the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois House of Representatives at its 1913 session adopted\r\na rule for which Representative Morton D. Hull was responsible. It\r\nprovided as follows:\r\n\r\n When any bill or resolution is introduced for the purpose of\r\n carrying into effect any recommendation of the governor, it may by\r\n executive message addressed to the speaker of the house be made\r\n an administration measure. An administration measure may be sent\r\n to the appropriate committee, or it shall, upon request of its\r\n introducer, be sent to committee of the whole house. When such a\r\n measure has been reported out of committee, it shall have precedence\r\n in the consideration of the house over all other measures except\r\n appropriation bills. The house shall sit in committee of the whole\r\n for the consideration of administration measures on Tuesday morning\r\n immediately after the reading of the house journal.\r\n\r\nThis rule very plainly brings the executive and the legislature nearer\r\ntogether. It does so, however, only by conferring upon the governor\r\nan important privilege which enables him to advance his legislative\r\nprogram.\r\n\r\nThe proposed amendment to the Wisconsin constitution providing for an\r\ninitiative by the electorate at large for legislation[18] gives to\r\nthe governor a practical method of coercing or “steam-rollering” the\r\nopposition of a hostile legislature. It provides for the submission to\r\nthe electorate at large of any bill introduced into the legislature\r\nany time within the first thirty days of the session. This enables the\r\ngovernor to present all administration bills to the legislature and if\r\nthey fail of passage he may then present them for enactment into law by\r\nthe electorate at large. This is giving the governor power to promote\r\nand control legislation to a very great degree.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hodges of Kansas in his message to the legislature of March\r\n10, 1913, in terms advocated the adoption of the commission plan\r\nof government for the state. As there outlined, the details of the\r\nplan were somewhat vague. It consisted apparently of a unicameral\r\nlegislature containing one or two members from each of the eight\r\ncongressional districts of the state, with terms of from four to\r\nsix years. This legislative commission was to be in session as the\r\nexigencies of the public business demanded. The governor was to\r\nbe ex officio a member and presiding officer of the commission or\r\nlegislative assembly. We observe here no other union of the executive\r\nand legislative powers than occurs in a city government like that\r\nof Chicago, where the mayor is elected at large and vested with the\r\nexecutive power and presides over a unicameral council of comparatively\r\nfew members exercising the municipal legislative power. Governor\r\nHodges’ suggestion would vest more power in the state executive than\r\nhe now has, by reason of his being the presiding officer of the\r\nlegislative body. Apart from this, it does not go farther than to\r\npropose a reduction in the size of the legislature. But even that\r\npart of the plan may be open to the objection that it violates the\r\nfundamental principle of the selection of representatives from wieldy\r\ngeographical districts or by wieldy “quotas.” On the whole, Governor\r\nHodges’ plan would seem to be one which, like the Hull rule in Illinois\r\nand the Wisconsin provision for an initiative, increased the power of\r\nthe executive elected at large and diminished the importance and power\r\nof the representatives of the electorate.\r\n\r\nThe latest plans of the People’s Power League of Oregon are set out in\r\ndetail in certain constitutional amendments which are to be submitted\r\nto the people upon a referendum.[19]\r\n\r\nWe notice first of all a concentration of executive power in the\r\ngovernor by reason of the fact that he appoints his cabinet consisting\r\nof an attorney-general, a secretary of state, a treasurer, a printer,\r\na superintendent of public instruction, a secretary of labor, a\r\nstate business manager, and such others as may be provided by law.\r\nHe appoints also all sheriffs and district attorneys throughout the\r\nstate. These local officers, however, are subject to a recall by\r\nthe electorate. The powers and duties of all state commissions are\r\nconsolidated and vested in the governor and become a part of the\r\nexecutive powers and functions, excepting the rail-road commission,\r\nthe members of which are, however, appointed by the governor. The\r\ngovernor’s power is further increased by giving to him and his cabinet\r\nofficers seats in a unicameral legislature. It is made the duty of the\r\ngovernor to introduce all bills for appropriating money. While the\r\nlegislature may reduce the amount of appropriations, it cannot increase\r\nthem without the consent of the governor. The general veto power of\r\nthe governor is taken away, but he would still seem to have power by\r\npromoting a referendum, to appeal to the electorate to override the\r\nlegislature.[20]\r\n\r\nThe single-chamber legislature is to consist of 60 members not less\r\nthan 2 of whom are elected from each district containing approximately\r\nas many sixtieths of the population as there are members to be elected\r\nfrom the district. The voter in no case is permitted to vote for more\r\nthan one candidate. Hence each party would be expected to put up as\r\nmany candidates as it estimated its strength to be in sixtieths of\r\nthe population. The result is bound to be a minority representation,\r\nif there be any substantial minority. To obviate the minority having\r\nas much power as the majority each member elected casts as many votes\r\nin the legislature as there are voters who cast their ballots for\r\nhim. The unsuccessful candidate for governor who receives the highest\r\nnumber of votes in his party is made a member of the legislature with a\r\nvoting strength equal to the number of votes cast for the unsuccessful\r\ncandidates of his party for places in the legislature. One might\r\nhazard the guess that a legislature so precisely representing the\r\nvoting strength of all factions and parties was peculiarly liable to\r\nlegislative deadlocks which would again vastly increase the opportunity\r\nof power in a governor who, with his cabinet, had places in the\r\nlegislative body and who possessed a vast power over appropriations.\r\n\r\nOn the whole these new plans from Oregon tend in the direction of\r\nmagnifying a one-man-executive power at the expense of the legislature\r\nrather than the increasing of the power of the legislature by giving to\r\nits leaders the control of the executive power.\r\n\r\nAt the 1913 session of the Illinois legislature there was introduced\r\nby Senator Logan Hay a bill to establish what is now known as the Hay\r\nplan for a legislative commission. It provided for a joint legislative\r\ncommission to consist of the governor, who was made ex officio chairman\r\nof the committee, the lieutenant-governor, the speaker, the chairmen of\r\nthe committees on appropriations and judiciary of the Senate and the\r\nHouse, and five other senators and five other representatives, selected\r\nas other committees were, viz., in the senate by the resolution of that\r\nbody, in the House by the speaker. The governor, lieutenant-governor,\r\nand speaker were to serve on the committee during their term of\r\noffice and the other members till the convening of the next General\r\nAssembly after their appointment. The commission was to be in session\r\nfrom the commencement of one regular session of the legislature to\r\nthe commencement of the next. It was given power to prepare and\r\nbring forward a complete legislative program, including a budget of\r\nappropriations for the coming legislative session, and to establish\r\na legislative reference bureau. It was given power to investigate\r\nthe administration of any department of the state government and the\r\nexpenditure of any appropriation made by the General Assembly. Such a\r\nplan was admirably designed to increase the power of the legislature\r\nby centralizing in its leaders power and authority to present a\r\ncomprehensive and matured program before the legislature convened. At\r\nthe same time it conferred no additional power over legislation upon\r\nthe governor. On the contrary, it, in a mild way, actually attempted to\r\nsecure additional control over the executive power. The mere existence\r\nof a standing legislative commission composed of the leaders of the\r\nlegislature, with power at any time to _investigate the administration\r\nof any department of the state government_ or the expenditure of any\r\nmoney appropriated, was a continuing menace to the present executive\r\nisolation and irresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThe plan evidently met with determined opposition from the executive,\r\nfor in the House it was amended so as to provide four members from\r\nthe Senate and House instead of five, and these were to be _appointed\r\nby the governor_. The power of investigation by the commission was\r\nrestricted to such as it was called upon to make by the governor, the\r\nGeneral Assembly, or either house, and the power to investigate the\r\nadministration of any department of the state government was entirely\r\nomitted. In this form the bill became one which would vastly increase\r\nthe governor’s power by delivering into his hands the authority of the\r\ncommission and giving him recognized administration members of the\r\nlegislature. A deadlock ensued between the House and the Senate, and\r\nthe bill as finally passed contained a provision only for establishing\r\na legislative reference bureau. In the contest over the original plan\r\nand the house modifications we have a clear-cut recognition of the\r\nnecessity of bringing the governor and the legislature nearer together.\r\nWe also have presented a sharp dispute as to whether the governor\r\nshall have added to his power further authority over the promotion\r\nof legislation or whether the legislature shall increase its power\r\nby organization, and at the same time secure some control, if not an\r\nactual domination, over the executive power.\r\n\r\nIt is rather startling that in all the above proposals which look\r\ntoward the closer relation of the executive and legislative powers we\r\nshould find a strong tendency toward the increasing of the power of the\r\nsingle executive by giving him greater control over the legislative\r\npower. Historically the effort has constantly been to break down the\r\npower of the single executive. True, the executive in such cases was\r\nnot subject to the electorate at frequent intervals. But frequent\r\nelections may not protect the governed from a vast number of errors\r\nof judgment and smaller tyrannies, executive oppression and bad\r\nappointments, which do not become a matter of general knowledge or make\r\na considerable issue before the electorate. Good executive government\r\nin the sense of one which is just and fair, well balanced, seeking\r\nimprovements, and acting conscientiously in lesser affairs, comes more\r\ncertainly from a small committee of experienced leaders than from a\r\nsingle man. The exchange of views by such a body and the reaction of\r\none member upon another has a value which cannot be estimated. The\r\nsingle executive on the other hand is likely to have no fixed set of\r\nresponsible advisers. He is too frequently swayed by the advice of the\r\nlast man who reaches his ear.\r\n\r\nIn making constitutions it is quite as easy to unite the executive\r\nand legislative powers by giving the control of the executive power\r\nto a majority of the legislature as it is to hand the control of the\r\nlegislative power over to the single executive. From the point of view\r\nof expediency there is much to be said of the plan which places the\r\ncontrol of the executive power in the hands of the legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] Joint resolution 4A, introduced June 16, 1913.\r\n\r\n[19] These were furnished to the author by Mr. U. S. U’Ren of Oregon\r\nCity, Oregon. One is in the form of a letter dated December 28, 1911,\r\nasking for criticisms on the draft of constitutional changes. The\r\nother is in the form of an initiative petition for the submission of\r\nparticular constitutional amendments (being a part of the entire plan\r\nof changes) for adoption by the electorate.\r\n\r\n[20] “The power of the governor to promote initiative and referendum\r\npetitions is not, however, increased by the suggested amendment. He\r\nhas now the same rights in this as a private citizen but no official\r\npowers” (comment of U. S. U’Ren).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND-CHAMBER PROBLEM[21]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe institution of private property is still with us and likely\r\nto remain for some time. The acquisition and holding of private\r\nproperty is still the main object of our existence and doubtless will\r\ncontinue to be so. It is privately held property which pays taxes\r\nand supports the state. In any government property is entitled to\r\nfair consideration and protection. Special differentiated classes\r\nof property, such as railroads and other public-service plants,\r\nmanufacturing interests, mines, and landlords’ and farmers’ holdings\r\nare entitled to fair consideration and protection. Indeed, the state\r\nthat permitted indiscriminate assaults upon private property or upon\r\ndifferentiated classes of private property could not long endure.\r\nCertainly its prosperity would be short-lived. These premises have not\r\nbeen questioned in the past. Not many in this day would be found to\r\ncontrovert them.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of demand, then, was there, when our state governments\r\nwere first organized, for governmental arrangements suitable to\r\nprotect property interests? How was that demand answered in our\r\nmid-nineteenth-century plans of government? What is the character of\r\nthat same demand today and how do our present governmental arrangements\r\nanswer it? These are important inquiries preliminary to our ultimate\r\nquestion: How are property interests to be protected when the\r\nprinciples of the commission form of government are applied to the\r\nstate?\r\n\r\nIt is the object of this chapter to attempt to answer in outline these\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nOur federal government was established in a territory which was mostly\r\na wilderness, with a fringe of frontier and colonial communities\r\non the Atlantic seaboard. Whenever a state government has been\r\nfirst established, the territory of which it has been composed has\r\nbeen either wholly or very largely of a frontier character. In such\r\ncommunities opportunity was abundant and pretty much equal to all.\r\nMen started with not much advantage except that with which nature\r\nhad endowed them. The differences in wealth were not such as to be\r\nbeyond the hope of most men to bridge in a lifetime. The population\r\nwas controlled by a community of feeling and a certain similarity of\r\noccupation. In such a society any attack upon property interests was\r\nbound to come home to too many to make such an attack possible. The\r\npractical danger was that states would permit the resident debtor class\r\nto repudiate its obligations to a non-resident creditor class. This was\r\nheaded off by the very practical provision of the federal constitution\r\nthat no state should pass any law impairing the obligation of\r\ncontracts. Apart from this the governmental devices adopted to protect\r\nproperty interests were largely theoretical and academic. They were for\r\nthe most part directed to preventing all sudden legislative action.\r\nLegislation must in every case be the result of “sober second thought.”\r\nNo distinction was made between legislation which affected property\r\ninterests and any other sort. The safeguards for securing the “sober\r\nsecond thought” of the electorate or legislature were as applicable to\r\nthe most trivial legislative matters as to the most important. Thus we\r\nhave the separation of the legislature into two houses. The members\r\nof both are elected. The only difference is that the number of the\r\nupper house is smaller and the term a little longer. We have also the\r\nlimited veto power of the governor. Although not in terms provided for\r\nin our constitution, it has become a part of our scheme of government\r\nthat the courts shall exercise the power of declaring void acts of the\r\nlegislature which are forbidden by the written constitution. As these\r\nwritten constitutions have contained almost universally the provision\r\nthat “no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property\r\nwithout due process of law,” the courts have had the power to declare\r\nvoid acts of the legislature which they deemed to be a taking of the\r\n“liberty” or “property” of any person “without due process of law.”\r\nWhen exercised this power has amounted in effect to a judicial veto.\r\nIf the court deem the act in question to have been forbidden by the\r\nconstitution the act is invalid until such time as the constitution\r\nshall have been changed and the general prohibition eliminated, at\r\nleast so far as the offending act in question is concerned. It was,\r\nhowever, only the taking “_without due process of law_” which was\r\nforbidden. But legislation was itself “due process of law” unless it\r\nwas arbitrary and irrational in its operation.[22] Thus an act which\r\nforbade the consumption of liquor by red-haired persons and which\r\nimposed a fine for the offense would be arbitrary and irrational in its\r\napplication, and the imposition of a fine pursuant to the act would\r\nbe a taking of the property of the individual without due process of\r\nlaw. But more than this, the arbitrary character of the legislative act\r\nmust be clear beyond all reasonable doubt.[23] It must be so clear\r\nthat two rational men could not differ about the matter.[24] These\r\nwere the limits of the power of the court as originally laid down. It\r\nis apparent that with these limitations conscientiously observed the\r\nveto power of the court over legislation was of largely theoretical\r\nand academic value in protecting property interests. The fact is that\r\nthis power of the courts to declare laws unconstitutional because they\r\ntook some person’s life, liberty, or property without due process of\r\nlaw remained practically unused during the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Perhaps there was no call for the protection of property\r\ninterests from the legislature. Perhaps the limitations upon the\r\nexercise of the power of the court were too faithfully observed. It is\r\nnot unlikely that both reasons contributed to the results.\r\n\r\nBefore 1860 the Atlantic seaboard states ceased to be provincial or\r\nfrontier communities. Since 1860 an enormous area in the Mississippi\r\nValley has ceased to be a frontier community. Great cities have arisen.\r\nWhole states have been brought under cultivation. Manufacturing has\r\nconstantly gone forward. Facility in transportation has diminished\r\nthe size of the country twenty-fold in many areas. The increase in\r\nthe value and quantity of private property has been fabulous. So\r\nenormous an increase in so short a time has necessarily resulted in\r\nthe concentration of immense fortunes in the hands of a considerable\r\nnumber of individuals. Even more marked has been the concentration\r\nof collective property holdings in corporations. The financial\r\ndifference between persons of some property and those with vast\r\nfortunes is so great that the bridging of the gap by even the\r\nexceptional individual in his lifetime is out of the question. The\r\nfinancial difference between the position of persons possessing some\r\nproperty and the collective wealth of great corporations is beyond\r\nthe actual comprehension of the human intelligence. Opportunity is\r\nno longer anywhere near equal and many start the race in life with a\r\nlead which puts them out of sight of all but a very few. The result\r\nis that a constantly increasing number of people think not in terms\r\nof property and the interests of property, but as individuals, and in\r\nmany instances as one of a collection of individuals. They have begun\r\nto consider whether the state is so run and legislation so framed\r\nthat they as individuals, or as one of a collective organization of\r\nindividuals similarly situated, are enabled to live satisfactorily.\r\nThey are readily inclined to believe that specially organized property\r\ninterests are attempting to make the laws, or to block the making\r\nof laws in the interests of property and against the interests of\r\nthe individual, either singly or in organized groups. Such specially\r\norganized property interests have become liable to persistent and\r\nsometimes vicious and retaliatory attacks by a majority of the\r\nelectorate. The fact that this majority is composed of persons who\r\nare, to some extent, holders of property does not prevent them from\r\nthinking in terms of their position as individuals. Thus spectacular\r\nonslaughts by the electorate have been made upon such organized\r\nproperty interests as railroads, public-service corporations, and\r\nmine-owners. Legislation to promote social justice and in the actual\r\nor pretended exercise of the police power may be in effect an attack\r\nupon some legitimate business. Yet the general object of such acts will\r\nreceive an overwhelming popular approval.\r\n\r\nStep by step with the development of this antagonism in the state\r\nbetween specially organized property interests and the individual has\r\ngrown the effort of such interests to combine for protection from the\r\nelectorate. Naturally they use all the means at their disposal in the\r\ngovernmental scheme to secure that protection. The governor’s veto,\r\nhowever, has proved of less and less value, for the governor is so\r\nconspicuous an officer as frequently to be a popular choice. Property\r\ninterests have fallen back upon the legislative lobby, an alliance\r\nwith the extra-legal government, and the constant urging of the courts\r\nto go farther and farther in the exercise of their veto power over\r\nlegislation. The lobby has gained power through the assistance and\r\nsanction of the leaders of the extra-legal government. That government\r\nhas been stimulated to the highest efficiency and the greatest\r\nactivity by reason of the prizes coming to its leaders as the result\r\nof their alliance and partnership with collectively organized property\r\ninterests. As a last resort the courts have again and again been\r\nimportuned to veto legislation inimical to specially organized property\r\ninterests, and all property interests when attacked at once become\r\nspecially organized at the point of attack. These importunities come in\r\nthe form of arguments to the court on behalf of property interests that\r\nare unfavorably affected by the legislation in question. Frequently\r\nthe act which they complain of has been badly drawn and is really\r\nvicious and unfair in some of its workings, although the main principle\r\nmay be sound. This intensifies the appeal of the individual for its\r\noverthrow. Such complaints from the interests affected, together with\r\nthe social and economic theories of the judges themselves, and no doubt\r\nin some cases, the direct influence of the extra-legal government,\r\nhave been pressed upon the judges in an effort to cause them to\r\nabandon the academic, theoretical, and bloodless function which was\r\nconceded to them when the power of the courts to declare acts of the\r\nlegislature unconstitutional originally was asserted, and to expand\r\nthis power so as to present an efficient barrier to the onslaughts\r\nof the proletariat upon property interests. At times and to a very\r\nconsiderable extent state courts have yielded to this pressure. It is\r\nthe demand of specially organized property interests for protection\r\nand fair treatment and the inclination of the courts to give it that\r\nhas presented in the last thirty years so long a list in every state\r\nof legislative acts held unconstitutional because they took the\r\nliberty or property of some person without due process of law.[25]\r\nIt is, no doubt, the desire of these same property interests that the\r\nclause of the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution, which\r\nprovides that “no state shall pass any law depriving any person of\r\nlife, liberty, or property without due process of law,” may in the\r\nhands of the United States Supreme Court afford the same practical and\r\neffective protection to property interests which similar clauses in\r\nthe state constitutions have done through the action of state supreme\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\nSuch is the actual situation into which it is now proposed to project\r\nalterations in our scheme of government which will eliminate\r\nextra-legal government by politocrats and thereby lessen, if not\r\nentirely do away with, the lobby which is backed by the extra-legal\r\ngovernment. The same changes are to give us a single legislative\r\nchamber which shall be really representative, highly sensitive, and\r\nquickly responsive to the popular will. Very naturally property\r\ninterests, particularly those most frequently subject to legislative\r\nattack, will wish to know how they are to be protected from the\r\nonslaughts of the proletariat or from the hasty judgments of an\r\nordinarily conservative and fair majority. Property can point to\r\nthe fact that the commonwealth under Cromwell gave up the single\r\nlegislative chamber and reverted to the bicameral plan;[26] that\r\nthe single chamber adopted by the French Constitution of 1791 was\r\nabandoned for a bicameral arrangement in 1795, and never again, except\r\nfor a brief space under the Second Republic of 1848, did France\r\nrenew the experiment. It can point to the opinions of Mill,[27]\r\nLecky,[28] Maine,[29] Bagehot,[30] and Sidgwick[31] in favor of the\r\nsecond-chamber plan and to the well-nigh universal practice of such\r\na method of constituting the legislature. Furthermore, the second\r\nchambers established outside of the United States and perhaps Australia\r\nhave in practice acted on the whole as the representatives of property\r\ninterests and the protectors of those interests from the acts of the\r\npopular house. These experiences may contain no lesson for us and the\r\nopinions referred to may be hopelessly reactionary, but they would at\r\nleast seem to justify property in humbly asking what is to be done to\r\nprotect it from the actions of the single popular legislative chamber\r\nin which is united the executive and legislative power.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways at least of meeting this question:\r\n\r\nThe first is to do nothing at all. Property is to be persuaded that it\r\nis in the long run entirely safe at the hands of a legislature which\r\nis really expressive of the will of the majority and sensitive to that\r\nwill; that property has money with which to advocate its cause and\r\ncan buy newspapers, circulate pamphlets, and hire speakers; that the\r\nmass of the electorate are in general entirely fair and conservative\r\ntoward property; that property is protected by the courts and by\r\nconstitutional provisions prohibiting the taking of property without\r\ndue process of law from sudden and violent legislative action.\r\n\r\nThis attitude will, however, hardly satisfy property interests. How\r\nthey will be treated by a single legislative chamber representing the\r\npopular will cannot be determined till the experiment is actually\r\ntried. All a priori views are merely speculative opinions made up\r\nfrom data wholly incomplete and inconclusive. Property interests\r\nwill naturally regard it as unfair that they should take the risk of\r\na new experiment in government. Nor will property be satisfied with\r\nprotection by the courts as now constituted. The fact that judges are\r\nfor the most part elected by popular vote, that the recall of judges\r\nand of judicial decisions is being violently advocated, will hardly\r\ntend to reassure property in the protection from the electorate by the\r\ncourts to which it believes itself fairly entitled.\r\n\r\nThe second method of meeting the demand of property for protection\r\nfrom the single popular legislative chamber is to give it a direct\r\nrepresentation in the legislature and a voice in the enactment of the\r\nlaws at the time they are in the process of making. The representatives\r\nof property should have power to propose legislation, to amend that\r\nwhich comes from the popular legislative chamber, and to enter into\r\ncompromises respecting it. They should have in addition at least a\r\nlimited veto on the passage of laws. The exercise of such powers\r\nshould be open and legal, but at the same time entirely subordinate\r\nto the power of the representatives of the electorate in the single\r\npopular chamber. This requires the establishment of a second\r\nlegislative chamber in which the representatives of property interests\r\nshall sit.\r\n\r\nThe most direct method of constituting such a second chamber is to\r\ndivide the state into as many senatorial districts as there are to be\r\nmembers of the second chamber--let us say one-fourth of the number of\r\nthe popular house. The districts should be created on the basis of an\r\nequal amount of taxable property in each. One representative should\r\nbe sent from each district. One vote should be given each taxpayer in\r\nthe district who during the preceding year had paid a given amount or\r\nless in taxes. Each taxpayer should have one vote in addition for each\r\nsimilar amount which he paid in taxes, and should vote as a taxpayer,\r\nwhether a corporation or a non-resident citizen of the United States.\r\nIt might be desirable to elect the senators at large from a few\r\ndistricts, the voting by taxpayers to be according to the Hare plan,\r\nthus allowing groups of taxpayers to send their representatives.\r\n\r\nA less direct method would be to fill the second chamber with members\r\nholding for life and appointed by the executive council of state.\r\nThe natural tendency of such a life tenure of office, coupled with\r\nappointment from among successful men, is to produce a conservative\r\nsecond chamber. If, however, one party is in power for a long period\r\nit also results in the packing of the second chamber by one party for\r\nits own purposes and this brings renewed party strife and legislative\r\ndeadlocks.[32] Such a second chamber will, however, in the long run, it\r\nis believed, represent property interests.\r\n\r\nIt would be, of course, of vital importance that a second chamber\r\nconstituted in either of the above ways be kept in strict subordination\r\nto the chamber which represents the electorate at large. The principal\r\nmeans for accomplishing this has already been provided for in the plan\r\nfor the union of the executive and legislative functions in the lower\r\nhouse. The fact that the entire executive power of the state is placed\r\nin the hands of the leaders of the legislative majority of the lower\r\nhouse must always make that the more powerful organ of government. But\r\nwe can go farther. It may be provided that the second chamber shall\r\nnever have the right to reject an appropriation bill. This will prevent\r\nits ever interfering with the conduct of the government through the\r\ncollection of taxes and the expenditure of money. Then a suitable\r\nmethod of “steam-rollering” the second chamber with regard to the\r\npassage of legislation may be provided as follows:\r\n\r\n After the rejection of any bill passed by the lower house in two\r\n successive sessions, the vote upon such bill shall be taken, with both\r\n branches of the legislature sitting in joint session and a majority of\r\n the votes in such joint session shall be sufficient to give the bill\r\n the effect of law.\r\n\r\nBy such devices the second chamber representing property interests as\r\nsuch will have been given only a properly limited veto power upon\r\nlegislation. At the same time, as a second chamber, it will have power\r\nto approve that which passes the popular house and to enter into\r\ncompromises respecting it. The second chamber can undertake a popular\r\ndefense of its action. These are important privileges. They aid in the\r\nproduction of laws which are fair to all. On the other hand, the second\r\nchamber is equally clearly cut off from ever gaining any ascendancy\r\nover that branch of the legislature which represents and is sensitive\r\nto the popular will.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, in the establishment of a second chamber representing\r\nproperty interests proceed with still greater indirectness and the\r\nutmost caution along a path on which we are already started.\r\n\r\nOur highest state judicial tribunal is already possessed of a\r\nsubstantial veto upon legislation in the interests of property by\r\nreason of its power to declare acts of the legislature void because\r\nthey take property “without due process of law.” There are few, if\r\nany, constitutions today in the United States which do not contain\r\nother prohibitions upon the legislature under which acts may be\r\ndeclared unconstitutional in the interests of property. The courts\r\nhave already gone beyond the mere academic function of declaring acts\r\nof the legislature void only when they are utterly irrational and\r\narbitrary in their discriminatory operation. The courts now boldly\r\nperform the function of protecting property from hasty, ill-advised,\r\nand unjust legislation. Heretofore, at least, public opinion has\r\nsustained the courts in the exercise of this function. The placing\r\nof this power in the hands of judges has insured its exercise by men\r\nwho at least are not prejudiced against property and are inclined to\r\ngive it a fair hearing. Judges must be selected from among lawyers,\r\nand hence must be men of some education and intellectual attainments.\r\nSince the main business of judges is to decide litigated cases arising\r\nbetween individuals, there is very naturally a demand that judges be\r\nselected from among the leaders at the bar. This means that there is\r\na constant and legitimate pressure in favor of the selection of men\r\nwho will naturally give property as full protection as the power of\r\nthe court will permit. Even lawyers of only fair success and ability\r\nin fifteen or twenty years of practice will acquire the property point\r\nof view. Practically all lawyers live in an atmosphere of enforcement\r\nof property interests. They cannot avoid being educated to see the\r\nunfairness of legislation which affects unfavorably property interests.\r\nIt is not improbable that among those who secure seats in the highest\r\ncourt some will regard themselves as specially appointed to stand\r\nbetween property and the proletariat, and will do so with great\r\ndetermination, vigor, and judicial independence. Once selected, the\r\njudge in our highest courts holds for a longer term than other judges,\r\nand this fact fortifies him in a determination that property interests\r\nshall be dealt with fairly. All this has been accomplished without the\r\nelectorate at large fully perceiving what has happened. The voter is\r\nstill submissive to the apparently fair proposition that only lawyers\r\nof excellent standing and ability should be elected to the highest\r\ncourt of the state. Little does he understand that success in selecting\r\nsuch men has established the rudiments of a second chamber which is\r\ndesigned to protect property.\r\n\r\nThe present arrangement, however, is on the verge of some\r\nreorganization. It is plain that the judicial veto is too drastic.\r\nIt may stop all desired legislation along a given line till the\r\nconstitution is changed. The difficulties of securing the desired\r\namendment may not be surmounted for many years. Hence has arisen the\r\nplan for “steam-rollering” the judicial veto by a constitutional\r\nprovision that whenever an act of the legislature has been passed\r\nat two different sessions and sustained by the electorate upon a\r\nreferendum, it shall be deemed not to infringe the “life, liberty, and\r\nproperty” clause of the state constitution.[33] The electorate today\r\nis also becoming increasingly alive to the fact that the courts, in\r\nholding legislation unconstitutional, have really abandoned a purely\r\njudicial function and have undertaken in a degree the political\r\nfunction of a second chamber in protecting property interests from the\r\nlegislature. True, the action of the court is in form still judicial.\r\nIt purports to apply the constitutional prohibition to the legislation\r\ninvolved in the particular litigated case arising between contending\r\nparties. But the court’s decision, once made, is now acquiesced in\r\nby all departments of the government and all public officers, as a\r\ncomplete disposition of the act held void. The compiler of the statutes\r\nomits it from the compiled laws as being no law at all. The court\r\ndoes in fact veto out of existence an act of the legislature for the\r\nentire state government and the inhabitants of the state. It does this\r\nalso in response to a very general prohibition upon the legislature,\r\nsuch as that “no person shall be deprived of property without due\r\nprocess of law”--a phrase so vague that it gives the court a discretion\r\nwhich approaches that of the legislature in considering whether a\r\nproposed act is wise and fair to property or not. The disclosure to\r\nthe electorate that courts, in using their judicial veto, are really\r\nexercising a great political power has resulted in an increasing\r\ndemand that judges should be elected as political officers; that\r\ntheir economic and social bias be known--in short, that they have a\r\npolitico-judicial platform and be subject to the recall.\r\n\r\nThe tendency thus disclosed to treat the judges of our highest courts\r\nas political officers whose social and economic bias regarding\r\nlegislation must be known in advance is, of course, ruinous to the\r\nperformance of their ordinary judicial functions. The electorate will\r\nobtain what it wants, and perhaps what it may be entitled to, from the\r\njudges, but at the expense of the disruption of the whole judicial\r\nsystem. That would indeed be a calamity. Disorganization in the\r\nadministration of justice, due to the popular attitude toward judges\r\nand the courts, is even now beginning to be felt. It will very soon\r\nbecome apparent that in the rebuilding of our judicial system courts\r\nwhich handle the general mass of litigation must be confined strictly\r\nto judicial functions. They must administer the law as established by\r\nthe legislature and always in subordination to the legislature. If,\r\nthen, we are to keep our present plan of protecting property by means\r\nof a court and a constitution, a special court of last resort must be\r\nestablished for deciding all constitutional questions, the validity\r\nof all municipal ordinances, and all other classes of cases where\r\nthe issue is drawn between the electorate acting through a popular\r\nlegislative body, and property interests. In order that the veto of the\r\ncourt may not be too drastic in its effect, there should be given to\r\nthe single chamber legislature the power to “steam-roller” its judicial\r\nveto by a second passage of the act after a suitable interval and its\r\napproval on a referendum. Thus we shall have evolved a practicable\r\nsecond chamber protecting property interests.\r\n\r\nIt would be only a short step to provide for the submission of all\r\nacts to such a court before they became laws, with a right on the part\r\nof litigants to bring up the question of the validity of the acts as\r\nupon a rehearing. Then it would seem most reasonable that when an act\r\nwas presented to the special court of appeal before it became law and\r\nfound to be unconstitutional, the court should have power to redraft\r\nthe act so that it would accomplish what was desired so far as the\r\nsame was permitted by the constitution. If ultimately the right of\r\nlitigants to attack the validity of any act which had passed both the\r\nlegislature and the court should be cut off, and if the constitutional\r\nlimitations upon the legislature should entirely disappear, while at\r\nthe same time the members of the body which scrutinized the acts passed\r\nby the popular chamber were appointed by the council of state and held\r\noffice for a considerable period, we should have, in what started as a\r\njudicial tribunal, a real second chamber functioning like other second\r\nchambers in furnishing an additional security against legislation which\r\nwas unfair to property interests.[34]\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of the present writer to advocate either the\r\nsecond chamber representing property interests or the establishment\r\nof a unicameral legislature in which all legislative and executive\r\npowers are united and which is extremely sensitive to the popular will\r\nwithout any special protection to property interests other than that\r\nwhich their numerical strength and property holding gives them. It is\r\nenough that the difficulties of the situation be faced and the several\r\ngeneral lines of procedure be indicated. It will be time enough to have\r\nopinions when we are brought, by constitution-making, nearer to the\r\npractical settlement of the difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Much of the argument in this volume is in support of the Short\r\nBallot movement. It is only fair to say, however, that the leaders of\r\nthis movement in the National Short Ballot Organization dissent from\r\nthe suggestions put forward in this chapter as to the need of special\r\nprotection to property interests, and the methods suggested of working\r\nout such special protection are, therefore, no part of the Short Ballot\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\n[22] _Hurtado_ v. _California_, 110 U.S. 516.\r\n\r\n[23] James Bradley Thayer, “The Origin and Scope of the American\r\nDoctrine of Constitutional Law,” 7 _Harv. Law Rev._, 129, 139 ff.\r\n\r\n[24] “The validity of a law ought not, then, to be questioned, unless\r\nit is so obviously repugnant to the constitution, that when pointed out\r\nby the judges, all men of sense and reflection in the community may\r\nperceive the repugnancy.”--Per Chancellor Waties in _Adm’rs of Byrne_\r\nv. _Adm’rs of Stewart_, 3 Des. 466 (South Carolina, 1812).\r\n\r\n[25] The results reached by the Illinois Supreme Court, especially\r\nwhen contrasted with those reached by the United States Supreme Court,\r\nexhibit an extreme exercise of the power of courts to hold legislation\r\nvoid because it takes the property or liberty of individuals without\r\ndue process of law.\r\n\r\nSince 1886 the Illinois Supreme Court has held void acts of the\r\nlegislature compelling mine-owners to weigh coal mined and to pay\r\nthe miners on the basis of such weight, because such acts took the\r\nmine-owner’s liberty and property without due process of law contrary\r\nto the provisions of the state constitution: _Millett_ v. _The People_,\r\n117 Ill. 294 (1896); _Ramsey_ v. _The People_, 142 Ill. 380 (1892);\r\n_Harding_ v. _The People_, 160 Ill. 459 (1896). The United States\r\nSupreme Court, however, has held that a similar act from Arkansas did\r\nnot violate the “life, liberty, or property” clause of the fourteenth\r\namendment: _McLean_ v. _Arkansas_, 211 U.S. 539 (1908).\r\n\r\nSince 1892 the Illinois Supreme Court has held void state acts\r\nregulating the keeping of truck stores by owners of coal mines and\r\nfactories, because they deprived such owners of liberty and property\r\nwithout due process of law, contrary to the state constitution:\r\n_Frorer_ v. _The People_, 141 Ill. 171 (1892); _Kellyville Coal Co._\r\nv. _Harrier_, 207 Ill. 624 (1904). In 1886 the Pennsylvania Supreme\r\nCourt held void an act which prohibited the payment of wages to miners\r\nin anything but money: _Godcharles_ v. _Wigeman_, 113 Pa. 431 (1886).\r\nYet the United States Supreme Court holds that such acts are not in\r\nviolation of the “life, liberty, or property” clause of the fourteenth\r\namendment: _Knoxville Coal Co._ v. _Harrison_, 183 U.S. 13 (1901).\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the Illinois Supreme Court held void the barbers’ Sunday\r\nlaw, which forbade the employment of barbers on Sunday, because the\r\nact violated the “life, liberty, or property” clause of the state\r\nconstitution: _Eden_ v. _The People_, 161 Ill. 296 (1896). But the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court sustained a like act from Minnesota,\r\ndeclaring that it did not violate the “life, liberty, or property”\r\nclause of the federal constitution: _Petit_ v. _Minnesota_, 177 U.S.\r\n164 (1898).\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the Illinois Supreme Court held void the state flag law which\r\nprohibited the use of the American flag for advertising purposes,\r\nbecause it deprived advertisers of liberty and property without due\r\nprocess of law, contrary to the provision of the state constitution:\r\n_Ruhstrat_ v. _The People_, 185 Ill. 133 (1900). The United States\r\nSupreme Court, however, sustained a similar act from Nebraska holding\r\nthat it was not in violation of the “life, liberty, or property” clause\r\nof the fourteenth amendment: _Halter_ v. _Nebraska_, 205 U.S. 34 (1907).\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the Illinois Supreme Court held void the bulk sales acts\r\nregulating sales of stocks of goods in bulk otherwise than in the usual\r\ncourse of trade, because it violated the “life, liberty, or property”\r\nclause of the state constitution: _Off &. Co._ v. _Morehead_, 235\r\nIll. 40 (1908). But the United States Supreme Court has held similar\r\nstatutes from Connecticut and Michigan valid and not in violation of\r\nthe “life, liberty, or property” clause of the fourteenth amendment:\r\n_Lemieux_ v. _Young_, 211 U.S. 489 (1908); _Kidd, Dater & Price Co_. v.\r\n_Musselman Grocer Co._, 217 U.S. 461 (1910).\r\n\r\nIn 1909 the Illinois Supreme Court held void the loan-shark act\r\nregulating the assignment of future wages as security for money\r\nborrowed and requiring the assignment to be recorded and signed by the\r\nwife. Again the reason was that the “life, liberty, or property” clause\r\nof the state constitution was violated: _Massie_ v. _Cessna_, 239 Ill.\r\n352 (1909). But the United States Supreme Court has sustained a similar\r\nact passed in Massachusetts on the ground that it did not infringe\r\nthe “life, liberty, or property” clause of the fourteenth amendment:\r\n_Mutual Loan Company_ v. _Martell_, 222 U.S. 225 (1911).\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Supreme Court has also held void, as infringing the “life,\r\nliberty, or property” clause of the state constitution, the following\r\nacts: (_a_) An act penalizing employers in the importation of workmen\r\nfrom another state by reason of deceit touching the matter of the\r\nexistence of a strike or the sanitary condition of the employment:\r\n_Josma_ v. _Western Steel Car Co._, 249 Ill. 508 (1911); compare,\r\nhowever, _Williams_ v. _Fears_, 179 U.S. 270; (_b_) An act providing\r\nthat no public contractor shall employ alien labor on any public\r\nwork: _City of Chicago_ v. _Hulbert_, 205 Ill. 346 (1903). But in\r\n_Atkin_ v. _Kansas_, 191 U.S. 207 (1903), the United States Supreme\r\nCourt held valid an act of Kansas making it a criminal offense for a\r\npublic contractor to permit or require an employee to perform labor\r\nupon public work in excess of eight hours each day; (_c_) The miners’\r\nwashroom act, requiring owners of mines to provide a washroom at the\r\ntop of the mine for the use of the miners: _Starne_ v. _The People_,\r\n222 Ill. 189 (1906); (_d_) An act prohibiting more than six persons\r\nsleeping in one room in a lodging-house: _Bailey_ v. _The People_,\r\n190 Ill. 28 (1901); (_e_) An act prescribing an eight-hour day for\r\nwomen in certain occupations: _Ritchie_ v. _The People_, 155 Ill. 98\r\n(1895). This case was approved in _Ritchie_ v. _Wayman_, 244 Ill. 509\r\n(1911), which, however, held a ten-hour labor law for women in certain\r\noccupations valid, following the ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court\r\nsustaining a similar act passed in Oregon: _Muller_ v. _Oregon_, 208\r\nU.S. 412 (1908). It seems entirely probable from its opinion in the\r\nlast-mentioned case that the United States Supreme Court would have\r\nheld valid the act condemned by the Illinois Supreme Court in _Ritchie_\r\nv. _The People_, _supra_.\r\n\r\n[26] “The proposal for a revived Second Chamber was, on the contrary,\r\ncarried with an unexpected degree of unanimity. The Protector pressed\r\nit strongly upon the officers. ‘I tell you,’ he said, ‘that unless you\r\nhave some such thing as a balance we cannot be safe. Either you will\r\nencroach upon our civil liberties by excluding such as are elected to\r\nserve in Parliament--next time for aught I know you may exclude four\r\nhundred--or they will encroach upon our religious liberty. By the\r\nproceedings of this Parliament you see they stand in need of a check or\r\nbalancing power, for the case of James Naylor might happen to be your\r\ncase. By the same law and reason they punished Naylor they might punish\r\nan Independent or an Anabaptist. By their judicial power they fall upon\r\nlife and member, and doth the Instrument enable me to control it? This\r\nInstrument of Government will not do your work.’”--J. A. R. Marriott,\r\n_Second Chambers_, p. 38.\r\n\r\n[27] “A majority in a single assembly, when it has assumed a permanent\r\ncharacter--when composed of the same persons habitually acting\r\ntogether, and always assured of victory in their own House--easily\r\nbecomes despotic and overweening, if released from the necessity\r\nof considering whether its acts will be concurred in by another\r\nconstituted authority. The same reason which induced the Romans to have\r\ntwo consuls, makes it desirable there should be two chambers; that\r\nneither of them may be exposed to the corrupting influence of undivided\r\npower, even for the space of a single year.”\r\n\r\n[28] “Of all the forms of government that are possible among mankind I\r\ndo not know any which is likely to be worse than the government of a\r\nsingle omnipotent democratic chamber.”\r\n\r\n[29] “What, then, is expected from a well constituted Second Chamber is\r\n_not a rival infallibility, but an additional security_. It is hardly\r\ntoo much to say that, in this view, almost any Second Chamber is better\r\nthan none.”\r\n\r\n[30] “With a perfect Lower House it is certain that an Upper House\r\nwould be scarcely of any value. If we had an ideal House of Commons\r\nperfectly representing the nation, always moderate, never passionate,\r\nabounding in men of leisure, never omitting the slow and steady forms\r\nnecessary for good consideration, it is certain that we should not need\r\na higher chamber. The work would be done so well that we should not\r\nwant any one to look over or revise it. And whatever is unnecessary\r\nin government, is pernicious.... But though beside an ideal House of\r\nCommons the Lords would be unnecessary, and therefore pernicious,\r\nbeside the actual House a revising and leisured legislature is\r\nextremely useful, if not quite necessary.”\r\n\r\n[31] “The main end for which a Senate is constructed [is] that all\r\nlegislative measures may receive a second consideration by a body\r\n_different in character from the primary representative assembly_, and\r\nif possible superior or supplementary in intellectual qualifications.”\r\n\r\n[32] See J.

Marriott, “History of the Canadian Second Chamber” in\r\n_Second Chambers_, pp. 145 ff.\r\n\r\n[33] The phrase “recall of judicial decisions” is unfortunate, since it\r\nimplies that the judicial function is taken over by the electorate and\r\nthe judicial decision reversed, when all that is done is to amend the\r\nconstitution so that the basis for the judicial decision is taken away\r\nin all subsequent litigation. The better phrase, it is believed, is the\r\none used in the text, namely, “steam-rollering the judicial veto.” See\r\nAlbert M. Kales, “The Recall of Judicial Decisions,” _Illinois State\r\nBar Association Proceedings_, 1912, pp. 203-18; Herbert Pope, “The\r\nRecall of Judicial Decisions--A Criticism,” 7 _Illinois Law Review_, p.\r\n149.\r\n\r\n[34] Ramsay Muir, in _Peers and Bureaucrats_, has a suggestion for\r\na second chamber that should not be ignored. He finds the evil of a\r\npopular chamber containing a large number of representatives from\r\nwieldy districts selected by pluralities merely to be that it makes\r\ngovernment by party a necessity. The parties tend to form themselves\r\ninto two great camps, with two great programs. The electorate has been\r\ndriven to choose one program or the other, though if all shades of\r\nopinion could be examined some part of each program would not receive\r\na majority of votes. Party discipline, however, becomes so strict that\r\nthe first chamber can put through every part of the party program. The\r\nreal need in the second chamber, he declares, is to secure members of\r\nindependent views who can express their opinions freely without fear\r\nof the loss of their seat as a punishment for having been independent,\r\nand which will represent the different shades of opinion on the part of\r\nthe electorate. He, therefore, advocates the selection of members of\r\nthe second chamber by the method of proportional representation by the\r\nsingle transferable vote according to the Hare plan.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with this proposal is that property interests as such\r\nare not represented except according to the numerical strength of\r\nproperty owners. In fact, Mr. Muir expressly repudiates any idea of\r\ncreating a second chamber based upon an aristocracy or the middle\r\nclass of income taxpayers. His plan might also be expected to involve\r\na contest as to which chamber really represented the electorate. The\r\nsecond chamber as proposed by Mr. Muir would certainly be a “rival\r\ninfallibility” and hopeless deadlocks might be expected. There would\r\nthen be the usual American spectacle of bickering between the executive\r\nas represented by the executive council or cabinet of the first\r\nchamber, and the second chamber representing the electorate. On the\r\nwhole the union of the executive and the legislative powers so much to\r\nbe desired would be broken in upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF SELECTING AND RETIRING JUDGES\r\n\r\n\r\nJustice is not administered by an executive head planning how a large\r\nnumber of employees shall do clerical work or tend machines. Its\r\nultimate source is in the operation of the mind of the judge upon\r\ncertain facts presented to him in a judicial investigation. The power\r\nof the state to preserve order and settle the rights of parties is\r\nsubject to be invoked in one way or another, according as the judge’s\r\nmind reacts and operates. Clearly, therefore, the way in which the\r\nminds are selected for this important public duty and the way they are\r\nretired is of the first importance to the due administration of justice.\r\n\r\nIt may be that in some frontier or sparsely settled rural districts\r\nwhere extra-legal government does not exist, judges are in a degree\r\nreally elected by the people. It may be that in such communities the\r\nelectorate does actually pick out that one among the lawyers whom it\r\nwishes to act as judge.\r\n\r\nThere may be other communities which are well satisfied with the\r\nresults obtained by special judicial elections at which the candidates\r\nare nominated by petition only and where the ballot is in form\r\nnon-partisan. An analysis of conditions in such communities will\r\nusually show that extra-legal government by politocrats is very weak\r\nor non-existent, and that the power of selecting and retiring judges\r\nreally resides in the lawyers, subject only to the approval of the\r\nelectorate.\r\n\r\nIn a metropolitan district, however, where there is a large population\r\nand a governmental plan which reduces the most intelligent inhabitant\r\nto an extreme degree of political ignorance as a voter, and the\r\nestablishment of extra-legal government by politocrats is thus secured\r\nand fostered and becomes the real government, the judges, though the\r\nelectorate regularly votes to instal them in office, are not in fact\r\nelected at all. They are appointed. The appointing power is lodged with\r\nthe politocrats of the extra-legal government. These men appoint the\r\nnominees. They do it openly and with a certain degree of responsibility\r\nunder the convention system. They do it less openly and with less\r\nresponsibility when primaries are held.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to test the soundness of these conclusions inquire your way\r\nto a judgeship in such a district or listen to the experiences of the\r\nmen who have found their way to a judgeship or have tried to obtain the\r\noffice and failed. In almost every case the story is one of preliminary\r\nservice to the organization, recognition by the local organization\r\nchief, and through him recognition and appointment of a nomination by\r\nthe governing board of the party organization. Those who do not go by\r\nthis road do not get in. The voter only selects which of two or three\r\nappointing powers he prefers. Whichever way he votes he merely approves\r\nan appointment by politocrats.\r\n\r\nThe judges in a metropolitan district where the extra-legal government\r\nrules and where elections for judges are held are not subject\r\nto a recall merely. They are subject to a progressive series of\r\nrecalls. They are subject to recall by the politocrats who sit upon\r\nthe governing board of the party organization. These may refuse a\r\nnomination at the time of an election. If the judge secures the\r\nnomination he may be recalled by a wing of the organization knifing\r\nhim at the polls. He may be, and frequently is, recalled by reason\r\nof an upheaval upon national issues. In the case so rare that it is\r\ndifficult for one with a considerable experience at the bar in a city\r\nlike Chicago to remember it, a judge is actually recalled because of\r\npopular dissatisfaction with him. If there now be added the recall\r\nby popular vote at any time during the judge’s term, we shall have\r\npresented the politocrats with a continuous hold upon the judge. Their\r\npower may at any time be used to initiate recall proceedings against\r\nhim, and the individual without any real popular following will\r\nhave but little chance against the tremendous power of a successful\r\npolitical organization. The recall of a judge by popular vote at any\r\ntime will give a like opportunity to a particular faction of the\r\npolitical organization to attack a judge it does not want. Such a\r\nrecall will likewise give to a party which has a chance of sweeping all\r\nbefore it in a national election an opportunity to initiate a recall\r\nof some at least of the judges of the opposite political party. Of\r\ncourse, the recall election will also give the electorate at large an\r\nopportunity to retire a judge at once in the rare case where there is a\r\nreal popular uprising against him. It does not take any great degree of\r\nintelligence to estimate whether such a recall by popular vote will be\r\nof greater advantage to the extra-legal government by politocrats or to\r\nthe electorate at large.\r\n\r\nThe plain truth is that in a metropolitan district the selection of\r\njudges by some sort of appointing power cannot by any possibility be\r\navoided. The position of a single judge out of as many as thirty and\r\nupward in a district containing an electorate of a hundred thousand\r\nand over is too hidden and obscure to enable any man who is willing to\r\noccupy the place to secure a popular following. The man who has a real\r\nhold upon a majority of so numerous an electorate will inevitably be\r\nled to a candidacy for governor of the state or senator of the United\r\nStates, if not indeed for president of the United States. Another\r\nobstacle to the actual choice of judges by so numerous an electorate\r\nis that the determination of those fit to hold judicial office is\r\nunusually difficult. It would be a problem for a single individual who\r\nhad an extensive personal knowledge of the candidates and had observed\r\nthem closely for a considerable period in the practice of their\r\nprofession. For all but the most exceptional judge in a metropolitan\r\ndistrict the power which places him in office and retires him from\r\noffice will be an appointing power, although there be in force the\r\nso-called popular election of judges. So long as extra-legal government\r\nby politocrats is the real government, that appointing power will be\r\nlodged in the politocrats who wield the power of that government.\r\n\r\nThere are many who sincerely believe that the ideal functioning of the\r\nelectorate in a metropolitan district where the extra-legal government\r\nis strong, may be restored if judges are elected only at special\r\nelections where a judicial ballot is used which omits all designation\r\nof parties and upon which the names of candidates are placed by\r\npetition only and the name of each candidate is rotated upon the ballot\r\nso that it will appear an equal number of times in every position. The\r\nobject of such legislation is to restore a choice by the electorate\r\nby depriving the extra-legal government of its predominant influence\r\nin judicial elections. The means adopted to deprive the extra-legal\r\ngovernment of its influence is to take from it the use of the party\r\ncircle and the party column. It may safely be predicted of such\r\nlegislation that it will not cause judges to be the actual choice of\r\nthe electorate, nor will it eliminate the influence of the politocrats\r\nin judicial elections.\r\n\r\nThe supposition is that if the influence of the politocrats can be\r\neliminated the electorate will necessarily make a real choice. But\r\nthe electorate does not fail to choose simply because the politocrat\r\nhas taken that choice from it. On the contrary, the politocrat rules\r\nbecause the electorate regularly goes to the polls too ignorant\r\npolitically to make a choice of judges. That ignorance is due to the\r\nfact that the office of judge is inconspicuous and the determination of\r\nwho are qualified for the office is unusually difficult, even when an\r\nexpert in possession of all the facts makes the choice. The proposed\r\nmethod of election does not in the least promise to eliminate the\r\nfundamental difficulty of the political ignorance of the electorate.\r\nIf, therefore, it succeeded in eliminating the influence of the\r\nextra-legal government the question would still remain: Who would\r\nselect and retire the judges? There is no reason to believe that the\r\nelectorate would make any real choice. Electors would be just as\r\npolitically ignorant as they were before. They would be just as little\r\nfitted for making a choice as they were before. The elimination of\r\nextra-legal government does not give to the electorate at large the\r\nknowledge required to vote intelligently. Who, then, will select and\r\nretire the judges? The newspapers might have a larger influence, but\r\nthey would probably be very far from exercising a controlling influence\r\nor uniting in such a way as to advise and direct the majority of the\r\nvoters out of an electorate of several hundred thousand how to vote\r\nfor a large number of judges. Special cliques would each be too small\r\nto control a choice and combinations would be too difficult to make.\r\nThe basis of choice would, therefore, be utterly chaotic. There could\r\nbe neither responsibility nor intelligence in the selection of judges.\r\nThe results reached would depend upon chance or upon irresponsible and\r\ntemporary combinations. With every lawyer allowed to put up his name\r\nby petition and chance largely governing the result, the prospect is\r\nhardly encouraging.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe, however, that any such disorganized\r\nmethod of choice would be tolerated. The most potent single power in\r\nelections would end it. That power would be the extra-legal government.\r\nIts organization would be put to greater trouble in advising and\r\ndirecting the politically ignorant how to vote, because it would have\r\nbeen deprived of the party circle and party column. But the advice\r\nand direction could and would be given and followed. Each competitor\r\nfor the power of the successful extra-legal government would have its\r\nslate of candidates. Each would prepare separate printed lists of\r\nits slate to be distributed at the polls and the voter would for the\r\nmost part, as now, take the list of that organization he was loyal to\r\nor feared the most, and vote the names upon it no matter where they\r\nappeared upon the ballot. Thus the appointment and retirement of judges\r\nby the extra-legal government would, after perhaps a period of chaos\r\nand readjustment, again appear. Perhaps it would be even stronger as a\r\nresult of reaction and deliverance from the chaotic conditions which it\r\nrelieved.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to escape the conclusion that in a metropolitan\r\ndistrict with one hundred thousand voters and upward, the selection\r\nof judges by the electorate is practically impossible. It is equally\r\ncertain that the judges in such a community must be selected by some\r\nappointing power. The real and only question is: What is the best\r\nmethod of appointment?\r\n\r\nNo method could be worse than that which we now employ. Appointment by\r\nthe politocrats of the extra-legal government is so obscure, especially\r\nwhen effected by primaries, that they are under no responsibility\r\nwhatever in naming judges and they have little interest in the due\r\nadministration of justice. Indeed, the situation is worse than that,\r\nfor they may have positive reasons for wishing a type of man from\r\nwhom they may expect certain courses of action which will actually be\r\ninimical to the efficient administration of justice, particularly in\r\ncriminal causes; or they may be interested in filling judicial offices\r\nwith those who have done more in the way of faithful service to the\r\norganization than in the way of practice in the courts.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, therefore, suggestions have come from members\r\nof the bar of ways and means for reducing the influence of the\r\nappointing power of the politocrats. It has been suggested that the bar\r\nassociation should be given power to place upon the official ballot\r\na bar-association ticket upon which might appear candidates who had\r\nbeen nominated by any of the other political parties. This would give\r\nthe candidates approved by the bar association and also by any other\r\npolitical party considerable advantage over those appearing in only one\r\nparty column. To that extent it would throw a greater influence into\r\nthe hands of the lawyers. The question, however, has arisen whether\r\nthis would result in a greater power in an unbiased bar association to\r\nselect good judges, or in the lining-up of lawyers in groups which were\r\ncontrolled by the leaders of the politocrats. The effort is frequently\r\nmade to provide that all judges shall be elected at a special judicial\r\nelection. This course may prevent the recall of judges because of an\r\nupheaval on national issues. It does not, however, interfere with the\r\nappointment of a nomination by the politocrats in the first instance.\r\nEven when the nominations are all by petition and the party circle\r\neliminated and the names of candidates rotated upon the ballot, resort\r\nmust still be had to the extra-legal government to escape absolute\r\nchaos and selection by mere chance.\r\n\r\nNothing of great value can be accomplished until it is recognized that\r\nthe judges in a metropolitan district are certain to be appointed and\r\nthat the only proper appointing power is one which is conspicuous,\r\nlegal, subject directly to the electorate, and interested in and\r\nresponsible for the due administration of justice.\r\n\r\nThis principle may be worked out in a variety of ways.\r\n\r\nWhen the state executive as now constituted is given power to appoint\r\ndirectly, or to appoint indirectly by designating the nominees to be\r\nvoted upon, the principle is worked out in one way. There are, no\r\ndoubt, serious objections to both methods of executive appointment. The\r\ngovernor of the state is, of course, in the midst of politics. He is\r\nalso in the midst of a legislative program, and the temptation is very\r\nstrong to trade judicial places for the progress of administration\r\nmeasures in the legislature. Then the governor is not particularly\r\nresponsible for the administration of justice, that being a matter for\r\nthe judicial department rather than the executive. But this much can\r\nbe affirmed, that any mode of appointment by the governor, since it is\r\nconspicuous and legal, and since the governor is directly subject to\r\nthe electorate, carries with it a measure of responsibility which is\r\nnot found where the appointment is secret and by the politocrats of the\r\nextra-legal government. Appointment by the governor is better than the\r\npresent misnamed plan of popular election.\r\n\r\nIt might be suggested that the power of appointment could be lodged in\r\nthe highest appellate tribunal of the state, the members of which had\r\nterms of considerable length, but were subject to election. This again\r\nis, no doubt, open to objections. But again, it could not possibly be\r\na worse method than the one now employed. Judges of such courts are\r\nmore easily than governors made responsible for the due administration\r\nof justice. They would have stronger motives than the governor for\r\nappointing men who could best carry on the administration of justice.\r\nNo body of men in the state has a better opportunity for determining\r\nthe character and ability of lawyers, since they examine the work of\r\nlawyers continually with most minute care.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that vacancies in the judiciary should be filled\r\nby the appointment of the chief justice of the metropolitan district.\r\nHe in turn should be chosen by the electorate of the district at fairly\r\nfrequent intervals--viz., every four or six years--and in him should be\r\nvested large powers to oversee and direct the mode of organizing and\r\nhandling the business of the court.[35]\r\n\r\nThe objection which will at once be raised to this is that it presents\r\nan opportunity for the politocrats to obtain vast power by securing\r\ncontrol of the chief justice. It is not difficult to demonstrate that\r\nthe lodging of the appointing power in the hands of a responsible and\r\nconspicuous chief justice controlled by the politocrats would be much\r\nless inimical to the administration of justice than the appointment\r\nof judges in secret and without responsibility by the politocrats\r\ndirectly. The chief justice would, of course, only fill vacancies\r\noccurring during his short term. The guaranty to the public that such\r\nvacancies would be filled with fairly efficient men lies in the fact\r\nthat enormous responsibility for the due administration of justice\r\nis focused upon a single man. Every complaint of inefficiency and\r\nimpropriety comes home to him. Such a man cannot carry on the work\r\nof the court without the most efficient judges that he can possibly\r\nsecure. This leads necessarily to procuring as judges members of the\r\nbar who have, in a successful practice in the courts, had a proper\r\nservice test. Assuming that such a chief justice were the recognized\r\ndeputy of the politocrats he would be driven by the necessities of\r\nthe case, by the conspicuousness of his position, and the force\r\nof public opinion, to do his utmost to persuade the politocrats to\r\npermit him to appoint efficient men. That would produce an appointing\r\npower far better than the secret and utterly irresponsible method of\r\ndirect appointment by the politocrats which now exists. A much more\r\ndesirable result than this, however, is to be expected. Such a chief\r\njustice would be so important and conspicuous an officer and his power\r\nso great, that in his nomination and election the desires of the\r\nelectorate as a whole would have to be much more fully considered than\r\nis the case where the politocrats appoint to a nomination and seek the\r\nelection of an obscure member of a bench composed of thirty members and\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nAll fear of the chief justice having too much power and falling too\r\nmuch under the influence of the politocrats and extra-legal government\r\nmay be dissipated by making adequate provision for his retirement. The\r\nchief justice would, of course, be subject to impeachment. He might\r\nalso be retired by a legislative recall by a vote of three-fourths of\r\nthe members of the legislature after an opportunity for defense and\r\nfor cause entered upon the journals,[36] or by the governor upon an\r\naddress of both houses of the legislature.[37] The fact that the chief\r\njustice held office only for a short term would in fact subject him\r\nto a recall by popular vote at the end of each period. To this might,\r\nwith perfect propriety, be added the recall of the chief justice and\r\nelection of his successor by popular vote during the regular term.\r\nSurely such safeguards are ample to protect the electorate from any\r\nabuse of the appointing power conferred upon the chief justice.\r\n\r\nA chief justice who is retired at the end of his term by failure to be\r\nre-elected should, however, have the right, if he so chooses, to remain\r\none of the judges of the court upon the same footing as an appointed\r\njudge and subject to assignment to duty by his successor. This is\r\nproper because the election goes only to the matter of his political\r\nposition as the chief justice exercising an appointing power and\r\nadministrative powers with respect to the organization of the court\r\nand the way its business is handled. The electorate has nothing to do\r\nwith his fitness to decide litigated causes. Furthermore, the fact\r\nthat a failure to be re-elected will not send the chief justice back\r\nto the practice of the law, which he has given up, will insure greater\r\nindependence on his part while holding office as chief justice. It will\r\nalso be an act of fairness to him, since a profession once given up\r\nduring six or eight years for a place upon the bench is difficult and\r\nfrequently impossible to recover. In addition to this it is best for\r\nthe administration of justice itself that ex-chief justices who cannot\r\nregain their position in practice and are pitiful reminders of former\r\ngreatness should not be left derelicts at the bar. But if a chief\r\njustice upon failure to be re-elected chooses to take his place as a\r\njudge in the court, he should not be permitted again to be a candidate\r\nfor chief justice. It will not do to have in the court the rival of the\r\nsitting chief justice with a motive for making trouble.\r\n\r\nThe principal objections to the appointment of judges have been that\r\nthey necessarily hold for life and become arbitrary and exercise\r\njudicial power in a manner distasteful to the lawyers, their clients,\r\nand a majority of the electorate. It will usually be found on analysis\r\nthat the objectionable exercise of judicial power by an appointed judge\r\nis due to the fact that appointment means a life tenure. Hence the real\r\nobjection to the appointment of judges as such is that when appointed\r\nthey have held office for life. The entire objection, therefore, to\r\nappointment may be met by limiting the tenure of the appointed judge\r\nand by a variety of provisions for his retirement. He would, of course,\r\nbe subject to impeachment. He might very well in addition be subject\r\nto some mode of legislative recall such as was proposed for the chief\r\njustice. His term may be limited to five years or seven years, thus\r\nrequiring a retirement at the end of each period unless a reappointment\r\nis made. The judge appointed by the chief justice may even be subject\r\nto recall by popular vote according to one or the other, or both, of\r\ntwo plans. The appointment might be for a probationary period--say\r\nthree years--at the end of which time the judge must submit at a\r\npopular election to a vote on the question as to whether the place\r\nwhich he holds shall be declared vacant. This is not a vote which puts\r\nanyone else in the judge’s place, but a vote which can at most only\r\nleave the place to be filled by the appointing power. Such a plan\r\nmust necessarily promote the security of the judge’s tenure if at the\r\npopular election his office be not declared vacant. After surviving\r\nsuch a probationary period his appointment should continue for--let\r\nus say--six or nine years. At the end of that time the question might\r\nagain be submitted as to whether his place should be declared vacant.\r\nIf thought necessary further to protect the electorate from the bogey\r\nof an appointed judge, he might be subject to recall at any time upon\r\nthe petition of a percentage of the electorate. But this recall, like\r\nthe other, should present only the question of whether the judge’s\r\nplace should be declared vacant, leaving the vacancy, if created, to\r\nbe filled by the appointing power. The danger in the existence of both\r\nthese plans of popular recall is that they may be used with more effect\r\nby any extra-legal government of politocrats than by the electorate\r\nat large. It is highly improbable that the electorate would find it\r\nnecessary or advisable to use either mode of recall. The presence of\r\neither mode would, therefore, furnish a means whereby an influence of\r\nthe politocrats upon the judiciary could be continuously maintained.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, a grave mistake to suppose that judges exercise\r\ntheir judicial power in a distasteful and arbitrary manner merely\r\nbecause they hold for life or during good behavior. An arbitrary or\r\ndisagreeable course of action by a judge arises principally from the\r\nfact that he is subject to no authority which can receive complaints\r\nagainst him and act upon those complaints by way of private or public\r\ncriticism and correction of the judge. The best protection against\r\narbitrary and disagreeable actions by judges is a duly constituted\r\nbody of fellow judges who hold a position of superior power and\r\nauthority and to whom complaints as to the conduct of judges may\r\nbe brought and who may investigate those complaints and exercise\r\na corrective influence. When a considerable number of judges in a\r\nmetropolitan district are provided with a chief justice and organized\r\nfor the efficient handling of a great volume of business, the means\r\nof securing the exercise of a corrective influence over their conduct\r\nat once appears. Such a court must be organized into divisions for\r\nthe purpose of handling specialized classes of litigation. In a\r\nmetropolitan district like Chicago there should be an appellate\r\ndivision with from six to nine judges sitting in groups of three, a\r\nchancery division of six judges with a corps of masters, a probate and\r\nfamily relations division with at least four judges and a corps of\r\nmasters and assistants, a common-law division with fifteen to eighteen\r\njudges and a corps of masters, and a municipal court division with\r\nthirty-three judges. The chief justice should be the presiding justice\r\nof the appellate division and each of the other divisions should have\r\na presiding justice with large powers over the way in which the work of\r\neach division is handled. The chief justice and the presiding justices\r\nof divisions should form a judicial council or executive committee,\r\nwith considerable powers over the way the court as a whole is run. To\r\nsuch a judicial council there should be committed the power to remove\r\nfrom office any judge, other than the chief justice, and to reprove,\r\neither privately or publicly, or transfer any such judge to some other\r\ndivision of the court for inefficiency, incompetency, neglect of duty,\r\nlack of judicial temperament, or conduct unbecoming a gentleman and a\r\njudge, for the good of the service, or to promote its efficiency. The\r\npower of removal by the council should be exercised only where written\r\ncharges have been filed and after an opportunity has been given to the\r\njudge to be heard in his own defense.\r\n\r\nThe existence of a judicial council composed of the chief justice\r\nand the presiding justices of the different divisions of the court,\r\neach one responsible for the way in which the work of his division\r\nis handled, suggests also a practicable way in which to stimulate\r\nefficiency at the bar, provide a service test for candidates for places\r\non the bench, and subject the appointing power of the chief justice\r\nto a slight but reasonable control. The judicial council should be\r\ngiven power to appoint upon an eligible list for each division of\r\nthe court twice as many members of the bar as there are judges in\r\nthe division. The chief justice, in appointing judges to a place in\r\nany division of the court, should be required to select from this\r\neligible list on the occasion of every other appointment at least.\r\nThe operation of such a plan would be to place in the hands of the\r\npresiding judges of divisions an express authority to suggest what\r\nmembers of the bar practicing before their divisions respectively would\r\nmake satisfactory judges for each division. It would also operate to\r\nstimulate the efforts of lawyers and promote competition to secure\r\nplaces upon such eligible lists by specialization in practice before\r\nparticular divisions. This would develop an expertness in the handling\r\nof litigation which does not now exist on the part of any considerable\r\nnumber of the bar.\r\n\r\nWe may then conclude that in a metropolitan district with a hundred\r\nthousand electors and upward judges cannot be elected. They must\r\nbe appointed. If an election is attempted it is a failure and\r\nappointment results. The worst method of appointment is the secret\r\nand irresponsible appointment by politocrats. The most promising is\r\nthe conspicuous and legal appointment by a chief justice elected at\r\nlarge in the district at frequent intervals. Every objection to such a\r\nplan and every prejudice against it may be met by provisions for the\r\nretirement of the chief justice and his appointees by impeachment,\r\nby legislative and popular recalls, and by the power of the judicial\r\ncouncil to discipline and remove any judge other than the chief\r\njustice. It is even possible under such a plan to promote efficiency by\r\nsecuring an eligible list of men whose experience in practice under the\r\neyes of the judges insures excellence in appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] The following extract from the letter of Mr. Charles H.\r\nHartshorne, of Jersey City, N.J., to the author dated November 4, 1912,\r\nexplains the plan of administering the chancery jurisdiction in New\r\nJersey: “The constitution of New Jersey provides that ‘The Court of\r\nChancery shall consist of a Chancellor.’ The Chancellor is appointed\r\nby the Governor with the approval of the Senate, for a term of seven\r\nyears. He is usually reappointed, though it is an open question whether\r\nthis office is an exception to the custom that judicial officers of the\r\nsuperior courts shall be reappointed, regardless of their political\r\naffiliations, so long as they are capable of giving efficient service.\r\nThat custom has resulted in our having upon the Bench of the higher\r\ncourts, judges who have served for very long periods--twenty-five years\r\nand upwards.\r\n\r\n“A number of years ago, the work of the Court of Chancery having\r\nbecome too great for one judge to dispose of, a statute authorized the\r\nappointment by the Chancellor alone (without confirmation by any other\r\nauthority) of a Vice-Chancellor, as assistant. By further statutes, the\r\nnumber of these was increased to seven. The Court now consists of a\r\nChancellor and seven Vice-Chancellors, who sit separately in different\r\nparts of the State. The Vice-Chancellors are appointed for seven-year\r\nterms. That Bench is generally regarded as the strongest in the State\r\nand has given entire satisfaction to the Bar and to the public.\r\n\r\n“The Vice-Chancellors hear interlocutory motions in nearly all cases\r\nunder a standing rule of the Court, but they conduct trials and final\r\nhearings only upon an order of reference from the Chancellor. After\r\ntrial they write the opinion of the Court, which is usually reported,\r\nand advise the decree, which is then signed by the Chancellor. No\r\nappeal lies from their decree to the Chancellor, but all such decrees\r\nmay be appealed directly to the Court of Errors and Appeals.\r\n\r\n“Theoretically, the Vice-Chancellors are merely referees who report and\r\nadvise the Chancellor, the decree being made by him upon their report.\r\nIn actual practice however, they are members of the Court of Chancery,\r\nin fact (but not in form) making the final decree of that Court.\r\n\r\n“The system has worked very satisfactorily in respect to the character\r\nand attainments of the members of that Bench, but the work of the Court\r\nin populous cities is a good deal in arrear. This is due to the volume\r\nof business having outgrown the number of Vice-Chancellors.”\r\n\r\n[36] Illinois Constitution 1870, Art. VI, sec. 30.\r\n\r\n[37] Massachusetts Constitution, chap. iii, Art. I; 38 and 39 Vict.,\r\nCh. 77 (Jud. Act 1875), sec. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCHANGES IN THE PLAN OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe federal government is already organized upon a plan of centralized\r\npower. The ballot which it presents to the voter is always short. The\r\nvoter casts his ballot for a president and vice-president every four\r\nyears and for one congressman from his district (and perhaps one or two\r\nfrom the state at large) every two years. United States Senators hold\r\noffice for six years. Until the adoption of the recent 17th Amendment\r\ntwo were elected by each state legislature. Now two are elected at\r\nlarge in each state. The judges are appointed by the president with\r\nthe approval of the Senate. The Senate has a general veto power on\r\nExecutive appointments. Such in form at least is the organization of\r\nthe national government.\r\n\r\nToday, however, extra-legal government has laid its hand to some\r\nextent at least upon the government at Washington. In congressional\r\ndistricts where extra-legal government flourishes, it has become\r\nthe strongest and most persistent single force in the election of\r\ncongressmen. Naturally it has its loyal supporters in the House of\r\nRepresentatives of Congress. As the power of extra-legal government\r\ngrows and becomes more widespread its influence in that house will\r\ngrow. It is, of course, entirely immaterial whether a supporter of\r\nthe extra-legal government is labeled Democrat or Republican. He is\r\na Democrat when he comes from a district where the vote-directing\r\nmachine operates successfully under that name. He is a Republican when\r\nthe vote-directing machine operates successfully under that name. The\r\npower of extra-legal government which has appeared in the Senate of the\r\nUnited States is the direct consequence of the power of extra-legal\r\ngovernment in the state legislatures. Of course, extra-legal government\r\ndoes not often control a majority of the members of both houses of a\r\nstate legislature. A considerable minority, however, who hold together\r\nunder a strong leadership can wield a large influence. One of the\r\nreasons for the persistence of the fight upon Mr. Lorimer and its\r\npopular support throughout the country was the fact that his election\r\nrepresented to the popular mind in a striking manner the invasion of\r\nthe United States Senate by extra-legal government. No matter how free\r\nfrom corruption Mr. Lorimer may have been, the power so openly wielded\r\nby those allied with extra-legal government to place him in the United\r\nStates Senate presented itself to the people of the country as a menace\r\nto the nation. Yet a similar invasion has been going on steadily in\r\nquieter ways. Every gain of extra-legal government in the control\r\nof state legislatures has been a step farther toward a predominant\r\ninfluence in the United States Senate. It has been for the most part\r\nthrough senators who have supported, or at least felt that they must\r\nplacate the power of extra-legal government in their states, that\r\nthat government has obtained its hold upon the federal judiciary. The\r\npresident’s appointments must be approved by the Senate. Senatorial\r\ncustom, sometimes called courtesy, places the control of the Senate’s\r\napproval in the hands of the senators from the state for which the\r\njudicial appointment is made. The two senators from the state sometimes\r\ndivide the federal judicial districts in the state between them. Thus\r\nhas the president’s appointment to the lower federal bench been placed\r\nat the mercy of two, or perhaps a single senator. The president on\r\nhis part may have a popular legislative program which he is pledged\r\nand is attempting to secure action on from Congress. The support of\r\nsenators is necessary. The tendency, therefore, on the part of the\r\npresident to allow senators the upper hand in his appointments to the\r\nbench has been very marked. Extra-legal government has in the last\r\nfew years become a visible force in the selection of the president\r\nof the United States through its power to control delegates sent\r\nto the National Convention. At both the Democratic and Republican\r\nNational Conventions in 1912 the numerical strength of the delegates\r\nrepresenting extra-legal government in particular states or districts\r\nof states was very marked. In the Republican Convention these delegates\r\nand their allies not only controlled the situation, but actually took\r\nissue with the delegates who represented the electorate and beat them.\r\nThis was not a matter which could end when one faction cast more legal\r\nvotes at the convention than the other. The contest was one between the\r\nforces of extra-legal government and delegates for the moment actually\r\nrepresenting the popular choice. The contest between two such forces\r\ncan be settled only when one or the other has been swept from the\r\nfield. The triumph legally of the forces of extra-legal government in\r\nthe Republican Convention could have no other logical outcome than the\r\nformation of a new party.\r\n\r\nThe recent change effected by the seventeenth amendment providing for\r\nthe popular election of senators was made avowedly for the purpose\r\nof ousting the control of extra-legal government in the Senate. We\r\nmay be sure, however, that the change will not in the least tend to\r\ndrive extra-legal government from the field at large. It follows,\r\ntherefore, that the politocrats will use all their power to control\r\nnominations and elections to the United States Senate. The office of\r\nsenator, however, is conspicuous and extremely important. This fact\r\nalone will force the politocrats to put forward or support candidates\r\nof some independence and popular strength. This will naturally result\r\nin the United States Senate becoming far more representative of the\r\nelectorate than is the House. We may, therefore, expect the Senate to\r\nbecome less conservative than the House. If this continues in a marked\r\ndegree, it means the entire decadence of the House as a legislative\r\nbody. Its power will be exercised by the leaders of the house majority\r\nin the interests of a conservative check upon the Senate. Whether this\r\ncondition would survive the elimination of extra-legal government in\r\nour local municipal and state governments seems beyond the possibility\r\nof prediction.\r\n\r\nOther proposals for changes in the plan of the federal government have\r\nbeen made with the avowed object of eliminating extra-legal government\r\nby politocrats. The influence of extra-legal government in national\r\nconventions is to be permanently overthrown by presidential primaries.\r\nIf any change were to be made in respect to the judiciary it would\r\nbe in the direction of making them elective, and perhaps subject to\r\nthe recall. No doubt nominations through primary elections would be\r\nadvocated for all elective officers. Newspapers recently gave space\r\nto the demand that the postmasters should be elected by the voters\r\nof the post-office district. Whatever temporary advantage over the\r\nextra-legal government there may be in any of these expedients, they\r\nrepresent the application of the very principle of government which\r\nin the long run produces, and must always produce, the disease from\r\nwhich we are suffering and desire to be cured. This is our process\r\nof curing the ills of democracy with more democracy. It is the case\r\nof more poison for one already overcome. Have the past thirty years\r\nnot yet taught us that to increase the burden upon the voter is to\r\nreduce the most intelligent member of the electorate to the darkest\r\npolitical ignorance and thus to enable the professional adviser and\r\ndirector to the politically ignorant voter to cast his ballot for him?\r\nEvery additional appeal to the electorate is a step toward that scheme\r\nof government which is most favorable to the growth and development\r\nof extra-legal government by politocrats. The federal government is\r\nsuffering because in the village, the township, the city, the county,\r\nand the state, such political burdens have been placed upon the voter\r\nthat he cannot perform his political functions intelligently. He is\r\nforced to delegate them to those who make it their profession to carry\r\nhis political burdens for him. To them he turns over the privilege of\r\ncasting his ballot for him. It would be amusing if it were not tragic\r\nthat the increase of the cause should be selected as the cure.\r\n\r\nThe elimination of extra-legal government from our villages, townships,\r\ncities, counties, and states has become a national problem. The proper\r\nfunctioning of the national government is impossible while these\r\nsources contribute to the existence of extra-legal government. The\r\nreduction of governmental agencies to two--a local municipal government\r\nand a state government--the application of the principle of the\r\ncommission form of government to both, so that the electorate casts its\r\nballot for one officer only in each, and the consequent disruption of\r\nextra-legal government, are essential to the restoration of the federal\r\ngovernment to political health. The plan of the federal government\r\ntaken by itself and as an instrument of government in its appropriate\r\nsphere is still admirable. If it were the only governmental agency in\r\nthe field, extra-legal government would never have had a chance to\r\nachieve power in the United States. If any improvements in the plan of\r\nthe federal government are ever found necessary they should be in the\r\ndirection, first, of uniting the executive power and the legislative\r\npower, and second, the elimination of the Senate veto upon executive\r\nappointments. The former may be accomplished by placing the control\r\nof the executive power in the hands of the president and his cabinet\r\nor in a so-called council of state composed of the president and his\r\ncabinet officers and also requiring that each cabinet officer must be\r\na member of one of the houses of Congress. This would at once place\r\nthe control of the executive power of the nation in the hands of the\r\nleaders of the majority in both branches of the legislature, or at\r\nleast in the leaders of that branch which more effectively represented\r\nthe electorate. The president would cease to carry his present load\r\nof responsibility for executive action and legislative progress. His\r\noffice would be important, for he would be that human agency necessary\r\nto place the representatives of the victors at the polls in control of\r\nthe executive power. His influence as a member of the council of state\r\nwould be considerable. With a veto power over legislation he would\r\nstill retain an enormous one-man power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conflict between extra-legal government and the popular demand\r\nfor a true democracy is as irresistible as was the conflict between\r\nthe South and the North over the institution of slavery. Extra-legal\r\ngovernment, like the South, represents a vast property interest which,\r\nwhile at first seeking protection, soon became aggressive in its desire\r\nto extend its power and its institutions. As the North sought to live\r\nwith the institution of slavery in the South, to compromise with it\r\nand to check it here and there, so we have been trying to live with\r\nextra-legal government, to compromise with it and to check it when\r\nwe saw it in an especially obnoxious form. But as the fight for and\r\nagainst slavery was never settled till slavery was abolished, so the\r\nwar on politocracy will never cease till some great national crisis\r\nhas given birth to a new political philosophy and a sound practice\r\nunder it, which will sweep extra-legal government from the field. That\r\nphilosophy is summed up in three prosaic words: The Short Ballot. They\r\nare the emancipation proclamation for our government. The faithful and\r\ncomplete application of the principles underlying the short ballot\r\nin our local and state governments will be as important and perhaps\r\nas difficult a step for us to achieve as was the emancipation of the\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes\r\n\r\nErrors in punctuation have been fixed.\r\n\r\nPage 142: “proprietory interest” changed to “proprietary interest” to\r\nmatch the original source.",
