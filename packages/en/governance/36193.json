Gilbert's, which\r\nwas published in 1864.  But as he dealt with the viceroys between 1172\r\nand 1509 only, his book has no claim to completeness.  In common with\r\nall writers on Ireland, however, I must express my acknowledgments to\r\nGilbert.  His keen and discerning research work, covering the first two\r\nhundred years of the viceroyalty, has been of the utmost value to me.\r\n\r\nIrish affairs appear certain to monopolize public and parliamentary\r\nattention this year, and on this account I think that the history of\r\nthe men who have ruled Ireland for nearly seven hundred and fifty years\r\nwill be read with interest.\r\n\r\nOf the illustrations, that of Lord Aberdeen is from a photograph by M.\r\nLafayette of Dublin and London, who has also supplied the photographs\r\nof Lady Aberdeen, Lords Dudley, Spencer, Londonderry, Cadogan, and\r\nCrewe, King Edward at the {x} Dublin Exhibition, and those of the\r\nViceregal Lodge, St. Patrick's Hall, and the Throne Room in Dublin\r\nCastle.

Rome gave Ireland\r\nto the superstitious, cowardly King of England, but the Pope could not\r\nmake Henry a conqueror, and so the invader, coming to claim that which\r\ndid not belong to the Pope or to himself, discovered that the native\r\nIrish could defend themselves.  Ireland was a land of saints according\r\nto the chroniclers of the time; Henry discovered that it was also a\r\nland of fighters, and the armour and superior weapons of his army were\r\noutmatched by the sturdy patriotism of the Irish, whose weapons and\r\nmethods were, doubtless, crude, but whose courage and determination\r\nwere inspired by a love of country and intensified by a passion for\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nHenry II. landed at Waterford on October 11, 1171, accompanied by a\r\ngreat army.  The conquest of Ireland was to be short, sharp, and\r\ndecisive.  The natives appeared to know nothing of the fine art of war,\r\nand even Henry must have tasted of courage when he viewed the ill-armed\r\n{16} legions he had to fight.  From Waterford he marched to Dublin, but\r\nthe result of several battles and skirmishes was an attenuated army and\r\nunexpected defeat.  Had it not been for the inevitable Irish traitor,\r\nHenry and his followers would have been swept into the sea, but it is\r\nIreland's tragedy that she produces almost as many traitors as heroes.\r\nDermot McMurrough, King of Leinster, anxious to gain the unmistakable\r\nadvantages offered by an alliance with the King of England, came to\r\nHenry's aid, and thus the invader was at any rate able to claim the\r\nconquest of the land covered by the feet of his soldiers.  Beyond that\r\nhis jurisdiction was imaginary.  Realizing this, Henry determined to\r\nleave Ireland.  His expedition had proved profitless, but he foresaw\r\npossibilities of gain in the future.  The first of a long line of\r\nEnglishmen who have never known when they were beaten, Henry, with a\r\nstatesmanlike disregard for the realities, divided Ireland between ten\r\nof his followers, and, nominating one of them to act as his\r\nrepresentative, sailed from the country on Easter Monday, April 17,\r\n1172.  This, in brief, is the story of the conquest of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first Viceroy]\r\n\r\nHenry's representative, and, therefore, generally accepted as the first\r\nViceroy of Ireland, was Hugh de Lacy, a descendant of one of William\r\nthe Conqueror's companions in arms.  To De Lacy was committed the care\r\nof Dublin Castle and the command of the English in Ireland.  The\r\nviceroy was a small but muscular man, unscrupulous, immoral, and\r\nunsuccessful.  Henry gave him 800,000 acres which were not the king's\r\nto give, {17} even in the Dark Ages when right was might.  To a person\r\nof De Lacy's qualities the gift was valueless, for he was not the man\r\nto gain and hold the land.  Even when Tiarnan O'Ruarc, the original\r\nowner, was treacherously slain, the viceroy found it impossible to\r\nassert his authority over the vast estate.\r\n\r\nDe Lacy was soon succeeded by another Anglo-Norman baron,\r\nFitz-Gislebert, who gained Henry's confidence and gratitude by helping\r\nto subdue the rebellious sons of the King of England.  Fitz-Gislebert\r\ncame from Normandy to Ireland.  His viceroyalty was undistinguished,\r\nand he was chiefly occupied in defending himself from the attacks of\r\nthe Irish or in vain endeavours to assert his authority as the\r\nrepresentative of the King of England.  When he died in 1176 his\r\nwidow's brother, Raymond le Gros, acted as viceroy until Henry, having\r\nbeen acquainted with the decease of Fitz-Gislebert, appointed Guillaume\r\nFitz-Aldelm de Burgh to the post in 1177.  Raymond was not at all\r\npleased with Henry's choice, but he dissembled sufficiently to receive\r\nthe new viceroy at Wexford.  Raymond had by now assumed the name and\r\narms of the Geraldine family by virtue of his descent from an emigrant\r\nof an old Tuscan family, thus forming his kinsmen and followers under\r\none banner, and becoming the most powerful member of the English colony\r\nin Ireland.  Fitz-Aldelm and the Geraldines were never friendly, and it\r\nis not surprising, therefore, that one of the Geraldine chroniclers\r\nshould describe the viceroy as 'corpulent, crafty, plausible, {18}\r\ncorrupt, addicted to wine and profligate luxuriousness.'  The\r\ndescription, save for the physical details, would, however, apply to\r\nalmost every one of the early Viceroys of Ireland.  They were for the\r\nmost part needy adventurers sent to Ireland to replenish empty purses,\r\nlegalized robbers commissioned by the Kings of England, and none the\r\nless thieves because they were not always successful in their mission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English defeats]\r\n\r\nIn 1177 King Henry secured the permission of the Pope to style his son\r\nJohn, aged twelve, Lord of Ireland, and two years later the viceroy was\r\nrecalled, De Lacy returning to Ireland as Governor with a colleague in\r\nthe person of Robert de la Poer of Wexford.  De Lacy, however,\r\ncommitted the heinous crime of marrying without the king's permission,\r\nhis bride being the daughter of King O'Connor, and he was superseded by\r\nJean, Constable of Chester, who held the viceroyalty in conjunction\r\nwith Richard de Peche, Bishop of Coventry.  The ex-viceroy, however,\r\nmanaged to secure a renewal of the king's favour, and he quickly\r\nreturned to Ireland, though for safety's sake Henry gave him a\r\ncolleague, the Bishop of Salisbury, who was the monarch's paid spy.  De\r\nLacy pursued his policy unhampered, and very soon became wealthy and\r\npowerful.  The king, learning of his representative's arrogance,\r\ndecided that it was dangerous to permit a subject to taste too much of\r\nkingly power, and in 1184 he appointed his son, Prince John, now\r\nnineteen years of age, to be the chief governor of Ireland.  Fortified\r\nby the Papal sanction, Prince John came {19} to Ireland with a large\r\nand costly army to impress De Lacy and his fellow-barons, and,\r\nincidentally, to subdue the turbulent Irish.  An assassin removed De\r\nLacy from his path, but the natives were stubborn, and the English were\r\ndefeated whenever they gave battle.  Thereupon John, with his retinue,\r\nindulged in a series of orgies, lost the remnant of his army, and after\r\neight months returned to England in 1185.\r\n\r\nDuring the succeeding four years De Courcy, a powerful baron, ruled\r\nDublin in parts and none of the rest of Ireland, but, of course,\r\nmaintained the fiction that he was the king's representative, and,\r\ntherefore, Viceroy of Ireland.  Then followed the first viceroyalty of\r\nHugh de Lacy, a son of the previous viceroy, and in 1190 Guillaume le\r\nPetil took over the post and occupied it until 1191.  After him came in\r\nquick succession Guillaume, Earl Marechal (1191-94), Pierre Pipard\r\n(1194), Hamon de Valognes (1197-99), and Fitz-Henry, whose father was\r\nan illegitimate son of Henry I., whose first term began in 1199 and\r\nended in 1203.  De Valognes, when he retired, had to pay 1,000 marks to\r\nthe king's treasury to settle his viceregal accounts.  This was not\r\nexceptional.  The viceroys of Ireland were given considerable powers,\r\nbut they had their responsibilities, and among these was a contract to\r\nsupply so much money and soldiers to their royal masters.  To satisfy\r\nthese contracts, the viceroys, when denied the spoils of battle, had to\r\nrob and plunder, while the viceroy who paid his debts was as rare as\r\nvirtue in Dublin Castle.\r\n\r\n{20}\r\n\r\nHugh de Lacy returned in 1203, but King John, his fears aroused by the\r\nviceroy's introduction of special coinage, recalled him in 1204, and\r\nfor the space of a year Fitz-Henry occupied the viceregal position.  In\r\n1205 the king issued instructions for the erection of a new Dublin\r\nCastle.  De Lacy, however, had powerful friends, and in 1205 he came\r\nback once more, and ruled the English colony for five years, until King\r\nJohn landed at Waterford on June 20, 1210, when, of course, the\r\nvice-royalty ceased for the time being.  De Lacy, more courageous and\r\nskilful than his father, had carried war into the enemy's camp, and had\r\ndone something towards extending the boundaries of England's dominions\r\nbeyond the frontiers of Dublin.  He instituted a system of taxation\r\nwhich was very profitable to him and to his royal master, but it\r\nexasperated the Irish to such an extent that they rose in rebellion.\r\nThe opposing forces met at Thurles in 1208, and the result was a signal\r\ndefeat for De Lacy.  The coming of King John, who did not conceal his\r\ndistrust of the viceroy, caused De Lacy to concentrate his forces with\r\na view to impressing the king.  Fortune, however, was on the side of\r\nJohn, and De Lacy fled the country.  There are many legends recounting\r\nthe adventures of the once powerful nobleman.  He and his brother are\r\nsaid to have laboured as brickmakers and gardeners in Normandy and\r\nScotland, and suffered many other indignities.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Papal supremacy]\r\n\r\nKing John's stay in Ireland was brief, as the critical state of his\r\nkingdom required his presence in England.  He left behind him as his\r\nrepresentatives {21} Guillaume, Earl of Salisbury--an illegitimate son\r\nof Henry II. by the fair Rosemond Clifford--and De Grey, Bishop of\r\nNorwich.  In 1213 they were succeeded by Henry de Londres, Archbishop\r\nof Dublin, a powerful prelate and an unscrupulous statesman.  He was\r\ngiven the post because of his influence with the Pope, and John's first\r\ntask for his new viceroy was to send him to Rome to induce the occupant\r\nof the Papal throne to side with him against the barons.  Geoffery de\r\nMarreis, a follower of the Archbishop's, acted as his deputy during his\r\nabsence abroad.  The deputy robbed friend and foe alike, but eventually\r\nthe trades-people of Dublin petitioned the king because De Marreis\r\nwould not pay his debts and added insult to injury by compelling the\r\ntraders of the city to give him further credit.  King Henry III. was on\r\nthe throne now, and he ordered his representative to pay all his debts\r\nwithin forty days.  Furthermore, he was placed under the authority of\r\nthe Archbishop of Dublin, Henry de Londres, who had helped to make\r\nhistory by forming one of the barons and ecclesiastics who compelled\r\nKing John to sign the Magna Charta.  The archbishop was the most\r\npowerful Englishman in the kingdom of Ireland, and, as the\r\nrepresentative of the Pope, took precedence of the representative of\r\nthe king.  In 1221 he was appointed viceroy, and then ensued the usual\r\nconflict between the civil and religious powers that is inevitable when\r\nchurchmen turn politicians.  The English colony complained to Henry\r\nthat his viceroy was unable to cope with the insurgents, and they\r\nprayed {22} for a more warlike governor.  Guillaume Marechal, eldest\r\nson and heir of the first Earl of Pembroke, and afterwards second earl,\r\nwas sent to Ireland as viceroy in 1224, but this brother-in-law of the\r\nking's did not find the country to his liking, and he departed in\r\nfavour of Geoffery de Marreis, whose third term of office began in 1226\r\nand ended the following year.\r\n\r\nThis viceroyalty was the first to which a definite salary was given,\r\nthe sum of L580 a year being set aside for the use of Geoffery de\r\nMarreis.  Richard de Burgh followed De Marreis until, in 1229, Maurice\r\nFitzgerald assumed the reins of government.  Fitzgerald was born in\r\nIreland, and was the first Anglo-Irishman to become Viceroy of Ireland.\r\nHis viceroyalty extended over fifteen years, though at intervals the\r\ngovernment was in the hands of Geoffery de Marreis and Richard de Burgh\r\nfor a few months.  The viceroy was given a salary of L500 a year, and\r\nunlimited authority to rob the native Irish, and even the English\r\ncolony, provided he sent part of the proceeds to London to help to pay\r\nthe king's debts and finance wars.  But he fell from grace in 1245, and\r\nwas dismissed, the reason given being his dilatoriness in bringing\r\nreinforcements to his royal master in Wales.  Jean Fitz-Geoffery was\r\nappointed his successor, and during the ensuing ten years the\r\ngovernment was nominally vested in him, minor changes occurring from\r\ntime to time.  The next viceroy, Alain de la Zouche, reigned for four\r\nyears (1255-59), and died as the result of an assault made upon him by\r\nthe Earl of Warrene and {23} Surrey in Westminster Hall, while his\r\nsuccessor, Etienne, who had married the widow of the second Hugh de\r\nLacy, was murdered in 1260.\r\n\r\nThe next half-dozen viceroys are summed up easily.  Guillaume le Dene\r\n(1260-61), Sir Richard de la Rochelle (1261-66), Jean Fitz-Geoffery for\r\nthe third time (1266-67), Sir Robert D'Ufford (1268 and 1276-82),\r\nRichard D'Exeter (1269), and Jacques D'Audeley (1270-72).  The majority\r\nwere adventurers and favourites of the king, and few could claim\r\npossession of the soldier-like qualities which were needed at the time.\r\nSir Robert D'Ufford was an exception, but he spent most of his time\r\nfighting abroad in the service of the King of England.  Maurice\r\nFitzmaurice Fitzgerald, signalized a brief viceroyalty, extending from\r\n1272-73, by marching into the territory of the O'Connors, and promptly\r\nbeing made a prisoner.  The vacancy thus created was filled by Geoffery\r\nde Joinville, who held the post for three years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sir Jean Wogan]\r\n\r\nJean de Saundford, Archbishop of Dublin (1288-90), was one of the\r\nnumerous deputies who governed the English colony between 1282 and\r\n1290.  These deputies were mainly ecclesiastics, for England's\r\nunsettled state and numerous wars called every leading warrior away\r\nfrom Ireland.  Sir Guillaume de Vesci (1290-93), Guillaume de la Haye\r\n(1293), Guillaume D'Ardingselles (1294), Thomas Fitzmaurice (1294-95)\r\npaved the way for Sir Jean Wogan, who was viceroy for thirteen years,\r\nand who did more to establish the authority of England than any of his\r\npredecessors.  When Wogan was appointed the chief source of danger {24}\r\nto the English colonists was the feud between the two great Anglo-Irish\r\nfamilies, the Fitzgeralds and the De Burghs.  Wogan, however, succeeded\r\nin bringing them together, and they agreed to a truce.  The viceroy was\r\nalso fairly successful against the natives, but he made no additions to\r\nthe territory over which England nominally held sway.  In 1308 Sir\r\nGuillaume de Burgh was appointed to succeed Wogan, but an unexpected\r\ndevelopment occurred, and Edward II., urged on by his advisers,\r\nnominated his Gascon favourite, Piers de Gaveston, to the post.  This\r\nwas virtually an act of banishment, and the gay Gascon regarded it as\r\nsuch, but for the time he had to accept the post, which was regarded by\r\nthe wealthy English barons as tantamount to exile.  Ireland was not a\r\ngarden of pleasant memories to the English warriors.  Not one of them\r\nwho had tried his skill in the country had added to his laurels, and,\r\nconsequently, the only men who would accept the viceroyalty or any of\r\nthe posts attached to the Dublin Castle Government were the \"needy\r\nadventurers\" who stood to lose nothing and gain something.  From time\r\nto time the English colony petitioned the king not to send these 'needy\r\nadventurers,' but there were no others to fill the vacancies that arose.\r\n\r\nPiers de Gaveston's case was an exception.  Edward II. had advanced him\r\nto the Earldom of Cornwall, and the barons were jealous of him.  They\r\nplotted against his life, but the king stood by his favourite, and\r\neventually both parties {25} compromised by permitting Piers to go to\r\nIreland.  He did not stay in Ireland for more than a few months, for he\r\nhungered for the gay English court, and when he left the country Sir\r\nJean Wogan renewed his viceroyalty.  It was in this year--1309--that\r\nJohn Lech, Archbishop of Dublin, obtained a Bull from Clement V.\r\nauthorizing the establishment of a university in Dublin.  The laudable\r\nproject, however, was prematurely abandoned owing to the death of the\r\narchbishop.  Nearly three hundred years elapsed before Dublin received\r\nits now famous university.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Edward Bruce crowned]\r\n\r\nSir Edmund le Botiller, or Butler, succeeded Wogan in 1312, and carried\r\non his policy.  He is said to have succeeded in restoring order in the\r\nEnglish colony and its immediate surroundings, but when reappointed in\r\n1315, after a viceroyalty of a few months by Theobaude de Verdun, he\r\nhad to cope with the most serious rebellion Ireland had known for two\r\nhundred years.  The native Irish had been inspired by the exploits of\r\nKing Robert Bruce of Scotland, and they called upon that monarch's\r\nbrother, Edward Bruce, to rule over their country and lead them to\r\nvictory.  Bruce responded with alacrity, and he was crowned King of\r\nIreland in 1315.  Le Botiller collected a large army, and went in\r\npursuit of the invader and his followers, but the viceroy suffered an\r\noverwhelming defeat, and it seemed as though the last day had come of\r\nEnglish rule in Ireland.  The inhabitants of Dublin, who were, of\r\ncourse, mainly English, became alarmed, but some confidence was\r\nrestored at a meeting of the chief {26} nobles, who swore fidelity to\r\nKing Edward, and declared that they would forfeit life and lands if\r\nthey failed in their duty.  The manifesto, signed by ten nobles, was\r\ndelivered to Edward at Westminster, and he signified his approval and\r\ngratitude by creating the first of the signatories, Jean Fitz-Thomas,\r\nEarl of Kildare.  Fitz-Thomas had been Baron of Offaly.  The defeated\r\nand discomfited Le Botiller was superseded in 1317 by Roger de\r\nMortimer, the paramour of King Edward's queen.  Mortimer brought with\r\nhim 15,000 men, and while he was pursuing Bruce he appointed the\r\nArchbishops of Cashel and Dublin to act as his deputies at Dublin.\r\n\r\nSunday, October 14, 1318, witnessed the last of Edward Bruce and his\r\npretensions to the kingdom of Ireland.  Outnumbered and out-generalled,\r\nhe was defeated and killed at the Battle of Faughard, and in accordance\r\nwith the rules of war his head was sent to King Edward.  When this\r\nghastly trophy arrived, Edward was seated at a banquet with the\r\nAmbassadors from King Robert Bruce of Scotland, who had asked and\r\nseemed likely to obtain the province of Ulster for Edward Bruce.  The\r\nsight of Bruce's head, however, ended the conference prematurely.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first university]\r\n\r\nRoger de Mortimer was in 1319 induced to forsake the attractions of the\r\nqueen's court for the rigours of Dublin Castle, but in 1320 he was back\r\nagain in London, leaving Thomas Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare, to rule in\r\nhis stead.  Kildare was succeeded by Jean de Bermingham, Earl of Louth,\r\n{27} in 1321; while in the same year Sir Ralph de Gorges and Sir Jean\r\nd'Arcy occupied in turn the viceroyalty.  D'Arcy lasted until 1326.  It\r\nis worthy of note that in 1320 a university was opened in Dublin, but\r\nit was never more than a seminary for ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{28}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe year 1326 is memorable in English annals because of the deposition\r\nof Edward II.  The Viceroy of Ireland, Thomas, second Earl of Kildare,\r\nwas appointed that year, the warrant stating that he represented Edward\r\nIII., then a boy of fourteen.  The deposed monarch immediately looked\r\nto Ireland for support, and to Dublin he came, having heard that the\r\nEnglish colony refused to acknowledge the authority of the Earl of\r\nKildare.  He was misinformed, however, and he lost his throne without\r\nbeing able to strike a blow for it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prior Utlagh and witchcraft]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Kildare gave way in 1328 to a remarkable ecclesiastic,\r\nPrior Roger Utlagh, Chancellor and Prior of the Knights Hospitallers of\r\nKilmainham.  He ruled as an autocrat, outwardly acknowledging Edward's\r\nsovereignty, but in reality a combination of layman and priest, who\r\nfeared neither God nor man.  When King Robert Bruce visited Ireland,\r\nand invited the Prior to a conference, he was ordered to leave the\r\ncountry, and he had to obey.  Fellow-ecclesiastics plotted against him,\r\nbut he was more than their match.  When the Bishop of Ossory openly\r\naccused the viceroy of favouring heretics, Roger Utlagh made {29} it\r\nthe occasion of a great public demonstration of his virtuous qualities.\r\nThe charge was based on a rumour that the viceroy had shown kindness to\r\na man imprisoned in Dublin Castle because he was the patron of a\r\nsupposed witch's son.  The position was serious enough, and the\r\nviceroy, therefore, issued proclamations for three successive days,\r\ncalling upon his enemies to appear and prefer a charge against him.  No\r\none came forward, as was only to be expected, the viceroy possessing\r\narbitrary punitive powers, and Utlagh thereupon nominated six\r\ncommissioners in Dublin Castle and examined witnesses provided by\r\nhimself.  The complacent commissioners formally declared Prior Utlagh's\r\ncharacter to be spotless, and in return for this testimonial the worthy\r\necclesiastic presided over a banquet in the Castle.  Thus were his\r\nenemies confounded.\r\n\r\nThe Prior retired for William de Burgh, Earl of Ulster, who was styled\r\nLieutenant, or locum tenens.  De Burgh's reign was brief, and in 1332,\r\nwithin a year of his appointment, he was replaced by Sir Jean d'Arcy,\r\nan ex-viceroy.  The Earl of Ulster was murdered in 1333, an act of\r\nrevenge inspired by an aunt whose husband the earl had starved to death\r\nin one of his castles.  The crime had its effect on English history, as\r\nthe Countess of Ulster fled to England with her only child, Elizabeth,\r\nwho married a son of Edward III. and became an ancestor of Edward IV.\r\nSir Jean d'Arcy was merely viceroy in name, the deputy, Sir Thomas de\r\nBurgh, ruling in Dublin Castle until 1337, when Sir John de Cherlton,\r\nwho had been {30} appointed in place of the deputy--dismissed for\r\nirregularities--occupied the post for a year.  His successor was his\r\nbrother, the Bishop of Hereford, who also became Chancellor.  Like most\r\necclesiastics of the time, the Bishop of Hereford was a very zealous\r\npolitician, drawing a sharp line between his spiritual and his temporal\r\npowers.  He seized the cattle of the native Irish in large quantities,\r\nfrequently despoiling the whole countryside of every head of live\r\nstock, and this so delighted the valorous Edward III. that he wrote a\r\nlong letter of commendation to his faithful representative, and ordered\r\nthe treasurer at Dublin Castle to pay the viceroy's salary before that\r\nof any other official.  The year 1340 witnessed the retirement of the\r\ncattle-stealing Bishop, the reappointment and death of Prior Utlagh,\r\nand the conferring for life of the viceroyalty upon Sir Jean d'Arcy,\r\nwho had covered himself with glory in the numerous wars of Edward III.\r\nD'Arcy did not, of course, come to Ireland.  The appointment was in\r\nreality the king's way of rewarding his faithful warrior, and,\r\ntherefore, D'Arcy was content to share in the spoils and gains of his\r\ndeputy, Sir John Moriz.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rise of the Anglo-Irish]\r\n\r\nBy now, however, a new factor entered into the protracted struggle for\r\nthe possession of the rich lands of Ireland.  During the centuries of\r\nEnglish occupation several great Anglo-Irish families had arisen, and,\r\nfattening upon their spoils, gradually came to occupy positions more\r\npowerful than the representatives of the king.  The heads of the\r\nDesmonds, the Geraldines, the De Burghs, and {31} others, resented the\r\nintrusion of English warriors sent to Dublin to refill their treasure\r\nchests.  They wished to rule Ireland, and declined to bow the knee to\r\nimpecunious adventurers invested with royal powers by the King of\r\nEngland.  Slowly yet surely these powerful chieftains ranged themselves\r\non one side until hostilities in Ireland were not between the English\r\nand the natives, but between the English by birth and the English by\r\nblood, jealousy and greed of gain forming the motive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Viceregal lodge, Dublin]\r\n\r\nWhen Sir John Moriz, D'Arcy's deputy, called a Parliament together at\r\nDublin to consider the state of the country and to promulgate new\r\nEdwardian ordinances, the Earl of Desmond and other leaders of the\r\nEnglish by blood declined to attend.  In their opinion Sir Jean d'Arcy\r\nand his deputy were 'needy adventurers'--a description they applied to\r\nthem in a petition sent direct to Edward III.  Desmond was a clever\r\nman, who openly advocated peace and secretly prepared for war.  His\r\ndiplomacy, however, gained a surer victory than all his legions were\r\ncapable of accomplishing, for in the petition already referred to he\r\nasked politely why his Majesty did not receive larger revenues from\r\nIreland.  This caused Edward to realize some of the disadvantages of\r\nconferring the viceroyalty upon impecunious warriors, and he promptly\r\nsurrendered to the petitioners, removing Moriz, and appointing Sir\r\nRaoul d'Ufford, who became viceroy in the early part of 1344.\r\n\r\nD'Ufford was wealthy enough to be trusted with {32} the government of\r\nIreland, and Edward owed him something for his services in the French\r\nand Flemish wars.  It is more than likely, however, that he was\r\nindebted for his viceroyalty to the fact that his wife was Maud\r\nPlantagenet, widow of the murdered Earl of Ulster and also of Edward's\r\nson.  D'Ufford's commission authorized him to grant pardon to rebels on\r\ntheir swearing allegiance to the king, and, furthermore, it enjoined\r\nhim to search for Irish mines of gold, silver, lead, and tin.\r\nD'Ufford's appointment evoked no enthusiasm and some fear.  The English\r\ncolony knew the temper of Maud Plantagenet, a proud, revengeful, and\r\nambitious woman, and greatly as they feared D'Ufford's reputation for\r\nseverity, they realized that, urged on by his wife, he might be guilty\r\nof excesses exceeding those which had won for him the fear of his\r\nenemies in France.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the viceregal pair into Dublin in July, 1345,\r\nforeshadowed the kingly state they maintained throughout their brief\r\nreign.  They resided in the Priory of the Knights Hospitallers of\r\nKilmainham, and Maud Plantagenet, Countess of Ulster, put into practice\r\nthe lessons she had learnt at the English court.  She exacted homage\r\nfrom her friends, maintained ladies-in-waiting, held courts of her own,\r\nand, in fact, was Queen of Ireland.  Letters were sent to Edward\r\ndescribing the conduct of his ambitious representatives, and the king's\r\njealousy and fears were aroused.  Action on his part, however, was\r\nforestalled by the death of D'Ufford, who expired from a malignant\r\ndisease on Palm Sunday, 1346.  Clergy and laity {33} combined to\r\ncelebrate the tyrant's death, and thanksgiving services were held\r\nthroughout the English colony.  D'Ufford and his wife occupied the\r\nviceroyalty for less than twelve months, but in that brief space of\r\ntime they committed many acts of oppression, torturing, robbing,\r\ndespoiling, and executing enemies and even friends to gratify a lust\r\nfor gain and exhibit to the world their vanity of power.  Most of\r\nD'Ufford's tyrannies were ascribed by the populace to the evil counsels\r\nof his wife, and when he was no more they sought out the widow with the\r\nintention of laying violent hands upon her.  Tyrants have no friends\r\nwhen they fall from power, and Maud Plantagenet suffered the usual\r\nindignities of a changeable fate, though she managed to escape from\r\nIreland and carry her husband's body to England.  She passed the\r\nremainder of her life in retirement.\r\n\r\nSince his dismissal Sir John Moriz had laboured to obtain his\r\nrestoration, and he succeeded in this three days before D'Ufford's\r\ndeath.  Meanwhile the council in Ireland had elected Roger, son of Sir\r\nJean d'Arcy, who, however, gave way to Moriz when the latter arrived.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The profits of the post]\r\n\r\nThe new viceroy had been charged by the king to secure supplies of\r\nmoney for him from out of Ireland.  Indeed, the appointment was based\r\non a sort of co-partnership, the king insisting upon a large percentage\r\nof the profits of the post.  Moriz knew that conciliation was the only\r\nmeans of obtaining the money, and he began by releasing the Earl of\r\nKildare from imprisonment in Dublin Castle, and showing similar\r\nclemency to other {34} distinguished prisoners.  The policy of Walter\r\nde Bermingham (1348-49), John, Lord Carew (1349), and Sir Thomas de\r\nRokeby (1349-55), was in direct contrast.  They favoured war where\r\nMoriz had tried peace, and with the usual result.  The native Irish had\r\nby now the protection and assistance of the leading Anglo-Irish\r\nfamilies, who were influenced by the Irish blood in their veins, and\r\ntook common cause against the viceroy and his battalions.  In almost\r\nevery encounter the English were defeated, and, finally, Dublin itself\r\nwas threatened.  In alarm the English colony began to make hasty\r\npreparations for flight to England.  They sold what they could and\r\nabandoned the rest, and it seemed as though the English in Ireland\r\nwould cease to exist when an order came from England declaring that any\r\nEnglish colonist deserting Ireland would be put to death.  Compelled to\r\nremain, they continued their miserable existence, threatened with\r\nmurder by their foes, and in continual danger of robbery by the very\r\nmen appointed to protect them.  Dublin at this period was in a wretched\r\ncondition.  There had been no attempt to build a city, and in reality\r\nthe place was a fort whereby England maintained its footing in Ireland.\r\nIn the country the native chiefs and the Anglo-Irish noblemen ruled,\r\nadministering justice in their crude fashion, and in some cases issuing\r\ntheir own coinage.  The Viceroy of Ireland was in reality Viceroy of\r\nDublin, and not always even that.\r\n\r\nThe next Lord-Deputy was Maurice, first Earl of Desmond, an\r\nAnglo-Irishman.  He died in 1356, {35} a year after his appointment,\r\nand Sir Thomas de Rokeby, who succeeded him, succumbed the same year.\r\nA return to the old condition of things was marked by the appointment\r\nof Baron Almaric de St. Amaud, who was created Lord of Gormanstown, but\r\nthe baron did not care for Ireland, and he went back to England,\r\nleaving Maurice, fourth Earl of Kildare, to act as his deputy.  He gave\r\nway to James le Botiller, second Earl of Ormonde, who was a\r\ngreat-grandson of Edward I.  The appointment won the allegiance of\r\nOrmonde to the throne of England, and when, two years\r\nlater--1361--Prince Lionel, third son of Edward III., was appointed\r\nviceroy and sent to Ireland with a large army, Ormonde promptly became\r\none of his Generals.  In 1347, when the Prince was ten, he had been\r\nmarried to Elizabeth, daughter of the murdered Earl of Ulster and Maud\r\nPlantagenet, the girl being sixteen.  The object was to secure for the\r\nRoyal Family the immense estates and vast wealth of the late Earl of\r\nUlster, and when in 1361 Prince Lionel and his wife travelled with\r\ntheir army to Ireland, a considerable part of the expenditure was borne\r\nby his wife's estate.  Remembering the hostility of the Irish against\r\nhis wife's mother, Lionel issued a proclamation forbidding the natives\r\nto approach his camp.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English army defeated]\r\n\r\nHaving rested for a time, Prince Lionel began the march which was to\r\nconquer the land, but again an English army, strong, well armed and\r\nvictualled, was outmatched and defeated by the Irish.  Disaster after\r\ndisaster followed the prince, who could do nothing right.  Edward, when\r\nhe {36} heard the news, was alarmed and astounded.  The first thing he\r\ndid was to create the prince Duke of Clarence.  His second step was\r\nmore practical, and consisted in raising another army, while he\r\nincreased his son's allowance from 6s. 8d. a day to 13s. 4d.  Victory,\r\nhowever, was denied the prince, and though he returned to Ireland with\r\nincreased forces in 1364, 1365, and 1366, he failed to improve upon his\r\nprevious attempts.  In 1362 his wife had died, leaving an only child in\r\nthe person of Phillipa.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Statute of Kilkenny]\r\n\r\nPrince Lionel's term of office is chiefly remarkable because it\r\nwitnessed the creation of the famous, or infamous, Statute of Kilkenny.\r\nAt a special Parliament held in Kilkenny in 1367, the viceroy\r\nendeavoured to gain by legislation that which he and his soldiers had\r\nlost in a dozen battles.  It was therefore decreed that no English\r\nsettler could marry into an Irish family; the selling of horses,\r\narmour, or victuals in peace or war was declared treason; English was\r\nthe only language to be spoken; the English style of horsemanship was\r\nto be adopted; and no subject of the king's could be known except by an\r\nEnglish name, and the education of the Irish was forbidden, no colleges\r\nor seminaries being permitted to receive them.  There were also special\r\nclauses dealing with ecclesiastics, who were ordered to expel any Irish\r\namongst them.  The use of the English tongue was enjoined strictly, and\r\nif anyone offended the profits of his benefice were to be seized by his\r\nsuperior.  The English colonists were likewise warned against admitting\r\nitinerant {37} musicians into their houses, for these men were regarded\r\nas spies, and therefore dangerous.  The custom of calling the English\r\nby birth 'English Hobbes,' or clowns, was forbidden, as well as the\r\nnickname of 'Irish dogs' bestowed upon the English by blood.  The\r\nGovernment could not afford the luxury of schisms amongst its friends.\r\nThe common people were ordered not to play hurlings and quoitings,\r\n'which had caused evils and maims,' but to accustom themselves 'to draw\r\nbows and cast lances and other gentleman-like sports whereby the Irish\r\nenemies might be better checked.'  Constables of castles were forbidden\r\nto take more than 5d. per day from any prisoner for maintenance, and\r\ntorture was vetoed.  Not the least important enactment of the Statute\r\nof Kilkenny was the 'one war one peace' declaration.  This meant that\r\nin the event of a rebellion or uprising all those who did not side with\r\nthe viceroy were to be regarded as the open enemies of the King of\r\nEngland.  Neutrality could not be acknowledged.\r\n\r\nWhen this laborious and comprehensive statute had been drawn up the\r\nviceroy requested the Archbishops of Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam, and the\r\nBishops of Lismore and Waterford, Killaloe, Leighlin, and Cloyne to\r\npronounce sentence of excommunication against all those who might by\r\n'rebellion of heart' resist the Statute of Kilkenny.\r\n\r\nThis was Lionel's last act as viceroy, and he retired, being succeeded\r\nby Gerald, fourth Earl of Desmond, known as 'The Poet' by reason of his\r\n{38} writings.  He was popular, witty, and just, and for two years he\r\nruled the English colony.  In 1369, however, Sir William de Windsor,\r\nwho had been one of the leaders of Prince Lionel's army, was appointed\r\nviceroy, and given an annuity of L1,000 until lands producing an equal\r\namount could be settled on him.  De Windsor's time was occupied chiefly\r\nin repelling attacks on the city of Dublin by the border Irish, but he\r\nperformed an heroic action by marching to the South of Ireland and\r\nrescuing the preceding viceroy, whose poetical temperament and mild\r\nmanner had not saved him from the hostility of the Irish.  In 1371 De\r\nWindsor retired for over two years.  The appointment of a successor\r\ncaused Edward great trouble.  He was averse to sending a pauper,\r\nbecause that would entail a diminution in the royal receipts from\r\nIreland, while the wealthy men about his court would not accept the\r\npost at any price.  Ireland to them was a savage country; a stay there\r\ntantamount to punishment and exile.  There was no prospect of military\r\nglory, for they knew that many of the gallant victors of France,\r\nFlanders, and Scotland had left their reputations behind them on many a\r\nlost battlefield in Ireland.  Edward thought that he could compel\r\nanybody he chose to go to Ireland, and he selected Sir Richard de\r\nPembridge, who held several very profitable offices under the English\r\nCrown.  Naturally Pembridge declined the post, and Edward retorted by\r\ndepriving him of his offices.  Pembridge, however, appealed to the\r\nCouncil and to Parliament, and it was decided that it was not the {39}\r\nking's prerogative to order anybody to leave the country.  Magna Charta\r\ndistinctly stated that exile from England was the punishment for felony\r\nor treason, and that Parliament alone had the power to expel a subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The 'Lady of the Sun']\r\n\r\nPrior to the return of Sir William de Windsor, the government was\r\nundertaken for various short periods by Maurice Fitz-Thomas, Earl of\r\nKildare, Dean de Colton, of St. Patrick's, who secured the post by\r\nundertaking to repel the O'Briens at his own expense, and William de\r\nTaney, an ecclesiastic.  De Windsor came back in April, 1374, having\r\ncome to an agreement with his royal master, whereby he was allowed 500\r\nmarks from the Exchequer and the sum of L11,213 6s. 8d.  In return for\r\nthe money he guaranteed to maintain 200 men-at-arms and 40 archers.  De\r\nWindsor's object was obviously to make as much money as he could out of\r\nthe unfortunate country, which was already sending annually the\r\nenormous sum for the period of L10,000.  The viceroy came to regard all\r\nsurplus moneys above that sum to be his perquisites, and his efforts to\r\nincrease taxation and enrich himself were so unscrupulous and cynical\r\nthat reports and complaints soon reached Edward.  The king immediately\r\nappointed Sir Nicholas de Dagworth to proceed to Ireland, and\r\ninvestigate the charges against De Windsor.  But the enemies of the\r\nviceroy reckoned without the famous Alice Perrers.  She was the aged\r\nking's favourite, and was clever and unscrupulous, a woman of humble\r\nbirth who had risen high without the aid of a pretty face.  In love\r\nwith Sir William {40} de Windsor, she remained faithful to him during\r\nhis absence in Ireland, and although surrounded by his enemies, the\r\n'Lady of the Sun,' as Edward styled her, outwitted them all, her\r\ngreatest achievement being the prevention of Dagworth's departure for\r\nIreland.  Subsequently she married De Windsor, but as she belongs more\r\nto the history of England than Ireland her career cannot be treated\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIn 1376 De Windsor was ordered to come to Westminster, and confer with\r\nthe king on the state of his Irish dominions, but this was merely a\r\npretext to deprive him of his post, and he never returned.  Maurice\r\nFitz-Thomas, Earl of Kildare, once more acted as deputy for a short\r\ntime, and then James le Botiller, Earl of Ormonde, carried on the\r\ngovernment from 1376 to 1378.  Ormonde retired dissatisfied, and the\r\ncolony was governed by two members of the Council, Alexander de Balscot\r\nand John de Bromwich, until in 1380 the king sent over Edmund de\r\nMortimer, Earl of March and Ulster, husband of Phillipa, daughter of\r\nLionel, Duke of Clarence, and therefore owner of vast estates and\r\ncommander of an army of his own.  On his appointment the colonists\r\npetitioned the king to compel De Mortimer to live in Dublin and protect\r\nhis property.  The petitioners were successful, and the viceroy,\r\ninstead of appointing a deputy and sharing the profits, graciously\r\nagreed to govern Ireland in person for a period of three years at a\r\nsalary of 2,000 marks.  In princely splendour he entered the country,\r\nand immediately inaugurated a campaign against the rebellious south.\r\nDeath, however, claimed him on {41} December 26, 1381, and he died at\r\nCork in a Dominican Abbey, being only thirty years of age.\r\n\r\nThe vacancy thus created was offered in turn to the Earls of Desmond\r\nand Ormonde, but they declined on the ground that if they were in\r\nDublin they could not protect their own territories.  Dean de Colton,\r\ntherefore, was appointed pending the pleasure of the king, who, when he\r\nheard of De Mortimer's death, at once nominated the deceased viceroy's\r\nson Roger to the post.  Roger de Mortimer was only eleven, but the\r\nviceroyalty was intended as a monetary compensation for the death of\r\nhis father, and the commission appointing him stated that he was to\r\nreceive all the profits of the office as well as a salary of 2,000\r\nmarks.  Furthermore, as soon as he attained his majority he could\r\nretire from the post.  In pursuance of this convenient plan the boy's\r\nuncle, Sir Thomas de Mortimer, was chosen as his deputy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Parliament in Dublin]\r\n\r\nThe presence of a deputy, however, always had an irritating effect upon\r\nthe English colonists, and when in 1382 Richard II. ordered a\r\nParliament to meet in Dublin, its first act was to protest against the\r\nabsence of the viceroy.  To satisfy the nobles and prelates the king\r\nappointed Philip de Courtenay, a cousin of his, viceroy for life.  The\r\ncommission was drawn up in 1385, but it was not until two years later\r\nthat de Courtenay landed in Ireland.  His reign was brief and stormy.\r\nThe two great Anglo-Irish families, the Desmonds and the Ormondes, were\r\nin conflict, and the Irish were besieging and harassing the colonists.\r\nDe Courte was not the man for the occasion.  He was {42} charged with\r\noppression and extortion, and the king, who had already made up his\r\nmind to make his favourite, de Vere, Earl of Oxford, Viceroy of\r\nIreland, gladly accepted the accusations against de Courtenay, and\r\nordered him to remain under arrest in Dublin until the arrival of his\r\nsuccessor, who would investigate the charges against his character.  De\r\nCourtenay appealed to the Council in Dublin, and they declared the\r\naccusations to be unjust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Throne Room, Dublin Castle]\r\n\r\nThe appointment of de Vere to the viceroyalty was an outcome of the\r\nstruggle between Richard II. and his Barons.  De Vere was the reigning\r\nfavourite, and when it was proposed that he should be sent to Ireland\r\nas viceroy, the nobles enthusiastically endorsed the selection, and,\r\nglad to be rid of him at any price, cheerfully voted supplies.  Richard\r\ncreated his creature Marquis of Dublin, and allowed him to nominate Sir\r\nJohn de Stanley as his deputy.  It was not de Vere's intention to\r\nproceed to Ireland, and under various pretexts he avoided assuming\r\npersonal control of the Irish government.  Meanwhile Richard had\r\ncreated him Duke of Ireland, and entrusted him with powers almost\r\nregal, at one time actually proposing to make him King of Ireland.\r\nWhen the nobles rebelled against Richard, de Vere raised an army on\r\nbehalf of his king, but was defeated in his first encounter with the\r\nbarons.  He died abroad after the five judges, who had supported\r\nRichard in his attempt to make de Vere King of Ireland, were brought to\r\ntrial for having declared that the king was above the law, and were\r\npunished by being {43} exiled to Ireland!  Richard, weak-minded and\r\nunreliable, was at least faithful to de Vere, and he had his\r\nfavourite's corpse brought from Louvain, and interred to the\r\naccompaniment of magnificent ceremonies at Colne Priory in Essex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richard II. arrives]\r\n\r\nFrom 1387 to 1389 the government was again in the hands of Alexander de\r\nBalscot, Bishop of Meath, who was assisted by Richard White, Prior of\r\nKilmainham.  Then Sir John de Stanley came back until 1391, and was\r\nsucceeded by James le Botiller, third Earl of Ormonde.  During\r\nOrmonde's term of office the king's uncle, Thomas Plantagenet, Duke of\r\nGloucester, was nominated Viceroy of Ireland, but the commission was\r\nquickly revoked.  Richard had decided to visit Ireland in person, and\r\nthus an English monarch again prepared a great army with which to\r\nconquer Ireland.  The king landed at Waterford on October 13, 1394,\r\naccompanied by the Duke of Gloucester.  Ormonde soon joined him, and\r\nthe Irish were engaged in battle.  If the English king cherished any\r\nhopes that his deeds in Ireland might secure his tottering throne in\r\nEngland he was doomed to grievous disappointment.  He was defeated\r\nevery time he joined battle with the natives, and in the end he was\r\ncompelled to withdraw to Dublin and pass Christmas there.  A further\r\nseries of reverses followed, and Richard decided to have recourse to\r\narbitration and conciliation.  The Irish chieftains and nobles\r\nresponded, and by means of various concessions Richard was enabled to\r\nreturn to England with at least a remnant of his army.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy was now Roger de Mortimer, Earl {44} of March, cousin to\r\nRichard and heir to the throne of England.  De Mortimer had been\r\nviceroy in his youth, but not until this appointment--in 1395--did he\r\nrule in person.  In 1398 de Mortimer was killed in battle while leading\r\nhis soldiers, a tragedy which paved the way for Richard's deposition\r\nand the accession of Henry IV., and created the motive that led to the\r\nWars of the Roses.  John de Colton, now Archbishop of Armagh, again\r\nacted as temporary Governor while the Council proceeded to elect\r\nReginald Grey of Ruthyn, whose appointment, however, was vetoed by\r\nRichard.  His nominee was Thomas Holland, Duke of Surrey, who entered\r\nDublin in 1399.  Surrey's chief object was to people Ireland with\r\nEnglish settlers, a plan that was to be tried again some 200 years\r\nlater.  The viceroy could not carry out his plan for dispossessing the\r\nIrish, and he appealed to Richard for help, and so the king came on\r\nanother Irish expedition, landing in Ireland in 1399.  This time his\r\narmy was stronger and more experienced, but the result was a series of\r\ndefeats and the loss of the throne of England.  While Henry was seizing\r\nthe crown his son, afterwards Henry V., was with Richard in Ireland,\r\nbut the king accepted the youth's explanation that he knew nothing of\r\nhis father's designs.  As it was, Richard trusted to the fact that the\r\nlegal heir to the throne was Edmund, Earl of March, son of the late\r\nviceroy.  Henry's success to the exclusion of Edmund de Mortimer was\r\nthe cause of the Wars of the Roses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Viceregal poverty]\r\n\r\nSir John de Stanley, ever ready to step into a {45} breach, was again\r\ndeputy, and he reigned in Dublin Castle to November, 1402.  In 1401\r\nHenry IV., anxious to secure the allegiance of the English colony,\r\nappointed his second son, Prince Thomas of Lancaster, viceroy.  The\r\nyouthful prince--he was only thirteen when in November, 1402, he\r\narrived in Ireland--was provided with a specially selected Council, but\r\nevidently not with the necessary money, as there is a letter extant\r\nfrom the Council to King Henry which vividly describes the position of\r\nthe viceroy.  Henry had been asked for supplies, but as his own coffers\r\nwere empty he could not send anything, and, realizing the seriousness\r\nof their position, the Council addressed His Majesty in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n'With heavy hearts we testify anew to your highness that our lord, your\r\nson, is so destitute of money that he has not a penny in the world, nor\r\ncan borrow a single penny, because all his jewels and his plate that he\r\ncan spare of those which he must of necessity keep are pledged, and lie\r\nin pawn.  Also his soldiers have departed from him, and the people of\r\nhis household are on the point of leaving, and, however much they might\r\nwish to remain, it is not in our lord's power to keep together, with a\r\nview to his aid, twenty or a dozen persons with me, your humble\r\napplicant of Dublin, and your humble liege, Janico, who has paid for\r\nyour use his very all, but we will render our entire duty to him so\r\nlong as we shall live, as we are bound by our sovereign obligation to\r\nyou.  And the country is so weakened and impoverished by the long\r\nnonpayment, as well in the time of our {46} lord, your son, as in the\r\ntime of other lieutenants before him, that the same land can no longer\r\nbear such charge as they affirm, and on this account have they\r\nimportuned me.  In good faith, our most sovereign lord, it is\r\nmarvellous that they have borne such a charge so long.  Wherefore we\r\nentreat, with all the humility and fulness that we may, that you will\r\nplease to ordain speedy remedy of these said dangers and\r\ninconveniences, and to hold us excused also if any peril or\r\ndisaster--which may God avert--befall our lord, your son, by the said\r\ncauses.  For the more full declaring of these matters to your highness\r\nthe three of us should have come to your high presence, but such is the\r\ngreat danger on this side that not one of us dares depart from the\r\nperson of our lord.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prince Thomas's tenure]\r\n\r\nThis eloquent appeal was unheeded, but the prince did not return to\r\nEngland until November, 1403, appointing Sir Stephen le Scrope, his\r\ndeputy, and when that soldier retired in 1405 placing James, third Earl\r\nof Ormonde, at the head of the Government.  The death of the deputy in\r\nthe same year led to the advancement of Gerald, fifth Earl of Kildare,\r\nwhose rule was ended dramatically by the sudden reappearance of Prince\r\nThomas in 1408 and the imprisonment of his deputy.  Two years earlier\r\nthe prince, having lost his indenture creating him Viceroy of Ireland,\r\nwas reappointed for twelve years at a salary of L7,000 a year.\r\nRemembering his previous experiences, the prince had a clause inserted\r\nwhich entitled him to leave Ireland if his salary was a month in\r\narrear.  It was also agreed that in the event of the king or {47} the\r\nPrince of Wales deciding to take over the government Prince Thomas was\r\nto have six months' notice.  The Earl of Kildare was released as soon\r\nas he paid a fine of 300 marks for having interfered in an\r\necclesiastical appointment.  Prince Thomas remained two years at his\r\npost, retiring from the country in 1410, and selecting a son of James,\r\nthird Earl of Ormonde, as his deputy.  This was Prior Thomas le\r\nBotiller.\r\n\r\nBut the colonists could endure the Prior for three years only, and they\r\nsucceeded in getting Sir John de Stanley reappointed.  He was, however,\r\ntoo old to be of much use, and at his death in 1414 the Archbishop of\r\nDublin, who was the author of the pathetic plea to Henry IV., assumed\r\nthe government for a few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{48}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe state of the English colony was now so precarious that Henry IV.\r\ndecided to send one of his most trusted and capable military commanders\r\nto act as viceroy.  This was Sir John Talbot, and his appointment was\r\nhailed with joy.  Talbot was given a term of six years of office, and a\r\nsalary of L2,666 13s. 4d.  It was a large income, but as it was seldom\r\npaid, that was a detail which must have impressed Henry as being quite\r\nunimportant.  During his occasional journeys to England, the Archbishop\r\nof Dublin acted as the deputy.  Talbot soon intimated to the leading\r\nmembers of the English colony that as his salary was in arrear he\r\nintended leaving the country.  This was tantamount to placing them at\r\nthe mercy of the Irish, whom Talbot had repelled from Dublin many\r\ntimes.  Thereupon the colonists petitioned the king, but without\r\nsuccess, and Sir John departed in 1419, ostensibly recalled by the\r\nking, and leaving his brother, William Talbot, Archbishop of Dublin, to\r\nrepresent him.  Sir John Talbot, however, was destined to renew his\r\nacquaintance with the viceroyalty.\r\n\r\nThe brief authority of the archbishop was succeeded by three years\r\nunder James, fourth {49} Earl of Ormonde; and then Edmund de Mortimer,\r\nfifth Earl of March and Ulster, began a viceroyalty which lasted for\r\nless than two years, although he was appointed for nine.  Edmund de\r\nMortimer was the legal heir to Richard II., but he was an unambitious\r\nman, and there was no guile in him.  He appointed Edward Dantsey,\r\nBishop of Meath, his deputy, but William Talbot, Archbishop of Dublin,\r\ndeclined to recognize the authority of his ecclesiastical inferior, and\r\nconsequently the viceroy had to come to Dublin.  This was in 1424, and\r\nthe following year the plague carried him off.  Sir John Talbot was\r\nthen induced to accept the viceroyalty, but his services were wanted\r\nnearer home, and he agreed to the reappointment of the Earl of Ormonde,\r\nwho acted for two years, and helped to maintain a sort of peace by\r\nconciliating the native Irish.\r\n\r\nThe viceroyalties of Sir John de Gray (1427-28), Sir John Sutton\r\n(1428-29), Sir Thomas le Strange (1429-31), and Sir Leon de Welles and\r\nhis brother, William, who became his deputy (1438-46), were\r\nundistinguished.  The deposed Earl of Ormonde succeeded in clearing\r\nhimself of a charge of high treason, but the result of the bitterness\r\nand dissensions the charge provoked and fostered were felt for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earl of Shrewsbury]\r\n\r\nThe reappointment of Sir John Talbot, now Earl of Shrewsbury, brought\r\nthat strong and merciless old man--he was seventy-three--back to\r\nIreland.  He was created Earl of Waterford and Wexford, and Constable\r\nof Ireland, but even the valour and wiles of one of the bravest of {50}\r\nwarriors could not prevail against the owners of the land which had\r\nbeen granted to Talbot.  Several times he quaintly informed the king\r\nthat he was unable to collect a penny of his rents, an admission which\r\nthe monarch politely disregarded.  But Talbot left his mark on Ireland.\r\nLong service in the Continental wars had taught him many forms of\r\ncruelty and lust, and at seventy-three he showed that he had not\r\nforgotten what he had learnt.  Not always victorious, he was always\r\ncruel and vicious.  He found time to ape the statesman by presiding\r\nover a Parliament that decreed various ordinances, including the\r\nprohibition of moustaches--which were then almost exclusively worn by\r\nthe native Irish, and coming into fashion amongst the Anglo-Irish.  A\r\nwriter of the period described Talbot as another Herod, and the\r\ncountry, including the colonists, who had found in him an oppressor\r\ninstead of a protector, sighed with relief when the charms of a\r\ncontinental war called him from Ireland, and he left the Archbishop of\r\nDublin to represent him.  Talbot was little better than a hireling, and\r\nwhen he was killed at the age of eighty in a battle in France, he was\r\nnot fighting for his country or for himself, but for a salary, and, no\r\ndoubt, inspired by the lust of conflict.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A mother of kings]\r\n\r\nTalbot's retirement from Dublin enabled the king to remove a dangerous\r\nperson, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, from his court, but although\r\nthe duke's commission as viceroy was executed in 1447, he did not see\r\nfit to leave England until 1449, landing at Howth, near Dublin, on {51}\r\nJuly 6.  His deputy, Richard Nugent, met him and the duchess, a\r\nremarkable woman, who was one of the Earl of Westmorland's twenty-two\r\nchildren, and was the most beautiful of them all.  Denied the throne\r\nfor herself, she became the mother of two kings--Edward IV. and Richard\r\nIII.--and it was her counsels which shaped her husband's destiny in\r\nIreland.  As befitting a prince of the blood royal, the duke made a\r\ntriumphal entry into Dublin, and, guided by his wife, wisely\r\nconciliated the native chiefs and the leaders of the Anglo-Irish.  They\r\ngave many banquets and entertainments in Dublin Castle, at which Irish\r\nand English mingled, quarrels being forgotten in the presence of the\r\nwoman who was known as 'The Rose of Raby.'  And when on October 21,\r\n1449, she gave birth in Dublin Castle to her ninth child, George,\r\nafterwards Duke of Clarence, she diplomatically invited the Earls of\r\nDesmond and Ormonde to stand as sponsors.\r\n\r\nThe object of the duke and duchess was, of course, to gain adherents in\r\nIreland for the coming conflict between the rival claimants to the\r\nthrone of England.  For hundreds of years Ireland had been looked upon\r\nas a source of income to the Kings of England; the viceroyalty was a\r\nplace of profit, and most of the profits went into the king's treasury.\r\nRichard had many followers in England, and they were well aware of the\r\nfact that his viceroyalty was merely a pretext for exiling him, but\r\nthey made good use of the misfortune, continually noising it abroad\r\nthat the Duke of York was accomplishing wonders in {52} Ireland, that\r\nhis statesmanship, diplomacy, and valour proved indisputably that when\r\nthe time came he would make an admirable king of both countries.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of a policy of conciliation, however, was the lack of\r\nrevenues.  Taxes could only be levied by force, and the viceroy\r\ndeprecated that.  He pawned his jewels manfully, and borrowed from his\r\nfriends in England, France, and Ireland.  Twice he wrote to the king\r\nasking for supplies, but that monarch had no intention of disguising\r\nthe exile by lavishing money upon him, and the duke was compelled to\r\nreturn to England.  This was in 1450, and for the next nine years he\r\nwas absent from the country, his deputies in turn being the Archbishop\r\nof Armagh, 1454, Edmund Fitz-Eustace, 1454, and Thomas Fitz-Gerald,\r\nEarl of Kildare, who acted from 1455 to 1459.  The duke's first choice\r\nwas Sir James le Botiller, who was created Earl of Wiltshire before he\r\nsucceeded his father in the Earldom of Ormonde, but this nobleman\r\nresided chiefly in England, and eventually became a Lancastrian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Independence of its Parliament]\r\n\r\nThe bewildering changes of fortune brought about by the Wars of the\r\nRoses had their full effect upon Ireland.  The Duke of York was, of\r\ncourse, the leader of the Yorkists, and his sun was at its zenith when\r\nhe defeated the Lancastrians at St. Albans and captured Henry VI.  He\r\nwas declared Protector of England and Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.  In\r\n1459 fortune turned against him; he was beaten in several encounters,\r\nand, finally, fled to Ireland with a few followers.  In Dublin {53} he\r\nfound some consolation, although he had been unable to bring his wife\r\nwith him.  The Irish and the English joyfully welcomed him, and the\r\nIrish Parliament met at once and proclaimed him viceroy, formally\r\ndeclaring the acts of the Lancastrian Parliament at Coventry null and\r\nvoid so far as they concerned Ireland.  The most significant feature of\r\nthis meeting of the Irish Parliament was the formal statement that it\r\nwas absolutely and entirely independent, and could not be controlled by\r\nthe English Parliament.  It acknowledged the obedience of Ireland to\r\nEngland, but 'nevertheless, it was separate from it and from all its\r\nlaws and statutes except such as were accepted by the lords spiritual\r\nand temporal.'  Richard established a mint at his castle of Trim; his\r\nson, Edmund, Earl of Rutland, was appointed Chancellor of Ireland, the\r\nviceroy's person was declared sacred, and conspiracy against him high\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of York was undoubtedly the most popular man in Ireland, but\r\nthe Lancastrians, who had gained the adherence of the Earl of Ormonde\r\nand Wiltshire, looked to the latter to remove the viceroy.  The earl\r\nsent one of his retainers to arrest the duke on a charge of falsely\r\nrepresenting himself to be His Majesty's--Henry VI.--Lieutenant for\r\nIreland.  The luckless squire was seized by Richard's officers, brought\r\nto trial, and eventually hanged, drawn, and quartered.  The next move\r\nof the Lancastrian party was an abortive attempt to induce the native\r\nIrish to turn against the viceroy and murder him.  {54} This charge was\r\ndenied vigorously, but there was every reason to believe that it was\r\ntrue.  The Earls of Kildare and Desmond, however, came to Richard's\r\naid, and they speedily secured the allegiance of the principal\r\nchieftains in Leinster and Munster.  News of Yorkists' triumphs in\r\nEngland took Richard hastily to London, where he found an excited\r\npopulace awaiting him, and calling upon him to crown himself King of\r\nEngland.  The path to the throne seemed easy, but Queen Margaret,\r\nmaking one desperate rally for her family, met Richard near Wakefield\r\non the last day of 1461, defeated his army, and killed him.\r\n\r\nA nebulous state of affairs now existed in Ireland.  The Earl of\r\nKildare ceased to be deputy at Richard's death, and Sir Roland\r\nFitz-Eustace, who acted as deputy to the new viceroy, George, Duke of\r\nClarence, was a mere figurehead.  In 1464 the Earl of Desmond succeeded\r\nas deputy to Clarence, but he incurred the enmity of Elizabeth Grey,\r\nEdward's plebeian wife, and she induced her husband to supersede the\r\nIrish earl by one of her favourites, the Earl of Worcester.  The\r\nmarriage of Edward IV. and Elizabeth Grey had caused much dissension in\r\nEnglish court circles, and the king regarded any criticism of his\r\naction as being tantamount to high treason.  A contemptuous remark\r\nabout Elizabeth Grey cost the Earl of Desmond his life, Worcester\r\nexecuting him at Drogheda in 1468, ostensibly on a charge of high\r\ntreason.  It was said that Edward IV., when quarrelling with his wife,\r\nhad angrily exclaimed that he, if he had taken the advice of the {55}\r\nEarl of Desmond, would not have found himself burdened by such a wife.\r\nElizabeth never forgot this, and, as we have seen, it led the deputy to\r\nhis death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. Patrick's Hall, Dublin Castle]\r\n\r\nWorcester retired in 1468, and the Earl of Kildare ruled for the absent\r\nDuke of Clarence.  Edward IV., however, began to entertain fears that\r\nthe young Prince might imitate the example of his late father, and make\r\nthe viceroyalty an office rivalling the throne itself, and convert\r\nIreland into a stronghold against him and his house.  The Duke of\r\nClarence and the Earl of Warwick were undoubtedly conspiring against\r\nEdward, who promptly offered a reward of L1,000 or L100 a year for life\r\nto whoever captured the duke or the earl.  The latter, however, did not\r\nsurvive the _coup d'etat_ of 1470, when Henry VI. was restored\r\ntemporarily.  The Earl of Warwick, who was nominally Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nIreland, being represented there by Edmund Dudley, was beheaded by the\r\nEarl of Oxford on Tower Hill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duke of Clarence]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Clarence, who had the faculty of pleasing both parties, was\r\nappointed Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1470 by Henry VI., and on the\r\ndeposition of that monarch Edward IV. confirmed the appointment,\r\ngranting him the office for twenty years, to date from 1472.  Meanwhile\r\nthe Earl of Kildare continued to rule the country until 1475.  Then the\r\nBishop of Meath, William Sherwood, acted for a time, until Gerald,\r\nninth Earl of Kildare, became deputy.  In 1478 Clarence was removed,\r\nand John de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, was appointed Lord-Lieutenant for\r\n{56} twenty years.  He could not rule in person, however, and so he\r\nconveniently appointed his infant son, George, to the office, at the\r\nsame time nominating Lord Grey as his locum tenens.  Grey arrived in\r\nDublin to find that the Earl of Kildare refused to recognize his\r\nauthority, giving as a reason his opinion that Grey's appointment was\r\nmade under the Privy Seal, and was, therefore, illegal.  The Chancellor\r\nsided with Kildare, declined to surrender the Great Seal for Ireland,\r\nand advised Kildare to summon a Parliament at Naas.  That complacent\r\nassembly voted the Earl a subsidy.  This was the state of affairs in\r\n1478, and it really marked the beginning of the great struggle between\r\nIreland and England.  By now the Anglo-Irish families had lost their\r\nsympathies for the English and had become almost exclusively Irish.\r\n\r\nGrey proceeded to hold a Parliament of his own at Trim, and, of course,\r\nit formally annulled all the acts passed by Kildare's assembly.  These\r\nParliaments were merely travesties of the word as understood to-day;\r\nthey did not represent even the opinions of those permitted to take\r\npart in their proceedings, while a cynical disregard of the English\r\ncolony was their most characteristic feature.  They were termed\r\n'Parliaments' in order to dignify the proceedings, but their only use\r\nwas to declare their subjection to the person summoning them.\r\n\r\nThe death of the infant Prince George in 1479 enabled Grey to retire\r\nfrom the contest with dignity, and for two years Robert Preston, first\r\n{57} Viscount Gormanstown, represented the nominal viceroy, Richard,\r\nDuke of York.  Then in 1481 the Earl of Kildare, the only man who could\r\nrule Ireland with any hope of success, was reappointed deputy to the\r\nyoung prince.  The death of Edward IV. and the accession of Edward V.\r\nfound Kildare still in power.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious disappearance of the king and his younger brother from\r\nthe Tower of London brought Richard III. to the throne, and he\r\nnominated his son, Edward, aged eleven, viceroy for a period of three\r\nyears, Kildare remaining as deputy.  It was announced throughout the\r\ncolony that Richard intended visiting Ireland, and Kildare was,\r\ntherefore, declared Lord-Deputy for one year only.  The death of Prince\r\nEdward in 1484 brought the viceroyalty to Richard's nephew, John de la\r\nPole, Earl of Lincoln, but the Battle of Bosworth opened a new era for\r\nIreland as well as for England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of Bosworth Field]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Kildare, notified of the appointment of the new king's\r\nuncle, Jasper, Duke of Bedford, declined to be bound by the results of\r\nthe Battle of Bosworth Field, and when a priest brought to Ireland a\r\nboy whom he declared to be the Earl of Warwick, son of the late Duke of\r\nClarence, and therefore the rightful heir to the throne of England,\r\nKildare eagerly seized the opportunity thus presented.  Lambert Simnel,\r\nthe youth in question, was received with royal honours by Kildare and\r\nthe Anglo-Irish, his claims declared proved, and his identity admitted.\r\nOn May 24, 1487, the impostor was crowned King {58} of England and\r\nIreland under the title of Edward VI.  The ceremony took place in the\r\nCathedral of the Holy Trinity, and in the presence of the whole\r\nviceregal staff, the principal ecclesiastics and the civic officials,\r\nKildare had the leading part after Lambert Simnel, although the Earl of\r\nLincoln, who had been appointed viceroy by his uncle, Richard III., was\r\nalso present.  Immediately the coronation was over a special coinage\r\nwas struck, and the comedy protracted by the creation of Kildare as\r\nRegent and Protector.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Lincoln was given the command of the army to strike the\r\ndecisive blow in England, but the Duke of Bedford, Henry's viceroy, met\r\nthe rebel forces at Stoke and crushed them.  Simnel was taken prisoner,\r\nand Henry, with that sense of humour and a political tact rare in\r\nmonarchs, decided to emphasize his victory by ridicule rather than the\r\nexecutioner's axe.  Simnel was made a turnspit in the royal kitchens\r\nand a salary paid him regularly.  Had he been executed, his unlucky\r\nfollowers might have made him a hero and themselves patriots; as it\r\nwas, they were compelled to seek oblivion for their cause and hide\r\ntheir shame.  Kildare, however, remained defiant.  To him Simnel had\r\nbeen only the means to an end that had enabled him to demonstrate to\r\nthe English throne and its advisers that the destinies of Ireland could\r\nnot be subject to the vagaries of English politicians.  Henry\r\ndetermined to try diplomatic persuasion, and he sent Sir Richard\r\nEdgecombe, a Privy Councillor, to offer Kildare {59} a free pardon if\r\nhe would swear fealty to the king and give a bond for his good\r\nbehaviour.  The deputy offered to submit, though he would not give a\r\nbond, and after considerable wrangling the question of security was\r\nwaived aside, and the Earl of Kildare once more reigned in Dublin\r\nCastle.  The records of the meetings between Kildare and Edgecombe are\r\nvery full, and it would seem that the earl's threats to turn\r\n'Irish'--that is, formally separate his family from England--had more\r\nto do with Henry's capitulation than anything else.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perkin Warbeck]\r\n\r\nKildare's appointment was as deputy to the Duke of Bedford, and for\r\nfour years Irish affairs had no connection with English.  But the\r\nsuccess of usurpers breeds impostors, and Henry, who had seized his\r\nthrone by force, had once more to face an impostor and a rebellion.\r\nPerkin Warbeck, avowing himself to be Richard, Duke of York, and armed\r\nwith a circumstantial story of his escape from the Tower of London,\r\nlanded at Cork, having journeyed from Lisbon, and sent messages to\r\nKildare ordering him to join him there with an army.  Whatever the\r\nearl's answer may have been, Perkin did not wait for it, preferring to\r\nseek temporary safety in Paris.  The deputy, however, had always shown\r\na fondness for impostors, and Henry, unable to trust any of the leaders\r\nof the English in Ireland, sent Walter Fitz-Simon to be the deputy in\r\nplace of Kildare.  Fitz-Simon worked assiduously to secure the Earl's\r\nfall, and when he returned to England in 1493, leaving Viscount\r\nGormanstown as his deputy, he was able {60} to nullify the effects of\r\nKildare's passionate protests to Henry VII.  The next year Henry\r\nappointed his son, then aged four, afterwards Henry VIII., to be\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and his deputy was the notorious profligate\r\nand zealous soldier, Sir Edward Poynings, the son of Elizabeth Paston.\r\nThe \"Paston Letters\" throw much light upon the workings of the\r\nviceroyalty of the period, although Poynings himself had only a couple\r\nof years' experience of that country.  He did Henry two notable acts of\r\nservice, however, by capturing Kildare and sending him a prisoner to\r\nLondon, and by driving Perkin Warbeck out of Ireland.\r\n\r\nWhen Kildare was imprisoned in the Tower of London, his fate seemed\r\nsettled, but he was too clever for the age he lived in, and he\r\nsucceeded, a stranger in a strange country, in securing his liberation\r\nand the annulling by Parliament of his act of attainder.  Kildare\r\nthereupon became the lion of the London season.  He was invited\r\neverywhere, and every class of society crowded to see the man who had\r\nheld Ireland in his power.  All the time he was nominally under arrest,\r\nwith serious charges pending against him.  When Henry summoned the earl\r\nto his presence, and offered him the choice of any man in the kingdom\r\nto be his counsellor, Kildare promptly chose the king himself!  It was\r\na piece of shrewd flattery, but it had less to do with Kildare's\r\nrestoration to favour than his marriage with the king's first cousin,\r\nElizabeth, daughter of Oliver St. John.  The moment his alliance with\r\nthe clever daughter of a {61} powerful family became known, Kildare's\r\nenemies melted away, and the king, saving his face by insisting upon\r\nKildare's son remaining in London as a hostage for his father's good\r\nconduct, restored Kildare to his deputyship, and sent him back to\r\nIreland.  Henry Deane, a cleric who had been holding the post, retired,\r\nand was rewarded later with the See of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nThe character of Kildare is well illustrated by a story told concerning\r\nhis fiery temper.  The Bishop of Meath, suffering from jealousy and a\r\ngrievance, declared to the king that all Ireland could not rule the\r\nearl.  'Then, in good faith,' cried the king, 'shall the earl rule all\r\nIreland!'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Hill of the Axes]\r\n\r\nPerkin Warbeck revisited Ireland, but the men of Waterford drove him\r\nfrom the country without any help from Dublin.  In 1503 Kildare was\r\nsummoned to London to receive evidence of the king's pleasure and\r\napprobation.  This took the shape of a portion of the king's wardrobe,\r\na signal mark of honour in those days.  Returning with his son Gerald,\r\nwho had married into a powerful English family, Kildare won the famous\r\nBattle of Knocdoe, or 'The Hill of the Axes,' and was given the garter\r\nfor his success.  The Battle of Knocdoe was the result of a bitter\r\nquarrel between the Earl of Kildare and the Earl of Clanricarde.  The\r\nlatter had married a daughter of the deputy's, and had treated her with\r\nsuch cruelty that Kildare intervened.  In revenge Clanricarde formed a\r\nconfederacy between certain Irish chiefs to overthrow the authority of\r\nthe king in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{62}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe death of Henry VII. and the accession of Henry VIII. tended to\r\nstrengthen Kildare's position.  He was continued in his office, and\r\nheld it until his death in 1513.  Accounted one of the handsomest and\r\nbravest men of his time, he was succeeded by his son in the deputyship,\r\nas well as in the family honours, and Gerald, ninth earl, was worthy of\r\nsuch a parent.  For seven years Kildare was the deputy, with the\r\nexception of a brief period in England when Viscount Gormanstown was\r\nvice-deputy.  His enemies were secretly trying to undermine his\r\nposition, for the rise of the Kildare family was resented by the other\r\ngreat Anglo-Irish houses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cardinal Wolsey's nominee]\r\n\r\nIn 1518, shortly after the death of his wife, Kildare was ordered to\r\nrepair to London and answer the charges that he had illegally enriched\r\nhimself and his followers, and that he had formed alliances with the\r\nnative Irish and corresponded with them.  Kildare, however, showed no\r\nhurry to obey the summons, and not until 1519 did he arrive in London,\r\nhis cousin, Sir Maurice Fitzgerald, looking after his official\r\nresponsibilities.  While in London, Kildare followed the example of his\r\nfather, and married a cousin of the king.  {63} This was the Lady\r\nElizabeth Grey, a grand-daughter of Elizabeth Woodville, Edward IV.'s\r\nwife.  The marriage saved Kildare's life, for his most powerful enemy,\r\nCardinal Wolsey, had resolved that the Irish earl should never return\r\nto his country.  Acting on the advice of the Cardinal, Henry VIII.,\r\nsuspicious of the loyalty of the Irish nobility, appointed an\r\nEnglishman, the Earl of Surrey, afterwards Duke of Norfolk,\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland.  Surrey was one of Wolsey's adherents, and\r\nalthough the Earl of Kildare had, by reason of his valour and bearing\r\non the famous 'Field of the Cloth of Gold,' risen high in Henry's\r\nfavour, the Chancellor insisted upon his being brought to trial.  To\r\nmake certain of the result, Wolsey inspired the Earl of Surrey to write\r\nfrom Ireland charging Kildare with having attempted to make the Irish\r\noppose the authority of the new deputy, but, owing to the influence of\r\nhis wife, Kildare secured his acquittal, and returned to Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Ormonde was selected in 1523 to succeed Surrey, principally\r\nbecause he was Kildare's bitter enemy, but Elizabeth, Henry's cousin\r\nand Kildare's wife, wrote to the king beseeching him to reconcile the\r\nearls and bring peace to their respective families.  Henry responded by\r\nsending a commission to try the charges preferred by Ormonde against\r\nKildare, and, when it found in favour of the latter, he became deputy\r\nonce more.  But again his enjoyment of the office was brief, further\r\ncharges being preferred against him by Ormonde, now Earl of {64}\r\nOssory.  Again Kildare went to London, and was imprisoned in the Tower,\r\nhis brother, Sir James Fitzgerald, taking his post.  While Kildare was\r\nin the Tower, Wolsey attempted to have him executed without the\r\nknowledge of the king, but at the last moment the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nsought confirmation from His Majesty, and discovered that the\r\nCardinal's order lacked the king's approval.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Ossory was now deputy, Kildare remaining in London after\r\nhis release from the Tower.  Several noblemen went bail for his good\r\nconduct, and although there was another period of royal disfavour in\r\n1532, he accompanied Sir William Skeffington, the new Lord-Deputy, to\r\nIreland, and received a welcome that overshadowed that accorded to the\r\nking's representative.  It is interesting to note that in 1530 Holbein\r\npainted this remarkable man's portrait, and that in the same year he\r\nwas one of the peers who signed the letter to the Pope setting forth\r\nthe grounds of Henry's divorce from Catherine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of \"King Kildare\"]\r\n\r\nIn 1532 he was once more deputy, and he gained the adherence of the\r\nIrish by marrying two of his daughters to Irish chiefs.  The country\r\nwas now at his feet; he was respected and obeyed.  But he had enemies\r\nwhose pertinacity equalled his, and they soon aroused the suspicions of\r\na monarch whose chief weakness was a disinclination to trust others or\r\ncultivate loyalty in himself.  Henry at once ordered the deputy to come\r\nto him; instead, Kildare sent his wife to act as mediator.  The\r\ncountess was a clever woman, but Henry's {65} experience of the sex was\r\nextensive, as we know, and he declined to receive her more than once.\r\nHe wanted the person of Kildare, and eventually that nobleman obeyed\r\nthe summons.  The earl appointed his twenty-year old son, Thomas, Lord\r\nOffaly, deputy, and left Ireland, never to return.  Lord Offaly was\r\nsomething of the mould of his father, and, although young, had been\r\ntrained from early years to rule.  When, therefore, a rumour reached\r\nDublin that the Earl of Kildare had been executed by Henry's orders,\r\nLord Offaly immediately resigned his office, and gathered his followers\r\nunder his banner with the avowed object of driving the English out of\r\nIreland.  The earl was quickly apprised of his son's rebellion, and a\r\ncopy of the youthful lord's sentence of excommunication shown him.  The\r\neffect was to hasten Kildare's death, and he died in the Tower on\r\nDecember 12, 1534.  Great as had been his father, Gerald, ninth earl,\r\nwas even greater, and Wolsey, although he spoke sarcastically, was not\r\nwrong when he described him as 'King Kildare, who reigned, rather than\r\nruled, in Ireland.'\r\n\r\nSir William Skeffington, the deputy, was ordered to crush the\r\nrebellion, and he pursued the Kildare faction into their strongholds,\r\nbesieging the Castle of Maynooth, while its owner was in Connaught\r\ncollecting troops.  The castle could have held out until the arrival of\r\nits owner, but the inevitable Irish traitor appeared in the person of\r\nChristopher Parese, a creature who had received many benefits at the\r\nhands of Lord Offaly and his father.  Parese betrayed the castle for a\r\nreward, which was {66} promptly paid him, but the deputy immediately\r\nhad him executed, because he dare not trust a rogue who had already\r\nbetrayed one benefactor.  Treachery was again employed by Skeffington's\r\nsuccessor, Lord Grey, and eventually Lord Offaly, tenth Earl of\r\nKildare, and five of his uncles were executed on Tower Hill.  The\r\nten-year-old heir to the earldom would, doubtless, have perished also,\r\nbut he had a remarkable mother, who kept him in hiding for some years,\r\nand succeeded in smuggling him out of the country to France, where his\r\neducation was supervised by the famous Cardinal Pole.\r\n\r\nLord Grey continued in office until 1540, and although, from the\r\nEnglish point of view, he ruled well and successfully, on his return to\r\nEngland he was imprisoned and subsequently executed, the ostensible\r\nreason being his partiality for the Kildares.\r\n\r\nGrey was replaced by a remarkable man, Sir Anthony St. Leger, whose\r\nthree terms of office covered thirteen years.  Sir William Brereton, a\r\nfoolish person, was the deputy until St. Leger arrived, and\r\ndistinguished himself by leading a vast army in search of a phantom\r\nenemy.  St. Leger, from the moment he arrived in Ireland, set about\r\nrestoring some order in the country, and he succeeded so well that the\r\nhistorians of the period call attention to the amazing fact that the\r\nsight was actually seen of English lords and Irish chiefs meeting in\r\nthe same chamber and proclaiming Henry VIII. King of Ireland.  St.\r\nLeger went further than this, and {67} actually paid the debts incurred\r\nduring his viceroyalty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious persecution]\r\n\r\nIn 1548 he was recalled, and Sir Edward Bellingham ordered to act as\r\ndeputy and to punish those Irish who had not become Protestants by Act\r\nof Parliament.  This was a new feature in Irish politics, but\r\nBellingham found diplomacy, force, and threats, and persecution equally\r\nineffective, and he retired in disgust.  Sir Francis Bryan followed as\r\ndeputy in 1550, but he died the same year, and Brabazon, hastily\r\nelected in his stead, retired when Sir Anthony St. Leger returned, to\r\nbe welcomed by all classes.  He held office until 1556, save for a\r\nperiod between 1551-52, when Sir James Croft represented him, and when\r\nhe retired he had the satisfaction of knowing that he left Ireland\r\nbetter off than when he found it.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of the Earl of Sussex, however, undid all St. Leger's\r\ngood work, and the new deputy had immediately to take the field.  He\r\nwas lucky, however, to find the Irish chiefs quarrelling amongst\r\nthemselves, and in the circumstances victory was achieved easily.  The\r\nO'Neills, headed by the famous Shane, advanced against him, but Sussex\r\ndefeated them with great slaughter, and the chieftain escaped the\r\nbattlefield to die a dishonourable death in a drunken brawl.\r\n\r\nEngland had greater attractions for the earl than Ireland could offer,\r\nand he returned there in 1557, nominating Sir Henry Sidney and the Lord\r\nChancellor as vice-deputies.  Elizabeth, {68} immediately after her\r\naccession, sent the viceroy back, but he returned again to London.\r\nHugh Curwen, Archbishop of Dublin, anxious to retain his office as well\r\nas that of joint representative with Sir Henry Sidney of the absent\r\nviceroy, conveniently changed his religion now that a Protestant was on\r\nthe throne, and to show the genuineness of his conversion he had the\r\npictures that adorned the walls of Christ's Church and St. Patrick's\r\nwhitewashed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earl of Essex]\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl of Sussex was recalled in 1564, Sir Henry Sidney was\r\nappointed deputy or viceroy, and he acted for fourteen years.  What he\r\nthought of the appointment may be inferred from a letter he wrote on\r\nhis return after a brief absence in 1575.  Sir William Fitz-William had\r\nacted as his deputy, and no doubt Sidney hoped that Elizabeth might\r\ngive him a more congenial task.  He declares that he 'took on for the\r\nthird time that thankless charge, and so, taking leave of Her Majesty,\r\nkissed her sacred hands, with most gracious and comfortable words,\r\ndeparted from her at Dudley Castle, passed the seas, and arrived\r\nSeptember 13, 1575, as near the city of Dublin as I could safely, for\r\nat that time the city was grievously infected with the contagion of the\r\npestilence.'  In the depth of winter he went to Cork, and passed\r\nChristmas there.  The following February he visited Thomond, Earl of\r\nClanricarde, and caused two of his sons to make public confession of\r\ntheir rebellion and sue for his pardon.  Sidney, in recounting this,\r\nadds fervently, 'whom would to God I had hanged!'\r\n\r\n{69}\r\n\r\nSidney's interview with Grace O'Malley is historic.  The English\r\nwarrior, unaccustomed to Amazonian women, out of curiosity granted an\r\naudience to Grace, who came to him in state.  This is how the viceroy\r\ndescribes the incident:\r\n\r\n'There came to me also a most famous feminine sea-captain, called Grace\r\nO'Malley, and offered her services to me wheresoe'er I would command\r\nher, with three galleys and two hundred fighting men.  She brought with\r\nher her husband, for she was as well by sea as by land more than\r\nmaster's mate with him.  He was of the nether Burkes, and called by\r\nnickname \"Richard in Iron.\"  This was a notorious woman in all the\r\ncoasts of Ireland.  This woman did Henry Sidney see and speak with.  He\r\ncan no more at large inform you of her.'\r\n\r\nOn May 26, 1578, Sidney retired from office, broken in health and\r\nfortune.  Describing his condition, he says that he was 'fifty-four\r\nyears of age, toothless and trembling, being five thousand pounds in\r\ndebt.'  Later he declared that he was twenty thousand pounds poorer\r\nthan when he had succeeded to his father's estate--a commentary on his\r\ninability to take advantage in a pecuniary sense of his viceroyalty.\r\nHis wail is dated 'from Ludlow Castle, with more pain than heart, March\r\n1, 1582.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English colony absorbed]\r\n\r\nBut Sidney was the victim of his time.  There was no English colony\r\nnow; it had been absorbed by the native Irish families, and to make war\r\nagainst the natives was to make war against the {70} Fitzgeralds, the\r\nButlers, and other great families better known by their titles.\r\nHappily for England, Ireland was never united, and if Sidney gained no\r\ngreat conquests he was, by reason of the schisms amongst his enemies,\r\nenabled to maintain the sovereignty of Elizabeth in Ireland.  It was a\r\npurely nominal sovereignty, but it sufficed for the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{71}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe gradual disappearance of the distinctively English population did\r\nnot pass unnoticed in England.  During some hundreds of years there had\r\nbeen many attempts to induce English families to emigrate to Ireland,\r\nbut without any great success.  To the average English person Ireland\r\nwas an uncivilized country inhabited by savages and murderers.\r\nElizabeth's councillors, however, resolved to put into practice the\r\ntheories of previous viceroys and their advisers.  A new English colony\r\nwas to be created, but instead of crowding all the emigrants into\r\nDublin, the bolder policy of scattering them all over the country was\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nOn the retirement of Sidney, Sir William Pelham was appointed Lord\r\nJustice until the arrival of Lord Grey of Wilton, 'the hanging\r\nviceroy.'  Two years of systematic brutalities were as much as the\r\ncountry and Elizabeth could stand.  She recalled Grey and left the\r\ngovernment in the hands of Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin, and Sir\r\nHenry Wallop, treasurer, while she and her council, now firmly resolved\r\non the great 'plantation' scheme, could find a willing and a competent\r\ninstrument to carry out the plan.  They found {72} one in Sir John\r\nPerrott, and in June, 1584, he was made Lord Deputy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The undertakers]\r\n\r\nPerrott was reputed to be a natural son of Henry VIII., whom he\r\nresembled in appearance, and, although brought up in the household of\r\nThomas Perrott, who had married Mary Berkeley, Henry's mistress, he\r\nsoon exchanged the serene life of a country gentleman for the freer and\r\ngayer court life of London.  He was advanced rapidly in the royal\r\nfavour, and before his deputyship had had considerable experience of\r\nIreland.  He now came as viceroy with a strong and definite policy,\r\nfully determined to carry it to a successful issue.  Munster was the\r\nfirst province selected for the 'plantation' scheme.  To induce English\r\nfamilies to flock to Ireland, huge estates were offered for next to\r\nnothing.  Fertile lands were given at rentals of a penny or twopence an\r\nacre, and to allow the immigrants time to put their new homes in order,\r\nno rent was asked during the first five years, and only half for the\r\nfollowing three.  Those who took over twelve thousand acres were termed\r\n'undertakers,' and required to settle or plant at least eighty-six\r\nEnglish families whose members were skilled in trades and the arts\r\nagricultural.  Undertakers of smaller estates planted a less number,\r\nand so on in due proportion.  It was a splendid scheme on paper, and\r\nwould, no doubt, have settled the Irish question effectively, but its\r\nweak point was its total disregard of the Irish.  The real owners of\r\nthe property were in hiding with prices on their heads, but the people\r\nthemselves were only awaiting {73} their opportunity to win back the\r\nlands of their chiefs and restore them to their rightful owners.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the 'undertakers'--wealthy English noblemen and titled\r\nadventurers--did not, of course, trouble to come to Ireland, though\r\nthey imported a number of families into the country.  Two of the\r\n'undertakers,' however, in Sir Walter Raleigh and Edmund Spenser, the\r\npoet, actually resided on their new estates.  Raleigh, as a reward for\r\nbutchering the peasantry, was given forty-two thousand acres; Spenser\r\nwas granted twelve thousand acres in Cork, and took up his residence in\r\nKilcolman Castle, residence in Ireland being the only condition upon\r\nwhich he was given the stolen land.  Spenser wrote the first three\r\nbooks of the 'Faerie Queen' here, and his only absence from Ireland was\r\noccasioned by a journey to London to secure the publication of his\r\nmasterpiece.  On his return he married a country girl, and managed to\r\nlive in some peace until 1598, when the Earl of Tyrone, eager to avenge\r\nhis wrongs, roused the country.  Kilcolman Castle was burnt to the\r\nground, and Spenser's youngest child perished in the flames.  The poet,\r\npenniless and ill, escaped to England to die in penury the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nPerrott's policy required a certain ruthlessness to carry out, and\r\nfriend and foe alike became his victims.  He could not be faithful to\r\nElizabeth and please all parties in Ireland.  He shared the fate of his\r\npredecessors who had adopted a similar policy, for he discovered that\r\nhe was being misrepresented in London by his personal enemies.  These\r\nincluded the Earl of Ormonde, Sir Richard {74} Brigham, and Sir\r\nNicholas Bagenal, and they even went to the length of bribing a priest\r\nto forge treasonable letters in the viceroy's name.  When Perrott\r\nappealed to Elizabeth to be allowed to come to England and confront his\r\nadversaries, the queen refused him his request, bidding him to continue\r\nwith his work.\r\n\r\nHe was destined to do England and Elizabeth at least one great service\r\nduring his viceroyalty.  In the middle of 1586 a rumour reached Ireland\r\nthat Spain was about to strike a blow for Catholic Christendom.\r\nIreland was, of course, Catholic, and always remained so, although its\r\nspiritual fathers were mostly 'vicars of Bray.'  The native Irish\r\nreceived the news joyfully, and waited anxiously for the day when the\r\nmight of Catholic Spain would annihilate Protestant England.  Perrott\r\nheard these rumours, and went to great trouble to verify them, with the\r\nresult that in 1587 he was able to send confidential despatches to\r\nQueen Elizabeth informing her that Philip of Spain was preparing a\r\ngreat fleet for the invasion and conquest of England.  That fleet,\r\nhistorically known as 'The Great Armada,' left its remnants off the\r\ncoast of Ireland in 1588.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perrott's retirement]\r\n\r\nWhen the viceroy realized that his policy, while outwardly prosperous,\r\nwas never likely to develop into a permanent success, he prayed the\r\nqueen to permit him to retire.  She was averse to this, but every\r\nperson of influence about the throne was approached by him until the\r\nqueen relented, and in 1588 the viceroy joyfully prepared to depart\r\nfrom the country which he hated worse than the {75} pestilence.  The\r\ncourt of England was then in an idealized state, mainly as a result of\r\nthe rise of the great English school of dramatists and poets, and at\r\nsuch a time Ireland must have seemed more than ever a place of exile.\r\nPerrott, however, openly prided himself upon his success, and when he\r\nappeared in Dublin in order to hand over the sword of state to his\r\nsuccessor, he made a fulsome speech in his own praise, declaring that\r\nhe left the country in peace and quietness, and hinting that if Sir\r\nWilliam Fitzwilliam, the incoming viceroy, informed Queen Elizabeth of\r\nthe fact, he would be very grateful.  Sir William, as a gentleman, had\r\nto acknowledge Perrott's eulogies, and then the ex-viceroy left the\r\ncountry, feeling like a freed man.  His last act was to present the\r\ncorporation of Dublin with a silver-gilt bowl bearing his arms and\r\ncrest, together with the motto 'Relinquo in pace.'  The common people\r\nhad a certain rough affection for Perrott.  He had not robbed\r\nthem--perhaps because they had nothing to lose--but at any rate they\r\ngave him a great ovation, shedding tears of gratitude for the man whose\r\ncode of morals happily included a partiality for paying just debts.\r\n\r\nSir William Fitzwilliam had already experienced the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of the viceregal position in Ireland.  He married a\r\nsister of Sir Henry Sidney, a woman with a strength of character that\r\nabsorbed her husband's.  Every act during Fitzwilliam's tenure of\r\noffice was said to have originated from the fertile brain of Lady\r\nFitzwilliam, and she was openly hailed as the real {76} ruler of\r\nIreland.  But even Lady Fitzwilliam could not govern without money, and\r\nin 1594 she retired with her husband.  Fitzwilliam is best known as the\r\nGovernor of Fotheringay Castle at the time of the execution of Mary,\r\nQueen of Scots.  Sir William Russell, his successor, was the youngest\r\nson of the Earl of Bedford, but his two years of office brought him\r\nnothing but censure from the queen.  Russell's principal fault was that\r\nhe kept his word of honour to the rebel Earl of Tyrone.  The latter\r\ncame in person to Dublin Castle at the invitation of the viceroy, and\r\nmade submission.  Contented with this, the Lord-Lieutenant permitted\r\nhim to depart, but Elizabeth wished for the imprisonment of the rebel,\r\nand, consequently, Russell retired to make way for Lord Gainsborough.\r\nIn 1603 he was created a peer by James I.  A year sufficed for\r\nGainsborough, who died at his post.  Sir Thomas Norris, Lord Justice,\r\nacted until superseded by Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin, Sir Robert\r\nGardiner, and the Earl of Ormonde.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Queen Elizabeth's favourite]\r\n\r\nTheir services were dispensed with when Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex,\r\narrived in Dublin on April 15, 1599, his appointment dating from March\r\n12, 1598.  The Earl of Essex was one of the most romantic figures in\r\nthe later court of Queen Elizabeth.  When, as a boy of ten, Robert\r\nDevereux appeared at court, the queen was fascinated by his beauty and\r\nhis charming manners.  She sent for him later, and his early days were\r\ndistinguished by the confidence of the queen.  Elizabeth was an old\r\nwoman when Essex was in {77} the first flower of his manhood, but he\r\nwas as crafty as he was handsome, and he made every use of his power\r\nover the queen, a monarch aping youth with the aid of powder and paint.\r\nShe made Essex the most powerful of courtiers, and he attempted to\r\nreserve her favour for himself.  When the queen showed kindness to\r\nCharles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, Essex, ever passionate and prone to\r\nquarrel, sought out his rival and challenged him to a duel.  The result\r\nwas abortive, but it was only one of a series of incidents which showed\r\nElizabeth that she was raising Essex higher than his peculiar\r\ntemperament made promotion safe.  On one occasion he actually\r\nreproached the queen, who in a moment of rage forgot her pose of youth,\r\nand boxed the earl's ears.  But he was still in the royal favour when\r\nElizabeth sent him to Ireland with fifteen thousand men, his mission\r\nbeing to crush the rebellion of O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone.  From her\r\npalace in London the queen wrote almost daily to the viceroy, seldom\r\ncommending him, often hampering, and always petulant and capricious.\r\nEssex tried one or two encounters with the enemy, and found the\r\nbattlefields of Ireland profitless and dangerous to the health of one\r\nwhose chivalry was better suited to the drawing-room.  He hastily\r\nconcluded a treaty of peace with Tyrone, appointed Lords Justices to\r\ncarry on the government, and repaired to England on September 24,\r\nhaving spent less than five months in Ireland.  Only one who was\r\ncertain of Elizabeth's favour could have dared to do such a thing, but\r\nEssex entered {78} London in the temper of a spoilt child, prepared to\r\nrail at the queen for having dared to criticize him, and no doubt\r\nexpecting to receive her apologies.  The queen upset his calculations\r\nby having him arrested promptly, and although the public offered up\r\nprayers for his restoration to the good graces of the queen, these\r\nprayers were unanswered, because Essex was not the man to believe in\r\nhis sovereign's determination.  The arrest he regarded as a joke--in\r\nbad taste, perhaps, but still a joke--and when its seriousness dawned\r\nupon him he tried to retaliate in kind.  In 1601 he was executed.  The\r\ncharges against him were, first, with making a dishonourable treaty\r\nwith the rebels, and, second, leaving his Government without the\r\npermission of the authorities--that is, the queen and Council.  When\r\nreleased from the Tower and ordered to remain at York House, Essex\r\nattempted a rebellion, and the spoilt darling of fortune paid the\r\npenalty with his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Mountjoy]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Mountjoy]\r\n\r\nThe next viceroy, Sir Charles Blount, afterwards Lord Mountjoy, was a\r\ntypical product of the Elizabethan court.  He had been Essex's friend\r\nand afterwards his enemy, and when the earl retired prematurely from\r\nIreland, Elizabeth sent Mountjoy to reopen the war against O'Neill and\r\nto crush him, irrespective of the treaty of security and peace signed\r\nby Essex in Elizabeth's name.  He carried out his duties faithfully,\r\nand succeeded in driving the Tyrones out of their territory.  On the\r\nfinal defeat of O'Neill, that chieftain made submission, and Mountjoy\r\nwas graciously pleased to forgive the rebel and restore his title and\r\n{79} estates to him.  While in Ireland Mountjoy received a letter from\r\nEssex, then a prisoner on parole at York House, asking him to bring his\r\narmy from Ireland, join a promised army of the King of Scotland, and\r\ndrive Elizabeth's advisers from power.  Mountjoy at once declined to\r\nhazard his own neck, and he left Essex to his fate.  The hope that the\r\nearl placed on the viceroy was inspired by the latter's affection for\r\nPenelope, sister of Lord Essex.  This lady was so notorious that even\r\nQueen Elizabeth had to refuse to receive her, but her faults were the\r\nfaults of the age she lived in.  At a very early age, and without\r\nhaving her wishes consulted at all, Penelope was married to an old roue\r\nnamed Lord Rich, a man of filthy habits and loathsome ways.  Penelope\r\nbore him seven children, but the gross brutalities of her husband drove\r\nher into the arms of Sidney, and when she became Mountjoy's mistress,\r\nshe had five children by him.  The viceroy, however, was a faithful\r\nlover, and when Lord Rich divorced her after Mountjoy's resignation of\r\nhis post, the viceroyalty, he married her, inducing his private\r\nchaplain, Laud, to perform the ceremony.  The act of Laud's very nearly\r\nruined his career, and, at any rate, it stood in the way of his\r\npromotion for several years.  It is said that Mountjoy did intend to\r\ncome to the rescue of his mistress's brother, and certainly Elizabeth,\r\nwho wanted Mountjoy's services, suppressed a confession by a prisoner\r\nwhich, had it become public, must have cost Lord Mountjoy his head.  As\r\nit was, he held the viceroyalty until 1603, and could have {80}\r\nremained longer, for King James confirmed his appointment.  Mountjoy,\r\nhowever, wanted his Penelope, and he left Ireland for her sake.  James\r\nrewarded him with the Earldom of Devonshire, but as all his children\r\nwere illegitimate, the titles died with him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Order of the Baronetage]\r\n\r\nThe late viceroy's deputy, Sir George Cary, enjoyed only a few months\r\nin office, for Sir Arthur Chichester, afterwards Lord Chichester of\r\nBelfast, was given the post, and came to Ireland early in 1605.\r\nChichester was forty-one, but he had already nearly thirty years'\r\nexperience of public affairs, including the fight against the Armada.\r\nIn his early youth he had assaulted an inoffensive citizen, and had\r\nfled from London to Ireland, but Elizabeth pardoned him and found him\r\nemployment.  Fortunately for Chichester, Lord Mountjoy took him into\r\nfavour, and when the latter returned to England, and was appointed\r\nadviser to James on Irish affairs, he nominated Chichester as the most\r\nsuitable person to govern Ireland.  This viceroy made it a condition\r\nthat religious persecution in Ireland should be abolished.  Every\r\nprecedent was against the continuance of a protracted and futile\r\nattempt to force an objectionable religion upon the majority of the\r\npeople, and when he secured this concession to common sense from James\r\nand Mountjoy, Chichester must have realized that he was in a fair way\r\nto make his term of office a success.  Some luck attended him.  He was\r\ngiven a good army, and very early in his career in Ireland two of his\r\nmost dangerous opponents, Tyrone and Tyrconnell, left Ireland {81} for\r\never.  Chichester then proceeded to colonize Ulster.  The order of the\r\nBaronetage was created in 1611, and the title sold for L1,080, the\r\nproceeds being intended to pay the expenses of the colonization of\r\nUlster.  The large estates of the Tyrone and Tyrconnell families were\r\ndistributed amongst the native Irish, the English and some planters\r\nfrom Scotland, Chichester himself being rewarded with a peerage.  It\r\nwas a wise move on his part, moreover, to give first choice to the\r\nnative Irish in the matter of the division of the land, for he knew\r\nthat peace could only be purchased at a price.\r\n\r\nOn these lines he governed Ireland for twelve years, and when he\r\nretired in 1614, he had the satisfaction of earning the praise of those\r\nhe ruled and those he served.  His wife, a daughter of Sir John\r\nPerrott, does not appear to have taken a very prominent part in Irish\r\nlife.  She was an invalid and contemptuous of the Irish, though the\r\nrecords of some of their entertainments in Dublin Castle prove that she\r\nwas lavish in her hospitality, and even invited the heads of the great\r\nIrish families.\r\n\r\nSir Oliver St. John was in 1616 appointed Viceroy of Ireland.  During\r\nthe interval the Government had been in the hands of Adam Loftus, the\r\nindispensable Archbishop of Dublin, whose power was as great as his\r\ncupidity and avarice.  St. John was a typical soldier of fortune, who\r\nhad found fame and fortune on the battlefields of the Continent.  In\r\n1580, when twenty-one, he was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn, out a\r\nlegal career ended suddenly as the result of a duel with Best, the\r\nnavigator.  Best died, and {82} St. John fled the country, but after\r\nmany profitless years he had the luck to come under the notice of the\r\nEarl of Essex at Rouen.  Essex, who was in need of brave soldiers,\r\nenlisted St. John, and took him to Ireland to fight against Tyrone.  In\r\na few years St. John was elected member for Roscommon in the Irish\r\nParliament, and followed that up by entering the English House of\r\nCommons as member for Portsmouth.  Mountjoy knighted him and made him\r\npresident of Connaught, so that when in 1616 he was made viceroy, he\r\nbrought to the office a great experience of Irish affairs.\r\n\r\nHis first official act was to banish all those ecclesiastics educated\r\nabroad, his second, to make the Protestant religion compulsory, and his\r\nthird, even more remarkable, took the form of a proposal to emigrate\r\n100,000 Irish persons.  This was a short method of dealing with a\r\npressing problem, but it was hopelessly impracticable, and St. John,\r\nless successful as a statesman than as soldier, was commanded to\r\ndeliver the sword of state to Adam Loftus, and return to England.\r\n\r\nHenry Gary, Viscount Falkland, who succeeded, tried to carry on the St.\r\nJohn policy.  Proclamations were issued extensively, and all the Irish\r\nwere ordered to go to heaven by the Protestant road.  Strangely enough,\r\nwhile Lord Falkland was doing his best to establish the Protestant\r\nreligion, Lady Falkland was secretly a Catholic, and supplying the\r\npriests with money.  For over twenty years she kept her secret from her\r\nhusband, but he discovered it eventually, and promptly separated from\r\nher.  The Privy Council, called {83} upon to judge between husband and\r\nwife, declared Falkland's act justified, but ordered him to pay her\r\nL500 a year.  Falkland retired in 1629 with the character of an\r\nunreliable, timid man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earl of Strafford]\r\n\r\nAnother period of government by Council and Lords Justices covered the\r\nyears from 1628 to 1633, and then Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford,\r\none of the great figures of the early days of the Civil War, was chosen\r\nby Charles I. to represent him in Ireland.  Wentworth's appointment was\r\ndated 1632, but that nobleman did not hurry to take over his post, and\r\nbesides, there were many urgent affairs to keep him at home.  Wentworth\r\nwas leader of the House of Commons, and at the first encounter with the\r\nking stood by the Commons.  Charles, however, determined to secure his\r\npersonal adherence, and by means of titles, the bait of kings,\r\nWentworth foreswore his radical opinions, came over on to the king's\r\nside, and was ever afterwards a most zealous and devoted servant of the\r\nCrown.  When Charles conferred with his advisers upon the coming\r\nstruggle with the people, Wentworth made the first practical suggestion\r\nby subscribing L20,000 towards the royal treasury.  Wentworth was,\r\ntherefore, the most trusted of the King's advisers, and he was sent to\r\nIreland with the object of raising money for His Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe new viceroy hastily summoned a Parliament at Dublin, and persuaded\r\nit to vote L180,000 for the king's use against the army of the\r\nCovenanters.  Further, Wentworth raised an army with the object of\r\ninvading England and joining {84} Charles's forces.  The intention was\r\nnever carried out; but when Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, stood\r\nhis trial at Westminster Hall, on April 5, 1641, the principal charge\r\nagainst him was that he had raised an army of Irish Papists to make war\r\nupon His Majesty's subjects.  Strafford was executed on May 12.\r\n\r\nHis history concerns England rather than Ireland, but he had\r\nconsiderable influence upon the latter country, and did something\r\ntowards placing Irish industries upon a better footing.  In an age of\r\nwars and rebellions the reformer was out of place, but Ireland owes\r\nsomething to the Earl of Strafford's memory.  When he died, Ireland\r\nmourned for him, and Sir Charles Wandesford, who had acted as one of\r\nhis deputies, died of a broken heart upon hearing the news.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earl of Strafford]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The civil war]\r\n\r\nThe fatal year of 1641 found Ireland without a viceroy.  The Lords\r\nJustices ruled in Dublin, but they carried no authority.  Throughout\r\nthe country it was said that England had abandoned her compatriots.\r\nThe Great Rebellion followed as a matter of course.  Centuries of\r\noppression, outrage, robbery, and every other form of tyranny produced\r\ntheir natural offspring.  The native Irish, who had not accepted the\r\ndictum that time legalizes robbery and sanctifies wrong, rose in their\r\npassions and slaughtered the 'planted' settlers.  The less said about\r\nthe rebellion the better.  The history of the world shows that when the\r\ndemocracy rises to avenge its wrongs, the innocent pay the debts of the\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nRobert Sidney, Earl of Leicester, should have {85} succeeded Strafford,\r\nbut he lingered in England, conscious that his own country would be the\r\ncentre of great events.  He asked his son, Lord Lisle, to take his\r\nplace, but that young man had no taste for the rigours of Ireland.  His\r\nprognostications were justified, and with the outbreak of the Civil War\r\nLord Leicester abandoned all intention of taking up the office of\r\nviceroy.  Charles wanted every available soldier, and Ireland was left\r\nto look after itself.  There was a nominal Government in Dublin, and\r\nthe Earl of Ormonde, at the beginning of his splendid career, was\r\nCommander-in-Chief.  Ormonde was a devoted royalist, and in the king's\r\nhour of need sent him 5,000 soldiers from Ireland, paying their\r\nexpenses himself.  In the midst of his worries Charles found time to\r\nshow his gratitude by making Ormonde a marquis, and appointing him\r\nViceroy of Ireland.  This was in 1644, but strong man as he was,\r\nOrmonde's tenure of office was shorn of all its glory and strength.  He\r\nwas destined later to play a leading--the leading--part in Irish\r\naffairs; but during the Civil War there was no effective government in\r\nIreland, and the country went back to its ruling chiefs, and Dublin and\r\na few provincial towns sheltered the remnants of the party that looked\r\nto England for protection and guidance.  Lord Ormonde's determination\r\nwas to hold Ireland for the king, and with this object he strengthened\r\nthe garrison towns.  The massacres of the settlers in the North he had\r\npunished, but until the settlement of the conflict in England he was in\r\na dangerous and anomalous position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{86}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nJames Butler, first Duke of Ormonde, was born at Clerkenwell on October\r\n19, 1610.  For political reasons he was brought up in London under the\r\nimmediate influence of the court.  The boy, who was known as Viscount\r\nThurles, was as popular as he was handsome, and in his early manhood he\r\nwas one of the most famous 'bucks' about town.  The story of his\r\nmarriage is a romantic one, and much has been written about it.  The\r\nfacts are that the young Lord Thurles saw Elizabeth Preston, only\r\ndaughter and heiress of the Earl of Desmond, in church.  She was very\r\nbeautiful and wealthy, and Thurles resolved to wed her.  Whether it was\r\na case of love at first sight or not depends upon the sentiment of the\r\nreader.  We know that the lady's fortune did much towards restoring\r\nthat of the house of Ormonde.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Butler, first Duke of Ormonde]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Ormonde's marriage]\r\n\r\nElizabeth Preston, however, was already reserved for someone else, and\r\nunder the watchful and jealous guardianship of Lord Holland she was\r\nhidden from Lord Thurles.  Realizing that his attentions would not be\r\ndispleasing, Lord Thurles disguised himself as a pedlar, and carried\r\nhis pack to the back-door of Lord Holland's Kensington {87} residence.\r\nHappily for the course of true love, the ladies of the house were not\r\nabove opening the door to pedlars, and Lord Holland's daughters\r\nperformed that service for the lover.  They made a few purchases, and\r\nthen hastened to Elizabeth, to tell her that the handsomest pedlar in\r\nEngland was at the back-door, and to beg her to come and patronize him.\r\nThe girl recognized Thurles, and when he pressed a pair of gloves upon\r\nher, she asked him to wait while she went for some money, although her\r\ncompanions offered to save her the trouble by lending her the necessary\r\namount.  This she declined, guessing that one of the gloves contained a\r\nlove-letter.  In the safety of her own room she read Thurles'\r\nimpassioned address, and then, having penned a suitable and favourable\r\nreply, came down again and returned the gloves, declaring that they\r\nsmelt abominably, and could not be worn by a lady.  Never did a pedlar\r\naccept the cancellation of a bargain so gleefully as this one did.  The\r\nmessage the gloves contained settled his doubts and fears, and later\r\nViscount Thurles and Elizabeth Preston were wedded.  Lord Holland's\r\nconsent was purchased for L15,000, and when he succeeded to the Earldom\r\nof Ormonde, Butler took his bride to Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the Earl of Ormonde to the country of his ancestors was\r\nhailed as a welcome sign by the leading Irish families.  By his\r\nmarriage Ormonde had united two of the greatest and ended a bitter\r\nfeud, and the native party looked to him to lead them against the\r\nEnglish.  His only disadvantage was his religion.  He was a Protestant,\r\n{88} the result of his education in England, but the question of\r\nreligion was ignored by the Irish, and the handsome and chivalrous earl\r\nwas called upon to take his stand in the forefront of the Irish army.\r\nLord Strafford was viceroy at the time, and upon him lay the\r\nresponsibility of influencing Ormonde's choice.  The viceroy acted\r\nwisely.  Personally he disliked the young earl, but he realized that to\r\nmake an enemy of the most powerful nobleman amongst the Irish families\r\nof distinction would be fatal to his own chances of success as Viceroy\r\nof Ireland, and so he immediately made overtures of friendship to the\r\nman whom he had known as a boy in London.  Lord Ormonde responded, and\r\nthe two noblemen became fast friends, a friendship not forgotten to the\r\nlast by Wentworth.  When the latter had been sentenced to death for\r\ntreason against the State, he implored Charles to give Ormonde the\r\ngarter left vacant by his death, and also warned that monarch that the\r\nonly loyal servant he had in Ireland was the Earl of Ormonde, advising\r\nthe king to appoint him Lord-Deputy.  The king, whose principal\r\nweakness was a tardiness of judgment, granted neither request at the\r\ntime.  But in 1644 he made Ormonde viceroy, and later bestowed the\r\ngarter, though at a time when that emblem of royal favour was little\r\nbetter than a brilliant mockery.\r\n\r\nOrmonde served an apprenticeship as Commander-in-Chief of the troops\r\nduring Wentworth's viceroyalty, and on his own appointment to the\r\nlatter position he combined the two offices.  His duties as viceroy\r\nwere, however, merely nominal, {89} and believing that he could be of\r\nmore service to the royal cause in England, he resigned his\r\npost--inspired, no doubt, by the fact that Parliament had appointed\r\nPhilip Sidney, Lord Lisle, Lord-Lieutenant, under its jurisdiction--in\r\n1647.  Ormonde went at once to Charles at Hampton Court, and acquainted\r\nhim with the news that it was the intention of the Parliamentary\r\nleaders to seize his person and bring him to trial.  Charles, of\r\ncourse, declined to believe the existence of the Parliamentary plot,\r\nand the ex-viceroy, again appointed Lord-Lieutenant, but armed with a\r\nworthless commission, returned to Ireland.  Lord Lisle was not in\r\nresidence, and the Government that represented the Commons consisted of\r\nfive commissioners--Arthur Annesley, Sir R. King, Sir R. Meredith,\r\nColonel John Moor, and Colonel Michael Jones--a quintette scarcely\r\nlikely to impress Ormonde with a sense of their dignity, or inspire in\r\nthe country a feeling of security.\r\n\r\nDublin, however, was in the hands of the Parliamentarians, and Ormonde\r\nchose to assert what authority he possessed from the provinces.  Had\r\nCharles's cause been the strongest in the world, it could not have\r\nsurvived the adverse verdict of the series of great and decisive\r\nbattles that temporarily ended the monarchy.  Ormonde was not dismayed,\r\nhowever, and even the execution of the king found him dauntless and\r\nfearless.  He proclaimed the son of the murdered monarch king, and\r\nwrote entreating him to come to Ireland, assuring the prince that his\r\ntroops could hold that {90} country for him.  Meanwhile Ormonde\r\nattacked Dublin, captured Drogheda, suffered defeat at Rathmines, where\r\nColonel Jones, the Parliamentary leader, with that strange inspiration\r\nfor successful fighting and generalship which inspired the leaders of\r\nthe democracy, outpointed him, and drove him and his army from the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oliver Cromwell]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Cromwellian campaign]\r\n\r\nWhatever hopes Ormonde may have entertained of recovering his position,\r\nthey were soon extinguished by the arrival of Oliver Cromwell.  It was\r\nan unexpected move on the part of Parliament, but now that Charles was\r\ndead, and the royal family in exile, it was considered safe to send the\r\nstrongest man of his generation to cope with the Irish rebellion.  In\r\n1642 Cromwell had subscribed L600 towards the cost of an expedition for\r\navenging the massacres of the previous year, and this act showed that\r\nhe took a practical interest in Irish affairs, and realized the\r\ncountry's importance to England.  Ormonde was a resourceful, determined\r\nleader, and a man of unquestioned courage, but Cromwell was his\r\nsuperior in the field and in the council-room, and he had the advantage\r\nalso of a united army.  Twelve thousand picked soldiers, their courage\r\nexalted by a fanaticism that combined psalm-singing with murder, took\r\nthe field under Cromwell against Lord Ormonde, who had to depend for\r\nthe greater part upon ill-trained troops officered by men who were not\r\nthe less incompetent because the Protestants among them refused to be\r\nled by Catholics, and Catholics declined to recognize the authority of\r\nProtestants.  Ormonde {91} strove frantically to unite his forces, but\r\nwithout success, and Drogheda, Wexford, Ross, and other towns were left\r\nto the cruel mercies of Cromwell.\r\n\r\nThe English leader came to Ireland as Commander-in-Chief and\r\nLord-Lieutenant at a combined salary of L13,000 a year.  His first act,\r\ncharacteristic of the man, was to issue a proclamation against\r\nswearing, and he discouraged plunder and looting by hanging even those\r\nof his own soldiers who transgressed his rules.  Inspired by a sense of\r\nhis own rectitude, Cromwell marched on Drogheda.  The massacre has\r\nstained his memory almost as much as it stained the streets of the\r\ntown, and after it Wexford's tragedy seems light in comparison.\r\n\r\nOrmonde, suspected by the native leaders, was in no enviable position.\r\nWaterford, besieged by Cromwell, declined to allow his army to enter\r\nbecause its leader was 'English.'  There was thus no work for him to\r\ndo, but he remained on, contemptuously rejecting Cromwell's offer of a\r\npassport to the Continent.\r\n\r\nIn the great Cromwellian campaign the ex-viceroy took no part.  The\r\nEnglish leader, encouraged by a series of victories, was suddenly\r\ndisconcerted by the successful resistance of the citizens of Waterford,\r\nand his failure to take Clonmel ended his enthusiasm for the task of\r\nconquering Ireland.  In a pessimistic letter to the House of Commons he\r\nwarned the Speaker not to imagine that by his victories at Drogheda and\r\nWexford he had subdued Ireland.  He knew too {92} well that in reality\r\nhe had not conquered a square foot of the land.\r\n\r\nThe outwitting of Cromwell by Hugh O'Neill, the gallant defender of\r\nClonmel, is one of the lighter episodes of an era of tragedy.  The\r\nEnglish leader had restarted his campaign following a rest after the\r\nsetback at Waterford.  He besieged Kilkenny, and was compelled to stoop\r\nto an honourable treaty to secure the town, and then he marched on\r\nClonmel, where O'Neill, the Irish idol who had supplanted Ormonde as\r\nthe national hero, was performing wonders at the head of a small and\r\nbadly-armed garrison.  And this garrison withstood the flower of\r\nCromwell's soldiery, fighting for their country without any hope of\r\ngain, and repeatedly defeating the invaders.  Cromwell, sick at heart,\r\nwas considering the advisability of abandoning the siege which had\r\nbrought him so many rebuffs, when he was agreeably surprised to hear\r\nthat the Mayor of Clonmel, Mathew White, wished to see him.  The\r\nmayor's object was to surrender the town on certain terms, and Cromwell\r\nwas, of course, only too glad to save his face by granting any\r\nconcessions so long as they brought him the town of Clonmel.  A treaty\r\nwas hastily drawn up, guarding against the atrocities that had\r\ndistinguished Drogheda and Wexford, and then the English General\r\ninquired if Hugh O'Neill was aware of the mayor's action.  Mathew White\r\nreplied with well-assumed diffidence that O'Neill and his army had left\r\nthe town some hours before!  Cromwell stormed and raged, and demanded\r\nhis treaty back, but White {93} played upon the Puritan's vanity of\r\nreputation, and Cromwell kept his word.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Henry Ireton]\r\n\r\nDespite his reverses, Cromwell had hopes of firmly establishing English\r\nauthority by means of the Protestant religion in Ireland.  He drew up a\r\nseries of recommendations on the subject, but by now there was more\r\nimportant work for him to do.  England required his services, and on\r\nMay 29, 1650, his son-in-law, Henry Ireton, was appointed Lord-Deputy\r\nand Commander-in-Chief, and instructed to carry out the Cromwellian\r\npolicy.  Ireton did not spare himself or others.  He besieged Limerick,\r\nand in four months starved the garrison out, but it was his last\r\neffort, and on November 26, 1651, he died of the prevailing plague.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the Commonwealth deputies were undistinguished so far as\r\ntheir Irish careers were concerned.  Major-General Lambert was chosen\r\nto succeed Ireton, but he was more suited for the camp than the council\r\nboard, being a bluff soldier with a partiality for the rough pleasures\r\nof the average campaign.  Cromwell did not care for 'Honest John'\r\nLambert, and having in mind a scheme whereby Lieutenant-General Sir\r\nCharles Fleetwood, who had wisely married Ireton's widow and the\r\nProtector's daughter, should be made Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, he\r\ninduced Parliament to abolish the post.  Lambert was enraged, for the\r\nprospect of ruling a country had excited his imagination, and he made\r\ngreat preparations to inaugurate his term of office.  The Protector\r\ngave him two thousand pounds as compensation, and offered him the post\r\nof {94} Commander-in-Chief, which he declined angrily.  Fleetwood was\r\nthereupon given the post, and after a couple of years of government by\r\ncommissioners, he was created Lord-Deputy.\r\n\r\nFleetwood distinguished himself by priest-baiting and an attempt to\r\nrevive the 'plantation' methods of Sidney and Perrott.  Henry Cromwell,\r\nfourth son of Oliver, who had been given command of an army in Ireland,\r\nin order to amuse himself and learn the arts of war, replaced\r\nFleetwood.  This Cromwell was unambitious, something of a poltroon, and\r\nonly kept in the forefront by the personality of his father.  Nepotism\r\nnourishes even in democracies, and Henry, a Colonel at twenty-two and\r\nLord-Deputy before he was thirty, was not the man to carry on the\r\ntraditions of the Protector.  The Restoration found Henry Cromwell\r\npitiably anxious to submit to the new order of things, and when the new\r\nreign opened and Lord Ormonde returned to resume his duties at Dublin\r\nCastle, Cromwell was grateful for being allowed to retire into private\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Restoration]\r\n\r\nDuring the years of the Commonwealth Lord Ormonde had resided abroad,\r\nstanchly faithful to the discredited cause of the Stuarts.  When others\r\ngrew faint-hearted, and deserted, Ormonde spoke the encouraging word,\r\nand he spent all his revenues in the royal service.  Recalling a\r\npromise made by Cromwell that his wife's fortune would not be\r\nconfiscated, he sent her to the Protector, and she succeeded in getting\r\nfive hundred pounds in cash and two thousand a year for life.  In 1658,\r\nsix years after his wife's visit, Ormonde entered {95} England\r\ndisguised, charged with a mission from the Royalist party to ascertain\r\nif the times were rife for a rising.  The ex-viceroy returned with a\r\npessimistic report, and on his advice Charles waited.  Two years later\r\ncame the Restoration, and with it Ormonde's fortunes rose to a dazzling\r\nheight.\r\n\r\nIn the first flush of gratitude King Charles showered honours upon the\r\nIrish nobleman.  He was created Duke of Ormonde in the Irish peerage,\r\nEarl of Brecknock in the English, appointed Chancellor of Dublin\r\nUniversity, Lord Steward, Lord-Lieutenant of Somerset, and High Steward\r\nof Kingston, Westminster, and Bristol.  At the coronation of Charles\r\nII. he carried the crown.  The restoration of his Irish estates\r\nfollowed as a matter of course, and the king added a promise to pay him\r\na large sum of money.  This promise was never kept, but the Irish\r\nParliament, anxious to curry favour with Ormonde and the king, voted\r\nhim thirty thousand pounds.  At the close of his career Ormonde\r\ndeclared that he had spent nearly a million of money in the king's\r\nservice, and although this is an obvious exaggeration, yet it is a fact\r\nthat he lost heavily pecuniarily and otherwise by his adherence to the\r\nStuart cause.\r\n\r\nUltra-patriotic writers, with that passion for obscure data which\r\ncharacterizes the partisan historian in his search of an argument, have\r\nchosen to regard the first Duke of Ormonde as the friend of England and\r\nthe enemy of Ireland.  They shed inky tears over the fate of men like\r\nHugh O'Neill and Shane of that family, but the {96} success of either\r\nof these would have meant a return to the absurd state of affairs which\r\nmade Ireland a nation of kingdoms and traitors.  O'Neill represented\r\nonly his own followers, and his success would have bred rivals and\r\nimitators.  There was no hope of peace or prosperity if the country\r\ncame under the dominion of men brave on the battlefield and foolish and\r\nquarrelsome in their councils.  Mere bravery is not statesmanship;\r\nvictories on the battlefield have to be supported by wisdom in the\r\ncouncil, or all their benefits are lost.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ormonde and Lady Castlemaine]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Ormonde was the first of the great race of Irishmen,\r\nworthily descended from famous persons in the two countries, who aimed\r\nat a united Ireland in honourable federation with England.  To a man of\r\nhis breeding and education the civilization of Pall Mall was more\r\npleasing than the semi-barbarous condition of provincial Ireland, but\r\nhe accepted again the thankless position of viceroy, and, hampered by\r\nthe new school of politics that had arisen in London, he did his utmost\r\nfor Ireland.  He was the best man for the task, and Charles knew it,\r\nand although his enemies never lost an opportunity for damaging his\r\nreputation, he retained the post until March 14, 1669, having conducted\r\nthe government in person for nearly seven years.  Ormonde was one of\r\nthe first to realize the fact that Charles was endangering his throne\r\nby his profligacy.  Almost every decree that emanated from Whitehall\r\nwas inspired by the whims and vagaries of one of the mistresses of the\r\n'Merry Monarch,' and even Ormonde, {97} attached as he was to the\r\nperson of the king, could not submit to the insolent demand on the part\r\nof Lady Castlemaine that her lover should grant her Phoenix Park as a\r\nprivate demesne.  Lady Castlemaine, however, ascribed her defeat to\r\nOrmonde's jealousy, and it was mainly through her that the viceroy's\r\nenemies continued their plottings and secured his recall.  The charges\r\nagainst him were that he had billeted soldiers on civilians and had\r\nexecuted martial law, charges so ridiculous that there was never any\r\nserious attempt to investigate them after Ormonde's return to London.\r\n\r\nHe was not without honour, however, even in England, for Oxford\r\nUniversity elected him her Chancellor, and in 1670 the city of Dublin\r\npresented an address to Lord Ossory, the duke's son, which consisted of\r\ncomplimentary references to the late viceroy and ignored the then\r\nholder of the post, Lord Robarts.  Lord Ossory had acted as deputy for\r\nhis father in 1664-65, and gave promise of a brilliant career.\r\n\r\nEight years of court life followed, during which Ormonde, who knew more\r\nabout Ireland than any other living person, was seldom called in to\r\nadvise Charles.  Robarts, a stolid nobleman of no accomplishments\r\nbeyond a little pride, managed to last a year--1669-70.  On the\r\nRestoration, Robarts, the son of a tin merchant and a usurer, was\r\nappointed deputy to General Monck, whom he considered an upstart, but\r\nhe declined to represent such a man, and Charles, who was heavily in\r\nhis debt, made him Lord Privy Seal, and thus enabled {98} him to avoid\r\nthe indignity of occupying an inferior position to General Monck.\r\n\r\nThe next viceroy was a distinguished survivor of the Civil War in the\r\nperson of John Berkeley, first Lord Berkeley of Stratton.  He was a\r\nnobleman of elaborate tastes, who took full advantage of Charles II.'s\r\nindebtedness to him for services rendered during the great exile.  This\r\nhe supplemented by marrying three times, the third wife bringing him an\r\nimmense fortune.  She was plain and old, but Berkeley overcame his\r\nnatural repugnance to the ugly in this particular case.  In Ireland he\r\nwas a success mainly because his sympathies inclined towards the\r\nCatholic religion, and he left well alone.  The country would have\r\nwelcomed a longer viceroyalty than two years, but Berkeley was not the\r\nman to waste his energies in Dublin, and he was glad to return to\r\nLondon and to the court.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duchess of Cleveland]\r\n\r\nIreland did not, of course, escape altogether from the evil\r\nconsequences of Charles's partiality for frail femininity.  His\r\nillegitimate children had to be provided with money as well as with\r\ntitles, and their mothers' anxiety for the future dispelled.  When\r\nthere were murmurings in England against the king's extravagant methods\r\nin satisfying the cupidity of his creatures, these latter asked for\r\nsomething out of Ireland.  The Duchess of Portsmouth wanted Phoenix\r\nPark, and Charles was quite willing that she should have it, but the\r\nDuke of Ormonde and the Earl of Essex, who knew the fatal stupidity of\r\nthe Stuarts, managed to convince Charles that he would run the risk of\r\nlosing {99} his crown if he lost his head over the woman who made the\r\ntitle of duchess as cheap as water while she flaunted it in Whitehall.\r\nIt was not to be expected that an illiterate woman would be able to\r\nunderstand the reasons that made the gift of Phoenix Park\r\nimpracticable, and she plotted with all the feline spite that she was\r\ncapable of to injure the men who had defeated her ambitions.  Ormonde,\r\nhowever, was too strong, but when Arthur Capel, Earl of Essex, was\r\nappointed to succeed Lord Berkeley in 1672, she carried on an intrigue\r\nagainst him, and did not cease until his recall in 1677.  Lord Essex\r\nwas the son of the Lord Capel who had been executed in 1649, and\r\nCharles owed him and his family something.  That debt was never repaid\r\nfully, and had it not been for a sudden revulsion of feeling in\r\nOrmonde's favour Lord Essex might never have gone to Ireland.  The new\r\nviceroy was not popular among the king's coterie of duchesses and\r\ncountesses.  When at the Treasury he had declined to pay the Duchess of\r\nCleveland L25,000 out of the public funds, and, of course, the duchess\r\nwas furious.  Essex was not dismayed.  He knew that Charles dare not\r\nquarrel with a man of his position on the question of the subsidies he\r\nconsidered his mistresses ought to have.  Publicity was the last thing\r\nhe desired.  Essex was not the man to send to Ireland to represent the\r\nDuchess of Cleveland or the Duchess of Portsmouth, and Ormonde\r\npersuaded Charles that in Ireland he was regarded as king, and that the\r\npeople in that benighted country were so unacquainted with the manners\r\n{100} of polite society as to be quite unable to appreciate the\r\ndelicate position of duchess without a duke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earl of Essex]\r\n\r\nLord Essex found Ireland as peaceful as he could expect.  Fortunately\r\nfor him, he lacked the ambition that had attacked so many former\r\nviceroys like a disease, and did not wish to conquer Ireland.  He\r\nrealized that beyond Dublin and a few provincial cities the rule of\r\nEngland did not extend, but provided he was allowed to remain in peace\r\nat Dublin Castle, he did not worry.  And in fact Dublin was the only\r\nhabitable place.  Centuries of warfare had left the land in a terrible\r\nstate.  Education and all the arts were at a standstill, while the\r\ntraders had not yet raised themselves to a position of independence,\r\nand the resident nobility dwelt in their strongholds or emigrated to\r\nfight under foreign flags.  If we are to believe the records of the\r\ntimes, Lord Essex confined himself to Dublin and the Castle, and all\r\nhis entertainments were for the benefit of the officials and occasional\r\nvisitors from London.  He did something to make Dublin worthier of its\r\nposition as the capital city.  Highway and street robberies were\r\npunished severely and building improvements encouraged.\r\n\r\nLady Essex took her part in the work of her husband, being really the\r\nfirst of the 'vicereines'--to use an apt if technically incorrect\r\ndescription of the wives of the viceroys--to enter into the social life\r\nof the people her husband governed.  She entertained as a great\r\nhostess, and was charming and popular.  It was her accessibility which\r\nled to an incident which rendered the last few {101} months of Essex's\r\nviceroyalty painful.  The times were ripe for the propagation of\r\nscandal.  The king's patronage of vice gave it an appearance of virtue,\r\nand certainly many rewards.  The chivalry of the time was an elaborate\r\nritual in honour of free love, and, of course, the influence spread to\r\nDublin.  Personally Lord Essex was almost a little better than his\r\ncontemporaries, but he held the honour of his wife to be something very\r\nsacred, and when he heard that it was the talk of Dublin that she was\r\ncarrying on an intrigue with a Captain Brabazon he was greatly\r\nembittered.  It was fashionable to be vicious, but Essex would not\r\nbelieve that his wife was guilty, although Captain Brabazon swore that\r\nshe was.  According to the laws of honour, a duel with Brabazon was the\r\nviceroy's only court of appeal, but as the king's representative he\r\ncould not issue a challenge or accept one, and he was therefore\r\ncompelled to affect a haughty indifference to the covert insults heaped\r\nupon himself and Lady Essex.  Fortunately for the viceroy and his wife,\r\nCaptain Brabazon, rejoicing in his immunity, became too precise; he\r\noffered details of times and places, and once he had sworn to these it\r\nwas easy to prove them wicked and malicious falsehoods.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy was not sorry to yield up office to Ormonde, although, as\r\nis always the case, popular feeling turned in his favour, and even\r\ngossip admitted nothing but good of the countess.  The whole plot had\r\nbeen hatched by the Duchess of Cleveland in revenge for his refusal to\r\nrob the Treasury on her behalf.  On his return to London, {102} Lord\r\nEssex immediately sought out Charles and complained of the scandalous\r\ntreatment he had received.  The king was sympathetic--weak-minded\r\npersons find in sympathy their only virtue--but he would do nothing,\r\nand the ex-viceroy, disappointed and enraged, flung himself out of the\r\nroyal presence.  He was a marked man now, and all his sayings were\r\nimproved upon and reported to Charles.  The Rye House plot ended his\r\ncareer.  He was arrested and committed to the Tower, where he was said\r\nto have taken his own life in a fit of depression.  Whether true or not\r\nscarcely matters, for his act merely saved his head from the\r\nexecutioner's axe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{103}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Ormonde's career in London during his period of\r\nunemployment was not without excitement.  As a great nobleman he\r\nfrequented the court without ever becoming one of its favoured\r\nhabitues.  In his salad days Ormonde had been one of the gayest of the\r\ngay, but he was a veteran when Robarts succeeded him in Ireland, and\r\nhis temperament was that of a statesman rather than a courtier.\r\n\r\nHis enemies, however, feared and detested him, and finding that they\r\ncould not compel the complacent Charles to banish the duke, they took\r\nit into their own hands to try and murder him.  One night,\r\ntherefore--it was December 5, 1670--Ormonde's coach was stopped in St.\r\nJames's Street by Thomas Blood and five other ruffians, who dragged the\r\nduke out and carried him off on horseback.  The affair created a\r\ntremendous sensation, the most widely-spread rumour being that the five\r\naccomplices were well-known friends of the King's, inspired by him to\r\nassassinate a man who had helped Charles to regain his throne.  Blood\r\nbecame famous in one quarter and infamous in another, while Lord\r\nOssory, the duke's eldest son, believing that Buckingham had instigated\r\n{104} the plot, went in search of the duke, and, finding him with the\r\nking, did not hesitate to tell him that if his father died a violent\r\ndeath he would pistol Buckingham, even if he sought shelter behind the\r\nking.  Ormonde escaped mainly owing to the over-sureness of his\r\ncaptors.  The strangest incident, however, was yet to come.  Blood was\r\ncaptured--he made no attempt to escape--and it was expected as matter\r\nof course that he would be hanged, but Charles sent for the duke, and\r\nin a private interview persuaded that nobleman to pardon his would-be\r\nassassin.  This action of the king's proved conclusively that if\r\nBuckingham paid Blood to attempt Ormonde's life Charles must have had\r\ncognizance of the matter, while it is certain that the germ of the\r\nwhole idea originated with one of Charles's mistresses, who hated\r\nOrmonde, not because he was excessively moral or squeamish, but because\r\nhe declined to treat seriously their pretensions to be considered\r\nmembers of the nobility.\r\n\r\nNearly seven years after this episode Charles reappointed Ormonde\r\nViceroy of Ireland.  The duke was now sixty-seven, but he took up\r\noffice with all his old zest, and he made his entry into Dublin an\r\nelaborate ceremonial, behaving himself as though he were the King of\r\nIreland, and not merely a king's deputy.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Ormonde was not a patriot in the sense that the word is\r\nregarded nowadays.  His policy was to increase the English ascendancy.\r\nHis religion naturally placed him in the minority.  He was a Protestant\r\nand a Royalist, but there can {105} be no mistaking the earnestness of\r\nhis views.  He brought a conscientiousness to his task that\r\ndistinguished him from the average viceroy, and he could pride himself\r\nupon knowing the country.  The O'Neills, in their brief day of squabble\r\nand treachery, had taunted Ormonde with being English, and their\r\nfondness for creating parties within a party had helped to defeat\r\nOrmonde's policy more than once.  In 1677, however, the duke had behind\r\nhim the united power of England, and during his last viceroyalty he was\r\nall-powerful.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Proclamations against Catholics]\r\n\r\nThe Popish plot that disturbed the Government towards the close of\r\nCharles's reign roused the fervid anti-Catholic spirit in Ormonde.  He\r\nissued a proclamation banishing all ecclesiastics who took their orders\r\nfrom Rome; dissolving societies, convents, and schools, and commanding\r\nall Catholics to surrender their arms within twenty days.  These\r\nmeasures, however, did not satisfy the bigots in London, and they\r\nclamoured for the viceroy's recall, declaring that he was in secret\r\nsympathy with the plotters.  But the duke had a brave defender in the\r\nperson of his son, Lord Ossory, the handsomest and most hot-tempered\r\nman of his day.  Lord Ossory was his father's devoted friend, and\r\nduring his long stay in London the younger man never lost an\r\nopportunity for confounding his father's enemies.  In an impassioned\r\nspeech he defended him in the House of Lords, and he had the\r\nsatisfaction of defeating the intriguers.\r\n\r\nThe death of his son was a terrible blow to the {106} duke, and he lost\r\nall interest in public matters.  His supersession by the Earl of\r\nRochester in 1683 was not unwelcome to him.  Ormonde was seventy-three,\r\nand had aged considerably during the preceding ten years.  On July 21,\r\n1688, he died, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, a fit sepulchre for\r\na man whose loyalty and conscientiousness were rare virtues in his day,\r\nand who had given more to his king than he had received.  His last\r\npublic act had been to carry the crown at the Coronation of King James,\r\nbut he was spared the knowledge of the second and final exile of the\r\nStuart family from England.  His eldest son, Lord Ossory, the most\r\npopular man about town in his day, a confirmed gambler and an intimate\r\nof King Charles, who occasionally paid his card debts for him, left\r\nbehind a son who succeeded his grandfather in the title and estates,\r\nbecoming second Duke of Ormonde, and later Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.\r\nIn Evelyn's 'Diary' there is a notable tribute to Lord Ossory.\r\nUniversal grief was occasioned by the announcement of his death at an\r\nearly age.\r\n\r\nThe new viceroy was the Earl of Rochester, a dull creature who grew\r\nrestive in Dublin, where he ignored the local nobility, and was for\r\never pining for the pleasures of London.  The expenses of the\r\nviceroyalty were very considerable now, and there were few\r\nopportunities of making money out of the office.  Lord Tyrconnel, the\r\nCommander-in-Chief, treated him with open contempt, as he had treated\r\nthe Duke of Ormonde, a stronger man than either of them, and Rochester,\r\n{107} a product of society, was not likely to succeed against the\r\nbullying, swaggering methods of Tyrconnel, who was clearly aiming at\r\nthe viceroyalty for himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Catholic regime]\r\n\r\nIn 1683 Charles commissioned Laurence Hyde, brother of the Earl of\r\nClarendon, to replace Rochester, but Hyde, who was anxious to remain in\r\nLondon at that particular time, managed to delay his departure for over\r\na year, and when the king died and James ascended the throne, Henry\r\nHyde, Earl of Clarendon and brother-in-law of James, was selected for\r\nthe task of permeating Ireland, especially official Ireland, with the\r\nnew Jacobean policy.  England was avowedly Protestant, and England in\r\nIreland was similar.  James, who was that human paradox--an insincere\r\nfanatic--instructed Clarendon to proceed cautiously in his difficult\r\ntask of placing the Government and laws of Ireland in the hands of\r\nRoman Catholics, while at the same time maintaining outwardly a\r\nProtestant regime.  Hyde, who was James's subservient minister, did his\r\nbest, and within a year the majority of the judges, and nearly all the\r\nState officials, were Catholic.  He found it comparatively easy to\r\nappoint Catholic officers to the highest positions in the army, for\r\nTyrconnel, the Commander-in-Chief, was a Catholic, and he raised no\r\nobjection to Clarendon's nominations.  This was the only help the\r\nviceroy received from Tyrconnel, the most popular man in Ireland and\r\nthe most powerful.  He had the army behind him, and, knowing that he\r\ncould take the viceroyalty whenever he cared to do so, he had {108}\r\nsufficient sense of humour to wait until James had exhausted his stock\r\nof Pall Mall exquisites, and had to turn to him.  It was characteristic\r\nof the king that he should try to carry out a Catholic policy with the\r\naid of Protestant ministers, relying upon nepotism rather than upon\r\nconviction or sincerity, but the Stuarts were born to blunder, and they\r\nblundered.\r\n\r\nLord Tyrconnel pretended to obey the viceroy, but scarcely a single act\r\nfrom Dublin Castle was not ignored by him.  He was jealous of the\r\nking's preference for English noblemen, firmly believing that Ireland\r\nshould be governed by an Irishman and a Catholic.  The Duke of Ormonde\r\nhe had regarded as an Englishman, and that viceroy's terms of office\r\nwere always noted for quarrels with Tyrconnel.  The old Irish families\r\nand the common people looked to Tyrconnel to save them from the evil\r\nconsequences of the mad policy of Charles II. and his successor.  James\r\ncertainly gratified them by his return to the old religion, but he went\r\nabout it the wrong way, and with the usual result.  Clarendon did his\r\nbest, but Fate was against him.  He was too weak to stand the strain\r\nfidelity imposed in such troublous times, and James removed him from\r\noffice because he suspected his loyalty.  The suspicion was correct.\r\nClarendon was one of the first of James's intimates to go over to the\r\nparty that invited William and Mary to ascend the throne of England.\r\nLater he plotted against William, and only the influence of great\r\nfriends and a remembrance of previous services saved his life.  He was\r\nreleased {109} from prison, and permitted to live in semi-retirement\r\nuntil his death in 1709 at the age of seventy-one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earl of Tyrconnel]\r\n\r\nWhen Clarendon's term of office ended there was only one man who could\r\ncontinue James's policy.  This was Richard Talbot, Earl of Tyrconnel,\r\nthe man who had done his utmost to kill the authority of half a dozen\r\noccupants of Dublin Castle.  Fate retaliated by making his viceroyalty\r\nstormy and tragic.  At the time of his appointment in 1687 Tyrconnel\r\nwas fifty-seven years of age, and he had a long record behind him\r\nwhich, despite the tendency to idealize in the course of more than two\r\ncenturies, seems to prove that he was nothing better than a bully and\r\nan adventurer.  He was at the same time a brave soldier and a cowardly\r\nstatesman, but his greatest defect lay in his utter inability to\r\nacquire the art of obeying.  He wished to rule always, and when the\r\ncritical time came, this contributed more than anything else to the\r\ncomplete defeat of the Jacobean cause in Ireland.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1630, Tyrconnel was twenty years of age when Cromwell came to\r\nIreland and besieged Drogheda.  Even at that early age he was well\r\nknown for his reckless courage, and he was certainly one of the most\r\ngallant defenders of the town.  He owed his escape to the fact that he\r\nwas so dangerously wounded that he was placed amongst the dead, and he\r\ntook advantage of the lonely battlefield to make his way out of\r\nDrogheda disguised as a woman.  Coming to London, Tyrconnel was\r\narrested by Cromwell, but escaped to the Continent, {110} where he\r\nquickly determined to enter the inner circle of the royal exiles.\r\nCharles and his brother, the Duke of York, later James II., did not\r\ncare for the society of a person who lacked the finer polish, and who\r\nfound his acquaintances at the point of the sword.  Tyrconnel, however,\r\nwas crafty enough to sum up James's character, and by offering to go to\r\nEngland and assassinate Cromwell, he was at once taken into the\r\nconfidence of the duke.  Fortunately, it was soon realized that such a\r\nfoul deed would merely serve to strengthen the Commonwealth in England,\r\nand certainly extinguish all hopes of another Stuart regime.  It is not\r\nat all unlikely that Tyrconnel knew this; anyhow, he gained his\r\nambition, and by the time the Restoration was accomplished, he was one\r\nof the royal prince's most trusted companions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Tyrconnel, he cast in his lot with the Duke of York,\r\nand twenty-five years passed before his patron was in a position to\r\ngive him his earldom.  Talbot, who was a product of the battlefield,\r\nwas not likely to shine in the court of Charles II.  He played a part\r\nin it for a time, and he was the hero of several love affairs, but he\r\nhad not the courtly graces of a Buckingham or a Rochester.  Women were\r\nafraid of provoking him, for he brooked no rivalry, and the man who in\r\none week fought five duels in London and wounded his opponent every\r\ntime was no fit companion for ladies whose fame depended upon the\r\nnumber of conquests they made, but they admired his courage and\r\nsuccess.  In his only really serious love affair Tyrconnel was\r\nrejected, and the lady {111} married Sir George Hamilton.  Richard\r\nTalbot also found consolation, but some years later, when his wife had\r\ndied, he married Lady Hamilton, a widow with six children.\r\n\r\nCharles was speaking more than the truth when he declared that no one\r\nwould ever assassinate him to make James king, and Talbot, leading an\r\naimless life in London, a beggared gambler, distrusted by the old\r\naristocracy and feared by the new, sought vainly for adequate\r\nemployment for nearly ten years.  Then in 1669 Charles appointed him\r\nCommander-in-Chief in Ireland on the earnest and persistent\r\nsolicitation of the Duke of York.  London society was not displeased to\r\nget rid of the bully so easily, for in their estimation Ireland was\r\nstill a place of exile, especially so in view of the comfortable\r\nstatesmanship practised by Charles and his satellites in the palace of\r\nWhitehall.  Talbot went to Ireland eagerly, knowing that the qualities\r\nwhich had won for him contempt in London would idealize him in Ireland.\r\nWith the aid of the Duke of York, and also helped by the indolence of\r\nCharles, he knew that he could make his office of Commander-in-Chief at\r\nleast equal to, if not more powerful than, the viceroyalty.  Ormonde\r\nhad been superseded by Lord Robarts, and Talbot detested the duke,\r\nwhose religion made him unpopular with the Duke of York and his friends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 'Lying Dick Talbot']\r\n\r\nOn the accession of James II., Richard Talbot--Macaulay's 'Lying Dick\r\nTalbot'--was created Earl of Tyrconnel, and his powers as\r\nCommander-in-Chief increased.  It was the king's ambition {112} to make\r\nhimself independent of Parliament by means of the army, and he hoped\r\nthat Tyrconnel would bring the army in Ireland to such a state of\r\nefficiency that would render it an important asset in the struggle\r\nbetween the king and his subjects.  To a man of Talbot's temperament\r\nunlimited power was a spur to unlimited ambition, and successive\r\nviceroys found themselves in a humiliating position.  The noted\r\nduellist and bully--the man at whom half London sneered and whom the\r\nother half feared--was set in authority over some of the best blood in\r\nthe kingdom, and although they complained bitterly to the king, there\r\nwas no redress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The state of the country]\r\n\r\nThe nomination of Tyrconnel to the vice-royalty was, therefore, the\r\nonly way out of James's difficulties in Ireland.  Nearly every class in\r\nthe country welcomed the appointment.  The new viceroy proceeded to\r\nstrengthen his own position rather than that of the king's.  He had\r\nbeen instructed to pack the state and the bench with Catholics, but\r\nTyrconnel, with thoughts of the future, selected creatures of his own,\r\nand in a short time he was master of the country.  The bench, the\r\ncorporations, the Justices of the Peace, were all subservient to him.\r\nHe made and unmade laws, and the spectacle of a bully ruling a country\r\nmight have made the world laugh had it not been so tragic.  The\r\ndisarmed Protestants were left to the mercy of the criminal classes and\r\nthe legalized highway robbers; consequently many of the most prosperous\r\nand law-abiding families were compelled to leave their lands and homes\r\n{113} and emigrate to England.  Justice was a travesty; householders in\r\nDublin had to keep watch all night to guard their property because the\r\nfear of punishment for crime no longer existed.  The viceroy and his\r\nwife reigned in Dublin Castle, where sectarianism influenced every\r\nsingle act.\r\n\r\nLady Tyrconnel, who had been in her youth one of the most fascinating\r\nof the group of ingenuous beauties gathered about the court of Charles\r\nII., was in her middle age ugly, spiteful, and fanatical.  Her husband\r\nwas rough and coarse; she was feline and fanciful, but she adapted\r\nherself to the ways of his policy, and the Catholic religion found in\r\nher a devout adherent.  She was not popular in Ireland, however.  The\r\nmother of six children, she was fond of recalling the glories of her\r\nWhitehall past.  Secretly she disliked James, and even at times broke\r\nout into petulant diatribes against her husband's patron; but all the\r\ntime she aped the youth of her early years, and tried to hide the plain\r\npresent by means of paint.\r\n\r\nThere was no room for the finer arts of life in Tyrconnel.  He was now\r\nacting the statesman, and the result was very soon evident.  Ormonde,\r\ndespite his defects and dislike for the ultra-patriots, had succeeded\r\nin improving the condition of Ireland, and his successors had been\r\nwilling to continue his social policy if they could not improve upon\r\nit.  The Earl of Tyrconnel, however, was not the man to imitate others,\r\nno matter how praiseworthy such imitation might be, and in less than a\r\ncouple of years he 'reduced Ireland {114} from a place of briskest\r\ntrade and best-paid rents in Christendom to utter ruin and desolation.'\r\nDublin had progressed amazingly under Ormonde, and it seemed as if the\r\ncapital city would rise to a place amongst the most important cities of\r\nthe world, when Tyrconnel came to set it back a hundred years.  England\r\nhad never done anything for Dublin or any other town in Ireland, and\r\nthe progress of the capital had been made in the face of the bitterest\r\nopposition and the most relentless persecution.  London, Bristol, and\r\nthe other ports of England were jealous of Dublin, and they were able\r\nto get edicts passed interfering with the shipping and the trade of the\r\ncountry, in order that they might not lose in competition.  Dublin,\r\nhowever, rose superior to edicts and statutes, and by the end of the\r\nseventeenth century it was not a mean city.  Even in London it was\r\nrealized with something approaching wonder that Dublin was not to be\r\ndespised.  For five hundred years it had been the headquarters of the\r\nEnglish colony, but it was in Tyrconnel's day entirely Irish.  The\r\nEnglish families had been merged in the Irish, and the result was a\r\npopulation anxious for peace and freedom from the persecutions entailed\r\nby religious squabbles and political struggles.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Tyrconnel was too patriotic, however, to let the country\r\nrest.  His crude mind was full of ambitious schemes, and from England\r\nJames fed him with ambitious food.  Between them they were to make\r\nEngland, Ireland, and Scotland wholly Catholic, and in the remote event\r\nof England failing the king, Ireland was to be {115} made a French\r\nprotectorate, so that the supremacy of the Catholic religion might\r\nremain undisputed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly James appealed for help, and Tyrconnel sent him 3,000 men; but\r\nthey could not keep the king's throne, and on March 12, 1689, James\r\nlanded at Kinsale from France, a king without a throne, a Catholic\r\nwithout a conscience, and a fanatic without a scruple.  His visit to\r\nIreland had an ominous precedent in the case of Richard II., and it had\r\na similar result.  It was obvious that the English monarch relied\r\nentirely upon his viceroy to save his throne.  Ireland was even then\r\nrenowned for its simple-hearted allegiance to the old faith, and James\r\nwas under the impression that fanaticism can beat generalship and\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: King James in Dublin]\r\n\r\nTyrconnel, ever optimistic when fighting was imminent, met James at\r\nCork, and headed the triumphant procession into Dublin on March 24,\r\n1689.  The king was rapturously welcomed from Cork to Dublin as the\r\nfriend of Ireland and of its religion, and Lady Tyrconnel organized a\r\nfete at the Castle, in which she endeavoured to remind the nervous and\r\ndejected king of the former glories of the Stuart dynasty when the\r\nfamily seemed all-powerful and secure.  James, however, unwisely and\r\nneedlessly irritated her by a display of indifference, and at a dance\r\nhe exasperated her by leading out a less-known but more beautiful\r\nmember of Irish society.  The viceroy's wife was Duchess of Tyrconnel\r\nby now, for the Lord-Lieutenant had been created a duke on the {116}\r\narrival of the king; but it is as Earl of Tyrconnel that he is known.\r\nJames had not the power to create peerages in 1689.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to enter minutely into any of the details of the\r\nJacobean war in Ireland.  It was a religious and a political contest,\r\nbut the presence of James and the multitude of his counsellors were the\r\nchief causes of the Catholic defeat.  In the Parliament James summoned\r\nat Dublin there was a member named Patrick Sarsfield, afterwards given\r\nthe worthless and illegal title of Earl of Lucan, who was destined to\r\nplay a leading part in the fortunes of James, and who might have won\r\nsuccess for his royal master had his qualities been recognized in high\r\nquarters.  Tyrconnel, however, always ready to sacrifice the good of\r\nhis country for the good of himself, kept Sarsfield under, and James,\r\nwho had been given proof of Sarsfield's devotion, distrusted his\r\nability.  At a time when everybody had deserted James, Patrick\r\nSarsfield stood by him, and in the very first encounter with the army\r\nof William he proved his courage.  The viceroy was now old and crippled\r\nby gout, but he insisted upon holding the principal place in James's\r\nCouncil, and when it was announced that William was coming to Ireland,\r\nit was he who insisted upon James fighting for his crown, although that\r\nmonarch was secretly preparing for his return to France.  James created\r\ndefeat for himself, and his motley collection of adventurers made that\r\ndefeat certain.  No real attempt was made to bring a disciplined army\r\ninto the field against the King of England, and {117} only the bravery\r\nand genius of the troops made the Battle of the Boyne a battle at all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Battle of the Boyne]\r\n\r\nThis decisive conflict was fought on Tuesday, July 1, 1690, and the\r\nstars in their courses fought for William.  James was in the way of his\r\nown Generals, and in the many critical moments of the battle there were\r\nschisms in the Council.  But it was James who contributed most to the\r\ndefeat of his army, and well might Patrick Sarsfield exclaim bitterly:\r\n'Change kings, and we will fight you over again.'\r\n\r\nThe ex-king was almost the first fugitive from the field, and he rode\r\nwithout cessation until he reached Dublin Castle, weary,\r\ntravel-stained, but just the same sneering, disappointed incompetent,\r\nwho had sacrificed many humble lives nobler than his own.  When Lady\r\nTyrconnel, flustered and alarmed, came down to greet him, James\r\ncaustically informed her that the Irish ran well.\r\n\r\n'Your Majesty seems to have won the race,' was Lady Tyrconnel's witty\r\nrejoinder; and the king remained silent.\r\n\r\nFrom Dublin James, thanks to his forethought, was able to cross to\r\nFrance immediately, and he scandalized Paris by declaring that the\r\nIrish were cowards to a man, who had run away at the first shot from\r\nthe enemy.  The result of this libel was that the members of the Irish\r\ncolony in Paris were mobbed in the streets, and long afterwards, when\r\nphysical ill-treatment ceased, the name of an Irishman stood for\r\ncowardice in the best Parisian circles.\r\n\r\n{118}\r\n\r\nThe ex-king left Tyrconnel, Lauzun, Boisseleau, and Sarsfield to fight\r\nhis battle against William, and after the disastrous Boyne they retired\r\non Limerick.  William followed hastily, and presently his 28,000 men\r\nwere besieging the city, which was garrisoned by not more than 15,000\r\ntroops.  The hero of the siege was Sarsfield, and it is to his story\r\nthat this belongs.  Tyrconnel was anxious to get out of the country,\r\nand when Sarsfield had driven the English army from the walls of\r\nLimerick the viceroy followed King James into exile, the Duke of\r\nBerwick being styled 'viceroy.'  A Council of Twelve assisted the duke,\r\nwhile Tyrconnel, having, with his wife, gone to France with all their\r\navailable resources, interviewed James, and induced him to send him\r\nback to Ireland as Lord-Lieutenant.  Furthermore, James was persuaded\r\nto give Tyrconnel a grant of L8,000.  In such a state of war there\r\ncould be no real viceroy, and Tyrconnel was compelled to pass his time\r\nbetween pleasures and fears.  Chroniclers recount stories of the\r\nfestivities given by him in his own honour during a stay at Galway.  He\r\nwas too old for anything else.  Meanwhile the rival generals in the\r\nfield proved easy victims for William's commanders.  The Earl of\r\nMarlborough came to Ireland to supplement his small experience of\r\nwarfare, and, of course, he performed creditably, for the Jacobean\r\ntroops were badly clothed, fed, and armed.  Sarsfield alone seemed\r\nworth his position, and his efforts were negatived by the incompetence\r\nof his colleagues.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Treaty of Limerick]\r\n\r\nOn August 14, 1691, Tyrconnel died, sixty-one {119} years of age, but\r\nworn out and feeble.  He was buried by night and in such haste that his\r\nburial-place quickly became a mystery.  He died just before the end of\r\nthe Jacobean struggle in Ireland, for a few days afterwards the Treaty\r\nof Limerick was signed, and Sarsfield left the country to fight as a\r\nsoldier of fortune, and to die an honourable death on a foreign\r\nbattlefield.  In the contest between James's Irish army and that of\r\nWilliam the latter had all the luck and the former all the traitors.\r\nIt was, therefore, a matter for astonishment that the Jacobean troops\r\nshould have gained any victories at all.  Certain it is that the\r\nEnglish commanders never gained reputations so cheaply.  When\r\nMarlborough returned to London he was feted as a victor by the king;\r\nbut all he did was to overcome by means of sheer force small and\r\nirregular bodies of troops indifferently armed and often badly led.\r\nMarlborough did not learn anything of the art of generalship by his\r\nmonth's visit to Ireland.  Patrick Sarsfield was the only man who\r\nproved his worth as a leader and his courage as a soldier.  We know\r\nthat he fought for a good cause but an unworthy man, and that the cause\r\nwas something better than the restoration of James to the throne of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{120}}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThe Orange Government in Ireland was in the hands of two Lords Justices\r\nnamed Coningsby and Porter, but as soon as the Treaty of Limerick ended\r\nthe hopes of the Jacobeans William decided to send one of his followers\r\nas viceroy.  There were many claimants on the king's gratitude, but\r\nHenry Sidney, fourth son of Robert, second Earl of Leicester, one of\r\nCharles I.'s viceroys, had been well rewarded by the Dutchman for his\r\ntreachery towards James.  Sidney had been present at the Battle of the\r\nBoyne, being now a viscount, and when there was plenty of Irish land\r\nand money to be distributed Viscount Sidney received 50,000 acres and\r\nan allowance of L2,000 a year.  During the reign of Charles II. Sidney\r\nhad taken a prominent part in court life, and his beauty was such that\r\nhe was regarded as 'the greatest terror to husbands' of his day.\r\nJames, Duke of York, and his duchess, formerly Anne Hyde, took young\r\nSidney into their confidence, and gave him a court appointment.  He\r\nretorted by endeavouring to ruin the duchess's reputation, and when\r\nthey dismissed him he continued his plottings.  He was successful in so\r\nfar that he caused a temporary separation between James {121} and his\r\nwife; but at the accession of Charles's brother he was taken back into\r\nfavour.  Sidney, however, was determined to act the part of the\r\ntraitor, and he quickly betrayed his cause to William.  Besides this\r\nfondness for plotting Sidney found time to earn the reputation of one\r\nof the most immoral men, even in Charles's reign.  He regarded every\r\nwoman of beauty as fit prey for his passion, and even when he was\r\nnearly seventy his intrigues were the talk of London.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protestant Party dissatisfied]\r\n\r\nThis was the man William sent to represent him in Ireland, and when\r\nViscount Sidney arrived in Dublin in 1692 he was fifty-one years of\r\nage, unmarried, and still very handsome.  But he was not a statesman or\r\na soldier, and his position alone made him great.  He was not equal to\r\nthe task of carrying out the changes created by the Treaty of\r\nLimerick--a treaty hotly repudiated by the Protestant party in Ireland,\r\nwho, now that William's cause had triumphed, naturally looked for a\r\nreturn of their supremacy and the subjection of the majority.  Sidney's\r\nconciliatory attitude towards the Catholics brought down upon him the\r\nwrath of the Protestant clergy and aristocracy; Parliament met, and\r\ndenounced his indulgences to members of the rival faith, and, although\r\nSidney dissolved it, the effect on the king was considerable.  He dare\r\nnot remove the viceroy, and yet Sidney was dangerous so long as he\r\nremained in Ireland.  A way out of the difficulty was found by the\r\n'promotion' of the viceroy to the post of 'Master-General of the\r\nOrdnance,' and in {122} 1694--the year after he vacated office--he was\r\ncreated Earl of Romney.\r\n\r\nSidney never married, but he did not altogether escape the\r\nresponsibilities of parentage.  He complained very often of the worry\r\nmany women gave him by pestering him with demands for the provision of\r\ntheir children.  During his brief viceroyalty one of his numerous\r\nvictims had the courage to beard him in Dublin Castle, and demand that\r\nhe should contribute towards the maintenance of the three children she\r\nhad borne him.  Sidney dare not send the woman away empty-handed, and\r\nhe gave her L500; but the majority of his victims never received\r\nanything, for he was as mean as he was vicious.  Had it not been that\r\nby accident he could claim to have given William and Mary the Crown of\r\nEngland, Sidney would never have risen to any position at all.  He\r\nbecame prominent by sheer chance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Capel of Tewkesbury]\r\n\r\nIt was expected that care would be taken to make the new viceroy\r\nacceptable to the Protestant party; but there was a delay, and William\r\nallowed the Government to be conducted by three Commissioners, the most\r\npowerful being Sir Henry Capel, Lord Capel of Tewkesbury.  Capel was a\r\nfanatical Protestant and a bitter opponent of Roman Catholicism in all\r\nshapes and forms.  His fellow-commissioners were less ferocious, but\r\nCapel managed to gain his way in most things, and he was viceroy in\r\nreality, though not in name.  Meanwhile the English party in Dublin\r\nused every atom of influence to secure the elevation of Capel to the\r\nviceroyalty, and in 1695 they succeeded.  {123} The cause of\r\nProtestantism seemed safe now, but Capel did not live long, and on May\r\n14, 1696, he died in Dublin Castle.  Capel is remembered mainly because\r\nhe gave Jonathan Swift his first preferment--the benefice of Kilroot,\r\nworth about L100 a year.  This was in 1695.\r\n\r\nCommissioners in the persons of Lords Justices conducted the affairs of\r\nState without the supervision of a viceroy.  One of these was the Earl\r\nof Berkeley, whose dealings with Dean Swift, when that eccentric cleric\r\nwas seeking a high appointment, have become historic.  Berkeley was one\r\nof the Lords Justices, and he had it in his power to bestow preferment,\r\nbut Swift was unable or unwilling to pay his price, and one day in a\r\nrage he cried to Berkeley and his secretary: 'God confound you for a\r\ncouple of scoundrels!'  On December 12, 1700, William appointed his\r\nwife's uncle, Laurence Hyde, Earl of Rochester, a nobleman who had\r\naccepted this office sixteen years before from Charles, and had not\r\ntroubled to journey to Ireland.  His second appointment did not arouse\r\nany enthusiasm either in the man or in the country he was called upon\r\nto govern, and it was not until the following September that he landed\r\nin Ireland.  As a relative of the queen's--his sister, Anne Hyde, was\r\nher mother--the Earl of Rochester carried greater authority than many\r\nof his predecessors; but he was no statesman, and at sixty years of age\r\nhe was not inclined to try experiments.  William thought he was\r\nindolent and contemptuous of his duties, and in 1702 he {124} informed\r\nhim that he had been relieved of his office.  Immediately, however,\r\nfurther news came from London continuing Rochester in his office.  This\r\nwas the result of the intervention by Queen Mary; but Rochester\r\nresigned on February 4, 1703, rather than be subjected any longer to\r\nthe machinations of the Marlborough party at the court.\r\n\r\nLord Rochester returned to London in a passion scarcely cooled by the\r\nlength of the journey; but he was mollified somewhat by the fact that\r\nhis successor, the Duke of Ormonde, was his son-in-law.  He had no\r\nobjection to his daughter reigning at Dublin Castle.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The second Duke of Ormonde]\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Duchess of Ormonde were received with an enthusiasm in\r\nDublin that was reminiscent of the personal supremacy of the viceroy's\r\ngrandfather, known as the 'Great Duke.'  The new viceroy had been\r\ncarefully educated for his position.  A son of the celebrated Lord\r\nOssory, he had been from his birth in 1665 educated with a view to\r\nfuture eminence in the service of the State.  The boy's grandfather\r\nsent him to France in 1675 to acquire the French language and the\r\npolite arts of the centre of good manners and tone.  When he was\r\nseventeen he was married to Anne Hyde, a daughter of Laurence Hyde, and\r\na cousin to the Duchess of York.  She died early the following year,\r\nand when, in 1686, he married a daughter of the Duke of Beaufort, he\r\nwas a Lord of the Bedchamber to James II., and one of the most\r\ninfluential of the younger nobility.  The year of the Revolution\r\nwitnessed Ormonde's succession to the title and estates, and {125} he\r\nbecame one of the most powerful pillars of the Protestant faith in the\r\ncountry.  The ancient Universities were in grave doubt as to the king's\r\nintention, and Oxford, therefore, in order to secure the aid of such a\r\npowerful nobleman in the cause of the Protestant faith, elected him\r\nChancellor.  He had been a student at Christ Church, and the honour\r\nwas, therefore, a fit one.\r\n\r\nJames went to work cautiously to win over the young duke to his new\r\npolicy.  He gave him the Garter, and hinted at even greater honours in\r\nstore for one who by his birth became entitled to nearly everything\r\nthat life had to offer.  The question of religion, however, caused a\r\nbreach between James and the duke, and William's invasion of England\r\nbrought Ormonde to his side.\r\n\r\nOrmonde's adhesion undoubtedly had the effect of bringing over to the\r\nnew monarch a great many persons in Ireland who had acted previously\r\nlike sheep without a shepherd.  All that the dethroned king could do\r\nwas to declare Ormonde's estates forfeited and his person guilty of\r\nhigh treason.  But the acts of a fallen king are merely futilities, and\r\nthe Duke of Ormonde was able to witness the triumph at Boyne and know\r\nthat William's success meant his own.  The duke's principal task in the\r\nwar was to secure Dublin for the king, and he accomplished this without\r\nmuch difficulty, thanks to the weakness and mistake of his opponents\r\nrather than to his own skill.  Later he entertained William at his\r\nancestral home, Kilkenny Castle, in celebration of the royal successes.\r\n\r\n{126}\r\n\r\nThe accession of Queen Anne, second daughter of James II., did not\r\naffect Ormonde's high position in the State.  He had stood by the\r\nbedside of William, and he was one of those who settled the difficult\r\nquestion of the succession.  Queen Anne must have guessed that Ormonde\r\nat heart wished for the success of the Jacobean cause, and it was\r\nduring her reign that he was successively Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland\r\nand Captain-General of the Forces in England.\r\n\r\nIn 1703 Ormonde entered upon his first term of office as\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and, of course, the Protestant party\r\nwelcomed him joyfully.  Parliament met, and subserviently voted him a\r\nsubsidy, conscious of favours to come.  But the viceroy did not fulfil\r\ntheir hopes.  Ormonde was not the man to stoop to persecution and\r\nfraud, and, being only a layman, he could not see that religion covered\r\na multitude of sins.  His Parliament grew unruly, and from asking for\r\nfavours began to demand them.  This was too much for the grandson of\r\nthe great duke, and so he dissolved the assembly, as his powers\r\nentitled him to do, and continued to rule, preferring, no doubt, the\r\nprivate criticisms of Jonathan Swift, who was in his favour, rather\r\nthan submit to the arrogance of a minority as unscrupulous as it was\r\nintolerant.\r\n\r\nSwift was at this time beginning to make himself known in those high\r\ncircles which soon began to fear him.  Ormonde liked the somewhat\r\neccentric clergyman, while the duchess and her daughters were delighted\r\nwith his witty conversation {127} and his powers of repartee.  Swift,\r\nhowever, was restlessly ambitious, and he was continually journeying to\r\nLondon, returning each time more disappointed and more ambitious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Court intrigues]\r\n\r\nIt was one of the most peculiar periods in the history of England.  The\r\ndaughter of James II. was on the throne, and it was the generally\r\naccepted national policy that she should be the last of her family and\r\nrace to wear the crown.  There were a dozen parties in the State, and\r\nthe poor queen had to suffer herself to be buffeted by the numerous\r\nleaders, who plotted without principle, and were religious without\r\nhaving any religion.  Marlborough, Godolphin, Somers, and half a dozen\r\nothers buzzed round the queen.  Ladies of high estate joined in the\r\nnumerous intrigues, and every party had its literary hacks and\r\nhangers-on who wrote to order, and hoped to fatten on the carcass of\r\nthe State when their particular masters had triumphed.  It was the\r\nGolden Age of the wirepullers.\r\n\r\nOrmonde's position in Dublin was at once safe and tantalizing.  The\r\ngovernment was entirely in his hands, and he could do what he liked;\r\nbut the knowledge that the plotters in London might precipitate a\r\nrevolution or ruin the country made Ormonde--an ambitious man\r\nhimself--long to be free to take his own part in the underground fight.\r\nThe triumph of his opponents in 1707 naturally relieved him of his\r\noffice, and it was not until the end of 1710 that his party returned,\r\nand the queen reappointed him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Thomas Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, {128} and Thomas, Earl of\r\nWharton, ran their brief careers in the viceregal court.  Ormonde's\r\nsecond term lasted a little over two years, but his recall also brought\r\nwith it the higher post of Captain-General of the Forces and the sweet\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the Marlborough party in disfavour.  No doubt,\r\nif it had been possible, Ormonde would have used his great position to\r\ninsure the Jacobean succession, but he knew that public opinion was\r\nunanimous in its detestation of the Stuarts, and that Jacobinism was\r\nmerely a harmless political theory to be debated by students and\r\nignored by statesmen.  Bowing to the inevitable, Ormonde signed the\r\nproclamation announcing the death of Anne and the accession of George\r\nI.  But he could not conceal his dislike of the Hanoverian monarch, and\r\nhe made his house at Richmond a meeting-place for those who desired the\r\nreturn of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of his life is a record of disappointment.  There was no\r\nchance of his cause succeeding, and without even a blow he fled from\r\nEngland and spent the last thirty years of his life in exile, visiting\r\nEngland but once, and experiencing the humiliating poverty of the\r\nharmless plotter, the recipient of pity when he expected hero-worship,\r\nand, worse than that, regarded generally as a hopeless crank.  His\r\nestates were declared forfeited and vested in the Crown; but in 1721\r\nthe exile's brother, Lord Arran, was allowed by Parliament to purchase\r\nthem.  Thirty years after his flight Ormonde died, the year of his\r\ndeath--1745--marking the last attempt of the {129} Jacobites to regain\r\nthe throne of England.  He outlived his glory, and those who met him\r\nduring the last few years of his life could see nothing but a querulous\r\nold man who boasted of exploits forgotten if not altogether\r\ndiscredited; but he had been great once, and so merited their pity, and\r\npity is all the fallen greatness earns in obscurity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Pembroke and Swift]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Pembroke remained in Ireland less than a couple of years,\r\nplaying at governing, and amused by Swift.  The post of Lord High\r\nAdmiral was more to his liking, and he gladly resigned the viceroyalty\r\nto take it up.  Swift acted as chaplain to Pembroke, but his principal\r\nduty appears to have been that of amusing the earl with humorous\r\ndoggerel or by his caustic criticisms of Dublin's leading citizens,\r\nofficial and otherwise.  The punning correspondence with the viceroy\r\nwas the forerunner of a habit that lasted through Swift's life, and\r\ngained him a reputation for wit which, fortunately for the dean, was\r\nsupplemented by something more recondite.  During several viceroyalties\r\nhe exercised considerable influence, and although Swift hotly\r\nrepudiated the title of Irishman, at times he rendered some service to\r\nthe country in which he was born.  The Earl of Wharton was sixty when\r\nappointed Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland on November 25, 1708, and there\r\nwere forty years of profligacy behind him.  He was an atheist,\r\nunscrupulous, licentious, witty, contemptuous, and absolutely without\r\nfear.  From the first he had been an opponent of James II., and the\r\ninvitation to William was suggested by {130} Wharton.  To send this man\r\nto Ireland to settle the religious question and maintain the supremacy\r\nof the Protestant party was a matchless piece of irony; but Wharton,\r\nwho could insist upon an elaborate ritual of household prayers in his\r\nown home, undertook the task, undeterred by the sneers of his\r\nopponents, the amazement of his friends, and the bitter invective of\r\nthat disappointed office-seeker, Jonathan Swift.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Wharton]\r\n\r\nWharton had done considerable service to the cause of William by the\r\nwriting of a single song that proved to be worth an army to the Orange\r\nparty.  Like most of the English nobility, Wharton had been vastly\r\namused by Tyrconnel's elevation to the viceroyalty.  In his opinion the\r\nposition was one for a gentleman, and not a bully with Irish leanings\r\nand unrepentantly Catholic.  The famous song, set to music by Purcell,\r\nand known as 'Lilli Burlero, Bullen-a-la,' was the result, and,\r\nwhistled and sung from one end of the country to the other, it\r\nridiculed Tyrconnel out of existence.  That was Wharton's first\r\ncontribution to the history of Ireland.\r\n\r\nHis second took the form of a law declaring that all property held by\r\nCatholics must be inherited by their Protestant heirs--a statute which\r\nwas declared to do more towards stamping out Popery in three months\r\nthan all others had done in three years.  The viceroy, however, took no\r\npains to please anybody but himself.  He lived in Dublin as he lived in\r\nLondon, and, when satiated with the pleasures of the Irish metropolis,\r\nhe crossed over to London, following the example of his {131}\r\npredecessors, who never became too fond of Dublin to prefer it to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nWharton's first wife, Ann Lee, brought him a large fortune and a plain\r\nface; his second, Lucy Loftus, was heavily dowered, but her character\r\nalmost matched his own--and that is saying a great deal.  During his\r\nviceroyalty most of the royalty was absent, and Dublin Castle became a\r\nglorified tavern and brothel.  The viceroy's discarded mistresses were\r\nmarried to distressed profligates, whom Wharton promoted to office in\r\nthe State or gave preferment in the Church.  Once he recommended a boon\r\ncompanion for a bishopric, declaring that 'James was the most\r\nhonourable man alive, and possessed of a character practically\r\nfaultless save for his damnable morals.'  This person did not secure\r\nthe bishopric, but he found compensation in a deanery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Joseph Addison]\r\n\r\nThe only sober member of the viceroy's retinue was Joseph Addison,\r\nwhose hackwork in the service of the party had been rewarded with this\r\nappointment, much to Swift's envy, for the Irishman was supposed to be\r\nentitled to payment before Addison, who served with zeal 'the\r\nprofligate son of a Puritanical father, and the father of a son more\r\nlicentious than himself.'  When the Lord-Lieutenant left Ireland the\r\nParliament actually thanked the queen for having sent 'one so great in\r\nwisdom and experience to be our chief Governor.'  This was the man who\r\nhad knighted potmen who served him with ale, tried to idealize the most\r\nabandoned women, and regarded with complacency the amours of his wife,\r\nwho, having {132} lost the affections of her husband, found consolation\r\nin a dozen other men.  Cardsharpers, profligates, and every species of\r\nbase adventurer had the _entree_ to Dublin Castle, where the viceroy\r\nreigned as a 'prince of good fellows,' many of whom had been kicked out\r\nof decent society in London.  But Wharton was powerful enough to be\r\nmore than unconventional, and it suited his peculiar sense of humour to\r\nshock even his most licentious companions-in-arms.  When they roamed\r\nDublin at night seeking for prey, Wharton behaved like a drunken\r\nmadman, and he fondly imagined that his identity was not discovered,\r\nexcept when, in an intoxicated mood, he called for a sword and bestowed\r\nknighthoods indiscriminately on waiters and landlords, and even went\r\nthrough the farce of knighting women of the street.  His motto was\r\nnever to give a challenge and never to refuse one.  When in his teens\r\nhe had fought two duels with outraged husbands, and gained the victory\r\nin each encounter.\r\n\r\nHis viceroyalty was certainly unconventional.  Dignified prelates,\r\nhovering in draughty rooms and corridors, were twitted mercilessly by\r\nmy Lord Wharton, who was the most contemptuous enemy the Protestant\r\nfaith ever knew.  Once he declared that he hated all religions, but if\r\nhe had to join one he would select the Presbyterian, because it was\r\nopposed to the Church of England.  Swift's famous attack on him merely\r\ncreated a temporary annoyance in the English nobleman.\r\n\r\nIt was no misfortune for Ireland that the fall of the Government\r\nentailed Wharton's recall in {133} October, 1710, and the Duke of\r\nOrmonde's reappointment was at once announced.  Wharton, cynical and\r\ncontemptuous, looked upon his supersession with indifference.  He had\r\nexhausted all the pleasures Dublin had to offer, and so London knew him\r\nonce more.  He lived until 1715, and saw King George on the throne and\r\nhis rival, Ormonde, a penniless fugitive.  The latter fact must have\r\nenabled him to believe that there were compensations in this world even\r\nfor a man who defied it.  There is a story told of him which aptly\r\nillustrates his cynical sense of humour.  When the famous 'twelve\r\npeers' were created by Queen Anne in order that the Government might\r\ncarry a certain measure in the House of Lords, Wharton nicknamed them\r\n'the jury,' and, rising in his place in the House of Lords, inquired\r\nblandly whether the twelve voted singly or through their foreman.  He\r\nwas nearing the close of his life when a marquisate was conferred on\r\nhim, and he maintained his influence on public affairs right to the end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duke of Shrewsbury]\r\n\r\nThe second viceroyalty of Ormonde having terminated, Queen Anne\r\nselected Charles Talbot, twelfth Earl and only Duke of Shrewsbury, to\r\nsucceed him in 1713.  It was the queen's last important appointment,\r\nand Shrewsbury carried on the Government from 1713 to 1717, spending\r\nmore time in England than in Ireland, and contenting himself by staying\r\nat Dublin Castle whenever the Irish Parliament was in session.  He was\r\nan interesting person in many ways.  Named after Charles II. because he\r\nwas the first {134} of that king's godchildren--being born in the year\r\nof the Restoration--he passed his childhood amid Catholic influences.\r\nHis mother carried on an intrigue with the Duke of Buckingham which\r\nresulted in her husband's death.  According to a contemporary, Lady\r\nShrewsbury, disguised as a page, held Buckingham's horse whilst he\r\nkilled her husband in the duel that followed the discovery of her\r\ninfidelity.\r\n\r\nIn 1699 Shrewsbury, who had formed one of the seven who invited William\r\nto come to England, was offered the viceroyalty, but declined it, as\r\nwell as half a dozen alternative proposals made to him.  He was tired\r\nof politics, and for three years--1700-02--he lived in Rome, and then\r\ntravelled about the Continent.  He brought back with him an Italian\r\nwife, a lady whose jealousy, ambition, and unscrupulousness shortened\r\nhis life.  Shrewsbury was not ambitious, but his wife was, and it is\r\nsupposed that she induced him to accept the viceroyalty so that she\r\nmight play at being a queen amid the indifferent and unorganized state\r\nof Dublin society.  Swift, who met him very often, described him as\r\n'the finest gentleman we have'; and William referred to him more than\r\nonce as 'the King of Hearts.'  Lady Shrewsbury insisted upon his\r\nkeeping his Irish appointment, and, bullied by her, he did, although he\r\nneither loved nor respected her.  In London the Italian sought to place\r\nherself at the head of society as the wife of His Majesty's\r\nrepresentative, but failed decisively.  Her husband became the butt of\r\nthe wits; he was mercilessly ridiculed, and even the {135} gift of the\r\noffice of Lord Chamberlain, to enable him to retire from the\r\nviceroyalty, could not help him to regain his prestige.  He died in\r\n1718, and all England ascribed his premature death to his wife.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Draining the Irish exchequer]\r\n\r\nCharles Paulet, Duke of Bolton and Marquis of Winchester, accepted the\r\nvacancy, and came to Dublin in 1719 to open the Irish Parliament.  This\r\nwas two years after his appointment, but it was not necessary in those\r\ndays for the viceroy to govern in person.  He had his share of the\r\nprofits of the office remitted to him in London.  These consisted of\r\nthe official salary and such annual sums as were due to him by persons\r\nwhom he either continued in office or appointed.  It is related of Lord\r\nWharton that, despite his wealth, he insisted upon all persons\r\nnominated by him paying a commission on their salaries, and in one\r\nparticular instance he agreed with a certain lawyer to make him Lord\r\nJustice at a salary of L40 a month, the latter agreeing to hand over\r\nthe balance of the official allowance of L100 per month to the viceroy.\r\nIreland was regarded as a sort of till to be robbed by viceroys and\r\ntheir friends.  For many years it had been the practice to include the\r\nheavy expenses of the numerous mistresses of royalty in the accounts of\r\nthe Government of Ireland; but most of the money came from London.  Yet\r\nIreland got the reputation of being costly and useless, while every\r\nmonarch and every English statesman continued to rob the Irish\r\nExchequer and the people.  They drained the country without troubling\r\nto insure its stability and prosperity; active attempts were {136} made\r\nand succeeded in injuring Irish industries, and the greatest sufferers\r\nwere the descendants of the English settlers.  By now there was no\r\n'English colony' to uphold the viceroy's rights or wrongs, and to every\r\nEnglishman a resident in Ireland was 'savage and Irish.'  Dean Swift,\r\nwho spent a lifetime endeavouring to disprove the--to him--terrible\r\naccusation of being Irish, was moved to declare that the Anglo-Irish\r\nfamilies spoke the best English, and were the most civilized persons\r\nunder the dominion of the English Crown.  It is amusing to read his\r\nletter to Pope (July 13, 1737), in which he scornfully protests against\r\nthe confusion existing in English minds concerning the 'savage old\r\nIrish' and the 'English gentry in Ireland.'  Five years before this he\r\ndeclared to Sir Charles Wigan that the peasantry were distinguished by\r\n'a better natural taste for good sense, humour, and raillery than ever\r\nI observed among people of the like sort in England.'  Swift's attack\r\non the English administration of Ireland was, however, not intended for\r\nthe benefit of the country as a whole.  He represented the 'English in\r\nIreland,' and was fond of describing them as 'English colonists.'\r\nWhigs and Tories alike used the unfortunate country for selfish\r\nreasons, and Irish trade was ruined to appease English voters or to\r\nguard the vested interests of great noblemen.  There was no purely\r\nIrish party to attack the abuses of the administration in Dublin; the\r\nleading men were placated with office, or else had to join in the\r\nscramble for emoluments, for fear that they should be left out in the\r\ncold.  {137} The Protestant Church was in the ascendancy; the Catholic\r\nhierarchy looked on complacently, leaving it to the priests to show\r\nthat the Catholic religion was not altogether selfish and political.\r\nSwift himself was a typical clergyman of the Established Church,\r\nirreligious, scornful of his trust, and seeking preferment in the\r\nChurch because it was the only way to power for a man of humble birth\r\nin those days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irish society]\r\n\r\nDublin Castle seldom housed the viceroy, the administration being left\r\nto one or more Lords Justices who escaped criticism, provided their\r\nremittances to the absent Lord-Lieutenant were regular and satisfactory\r\nin amount.  Dublin society was scarcely half formed, and consisted of\r\nbeggarly exiles from England, compelled to emigrate by reason of their\r\ndebts and misdeeds, the friends and relatives of the Lords Justices,\r\nobscure army officers and their kind, and a few of the wealthier\r\ncitizens who could not be ignored.  Those with English names affected\r\nto despise those with Irish; it was considered sheer savagery not to\r\nspeak well of the Government, for the viceroy and his lady set the\r\nfashions, and not to follow them was to court ignominy and insult.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Duke of Bolton accepted the viceroyalty out of\r\ncuriosity and on the condition that the Government paid the expenses of\r\nhis journey to Dublin to see the Irish.  Charles Spencer, Earl of\r\nSunderland, and Lord Townshend had allowed themselves in 1714 and 1716\r\nrespectively to accept the post, but neither nobleman troubled to visit\r\nIreland; and the Duke of {138} Bolton was regarded with a certain\r\namount of admiration for his pluck and fortitude in surrendering the\r\ndelights of London for the uncivilization of Dublin.  Charles Fitzroy,\r\nDuke of Grafton, a descendant of Charles II., became Lord-Lieutenant in\r\n1721, and tasted some of the sweets of sovereignty as the\r\nrepresentative of the king, whose occupancy of the throne meant the\r\nextinction of the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nGrafton came to Ireland with no intention of overworking himself in the\r\nservice of the State, and he was, therefore, disagreeably surprised\r\nwhen he found himself in the midst of a political turmoil.  Dean\r\nSwift's satire was stinging everybody, irrespective of position or\r\nclass.  Roused by him, the people were actually protesting against the\r\nnewest form of English tyranny, and they even dared to scream insults\r\nat the gilded fop as he drove about the city.  It was the irony of fate\r\nthat all the trouble should be caused by the king's fondness for his\r\nmistress.  Grafton, however, was averse to facing a crisis; he was\r\nbetter in London--far from the maddening Irish--and when Grafton\r\nretired with alacrity in 1723, the Government decided to send John,\r\nLord Carteret, to carry out their policy.  The descendant of Charles\r\nII. was not eager to battle for the vindication of a policy arising out\r\nof the turgid German morals of the oddest figure that ever sat on the\r\nthrone of England.  King George's failing was that he possessed\r\nappetite without appreciation; he wanted the best, and yet never\r\nrecognized it when he had it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{139}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nLord Carteret was only thirty-four when, on April 3, 1724, he was\r\ndeclared Viceroy of Ireland.  The appointment was Walpole's, whose\r\naccession to power presented him with the opportunity of sending\r\nCarteret to quell the disturbance in Ireland which he himself--the new\r\nviceroy--had encouraged secretly while occupying a private position in\r\nthe State.  Carteret, however, did not flinch, nor did he exhibit any\r\ndistaste for the task.  It was not necessary to treat the Irish as\r\nhuman beings, and he knew that if he propitiated the Anglo-Irish he\r\nwould gain his own way in everything.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the trouble and turmoil was the grant of a patent to the\r\nDuchess of Kendal, the king's mistress, for the coining of halfpence in\r\nIreland.  The duchess already drew L3,000 a year from the Irish\r\nExchequer, but her avarice was aroused by stories of how easily the\r\nIrish were plundered, and she persuaded the king to give her the famous\r\npatent.  She passed it on to Wood, who paid her L10,000, and agreed to\r\nremit to the State L1,000 a year for fourteen years.  The coinage was\r\nnot base, but it meant that a profit of L40,000 was to pass into the\r\npockets of the {140} king's mistress and William Wood; they were to rob\r\nrich and poor alike, and the State was to lose heavily.  The grant was\r\nmade without consulting the Irish Parliament or the Irish Privy Council.\r\n\r\nSwift, who had been waiting for this opportunity, seized it with\r\navidity, and the 'Drapier's Letters' was the result.  Wood's halfpence\r\nwas characteristic of English misrule of Ireland, and, roused to frenzy\r\nby the dean's pamphlets, the country unanimously obeyed his call to\r\nignore the latest coins, and always to refuse to recognize their\r\nlegality.  The dean's extravagant fancy found full scope in the\r\n'Drapier's Letters'; the pamphlets were sold in their tens of\r\nthousands, and Walpole's determination was outmatched by the fury of\r\nthe Irish not to allow themselves to be swindled to provide for the\r\nexpenses of the German's mistress.\r\n\r\nThe new viceroy landed in Ireland in the month that witnessed the\r\npublication of the fourth 'Letter,' and his first act was to offer a\r\nreward of L300 for the discovery of the writer.  Swift's anonymity was\r\ntoo safe, however, and the Lord-Lieutenant had to be satisfied with the\r\narrest of the printer, Harding.  When the dean heard of this, he\r\nbearded Carteret in Dublin Castle, and reproached him in singularly\r\nstraightforward language with cowardice and weakness in persecuting a\r\ntradesman.  The viceroy took the verbal buffeting in good part, for\r\nSwift and he were old friends; but Harding was put to all the worry and\r\nexpense of a prosecution at the hands of a {141} partisan Chief\r\nJustice--Whitshed--though the grand jury eventually threw out the bill\r\nagainst him, and he was discharged.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Swift's victory]\r\n\r\nThe cancellation of the patent has been described as a victory for\r\nSwift and Ireland, but all that can be said truthfully is that it\r\nenabled the dean to claim a personal triumph, while the county actually\r\nlost by the agreement.  For the surrender of his rights Wood was paid\r\nL3,000 a year for eight years, a sum--L24,000--at least equal to the\r\nprofits he would have made had he been allowed to carry out the terms\r\nof his patent without opposition.  The principal cause of the surrender\r\nto popular opinion was, undoubtedly, the indifference of Carteret to\r\nthe policy he had been sent to carry out.  He was no enthusiastic\r\nadmirer of Walpole's statesmanship, and he knew very well that Irish\r\naffairs were considered of no importance whatever in England, and that\r\nif he went to the trouble and worry of defeating the malcontents he\r\nwould get no credit in London, and make himself and his presence in\r\nDublin unpopular.  He was, therefore, only too willing to flatter\r\npublic opinion by pretending to bow to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Carteret]\r\n\r\nCarteret was a scholar and a gentleman, who did much to popularize the\r\nLatin quotation as a substitute for logic.  The statesmen of the\r\nperiod, whenever they were puzzled in English, immediately had recourse\r\nto the safe obscurity of a Latin or Greek epigram.  It was polished,\r\nabstruse, and impressive.  This mannerism gained for him the reputation\r\nof an orator--even the best of his generation--and Lord Chatham has\r\nplaced on {142} record his appreciation of Carteret: 'Whatever I am I\r\nowe to him.'\r\n\r\nThe viceroy did not create any precedent by remaining very long in\r\nDublin Castle.  It was an unwritten law that only during the actual\r\nsitting of Parliament was the Lord-Lieutenant's presence considered\r\nnecessary, and Carteret took full advantage of his opportunities to\r\nspend at leisure in London the money he drew so readily from Ireland.\r\nHad it not been for Swift, he might not have stayed in Dublin half as\r\nlong as he actually did.  The dean was the paramount power in Dublin\r\nsociety, although he complained that he was not popular among his\r\nequals.  The crowd, however, worshipped him; he was the national hero.\r\nAll this was pleasing and yet displeasing to the dean, whose soul\r\nlanguished for the smiles of the great.  He disliked a popularity that\r\nentailed the sneers of the educated, but he was not the man to abjure\r\nthe applause of the mob.  Carteret kept friendly with Swift, and never\r\ndenied him anything.  When this became known, Swift's house was the\r\nmeeting-place of all the office-seekers in Ireland, and some even came\r\nfrom England.  Swift had only to recommend a cleric to the viceroy's\r\nattention and the man's preferment was certain.\r\n\r\nOne of Swift's recommendations was in favour of Sheridan, the\r\ngrandfather of the celebrated dramatist and orator.  Carteret\r\ngood-naturedly presented Sheridan with a living, and made him one of\r\nhis chaplains; but the ex-schoolmaster, on the anniversary of the\r\naccession of the Hanoverian {143} family, preached a sermon from the\r\ntext, 'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.'  It was a pure\r\naccident, but Sheridan was accused of Jacobinism, and he was removed\r\nfrom his chaplaincy.  For the remainder of his life he was one of\r\nSwift's satellites, at the mercy of his generosity and his satire.\r\nSheridan records a story which illustrates very vividly the popularity\r\nof the famous Dean of St. Patrick's.  A large crowd assembled to\r\nwitness an eclipse.  Swift sent out the bellman to cry out to all and\r\nsundry that the eclipse had been postponed by the dean's orders, and\r\nthe crowd quietly dispersed!\r\n\r\nCarteret summed up his administration in words that have become\r\nhistoric.  'When people asked me how I governed Ireland,' he remarked,\r\n'I say that I pleased Dr. Swift.'  Carteret's egotism and selfishness\r\nwere diluted by a sense of humour that enabled him to tolerate Swift,\r\nhis unofficial jester.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Carteret retires]\r\n\r\nThe Lord-Lieutenant was reappointed in 1727, when George II. ascended\r\nthe throne and the Hanoverian succession assured; but his last\r\nappearance in Dublin was in 1729, and his successor did not arrive\r\nuntil two years later.  In 1728 the new Parliament building was erected\r\non the site of Chichester House.  From all accounts, Carteret was a\r\nsuccess.  It was no disadvantage to him that he was a heavy\r\ndrinker--had more viceroys taken to drink, Ireland might have escaped\r\nsome of the consequences of their greater follies--and without\r\nimitating the example of Wharton, he was broad-minded enough to see no\r\n{144} harm in the lax condition of Dublin society, which was then\r\nfollowing the lead set by London.  It is no exaggeration to ascribe\r\nCarteret's lack of failure to his cynical indifference to Irish\r\naffairs; he quite believed that Ireland was a nuisance, but a nuisance\r\nthat had to be endured.  The so-called Parliament must have ministered\r\nto his sense of humour.  Its English prototype was bad enough, but to\r\ncall the collection of retained nincompoops and Castle hacks a\r\nParliament was to degrade the word to the lowest depths.  Ireland never\r\nhad a Parliament, unless the generous historian grants that title to\r\nGrattan's.  In Carteret's time the 'Parliament' no more represented\r\nIreland than it did the land of the Chaldeans.\r\n\r\nThe successor to the late viceroy was Lionel Sackville, Duke of\r\nDorset--a courtier whose ambition it had been for years to represent\r\nthe king in Ireland.  It is significant of the progress Ireland, and\r\nespecially Dublin, was making that a great English nobleman such as\r\nDorset was should exert all his influence to secure the reversion of\r\nCarteret's post.  Not many years previously an Englishman of position\r\nwould have accepted the viceroyalty under compulsion only.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Four great noblemen]\r\n\r\nSackville resigned the post of Lord Steward to go to Ireland, and he\r\narrived to open the Parliament of 1731, staying until the early part of\r\nthe following year.  He visited the country again in 1733 and 1735, in\r\naccordance with the custom that rendered it imperative for the viceroy\r\nto preside at the opening of Parliament.  Beyond {145} that his duties\r\ndid not extend, and Dorset found the viceroyalty greatly to his liking.\r\nHe drew a large salary, executed several profitable deals in the shape\r\nof sales of offices, and took the money with him to England.\r\n'Uneventful' best describes his term of power, but to a man of his\r\ndisposition it was all he desired.  When, therefore, in the latter part\r\nof 1736, he was informed that he was to be replaced by William\r\nCavendish, third Duke of Devonshire, he hotly resented his\r\nsupersession, but could not prevail against the ministry, which\r\nplacated him with the post of Lord President of the Council.  But his\r\nexperience of Ireland had been too congenial to make him satisfied with\r\nhis position in London.  The loss of the great revenues, the sudden\r\nchange from an almost regal position to one of mediocrity in a society\r\nwhere he had few equals and many superiors, and the ridiculous ease\r\nwhereby the 'work' of his administration was accomplished, kept Dorset\r\ndissatisfied until his reappointment to Ireland in December, 1750.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, three other viceroys played their parts in making\r\nthe history of Ireland.  These were William Cavendish, Duke of\r\nDevonshire (1737-44), Philip Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield (1745), and\r\nWilliam Stanhope, Earl of Harrington (1746-51).\r\n\r\nOf these, it is obvious that the Earl of Chesterfield was the most\r\nremarkable.  The name of Devonshire suggests a yawn, and the third duke\r\nwas characteristic of it.  His viceroyalty was more apparent than real,\r\nand seems to have been {146} conducted on the principle that Ireland\r\nand Irish affairs were a bore, the journeys to Dublin intolerable, and\r\nthe Irish Parliament 'impossible.'  The duke, however, clung to the\r\noffice until 1744, content to leave administration to the Lords\r\nJustices, and pocketing the salary readily--the only point of unanimity\r\namongst the holders of the office in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Chesterfield]\r\n\r\nThe great Earl of Chesterfield was Viceroy of Ireland for eight months\r\nonly, and his life, therefore, belongs to the history of his native\r\ncountry; but he left his mark on Dublin, and in a few months\r\naccomplished more to raise the name of Englishman there than the seven\r\nyears of Devonshire and the eight of Dorset.  It is unnecessary to\r\nrecapitulate all the main facts of Chesterfield's life, while, as his\r\n'Letters' do not concern Irish affairs, they are no part of this\r\nhistory.  At the time of his appointment to the viceroyalty in 1745 he\r\nhad just passed his fiftieth year, and had left behind him many full\r\nyears.  Before he was twenty-one he was a member of Parliament, and by\r\nthe time he succeeded to the peerage in 1726 he had gained much of that\r\nrenowned knowledge of the world which provided the inspiration of the\r\nfamous 'Letters.'  Chesterfield appears to have had a passion for the\r\nunconventional, but he carried it to such an extent, and so\r\nsuccessfully, that it almost became conventional.  Brought up in the\r\nsociety of the Prince of Wales, afterwards George II., he discovered in\r\nmaturity that it is not wise to put faith in princes.  Chesterfield was\r\nthe prince's henchman in all his escapades, {147} and when Henrietta\r\nHoward, Countess of Suffolk, became the prince's mistress, Chesterfield\r\nwas the chosen friend of both.  This meant, of course, that the\r\nprincess, better known as Queen Caroline, exerted all her influence to\r\nbring about an estrangement between her husband and the earl, and she\r\nsucceeded, as she always was certain to do.\r\n\r\nChesterfield, however, was too powerful a man for even the King of\r\nEngland to ruin, and although George II., after the inevitable quarrel,\r\nsought to keep the earl out of public life, he had to agree to his\r\nnomination to the embassy at the Hague.  He was very popular there, but\r\nhis sojourn in Holland, while it is remembered by the Dutch by reason\r\nof the fortune Stanhope lost at cards, is only famous because it was at\r\nthe Hague that the English Ambassador made the acquaintance of\r\nMadamoiselle du Bouchet.  To the son that was born to them Chesterfield\r\naddressed his 'Letters.'  Returning to England impecunious but as\r\ndebonair as ever, Stanhope, nevertheless, realized that it was\r\nimperative that he should marry money.  The heiress of the day was\r\nPetronilla Melusina von der Schulenburg, the natural daughter of George\r\nI. by the notorious Duchess of Kendal, the heroine of Wood's halfpence.\r\nPetronilla, who was Countess of Walsingham in her own right, was not\r\nexactly a beauty, but she possessed a fortune of L50,000, and in\r\naddition an annuity of L3,000 payable out of the Irish treasury.  At\r\nthe time of her father's death in 1727, the countess was thirty-four\r\nand unmarried.  The king had kept her guarded jealously, and {148}\r\nGeorge II., mindful of the fact that if Lady Walsingham married, her\r\nhusband might make awkward inquiries about her estate, continued the\r\npolicy of his father.  Chesterfield, however, was not averse to\r\noffending George II.  There had been a great coolness between them, and\r\nthe earl must have realized that Queen Caroline would make it utterly\r\nimpossible for them to renew the friendship of early days.  He\r\ntherefore courted the countess, who was his senior by a year, and the\r\nreputed wittiest and handsomest man of his time had little difficulty\r\nin capturing the hand and fortune of the illegitimate daughter of his\r\nking's father.  They were married in 1733, unknown to King George, and\r\nwhen the inevitable discovery came, the king, though passionately\r\nangry, could do nothing beyond uttering threats.  The marriage was\r\nentirely one of convenience--Chesterfield wanted money; the countess\r\nrequired a deliverer from the thraldom of the court.  Cynically\r\nindifferent to the opinions of the world, they lived in separate\r\nhouses, but tried to humour Mrs. Grundy--who was born the day the\r\nserpent entered Eden--by taking houses next door to one another!\r\n\r\nHis monetary affairs freed from embarrassment, Chesterfield entered\r\nonce more into the life of the town, careless of the king's anger,\r\noblivious of the queen's spite.  When he had looked into his wife's\r\naffairs he sent George a bill for L40,000, due to her from the royal\r\nestate, and on the monarch ignoring the hint, the earl promptly began\r\nan action in the Courts for the recovery of the money.  {149} The king\r\neventually compromised by paying L20,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A political legacy]\r\n\r\nEven in the eighteenth century it was sometimes distinguished to act\r\nwith the minority, and Chesterfield adopted the now favourite modern\r\npose of championing the weak.  He railed at the Government, wrote\r\npamphlets against it, hired men of letters to aid him, and quickly\r\nbecame the leader of that ever-present body of men and women who are\r\ndissatisfied, and yet know not what they want.  He patronized Johnson\r\nand Pope and many others, the majority completely forgotten, and\r\nchiefly with their help and his own ready tongue attained the\r\ndistinction of being the most sought-after man in London society.\r\nWhatever Chesterfield did for pleasure, generally brought him gain, and\r\nit is only one of the many lucky incidents of his life that the Dowager\r\nDuchess of Marlborough should have left him L20,000 as a token of her\r\napproval of his opposition to the Government.  The legacy came in 1744,\r\nand at a time when Chesterfield's affairs were once more badly situated.\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Chesterfield's character and life have been the subject of\r\ninnumerable essays, but one incident forcibly illustrates the real\r\nweakness of the man who could afford to view with equanimity the bitter\r\nantagonism of his king and queen, and the animosity of the most\r\npowerful ministers of the day, and yet confess himself mortally wounded\r\nby a jest against him.  Like most great wits, Chesterfield had no sense\r\nof humour, and his witticisms were merely props {150} on which his\r\ngeneral pose rested.  One day he happened to be standing in the hall of\r\na coffee-house club in St. James's Street, when he overheard George\r\nSelwyn remark to an acquaintance, 'Here comes Joe Miller.'  This was\r\ntoo much for Chesterfield, and he struck his name off the club at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Earl of Chesterfield]\r\n\r\nHis appointment to the viceroyalty in 1745 was in the nature of a gift\r\nfrom the Government to the most dangerous dilettante of the day.  The\r\nking, however, point-blank refused to sign the commission, and there\r\nwere several stormy interviews between the king and his ministers\r\nbefore the former succumbed and declared 'his loving cousin and\r\ncounsellor' Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.  In Dublin the announcement of\r\nChesterfield's coming roused the greatest enthusiasm.  His wit, his\r\nmanners, his wealth, his influence and his handsome appearance were all\r\neagerly discussed.  Dublin society, anxious to learn from the leader of\r\nsociety, welcomed him with open arms, and so the man who had been\r\ninstructed that the Papists were dangerous and likely to become\r\nrebellious was able to write to London and glibly inform the Government\r\nthat there was only one dangerous Papist in Ireland, and her name was\r\nEleanor Ambrose, the daughter of a Dublin brewer, and the reigning\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of Chesterfield's viceroyalty gave every promise of a\r\nbrilliant and long reign at Dublin Castle.  He entertained freely and\r\nlavishly, and exhibited no scruples of refinement at meeting\r\nunofficially wealthy tradespeople or {151} successful lawyers.  The\r\nwomen, of course, loved him.  His reputation as the philosopher of\r\neverything that was delightfully wicked and depraved fascinated them,\r\nand Chesterfield maintained the pose with ease.  There was no one in\r\nDublin to call him Joe Miller, or to sneer at the somewhat second-hand,\r\nif not second-rate, wit that flowed from his tongue and pen.\r\n\r\nIn his serious moments he declared that the foe of Ireland was not\r\nPopery, but poverty, and he expressed his amazement that the Irish\r\nshould be content to live in a condition worse than the negro slaves.\r\nHe was viceroy for a very short time, but he gave one gift to\r\nDublin--Phoenix Park, for it was Lord Chesterfield who planted that\r\nrenowned demesne.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy was essentially a man of the world, but he did not relax\r\nthe strict etiquette of the viceregal court.  The wives of doctors and\r\nlawyers were not allowed within the precincts of the Castle, and great\r\ncare was taken to limit the _entree_ to the nobility and gentry.  The\r\ngood-natured Lady Chesterfield, during her occasional appearances in\r\nDublin, gained a sort of popularity, more pronounced among the trading\r\nclasses, whom she benefited by giving splendid balls at Dublin Castle,\r\nat which only costumes of Irish manufacture were worn.  It was\r\nsomething towards the debt she owed the Irish treasury.\r\n\r\nShe viewed her husband's amours with patience, and the fat and ugly old\r\nwoman even encouraged them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chesterfield and Miss Ambrose]\r\n\r\nTo Eleanor Ambrose he paid great attention, {152} carrying on an\r\nelaborate flirtation, with all Dublin as the audience.  Miss Ambrose,\r\nwhose reign preceded that of the Gunnings, played her part well, and\r\nthe brewer's daughter became the centre, if not the leader, of Dublin\r\nsociety.  Chesterfield wrote her verses and letters, and at Dublin\r\nCastle balls he always flattered her by his personal attentions.  Miss\r\nAmbrose, who subsequently became Lady Palmer, never forgot her brief\r\nacquaintance with Lord Chesterfield, and ever afterwards his portrait\r\nadorned her house.  When in the second decade of the nineteenth century\r\nLady Palmer died at her lodgings in Henry Street, Dublin,\r\nChesterfield's portrait hung in the most conspicuous place in her room.\r\nShe was then within two years of a hundred in age.\r\n\r\nOn April 23, 1746, Chesterfield departed from Ireland, having secured\r\nleave of absence, and although he promised to return, illness stepped\r\nin, and it was deemed advisable that the earl should not be exposed to\r\nthe damp climate of Ireland.  The king was only too pleased to nominate\r\nChesterfield's half-brother, William Stanhope, Earl of Harrington, to\r\nthe viceroyalty, and even permit the ex-viceroy to become Secretary of\r\nState for the northern provinces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earl of Harrington]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The spirit of nationalism]\r\n\r\nThe selection of Lord Harrington was received with great disfavour in\r\nDublin, where the formation of a national or patriotic party was almost\r\nan accomplished fact.  Harrington had the misfortune to be viceroy when\r\nCharles Lucas was beginning his great campaign against the corruption\r\n{153} that existed in official circles in Dublin.  Lucas, doctor and\r\nenthusiast, was a remarkable man.  He was the creator of the idea that\r\nIreland was a nation, and not the happy hunting-ground of Englishmen in\r\nsearch of pensions for themselves and their mistresses.  He attacked\r\nthe Dublin Corporation and all official Ireland, and, of course, the\r\nbureaucracy roused itself and crushed him for a time.  Harrington, the\r\nviceroy, took a leading part in the persecution of Lucas, and succeeded\r\nin driving him from the country.  Lucas did not return until 1761, but\r\nhis fearless exposure of corrupt officialdom had its full effects\r\nduring Harrington's tenure of office.  It did more than this, for it\r\naroused the latent intelligence of the masses, who began to think for\r\nthemselves.  They saw the best paid positions in the country\r\nmonopolized by Englishmen--in many cases the office-holders were\r\nilliterate--and they realized the monstrous injustice of the custom\r\nthat permitted the farming out of remunerative situations under the\r\nGovernment.  Parliament had to move in the matter, and for the first\r\ntime in the history of Ireland and England the viceroy and his Council\r\nhad to be careful, when making or selling fresh appointments, not to do\r\nit too openly.  Once Harrington was mobbed in the streets of Dublin\r\nbecause he was supposed to be in favour of the abolition of the Irish\r\nParliament--the latter consisting of a body of men bought body and soul\r\nby the English Government, though in some cases the price had not been\r\npaid.  These raised a protest against the exportation of salaries to\r\n{154} England for the use of men whose deputies did the work for\r\nstarvation wages in Dublin.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy fought with all the tenacity of the fanatic for the\r\nretention of the privileges of his class.  The new tone of the Irish\r\nParliament amazed, but did not frighten him; he ascribed their\r\nrebellion to a desire to play to the gallery, but when he discovered to\r\nhis cost that even the beggars and the blackguards of the city howled\r\ntheir execrations after him in the street, he became aware of the\r\npainful fact that the viceroy was no longer a law unto himself.\r\n\r\nLord Chesterfield had described the Irish Parliament in very severe\r\nterms.  'The House of Lords is a hospital for incurables,' he wrote,\r\n'but the Commons can hardly be described.  Session after session\r\npresents one unvaried waste of provincial imbecility.'\r\n\r\nThat this opinion was not the outcome of his English birth and training\r\nhe proved by his impartial judgments on other classes of Irishmen.\r\n\r\n'We have more clever men here in a nutshell,' he wrote from Dublin to a\r\nfriend in London, 'than can be produced in the whole circle of London.'\r\n\r\nLord Harrington's opinion of the Irish Parliament was even more\r\ncontemptuous than his brother's, and he affected at all times a\r\nsneering attitude towards the members of both houses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Gunning sisters]\r\n\r\nThe reigning beauties of his viceroyalty were the Gunning sisters.\r\nDuring Lord Chesterfield's term they had lingered in squalid poverty in\r\nan unfashionable part of Dublin, but being old enough to attend the\r\nviceregal functions of 1748, {155} they overcame the disadvantage of\r\npoverty by accepting from Sheridan, the theatrical manager, the loan of\r\nthe dresses they subsequently appeared in at the great ball given by\r\nthe viceroy in honour of the birthday of George II., October 30, 1748.\r\nLady Caroline Petersham, the viceroy's daughter-in-law, who acted as\r\nhostess for him, was greatly struck by the appearance of the Gunnings,\r\nand to her interest and that of Lord Harrington was due the first\r\nsuccess of the family.  The viceroy settled a pension of L150 per annum\r\non the girls' mother, and when they became Duchess of Hamilton and\r\nCountess of Coventry, they never forgot the generosity of their first\r\npatron.  The subsequent fame of the sisters was such that when, in\r\n1755, they paid a visit to Dublin, the viceroy, Lord Harrington, held a\r\nlevee in their honour.\r\n\r\nThroughout his residence in Ireland, Harrington continued to fight, and\r\nused every weapon, fair or foul, at his disposal.  Lucas, driven from\r\nIreland, was somewhere on the Continent, and several Irish members had\r\nbeen removed from the House by bribery and other methods.  Still, there\r\nwas no suffocating the voice of the people, and in the last month of\r\n1750 Lionel Sackville, Duke of Dorset, was given his second chance as\r\nViceroy of Ireland.  Harrington did not know whether to be pleased or\r\nnot at his removal.  He was anxious to rest from the struggle of Irish\r\npolitics, for he was not the man to create new measures or understand\r\nthe sentiments of a new order of things, but he was eager to beat the\r\nIrish, and to teach them the strength of his authority.  Dublin,\r\nhowever, was {156} in no two minds about its attitude towards the\r\ndeparting viceroy.  From the moment that the citizens knew of his\r\nrecall, they lighted bonfires to celebrate it, and held public meetings\r\nunder the walls of Dublin Castle, in the course of which the speakers\r\npublicly thanked God for having relieved Dublin of the plaguy presence\r\nof Harrington.  An attempt was made to secure a peaceful and\r\nunostentatious exit from the country, but the people would not be\r\ndenied, and at a hundred points along the route of his departure the\r\nex-viceroy witnessed the humiliating sight of bonfires and speakers\r\nalike proclaiming their joy at his departure.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, in remarkable contrast to Lord Chesterfield's brief and\r\nbrilliant reign.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peg Woffington]\r\n\r\nThe Dublin of Dorset's time was squalid, dirty, and disease-ridden.\r\nThe gentry were drinking themselves into penury; the city was crowded\r\nwith young bloods, who gambled, and drank, and called out each other to\r\ngive satisfaction on the famous duelling-ground of Phoenix Park.  Clubs\r\nof all sorts abounded, and were in reality drinking dens.  The most\r\nfamous of all, Daly's, was the headquarters of most of the notorious\r\ngamblers and debauchees of the metropolis.  Five theatres ministered to\r\nthe pleasures of the Court and people, and the leading actress was Peg\r\nWoffington, the mistress of the Provost of Trinity College.  Peg, as we\r\nall know, was a high-spirited woman, and full of a sparkling audacity\r\nthat often amounted to impertinence.  On one occasion, when the Duke of\r\nDorset was seated in the royal {157} box at the theatre, she saucily\r\nconcluded a recitation with the lines:\r\n\r\n  'Let others with as small pretentions\r\n  'Tease you for places or for pensions,\r\n  I scorn a pension or a place.\r\n  My sole design upon your grace--\r\n  The sum of my petition this--\r\n  I claim, my lord, an annual kiss.'\r\n\r\nThe verses were written by Dr. Andrews, the Provost, and caused great\r\noffence in the ranks of the fashionable ladies, who cut the actress for\r\na time.  Peg Woffington, however, did not suffer to any considerable\r\nextent as a result of her pert address to the viceroy.\r\n\r\nVirtue was not the duke's strong point.  Many have been the scrapes\r\nViceroys of Ireland have got themselves into, but the Duke of Dorset\r\nwas the only one whose conduct enabled an outraged husband to divorce\r\nhis wife.  The lady in the case was Mrs. La Touche, who declared that\r\nlove was the hereditary passion in her family.  A woman who could\r\nresist nothing was easy prey to the tenant of Dublin Castle.\r\n\r\nDorset had secured his reappointment by lavish promises.  He undertook\r\nto restore sanity to Ireland--meaning, of course, Dublin, for\r\nofficialism did not recognize the provinces--and he guaranteed to bring\r\nthe Irish Parliament to its senses.  In the circumstances Dorset had\r\nhis way, and in 1751 he re-entered Dublin.  He might have succeeded in\r\nscoring a personal triumph if he had not brought his youngest son, Lord\r\nGeorge Sackville, with him.  Hitherto it had been Dorset's policy to\r\nlet well alone--he did nothing particularly well, {158} and was popular\r\non that account.  Lord George Sackville, however, had neither the\r\ncomplacence nor the dignity of his father; he came as the viceroy's\r\nSecretary of State, his adviser, the man who saw that things were done.\r\nOne of his first acts was to quarrel with the Speaker of the Irish\r\nHouse of Commons.  This was Henry Boyle, afterwards Earl of Shannon.\r\nBoyle was an Irish Parliamentary Hampden, who jealously guarded the\r\nrights of his assembly and of the country.  Harrington had left\r\nParliament triumphant, and the House was not going to be brow-beaten by\r\nGeorge Sackville.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The struggle with Parliament]\r\n\r\nThe cause of the most important and vital dispute was a measure\r\ndisposing of the surplus revenues of the country.  Parliament declared\r\nthat it could dispose of them without the sanction of the king; the\r\nviceroy, through his Secretary of State, declared otherwise, and when\r\nthe House of Commons sent the bill for the viceroy's approval, he\r\ninserted a clause giving the king's permission to its establishment by\r\nlaw.  The assembly ignored the clause, and proceeded to other business.\r\nSackville and George Stone, the Primate, were furious.  They saw in\r\nthis act of insubordination the terrible spectacle of a free Parliament\r\nsitting day after day and publicly criticizing the privileged\r\nclass--the officials.  Acting under their advice, Dorset signed a\r\nwarrant for the Speaker's arrest, and an attempt was made to execute\r\nit.  But in order to get at the person of Boyle--who was the hero of\r\nthe hour--the officers would have had to arrest half the population of\r\nDublin.  Thousands {159} of persons of all classes followed the Speaker\r\nwherever he went, forming an unofficial bodyguard that soon so\r\nimpressed Sackville that the warrant was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the dispute between Parliament and the viceroy formed the\r\nsubject of all sorts and conditions of rumours.  Once it was reported\r\nthat the king had signed a decree abolishing the Irish Parliament, and\r\nsubstituting for it the attendance of so many Irish members in the\r\nEnglish Parliament.  There was no foundation for the rumour, but it was\r\nnot an hour old before a vast mob surrounded Dublin Castle, shouting\r\nlurid threats against the person of the viceroy.  One of the most\r\npopular theatres, owned by one of the most popular men--Sheridan, the\r\nfather of the famous dramatist--was wrecked because the leading\r\ncomedian would not repeat some lines which seemed to be slightly\r\nveiled, satirical references to the national dispute.\r\n\r\nBoyle was now master of the situation, the real ruler of the country.\r\nThe persecution of the Government had, as it often has done before,\r\nraised a man of mediocre ability to the pedestal of genius.\r\nSensational rumours began to reach England and astound the frequenters\r\nof the clubs and the coffee-houses.  It was reported that Dorset had\r\nbeen murdered and Boyle elected King of Ireland, and there were visions\r\nthat seemed like stern realities of the end of the English robbing of\r\nthe Irish till.  The ministry became alarmed, and when the Government\r\nrealized that Dorset was a menace to their authority in Dublin, {160}\r\nthey decided to recall him, and appoint Lord Hartington in his place.\r\nIt is said that when Dorset heard of this he burst into tears, and it\r\nis, indeed, extraordinary the passion this man had for the position of\r\nViceroy of Ireland.  He wrote letters to the king, humbly praying that\r\nhe might be allowed to return to the Government of Ireland as soon as\r\norder was restored, but in the long run he had to feign contentment\r\nwith the minor post of Master of the Horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{161}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nLord Hartington was the son of that Duke of Devonshire who had been\r\nviceroy for seven years, and was only thirty-five when his commission\r\nwas signed by the king.  Hartington appears to have been a typical\r\nCavendish; everybody trusted and admired him without forming too great\r\nan opinion of his abilities; but he was a safe man, and this attribute\r\nbrought him the premiership in November, 1756, when he was summoned\r\nfrom Dublin to take the control of the ministry.  Pitt, it is\r\ninteresting to note, served under him during his brief premiership--it\r\nended the following May--as Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nIn the reshuffling that followed, John Russell, fourth Duke of Bedford,\r\nwas appointed to Ireland.  His task was not a difficult one, because\r\nthe complete surrender of the English Government was known in Dublin,\r\nand Bedford was regarded as a sort of peacemaker, prepared to accept\r\nany terms, provided he was allowed to style himself viceroy.  The\r\nLord-Lieutenant and his wife lived in Dublin Castle and entertained.\r\nHitherto great English ladies had been content to view Dublin from a\r\ndistance, and were content to spend their husbands' earnings; but the\r\nDuchess of {162} Bedford had other ideals, and she did much to smooth\r\nher husband's path to power by her tact and graciousness.  She threw\r\nopen Dublin Castle to everybody, and showed by her own and her\r\nhusband's attention to the social side of Dublin life that their last\r\nconcern was with the political.  The duke announced a great programme\r\nof reform, which was to be carried out quietly.  He would not favour\r\neither political party in the State--there were now two parties,\r\nEnglish and Irish--and he endorsed cordially the recommendation of the\r\nParliament that these Englishmen who farmed out their appointments in\r\nDublin for less than the salaries they received should be recalled, and\r\nif they did not obey, dismissed from office.\r\n\r\nBut it was the magnificent state they maintained in Dublin that won the\r\nallegiance of Ireland.  Parasites feed even on imitation Courts, and\r\nincrease and multiply, while the not less important parasites--the\r\nbeggars of Dublin--were fed bountifully from the remains of Dives' many\r\ntables.  The duke and duchess spent more money in Ireland than they\r\ndrew from it, and remembering this, no patriot, however fervid his\r\nimagination, could accuse the Lord-Lieutenant and his wife of robbing\r\nthe State.  When the potato crop failed in many countries, the duke\r\nstarted a fund for the relief of the sufferers, heading it with a large\r\nsum of money.\r\n\r\nIt was a prosperous and a successful viceroyalty from the personal\r\npoint of view of the Duke of Bedford.  He did not make the country any\r\nbetter or introduce any great social reforms, but {163} it was a relief\r\nto have a man who did not plunder the treasury to provide annuities for\r\nhis poor relations, or satisfy the blackmailing propensities of his\r\ndiscarded mistresses.  Bedford was popular, and the duchess had Dublin\r\nsociety behind her to a woman.\r\n\r\nThe riots of 1759, created by the ever-prevalent rumour that the Irish\r\nParliament was to be abolished and a union between the legislatures of\r\nthe two countries accomplished, did not affect the viceroy's\r\npopularity.  The truth of the matter was that Ireland was not proud of\r\nits Parliament, even with the history of Henry Boyle fresh in the minds\r\nof the people.  The Parliament had been just as unscrupulous as the\r\nnumerous decadent and dishonest viceroys who had plundered the country,\r\nbut in the eyes of the nation the Parliament and the viceroyalty were\r\none and the same, the outward and visible sign of Ireland's importance.\r\nSociety followed the lead of the viceroy with dumb obedience, and\r\nsociety feared that it might cease to exist if the Parliament were\r\nabolished.  Those not in society were anxious to retain the Parliament\r\nbecause it meant prosperity of the capital.  It was a question of\r\nmoney, and of the jealousy of the citizens of Dublin for the continued\r\npre-eminence of their city.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earl of Halifax]\r\n\r\nTo the regret of nearly everybody, Bedford resigned the viceroyalty in\r\nMarch, 1761, and George Montague Dunk, second Earl of Halifax, took\r\nover the duties and emoluments of the high office.  Halifax, Nova\r\nScotia, commemorates the name of this nobleman, who was given the title\r\n{164} of 'Father of the Colonies' for his encouragement of colonial\r\nenterprise.  He was popular enough in Ireland, but he lacked the social\r\nbrilliance that distinguished the previous occupants of Dublin Castle.\r\n\r\nLord Halifax's career was one unbroken record of personal success.\r\nBorn in 1716, and educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, he\r\naffected a learning many of his contemporaries despised.  But Halifax\r\nhad to make his own way, for the family was poor, and only in political\r\nadvancement and a fortunate marriage did the prospect of fortune lie.\r\nHis marriage brought him the immense sum, for those days, of over\r\nL100,000, and in carrying off the wealthy heiress of the house of Dunk\r\nhe accomplished something several rivals failed in.  Halifax was\r\nimpecunious and pressed by creditors when he made the acquaintance of\r\nMiss Dunk, and she was by no means loath to become Countess of Halifax.\r\nA difficulty stood in the way, however, and that was the clause in the\r\nwill bequeathing her her fortune which stated that she would be\r\ndisinherited if she did not marry someone engaged in commercial\r\npursuits.  For some time there seemed to be no way out of the\r\ndifficulty--George Montague was not a commercial man; but at last some\r\ngenius suggested that the earl should join one of the London trading\r\ncompanies.  This he did, and won the hand of the lady, paying her the\r\ncompliment of adopting the name of Dunk, and conveniently hiding it\r\nunder his title.  It was a marriage of convenience that developed into\r\nlove on both sides, {165} and when the countess died, leaving two\r\nchildren, Halifax was greatly grieved.\r\n\r\nIn 1761, after thirteen years as President of the Board of Trade, he\r\nwas astonished to find himself appointed Viceroy of Ireland.  He had\r\nnot been a candidate for the post, but he accepted it with alacrity,\r\nfor by now the fortune of his late wife was almost gone, and the Board\r\nof Trade was not remunerative enough.  The salary of the viceroy was\r\nL12,000 a year, and there were many perquisites.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mary Ann Faulkner]\r\n\r\nThe newcomer was at the time of his elevation under the influence of a\r\nstrong-minded woman, Mary Ann Faulkner, the adopted daughter of the\r\nwell-known Dublin bookseller.  Halifax had found her starving in\r\nLondon, and, touched by a pathetic story of an early marriage and\r\ndesertion by the husband, he made her the governess of his two\r\nchildren.  This position she vacated to become his mistress, and when\r\nHalifax told her that he had been given the high office of\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland, she coolly informed him that she intended\r\nto go to Dublin with him.\r\n\r\nThe woman's position in Dublin was not without its humorous side.  The\r\nviceroy was under her thumb, and the mistress governed him with all the\r\njealous watchfulness of a shrewish wife.  She could not, of course,\r\nmaintain her state in Dublin Castle, but she resided within a\r\nconvenient distance of it, and by sheer force of personality the old\r\nDublin bookseller's daughter gathered about her a large and influential\r\ncourt.  Halifax was by disposition a spendthrift, but Mary Faulkner\r\n{166} was a miser.  She saved every penny, and nothing passed through\r\nher hands without leaving a profit in them.  Practically every post in\r\nthe gift of the viceroy was auctioned by Mary Faulkner, who kept the\r\nproceeds, and every day in the week her house was crowded with all\r\nsorts and conditions of place-seekers endeavouring to come to terms\r\nwith the most unscrupulous placemonger that ever lived in Dublin.  Here\r\nwas a clergyman offering to buy the vacant country deanery; there an\r\nofficer anxious for a sinecure in Dublin Castle; again, a lawyer\r\ndesirous of an official position in the law courts, or a doctor seeking\r\nthe patronage of those in high places.  Mary Ann Faulkner saw them all,\r\nand conducted her auctions with no attempt at privacy.  When it was\r\ngenerally known that the viceroy's mistress was the real power behind\r\nthe viceregal throne, Halifax found his levees deserted, and perhaps he\r\nwas not sorry.  He never disguised his admiration for the enterprising\r\nMary Ann, and if her position was something unconventional, there can\r\nbe no doubt of the fact that she held the unique record of being the\r\nonly woman who has directed and controlled the policy of a Viceroy of\r\nIreland.  And this without the public status or private authority of a\r\nwife!\r\n\r\nThe viceroy endeavoured to please everybody, and he earned general\r\nfavour by melodramatically declining to accept for himself an increase\r\nof L4,000 a year in the salary of the Lord-Lieutenant.  It fell to his\r\nlot to endorse the action of Parliament in raising the salary of the\r\npost to a higher {167} figure, but, anxious to prove his probity, he\r\ntook up a quixotic position--as it was, of course, regarded.\r\n\r\nTwo of his retinue are remembered for different reasons.  One was his\r\nSecretary of State, 'Single-Speech Hamilton,' and the other, Richard\r\nCumberland, the dramatist.  The latter was a particular friend of\r\nHalifax's, their friendship dating back from the viceroy's Cambridge\r\ndays, and continuing through his official life.  He gave Cumberland a\r\nposition at the Board of Trade, and, secured by this kindly act,\r\nCumberland was able to indulge in his fancy for playwriting.  He did\r\nnot approve of Mary Ann Faulkner, but as that lady was irresistible, he\r\nwisely decided not to provoke a conflict, and he was seen at her\r\nreceptions, and even helped her occasionally in her appointments.\r\n\r\nHalifax left Ireland in 1763, popular and respected, and George III.\r\ngave him the garter.  When in England he attempted to break away from\r\nhis mistress by entering into an engagement to marry a wealthy woman,\r\nbut Mary Ann soundly rated him when she heard of it, and he meekly\r\nbroke the engagement to please her.  This was the man who had ruled\r\nIreland!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A great Smithson]\r\n\r\nAs the result of royal favour the vacant viceroyalty was secured by\r\nHugh Percy, Earl of Northumberland, later to become the first duke of\r\nthe third creation.  Northumberland was a great Smithson, but an\r\nindifferent Percy, and it was only his wife's name and family that\r\ncarried him into London society and into the presence of George III.\r\n{168} A man of vast wealth, and wedded to a woman with a passion for\r\npower, the viceroyalty of Ireland was the position they both craved\r\nfor, and when powerful friends helped the Earl and Countess of\r\nNorthumberland towards their goal, they entered with zest and\r\nenthusiasm into the task of governing Ireland.  Lady Northumberland was\r\na lady of the bedchamber to the queen soon after her marriage, an\r\nappointment maliciously described by Lady Townshend as due to the fact\r\nthat the queen, who was ignorant of the English language, was anxious\r\nto learn the _vulgar_ tongue, Lady Northumberland, she declared, being\r\nthe most suitable person in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nDuring their two years' reign in Dublin Castle the viceroy and his wife\r\nentertained on a regal scale.  Their position had been a doubtful one\r\nin London, where society found it difficult to forget the old Smithson\r\nin the new Percy, but in Dublin the earl and countess led society\r\nwithout fear of any rivals.  The countess, more ambitious than proud,\r\nutilized her wealth to maintain her supremacy.  Dublin Castle was\r\nalmost daily the scene of a great party, command performances at the\r\ntheatres very common, and altogether the easily purchased homage of the\r\npeople was accepted greedily, and created a growing appetite for more.\r\nThen in 1765 Lord Northumberland was abruptly dismissed from office,\r\nand the Earl of Hertford appointed.  Returning to London in a passion,\r\nNorthumberland sought out the king and his ministers, demanding an\r\nexplanation.  The {169} 'explanation' took the shape of a dukedom, and\r\nboth husband and wife were content.\r\n\r\nLord Hertford soon tired of Dublin, and his wife induced him to seek an\r\nearly release from his distasteful task, and the home Government sent\r\nLord Townshend to replace him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A new era]\r\n\r\nThe appointment of George, first Marquis Townshend, to the viceroyalty\r\nmarked a new era in Irish history.  Ever since the days of the Duke of\r\nDorset's first term of office Dublin had been progressing.  The Irish\r\nParliament, though for the most part consisting of 'provincial\r\nimbeciles,' to use Chesterfield's words, was gradually attracting to it\r\nsome of the most gifted Irishmen, and London, which affected to despise\r\nit, was perturbed by the reports coming from the Irish capital.  One\r\nviceroy expressed his amazement at the wealth of genius in Dublin;\r\nanother confirmed it.  To convince the world, a great race of Irishmen\r\nwas arising.  Edmund Burke was a power in London; Grattan, a young man,\r\nwas renowned in his own circles in Dublin; Henry Flood, in the Irish\r\nHouse of Commons, was winning his reputation for eloquence; and a few\r\nyears later Richard Brinsley Sheridan was to gain fresh laurels for the\r\nname of Irishman.  Goldsmith was at his zenith when Townshend came to\r\nIreland in 1767.  Others whose names are now forgotten achieved the\r\nnot-to-be-despised if brief fame that talent is proud of and genius\r\ndespises.  Dublin was quickly losing its mean appearance.  An orgy of\r\nbuilding had transformed the districts now known as Grafton Street,\r\nSackville Street, {170} Merrion Square, and St. Stephen's Green.  In\r\nDame Street Trinity College and the Irish Houses of Parliament, the\r\nlatter having been built in 1729 on the site of Chichester House, gave\r\nthe thoroughfare an imposing appearance.\r\n\r\nBut the most important change lay in the people themselves.  The\r\nEnglish influence was, of course, paramount, and those who wished to be\r\nconsidered fashionable aped London manners, but slowly and surely there\r\nwas an awakening of the national spirit; the so-called English colony\r\nwas beginning to realize the danger of allowing themselves to be\r\nsubject to the caprices of a Government in London ignorant of Irish\r\naffairs.  They clamoured for legislative independence, and if their\r\nmotives were purely selfish and local, yet on the whole they benefited\r\nIreland.  Irish trade was being handicapped by English ministers\r\nanxious to gain the suffrages of the great trading towns of Bristol and\r\nLondon, and they attempted to impose restrictions on Ireland through\r\nthe medium of the Dublin Parliament.  But the descendants of the\r\nElizabethan and Cromwellian 'undertakers' would have none of it.  Their\r\nidea was that all Irish affairs should be under the control of the\r\nIrish Parliament because they were the Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe eloquence and statesmanship of Grattan and his great contemporaries\r\nhas gained a not undeserved fame for the Irish Parliament as it existed\r\nfrom 1760 to the Union, but in the fullest meaning of the word it was\r\nnever a Parliament, even in the sense that the mother of Parliaments\r\n{171} in London was falsely supposed to represent England.  The\r\nmajority of the Irish members were party hacks returned in their\r\nmaster's interests to vote without conscience.  Religion entered into\r\neverything, but in the sixties of the eighteenth century the problem\r\nthat confronted the English ministry was the position of the\r\n'undertakers.'  The latter were now the paramount power in Ireland;\r\nthey formed the ascendancy, and from their ranks came all the high\r\nofficers of state and the men who carried out the policy of England.\r\nBut time taught its lessons, and the Anglo-Irish ignored London--even\r\ndefied it--and when in 1767 Lord Townshend was sent to Dublin, it was\r\nwith the undisguised object of crushing the 'undertakers' and regaining\r\nfor England the chief authority in Ireland.  For the first time in the\r\nhistory of Ireland a _resident_ viceroy was appointed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Breaking the Irish Parliament]\r\n\r\nTownshend accepted the task with enthusiasm.  He was forty-three years\r\nof age, and had succeeded in achieving an unpopularity that provided\r\nhim with a vast amount of inspiration for lampoons and caricatures.  He\r\nnever cultivated friendship either in men or women, and he found his\r\nchief relaxation in vilifying his opponents.  He had fought under Wolfe\r\nat Quebec, and, the death of his superior having placed him in command,\r\nhe claimed the honours, declaring that his fertile mind inspired\r\nWolfe's plans and carried them into execution.  The man who did this\r\nwas capable of anything, and he was selected to break the power of the\r\nIrish Parliament.  Lord Bristol had failed {172} the ministry,\r\ndeclining the post on Lord Hertford's resignation, although he started\r\nfor Dublin.  When Bristol was informed that he would be expected to\r\nlive in the Irish capital, he threw up the appointment in disgust.  In\r\nthe circumstances Townshend's selection was a hurried one, but he had\r\nno scruples about anything, and was the man for an unscrupulous task.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{173}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nThe five years of Lord Townshend's viceroyalty were fruitful for\r\nIreland.  He might have adopted craftier methods and injured the\r\ncountry more than he did, but he openly pursued a stupid policy of\r\nbribery and spite: by the former gaining the adherence of the\r\nincompetent, and by the latter exasperating the men who in the end\r\ndefeated him.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Irish peers whom he was anxious to win over to his side was\r\na kinsman, Lord Loftus.  Loftus had some power in the Lords and in the\r\nCommons, and by reason of the viceroy's relationship to Lady Loftus he\r\ncounted upon dealing the Opposition party a heavy blow.  Lady Loftus,\r\nwith visions of a great social position for herself, fell in with\r\nTownshend's plans, though her husband was stubborn.  Then Lady\r\nTownshend died, and Lady Loftus had a fresh inspiration.  The viceroy\r\nwas a widower, and during his visits to Rathfarnham Castle had often\r\nnoticed pretty little Dorothea Munroe, her ladyship's niece.  Why\r\nshould she not marry the couple?  With her niece as the viceroy's wife\r\nLady Loftus would be the most powerful woman in Ireland, and the\r\nexchanging of a viscountess's coronet for a {174} countess's, or even a\r\nduchess's, would be accomplished easily.  From that moment she let\r\nTownshend know that the marriage of Dolly Munroe would be the price of\r\nher husband's allegiance, and the Lord-Lieutenant, cynical and daring,\r\nbegan to visit Rathfarnham Castle daily and flatter Dolly's hopes.  The\r\ngirl was only seventeen when Lady Townshend died in 1770, and the\r\nleading beauty of her time.  Henry Grattan was one of her admirers, but\r\nthe most favoured in a wide circle was Hercules Langrishe, afterwards\r\nthe Sir Hercules Langrishe who accepted L15,000 from Lord Castlereagh\r\nnot to vote against the Act of Union.  There is no doubt that Dolly\r\nwould have married Hercules Langrishe but for her aunt.  Perhaps she\r\nhad ambitions herself, and the prospect of reigning in Dublin Castle\r\ndazzled her mind and unbalanced her judgment.  Anyhow, she sent\r\nLangrishe about his business shortly after Lord Townshend had\r\nsuperintended the painting of her portrait by Angelica Kauffmann.\r\nEverything seemed favourable for a match, and Lady Loftus was hourly\r\nexpecting a proposal.\r\n\r\nIn her confidence in the viceroy's word she secured her husband's\r\nsupport for the Government in the House of Lords, but from the moment\r\nLord Loftus joined the viceroy's party Lord Townshend immediately\r\nceased his visits to Rathfarnham Castle, and all Dublin laughed at poor\r\nDolly.  She became the butt of every wit.  Lady Loftus grew desperate.\r\nShe believed that Townshend was actually in love with her niece, and in\r\nher anxiety she took Dolly with her to Dublin Castle, {175} and\r\npresented her to the viceroy.  He received them politely, but by now\r\nthere was no need even to act the lover, and Lady Loftus retired in a\r\nrage.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one more trick in Lady Loftus's repertoire, and she\r\ncaused the Dublin papers to print a notice to the effect that Dolly\r\nMunroe was going to marry the Right Honourable Thomas Andrews, Provost\r\nof Trinity College, Dublin.  Instead of exciting Townshend's chagrin\r\nand jealousy, it merely evoked a characteristic set of verses in which\r\nhe lampooned the aged Provost and congratulated him in a sneer on his\r\nconquest.  Andrews was what would be called nowadays a 'character,'\r\nmainly because he had none.  At one time Peg Woffington, the celebrated\r\nactress, had been his mistress, and he secured the provostship through\r\nher influence, for which he paid her L5,000.  When Dolly Munroe was a\r\ngirl Andrews was past seventy.  Lady Loftus could not have selected a\r\nmore absurd bridegroom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Famous Irish beauties]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lord Townshend was flirting with Anne Montgomery, one of the\r\nthree beautiful sisters.  Anne, strangely enough, was also brought up\r\nin Rathfarnham Castle, and was a niece of Lady Loftus, but it was on\r\nDolly Munroe that Lady Loftus showered all her affection.  Anne was\r\nexceedingly pretty, and generally accepted as Dolly's rival, and when\r\nLord Townshend was seen with Anne all Dublin became interested in the\r\nstruggle between the two to secure the great matrimonial prize.  The\r\nviceroy accepted the somewhat embarrassing position with nonchalance,\r\n{176} affecting unconsciousness of the current gossip of the day.\r\nEverywhere the chances of the fair candidates were canvassed, and every\r\nman of fashion in Dublin had his 'book' on the contest.  Huge sums were\r\nwagered by the respective partisans of Dolly and Anne as to which\r\nshould become Lady Townshend.  Dublin society had little else to do,\r\nfor the city was crowded with loafers in every rank of society.\r\nDinner-parties were the most popular form of entertaining, and the\r\nviceroy's matrimonial prospects were discussed at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marquis Townshend]\r\n\r\nThe viceroy did not permit these diversions to interfere with his\r\npolitical policy.  He poured out hundreds of thousands of pounds and\r\nalmost as many promises in his desperate efforts to secure the\r\ndestruction of the 'undertakers.'  No act was too unscrupulous or too\r\nmean for him to lend his name to, and to further his ends he made\r\nconfidants of some of the most disreputable and discreditable\r\nhangers-on in Dublin society.  No speech did not contain a sneer at the\r\nIrish nobility, which he affected to despise as something utterly false\r\nand unreal.  For the defence Flood, Grattan, and Langrishe united, and\r\nproduced the famous satire 'Baratariana.'  Townshend replied with\r\nspirit, writing his lampoon in a low-class tavern near the Castle.  He\r\nwas a frequent visitor to the old Dublin taverns, excusing himself on\r\nthe ground that they were better conducted and more hospitable than the\r\nIrish nobility.\r\n\r\nDublin Castle gradually became isolated, as Lord Townshend alienated\r\neverybody of position {177} and clung to drunken brawlers and servile\r\nfollowers of the lowest class.  The few levees were ludicrous affairs,\r\nand were soon abandoned.  Even the official class detested their chief,\r\nand when in 1772 sixteen Irish peers drew up a petition against him and\r\npresented it to the king and Government, the patience and good temper\r\nof everybody had been exhausted.  Townshend had not the decency to\r\nobserve the rules that bind every gentleman who mixes in good society,\r\nand he insulted women with the same ease as he insulted gentlemen.  To\r\nchallenge him was to be informed that the representative of the king\r\nwas privileged, and beyond that there was no appeal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Townshend's dismissal]\r\n\r\nThe peers' petition, however, resulted in Townshend's recall.  In\r\nitself the memorial would not have succeeded in causing the viceroy's\r\nremoval from office, but the ministry in London had received reports\r\nfrom secret agents in Dublin, and it was deemed advisable, if a\r\nrebellion was to be prevented, that the unpopular Townshend should be\r\nsuperseded.  Lord Harcourt was sent to replace him, and when the new\r\nviceroy arrived at three in the morning, he found his predecessor\r\nplaying cards with a couple of congenial ruffians.  With a half apology\r\nTownshend declared that at any rate Lord Harcourt had not caught him\r\nnapping!\r\n\r\nThe ex-viceroy was in no mood to leave Dublin, and with Harcourt's\r\npermission he remained in Dublin Castle for a fortnight, ostensibly\r\nwith the object of accepting some of the dozen challenges with which he\r\nhad been favoured before his dismissal.  But Townshend did not intend\r\nto {178} fight, and his real purpose must have been to make\r\narrangements for leaving the country with some show of dignity.\r\nRumours had reached him that an attempt would be made on his life.\r\nLater this was discounted to a plot for throwing him into the sea, and\r\nagain a circumstantial report of a proposal to make his carriage into a\r\nbonfire was circulated.  Townshend affected to discredit all these, but\r\nhe took the precaution of hiring a large body of roughs, whose duties\r\nwere to escort his carriage and to raise stage cheers all the way.\r\n\r\nThe hired mob did its duty and earned its money, but it was as nothing\r\nagainst the voices of thousands of persons who lined the streets of the\r\ncity and shouted their joy at the departure of the hated ex-viceroy.\r\nThere was no concerted attempt at violence, however, and Townshend was\r\nable to reach his ship in safety.\r\n\r\nAnne Montgomery was now the subject of many taunts.  The common people\r\njested about her openly, and her character was defamed.  Dublin society\r\nbegan to look askance at the pretty girl whose name had been coupled\r\nwith the notorious Townshend.  Naturally, her family was furious, and\r\nthe girl's brother, Captain Montgomery, a noted duellist, determined to\r\nbring the ex-viceroy to reason.  In hot haste he followed him to\r\nEngland, and before Townshend reached London Captain Montgomery had\r\novertaken him, and, literally at the point of the sword, compelled the\r\nviscount to send back a proposal of marriage to Anne.  There was no\r\ngreater coward in the world at the time, and so the self-styled hero of\r\nQuebec {179} meekly accepted Captain Montgomery's terms and, rather\r\nthan risk a duel, agreed to marry the girl.  In due course the marriage\r\ntook place, and L20,000 was won by those of Anne's admirers who had\r\nwagered on her becoming the second Lady Townshend.  Her rival, Dolly\r\nMunroe, eventually married a Mr. Richardson, the rejected Langrishe\r\nnever returning to her side.  Langrishe himself married and lived many\r\nyears, gaining a reputation for wit, the best specimen of which is his\r\nreply to the viceroy, who declared that Phoenix Park was a swamp,\r\nLangrishe retorting that his predecessors had been too busy draining\r\nthe rest of the kingdom to be able to pay any attention to the cause of\r\nhis Excellency's complaint.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extravagant society]\r\n\r\nThe viceroyalty of Lord Harcourt, which lasted from October, 1772, to\r\nthe last days of 1776, was distinguished for its social magnificence.\r\nThe Lord-Lieutenant was no politician, and he left that part of his\r\nwork to Lord de Blaquerie, his chief secretary.  He set the fashion for\r\ncostly entertainments until to be economical was to confess oneself a\r\nsocial failure.  Dozens of families of note, in their wild efforts to\r\nimitate the example of the viceroy, beggared themselves, spending in a\r\nfew years the income of a whole generation.  Thus the Lord-Lieutenant\r\nwould be invited to a great dinner and dance given on a most lavish and\r\nextravagant scale.  Within twenty-four hours the scene of the\r\nfestivities would be stripped of everything of value to pay for the\r\nprevious night's excesses.\r\n\r\nThere is a story told of an Irish gentleman who {180} had been\r\ncompelled to pawn every piece of family plate to meet the expenses of a\r\nvisit from the viceroy.  Of course, this misfortune was kept a profound\r\nsecret, and when Lord Harcourt intimated shortly afterwards that he\r\nwould like to be invited again, the would-be host was placed in a most\r\nembarrassing situation.  His mansion in Stephen's Green was well\r\nfurnished and staffed, but there was no plate, and, of course, he would\r\nnot think of refusing the honour of a visit from the king's\r\nrepresentative.  There was only one thing to do: the pawnbroker must be\r\ninduced to lend the plate for the occasion.  Now, it happened that the\r\npawnbroker was a man with social aspirations; his one ambition was to\r\nmix with the gentry, and as he possessed considerable wealth he had\r\nalmost as much assurance.  Finding that he would not lend the family\r\nplate, the viceroy's host had to make the pawnbroker one of his guests\r\nfor the occasion, and, being a sensible fellow, the tradesman enjoyed\r\ndiscreetly the novel experience without adding to the worries of his\r\npatron.\r\n\r\nThis is only one story of many, all illustrating the stupendous folly\r\nof the period.  Dublin literally danced, drank, and gambled itself into\r\npenury, whilst the Castle set, contemptuous and indifferent to public\r\nopinion, robbed and oppressed the country, and prepared the way for the\r\nghastly year of 1798.  Harcourt was indifferent, careless, and somewhat\r\ncontemptuous of Ireland and its affairs, and as his viceroyalty was\r\nmarked by numerous visits to England, he was never on the spot long\r\nenough to become conscious {181} of the defects and shortcomings of his\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The free trade question]\r\n\r\nIn 1775 Henry Grattan was elected to Parliament, and sat with Henry\r\nFlood, but Harcourt was replaced by the Earl of Buckinghamshire at the\r\ntime when these two Irishmen began their great campaign for the freedom\r\nof Irish trade.  England's policy had been to restrict Irish commercial\r\nenterprise, and only men of the calibre of Grattan and Flood could have\r\nsucceeded in compelling the Government to remove the embargo on Irish\r\ntrade.  Lord Buckinghamshire, who had been Ambassador to Russia,\r\ncarried out a policy of concessions, and he was able to give the royal\r\napproval to the bills for relieving Irish Dissenters from the\r\nsacramental test, and also grant some much-needed reforms in the\r\nfranchise.\r\n\r\nIt must have been during the viceroyalty of Lord Buckinghamshire that\r\nEnglish statesmen first thought of a legislative union with Ireland,\r\nfor the reforms initiated by the viceroy undoubtedly pointed that way,\r\nreading their history in view of subsequent events.  The rise of the\r\nIrish volunteer movement must have convinced the English Government\r\nthat if Ireland was permitted to have its own legislation much longer\r\nthe country would seek to break away from the monarchical union.  Lord\r\nBuckinghamshire, however, was never informed of the Government's\r\nintentions.  When he left in 1780, recalled by the Prime Minister, he\r\nwas succeeded by Frederick Howard, fifth Earl of Carlisle, one of the\r\ncommissioners {182} who had failed to conciliate the American rebels a\r\nfew years earlier.  Lord Carlisle was a typical product of his age,\r\nwhen to graduate as a statesman one had to be at school or university\r\nwith the reigning minister and have gambled one's way recklessly into\r\nfavour.  Every gentleman was a gambler, and Lord Carlisle was no\r\nexception to the rule.  Before his sudden desire to shine as a\r\npolitician he ruined himself at the card-tables, generously backing\r\nFox's debts of honour, and, of course, paying them.  It was the\r\ninfluence of Fox that led to his appointment to Ireland.\r\n\r\nLord Carlisle, with the easy assurance of a great nobleman whose\r\nposition was secure, took over the government of Ireland in the spirit\r\nof the dilettante.  The chief secretary, Sir William Eden, afterwards\r\nLord Auckland, supervised the more arduous work, while the viceroy and\r\nhis wife--a daughter of the Marquis of Stafford--gratified Dublin\r\nsociety by patronizing the card-table and the ballroom.  In 1781 the\r\npresent Viceregal Lodge was purchased for the use of the\r\nLord-Lieutenant.  Lord Carlisle's common sense, however, was not\r\nnullified by his native prejudice against Ireland.  He came to Dublin\r\nprepared to administer laws made in England, but it was not long before\r\nhe had to confess to his masters in London that it was utterly futile\r\nto attempt to govern Ireland by English-made laws.  This testimony from\r\na man whose honour was never doubted had enormous effect in winning for\r\nthe Irish Parliament the famous Declaration of Independence, though it\r\nwould not have been {183} accomplished had not men like Henry Grattan\r\nand Flood devoted themselves to it.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion in Ireland gave Grattan the full credit for the victory,\r\nand some enthusiastic patriots brought forward a resolution in the\r\nIrish House of Commons with the object of securing for Grattan and his\r\nheirs the viceregal desmesne in Phoenix Park.  This was very properly\r\nrejected, and nothing more was heard of the matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Volunteer movement]\r\n\r\nThe rise of the Irish Volunteer movement during the viceroyalty of Lord\r\nBuckinghamshire had created a new problem in Irish affairs.  The\r\nGovernment in London, not understanding the crisis, magnified the\r\nVolunteers into a national army preparing to drive the English into the\r\nsea, and successive viceroys, well aware that the army in Ireland was\r\nin a disorganized and undisciplined state, regarded the Volunteers with\r\na dismay their dignity compelled them to disguise.  For the time being\r\nHenry Grattan was a greater power than the Lord-Lieutenant, and\r\nwhenever the Irish statesman appeared at the Castle he was received\r\nwith a favour that plainly indicated the respect he had gained in\r\nofficial circles.  Grattan represented in his person the new Ireland.\r\nHe was not a patriot in the sense the word is used nowadays; he did not\r\nfight the battles of all Ireland or advocate principles for the benefit\r\nof the whole country.  He was the representative of the Anglo-Irish\r\nclass which had risen to place and power by reason of its English\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nWhen the Government in London realized that the descendants of the\r\nEnglish colony and the {184} 'undertakers' were becoming too powerful\r\nfor their masters, they made a determined effort to cripple them.  Lord\r\nTownshend's attempt was one of many, but fortunately for themselves the\r\nAnglo-Irish possessed in Grattan and Flood the two most powerful\r\nadvocates in Parliament.  Edmund Burke, having sought the more\r\nrespectable and more remunerative English Parliament for the display of\r\nhis talents, was driven to express his sympathies with the efforts of\r\nhis fellow-countrymen to secure an unhampered trade for Ireland.  This\r\ncost him his representation of Bristol, but the man who gave to mankind\r\nwhat was meant for Ireland might have done more for his native country\r\nand not diminished his political reputation.\r\n\r\nLord Carlisle admired Grattan, who, from a fashionable buck, had\r\ndeveloped with extraordinary facility into the statesman, and during\r\nhis occupancy of the post the Irish orator led the country.  The solid\r\nqualities of Flood were obscured by the brilliance of Grattan, and the\r\nsenior Parliamentarian had to give place to his youthful colleague.\r\nGrattan had the gift of social popularity, which Flood lacked.  In his\r\nyouthful days the famous orator was one of the most noted men about\r\ntown who seemed to overrun Dublin.  He was seen everywhere, and society\r\nladies, anxious to shine in amateur theatricals, always came to Grattan\r\nfor advice and specially written prologues.  Dolly Munroe obtained this\r\nservice of him, and when her reign as queen of beauty was over, and a\r\nnew star in Elizabeth la Touche {185} arose to dazzle Dublin, Grattan\r\nsupervised some private theatricals for the fair Elizabeth, and wrote a\r\nprologue for her to recite before the then viceroy.  Elizabeth\r\neventually became Countess of Lanesborough, and remained Grattan's\r\nfriend and supporter throughout her life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Carlisle's departure]\r\n\r\nLord Carlisle was highly esteemed in official and society circles in\r\nDublin, and there was genuine regret when, in April, 1782, the state of\r\nEnglish politics compelled him to place his resignation in the hands of\r\nthe Marquis of Rockingham, the Prime Minister.  The Irish Houses of\r\nParliament, in resolutions couched in the most generous language,\r\nthanked the departing viceroy for his services.  He acknowledged their\r\ngratitude gracefully, but did not convey his private opinion that the\r\nsooner the great farce of their posing as an Irish Parliament was ended\r\nthe better it would be for the country.  In later years he spoke\r\nseveral times in the House of Lords, advocating the legislative union\r\nwith Ireland, and his opinions must have been genuine, because the idea\r\nwas undoubtedly Pitt's, and we know that Carlisle was bitterly opposed\r\nto that great statesman on every possible occasion.\r\n\r\nLord Carlisle's later life does not belong to the history of Ireland,\r\nalthough he lived for twenty-four years after the Union, and always\r\ntook an interest in Irish affairs.  Apart from his viceroyalty, he is\r\nbest known as the guardian of his kinsman, Lord Byron, and the\r\ndedication of the second edition of 'Hours of Idleness' is only a\r\nreminder of the subsequent quarrel between the two noblemen.\r\n\r\n{186}\r\n\r\nThe successor to Carlisle was William Henry Cavendish-Bentinck, third\r\nDuke of Portland.  Born in 1738, he married when he was twenty-eight\r\nLady Dorothy Cavendish, a daughter of the fourth Duke of Devonshire,\r\nadding to his wealth and power by the union.  His appointment to\r\nIreland was most momentous for that country, although his term of\r\noffice began in April and ended the following September.  He had no\r\ngreat gifts of statesmanship, and owed his political advancement to his\r\nbirth and his friendship with Lord Rockingham, but his few months'\r\nexperience of Ireland imbued him with a passion for Irish affairs and\r\nan ambition to settle that disturbed country.  Portland, as Home\r\nSecretary from 1794 to 1801, had to deal with the Irish rebellion of\r\n1798 and the carrying of the Act of Union.  He worked very hard in both\r\ninstances, but it is only fair to his memory to record the fact that he\r\nwas opposed to the policy of bribery and corruption which terminated\r\nthe existence of the Irish Parliament, and he allowed Castlereagh to do\r\nthe dirty work.\r\n\r\nLittle is to be said of his brief administration as Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nIreland.  He arrived in Dublin with a large retinue, and opened his\r\nseason in Dublin Castle with a levee followed by a ball, where the\r\nofficial classes welcomed him because of his rank and birth.  Dublin\r\nloved a lord, but was passionately devoted to dukes, and had Portland\r\nremained in the metropolis he would have been successful, as all\r\nmediocrities are who possess sufficient good sense to let difficult\r\nproblems solve {187} themselves.  A sudden crisis in England, however,\r\nrecalled Portland from Ireland.  The Marquis of Rockingham had died\r\nsuddenly, and the king had appointed Lord Shelburne to the premiership.\r\nThis annoyed Fox, and he resigned, carrying Lord John Cavendish, the\r\nbrother-in-law of the viceroy, Burke, and Sheridan with him.  When he\r\nheard of this development, Portland added his resignation, and Lord\r\nShelburne, after a gallant attempt to defeat the malcontents, advised\r\nthe king that the only possible solution was the elevation of the Duke\r\nof Portland to the premiership.  It is an historical fact that when\r\ngreat men differ mediocrities come into their kingdoms, and Portland as\r\nPrime Minister was a figurehead.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Portland period]\r\n\r\nThere is no more fruitful period in the history of the world than that\r\nbounded by the years 1782 and 1809--years selected because they mark\r\nthe beginning of Portland's first ministry and the end of his second\r\nand last term of office--and yet he cannot be said to have done\r\nanything personally to enhance his reputation.  He had much of the\r\ndogged and dignified obstinacy of his class, and he made at least one\r\nattempt to introduce a code of honour into politics; but it was his\r\nmisfortune to have Castlereagh as a colleague, and that gentleman's\r\nlack of scruple was too much for his ducal friend.  The 'Cornwallis\r\nCorrespondence' gives a vivid picture of the vacillating nobleman,\r\nwhose feeble attempts to stem the vigorous and unscrupulous polity of\r\nLord Castlereagh might be humorous if they had not done so much harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{188}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nThe resignation of the Duke of Portland enabled Lord Shelburne to\r\nappoint his friend, Earl Temple, to the viceroyalty.  This was the\r\npremier's challenge to Fox and his followers, and was taken as evidence\r\nthat he meant to do without their aid.  Temple, although well aware\r\nthat his reign must be almost as short as his predecessor's, came to\r\nDublin, and did his best to gain the support of the official party for\r\nthe tottering ministry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Banquet given in Dublin Castle by Earl Temple to\r\ncelebrate his installation as Knight of St. Patrick]\r\n\r\nWithin a few months several Bills of importance were carried both in\r\nthe English and the Irish Parliaments, and as a sop for the nobility\r\nthe Order of St. Patrick was founded in the early months of 1783, the\r\nviceroy installing himself as grand master.  Previous to this Lord\r\nShelburne had been compelled to resign, and Temple's resignation\r\nfollowed as a matter of course, but he waited for the arrival of his\r\nsuccessor, Lord Northington, who was selected only after several\r\nnoblemen had rejected the overtures of the Coalition Ministry of the\r\nDuke of Portland.  Temple, created Marquis of Buckingham in 1784,\r\nconsistently opposed the Government, and he had his reward in 1787,\r\nwhen he returned to Ireland {189} on the sudden death of the viceroy,\r\nCharles Manners, Duke of Rutland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Volunteer Convention]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lord Northington's brief tenure of office was not without\r\nincident.  He discovered more about Irish affairs in less than twelve\r\nmonths in Dublin than he had learned in ten years in England.  A great\r\nVolunteer convention in the vicinity of the Castle augured a disturbing\r\ntime, but it passed off quietly enough, and the viceroy set about\r\nadvising his friend and political patron, Fox, of the real condition of\r\nthe country.  Fox was for a display of force; Northington, with the\r\nsuperior knowledge of the man on the spot, and able to gauge the temper\r\nof the Irish race, strongly urged a policy of conciliation.  More than\r\nonce he complained to Fox that the evils of absentee officialism were\r\nendangering the position of the Government in Ireland; and, unable to\r\ncope with this scandal because he had the whole of the official and\r\ngoverning classes against him, he turned to the more congenial task of\r\nencouraging Irish industries.  Out of his own resources he helped in\r\nthe promotion and development of the flax and tobacco trades, then in a\r\nvery feeble state.  Parliament, anxious to show its friendliness\r\ntowards Northington, increased his salary from L16,000 to L20,000 a\r\nyear, but he never benefited by the change--even if he desired to--for\r\nthe Coalition Ministry, defeated by the intrigues of the court party,\r\nwent out of office in the early part of 1784, and the Duke of Rutland,\r\na popular and wealthy nobleman, was selected to succeed him at Dublin.\r\n\r\n{190}\r\n\r\nIt was at first proposed to send Temple, now Marquis of Buckingham,\r\nback again, but the king had need of his services, and the appointment\r\nwas delayed for some three years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duke of Rutland]\r\n\r\nRutland was a close personal friend of the triumphant Pitt, and\r\nalthough only thirty years of age in 1784, was entrusted by his friend\r\nwith the momentous secret that the Home Government had in contemplation\r\nthe union of the two Parliaments.  Rutland's first move in Dublin was\r\nto sound carefully the leading officials and noblemen.  To his\r\nastonishment he found the most determined opposition everywhere.\r\nNobody would listen to the proposal, and the viceroy was compelled to\r\nlaugh the idea away, pretending that it was but an idle fancy of his\r\nown, and quite unimportant.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that Dublin should be unanimous against the\r\nproposal.  Its very existence depended upon the official classes.\r\nSeventy-five per cent. of the well-to-do drew their incomes from Dublin\r\nCastle; while the trades-people were for obvious reasons panic-stricken\r\nwhenever it was rumoured that the Parliament should be transferred to\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nRutland thereupon sought distraction in such pleasures as the capital\r\nafforded, and his wife seconded him.  Both were young and in possession\r\nof more than viceregal wealth, and they cut the road to popularity\r\nshort by a lavish expenditure.  The leading noblemen built themselves\r\nmansions, and the wealthy bourgeois followed suit.  Stephen's Green was\r\nthe favourite residential quarter, but Merrion Square threatened {191}\r\nto rival it.  Architects, artists, and builders from England and the\r\nContinent crowded Dublin, some of them to found families not without\r\nrenown in Irish annals, if bearing patronymics more suggestive of sunny\r\nItaly or France than their adopted country.  The professional classes\r\nwere rapidly rising in social status, and although the rule that\r\nprohibited the recognition of lawyers' and doctors' wives by the\r\nLord-Lieutenant and his consort were still in force, barristers and\r\nmedical men sometimes gained admission to unofficial festivities at the\r\nCastle.  The large garrison contributed its quota of officers to Dublin\r\nsociety, which at that time and for many years after the union\r\nrepresented all Ireland.  The Duke and Duchess of Rutland cultivated\r\nsociety in a manner that gained them immense personal popularity.  They\r\nled the fashions in the drawing-rooms and in the clubs, and the duke,\r\nwho dearly loved a good dinner, created a record for dining out never\r\nequalled by any subsequent viceroy.\r\n\r\nTired at last of the rollicking pleasures of the capital, the viceroy\r\ndecided to seek relaxation in a tour of Ireland.  He was strongly\r\nadvised by his council not to undertake the journey, but he was anxious\r\nto witness for himself the feudal state some of the nobility maintained\r\nin their country castles, and he carried out his resolve.  Accompanied\r\nby the duchess, he journeyed from place to place, staying whenever\r\npossible at the residences of well-disposed noblemen.  To mark their\r\nappreciation of his visit, the latter spent thousands of pounds\r\nentertaining the {192} viceroy and his wife, and the chroniclers of the\r\nday dwell with awe on the vast amount of food consumed by the viceregal\r\npair throughout their tour.  He must have undermined his constitution\r\nduring his Irish travels, for on his return to Dublin he was almost\r\nimmediately in the thrall of a fever, and, not being strong enough to\r\nresist it, expired suddenly at his residence in the Phoenix Park on\r\nOctober 24, 1787.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Duke of Rutland]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grattan and Dublin Castle]\r\n\r\nTo the intense annoyance of the Grattan party the Marquis of\r\nBuckingham, who as Earl Temple had been viceroy in 1782, came over in\r\nDecember as the result of the king's influence.  The question of the\r\nregency during George III.'s illness was acute in Dublin as in London,\r\nand the Irish Houses of Parliament, true to its reputation, rushed in\r\nwith a resolution requesting the Prince of Wales to assume the regency.\r\nThis motion the viceroy angrily declined to communicate to the\r\nGovernment or the prince, and Parliament thereupon censured him in\r\nexplicit language.  The sudden recovery of the king was a triumph for\r\nBuckingham's policy, and he dismissed his principal opponents in Dublin\r\nfrom office, utilizing the public funds to gain fresh adherents for his\r\nGovernment.  This action caused Grattan to enter an eloquent protest\r\nagainst the 'expensive genius' of the Marquis of Buckingham.  In vain\r\ndid the viceroy attempt to undermine the position Grattan held.  The\r\nmost popular Irishman of his time could set the viceroy and his\r\nsatellites at defiance, and all the money that could be filched from\r\nthe Irish treasury was insufficient to bring {193} about the downfall\r\nof the great orator.  Grattan was not received at Dublin Castle during\r\nBuckingham's viceroyalty, but from his place in Parliament he could\r\nthunder at the Lord-Lieutenant and even frighten the ministry in London.\r\n\r\nIn Walpole's 'Journals of George III.'s Reign' there is an unflattering\r\ndescription of Buckingham, which depicts him as a liar and a thief, and\r\nmore successful as the latter than the former.  Proud and stubborn as\r\nhe was, Buckingham was compelled to give way, and in September, 1789,\r\nto the great joy of the country, he announced his resignation.  He left\r\nimmediately, and dropped out of political life.  During a debate on the\r\nIrish situation in 1799 he followed the Earl of Carlisle--another\r\nex-viceroy--with a speech advocating the union with Ireland.  This was\r\na year after he had served in the rebellion of '98, commanding a\r\nregiment of Buckinghamshire militia in the country of which he never\r\nspoke without exhausting his powers of invective.\r\n\r\nThe task of naming the new viceroy fell to William Pitt, and, after\r\nconsidering the matter in conjunction with his own policy, he\r\nremembered his old fellow-student at Cambridge, John Fane, now tenth\r\nEarl of Westmoreland.  The post was offered to and accepted by the\r\nearl, and in January, 1790, he was nominated Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nIreland.  Eight years previously he had startled and scandalized\r\nsociety by making a runaway marriage with the daughter of Child, the\r\nbanker, and reputed to be the wealthiest heiress in the country.\r\nWestmoreland was a soldier and not {194} a statesman, but he gladly\r\naccepted Pitt's offer, and, disdainful of the growing power of the new\r\nIrish party, sought to govern the country from the point of view of the\r\nrough and courageous soldier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earl of Westmoreland]\r\n\r\nThe Irish Volunteer movement--a Protestant organization--had gained\r\nindependence for the Irish Parliament, and, incidentally, compelled\r\nEngland to grant certain measures of relief to the Catholics because,\r\nwith the Protestant community opposed to English misrule, it was\r\nnecessary for the predominant partner to curry favour with the\r\nCatholics.  Grattan, John Keogh, and other leaders, demanded complete\r\nCatholic emancipation, and the more sober-minded amongst the\r\nProtestants had come to realize that Ireland could not progress until\r\nthe Catholics were freed from the obnoxious penal laws even then in\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe first law of nature had compelled the rival religionists to join\r\nforces, so that when Lord Westmoreland arrived in Ireland he was faced\r\nwith the problem of dealing with a strong and united Irish party.  Some\r\nyears previously the Catholic Committee had been formed, and now, with\r\nLord Kenmare and John Keogh controlling it, the organization was the\r\nmost powerful in the country, with the notable exception of the Irish\r\nVolunteers.  Keogh was a remarkable man in every way.  A wealthy Dublin\r\ntradesman, he retired from business in order to fight the battle of\r\nCatholic Emancipation, and, although handicapped by internecine strife,\r\nsucceeded in gaining {195} the control of the Catholic Committee and\r\ndirecting its policy.  The viceroy contributed to Keogh's triumph by\r\ncontemptuously returning an address of welcome from the Catholic\r\nCommittee because it contained a hope that further relief would be\r\ngranted to Catholics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Irish Volunteers revived]\r\n\r\nThis act, which exasperated the moderate men, convinced the majority of\r\nthe Committee that Keogh's aggressive policy was the only one worth\r\nadopting.  Parliament had been declared independent of its English\r\nprototype, but everybody knew that it was wholly subject to the\r\nbureaucrats who reigned in Dublin Castle.  Simultaneously with the rise\r\nto prominence of John Keogh came the revivification of the Volunteers.\r\nSince their great victory of 1782 they had been allowed to degenerate\r\nand dwindle, but the success of the French Revolution was not without\r\nits influence on Irish affairs, and the years between 1789 and 1792\r\nwitnessed a revival on national lines.  Froude wrote eloquently of a\r\nBelfast Volunteer Review in 1791.  'The ceremonial commenced with a\r\nprocession.  The Volunteer companies, refilled to their old numbers,\r\nmarched past with banners and music.  A battery of cannon followed, and\r\nbehind the cannon a portrait of Mirabeau.  Then a gigantic triumphal\r\ncar, bearing a broad sheet of canvas, on which was painted the opening\r\nof the Bastille dungeons.  In the foreground was the wasted figure of\r\nthe prisoner who had been confined there thirty years.  In the near\r\ndistance the doors of the cells flung back, disclosing the skeletons of\r\ndead victims or living wretches writhing in chains {196} and torture.\r\nOn the reverse of the canvas Hibernia was seen reclining, one hand and\r\none foot in shackles, and a Volunteer artilleryman holding before her\r\neyes the radiant image of Liberty....  In the evening three hundred and\r\nfifty patriots sat down to dinner in the Linen Hall.  They drank to the\r\nKing of Ireland.  They drank to Washington, the ornament of mankind.\r\nThey drank to Grattan, Molyneux, Franklin, and Mirabeau--these last two\r\namidst applause that threatened to shake the building to the ground.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Struggle for Catholic relief]\r\n\r\nThe proposed co-operation of the Catholic Committee with the\r\nVolunteers, the latter being a Presbyterian organization, alarmed the\r\nviceroy and the ministers in London.  Westmoreland was advised to\r\nprevent the amalgamation of the forces by concessions to Catholics, and\r\neventually a measure, granting everything save the franchise to\r\nCatholics, was passed by the Irish Parliament.  The Castle influence,\r\nhowever, was too strong for John Keogh to win the vote for his\r\nfollowers, but it was something to gain for his fellow-religionists\r\nadmission to the magistracy, to the rank of King's Counsel, and to\r\nbecome solicitors and to open schools without the permission of the\r\nProtestant bishop.  Beyond that the Government would not go.  But the\r\ngreat Catholic Convention in 1792 won the vote for the majority,\r\nalthough Westmoreland and his secretary, Hobart, wrote imploring Pitt\r\nand Dundas not to give way to the importunities of the five\r\nCommissioners sent by the Catholic Convention to demand the franchise\r\nfrom the king.  The Commissioners convinced the {197} ministry that if\r\ntheir mission failed English rule in Ireland would be at an end, and\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant's advice was ignored.  In February, 1793, the Chief\r\nSecretary moved in Parliament the first reading of a Bill admitting\r\nCatholics to the parliamentary franchise, to the magistracy, to the\r\ngrand jury, to the municipal corporations, to Dublin University, and to\r\nseveral civil and military offices.  But an amendment proposing the\r\nadmission of Catholics to Parliament was defeated by 136 to 69 votes.\r\n\r\nLord Westmoreland was personally a fanatical opponent of Roman\r\nCatholicism, and the weakness of Pitt, as he termed it, made his\r\nposition in Dublin unbearable.  He would have resigned in 1792 but for\r\na certain vanity that made him unwilling to admit defeat.  Besides, he\r\nwas ever hoping that the natural passion for schism which permeates\r\nevery Irish politician would dissever the alliance of the Presbyterians\r\nwith the Catholic Committee.  In the North, while the Belfast\r\nVolunteers were welcoming with open arms the leaders of the Catholic\r\nmovement, and making fervid speeches about liberty of conscience, two\r\norganizations in adjacent villages were 'cutting one another's throats\r\nfor the love of God.'  The 'Defenders' was the name given to the Roman\r\nCatholic band, while the Presbyterians, or Orangemen, called themselves\r\n'Peep-o'-Day Boys.'  In September, 1795, when Camden was viceroy, the\r\ntwo factions came into conflict at a village called the 'Diamond,' and\r\nthe battle that followed takes its name from the scene of the contest.\r\nForty-eight Defenders were {198} killed, and to commemorate the victory\r\nthe first Orange lodge was founded.\r\n\r\nWestmoreland knew that there could be no genuine alliance between the\r\nCatholics and the Protestants, and so he clung to office; but Pitt,\r\nalarmed by the state of Europe and the isolation of England, was for\r\nfavouring the Catholics, and the viceroy, as one utterly at variance\r\nwith the Home Government, resigned.\r\n\r\nLord Westmoreland's term was purely a political one.  He came to\r\nIreland at a most critical period in its history, and, although little\r\nmore than thirty years of age, he showed a courage worthy of a man with\r\nbetter ideals.  He was not without his good qualities, and the Castle\r\nbureaucrats found in him a stanch friend.  He entertained lavishly, but\r\nthe death of Lady Westmoreland towards the close of 1793 abruptly ended\r\nthe gaieties of the Castle.  He lived until 1841, and held the post of\r\nLord Privy Seal from 1798 to 1827--a period covering nearly thirty\r\nyears and without precedent or example in the history of politics.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to recall that one of Lord Westmoreland's staff in\r\nDublin during the early years of his viceroyalty was a young officer\r\nnamed Arthur Wellesley.  While attending a ball at the Castle he made\r\nthe acquaintance of a girl of great beauty, Miss Catherine Pakenham, a\r\ndaughter of Lord Longford.  They became engaged almost immediately, but\r\nWellesley's family opposed the match, his mother, a haughty and severe\r\nwoman, being very prominent in the matter.  The future Iron Duke,\r\nhowever, maintained the {199} engagement, and when he was in India he\r\nkept up a regular correspondence with his fiancee.  During his absence\r\nshe was attacked by smallpox, and wrote to Wellesley releasing him, but\r\nhe refused to do so, and on April 10, 1806, they were married in the\r\nchurch of St. George, Dublin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A sensational viceroyalty]\r\n\r\nThe removal of Westmoreland, the friend of the Protestant minority, was\r\nfollowed by the brief but sensational viceroyalty of the second Earl\r\nFitzwilliam.  Pitt's avowed policy was to win the sympathies of the\r\nmajority, and Lord Fitzwilliam was considered the best man to give\r\neffect to the policy of the Government.  He was gazetted, therefore, to\r\nIreland in December, 1794, and a month later appeared in Dublin.  His\r\nwife was a daughter of the Earl of Bessborough, and both were very\r\npopular in Court circles.  Possessed of great wealth, it was thought\r\nthat Fitzwilliam would be the less independent of the support of the\r\nCastle bureaucracy, which was fighting with venom the battle for its\r\nexistence.  No sooner was Fitzwilliam in Dublin than he received\r\ninstructions to continue Westmoreland's policy.  But he had started the\r\nwork of reform before these reached him.  One morning Beresford, who\r\nhad married Barbara Montgomery, a sister of Lady Townshend, was\r\ndismissed from his post of Commissioner of the Customs; Toler,\r\nAttorney-General--afterwards the notorious Lord Norbury--Wolfe, the\r\nSolicitor-General, and Cooke, the Military Secretary, also received\r\nnotice that their services were no longer required.  The Castle people\r\nwere panic-stricken; their occupations seemed to be {200} gone, but\r\neven Fitzwilliam, with all the prestige of great birth and wealth,\r\ncould not overwhelm the bureaucracy.  Beresford appealed to Pitt and\r\nthe king, and within a few days the dismissed officers were all\r\nreinstated.  This was too much for the viceroy, and on March 25, 1795,\r\nhe left Ireland, to the accompaniment of a demonstration of mourning\r\nabsolutely unique in the history of the country.  Dublin proclaimed it\r\na day of humiliation; all the shops were closed, and the citizens lined\r\nthe streets.  Grattan gave voice to the general regret, and fiercely\r\ndenounced the treachery of Pitt, who had assured him that Lord\r\nFitzwilliam was to adopt an essentially Catholic policy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earl Fitzwilliam]\r\n\r\nIn the circumstances the strongest of men might have hesitated before\r\nundertaking the ominous task of carrying on the Government.\r\nUnfortunately, there was a total ignorance of Ireland and its affairs\r\namongst the English nobility, and when Lord Camden was offered the post\r\nhe accepted it without demur, and confidently travelled to the Irish\r\nmetropolis.  Ireland knew nothing of the viceroy, and certainly the\r\nlatter knew even less of the country he was called upon to rule.  He\r\nwas thirty-six years of age, but possessed all the pompous prejudices\r\nof a man twice his age.  On his coming of age he had been appointed\r\nTeller of the Exchequer, and held it for sixty years--1780 to\r\n1840--though after drawing about three-quarters of a million sterling\r\nfrom the Treasury, he 'patriotically' consented in 1812 to forego the\r\nincome of the office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{201}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nThe new viceroy was received in sullen silence on the day of his\r\narrival in Dublin, but when Lord Clare, the Chancellor, was returning\r\nafter swearing in the Lord-Lieutenant, he was attacked by a frenzied\r\nmob which sought to lynch him on the lamp-post outside his own house.\r\nBeresford had taken the precaution to fill the approaches to the\r\nCustom-house with soldiers, and so escaped, but the residences of all\r\nthe principal loyalists in Dublin were stoned, and for several days mob\r\nlaw was supreme.\r\n\r\nCamden, however, determined to show that he was uninfluenced by\r\nintimidation.  He was not a courageous person, but he knew that the\r\nEnglish garrison was strong and that there could be no treachery within\r\nDublin Castle, where everybody had been bought body and soul by the\r\nGovernment.  Pitt had advised him to adopt a strong anti-Catholic\r\npolicy, and he carried out his instructions only too well.  It is\r\nsignificant of the attitude and position of the Catholic priesthood\r\nthat the viceroy could be anti-Catholic and yet in a position to lay\r\nthe foundation-stone of Maynooth College.  This was an open bribe to\r\nthe clergy, and an intimation of favours to come if the {202}\r\npriesthood supported the policy of Pitt and the viceroy.\r\n\r\nLord Castlereagh and the Duke of Portland--the latter as Home Secretary\r\nhaving charge of Irish affairs--had almost carried into execution their\r\nplan of endowing the Roman Catholic Church with English money, and\r\nthereby securing its allegiance and support for ever; but even the\r\naudacious Castlereagh hesitated for fear of the English Established\r\nChurch, and it was decided to substitute Maynooth and an endowment for\r\nthe original plan.\r\n\r\nCamden's aggressiveness was matched by the determination of his\r\nopponents.  The United Irishmen threw over their policy of 'peaceful\r\npersuasion,' and inspired by Wolfe Tone, became a rebellious\r\norganization.  Tone went to America, and from there to France.  The\r\nresult was the abortive expedition under Hoche and Grouchy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The United Irishmen]\r\n\r\nCamden was not idle.  He quickly discovered that there are always\r\nplenty of traitors in Ireland, and he bought them up by the score.  The\r\nnews of Lord Edward Fitzgerald's adherence to the rebel cause was\r\ndisconcerting, but Fitzgerald had friends, and these the viceroy\r\npurchased.  A similar policy was adopted in the case of every one of\r\nthe rebel leaders, and every hero had his bodyguard of traitors.  The\r\nGovernment had merely to wait for the right moment to strike a decisive\r\nblow.  Castle money was never more plentiful than in the two years\r\npreceding the egregious rebellion of '98.  Many patriots who screamed\r\nfor independence lost their voices at {203} the first sight of\r\nviceregal gold; the old bucks, penniless as the result of their early\r\nfollies, found in the profession of traitor an easy escape from the\r\ndemon Work; briefless barristers, and even successful ones, were drawn\r\ninto the Castle circle until the viceroy could say with reason that he\r\nhad bought practically every man of position or influence in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nDespite this, however, Camden felt alarmed at the progress the rebel\r\ncause was making.  It was no longer a purely Catholic movement, and the\r\nknowledge that wealthy Protestant merchants were joining the United\r\nIrishmen convinced the Viceroy that, although he could arrest the\r\nleaders whenever he wished, yet there would be an army of rebels left\r\nwhich might prove difficult to overcome.  Lady Camden urged him to\r\nresign, and save the lives of their children and themselves.  She and\r\nher family existed in a state of siege; there was little entertaining,\r\nfor no man trusted his neighbour, and in every street beggar the\r\nGovernment saw an embryo assassin.  Camden, with the disturbing\r\nconscience of the self-confessed coward, was compelled to act the\r\nbully.  He would not go in the guise of a frightened and defeated\r\nviceroy.  Then someone suggested that as the country was under arms it\r\nwould be better if the viceroy happened to be a soldier.  Camden seized\r\nupon this pretext, and wrote to London offering to resign in favour of\r\nLord Cornwallis, who, as one who had been Governor-General of India and\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the troops, was the most experienced man for the\r\npost.  Cornwallis {204} was not inclined to come to Ireland, though as\r\na soldier he intimated to the Government that he was bound to obey any\r\norders given him in that capacity.  Camden, therefore, remained on, and\r\nthe long-expected rebellion broke out.  But the viceroy was not\r\nunprepared, and before the day arrived for the great blow to be struck\r\nby a united and concerted action of the rebels every one of the leaders\r\nwas in gaol and scores of traitors were holding out their hands for\r\npayment.  News of the successes in the field of the leaderless rebels\r\ncreated a panic, and Camden increased it by despatching his wife and\r\nchildren to England.  The Orangemen demonstrated feebly, but they\r\nformed a small minority, and, although they had been very prominent\r\nsince the rejection of the Catholic Bill in 1795, they were of no\r\nimportance or use in the crisis.  Camden implored Pitt to send more\r\ntroops, or Ireland would be lost for ever.  The English statesman\r\nreplied that there were eighty thousand men in the country already, and\r\ngave him Sir Ralph Abercromby to command them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marquis Camden]\r\n\r\nAbercromby resigned in disgust, and General Lake was sent to replace\r\nhim, and to this officer fell the task of dealing with the straggling\r\nbodies of rebels who were maintaining a 'sort of rebellion.'  Shortly\r\nafter the arrest of the rebel leaders Camden had made way for Lord\r\nCornwallis, and returned home.  The ex-viceroy was consulted by\r\nPortland, who had disapproved of his policy, and Camden declared that\r\nthe only solution of the problem was the union of the two Parliaments.\r\n{205} While Ireland had a Parliament of its own--however\r\nunrepresentative--it would crave for its natural corollary, a native\r\nGovernment.  But even a Camden could learn by experience, and in 1829\r\nhe voted in favour of Catholic Emancipation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Marquis Cornwallis]\r\n\r\nIt was admitted in London that the rebellion of '98 was at an end, so\r\nfar as its effectiveness was concerned, before Camden resigned, and the\r\nappointment of Lord Cornwallis was inspired by Pitt's dread that the\r\nshortly-to-be-introduced Act of Union would lead to further trouble.\r\nCornwallis was a soldier and a statesman.  He was sixty years of age,\r\nand had led a very full life in India, America, and England.  One of\r\nthe few far-seeing persons who had declaimed against the unjust\r\ntaxation which lost the States of America, he nevertheless obeyed the\r\ncall of duty, and fought in the War of Independence.  His surrender at\r\nYorktown marked the beginning of the independence of the American\r\nColonies.  His greatest and most prosperous years were spent in India,\r\nand it was as the successful Indian administrator and soldier that he\r\nwas despatched to Ireland to prepare the country for Pitt's proposals.\r\nHe found that there was plenty of work left over from the Camden era,\r\nand his first six months consisted of hangings and murders.  With a\r\ncourage worthy of a better cause the peasantry were fighting the\r\nImperial troops, but there could be only one end to such an unequal\r\ncontest, and the soldiery enjoyed themselves after their kind.  The\r\nDublin executive was busily employed reaping the {206} first-fruits of\r\nCamden's bribery; Lord Edward Fitzgerald was captured, the last of the\r\n'98 leaders.\r\n\r\nThe history of Ireland must have a strong influence on men's hearts,\r\nfor nobody can speak or write of it without exhibiting the feelings of\r\nthe partisan.  The unstudied inaccuracies of the phlegmatic Froude show\r\nthat historian to be capable of emotion when dealing with Irish\r\naffairs.  Froude had no sense of humour, and, therefore, no sense of\r\nproportion, and his detestation of the Celtic temperament caused his\r\nprejudices to run riot in his pages on Ireland.  On the other side are\r\nthe painfully sincere patriots whose efforts to divide humanity into\r\nsheep and goats wrong both parties.  Perhaps one of these days it will\r\nbe agreed that any event more than fifty years old shall be considered\r\noutside party politics.  As it is, the rebellion of '98 is a subject\r\nstrong enough to-day to arouse as much passion as the latest proposal\r\nof a vote-bidding Government, Conservative or Liberal.\r\n\r\nIt would be as easy as it is tempting to dwell upon the doings of the\r\nyear 1798, but the 'rebellion' has its own historians.  One example of\r\nCastle methods must be given.  Among the lawyers who enjoyed a more or\r\nless fashionable practice was a man named McNally.  He was friendly\r\nwith the leading patriots and also with the Government, and he approved\r\nin a purely intellectual manner of the rebellion.  When, therefore, a\r\nbatch of important rebels were in need of a barrister to defend them,\r\nthey sent for McNally, and as their counsel he was told everything,\r\n{207} including certain information which the wily lawyer knew would be\r\nof immense value to the Government.  This was his opportunity, and he\r\nnever hesitated.  To the Castle he went, and sold his clients for a\r\nlife-pension of L300 a year.  But this was a venial sin compared with\r\nsome others which could be cited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Act of Union introduced]\r\n\r\nThe surrender of General Humbert to Cornwallis marked the termination\r\nof the rebellion, and, in the opinion of Pitt and Portland, the Home\r\nSecretary, the most favourable time had arrived for the introduction of\r\nthe Act of Union.  In November, 1798, the duke sent to Cornwallis the\r\nfirst articles of the Bill.  These were introduced into the House of\r\nCommons in Dublin in the certain hope that they would be accepted.  To\r\nthe astonishment and dismay of the executive, the Bill was rejected by\r\n107 votes to 105.  Castlereagh was furious; Cornwallis indifferent.\r\nBoth men advised Catholic Emancipation as the price for Parliamentary\r\nsurrender, but the Government was averse to placing the majority in\r\npower.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved to return to the old methods, the methods that had\r\nalways proved effective when dealing with the Irish aristocracy and\r\nruling class.  Castlereagh was given a free hand, and places, pelf, and\r\npeerages were promised with reckless lavishness.  There was a rush to\r\nbe first in the field of favours, but Castlereagh was so ready to\r\npromise anything that the bribed became suspicious.  The English\r\nGovernment in Ireland had a reputation for treachery that was not\r\nundeserved, and the place and peerage seekers went {208} to Cornwallis\r\nto seek endorsement of Castlereagh's offers.  The viceroy gave his\r\npersonal guarantee that they would be fulfilled, and, satisfied with\r\nthis, the ready-made majority went to the Commons, and with a force\r\nnumbering one hundred and fifty-three persons overwhelmed the\r\nopposition of eighty-eight.  Many of the latter had refused heavy\r\nbribes; as many had endangered their political lives.\r\n\r\nThe Union accomplished, the Duke of Portland endeavoured to postpone,\r\nwith an ultimate view to cancellation, the bestowal of the promised\r\npeerages and the payment of the monetary bribes, and only the\r\nthreatened resignation of Cornwallis brought about the fulfilment of\r\nthe Government's side of the bargain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Society after the Union]\r\n\r\nThe new nobility were received with derision in England and Ireland,\r\nand the wits of the day satirized them unmercifully.  There is a story\r\ntold of John Philpot Curran, who had gained the admiration of the\r\npatriotic party by his fearless advocacy of the '98 rebels in the law\r\ncourts.  The famous wit was accosted by one of the new peers outside\r\nthe defunct Irish Parliament in College Green with the query as to the\r\nintention of the Government with regard to the empty building, adding,\r\n'For my part, I hate even the sight of it.'  'I do not wonder,'\r\nretorted Curran, 'I never yet heard of a murderer who was not afraid of\r\na ghost.'  Curran had been a bitter opponent of the Union, and had\r\nproved himself incorruptible.\r\n\r\nWhatever its political effect, the closing of the Irish Parliament was\r\na blow to the prestige of {209} Dublin as the metropolis.  The\r\nviceroyalty remained, but it was shorn of some of its glory.  With the\r\ndeath of the Irish House of Commons and the admittance of Irish peers\r\nto the English House of Lords, there was no longer any need for the\r\nnative nobility to maintain expensive houses in Dublin.  London became\r\ntheir centre, and they made their country houses their headquarters\r\nwhile in Ireland.  Gradually the social power fell into the hands of\r\nthe professional classes and the higher-grade civil servants; doctors,\r\nlawyers, officers in the army, and others of the professions dominated\r\nDublin society.  The viceroy's court saw less of the aristocracy, and\r\nthe levees degenerated into a meeting-place for those of doubtful\r\npedigrees or persons anxious to make new ones.  Merrion Square and St.\r\nStephen's Green attracted wealthy barristers and doctors, and\r\nprosperous tradespeople moved from the 'other side of the bridge' to\r\nthe desirable regions surrounding Merrion Square.  Knighthoods and\r\nbaronetcies were given to doctors and lawyers, and the wives of the men\r\nwho could not have been 'received' at the viceregal court previous to\r\nthe union were now the leaders of fashion and frequenters of the Castle\r\nand the Lodge.\r\n\r\nThe energetic viceroy meanwhile pressed for Catholic emancipation,\r\nwhich he declared would save Ireland from self-destruction.  The state\r\nof the country was pitiable, and Dublin looked all the more wretched\r\nand squalid by reason of its patches of gaiety and wealth.  Trade was\r\nstagnant and education at a standstill.  Almost every viceroy {210} had\r\nto contribute to funds for starving peasantry.  Cornwallis was not\r\ndeceived by the carelessness of his immediate circle.  He protested\r\nagain and again against the laxity of the Government, and called aloud\r\nfor the emancipation of the Catholics.  He was informed that the\r\nGovernment dared not bring in such a Bill, for it would be thrown out\r\ninstantly, and when they wished to commit political suicide the\r\nministers would follow the viceroy's advice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marquis Cornwallis]\r\n\r\nTired and disgusted, Cornwallis resigned in February, 1801, and in May\r\ntook his departure.  In 1805 he died in India, two years after he had,\r\nas the English plenipotentiary, signed the disastrous Treaty of Amiens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord and Lady Hardwicke]\r\n\r\nPitt having been replaced by Addington, the new premier sent Lord\r\nHardwicke to Dublin.  The earl was the eldest son of Lord Chancellor\r\nYorke, and being of a genial and easy-going disposition, it was thought\r\nthat he would eradicate, with the assistance of his wife, the\r\nill-feeling caused by the union.  Lady Hardwicke certainly did her\r\nbest, and cultivated every class of Dublin society.  The Castle for the\r\ntime being lost its sinister political reputation, and for five years\r\nit remained the centre of the social life of the city.  There was much\r\nbeauty and talent in Dublin, and the name of Irishman had gained\r\nsomething by the exploits of the sons of the late Earl of Mornington.\r\nBurke and Goldsmith had passed away, but Sheridan, Grattan, Curran,\r\nKeogh, and many others remained.  The Lord-Lieutenant dearly loved a\r\ngood story and a good dinner, and he {211} surrounded himself with all\r\nthe leading wits of the day.  The personality of John Philpot Curran\r\ndominated the Irish bar, and his refusal to defend Robert Emmet\r\nscarcely affected his popularity with the patriotic party.  The attempt\r\non the part of Emmet to start a new rebellion failed miserably, and did\r\nnot disturb the equanimity of Hardwicke.  He continued his policy of\r\ndoing nothing and doing it well.  The viceregal etiquette that had\r\nprevailed for hundreds of years was relaxed somewhat, and Dublin began\r\nto realize that the reign of the official gang was nearly finished.\r\nHitherto Castle functions had been for the few; now they were for the\r\nmany.  The personal charm of Lady Hardwicke lessened the difficulties\r\nof the viceroyalty, and when, in May, 1804, it was announced that Lord\r\nPowis was to replace Hardwicke, there was great regret in Dublin.\r\nFortunately, Powis would not come to Ireland, and the viceroy and his\r\nwife remained until the early part of 1806, when John Russell, sixth\r\nDuke of Bedford, was sent to govern the country under the auspices of\r\nthe Ministry of All the Talents.\r\n\r\nThe duke was no politician, and fourteen years in the House of Commons\r\nhad given him a profound dislike for public life.  It was only at the\r\nearnest solicitation of the Prime Minister, Grenville, that he accepted\r\nthe post of Viceroy of Ireland, and when the Duke of Portland began his\r\nsecond ministry Bedford gladly vacated Dublin Castle.  It was an\r\nundistinguished year in Irish affairs, but it is worth noting that\r\namongst the duke's family at the time was a boy of fourteen, {212} who,\r\nas Lord John Russell, had in later years a great deal to do with Irish\r\naffairs.  He was at the head of the Government when the Irish famine of\r\n1847-48 ravaged the country, and it was to Russell that Gladstone owed\r\nhis first acquaintance with Irish life.  He never had a very flattering\r\nopinion of the viceroyalty, regarding it as a useless encumbrance now\r\nthat the country was controlled from London, and more than once he\r\npressed upon his Cabinet colleagues a proposal for its abolition and\r\nthe substitution for it of a Secretary of State for Ireland, ranking\r\nwith the Home Secretary and conducting all Irish business.  His father\r\nretired into private life after leaving Dublin, and earned the\r\ngratitude of subsequent holders of the dukedom by building Covent\r\nGarden at a cost of L40,000 and otherwise improving the great Russell\r\nestates.  Agriculture also owes a great deal to the sixth Duke of\r\nBedford, who was one of the first to cultivate the subject\r\nscientifically, and for many years of his life he was Vice-President of\r\nthe Agricultural Society, which he helped to found and guide into\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nAlthough Catholic Emancipation was very much to the fore now, and the\r\nspeeches of Catholic orators were embarrassing the Government, it was\r\nnot considered essential that the Lord-Lieutenant should be something\r\nmore than a man of fashion.  Dukes were plentiful, and to succeed\r\nBedford, another one in the person of Charles Lennox, fourth Duke of\r\nRichmond and Lennox, was chosen.  The Duke of Richmond was forty-three\r\nyears of age, and had gained the {213} reputation of a sportsman.  He\r\nwas a keen cricketer and a patron of the 'noble art' of boxing.  In his\r\nearly years he had distinguished himself in a duel with the Duke of\r\nYork, and altogether was a typical man of the world, to whom the world\r\nwas very kind.  He was assured that the Government of Ireland was a\r\nsimple matter--no work to do and plenty of opportunities for\r\ncultivating those social arts so dear to him and to his duchess, who\r\nwas a sister of the outgoing viceroy's wife, the Duchess of Bedford.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colonel Arthur Wellesley]\r\n\r\nRichmond was given as his chief secretary Colonel Arthur Wellesley, a\r\nman who would perform any work there was to do.  In the circumstances\r\nthe duke and duchess crossed over and inaugurated their reign with a\r\nbrilliant ball which foreshadowed a very gay time for the metropolis.\r\nThe viceroy was not interested in Catholic Emancipation or in any of\r\nthe subjects that intimately concerned the country he was supposed to\r\ngovern, but, to his great annoyance, Colonel Wellesley, in his anxiety\r\nto obtain further military service, neglected Ireland, and spent much\r\nof his time in London interviewing responsible ministers.  Richmond\r\ncomplained of his chief secretary's neglect, but Wellesley excused\r\nhimself by pointing out that his civil appointment had been accepted on\r\nthe understanding that he was at liberty to vacate it whenever there\r\nwas a prospect of service in the field.\r\n\r\nWellesley was nominally chief secretary for two years, and he did some\r\ngood work during that time, but his sojourn in Ireland is merely an\r\nepisode {214} in a splendid life.  Richmond's other famous secretary\r\nwas Sir Robert Peel, who practised the arts of the statesman at\r\ntwenty-four as chief secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.\r\n\r\nDespite Wellesley's neglect of his Dublin duties he became a warm\r\nfriend of the viceroy and his wife.  It will be remembered that it was\r\nthe Duchess of Richmond who gave the celebrated ball at Brussels on the\r\nhistoric night that preceded Quatre Bras.  At the Battle of Waterloo\r\nthe duke was one of the suite in attendance on the Duke of Wellington.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Duke of Richmond and Lennox]\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Richmond was bitterly attacked by the Catholic party, and a\r\nlibel action against the editor of the _Dublin Evening Post_ in 1813\r\nprovided Daniel O'Connell with his first great opportunity for a public\r\ndisplay of his oratory.  McGee, the editor in question, had published a\r\ndaring article on the Lord-Lieutenant in which it was declared 'that he\r\nwas not the superior of the worst of his predecessors--the profligate\r\nand unprincipled Westmoreland, the cold-hearted and cruel Camden, and\r\nartful and treacherous Cornwallis.  They all insulted, they oppressed,\r\nthey murdered, and they deceived.'  The reference to murder was held\r\nsufficient to justify the Government in arresting McGee on the charge\r\nof having accused the Duke of Richmond with that crime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: O'Connell and the Duke]\r\n\r\nDaniel O'Connell took up the case for the imprisoned editor when no\r\nother member of the bar dare run the risk of offending the viceregal\r\ncourt.  The result was a foregone conclusion, and McGee was considered\r\nlucky to get off with two {215} years' imprisonment and a fine of L500,\r\nbut the case was rescued from obscurity by the accused's advocate's\r\nintroduction of the ultra-political speech for the defence.  In those\r\ndays they allowed a degree of irrelevancy in counsels' speeches that\r\nwould not be tolerated for a moment in the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nThe duke did not go out of office until 1813.  The position of\r\nrepresentative of the king had its advantages, and the almost regal\r\nstate he maintained in Dublin soothed his vanity, and was,\r\nincidentally, good for the trade of the city.  The duchess loved power\r\neven more than her husband did, and the exploits of the late chief\r\nsecretary, now well on his way to a dukedom, were her principal topic\r\nof conversation.  In Dublin she could lead, whereas in London she had\r\nto follow, and in Dublin she stayed for several years, an undisputed\r\nqueen.  Curran, now Master of the Rolls, was her friend, and the wits\r\nof the town flattered her in their own charming way.  Years afterwards\r\nthe duchess confessed that the happiest years of her life were spent in\r\nDublin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{216}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nThe advocates of Catholic Emancipation could not be expected to be\r\ncontent with mere social pleasures, and the ministry decided to try a\r\ndiplomat in the difficult post.  The duke having resigned in 1813, Lord\r\nWhitworth, an experienced diplomatist and a strong anti-Catholic, took\r\nhis place.  The duke and duchess, after their experience of Brussels\r\nand Waterloo, consented to govern British North America, as Canada was\r\nthen termed, and in 1819 the duke died of hydrophobia in the town of\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\nStudents of Napoleonic history will be able to recall the early career\r\nof the man chosen to foil the attempts of the popular party to force\r\ntheir policy of Catholic Emancipation on the Government.  Whitworth,\r\nwho had been born without a title or great wealth, was a self-made man\r\nas far as it was possible for one who owed his opportunities to the\r\ngenerosity of well-disposed patrons.  He was first a soldier, and then,\r\nthrough the influence of the Duke of Dorset, a diplomat, representing\r\nEngland in Poland, Russia, and France.  As Ambassador in Paris he came\r\ninto contact with Napoleon, and it was Whitworth who demanded his\r\npassports from the Corsican {217} when the Peace of Amiens was broken\r\nand all Europe plunged into war.\r\n\r\nLord Whitworth was a man who took advantage of his opportunities, and\r\nfrom 1785 to 1803 fortune was very kind to him, but following his\r\nsudden withdrawal from Paris he seemed to lose his powers, and for ten\r\nyears he chafed in obscurity.  In 1801 he had married the widow of his\r\nfirst great patron, and the Duchess of Dorset, a woman whose egotism\r\nwas matched by her greed, brought him a large fortune and some\r\ninfluence.  This was increased by the marriage of her mother to Lord\r\nLiverpool, and when that nobleman had been at the head of the\r\nGovernment for about a year he succumbed to the importunities of his\r\nambitious stepdaughter and appointed her husband to succeed the Duke of\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The haughty duchess]\r\n\r\nTo a woman of the temperament that distinguished the Duchess of Dorset\r\nthe acme of human bliss was the impersonation of royalty.  She revelled\r\nin the rites attendant upon the state the viceroy maintained, and as\r\nthe haughty duchess she was known throughout the country.  Lord\r\nWhitworth, past sixty and somewhat bored, was a tool in the hands of\r\nhis wife, who never forgot the fact that he was her late husband's\r\nprotege and, therefore, to some extent hers also.  She personally\r\nsupervised the list of those who had the _entree_ to the Castle, and\r\nher censorship of her predecessor's list caused a vast amount of\r\nill-feeling.  Wives of respectable professional men found themselves\r\nrelegated to the position occupied by their prototypes fifty years\r\nbefore, while {218} the intrepid duchess even attacked those who had\r\nmarried into plebeian families, and, therefore, forfeited her regard.\r\nIt was due to her efforts that her relative, Lord Liverpool, conferred\r\nan earldom on Whitworth, though she retained her ducal title throughout\r\nher life.\r\n\r\nThe viceregal pair were not unpopular, but Whitworth was scarcely the\r\nman to understand Irish affairs.  To a large extent the ruler of the\r\ncountry was Sir Robert Peel, the chief Secretary until 1818.  The\r\nDuchess of Dorset did not always approve of Peel, but, recognizing that\r\nhe saved her husband a considerable amount of work, she delegated the\r\ntask of maintaining the usual official correspondence with the ministry\r\nin London to him.  Peel was a strong--soon to become the\r\nstrongest--opponent of the Catholic claims.  The viceroy was of the\r\nsame opinion on this important matter, and, backed by an enormous\r\nEnglish army, they defied public opinion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earl Talbot]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1817 it was decided to replace Whitworth by Lord\r\nTalbot, and accordingly, on October 9, the new viceroy was sworn in,\r\nPeel taking a prominent part in the ceremony.  Talbot and Whitworth\r\nwere old friends, having first met during the latter's embassy in\r\nRussia, when the younger nobleman was an attache in the diplomatic\r\nservice, and he owed his selection to the good offices of the outgoing\r\nviceroy and his wife.  That he was opposed to Catholic Emancipation was\r\nanother point in his favour, while the Government were not unimpressed\r\nby the fact that Lady {219} Talbot was an Irish lady, the daughter of a\r\nCounty Meath gentleman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Visit of George IV.]\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Talbot made a determined effort to win the good-will of\r\nthe country.  Daniel O'Connell's raging, tearing propaganda was\r\ndisturbing, and ever threatened a revolution, but Talbot thought that\r\nby devoting some of his time to the patronage of agriculture he might\r\ngain more adherents to the Government's policy.  The farmers were not\r\nungrateful, but Lord Talbot must have realized before he was a year in\r\nthe country that the solution of the Irish question was not so easy as\r\nhe had thought it to be.  Peel, summoned to London for more important\r\nduties, still maintained his opposition to O'Connell and the Catholic\r\nclaims.  Then, in 1821, the Cabinet had a brilliant idea which resolved\r\nitself into this--that all Irish problems should be solved by a State\r\nvisit from George IV.  Hitherto English kings had been accustomed to\r\nvisit Ireland in the role of fugitives, but George IV. was to come as a\r\ngreat monarch, the first gentleman in Europe--and, as Thackeray had\r\nsaid, 'the biggest blackguard'--and Irish loyalty was to be aroused\r\nfrom its dormant condition.\r\n\r\nThe king carried out the plans laid down for him, and he had no cause\r\nto regret making the acquaintance of his Irish subjects.  He\r\nscrutinized everything he saw in Ireland with the air and interest of a\r\nschoolboy visiting a waxworks show.  English uniforms seemed to\r\nfascinate him when worn by Irish soldiers, and he hummed and hawed\r\nquestion after question from the beginning to the end of his visit.\r\n\r\n{220}\r\n\r\n'Who is that magnificent-looking officer?' he asked the viceroy,\r\nindicating the figure of Sir Philip Crampton, the celebrated surgeon.\r\n\r\n'Oh, that is a general of the Lancers, sir,' was the witty reply, and\r\nthe king passed on to something else.\r\n\r\nThe most humorous incident of his visit arose out of His Majesty's\r\ndesire to witness some racing at the Curragh.  In great state he\r\ntravelled down, and every preparation was made to supply the royal\r\nvisitor with a magnificent lunch.  The pantries of Dublin and London\r\nwere searched for dainties, and everything possible pressed into\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nIt happened to be a very wet day, and the races did not prove very\r\nexciting, but the king chivalrously maintained his interest as long as\r\nhe could.  When he retired to his room, where gorgeous flunkeys of all\r\nranks waited breathlessly for the king to name his refreshment, George\r\nIV. did not keep them long in doubt--he wanted a cup of tea.\r\n\r\nA simple request, and one easily granted, for in the royal pavilion\r\nwere the choicest teas, the finest sugar and cream, and, of course,\r\nplenty of hot water.  Then someone called for a cup and saucer.  Great\r\nconsternation ensued when it was discovered that those simple\r\nrequisites had been forgotten.  There was absolutely nothing in which\r\nto serve the tea to the royal visitor!\r\n\r\nWith prayers that the king might not get impatient, a score of scouts\r\nwere despatched to search the countryside for a cup and saucer, and\r\n{221} one of them proved successful, finding in a poor peasant's\r\nramshackle cabin a twopenny blue cup and saucer.  They were hastily\r\npolished up, and with remarkable celerity the tea was served to the\r\nthirsty king.\r\n\r\nOne of the caterers afterwards visited the owner of the cup and saucer,\r\nand gave her a guinea for them.  Needless to say, these precious\r\narticles were treasured by the caterer's family.\r\n\r\n  \"A clod--a piece of orange-peel--\r\n    An end of a cigar--\r\n  Once trod on by a princely heel,\r\n    How beautiful they are!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Talbot, K.P.]\r\n\r\nHe was received in Ireland with a courtesy that often swelled into\r\nenthusiasm, and Dublin, the centre of the local administration, went\r\ninto ecstasies over the royal visitor.  Lord Talbot was installed a\r\nKnight of St. Patrick amidst a splendour that contrasted with horrible\r\ndistinctness with the terrible misery and poverty that prevailed in the\r\nvery environs of Dublin Castle itself.  The king must have seen the\r\nshadows of famine and desolation that lurked behind the gaudy trappings\r\nthat did their best to make the city fit for a king, but he\r\nconveniently ignored them.  Monarchs have only a distant acquaintance\r\nwith human nature, and so King George, flattered by attentions denied\r\nhim in London except by his satellites, left the country convinced that\r\nthe demand for Catholic Emancipation was an artificial one created by\r\nO'Connell, and that in reality Ireland was a most contented and\r\nprosperous nation.\r\n\r\nBut the ills of humanity cannot be cured by a {222} display of royal\r\ndignity, and Talbot discovered that pressing social evils could not be\r\neradicated by the bestowal of ribbons and orders.  It may have seemed\r\nunaccountable to him that when the country demanded bread it should be\r\ndissatisfied with the sight of the king.  Lady Talbot was feeding with\r\n'cake' the 'upper ten' of Dublin society, but Ireland was dissatisfied.\r\nThe country was not progressing, the cities presented a squalid and\r\nlifeless appearance, and even Dublin, favoured by the being the\r\nresidence of the well-paid official set and the home of the Government,\r\nscarcely looked the prosperous place it had been during the last\r\nquarter of the previous century.\r\n\r\nTalbot advised stringent measures against O'Connell, but by now the\r\nministry was beginning to feel doubtful of its ready-made Irish policy,\r\nand soon rumours reached Talbot that he was to be succeeded by the\r\nMarquis Wellesley, a great Irishman, and an avowed Emancipationist.\r\nThe viceroy resigned at once and left Ireland.  He died in 1849, five\r\nyears after Peel had rewarded his Free Trade allegiance by giving him\r\nthe garter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Wellesley]\r\n\r\nThe Marquis Wellesley, an Emancipationist by conviction, was sent to\r\nIreland with promises the ministry did not intend to fulfil.  Peel,\r\nGoulburn, the Irish secretary, and the rest of his colleagues, were\r\nopposed to the granting of complete relief to the followers of the\r\npopular religion, and their selection of Lord Wellesley was merely an\r\nattempt to blind the eyes of the patriotic party.  When in the last\r\nmonths of 1821 it was declared officially that Wellesley was to succeed\r\nLord {223} Talbot, the joy of the Catholics knew no bounds.  To them\r\nthe new viceroyalty promised a speedy attainment of all their hopes,\r\nfor they knew that Wellesley was a strong man, and one likely to have\r\nhis own way.  Quite apart from political and sectarian reasons, Ireland\r\nwelcomed Wellesley.  He was an Irishman by birth, and although Harrow,\r\nEton, and Oxford in turn educated him, he had learnt the rudiments of\r\nthe three R's in the town of Trim.  It was recalled that the\r\nLord-Lieutenant in his younger days had been the friend of Henry\r\nGrattan, and as the result of thirty years' brilliant service on behalf\r\nof the Crown, no man--with the exception of his brother, the Duke of\r\nWellington--commanded greater respect or admiration in the two\r\nkingdoms, while so far as Ireland was concerned, the marquis was vastly\r\nmore popular than the duke, who had a constitutional objection to\r\nCatholicism in any form.  For eight years Lord Wellesley had acted as\r\nGovernor-General of India, and during the Peninsular War he was\r\nAmbassador to Spain--one brother conquering the French and the other\r\nreaping the not less important diplomatic victories, made possible by\r\nthe great battles.  From the foreign secretaryship under Percival\r\nWellesley might have had the premiership, but his views on Ireland were\r\nunpopular, and his failure to form a ministry prepared the way for Lord\r\nLiverpool to assume the leadership for a period of nearly fifteen\r\nyears.  Despite his opinions, Wellesley could have had the viceroyalty\r\nof Ireland in 1812, but he declined it.\r\n\r\n{224}\r\n\r\nWhen a young man of twenty-four, Wellesley--then the Earl of\r\nMornington--contracted an irregular alliance with a Parisian girl of\r\nremarkable beauty, Hyacinthe Gabrielle Roland, and for nine years they\r\nlived together.  She bore him children, and they appear to have been\r\nhappy.  Wellesley, however, was growing in public importance, and it\r\nwas represented to him privately that his domestic relations might\r\ninterfere with his chances of promotion.  To end an impossible\r\nsituation, he married his mistress in 1793, and from the day of the\r\nmarriage they seemed to lose their mutual affection.  Gabrielle Roland\r\nwas modest in her demands, and content to look after her children; as\r\nCountess of Mornington she pestered her husband to compel society to\r\nrecognize her new status.  He was helpless, of course, and quarrels\r\nensued, but they lived together until 1797, when he was appointed\r\nGovernor-General of India.  At first Lady Mornington wished to\r\naccompany him, but he was able to persuade her to remain at home.\r\n\r\nIndia at the time had a reputation for cruelty and treachery created by\r\nthe episode of the Black Hole of Calcutta, and Lady Mornington,\r\nthinking doubtless of her children and not herself, consented to remain\r\nbehind, and enjoy the generous allowance her husband proposed to make\r\nher.  For the rest of her life--which lasted until 1816--husband and\r\nwife saw little of each other; she failed to provide him with a\r\nlegitimate heir, and at the time it seemed likely that Lord Wellesley\r\nwould be Prime Minister he lived alone in London.  It was said {225}\r\nthat he refused the viceroyalty in 1812 because it would mean taking\r\n'the Frenchwoman to Dublin,' though a close examination of the existing\r\nrecords points to the fact that Wellesley was unwilling to leave the\r\ncentre of political interest at such a critical period in the history\r\nof England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord-Lieutenant assaulted]\r\n\r\nThe coming of Wellesley to Dublin Castle roused the enthusiasm of the\r\nCatholic party and the animosity of the governing minority.  In 1822 a\r\ngreat public meeting voted an address of congratulation to the marquis,\r\nthe motion being proposed by O'Connell and seconded by Richard Lalor\r\nSheil.  Meetings all over the country followed suit, and the squeakings\r\nof the Orange lodges were drowned in the popular welcome.  There was a\r\ntemporary lull in the formation of secret societies, and the Whiteboys,\r\nthe Orangemen, the Ribbonmen, and other associations for doing evil by\r\nstealth, waited for a sign from the Lord-Lieutenant.  He gave it by\r\nabolishing the annual Orange decoration of King William's statue, and\r\ninstantly the Orangemen flew to 'arms.'  Wellesley attended a gala\r\nperformance at the theatre, and an infuriated Orangeman entered a\r\npractical protest by hurling a bottle at his head.  It missed its mark\r\nby inches, and the culprit was arrested.  The Grand Jury, unanimously\r\nanti-Catholic, threw out the bill, and the powerful minority followed\r\nup this blow by inspiring a debate in the House of Commons, in which a\r\nvote of censure on the Lord-Lieutenant was rejected with the utmost\r\ndifficulty.  It was only too evident that the {226} Orangemen were\r\ndetermined to contest every inch of ground with the viceroy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Marquis Wellesley]\r\n\r\nThe general opinion regarding the Marquis Wellesley, when it was known\r\nthat he had no power to grant relief to the Catholics, was summed up in\r\nthe lines by Furlong, the Irish poet:\r\n\r\n  'Who that hath viewed him in his past career\r\n  Of hard-earned fame could recognize him here?\r\n  Changed as he is in lengthened life's descent\r\n  To a mere instrument's mere instrument;\r\n  Crippled by Canning's fears and Eldon's rules,\r\n  Begirt with bigots and beset with fools.\r\n  A mournful mark of talents misapplied,\r\n  A handcuffed leader and a hoodwinked guide;\r\n  The lone opposer of a lawless band,\r\n  The fettered chieftain of a fettered land.'\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Catholic Association]\r\n\r\nIn 1824 Daniel O'Connell, realizing that the Lord-Lieutenant could not\r\nforce the hand of his superiors in London, founded the Catholic\r\nAssociation, and it is no exaggeration to say that the people clamoured\r\nfor admission to it.  Every town and village throughout the country had\r\nits branch, and within twelve months it was the real authority in the\r\nland.  The English Government was superseded, and O'Connell was the\r\nvirtual ruler of Ireland.  Wellesley, who did not approve of the aims\r\nand methods of the Association, was devoting his attention to the\r\nsuppression of the secret societies, while the Cabinet in London wrote\r\nimploring him to deal effectively with O'Connell's society.  But the\r\nmarquis was helpless.  There was no secrecy about the Catholic\r\nAssociation, and its objects were, academically speaking, lawful, and\r\nits methods legal.  Further alarm was caused by the statement in some\r\nEnglish papers that {227} every Irish soldier was a member of the\r\nassociation.  Wellesley was asked for his opinion--he repeated again\r\nand again that the only way to make the country peaceful was to grant\r\nCatholic Emancipation.  Three Prime Ministers--Liverpool, Canning, and\r\nGoderich--in succession rejected the advice so disinterestedly given,\r\nand when a turn of Fortune's wheel placed the great Duke of Wellington\r\nin power, he intimated to his brother that as their views did not\r\ncoincide, it would be better if the Marquis of Anglesey, an old friend\r\nof both, should replace him in the Government as Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nIreland.  Lord Wellesley resigned without demur.  He was well aware\r\nthat they differed widely on many important topics, and Wellington had\r\nnever forgotten that if Wellesley's views on foreign policy had\r\nprevailed, there would have been no Waterloo and less glory.  In the\r\nHouse of Lords the marquis rose to denounce the Irish policy of his\r\nbrother, but they never made the blunder of carrying their quarrel into\r\nprivate life.  Lord Wellesley had in 1825 married an American lady,\r\nMrs. Patterson of Baltimore, the grand-daughter of one of the\r\nsignatories to the document that recorded the independence of the\r\nUnited States of America, and she brought him a happiness he had never\r\nknown before.  Witty, beautiful, and rich, the American marchioness\r\nheld her own in London society, and Wellesley was content for her to\r\nremain out of political affairs, save when his seat in the House of\r\nLords enabled him to speak against the Government.  Lady Wellesley, who\r\n{228} was a devout Catholic, was always escorted by a troop of dragoons\r\nto the Roman Catholic Provincial Cathedral in Marlborough Street,\r\nDublin, when her husband was viceroy.\r\n\r\nIn the Lower House Sir Robert Peel, now Home Secretary, was affirming\r\nhis unalterable determination never to surrender to the O'Connellites,\r\nand his leader was also giving a display of the Iron Will.  But even\r\nIron Dukes can unbend when they have been tempered by experience.  It\r\nwas the Wellington Ministry that granted Catholic Emancipation, and it\r\nwas Sir Robert Peel who sounded the note of surrender.  The collapse\r\nwas caused by the historic Clare election of 1828, within a few months\r\nof the appointment of Lord Anglesey.\r\n\r\nThere was, of course, considerable humour, intentional and otherwise,\r\nintroduced during the agitation for and against Catholic Emancipation.\r\nOnce King George IV. was heard to murmur plaintively:\r\n\r\n'Wellington is King of England, O'Connell is King of Ireland, and I am\r\nsupposed to be the Dean of Windsor.'\r\n\r\nLord Eldon presented to the House of Lords a petition of the tailors of\r\nGlasgow against the surrender to the Catholics.\r\n\r\n'What?' exclaimed Lord Lyndhurst, 'do tailors bother themselves about\r\nsuch measures?'\r\n\r\n'No wonder,' answered Eldon; 'you cannot suppose that tailors would\r\nlike turncoats.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{229}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nWellington's premiership was four days old when Lord Anglesey accepted\r\nthe viceroyalty.  The duke evidently selected his Waterloo comrade\r\nwithout taking the trouble to sound him upon the views he held, but\r\nGeorge IV.--that fine champion of Protestantism!--immediately sent for\r\nthe marquis, and in a touching interview implored him to keep the\r\nCatholics at bay, emphasizing his belief that the surrender of the\r\nGovernment to O'Connell would mean the dismemberment and destruction of\r\nthe British Empire.  Anglesey, who knew nothing whatever about anything\r\nexcept women and war, sought refuge in meaningless platitudes.  He\r\ndeclared to the king that he intended to take no part in sectarian or\r\npolitical strife in Ireland; he would administer the law equally to\r\nall, and so forth, impressing George IV. with a sense of his extreme\r\npropriety and impartiality.\r\n\r\nOn January 29, 1828, Lord Anglesey became Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.\r\nHe was in his sixtieth year, and could look back with some pride on a\r\nlong and busy life.  He had fought with Moore at Corunna, and at\r\nWaterloo was Wellington's commander of cavalry.  These were landmarks\r\n{230} in his life, and even his unfortunate relations with the wife of\r\nhis friend's brother did not create any ill-feeling between Anglesey\r\nand Wellington.  The Iron Duke had a great affection for his relations,\r\nand he often expressed his gratification at the remarkable successes\r\nachieved by his brothers, the Marquis Wellesley and Lord Cowley.\r\nPolitically the Wellesleys were always at enmity, and in addition they\r\nwere handicapped by inheriting from their mother some of her severe\r\nmanner and not a little of her pride.  It is remarkable that the three\r\nbrothers should each have had marital troubles.  The Duke of\r\nWellington's marriage, begun as a romance, ended as a tragi-comedy;\r\nLord Wellesley's went the same way, and he was burdened for years by a\r\nwife with whom he could not live; while Lord Cowley was compelled to\r\nseek a divorce.\r\n\r\nIt was five years before Waterloo that society was startled by the news\r\nthat Lord Cowley had presented a Bill to Parliament, praying to be\r\ndivorced from his wife, a daughter of Lord Cadogan.  The Marquis of\r\nAnglesey, then known as the Earl of Uxbridge, was cited as the\r\nco-respondent, and as Lord Uxbridge was a married man with eight\r\nchildren, and, of course, an intimate friend of the Wellesley family,\r\nLondon discussed nothing else.  The affair was robbed of a great deal\r\nof publicity by the influence of the two families concerned, but Lady\r\nUxbridge was not to be placated, and she divorced her husband.  Then\r\nLord Cowley was awarded damages to the extent of L24,000 against the\r\nearl, and the complicated {231} affair was simplified by the Earl of\r\nUxbridge marrying Lady Cowley.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington was too fond of a good soldier to permit a mere\r\nfamily matter to stand in the way of Lord Uxbridge's prospects.  He\r\ntook him to Waterloo, and if the earl lost a leg in that famous battle,\r\nhe gained a marquisate, bestowed within less than three weeks of June\r\n18, 1815.  Promotion in the service followed, and owing to Wellington's\r\ninfluence it was rapid and remunerative.\r\n\r\nThe appointment to Ireland was his patron's greatest gift.  It seemed\r\nonly too obvious that a soldier at the head of affairs would be very\r\nnecessary, for it was accepted as truth in ministerial circles that the\r\nentire Catholic priesthood of Ireland was engaged in a campaign for\r\nconverting the Irish soldiers in the English army to the political\r\nprinciples of the Catholic Association.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Clare election]\r\n\r\nWhen the Iron Duke formed a Government, the Catholic Association passed\r\na resolution declaring that it would oppose the election of any Irish\r\nmember who took office under the new premier.  Undisturbed by this, the\r\nmember for Clare, Mr. Fitzgerald, accepted the post of President of the\r\nBoard of Trade, and then O'Connell announced that he would be the\r\nnominee of the Association, and would contest the seat.  This created a\r\nveritable sensation.  The eyes of the world were centred on Clare, and\r\nLord Anglesey sent an army of occupation to take possession of it.  On\r\nthe polling days there were about five soldiers for every voter, and\r\nthe Catholic Association {232} received an advertisement that made the\r\nworld understand the seriousness of its principles.  No single election\r\nhas ever had the effect produced by the election of Daniel O'Connell to\r\nrepresent Clare at Westminster.  A month before the result Sir Robert\r\nPeel declared that he would die politically rather than give way: the\r\nreturns from Clare were still being discussed when the same man started\r\nto draft the Bill he introduced into the House of Commons in February,\r\n1829, a measure which completely emancipated the Roman Catholics.  The\r\nposts of Regent, of Lord Chancellor, and of Irish Viceroy were the only\r\nones Catholics could not hold.  The Catholic Association had justified\r\nits existence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lord Anglesey's position was not without interest.  He was\r\nvery unpopular with the patriotic party, and the fact that George IV.\r\nwas annoyed with him tended to increase further his popularity.\r\nAnglesey learned many things during his first six months in England,\r\nand he became an emancipationist while Peel was still defiant.  The\r\nDuke of Wellington was exasperated when Anglesey nullified his advice\r\nto Catholics to substitute patience for agitation by advising them to\r\nagitate until they obtained their demands.  The duke wrote curt\r\nletters, and Anglesey answered in a similar strain.  He was not fond of\r\nDublin or Dublin society, and Irish affairs began to bore him.  The\r\nmost interesting men were in his opinion the members of the Catholic\r\nAssociation, and he dare not be seen with them, while he knew, as every\r\nother viceroy had known, that {233} to withhold complete emancipation\r\nwas the worst service the English ministry could do the country.  The\r\nPrime Minister, with the help of the king, compelled Anglesey to send\r\nin his resignation, and the vacancy was given at once to Hugh Percy,\r\nthird Duke of Northumberland, Greville's 'prodigious bore,' and almost\r\nthe wealthiest nobleman in England.  He accepted with the proviso that\r\nhe was not to hold the post for more than eighteen months, while he\r\nadvised the Government to reduce the viceroy's salary by L10,000--it\r\nthen stood at L20,000 a year.  The latter piece of advice was not\r\naccepted, because the Government realized that there would be future\r\nviceroys without the wealth of the newer Percys.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tithe War]\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Duchess of Northumberland gave a great display of their\r\nwealth in Dublin, and once more the official party revelled in\r\nfeastings, balls, and flamboyant levees and drawing-rooms.  Some\r\nserious work was attempted, and in April, 1830, a proclamation was\r\nissued suppressing the Catholic Association.  Agitation feeds on\r\nagitation, and O'Connell's league had replaced Emancipation by Repeal.\r\nHe was demanding the severance of the Union between the two countries,\r\nand Northumberland determined on a vigorous campaign against the\r\nagitator.  The Tithe War--arising out of the refusal of the Catholic\r\npeasantry to pay tribute to the ministers of an alien Church--had\r\nbegun, and fierce encounters between the military and the country\r\npeople were everyday occurrences.  Northumberland had a large army at\r\nhis disposal, and the Cabinet advised him to {234} make full use of it,\r\nbut realizing the temper of the country better than his superiors, he\r\ndeclared that O'Connell's agitation for Repeal could be rendered\r\nabortive by reason, and not by force.  Despite the friction with his\r\nofficial chiefs in London, Northumberland would have remained in Dublin\r\nhad not the Tory ministry been replaced by Lord Grey's administration.\r\nThe Duke and Duchess of Northumberland--the latter best known as one of\r\nthe late Queen Victoria's governesses--left the country with the\r\nknowledge that they had been as successful as any viceregal pair before\r\nthem.  Sir Robert Peel described him as the very best governor of\r\nIreland, and Wellington, never an easy man to please, growled out some\r\ncompliments when he met the duke at a dinner-party.  Lord Anglesey's\r\nsecond viceroyalty began in December, 1830, and ended in September,\r\n1833.  He had been popular during his brief reign of 1828-29, but he\r\ndiscovered speedily that patriots are susceptible, and the viceroy who\r\nearned popularity as an emancipationist in 1828 was disliked and\r\ndistrusted by the O'Connellites, because he would not follow their lead\r\nand become equally as enthusiastic for Repeal.  Daniel O'Connell\r\nderided the viceroy in almost every speech made, and no epithet was too\r\nstrong to be applied to Lord Anglesey.  O'Connell publicly prayed for\r\nhis removal, and the viceroy, out of sympathy with all parties,\r\nlingered on at Dublin Castle, worried by the popularity of the\r\nRepealer, and disturbed by the havoc the Tithe War was playing with the\r\nprogress of the country.\r\n\r\n{235}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The famous Doon auction]\r\n\r\nThe history of the Tithe War has been told many times, and there is no\r\nroom for it here, but it possessed so much comedy and tragedy that some\r\nof its incidents may be recalled.  When the peasantry tried passive\r\nresistance, their activities were aroused by the arrival of soldiers to\r\ntake their goods and sell them by public auction.  In one battle twelve\r\npeasants were killed and twenty wounded; in another there were heavy\r\ncasualties on both sides; and there were other affrays with equally\r\ndeadly results.  A touch of humour was provided by the inhabitants of\r\nDoon, a Limerick town which, in the early thirties of the last century,\r\ncontained a population of about 5,000 Roman Catholics and a single\r\nProtestant.  In due course, the Protestant clergyman demanded tithes\r\nfrom the priest, which the latter promptly refused to pay.  With the\r\naid of the law, the priest's cow was seized, and elaborate preparations\r\nmade for its sale by public auction.  The authorities at Dublin Castle\r\nwere consulted, and a long correspondence dealing with the cow ensued;\r\nthere was much advising and consultation; the viceroy discussed it in\r\nsecret and laughed at it during dinner; the Commander-in-Chief of the\r\nforces was asked for his help, and he signed an order for the\r\nattendance of a small army at the forthcoming auction.  Meanwhile the\r\ncow, unmindful of its prominence and glory, browsed on contentedly\r\nuntil the time came when it was led into the field by its crown keeper\r\nand escorted by a force of police.  On the field of auction, besides\r\nthe police were a troop of the 12th Lancers, five companies {236} of\r\nthe 92nd Highlanders, and two pieces of artillery.  The auctioneer\r\nstood in the midst of an arsenal surrounded by the army.  Bids for the\r\nhistoric cow were invited; threats and jokes were all he got from the\r\npeasantry, and the proceedings finally left the Government in\r\npossession of the cow, no one having the courage to buy it.  This\r\nauction was one of many.  Cows and pigs, escorted by several hundred\r\nsoldiers, became part of the pageantry of the country; officers and men\r\nwere recalled from leave of absence to take their part in tending\r\ncattle captured from rebellious villagers.  No Government could\r\nmaintain its dignity, and ridicule nullified the dearly bought\r\nvictories in the field.  The net result was that the Government\r\ncollected L12,000 at a cost of L27,000 and hundreds of lives, and\r\nL48,000 still due for tithes.\r\n\r\nLord Anglesey saw nothing of the Tithe War, but from Dublin Castle he\r\nsuperintended the operations against the peasantry.  The Government\r\nregarded the objection to tithe-paying as one of O'Connell's devices\r\nfor rousing the masses against England, and although the ministry was\r\ncompelled to abolish the tithes, the victory of the peasants was more\r\napparent than real, because the Tithe Commutation Act of 1838 placed\r\nthe onus of collecting the dues on the landlord, who, of course, added\r\nthe amount to the rent he levied on his tenants' holdings.\r\n\r\nBetween July, 1834, and April, 1835, there were three ministries, two\r\nMelbourne administrations being interrupted by Sir Robert Peel's first\r\nand {237} brief government.  Lord Wellesley's second viceroyalty lasted\r\na few months--from September, 1833, to April, 1834--and although in\r\n1835 he intimated to Lord Melbourne that he would not be averse to a\r\nthird term, the premier appointed Lord Mulgrave, and Wellesley had to\r\nbe content with the gilded post of Lord Chamberlain.  The Marquis\r\nWellesley lived until 1842.\r\n\r\nThe viceroyalty of the Earl of Haddington was as colourless as it was\r\nbrief.  He had been in Parliament some years before he was given a\r\npeerage, and succeeding to the earldom shortly afterwards, passed into\r\nan obscurity from which he never emerged, even when Peel, on December\r\n29, 1834, made him Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.  That ministry resigned\r\nin the April following, and Lord Melbourne formed his second Cabinet,\r\nsending Lord Mulgrave to Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Irish party in Parliament]\r\n\r\nThe return to power of Lord Melbourne marked a new epoch in the history\r\nof the British Parliament.  For the first time English statesmen\r\nrealized that the Irish vote could be capable of controlling the\r\ndestinies of an English party.  Hitherto the Irish members had been\r\nregarded as of no account; ever since the Union one or other of the\r\ngreat parties had been able to act independently of the Irish members,\r\nbut the kaleidoscopic ministerial changes that had taken place since\r\nthe termination of Lord Liverpool's record premiership had gradually\r\ngiven the Irish members the balance of power between the two parties.\r\nIn eight years seven distinct Cabinets were formed, and when the\r\nseventh, Lord Melbourne's, received {238} their seals from William IV.,\r\nthey knew as well as O'Connell himself that their existence depended\r\nupon the Irish vote.\r\n\r\nIt was only natural that O'Connell and his followers were delighted.\r\nThey foresaw the time when England would tire of the domination of the\r\nIrish minority in Parliament, and would gladly send them back to\r\nCollege Green, and so certain were they of this that O'Connell agreed\r\nto suspend his demand for the repeal of the Union, and give Melbourne\r\nand his colleagues an opportunity of doing something great for Ireland.\r\nIt was a strong Government and rich in statesmen.  Lord John Russell\r\nwas Home Secretary, and Palmerston was Foreign Secretary.  The Cabinet\r\nhad many long and anxious consultations on Irish affairs, and the\r\nministers did their best to keep their bargain with O'Connell.  The\r\nHouse of Lords, however, blocked the way, and the Melbourne Government\r\nfell in the autumn of 1841.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Mulgrave was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland in 1835, he\r\nwas regarded as the best man for the position.  O'Connell expressed\r\npublic approval of him, and the numerous religious and political\r\nassociations added their testimonials.  The Irish leader's compact with\r\nthe ministry was well known, and although Lord Mulgrave was regarded as\r\nO'Connell's puppet, he was not without opinions of his own.  Lord\r\nAnglesey had expressed the opinion that O'Connell was the real ruler of\r\nIreland, and Mulgrave, in showing his sympathy with the Catholics,\r\nbecame as popular with the majority as he was unpopular {239} with the\r\npowerful Protestant minority.  He was considered to have the best\r\nopportunity to bring peace to Ireland, and English Liberal members of\r\nParliament, in their enthusiasm for their leader, Lord Melbourne, were\r\ncontinually pointing out how peaceful Ireland had become under a Whig\r\nadministration.  When a constable in the county of Clare appealed to\r\nDublin Castle to remove him to the metropolis because the country had\r\nbecome so quiet that he had no chance of gaining promotion or\r\ndistinguishing himself, the Whig Press and politicians went wild with\r\ndelight.  The enterprising constable was written about in scores of\r\npamphlets, and three-fourths of England got the impression--and\r\nretained it for many years, too!--that Ireland was most law-abiding, as\r\nwell as one of the most prosperous countries in the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William IV. and Lord Mulgrave]\r\n\r\nThe fatal weakness of Lord Mulgrave was his partisanship.  He could\r\nlook at nothing except through the spectacles of well-grounded opinions\r\nof his own.  At a time when he should have exercised discretion, he\r\nrushed into the arms of the Catholic party, and thereby mortally\r\noffended the Orangemen and their not-to-be-despised co-religionists.\r\nThe result was that at a Protestant meeting the mention of the\r\nviceroy's name was sufficient to fill the building with cries of\r\nderision, while at a gathering of the Catholics Lord Mulgrave was\r\ncheered to the echo.  It was an undignified reputation for a man\r\nsupposed to hold the scales of justice evenly, and William IV.\r\nprotested to Melbourne about the conduct of his viceroy.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the crime returns of the {240} period shows that the\r\ncompact between O'Connell and Lord Melbourne caused no appreciative\r\ndiminution of violence in the country.  Protestants declared that Lord\r\nMulgrave was encouraging political criminals by his leniency, the\r\nculmination of which was his decision in the case of the brutal murder\r\nof the second Earl of Norbury.  The earl was the younger son of the\r\nnotorious Chief Justice Toler, who had received honours from a grateful\r\ngovernment because of his anti-Irish and anti-Catholic policy.  On his\r\ndeathbed Toler, hearing that his neighbour, Lord Erne, was also dying,\r\nsent a servant to assure his lordship that it would be a _dead heat_\r\nbetween them!  The anecdote is characteristic of the man and his times,\r\nbut his children were of a different calibre.  The elder son died a\r\nlunatic, and the second was murdered because he evicted one of his\r\ntenants, a rogue who objected to paying rent.  The country cried out\r\nfor the severe punishment of the murderers, but the viceroy more than\r\ntempered justice with mercy, and every landowner instantly became\r\nalarmed.  If murderers were permitted to escape the hangman because a\r\nWhig viceroy was at Dublin Castle, then assuredly no Tory landlord was\r\nsafe.  Private and public appeals were made to the king and Lord\r\nMelbourne.  The premier was compelled to 'promote' him, and in 1839,\r\nshortly after he had been created Marquis of Normanby, the viceroy\r\nresigned in order to take up the post of Secretary for the Colonies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Mulgrave]\r\n\r\nLord Normanby's subsequent career was quite in keeping with his conduct\r\nin Ireland.  No matter {241} in what capacity he acted, he always took\r\nsides, and during his diplomatic career, the Foreign Office experienced\r\ntoo much Normanby for its liking.  His wife was one of the two women of\r\nthe bedchamber to Queen Victoria to whom Peel objected when called upon\r\nto form a Government in 1841.  Normanby had been asked to take charge\r\nof affairs, but there were not half a dozen men willing to serve under\r\nhim, and he soon abandoned his attempt to become Prime Minister.\r\nThenceforward his public life was spent abroad in the diplomatic\r\nservice, and a list of his diplomatic indiscretions would fill a\r\nvolume.  From 1846 to 1852 he was Ambassador at Paris, and Palmerston's\r\nsudden recognition of Louis Napoleon exasperated him to an extent that\r\nhe never forgot.  Normanby was not the man for Paris, and when given a\r\nchance to represent the English nation at the Court of Tuscany in\r\nFlorence, his partisanship, when he ought to have been neutral, was\r\nsuch that Lord Malmesbury had to recall him by telegraph!  He returned\r\nto England, and until his death in 1863, at the age of sixty-six, he\r\nacted with the Tories against the Whigs.  His conduct was due entirely\r\nto his personal detestation of Lord Palmerston.  He was not in sympathy\r\nwith a single act of the Whig, or Liberal, party, but he exerted\r\nhimself to thwart Palmerston.  He shed tears when 'Pam' became premier\r\nfor the second time, and he died while the Liberal statesman was\r\nhalf-way through his historic ministry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{242}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nThe Melbourne Government had two years to run when Lord Normanby left\r\nIreland, and they were represented for that period at Dublin by Hugh\r\nFortescue, Viscount Ebrington, and afterwards Earl Fortescue.  The\r\nO'Connell party welcomed Lord Ebrington as they would have welcomed\r\nanybody commissioned by Lord Melbourne, and although they had been\r\ndisappointed by the barren results of the treaty so far, they hoped for\r\nthe best.  The Repealer, realizing slowly, perhaps, that he was going\r\nto experience a bitter disappointment, was anxious to raise the\r\nstandard of revolt, but he was advised by friends of the ministry to\r\nwait.  They prevailed upon him to give them another chance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Encouraging Irish trade]\r\n\r\nThe accession to power of Sir Robert Peel dispelled O'Connell's\r\nsanguine hopes.  It was true that the premier had twelve years\r\npreviously conceded the claims of the Catholic party, but it was known\r\nthat he would have none of the cry for Repeal, and that he would\r\nappoint a Lord-Lieutenant of his own stamp.  It is singular, indeed,\r\nhow devotedly O'Connell admired the office of the viceroy.  To him it\r\nseemed to represent Ireland's scrap of royalty, and in the imitation\r\n{243} courts of Dublin Castle and the Viceregal Lodge he saw something\r\nof regal independence for the country.  He was always opposed to the\r\nabolition of the post, and during the Melbourne administration was\r\ncontinually suggesting to the premier the names of noblemen likely to\r\nmake efficient viceroys.  When Lord Normanby retired, he promptly\r\ncounselled Melbourne to send Lord Clarendon over, but the commission\r\nwas given to Lord Ebrington, and this nobleman's compulsory resignation\r\nlet in Earl de Grey, who governed Ireland from September, 1841, to\r\nJuly, 1844.  He was sixty years of age, wealthy, and popular, married\r\nto an Irish lady of great charm, when he was selected by Sir Robert\r\nPeel; and with a callous indifference to O'Connell's disapproval he\r\ncame to Ireland, and with the help of his wife won the respect of all\r\nclasses.  Lady de Grey was a daughter of the first Earl of Enniskillen,\r\nand was three years her husband's junior, whom she had married in 1805.\r\nWhile the Lord-Lieutenant entertained Dublin society, and spent\r\nthousands of pounds to the benefit of the country, Lady de Grey bore\r\nher part well, though she showed at times that she did not regard\r\nherself as a hostess only.  She realized that the country could do with\r\nmore trade and less agitation, and without recourse to political means\r\nshe set herself the task of helping the manufacturers of Ireland.\r\nHabitues of Dublin Castle and the Viceregal Lodge entertainments soon\r\nheard that they could not please her Excellency better than by\r\npatronizing Irish industries, and if the ladies were still compelled to\r\nbuy their {244} dresses in London and Paris, they were induced to\r\npatronize the Irish dressmakers for their less expensive gowns.\r\n\r\nIt was not, of course, the most auspicious time for a genuine attempt\r\nto do something practical towards the social salvation of Ireland.\r\nCrime was rife; agitation was rampant; patriotism rioting deliriously.\r\nMany districts became acquainted with famine, but if food was short\r\norators were plentiful.  De Grey had plenty of work to do, and it was\r\nhe who initiated the proceedings that led to the arrest of Daniel\r\nO'Connell and some of his friends in the autumn of 1843.  The\r\nGovernment took advantage of a public meeting of the agitators to\r\napprehend them for conspiracy, and eventually O'Connell and his\r\nassociates were placed on trial, found guilty by a packed jury, and\r\nsubsequently 'imprisoned' in an old-fashioned country house, where they\r\npassed their time amidst a quiet that must have been to them a luxury.\r\nThey were allowed to have their own servants and whatever food they\r\nwished, and never were prisoners more free than during the three months\r\nthat elapsed between the conviction and sentence by the Lord Chief\r\nJustice of Ireland, and the reversal of the verdict by the House of\r\nLords.  That memorable trial gave William Smith O'Brien his\r\nopportunity, for O'Brien became automatically the leader of the Repeal\r\nmovement when O'Connell was in 'prison.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The decline of O'Connell]\r\n\r\nBetween the first and second trials Lord de Grey left Ireland, and was\r\nsucceeded by Lord Heytesbury, who remained until 1846.  Born in 1779,\r\n{245} William a'Court, first Baron Heytesbury, was educated at Eton,\r\nand spent many years in the diplomatic service, holding the important\r\nposition of Ambassador to the courts of Portugal and Russia.  In 1808\r\nhe married a grand-daughter of the Earl of Radnor, and twenty years\r\nlater his diplomatic services were rewarded by the bestowal of a\r\npeerage.  Peel always had a high opinion of Heytesbury, and only his\r\nresignation in 1835 prevented him making the ex-ambassador\r\nGovernor-General of India.  On the resignation of Earl de Grey, Peel\r\ninvited Heytesbury to go to Ireland, and the invitation was accepted.\r\nHe was able to regard with indifference the censure of the Law Lords on\r\nthe conduct of the Dublin Government in the matter of Daniel\r\nO'Connell's trial.  He could easily dissociate himself from the faults\r\nof the preceding regime.  The abandonment of the cry for Repeal by\r\nO'Connell lessened the anxieties of Heytesbury, but there were the\r\nusual economic problems to be dealt with, and from all over the country\r\nreports came of the terrible distress and poverty prevailing.  The\r\nLord-Lieutenant did his best, and much money was spent in a vain\r\nattempt to ameliorate the conditions of peasant life.  By the close of\r\nLord Heytesbury's brief reign, however, ominous clouds were rising on\r\nthe political horizon.  Daniel O'Connell, tamed by age and experience,\r\nwas by no means the raging propagandist of the twenties and thirties;\r\nhe was ever counselling his fiery followers to concentrate their\r\nattention on the reform of the English Parliament, but his adherents\r\ndemanded {246} Repeal, and when he disagreed, they passed on, despising\r\nthe leader who refused to lead.  William Smith O'Brien was now the\r\ntemporary hero, and he was fascinating the rank and file of agitators\r\nby his aristocratic manner and superficial unselfishness.  Here was a\r\nman--not one of themselves--who stood to lose everything and gain\r\nnothing by his association with a cause that was supposed to be the\r\nreligion of the lower-class Irish and the scarcely superior patriotic\r\nattorneys and doctors.  William Smith O'Brien was a gentleman and a\r\npatriot!  The country gasped, and followed him, leaving Daniel\r\nO'Connell to realize that every generation produces its heroes and\r\ngeniuses, and will not tolerate the rivalry of the aged, however\r\neminent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Irish Lord-Lieutenant]\r\n\r\nLord John Russell began his first ministry on July 6th, 1846.  His\r\nCabinet was a strong one, and his prospects were bright save on the\r\nomni-present Irish question.  O'Connell was certainly a spent force,\r\nbut a new race of agitators had arisen, and the principles of '98 were\r\nas strong as ever nearly fifty years later.  The premier, however, had\r\nsome knowledge of Ireland.  As a boy he had played in the heavy rooms\r\nof Dublin Castle, and as Home Secretary he had studied Irish affairs\r\nbesides administering them.  He was well aware that the chief defect of\r\nmany viceroys was their inability to understand the national character,\r\nand he therefore came to the conclusion that if a resident Irish\r\nlandlord should be appointed Lord-Lieutenant, something would be done\r\nat any rate to popularize the executive government {247} in Dublin.\r\nHappily for Russell, there was the man for his purpose in the ranks of\r\nhis followers.  John William Ponsonby, fourth Earl of Bessborough, was\r\na popular Irishman, a large landowner, and possessing considerable\r\ninfluence in his own country.  This had been proved by the Kilkenny\r\nelection of 1826, when he was returned to Parliament despite the most\r\nenergetic opposition of O'Connell.\r\n\r\nFive years later, when the agitator's position and power were almost\r\nimpregnable, he retained his seat with a majority of sixty-five, thanks\r\nto the support of the most famous of Irish Roman Catholic Bishops, Dr.\r\nDoyle.  Retiring from Kilkenny, he represented Nottingham in the\r\nCommons until in 1834, after twenty-nine years of Parliamentary life,\r\nhe was created a peer in his own right, and took his seat in the House\r\nof Lords as Lord Duncannon.  In 1834 he was Home Secretary, and from\r\n1835 to 1839 was Lord Privy Seal.  Two years after, succeeding to the\r\nearldom, he was appointed Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland immediately upon\r\nLord John Russell's formation of a Government.  Between the date of the\r\nKilkenny election and his accession to the House of Lords, one of the\r\nmost important events in his life was his friendship with O'Connell.\r\nOnce his bitterest enemy, the agitator became almost an intimate\r\nfriend, and Russell's selection of Bessborough for the viceroyalty was\r\na direct attempt to please the popular party.  Unfortunately for the\r\ndesigns of the premier, the appointment came too late.  There were new\r\n'shepherds in Israel,' and O'Connell {248} no longer led the Repealers\r\nor guided them in their councils.  Of course, in official circles Lord\r\nand Lady Bessborough were successful enough.  Lady Bessborough was a\r\ndaughter of that Earl of Westmoreland who had been Viceroy of Ireland\r\nfrom 1790 to 1795, and her Excellency was like an old friend returning.\r\nBut their stay in Dublin was destined to be very brief, and just when\r\nit appeared that the viceroy was to be overwhelmed by the enormous\r\namount of work created by the followers of O'Brien, his Excellency died\r\nsuddenly in Dublin Castle on May 16, 1847--a tragedy which, amongst\r\nother things, meant that the stormiest viceroyalty in the history of\r\nthe country should be that of Lord Clarendon.  Lord Bessborough was\r\nsixty-six, and his death was regretted by everybody.  Those who had the\r\nwelfare of the country at heart had been hoping that, with an Irishman\r\nand a resident landlord at the head of the Irish executive, peace might\r\ncome to the nation, were left to seek consolations in speculations on\r\nthe 'might-have-been,' while the party of revolution were relieved of\r\nthe embarrassment of rebelling against the Government represented by a\r\nman against whom no charge of self-interest or lack of patriotism could\r\nbe hurled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earl of Clarendon]\r\n\r\nOne friend of O'Connell was succeeded by another, and George William\r\nFrederick Villiers, fourth Earl of Clarendon, was sworn in as\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland shortly after Lord Bessborough's death.  It\r\nwas understood that he was to be the last Viceroy of Ireland.  He was\r\nthen forty-seven years of age, twenty-seven of which {249} had been\r\nspent in the service of the country.  At twenty he was an attache to\r\nthe British Embassy at St. Petersburg; from 1827 to 1829 a\r\ncommissionership of Customs took him to Ireland, where he studied the\r\nIrish question so effectively that the Lord-Lieutenant, the Marquis of\r\nAnglesey, was glad to have his advice.  When he left Madrid, the\r\nSpanish Government struck a medal in his honour as a tribute to his\r\nsuccessful occupancy of an embassy by no means the easiest in Europe.\r\nIn 1838 he declined the Governor-Generalship of Canada: indeed, he made\r\na habit of declining honours, amongst these being a twice-offered\r\nmarquisate and two pressing invitations to govern India.  In 1847,\r\nhowever, he accepted the post of Viceroy of Ireland, and with Lady\r\nClarendon, who was a daughter of the Earl of Verulam, he entered upon\r\nhis remarkable term of office.  A year before he had presided over the\r\nBoard of Trade, and this was his most onerous ministerial appointment\r\nuntil he went to Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe strongest and wisest of men would have failed in Ireland during the\r\nperiod bounded by the years 1847 and 1852--the time covered by Lord\r\nClarendon's viceroyalty--and the Lord-Lieutenant was by no means\r\nentitled to be considered above the average in strength and wisdom.  He\r\nwas a Liberal, and a Free Trader, and a friend of O'Connell, and he had\r\nnumerous ideas that he hoped would fructify to Ireland's gain, but he\r\nnever had a real chance.  In succession he had to face the Young\r\nIreland insurrection, the famine, Orange disturbances in several\r\ncounties, the {250} ghastly economic problems created by the increasing\r\nemigration of the peasantry, and the consequent bankruptcy of the\r\nlandlords.  Clarendon laboured at the Castle and in London in a\r\nhopeless endeavour to restore order out of chaos.  To defeat William\r\nSmith O'Brien and his followers was ridiculously easy, but it was\r\nanother matter coping with a famine that threatened to wipe the peasant\r\npopulation out of existence.  Ireland, ever the thorn in the crown of\r\nBritish statesmanship, drove Russell to distraction, and made Clarendon\r\nold before his time.  Daily plots to assassinate him were duly reported\r\nto the police, and by them to the viceroy; Lady Clarendon was induced\r\nto spend most of her time in England, and eventually so virulent did\r\nthe enemies of the Government become that for days the viceroy was\r\nplaced in the humiliating position of being unable to go beyond the\r\nprecincts of Dublin Castle.  At viceregal parties a large percentage of\r\nthose present consisted of spies and detectives.  In the country blood\r\nwas being shed--at the Castle lives were being worn out.  Clarendon was\r\ncourageous enough, but courage is only a secondary attribute in a\r\nstatesman.  Wisdom was wanted, and wisdom was not to be found.  The\r\nexecutive at Dublin scarcely understood the temper of the country.  The\r\nLord-Lieutenant's policy was vigorous, but its administration haphazard\r\nand spasmodic.\r\n\r\nWhenever an experiment or change was tried, it was abandoned in panic\r\nbefore anyone could judge the results.  The viceroy overshadowed {251}\r\nthe Chief Secretary, and thus all the acts of the queen's\r\nrepresentative were coloured by the opinions of one political party.\r\nTo the mass of the people of Ireland the throne of England symbolized\r\noppression and persecution.\r\n\r\nIn this vague and bewildering state of affairs there was no room for\r\nsocial pleasantries, though Castle seasons came and went with grim\r\nregularity.  There was, however, some compensation in store for the\r\nharassed viceroy, for to everybody's surprise it was announced that\r\nQueen Victoria intended to visit Ireland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Queen Victoria's first visit]\r\n\r\nThe first visit to Ireland of Queen Victoria took place in 1849.  Her\r\nMajesty was accompanied by the Prince Consort, and the royal parents\r\nbrought their children with them.  Their stay in Ireland had to be\r\nlimited to five days, and a great deal had to be compressed into the\r\nshort time at their disposal.  Ireland has always been courteous to its\r\nvisitors of whatever rank, but Queen Victoria received an enthusiastic\r\nwelcome that voiced her popularity with every class and creed in the\r\ncountry.  She had undertaken the journey from a strong sense of duty;\r\nshe actually experienced a sense of pleasure, and from that time\r\nforward there was at least one eminent person in England who understood\r\nthe good qualities of the people of Ireland.  On the surface, and to\r\nsuit the phrase-mongers, they might be disloyal, but at heart they\r\nentertained a strong affection for the occupant of the throne of\r\nEngland.  Queen Victoria knew this, and her opinion was endorsed by her\r\nsuccessors, King Edward VII. and King George V., {252} when they made\r\nthe acquaintance of the people of the 'kingdom of Ireland.'\r\n\r\nThe royal visit accomplished, Dublin returned to its old condition of\r\nsqualor.  Agitation was rife, fostered by the pens and voices of a\r\ngroup of brilliant Irishmen.  They had started the _Nation_ newspaper,\r\nand had made it one of the most powerful organs in the country; other\r\noffshoots of the Young Ireland Press helped to pepper the Government,\r\nand as there was no champion on the English side, the patriots appeared\r\nto have matters all their own way.  Arguments were unanswered, and\r\nwere, therefore, accepted as infallible, and this condition of things\r\ncontinued for a time until the viceroy and his secretary, Mr. Corry\r\nConellan, decided to have a newspaper champion of their very own.  Sir\r\nWilliam Somerville, the Chief Secretary, was called into the\r\nconference, and ways and means discussed.  There can be no doubt of the\r\nfact that the Lord-Lieutenant could have had the aid of any one of a\r\ndozen clever journalists, but ashamed, perhaps, of their methods, they\r\nenlisted in their service a person of the name of Birch, whose only\r\nclaim to notoriety was the proprietorship of the _World_, and a\r\nconviction ending in six months' imprisonment for having threatened to\r\npublish a defamatory article about a public official unless the latter\r\npaid for its suppression.  Lord Clarendon was, of course, unaware of\r\nhis hireling's police-court experiences, and he agreed with his private\r\nsecretary's recommendation of Mr. Birch.  The latter was, therefore,\r\nregularly supplied with {253} opinions from the Castle upon all\r\nsubjects relating to Ireland, and week by week the _World_ did its best\r\nto counteract the effect produced by every issue of the _Nation_.  It\r\nwas a feeble attempt on Birch's part, who possessed neither the wit nor\r\nthe talent of the _Nation_ writers, and his employers tired of his\r\nfutilities.  The hack was given notice, and his _World_ was abandoned\r\nby the viceregal party.  But Mr. Birch was a gentleman with a knowledge\r\nof a greater world; he decided that Lord Clarendon and his Chief\r\nSecretary could be made to pay, and so he concocted a list of services\r\nrendered and demanded a honorarium of L7,000 for his trouble.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A 'cause celebre']\r\n\r\nWhen the claim was first made, the Lord-Lieutenant declined to pay a\r\npenny more.  He reminded Birch that he had received nearly L2,000 in\r\nreturn for very little work, but the journalist did not wish to argue\r\nthe rights or wrongs of his claim--he wanted money, or else he would\r\nbring them into court and open his mouth.  This frightened Lord\r\nClarendon, who compromised with Birch by paying him the sum of L2,000\r\nto withdraw his action.  The journalist accepted, and turned his\r\nattention to the Chief Secretary, who wisely refused to be blackmailed,\r\nand accordingly, in the month of December, 1851, the elite of Dublin\r\ncrowded the approaches to the Four Courts, to witness the spectacle of\r\na viceroy in the witness-box being cross-examined by counsel for the\r\nplaintiff.  There were rumours that the most sensational disclosures\r\nwould be made, and in official circles there was much trepidation.\r\n{254} By now the viceroy had learned the lesson that to attempt to\r\nconciliate a blackmailer was the most stupid form folly could assume.\r\nHe agreed to submit himself to cross-examination--the only course if he\r\ndesired to free himself from his late confederate.\r\n\r\nBirch boldly stated his case, and described how he had been sent for by\r\nthe viceroy's private secretary, and bought over by the Government.  He\r\nhad been instructed to reply to the attacks of the _Nation_, and, so he\r\nsaid, given a free hand in the spending of money.  One story is good\r\nuntil another is told, and Birch's was largely discounted when the\r\ndefence made its explanation.  Lord Clarendon confessed that he had\r\npaid L3,700 altogether to Birch, and had received practically nothing\r\nin return.  Of this sum L2,000 had been paid to the journalist to\r\nabandon an action he had entered against the viceroy, claiming L4,800\r\nand L3 10s. costs.  The action tried was ostensibly against Sir William\r\nSomerville, the Chief Secretary, but everybody knew that it was merely\r\nanother attempt on the insatiable Birch's part to extract more money\r\nfrom the Lord-Lieutenant.\r\n\r\nThe trial lasted several days, but when the jury were allowed to\r\nretire, they made short work of Birch, whose cross-examination had\r\nkilled his chances of success.  Four minutes' deliberation was\r\nsufficient for the jurymen to bring in a verdict for the defendants, to\r\nwhom they awarded costs to the amount of sixpence.  It was a blow to\r\nthe prestige of Lord Clarendon, though the right-minded admitted his\r\nhonesty in declining to be {255} blackmailed by an adventurer.\r\nNaturally, the opposition party made great capital out of it, and the\r\n_Nation_ attained the dignity of a classic.  For many weeks its pages\r\nwere never without a reference to the _cause celebre_, one of these\r\nbeing a neat epigram, which read:\r\n\r\n  '\"Lord C. has grown most awfully religious,\"\r\n    Said Corry Conellan with a rueful air;\r\n  \"At least, his trepidation is prodigious\r\n    As to how in the next World he'll fare!\":\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all the stubbornness of an English gentleman, the viceroy remained\r\non at his post.  He was anxious to discover the solution to the\r\nproblems of the day.  English money poured into the country to relieve\r\nthe famine-stricken areas, and the landlords were helped also, but this\r\ndid not augur tranquillity in the future.  In despair the viceroy began\r\na policy of favouring the patriotic party; he tried conciliation, made\r\nadvances, and offered the hand of friendship, only to be called a\r\ncoward, and earn the distrust of his own party.  He then reversed his\r\npolicy with the usual result--nobody was pleased, and when in 1852 Lord\r\nClarendon's term came to an end, he was adjudged by all classes to have\r\nfailed, although in such times Clarendon's failure was not without its\r\npersonal compensations.  He had the satisfaction of knowing that no man\r\ncould have succeeded, and history has proved that to be a fact.  His\r\nsubsequent career is part of the history of England, for he was Foreign\r\nSecretary from 1853 to 1858, an epoch rendered memorable by the {256}\r\nCrimean War and the Indian Mutiny.  In 1870 he died suddenly, seventy\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earl of Eglinton and Winton]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A remarkable sportsman]\r\n\r\nLord Derby's first Government began on February 27, 1852, and ended in\r\nthe following December.  During that short period the Viceroy of\r\nIreland was Lord Eglinton and Winton, a nobleman who is best remembered\r\nas the promoter of the Eglinton tournament, an attempt to revive the\r\nold-time glory of the age of chivalry.  This freak cost him L40,000, a\r\nsmall sum to one possessed of great wealth, a fact he made evident\r\nthroughout his stay in Dublin.  His lavish entertainments created a new\r\nera in viceregal hospitality.  Lord Eglinton was essentially what may\r\nbe described as a sportsman, using the term in the old sense, and not\r\nas it is now understood.  His racing stable was about the largest and\r\nmost successful in England, and during the forty-nine years (1812-61)\r\nhe lived, he helped to enliven the crowd.  He was devoted to sport, and\r\nsome surprise was expressed when he agreed to govern Ireland, but he\r\nliked the country, and in 1858, on Lord Derby's return, he went back to\r\nDublin, but within sixteen months he resigned, and in June, 1859, it\r\nbecame necessary to find a successor.  He was scarcely interested in\r\npolitics, though in 1854 he moved a resolution in the Lords asking for\r\na commission to inquire into the working of the Board of Education in\r\nIreland.  During his second viceroyalty he married again--the first\r\nLady Eglinton having died in 1853--and for a few months a daughter of\r\nthe Earl of Essex acted as the hostess of Dublin Castle and the\r\nViceregal {257} Lodge.  Personally untouched by the political\r\ndifficulties of the country, Lord Eglinton had the merit of realizing\r\nthe hopelessness of trying to solve Irish problems, and he did more\r\ngood with his lavish dinners than the well-meaning Clarendon had with\r\nhis painstaking investigations into, and midnight studies of, what are\r\ntermed, for want of a better name, 'Irish affairs.'  He was given the\r\nUnited Kingdom peerage of Winton--an earldom--on his retirement from\r\nIreland, the grateful ministry thus acknowledging his popularity as a\r\nsportsman, and helping us to remember that he won the St. Leger three\r\ntimes and the Derby once.\r\n\r\nPolitical affairs having terminated Lord Eglinton's first viceroyalty\r\ntowards the close of 1852, Lord Aberdeen, the Prime Minister, appointed\r\nthe Earl of St. Germans to Ireland.  It was yet another attempt to meet\r\nthe criticism that English statesmen and Irish viceroys were absolutely\r\nignorant of and indifferent to Irish problems.  Lord St. Germans was\r\nfifty-four, and for some years--1841 to 1845--had been Chief Secretary\r\nfor Ireland.  He was a man of ability and courage, and as the author of\r\nthe Eliot Convention taught the participants in the Carlist rising in\r\nSpain something of the decencies of warfare.  As Chief Secretary for\r\nIreland, his time had been spent in dealing with the numerous petty\r\nrebellions and their leaders; he introduced a Bill to restrict the sale\r\nof firearms and the importation of ammunition; the Government found it\r\nunacceptable, and Eliot went out of office to be given the {258}\r\nPostmaster-Generalship by Peel, and later the Lord-Lieutenancy of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nLord St. Germans married in 1824 a grand-daughter of the first Marquis\r\nCornwallis, and both became intimate friends of the royal family.  In\r\n1853 Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort visited Dublin to open the\r\ngreat International Exhibition, and, of course, they were\r\nenthusiastically welcomed by the whole of the country.  Lord and Lady\r\nSt. Germans took the lead in a splendid series of festivities that\r\ncelebrated the visit of the queen.  Political motives may have\r\nsuggested the visit, but in all probability the anxiety of Her Majesty\r\nto see Ireland again was not lessened by the fact that her friend was\r\nthe viceroy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earl of Carlisle]\r\n\r\nSt. Germans' retirement in 1855 to become Lord Steward and confidant of\r\nthe queen until his death, at the age of seventy-nine, in 1877, was\r\nfollowed by Lord Carlisle's first term of office.  As Lord Morpeth he\r\nhad been Chief Secretary for more than six years--1835-41--the post\r\nhaving been given him because it was his amendment to the address that\r\nturned out the Peel administration in the spring of 1835.  Lord\r\nMorpeth, as he was known during the twenty odd years he sat in\r\nParliament, was the most workmanlike minister of his generation.  With\r\nthe assistance of Thomas Drummond, his under-secretary, he framed the\r\nIrish Tithe Bill, the Irish Municipal Reform Bill, and the Irish Poor\r\nLaw Bill; and, although hampered by the House of Lords and by the fact\r\nthat he was regarded as Lord Melbourne's {259} hostage for good\r\nbehaviour to Daniel O'Connell, he was a most successful Chief Secretary\r\nin a time when success was very dearly bought.  He was, therefore,\r\nessentially a safe man when he became viceroy on the nomination of Lord\r\nPalmerston in February, 1855.  He held the post until October, 1864,\r\nwith the exception of the sixteen months occupied by Lord Eglinton's\r\nsecond viceroyalty, between February, 1858, and June, 1859.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to say that any Viceroy of Ireland has been\r\nsuccessful, because there is no such thing as pleasing the numerous\r\nparties into which the democracy and aristocracy of the country is\r\ndivided, but Lord Carlisle went as near success as any human being\r\ncould.  A fine statue by J. H. Foley, erected in Phoenix Park in 1870,\r\nis evidence of the popularity of George William Frederick Howard,\r\nseventh Earl of Carlisle.  He was an emancipationist when it was\r\ndangerous to confess to such ultra-Liberalism, and his speech when\r\nintroducing the Irish Tithe Bill in the House of Commons in 1835--he\r\nwas but thirty-three--remains one of the best speeches by an Englishman\r\non Irish affairs.  He took a genuine interest in the welfare of the\r\ncountry, and did his best.  The 'patriots' denounced him as a tool of a\r\ntyrannical Government; the few that made his personal acquaintance\r\ndiscovered a scholarly nobleman with the most amiable manner in the\r\nworld.  He never married, and consequently did not entertain on the\r\nsame lavish and indiscriminate scale as his predecessors, but Dublin\r\nCastle was all the better for its acquaintance with the eminent {260}\r\npersons the viceroy dined and wined there.  Another visit of the Queen\r\nand Prince Albert, inspired by the fact that the Prince of Wales was\r\nquartered with his regiment at the Curragh, was a feature of Lord\r\nCarlisle's term.\r\n\r\nThere were, of course, the usual political agitations, and although the\r\nSmith O'Brien rising had collapsed ignominiously, a new force in Irish\r\naffairs came into existence about the time that Lord Carlisle was\r\nconcluding his first viceroyalty.  The Irish in America had begun to\r\ntake a practical interest in Irish affairs.  They subscribed large sums\r\nof money to aid the cause of Irish independence, and for six years,\r\nbeginning with 1858, great preparations were made for the striking of\r\nthe decisive blow.  James Stephens and others founded the Fenian\r\norganization described by Mr. Gladstone as having its root in Ireland\r\nand its branches in the United States.  During the latter months of\r\nLord Carlisle's viceroyalty there were one or two small attempts on the\r\npart of the Fenians to make themselves prominent, but it was not until\r\nLord Wodehouse was in power at Dublin Castle that English ministers\r\nrealized the gravity of the new situation created by Stephens and his\r\nfriends.  Lord Carlisle's resignation was brought about by ill-health,\r\nand in October, 1864, he left Ireland, to die before the close of the\r\nyear.  It illustrates the viceroy's position in social and literary\r\ncircles to recall the fact that when the country celebrated in 1864 the\r\ntercentenary of the birth of William Shakespeare, Lord Carlisle should\r\nbe selected to preside over the festivities at Stratford-on-Avon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{261}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nThe viceroyalty of Lord Wodehouse brought him an earldom in the year he\r\nretired from office--1868--but it would be an exaggeration to say that\r\nhe was conspicuously successful.  Until his appointment to Ireland,\r\nWodehouse had had experience of under-secretaryships only, at the\r\nForeign and Indian Offices, and Lord Palmerston's selection came as a\r\nsurprise.  It may have been due to the fact that Lord Wodehouse's wife\r\nwas a daughter of an Irish peer, the last Earl of Clare, and there have\r\nbeen selections for the viceroyalty based on even more frivolous and\r\ncynical reasons.  There was, of course, a great deal of anxious and\r\ndangerous work for Lord Wodehouse to do, and within a few months of his\r\narrival in Dublin he was coping night and day with the Fenian rising.\r\nAt first all the viceroy's energy and the underground activities of his\r\nsubordinates seemed helpless against the efforts of the latest society\r\nfor bringing about separation from England, but Lord Wodehouse was not\r\ndismayed, and he met murder with execution and assassination with the\r\nrope.  The Fenian movement culminated in 1867 in a series of shameless\r\nmurders that once more drew the {262} attention of the English nation\r\nto the disturbed condition of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn the May of 1867 Mr. Gladstone declared in the House of Commons that\r\nthe time was near when the Government would have to deal with the Irish\r\nChurch, one of the strongest arguments of the Fenian party.  Following\r\nthis declaration came the murder of a policeman in Manchester, when an\r\nattempt was made to rescue two Fenian prisoners.  Three men were\r\nexecuted for the crime, and as the 'Manchester martyrs' they are to be\r\nfound in the calendar of Nationalism.  There was a melodramatic attempt\r\nto blow up a London prison, and thus free a Fenian incarcerated within\r\nits walls.  Everywhere the mention of the name of Ireland produced a\r\nfeeling of panic and an expression of profound contempt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earl of Kimberley]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lord Wodehouse, whose administration, ending in 1866, was\r\nwholly political, acted with rigour and fearlessness.  The Home Rulers\r\nmocked him, issuing imitation proclamations signed 'Woodlouse.'  He\r\nturned aside from signing warrants to welcome, in May, 1865, the Prince\r\nof Wales--afterwards King Edward VII.--to Dublin to open the\r\nInternational Exhibition, but that was almost the only occasion when he\r\nmade a public appearance unassociated with politics.  There was some\r\neffort to maintain the social side of Dublin Castle government, but the\r\ntimes were not favourable to hospitality, and when in 1866 the viceroy\r\nwas succeeded by the Marquis of Abercorn, and took his place in Mr.\r\nGladstone's first ministry as Lord Privy Seal, under his new title of\r\nEarl of {263} Kimberley, there was neither regret nor gratitude\r\nexpressed for his departure.  The Nationalists and their Fenian allies\r\ncould not be expected to show approval or disapproval of persons who\r\nmerely administered the same system.  To them Dublin Castle was the\r\noutward token of England's rule in Ireland, and their object was to\r\ndestroy its existence.\r\n\r\nLord Kimberley died in 1902, aged seventy-six.  He is not remembered\r\nfor his Irish viceroyalty, but as Foreign Secretary under Lord Rosebery\r\nin 1892-94 he displayed an ability that was something above mere\r\nindustry.  He declined to join an alliance which had for its object the\r\ncoercion of Japan after the latter's victory over China, and this\r\nfar-seeing act was the first step towards the Anglo-Japanese alliance\r\nwhich many consider Lord Lansdowne's greatest achievement during his\r\ntenure of the Foreign Office.  Lord Kimberley was Colonial Secretary in\r\nthe days when the affairs of the outer Empire were not considered very\r\nimportant, and a knowledge of the colonies something akin to bad form.\r\nHis administration of Indian affairs was decidedly tame, but he did no\r\nharm.  It was his fate who once had been a member of the strongest\r\nLiberal Cabinet in the history of party government to witness the\r\nLiberal debacle that followed the resignation of the Rosebery\r\nGovernment.  In the palmy days of Liberalism it was his good fortune to\r\nserve under Gladstone--towards the close of his life he sat in the\r\nCabinet of a man who, having won the greatest prize of political life\r\ntoo easily, treated it with {264} contempt, and in doing so wrecked the\r\nparty which enabled him to win some fame as a statesman.  To Lord\r\nKimberley fell the task of leading the Liberal minority in the House of\r\nLords, and when he died in 1902, the Conservative and Unionist party\r\nwas in an apparently impregnable position, and Liberalism was in the\r\ndepths.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Liberal ministry brought Lord Derby to the head of the\r\nGovernment, with Disraeli as his Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The\r\nPrime Minister thereupon asked the Marquis of Abercorn to accept the\r\ndifficult and laborious post of Viceroy of Ireland, and the hazardous\r\nposition was accepted from a sense of duty.  Lord Abercorn was in 1866\r\nfifty-five years of age, and thirty-four years earlier he had married\r\nLady Louisa Russell, a daughter of the sixth Duke of Bedford, another\r\nviceregal family.  The viceroy was a popular landlord, though he, too,\r\nhad a constitutional objection to tenants who would not pay their\r\nrents.  But the respectable classes admired him, and those who knew him\r\npersonally considered that he was the right man for Ireland.  He was\r\nthe proudest man in Ireland, with a flamboyant love of display.\r\nFenianism was most active during his first term, and Abercorn was\r\ncompelled to adopt similar methods in dealing with the trouble as had\r\nbeen part of the Liberal administration of his predecessor.  Ireland\r\nhas always refused to accept the spirit of the English party system,\r\nand whether Liberal or Conservative ministry was in power, Dublin\r\nCastle remained the same.  There were the usual evictions, riots, {265}\r\nmurders, and other crimes scarcely less reprehensible, and the viceroy,\r\nalthough protected to some extent by the Chief Secretary, who was, of\r\ncourse, the mouthpiece of the Irish Government in the House of Commons,\r\nfound himself compelled by force of circumstances to undertake\r\npolitical work against which his soul revolted.  Lord Abercorn was not\r\na man to revel in a display of the power of the police, or even of the\r\ntenacity and strength of the Castle bureaucracy.  He aimed at the\r\nimprovement of the masses, the progress of education, and the\r\ncultivation of the fine arts.  In society the viceroy and the\r\nmarchioness were most popular.  He was an intimate friend of the queen.\r\nNo charge of alienism could be laid against the head of the Irish\r\nHamiltons, and while every other great landlord had his land troubles,\r\nthe tenants of the Marquis of Abercorn had realized in a practical\r\nmanner their indebtedness to their landlord.  If anybody should have\r\nbeen the ideal viceroy Lord Abercorn was the man; but here, again, any\r\nsuccess achieved was purely social, and confined to a small area.  The\r\nunruly state of the country, its increasing poverty, and its record of\r\ncrime, found no palliative in the reign of the proudest of the\r\nHamiltons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prince and Princess of Wales]\r\n\r\nIn April, 1868, the Prince and Princess of Wales visited Dublin, to\r\nprove again that if Ireland had the reputation of being a nation of\r\nrebels, it could be courteous to distinguished visitors.  Lord and Lady\r\nAbercorn received them in Dublin, and there were great rejoicings.  The\r\nexecutive had taken the most elaborate precautions for the safety {266}\r\nof the royal pair, but events proved that they were quite unnecessary,\r\nand Ireland might have been one of the most prosperous countries in the\r\nworld for all the prince and princess saw to the contrary.  Within the\r\nsacred walls of St. Patrick's Cathedral the Lord-Lieutenant presided\r\nover a gorgeous ceremony, which formally created the Prince of Wales a\r\nKnight of St. Patrick, and the banquet that followed in St. Patrick's\r\nHall was one of great splendour.  The dinner brought together not only\r\nall the notables of Ireland, but also the largest gathering of English\r\nand Irish detectives that the Castle has ever contained.  The number of\r\nthe detectives was quite embarrassing, but it was considered necessary,\r\nwith recollections of Manchester and Clerkenwell.  The royal guests\r\nwere ignorant of this part of the programme, however, although the\r\nprince once addressed a question to a gentleman whom he thought was the\r\nviceroy's secretary.  He was not enlightened as to the identity of the\r\ndetective-inspector from London, who was part of his bodyguard.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Disraeli was Prime Minister at the time of the royal visit to\r\nIreland, and he had no difficulty in getting Abercorn a dukedom.  On\r\nAugust 10, 1868, his elevation was announced, and Ireland's only\r\nduke--his Grace of Leinster--was joined by a second wearer of the\r\nstrawberry leaves.  The new dignity had been earned years before Lord\r\nAbercorn lived in Dublin Castle, and by no stretch of official\r\nimagination could it be said to hallmark the Abercorn administration of\r\n1866 to 1868.  The General Election in the latter {267} year displaced\r\nDisraeli, and gave Mr. Gladstone the reins of power, and the Duke of\r\nAbercorn went out with the Tory Government to enjoy himself in\r\nopposition until 1874, when Disraeli tasted the sweets of office again.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Irish Church disestablished]\r\n\r\nWe have Mr. Gladstone's own admission that the Fenian agitation of the\r\nsixties was the primary cause of English interest in the Irish Church,\r\nand in the great land question.  It is one of the truisms of history\r\nthat agitation on unconstitutional methods is more effective than the\r\nemployment of peaceful persuasion.  Catholic Emancipation proved that.\r\nWhen Gladstone took office it was known that he would attempt to create\r\na contented Ireland by disestablishing the Irish Church, and by passing\r\na great Land Act.  He chose as his Irish viceroy Earl Spencer, then an\r\nunknown and untried young man in his thirty-third year.  To be the\r\nrepresentative of the premier in Ireland was the most onerous and\r\ndangerous position in the Government.  The viceroy found society, lay\r\nand clerical, against him, and with the passing of the Land Act of 1870\r\nthe upper-class Irish believed what they had only doubted before--that\r\nGladstone was the worst enemy of Ireland, and that Lord Spencer was his\r\ndangerous satellite.  There is no need to enter into the controversy\r\nthat ensued when Gladstone introduced the Bill disestablishing the\r\nChurch of Ireland, as the Protestant minority was termed absurdly.\r\nArchbishop Trench declared passionately that the disestablishment would\r\n'put to the Irish Protestants the choice between apostasy and\r\nexpatriation, and every {268} man among them who has money or position,\r\nwhen he sees his Church go, will leave the country.  If you do that,'\r\nhe continued, 'you will find the country so difficult to manage that\r\nyou will have to depend upon the gibbet and the sword.'  It would be\r\nunfair to dwell upon the ludicrous moanings of the Church party; they\r\nprophesied not only the extinction of the Irish Protestants, but the\r\nend of Christendom.  We can be content with the knowledge that time has\r\ngiven us of the prosperity and progress of Protestantism in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt is a splendid example of the irony of life to recall Mr. Gladstone's\r\ndeclaration when the telegram arrived at Hawarden, informing him that\r\nan emissary was on his way from Windsor Castle.  'My mission,' he said,\r\n'is to pacify Ireland.'  That may have been true, but Gladstone brought\r\na sword rather than peace to the country which had such a long and\r\nfateful connection with the statesmanship of the great Liberal.  Lord\r\nSpencer, his first viceroy, experienced all the fury of rebellious\r\nNationalism, and during his second viceroyalty had the unfortunate\r\ndistinction of being the governor of a country where no man's life was\r\nsafe, and where murder and outrage were as common as sand.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, anticipating events.  The refusal of Lord Halifax to\r\naccept the viceroyalty had restricted Gladstone's choice.  Liberalism,\r\neven in its mildest state, has never appealed to territorial magnates,\r\nand the Whiggism of Lord Spencer was scarcely the fire-and-thunder\r\nLiberalism {269} of his chief, but he stepped into the breach, and for\r\nthe rest of his life was one of the strongest champions of a political\r\nfaith unpopular amongst his own class.  Born in 1836, and married at\r\nthe age of twenty-two, he brought the courage of youth to bear upon the\r\nIrish situation.  Gladstone never had a more faithful colleague and\r\nDublin Castle a more conscientious occupant.  Dublin society was\r\ninclined to frown upon the viceroy, and there was some talk of a\r\nboycott of the viceregal functions, but Lord and Lady Spencer were\r\nindependent of the support of the official and professional class which\r\nforms what is called society in the capital of Ireland.  A great\r\nEnglish landlord and his wife could create any society they chose,\r\nbeing somewhat in a similar position to the Scotsman who declared that\r\nwherever he sat was the head of the table.  Lord Hartington, better\r\nknown as the Duke of Devonshire, was Chichester Fortescue's successor\r\nas Chief Secretary, and the two noblemen carried out Gladstone's\r\nreforms with a thoroughness that for a time gave the impression that at\r\nlast the Irish nation was to be pacified and made amenable to English\r\nrule.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Land Act of 1870]\r\n\r\nThe disestablishment of the Protestant Church in Ireland was, however,\r\na minor reform compared with the great Land Act of 1870.  This was a\r\nmeasure of reform that took away the breath of the Tory leaders, but it\r\nhas proved a most beneficial act, and when in the course of time it\r\nbecame obsolete, it was a Unionist administration that improved upon\r\nit, and passed an Act which, {270} compared with that of 1870, or even\r\nthat of 1881, out-Gladstoned Gladstone.  It was not a brilliant\r\nsuccess, because it tried to do too much, and, of course, offended both\r\nparties; but as the first attempt on a large scale to settle this\r\nmany-sided question, it deserves a high place in the records of\r\nGladstone's memorable Government of 1868-74.\r\n\r\nAny determined effort to ostracize the viceroy was soon killed by the\r\npresence and influence of Lady Spencer.  She had been no more than\r\ntwenty-four hours in Dublin when she was nicknamed \"Spencer's Fairy\r\nQueen,\" a most flattering description of a great beauty and a charming\r\nwoman.  Lord Spencer's skill as a horseman was in his favour, and his\r\nregular attendance in the chase earned him the respect of a large\r\ncommunity which has a hereditary affection for the noblest of animals.\r\n\r\nCastle seasons were enlivened by visits from the Prince of Wales, the\r\nPrincess Louise, and the Prince Arthur, now the Duke of Connaught;\r\nwhile the important Dublin Exhibition was opened, and numerous Irish\r\nindustries patronized and helped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{271}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nThe fall of the Government was hastened by the Premier's anxiety to\r\nfulfil his pledge to pacify Ireland.  The Church question was settled,\r\nthe land problem on its way to solution, and now Gladstone turned his\r\nattention to the grievances of Roman Catholics on the question of a\r\nuniversity.  The Prime Minister's pose as the only man capable of\r\nsettling Irish affairs had not been strengthened by the passing of a\r\ncoercion act in the spring of 1870, but if he imprisoned Fenians, he\r\ngenerally followed it up by pressing for their release.  And firmly\r\nbelieving that if he conciliated the Roman Catholics he would bring\r\npeace to the country, he introduced a measure into the House of Commons\r\nseeking powers to establish a university acceptable to all classes and\r\ncreeds.  It was defeated by three votes in one of the most memorable\r\nand significant divisions Parliament has known.  Friends and foes\r\nabstained, and friends and foes voted with surprising inconsistency,\r\nbut the net result was the discomfiture of the Gladstonians and the\r\nimmediate resignation of the premier, the latter act prompted, no\r\ndoubt, by the knowledge that there was no other possible leader of a\r\nGovernment in the country.  {272} Mr. Gladstone came back--as he knew\r\nhe would--but the effects of the Irish University bill were felt right\r\ndown to the day that the leader of the Liberal party heard the results\r\nof the General Election of 1874, and realized that his great rival,\r\nBenjamin Disraeli, was at last at the head of a working majority.\r\n\r\nWhen writing of Gladstone's colleagues, it is difficult to resist the\r\ntemptation to turn from them to speak of their chief.  Lord Spencer,\r\nhowever, was something more than a mere official obeying the orders of\r\nhis superior.  His first term in Ireland laid the foundation of his\r\npublic life, and exhibited those principles of devotion to duty, as he\r\nconsidered his duty to be, and a single-minded adherence to the\r\npolitical principles that distinguished him above his changing and\r\nvacillating colleagues.  When Mr. Gladstone proposed his university\r\nreforms, the viceroy worked his hardest, and Dublin Castle witnessed\r\nnumberless interviews between him and representatives of both Churches.\r\nHe saw Cardinal Cullen and obtained his views.  As usual, the Roman\r\nCatholic hierarchy, never doubtful as to its wants, asked too much, but\r\nSpencer listened politely, and in due course informed Gladstone.\r\nDoubtless, the English nobleman failed to understand the extraordinary\r\nmixture of politics and religion that is always part of Irish affairs,\r\nbut he tried to understand and even to sympathize.\r\n\r\nGladstone's defeat in 1874 meant, of course, the viceroy's retirement\r\nfrom Dublin, and if the majority of the members of the Liberal\r\nadministration {273} regretted their defeat, Lord Spencer was not one\r\nof them.  He merited the rest opposition gave him, and for six years\r\nTory noblemen acted as viceroys of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Abercorn's second viceroyalty was quiet and threadbare.\r\nDisraeli was not the man to attempt heroic measures.  Perhaps he\r\nlaboured to avoid Irish affairs, which since the Union had threatened\r\nto monopolize the time of Parliament.  He sent Sir Michael Hicks-Beach,\r\nafterwards Viscount St. Aldwyn, to the Irish office, and trusted to the\r\nviceroy and the Chief Secretary to shield him from the worries created\r\nby the awkward fact that a Prime Minister's duties were not confined to\r\nEngland.  When the Duke of Abercorn sent in his resignation, in\r\nDecember, 1876, owing to the state of his wife's health, Disraeli\r\nprevailed upon another duke to take his place.  This was the sixth Duke\r\nof Marlborough, who had declined the viceroyalty in the first days of\r\nthe Government's existence.  The Duke and Duchess of Abercorn retired\r\ninto private life, popular and respected, the duke living until 1885.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Duke of Marlborough]\r\n\r\nThe incoming Lord-Lieutenant was in his fifty-fifth year when in the\r\nearly days of 1877 he was sworn in as Viceroy of Ireland.  One of\r\nDisraeli's personal friends, the influence of the duke had helped the\r\nPrime Minister from the outer ring of plebeian obscurity into the inner\r\ncircle of Conservative exclusiveness.  Disraeli had a passion for\r\ndukes, although that rank suggested dulness to his bizarre and Oriental\r\nimagination.  Marlborough {274} had been Lord President of the Council\r\nin 1868 during Disraeli's first administration, and he was induced to\r\nreconsider his decision not to join the ministry when the Duke of\r\nAbercorn retired.\r\n\r\nThe Duke and Duchess of Marlborough directed their attention to the\r\namelioration of the lot of the poverty-stricken peasantry, and they\r\nendeavoured also to aid the trade of Ireland.  When the failure of the\r\ncrops brought a famine, the duchess inaugurated a relief fund, which,\r\nwith the help of the Mansion House, London, brought over L170,000 to\r\nthe rescue of the sufferers.  Many other acts of kindness could be\r\nrecorded of them, and although their reign necessarily concluded in\r\nMay, 1880, on the destruction of the Tory Government, they accomplished\r\nmuch in a brief space of time, and, without being great reformers,\r\nachieved something in the way of reform.  Her Excellency had been\r\nbefore her marriage Lady Frances Tempest, and was a daughter of the\r\nthird Marquis of Londonderry.  She was a dignified chatelaine of Dublin\r\nCastle, a fit partner for a great nobleman.  The rumblings of the Home\r\nRule agitation storm could be heard before they vacated the viceregal\r\nposition, for by now Charles Stewart Parnell had arisen to sound a new\r\nbattle-cry for Nationalist Ireland.  The old methods of dead-and-gone\r\nagitators were to be improved upon, new ones invented and exploited,\r\nand a decisive battle fought for Irish independence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Agitation and crime]\r\n\r\nThe records of the day state that the Duke of Marlborough was 'popular'\r\nand 'successful,' but {275} these are the records written by partisans.\r\nA popular viceroy generally means a Lord-Lieutenant who exhibits an\r\namiable weakness to let things remain as they are, and as Marlborough\r\ndid this, he was an especial favourite of the official party.  He was,\r\nhowever, wise in his generation.  Before his time history had taught\r\nthe vital lesson that the viceroy who did his best to please all\r\nparties earned the hatred of all, and the men who ignored the pressing\r\nproblems of the day, and turned his term of office into a social orgy,\r\nwas acclaimed by the unthinking multitudes.  Riots, and evictions, and\r\nmurders, were common enough in the closing months of Marlborough's\r\nviceroyalty, but beyond giving his sanction to the various acts that\r\ndealt with agrarian crimes and the troublous land problem, the viceroy\r\nmade no display of statesmanship or endangered his ducal equanimity.\r\nIt was to the Duke of Marlborough that Disraeli addressed his letter\r\nasking the electors for a fresh mandate.  He lived long enough to feel\r\nthankful that the English electors decided in 1880 to have nothing to\r\ndo with Toryism, and so ordained that, instead of Beaconsfield\r\nnominating a viceroy, the task should be Gladstone's.  During his stay\r\nin Dublin Marlborough had for private secretary Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill.  In 1883 the duke died at the comparatively early age of\r\nsixty-one.\r\n\r\nIt was expected that Lord Spencer would return to Ireland, but he was\r\nselected to fill the decorative post of Lord President of the Council,\r\nand Earl Cowper was sent to cope with Parnell's {276} followers.\r\nCowper was forty-six years of age, and ten years previous to his\r\nappointment had married a daughter of the fourth Lord Northampton.  He\r\nwas a man of great strength of character, a charming host, and famous\r\nfor a temperament that he never allowed to be ruffled.  A perfect host,\r\nand a man of the world endowed with many talents, Earl Cowper might\r\nhave succeeded at almost anything except the one particular task to\r\nwhich he was assigned.  When he arrived in Dublin the country was in a\r\nstate of rebellion, the remarkable success of Parnell in uniting all\r\nshades of Nationalists under his leadership having the result of\r\npresenting the most formidable opposition to the Government yet\r\nexperienced in the history of both countries.  Parnell had entered\r\nParliament in 1875, and four years later was popularly acclaimed the\r\nnew leader of the Irish people.  His lightest words were sufficient to\r\nrender null and void the most important Act of Parliament, his orders\r\nwere reverenced and obeyed by a vast majority of his countrymen.  When\r\nLord Cowper took up his duties Parnell was the ruler of Ireland, and\r\nthe efforts of the English Government to maintain a semblance of\r\nauthority would have been ludicrous if the results had not been so\r\ntragic.  Landlords, agents, and tenants were murdered in cold blood,\r\npeaceful citizens were dragged into foul conspiracy by their bullying\r\nneighbours, and Parnell went about in open defiance of the Government,\r\npreaching rebellion and its ghastly accompaniments wherever he came.\r\nMr. W. E. Forster, the Chief Secretary, induced his official chief to\r\nadvise the {277} Cabinet to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act, and when\r\nGladstone hesitated, a practical demonstration of its necessity was\r\nfurnished by the arrest of Parnell charged with seditious conspiracy,\r\nhis abortive trial owing to the disagreement of the Dublin jury, and\r\nthe Irish leader's consequent triumph over his opponents.  Then the\r\npower to imprison without trial was given to the Irish executive, and\r\nsoon the gaols of the country were full to overflowing.  With the\r\nsuspension of the Habeas Corpus Act the Land League was born, and a new\r\nterror to officialism created.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Land League]\r\n\r\nLord Cowper's viceroyalty has been tersely described as occupying 'two\r\ndismal years--the most dismal of the nineteenth century.'  His own life\r\nwas threatened, elaborate plots to terminate the Chief Secretary's\r\nexistence were discovered as fast as an overworked detective department\r\ncould unravel its agents' reports, and from all over the country\r\nmurders were reported until it seemed that all sense of decency had\r\nlong since departed from the country.  Encouraged by the success of the\r\nLand League, a fresh series of revolting crimes shocked civilization.\r\nTerrified English ministers tried the effects of another Land Act, and\r\nin 1881 it was placed in the statute-book.  This was a great triumph\r\nfor the Land League, and was regarded by its members as the\r\njustification of its existence.  Again a desire to conciliate had been\r\ninterpreted as a sign of weakness.\r\n\r\nThe new Land Act did not decrease the agitation, and on October 12,\r\n1881, a five-hour sitting of the Cabinet resulted in an order to the\r\nviceroy {278} to have Parnell arrested under the Coercion Act.  The\r\nIrish leader was thereupon taken to Kilmainham Gaol, and remained there\r\nfor six months.  Optimists expected that this bold stroke would\r\nintimidate the intimidators; it had an opposite effect.  Mr. Forster\r\nhad to report that crime was actually on the increase, and that the\r\nLand Act had not been of the slightest use.  It was easy to imprison\r\nParnell, but the spirit of the movement remained abroad in the people.\r\n\r\nIn despair Gladstone turned to Parnell, clutching at the straw\r\npresented by one of the Irishman's friends that Parnell was willing to\r\ndiscuss terms of peace with the Government.  The premier was willing,\r\nanxious, in fact, to remove the reproach from his Government the state\r\nof Ireland entailed, and he sent Forster to open negotiations with the\r\nprisoner, who was a dictator.  When Lord Cowper heard of the\r\npreliminaries to what became known as the Kilmainham Treaty he\r\nresigned, rightly deeming it demeaning and humiliating for responsible\r\nministers to treat with a man who had roused the passions of the\r\nuncontrollables, and who, to his lasting disgrace, never denounced the\r\ncrimes the Land League produced until the greatest crime of all\r\nconvinced him that sometimes murder is a mistake.  Mr. Gladstone\r\nappealed to Lord Spencer, a member of his Cabinet, and an experienced\r\nadministrator of Irish affairs, to take up the most dangerous and\r\nirksome post in the Government.  The earl could not, of course, refuse,\r\nfor refusal in the circumstances could have been construed into a\r\nconfession of cowardice.  {279} He had agreed in the Cabinet to the\r\n_pourparlers_ with Parnell, and he was determined to give the Irish\r\nleader an opportunity of retrieving the blunders of the Land League,\r\nand doing so with a show of victory over the Government, which did not\r\ncare about its reputation on Irish matters provided an end was made of\r\nthe reign of the murderers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: State of the country]\r\n\r\nImmediate events justified Lord Cowper up to the hilt, who must have\r\nwatched with a grim satisfaction the terrible results of Mr.\r\nGladstone's Irish policy in the early eighties.  When the time came\r\nthat disclosed Mr. Gladstone as the champion of Home Rule, Lord Cowper\r\ntook a leading part in the forces arrayed against his old chief.  At a\r\nmeeting in a London theatre addressed by Lord Salisbury and the Marquis\r\nof Hartington, Lord Cowper was in the chair, and his presence was a\r\ntower of strength to the cause.  After the final defeat of Liberal Home\r\nRule he dropped out of public life, and at his death--on July 19,\r\n1905--he was almost forgotten by his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThere is an admirable and eloquent description in Viscount Morley's\r\n'Life of Gladstone' of the condition of Ireland when Lord Spencer began\r\nhis second viceroyalty: 'In 1882 Ireland seemed to be literally a\r\nsociety on the verge of dissolution.  The Invincibles still roved with\r\nknives about the streets of Dublin.  Discontent had been stirred in the\r\nranks of the Royal Irish Constabulary, and a dangerous mutiny broke out\r\nin the metropolitan force.  Over half of the country the demoralization\r\nof every class, the terror, the fierce hatred, {280} the universal\r\ndistrust, had grown to an incredible pitch.  The moral cowardice of\r\nwhat ought to have been the governing class was astounding.  The\r\nlandlords would hold meetings and agree not to go beyond a certain\r\nabatement, and then they would go individually and privately offer to\r\nthe tenant a greater abatement.  Even the agents of the law and the\r\nCourts were shaken in their duty.  The power of random arrest and\r\ndetention under the Coercion Act of 1881 had not improved the morale of\r\nmagistrates and police.  The Sheriff would let the word get out that he\r\nwas coming to make a seizure, and profess surprise that the cattle had\r\nvanished.  The whole countryside turned out thousands in half the\r\ncounties in Ireland to attend flaming meetings, and if a man did not\r\nattend angry neighbours trooped up to know the reason why.  The clergy\r\nhardly stirred a finger to restrain the wildness of the storm; some did\r\ntheir best to raise it.  All that was what Lord Spencer had to deal\r\nwith, the very foundations of the social fabric rocking.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earl Spencer, K.G.]\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Earl Spencer was not pleasing to Mr. Forster, and he\r\nsent in his resignation, his ostensible reason being the proposed\r\nsuspension of the Coercion Act, which had enabled the Irish executive\r\nto imprison Parnell.  Forster, however, was more concerned with his own\r\nstatus.  Lord Spencer would retain his seat in the Cabinet, which meant\r\nthat the Chief Secretary's position would be of less importance than\r\nhitherto.  The Prime Minister accepted the resignation without more\r\nthan the expected and usual formal expressions {281} of regret.  Lord\r\nFrederick Cavendish was selected to succeed him, and on the same day\r\nthe viceroy and the Chief Secretary crossed the Channel.  This was the\r\nfatal May 6, 1882.  Lord Spencer was sworn in at Dublin Castle, and\r\nduring the afternoon he was engaged in 'that grim apartment in Dublin\r\nCastle, where successive Secretaries spend unshining hours in saying\r\n\"No\" to impossible demands and hunting for plausible answers to\r\ninsoluble riddles.'  At five o'clock the Viceroy started to ride to\r\nPhoenix Park, and at six Lord Frederick Cavendish followed.  In the\r\nPark he was overtaken by Mr. Burke, the Under-Secretary, and a few\r\nminutes later both men were foully murdered within sight of the\r\nViceregal Lodge.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Phoenix Park murders]\r\n\r\nLord Spencer wrote the following account of his knowledge of the\r\nmurders--a statement inspired by a report that he had actually\r\nwitnessed the affray and innocently regarded it as an unimportant\r\nscuffle:\r\n\r\n'It is said that I saw the murder.  That is not so.  I had asked\r\nCavendish to drive to the Park with me.  He said he would not; he would\r\nrather walk with Burke.  Of course, if he had come with me it would not\r\nhave happened.  I then rode to the Park with a small escort--I think,\r\nmy aide-de-camp and a trooper.  Curiously enough, I stopped to look at\r\nthe polo-match which Carey described, so that he and I seem to have\r\nbeen together on that occasion.  I then turned towards the Viceregal\r\nLodge.  The ordinary and more direct way for me to go was over the very\r\nscene {282} of the murder.  Had I so gone the murders would not\r\nprobably have been committed.  Three men coming up would have prevented\r\nanything of that kind.  But I made a slight detour, and got to the\r\nlodge another way.  When I reached the Lodge I sat down near the window\r\nand began to read some papers.  Suddenly I heard a shriek which I shall\r\nnever forget.  I seem to hear it now; it is always in my ears.  This\r\nshriek was repeated again and again.  I got up to look out.  I saw a\r\nman rushing along.  He jumped over the palings, and dashed up to the\r\nLodge shouting: \"Mr. Burke and Lord Frederick Cavendish are killed!\"\r\nThere was great confusion, and immediately I rushed out; but someone of\r\nthe household stopped me, saying that it might be a ruse to get me out,\r\nand advising me to wait and make inquiries.  Of course, the inquiries\r\nwere made, and the truth soon discovered.  I always deplore my\r\nunfortunate decision to make that detour, always feeling that if I had\r\ngone to the Lodge by the ordinary way the murders would have been\r\nprevented.  I have said that I did not see the murder, but my servant\r\ndid.  He was upstairs, and saw a scuffle going on, but, of course, did\r\nnot know what it was about.'\r\n\r\nNo political crime produced as great a sensation as these senseless and\r\nstupid murders.  The news came to London late in the evening, when\r\nMinisters were dining out.  The Home Secretary was attending a\r\ndinner-party at the Austrian Embassy when a messenger hurried in to\r\ntell of the dreadful calamity, and very soon all his colleagues were in\r\npossession of the dreadful tidings.\r\n\r\n{283}\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Another Coercion Act]\r\n\r\nThe murders meant the end of the policy of conciliation, and the House\r\nof Commons gave a ready assent to another Coercion Act.  Parnell wrote\r\nto Gladstone offering to resign his seat, but the premier was not the\r\nperson to judge members of the House of Commons.  With perfect courtesy\r\nhe acknowledged the feeling that had prompted the Irish leader's\r\nletter, though he must have known that if there had been no Land League\r\nthere would have been no Phoenix Park murders.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most difficult of tasks to write familiar history in\r\nan original manner.  The worthless lives of the assassins paid the\r\npenalty of the law, and a crude justice was meted out to Carey, the\r\ninformer, who was shot dead by O'Donnell on board the liner which was\r\ntaking him to safety.  O'Donnell was brought back from South Africa and\r\nexecuted, but the punishment of the actual murderers was a small part\r\nof the after-effects of the whole disastrous episode.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the party of progress by murder and revolution\r\ncast off the sackcloth it had donned on the deaths of Mr. Burke and\r\nLord Frederick Cavendish.  The viceroy, with his back against the wall,\r\nwas compelled to fight for his own life as well as for the existence of\r\nlaw and order.  The Parnellites, confident in their well-established\r\nreputation for obstruction and their followers' capacity for riot,\r\nlooked forward to the day when they could dictate terms to one of the\r\ngreat political parties in England.  The granting of an extended\r\nfranchise in 1884 had cleared the {284} way for an all-Nationalist\r\nIreland.  The Liberal party was, as usual, blindly handing to their\r\nopponents weapons to be used for the destruction of Liberalism.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was always a difficult leader to follow, but when he was\r\ndealing with Irish affairs his movements resembled the lines created by\r\na maze.  With the best of motives he performed the worst and most\r\nfoolish of actions, and Lord Spencer's task became more difficult every\r\nday.  The Government was defeated on the Budget, and a prolonged crisis\r\nensued.  But before the resignation of the Cabinet Lord Spencer had to\r\ndeal with the notorious Maamtrasna case.  This was, in brief, the trial\r\nof some forty persons for the murder of an entire family.  Twenty-one\r\nof the convicted prisoners were executed, and it was alleged that some\r\nof these were innocent.  A fierce debate absorbed three days in the\r\nHouse of Commons, and later on, when Lord Salisbury was premier and Sir\r\nMichael Hicks-Beach was leader of the Commons, a motion was brought\r\nforward censuring the administration of Earl Spencer.  The only result\r\nwas to draw public attention once more to the fearless manner in which\r\nthe viceroy had carried out his duties, and even Tory members had to\r\nrise and protest in forcible language against the action of Tory\r\nleaders in condemning the man who risked his life to maintain law and\r\norder.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Spencer's character]\r\n\r\nA month after his retirement from the viceroyalty 300 members of both\r\nhouses of Parliament attended a banquet in his honour.  It was {285}\r\nnoticed that Mr. Chamberlain was absent, but the presence of Lord\r\nHartington in the chair and Mr. Bright among the company testified\r\neloquently to the general opinion of Lord Spencer's conduct of Irish\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThe three years of office that remained to Lord Spencer subsequent to\r\nthe Phoenix Park murders brought into prominence in Irish affairs Mr.\r\nG. O. Trevelyan and Mr. Campbell-Bannerman, successive Chief\r\nSecretaries.  Neither was a pronounced success.  The only person in the\r\nlimelight was the viceroy.  His personal bravery dismayed his cowardly\r\nfoes, who, judging human nature by their own standard, could not but\r\nstand in awe of the man who could ride to hounds while the country\r\nround seethed with assassins.  Trevelyan could earn the title of\r\n'jelly-fish,' while Campbell-Bannerman utilized the position of Chief\r\nSecretary to try and convince his superiors that he could do something\r\nbetter if given greater opportunities.  The viceroy was firm, just,\r\nknowing no fear and showing no favour.  The fury of his opponents found\r\nexpression in the attempt of an hysterical woman to horsewhip him, but\r\nshe got no farther than stopping the horses and brandishing her whip.\r\nHe was first called 'Rufus' because of his red beard, but this being\r\ndeemed too genial, was changed to the 'Red Earl,' and accepted as an\r\nomen of his alleged 'red policy' of punishing murderers by hanging\r\nthem.  It was hinted that the Lord Chancellor, Sir Edward Sullivan, was\r\nthe power behind the viceregal throne, and when the great lawyer died\r\nthe first {286} favourable opportunity that presented itself to taunt\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant with leniency towards the criminal political\r\nclasses he was declared to have lost his backbone.  On one occasion it\r\nwas thought that he was suffering from lumbago because he was seen\r\npressing his back with his hands; but a malicious wit declared that it\r\nwas only 'His Excellency feeling for his backbone.'  The joke would\r\nhave been more effective if it contained just a grain of truth to\r\nflavour it, but if there was one charge that could not be levelled\r\nagainst Lord Spencer it was this taunt of lack of firmness.  His only\r\npiece of good fortune was the submission of the Irish bishops to the\r\nPope, who had censured them for disloyalty.  This was a great help to\r\nthe castle.  A keen pleasure to the viceroy and a cause of anxiety to\r\nthe police was a visit paid to Lord Spencer by the Prince of Wales on\r\nApril 8, 1885.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1885 Lord Salisbury formed a Government, and appointed\r\nLord Carnarvon Viceroy of Ireland.  Within eight months a General\r\nElection placed Mr. Gladstone in power once more, and Lord Aberdeen\r\nspent the few but extremely critical months of life vouchsafed to the\r\nLiberal party until Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule Bill split up his\r\nfollowers, and another General Election endorsed Lord Salisbury's claim\r\nthat the Conservatives and Unionists represented the real opinion of\r\nthe country on the question of Ireland and its government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defeat of the Home Rule Bill]\r\n\r\nLord Spencer was President of the Council in 1885, and in 1892, when\r\nMr. Gladstone became {287} Prime Minister for the fourth and last time,\r\nhe was given the post of First Lord of the Admiralty.  That ministry\r\nbrought in another Home Rule Bill, and passed it through the Commons;\r\nbut the House of Lords rejected it by the overwhelming majority of 378,\r\nthe actual figures being 419 for its rejection and 41 against.  Mr.\r\nGladstone did not appeal to the country, and thus Home Rule passed out\r\nof the Liberal repertoire for nineteen years.\r\n\r\nIf Queen Victoria had consulted Mr. Gladstone on the question of a\r\nsuccessor, he would have advised Lord Spencer's selection.  Her\r\nMajesty, however, sent for that brilliant dilettante, Lord Rosebery,\r\nand Lord Spencer remained on at the Admiralty.  There was some talk of\r\nthe premiership for him shortly before the resignation of Mr. Balfour's\r\nMinistry at the close of 1905, but by then he was a spent force, worn\r\nout and ill.  He could not join Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Cabinet,\r\nbut he lent it his moral support, and that was not the least important\r\nfactor in bringing to reason the members of the egregious Liberal\r\nImperialist League, who at first viewed with suspicion the new premier,\r\nand then rushed with one accord to be received into the strangest\r\npolitical fold ever presided over by a Liberal shepherd.  Lord Spencer\r\ndied in 1910 at the age of seventy-four, and it can be said of him, as\r\nof the late Duke of Devonshire, that he could have risen to greater\r\nheights had he not been born with a sense of modesty adorned by a good\r\nnature that permitted younger men to pass him, and left him without a\r\n{288} trace of rancour or bitterness.  He had the satisfaction of\r\nwitnessing the amazing triumph of the Liberal party, and could die with\r\nthe knowledge that it savoured of the Gladstonian Liberalism of the\r\nmiddle eighties and the early nineties--the Liberalism he fought for\r\nand in whose interest he had sacrificed his best years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{289}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nLord Carnarvon was sworn in as Lord-Lieutenant on July 7, 1885, and on\r\nJanuary 12, 1886, he tendered his resignation, departing from the\r\ncountry thirteen days later.  It was an unusually brief, yet an\r\nexceptionally interesting, viceroyalty.  He was rightfully regarded as\r\na man of fastidious honour and sincerity.  On two occasions he had\r\nresigned Cabinet rank because of conscientious objections to the policy\r\nof his leaders, and there was scarcely anybody among the statesmen of\r\nhis time who commanded greater respect and confidence.  The action of\r\nLord Salisbury in giving him the viceroyalty was rightfully interpreted\r\nto mean that the Tory Prime Minister realized fully the gravity of the\r\nsituation in Ireland.  Lord Carnarvon might have had a more exalted and\r\npowerful position in the ministry.  He accepted the viceroyalty in the\r\nsame spirit of anxiety to benefit his fellows that had been\r\ncharacteristic of him since his entry into public life nearly thirty\r\nyears before.  He was now fifty-four years of age, and was known to\r\nfame as the author of the act that consolidated the British possessions\r\nin North America in 1867.  Again Colonial Secretary in 1874, the\r\nforeign policy of the Cabinet did not {290} meet with his approval, and\r\nhe resigned, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach succeeding him.\r\n\r\nLord Carnarvon's state entry into Dublin evoked a display of\r\nenthusiasm, from all classes that indicated clearly the hopes of the\r\npeople for something brilliant from his administration.  Lady Carnarvon\r\nwas received for her own sake, as well as for that of her husband.  She\r\npossessed all the arts of the successful leader of society, and she\r\nexercised them fully while in Ireland.  There was keen competition to\r\nmake the acquaintance of the viceroy and his wife, and Dublin Castle\r\nseemed likely to experience something quite different to its troubles\r\nof the previous five years.  But the wise knew that the imminent\r\nGeneral Election would in all probability terminate the reign of Lord\r\nCarnarvon.  The Salisbury ministry was a 'Cabinet of Caretakers,' and\r\nthe most that could be hoped for was the viceroy's return within a few\r\nyears when the electors had had another opportunity of passing a\r\nverdict upon Gladstonian Liberalism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Carnarvon and Parnell]\r\n\r\nLord Carnarvon, however, quickly upset the equanimity of the prophets.\r\nWhatever may have been his own doubts about the durability of his\r\nposition, he startled friends and foes alike by arranging for an\r\ninterview with Charles Stewart Parnell.  A Tory Lord-Lieutenant\r\ndebating the policy of his Government with the Irish leader was even\r\nmore productive of astonishment than the sight of Parnell accepting a\r\nplace in the Government would have been.  The interview was kept a\r\nsecret for a time, but it was too {291} important to escape disclosure\r\nand debate, and the result of the General Election of\r\nNovember-December, 1885, hastened the acrimonious and puzzling\r\ndiscussion, with its sequel of denials and denunciations.  The scene of\r\nthe momentous interview was a London drawing-room.  The viceroy, the\r\nmoment he was alone with Parnell, appears to have taken the trouble to\r\nexplain elaborately--perhaps too elaborately--his adherence to Unionist\r\nprinciples.  As the representative of the queen, he could not listen to\r\none word involving the separation of the two countries; as a Tory\r\nminister, he did not expect any result from the interview, and he did\r\nnot even hope for an agreement; while further, to protect himself and\r\nhis colleagues, he assured Mr. Parnell that he was acting entirely upon\r\nhis own responsibility, and as an individual, and not as a Cabinet\r\nminister.\r\n\r\nDespite these preliminary precautions, the Irish leader came away from\r\nthe meeting under the impression that the Tory party were willing to\r\ngrant Ireland an assembly giving it complete control of its own\r\naffairs, and also a measure of land reform that would settle that\r\ndifficult problem.  Of course, the price to be paid for this was to be\r\nthe Irish vote.  On the other hand, Lord Carnarvon most emphatically\r\ncontradicted this interpretation of what had passed between them.\r\nNevertheless, Mr. Parnell adhered to his version.\r\n\r\nThe General Election of November-December, 1885, did not give either of\r\nthe English parties an independent majority.  Of Liberals there were\r\n{292} 335, Tories numbered 249; and 86 Irish Home Rulers, all followers\r\nof Mr. Parnell, held the balance of power.  Mr. Gladstone was now a\r\nHome Ruler, and a Bill for establishing a separate legislature for\r\nIreland was introduced.  It was in the early days of Mr. Gladstone's\r\nconversion to the cause that Mr. Parnell hurled a charge against the\r\nTory party of having at one time been willing to purchase the Irish\r\nvote by an eleventh-hour conversion to Home Rule.  The charge was\r\ndenied indignantly, and then the Nationalist leader named Lord\r\nCarnarvon as the Tory emissary.  The ex-viceroy explained his position\r\nin the House of Lords.  This was on June 10--three days after Mr.\r\nParnell's speech in the Commons.  The latter at once replied in a\r\nletter to the _Times_ of June 12.  It is worth reproducing:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Tory Party and Home Rule]\r\n\r\n'Lord Carnarvon proceeded to say that he had sought the interview for\r\nthe purpose of ascertaining my views regarding--should he call it?--a\r\nconstitution for Ireland.  But I soon found out that he had brought me\r\nthere in order that he might communicate to me his own views upon the\r\nmatter, as well as ascertain mine.  In reply to an inquiry as to a\r\nproposal which had been made to build up a central legislative body\r\nupon the foundation of county boards, I told him that I thought this\r\nwould be working in the wrong direction, and would not be accepted by\r\nIreland; that the central legislative body should be a Parliament in\r\nname and in fact.  Lord Carnarvon assured me that this was his own view\r\nalso, and he strongly appreciated the importance of giving {293} due\r\nweight to the sentiment of the Irish in this matter.  He had certain\r\nsuggestions to this end, taking the Colonial model as a basis, which\r\nstruck me as being the result of much thought and knowledge of the\r\nsubject.  At the conclusion of the conversation, which lasted more than\r\nan hour, and to which Lord Carnarvon was very much the larger\r\ncontributor, I left him, believing that I was in complete accord with\r\nhim regarding the main outlines of a settlement conferring a\r\nlegislature upon Ireland.'\r\n\r\nThe viceroy's explanation of this was more general than particular.  He\r\nmust have been satisfied with Lord Salisbury's verdict that he had\r\nconducted the interview with Mr. Parnell 'with perfect discretion,' but\r\nall the same it was many years before the Tory party lived down the\r\nallegation that had he wished Parnell could have purchased it lock,\r\nstock, and barrel, for service in the Home Rule cause.\r\n\r\nIn social circles Lord Carnarvon's popularity never waned.  He was\r\nsupposed to be that contradiction in terms, 'a Tory Home Ruler,' but he\r\nwas only a high-minded gentleman who made a genuine attempt to deal\r\nwith the Irish problem.  It was yet another instance of a viceroy\r\nrisking peace and popularity by trying to be impartial.  One of his\r\nopponents in Dublin expressed amazement that he should 'bother his head\r\nabout Home Rule when he had the viceroyalty and a beautiful wife.'  It\r\nis not to his discredit that he failed, and it must be remembered that\r\nhe paid a price for his interest in Ireland.  The General Election\r\nplaced {294} Mr. Gladstone in power with the aid of the Nationalists,\r\nbut Gladstone soon committed political suicide, and Lord Salisbury\r\nreturned for a six years' lease of power.  He did not invite Lord\r\nCarnarvon to join his Cabinet, and at fifty-five the earl passed from\r\nthe political stage.  All he gained by his brief association with\r\nIreland was the degree of LL.D. from Dublin University, when he replied\r\nto the Public Orator's congratulations with an elegant Latin speech\r\nthat amazed the dons by reason of its splendour and faultlessness.\r\nLord Carnarvon died in 1890, only fifty-nine, but with a generous\r\nrecord of work in the public service behind him.  Never a party hack\r\nnor a slave to political shibboleths, always an individualist and a\r\nthinker, it was scarcely a fault if his good nature led him into an\r\nunfortunate attempt to reconcile the irreconcilable.  He came to\r\nIreland with no previous experience of the country and its people, and\r\nso he judged them by the standard applied to average men and women.  We\r\nhave been told by an authority that the Celtic temperament is\r\ndestructive, and not constructive, and the facts of history confirm\r\nhim.  Lord Carnarvon forgot this, and therefore laid himself open to\r\nthe charge that he was surrendering to Parnellism and reform by crime,\r\nand at the same time leading the Tory party to destruction.  But\r\npolitical catch-phrases are usually the work of the unthinking and the\r\nillogical, and the only mistake he made was the common one of being a\r\nlittle too much in advance of his time.  The Tory party has travelled\r\nmany Irish miles since the day an {295} Irish viceroy and Parnell\r\nexchanged their opinions in a London drawing-room.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Earl of Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nThe General Election of 1885 swept Liberalism out of Ireland, and gave\r\nthe House of Commons eighty-six Nationalists, the remainder of the\r\nIrish members representing the opinions of the Unionist and\r\nConservative party.  Mr. Gladstone had to solve the problem created by\r\nthe indecisive election, and as he finally decided to cast in his lot\r\nwith the Home Rulers, he formed a Government--his third--and appointed\r\nthe Earl of Aberdeen Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, Mr. John Morley--now\r\nViscount Morley--entering the Cabinet for the first time as Chief\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen was born on August 3, 1847, and in 1870 succeeded to the\r\nearldom--the seventh to hold the title.  Associated from his earliest\r\ndays with the great Liberal statesman, he had always enjoyed his\r\nfriendship and confidence.  It was to Lord and Lady Aberdeen's London\r\nresidence in the eighties--Dollis Hill, near Willesden--that Mr.\r\nGladstone went to seek repose after giving up his London house,\r\nrecording in his diary that he felt too timid at seventy-seven to think\r\nof acquiring another London home.  When in 1894 he resigned the\r\npremiership, it was at Dollis Hill that he spent a few days in rest and\r\nquiet.  Ever a stanch and discriminating friend, Mr. Gladstone was\r\ndelighted to bestow the viceroyalty upon Lord Aberdeen, and\r\naccordingly, on February 10, 1886, he was sworn in at Dublin Castle.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to write of contemporaries without revealing\r\ntraces of prejudice or {296} partiality.  Lord Aberdeen's Liberalism\r\nwas moulded by Mr. Gladstone, who was his political mentor; and Lady\r\nAberdeen, his clever and energetic wife, has always displayed a\r\nmasculine knowledge of politics and politicians.  She was a Miss Ishbel\r\nMarjoribanks before her marriage in 1877, and from all accounts seems\r\nto have been a Home Ruler before Mr. Gladstone's conversion.  When she\r\nentered Dublin in 1886 as the viceroy's wife she was under thirty, but\r\nalready had achieved considerable fame as a determined politician, a\r\nphilanthropist who had initiated common-sense methods in dealings with\r\nthe grave problems of ill-health and poverty, and a loyal friend.  She\r\nentered with zest into the social pleasures of Ireland's capital, and\r\npractised the arts of the vice-queen which she has since brought to\r\nperfection in Canada and in Dublin.\r\n\r\nTheir hospitality was generous, their popularity boundless.  The chosen\r\nof Gladstone could not but be an idol with the masses.  Until coached\r\nby their suspicious chieftains, the rank and file of Nationalism\r\nidolized the viceroy and his wife.  The Lord Mayor of Dublin and the\r\nleading citizens voiced the opinions of the people, and the 'Union of\r\nHearts' appeared to be accomplished.  At last Liberalism seemed to have\r\nwon the allegiance of the Irish.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Lady Aberdeen was considerable, and she helped to earn\r\nsuccess for the viceregal party.  An ardent politician, she never made\r\nthe mistake of subordinating the hostess to the politician, and at her\r\nfunctions all classes and {297} creeds met.  It may be necessary here\r\nto state that the story which has been in circulation some years,\r\ndescribing how Lady Aberdeen was informed by the late Lord Morris that\r\n'herself and the waiters, bedad!' were the only Home Rulers in the\r\nroom, is a wicked and malicious lie.  The alleged incident never took\r\nplace, for Lady Aberdeen is not in the habit of introducing politics\r\nduring dinner-parties and canvassing for opinions when entertaining.\r\nLord Morris was the author of many witty sayings, and he does not\r\nrequire the aid of the unscrupulous to perpetuate his memory.  His\r\nsayings will live without the help of that type of person who delights\r\nin associating persons of eminence with their jokes, well aware that\r\nbecause of their position they are compelled to ignore their slanderers.\r\n\r\nWhile history was being made with startling rapidity in England, Lord\r\nAberdeen continued to carry out the duties of his exalted office.  But\r\nthe Liberal party was by now smashed to atoms.  Mr. Gladstone was\r\nacting like a broken and disappointed man, and the life of the ministry\r\nthreatened at any time to cease.  It was merely a question of time for\r\nthe Tory party and the rebellious Liberals to amalgamate and turn out\r\nthe Gladstone Government.\r\n\r\nOn July 20, 1886, Mr. Gladstone resigned, and Lord and Lady Aberdeen\r\nleft Ireland, and it was now the turn of the Tory-Liberal-Unionist\r\ncoalition to show what they could do in Ireland--the land of\r\nopportunities of which no one seemed capable of taking advantage.  Lord\r\nSalisbury had {298} already stated his views with characteristic\r\nbluntness.  During the debate on the Home Rule Bill of 1886 he forgot\r\nthat he had not a reputation for humour, and informed his audience that\r\nthe Irish were like the Hottentots, incapable of governing themselves,\r\nwhile he suggested that the best plan for Ireland would be the\r\napplication for twenty years of a stringent Coercion Act.  The question\r\nof the Imperial contribution towards the setting up of a Parliament in\r\nDublin he touched upon lightly by suggesting that the money would be\r\nbetter employed in aiding the emigration of a million Irishmen.\r\n\r\nThis was the statesman who was given the opportunity of putting into\r\npractice his theories of Irish administration.  There was some\r\ncuriosity as to the new viceroy, and when Lord Salisbury chose the\r\nMarquis of Londonderry the nervous felt more relieved.  The premier had\r\nselected a safe rather than a brilliant Lord-Lieutenant, and one who\r\nwas capable of perpetrating as few blunders as any of his Tory\r\ncontemporaries.  Sir Michael Hicks-Beach emphasized the new importance\r\nof the Irish Secretaryship by accepting it, and, as he had been\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer in the previous Salisbury Cabinet, his\r\naction was regarded as a generous one.  It was a remarkable innovation\r\nto send a tried statesman to Dublin, for it had been the custom for\r\nmany years to utilize the position as a sort of preparatory school for\r\nthe Cabinet.  It was Sir Michael's second attempt, but this was only a\r\nhalf-hearted one.  Two Royal Commissions were appointed--one {299} to\r\nreport on the land question, the other to examine into the material\r\nresources of the country.  Lord Cowper, an ex-viceroy, presided over\r\nthe first.  Lord Salisbury was, indeed, making a worthy attempt to\r\neffect the political salvation of the Hottentots by Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe viceroy, Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, sixth Marquis of\r\nLondonderry, was thirty-four years of age, and had before his\r\nsuccession to the peerage in 1884 represented County Down in Parliament\r\nfor six years.  As a descendant of the second marquis, who earned\r\nundying notoriety by his destruction of the so-called Irish Parliament,\r\nhe was naturally of interest to all whose affairs brought them into\r\nclose touch with Ireland.  He was an Irish landlord, the husband of a\r\nclever, ambitious woman, a daughter of the premier earl of England.\r\nThey had married in 1875, and she was a leading Tory hostess when they\r\ntransferred their headquarters from Londonderry House, Park Lane, to\r\nDublin Castle and the Viceregal Lodge for a period of three years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Balfour as Chief Secretary]\r\n\r\nThey were stirring times, but the viceroy, by a curious chance, was\r\nable to stand aloof.  The resignation of Sir Michael Hicks-Beach in the\r\nMarch following the arrival of Lord Londonderry brought the Prime\r\nMinister's nephew, Mr. A. J. Balfour, over as Chief Secretary.  We know\r\nhow he made his years in Ireland peculiarly his own, obscuring our view\r\nof the viceroy until at times it seems that there was only a shadow\r\nbehind the frail-looking personality that dominated Ireland in his\r\ncapacity of Chief Secretary.  'Bloody' {300} Balfour, they called him,\r\nand plotted against his life, much to the annoyance of the viceroy, who\r\ndetested fuss, and never could understand the prevailing passion for\r\npolitical principles.  Mr. Balfour answered force with force, and,\r\nremembering the history of attempts at conciliation, he went boldly and\r\nfearlessly for the criminals, their patrons and instigators.  Another\r\nCoercion Bill was framed, and, empowered by it, he sent about thirty\r\nmembers of Parliament to gaol, while evictions and murder continued to\r\nbe reported, and Parnellism became synonymous with crime.\r\n\r\nA visit from Prince Albert Victor and Prince George towards the end of\r\nJune, 1887, was appreciated by both viceroy and people.  The event had\r\nall the charm of spontaneity and unexpectedness, and Lord and Lady\r\nLondonderry had the one opportunity of their viceroyalty to show what\r\nthey could do as representatives of the Queen of England.  There was a\r\nbrilliant State banquet in the famous old dining-room of Dublin Castle,\r\nwhere the leading men of the country paid their respects to the then\r\nsecond heir to the throne and the youthful Prince who was destined by\r\nFate to ascend the throne.  A review in the famous and superb Phoenix\r\nPark was another feature of the visit that must have appealed to the\r\nviceroy as an oasis does to the traveller in the desert.  Not that Lord\r\nLondonderry took a too prominent part in the inevitable political and\r\nagrarian troubles of his reign.  He left those to the efficient and\r\nindomitable Mr. Balfour, while he pursued the even way of life, gently\r\npatronizing the elect, and {301} good-humouredly tolerating the\r\nnon-elect who are the clamouring and unsought satellites of every\r\nViceroy of Ireland.  Lady Londonderry, who is clever enough to deserve\r\na better title than that of mere giver of dinners, softened the\r\ncrudities of office and gained a popularity in Ireland not confined to\r\nher political friends--a rare achievement in a confessedly party woman.\r\nShe is the author of a study of Viscount Castlereagh, second Marquis of\r\nLondonderry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mitchelstown affray]\r\n\r\nThe affray at Mitchelstown in the September of 1887 was dealt with by\r\nMr. Balfour with his usual splendid disregard for public opinion, and\r\nit was succeeded by the Parnell Commission.  During these historic\r\nincidents the viceroy remained in the background, jogging amiably\r\nalong, and no doubt thanking Heaven that had cast his lot in pleasanter\r\ntimes than those that fell to Lord Cowper and Lord Spencer.  He\r\nresigned the office in 1889.  Eleven years later he sat in his first\r\nCabinet as Postmaster-General, and when Mr. Balfour succeeded his uncle\r\nin the premiership he appointed his colleague President of the Board of\r\nEducation--a nice, respectable post that nobody took seriously, and\r\nwondered why it was represented in the Cabinet at all.  The 'tariff'\r\nresignations in 1903 placed several important portfolios at Mr.\r\nBalfour's disposal, and he thereupon added to Lord Londonderry's\r\nofficial duties by making him Lord President of the Council.  And as\r\nPresident of the Board of Education and President of the Council the\r\nmarquis continued to attend the Cabinet until the ministry perished in\r\nthe {302} maelstrom that swallowed up the Tory party and astonished the\r\nworld within a few weeks of Mr. Balfour's resignation of the\r\npremiership.  The Tory ex-Prime Minister appeared to have left most of\r\nhis courage behind him in Ireland, where he went as 'Clara,' and stayed\r\nto earn the more flattering, if inelegant, sobriquet of 'Tiger Lily.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{303}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nFrom out of the solid phalanx of Tory peers eligible for the post Lord\r\nSalisbury chose the Earl of Zetland, and sent him to Dublin.  The\r\nviceroy was then in his forty-fifth year, was chiefly distinguished by\r\nhis fondness for horse-racing, while a painstaking press recorded the\r\nfact that his mother was an Irishwoman.  In 1871 he married Lady Lilian\r\nLumley, a daughter of the ninth Earl of Scarborough, and the following\r\nyear he was elected for the family borough of Richmond, Yorkshire.  The\r\ndeath of his uncle in 1873 terminated his career in the House of\r\nCommons, and until his appointment to Ireland in 1889 he led the life\r\nof a country gentleman and a sportsman.\r\n\r\nHis viceroyalty was somewhat similar to that of Lord Londonderry's,\r\nthough he soon lost the aid of Mr. Balfour, who was replaced by Mr. W.\r\nL. Jackson, raised to the peerage as Lord Allerton in King Edward's\r\nCoronation year.  He had not been long in office when the report of the\r\nParnell Commission became the sensation of the season; indeed, it was\r\nall Parnell and no Zetland from the beginning to the end of his term.\r\nThe Commission was followed by the divorce case that {304} extinguished\r\nthe Irish leader; then came the sharp and bitter party schisms, the\r\nintervention of the Roman Catholic hierarchy, and last of all the death\r\nof the central figure of the sordid and miserable tragedy.  It was\r\nquite impossible for either viceroy or Chief Secretary to do more than\r\nbe there if he was wanted, and, perhaps fortunately no great crisis\r\ncalled for their intervention.  A Tory Lord-Lieutenant can always have\r\na comfortable and easy life in Dublin provided he is not ambitious to\r\nbe up and doing.  Lord Zetland was disinclined to create precedents or\r\nseek to alter established things.  Every good cause received his\r\napproval and the benediction of Lady Zetland.  They were not more\r\npolitical than they had to be, while the viceroy's fondness for the\r\nTurf was not without its effect, although the Irish sportsman is quite\r\na different type to the Irish, and 'never the twain shall meet.'  The\r\nviceroyalty jogged on gently to its predestined end, and the General\r\nElection giving Mr. Gladstone a majority the six-year-old Salisbury\r\nAdministration came to an end.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mr. Gladstone in power]\r\n\r\nThe return of Mr. Gladstone to the premiership caused great\r\nperturbation in Unionist circles in Ireland.  At last the polls had\r\ngiven him a mandate for Home Rule, and there was no prospect of\r\nrebellious Liberals rising again to destroy their chief.  There\r\nremained the House of Lords, ever the bulwark of the liberties of the\r\npeople--whether the people appreciated it or not; but there was a doubt\r\nwhether the Upper Chamber would peril its existence by defying\r\nGladstone again.  Nevertheless, Unionist Ireland, with a {305}\r\nfanaticism and a determination not unworthy of the Irish Nationalist\r\nrepresentatives, determined to fight the odds against them inspired by\r\na 'No surrender' spirit.  They resolved not to touch Gladstone or his\r\nnoble representative with a forty-foot pole, and, numbering in their\r\nranks the majority of the gentry and nobility, their decision to\r\nboycott the incoming viceroy meant much more than it appeared on the\r\nsurface.  It is true that any Tory viceroy can create the sort of court\r\nhe pleases, and so can a Liberal in ordinary circumstances, but Lord\r\nHoughton was viceroy at a time when every snob, whether he took any\r\ninterest in politics or not, became a Unionist in order to be known as\r\na member of the gentlemanly party.  It was simply 'bad form' to favour\r\nHome Rule, and that was sufficient to unite Unionists as they have\r\nnever been united before or since.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone was in the position of having very few candidates for the\r\nviceroyalty.  Mr. John Morley was, of course, the Chief Secretary, and\r\nhe could be depended upon to do all the political work.  The premier\r\noffered the viceroyalty to the then Lord Houghton, and it was accepted\r\nin the hope that it would lead to better things.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Houghton]\r\n\r\nLord Houghton was born in 1858, on January 12, so that he was in his\r\nthirty-fifth year when he was sworn in as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.\r\nHis official training had been meagre, comprising the not fatiguing\r\npost of Assistant Private Secretary to Lord Granville during part of\r\nthat statesman's occupancy of the Foreign Office in Mr. Gladstone's\r\nsecond Administration, and a few months as Lord-in-Waiting {306} to\r\nQueen Victoria in 1886.  The son of Monckton Milnes was always an\r\nobject of interest to students of history, literary and political, and\r\nLord Houghton had shown that he was not inexpert by writing a number of\r\nstray verses that exhibited a talent for rhyming.  His ability for\r\nstatesmanship was, however, more doubtful, and, as events proved, he\r\nwas not the man to conciliate the important body of opinion adverse to\r\nthe Government he represented.  The position, certainly, was most\r\ndifficult, and abler men than Lord Houghton would have failed.  He\r\ncould not forget his own dignity, and therefore never attempted to\r\nconciliate the Opposition.  The distrust of the Nationalists must have\r\nstruck him as savouring of ingratitude, and as every Liberal viceroy\r\nhas found it, Lord Houghton was an object of suspicion and distrust to\r\nall Irishmen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Crewe]\r\n\r\nIrish society boycotted the Liberal viceroy.  He started badly by\r\ndeclining to receive a loyal address because it contained a reference\r\nto the Home Rule question.  Lord Houghton, being temperamentally\r\nincapable of inspiring affection in inferiors, adopted an attitude of\r\nextreme _hauteur_, offending every class in turn.  Mr. Gladstone was in\r\nthe midst of the battle of his life, ably seconded by Mr. John Morley;\r\nbut the Lord-Lieutenant of the Government sat in gloomy solitude in\r\nDublin, cognisant no doubt of the fact that for the first time since\r\n1172 Dublin Castle and Viceregal Lodge invitations were being declined\r\nor ignored by a society which in the ordinary course of events would\r\nsacrifice {307} anything rather than the _entree_ to the miniature\r\ncourt of the viceroy.  No help could come from Ireland, where the\r\nmasses watched the efforts to plant a Parliament in College Green with\r\na sullenness of demeanour that indicated their lack of enthusiasm.  The\r\neducated classes were almost to a man and a woman Unionists, and the\r\nmovement against the viceroy was inspired by party feelings, but Lord\r\nHoughton's personality did not tend towards the softening of the\r\nausterities.  The members of his _entourage_ suffered from the general\r\ndisfavour, and the aides-de-camp, who are usually almost danced to\r\ndeath every season, ended their labours as fresh as they began them.\r\nThe entertaining that had to be done was in the capable hands of the\r\nHon. Mrs. Arthur Henniker, Lord Houghton's sister, a lady of many\r\naccomplishments.  The viceroy was a widower then, and some years from a\r\nsecond wife, an earldom, an heir, and a marquisate.\r\n\r\nLord Houghton's position in Ireland was certainly unique.  In a country\r\noverwhelmingly Nationalist--using the word in its party sense--he was\r\nsupposed to belong to the popular side.  Hitherto, the Lord-Lieutenant\r\nhad been more or less a Tory, for the average Liberal was too superior\r\nto descend into the cockpit of Irish politics; but Lord Houghton was\r\nthe Heaven-sent embodiment of Ireland's hopes of legislative\r\nindependence.  He was a member of the Government that had for its first\r\nand only object the settlement of the Irish question, and yet the\r\nviceroy, with all these aids, might have been the most {308} bigoted\r\nTory of Tories, judging by the attitude of the Nationalists.  The\r\nnative politician well maintained his reputation for suspecting his\r\nbest friends.  The prophets of gloom foretold of the fatal intervention\r\nof the House of Lords, and were so certain of defeat as to contribute\r\ntowards it themselves.  Lord Houghton was regarded as a sham,\r\nGladstone's noble self-sacrifice as a mere trick; the whole body\r\npolitic seemed destitute of honour and honesty.  Wherever the viceroy\r\nwent he was received in silence; there were no popular demonstrations\r\nin town or country.  Ireland was in the position of the beggar who\r\nawaits charity with curses ready on her tongue in the case of refusal\r\nor dissatisfaction.  She could not--would not--believe and understand\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone was risking his own life, and that of his party, in\r\nhis endeavour to grant the Nationalist demands.  Eventually he wrecked\r\nLiberalism, but it has since recovered--Ireland has not.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords is the stock enemy of Liberalism, but the peers did\r\nLord Houghton a good turn when they rejected Mr. Gladstone's Home Rule\r\nBill and numbered the days of the ministry.  Heroically enough, the\r\nviceroy agreed to continue in office when Lord Rosebery was\r\nunexpectedly given the premiership; but all men knew that the\r\nGovernment was merely a makeshift, and that a General Election and a\r\nConservative-Unionist triumph was to be expected as a matter of course.\r\nIt came in 1895, and with it the end of Liberalism for ten years.  Lord\r\nHoughton resigned with the ministry, and left {309} Dublin as glad to\r\nbe out of the country as the country was as pleased to see the last of\r\nhim.  When the whirligig of time brought its revenges, and the Lord\r\nHoughton of the 1892-95 viceroyalty was an earl of ten years' standing,\r\nearls being remarkably scarce on the Liberal red benches, he was\r\nadmitted to the Cabinet in the respectable capacity of Lord President\r\nof the Council.  This post was vacated for a time when in Mr. Asquith's\r\nMinistry he was Lord Privy Seal and Secretary of State for the\r\nColonies.  In 1910 he became Secretary of State for India, exchanging\r\noffices with Viscount Morley.\r\n\r\nLord Crewe's marriage in 1898 to Lady Margaret Primrose, the youngest\r\ndaughter of the Earl of Rosebery, was a brilliant social function, and\r\nthe birth of a son and heir in 1911 was more welcome than the\r\nmarquisate which came to the Indian Secretary in the Coronation\r\nHonours' List.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tory ascendancy]\r\n\r\nThe triumph of the Conservative and Liberal-Unionist coalition cleared\r\nthe political atmosphere.  Once more the rival parties in Ireland were\r\non their old footing; the Castle and the Lodge would be exclusively\r\nUnionist, and the other side was saved the embarrassment of having a\r\nfriend in power.  Lord Salisbury, in looking round for a suitable\r\nviceroy, found in his intimate friend and colleague, Lord Cadogan, the\r\nideal viceroy.  Twenty years previously they had been members of the\r\nsame Government--Lord Salisbury in the Cabinet, and Lord Cadogan\r\nUnder-Secretary at the War Office and the Colonial Office in turn.\r\n{310} In Lord Salisbury's Government of 1886-92 he was Lord Privy Seal.\r\nTheir political friendship served to cement a private friendship that\r\nlasted until Lord Salisbury's death, and it was the premier's\r\nresignation in 1902 that caused the then viceroy to retire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Earl Cadogan, K.G.]\r\n\r\nLord Cadogan was born in 1840, and in 1865 he married Lady Beatrix\r\nCraven, who died in 1907.  Succeeding to the earldom in 1873, he was\r\nobliged to leave the House of Commons, to which he had been elected by\r\nthe citizens of Bath the same year.  From the day of his elevation to\r\none of the wealthiest places in the peerage Lord Cadogan became a\r\nvalued asset of the Conservative party.  An intimate friend of the then\r\nPrince and Princess of Wales, given to hospitality, married to a lady\r\nwith more than the usual gift for entertaining, the owner of Chelsea\r\nHouse and his wife became social leaders of the party.  Lord Salisbury\r\nwas fortunate in securing Lord Cadogan for the viceroyalty, and a seat\r\nin the Cabinet was only right and proper for one whose influence and\r\nsupport were of paramount importance.  As Chief Secretary, Mr. Gerald\r\nBalfour accompanied Lord Cadogan, and after an imposing state entry on\r\nAugust 12, 1895, they settled down to work.\r\n\r\nIn Dublin Castle there is an object-lesson of the relative political\r\nimportance of the two chief executive officers of the Government in\r\nIreland.  The Lord-Lieutenant's room is small and unpretentious, that\r\nof the Chief Secretary roomy, well furnished, and comfortable; but\r\nduring Lord Cadogan's term he overshadowed his first Chief {311}\r\nSecretary, although the latter was a brother of the leader of the House\r\nof Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord and Lady Cadogan]\r\n\r\nLord and Lady Cadogan quickly earned that popularity which never left\r\nthem.  Charming to everybody, the soul of courtesy to all ranks and\r\nclasses, ideal host and hostess, and spending their great wealth\r\nfreely, it would have been surprising, indeed, if the viceroy and his\r\nwife had not achieved success.  Nationalists, professional and amateur,\r\nlearnt the advantage of having a wealthy Lord-Lieutenant, even if he\r\nhad been nominated by the hated and detested Tories, and the\r\nunostentatious munificence of the viceregal pair was not the least\r\nfactor that contributed towards their success.  As a member of the\r\nCabinet, Lord Cadogan's political sympathies were obvious, yet in an\r\nextraordinary way he managed to conceal the politician in the\r\nadministrator.  He was even accused of favouring the Nationalists and\r\nRoman Catholics, and aggrieved place-hunters ruefully declared that the\r\nonly qualification for office and promotion was Nationalist leanings or\r\nadherence to the Church of Rome.  Nevertheless, Lord and Lady Cadogan\r\nlost nothing of their influence over all classes.  Every Dublin season\r\nwas brilliant and successful, simply because Lord and Lady Cadogan had\r\nthe power to do things, and knew how to do them.  The visit of the then\r\nDuke and Duchess of York in 1897--a brilliant success--was a triumph\r\nfor Lord Cadogan's political perspicacity.  The Local Government Bill\r\nof 1898--a measure frankly Liberal in tone--would have wrecked any\r\nother Lord-Lieutenant; it left Lord Cadogan as strong {312} as ever.\r\nIt is the irony of fate that the Conservative-Unionist party should\r\nhave done, and still be doing, more for Ireland than Gladstone or his\r\ncolleagues ever did.  The Local Government Bill meant that the control\r\nof local affairs should pass from the hands of the minority to the\r\nmajority.  Protestant and Unionist councillors, Chairmen of County\r\nCouncils, aldermen, magistrates, and other minor dignitaries were swept\r\nout of existence, and that nebulous host, the people, reigned in their\r\nstead.  Had Gladstone proposed such a measure, and carried it, there\r\nwould have been a revolt of the Unionists in Ireland, but as a\r\nSalisbury Government fathered the Act it was accepted without demur,\r\nand the revolution on the Nationalist side was a peaceful one.  In a\r\nsingle phrase, the Act meant that in future the Catholic majority\r\nshould be the masters of the Protestant minority.  There is no quarter\r\ngiven or asked in Irish politics, and from that day to this the\r\nProtestants have had no share in the administration of local government\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{313}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the South African War initiated a display of disloyalty\r\nin Ireland which might have embarrassed a less adroit Administration.\r\nThe policy of killing Home Rule by kindness had not succeeded, and it\r\nwas very evident that the throwing open of practically every office to\r\nthe people had not satisfied them.  Every Boer victory was received\r\nwith jubilation, but it was mostly superficial.  An English tourist,\r\ntactfully extracting the opinions of a cabdriver, was informed that the\r\nEnglish deserved to be beaten, as he hoped they would, adding with a\r\ngrin of delight, 'But we did make them run, sor, didn't we?' referring\r\nto the account of an English victory over the enemy the day before in\r\nwhich an Irish regiment had gained fresh laurels.  Nothing is more\r\nludicrous than the fervent politician who attempts unearthly\r\nconsistency in thought, word, and deed.  Few persons take seriously the\r\nover-serious politician.\r\n\r\nThe General Election of 1900 was preceded by a visit from Queen\r\nVictoria--the last of a successful series.  It was a tribute to the\r\ngood sense of the Irish and their innate loyalty, and Lord Cadogan did\r\nmuch to bring the queen to Ireland by {314} assuring the Cabinet that\r\nthere was not the slightest danger.  Four and a half years' residence\r\nin the country had taught the viceroy a great deal about the Irish\r\npeople, and his trust and confidence in them were confirmed when, on\r\nApril 3, 1900, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, Sir Thomas D. Pile, Bart.,\r\npresented Her Majesty with the keys of the city and the civic sword.\r\nShe entered Dublin in triumph, and was received by Lord and Lady\r\nCadogan at the Viceregal Lodge amid great rejoicing and splendour.  The\r\nfollowing day more than 50,000 children were reviewed in the Phoenix\r\nPark by the queen--a happy inspiration on the part of her advisers.\r\nThere was, of course, a review of the troops, the queen's youngest son,\r\nthe Duke of Connaught, in command, and several other incidents of an\r\nhistoric occasion passed off with as much success as though there was\r\n'no such a thing' as Irish disloyalty.  Thousands of persons who had\r\ncheered Boer victories without quite knowing why they did it cheered\r\nthe queen until they were hoarse, because heart and head combined to\r\nwelcome their illustrious visitor.  Well might the aged monarch write a\r\nletter reflecting the emotion of a grateful and proud queen.  No other\r\nmonarch had the happy inspirations Queen Victoria constantly displayed\r\nin her messages to her people, and the secret of it all was that she\r\nwrote them as a woman, though compelled to publish them as a queen.\r\n\r\nShortly after the conclusion of her visit she wrote to Lord Cadogan:\r\n'How very much gratified and how deeply touched she had been by her\r\n{315} reception.  After the lapse of thirty-nine years her reception\r\nhad equalled that of previous visits, and she carried away with her a\r\nmost pleasant and affectionate memory of the time she had spent in\r\nIreland, having been received by all ranks and creeds with an\r\nenthusiasm and affection which cannot be surpassed.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of Queen Victoria]\r\n\r\nThe next important event was the reconstruction of the Salisbury\r\nMinistry following the Election of 1900.  Mr. Gerald Balfour, not too\r\nsuccessful at the Irish Office, was transferred to the Board of Trade,\r\nand Mr. George Wyndham took his place in Ireland.  The new Chief\r\nSecretary was eager to effect reforms, but the influence of the\r\nLord-Lieutenant and the Prime Minister compelled him to pursue the\r\nconventional course of Chief Secretaries who are neither poets nor\r\ndandies.  The death of Queen Victoria in January placed the court in\r\nmourning for a year, and when that was over the resignation of Lord\r\nSalisbury became an imminent event.  To Lord Cadogan it meant something\r\nmore than the severance of old ties.  Lord Salisbury and he were bound\r\ntogether by numerous social and political ties, and when the great\r\nstatesman resigned in the summer of 1902 Lord Cadogan immediately\r\ntendered his resignation to the king of the high office of\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland.  Speaking to his tenantry on the subject,\r\nthe viceroy declared that all his political life had been bound up with\r\nLord Salisbury's, and he had no desire to continue in it now that his\r\nold chief was retiring.  He had spent seven years in Ireland--seven\r\nyears of peace--and {316} his success was notable and inspiring.  Mere\r\nwealth could not have achieved it unaided; it was personality and the\r\ndesire to be as non-political as one in his position could be.  It is\r\nno exaggeration to say that his departure was universally regretted.\r\nFor the time the acerbities of political life were forgotten, and\r\nIreland turned out to say good-bye to a good friend and his charming\r\ncomrade, Lady Cadogan.  On all sides people expressed the opinion that\r\nMr. Balfour would find it impossible to nominate a suitable successor,\r\nand bad times were predicted for the man brave enough to attempt to\r\nfollow Lord Cadogan in the viceroyalty.\r\n\r\nHad he chosen to do so, the retiring viceroy might have taken a high\r\npost in Mr. Balfour's ministry, but he stood aside to accompany Lord\r\nSalisbury into private life--that is, as private as the husband of a\r\npolitical hostess can be.  His social services were still at the\r\ndisposal of the party to which he belonged, and they were strong\r\nsupporters of the Balfour regime.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 Lady Cadogan died, and this tragedy was succeeded by the death\r\nof his eldest son, Viscount Chelsea, in 1908.  Two years later his\r\ngrandson and heir passed away.  These events isolated Lord Cadogan, and\r\nhe led a somewhat lonely life until he married for a second time.  The\r\nmarriage took place on January 12, 1911, the bride being the Countess\r\nAdele Palagi, a cousin of the bridegroom.\r\n\r\nAbout two years after Lord Cadogan's retirement from the viceroyalty a\r\ndeputation of leading {317} Irishmen called at his London residence to\r\npresent him with a token of the esteem in which he was held by all\r\nthose who had come in contact with him during his viceroyalty.  The\r\ndeputation was headed by Lord Iveagh, and included Sir David Harrel,\r\nSir James Blyth, Sir Thomas Pile, Sir Lambert Ormsby, and Sir James\r\nHenderson.  They represented all Ireland, and on their behalf the\r\nchairman presented the earl with an address, a silver bowl, and his\r\nportrait painted by Mr. Solomon J. Solomon, R.A.  It was a unique\r\nceremony, this tribute to one of the most successful viceroys Ireland\r\nhad ever known.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord and Lady Dudley]\r\n\r\nLord Dudley succeeded to the viceroyalty at the youthful age of\r\nthirty-five.  For seven years he had been Parliamentary Secretary to\r\nthe Board of Trade, and had proved himself to be a hard-working,\r\nambitious peer.  Immensely wealthy and generous, he was the most\r\nsuitable man to follow Lord Cadogan, especially as Lady Dudley was a\r\nhostess of renown--one of the most popular of the younger\r\nhostesses--and a general favourite with royalty.\r\n\r\nThe Dudley reign in Ireland was full of incident, social and political.\r\nIt opened unluckily enough, for in the early days of December, 1902,\r\nLady Dudley was seized with a serious illness at the Viceregal Lodge,\r\nand at one time the gravest fears were entertained.  The operation for\r\nappendicitis, however, was successful, and the countess recovered to\r\nadorn the office she shared with her husband.  The mother of a young\r\nfamily, she won the hearts of all Ireland by sending one of {318} her\r\ndaughters to the Alexandra High School--an institution deservedly\r\nfamous for its successful training and teaching of girls.  This was one\r\nof many triumphs achieved by tact and good nature, and within a few\r\nmonths of her arrival in Ireland there was no more popular person in\r\nthe country.  Mr. Balfour had been fortunate, indeed, in finding a Lady\r\nDudley to follow a Lady Cadogan, while the Lord-Lieutenant at once\r\nproved himself to be strong, fearless, open-minded, and just.  It was\r\nsaid of a Chief Secretary--Sir Robert Peel--that his one-sided opinions\r\nof Irish affairs were due to the fact that he had driven through the\r\ncountry on an outside car.  Lord Dudley went all over Ireland in a\r\nmotor-car, and therefore could not help but see both sides.  Ever an\r\nenthusiastic motorist, His Excellency pursued his hobby all the time he\r\nwas in Ireland, and unexpected visits to remote hamlets were numerous.\r\nThis passion for motoring had a practical result--it enabled the\r\nviceroy to gather a great deal of first-hand information about the\r\ncountry and the people; and when he consented to become chairman of the\r\nRoyal Commission on Congestion in Ireland, the year he retired from the\r\nviceroyalty, he brought to bear upon the subject and the problem a\r\nknowledge unequalled by any other non-Irish member of the Board.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lord Dudley]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Wyndham Land Act]\r\n\r\nThe supreme political event of Lord Dudley's term was undoubtedly Mr.\r\nGeorge Wyndham's Land Act of 1903.  Had Gladstone lived to witness a\r\nTory Chief Secretary piloting such a measure through Parliament he must\r\nassuredly have gasped.  {319} It caused great searchings of heart\r\namongst the colleagues of Mr. Wyndham, but it came into the\r\nstatute-book--another proof of the political axiom that the Tory party\r\nhave done more for Ireland than the Liberal, that Tory Cabinets have\r\nworked more for Home Rule than their political rivals.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary Tory Chief Secretary aroused the suspicions of his\r\nfriends.  Loud-voiced Unionists in Ireland declared that he was at\r\nheart a Home Ruler, and when the Lord-Lieutenant declined to take this\r\naccusation seriously he was in his turn labelled Home Ruler, too.\r\nReports were sent to London of the dreadful backsliding of Lord Dudley.\r\nAs time crawled by he was described as an out-and-out Nationalist, a\r\ntraitor to the party he was sent to represent in Ireland.  The\r\ndevolution scheme ascribed to Lord Dunraven, the late Captain Shaw, and\r\nothers, was said to have received the viceroy's benediction.\r\nSuperficially, that plan seemed the easiest method by which the eternal\r\nIrish question could be settled; it appeared so nice and equitable.\r\nBut there was the dangerous rock of finance, on which all devolution\r\nschemes must be wrecked.  During the uproar the Lord-Lieutenant was\r\ncompelled to adopt measures of precaution.  The party leaders in\r\nEngland demanded a sign from him, for it would not do to permit Liberal\r\nand Nationalist orators to assure receptive and eager audiences night\r\nafter night that the Tory Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland had learned by\r\nexperience in Ireland that the only cure for the evils of the country\r\nwas Home Rule.  The Wyndham Land Act was merely a palliative, {320}\r\nthey added.  It was deemed necessary that Lord Dudley should write an\r\nelaborate explanation of his views on Ireland, and entrust the document\r\nto Lord Lansdowne, the leader of the Government in the House of Lords.\r\nThis precious epistle was to recline in the noble marquis's pocket\r\nuntil, goaded by the taunts of the Opposition, he should be able to\r\nproduce it dramatically and confound the scoffers and unbelievers.  The\r\nletter was written, but never read in the Lords, the minds of men\r\nturning to other matters when Mr. Wyndham was recalled from Ireland and\r\nMr. Walter Long appointed Chief Secretary.  It was Mr. Balfour's way of\r\nannouncing his dislike of the already dead and buried devolution plan.\r\n\r\nThe period of doubt left the viceroy unshorn of his friends.  Those who\r\nknew him personally were well aware that he was a genuine friend of\r\nIreland, and the whole country knew that this English nobleman stood\r\nrather to lose than gain by any active display of good-will towards the\r\npeople he ruled in the name of the king.  The personal popularity of\r\nLord and Lady Dudley was such that no political crisis could affect\r\nmaterially.  Lady Dudley, a clever woman of rare charm, an artist and a\r\nlinguist, was not without experience of the vicissitudes of life, and\r\nher knowledge of things human had been increased thereby.  The daughter\r\nof a once wealthy banker, she knew what poverty was, and at one time\r\nshe was associated along with her sister in the millinery shop their\r\nmother started in London soon after the Gurney bank failure.  The shop\r\nwas not a {321} success, and had to be abandoned.  The girls were\r\nadopted by friends of the family, the Duke and Duchess of Bedford\r\ntaking charge of Miss Rachel Gurney.  Under their wing she made the\r\nacquaintance of the young Earl of Dudley, and they were married in\r\n1891, society, headed by the Prince of Wales, attending the function.\r\nNever very strong, and often suffering great pain, Lady Dudley,\r\nnevertheless, preserved a sweetness of temper and a kindliness to all\r\nand sundry that both in Ireland and Australia helped immensely in\r\nestablishing the influence of her husband.  In Ireland, especially, a\r\nviceroy's wife has many opportunities, and they are not always easy to\r\ngrasp.  Lady Dudley succeeded every time, and it is not to be wondered\r\nat that by thousands of those whose experience entitle them to be\r\nconsidered experts on the subject she is named as the most successful\r\nand popular 'vicereine' the country has known for over a hundred years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Royal visitors]\r\n\r\nThe busiest social year of the Dudley regime was that of 1903, when\r\nKing Edward and Queen Alexandra visited Ireland.  It was the first\r\noccasion a King of England was seen in Ireland for eighty-two years,\r\nand the people marked the honour by a display of enthusiasm unequalled\r\nin the history of the country.  The king and queen were greatly touched\r\nby the loyalty of the Irish, and under the capable direction of Lord\r\nand Lady Dudley the series of festivities went with a vim that\r\ngratified the distinguished visitors and added fresh laurels to those\r\nalready earned by the _chatelaine_ of the Viceregal Lodge and Dublin\r\nCastle.  {322} A royal visit produces more anxiety than pleasure, as a\r\nrule, for those whose duty it is to see that the arrangements for\r\nentertaining the guests are perfect and carried out to the letter; but\r\na genius for organization displayed itself in the arrangements devised\r\nfor the filling up of their Majesties' programme, and that was the\r\ngenius of the Lord-Lieutenant and his wife.  The most significant event\r\nof the visit was the Levee held at Dublin Castle by the king.  All the\r\nleading men of Ireland were invited, irrespective of politics and\r\nreligion.  It was a daring thing to do, but Lord Dudley could count\r\nupon his own popularity, and he confidently invited Roman Catholic\r\nArchbishops, Catholic gentlemen, Nationalists, and many others whose\r\npolitical opinions were against the Government.  The occasion was\r\nhistoric--a King of England holding a Levee in 'the worst castle in the\r\nworst situation in Christendom,' as a former viceroy described it--and\r\nit was almost unprecedented.  With characteristic good feeling and\r\nunderstanding all classes and creeds attended to do homage to His\r\nMajesty, who had the gratification of receiving many notable Irishmen\r\nand seeing them mingling together, their differences forgotten in the\r\npresence of their Sovereign.  The success of that Levee was a splendid\r\ntribute to Lord Dudley's tenure of the post of Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nIreland.  Another visit by King Edward and Queen Alexandra the\r\nfollowing April was equally successful.\r\n\r\nThe dying days of the Balfour ministry found Irish affairs inert.  The\r\nrespectable Mr. Long was {323} ready to do anything to prove his stanch\r\nUnionist principles, but both countries and parties were in that frame\r\nof mind produced by a sense of impending death.  There had been ten\r\nunbroken years of Unionist sway in Ireland; two viceroys of great\r\nwealth and popularity had carried on the Government, assisted by Chief\r\nSecretaries of varying qualities of statesmanship; the country had\r\ngrown accustomed to Tory control, and rather liked it, judging by the\r\nexperience of Liberal predecessors.  Every charitable cause had met\r\nwith a ready response from the Lord-Lieutenant and his wife, and for\r\nten years the viceroy had appeared almost non-political.  The\r\nnumberless acts of kindness placed to the credit of Lady Cadogan and\r\nLady Dudley created for them a genuine feeling of admiration and\r\naffection.  The heads of the Government in Ireland were no longer mere\r\nparty 'jobbers.'  The anxiety to be impartial was at times almost\r\npainful, but it was not without effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social splendour]\r\n\r\nSocially, the two viceroyalties had been brilliant successes.  The Tory\r\nGovernment had everything in its favour.  Two such hostesses as the\r\nwives of Lords Cadogan and Dudley are rarely met with, and for ten\r\nyears in succession the Dublin season was ever one of splendour.  There\r\nhad been periods of mourning, but, apart from these, the years were\r\nnotable.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the cry for Home Rule was not less shrill nor less determined.\r\nNationalists could say with some reason that all that Lord Cadogan and\r\nLord Dudley had done could be done again with {324} a Parliament in\r\nCollege Green.  The growing feeling in English constituencies against\r\nthe Conservative Government was hailed with delight by the Irish party.\r\nThey saw Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, an avowed Home Ruler, gladly and\r\neagerly putting their demand for Home Rule in the forefront of the\r\ngreat fight, and when the polls had placed him in power making Home\r\nRule the first plank in the programme of the resuscitated Liberal party.\r\n\r\nEngland could not be expected to be impressed by the successes of the\r\nTory Government in Dublin.  As a matter of fact, English electors were\r\nfeeling rather bored with Irish affairs, and at the polls they scarcely\r\nstopped to think about Home Rule, but voted for the Liberal candidate\r\nfor the negative reason that they did not like his opponent.  The\r\nGeneral Election was a triumph for the pure, undiluted political faith\r\nof Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and, besides smashing all hopes that\r\nthe Irish party would be the masters of the situation, compelled those\r\nminute particles of Liberalism labelled Imperialists, Radicals, and so\r\non, to unite under the lead of the new Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The spirit of conciliation]\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary course of events Lord Dudley resigned with the\r\nConservative Ministry, and on the appointment of a successor departed\r\nfrom Ireland.  A few months' previously--September 21, 1905, to be\r\nexact--he had escaped death in the waters of Lough Erne, where, with a\r\nsmall party, he was unlucky enough to see his yacht capsize during a\r\nrace.  It was one adventure of many he {325} has experienced in his\r\ncomparatively brief life.  Following his resignation, he still evinced\r\na keen interest in Ireland, and when the Liberal premier asked him to\r\npreside over the deliberations of a Royal Commission on Congestion, he\r\naccepted it as one who has never allowed his actions to be guided and\r\ncontrolled solely by party motives.  The work of the Commission\r\nfinishing, he went to the other end of the world as Governor-General of\r\nAustralia, holding the post for three years, when Lady Dudley's\r\nill-health compelled him to return home in 1911.  This willingness to\r\nserve the Liberal party has been taken by some as additional evidence\r\nof his lukewarm Unionism, but Lord Dudley remains a member of the party\r\nthat made him Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and he is a Unionist at\r\nheart, though he permits himself the luxury of thinking on the subject.\r\nIt is certain that while in Ireland he examined the claims and\r\npretensions of the Home Rule party, and endeavoured to arrive at an\r\nunderstanding.  The fact that he was not hounded out of the country by\r\nhis fellow-Unionists is proof positive of the fact that a new spirit of\r\nconciliation has arisen, and that Irish political controversialists are\r\naware that there can be two sides to every question, even an Irish one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{326}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Aberdeen's return]\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen's return to Ireland, twenty years after his first entry\r\ninto Dublin as Lord-Lieutenant, was announced immediately after the\r\nresignation of Mr. Balfour's ministry.  It was to a new Ireland that\r\nthe viceroy came.  Much history had been made since the days when the\r\n'Union of Hearts' presaged a smooth passage to popularity for the Earl\r\nof Aberdeen.  Successive Tory Governments had laboured upon Irish\r\naffairs, and if they had stopped short at Home Rule they had come very\r\nnear it.  The Nationalist party was inclined to be sullen, realizing\r\ntheir futility, and compelled to wait humbly upon Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman's pleasure.  He was independent of them.  They were\r\nfree to join the Opposition if they chose to do so, although the Prime\r\nMinister, always consistent, hinted that a Home Rule Bill was about to\r\nappear on the Parliamentary horizon.  There was the South African\r\nbusiness to be got through first; then the fiscal question seemed\r\ncapable of wasting more public time, and questions of Empire and home\r\nfinance all blocked the way to the ambitions of the group led by Mr.\r\nJohn Redmond.  Astute Nationalists quickly understood that they must\r\nwait for another General Election, perhaps two, before {327} their\r\nhopes could be realized, and therefore they stood aside while the\r\ncountry blinked its eyes at the unusual sight of Liberals sitting in\r\nthe seats of the mighty, and new men with even newer names flocking to\r\nthe Cabinet room in Downing Street.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Viceroy of Ireland took possession of his high office.\r\nFor nearly eight years he had lived in retirement, his\r\nGovernor-Generalship of Canada beginning in 1893 and ending in 1898.\r\nThe Canadian period was another record of success for the viceregal\r\npair, who were undoubtedly the most valuable at the disposal of the\r\nGovernment for viceregal positions requiring a long pedigree, a long\r\npurse, and the royal attribute of being all things to all men.\r\n\r\nThe position of a Lord-Lieutenant nominated by a Liberal Prime Minister\r\nis the most anomalous and difficult in the Government.  He is selected\r\nbecause he is a member of the party in power, and asked to fill a post\r\nin which, as the representative of the king, he must not display any\r\npolitical leanings.  His Majesty is above politics, and the man who is\r\naccorded royal honours in Ireland must represent the king\r\nnon-politically.  Even in this attempt he must needs lay himself open\r\nto the charges--eagerly laid against him--of showing favour to either\r\npolitical party, for even a Viceroy of Ireland cannot help being aware\r\nof the politics and religion of some of those upon whom he bestows\r\noffice.  In the case of a Liberal Lord-Lieutenant he dwells in a\r\ncountry where Liberalism has been buried for more than a generation,\r\nwhere {328} a religious motive colours every political action, and\r\nwhere bones of contention provide the only food for the hungry\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nBut the severest handicap to which a Liberal Lord-Lieutenant is\r\nsubjected arises out of the prevalent notion that Nationalism and\r\ndisloyalty are almost interchangeable terms.  This enables every\r\nUnionist to charge the viceroy with pandering to the prejudices of the\r\ndisloyal majority, and thereby degrading the dignity of his office by\r\ncondoning insults to the king whom he represents.  From time to time\r\nNationalist politicians have declined to drink the king's health, or\r\nhave marched out of a hall or room at the sound of the first bars of\r\n'God save the King.'  Instances readily occur to all acquainted with\r\nIreland.  Unionists naturally make the most of this, and the\r\nLord-Lieutenant finds himself criticized by all, the fiercest being\r\nthose who ought to support him.  Had Daniel O'Connell and his fiery\r\nsuccessors bred a spirit of personal devotion to the throne of England,\r\nHome Rule might have been an accomplished fact thirty years ago, but\r\nthe attitude adopted by Home Rule's leading propagandists has alienated\r\nthe sympathies of the voters of Great Britain.  Comfortable politicians\r\nin Westminster can legislate and talk of Ireland far from the centre of\r\nthe problem, and unhampered by the local difficulties that are to be\r\nmet with in Ireland.  They know nothing, or else conveniently forget\r\nthat, while Liberalism in England can, and does, hold Home Rule\r\ncompatible with loyalty to the king, such an amalgamation of ideas has\r\nnot been {329} recognized hitherto in Ireland.  The viceroy, however,\r\nhas to face the music, and as the embodiment of kingly rule in Ireland\r\nhe has to remain a Liberal and a Home Ruler despite the knowledge that\r\nNationalists feel bound to hold aloof from the king's representative\r\nuntil self-government is granted.\r\n\r\nVery few Viceroys of Ireland have been Cabinet ministers, and it is,\r\nindeed, surprising how any statesman can be expected to act as king in\r\nIreland and as an exponent of his party's policy in Downing Street; but\r\nthe fact that viceroys do not often sit in the Cabinet does not remove\r\nthe political aspect of the post.  The unwritten law seems to be that\r\nwhile a Tory occupant of the Viceregal Lodge may be as partisan as he\r\nwishes, no Lord-Lieutenant chosen by a Liberal premier must open his\r\nmouth on the political questions of the day.  It is easy to account for\r\nthis.  Unionism superficially means this, at any rate--that the party\r\nbelieves in loyalty to the Crown and the Constitution, while the other\r\nside can only retort by declaring that a readjustment of the\r\nConstitution would not affect the indissolubility of the Crown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nationalists and the Castle]\r\n\r\nThen, Nationalists are by training and instinct suspicious of the\r\nCastle.  Irishmen are seldom cowards, but it is only necessary to bring\r\na charge of sycophancy against an Irishman to make him forswear the\r\nCastle and all its works.  It is, in his opinion, the greatest insult\r\nyou can offer him.  You may question the honour of his ancestors, doubt\r\nhis honour, or even deride his alleged sense {330} of humour--all these\r\nthings will leave him cold; but hint that he wants a job, sneer at him\r\nbecause you imagine he is hankering after the fleshpots of Castle Yard\r\nor the messes of the Viceregal Lodge, and then take steps to insure\r\nyour safety.  This weapon has proved most effective in the hands of\r\nNationalist writers and journalists, though it has not always succeeded\r\nin preventing men holding Nationalist opinions from serving their\r\ncountry on the bench or in the administration of the Government of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nEnglish ministers possess more patronage than the Lord-Lieutenant of\r\nIreland, and jobbery is ever rampant in London; but the business of the\r\nmetropolis is not stopped in order that the multitude may hold up their\r\nhands in horror at the action of the jobbers.  Happily, England's\r\nstrength is not in its Civil Service.  In Ireland it is different, and\r\nwhereas the ambition of every family was to have a priest amongst its\r\nsons, now a Civil Servant within its ranks is considered more\r\ndesirable.  And the Lord-Lieutenant, as Chief Patron, is the natural\r\nprey of the eager, and hopeful, and the disappointed.\r\n\r\nNot since the mayoralty of T. D. Sullivan in 1886--during Lord\r\nAberdeen's previous term of office--has the Mansion House in Dawson\r\nStreet known the presence of a viceroy.  Successive Lord Mayors of\r\nDublin have held aloof from the Government--some from conviction, the\r\nmajority frightened by the bogie of sycophancy.  Amateur politicians\r\ncontinue to practise the art of debate on the floors and in the\r\ngalleries of the City Hall, and their brethren in a more sophisticated\r\nmanner {331} demonstrated their statesmanlike qualities in Westminster;\r\nwhile the Lord-Lieutenant, the symbol of England's despotic rule,\r\nmingles with the aristocratic and official sets, which are mainly Tory.\r\nIn fact, the Nationalists are afraid to indicate loyalty by accepting\r\nthe hospitality of the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland, and, curiously\r\nenough, the extreme Unionists adopt precisely the same course when a\r\nLiberal Government is in power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Welcoming the Lord-Lieutenant]\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen made his state entry on February 3, 1906.  Only veterans\r\ncould recall the doings of the Lord-Lieutenant of 1886, but Lord and\r\nLady Aberdeen's names were household words, as they had been no\r\nstrangers to Ireland during these twenty years, but had identified\r\nthemselves with much work for the benefit of her industries and\r\nwelfare, and in many ways the new viceroy and his wife received a\r\nsympathetic welcome.  They were anxious to mark their term of office by\r\nsocial reform, and to keep the office as far removed from party\r\npolitics as possible.\r\n\r\nTwo notable deputations waited on the viceroy at Dublin Castle within a\r\nfortnight of his arrival.  One consisted of the survivors of the\r\nextraordinary popular demonstration that had escorted Lord and Lady\r\nAberdeen out of Dublin in 1886.  On that occasion the Lord Mayor of\r\nDublin and members of the Corporation had headed the procession, which\r\nwas intended to show the affection of the Home Rule party for the Home\r\nRule viceroy.  The survivors now read an address of welcome to the\r\nLord-Lieutenant, and as all addresses to the viceroy are carefully\r\nsubedited, Lord Aberdeen {332} was able to listen to the compliments\r\nthis particular one contained, and reply in set terms indicating his\r\ndesire to work in sympathy with all parties in Ireland.  Twenty years\r\nearlier a different reply might have been possible, but during the\r\ninterval between the first and second Aberdeen reigns the Tory party\r\nhad stolen much of the Liberal thunder, and the deputation represented\r\nsomething as Victorian as an antimacassar.\r\n\r\nThe second deputation was from the City of Belfast, and expressed\r\ndevotion and loyalty to the throne and to the king's representative.\r\nIn other words, it was a grim reminder to Lord Aberdeen that the\r\nUnionists had their eye on him, and that it behoved him not to air his\r\nHome Rule opinions during his viceroyalty.  There is an unwritten law\r\nthat all Lord-Lieutenants of Ireland must be non-political in thought\r\nand word, if not in deed, and the rule is always applied with rigour in\r\nthe case of a Liberal viceroy.  To this and all other addresses of\r\nwelcome it was easy to return a speech of thanks, and Lord Aberdeen\r\npromised to visit Belfast at the first available opportunity--a promise\r\nwhich was soon fulfilled, and resulted in many subsequent visits to the\r\nnorthern capital, where Lord and Lady Aberdeen have always been\r\naccorded a hearty welcome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lord Aberdeen in Rome]\r\n\r\nIt was not very long before the viceroy provided his watchful opponents\r\nwith food for criticism.  In January, 1907, he actually visited Rome\r\nwithout taking the trouble to obtain the consent of the Orangemen, who\r\nwere horrified to hear that the Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland had been\r\nreceived {333} in audience by the Pope.  In this atrocious act they\r\ndiscovered all the evidence of the intention of the Government to\r\nconsign the lives and property of Protestants to the inquisitorial\r\nmercies of the Catholics.  The ministry was going to pass Home Rule at\r\nonce, and in order to make it complete sent the Viceroy of Ireland to\r\ninterview the Pope, and obtain his views on the matter.  This was the\r\nopinion of the easily terrified Opposition.  These excitable\r\nreligionists were well aware of the fact that Lord Aberdeen is a\r\nPresbyterian, and an office-bearer in that Church.  Ready themselves to\r\nsacrifice every shred of religion in the cause of politics, they\r\ndoubted the sincerity of others, and the Lord-Lieutenant was accused of\r\nselling his soul to Rome to further the ends of the Government he\r\nrepresented.  Religious extremists, whether they be Protestants or\r\nCatholics, always present an unedifying caricature of human nature and\r\nhuman sense.  English Protestants made themselves just as ridiculous\r\nover the visit of the late King Edward paid to the Pope a few years\r\nago.  We know that, in the phrase of a great Irishman, the Catholics in\r\nEngland are a sect, while in Ireland they are a nation; but the\r\nbrass-tongued minority in Ireland seem to dominate the country when\r\nthey have any opportunity to bring charges against their Catholic\r\nfellow-countrymen.  Lord Aberdeen passed from the Vatican to the\r\npresence of the king of Rome, but this act did not serve to mitigate\r\nthe heinousness of his first offence.\r\n\r\nThe year of 1907 was a full and exciting one for all concerned in the\r\nviceregal administration of {334} Ireland.  On January 24 Mr. Augustine\r\nBirrell became Chief Secretary, as Mr. James Bryce was appointed to the\r\nembassy at Washington--or, at any rate, was induced to think so--and\r\nthe new broom came with the intention of sweeping out many abuses.\r\nThere was to be a superb Irish University; there were whispers of a new\r\nLand Act that would bring peace to all concerned; the reform of Trinity\r\nCollege would be accomplished on the advice of the Royal Commission\r\nappointed the previous June; and, finally, there was a promise of Home\r\nRule.  Apart from these more or less political topics, quieter folk\r\ndiscussed the forthcoming visit of the king and queen, who were\r\nvenerated by their Irish subjects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: King Edward conversing with Lord Aberdeen at the Irish\r\nInternational Exhibition, 1907]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Dublin Castle jewels]\r\n\r\nThe royal visitors were expected to arrive during the second week of\r\nJuly, and a few days before--on the 6th--it was announced that the\r\nfamous collection of jewellery, known as the Dublin Castle jewels, had\r\ndisappeared.  The pecuniary value of the jewels was about L40,000, but\r\ntheir intrinsic worth was considerably more than this.  The public\r\namazement was nothing compared with the official consternation.  These\r\njewels were to have been used during the installation of Lord Pirrie as\r\na Knight of St. Patrick, and King Edward was to have presided at the\r\nceremony.  Strange rumours flooded Dublin and travelled on to London.\r\nNo name was too high or too sacred to be associated with the theft, and\r\nevery bar-loafer could pose as a _persona grata_ in Court circles by\r\nslyly mentioning the mystery and declaring that 'everybody' knew\r\nSo-and-so was the thief, and that his family {335} were paying ransom\r\nfor him.  It seemed as though the police confined their investigations\r\nto Debrett, ignoring those whose lack of rank and title disqualified\r\nthem for suspicion.  The circumstances of this official tragedy were\r\nwell in keeping with the romantic result.  Dublin Castle is the\r\nheadquarters of the police force and the detective staff, and on\r\nordinary days presents the appearance of a German fort.  Those\r\nacquainted with Dublin Castle declined to believe for a moment that\r\nprofessional thieves had entered this glorified police-station and\r\nstolen the most rigorously-guarded collection of jewels in the country.\r\n\r\nKing Edward and Queen Alexandra entered Ireland to the accompaniment of\r\nringing cheers, the people being independent of Crown jewels or any\r\nother baubles to symbolize their loyalty.  The Irish love a sportsman,\r\nand if he should happen to be a king as well they love him all the\r\nbetter for that.  The magnetic personality of Edward VII. and the\r\ninfectious charm of Queen Alexandra triumphed in Ireland, and everybody\r\nforgot for the time being that there was a Home Rule Government in\r\npower, and that a Liberal peer was their Majesties' host.  Dublin was\r\nfavoured greatly by the royal visitors, who daily performed some public\r\nact and received the salutations of the people.  Those who expected\r\nthat the absence of the Crown jewels would tend to depreciate the\r\nimportance and effect of the visit were disappointed agreeably.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to record that throughout the memorable visit\r\nof the king and queen {336} Lord and Lady Aberdeen displayed to the\r\nbest advantage those perfect social qualities for which they are\r\nrenowned in two continents.  Such a period is necessarily one of hard\r\nand often anxious work, and the thousand and one questions to be\r\nsettled offhand, the numberless applications for invitations to be\r\nstudied and settled, and the natural anxiety for the safety and comfort\r\nof their royal guests, are matters that would place the average person\r\nat a disadvantage.  Lord and Lady Aberdeen, however, have the happy\r\nquality of rising to the great heights great occasions demand, and so,\r\nif their Majesties' reception was tumultuous and their welcome regal,\r\nthat accorded day after day to the Lord-Lieutenant and his wife can be\r\ndescribed as viceregal.  Second only in popularity to their illustrious\r\nguests, they proved to the thousands of strangers who visit Ireland in\r\nthe wake of royalty that it is by no means certain that a Liberal\r\nviceroy cannot earn the affection of the country.  Common courtesy\r\nmight account for the respect royalty and royalty's representatives\r\nmeet with in Ireland, but only genuine affection could inspire the\r\nenthusiastic welcomes accorded to King Edward and his son and their\r\nviceroy, the Earl of Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Viceregal Commission appointed to inquire into the\r\ncircumstances of the theft of the Crown jewels appeared on February 1,\r\n1908.  It stated that Sir Arthur Vicars, the Ulster King of Arms, who\r\nwas the official custodian of the jewels, did not exercise due\r\nvigilance or proper care.  His resignation followed as a matter of\r\n{337} course, though it must be recorded that there was a general\r\nimpression that Sir Arthur Vicars had been made the official scapegoat.\r\nThe decision of the Commission by no means satisfied public opinion,\r\nand rumour raged furiously again, inspired by all sorts and conditions\r\nof statements said to have been omitted from the report, although\r\nstated in evidence before the Commissioners.  One of these days the\r\nsecret history of the disappearance of the Dublin Castle jewellery may\r\nbe revealed.  Until that time, it must be classed among the unsolved\r\nmysteries of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nA state visit to Belfast in the autumn of 1907, and the unveiling of a\r\nstatue of Queen Victoria in Dublin on February 15, 1908, were the most\r\nnotable events of these years.  The tragic death of the Hon. Ian\r\nArchibald Gordon, their Excellencies' youngest son, took place in\r\nNovember, 1909, the result of a motor-car accident.  Mr. Gordon had\r\njust become engaged to Miss Violet Asquith, the daughter of the Prime\r\nMinister, and the marriage had been looked forward to with pardonable\r\neagerness on both sides, as it would have united at the altar two\r\nfamilies bound together by many ties of friendship.  The engagement was\r\na secret until the fact was published that Lord Aberdeen's son was at\r\nthe point of death.  Great sympathy was expressed with his devoted\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Death of King Edward]\r\n\r\nThe termination of King Edward's brief and splendid reign necessarily\r\nplaced the court in mourning for twelve months, and the viceroyalty\r\nunderwent a period of quiescence.  King George's {338} accession was\r\nproclaimed in Dublin and other cities on May 11, 1910.\r\n\r\nThe visit of King George and Queen Mary in July, 1911, was the great\r\nevent of the year.  Fresh from the Coronation, their Majesties arrived\r\nin Dublin on July 8, holding a Levee, a garden-party, and a\r\ndrawing-room, reviewing troops in Phoenix Park, and visiting hospitals\r\nand institutions.  And all in five days!  The Prince of Wales and\r\nPrincess Mary of Wales accompanied their parents, and won for\r\nthemselves no little popularity.  The magnificent reception accorded to\r\nthe king and queen astonished even those who possessed a knowledge of\r\nprevious royal visits.  At times it exceeded in warmth that extended to\r\nKing Edward--a feat which many declared to be impossible until it was\r\nan accomplished fact.  Again Lord and Lady Aberdeen demonstrated their\r\nability and popularity.  Once more they were second only to the king\r\nand queen.  The perfect organization that had displayed itself on the\r\noccasion of King Edward's visit was seen again, and if their Majesties\r\nhad a most strenuous time, they were equally as pleased as their\r\nsubjects and their viceregal representatives.  Not a single discordant\r\nnote was struck throughout the series of public and private ceremonies\r\nperformed by the king and queen, and well might Nationalists fear that\r\nthe spectacle of Irish men and women outdoing the welcome accorded to\r\nthe king and queen at their Coronation would give to all the world the\r\nimpression that Ireland's dislike of England was purely a paper one.\r\n\r\n{339}\r\n\r\nWhen the visit was over, King George telegraphed from the royal yacht\r\nexpressing his thanks to Lord and Lady Aberdeen.\r\n\r\n'Having just arrived, after a most beautiful passage,' he said, 'the\r\nqueen and I, with the hearty cheers of the Irish people still ringing\r\nin our ears, wish once more to express to you and Lady Aberdeen our\r\nwarm appreciation of all your kindness and trouble to insure our stay\r\nin Dublin being a happy and pleasant one.  You have indeed succeeded,\r\nand we thank you sincerely.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Countess of Aberdeen]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lady Aberdeen]\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest days of her husband's viceroyalty Lady Aberdeen\r\nworked actively in connection with numerous philanthropic societies.  A\r\nchampion of women, with a record dating back to the seventies, her\r\nspecialities are the eradicating of consumption and the improvement of\r\nthe lot of female workers.  Her enthusiasm has led her into conflict\r\nwith the old order, but Lady Aberdeen has ever been inspired with the\r\nbest of motives, and she has done a great deal of good.\r\n\r\nLady Aberdeen founded the Women's National Health Association of\r\nIreland in 1907, and the fact that this society has united\r\nrepresentatives of every creed and party in the cause of public health\r\nand the stamping out of consumption has in itself wrought much indirect\r\ngood in all parts of Ireland, in addition to the direct result of\r\nreducing the death-rate from consumption by one-seventh in three years.\r\nThere are now over one hundred and fifty branches of this organization,\r\ncomposed of men and women representing all sections of the community,\r\nin all parts of Ireland, working {340} devotedly together for the\r\nwelfare and the happiness of the people as a whole; and these workers\r\nhave shown a power of initiative in meeting local needs by providing\r\nmeals for school-children; forming Babies' Clubs, where mothers and\r\ntheir elder daughters are taught how to care for the babies, and how to\r\nmake small resources go a long way in selecting nourishing food and\r\nsuitable garments; turning derelict spaces into garden playgrounds;\r\norganizing health lectures, health exhibitions, travelling health\r\ncaravans, besides supporting sanatoria, hospitals, convalescent homes,\r\nand maintaining nurses for the care of tuberculosis patients in their\r\nown homes.\r\n\r\nThe success of other notable undertakings might be quoted as an\r\nevidence of the support which the present occupants of the Viceregal\r\nLodge can count upon when they identify themselves with any special\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Lace Ball of 1907 at the Castle, the Pageant of Irish\r\nIndustries of 1909, the great Ui Breasail Exhibition and Fete of Irish\r\nIndustries and Health in 1911, visited by over 176,000 persons in\r\nfourteen days, of every shade of opinion and of every class of the\r\ncommunity, are events which will be long remembered in the Irish\r\ncapital in connection with Lord Aberdeen's lengthy reign.\r\n\r\nThere was a 'storm in a teacup' during the General Election of\r\nDecember, 1910, when Lord Aberdeen aroused the wrath of the\r\nConservatives and Unionists by telegraphing to the Liberal candidate in\r\nWest Aberdeenshire expressing his own belief that the apprehension that\r\nunder Home {341} Rule the Protestant minority would suffer was\r\nunfounded.  A Committee of Privileges composed of members of both\r\nHouses of Parliament inquired into the matter, and reported that they\r\nfound that the viceroy's action had not contravened any Standing Order\r\nor regulation.  This was accepted, and nothing more was heard of the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nFurther criticism fell his way when Ireland was in the grip of a\r\nrailway strike, and he was spending a holiday in Scotland.  There was a\r\nclamour for the viceroy's presence in Ireland.  He was already on his\r\nway thither, but though he had been successful in settling the\r\nCarriers' Strike some years previously, the present occasion did not\r\noffer an opportunity for personal mediation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The place-hunters]\r\n\r\nWhen his term of office ends, Lord Aberdeen can look back upon several\r\nyears of success in Ireland.  He may not be a racing man, and\r\nPunchestown may not be a favourite haunt of his, but sterner qualities\r\nthan a fondness for horse-racing are necessary to succeed as\r\nLord-Lieutenant of Ireland.  In the most favourable times it requires a\r\nvast amount of tact, a keen sense of humour, and a sense of proportion.\r\nPlace-hunters abound and office-seekers are innumerable.  Dublin Castle\r\nis regarded as the haven of hope for all younger sons without talent\r\nand briefless barristers hungering for a regular income.  They are all\r\nsuppliants of the Lord-Lieutenant, and several hundreds of years of\r\nascendancy have given them a sense of right in receiving favours, and\r\none of indignation and injustice in the case of refusal.  But when all\r\nis said and done, the {342} outcry over jobbery in Ireland is absurd,\r\nfor it is a fact that there is more jobbery in London in a month than\r\nin the whole of Ireland in a year.\r\n\r\nThere have been some attempts to abolish the viceroyalty, but if\r\nornamental it is also useful, because the Irish instinctively respect\r\nroyalty, and a country populated by the descendants of kings could not\r\nbe expected to have an instinctive respect for any form of government\r\nsavouring of Republicanism, or one that left wholly to the imagination\r\nthe majesty of the Sovereign ruler.\r\n\r\nTo satisfy all classes, to tolerate the intolerant, and to represent\r\nthe non-political King of England, although appointed for his political\r\nopinions, are the duties of the Lord-Lieutenant.  Surrounded by\r\nlynx-eyed critics, Tory and Nationalist, he has to be something more\r\nthan the shadow of the monarch, and he is not allowed to escape\r\ncriticism, although the king for whom he acts as deputy is supposed to\r\nbe above it.  It is not an enviable post, and never will be.  That Lord\r\nAberdeen and Lady Aberdeen have been successful nobody will deny, and\r\nIreland will lose two good friends when their term of office comes to\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Mr. Asquith's Home Rule Bill makes the Irish\r\nviceroy's position more delicate than ever.  Its success means the end\r\nof the official ascendancy, and bureaucracies always fight desperately\r\nuntil the first shot is fired.  When Liberalism has achieved its\r\nambition, the Irish bureaucracy will cease to hold the power that makes\r\nor mars every viceroyalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{343}\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abercorn, Marquis and first Duke of, 264\r\n  Abercorn's second viceroyalty, Duke of, 273\r\n  Aberdeen and Belfast, Lord, 332\r\n  Aberdeen and Gladstone, Lord, 295\r\n  Aberdeen, fourth Earl of, 257\r\n  Aberdeen's first viceroyalty, Lord, 295\r\n  Aberdeen, Lady, 296\r\n  Aberdeen's second viceroyalty, Lord, 326-342\r\n  Aberdeen, seventh Earl of, 295\r\n  Aberdeen's visit to Rome, Lord, 332\r\n  Abercromby, Sir Ralph, 204\r\n  Addison, Joseph, 131\r\n  Albert, visit of Prince, 300\r\n  Ambrose, Eleanor, 150\r\n  America, British North, 216\r\n  Andrews, Dr., 157, 175\r\n  Anglesey and George IV., Lord, 229\r\n  Anglesey and O'Connell, 234\r\n  Anglesey divorced, Lord, 230\r\n  Anglesey, Marquis of, 227\r\n  Anglesey on agitation, 232\r\n  Anglesey's second viceroyalty, Lord, 234\r\n  Anglo-Irish, Rise of, 31\r\n  Annesley, Arthur, 89\r\n  Armagh, Archbishop of, 52\r\n  Arran, Lord, 128\r\n  Asquith's Home Rule Bill, Mr., 342\r\n  Asquith, Miss Violet, 337\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bagenal, Sir Nicholas, 74\r\n  Balfour, Mr. A.
