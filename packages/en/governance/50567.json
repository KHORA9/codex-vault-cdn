Having found\r\nconditions there quite different from what I had expected, it was\r\nimpossible for me to state my actual impressions without danger of\r\nantagonizing or offending some whom I valued as friends. Hence, on\r\nlanding at New York, I refused to say anything upon those matters to\r\nseveral reporters who interviewed me. A little later, the _Chicago\r\nTribune_ asked me to write upon these subjects, urging the importance of\r\nthe whole matter to our nation, and leaving me entire freedom in\r\nviewpoint and mode of treatment. In response to its request, I prepared\r\na series of articles, which appeared in successive issues from January\r\n20 to February 3, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe articles were received with general interest, and many asked that\r\nthey should be reprinted in book form. I felt that they were of\r\nmomentary interest only, and as I have much other Congo matter for books\r\nand pamphlets—more directly in the line of my professional work—I was\r\ninclined not to reprint them. But I soon found myself the subject of\r\nbitter attack. Malicious and untrue statements were made regarding me\r\nand my motives. I have concluded, therefore, that it is best that my\r\narticles should be accessible to all who are interested. What I wrote, I\r\nam ready to defend. I am not ready to be judged from misquotations, or\r\ncondemned for what I never wrote. Hence this book.\r\n\r\nI am not personally responsible for the title—_The Truth about the\r\nCongo_. Although I believe all my statements are true, I should not have\r\nselected that title for my articles. No man can say all that is true on\r\nany subject, and I do not arrogate to myself a monopoly in\r\ntruth-telling, either about the Congo or any other topic. But after my\r\nannouncement under that heading, I decided to let it stand. I preferred\r\nsome less assertive title, but I am content. So I use the same title for\r\nthis book. The headlines of the articles, however, I have suppressed.\r\nThey were not of my preparation and did not adequately suggest the\r\nmatter or the treatment. The articles are reprinted with no changes\r\nexcept corrections in spelling, punctuation, or mistaken words.\r\n\r\nNo man more desires the happiness and progress of the Congo natives than\r\ndo I. I know them pretty well. I am their friend; they are my friends. I\r\nshall be glad if what I here present makes them and their cause better\r\nknown to thoughtful and sympathetic men and women, Mere emotion, however\r\nviolent, will not help them. Stubborn refusal to recognize and encourage\r\nreforms, which have been seriously undertaken for their betterment, will\r\nonly harm them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE TRUTH ABOUT THE CONGO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 20, 1907.\r\n\r\nMY own interest in the Congo Free State began at the St. Louis\r\nexposition. As is well known, that exposition made a special feature of\r\ngroups of representatives of tribes from various parts of the world.\r\nThese natives dressed in native dress, lived in native houses, and so\r\nfar as possible reproduced an accurate picture of the daily life to\r\nwhich they were accustomed in their homes.\r\n\r\nAmong the groups there brought together was one of Congo natives. This\r\ngroup was commonly known as the pygmy group, though but four out of the\r\nnine members composing it made claims to be such. The group was brought\r\nby Mr. S. P. Verner, at one time missionary to the Congo, who was\r\nengaged by the exposition to make a special journey into central Africa\r\nto procure it. Four members of the group were Batua, the others were\r\nlarge blacks representing the Bakuba and Baluba.\r\n\r\nThe idea of visiting Africa was one which I had never seriously\r\nentertained, but in the study of these Congolese it seemed to me that\r\nthere were interesting questions the solution of which would well repay\r\na visit. The consequence was, that I determined to visit the Congo Free\r\nState—and specifically that part of the state from which these natives\r\nhad been brought.\r\n\r\nAbout this time I received considerable literature from the Congo Reform\r\nAssociation at Boston, the reading of which had its influence in\r\ndeciding me to undertake the expedition.\r\n\r\nAfter reading this literature I started for the Congo, fully prepared to\r\nsee all kinds of horrors. I supposed that mutilations, cruelties, and\r\natrocities of the most frightful kinds would everywhere present\r\nthemselves. I expected to find a people everywhere suffering, mourning,\r\nand in unhappiness.\r\n\r\nMy errand, however, was not that of a searcher after all these dreadful\r\nthings, but purely that of a student of human races, with definite\r\nquestions for investigation.\r\n\r\nI may say that my opportunities for forming an opinion of conditions in\r\nthe Congo have been exceptional. Mine was no hasty journey, but a tarry\r\nin the country extending over more than one year.\r\n\r\nWhile my original plan was to spend the greater portion of my time in\r\nthe district ruled by the Bakuba chief, Ndombe, with but a short period\r\nin other parts of the state, I had decided before reaching the mouth of\r\nthe Congo to more evenly distribute my time, and to see far more of the\r\nCongo proper than I at first intended. As a consequence, I went first\r\ninto the Kasai district, where I spent four months, after which,\r\nreturning to Leopoldville, I went up the main river to the head of\r\nnavigation, and even beyond, to Ponthierville, the terminus of the newly\r\nbuilt line of railroad. We also went up the Aruwimi, to the famous\r\nYambuya camp, where the navigation of that river is interrupted by\r\ncataracts.\r\n\r\nI have, therefore, seen not only the lower Congo, which has been so\r\nfrequently visited in recent years, but traveled thousands of miles upon\r\nthe great river and two of its most important tributaries.\r\n\r\nIn this extended journey I came into constant contact with\r\nrepresentatives of the three groups of white men who live in the Congo\r\nFree State—state officials, missionaries, and traders. I had repeated\r\nconversations with them all, and have heard opinions upon the Congo\r\nState from these diverse points of view.\r\n\r\nMy position with reference to Congo matters is peculiar, doubly so. I\r\nmay even say it is unique. My journey was made at my own expense; I was\r\nnot the representative of any institution, society, or body. I was\r\nwithout instructions, and my observations were untrammeled by any\r\ndemands or conditions from outside.\r\n\r\nWhile I am under many and weighty obligations to scores of state\r\nofficials, missionaries, and traders, I am not prevented from speaking\r\nmy mind in regard to any and every matter. Both to the missionaries,\r\nstate officials, and traders I paid board and lodging at every stopping\r\npoint—with the single exception of one American mission station—a fact\r\nwhich leaves me freedom. While the state facilitated my visit and my\r\nwork in many ways, I was not, at any time, in relations with it of such\r\na kind as to interfere with free observations or free expression. I made\r\nthis entirely clear on my first visit to the state authorities at\r\nBrussels, and it was understood by them that I should speak freely and\r\nfrankly of everything which I should see. On their part, the state\r\nauthorities expressed the liveliest satisfaction that an independent\r\nAmerican traveler should visit the Congo Free State, and said that they\r\ndid not wish anything concealed or attenuated, as they felt sure that\r\nsuch a visit as mine could only do them good.\r\n\r\nI have said that my position was doubly peculiar. I was not only\r\nindependent and untrammeled in observation and expression, but my\r\npersonal attitude to the whole question of colonization and\r\nadministration by a foreign power, of natives, is radical. Personally I\r\ndislike the effort to elevate, civilize, remake a people. I should\r\nprefer to leave the African as he was before white contact. It is my\r\nbelief that there is no people so weak or so degraded as to be incapable\r\nof self-government. I believe that every people is happier and better\r\nwith self-government, no matter how unlike our own form that government\r\nmay be. I feel that no nation is good enough, or wise enough, or\r\nsufficiently advanced to undertake the elevation and civilization of a\r\n“lower” people. Still less do I approve the exploitation of a native\r\npopulation by outsiders for their own benefit. Nor do I feel that even\r\nthe development of British trade warrants interference with native life,\r\ncustoms, laws, and lands. I know, however, that these views are\r\nunpopular and heretical.\r\n\r\nIn the series of articles, then, which I have been asked to prepare, I\r\nshall try to take the standpoint of the practical man, the business man,\r\nthe man of affairs, the philanthropist, the missionary. All these agree\r\nthat civilized folk have a perfect right to interfere with any native\r\ntribe too weak to resist their encroachment. They agree that it is\r\nperfectly right to trample under foot native customs, institutions,\r\nideas—to change and modify, to introduce innovations, either to develop\r\ntrade, to exploit a country, to elevate a race, or to save souls. I am\r\nforced, then, to look at Congo matters from the point of view of these\r\neminently practical men.\r\n\r\nOf course, I saw much to criticise. It is true that there are floggings,\r\nand chain-gangs, and prisons. I have seen them all repeatedly. But there\r\nare floggings, chain-gangs, and prisons in the United States.\r\nMutilations are so rare that one must seek for them; and I had too much\r\nelse to do. There is taxation—yes, heavy taxation—a matter which I\r\nshall discuss quite fully further on. And in connection with taxation\r\nthere is forced labor, a matter which, of course, I disapprove, but it\r\nappears as just to all the groups of eminently practical men to whom I\r\nhave referred. There are, no doubt, hostages in numbers, but I saw less\r\nthan a dozen. And the whole matter of hostages is one which merits\r\ncareful and candid discussion. And I know that in many a large district\r\nthe population is much smaller than in former times. The causes of this\r\ndiminution in numbers are many and various, and to them I shall return.\r\n\r\nFlogging, chain-gang, prison, mutilation, heavy taxation, hostages,\r\ndepopulation—all these I saw, but at no time and at no place were they\r\nso flagrant as to force themselves upon attention. And of frightful\r\noutrages, such as I had expected to meet everywhere, I may almost say\r\nthere was nothing. It is, of course, but fair to state that I was not in\r\nthe district of the A. B. I. R. I cannot believe, however, that\r\nconditions in that district are so appalling as the newspaper reports\r\nwould indicate.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I found at many places a condition of the negro\r\npopulation far happier than I had dreamed it possible. The negro of the\r\nCongo—or Bantu, if you please—is a born trader. He is imitative to a\r\ndegree. He is acquisitive, and charmed with novelties. He is bright and\r\nquick, remarkably intelligent. He readily acquires new languages, and it\r\nis no uncommon thing to find a Congo Bantu who can speak six or seven\r\nlanguages besides his own. In disposition variable and emotional, he\r\nquickly forgets his sorrow. I saw hundreds of natives who were working\r\nhappily, living in good houses, dressing in good clothes of European\r\nstuff and pattern, and saving property. That this number will rapidly\r\nincrease I have no doubt.\r\n\r\nAnd now, on my return, after having many of my preconceived ideas\r\ncompletely shattered, and feeling on the whole that things in Congoland\r\nare not so bad, and that improvement is the order of the day, I am\r\nstartled to find the greatest excitement. Pages of newspapers are filled\r\nwith stories of atrocities, many of which never happened, some of which\r\nare ancient, and a part of which, recent in date, are true.\r\n\r\nI find a fierce excitement about the Belgium lobby, vigorous resolutions\r\npresented in the senate, and the President of the United States\r\noutrunning his most urgent supporters and advisers, ready to take some\r\ndrastic action to ameliorate the conditions of the suffering millions in\r\nthe Congo Free State. The surprise is so much the greater, as my latest\r\ninformation regarding the American official attitude had been gained\r\nfrom the letter written by Secretary Root some months ago.\r\n\r\nWhat can be the reason of such prodigious and sudden change?\r\n\r\nWhat has happened in the Congo since April to produce the present state\r\nof mind? What is the motive underlying the bitter attacks upon Leopold\r\nand the Free State which he established? Is it truly humanitarian? Or\r\nare the laudable impulses and praiseworthy sympathies of two great\r\npeople being used for hidden and sinister ends of politics?\r\n\r\nI do not claim infallibility. I do claim that my having spent a year in\r\nthe Congo Free State, independently, should qualify me to express\r\nopinions on the conditions. I have heard both sides. I have traveled\r\nthousands of miles in Congo territory. I have visited natives of\r\ntwenty-eight different tribes. No interference has been placed in my\r\nway. I have gone where I pleased, and when and how I pleased. No\r\npreparations have been made with reference to my visits. I believe no\r\nchanges in practice have been produced by my presence.\r\n\r\nIn the series of articles before us it is my intention to present in\r\ndetail what I have seen, and much of what I have heard, in the Congo\r\nIndependent State. I may make errors, but I shall tell no intentional\r\nfalsehoods. I shall criticise what deserves criticism. I shall praise\r\nwhat is praiseworthy. I trust that those who are interested in forming a\r\ntrue idea of Congo conditions may find something useful in my\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nAt this point it is necessary for us to know something of the Congo\r\nnative himself. In Dark Africa—for northern Africa is and always has\r\nbeen a white man’s country—there are three negro or negroid masses.\r\nThere is little doubt that the original inhabitants of the continent\r\nwere dwarf people, ancestors of the pygmies of the high Ituri forest,\r\nand the Batua of the upper Kasai.\r\n\r\nTo-day the pygmies are mere fragments, scattered and separated, but\r\nretaining with tenacity their ancient life. They are the same to-day as\r\nthey were 5,000 years ago, when they were objects of interest to the old\r\nEgyptians. Little in stature, scrawny in form, with a face shrewd,\r\ncunning, and sly, the pygmy is a hunter. With his bows and poisoned\r\narrows he kills the game of the forests and makes no pretense of doing\r\naught in agriculture. He is universally feared by the large blacks in\r\nthe neighborhood of whose towns he settles. He trades his game for\r\nagricultural products with his large neighbors.\r\n\r\nIn the Soudan and neighboring parts of western Africa live the true\r\nnegroes, notable for their thick lips, projecting lower faces, and dark\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThroughout southern Africa we find a group of populations much lighter\r\nin color, and on the whole more attractive in appearance, than the true\r\nnegro. These tribes, plainly related in language, are no doubt of one\r\nblood, and are called Bantu. The name is unfortunate, as the word bantu\r\nsimply means “men” in that group of languages. Practically the whole of\r\nthe Congo population are Bantu—there being almost no true negroes and\r\nbut few pygmies in the area.\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if the Congo native should be so well known by this\r\ntime that the current description of him in the text-books would be\r\naccurate; yet, at least in two respects, these stereotyped accounts are\r\nwrong. The Congo Bantu are not long-headed, and it is not true that they\r\ndiffer from the real negro in the absence of a characteristic and\r\ndisagreeable odor. There are scores of Bantu tribes, each with its own\r\nlanguage and minor peculiarities in appearance and life. It would be\r\nuntrue to say that all smell badly, but I have often wished the writers\r\nof the books could be shut up a while in the same room with, for\r\nexample, a group of Bobangi. It is certain that no type of African\r\nsmells worse.\r\n\r\nIt would be, however, a mistake to think that the Bantu are dirty. Far\r\nfrom it. I have repeatedly observed my carriers, when we came to some\r\nbrook in the forest, set their loads aside, strip themselves when\r\nnecessary, and bathe in the fresh cool water. They are scrupulous in\r\nattention to their teeth, and use, often several times a day, a little\r\nstick of wood, somewhat larger than a lead-pencil, shredded at one end,\r\nto clean their teeth. The instrument, by the way, serves its purpose far\r\nbetter than our own toothbrushes.\r\n\r\nAccording to his tribe, the Bantu may be short, medium, or tall. King\r\nNdombe of the Bakuba measures six feet three in stature, and is\r\nwell-built, though not heavy. Among the Bakuba, Baluba, Batetela, and\r\nBakete, tall statures are common. It is rare, however, that the Bantu\r\npresent what we would call finely developed forms; their chest is often\r\nflat and sunken; their shoulders not well thrown backward; and the\r\nmusculature of their back, their chest, arms, and legs, is poor. Of\r\ncourse, there are exceptions, and one sometimes sees magnificently\r\ndeveloped specimens. In the lower Congo, where on the whole the men are\r\nshorter, they make excellent carriers. In the old caravan days the\r\nstandard burden was sixty or seventy pounds, and a man would carry it\r\nwithout difficulty all the working day. The Kasai tribes are poor\r\ncarriers and indifferent workers. The chopbox of sixty pounds weight,\r\nwhich the lower Congo man shoulders easily and carries without\r\ncomplaint, will be slung to a pole to be borne by two carriers among the\r\nBaluba.\r\n\r\nIn life the Bantu populations, so far as the Congo is concerned, present\r\nnotable general uniformity. The general pattern is the same everywhere,\r\nthough there are local and tribal differences of minor sort. Thus,\r\nalmost every tribe has its own tribal marks cut into the flesh of face\r\nor body.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the members of one tribe may be distinguished by their mode\r\nof dressing the hair. To a less degree, the form to which the teeth are\r\nchipped and broken mark tribal differences. It may almost be said that\r\nno two tribes in all the Congo build houses that are just alike, and\r\nalmost every tribe has its characteristic mode of arranging the houses\r\nin a group. Thus, in one tribe the houses will be arranged in continuous\r\nlines, one on each side of a straight road; in another the houses may be\r\ngrouped around the three sides of a square, the group belonging to a\r\nsingle chieftain and being succeeded in the village by other similar\r\ngroups of buildings; in another the houses will be arranged in two\r\ncurved lines, leaving the open space in the center of the village oval\r\nor elliptical. The chairs or stools of one tribe will differ in form and\r\ndecoration from those of another; so will the wooden spoons, the\r\nstirring-sticks, the combs, the dress and ornaments.\r\n\r\nThe Congo natives for the most part still lead a tribal life. A chief is\r\nthe head of a little community clustered about him. He may not be the\r\nchief of a whole village; for example, at Bomanih, on the Aruwimi, there\r\nare three chiefs. Each one has his own cluster of houses, and though the\r\nthree clusters are arranged continuously in two, parallel, straight\r\nlines, every native of the village knows precisely where the domain of\r\nthe individual chief ends or begins.\r\n\r\nThe power and authority of the chief has been greatly weakened by\r\ncontact with the whites, but he still retains great influence. At least\r\nover the members of his own household, including, of course, his slaves,\r\nhe had the power of life and death. In large affairs, interesting a\r\nconsiderable number of people, he usually acted on the advice and\r\nopinion of his fellows as expressed in a village or tribal palaver. The\r\nchief was, and still is, distinguished from the common people by his\r\ndress and ornaments. He is usually a man of wealth, and has a\r\nconsiderable number of people actually dependent upon him, subject to\r\nhis orders, and a force upon which he can depend in case of war or\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nWhen I first entered the Congo my heart sank, for it seemed as if the\r\nnative life was gone. In fact, in letters written from Matadi I doubted\r\nwhether I had not come too late for aught of interest. My spirits began\r\nto revive, however, with the railroad journey from Matadi to\r\nLeopoldville. Groups of natives, with scanty dress and barbaric\r\nornaments, replaced those who at Matadi and its neighborhood gathered at\r\nthe station to see the train pass.\r\n\r\nIn my first walk from the mission house where I lodged at Leo, within\r\nthree minutes’ walk of the mission I found a little cluster of Bateke\r\nhouses which, with its inhabitants, much delighted me.\r\n\r\nAlmost naked women, with abundance of beads and teeth hung at their\r\nnecks as ornaments, with hair elaborately dressed and bodies smeared\r\nwith red camwood powder, squatted on the ground, were making native\r\npottery in graceful forms.\r\n\r\nIn the shade in front of the door of one of the houses was a true\r\nbarbarian, lord of the place. By rare good luck he spoke a little\r\nEnglish, so that we were able to carry on a conversation. When I asked\r\nhim who the women were, he replied that they were his wives. I think\r\nthere were three of them, and it was my first introduction to African\r\npolygamy. Each of these women occupied a separate house. Each of them\r\nhad a garden patch in which she worked. All of them contributed to the\r\nimportance and support of their husband.\r\n\r\nPolygamy, of course, prevails throughout Dark Africa. But do not\r\nmisunderstand me. I do not use the word “dark” to characterize polygamy.\r\nIt is a settled institution which seems to work quite well. Later on I\r\nsaw the wives of Ndombe, thirty-four in number. Ndombe is a really\r\nimportant chief, but compared with some whom we met or of whom we heard\r\nin the Upper Congo, he was but scantily equipped. Sixty, seventy, a\r\nhundred, or hundreds of wives and female slaves, which count for much\r\nthe same, are in possession of great chieftains. There is, of course,\r\nalways one favorite or principal wife. When Ndombe used to come, as he\r\nfrequently did, to my house to see the stereoscopic pictures, he\r\nfrequently brought his favorite wife with him. She was a pretty\r\ncreature—young and plump, graceful and modest. She wore good cloth and\r\nany quantity of beads and brass arm and leg rings.\r\n\r\nIn every case the women of a chief or rich man live in separate houses,\r\neach having her own. Until a man is married he is but little thought of.\r\nThe greater the number of his wives, the more important he becomes. As\r\neach one cultivates a field and does other productive labor, it will be\r\nseen that the man with the most wives is the richest man.\r\n\r\nThe man has his own house, but visits and lives in the houses of his\r\nwives in turn. The child in Africa is rarely weaned before it is two or\r\nthree years old, and during the period of time when a child is unweaned\r\nthe father has no marital relations with the woman. On the whole, there\r\nis less quarreling among the wives of a polygamic husband than one would\r\nexpect. Bantu women, however, are often termagants, as women elsewhere,\r\nand at times the chief’s house group is lively.\r\n\r\nDomestic slavery still flourishes. The state, of course, has done much\r\nto end the actual slave trade for supplying white men and Arabs. It is,\r\nhowever, difficult to deal with the matter of domestic slavery, and in\r\nfact is scarcely worth the candle.\r\n\r\nEvery chief or man of any consequence has slaves. Calamba, my\r\ninterpreter, at Ndombe, though a young fellow, probably not more than\r\n25, had two. It is rare that the lot of the domestic slave is unhappy.\r\nIt is usually women or children who are bought, and they are treated in\r\nall respects as if members of the family. Little is required of them in\r\nthe way of work and service, and they must absolutely be provided for by\r\nthe master, who is also frequently responsible before the public for\r\ntheir misdeeds. Formerly, of course, there was the possibility of being\r\nkilled upon a festal occasion, the accession of the chief to increased\r\npower, or to grace his funeral. Within those districts where the state\r\nhas a firm hold and strong influence this possibility is done away with,\r\nand the most serious disadvantage in being a slave is thus removed.\r\nSlaves may become rich men, and not infrequently themselves hold slaves.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking characteristic of the Bantu, as of the true\r\nnegro, is his emotionality—one instant joyous, the next in tears.\r\nVowing vengeance for an injury to-day, he is on the happiest terms with\r\nhis injurer to-morrow. He laughs, sings, dances. Of all the\r\nintroductions of the white man, perhaps the accordion is the favorite.\r\nMen use it, but women play it constantly. Most of them play one song\r\npiece only, and one may hear it from one end of the state to the other\r\nat every hour of the day and night. Of course, there are native\r\ninstruments in plenty, drums of every size and form, from the small hand\r\ndrum, made by stretching a skin across an earthen pot three or four\r\ninches in diameter, up to the great cylindrical, horizontal drum made by\r\nhollowing logs a yard in diameter and ten feet long. There are horns,\r\nfifes, pipes, and whistles, and a great series of stringed instruments,\r\nranging from the musical bow with but one cord to lutes with ten or\r\ntwelve. Of course, the instrumental music goes with the dancing.\r\n\r\nThe native is born to dance. Babies, two or three years old, dance with\r\ntheir elders. Men dance together; women have their special forms; but in\r\nthe majority of cases the two sexes dance together. There is, however,\r\nnothing like our waltzes or round dancing, individuals keeping\r\nthemselves separate. The dances are most frequent and lively when the\r\nmoon is growing. On moonlight nights hundreds of people—men, women, and\r\nchildren—gather at dusk, and to the noise of drums dance wildly, often\r\ntill morning. It is no uncommon thing for people working on plantations\r\nto work all day and dance almost all night, and this day after day.\r\nWhile some of the dances are extremely graceful, most of them are\r\nobscene and are followed often by frightful orgies.\r\n\r\nOne thing greatly interested me. Had I been asked before my trip to\r\nAfrica about the cake-walk—a form of amusement which I love to see—I\r\nshould have said that it originated in America among the black folk of\r\nour southern states. But no, the cake-walk is no American invention. In\r\nevery part of the Congo one may see it—even in regions where white\r\ninfluence has seldom penetrated. The American cake-walk is an immigrant.\r\n\r\nThe Bantu child is wonderfully precocious. This precocity displays\r\nitself in everything. The children run about with perfect freedom,\r\ninstead of tottering along, one unsteady step after another, as our\r\nchildren of the same age. They speak astonishingly soon. A babe in arms\r\neats solid food—notwithstanding the fact that it is not weaned until\r\ntwo or three years of age—shockingly early. The little child imitates\r\nthe every action of its older friends. Children of four or five, in\r\nshrewdness, comprehension, and intelligence, are like our ten-year-olds.\r\nThis precocity suggests the fact of early ripening. As a fact, boys of\r\nsixteen and girls of thirteen are frequently ready for marriage. A man\r\nof twenty-five is in the prime of life, a man of thirty aged, and on the\r\nwhole the term of life closes at thirty-five.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 21, 1907.\r\n\r\nLIFE is easy in the tropics. Wants are few. A house to live in can be\r\nbuilt in a few hours. Food can be gathered or produced with little\r\nlabor. Dress is needless. Where life is easy there is little impulse to\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nThe chief incentive to the Bantu to work is to secure the wherewithal to\r\nbuy a wife. The boy, who, through a careless, happy childhood, has done\r\nnaught but play, begins to think of settling down. But to have a wife he\r\nmust have money or its equivalent. So he goes to work. It may require a\r\nyear or more before he has the pieces of cloth which are necessary for\r\nthe purchase of his desired loved one. The same stimulus which impelled\r\nhim to labor for one wife may prod him to efforts for others. But with\r\nthe establishment of a home, and the purchase of two or three wives to\r\ncare for him and produce him wealth, his work is done. From fourteen\r\nyears to twenty-five is his working period. Before that time a child,\r\nafter that time he is a man of means. What wealth comes later comes\r\nthrough the women and their labor, and through trade.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated that the Bantu is notably acquisitive. Wealth,\r\napart from women and slaves, is counted mostly in cloth. One of the\r\nchief aims in life is to accumulate cloth, not for use as clothing, but\r\nas evidence of wealth and for the final display when the man dies and is\r\nburied. Among the Lower Congo tribes the dead body is wrapped in piece\r\nafter piece of cloth, until the body disappears in a mass of wrappings\r\nmade of scores of pieces, each piece consisting of eight or sixteen\r\nyards, as the case may be. Young men have cloth, and it is most\r\ninteresting to look through the boxes of the “boys.” At Basoko we were\r\nrobbed, and the authorities instituted a search. I was asked to inspect\r\nthe boxes of all the workmen on the place. Without warning, every man\r\nand boy had to open his trunk, chest, tin box, or other store. I saw\r\nyoung fellows of no more than sixteen or seventeen years who had a dozen\r\npieces of good cloth carefully folded away, watches, jewelry, ornaments,\r\nknives, dishes—every kind of white man’s tradestuff that could be\r\nimagined. When they are thirty those “boys” will be rich men, with\r\nwomen, slaves, and piles of stuff.\r\n\r\nThe government of the Free State has issued coins for native use. There\r\nare large coppers of the value of one, two, five, and ten centimes.\r\nThere are silver coins of half-franc, franc, two franc, and five franc\r\nvalue. But these coins have no circulation beyond Leopoldville. In the\r\nKasai district and the Upper Congo every commercial transaction is done\r\nby barter.\r\n\r\nCertain things are so constantly in use as to have fixed values. For\r\narticles of trifling value nothing is so good as salt. A standard which\r\nvaries from place to place is the brass rod, or mitaku. This is simply a\r\npiece of brass wire of certain length. The mitaku in the Lower Congo are\r\nshort, those in the Upper Congo much longer. Beads have ever been used\r\nin trade, but the wise traveler avoids them, as their value has\r\ndwindled, and the taste not only varies from place to place, but from\r\ntime to time. The bead which one traveler found useful in a given\r\ndistrict may have lost its attractiveness before the next traveler,\r\nloaded with a large supply, comes that way.\r\n\r\nAt Ndombe the brass rod has no vogue. There the cowries (sea shells) are\r\nthe standard in small transactions. Cowries were once used in many parts\r\nof Africa, but in most places have ceased to have value. Ndombe,\r\nhowever, arrogates to himself and family the sole right of wearing brass\r\narm and leg rings. Hence mitaku are not used, and the old-fashioned\r\ncowry remains. But the chief tradestuff, of course, is cloth. With it\r\nyou may buy chickens or goats, pigs or wives. In the Upper Kasai a piece\r\nof cloth means eight yards—“four fathoms.” In the Upper Congo a piece\r\nof cloth is sixteen yards, or eight fathoms. Formerly at Ndombe eight or\r\nten chickens were given for a piece of cloth, value five francs, or one\r\ndollar in our currency. To-day one must pay a fathom for each fowl.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to introduce the use of corn among the natives was\r\nunsatisfactory alike to the people and the trader. It has, however,\r\ntaken hold strongly in the Lower Congo, and in time the use of true\r\nmoney must push its way up the river. Curious is the contempt of all for\r\ncoppers. Ten centimes in Belgium would give delight to many a boy of\r\ntwelve or fifteen years. The Congo native frequently throws it away or\r\nreturns it to the person who gave it to him. Nothing less than a\r\nhalf-franc piece—ten cents—is valued.\r\n\r\nI have seen this illustrated many, many times, the first time in my own\r\ncase. We were visiting a miserable fishing village of poor Bakongo. As I\r\nentered the village a naked child, no more than two or three years old,\r\nmet me. I smiled at him and he at me. I extended my hand, which he\r\nclasped and accompanied me for half an hour as I wandered from house to\r\nhouse, never once relaxing his hold upon my fingers. It caused great\r\namusement to the adult portion of the village, as apparently the little\r\none rarely made such friendships. When I was about to leave I took a ten\r\ncentime piece from my pocket and gave it to him. Such a look of disgust\r\nas came over his face would not be expected in any one short of adult\r\nyears. It was the last time that I gave a copper to a native.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably one of the most striking characteristics of the Congo\r\npeople is loquacity. Their tongues hang loosely, and wag incessantly.\r\nAnything will do to talk about. Start one and he will talk until you\r\nstop him. Quarrels, troubles, friendships, joys, plans, and\r\nachievements, all are retailed at any hour of the day or night. When\r\nexcited, several will talk together with great vivacity, though it is\r\nplain that no one knows what any other is saying.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief occupations of the man is the palaver. The Portuguese\r\nterm applies to any serious consultation on any subject, pleasant or\r\notherwise. A palaver may be confined to chiefs or it may include\r\npractically all the men of one or more villages. In many towns there is\r\na place for gathering for palavers under a tree known as the palaver\r\ntree. Those who participate in a palaver bring their chairs or stools or\r\na roll of skin, which they place upon the ground to sit upon. At the\r\nbeginning there is more or less formality, and each one presents his\r\nview decently and in order; sometimes, however, hubbub ensues,\r\ndisturbance arises, and the palaver breaks up in disorder. In these\r\npalavers frequently speeches of great length and finished oratory are\r\ndelivered. Not only are the emotions played upon by the speaker, but\r\nkeen argument is employed, and the appeal is made to the intelligence.\r\n\r\nAll matters of consequence—tribal, inter-tribal, and dealings with the\r\nwhite man—are settled in palavers. The white man who knows the natives\r\nis wise to conform to native customs. If he has some difficulty to\r\nsettle, some favor to ask, some business to arrange, he will do well to\r\nhave a formal palaver called in which he himself participates.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of my second visit to Ndombe I found the town in great\r\nexcitement. Going to the chief’s headquarters, we found a great palaver\r\nin progress. Our coming was looked upon as a favorable omen, and with\r\nmuch formality chairs were brought and placed for us in the midst of the\r\ngathering. The remarks were translated to me as they were made.\r\n\r\nNdombe’s town is really an aggregation of villages. Not one but four\r\ndifferent tribes are represented in the population. The central town,\r\nwalled and of Bakuba style, was Ndombe’s own. Three or four Bakete towns\r\nwere clustered near it. In another direction were several Baluba towns,\r\nand close by them small villages of Batua. These four populations,\r\nthough living by themselves, were all subject to Ndombe, and the group\r\nof villages taken together made a town of some pretension.\r\n\r\nThe day before our visit, there had been a battle with the Bakete in\r\nwhich several men had been wounded, though none were killed. The trouble\r\nwas taxes. The state demanded increased payments. The proud Bakuba\r\ndecided that the Bakete should pay the new tax, and so informed them.\r\nAgainst this there had been a feeling of rebellion, and the Bakete\r\nrefused to pay the tax. Hence the battle. All were greatly excited. The\r\nspeeches were full of fire. The men—Bakuba—challenged each other to\r\nshow mighty deeds of valor; they belittled and derided the unfortunate\r\nBakete; they drew unpleasant contrasts between themselves and their\r\nvassals.\r\n\r\nMany of the speeches were fine efforts, and the words were emphasized by\r\nthe most graceful and vigorous gesticulation. Finally an old woman\r\ncrowded in from one side where she had been listening to the speeches.\r\nIn impassioned language she described the heavy labors which the women\r\nof the tribe already endured. They could stand no more. If the Bakuba\r\nwere men let them prove it now or forever after remain silent. Force the\r\nBakete to work. Put no more heavy tasks upon your mothers, wives, and\r\nsisters. The old woman’s speech stirred the audience, and the meeting\r\nbroke up, the men hurrying to prepare themselves for a new battle.\r\n\r\nThe market was among the most important institutions of the Congo\r\nnative. It retains importance to the present day. In the Lower Congo a\r\nweek consisted of four days, and market was held at each market-place\r\nonce a week. The markets were named from the day of the week on which\r\nthey were held. Thus, a Nsona market was a market held on the day of\r\nthat name.\r\n\r\nTo these markets people came in numbers from all the country round, and\r\nit was no uncommon thing to see thousands thus gathered. There were\r\nspecial places for certain products. Thus, women who brought pottery for\r\nsale occupied a set place; those who brought bananas would be grouped\r\ntogether in their section; sellers of camwood, sweet potatoes, kwanga\r\n(native cassava bread), palm wine, oil, salt, fowls, pigs, goats—all\r\noccupied places well known to the frequenters of the market. In the\r\nolden times, of course, there was a section devoted to the sale of\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nSuch a market presented a scene of active life and movement. Yet order\r\nwas preserved. No crime was considered more serious than the disturbance\r\nof a market. Such an act deserved severest punishment, and those in\r\nwhose hands the maintenance of order lay never hesitated to kill the\r\noffender at once, and to make a public display of his punishment as a\r\nwarning to all.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that the Congo native is cruel, and this cruelty\r\nshows itself in many ways. The killing of slaves was extremely common.\r\nIt is true that it was never carried to the extreme in Congoland that it\r\nreached in some true negro kingdoms, as Dahomey and Benin. It was,\r\nhowever, customary to kill slaves on the occasion of the death of a man\r\nof any consequence. The body of one of the slaves thus killed was placed\r\nfirst in the grave to serve as a pillow for the dead man. It was a\r\ncommon practice to preserve the skulls of victims sacrificed on such\r\noccasions as memorials.\r\n\r\nNot only were slaves sacrificed to grace the funeral ceremony of chiefs,\r\nbut often one or more were killed upon occasions of festivity and joy.\r\nKing Ndombe once presented me a skull. It was that of a Batua slave who\r\nhad been killed upon the occasion of the chief’s coming into power. In\r\nthis case, apparently, judging by the condition of the skull, the victim\r\nhad been killed by simply knocking in his head.\r\n\r\nUntil lately all through the Congo public executions were of a more\r\nformal character than this. At Lake Mantumba we were shown the exact\r\nmode of procedure. A sort of stool or seat was set upon the ground and\r\nsticks were tightly driven in around it, in such a way as to limit the\r\nmotions of the victim after he was seated; in fact, to almost prevent\r\nall movement. A sapling was then thrust in the ground. A sort of cage or\r\nframework made of pliant branches was fixed about the head of the\r\nvictim. The sapling was then bent over in an arch and firmly fastened to\r\nthe cage, thus holding the head firmly and stretching the neck tense and\r\nhard. The hands were tied together, as were the feet. When all was ready\r\nthe executioner with his great knife at a single blow struck off the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nEnemies killed in battle were often mutilated, and fingers, nails,\r\nbones, or the skulls were treasured as trophies. When the white men\r\nfirst visited the villages of the Upper Congo there was scarce a house\r\nwithout its ghastly trophy, and the houses of great chiefs displayed\r\nbaskets filled with skulls.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the Congo native has as keen a sense of physical\r\nsuffering as ourselves. In almost every tribe men and sometimes women,\r\nare marked with tribal marks upon the face or body; thus, among the\r\nBangala each member of the tribe bears a projection like a cock’s comb\r\nrunning vertically across the forehead from the nose root to the hair\r\nline. This excrescence is frequently three-quarters of an inch in\r\nbreadth and of the same elevation. Its development begins in childhood,\r\nwhen a series of short but deep horizontal lines are cut in the child’s\r\nforehead; these are irritated to produce swelling; later on they are cut\r\nagain, and again, and again, until the full development is produced. We\r\nshould certainly find such an operation painful in the extreme. I have\r\nseen women whose entire bodies were masses of raised patterns, produced\r\nby cutting and irritating.\r\n\r\nWhen being operated upon the subject usually squats or lies in front of\r\nthe operator, who sits cross-legged on the ground. The head or other\r\nportion of the body which is being cut rests upon the lap or knees of\r\nthe cutter. No particular pain is shown by the subject, though the cuts\r\nare often deep and blood flows copiously. A few minutes after the\r\noperation, smeared with fresh oil on the wounds, the scarred person\r\nwalks about as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nThe first subject that I saw treated for rheumatism was a young woman.\r\nShe was standing before her house door, while the old woman who was\r\ntreating her was squatted on the ground before her. In her hand the old\r\nwoman had a sharp, native razor, and with it she cut lines several\r\ninches long and to good depth in the fleshy part of the leg of her\r\nstanding patient. Not once nor twice, but a dozen times the old woman\r\ncut, and rubbed in medicine in the open wounds. The patient gave but\r\nlittle signs of pain. Once or twice she winced as the knife went a\r\nlittle deeper than usual; she held a long staff in her hand, and in the\r\nmost serious moments of the cutting she clutched it a little the\r\ntighter. But there were no groans, no cries, nor tears. I have never\r\nseen a white person who could have stood the operation with so little\r\nevidence of suffering.\r\n\r\nPart of the time that we were in Ndombe’s district we had charge of an\r\nestablishment employing 140 natives, more or less. Among these natives\r\nwas one Casati. I think he was a Zappo Zap. Originally a man of\r\nquickness and intelligence, he had become a complete physical wreck\r\nthrough drink and other forms of dissipation. He boarded with a girl\r\nnamed Tumba. One afternoon they presented themselves before me with a\r\npalaver. It was some question in regard to payment and service. Like\r\nmost Bantu difficulties, its beginning seemed to extend backwards to the\r\nworld’s creation.\r\n\r\nI knew Tumba to be a worthy and industrious girl; Casati was a miserable\r\nand worthless wretch. I therefore refused to decide the difficulty,\r\nstating that the parties interested must wait until the return of the\r\ntrue owner of the establishment, who would decide their question. This\r\nwas not at all to the satisfaction of Casati, who, merely to show his\r\ndissatisfaction, took a sharp knife and cut three big gashes in his own\r\nshoulder. It seems plain to me, from this apparent lack of pain under\r\nscarring, medical treatment, and self-infliction, that there is a\r\nnotable difference between the Bantu and ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAKUMU AT EASE: STEAMER CHAIRS AND PIPES FOR THREE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 22, 1907.\r\n\r\nNATURALLY, in the Congo there is little need of dress. Before the\r\nwhite man’s influence most native men wore nothing but a breech-clout—a\r\nlong strip of cloth passed between the legs and fastened as a belt\r\naround the waist—or else a piece of native cloth made from palm fiber,\r\nperhaps a yard in width and long enough to go around the body. This\r\nlatter garment, technically called a cloth, is still the dress of almost\r\nall the workmen and workwomen on white men’s places, but European stuff\r\nhas replaced the old palm cloth.\r\n\r\nThe women were usually much less clad than the men, but the style of\r\ndress varied from tribe to tribe. The Bangala woman wore, and still\r\nwears, a girdle at the waist, from which hung a fringe of grass or\r\nvegetable fiber reaching to the knees. The women of some Aruwimi tribes\r\nwear a simple cord, from which hangs in front a bit of grass cloth no\r\nmore than three or four inches square. On occasion, the Bakuba woman\r\nwears nothing but one string of beads around her waist, from which hang\r\nin front several large brass or copper rings. The Ngombe women regularly\r\ngo naked.\r\n\r\nWhere white influence has become pronounced every one wears white man’s\r\ncloth, and many have this cloth made up in form similar to those of the\r\nEuropeans. After a Bantu has begun to be imbued with white man’s ideas\r\nhe is unhappy until he has a jacket, trousers, and hat. In form and\r\nmaterial these are frequently so startling as to cause surprise to the\r\nperson really accustomed to white men’s clothes. Thus, a man may be\r\ndressed in loose and flowing trousers made of the most brilliant\r\ncalicoes in gaudy pattern. He may have a jacket made of a strip of\r\nhandkerchiefing which never was meant to be used as material for\r\nclothes, but to be cut or torn into kerchiefs.\r\n\r\nBut happiness is not complete for the Bantu in transformation until he\r\nhas a white man’s umbrella. Not that he needs it for rain, because when\r\nit rains the Bantu always goes into his house and at once falls into a\r\nprofound slumber which lasts until the rain is over. It is merely\r\nfashion, or for protection against the sun, a thing of which the Bantu\r\nreally has no need. Two boys who were in our employ at Ndombe\r\naccompanied us afterwards as personal servants on our long journey up\r\nand down the Congo. When the time came to leave them at Leopoldville we\r\ntook them to the white man’s store and asked them what they wanted as a\r\nparting gift. Their selections were eminently characteristic. My\r\ncompanion’s boy at once declared his wish for an umbrella, while my own,\r\nof a far livelier and more sportive disposition, wished an accordion.\r\n\r\nIt is a common complaint among the white men that the native is\r\nungrateful. Many and many a time have we listened to such tirades. You\r\nwill hear them from everybody who has had dealings with the Bantu. The\r\nmissionary complains of it as bitterly as does the trader or the state\r\nofficial. All of them unite in declaring that gratitude does not exist\r\nin native character. This seems to us a baseless claim. The African is\r\nthe shrewdest of traders. It is true that frequently he lets things go\r\nto white men for what seems to us a mere nothing. But he gets what he\r\nwants in return for his goods. He enjoys bickering. His first price is\r\nalways greatly in excess of what he actually expects to receive. He will\r\nspend hours in debating the value of his wares.\r\n\r\nNo one need seriously fear for the outcome to the black man in open\r\ntrade with whites. The purpose of the white man in visiting him and\r\ndealing with him is a mystery to the native mind. He can understand the\r\nvalue of palm oil and ivory, for palm oil and ivory he uses himself. Why\r\nrubber and copal should be so precious is beyond his understanding. He\r\nbut dimly grasps the purpose of the state and of the missionary. On the\r\nwhole, he lends himself to all alike, and being naturally kind, tries to\r\nplease all and do what is expected of him. Still, he knows that he is\r\nbeing exploited by the foreigner, and it is but fair that he should\r\nexploit in return—a thing at which he is an adept. Why, then, should he\r\nbe grateful for what is done for him? He naturally believes that\r\nmissionaries, government officials, and traders all gain some advantage\r\nfrom their dealings with him; it is his duty to gain all he can in\r\nreturn in his dealings with them. And there is no especial ground for\r\nthanks. There is no reason for gratitude.\r\n\r\nI presume it is true that on one occasion—perhaps it has been true on\r\nmany—a native who had been carefully and lovingly cared for through a\r\nlong and trying sickness, when restored wished to know what the\r\nmissionary was going to give him. He had taken all the bad medicines and\r\nall the invalid’s slops without complaint, but naturally he expected\r\nsome sort of compensation at the end. Yet the missionary would quote the\r\nincident as an example of ingratitude.\r\n\r\nIt is common to call black Africans dishonest. Here, again, the judgment\r\nis undeserved and arises from miscomprehension. The African knows, as\r\nwell as we do, what constitutes truth, yet he lies, especially to white\r\nfolk. He has as clear a knowledge of mine and thine as we, and yet he\r\nsteals from his employer. The explanation lies in the same idea\r\nprecisely. He thinks we are constantly getting something from him; he in\r\nturn must exploit us. The white man is a stranger. Throughout tribal\r\nlife the stranger is a menace; he is a being to be plundered because he\r\nis a being who plunders.\r\n\r\nAmong themselves, lying is not commended and truth is appreciated; but\r\nto deceive a stranger or a white man is commendable. Native houses are\r\noften left for days or weeks, and it would be easy for any one to enter\r\nand rob them. Yet robbery among themselves is not common. To steal,\r\nhowever, from a white employer—upon whom the native looks as a being of\r\nunlimited and incomprehensible wealth—is no sin. It is unfair to stamp\r\nthe native either as a liar or a thief because he lies to white men and\r\nsteals from his employer.\r\n\r\nAmong the Congo natives wealth has weight. The rich man has authority\r\nand power and influence because he is rich. There is a servile,\r\ncringing, element in the Bantu character which showed itself as plainly\r\nin the old days before the white men came as it does to-day. Cringing,\r\ntoadying, scheming, marked the daily life. While a man was rich he had\r\nrespect and friends and power. If reverses came he lost them all. None\r\nwas so poor to do him reverence. Arrogance was the chief element of the\r\nchieftain’s stock in trade; servility the chief mark of the slave and\r\npoor man. White men who have to do with natives are forced to act\r\ndecisively. They must inspire fear and respect; kindness is weakness. To\r\npermit discourtesy or insolence invites contempt. Perfect justice,\r\nfirmness, and consistency will give the white men who must deal with\r\nnatives a respected position which vacillation or mistaken friendliness\r\nwill never gain.\r\n\r\nEmotional to a high degree, the native often passes for affectionate.\r\nAffection of a certain kind he no doubt has; many examples come to the\r\nmind of personal servants who have almost shown devotion to white\r\nmasters. On the whole, true affection as we know it, unvarying,\r\nconsistent, which stands the test of varying circumstances, occurs but\r\nseldom. Extremely beautiful and touching, however, is the love which\r\nevery Bantu has for his mother—a love undoubtedly encouraged and\r\nstrengthened by the polygamous life. A boy’s relation to his father is\r\nnothing; his relation to his mother is the closest tie in human life. He\r\nis of her blood. Her relatives are his. The nearest male connection\r\nwhich he has is her brother. Toward him the boy shows particular\r\nrespect, but toward his mother true love. She is far nearer and dearer\r\nto him than wife or slaves. Through his boyhood she is his refuge in\r\nevery kind of trouble; in young manhood she is his adviser and\r\nconfidant; in manhood he still goes to her in every trouble and with\r\nevery question. There is but one person in his whole lifetime whom he\r\ntrusts. She is ever sure to be his friend; she never betrays his\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nAll early white visitors to dark African populations were profoundly\r\nimpressed with the respect shown to the aged. This was genuine. The old\r\nman or woman was the repository of wisdom. The experiences through which\r\nthey had passed made them wise counselors. Tribal affairs were decided\r\nby the old. This trait of native character, constantly mentioned by all\r\nthe early writers, tends to disappear in all those districts where the\r\nwhite man’s influence has spread. Such is ever the case. And it is\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\nThe white man’s wisdom is a different thing from that of the native.\r\nContact with the white man causes contempt and despisal of the wisdom of\r\nthe ancients. It is the children who always gain this new wisdom from\r\nthe whites, and with their eating of the tree of knowledge there comes a\r\nloss of all respect for older people. Missionaries in vain will preach\r\nthe fifth commandment to the children in their schools. The reading,\r\nwriting, and arithmetic which they learn from books, the new ways and\r\nmanners and points of view which they gain from contact with their\r\nteachers, render all such teaching mere platitudes without vital force.\r\nThe children educated by white men, must always lose respect and\r\nadmiration for their parents and the elders of their tribes.\r\n\r\nMentally, the native of the Congo is quick and bright. We have already\r\nspoken of his ability in languages and his facility in oratory. He\r\ndelights in saws and proverbs—condensed wisdom. Hundreds and thousands\r\nof such proverbs, often showing great keenness and shrewdness, deep\r\nobservation and insight, might be quoted. No people with a mass of\r\nproverbial philosophy, such as the Bantu and the true negroes have,\r\ncould be considered stupid. In learning new ways and customs and in\r\nimitation of others they are extremely quick and apt. Every white\r\nsettlement in the Congo has introduced new ways of living, and the black\r\nboys who can cook well, do fair tailoring, good laundry work, and\r\npersonal service of other kinds are surprisingly numerous. Under\r\ndirection they frequently develop great excellence in work.\r\n\r\nIn a few years after the establishment of the Free State, the caravan\r\nservice for transporting freight of every kind from the head of\r\nnavigation at Matadi to Leopoldville, above the rapids, was admirably\r\ndeveloped. The men carried their burdens willingly and uncomplainingly;\r\nit was extremely rare that anything was lost or stolen. So, too, they\r\nhave rapidly adopted military life, and the native soldiers under\r\nBelgian training present as great precision, promptness, and grace in\r\nexecuting their maneuvers as many white troops would do.\r\n\r\nWith both the true negroes and the Bantu, belief in witchcraft was\r\nprevalent. Sickness, disease, and death were not natural events. That a\r\nman should die in battle or from wounds was understood, but that\r\nsickness should cause death was not grasped by the native mind. Sickness\r\nand death from sickness were regularly attributed to the evil practices\r\nof witches. If a man suffered pains in the head or body, it was because\r\nsome enemy was introducing a mysterious and harmful object into his\r\nsystem. It was necessary, therefore, to adopt some method of undoing the\r\nharm. There were men and women whose business it was to detect the\r\nauthor of witchcraft and to recommend means for saving the victim from\r\nhis operations. Nothing more serious could happen to a man than to be\r\naccused of witchcraft. No matter how rich he was; how high his station;\r\nhow many or how strong his friends—the accusation of witchcraft was\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nA person accused of witchcraft was usually subjected to an ordeal of\r\npoison. It was generally the drinking of a poisoned brew produced by\r\nsteeping leaves, or barks, or roots in water. If the accused vomited the\r\ndrink and suffered no serious results, his innocence was demonstrated.\r\nIf, however, the draft proved fatal, his guilt was clear. It is true\r\nthat sometimes the witch doctor played false, and, in administering the\r\nordeal, might be influenced by bribes.\r\n\r\nThis whole matter of witchcraft and the ordeal has been magnified by\r\nmany writers. It is true that there was constant danger for a\r\nprogressive man, a rich man, or a great chief. Such men would naturally\r\narouse jealousy and envy, and no doubt accusations were frequently made\r\nagainst them without cause. For my own part, however, I have long\r\nbelieved that the ordeal for witchcraft was not an unmixed evil, and I\r\nwas more than pleased at hearing a missionary, who has been many years\r\nin the Congo, state that, after all, while it was subject to occasional\r\nabuse, it tended toward wholesome control of conditions in a community.\r\n\r\nIt is much the custom for white men to speak of Congo natives as big\r\nchildren. Whenever some custom is particularly unlike our own, they will\r\nshrug their shoulders and say: “You see, they are only children.” I\r\nbelieve as much in the theory of recapitulation as any one. I believe\r\nthat the life history of the individual repeats the life history of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nI believe that one may truly say that children among ourselves represent\r\nthe stage of savagery; that youth is barbarous; that adult age is\r\ncivilization. It is true that children among ourselves present many\r\ninteresting survivals of the savage attitude. In a certain sense savages\r\nare children. I think, however, from the points in native character\r\nwhich I here have touched, that my readers will agree with me that the\r\nadult native of the Congo is no child. He is a man, but a man different\r\nfrom ourselves. He represents the end of a development, not the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 23, 1907.\r\n\r\nHAVING some of the more marked characteristics of the Bantu in mind,\r\nlet us consider the conditions and circumstances of the white men in the\r\nCongo. There are, of course, but three classes—state officials,\r\ntraders, and missionaries. Practically, the state officials and the\r\ntraders are in the same condition; the missionary is so differently\r\ncircumstanced that he must be considered independently.\r\n\r\nFew persons can imagine the trying climate and the serious diseases of\r\nthe Congo region. It is claimed that Nigeria is worse. It may be, but,\r\nif so, I should wish to keep away from Nigeria. Fever, of course,\r\nabounds in all the Lower Congo districts. If one escapes it for a time\r\nit is so much the worse for him when finally he succumbs to the\r\ninfliction. It is only malaria, but it is malaria of the most insidious\r\nand weakening sort. A man is up and working in the early morning; at\r\nnoonday he takes to his bed with fever; at night or next morning he may\r\nagain be at his daily work.\r\n\r\nIt seems a trifling thing—a disease which often lasts less than a day.\r\nBut the man is left weak and nerveless. The next attack continues the\r\nweakening process. Finally, with blood impoverished and strength\r\nexhausted, he dies. Of course, the remedy is quinine. Careful people\r\ngoing into the Congo begin to take their daily dose of this specific at\r\nthe beginning of their journey, so that they may be fortified against\r\nattack before arrival. For the most part the English missionaries take\r\ntwo, three, five, or six grains daily throughout the period of their\r\nstay. Some foreigners prefer ten grain doses on the 1st, 11th, and 21st\r\nof every month. Few really refuse to take it, and such usually find an\r\nearly grave.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage of this constant dosing with quinine is the danger of\r\nthe dreaded hæmaturic fever. This dread disease rarely attacks a person\r\nuntil he has been a year in the Congo. It is commonly attributed to the\r\nsystem being loaded up with quinine. The instant that its symptoms\r\ndevelop, the order to cease taking quinine is promptly issued. Among the\r\nEuropean population of the Congo, hæmaturic fever is regularly expected\r\nto have a fatal issue. It is more than probable that the use of wines,\r\nbeers, and liquors predisposes the system to a fatal result. Plenty of\r\nmissionaries die of hæmaturic fever also, but the appearance of the\r\ndisease among them by no means produces the panic which it does among\r\ncontinentals. Perhaps one in five or six cases dies, two of the\r\nremainder flee to Europe, the other three recover. But the disease is no\r\ntrifling matter, and must be seriously taken.\r\n\r\nFew persons realize the frightful effect of the tropical sun in Central\r\nAfrica. When Jameson came down the river from the ill-fated Yambuya\r\ncamp, natives on the shore sent a flight of arrows against his paddlers,\r\nnot knowing that a white man was present with them in the canoe. To show\r\nthem that such was the case and prevent further attack Jameson stood in\r\nhis canoe and waved his hat at the assailants. It is unlikely that he\r\nhad it from his head more than a minute or two, but in that time he was\r\nstricken with the fever which a few days later caused his death.\r\n\r\nGlave, after spending six years in Africa at the state post of Lukolela,\r\nreturned in safety to his native land. After some years he revisited the\r\nscene of his earlier labors, entering the continent on the east coast\r\nand passing in safety to Matadi. While waiting for a steamer he was\r\nmaking a short journey on the river in a canoe. His head was exposed for\r\na mere instant to the sun, and Glave was shortly a dead man.\r\n\r\nOne who has been on three different occasions in the Congo once remarked\r\nto me that he could see no reason for the strange and frightful modes of\r\nsuicide adopted by Europeans who wished to end their lives. All that\r\nwould be necessary is to seat oneself upon a chair or stool in the open\r\nsunshine for a brief period. Yet the Bantu goes out every day with no\r\nhat upon his head, and with no apparent bad results. And when he has the\r\nfever one of his quickest means of restoration is to seat himself in the\r\nopen sunshine. Of course, the Bantu does not have the fever as\r\nfrequently or as severely as the white man.\r\n\r\nThe Bantu suffers much, however, from sleeping-sickness. For a long time\r\nit was believed that this strange disease was peculiar to the dark\r\npopulations of Africa. The disease formerly was local, and while\r\nfrightful in its ravages, was not a serious matter. To-day, however, it\r\nis extending up and down the whole length of the main river and\r\nthroughout the area drained by many of its main tributaries.\r\n\r\nIn its approach it is slow and insidious. The saddest cases are those\r\nwhere the victim attacked was notably intelligent and quick. The subject\r\nbecomes at first a little moody, and from time to time has outbursts of\r\npetulance and anger out of proportion to the exciting cause. These\r\noutbursts become more and more common, and assume the character of true\r\nmania, during which the person may attack those around him, even though\r\nthey are his best and dearest friends. It is frequently necessary to tie\r\nhim, in order to prevent injury to others. Presently the person is\r\naffected with stupor, shows a tendency to sleep, even at his work; this\r\nincreases until at last he is practically sleeping, or in a comatose\r\ncondition, all the time. In this latter stage of the disease he loses\r\nflesh with great rapidity, and presently is naught but skin and bones.\r\nAt last death takes him, after he has been useless to himself and others\r\nfor a long time.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping-sickness is not confined to the Congo Free State, and at\r\nthe present time its ravages are felt severely in the British district\r\nof Uganda. The disease has been investigated by learned commissions, but\r\nno satisfactory treatment, at least for an advanced stage of the\r\ntrouble, has been yet discovered.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency among physicians to connect the transmission of the\r\nsleeping-sickness with, the tsetse fly. It is, “of course,” a germ\r\ndisease—such being at the present all the fashion. A medical friend in\r\nNew York tells me that the Japanese have made recent important\r\ninvestigations of the sickness, and that their line of treatment gives\r\ngreater promise of success than any other. Latterly the disease has\r\nattacked white people, and a number of missionaries have died from it or\r\nbeen furloughed home for treatment.\r\n\r\nWhole districts of Bantu have been depopulated. We were shown the site\r\nof a Catholic mission until lately highly prosperous; the place has been\r\ndeserted, all the natives under the influence of the mission having died\r\nof the sleeping-sickness.\r\n\r\nMalaria, hæmaturia, sun fevers, and sleeping-sickness are the most\r\nfearful scourges which the white settler in the Congo faces.\r\n\r\nWe could, of course, extend the list of strange and dreadful diseases,\r\nbut have said enough to show that every white man who goes into the\r\nCongo country does so at a serious risk. No one is quite immune, and the\r\nnumber who even seem to be so is small. No one is ever quite well, and\r\nevery one is chronically in a state of physical disorganization.\r\n\r\nThe climate and the actual diseases are bad enough. They perhaps would\r\nlose a portion of their terror if the food supply were adequate,\r\nwholesome, and nutritious. Even the missionaries use little native food.\r\nThe state officer and trader use practically none. The chopbox is an\r\ninstitution of the country. Its simplest expression is found at the\r\ntrading-post of some company where but a single agent is in residence.\r\nOnce in three months the steamer of his company brings him his chopbox\r\noutfit. There are usually two long wooden boxes, one of which contains a\r\ngreat variety of tinned meats, fish, vegetables, and fruit. I never had\r\nthe least idea until my African experience how many things were put in\r\ntins. The second box contains flour, oil, vinegar, salt, and spices. The\r\nquantity is held to be sufficient for the three months. In addition to\r\nthe actual food supply, there is a quota of wine in demijohns and of gin\r\nin square bottles.\r\n\r\nNo one who has not had the experience can imagine the frightful satiety\r\nwhich comes upon one who has fed for weeks from chopboxes.\r\n\r\nIt is true that “the boy” does his best to serve a palatable dinner. It\r\nis true that sometimes a piece of elephant or hippopotamus, a guinea\r\nfowl or grouse, some buffalo or antelope, or fresh fish or fowls are\r\nbrought in by the natives as gifts or trade. But even with this help the\r\npoor company agent has the same food, meal after meal, day after day.\r\nFrequently the tinned stuff is old and really unfit for eating; but the\r\nquota is none too large for his three months’ period. Sometimes the\r\nflour or macaroni is moldy, having been soaked through with water in the\r\nhold of a leaky steamer. The food is not attractive nor substantial. The\r\nstate officer, the company agent, in Central Africa, is underfed and\r\nbadly nourished.\r\n\r\nNot only does the white man in the Congo suffer physical\r\ndisorganization; he also suffers mental disintegration. The memory of\r\nwhite men in the Congo weakens. This is a matter of universal\r\nobservation, and my attention has been called to it repeatedly. A\r\ndisinclination to any kind of intellectual activity takes possession of\r\none, and only by the exercise of strong will-power can he accomplish his\r\ndaily tasks and plan for the work of the future. There is a total lack\r\nof stimulus.\r\n\r\nWhen to the weakening effects of fever and other illness, and to the\r\ndepression caused by innutritious food, we add the influence of constant\r\ndread of coming sickness and of native outbreaks, it is no wonder that\r\nthe white man of the Congo is a nervous and mental wreck. At home,\r\naccustomed to wines and spirits at his meals, he finds it difficult to\r\ndiscontinue their use. Beer ought to be completely avoided in the Congo;\r\nthere is no question of its injurious effect upon the liver. Wine may be\r\ntaken in the evening, and a very little spirits in the night after\r\ndinner, without noticeable bad results. But many of these lonely men pay\r\nno attention to wise rules of drinking, and through constant dissipation\r\nlay themselves open to disease and death. Nor are they always satisfied\r\nwith intoxicating drinks. The use of opium in different forms is common.\r\nMany a time have company agents or state officials come to me and asked\r\nfor some remedy from my medicine chest, for sudden and distressing\r\npains. In every case it has been a preparation of opium which they have\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 24, 1907.\r\n\r\nWITH physical and mental disorganization there must, of course, be\r\nmoral disintegration. Even the missionaries in an enlightened country\r\nlike Japan constantly complain of the depressing influences around them.\r\n\r\nSuch a complaint, to my mind, is preposterous when applied to Japan, but\r\nit is easy to understand with reference to Central Africa. If there is\r\nbut one agent at the station, he rarely sees another white man. Day\r\nafter day, and all day long, his constant contact is with the black\r\nfolk. There is nothing to appeal to his better nature. He must pit\r\nhimself against the scheming and servile native. He must look out for\r\nthe interests of the company. He must scheme, browbeat, threaten.\r\nChances for immorality abound.\r\n\r\nConstant sight of cruelty begets cruelty. Alone in a population so\r\nunlike himself, his only safety rests in his commanding at once fear,\r\nrespect, obedience. He frequently possesses governmental power. The only\r\nwhite man in a large area of country, he must insist upon the\r\nfulfillment of the requirements which are passed down to him from his\r\nsuperiors. There are no white men living who could pass unscathed\r\nthrough such a trial.\r\n\r\nThe wonder is not that from time to time company agents and governmental\r\nofficials are encountered who are monsters of cruelty. The wonder is,\r\nwith the constant sapping of the physical, the mental, and the moral\r\nnature, that any decent men are left to treat with natives.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are almost no white women in the Congo Free State\r\noutside the missions. The director-general at Leopoldville, the railroad\r\nstation agent at the same point, a commandant at Coquilhatville, and two\r\nof the officers at Stanleyville have their wives with them. It is\r\npossible that there are some of whom I am ignorant, but it is doubtful\r\nif there are a dozen white women of respectability in all the\r\nCongo—except, of course, the ladies in the missions. Almost without\r\nexception, the other state officials and traders have black women.\r\n\r\nThese black women of the white man are to be seen wherever the white man\r\nhimself is seen. A man usually selects his black companion shortly after\r\nreaching the Congo and supports her in his own house, where he treats\r\nher on the whole with kindness. He considers her an inferior being, but\r\ntreats her like a doll or toy. She is dressed according to her own fancy\r\nand frequently brilliantly and more or less expensively. She rarely\r\nforces attention upon herself, but where he goes she goes. If he travels\r\non the steamer, she is there; if he makes a trip through the rubber\r\ndistrict, stopping night after night in native towns, she is ever one of\r\nthe caravan. She is true to him and on the whole, though there has been\r\nno marriage, he is true to her.\r\n\r\nFrequently, a strong affection appears to spring up between the couple,\r\nand the hybrid children resulting from the relation are almost always\r\nloved and petted by their white father. Not infrequently, the little\r\nones are taken home to Belgium for education, and are generally received\r\nwith kindness by their father’s parents.\r\n\r\nOn the steamer which brought us back from Congo were two Belgians, one\r\nwith a little girl, the other with a boy slightly older. The children\r\nwere well dressed, well behaved, pretty and attractive. And it was\r\ninteresting to see the affectionate greeting that was given them by\r\ntheir grandparents on their landing at the dock in Antwerp.\r\n\r\nAt one post, where we were entertained for several days, the lieutenant\r\nhad his two little daughters, 3 and 5 years respectively, at the table\r\nwith him at all meal times, together with the other two white men of the\r\nstation and his two guests. The little ones were extremely pretty and\r\ngentle. At the table it is their custom to sing between the courses.\r\nTheir father almost worships them. While the children are thus\r\nconstantly petted in public and appear on all sorts of occasions, the\r\nblack woman rarely if ever sits with her white man at the table or\r\nenters the room where he is laboring or receiving guests.\r\n\r\nWe have described the condition of a single agent at a station. At many\r\nstations there is more than one. At first sight, it would seem as if the\r\nlot of the agent who with one or two others is at a station would be far\r\nhappier than that of the lonely man whom we have pictured.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two results of the environment to which we have as\r\nyet not alluded. On my return to Brussels, after my visit to the Congo,\r\na state official who has never been in Africa asked me with interest and\r\nsome evidence of concern whether in my judgment it was true that those\r\nin Africa were always a little crazy. I told him that I believed such to\r\nbe the case, and quoted to him a statement made by an old Afrikander:\r\n“We are all a little crazy here; it is the sun. You must not mind it.”\r\nMen on the slightest provocation will fly into the most dreadful fits of\r\nanger. A little cause may bring about catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe second curious result suggested is the fact that everything appears\r\nmuch larger, more important, and more serious than it really is. A\r\nslight, neglect, or insult of the most trifling character becomes an\r\nenormous injury. With this unsettled intellectual condition and this\r\nconstant tendency to magnify and enlarge an injury, we almost always\r\nfind where two men or more are associated in Congo stations frightful\r\nhostilities and enmity. One would think that the common feeling of\r\nloneliness would unite men and cement friendships. On the other hand,\r\nevery subordinate is plotting against his superior. Cabals are formed;\r\ninjuries planned and developed.\r\n\r\nOf course, we understand that criticism, plotting, undermining occur\r\nwherever human beings live. But the thing develops to an extreme among\r\nthe white men of the Congo. When a man has an outside visitor ready to\r\nlisten to his complaints he will spend hours in pouring out his woes.\r\nThe most innocent actions and words on the part of his fellows will be\r\nwarped and misconstrued; imaginary insults and neglects will be\r\nmagnified, brooded over, and reiterated.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to think that the men who go to the Congo are bad.\r\nMissionaries assert that the quality of those who come to-day is worse\r\nthan formerly, which may be true. When the Congo enterprise was first\r\nlaunched, sons of good families, lured by the chance of adventure or\r\npining for novelty, enlisted in the service of the state. Probably the\r\nnumber of such men going to the Congo is lessening.\r\n\r\nTo-day, when all the terrors of the Congo are well known, when the\r\nhardships of that kind of life have been repeated in the hearing of\r\nevery one, rich men’s sons find little that is attractive in the Congo\r\nproposition. But I was constantly surprised at the relatively high grade\r\nof people in low positions in the Congo state. Most of them are men of\r\nfair intelligence; some, of education. Not only Belgians, but\r\nScandinavians, Hollanders, Swiss, and Italians, go to the Congo in\r\nnumbers. They are not by nature brutal or bad; doubtless they were poor,\r\nand it was poverty that led them to enter the Congo service. The term\r\nfor which they regularly enter is three years. No man from any country,\r\ncould stand three years of such surrounding influence without showing\r\nthe effect.\r\n\r\nIn passing, we may call attention to certain curious facts of\r\nobservation in connection with the strangers who come to Congo. We might\r\nsuppose that the Scandinavians would particularly suffer physically in\r\ngoing from their northern latitudes into the tropics. On the contrary,\r\nit is precisely the Scandinavians who seem most readily to adapt\r\nthemselves to their surroundings. Almost all the captains of steamers on\r\nthe Congo River are Norwegians or Swedes.\r\n\r\nA record astonishing and presumably unparalleled is presented by the\r\nFinns. On one occasion, I was sitting in a mess-room where it proved\r\nthat each member of the company spoke a different language—French,\r\nFlemish, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Dutch, German, and English were all\r\nrepresented. On my expressing interest in there being a Finn present,\r\nthe gentleman of that nationality stated that he and fifty-four of his\r\ncompanions came to the Congo State six years ago; that they were now\r\nending their second term, and that fifty-one out of the original number\r\nwere still living. I presume the statement was true, and, if so, it is\r\nas I have stated, unparalleled. Another member of the company told me\r\nlater that the case was far more interesting and striking than I\r\nrealized, as three out of the four who died were drowned, not meeting\r\ntheir death from disease.\r\n\r\nThere is a tendency for the population of a nationality to flock into\r\nthe same line of work in the Congo State. Thus, a large proportion of\r\nthe Finns in question were engineers upon the steamers. The Italians are\r\nlargely doctors, and one meets with Italian physicians in every quarter\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that those who go to the Congo insist that in\r\nNigeria the climatic conditions are still worse for health. If they are\r\nno worse, but just as bad, we should find the same disintegration in\r\nphysical, mental, and moral ways. It is easy to criticise the lonely\r\nwhite man in Central Africa; to stamp him as brutal, cruel, and wicked.\r\nBut the Englishman occupying a similar position in Nigeria, or even in\r\nUganda, must present the same dreadful results of his surroundings. I\r\nsuspect that our American young men, isolated in remote parts of the\r\nPhilippines, show the same kind of decay. Any nation that insists upon\r\nbearing the black man’s burden must pay the price.\r\n\r\nBelgium is the most densely populated land in Europe. It, if any\r\nEuropean country, needs room for expansion. Leopold II. claims that his\r\ninterest in the Congo from the first has been due to a desire to provide\r\nan opportunity for Belgian overflow. I am loath to attribute to that\r\nmonarch so much sagacity. It is, however, true that as a colony of\r\nBelgium, the Congo Free State will ever receive a large number of young\r\nmen who hope, by serving a term in Congo, to better their condition.\r\nThey realize the dangers and deprivations, but they expect at the end of\r\ntheir three years to come home with a neat sum of money in their\r\npossession; with this they think to establish themselves in business for\r\nlife. Unfortunately, these bright hopes are rarely realized. They start\r\nfor home in Europe with the neat little sum of money. For three years,\r\nhowever, they have had no social pleasure, have spent no money.\r\n\r\nArrived in the home land, old friends must be entertained. The theater,\r\nthe saloon, the dance-hall present attractions. Before he knows it, the\r\nman has spent his little hoard in foolish pleasures, and has naught to\r\nshow for his three years of labor. He hates to return to Congo, but the\r\nfact that he has been in Congo stands in the way of his securing steady\r\nand normal employment in Belgium. At last, without money and without\r\nwork, after a bitter struggle, he decides that there is nothing left but\r\nanother term in Congo. If he was a state employé, he decides that he\r\nwill better himself by entering into the service of a company; or, if he\r\nwere in the employ of a company, he thinks another company or the state\r\nwill better appreciate and pay for his services. It is a fatal\r\nassumption. The moment that he presents himself before his would-be\r\nemployers and speaks proudly of his experience in Congo as a reason for\r\nhis hiring, suspicion is at once aroused that he must have left his\r\nearlier employment under a cloud. He is told to call again, and\r\ninquiries are set on foot with his old employer, who, irritated at his\r\nemployé’s desertion, gives as unfavorable report as the case will\r\nwarrant. On returning at the appointed date, the applicant is either\r\ntold that his services are not wanted, or is offered wages below what he\r\nbefore received. Angered at this lack of appreciation, he goes back to\r\nhis old employer and offers his services at the old price. This is\r\nrefused. And the discouraged seeker for work is compelled frequently to\r\naccept, in spite of an experience which would make him more valuable,\r\nlower wages than he was accustomed to.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 25, 1907.\r\n\r\nUNDOUBTEDLY the finest houses in the Congo are those at missions. The\r\ngrade of living in these mission stations is also of the best. This has\r\nled to strange criticism by many travelers. One of the latest to visit\r\nthe Congo State speaks with surprise, and apparently disapproval, of the\r\nEnglish missionaries “living like lords.”\r\n\r\nYet it is certain that the missionaries, if any one, should live well.\r\nThe state official and the company’s agent go to the Congo with the\r\nexpectation of staying but a single term. The English missionary goes\r\nthere with the purpose, more or less definitely fixed, of spending the\r\nremainder of his life in his field of labor. No matter how well he is\r\nhoused or how good his food, he must meet with plenty of inconvenience\r\nand privation. If he is to accomplish anything for those who send him,\r\nhe should be as comfortable as the circumstances will allow. More than\r\nthat, the English missionary regularly takes with him his wife, and any\r\nwhite woman is entitled to the best that can be had; it is a poor return\r\nfor what she must necessarily undergo.\r\n\r\nThere was, of course, mission work in the kingdom of Congo more than 400\r\nyears ago. It had an interesting history, it had its periods of\r\nbrilliant promise, and apparent great achievement. The work was spent,\r\nits effect had almost disappeared, when recent explorations reintroduced\r\nthe Congo to the world. Stanley’s expedition aroused the interest of the\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries were prompt to see the importance of the new field open\r\nfor their labors. In 1878 three important events in mission history took\r\nplace. In February of that year Henry Craven of the Livingstone Inland\r\nMission reached Banana; in the same month, the Catholic church decreed\r\nthe establishment of the Catholic mission of Central Africa, with what\r\nis practically the Congo State as its field of operations. In the same\r\nyear Bentley, Comber, Crudington, and Hartland, representatives of the\r\nBaptist Missionary Society, made a settlement at San Salvador, a little\r\nsouth of the Congo River, which became the center from which extended\r\nthe most widely developed and influential mission work of all the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSince that time the representatives of many other missions have\r\nundertaken work within the Congo State—which, of course, in 1878 had\r\nnot yet been established. Some of these flourished for but a brief time;\r\nothers have continued. At present there are within the Congo limits\r\nmissionaries of at least eight different Protestant\r\nsocieties—representing England, America, and Sweden—and Catholic\r\nmissionaries representing five different organizations.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest number of the Protestant missionaries are English,\r\neven though they may in some cases be representatives of American\r\nboards. They naturally carry with them into their stations the English\r\nmode of life, traditions, atmosphere. Though the currency of the Congo\r\nFree State is reckoned in francs and centimes, they talk all business\r\nand quote all prices in shillings and pence; in making out an account\r\neverything is calculated in English money, and it is with a certain air\r\nof gentle remonstrance that they will convert the total, at the request\r\nof the debtor, into Belgian or Congo currency. Their importations all\r\nare English; they take their afternoon tea; they look with mild but sure\r\nsuperiority upon all differing methods around them. Few of them really\r\ntalk French, the official language of the country; still fewer write it\r\nwith any ease or correctness.\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if one of the first requirements of a society sending\r\nmissionaries into a country where the official language is French and\r\nwhere the vast majority of the officials, with whom the missionary must\r\ndeal and come into relation, know no English, would be that every\r\ncandidate for mission work should be a competent French scholar.\r\nOtherwise there is danger of constant misunderstanding and difficulty\r\nbetween the mission and the government. No such requirement seems to be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is a strained relation amounting at times to\r\nbitterness between the state officials and the English-speaking\r\nmissionaries. This feeling is general, and there are curiously many\r\nspecific exceptions. Thus, there are certain missionaries who, by their\r\nimmediate neighbors among officials, are highly spoken of; for example,\r\nthe manner, the ingenuity in devising and planning work, the promptness\r\nand energy, of Mr. Joseph Clark at Ikoko, are constant themes of\r\nadmiring conversation on the part of officers at the Irebu camp, and\r\nMrs. Clark’s dress, linguistic ability, and cookery are quoted as models\r\nto be attained if possible.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought these officials were poking fun, but soon became\r\nconvinced that they were speaking in serious earnest, and that it was\r\nnot done for effect upon myself was evident from the minute details into\r\nwhich the praisers entered. I found an almost precisely similar\r\ncondition of things at Lisala camp, near the mission of Upoto, where Mr.\r\nForfeitt’s wisdom and knowledge of the natives and Mrs. Forfeitt’s grace\r\nand charm were frequently referred to. At Stanleyville, also, one heard\r\nconstant praises of Mr. Millman’s scholarship and Mr. Smith’s skill in\r\nphotography.\r\n\r\nIn all three of these stations, the officials would talk dreadfully of\r\nBritish missionaries in general, but for the local missionary they\r\nseemed to feel an actual regard. To a less degree, and tinged, of\r\ncourse, with English condescension, there was frequently expressed a\r\nfeeling of reciprocal regard from the missionary’s side. While the\r\nrepresentative of the state on the whole was a frightful creature,\r\nmerely to be condemned, there were usually some local officers, known\r\npersonally to the missionary, who presented streaks of excellence.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that a well-built house, and as good meals as can be\r\nprepared within the Congo, operate to keep the missionary in better\r\nhealth of mind and body and morals, yet even he feels the disintegration\r\ndue to the environment. He lives a fairly normal life. The presence of a\r\nwife and woman of culture and refinement in the household is a great\r\nblessing. Children, of course, are sent home for education and to escape\r\ndisease. The result is there are no little ones in the mission homes,\r\nbut, apart from this serious lack, the influence is helpful and\r\nhealthful.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries, probably all of them, are abstainers. There is no\r\nquestion that their refraining from wines and liquors is a physical and\r\nmental advantage. In the nature of the case, they are constantly\r\nsubjected to moral restraints, which are lacking to the state official\r\nand the company agent. For all these reasons the missionary stands the\r\ncountry much better than any other group of white men.\r\n\r\nA white missionary is rarely if ever the sole representative at a\r\nstation. With a definite continued work, in its nature inspiring, with\r\ncongenial companions, and the encouragement of others working in the\r\nsame cause, his lot is often a happy one. But even the missionary has\r\nfever, dies of hæmaturia, or must hasten back to England with incipient\r\nsleeping-sickness; he, too, becomes anæmic and nerveless; he becomes\r\nirritable and impatient; the slightest provocation upsets him, and he\r\nmagnifies every little grievance, as do his white neighbors in other\r\nlines of work.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the missionary is the only white man in the country who\r\nseriously learns the language of the natives among whom he works. He\r\ndevotes himself with eagerness to its acquisition. A newcomer in the\r\ncountry, his first desire is to gain sufficient knowledge of the\r\nlanguage to teach and preach to the people in their own tongue. Many of\r\nthese missionaries have written extended grammars and dictionaries of\r\nnative languages, and the number of translations of portions of the\r\nBible and of religious teachings into these languages is large.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the mere stranger is sometimes doubtful as to the\r\nreality and thoroughness of the missionary’s knowledge of his people’s\r\nlanguage. He hears the missionary give a distinct order to the native,\r\nand, behold, the boy does the precise opposite. This has happened too\r\noften for one to be mistaken. The missionary shrugs his shoulders and\r\nsays in explanation that the blacks are stupid or cuffs the boy for\r\ninattention. The fact probably is that the missionary gave a different\r\norder from what he thought. The black is really shrewd and quick to\r\ngrasp the idea which the white man is trying to convey to him.\r\n\r\nWhether it is true that the white man often gains sufficient control of\r\nthe language to make himself completely understood by the natives or\r\nnot, it is absolutely certain that much of the reading of translations\r\ninto his own language by the native is pure fiction. At one mission\r\nwhich we visited, it was the custom after breakfast for the houseboys of\r\nthe mission to come in to family prayers. Each was supplied with a\r\ntranslation to be read in the morning’s exercise. The boys, seated on\r\nthe floor, read brief passages in turn. They might, through mistake,\r\nskip a whole line or completely mispronounce a word, indicating a total\r\nlack of understanding of the passage read, and yet it was done with the\r\nsame air of satisfaction that would accompany a task well done. My own\r\nboy, Manoeli, used to cover whole sheets of paper with meaningless\r\nscrawls in pencil, and with an air of wisdom, which he unquestionably\r\nthought deceived me, he would at my request proceed to read line after\r\nline, and even page after page, of stuff that had no meaning. And even\r\nif I stopped him and turned him back to some earlier point, he would\r\nbegin and go on as if it really meant something. I was constantly\r\nreminded by these boys at prayers of Manoeli’s pretended reading of fake\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nOn the Kasai River steamer many of the Baluba boys and girls had books\r\nfrom the Luebo mission. These were mostly elementary reading books.\r\nNothing pleased them better, especially if any one seemed to be paying\r\nattention to what they were doing, than for a group of them to gather\r\nabout one who played the teacher. With an open book before him and a\r\ncluster of six or eight about him, looking carefully at the syllables to\r\nwhich he pointed, they would call out in unison the sounds represented.\r\nIt was done with gusto, with rhythm, almost with dancing. It seemed to\r\nshow remarkable quickness in recognizing the printed syllables.\r\n\r\nAfter I had seen the thing three or four times I myself took the book in\r\nhand and centering the attention of the group upon one syllable to which\r\nI pointed, I would start them by pronouncing a syllable several lines\r\nbelow; once started, though distinctly looking at the thing to which I\r\npointed, they would call out the complete list, one after another, in\r\nproper order, but never the ones, of course, to which my finger pointed\r\nand which they pretended to be reading. In other words, these Baluba\r\nboys and girls knew their primer by heart and repeated it like parrots,\r\nwith no reference to the actual text. I must confess that I have little\r\nconfidence in the ability of most Congo mission boys and girls to read\r\nunderstandingly the simplest of the books with which they deal.\r\n\r\nThere are different types of Protestant missions. At Leopoldville there\r\nwould probably be no mission but for the fact that it is the terminus of\r\nthe railroad and the place from which the river steamers start. The\r\nnatives directly reached by its work live for the most part on the\r\nmission property, in quarters much like those upon the old plantations\r\nof the South. They receive their rations weekly and are paid a monthly\r\nwage. Early in the morning the rising bell is sounded and morning\r\nprayers take place. Work begins and all are kept busily employed upon\r\nthe grounds and buildings. Noon hours of rest are given, and at evening\r\nwork for the day stops. There are various religious services and classes\r\nmeeting after supper on different evenings of the week. The presence of\r\ngreat numbers of workmen and soldiers of the state at Leopoldville\r\nintroduces conditions not helpful to mission labor. It is necessary,\r\nhowever, to have a force at hand able to help missionaries going up or\r\ncoming down the river, transporting their baggage and freight, and doing\r\nother service constantly called for at a point of receipt and shipping\r\nlike Leopoldville.\r\n\r\nThe mission’s work is not confined, however, to the town, and teachers\r\nare sent to neighboring villages to teach and conduct classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 26, 1907.\r\n\r\nAT Yakusu great stress is laid upon the work of teaching. The mission\r\nproperty adjoins an important Lokele village. Within easy reach are\r\nvillages of three or four other tribes. It is an area of rather dense\r\npopulation. Villages in number occur all along the shores of the river\r\nfor miles downstream. Other villages of inland folk lie behind these.\r\nThousands of people are within easy reach. The mission maintains a\r\nliberal force of houseboys for the four houses of missionaries; it has\r\nalso a corps of excellent workmen, who make brick, do carpentering,\r\nbuild houses, and keep the grounds in order. These are not from the\r\nlocal tribe, but are Basoko from down the river. Children from the\r\nimmediate village flock to the mission school, but this is only the\r\nleast significant portion of the work. More than 200 teachers are in the\r\nemploy of the mission, teaching in village schools throughout the\r\ncountry around. To supply text-books, the mission press at Bolobo turns\r\nout editions of four or five thousand copies.\r\n\r\nSimilar in its plan of sending out native teachers to outlying villages\r\nis the great work at Wathen, in the Lower Congo. This was once on the\r\nmain caravan route from Matadi to Leopoldville. Since the building of\r\nthe railroad it is completely off of beaten lines of travel, and only\r\none who specifically desires to visit it will see it. The main feature\r\nof this work, marking it off from all the other mission work in the\r\nCongo State, is a central boarding school for native children, where a\r\ndefinite course for study, extending through several years, is\r\ncontinuously carried on. Boys graduating from this school go out as\r\nteachers. And the mission demands that the villages thus supplied shall\r\nmeet the expense of conducting their schools. This seems to me the best\r\neducational experiment in the Congo, and scores of villages throughout\r\nthe district of the cataracts have self-supporting schools with Wathen\r\nboys for teachers.\r\n\r\nIn the official report of the royal commission of inquiry sent to\r\ninvestigate conditions in the Congo Free State recently, there is found\r\nthis passage:\r\n\r\n    “Often, also, in the regions where evangelical stations are\r\n    established, the native, instead of going to the magistrate, his\r\n    rightful protector, adopts the habit, when he thinks he has a\r\n    grievance against an agent or an executive officer, to confide\r\n    in the missionary. The latter listens to him, helps him\r\n    according to his means, and makes himself the echo of all the\r\n    complaints of a region. Hence, the astounding influence which\r\n    the missionaries possess in some parts of the territory. It\r\n    exercises itself not only among the natives within the purview\r\n    of their religious propaganda, but over all the villages whose\r\n    troubles they have listened to. The missionary becomes, for the\r\n    native of the region, the only representative of equity and\r\n    justice. He adds to the position resulting from his religious\r\n    zeal the influence which in the interest of the state itself\r\n    should be secured to the magistrate.”—_Translation._\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Congo native carries all his grievances to the\r\nmissionary. On one occasion, when we had been in Leopoldville but a day\r\nor two and had seen but little of native life and customs, we noticed a\r\nline of fifty people, some with staves of office showing them to be\r\nchiefs or chiefs’ representatives, filing in a long line to the mission.\r\nThey squatted under the palaver-tree, awaiting the attention of the\r\nmissionary. Their errand was in reference to the local market. Formerly\r\nthere was a market at Leo, important alike to the people of the town and\r\nto the producing natives of the country around. There had been disorders\r\nand disturbances; the sellers lost their goods through theft and\r\nseizure, and for several years it had been discontinued.\r\n\r\nAfter repeated petitions on the part of the people to the government,\r\nBula Matadi yielded, promised restoration of the market, assigned a\r\nplace, and put up a building. Though apparently all had been done that\r\nthey had asked, the people were not satisfied, and this delegation had\r\npresented itself to the missionary to ask him to present their complaint\r\nand desires. The place selected was not a good one; a different one\r\nclose by the railroad station and the English traders, was requested.\r\nThe missionary brought the matter to the attention of the local\r\ngovernment, which yielded to the people’s suggestion, and gave\r\npermission for the opening of the market on the following Sunday in the\r\nplace of preference.\r\n\r\nWe became interested in this matter, and on the following Sunday the\r\nmissionary, my companion, and myself made our way to the spot to see how\r\nmatters were progressing. A considerable number of sellers had come in\r\nwith produce, mostly kwanga and other foodstuffs. They were beginning to\r\ndisplay these upon the ground. Would-be purchasers were gathered in\r\nnumbers, and among them crowds of Bangala women from the workmen’s camp.\r\nThe sellers seemed suspicious lest attack might be made upon their\r\nwares. Their suspicions were, unfortunately, well founded. For a little\r\ntime things appeared to go well but at last Bangala women, standing by,\r\nswooped down upon the piles of stuff temptingly offered for sale, and\r\nseizing handfuls, started to run away. One soldier-policeman, who, a few\r\nmoments before, seemed to be fully occupied with his duty of guarding\r\nthe railway station, and several idle men and boys joined in the\r\nlooting. The thing was done as quickly as if there had been\r\npre-concerted plotting and a given signal.\r\n\r\nIn an instant all was turmoil. Some of the sellers were hastily packing\r\naway in cloths what was left of their stores; others grappled with the\r\nthieves, some of whom, however, were making good escape with their\r\nplunder. We all three rushed in to help the robbed to stay the thieves,\r\nand for a few minutes there was a free-for-all fight. Most of the stolen\r\nstuff was retaken, and the angry sellers, with all that was left to them\r\npacked away, refused to again open up their stores. The missionary\r\nsuggested that they should move nearer to the trading-post of the\r\nEnglish traders and ensconce themselves behind a fence, buyers being\r\nallowed to approach only upon the other side, while we three and the\r\nwhite men from the traders should guard to prevent further attack and\r\nthieving. Finally, this scheme was put into operation. One or two\r\nsoldier-police were summoned, the stores were again opened up, though\r\ntrading had to stop every now and then to permit of the dispersal of the\r\ncrowd which thronged around awaiting the opportunity for another attack.\r\n\r\nUnder these difficulties, in which the missionary and my Mexican\r\ncompanion performed prodigies of valor, the market was conducted with a\r\nfair degree of success. I was interested in the further history of this\r\nmarket. Our missionary friend shortly wrote me that things had been\r\nreduced to order; that the government had built a market-house and\r\nsupplied regular guards to maintain order; that the number of sellers\r\nhad increased, and that purchasers flocked to buy.\r\n\r\nBut all this brilliant promise came to a sad end. When we again reached\r\nLeopoldville the market-house was closed; there were no signs of\r\ninterest. It seems that Bula Matadi thought the market presented an\r\nadmirable chance for getting even. One day, when the stock of kwanga and\r\nother foodstuffs was exceptionally large, the representatives of the law\r\nswooped down upon the sellers, claimed that they were in arrears in\r\npayment of their kwanga tax, and seized their stock in trade. The result\r\nwas that the market died.\r\n\r\nAmong the laws which in their intention, perhaps, were good, but in\r\ntheir application vicious, is one regarding orphan and abandoned\r\nchildren. In native life, unaffected by white influence, there could be\r\nno difficulty regarding such children. If a native child were left\r\nwithout a mother it would at once be taken over by the mother’s family.\r\nThere would be no feeling that it was a burden, and it would suffer no\r\ndeprivation.\r\n\r\nSuch a thing as an abandoned child, in strictly native condition, is\r\nscarcely conceivable. According to state law, an orphan or abandoned\r\nchild less than 14 years of age may be turned over by the court to\r\nmissions for care and education. The mission, of course, is entitled to\r\nthe child’s services through a term of years. Advantage of this law has\r\nnever been taken by Protestant missions, but Catholic missions have at\r\ndifferent times had numbers of children committed to their charge and\r\nhave used their services in the development of property. A child of 14,\r\nthe limit of the law’s application, is better than a child of 12,\r\nbecause capable of immediate service. A boy of 15, 16, 17, 18, would be\r\nstill better, but, of course, it is illegal to seize a young fellow of\r\nthat age and employ him at such labor. Once committed, the child remains\r\nin the mission’s power until manhood.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that the missions, taking advantage of this law,\r\nmany times seize boys who are beyond the age limit and many others who\r\nare neither orphans nor abandoned. I myself have seen a young man who\r\ncould not have been less than 19 or 20 years of age, who was married and\r\na member of the Protestant church, who had been taken by the peres under\r\nthis law. He was brought before the state authorities and immediately\r\nset at liberty.\r\n\r\nIt is due to this fact, that the native goes constantly to the\r\nmissionary with his complaints—that he looks upon him as the proper\r\nperson to represent his cause before the state officials; that the\r\nmissionary, himself, feels it his duty to bring abuses to the attention\r\nof the authorities—that the feeling already mentioned between the\r\nmissionary and the state official has arisen. There have been,\r\nunfortunately, abundant occasions for intervention; there have been\r\nflagrant and cruel things which the missionary has felt called upon to\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt the honesty of the missionary. I have sometimes felt,\r\nhowever, that they have become so filled with a complaining spirit that\r\nthey are incapable of seeing any good. I have heard them for hours\r\ncomplain of things that neither in themselves nor in their results were\r\nreally open to criticism. I have heard them carp and find fault with any\r\nmatter with which the name of the government could be connected. If\r\ntheir attention is called to some apparent purpose to reform abuses,\r\nthey shake their heads and say it will come to nothing; it is a\r\nsubterfuge. If, as time passes, the thing assumes the appearance of\r\nreality, they say there is some hidden and mysterious purpose back of\r\nit; the state would never do so well unless it were preparing some new\r\niniquity. The attitude of complaint becomes habitual: the ability to see\r\nimprovement seems completely lost.\r\n\r\nThe first time that I attended family prayers in a missionary home I\r\nwaited with some interest to hear the petition in favor of the\r\ngovernment. When it came, it assumed this form: “O Lord, stay the hand\r\nof the oppressor. Pity and aid the oppressed and overburdened. Prevent\r\ncruelty from destroying its victims. Interfere with the wicked and\r\ndesigning schemes of the oppressor.”\r\n\r\nA dozen such expressions and petitions were uttered, but no request for\r\ndivine wisdom and enlightenment for the rulers. It can easily be\r\nconceived that, where godly and pious men cherish such sentiments toward\r\nrepresentatives of the state, the feelings of state officials toward\r\nmissionaries are little likely to be completely friendly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BACHOKO BRINGING IN RUBBER, DJOKO PUNDA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 27, 1907.\r\n\r\nTHE actors in the Congo drama are now clearly before us—the black man\r\nand the white man, the state official, the trader, and the missionary.\r\n\r\nTravel in the Congo state is, naturally, for the most part by water. The\r\nmighty river is the main member in a water system surpassed only by that\r\nof the Amazon. The Congo itself presents a total length of almost 3,000\r\nmiles, of which more than 2,000 is navigable. The vast network of\r\ntributary streams, with a total length of almost 17,000 miles, gives\r\nnearly 5,000 miles more of navigation connected with that of the main\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nTo-day these thousands of miles of navigation are utilized by a fleet of\r\nsteamers eighty or more in number. Most of these are vessels of the\r\nstate; a smaller number belong to the great concession companies; a few\r\nare the property of the missions. Many of them are small, but some of\r\nthe more recent steamers constructed for the state are vessels of 400\r\ntons burden. They are flat-bottomed steamers of small draft, because the\r\nrivers through which they ply are often shoaled by sand banks. Even the\r\nmighty Congo itself, at certain seasons of the year, becomes dangerous\r\nand almost impassable, even for vessels of this light draft. By means of\r\nthese boats it is easy now for travelers not only to go over the chief\r\npart of the main river but to enter the larger tributaries at their\r\nmouth and travel for hundreds of miles up towards their sources.\r\n\r\nIt can be well imagined with what surprise the natives saw the first\r\nsteamer. The pioneer vessels were brought in pieces to the head of\r\nnavigation for sea steamers, and then transported by human carriers the\r\nweary distance from Vivi, near Matadi, around the cataracts to Stanley\r\nPool, where the parts were assembled and the vessels prepared for\r\nservice. Some of the earliest steamers are still in service, and, while\r\nthey have been eclipsed in size and power and speed by later vessels,\r\nhave a true historic interest. No vessel on the Congo deserves more or\r\nhas a better record than the Peace. This was the earliest of the mission\r\nsteamers, presented to the B. M. S. by Robert Arthington of Leeds,\r\nEngland. It was throughout its history in charge of George Grenfell, the\r\nintrepid missionary explorer, whose death took place during our stay in\r\nthe Congo.\r\n\r\nWe saw the little vessel at Yakusu, and looked at it with especial\r\ninterest. In it George Grenfell explored many thousand miles of unknown\r\nwaterway. With it he made the study which enabled him to construct the\r\nbest navigation maps and charts so far published of the Congo—charts\r\nwhich the state still uses on its own steamers.\r\n\r\nThe state steamers are, of course, primarily for the service of the\r\nstate. So far as the main river is concerned, a steamer is started from\r\nLeopoldville for the trip to Stanley Falls every ten days, taking from\r\ntwenty-four to thirty days to make the journey. The down trip requires\r\nless time, and can be made under favorable circumstances in fourteen\r\ndays—the usual time being seventeen or more. By these steamers state\r\nofficials are taken to their posts, workmen and soldiers are transported\r\nto their place of service, chopboxes and other supplies are taken to the\r\nstate employés, materials for construction are taken to the place where\r\nneeded, products, such as rubber, ivory, and copal, are brought to\r\nLeopoldville for shipment. Generally they are well loaded with both\r\npassengers and cargo.\r\n\r\nThe company boats do for the company what state boats do for the\r\nstate—transporting from place to place, bringing in supplies, taking\r\nout products. Similarly the mission steamers are intended solely for the\r\nmovement of the missionaries and their supplies. The state boats may\r\ncarry freight and passengers, but only when they are not loaded fully\r\nwith the materials of the state. Arrangements must be made by strangers,\r\nand it is only when the state is favorable that they may travel or ship\r\ngoods. The company boats are not allowed to carry outside passengers or\r\nfreight without the express permission of the state, but are obliged to\r\ncarry state people and freight in cases of especial need. If a mission\r\nsteamer carries outside passengers or freight, it can do it only\r\ngratuitously.\r\n\r\nIn the steamers of the state the traveler who has permission to embark\r\nupon them pays for a ticket, which entitles him merely to\r\ntransportation; he is expected to pay five francs a night additional for\r\nhis cabin; for food he pays twelve francs per day during the period of\r\nthe voyage. The steamers of every class tie up at evening, and no\r\ntraveling is done at night. In steamers of the larger class there may be\r\nas many as four white employés—the captain, his assistant, a\r\ncommissaire, or steward, and the engineer. In smaller steamers there are\r\nonly the captain and the engineer. All the crew and employés in the\r\ncabins, mess, and deck are blacks. In steamers with an upper deck, the\r\nblacks are expected to stay below; only when called for special service\r\nare they allowed on deck.\r\n\r\nNo black man remains on board during the night. Even the personal\r\nservants, or boys, of the white passengers must go with the crew and\r\nother workmen on to shore to spend the night. As promptly as the ship is\r\nfastened, the black men, women, and children, with cooking utensils,\r\nfood supplies, bedding, and beds, hasten off on to shore to pick out the\r\nspot on the bank, or in the forest, where they will spend the night. It\r\nis an animated and curious scene. As darkness comes on, the fires for\r\ncooking their evening food have been kindled here and there over the\r\nterrace or in the forest, and the groups gathered around them while the\r\ncooking proceeds, or eating takes place, are picturesque in the extreme.\r\nAt daybreak the steamer whistles the signal for all on board, and the\r\nwhole mob come rushing—for no time is lost, and it is easy to be left\r\nbehind in the forest—pellmell on board.\r\n\r\nThe fuel for the steamers is wood, cut from the forest. One of the most\r\nserious problems which the state has had to face is the securing of\r\nsufficient and continuous fuel supply. Wood-posts have been established\r\nwherever possible; the natives at the wood-posts are required to supply,\r\nin form of tax, for which a small compensation is, however, returned, a\r\ncertain number of yards or fathoms of wood. A space is marked out on the\r\nground as many yards in length as there are cutters of wood. Stakes are\r\nplaced at intervals of a yard and ropes are stretched from one to\r\nanother at a yard’s height. Each bringer of wood is expected to fill the\r\nspace indicated for him to supply. Much time is lost, even under the\r\nbest circumstances, in taking wood at these wood-posts. Whenever\r\npossible, the night’s landing is made at a wood-post, and as large a\r\nsupply of fuel as possible is brought on board during the night.\r\nSometimes it happens that several steamers reach a wood-post in quick\r\nsuccession before a new supply has been procured; under such\r\ncircumstances the crew frequently must cut wood for itself in the\r\nforest, a task which they greatly dislike.\r\n\r\nIn each crew is a capita or head man, whose business it is to oversee\r\nthe work and to assign the portions of the task. He is held responsible\r\nfor the service of his subordinates, and usually is more successful in\r\nsecuring prompt, efficient service than a white man would be. He is\r\nhimself, of course, frequently watched and directed by a white officer,\r\nbut on the whole he is the one man on the vessel who comes into direct\r\ncontact with the black laborers.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely interesting to watch the black hands on a steamer when\r\nfor any reason landing is made at villages. Many of them have bought a\r\nstock in trade at Leopoldville. Beads, pieces of bright cloth, salt,\r\naccordions, made-up clothes, hats, umbrellas—these are the things they\r\nare most likely to have brought with them. A crowd of women and children\r\nalways flocks to the landing, and quickly the bartering begins. If the\r\nsteamer-boy has had experience, he makes money both coming and going.\r\nAll the product of his sales en route between Leo and Stanley Falls he\r\nat once invests in rice when he reaches the district in which it is so\r\nlargely produced. This forms his capital upon his return to\r\nLeopoldville, where it brings a price largely in excess of what it cost\r\nhim and enables him to stock up again for new business on his next\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nOur first long voyage on these river steamers was the journey from\r\nLeopoldville to Wissmann Falls, on the High Kasai. We were in a steamer\r\nof the Kasai company, and we had hard luck in wood-posts, frequently\r\narriving when earlier steamers had taken all the fuel. We were forced\r\nrepeatedly to tie up for the night close by the forest and to drive our\r\nforce of cutters into the dense, almost impenetrable, mass of trees,\r\nbound together by hundreds and thousands of creeping plants and vines.\r\nThe natives not only do not enjoy the cutting of the wood; but they do\r\nnot like to be turned out into the dense forest for sleeping.\r\nParticularly after a heavy rain, conditions are disagreeable for\r\nsleeping. Many a time it seemed hard to force them to pass the night in\r\nsuch conditions, on the wet ground, under the dripping foliage, in\r\nhaunts of mosquitos and other insects.\r\n\r\nWhile we were in the Kasai country the governor-general made his journey\r\nof inspection throughout the upper Congo. When we reached that district\r\nin our later journey we found that he had ordered a most excellent\r\nreform, which had been carried out. The steamers were put under orders\r\nto stop at wood-posts or at villages every night, tying up against the\r\nforest only on those rare occasions, when it was unavoidable. The order\r\nalso provided for the immediate erection at all wood-posts and villages\r\nof a great hangar for the shelter of the black people. A hangar is a\r\nsubstantial roof, supported on posts, for giving shelter at night or in\r\nrainy weather. These hangars for the shelter of the black people from\r\nthe steamers are enormous things, capable of sheltering 150 to 200\r\npeople and giving ample opportunity for the building, by each little\r\ngroup, of its own fire for cooking and for warmth. While the natural\r\ntravel in the Congo Free State is by boat upon the river, there is, of\r\ncourse, land travel as well.\r\n\r\nThere are almost no beasts of burden in the country. Horses seem to lose\r\nall force and vigor; oxen suffer in many districts from the tsetse fly.\r\nThe State has made several interesting experiments in its effort to\r\nsecure some animal of burden. Indian elephants have been brought into\r\nthe country, partly with the view of using them as carriers and partly\r\nin the hope that they might be used in the domestication of the African\r\nelephant. At present, of course, the latter animal has the reputation of\r\nbeing untamable, though for several hundred years in history we know\r\nthat it was tamed and used on a large scale for draft and war. The\r\nexperiments so far made toward its recent domestication have not met\r\nwith much result. Camels have been introduced as an experiment, and in\r\nLeopoldville one sees a little cluster of them under an imported Arab\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\nIn the district where the zebra is at home, efforts are being made now\r\nto tame that animal and use it for practical purposes. But\r\nnotwithstanding all these interesting experiments, some of which\r\nultimately may be successful, it must be stated that at present there is\r\nabsolutely no beast of burden in the Congo. The result is that land\r\ntravel must be done by caravan. The outfit of the traveler, his trade\r\nstuffs, and whatever else he may have for transportation, must be\r\ncarried on human backs.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few experimental roads built with reference to\r\nthe introduction of automobiles for moving freight, there is nothing\r\nwhich we would call a road in all the Congo. The native, on the march,\r\nalways go in single file. The trails leading from village to village are\r\nonly a few inches wide, though they are usually well worn, sometimes to\r\na depth of several inches into the soil. Most of them are in use so\r\nconstantly that there is little or no grass growing in them. For my own\r\npart, when they are dry I could ask no better path for travel, and my\r\nideal of African travel is the foot journey over the native trails.\r\n\r\nMany white men do not like to walk, and must have their hammock. It is a\r\nsimple hammock, usually made of a strip of foreign stuff swung by ropes\r\nto a long bamboo or palm pole. Unless the person to be carried is\r\nextraordinarily heavy, there will be two or four carriers. When four men\r\nare carrying a hammock, two in front and two behind shoulder the pole at\r\nits two ends. Usually the carriers swing along at a sort of dog trot.\r\nFrequently they strike their palms against the carrying pole to make a\r\nnoise, and indulge in an explosive snort in taking breath. They may sing\r\nor shout or cry when carrying, and if they approach a settlement, either\r\nnative or foreign, their pace quickens, their exertion increases, they\r\ncry and yell with great force, increasing their noise and outcry with\r\nthe importance of the person carried. When they rush up to the place\r\nwhere he is expected to dismount, the whole party bursts into a loud\r\nyell, which would appall the bravest if he never had heard it before, as\r\nthey stop suddenly.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I can imagine nothing more disagreeable than traveling\r\nin a hammock. The four men rarely are on the same level, and the jolting\r\nand movement up and down, now of one’s head and upper body, now of one’s\r\nfeet tilted high in air, are extremely disagreeable; from one’s position\r\nhe must look up constantly into the sky and see nothing of the country\r\nthrough which he travels; if the sun shines, his face must be shaded,\r\nand if one wears, as he usually must do, his cork helmet, it is\r\ndifficult to adjust it in any way other than putting it over the face.\r\nPersonally, I invariably have a half-day of fever after a hammock\r\njourney. I would rather walk thirty miles every day than to go twenty in\r\na hammock.\r\n\r\nThere are still opportunities in the Congo for making fine journeys on\r\nfoot. From Stanley Falls to the English steamer on the Lake is a foot\r\njourney of forty days over a good road. If I had had the time, I should\r\nhave made that journey.\r\n\r\nThere are at present two operating railroads in the Congo Free State,\r\nbesides a little line of a few miles running from Boma into the country\r\nback. The more important of these two roads is the Congo Railroad,\r\nrunning from Matadi to Leopoldville. Before its building it took freight\r\nthree weeks to go by caravan around the cataracts. The engineering\r\ndifficulties of this line were all in its early course within a few\r\nmiles of Matadi. Several years were spent in the construction of the\r\nroad, which has a total length of about 250 miles. It is a narrow-gauge\r\nroad, well-built, and fairly equipped. After a train once starts it is\r\nentirely in the hands of black men as no white conductor or engineer is\r\nemployed in its running.\r\n\r\nTwo classes of cars are run, one for whites, first-class, the other for\r\nblacks. The fare for first-class passage from Matadi to Leopoldville at\r\nthe time we made the journey was 200 francs, or $40; the second-class,\r\njimcrow-car fare, was 40 francs, or $8. The journey requires two days\r\nfor its accomplishment. Starting from Matadi at 7 in the morning, the\r\ntrain reaches Thysville at 5 or 6 in the evening, and stays there for\r\nthe night. Starting at 7 the next morning, it is expected to reach\r\nLeopoldville at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, but usually is from half an\r\nhour to two hours behind time. The road, during the period of its\r\nconstruction, was often considered a wild speculation, but it has paid\r\nremarkably well, and its stock sells at an advance of many hundreds per\r\ncent upon face value.\r\n\r\nThe second serious obstacle to Congo navigation—the Stanley Falls—is\r\ngot around in a similar way by a railroad line just finished. This line\r\nof railroad from Stanleyville to Ponthierville, is about 75 miles in\r\nlength. It has just been finished and at the time of our visit, while it\r\nwas transporting passengers on account of the state, was not open to\r\ngeneral travel. We had the pleasure, however, of going the full length\r\nof the line, a journey which required some eight hours. The whole course\r\nof the railroad is included in dense forest, and nothing is to be seen\r\nin all the journey except the forest. There is no question that this\r\nlittle piece of tracking will have great business importance. Hundreds\r\nof miles of navigable water lie above Ponthierville, and steamers—both\r\nstate and railroad—are already plying upon it. A country of great\r\nresources is by it brought into near relations with that portion of the\r\nCongo already developed. This piece of road forms but a small part of\r\nthe line planned, which is known by the name of the Great Lakes\r\nrailroad. Construction is in progress upon another section of it.\r\n\r\nWhile we made our journey from Stanleyville to Ponthierville by rail, we\r\nmade the return journey by canoe, in order to see the rapids. Of course,\r\nthe construction of the railroad had already affected this old route and\r\nmode of travel. Until lately all passengers and freight going up the\r\nCongo beyond Stanleyville were forced to make the journey by canoe.\r\n\r\nIt is the district of the Congo where the canoe reaches its fullest\r\ndevelopment and most striking expression. There are canoes cut from a\r\nsingle tree-trunk which will carry tons of freight and scores of men.\r\nSome of the great native chiefs had canoes of state in which they were\r\npaddled from place to place by a hundred or more paddlers. While the one\r\nin which we made our journey was by no means so pretentious, it was\r\ncertainly large enough for all practical purposes. An awning, or rather\r\na thatched roofing, extended over the middle third of its length to\r\nprotect us and our things from the sun. An officer of the state, an\r\nItalian, accompanied us through half our journey to see that we met with\r\nprompt and proper treatment. And two native soldiers were deputed to\r\naccompany us the total distance and to take the canoe in charge when we\r\nfinally reached the landing at Stanley Falls. It was a most interesting\r\nexperience, for nothing that I had read had prepared me for so well\r\ndeveloped a system.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the rapids we and our stuff were landed. The signal had\r\nbeen given as we approached the beach, and by the time that we were\r\nready to take the trail around the rapids the women of the native\r\nvillage had presented themselves with carrying straps, ready to move our\r\nfreight. In ten minutes time everything was ready and the caravan upon\r\nits way, twenty or thirty women carrying our boxes, satchels,\r\nprovisions, and collections. Meantime, our paddlers were occupied in\r\npassing the canoe down through the rapids, and by the time we reached\r\nthe lower beach they were there ready for re-embarkation. We took five\r\ndays for our journey, though it might have been done in half that time\r\nor even less.\r\n\r\nAt each village where we landed we found arrangements for the traveler.\r\nA neat house of two or three rooms, constructed by the state, was at our\r\ndisposition. It was supplied with table, chairs, and beds. Near the\r\nhouse for white travelers was a comfortable hangar for blacks, and near\r\nit a large hangar for the storage of freight and baggage. The paddlers\r\nwho started with us at Ponthierville were dismissed after a day of\r\nservice and a new set of paddlers taken on, furnished by the village\r\nchief. These, after a few hours of service, were again at liberty, and a\r\nnew crew supplied. Everything was done with promptitude and readiness.\r\nThe journey was one of the most interesting I ever made.\r\n\r\nYou understand, of course, that all this service, the carrying of\r\nfreight around the rapids by the women of the village and the supplying\r\nof male paddlers by the chief were taxes to the state, for which a\r\nnominal return in money or trade goods is allowed. At no point did we\r\nsee the slightest evidence of difficulty in furnishing the service or of\r\ndissatisfaction in supplying it. Everywhere the people seemed to take it\r\nas a pleasant thing. It is entirely possible that when the caravan\r\nservice was at its height and all freighting and traveling was done upon\r\nthe river, it may have been a heavier burden. But nowhere did the people\r\nseem to show fear, hostility, or the effects of bad treatment. If we had\r\nmade the long walking trip above referred to, from Stanleyville to the\r\nLake, we would have found analogous arrangements for the traveler’s\r\ncomfort. Good sleeping-houses, with necessary furniture, occur at\r\nintervals of four or five hours throughout the entire journey, and no\r\none need sleep out of doors a single night, unless he chooses to do so.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that one to-day may go easily throughout the enormous\r\narea of the Congo Free State without serious hardship and really with\r\nmuch comfort. But, as a matter of fact, there are almost no true\r\ntravelers in the area. One can hardly call a state official, on his way\r\nto his post, or going from place to place in the performance of his\r\nduty, a traveler. Nor is a company agent, making his tour for the\r\ncollection of rubber, or for inspection of property, exactly one’s ideal\r\nof a traveler. Nor is the missionary, coming back from furlough or going\r\nhome invalided, a traveler. The number of actual travelers in the Congo\r\nat any time is small. My photographer and myself, I think, might be\r\ncalled travelers.\r\n\r\nWe spent fifty-three weeks in the Congo Free State. During the period of\r\ntime that we were there we learned that Mr. A. Henry Savage-Landor spent\r\na few days in the High Ubangi. He came in from the north, visited only\r\none station of a company, and then went out again. Mr. Harrison, who,\r\nsome little time ago, took a group of pygmies from the High Ituri forest\r\nto London, was again in the country, though he had left his little\r\npeople behind him.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, an English gentleman was hunting the okapi (that\r\ncurious antelope) in the same district. When we were coming out and were\r\ndelayed at Leopoldville, a Capt. Daniels of the English navy arrived at\r\nLeopoldville, having made his way across the continent from the east\r\ncoast. At Bolengi we met a Mr. Creighton, an American clergyman, who had\r\nmade the way so far from Mombasa. Mr. Verner, bringing back his native\r\ngroup from the St. Louis exposition, was in the Congo during the same\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nOn the steamer coming down from Stanley Falls, we had for fellow\r\npassengers, M. and Mme. Cabra. M. Cabra was a royal commissioner, having\r\nbeen sent to the country by Leopold himself, to make a careful\r\nexamination of conditions throughout the whole upper region of the Ituri\r\nand Congo rivers. M. and Mme. Cabra entered Africa at Mombasa; they had\r\ntraversed on foot the forty days of journey I have referred to, but as\r\nthe purposes of their investigation required them to zigzag back and\r\nforth instead of following a direct path, they had occupied a much\r\nlonger period of time and covered much more distance. Eighteen months on\r\ntheir long journey, they both of them reached Matadi in good health, and\r\nMme. Cabra is probably the first lady to have crossed the African\r\ncontinent in the equatorial regions from ocean to ocean.\r\n\r\nNow, these were the only travelers besides one Frenchman, who was a\r\nmystery, of whom we heard or whom we met in our fifty-three weeks in\r\nCongo experience. It is unlikely that there were many others. The\r\nstranger in the Congo is talked of everywhere. We were not within\r\nhundreds of miles of Henry Savage-Landor, or Mr. Harrison, or the okapi\r\nhunter, but we heard of their existence. Even if the given list is but\r\nthe half of Congo travelers during the year, it can be seen that the\r\nreal traveler is a rarity within the limits of the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 28, 1907.\r\n\r\nIN the romantic history of African exploration and development there\r\nis no more interesting chapter than that relating to the Congo. In 1854\r\nLivingstone finished a great journey into the continent; in it he had\r\nvisited a portion of the district drained by the Kasai River. In his\r\nfinal journey we find him again within the district of what to-day forms\r\nthe Congo Free State; he discovered Lake Moero in 1867 and Lake Bangwelo\r\nin 1868; he visited the southern portion of Tanganika in 1869, and\r\nfollowed the course of the Congo to Nyangwe.\r\n\r\nAt that time no one knew, few if any suspected, that the river he was\r\nfollowing had connection with the Congo. Livingstone himself believed\r\nthat it formed the uppermost part of the Nile, and in all the district\r\nwhere he saw it, its course from south to north would naturally lead to\r\nthat opinion. It was his heart’s desire to trace the further course and\r\ndetermine whether it were really the Nile or a part of some other great\r\nriver. Death prevented his answering the question.\r\n\r\nBacked by the New York _Herald_ and the _Daily Telegraph_, Stanley, on\r\nNovember 17, 1874, struck inland from the eastern coast of Africa, with\r\nthe purpose of determining the question as to the final course of the\r\ngreat river flowing northward, discovered by his missionary predecessor.\r\nHe circumnavigated Lake Victoria, discovered Lake Albert Edward, and\r\nmade the first complete examination of the shore of Tanganika. He\r\nreached the Lualaba—Livingstone’s north-flowing stream,—and, embarking\r\non its waters, devoted himself to following it to its ending.\r\n\r\nThere is no need of recalling the interesting experiences and adventures\r\nof his journey; every one has read his narrative. Suffice it to say that\r\nhis great river presently turned westward so far north of the Congo\r\nmouth that one would never dream of connecting the two waters, but as\r\nunexpectedly it turned again toward the southwest and finally showed\r\nitself to be the Congo. During the interval between Stanley’s two great\r\nexpeditions—the one in which he found Livingstone and the one in which\r\nhe demonstrated the identity of the Lualaba and the Congo—there had\r\nbeen a growing interest in Europe in everything pertaining to the Dark\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nThis interest, which was widely spread, was focused into definite action\r\nby Leopold II., king of the Belgians, who invited the most notable\r\nexplorers of Africa, the presidents of the great geographical societies,\r\npoliticians, and philanthropists, who were interested in the progress\r\nand development of Africa, to a geographic conference to be held in\r\nBrussels. The gathering took place in September, 1876, at the king’s\r\npalace. Germany, Austria, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Italy, and\r\nRussia were represented. The thirty-seven members who made up the\r\nconference represented the best of European thought.\r\n\r\nFrom this conference there developed the International African\r\nAssociation. This Association organized a series of local national\r\nassociations, through which the different countries interested should\r\nconduct investigations and explorations in Africa upon a uniform plan,\r\nand with reference to the same ideas and purposes. It possessed, also, a\r\ngoverning international commission, of which the king of the Belgians\r\nwas the president, and upon which were representatives of Germany, and\r\nFrance, and the United States, Minister Sanford replacing a British\r\nrepresentative. This committee laid out a definite plan of exploration.\r\nIts first expedition was to go in from the east coast at Zanzibar,\r\npassing to Tanganika. The commission adopted as the flag of the\r\nInternational African Association a ground of blue upon which shone a\r\nsingle star of gold.\r\n\r\nThe Association’s plan included the discovery of the best routes into\r\nthe interior of Africa; the establishment of posts where investigators\r\nand explorers could not only make headquarters but from which they might\r\ndraw supplies needed for their journey. These advantages were to be\r\nextended to any traveler. The expeditions themselves were national in\r\ncharacter, being left to the initiative of the local national committees\r\nwhich had been developed by the Association. This Association existed\r\nfrom 1876 to 1884. During that time six Belgian, one German, and two\r\nFrench expeditions were organized, accomplishing results of importance.\r\n\r\nIt was in November, 1877, that the result of Stanley’s expedition came\r\nto the knowledge of the world. It wrought a revolution in the views\r\nregarding Central Africa. In Belgium it produced at once a radical\r\nchange of plan. The idea of entering the heart of Africa from Zanzibar\r\nwas abandoned. The future operations of the A. I. A.—at least, so far\r\nas Belgium was concerned—would extend themselves from the Congo mouth\r\nup through the vast river system which Stanley had made known. Details\r\nof this mode of procedure were so promptly developed that when Stanley\r\nreached Marseilles in January, 1878, he found an urgent invitation from\r\nthe king of the Belgians to come to Brussels for the discussion of plans\r\nof conference.\r\n\r\nAfter a full study of the matter, it was determined by the Belgian\r\ncommittee that a society should be organized with the title of the\r\nCommittee of Studies of the High Congo. This, it will be understood, was\r\npurely a Belgian enterprise. It had for its purpose the occupation and\r\nexploitation of the whole Congo district. For this purpose prompt action\r\nwas necessary. In February, 1879, Stanley went to Zanzibar and collected\r\na body of workmen and carriers. With this force of helpers and a number\r\nof white subordinates he entered the Congo with a little fleet of five\r\nsteamers, bearing the flag of the A. I. A. Arrived at Vivi, where he\r\nestablished a central station, he arranged for the transportation of his\r\nsteamers in sections by human carriers to the Stanley Pool above the\r\nrapids.\r\n\r\nHe worked with feverish haste. France was pressing her work of\r\nexploration, and there was danger of her seizing much of the coveted\r\nterritory. Portugal, too, was showing a renewed interest and activity,\r\nand might prove a dangerous rival in the new plans. Native chiefs were\r\nvisited and influenced to form treaties giving up their rights of\r\nrulership in their own territories to the Association. Lands were\r\nsecured for the erection of stations; the whole river was traversed from\r\nStanley Pool to Stanley Falls, for the purpose of making these treaties\r\nand securing the best points for locating the stations. The Committee of\r\nStudies of the High Congo now possessed at least treaty rights over a\r\nvast area of country, and by them governmental powers over vast\r\nmultitudes of people. It had these rights, it had a flag, but it was not\r\nyet a government, and it stood in constant danger of difficulties with\r\ngovernments. About this time it changed its name from the Committee of\r\nStudies of the High Congo to the International Association of the Congo.\r\n\r\nMeantime events were taking place which threatened the existence of the\r\nAssociation. Portugal began to assert claims and rights which had long\r\nbeen in abeyance. She proposed to organize the territory at the Congo\r\nmouth, and which, of course, was of the greatest importance to the\r\nAssociation, into a governmental district and assume its administration.\r\nIn this project she found willing assistance on the part of England.\r\n\r\nNever particularly enthusiastic over the scheme of Leopold II., England\r\nhad shown no interest at all during the later part of all these\r\nmovements. It is true that she was represented at the first conference\r\nheld at Brussels; it will be remembered that in the later organization\r\nan American had replaced the English representative. No work had been\r\ndone of any consequence by a British committee. No expedition had been\r\nsent out. By the treaty with Portugal, England would at one stroke\r\nrender the whole Congo practically worthless. The crisis had come.\r\nFrance and Germany came to King Leopold’s help. The former recognized\r\nthe political activity and status of the Association and promised to\r\nrespect its doings; Germany protested vigorously against the\r\nAnglo-Portuguese treaty, which fell through.\r\n\r\nBismarck, who favored the plans of the Belgian monarch in Africa,\r\nofficially recognized, on November 3, 1884, the Association as a\r\nsovereign power, and invited representatives of the powers to Berlin for\r\nthe purpose of establishing an international agreement upon the\r\nfollowing points: First, commercial freedom in the basin of the Congo\r\nand its tributaries; second, application to the Congo and the Niger of\r\nthe principle of freedom of navigation; third, the definition of the\r\nformalities to be observed in order that new occupations of African\r\nshores should be considered as effective. The conference began November\r\n15th, Bismarck himself presiding. Fifteen powers participated—Germany,\r\nAustria, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, United States, France, Great Britain,\r\nItaly, The Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, Norway, and Turkey.\r\n\r\nAs the result of three months of deliberation, the Congo State was added\r\nto the list of independent nations, with King Leopold II. as its ruler.\r\nPromptly the new power was recognized by the different nations of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHILDREN AT MOGANDJA, ARUWIMI RIVER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 29, 1907.\r\n\r\nWHAT has the Congo Free State done during its twenty-two\r\nyears—almost—of existence?\r\n\r\nIt has taken possession of a vast area of land, 800,000 square miles in\r\nextent, and dominated it. It has most skillfully developed a mighty\r\nwaterway. We are already familiar with the simple and original method of\r\ndevelopment which has been and is being pursued. We have already called\r\nattention to the fact that, notwithstanding interruption to navigation\r\nhere and there in the Congo and its larger tributaries, there are long\r\nstretches of navigable water above the obstacles. The plan of\r\nutilization and development has been to occupy directly the natural\r\nstretches of navigable water and to get around the cataracts by the\r\nshortest railroad lines possible. This has been done already at two\r\npoints, and will be done at others in the near future. It is the most\r\neconomical manner of developing a way of penetration into the great area\r\nto be developed and exploited.\r\n\r\nIt has continuously carried on geographical explorations by which the\r\nworld’s knowledge of African geography has been profoundly increased. We\r\nhave already called attention to the fact that during the eight years\r\nwhen the A. I. A. was in existence, Belgium equipped and maintained six\r\nexpeditions; during the same period France maintained but two, Germany\r\none, and England none. In other words, Belgium did more for geographic\r\nscience during that time than the other three great nations combined.\r\n\r\nIt has put an end to inter-tribal wars, to execution of slaves at\r\nfunerals and festal occasions, and to cannibalism in all those districts\r\nto which its actual authority extends. It is understood, of course, that\r\ntwenty years is a short time for the penetration of the state’s\r\nauthority into remote parts of its territory. There are still\r\ninter-tribal wars in remote parts of the Congo Free State; executions\r\nand the eating of human flesh are no doubt still common in districts\r\nwhich have but little felt the influence of the white ruler. With the\r\nextension of the definite power of the state into these remoter\r\nsections, these evils will disappear as they have disappeared in the\r\nmore accessible portions of the country.\r\n\r\nIt has developed a native army which is available in case of attack upon\r\nthe integrity of the state, and which serves as a policing party within\r\nits territory. In the first days of the state’s history its soldiery was\r\ndrawn from the Zanzibar district, and to a less degree from the English\r\npossessions along the western coast of Africa. It soon was realized that\r\nfrom every point of view this condition was undesirable. Between the\r\nforeign soldiery and the native people there were no bonds of common\r\ninterest. No national feeling or spirit could develop among them. From\r\nthe point of view of expense the foreign soldier was extremely costly.\r\nFor these different reasons the state early developed the idea of an\r\narmy made of Congo natives. To-day there are but few foreign soldiers in\r\nthe public force.\r\n\r\nIf there is ever to be a real nation in the Congo district there must\r\ndevelop in some way a feeling of unity of blood and interests among the\r\npeople. In tribal life each tribe is absorbed in its own\r\ninterests—petty, of course—and looks upon all other tribes as enemies.\r\nMany of the tribes were insignificant in number and in the area which\r\nthey occupied. Nothing but an outside influence can unite into one\r\nuseful whole such a multitude of petty, distrustful, hostile groups of\r\nmen. In the public force there are soldiers from almost every tribe\r\nwithin the Congo. At the great training camps men are brought together\r\nwho speak different languages, have different customs, and come from\r\nwidely separated areas. Under the military discipline, these men are\r\nbrought into close and long continued relations. They must accommodate\r\nthemselves to one another. They must respect each other’s ways of\r\nthought and doing. At the end of his term of service the soldier goes\r\nout necessarily broadened in his ideas, necessarily less prejudiced and\r\nmore tolerant. The army is the most important influence toward arousing\r\nnational existence.\r\n\r\nIt has conducted many interesting experiments and researches along\r\nscientific lines. While these had frequently practical ends, they were\r\nin themselves worth doing, and their beneficent results are not confined\r\nto the Congo. Thus, at Leopoldville there is a well-equipped\r\nbacteriological institute for the study of tropical diseases. Naturally,\r\nthe most of its attention up to the present has been given to the\r\nsubject of sleeping-sickness.\r\n\r\nThe experiments upon the utilization of the African elephant and the\r\nzebra have general interest; if they fail, the warning may be useful; if\r\nthey succeed, their results will be by no means confined to the Congo\r\nFree State. At Eala is a botanical garden creditably devised and well\r\nconducted. Six hundred species of plants are there in cultivation,\r\nsomething more than half of them being foreign species. There\r\nexperiments are being made upon a broad scale to discover the uses of\r\nnative plants and the possibility of cultivating them to advantage.\r\nForty species of African plants yield rubber; those the product of which\r\nis of a quality to warrant experimenting, are here being cultivated with\r\nreference to ascertaining their value in plantations. Foreign rubber\r\nproducers, coffees from different portions of the globe, medicinal\r\nplants, dye and other useful plants are being tested to find out how\r\nthey flourish in Congo.\r\n\r\nNor is the interest of the Congo Free State in scientific investigations\r\nlimited to its own enterprises. Some time ago a British commission,\r\nconsisting of three specialists in tropical medicines, visited the Congo\r\nwith the purpose of investigating the sleeping-sickness. Not only were\r\nthey given every facility for their investigation, but after they\r\nreturned to England the total expenses of their expedition were returned\r\nwith the compliments of the State government in recognition of the\r\ngeneral value and utility of their investigations. Individual\r\ninvestigators and expeditions of a scientific character within the Congo\r\nState always have found the government interested in furthering and\r\naiding their studies.\r\n\r\nIt has developed a significant and growing section of the world’s\r\ncommerce. When Stanley came down the Congo, the value of the exports\r\nfrom that region was so small that it might be neglected. To-day the\r\nCongo furnishes the world with ivory and supplies a most significant\r\nportion of the rubber which is used. To-day Antwerp is the greatest\r\nmarket for these two products. That Liverpool should lose in relative\r\nimportance in the matter of West African trade is no doubt hard for\r\nEnglishmen. But the world gains by having several great trading centers\r\nin place of one.\r\n\r\nIt has checked the extension of the Arab influence with all its horrors.\r\nTo one who reads Stanley’s description this means much. With this\r\nchecking, the foreign slave trade ceased. Do not misunderstand me. There\r\nwas much admirable in the Arab culture. There is no question that the\r\npractical men, whose views we always keep in mind, and to whom we make\r\nour argument, would approve the substitution of it or the barbarism that\r\nexisted before. But it is certain that it stood in the way of European\r\ninfluence; that it came into conflict with European ideas, and if it\r\nwere desirable that these should ultimately prevail, the Arab life and\r\nculture must disappear.\r\n\r\nWe might, of course, continue and extend our list of the achievements of\r\nthe Congo Free State. We have said enough, however, to show that it has\r\ndone much toward carrying out its promise to civilize and modify the\r\nnative population in the direction of our own ideals. Even the bitter\r\nenemies of the Free State government will admit all this, and more. But\r\nthey claim that all the credit of it disappears in view of the\r\natrocities, the cruelties, and horrors connected with its own\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nAtrocities no doubt exist; they have existed; they will exist. They are\r\never present in cases where a population of natives is exploited by an\r\nactive and aggressive “higher race.” The process of elevating natives,\r\nof making them over in new pattern, is never a happy one for the native.\r\nThe wrenching of old ties, the destruction of old ideals, the replacing\r\nof an ancient life by one different in every detail, is a painful thing.\r\n\r\nI deplore atrocities, but I have often thought that, if I were a member\r\nof a race that was being improved by outside influences, I would rather\r\nthey should kill me outright with bullet or with knife than subject me\r\nto the suffering of years in molding me to new ideas. In other words, I\r\nsometimes feel that flagrant outrage is less painful to the victim than\r\nwell-meant direction, teaching, and elevation to their object.\r\n\r\nLet us turn, however, to the whole subject of atrocities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 30, 1907.\r\n\r\nMUCH has been said of flogging and the chicotte. There is no question\r\nthat flogging is general throughout the Congo Free State. The English\r\nword “flogging” is one which is generally known and understood by\r\nofficials of every nationality throughout the country; it is known, too,\r\nby a surprising number of natives. The chicotte is known to everybody\r\nwithin the state limits—its name is Portuguese. In all my journey in\r\nthe Congo, while I frequently heard the word “flogging” and constantly\r\nheard the word “chicotte,” I never heard the French term for either. Nor\r\ndo I think the native has. It is plain that neither flogging nor the\r\nchicotte was introduced by Belgians. These found them in the country on\r\ntheir arrival, introduced by English and Portuguese.\r\n\r\nIt is not the fact of flogging in itself that raises objections; not\r\nonly the state and traders but the missionaries find it necessary to\r\nwhip their black employés. In fact, at a missionary conference—I think\r\nit was—one missionary referred laughingly to the boys whom another (by\r\nthe way, one of the chief witnesses against the state) “had flogged into\r\nthe kingdom of heaven.” He did not mean the boys had died as a result of\r\nthe flogging, but simply that they had found salvation through its\r\nmeans. It is, then, the amount, severity, and undeservedness of the\r\nwhipping which are reprobated.\r\n\r\nI saw, of course, plenty of flogging. Not, indeed, with such an\r\ninstrument as has been recently shown throughout the United States by a\r\ncomplaining missionary. I was conversing recently with a friend who had\r\nbeen profoundly stirred in connection with Congo atrocities. He happened\r\nto mention the chicotte, then said: “Have you ever seen a chicotte? You\r\nknow it is made of six thongs of hippopotamus skin, twisted tightly\r\ntogether.” I told him that I had seen hundreds of chicottes, but that I\r\nhad never seen one such as he described. As a matter of fact, I have\r\nseen chicottes of a single thong, and of two or three twisted together,\r\nbut I have never seen one composed of six. I do not know whether such an\r\ninstrument would cause greater suffering in punishment, but it certainly\r\nis better suited for display to sympathetic audiences who want to be\r\nharrowed by dreadful reports. The first flogging that I happened to see\r\nwas at a distance. I was busy measuring soldiers; hearing cries, I\r\nlooked in the direction whence they came, and saw a black man being\r\npublicly whipped before the office of the commissaire. An officer of\r\nproper authority was present inspecting the punishment, which I presume\r\nwas entirely legal.\r\n\r\nIn the second flogging which I witnessed, this time at close quarters, I\r\nwas myself implicated to a degree. We were at a mission station. The\r\nmission force and practically all the people from the place were\r\nattending Sunday morning service. It was fruiting time for the mango\r\ntrees, which were loaded with golden fruit. Suddenly we heard an outcry,\r\nand in a moment the mission sentry, delighted and excited, came up to\r\nour veranda with an unfortunate prisoner, whom he had taken in the act\r\nof stealing fruit. He insisted on leaving him with us for guarding. I\r\nturned him over to my companion, who set him on his veranda, telling him\r\nto stay there until the missionary should come from the service.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner squatted down upon the veranda without a word of\r\ndiscussion, laying the fruit, evidence of his guilt, upon the floor at\r\nhis side. We were so angry at him that he made no attempt at escaping,\r\nand did not even eat the fruit which he had stolen, that we washed our\r\nhands of the whole affair, and believed he deserved all that might be\r\ncoming. The service over, the missionary appeared, accompanied by the\r\ntriumphant sentry. When the prisoner had admitted his guilt, the\r\nmissionary asked whether he preferred to be sent to the state for\r\npunishment or to be whipped by him, to which the prisoner replied that\r\nhe should prefer the mission flogging.\r\n\r\nWith great formality the instrument of punishment was produced; it\r\nconsisted of two long and narrow boards, perhaps six feet in length and\r\ntwo or three inches wide; between them was fixed a board of the same\r\nwidth, but of half the length. At one end these were firmly screwed\r\ntogether, while the other end was left open. It will be seen that when a\r\nheavy blow was given with the instrument the free ends of the two long\r\nsticks would strike together, producing a resounding whack which, no\r\ndoubt, produced a psychic suffering in the victim in addition to the\r\ntrue physical pain. However that may be, fifteen blows, I think, were\r\nadministered, and the prisoner discharged.\r\n\r\nOne day, upon the Kasai steamer, we witnessed a wholesale whipping,\r\nwhich was typical of this mode of punishment as regularly administered.\r\nThe night before we had been forced to tie up beside the forest. The\r\nnight was dark and the cutters refused to make wood for the next day’s\r\njourney. This was a serious act of insurrection, involving delay and\r\ntrouble. When, finally, the next morning the wood had been loaded and\r\nthe steamer was under way, ten of the rebels were marched up to the\r\ncaptain. In turn each lay down upon the floor, a friend held his hands\r\nand wrists, while the capita administered twenty blows. It is\r\ncomparatively rare that the white man himself does the flogging; usually\r\nit is the regular capita who is in charge of the workmen, or a special\r\none of the working force detailed to play the part.\r\n\r\nIt makes a notable difference in the way in which the punishment is\r\nreceived whether the hands are firmly held to prevent struggling. An\r\nEnglish-speaking white man not in the government or company employ, who\r\nhad had more or less opportunity for observation in our Southern states,\r\nand whose experience in the Congo extends over several years, told me\r\nthat flogging with the chicotte was a rather mild and simple punishment;\r\nthat it hurt but little, and that, for his part, he preferred to hit the\r\nworkmen on the head and kick them in the shins, those being places more\r\ntender to the application than the part subjected to the chicotte. On\r\nthe whole, I am inclined to think that there was something in what he\r\nsaid. It is certain that in most cases the suffering from a flogging is\r\nmomentary. I have even seen persons undergoing serious flogging exchange\r\nsignificant glances and signals with their friends, in which the\r\nsuggestion of pain was quite absent. Many a time, also, I have seen a\r\nman immediately after being flogged, laughing and playing with his\r\ncompanions as if naught had happened. Personally, though I have seen\r\nmany cases of this form of punishment, I have never seen blood drawn,\r\nnor the fainting of the victim.\r\n\r\nIt is common to speak of the chain-gang with great sympathy. One sees\r\nchain-gangs at every state post; it is the common punishment for minor\r\noffenses to put the prisoner on the chain. Sometimes as many as twelve\r\nor fifteen are thus joined together by chains attached to iron rings\r\nplaced about their necks. They are employed in all sorts of\r\nwork—bringing water for use about the station, sweeping roads, clearing\r\nfields, carrying burdens. On our arrival at a state post, immediately\r\nafter we had presented our introductions to the commandant, the\r\nchain-gang would be sent to bring our freight and baggage to the rooms\r\nto which we were assigned. The ring around the necks of these prisoners\r\nis a light iron ring, weighing certainly not to exceed two pounds. The\r\nweight of chain falling upon each prisoner can hardly be more than six\r\nor eight pounds additional. In other words, the weight which they are\r\nforced to carry in the shape of ring and chain does not exceed, probably\r\ndoes not equal, ten pounds.\r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of service rendered, the chain-gang has little value.\r\nIt dawdles, lags, idles, and plays; only when it is carrying burdens\r\ndoes it really work. I have never seen a chain-gang composed of women,\r\nnor have I seen women on the same gang with men. It is stated by the\r\nmissionaries that such things occur. Certainly, every one would object\r\nto the chaining together of male and female prisoners. Apart from this,\r\nthe chain-gang does not particularly arouse my sympathy. It is a very\r\nmild form of punishment, and one which, of course, is common in as bad a\r\nform or worse throughout many of our Southern states. To grieve over the\r\nweight carried in the form of chain and ring is simply ridiculous; there\r\nare to-day thousands of women among these Congo tribes who for the sake\r\nof decoration carry about their neck a heavy ring of brass weighing\r\ntwenty, twenty-five, or thirty pounds. It is no uncommon thing for both\r\nmen and women to have a weight of thirty, forty, or fifty pounds of\r\nbrass and iron rings and ornaments upon them.\r\n\r\nI cannot believe that the ordinary flogging, such as I have seen, causes\r\nnotable suffering to people who, for purposes of decoration or treatment\r\nof rheumatism, submit without evidence of pain to such operations as I\r\nhave described in detail in an earlier article. Nor can I feel that the\r\nmere fact of carrying chain and ring of less than ten pounds’ weight\r\ninvolves terrible suffering for people who regularly carry much heavier\r\nburdens of ornaments.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of late in regard to hostages. The taking of hostages\r\nand holding them until some obligation or agreement had been performed\r\nwas a common native custom. Stanley frequently captured women and\r\nchildren, or even men, of tribes in the districts through which he was\r\npassing and held them as hostages until they should show him the trail\r\nhe should follow, or until their people supplied him with the food or\r\nother things which he desired. At the ill-fated Yambuya camp the rear\r\nguard frequently seized the women of the natives who had failed to bring\r\nin food supplies in return for the trade stuffs offered. This seizure of\r\nhostages is mentioned repeatedly in the writings of the early travelers,\r\nand seems to have caused no outcry on the part of the sensitive\r\ncivilized world at that time. Why should it now?\r\n\r\nIt is a common practice, though a disagreeable one to us, for one who\r\nsells a thing to keep back a part of it in making delivery of the goods.\r\nOn one occasion we bought a musical instrument, a marimba, which\r\nconsisted, in part, of a dozen gourds as resounding bodies. Every one of\r\nthese gourds was necessary to the instrument, yet the seller, after we\r\nhad examined it with care to see that it was perfect, removed three of\r\nthe gourds, in accordance with this custom. The instrument was sent to\r\nus by the son of the seller’s chief, old Chicoma. When we found the\r\ninstrument at home we at once noted the absence of the three gourds. Old\r\nChicoma’s son had a companion with him. We at once decided to hold the\r\nchief’s son as a hostage, sending word by his companion that he would be\r\nset free only on the appearance of the missing gourds. When we told the\r\nyouth that we had “tied him up,” that being the expression for holding a\r\nperson hostage, he looked sheepish, but made no complaint, recognizing\r\nthe justice of our action.\r\n\r\nThis was at 4 o’clock in the afternoon. He made no attempt to escape,\r\nalthough we had not in any way actually interfered with his freedom of\r\nmovement. We gave him supper when the time came and breakfast in the\r\nmorning. He found his stay tedious, however, and finally, when none was\r\nlooking, slipped away. He must have met the messenger bringing the\r\nmissing gourds before he was any distance from the house, as he appeared\r\nwith our property about half an hour after the flight.\r\n\r\nThe only other personal experience in the matter of hostages that we had\r\nwas in the High Kasai. A white man, agent of the Kasai company, was our\r\nguest for the night. In the early morning our friend, Chief Ndombe,\r\nappeared, in great excitement, begging us to loan him cloth, as the\r\nwhite man had seized one of his slaves and would not release him until\r\nhe had fully paid a debt which the white man claimed he owed him. The\r\nquestion appeared complicated, and we let him have the cloth, after\r\nwhich we went over to hear the palaver accompanying the payment. Both\r\nsides told their story, with much gesticulation. The white man’s boy had\r\nowned a woman, for whom he claimed to have paid six pieces of cloth; she\r\nhad run away, and he had sought in vain for her. The chief, old Chicoma,\r\ntold him that the woman was at Ndombe and in the house of the great\r\nchief. So they seized Ndombe’s slave—a little lad about 11 years of\r\nage, whose bright face and curious head shaving always had greatly\r\nattracted me. This boy our visitors were holding as a hostage until\r\nNdombe should produce the woman or pay her value.\r\n\r\nOf course, the whole procedure was illegal, and I was inclined to take\r\nup the matter vigorously. There were, however, so many elements of doubt\r\nin the matter that I finally concluded to let it pass. Of hostages held\r\nby company agents or by state people we saw but few, and never learned\r\nthe circumstances under which they had been taken. They were rarely in\r\nactual confinement, and we saw no evidences of bad treatment toward\r\nthem. In native custom, the hostages are regularly well treated and fed\r\nregularly, while held in captivity. While we have never seen\r\nmaltreatment of hostages, we can readily understand how such could\r\narise. Taken, as they usually are, in order to force the bringing in of\r\nfood or forest products, if their holding does not produce the desired\r\neffect the feeling of vexation resulting may easily lead to cruelty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEN SENTENCED TO THE DEATH PENALTY FOR MURDER\r\n AND CANNIBALISM, BASOKO]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       January 31, 1907.\r\n\r\nPEOPLE in this country seem to expect that every traveler in the Congo\r\nmust meet with crowds of people who have had one or both hands cut off.\r\nWe have all seen pictures of these unfortunates, and have heard most\r\nharrowing tales in regard to them. Casement, the English consul, whose\r\nreport to the British government has caused so much agitation, and who\r\ndescribed many cases of mutilation, himself saw[A] but a single case;\r\nand that case, though put forward by the missionaries as an example of\r\nstate atrocities, was finally withdrawn by them, as the subject had not\r\nbeen mutilated by human assailants, but by a wild boar. Casement\r\ntraveled many miles and spent much time in securing the material for his\r\nindictment, and yet saw[B] but this one case. We saw a single case of\r\nmutilation. It was a boy at Ikoko, probably some twelve years old. He\r\nhad been found, a child of three or four years, by the side of his dead\r\nmother, after a punitive expedition had visited the town. His mother’s\r\nbody had been mutilated and the child’s hand cut off. We might have seen\r\na second case of this sort at this place if we had searched for her.\r\nThere is a second there.\r\n\r\nNo one, I think, would desire to excuse the barbarity of cutting off the\r\nhands of either dead or living, but we must remember that the soldiers\r\nin these expeditions are natives, and in the excitement and bloodthirst\r\nroused by a military attack they relapse to ancient customs. There has,\r\nindeed, been considerable question recently whether the cutting off of\r\nhands is really a native custom. Sir Francis de Winton, himself an\r\nEnglishman, and Stanley’s successor in the administration of the Congo\r\nState, says that it was. And Glave says: “In every village in this\r\nsection (Lukolela) will be found slaves of both sexes with one ear cut\r\noff. This is a popular form of punishment in an African village. It is\r\nnot at all unusual to hear such threats as ‘I will cut your ear off,’ ‘I\r\nwill sell you,’ or ‘I will kill you,’ and often they are said in\r\nearnest.” Where such customs were constant in native life it is not\r\nstrange that they have lasted on into the present.\r\n\r\nOf course, in this connection we must not forget that mutilation of dead\r\nbodies is not by any means confined to the Congo Free State, nor to its\r\nnatives. Only a few months ago, in Southern Africa, the British force\r\ncut off the head of a hostile chief. When the matter was investigated,\r\nthe excuse given was that it was done for purposes of identification,\r\nand that the body was afterwards brought in and buried with it.\r\n\r\nThe most of the difficulty with the natives of the Congo Free State, of\r\ncourse, comes in connection with the demand to gather rubber. The native\r\nhates the forest; he dislikes to gather rubber; it takes him from his\r\nhome, and comfort, and wife. We have never accompanied a party of\r\nnatives gathering rubber, but we have seen them started and have also\r\nseen them bringing in their product. The best rubber of the Congo is\r\nproduced by vines which frequently grow to several inches in diameter.\r\nThe same vine may be tapped many times. The milky juice, which exudes\r\nabundantly, promptly coagulates into rubber; as it hardens it is rolled\r\ninto balls between the palm and some portion of the body, such as the\r\nchest or leg.\r\n\r\nThe place where we have seen most of rubber production is in the High\r\nKasai, where the famous red rubber is produced, which sells for the\r\nhighest price of any African caoutchouc. My missionary friends have told\r\nme that conditions in the Kasai are not bad and that they have no\r\nspecial fault to find with the Kasai company. While there were things\r\nthat might be criticised, there was apparent fairness in the business.\r\nThe natives waited several days after they had gathered their balls of\r\nrubber before bringing them in. This was for the reason that the\r\ncompany’s agent had but an unattractive stock of goods in his magazine\r\nat the moment; they preferred to wait until a new stock should come up\r\non the expected steamer. As soon as it appeared they sent word that they\r\nmight be expected the following day.\r\n\r\nThe old Bachoko chief, Maiila, was brought in state, in his blue\r\nhammock; his people came singing and dancing with the baskets full of\r\nballs of rubber on their heads. All proceeded to the magazine, where the\r\ngreat steelyards were suspended and the rubber weighed; each man looked\r\ncarefully to see that his stock balanced evenly, and one of their\r\nnumber, who understood the instrument and could figure, stood by to see\r\nthat all went fair. While the rubber was a demanded tax, a regular price\r\nof 1 franc and 25 centimes the kilo was paid. This was given in stuffs,\r\nof course, and the native selected what he pleased from the now abundant\r\nstock of cloths, blankets, graniteware, and so forth. It may truly be\r\nsaid that they came in singing gayly and went home glad.\r\n\r\nAt Mobandja we saw a large party setting out to the forest to gather\r\nrubber, different from any that we had seen before in that a\r\nconsiderable number of women formed a part of it. This feature I did not\r\nlike, although I presume it is an effort to meet the criticisms of the\r\nreport of the royal commission of investigation. The commission\r\nparticularly criticised the fact that the men, in going into the forest,\r\nwere deprived of the company of their women—a hardship strongly\r\nemphasized. It is surely a mistake, however well it may be meant, to\r\nsend the women into the forest with the men to gather rubber. Such a\r\nprocedure involves the neglect of her fields and interrupts the woman’s\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAnd here we touch upon the thing which in my opinion is the worst\r\nfeature of the whole Congo business. Anything that affects the woman’s\r\nwork necessarily brings hardship. I have seen many heart-rending\r\nstatements in regard to the loss of work time which the man suffers by\r\ngoing to the forest to gather rubber. We are told that by the time he\r\nhas gone several days’ journey into the dense forest, gathered his balls\r\nof rubber, and returned again to his village, he has no time left for\r\nwork, and his family and the whole community suffers as a consequence.\r\nBut from what work does this gathering of rubber take the man?\r\n\r\nWe have already called attention to the fact that the support of the\r\nfamily and the actual work in any village fall upon the woman. The man,\r\nbefore he went into the forest to gather rubber, had no pressing duties.\r\nHis wife supported him; he spent his time in visiting, dancing, lolling\r\nunder shelters, drinking with his friends, or in palavers, sometimes of\r\ngreat importance but frequently of no consequence; in other words, he\r\nwas an idler, or a man of leisure. I feel no sorrow on account of the\r\nlabors from which he is restrained. Personally, I should have no\r\nobjection to his idling. If he does not want to work and need not work,\r\nI see no reason why he should not idle. But my readers are practical\r\nmen, who talk much of the dignity of labor and the elevation of the lazy\r\nnegro. Very good; if work is dignified and the elevation of the negro\r\nnecessary, let him collect rubber, but do not mourn over the fact that\r\nhe is deprived of opportunity to earn a living for himself and family.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, one set of circumstances under which the man may\r\nreally be deprived of opportunity to aid in the work of gaining a\r\nliving. Where the men in a community are really fishermen—they are not\r\nalways so—to take them from their fishing entails a hardship.\r\n\r\nThe thing which seems to me the worst is the kwanga tax on women and the\r\nfish tax on men. The former is at its worst, perhaps, in Leopoldville;\r\nthe latter is bad enough at Nouvelle Anvers. Leopoldville is situated in\r\na district which yields much less for food than necessary. It has always\r\nbeen so. Even in the days before the white man came, the people in the\r\nnative villages on Stanley Pool were obliged to buy food supplies from\r\noutside, as they themselves, being devoted to trading, did no\r\ncultivation. With the coming of the white man, and the establishing of a\r\ngreat post at Leopoldville, with thousands of native workmen and\r\nsoldiers to be fed, the food question became serious. The state has\r\nsolved the problem by levying a food tax on the native villages for many\r\nmiles around.\r\n\r\nThe women are required to bring a certain amount of kwanga—native\r\ncassava bread—to Leopoldville within a stated period of time. To do\r\nthis involves almost continuous labor, and really leaves the women\r\nlittle time for attending to the needs of their own people. Some of them\r\nare forced to come many miles with the supply of bread. When they have\r\ncared for the growing plants in their fields, prepared the required\r\nstint of kwanga, brought it the weary distance over the trails, and\r\nagain come back to their village, they must begin to prepare for the\r\nnext installment. For this heavy burden there must certainly be found\r\nsome remedy. Personally, it seems to me that the women belonging to the\r\nworkmen and the soldiers might be utilized in cultivating extensive\r\nfields to supply the need. The condition of the men who pay the fish tax\r\nis analogous to that of these kwanga-taxed women.\r\n\r\nThe question of the population of the Congo is an unsettled one. Stanley\r\nestimated it at 29,000,000 people; Reclus, in 1888, estimated it at\r\nsomething over 20,000,000; Wagner and Supan claimed 17,000,000, and\r\nVierkandt sets the figure at 11,000,000. The governor-general, Baron\r\nWahis, who has several times made the inspection of the whole river, is\r\ninclined to think that even Stanley’s figure is below the true one.\r\nBetween these limits of 11,000,000 and 29,000,000 any one may choose\r\nwhich he prefers. No one knows, or is likely for many years to know.\r\nThose who believe that Stanley’s figure was true in its time, and that\r\nVierkandt’s is true at present, may well insist, as they do, that\r\ndepopulation is taking place.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have no doubt that depopulation is going on. Of course,\r\nthe enemies of the Free State government attribute the diminution in\r\npopulation chiefly to the cruelties practiced by the state, but it is\r\ncertain that many causes combine in the result.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the Congo population is exceedingly irregular. From\r\nStanley Pool to Chumbiri there has been almost no population during the\r\nperiod of our knowledge. On the other hand, from Basoko to Stanley Falls\r\nthe population is abundant and there is almost a continuous line of\r\nnative villages along the banks for miles. Practically, the state of\r\npopulation is really known only along the river banks. Back from the\r\nriverines are inland tribes, the areas of which in some cases are but\r\nsparsely settled, while in others they swarm. They are, however, little\r\nknown, and just how the population is distributed is uncertain. The\r\ndistrict which we personally best know—the Kasai—is one of the most\r\npopulous of all the Congo State, and around the Sankuru, one of the main\r\ntributaries of the Kasai, we perhaps have the densest population of the\r\ncountry. If we take Stanley’s estimate as accurate, the population would\r\naverage twelve to the square kilometer.\r\n\r\nAmong known causes for the diminution of Congo population we may mention\r\nfirst the raiding expeditions of the Arabs. These were numerous and\r\ndestructive in the extreme, throughout the region of the Upper Congo and\r\nthe Lualaba. Organized for taking slaves and getting booty, they\r\ndestroyed ruthlessly the adult male population and deported the women\r\nand children. Towns were burned and whole districts left unoccupied.\r\nThere is no question that many of the punitive expeditions of the state\r\nhave been far more severe than necessity demanded; “the people must be\r\nshown the power of Bula Matadi.” It is said that Vankerckhoven’s\r\nexpedition destroyed whole towns needlessly in the district of Chumbiri\r\nand Bolobo. Certainly, the population in this section was formerly\r\nabundant. Everywhere along the shores one sees the groups of palm trees\r\nmarking the sites of former villages; probably the present population is\r\nno more than one fourth that which existed formerly.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole district, where the French Congo touches on the\r\nriver, it is a common thing for timid or disgruntled villagers to move\r\n_en masse_ across the river into French territory. These wholesale\r\nremovals are an advantage to the natives, as that portion of the French\r\nCongo is less well occupied by white posts and government officials than\r\nthe corresponding part of the Congo Free State. The natives who have\r\nthus removed unquestionably have an easier time in the French colony.\r\nThis, however, can hardly be called depopulation, as it involves no loss\r\nin persons, but merely a transfer from the Free State side to the other.\r\nIt does not at all affect the actual number of the race.\r\n\r\nSleeping-sickness is carrying off its tens of thousands.\r\n\r\nBut after we suggest these causes we are still far from a full solution\r\nof the problem of depopulation, which is a mysterious thing. In\r\nPolynesia we have another example of it on a prodigious scale. In\r\nPolynesia we have neither slave raids, nor punitive expeditions, nor\r\nsleeping-sickness. Yet, adults die and children are not born. If things\r\ncontinue in the future as in the past, the time is not far distant when\r\nthe Polynesian—one of the most interesting and attractive of human\r\nraces—will be a thing completely of the past.\r\n\r\nThe case of our own American Indians is similar. Whole tribes have\r\ndisappeared; others are dying out so rapidly that a few years will see\r\ntheir complete extinction. I am familiar with the arguments which, from\r\ntime to time, are printed to demonstrate that the number of American\r\nIndians is as great as ever. It seems, however, that it is only rich\r\ntribes that hold their own; the reason is not far to seek, but we may\r\nnot here pursue the argument further.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n[A] I am here in error. Casement _saw_ more than one case of mutilation;\r\nhe carefully _investigated_ but one.\r\n\r\n[B] See footnote A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       February 1, 1907.\r\n\r\nNOR is apparent depopulation of the Congo a matter of recent date.\r\nQuotations might be given from many travelers. We quote three from\r\nBentley, because he was well acquainted with the country and because he\r\nwas an English missionary. In speaking of the town of Mputu, an hour and\r\na half distant from San Salvador, he describes the chief, Mbumba, a man\r\nof energy, feared in all his district. He was strict in his demands\r\nregarding conduct. In his presence others were required to sit\r\ntailor-fashion. “To ease the cramped limbs, by stretching them out\r\nbefore one, is a gross breach of decorum; any one who did so in Mbumba’s\r\npresence was taken out, and was fortunate if he lost only an ear. We\r\nhave known several great chiefs who would order a man who sat carelessly\r\nto be thus mutilated. His own people were much afraid of him on account\r\nof his cruel, murderous ways; for a small offense he would kill them\r\nrelentlessly. He was superstitious and very ready to kill witches.\r\nThrough his evil temper, pride, and superstition, his town of several\r\nhundred people was reduced to eighty or ninety souls.”\r\n\r\nAgain he says: “Our next camp was at Manzi; but as we had so many\r\npeople, the natives preferred that we should camp in a wood at Matamba,\r\ntwenty minutes’ walk beyond the town. The wood marked the site of a town\r\ndeserted some years before. There were no other towns on the road from\r\nthere to Isangila, a distance of thirty miles, for the wicked people had\r\nkilled each other out over their witch palavers. This was what the\r\nnatives told us themselves. Yet they went on killing their witches,\r\nbelieving that if they did not do so all the people would be\r\nexterminated. Two wretched villages of a few huts each were to be found\r\na few miles off the path, but the country was practically depopulated.”\r\n\r\nIn another place he says, in speaking of the caravan days: “All the\r\ncarriers suffered acutely from fever, and this was the case with all the\r\ncaravans on the road. This mortality was largely increased by the\r\nimprovidence of the carriers themselves. Thousands of men were engaged\r\nin transport work at the time, but very few troubled to carry enough\r\nfood with them, or money wherewith to buy it. As a rule, the young men\r\nstaid in their towns as long as they had anything to buy food with; when\r\nthey failed, they borrowed until their debts became too great. Then they\r\narranged to go with some caravan to carry, and received ration money for\r\nthe road. This would be partly used up in the town, and the rest go to\r\nthose from whom they borrowed. On the road they lived largely on palm\r\nnuts and raw cassava, and returned to their homes in a terribly\r\nexhausted condition. With the influx of cloth gained by transportation\r\ncame hunger, for wealth made the women lazy; they preferred to buy food\r\nrather than produce—the gardens came to an end, then hunger followed,\r\nand sickness and death. Women staid at home to mourn, and the mischief\r\nbecame worse. Sleep-sickness and smallpox spread. The population of the\r\ncataracts district is not more than half what it was fifteen years ago.\r\nThe railway is now complete, and the country will adapt itself to its\r\nnew conditions.”\r\n\r\nThose who are hostile to the state, of course, will find great comfort\r\nin this quotation; for the transport system was an introduction by the\r\nBelgians. It will be observed, however, that the author mentions no\r\ncruelty on the part of the new masters in this connection; it must also\r\nbe remembered that the missionaries were as much interested in the\r\ncaravan system as any, and assisted in its development. My chief object\r\nin introducing the quotation is to show how impossible it is to affect\r\nnative conditions in one way without bringing about a connected series\r\nof changes, not always easy to foresee.\r\n\r\nTo me, the real wonder is that there are any of the Congo peoples left.\r\nThink of the constant drain due to the foreign slave trade, continued\r\nfrom an early date until after the middle of the last century. Think of\r\nthe continuous losses due to the barbarism of native chiefs and demands\r\nof native customs—to wars, cannibalism, execution, and ordeal. Think of\r\nthe destruction caused by punitive expeditions—towns burned, people\r\nkilled. Think of the drafts made by the caravan system and the public\r\nworks which the state has been forced to carry out. Think of the\r\nmultitudes who have died with the diseases of the country and from\r\npestilence introduced by the newcomers. Yet the population really shows\r\nsigns of great vitality to-day, and the most discouraged missionary\r\nhesitates a real prediction for the future.\r\n\r\nThere is a most interesting and suggestive map in Morel’s new book, “Red\r\nRubber.” It bears the legend, “Map showing revenue division of the Congo\r\nFree State.” Upon this map we find marked with little crosses the\r\nlocalities where specific reports of atrocities have been received. The\r\ndistribution of these crosses is interesting. We find a concentration of\r\nthem along the main river from the Rubi River almost to the mouth of the\r\nKasai, a notable bunch of them in the region of the A. B. I. R., and in\r\nan area worked by the Antwerp trust; also in the district of Lake\r\nLeopold II. There are few crosses indicative of bad treatment in the\r\nCongo above this district, and practically none in the lower Congo and\r\nthe Kasai. It is precisely in the areas where these crosses are so\r\nfrequent that the early travelers had difficulty with the natives in\r\nfirst traversing the country. In other words, the districts where native\r\nhostility has in recent years produced the acts of alleged cruelty have\r\nalways been centers of disturbance and attack against the white man.\r\nDistricts which were found occupied by peaceful and friendly tribes have\r\nbeen the scenes of few outrages. This seems to me a point worthy of\r\nserious consideration.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I believe that any well-behaved white man can to-day\r\ntraverse Africa in every direction without danger as long as his journey\r\nconfines itself to areas of Bantu and true negroes. Livingstone\r\npractically had no trouble with native tribes; Schweinfurth, entering\r\nfrom the Nile, penetrated to the heart of Africa with little trouble; Du\r\nChaillu traveled throughout the Ogowe valley without difficulty with\r\nnatives; Junker, following Schweinfurth’s trail, penetrated farther into\r\nwhat is now the Congo Free State, passing through the territory of many\r\nwarlike and cannibal tribes, but never armed his men and never had a\r\ndifficulty with any native chief. It is true, however, that the tribes\r\nof the Congo differ vastly from each other in disposition. Some are\r\nwarlike, some are peaceful to cowardice; some are genial, friendly,\r\nopen; others are surly, hostile, reserved, treacherous. While I have\r\nalways felt that Stanley looked for trouble and that he left a trail of\r\nblood unnecessarily behind him, I recognize that the Bangala and many of\r\ntheir neighbors are less agreeable, less kindly, more disposed for\r\ntrouble than many of the other tribes in the Free State. It is precisely\r\nwith these tribes that the chief difficulties of the state have been.\r\n\r\nAnother curious point is shown on Morel’s map. From what has been said\r\nby critics of the state we would be justified in expecting to find those\r\ndistricts where the white man’s influence had penetrated most fully, and\r\nwhere he himself existed in greatest number, the worst in the matter of\r\natrocity. But it is precisely in these districts that Morel’s map shows\r\nno marks of reported atrocities. It is plain, then, that the officials\r\nof the Congo Free State are not, as a body, men delighting in cruelty\r\nand outrage. Where there are numbers of them, instead of conditions\r\nbeing at their worst they are at their happiest. It is only where there\r\nare lonely men surrounded by depressing influences and in the midst of\r\nhostile and surly tribes that these dreadful things are found. It is\r\nnatural to expect that with fuller penetration of the white men into\r\nthese districts conditions will change hopefully.\r\n\r\nBut why should we pick out the Congo Free State for our assault?\r\nAtrocities occur wherever the white man, with his thirst for gold, comes\r\ninto contact with “a lower people.” He is ever there to exploit; he\r\nbelieves that they were created for exploitation. If we want to find\r\ncruelty, atrocities, all kinds of frightful maltreatment, we may find\r\nthem in almost every part of negro Africa. They exist in the French\r\nCongo, in German Africa, in Nigeria, even in Uganda. If we insist on\r\nfinding them, we may find cruelty, dispossession, destruction of life\r\nand property, in all these areas. The only ruthless act involving the\r\ndeath of a black native that we really saw was in French territory. If\r\nthere were any object in doing so, we could write a harrowing story of\r\nBritish iniquity in Africa, but it is unnecessary; every one who stops\r\nto think and who reads at all knows the fact.\r\n\r\nWherever British trade finds native custom standing in its way, we shall\r\nfind cruelty. Why was King Ja Ja deported? I have heard an interesting\r\nincident connected with his case. One who for many years has voyaged up\r\nand down the western coast of Africa tells me that while Ja Ja was still\r\nat his height of power the natives of his district, paddling near the\r\nshores in their canoes, were always happy and joyous. Ja Ja stood in the\r\nway of the British traders gaining so much money as they wanted, and so\r\nhe was exiled and taken a prisoner to distant lands. From the day of his\r\ndeparture the happiness of life was gone from all the country. Few\r\nnatives put out in their canoes, and those who did were silent; the song\r\nand laughter of former days were hushed. Until the day when he was\r\nbrought home, a corpse, for burial, somberness and sadness settled down\r\nupon his people, before so gay and light hearted. What was it caused the\r\ntrouble at Benin but British greed insisting on opening up a territory\r\nwhich its natives desired to keep closed? The Benin massacre that\r\nfollowed was dreadful, but it did not begin to compare in frightful\r\nbloodshed with the punitive expedition which followed—a feat scarce\r\nworthy of British arms. What was the cause of hut-tax wars? What is the\r\nmatter now in Natal? Do we know all that goes on in Nigeria? Wherein is\r\nexcellence in the expropriation of lands and products in Uganda for the\r\nbenefit of concession companies of the same kind exactly as those in\r\nCongo? Why is it worse to cut off the hands of dead men for purposes of\r\ntally than to cut off the heads of dead chiefs for purposes of\r\nidentification? But let it pass—we are not undertaking an assault on\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       February 2, 1907.\r\n\r\nRETURNED from the Congo country and a year and more of contact with\r\nthe dark natives, I find a curious and most disagreeable sensation has\r\npossession of me. I had often read and heard that other peoples\r\nregularly find the faces of white men terrifying and cruel. The Chinese,\r\nthe Japanese, other peoples of Asia, all tell the same story.\r\n\r\nThe white man’s face is fierce and terrible. His great and prominent\r\nnose suggests the tearing beak of some bird of prey. His fierce face\r\ncauses babes to cry, children to run in terror, grown folk to tremble. I\r\nhad always been inclined to think that this feeling was individual and\r\ntrifling; that it was solely due to strangeness and lack of contact.\r\nTo-day I know better. Contrasted with the other faces of the world, the\r\nface of the fair white is terrible, fierce, and cruel. No doubt our\r\nintensity of purpose, our firmness and dislike of interference, our\r\nmanner in walk and action, and in speech, all add to the effect. However\r\nthat may be, both in Europe and our own land, after my visit to the\r\nblacks, I see the cruelty and fierceness of the white man’s face as I\r\nnever would have believed was possible. For the first time, I can\r\nappreciate fully the feeling of the natives. The white man’s dreadful\r\nface is a prediction; where the fair white goes he devastates, destroys,\r\ndepopulates. Witness America, Australia, and Van Diemen’s Land.\r\n\r\nMorel’s “Red Rubber” contains an introductory chapter by Sir Harry\r\nJohnston. In it the ex-ruler of British Central Africa says the\r\nfollowing: “A few words as to the logic of my own position as a critic\r\nof King Leopold’s rule on the Congo. I have been reminded, in some of\r\nthe publications issued by the Congo government; that I have instituted\r\na hut-tax in regions intrusted to my administration; that I have created\r\ncrown lands which have become the property of the government; that as an\r\nagent of the government I have sold and leased portions of African soil\r\nto European traders; that I have favored, or at any rate have not\r\ncondemned, the assumption by an African state of control over natural\r\nsources of wealth; that I have advocated measures which have installed\r\nEuropeans as the master—for the time being—over the uncivilized negro\r\nor the semicivilized Somali, Arab, or Berber.”\r\n\r\nIt is true that Sir Harry Johnston has done all these things. They are\r\nthings which, done by Belgium, are heinous in English eyes. He proceeds\r\nto justify them by their motive and their end. He aims to show a notable\r\ndifference between these things as Belgian and as English. He seems to\r\nfeel that the fact of a portion of the product of these acts being used\r\nto benefit the native is an ample excuse. But so long as (a) the judge\r\nof the value of the return made to the sufferer is the usurper, and not\r\nthe recipient, there is no difference between a well-meaning overlord\r\nand a bloody-minded tyrant; and (b) as long as the taxed is not\r\nconsulted and his permission is not gained for taxation, there is only\r\ninjustice in its infliction, no matter for what end. Sir Harry uses the\r\nword “logic.” A logical argument leaves him and Leopold in precisely the\r\nsame position with reference to the native.\r\n\r\nSir Harry closes his introduction with a strange and interesting\r\nstatement. He says:\r\n\r\n“The danger in this state of affairs lies in the ferment of hatred which\r\nis being created against the white race in general, by the agents of the\r\nking of Belgium, in the minds of the Congo negroes. The negro has a\r\nremarkably keen sense of justice. He recognizes in British Central\r\nAfrica, in East Africa, in Nigeria, in South Africa, in Togoland,\r\nDahomey, the Gold Coast, Sierra Leone, and Senegambia that, on the\r\nwhole, though the white men ruling in those regions have made some\r\nmistakes and committed some crimes, have been guilty of some injustice,\r\nyet that the state of affairs they have brought into existence as\r\nregards the black man is one infinitely superior to that which preceded\r\nthe arrival of the white man as a temporary ruler. Therefore, though\r\nthere may be a rising here or a partial tumult there, the mass of the\r\npeople increase and multiply with content and acquiesce in our tutelary\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n“Were it otherwise, any attempt at combination on their part would soon\r\noverwhelm us and extinguish our rule. Why, in the majority of cases, the\r\nsoldiers with whom we keep them in subjection are of their own race. But\r\nunless some stop can be put to the misgovernment of the Congo region, I\r\nventure to warn those who are interested in African politics that a\r\nmovement is already begun and is spreading fast which will unite the\r\nnegroes against the white race, a movement which will prematurely stamp\r\nout the beginnings of the new civilization we are trying to implant, and\r\nagainst which movement, except so far as the actual coast line is\r\nconcerned, the resources of men and money which Europe can put into the\r\nfield will be powerless.”\r\n\r\nThis is curious and interesting. But it is scarcely logical or candid.\r\nAllow me to quote beside Sir Harry’s observations the following, taken\r\nfrom the papers of March 4, 1906:\r\n\r\n“Sir Arthur Lawley, who has just been appointed governor of Madras,\r\nafter devoting many years to the administration of the Transvaal, gave\r\nfrank utterance the other day, before his departure from South Africa\r\nfor India, to his conviction that ere long a great rising of the blacks\r\nagainst the whites will take place, extending all over the British\r\ncolonies from the Cape to the Zambesi. Sir Arthur, who is recognized as\r\nan authority on all problems connected with the subject of native races,\r\nbesides being a singularly level-headed man, spoke with profound\r\nearnestness when he explained in the course of the farewell address:\r\n‘See to this question. For it is the greatest problem you have to face.’\r\nAnd the solemn character of his valedictory warning was rendered\r\nadditionally impressive in the knowledge that it was based upon\r\ninformation beyond all question.”\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the affairs in the Congo Free State have produced\r\nneither restlessness nor concerted action in British Africa. Why is it\r\nthat on both sides of Southern Africa there have been recent outbreaks\r\nof turbulence? The natives, indeed, seem ungrateful for the benefits of\r\nEnglish rule. Sir Arthur Lawley looks for a rising over the whole of\r\nBritish Africa, from the Cape to the Zambesi. In what way can the\r\nmisgovernment of the Congo by its ruler have produced a condition so\r\nthreatening? Both these gentlemen have reason, perhaps, for their fears\r\nof an outbreak, but as I have said, there is neither logic nor candor in\r\nattributing the present agitation in Southern Africa to King Leopold.\r\n\r\nWhat really is the motive underlying the assault upon the Congo? What\r\nhas maintained an agitation and a propaganda with apparently such\r\ndisinterested aims? Personally, although I began my consideration of the\r\nquestion with a different belief, I consider it entirely political and\r\nselfish. Sir Harry Johnston naïvely says: “When I first visited the\r\nwestern regions of the Congo it was in the days of imperialism, when\r\nmost young Britishers abroad could conceive of no better fate for an\r\nundeveloped country than to come under the British flag. The outcome of\r\nStanley’s work seemed to me clear; it should be eventually the\r\nBritannicising of much of the Congo basin, perhaps in friendly agreement\r\nand partition of interests with France and Portugal.”\r\n\r\nUnquestionably this notion of the proper solution of the question took\r\npossession of many minds in Great Britain at the same time. And England\r\nwas never satisfied with the foundation of the Congo Free State as an\r\nindependent nation.\r\n\r\nA little further on, Sir Harry states that the British missionaries of\r\nthat time were against such solution; they did not wish the taking over\r\nof the district by Great Britain. And why? “They anticipated troubles\r\nand bloodshed arising from any attempt on the part of Great Britain to\r\nsubdue the vast and unknown regions of the Congo, even then clearly\r\nthreatened by Arabs.” In other words, Britons at home would have been\r\nglad to have absorbed the Congo; Britons on the ground feared the\r\ntrouble and bloodshed necessary. But now that the Belgians have borne\r\nthe trouble and the bloodshed and paid the bills, Britain does not\r\ndespise the plum. Indeed, Britain’s ambitions in Africa are magnificent.\r\nWhy should she not absorb the entire continent? She has\r\nEgypt—temporarily—and shows no sign of relinquishing it; she has the\r\nTransvaal and the Orange Free State; how she picked a quarrel and how\r\nshe seized them we all know. Now she could conveniently annex the Congo.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries in the Congo Free State are no doubt honest in saying,\r\nwhat they say on every possible occasion, that they do not wish England\r\nto take over the country; that they would prefer to have it stay in\r\nBelgian hands; that, however, they would have the Belgian government\r\nitself responsible instead of a single person. I believe them honest\r\nwhen they say this, but I think them self-deceived; I feel convinced\r\nthat if the question was placed directly to them, “Shall England or\r\nBelgium govern the Congo?” and they knew that their answer would be\r\ndecisive, their vote would be exceedingly one-sided and produce a change\r\nof masters. But the missionaries are not the British government; they do\r\nnot shape the policies of the empire; their agitation may be useful to\r\nthe scheming politician and may bring about results which they\r\nthemselves had not intended. It is always the scheme of rulers and of\r\nparties to take advantage of the generous outbursts of sympathy and\r\nfeeling of the masses for their selfish ends.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries and many of the prominent agitators in the propaganda\r\nagainst the Free State have said they would be satisfied if Belgium\r\ntakes over the government. This statement never has seemed to me honest\r\nor candid. The agitators will not be suited if Belgium takes the Congo;\r\nI have said this all the time, and the incidents of the last few days\r\nhave demonstrated the justness of my opinion. Already hostility to\r\nBelgian ownership is evident. It will increase. When the king really\r\nturns the Congo Free State government into Belgium’s hands the agitation\r\nwill continue, complaints still will be made, and conditions will be\r\nmuch as formerly.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain never has been the friend of the Congo Free State; its\r\nbirth thwarted her plans; its continuance threatens her commerce and\r\ninterferes with expansion and with the carrying out of grand\r\nenterprises. In the earlier edition of his little book entitled “The\r\nColonization of Africa,” Sir Harry Johnston spoke in high terms of the\r\nCongo Free State and the work which it was doing. In the later editions\r\nof the same book he retracts his words of praise; he quotes the\r\natrocities and maladministration of the country. My quotation is not\r\nverbal, as for the moment I have not the book at hand, but he ends by\r\nsaying something of this sort: “Belgium should rule the Congo Free\r\nState; it may safely be allowed to govern the greater portion of that\r\nterritory.”\r\n\r\n“The greater portion of the territory”—and what portion is it that\r\nBelgium perhaps cannot well govern? Of course, that district through\r\nwhich the Cape-to-Cairo Railroad would find its most convenient roadbed.\r\nIf Great Britain can get that, we shall hear no more of Congo\r\natrocities. There are two ways possible in which this district may be\r\ngained. If England can enlist our sympathy, our aid, our influence, she\r\nmay bid defiance to Germany and France and seize from Leopold or from\r\nlittle Belgium so much of the Congo Free State as she considers\r\nnecessary for her purpose, leaving the rest to the king or to his\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nIf we are not to be inveigled into such assistance, she may, in time and\r\nby good diplomacy, come to an understanding with France and Germany for\r\nthe partition of the Free State. Of course, in such event France would\r\ntake that section which adjoins her territory, Germany would take the\r\nwhole Kasai, which was first explored and visited by German travelers,\r\nand England would take the eastern portion, touching on Uganda and\r\nfurnishing the best site for her desired railroad.\r\n\r\nThe same steamer which took me to the Congo carried a newly appointed\r\nBritish vice-consul to that country. On one occasion he detailed to a\r\nmissionary friend his instructions as laid down in his commission. I was\r\nseated close by those in conversation, and no attempt was made on my\r\npart to overhear or on their part toward secrecy. His statement\r\nindicated that the prime object of his appointment was to make a careful\r\nexamination of the Aruwimi River, to see whether its valley could be\r\nutilized for a railroad. The second of the four objects of his\r\nappointment was to secure as large a volume as possible of complaints\r\nfrom British subjects (blacks) resident in the Congo Free State. The\r\nthird was to accumulate all possible information regarding atrocities\r\nupon the natives. These three, out of four, objects of his appointment\r\nseem to be most interesting and suggestive.\r\n\r\nOn a later occasion I was in company with this same gentleman. A\r\nmissionary present had expressed anxiety that the report of the\r\ncommission of inquiry and investigation should appear. It will be\r\nremembered that a considerable time elapsed between the return of the\r\ncommission to Europe and the publishing of its report. After the\r\nmissionary had expressed his anxiety for its appearance and to know its\r\ncontents, the vice-consul remarked: “It makes no difference when the\r\nreport appears; it makes no difference if it never appears; the British\r\ngovernment has decided upon its course of action, and it will not be\r\ninfluenced by whatever the commission’s report may contain.” Comment\r\nupon this observation is superfluous.\r\n\r\nUpon the Atlantic steamer which brought us from Antwerp to New York City\r\nthere was a young Canadian returning from three years abroad. He knew\r\nthat we had been in the Congo Free State, and on several occasions\r\nconversed with me about my journey. We had never referred to atrocities,\r\nnor conditions, nor politics. One day, with no particular reason in the\r\npreceding conversation for the statement, he said: “Of course, the\r\nBelgians will lose the Congo. We have got to have it. We must build the\r\nCape-to-Cairo road. You know, we wanted the Transvaal. We found a way to\r\nget it; we have it. So we will find some way to get the Congo.”\r\n\r\nOf course, this was the remark of a very young man. But the remarks of\r\nyoung men, wild and foolish though they often sound, usually voice the\r\nfeelings and thoughts which older men cherish, but dare not speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONSTRUCTING NEW HOUSES AT BASOKO]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       February 3, 1907.\r\n\r\nOUGHT we to interfere? In this whole discussion I have looked at the\r\nquestion solely from the humanitarian standpoint. I assume that\r\nSecretary Root’s first presentation of the matter was carefully\r\nprepared. He insisted that we had no grounds for interference, insofar\r\nas the Berlin conference was concerned. It is only, then, from the point\r\nof view of interest in the natives, the desire to save them from\r\nsuffering and from atrocity, that we can join with England in calling a\r\nnew conference of the world’s powers to consider Congo matters. Ought we\r\nto pursue such a course? We ought not, and that for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst—We should not interfere in Congo matters from philanthropic\r\nreasons, unless we are ready to undertake the policing of the whole of\r\nAfrica. If the atrocities in the Congo are sufficient to involve us in\r\ndifficulty with Belgium or with Belgium’s king, the atrocities and\r\ncruelty practiced in the French Congo, throughout German Africa, in the\r\nPortuguese possessions, and even in the English colonies, must also\r\nattract our notice. If we really intervene to save the African black man\r\nfrom white oppression, we must do this job thoroughly and on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nSecond—We should not interfere with the conditions in Congo unless we\r\ndesire strained relations with France and Germany. No possible agitation\r\nwill bring about a second meeting of all the powers that participated in\r\nthe Berlin conference. Turkey alone, so far, has signified her\r\nwillingness to act with England. The only other nation in which there\r\nseems to be the slightest trend toward participation is Italy. No\r\nScandinavian country—Sweden, Norway, Denmark—will join in the\r\nmovement. The many Scandinavians who, in one capacity or another, have\r\nlabored in the Congo Free State are, on the whole, well satisfied with\r\nthe conditions. Though there is a vigorous and aggressive Swedish\r\nmission in the country, it is significant that its members have never\r\njoined in the agitation. Nor is Holland, which has sent a large number\r\nof individuals into the Congo State as employés of government and\r\nconcession companies, likely to favor an agitation. Austria, for various\r\nreasons, stands aloof. France has a definite understanding whereby in\r\ncase of the dissolution of the Congo Free State she becomes heir to all\r\nthe district. Germany, responsible for the foundation of the Congo Free\r\nState, has, on the whole, always favored its existence, and would\r\ncertainly oppose interference in its affairs. In case of the partition\r\nof the Congo, Germany would be willing enough to take her share, but it\r\nis really more to her interest both at home and abroad to maintain its\r\nindependence. All these European countries speak quite freely in regard\r\nto England’s design. France and Germany would seriously oppose any\r\ndemonstration by England and the United States.\r\n\r\nThird—We ought not to interfere unless we are really willing to play\r\nthe undignified part of pulling England’s chestnuts from the fire. What\r\nwould we, nationally, gain by the partition of the Congo? Our repeated\r\ndeclarations about not wishing new territory in distant regions are, of\r\ncourse, looked upon as twaddle by other nations. If we really mean them,\r\nwe must avoid the very appearance of evil. What will the natives gain by\r\npartition? They will still have their oppressors, only they will be\r\ndivided around among three instead of being exploited by one. Suppose\r\nthe redistribution did take place. Suppose France, Germany, and England\r\ndivided the Congo between them; suppose—as would be certain—that\r\noppression and atrocity continued in the divided territory. Would we\r\nstill continue our noble effort in behalf of the suffering black\r\nmillions?\r\n\r\nFourth—We should not interfere, unless we wish to present a glaring\r\nexample of national inconsistency. Distance lends enchantment to the\r\nview. We are solicitous about the Bantu in their home under the rule of\r\nLeopold II.; we have 12,000,000 or more of them within our own United\r\nStates. The Bantu in the Congo we love. We suffer when he is whipped,\r\nshudder when he is put upon a chain-gang, shriek when he is murdered.\r\nYet, here he may be whipped, put on the chain-gang, murdered, and if any\r\nraise an outcry he is a sentimentalist. Our negro problem is a serious\r\nand difficult one. We do not know how to treat it. But it is at our\r\ndoor, and we can study it and strike out some mode of treatment. But the\r\nyears pass, and we do nothing. So complicated is it and so united\r\ntogether and interdependent its issues and its elements, that any course\r\nof action is dangerous, because we frequently cannot foresee the outcome\r\nof well-meant effort. With this example constantly before us, one would\r\nsuppose that we would hesitate in meddling with the equally complicated\r\nproblem, regarding conditions of which we know little or nothing, on the\r\nother side of the globe.\r\n\r\nFifth—We ought not to interfere, unless we come with clean hands. We\r\nhave an even closer parallel to Congo conditions than our negro problem\r\nin the South. In the Philippines we found a people to be elevated; an\r\ninscrutable Providence—so we say—thrust the Philippine Islands, with\r\ntheir millions, upon us. A few years ago we heard much of benevolent\r\nassimilation. Benevolent assimilation is the most dreadful of all forms\r\nof cannibalism. Our Congo reformers emphasize the fact that the Congo\r\nState was founded with many philanthropic assertions and with\r\nhigh-sounding promises of improving and elevating the native population.\r\nThe parallel is close. We took the Philippines and Filipinos for their\r\ngood. So we said. Of course, we took them just as the European nations\r\nhave taken Africa—for exploitation. Had there been no hope of mines, of\r\ntimber, of cheap land for speculation, of railroads to be built, and\r\nother enterprises to be undertaken and financed, we should never have\r\nhad such a tender interest in the advancement of the Filipinos. And how\r\nhas our benevolent assimilation proceeded? Just exactly as it always\r\nproceeds everywhere in tropic lands with “lower peoples.” Torture,\r\npunitive expeditions, betrayal of confidence and friendship,\r\ndepopulation—these have been the agencies through which we have\r\nattempted to elevate a race.\r\n\r\nYou will tell me that what I am about to quote is ancient history and\r\nhas lost its force. It is no more ancient than the bulk of the\r\natrocities and cruelties within the Congo. We quote a newspaper of April\r\n12, 1902:\r\n\r\n“From the Philippines authentic news is now at hand tending to confirm\r\nthe charges of barbarity on the part of American army officers, which\r\nhave hitherto been strenuously and sweepingly denied. This news comes in\r\nAssociated Press dispatches reporting the court-martial trial of Major\r\nWaller, now in progress at Manila. This officer led an expedition last\r\nwinter into the interior of the island of Samar. After being given up\r\nfor dead, he and his party returned to camp January 28th, delirious from\r\nprivation. Major Waller was next heard of in this connection in a\r\ndispatch of March 6th from Manila. He had been subjected to\r\ncourt-martial proceedings, on charges of having, while on this ill-fated\r\nexpedition, executed natives of the island of Samar without trial. One\r\nof the specifications alleged that in one instance the accused had\r\ncaused a native to be tied to a tree, and on one day to be shot in the\r\nthigh, on the next in the arm, on the third in the body, and on the\r\nfourth to be killed. Friends of Major Waller attributed his horrible\r\naction to delirium caused by privation; but Major Waller himself refused\r\nto make this defense, insisting that he had acted under superior\r\nauthority.”\r\n\r\nThis sounds like an indictment of the Belgians in the Congo put forth by\r\nthe Congo Reform Association. It is revolting; it is horrible; it\r\nprobably is true. Personally, I believe that Major Waller must have\r\nsuffered from the physical, the mental, the moral disintegration which\r\nthe tropics so constantly produce in white men. It is unlikely that he\r\nwas by nature a man of exceptional cruelty. He became what he\r\nwas—either permanently or for a time—through the environment in which\r\nhe lived. He had excuse; so have the Belgians. There is another respect\r\nin which this quotation sounds Congo-like. Major Waller insisted that he\r\nhad “acted under superior authority.”\r\n\r\nThis phrase, he “acted under superior authority,” is constantly harped\r\nupon by Morel and others of the Congo agitators. Much is made of it, and\r\nwe are constantly asked to trace home the order which issued from\r\nsuperior authority From whom came Major Waller’s orders? In his trial,\r\nFebruary 8th, 1902, he disclosed the startling nature of General Smith’s\r\norders, as he had understood them. He swore that General Smith had said:\r\n“I wish you to kill and burn. The more you kill, the more you will\r\nplease me. The interior of Samar must be made a howling wilderness. Kill\r\nevery native over ten years old.”\r\n\r\nWhen serious complaints of maladministration are brought before the\r\nBelgian authorities of the Congo, investigation and trial are usually\r\nordered. The Congo agitators lay great stress upon the fact that in the\r\nCongo these trials are farces; that the accused is rarely sentenced to\r\npunishment; that sometimes after his acquittal he is lionized, made a\r\nhero of, advanced in office. This is an unpardonable crime when\r\ncommitted by the Belgians. Lothaire—and really Lothaire was as bad as\r\nany—was thus treated. One would imagine from the chorus of complaint\r\nalong this line that every English or American officer accused of\r\ncruelty, misgovernment or maladministration was promptly and severely\r\npunished.\r\n\r\nMajor Waller received the verdict that he had acted “in accordance with\r\nthe rules of war, the orders of his superior, and the military\r\nexigencies of the situation.” This, again, can hardly be improved upon\r\nin all the cases put forward joyously by the reformers. When complaint\r\nis made it is never treated honestly. There is always whitewashing. Why\r\nhowl over Belgian failure to punish? Waller’s verdict shows that we do\r\nprecisely the same thing in the same circumstances. But look at what was\r\ndone with General Smith, the man who ordered that down to ten years of\r\nage the natives should be killed. He, too, was ordered to undergo\r\ncourt-martial. From a newspaper of May 3d, 1902, we quote: “At the\r\nopening, Colonel Woodruff announced his willingness to simplify the\r\nproceedings by admitting that most of the accusations were true. He said\r\nhe was willing, in behalf of General Smith, to admit that inasmuch as\r\nthe country was hostile, General Smith did not want any prisoners, and\r\nthat he had issued orders to Major Waller to kill all persons capable of\r\nbearing arms, fixing the age limit at ten years, because many boys of\r\nthat age had borne arms against the American troops, and that he had\r\nordered Major Waller also to burn the homes of the people and to make\r\nSamar a howling wilderness.”\r\n\r\nWhat was done with General Smith? His court-martial began on April 25.\r\nIts result was, of course, a whitewash; it always is, whether the person\r\ntried is American, French, German, or Belgian. It is curious, however,\r\nto observe how others were affected by this case. There was one man who\r\nknew better than any other all the facts relating to the Philippines.\r\nHis utterance, which we shall quote, was expressed, indeed, before this\r\ntrial, but it was expressed with full knowledge of similar facts. That\r\nman, on March 5th, made the assertion: “It is not the fact that the\r\nwarfare in the Philippines has been conducted with marked severity; on\r\nthe contrary, the warfare has been conducted with marked humanity and\r\nmagnanimity on the part of the United States army.” What a pity that we\r\nare less ready to talk of marked humanity and magnanimity of others! Can\r\nWaller’s crime be surpassed by anything from Congo; can any order be\r\nmore cruel than General Smith’s?\r\n\r\nI have said that this would be called ancient history. At Leopoldville I\r\nasked about atrocities; the response was that at present there was\r\nnothing serious to complain of in that region beyond the kwanga tax;\r\nwhen I reached Ikoko, where undoubtedly many cruel things have taken\r\nplace, they told me that at present such things did not occur there,\r\nthat to find them I must go to the A. B. I. R.; that the fish tax was\r\ntoo heavy, but that of cruelties, atrocities and mutilations there had\r\nbeen none for years. At Bolobo I heard precisely the same story—the\r\nmost frightful things had taken place at Lake Leopold II.—that recently\r\nnothing serious had happened at Bolobo itself. I presume that there are\r\noutrages and cruelties of recent date in the A. B. I. R. and the Antwerp\r\nConcession. But here, again, the parallel between the Congo and the\r\nPhilippines is close. While the Waller and Smith incident is ancient,\r\nthere is plenty doing at the present time. We quote a paper August 18,\r\n1906: “The Pulajanes—wild tribesmen of the Philippine island of\r\nLeyte—continue their fighting. Five Americans, including a lieutenant\r\nand a surgeon, were killed in a hand-to-hand encounter in the town of\r\nBurauen on the 9th. It was reported on the 14th that Governor-General\r\nIde has determined to exterminate the Pulajanes, even if it should take\r\nevery American soldier on the islands to do it.”\r\n\r\nThis sounds like depopulation. And why is depopulation worse in Africa\r\nthan in the Philippines? Why should a President who views the latter\r\nwith complacency—and I may say with commendation—feel so keenly with\r\nreference to the former? A special message of commendation was promptly\r\nsent to an American leader for his killing of hundreds of men, women,\r\nand children; depopulation on a large scale and of the same kind as he\r\nreprobates when done by Leopold’s soldiers. Our friends of the Congo\r\nReform Association are strangely silent in regard to such letters of\r\ncommendation; they are much grieved because Lothaire was lionized, but\r\nthey hurrah over the accumulating honors of a Funston.\r\n\r\nWhen our hands are clean and when we have given the Filipinos their\r\nwell-deserved independence and free government, and left them to work\r\nout their own salvation, then and not till then, should we intervene in\r\nthe Congo Free State for reasons of humanity. I say when we have left\r\nthe Filipinos to work out their own salvation; we have strange ideas\r\nregarding the kindnesses we do to other peoples. Thus Cuba is supposed\r\nto be under an eternal debt of obligation to us for the government which\r\nwe set up in that unhappy land. We devised a model government, according\r\nto our own ideas; to be sure, it is a government so expensive to keep up\r\nthat few, if any, portions of the United States with the population of\r\nCuba could possibly support it. We put in sanitary improvements,\r\nnominally for the benefit of Cubans, but actually with a shrewd\r\nafterthought for ourselves, which we demanded should be maintained at\r\nany price. Of course, it is impossible for a country with the population\r\nand resources of Cuba to maintain them. This will give us repeated\r\nopportunities for interference in the affairs of the island,\r\ninterference which ultimately may weary the people into assent to\r\nuniting with us. They will lose both independence and happiness, and we\r\nwill gain an added problem; and the only persons profited will be those\r\nwho are, and will be, exploiting the island for their selfish ends.\r\n\r\nSo, in the Philippines, we will develop a government which,\r\ntheoretically, may seem perfect. The difficulty is that it must be much\r\nless suitable for Filipinos than a less perfect government, planned and\r\ncarried out along lines of their own ideas. Lately a Filipino in this\r\ncountry has said something which has the ring of truth. “We have money\r\nenough to maintain a better and less expensive government than that\r\ncostly one which is trying to make the people what the government wants\r\nthem to be, and not to make itself what the people want and expect,\r\ndictating laws one day which next day are canceled and changed in a\r\nthousand places and in a thousand ways, so that justice is converted\r\ninto a mere babel. Believe me, dear sir, that even our ephemeral\r\ngovernment at Malolos showed no such incapacity. This is due to the fact\r\nthat he who governs the house does not belong to the house, and\r\neverybody knows the old Spanish proverb, ‘The fool is wiser in his own\r\nhouse than the wise man in his neighbor’s.’”\r\n\r\nIf it is necessary for us as a nation to look for African adventure; if\r\nto give a strenuous President the feeling that he is “doing something”\r\nwe must meddle in the affairs of the Dark Continent, there is a district\r\nwhere we might intervene with more of reason, and consistency, and grace\r\nthan we are doing by going to the Congo. We once established on African\r\nsoil, whether wisely or not I do not intend to discuss, a free republic\r\nfor the blacks. In Liberia we have an American enterprise, pure and\r\nsimple. It has not been a great success. It is just possible—though I\r\ndoubt it—that Liberia would at several times have profited and been\r\nadvantaged by our instruction and interest. But it seems to possess\r\nlittle interest for us. Just now, like the Congo, it is attracting\r\nBritish attention. Whether it has large or little value, whether it\r\npossesses great opportunities or not, it is now a center of interest to\r\nGreat Britain. She does not need our help in pulling chestnuts from the\r\nfire there, and there has been strange silence and ignorance in this\r\ncountry regarding it as a new sphere for English influence. If we assist\r\nEngland in expanding her African possessions at the expense of the Congo\r\nFree State, Liberia will be the next fraction of Africa to succumb to\r\nEnglish rule. England’s methods of procedure are various. It might be a\r\nuseful lesson for our statesmen and politicians to study Liberia’s\r\nprospects with care. We are still young in the business of grabbing\r\nother people’s lands. England could teach us many lessons. The latest\r\none may well be worthy our attention, since, in a certain sense, it\r\ndeals with a district where we naturally possess an interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     PRINTED BY R.
