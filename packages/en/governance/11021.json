RICHARDSON\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Buchanan\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1857, to March 4, 1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Buchanan\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Buchanan was born near Mercersburg, Pa., April 23, 1791. His\r\nfather, James Buchanan, a Scotch-Irish farmer, came from the county of\r\nDonegal, Ireland, in 1783. His mother was Elizabeth Speer. The future\r\nPresident was educated at a school in Mercersburg and at Dickinson\r\nCollege, Pennsylvania, where he was graduated in 1809. Began to practice\r\nlaw in Lancaster in 1812. His first public address was made at the age\r\nof 23 on the occasion of a popular meeting in Lancaster after the\r\ncapture of Washington by the British in 1814. Although a Federalist and\r\nwith his party opposed to the war, he urged the enlistment of volunteers\r\nfor the defense of Baltimore, and was among the first to enroll his\r\nname. In October, 1814, was elected to the legislature of Pennsylvania\r\nfor Lancaster County, and again elected in 1815. At the close of his\r\nterm in the legislature retired to the practice of the law, gaining\r\nearly distinction. In 1820 was elected to Congress to represent a\r\ndistrict composed of Lancaster, York, and Dauphin counties, and took\r\nhis seat in December, 1821. He was called a Federalist, but the party\r\ndistinctions of that time were not clearly defined, and Mr. Buchanan's\r\npolitical principles as a national statesman were yet to be formed.\r\nHis first speech in Congress was made in January, 1822, sustaining the\r\nAdministration of President Monroe, and of John C. Calhoun, Secretary\r\nof War, in particular, with reference to a military establishment.\r\nPresident Monroe's veto, in May, 1822, of a bill imposing tolls for\r\nthe support of the Cumberland road, for which Mr. Buchanan had voted,\r\nproduced a strong effect upon his constitutional views, and he began to\r\nperceive the dividing line between the Federal and the State powers. He\r\nremained in the House of Representatives ten years--during Mr. Monroe's\r\nsecond term, through the Administration of John Quincy Adams, and during\r\nthe first two years of Jackson's Administration. In December, 1829,\r\nbecame chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the House. During Mr.\r\nAdams's term the friends of the Administration began to take the name\r\nof National Republicans, while the opposing party assumed the name of\r\nDemocrats. Mr. Buchanan was one of the leaders of the opposition in\r\nthe House of Representatives. Was always a strong supporter and warm\r\npersonal friend of General Jackson. In March 1831, at the close of the\r\nTwenty-first Congress, it was Mr. Buchanan's wish to retire from public\r\nlife, but at the request of President Jackson he accepted the mission\r\nto Russia; negotiated a commercial treaty with that country. August 8,\r\n1833, left St. Petersburg, spent a short time in Paris and London, and\r\nreached home in November. In 1834 was appointed one of the commissioners\r\non the part of Pennsylvania to arrange with commissioners from New\r\nJersey concerning the use of the waters of the Delaware River. December\r\n6, 1834, was elected to the United States Senate to fill a vacancy, and\r\nwas reelected in January, 1837. Was conspicuous in the Senate as a\r\nsupporter of Jackson's financial policy throughout his Administration\r\nand that of his successor, Mr. Van Buren, of the same party. In 1839\r\ndeclined the office of Attorney-General, tendered by President Van\r\nBuren. In 1843 was elected to the Senate for a third term, and in 1844\r\nhis name was brought forward as the Democratic candidate of Pennsylvania\r\nfor the Presidential nomination, but before the national convention met\r\nhe withdrew his name. At the beginning of the Administration of James\r\nK. Polk became Secretary of State, and as such had a number of important\r\nquestions to deal with, including the settlement of the boundary between\r\nOregon Territory and the British possessions and the annexation of\r\nTexas, which resulted in the Mexican War. On the accession of Mr. Taylor\r\nto the Presidency Mr. Buchanan retired for a time from official life.\r\nWas an unsuccessful candidate for the Presidential nomination before\r\nthe Democratic national convention June 1, 1852. In April, 1853, was\r\nappointed minister to England by President Pierce; was recalled at his\r\nown request in 1855. June 3, 1856, was nominated for President of the\r\nUnited States by the Democratic national convention at Cincinnati, Ohio,\r\nand on November 4, 1856, was elected, receiving 174 electoral votes to\r\n114 for John C. Fremont and 8 for Millard Fillmore. Was inaugurated\r\nMarch 4, 1857. In 1860 refused the use of his name for renomination.\r\nAt the conclusion of his term returned to his home at Wheatland, near\r\nLancaster, Pa. Died June 1, 1868, and was buried at Wheatland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nFELLOW-CITIZENS: I appear before you this day to take the solemn oath\r\n\"that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United\r\nStates and will to the best of my ability preserve, protect, and defend\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn entering upon this great office I must humbly invoke the God of our\r\nfathers for wisdom and firmness to execute its high and responsible\r\nduties in such a manner as to restore harmony and ancient friendship\r\namong the people of the several States and to preserve our free\r\ninstitutions throughout many generations. Convinced that I owe my\r\nelection to the inherent love for the Constitution and the Union which\r\nstill animates the hearts of the American people, let me earnestly ask\r\ntheir powerful support in sustaining all just measures calculated to\r\nperpetuate these, the richest political blessings which Heaven has ever\r\nbestowed upon any nation. Having determined not to become a candidate\r\nfor reelection, I shall have no motive to influence my conduct in\r\nadministering the Government except the desire ably and faithfully to\r\nserve my country and to live in the grateful memory of my countrymen.\r\n\r\nWe have recently passed through a Presidential contest in which the\r\npassions of our fellow-citizens were excited to the highest degree by\r\nquestions of deep and vital importance; but when the people proclaimed\r\ntheir will the tempest at once subsided and all was calm.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the majority, speaking in the manner prescribed by the\r\nConstitution, was heard, and instant submission followed. Our own\r\ncountry could alone have exhibited so grand and striking a spectacle\r\nof the capacity of man for self-government.\r\n\r\nWhat a happy conception, then, was it for Congress to apply this simple\r\nrule, that the will of the majority shall govern, to the settlement of\r\nthe question of domestic slavery in the Territories! Congress is neither\r\n\"to legislate slavery into any Territory or State nor to exclude it\r\ntherefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and\r\nregulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nAs a natural consequence, Congress has also prescribed that when the\r\nTerritory of Kansas shall be admitted as a State it \"shall be received\r\ninto the Union with or without slavery, as their constitution may\r\nprescribe at the time of their admission.\"\r\n\r\nA difference of opinion has arisen in regard to the point of time when\r\nthe people of a Territory shall decide this question for themselves.\r\n\r\nThis is, happily, a matter of but little practical importance. Besides,\r\nit is a judicial question, which legitimately belongs to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States, before whom it is now pending, and will, it\r\nis understood, be speedily and finally settled. To their decision, in\r\ncommon with all good citizens, I shall cheerfully submit, whatever this\r\nmay be, though it has ever been my individual opinion that under the\r\nNebraska-Kansas act the appropriate period will be when the number of\r\nactual residents in the Territory shall justify the formation of a\r\nconstitution with a view to its admission as a State into the Union.\r\nBut be this as it may, it is the imperative and indispensable duty\r\nof the Government of the United States to secure to every resident\r\ninhabitant the free and independent expression of his opinion by his\r\nvote. This sacred right of each individual must be preserved. That\r\nbeing accomplished, nothing can be fairer than to leave the people of a\r\nTerritory free from all foreign interference to decide their own destiny\r\nfor themselves, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe whole Territorial question being thus settled upon the principle\r\nof popular sovereignty--a principle as ancient as free government\r\nitself--everything of a practical nature has been decided. No other\r\nquestion remains for adjustment, because all agree that under the\r\nConstitution slavery in the States is beyond the reach of any human\r\npower except that of the respective States themselves wherein it exists.\r\nMay we not, then, hope that the long agitation on this subject is\r\napproaching its end, and that the geographical parties to which it has\r\ngiven birth, so much dreaded by the Father of his Country, will speedily\r\nbecome extinct? Most happy will it be for the country when the public\r\nmind shall be diverted from this question to others of more pressing and\r\npractical importance. Throughout the whole progress of this agitation,\r\nwhich has scarcely known any intermission for more than twenty years,\r\nwhilst it has been productive of no positive good to any human being it\r\nhas been the prolific source of great evils to the master, to the slave,\r\nand to the whole country. It has alienated and estranged the people of\r\nthe sister States from each other, and has even seriously endangered the\r\nvery existence of the Union. Nor has the danger yet entirely ceased.\r\nUnder our system there is a remedy for all mere political evils in\r\nthe sound sense and sober judgment of the people. Time is a great\r\ncorrective. Political subjects which but a few years ago excited and\r\nexasperated the public mind have passed away and are now nearly\r\nforgotten. But this question of domestic slavery is of far graver\r\nimportance than any mere political question, because should the\r\nagitation continue it may eventually endanger the personal safety of a\r\nlarge portion of our countrymen where the institution exists. In that\r\nevent no form of government, however admirable in itself and however\r\nproductive of material benefits, can compensate for the loss of peace\r\nand domestic security around the family altar. Let every Union-loving\r\nman, therefore, exert his best influence to suppress this agitation,\r\nwhich since the recent legislation of Congress is without any legitimate\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nIt is an evil omen of the times that men have undertaken to calculate\r\nthe mere material value of the Union. Reasoned estimates have been\r\npresented of the pecuniary profits and local advantages which would\r\nresult to different States and sections from its dissolution and of the\r\ncomparative injuries which such an event would inflict on other States\r\nand sections. Even descending to this low and narrow view of the mighty\r\nquestion, all such calculations are at fault. The bare reference to a\r\nsingle consideration will be conclusive on this point. We at present\r\nenjoy a free trade throughout our extensive and expanding country such\r\nas the world has never witnessed. This trade is conducted on railroads\r\nand canals, on noble rivers and arms of the sea, which bind together\r\nthe North and the South, the East and the West, of our Confederacy.\r\nAnnihilate this trade, arrest its free progress by the geographical\r\nlines of jealous and hostile States, and you destroy the prosperity and\r\nonward march of the whole and every part and involve all in one common\r\nruin. But such considerations, important as they are in themselves, sink\r\ninto insignificance when we reflect on the terrific evils which would\r\nresult from disunion to every portion of the Confederacy--to the North\r\nnot more than to the South, to the East not more than to the West. These\r\nI shall not attempt to portray, because I feel an humble confidence that\r\nthe kind Providence which inspired our fathers with wisdom to frame the\r\nmost perfect form of government and union ever devised by man will not\r\nsuffer it to perish until it shall have been peacefully instrumental by\r\nits example in the extension of civil and religious liberty throughout\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the maintenance of the Constitution and the Union\r\nis the duty of preserving the Government free from the taint or even the\r\nsuspicion of corruption. Public virtue is the vital spirit of republics,\r\nand history proves that when this has decayed and the love of money has\r\nusurped its place, although the forms of free government may remain for\r\na season, the substance has departed forever.\r\n\r\nOur present financial condition is without a parallel in history.\r\nNo nation has ever before been embarrassed from too large a surplus\r\nin its treasury. This almost necessarily gives birth to extravagant\r\nlegislation. It produces wild schemes of expenditure and begets a race\r\nof speculators and jobbers, whose ingenuity is exerted in contriving and\r\npromoting expedients to obtain public money. The purity of official\r\nagents, whether rightfully or wrongfully, is suspected, and the\r\ncharacter of the government suffers in the estimation of the people.\r\nThis is in itself a very great evil.\r\n\r\nThe natural mode of relief from this embarrassment is to appropriate the\r\nsurplus in the Treasury to great national objects for which a clear\r\nwarrant can be found in the Constitution. Among these I might mention\r\nthe extinguishment of the public debt, a reasonable increase of the\r\nNavy, which is at present inadequate to the protection of our vast\r\ntonnage afloat, now greater than that of any other nation, as well as\r\nto the defense of our extended seacoast.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond all question the true principle that no more revenue ought\r\nto be collected from the people than the amount necessary to defray\r\nthe expenses of a wise, economical, and efficient administration of\r\nthe Government. To reach this point it was necessary to resort to a\r\nmodification of the tariff, and this has, I trust, been accomplished in\r\nsuch a manner as to do as little injury as may have been practicable to\r\nour domestic manufactures, especially those necessary for the defense\r\nof the country. Any discrimination against a particular branch for the\r\npurpose of benefiting favored corporations, individuals, or interests\r\nwould have been unjust to the rest of the community and inconsistent\r\nwith that spirit of fairness and equality which ought to govern in the\r\nadjustment of a revenue tariff.\r\n\r\nBut the squandering of the public money sinks into comparative\r\ninsignificance as a temptation to corruption when compared with the\r\nsquandering of the public lands.\r\n\r\nNo nation in the tide of time has ever been blessed with so rich and\r\nnoble an inheritance as we enjoy in the public lands. In administering\r\nthis important trust, whilst it may be wise to grant portions of them\r\nfor the improvement of the remainder, yet we should never forget that it\r\nis our cardinal policy to reserve these lands, as much as may be, for\r\nactual settlers, and this at moderate prices. We shall thus not only\r\nbest promote the prosperity of the new States and Territories, by\r\nfurnishing them a hardy and independent race of honest and industrious\r\ncitizens, but shall secure homes for our children and our children's\r\nchildren, as well as for those exiles from foreign shores who may seek\r\nin this country to improve their condition and to enjoy the blessings of\r\ncivil and religious liberty. Such emigrants have done much to promote\r\nthe growth and prosperity of the country. They have proved faithful both\r\nin peace and in war. After becoming citizens they are entitled, under\r\nthe Constitution and laws, to be placed on a perfect equality with\r\nnative-born citizens, and in this character they should ever be kindly\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Constitution is a grant from the States to Congress of\r\ncertain specific powers, and the question whether this grant should be\r\nliberally or strictly construed has more or less divided political\r\nparties from the beginning. Without entering into the argument, I desire\r\nto state at the commencement of my Administration that long experience\r\nand observation have convinced me that a strict construction of the\r\npowers of the Government is the only true, as well as the only safe,\r\ntheory of the Constitution. Whenever in our past history doubtful powers\r\nhave been exercised by Congress, these have never failed to produce\r\ninjurious and unhappy consequences. Many such instances might be adduced\r\nif this were the proper occasion. Neither is it necessary for the public\r\nservice to strain the language of the Constitution, because all the\r\ngreat and useful powers required for a successful administration of\r\nthe Government, both in peace and in war, have been granted, either\r\nin express terms or by the plainest implication.\r\n\r\nWhilst deeply convinced of these truths, I yet consider it clear that\r\nunder the war-making power Congress may appropriate money toward the\r\nconstruction of a military road when this is absolutely necessary for\r\nthe defense of any State or Territory of the Union against foreign\r\ninvasion. Under the Constitution Congress has power \"to declare war,\"\r\n\"to raise and support armies,\" \"to provide and maintain a navy,\" and to\r\ncall forth the militia to \"repel invasions.\" Thus endowed, in an ample\r\nmanner, with the war-making power, the corresponding duty is required\r\nthat \"the United States shall protect each of them [the States] against\r\ninvasion.\" Now, how is it possible to afford this protection to\r\nCalifornia and our Pacific possessions except by means of a military\r\nroad through the Territories of the United States, over which men and\r\nmunitions of war may be speedily transported from the Atlantic States to\r\nmeet and to repel the invader? In the event of a war with a naval power\r\nmuch stronger than our own we should then have no other available\r\naccess to the Pacific Coast, because such a power would instantly close\r\nthe route across the isthmus of Central America. It is impossible to\r\nconceive that whilst the Constitution has expressly required Congress\r\nto defend all the States it should yet deny to them, by any fair\r\nconstruction, the only possible means by which one of these States can\r\nbe defended. Besides, the Government, ever since its origin, has been in\r\nthe constant practice of constructing military roads. It might also be\r\nwise to consider whether the love for the Union which now animates our\r\nfellow-citizens on the Pacific Coast may not be impaired by our neglect\r\nor refusal to provide for them, in their remote and isolated condition,\r\nthe only means by which the power of the States on this side of the\r\nRocky Mountains can reach them in sufficient time to \"protect\" them\r\n\"against invasion.\" I forbear for the present from expressing an opinion\r\nas to the wisest and most economical mode in which the Government can\r\nlend its aid in accomplishing this great and necessary work. I believe\r\nthat many of the difficulties in the way, which now appear formidable,\r\nwill in a great degree vanish as soon as the nearest and best route\r\nshall have been satisfactorily ascertained.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper that on this occasion I should make some brief remarks\r\nin regard to our rights and duties as a member of the great family of\r\nnations. In our intercourse with them there are some plain principles,\r\napproved by our own experience, from which we should never depart. We\r\nought to cultivate peace, commerce, and friendship with all nations,\r\nand this not merely as the best means of promoting our own material\r\ninterests, but in a spirit of Christian benevolence toward our\r\nfellow-men, wherever their lot may be cast. Our diplomacy should be\r\ndirect and frank, neither seeking to obtain more nor accepting less than\r\nis our due. We ought to cherish a sacred regard for the independence of\r\nall nations, and never attempt to interfere in the domestic concerns\r\nof any unless this shall be imperatively required by the great law of\r\nself-preservation. To avoid entangling alliances has been a maxim of our\r\npolicy ever since the days of Washington, and its wisdom no one will\r\nattempt to dispute. In short, we ought to do justice in a kindly spirit\r\nto all nations and require justice from them in return.\r\n\r\nIt is our glory that whilst other nations have extended their dominions\r\nby the sword we have never acquired any territory except by fair\r\npurchase or, as in the case of Texas, by the voluntary determination of\r\na brave, kindred, and independent people to blend their destinies with\r\nour own. Even our acquisitions from Mexico form no exception. Unwilling\r\nto take advantage of the fortune of war against a sister republic, we\r\npurchased these possessions under the treaty of peace for a sum which\r\nwas considered at the time a fair equivalent. Our past history forbids\r\nthat we shall in the future acquire territory unless this be sanctioned\r\nby the laws of justice and honor. Acting on this principle, no nation\r\nwill have a right to interfere or to complain if in the progress of\r\nevents we shall still further extend our possessions. Hitherto in all\r\nour acquisitions the people, under the protection of the American flag,\r\nhave enjoyed civil and religious liberty, as well as equal and just\r\nlaws, and have been contented, prosperous, and happy. Their trade with\r\nthe rest of the world has rapidly increased, and thus every commercial\r\nnation has shared largely in their successful progress.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to take the oath prescribed by the Constitution,\r\nwhilst humbly invoking the blessing of Divine Providence on this great\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMARCH 4, 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1857_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn obedience to the command of the Constitution, it has now become my\r\nduty \"to give to Congress information of the state of the Union and\r\nrecommend to their consideration such measures\" as I judge to be\r\n\"necessary and expedient.\"\r\n\r\nBut first and above all, our thanks are due to Almighty God for the\r\nnumerous benefits which He has bestowed upon this people, and our united\r\nprayers ought to ascend to Him that He would continue to bless our great\r\nRepublic in time to come as He has blessed it in time past. Since the\r\nadjournment of the last Congress our constituents have enjoyed an\r\nunusual degree of health. The earth has yielded her fruits abundantly\r\nand has bountifully rewarded the toil of the husbandman. Our great\r\nstaples have commanded high prices, and up till within a brief period\r\nour manufacturing, mineral, and mechanical occupations have largely\r\npartaken of the general prosperity. We have possessed all the elements\r\nof material wealth in rich abundance, and yet, notwithstanding all these\r\nadvantages, our country in its monetary interests is at the present\r\nmoment in a deplorable condition. In the midst of unsurpassed plenty in\r\nall the productions of agriculture and in all the elements of national\r\nwealth, we find our manufactures suspended, our public works retarded,\r\nour private enterprises of different kinds abandoned, and thousands\r\nof useful laborers thrown out of employment and reduced to want. The\r\nrevenue of the Government, which is chiefly derived from duties on\r\nimports from abroad, has been greatly reduced, whilst the appropriations\r\nmade by Congress at its last session for the current fiscal year are\r\nvery large in amount.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances a loan may be required before the close of\r\nyour present session; but this, although deeply to be regretted, would\r\nprove to be only a slight misfortune when compared with the suffering\r\nand distress prevailing among the people. With this the Government can\r\nnot fail deeply to sympathize, though it may be without the power to\r\nextend relief.\r\n\r\nIt is our duty to inquire what has produced such unfortunate results and\r\nwhether their recurrence can be prevented. In all former revulsions the\r\nblame might have been fairly attributed to a variety of cooperating\r\ncauses, but not so upon the present occasion. It is apparent that our\r\nexisting misfortunes have proceeded solely from our extravagant and\r\nvicious system of paper currency and bank credits, exciting the people\r\nto wild speculations and gambling in stocks. These revulsions must\r\ncontinue to recur at successive intervals so long as the amount of the\r\npaper currency and bank loans and discounts of the country shall be left\r\nto the discretion of 1,400 irresponsible banking institutions, which\r\nfrom the very law of their nature will consult the interest of their\r\nstockholders rather than the public welfare.\r\n\r\nThe framers of the Constitution, when they gave to Congress the power\r\n\"to coin money and to regulate the value thereof\" and prohibited the\r\nStates from coining money, emitting bills of credit, or making anything\r\nbut gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, supposed they had\r\nprotected the people against the evils of an excessive and irredeemable\r\npaper currency. They are not responsible for the existing anomaly that\r\na Government endowed with the sovereign attribute of coining money and\r\nregulating the value thereof should have no power to prevent others\r\nfrom driving this coin out of the country and filling up the channels\r\nof circulation with paper which does not represent gold and silver.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the highest and most responsible duties of Government to\r\ninsure to the people a sound circulating medium, the amount of which\r\nought to be adapted with the utmost possible wisdom and skill to the\r\nwants of internal trade and foreign exchanges. If this be either greatly\r\nabove or greatly below the proper standard, the marketable value of\r\nevery man's property is increased or diminished in the same proportion,\r\nand injustice to individuals as well as incalculable evils to the\r\ncommunity are the consequence.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, under the construction of the Federal Constitution\r\nwhich has now prevailed too long to be changed this important and\r\ndelicate duty has been dissevered from the coining power and virtually\r\ntransferred to more than 1,400 State banks acting independently of each\r\nother and regulating their paper issues almost exclusively by a regard\r\nto the present interest of their stockholders. Exercising the sovereign\r\npower of providing a paper currency instead of coin for the country,\r\nthe first duty which these banks owe to the public is to keep in\r\ntheir vaults a sufficient amount of gold and silver to insure the\r\nconvertibility of their notes into coin at all times and under all\r\ncircumstances. No bank ought ever to be chartered without such\r\nrestrictions on its business as to secure this result. All other\r\nrestrictions are comparatively vain. This is the only true touchstone,\r\nthe only efficient regulator of a paper currency--the only one which\r\ncan guard the public against overissues and bank suspensions. As a\r\ncollateral and eventual security, it is doubtless wise, and in all cases\r\nought to be required, that banks shall hold an amount of United States\r\nor State securities equal to their notes in circulation and pledged for\r\ntheir redemption. This, however, furnishes no adequate security against\r\noverissues. On the contrary, it may be perverted to inflate the\r\ncurrency. Indeed, it is possible by this means to convert all the debts\r\nof the United States and State Governments into bank notes, without\r\nreference to the specie required to redeem them. However valuable these\r\nsecurities may be in themselves, they can not be converted into gold\r\nand silver at the moment of pressure, as our experience teaches, in\r\nsufficient time to prevent bank suspensions and the depreciation of\r\nbank notes. In England, which is to a considerable extent a paper-money\r\ncountry, though vastly behind our own in this respect, it was deemed\r\nadvisable, anterior to the act of Parliament of 1844, which wisely\r\nseparated the issue of notes from the banking department, for the Bank\r\nof England always to keep on hand gold and silver equal to one-third of\r\nits combined circulation and deposits. If this proportion was no more\r\nthan sufficient to secure the convertibility of its notes with the whole\r\nof Great Britain and to some extent the continent of Europe as a field\r\nfor its circulation, rendering it almost impossible that a sudden and\r\nimmediate run to a dangerous amount should be made upon it, the same\r\nproportion would certainly be insufficient under our banking system.\r\nEach of our 1,400 banks has but a limited circumference for its\r\ncirculation, and in the course of a very few days the depositors and\r\nnote holders might demand from such a bank a sufficient amount in specie\r\nto compel it to suspend, even although it had coin in its vaults equal\r\nto one-third of its immediate liabilities. And yet I am not aware, with\r\nthe exception of the banks of Louisiana, that any State bank throughout\r\nthe Union has been required by its charter to keep this or any other\r\nproportion of gold and silver compared with the amount of its combined\r\ncirculation and deposits. What has been the consequence? In a recent\r\nreport made by the Treasury Department on the condition of the banks\r\nthroughout the different States, according to returns dated nearest to\r\nJanuary, 1857, the aggregate amount of actual specie in their vaults is\r\n$58,349,838, of their circulation $214,778,822, and of their deposits\r\n$230,351,352. Thus it appears that these banks in the aggregate have\r\nconsiderably less than one dollar in seven of gold and silver compared\r\nwith their circulation and deposits. It was palpable, therefore, that\r\nthe very first pressure must drive them to suspension and deprive the\r\npeople of a convertible currency, with all its disastrous consequences.\r\nIt is truly wonderful that they should have so long continued to\r\npreserve their credit when a demand for the payment of one-seventh of\r\ntheir immediate liabilities would have driven them into insolvency. And\r\nthis is the condition of the banks, notwithstanding that four hundred\r\nmillions of gold from California have flowed in upon us within the last\r\neight years, and the tide still continues to flow. Indeed, such has been\r\nthe extravagance of bank credits that the banks now hold a considerably\r\nless amount of specie, either in proportion to their capital or to their\r\ncirculation and deposits combined, than they did before the discovery of\r\ngold in California. Whilst in the year 1848 their specie in proportion\r\nto their capital was more than equal to one dollar for four and a half,\r\nin 1857 it does not amount to one dollar for every six dollars and\r\nthirty-three cents of their capital. In the year 1848 the specie was\r\nequal within a very small fraction to one dollar in five of their\r\ncirculation and deposits; in 1857 it is not equal to one dollar in\r\nseven and a half of their circulation and deposits.\r\n\r\nFrom this statement it is easy to account for our financial history for\r\nthe last forty years. It has been a history of extravagant expansions\r\nin the business of the country, followed by ruinous contractions. At\r\nsuccessive intervals the best and most enterprising men have been\r\ntempted to their ruin by excessive bank loans of mere paper credit,\r\nexciting them to extravagant importations of foreign goods, wild\r\nspeculations, and ruinous and demoralizing stock gambling. When the\r\ncrisis arrives, as arrive it must, the banks can extend no relief to the\r\npeople. In a vain struggle to redeem their liabilities in specie they\r\nare compelled to contract their loans and their issues, and at last,\r\nin the hour of distress, when their assistance is most needed, they and\r\ntheir debtors together sink into insolvency.\r\n\r\nIt is this paper system of extravagant expansion, raising the nominal\r\nprice of every article far beyond its real value when compared with\r\nthe cost of similar articles in countries whose circulation is wisely\r\nregulated, which has prevented us from competing in our own markets with\r\nforeign manufacturers, has produced extravagant importations, and has\r\ncounteracted the effect of the large incidental protection afforded\r\nto our domestic manufactures by the present revenue tariff. But for\r\nthis the branches of our manufactures composed of raw materials,\r\nthe production of our own country--such as cotton, iron, and woolen\r\nfabrics--would not only have acquired almost exclusive possession of\r\nthe home market, but would have created for themselves a foreign market\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\nDeplorable, however, as may be our present financial condition, we\r\nmay yet indulge in bright hopes for the future. No other nation has\r\never existed which could have endured such violent expansions and\r\ncontractions of paper credits without lasting injury; yet the buoyancy\r\nof youth, the energies of our population, and the spirit which never\r\nquails before difficulties will enable us soon to recover from our\r\npresent financial embarrassments, and may even occasion us speedily\r\nto forget the lesson which they have taught.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it is the duty of the Government, by all proper means\r\nwithin its power, to aid in alleviating the sufferings of the people\r\noccasioned by the suspension of the banks and to provide against a\r\nrecurrence of the same calamity. Unfortunately, in either aspect of the\r\ncase it can do but little. Thanks to the independent treasury, the\r\nGovernment has not suspended payment, as it was compelled to do by\r\nthe failure of the banks in 1837. It will continue to discharge its\r\nliabilities to the people in gold and silver. Its disbursements in coin\r\nwill pass into circulation and materially assist in restoring a sound\r\ncurrency. From its high credit, should we be compelled to make a\r\ntemporary loan, it can be effected on advantageous terms. This, however,\r\nshall if possible be avoided, but if not, then the amount shall be\r\nlimited to the lowest practicable sum.\r\n\r\nI have therefore determined that whilst no useful Government works\r\nalready in progress shall be suspended, new works not already commenced\r\nwill be postponed if this can be done without injury to the country.\r\nThose necessary for its defense shall proceed as though there had been\r\nno crisis in our monetary affairs.\r\n\r\nBut the Federal Government can not do much to provide against a\r\nrecurrence of existing evils. Even if insurmountable constitutional\r\nobjections did not exist against the creation of a national bank, this\r\nwould furnish no adequate preventive security. The history of the last\r\nBank of the United States abundantly proves the truth of this assertion.\r\nSuch a bank could not, if it would, regulate the issues and credits of\r\n1,400 State banks in such a manner as to prevent the ruinous expansions\r\nand contractions in our currency which afflicted the country throughout\r\nthe existence of the late bank, or secure us against future suspensions.\r\nIn 1825 an effort was made by the Bank of England to curtail the issues\r\nof the country banks under the most favorable circumstances. The paper\r\ncurrency had been expanded to a ruinous extent, and the bank put forth\r\nall its power to contract it in order to reduce prices and restore the\r\nequilibrium of the foreign exchanges. It accordingly commenced a system\r\nof curtailment of its loans and issues, in the vain hope that the joint\r\nstock and private banks of the Kingdom would be compelled to follow its\r\nexample. It found, however, that as it contracted they expanded, and at\r\nthe end of the process, to employ the language of a very high official\r\nauthority, \"whatever reduction of the paper circulation was effected by\r\nthe Bank of England (in 1825) was more than made up by the issues of the\r\ncountry banks.\"\r\n\r\nBut a bank of the United States would not, if it could, restrain the\r\nissues and loans of the State banks, because its duty as a regulator\r\nof the currency must often be in direct conflict with the immediate\r\ninterest of its stockholders. If we expect one agent to restrain or\r\ncontrol another, their interests must, at least in some degree, be\r\nantagonistic. But the directors of a bank of the United States would\r\nfeel the same interest and the same inclination with the directors of\r\nthe State banks to expand the currency, to accommodate their favorites\r\nand friends with loans, and to declare large dividends. Such has been\r\nour experience in regard to the last bank.\r\n\r\nAfter all, we must mainly rely upon the patriotism and wisdom of the\r\nStates for the prevention and redress of the evil. If they will afford\r\nus a real specie basis for our paper circulation by increasing the\r\ndenomination of bank notes, first to twenty and afterwards to fifty\r\ndollars; if they will require that the banks shall at all times keep on\r\nhand at least one dollar of gold and silver for every three dollars\r\nof their circulation and deposits, and if they will provide by a\r\nself-executing enactment, which nothing can arrest, that the moment they\r\nsuspend they shall go into liquidation, I believe that such provisions,\r\nwith a weekly publication by each bank of a statement of its condition,\r\nwould go far to secure us against future suspensions of specie payments.\r\n\r\nCongress, in my opinion, possess the power to pass a uniform bankrupt\r\nlaw applicable to all banking institutions throughout the United\r\nStates, and I strongly recommend its exercise. This would make it the\r\nirreversible organic law of each bank's existence that a suspension\r\nof specie payments shall produce its civil death. The instinct of\r\nself-preservation would then compel it to perform its duties in such\r\na manner as to escape the penalty and preserve its life.\r\n\r\nThe existence of banks and the circulation of bank paper are so\r\nidentified with the habits of our people that they can not at this day\r\nbe suddenly abolished without much immediate injury to the country.\r\nIf we could confine them to their appropriate sphere and prevent them\r\nfrom administering to the spirit of wild and reckless speculation by\r\nextravagant loans and issues, they might be continued with advantage\r\nto the public.\r\n\r\nBut this I say, after long and much reflection: If experience shall\r\nprove it to be impossible to enjoy the facilities which well-regulated\r\nbanks might afford without at the same time suffering the calamities\r\nwhich the excesses of the banks have hitherto inflicted upon the\r\ncountry, it would then be far the lesser evil to deprive them altogether\r\nof the power to issue a paper currency and confine them to the functions\r\nof banks of deposit and discount.\r\n\r\nOur relations with foreign governments are upon the whole in a\r\nsatisfactory condition.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic difficulties which existed between the Government of the\r\nUnited States and that of Great Britain at the adjournment of the last\r\nCongress have been happily terminated by the appointment of a British\r\nminister to this country, who has been cordially received.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is greatly to the interest, as I am convinced it is the\r\nsincere desire, of the Governments and people of the two countries to\r\nbe on terms of intimate friendship with each other, it has been our\r\nmisfortune almost always to have had some irritating, if not dangerous,\r\noutstanding question with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nSince the origin of the Government we have been employed in negotiating\r\ntreaties with that power, and afterwards in discussing their true intent\r\nand meaning. In this respect the convention of April 19, 1850, commonly\r\ncalled the Clayton and Bulwer treaty, has been the most unfortunate\r\nof all, because the two Governments place directly opposite and\r\ncontradictory constructions upon its first and most important article.\r\nWhilst in the United States we believed that this treaty would place\r\nboth powers upon an exact equality by the stipulation that neither will\r\never \"occupy, or fortify, or colonize, or assume, or exercise any\r\ndominion\" over any part of Central America, it is contended by the\r\nBritish Government that the true construction of this language has left\r\nthem in the rightful possession of all that portion of Central America\r\nwhich was in their occupancy at the date of the treaty; in fact, that\r\nthe treaty is a virtual recognition on the part of the United States of\r\nthe right of Great Britain, either as owner or protector, to the whole\r\nextensive coast of Central America, sweeping round from the Rio Hondo to\r\nthe port and harbor of San Juan de Nicaragua, together with the adjacent\r\nBay Islands, except the comparatively small portion of this between the\r\nSarstoon and Cape Honduras. According to their construction, the treaty\r\ndoes no more than simply prohibit them from extending their possessions\r\nin Central America beyond the present limits. It is not too much to\r\nassert that if in the United States the treaty had been considered\r\nsusceptible of such a construction it never would have been negotiated\r\nunder the authority of the President, nor would it have received the\r\napprobation of the Senate. The universal conviction in the United States\r\nwas that when our Government consented to violate its traditional and\r\ntime-honored policy and to stipulate with a foreign government never to\r\noccupy or acquire territory in the Central American portion of our own\r\ncontinent, the consideration for this sacrifice was that Great Britain\r\nshould, in this respect at least, be placed in the same position with\r\nourselves. Whilst we have no right to doubt the sincerity of the British\r\nGovernment in their construction of the treaty, it is at the same time\r\nmy deliberate conviction that this construction is in opposition both\r\nto its letter and its spirit.\r\n\r\nUnder the late Administration negotiations were instituted between\r\nthe two Governments for the purpose, if possible, of removing these\r\ndifficulties, and a treaty having this laudable object in view was\r\nsigned at London on the 17th October, 1856, and was submitted by the\r\nPresident to the Senate on the following 10th of December. Whether\r\nthis treaty, either in its original or amended form, would have\r\naccomplished the object intended without giving birth to new and\r\nembarrassing complications between the two Governments, may perhaps\r\nbe well questioned. Certain it is, however, it was rendered much less\r\nobjectionable by the different amendments made to it by the Senate. The\r\ntreaty as amended was ratified by me on the 12th March, 1857, and was\r\ntransmitted to London for ratification by the British Government. That\r\nGovernment expressed its willingness to concur in all the amendments\r\nmade by the Senate with the single exception of the clause relating to\r\nRuatan and the other islands in the Bay of Honduras. The article in the\r\noriginal treaty as submitted to the Senate, after reciting that these\r\nislands and their inhabitants \"having been, by a convention bearing date\r\nthe 27th day of August, 1856, between Her Britannic Majesty and the\r\nRepublic of Honduras, constituted and declared a free territory under\r\nthe sovereignty of the said Republic of Honduras,\" stipulated that\r\n\"the two contracting parties do hereby mutually engage to recognize\r\nand respect in all future time the independence and rights of the said\r\nfree territory as a part of the Republic of Honduras.\"\r\n\r\nUpon an examination of this convention between Great Britain and\r\nHonduras of the 27th August, 1856, it was found that whilst declaring\r\nthe Bay Islands to be \"a free territory under the sovereignty of the\r\nRepublic of Honduras\" it deprived that Republic of rights without which\r\nits sovereignty over them could scarcely be said to exist. It divided\r\nthem from the remainder of Honduras and gave to their inhabitants a\r\nseparate government of their own, with legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial officers elected by themselves. It deprived the Government of\r\nHonduras of the taxing power in every form and exempted the people of\r\nthe islands from the performance of military duty except for their\r\nown exclusive defense. It also prohibited that Republic from erecting\r\nfortifications upon them for their protection, thus leaving them open\r\nto invasion from any quarter; and, finally, it provided \"that slavery\r\nshall not at any time hereafter be permitted to exist therein.\"\r\n\r\nHad Honduras ratified this convention, she would have ratified the\r\nestablishment of a state substantially independent within her own\r\nlimits, and a state at all times subject to British influence and\r\ncontrol. Moreover, had the United States ratified the treaty with Great\r\nBritain in its original form, we should have been bound \"to recognize\r\nand respect in all future time\" these stipulations to the prejudice of\r\nHonduras. Being in direct opposition to the spirit and meaning of the\r\nClayton and Bulwer treaty as understood in the United States, the Senate\r\nrejected the entire clause, and substituted in its stead a simple\r\nrecognition of the sovereign right of Honduras to these islands in\r\nthe following language:\r\n\r\n  The two contracting parties do hereby mutually engage to recognize and\r\n  respect the islands of Ruatan, Bonaco, Utila, Barbaretta, Helena, and\r\n  Morat, situate in the Bay of Honduras and off the coast of the Republic\r\n  of Honduras, as under the sovereignty and as part of the said Republic\r\n  of Honduras.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Britain rejected this amendment, assigning as the only reason that\r\nthe ratifications of the convention of the 27th August, 1856, between\r\nher and Honduras had not been \"exchanged, owing to the hesitation of\r\nthat Government.\" Had this been done, it is stated that \"Her Majesty's\r\nGovernment would have had little difficulty in agreeing to the\r\nmodification proposed by the Senate, which then would have had in effect\r\nthe same signification as the original wording.\" Whether this would have\r\nbeen the effect, whether the mere circumstance of the exchange of the\r\nratifications of the British convention with Honduras prior in point\r\nof time to the ratification of our treaty with Great Britain would \"in\r\neffect\" have had \"the same signification as the original wording,\" and\r\nthus have nullified the amendment of the Senate, may well be doubted.\r\nIt is, perhaps, fortunate that the question has never arisen.\r\n\r\nThe British Government, immediately after rejecting the treaty as\r\namended, proposed to enter into a new treaty with the United States,\r\nsimilar in all respects to the treaty which they had just refused to\r\nratify, if the United States would consent to add to the Senate's clear\r\nand unqualified recognition of the sovereignty of Honduras over the Bay\r\nIslands the following conditional stipulation:\r\n\r\n  Whenever and so soon as the Republic of Honduras shall have concluded\r\n  and ratified a treaty with Great Britain by which Great Britain shall\r\n  have ceded and the Republic of Honduras shall have accepted the said\r\n  islands, subject to the provisions and conditions contained in such\r\n  treaty.\r\n\r\nThis proposition was, of course, rejected. After the Senate had refused\r\nto recognize the British convention with Honduras of the 27th August,\r\n1856, with full knowledge of its contents, it was impossible for me,\r\nnecessarily ignorant of \"the provisions and conditions\" which might be\r\ncontained in a future convention between the same parties, to sanction\r\nthem in advance.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that when two nations like Great Britain and the United\r\nStates, mutually desirous, as they are, and I trust ever may be,\r\nof maintaining the most friendly relations with each other, have\r\nunfortunately concluded a treaty which they understand in senses\r\ndirectly opposite, the wisest course is to abrogate such a treaty by\r\nmutual consent and to commence anew. Had this been done promptly,\r\nall difficulties in Central America would most probably ere this have\r\nbeen adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties. The time spent in\r\ndiscussing the meaning of the Clayton and Bulwer treaty would have been\r\ndevoted to this praiseworthy purpose, and the task would have been the\r\nmore easily accomplished because the interest of the two countries in\r\nCentral America is identical, being confined to securing safe transits\r\nover all the routes across the Isthmus.\r\n\r\nWhilst entertaining these sentiments, I shall, nevertheless, not refuse\r\nto contribute to any reasonable adjustment of the Central American\r\nquestions which is not practically inconsistent with the American\r\ninterpretation of the treaty. Overtures for this purpose have been\r\nrecently made by the British Government in a friendly spirit, which I\r\ncordially reciprocate, but whether this renewed effort will result in\r\nsuccess I am not yet prepared to express an opinion. A brief period will\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nWith France our ancient relations of friendship still continue to exist.\r\nThe French Government have in several recent instances, which need not\r\nbe enumerated, evinced a spirit of good will and kindness toward our\r\ncountry, which I heartily reciprocate. It is, notwithstanding, much to\r\nbe regretted that two nations whose productions are of such a character\r\nas to invite the most extensive exchanges and freest commercial\r\nintercourse should continue to enforce ancient and obsolete restrictions\r\nof trade against each other. Our commercial treaty with France is in\r\nthis respect an exception from our treaties with all other commercial\r\nnations. It jealously levies discriminating duties both on tonnage and\r\non articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of the one country when\r\narriving in vessels belonging to the other.\r\n\r\nMore than forty years ago, on the 3d March, 1815, Congress passed an act\r\noffering to all nations to admit their vessels laden with their national\r\nproductions into the ports of the United States upon the same terms\r\nwith our own vessels provided they would reciprocate to us similar\r\nadvantages. This act confined the reciprocity to the productions of\r\nthe respective foreign nations who might enter into the proposed\r\narrangement with the United States. The act of May 24, 1828, removed\r\nthis restriction and offered a similar reciprocity to all such vessels\r\nwithout reference to the origin of their cargoes. Upon these principles\r\nour commercial treaties and arrangements have been founded, except with\r\nFrance, and let us hope that this exception may not long exist.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Russia remain, as they have ever been, on the most\r\nfriendly footing. The present Emperor, as well as his predecessors, have\r\nnever failed when the occasion offered to manifest their good will to\r\nour country, and their friendship has always been highly appreciated by\r\nthe Government and people of the United States.\r\n\r\nWith all other European Governments, except that of Spain, our relations\r\nare as peaceful as we could desire. I regret to say that no progress\r\nwhatever has been made since the adjournment of Congress toward the\r\nsettlement of any of the numerous claims of our citizens against the\r\nSpanish Government. Besides, the outrage committed on our flag by the\r\nSpanish war frigate _Ferrolana_ on the high seas off the coast of\r\nCuba in March, 1855, by firing into the American mail steamer _El\r\nDorado_ and detaining and searching her, remains unacknowledged and\r\nunredressed. The general tone and temper of the Spanish Government\r\ntoward that of the United States are much to be regretted. Our present\r\nenvoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to Madrid has asked to\r\nbe recalled, and it is my purpose to send out a new minister to Spain\r\nwith special instructions on all questions pending between the two\r\nGovernments, and with a determination to have them speedily and amicably\r\nadjusted if this be possible. In the meantime, whenever our minister\r\nurges the just claims of our citizens on the notice of the Spanish\r\nGovernment he is met with the objection that Congress has never made the\r\nappropriation recommended by President Polk in his annual message of\r\nDecember, 1847, \"to be paid to the Spanish Government for the purpose of\r\ndistribution among the claimants in the _Amistad_ case.\" A similar\r\nrecommendation was made by my immediate predecessor in his message of\r\nDecember, 1853, and entirely concurring with both in the opinion that\r\nthis indemnity is justly due under the treaty with Spain of the 27th\r\nof October, 1795, I earnestly recommend such an appropriation to the\r\nfavorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nA treaty of friendship and commerce was concluded at Constantinople\r\non the 13th December, 1856, between the United States and Persia, the\r\nratifications of which were exchanged at Constantinople on the 13th\r\nJune, 1857, and the treaty was proclaimed by the President on the 18th\r\nAugust, 1857. This treaty, it is believed, will prove beneficial to\r\nAmerican commerce. The Shah has manifested an earnest disposition to\r\ncultivate friendly relations with our country, and has expressed a\r\nstrong wish that we should be represented at Teheran by a minister\r\nplenipotentiary; and I recommend that an appropriation be made for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nRecent occurrences in China have been unfavorable to a revision of the\r\ntreaty with that Empire of the 3d July, 1844, with a view to the\r\nsecurity and extension of our commerce. The twenty-fourth article of\r\nthis treaty stipulated for a revision of it in case experience should\r\nprove this to be requisite, \"in which case the two Governments will, at\r\nthe expiration of twelve years from the date of said convention, treat,\r\namicably concerning the same by means of suitable persons appointed to\r\nconduct such negotiations.\" These twelve years expired on the 3d July,\r\n1856, but long before that period it was ascertained that important\r\nchanges in the treaty were necessary, and several fruitless attempts\r\nwere made by the commissioner of the United States to effect these\r\nchanges. Another effort was about to be made for the same purpose by our\r\ncommissioner in conjunction with the ministers of England and France,\r\nbut this was suspended by the occurrence of hostilities in the Canton\r\nRiver between Great Britain and the Chinese Empire. These hostilities\r\nhave necessarily interrupted the trade of all nations with Canton, which\r\nis now in a state of blockade, and have occasioned a serious loss of\r\nlife and property. Meanwhile the insurrection within the Empire against\r\nthe existing imperial dynasty still continues, and it is difficult to\r\nanticipate what will be the result.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I have deemed it advisable to appoint a\r\ndistinguished citizen of Pennsylvania envoy extraordinary and minister\r\nplenipotentiary to proceed to China and to avail himself of any\r\nopportunities which may offer to effect changes in the existing treaty\r\nfavorable to American commerce. He left the United States for the place\r\nof his destination in July last in the war steamer _Minnesota_. Special\r\nministers to China have also been appointed by the Governments of Great\r\nBritain and France.\r\n\r\nWhilst our minister has been instructed to occupy a neutral position\r\nin reference to the existing hostilities at Canton, he will cordially\r\ncooperate with the British and French ministers in all peaceful measures\r\nto secure by treaty stipulations those just concessions to commerce\r\nwhich the nations of the world have a right to expect and which China\r\ncan not long be permitted to withhold. From assurances received I\r\nentertain no doubt that the three ministers will act in harmonious\r\nconcert to obtain similar commercial treaties for each of the powers\r\nthey represent.\r\n\r\nWe can not fail to feel a deep interest in all that concerns the welfare\r\nof the independent Republics on our own continent, as well as of the\r\nEmpire of Brazil.\r\n\r\nOur difficulties with New Granada, which a short time since bore so\r\nthreatening an aspect, are, it is to be hoped, in a fair train of\r\nsettlement in a manner just and honorable to both parties.\r\n\r\nThe isthmus of Central America, including that of Panama, is the great\r\nhighway between the Atlantic and Pacific over which a large portion of\r\nthe commerce of the world is destined to pass. The United States are\r\nmore deeply interested than any other nation in preserving the freedom\r\nand security of all the communications across this isthmus. It is our\r\nduty, therefore, to take care that they shall not be interrupted either\r\nby invasions from our own country or by wars between the independent\r\nStates of Central America. Under our treaty with New Granada of the 12th\r\nDecember, 1846, we are bound to guarantee the neutrality of the Isthmus\r\nof Panama, through which the Panama Railroad passes, \"as well as the\r\nrights of sovereignty and property which New Granada has and possesses\r\nover the said territory.\" This obligation is founded upon equivalents\r\ngranted by the treaty to the Government and people of the United States.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I recommend to Congress the passage of an act\r\nauthorizing the President, in case of necessity, to employ the land and\r\nnaval forces of the United States to carry into effect this guaranty of\r\nneutrality and protection. I also recommend similar legislation for the\r\nsecurity of any other route across the Isthmus in which we may acquire\r\nan interest by treaty.\r\n\r\nWith the independent Republics on this continent it is both our duty and\r\nour interest to cultivate the most friendly relations. We can never feel\r\nindifferent to their fate, and must always rejoice in their prosperity.\r\nUnfortunately both for them and for us, our example and advice have lost\r\nmuch of their influence in consequence of the lawless expeditions which\r\nhave been fitted out against some of them within the limits of our\r\ncountry. Nothing is better calculated to retard our steady material\r\nprogress or impair our character as a nation than the toleration of\r\nsuch enterprises in violation of the law of nations.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the first and highest duties of any independent state\r\nin its relations with the members of the great family of nations to\r\nrestrain its people from acts of hostile aggression against their\r\ncitizens or subjects. The most eminent writers on public law do not\r\nhesitate to denounce such hostile acts as robbery and murder.\r\n\r\nWeak and feeble states like those of Central America may not feel\r\nthemselves able to assert and vindicate their rights. The case would be\r\nfar different if expeditions were set on foot within our own territories\r\nto make private war against a powerful nation. If such expeditions\r\nwere fitted out from abroad against any portion of our own country,\r\nto burn down our cities, murder and plunder our people, and usurp our\r\nGovernment, we should call any power on earth to the strictest account\r\nfor not preventing such enormities.\r\n\r\nEver since the Administration of General Washington acts of Congress\r\nhave been enforced to punish severely the crime of setting on foot a\r\nmilitary expedition within the limits of the United States to proceed\r\nfrom thence against a nation or state with whom we are at peace. The\r\npresent neutrality act of April 20, 1818, is but little more than\r\na collection of preexisting laws. Under this act the President is\r\nempowered to employ the land and naval forces and the militia \"for\r\nthe purpose of preventing the carrying on of any such expedition or\r\nenterprise from the territories and jurisdiction of the United States,\"\r\nand the collectors of customs are authorized and required to detain any\r\nvessel in port when there is reason to believe she is about to take part\r\nin such lawless enterprises.\r\n\r\nWhen it was first rendered probable that an attempt would be made to get\r\nup another unlawful expedition against Nicaragua, the Secretary of State\r\nissued instructions to the marshals and district attorneys, which were\r\ndirected by the Secretaries of War and the Navy to the appropriate army\r\nand navy officers, requiring them to be vigilant and to use their best\r\nexertions in carrying into effect the provisions of the act of 1818.\r\nNotwithstanding these precautions, the expedition has escaped from our\r\nshores. Such enterprises can do no possible good to the country, but\r\nhave already inflicted much injury both on its interests and its\r\ncharacter. They have prevented peaceful emigration from the United\r\nStates to the States of Central America, which could not fail to prove\r\nhighly beneficial to all the parties concerned. In a pecuniary point of\r\nview alone our citizens have sustained heavy losses from the seizure and\r\nclosing of the transit route by the San Juan between the two oceans.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the recent expedition was arrested at New Orleans, but\r\nwas discharged on giving bail for his appearance in the insufficient\r\nsum of $2,000.\r\n\r\nI commend the whole subject to the serious attention of Congress,\r\nbelieving that our duty and our interest, as well as our national\r\ncharacter, require that we should adopt such measures as will be\r\neffectual in restraining our citizens from committing such outrages.\r\n\r\nI regret to inform you that the President of Paraguay has refused to\r\nratify the treaty between the United States and that State as amended by\r\nthe Senate, the signature of which was mentioned in the message of my\r\npredecessor to Congress at the opening of its session in December, 1853.\r\nThe reasons assigned for this refusal will appear in the correspondence\r\nherewith submitted.\r\n\r\nIt being desirable to ascertain the fitness of the river La Plata and\r\nits tributaries for navigation by steam, the United States steamer\r\n_Water Witch_ was sent thither for that purpose in 1853. This enterprise\r\nwas successfully carried on until February, 1855, when, whilst in the\r\npeaceful prosecution of her voyage up the Parana River, the steamer\r\nwas fired upon by a Paraguayan fort. The fire was returned, but as\r\nthe _Water Witch_ was of small force and not designed for offensive\r\noperations, she retired from the conflict. The pretext upon which the\r\nattack was made was a decree of the President of Paraguay of October,\r\n1854, prohibiting foreign vessels of war from navigating the rivers of\r\nthat State. As Paraguay, however, was the owner of but one bank of the\r\nriver of that name, the other belonging to Corientes, a State of the\r\nArgentine Confederation, the right of its Government to expect that such\r\na decree would be obeyed can not be acknowledged. But the _Water Witch_\r\nwas not, properly speaking, a vessel of war. She was a small steamer\r\nengaged in a scientific enterprise intended for the advantage of\r\ncommercial states generally. Under these circumstances I am constrained\r\nto consider the attack upon her as unjustifiable and as calling for\r\nsatisfaction from the Paraguayan Government.\r\n\r\nCitizens of the United States also who were established in business in\r\nParaguay have had their property seized and taken from them, and have\r\notherwise been treated by the authorities in an insulting and arbitrary\r\nmanner, which requires redress.\r\n\r\nA demand for these purposes will be made in a firm but conciliatory\r\nspirit. This will the more probably be granted if the Executive shall\r\nhave authority to use other means in the event of a refusal. This is\r\naccordingly recommended.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to state in detail the alarming condition of the\r\nTerritory of Kansas at the time of my inauguration. The opposing parties\r\nthen stood in hostile array against each other, and any accident might\r\nhave relighted the flames of civil war. Besides, at this critical moment\r\nKansas was left without a governor by the resignation of Governor Geary.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of February previous the Territorial legislature had passed\r\na law providing for the election of delegates on the third Monday of\r\nJune to a convention to meet on the first Monday of September for the\r\npurpose of framing a constitution preparatory to admission into the\r\nUnion. This law was in the main fair and just, and it is to be regretted\r\nthat all the qualified electors had not registered themselves and voted\r\nunder its provisions.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the election for delegates an extensive organization\r\nexisted in the Territory whose avowed object it was, if need be, to put\r\ndown the lawful government by force and to establish a government of\r\ntheir own under the so-called Topeka constitution. The persons attached\r\nto this revolutionary organization abstained from taking any part in the\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nThe act of the Territorial legislature had omitted to provide for\r\nsubmitting to the people the constitution which might be framed by the\r\nconvention, and in the excited state of public feeling throughout Kansas\r\nan apprehension extensively prevailed that a design existed to force\r\nupon them a constitution in relation to slavery against their will.\r\nIn this emergency it became my duty, as it was my unquestionable\r\nright, having in view the union of all good citizens in support of the\r\nTerritorial laws, to express an opinion on the true construction of the\r\nprovisions concerning slavery contained in the organic act of Congress\r\nof the 30th May, 1854. Congress declared it to be \"the true intent and\r\nmeaning of this act not to legislate slavery into any Territory or\r\nState, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof\r\nperfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their\r\nown way.\" Under it Kansas, \"when admitted as a State,\" was to \"be\r\nreceived into the Union with or without slavery, as their constitution\r\nmay prescribe at the time of their admission.\"\r\n\r\nDid Congress mean by this language that the delegates elected to frame\r\na constitution should have authority finally to decide the question of\r\nslavery, or did they intend by leaving it to the people that the people\r\nof Kansas themselves should decide this question by a direct vote? On\r\nthis subject I confess I had never entertained a serious doubt, and\r\ntherefore in my instructions to Governor Walker of the 28th March last\r\nI merely said that when \"a constitution shall be submitted to the people\r\nof the Territory they must be protected in the exercise of their right\r\nof voting for or against that instrument, and the fair expression of the\r\npopular will must not be interrupted by fraud or violence.\"\r\n\r\nIn expressing this opinion it was far from my intention to interfere\r\nwith the decision of the people of Kansas, either for or against\r\nslavery. From this I have always carefully abstained. Intrusted with the\r\nduty of taking \"care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" my only\r\ndesire was that the people of Kansas should furnish to Congress the\r\nevidence required by the organic act, whether for or against slavery,\r\nand in this manner smooth their passage into the Union. In emerging from\r\nthe condition of Territorial dependence into that of a sovereign State\r\nit was their duty, in my opinion, to make known their will by the votes\r\nof the majority on the direct question whether this important domestic\r\ninstitution should or should not continue to exist. Indeed, this was\r\nthe only possible mode in which their will could be authentically\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nThe election of delegates to a convention must necessarily take place in\r\nseparate districts. From this cause it may readily happen, as has often\r\nbeen the case, that a majority of the people of a State or Territory are\r\non one side of a question, whilst a majority of the representatives from\r\nthe several districts into which it is divided may be upon the other\r\nside. This arises from the fact that in some districts delegates may\r\nbe elected by small majorities, whilst in others those of different\r\nsentiments may receive majorities sufficiently great not only to\r\novercome the votes given for the former, but to leave a large majority\r\nof the whole people in direct opposition to a majority of the delegates.\r\nBesides, our history proves that influences may be brought to bear on\r\nthe representative sufficiently powerful to induce him to disregard the\r\nwill of his constituents. The truth is that no other authentic and\r\nsatisfactory mode exists of ascertaining the will of a majority of the\r\npeople of any State or Territory on an important and exciting question\r\nlike that of slavery in Kansas except by leaving it to a direct vote.\r\nHow wise, then, was it for Congress to pass over all subordinate and\r\nintermediate agencies and proceed directly to the source of all\r\nlegitimate power under our institutions!\r\n\r\nHow vain would any other principle prove in practice! This may be\r\nillustrated by the case of Kansas. Should she be admitted into the Union\r\nwith a constitution either maintaining or abolishing slavery against\r\nthe sentiment of the people, this could have no other effect than to\r\ncontinue and to exasperate the existing agitation during the brief\r\nperiod required to make the constitution conform to the irresistible\r\nwill of the majority.\r\n\r\nThe friends and supporters of the Nebraska and Kansas act, when\r\nstruggling on a recent occasion to sustain its wise provisions before\r\nthe great tribunal of the American people, never differed about its true\r\nmeaning on this subject. Everywhere throughout the Union they publicly\r\npledged their faith and their honor that they would cheerfully submit\r\nthe question of slavery to the decision of the _bona fide_ people of\r\nKansas, without any restriction or qualification whatever. All were\r\ncordially united upon the great doctrine of popular sovereignty, which\r\nis the vital principle of our free institutions. Had it then been\r\ninsinuated from any quarter that it would be a sufficient compliance\r\nwith the requisitions of the organic law for the members of a convention\r\nthereafter to be elected to withhold the question of slavery from\r\nthe people and to substitute their own will for that of a legally\r\nascertained majority of all their constituents, this would have been\r\ninstantly rejected. Everywhere they remained true to the resolution\r\nadopted on a celebrated occasion recognizing \"the right of the people of\r\nall the Territories, including Kansas and Nebraska, acting through the\r\nlegally and fairly expressed will of a majority of actual residents,\r\nand whenever the number of their inhabitants justifies it, to form a\r\nconstitution with or without slavery and be admitted into the Union upon\r\nterms of perfect equality with the other States.\"\r\n\r\nThe convention to frame a constitution for Kansas met on the first\r\nMonday of September last. They were called together by virtue of an\r\nact of the Territorial legislature, whose lawful existence had been\r\nrecognized by Congress in different forms and by different enactments.\r\nA large proportion of the citizens of Kansas did not think proper to\r\nregister their names and to vote at the election for delegates; but an\r\nopportunity to do this having been fairly afforded, their refusal to\r\navail themselves of their right could in no manner affect the legality\r\nof the convention.\r\n\r\nThis convention proceeded to frame a constitution for Kansas, and\r\nfinally adjourned on the 7th day of November. But little difficulty\r\noccurred in the convention except on the subject of slavery. The truth\r\nis that the general provisions of our recent State constitutions are\r\nso similar and, I may add, so excellent that the difference between\r\nthem is not essential. Under the earlier practice of the Government no\r\nconstitution framed by the convention of a Territory preparatory to its\r\nadmission into the Union as a State had been submitted to the people.\r\nI trust, however, the example set by the last Congress, requiring that\r\nthe constitution of Minnesota \"should be subject to the approval and\r\nratification of the people of the proposed State,\" may be followed on\r\nfuture occasions. I took it for granted that the convention of Kansas\r\nwould act in accordance with this example, founded, as it is, on correct\r\nprinciples, and hence my instructions to Governor Walker in favor of\r\nsubmitting the constitution to the people were expressed in general and\r\nunqualified terms.\r\n\r\nIn the Kansas-Nebraska act, however, this requirement, as applicable to\r\nthe whole constitution, had not been inserted, and the convention were\r\nnot bound by its terms to submit any other portion of the instrument to\r\nan election except that which relates to the \"domestic institution\"\r\nof slavery. This will be rendered clear by a simple reference to its\r\nlanguage. It was \"not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State,\r\nnor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly\r\nfree to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way.\"\r\nAccording to the plain construction of the sentence, the words \"domestic\r\ninstitutions\" have a direct, as they have an appropriate, reference to\r\nslavery. \"Domestic institutions\" are limited to the family The relation\r\nbetween master and slave and a few others are \"domestic institutions,\"\r\nand are entirely distinct from institutions of a political character.\r\nBesides, there was no question then before Congress, nor, indeed, has\r\nthere since been any serious question before the people of Kansas or\r\nthe country, except that which relates to the \"domestic institution\"\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\nThe convention, after an angry and excited debate, finally determined,\r\nby a majority of only two, to submit the question of slavery to the\r\npeople, though at the last forty-three of the fifty delegates present\r\naffixed their signatures to the constitution.\r\n\r\nA large majority of the convention were in favor of establishing slavery\r\nin Kansas. They accordingly inserted an article in the constitution for\r\nthis purpose similar in form to those which had been adopted by other\r\nTerritorial conventions. In the schedule, however, providing for the\r\ntransition from a Territorial to a State government the question has\r\nbeen fairly and explicitly referred to the people whether they will have\r\na constitution \"with or without slavery.\" It declares that before the\r\nconstitution adopted by the convention \"shall be sent to Congress for\r\nadmission into the Union as a State\" an election shall be held to decide\r\nthis question, at which all the white male inhabitants of the Territory\r\nabove the age of 21 are entitled to vote. They are to vote by ballot,\r\nand \"the ballots cast at said election shall be indorsed 'constitution\r\nwith slavery' and 'constitution with no slavery.'\" If there be a\r\nmajority in favor of the \"constitution with slavery,\" then it is to\r\nbe transmitted to Congress by the president of the convention in its\r\noriginal form; if, on the contrary, there shall be a majority in favor\r\nof the \"constitution with no slavery,\" \"then the article providing for\r\nslavery shall be stricken from the constitution by the president of this\r\nconvention;\" and it is expressly declared that \"no slavery shall exist\r\nin the State of Kansas, except that the right of property in slaves now\r\nin the Territory shall in no manner be interfered with;\" and in that\r\nevent it is made his duty to have the constitution thus ratified\r\ntransmitted to the Congress of the United States for the admission of\r\nthe State into the Union.\r\n\r\nAt this election every citizen will have an opportunity of expressing\r\nhis opinion by his vote \"whether Kansas shall be received into the\r\nUnion with or without slavery,\" and thus this exciting question may be\r\npeacefully settled in the very mode required by the organic law. The\r\nelection will be held under legitimate authority, and if any portion of\r\nthe inhabitants shall refuse to vote, a fair opportunity to do so having\r\nbeen presented, this will be their own voluntary act and they alone will\r\nbe responsible for the consequences.\r\n\r\nWhether Kansas shall be a free or a slave State must eventually, under\r\nsome authority, be decided by an election; and the question can never\r\nbe more clearly or distinctly presented to the people than it is at the\r\npresent moment. Should this opportunity be rejected she may be involved\r\nfor years in domestic discord, and possibly in civil war, before she can\r\nagain make up the issue now so fortunately tendered and again reach the\r\npoint she has already attained.\r\n\r\nKansas has for some years occupied too much of the public attention.\r\nIt is high time this should be directed to far more important objects.\r\nWhen once admitted into the Union, whether with or without slavery, the\r\nexcitement beyond her own limits will speedily pass away, and she will\r\nthen for the first time be left, as she ought to have been long since,\r\nto manage her own affairs in her own way. If her constitution on the\r\nsubject of slavery or on any other subject be displeasing to a majority\r\nof the people, no human power can prevent them from changing it within\r\na brief period. Under these circumstances it may well be questioned\r\nwhether the peace and quiet of the whole country are not of greater\r\nimportance than the mere temporary triumph of either of the political\r\nparties in Kansas.\r\n\r\nShould the constitution without slavery be adopted by the votes of the\r\nmajority, the rights of property in slaves now in the Territory are\r\nreserved. The number of these is very small, but if it were greater the\r\nprovision would be equally just and reasonable. The slaves were brought\r\ninto the Territory under the Constitution of the United States and are\r\nnow the property of their masters. This point has at length been finally\r\ndecided by the highest judicial tribunal of the country, and this upon\r\nthe plain principle that when a confederacy of sovereign States acquire\r\na new territory at their joint expense both equality and justice demand\r\nthat the citizens of one and all of them shall have the right to take\r\ninto it whatsoever is recognized as property by the common Constitution.\r\nTo have summarily confiscated the property in slaves already in the\r\nTerritory would have been an act of gross injustice and contrary to the\r\npractice of the older States of the Union which have abolished slavery.\r\n\r\nA Territorial government was established for Utah by act of Congress\r\napproved the 9th September, 1850, and the Constitution and laws of the\r\nUnited States were thereby extended over it \"so far as the same or any\r\nprovisions thereof may be applicable.\" This act provided for the\r\nappointment by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, of a governor (who was to be _ex officio_ superintendent of\r\nIndian affairs), a secretary, three judges of the supreme court, a\r\nmarshal, and a district attorney. Subsequent acts provided for the\r\nappointment of the officers necessary to extend our land and our Indian\r\nsystem over the Territory. Brigham Young was appointed the first\r\ngovernor on the 20th September, 1850, and has held the office ever\r\nsince. Whilst Governor Young has been both governor and superintendent\r\nof Indian affairs throughout this period, he has been at the same time\r\nthe head of the church called the Latter-day Saints, and professes to\r\ngovern its members and dispose of their property by direct inspiration\r\nand authority from the Almighty. His power has been, therefore, absolute\r\nover both church and state.\r\n\r\nThe people of Utah almost exclusively belong to this church, and\r\nbelieving with a fanatical spirit that he is governor of the Territory\r\nby divine appointment, they obey his commands as if these were direct\r\nrevelations from Heaven. If, therefore, he chooses that his government\r\nshall come into collision with the Government of the United States, the\r\nmembers of the Mormon Church will yield implicit obedience to his will.\r\nUnfortunately, existing facts leave but little doubt that such is his\r\ndetermination. Without entering upon a minute history of occurrences,\r\nit is sufficient to say that all the officers of the United States,\r\njudicial and executive, with the single exception of two Indian agents,\r\nhave found it necessary for their own personal safety to withdraw from\r\nthe Territory, and there no longer remains any government in Utah but\r\nthe despotism of Brigham Young. This being the condition of affairs in\r\nthe Territory, I could not mistake the path of duty. As Chief Executive\r\nMagistrate I was bound to restore the supremacy of the Constitution and\r\nlaws within its limits. In order to effect this purpose, I appointed a\r\nnew governor and other Federal officers for Utah and sent with them a\r\nmilitary force for their protection and to aid as a _posse comitatus_\r\nin case of need in the execution of the laws.\r\n\r\nWith the religious opinions of the Mormons, as long as they remained\r\nmere opinions, however deplorable in themselves and revolting to the\r\nmoral and religious sentiments of all Christendom, I had no right to\r\ninterfere. Actions alone, when in violation of the Constitution and\r\nlaws of the United States, become the legitimate subjects for the\r\njurisdiction of the civil magistrate. My instructions to Governor\r\nCumming have therefore been framed in strict accordance with these\r\nprinciples. At their date a hope was indulged that no necessity might\r\nexist for employing the military in restoring and maintaining the\r\nauthority of the law, but this hope has now vanished. Governor Young has\r\nby proclamation declared his determination to maintain his power by\r\nforce, and has already committed acts of hostility against the United\r\nStates. Unless he should retrace his steps the Territory of Utah will be\r\nin a state of open rebellion. He has committed these acts of hostility\r\nnotwithstanding Major Van Vliet, an officer of the Army, sent to Utah\r\nby the Commanding General to purchase provisions for the troops, had\r\ngiven him the strongest assurances of the peaceful intentions of the\r\nGovernment, and that the troops would only be employed as a _posse\r\ncomitatus_ when called on by the civil authority to aid in the execution\r\nof the laws.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that Governor Young has long contemplated\r\nthis result. He knows that the continuance of his despotic power depends\r\nupon the exclusion of all settlers from the Territory except those who\r\nwill acknowledge his divine mission and implicitly obey his will,\r\nand that an enlightened public opinion there would soon prostrate\r\ninstitutions at war with the laws both of God and man. He has therefore\r\nfor several years, in order to maintain his independence, been\r\nindustriously employed in collecting and fabricating arms and munitions\r\nof war and in disciplining the Mormons for military service. As\r\nsuperintendent of Indian affairs he has had an opportunity of tampering\r\nwith the Indian tribes and exciting their hostile feelings against the\r\nUnited States. This, according to our information, he has accomplished\r\nin regard to some of these tribes, while others have remained true to\r\ntheir allegiance and have communicated his intrigues to our Indian\r\nagents. He has laid in a store of provisions for three years, which\r\nin case of necessity, as he informed Major Van Vliet, he will conceal,\r\n\"and then take to the mountains and bid defiance to all the powers of\r\nthe Government.\"\r\n\r\nA great part of all this may be idle boasting, but yet no wise\r\ngovernment will lightly estimate the efforts which may be inspired by\r\nsuch frenzied fanaticism as exists among the Mormons in Utah. This is\r\nthe first rebellion which has existed in our Territories, and humanity\r\nitself requires that we should put it down in such a manner that it\r\nshall be the last. To trifle with it would be to encourage it and to\r\nrender it formidable. We ought to go there with such an imposing force\r\nas to convince these deluded people that resistance would be vain,\r\nand thus spare the effusion of blood. We can in this manner best\r\nconvince them that we are their friends, not their enemies. In order to\r\naccomplish this object it will be necessary, according to the estimate\r\nof the War Department, to raise four additional regiments; and this I\r\nearnestly recommend to Congress. At the present moment of depression in\r\nthe revenues of the country I am sorry to be obliged to recommend such a\r\nmeasure; but I feel confident of the support of Congress, cost what it\r\nmay, in suppressing the insurrection and in restoring and maintaining\r\nthe sovereignty of the Constitution and laws over the Territory of Utah.\r\n\r\nI recommend to Congress the establishment of a Territorial government\r\nover Arizona, incorporating with it such portions of New Mexico as they\r\nmay deem expedient. I need scarcely adduce arguments in support of this\r\nrecommendation. We are bound to protect the lives and the property of\r\nour citizens inhabiting Arizona, and these are now without any efficient\r\nprotection. Their present number is already considerable, and is rapidly\r\nincreasing, notwithstanding the disadvantages under which they labor.\r\nBesides, the proposed Territory is believed to be rich in mineral and\r\nagricultural resources, especially in silver and copper. The mails of\r\nthe United States to California are now carried over it throughout its\r\nwhole extent, and this route is known to be the nearest and believed to\r\nbe the best to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nLong experience has deeply convinced me that a strict construction of\r\nthe powers granted to Congress is the only true, as well as the only\r\nsafe, theory of the Constitution. Whilst this principle shall guide my\r\npublic conduct, I consider it clear that under the war-making power\r\nCongress may appropriate money for the construction of a military road\r\nthrough the Territories of the United States when this is absolutely\r\nnecessary for the defense of any of the States against foreign invasion.\r\nThe Constitution has conferred upon Congress power \"to declare war,\" \"to\r\nraise and support armies,\" \"to provide and maintain a navy,\" and to call\r\nforth the militia to \"repel invasions.\" These high sovereign powers\r\nnecessarily involve important and responsible public duties, and among\r\nthem there is none so sacred and so imperative as that of preserving\r\nour soil from the invasion of a foreign enemy. The Constitution has\r\ntherefore left nothing on this point to construction, but expressly\r\nrequires that \"the United States shall protect each of them [the States]\r\nagainst invasion.\" Now if a military road over our own Territories be\r\nindispensably necessary to enable us to meet and repel the invader, it\r\nfollows as a necessary consequence not only that we possess the power,\r\nbut it is our imperative duty to construct such a road. It would be an\r\nabsurdity to invest a government with the unlimited power to make and\r\nconduct war and at the same time deny to it the only means of reaching\r\nand defeating the enemy at the frontier. Without such a road it is quite\r\nevident we can not \"protect\" California and our Pacific possessions\r\n\"against invasion.\" We can not by any other means transport men and\r\nmunitions of war from the Atlantic States in sufficient time successfully\r\nto defend these remote and distant portions of the Republic.\r\n\r\nExperience has proved that the routes across the isthmus of Central\r\nAmerica are at best but a very uncertain and unreliable mode of\r\ncommunication. But even if this were not the case, they would at once\r\nbe closed against us in the event of war with a naval power so much\r\nstronger than our own as to enable it to blockade the ports at either\r\nend of these routes. After all, therefore, we can only rely upon a\r\nmilitary road through our own Territories; and ever since the origin\r\nof the Government Congress has been in the practice of appropriating\r\nmoney from the public Treasury for the construction of such roads.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties and the expense of constructing a military railroad to\r\nconnect our Atlantic and Pacific States have been greatly exaggerated.\r\nThe distance on the Arizona route, near the thirty-second parallel of\r\nnorth latitude, between the western boundary of Texas, on the Rio\r\nGrande, and the eastern boundary of California, on the Colorado, from\r\nthe best explorations now within our knowledge, does not exceed 470\r\nmiles, and the face of the country is in the main favorable. For obvious\r\nreasons the Government ought not to undertake the work itself by means\r\nof its own agents. This ought to be committed to other agencies, which\r\nCongress might assist, either by grants of land or money, or by both,\r\nupon such terms and conditions as they may deem most beneficial for the\r\ncountry. Provision might thus be made not only for the safe, rapid, and\r\neconomical transportation of troops and munitions of war, but also of\r\nthe public mails. The commercial interests of the whole country, both\r\nEast and West, would be greatly promoted by such a road, and, above all,\r\nit would be a powerful additional bond of union. And although advantages\r\nof this kind, whether postal, commercial, or political, can not confer\r\nconstitutional power, yet they may furnish auxiliary arguments in favor\r\nof expediting a work which, in my judgment, is clearly embraced within\r\nthe war-making power.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I commend to the friendly consideration of Congress\r\nthe subject of the Pacific Railroad, without finally committing myself\r\nto any particular route.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will furnish a detailed\r\nstatement of the condition of the public finances and of the respective\r\nbranches of the public service devolved upon that Department of the\r\nGovernment. By this report it appears that the amount of revenue\r\nreceived from all sources into the Treasury during the fiscal year\r\nending the 30th June, 1857, was $68,631,513.67, which amount, with\r\nthe balance of $19,901,325.45 remaining in the Treasury at the\r\ncommencement of the year, made an aggregate for the service of the\r\nyear of $88,532,839.12.\r\n\r\nThe public expenditures for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1857,\r\namounted to $70,822,724.85, of which $5,943,896.91 were applied to the\r\nredemption of the public debt, including interest and premium, leaving\r\nin the Treasury at the commencement of the present fiscal year, on the\r\n1st July, 1857, $17,710,114.27.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury for the first quarter of the present fiscal\r\nyear, commencing 1st July, 1857, were $20,929,819.81, and the estimated\r\nreceipts of the remaining three quarters to the 30th June, 1858,\r\nare $36,750,000, making, with the balance before stated, an aggregate of\r\n$75,389,934.08 for the service of the present fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe actual expenditures during the first quarter of the present fiscal\r\nyear were $23,714,528.37, of which $3,895,232.39 were applied to the\r\nredemption of the public debt, including interest and premium. The\r\nprobable expenditures of the remaining three quarters to 30th June,\r\n1858, are $51,248,530.04, including interest on the public debt, making\r\nan aggregate of $74,963,058.41, leaving an estimated balance in the\r\nTreasury at the close of the present fiscal year of $426,875.67.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the public debt at the commencement of the present\r\nfiscal year was $29,060,386.90.\r\n\r\nThe amount redeemed since the 1st of July was $3,895,232.39, leaving\r\na balance unredeemed at this time of $25,165,154.51.\r\n\r\nThe amount of estimated expenditures for the remaining three quarters\r\nof the present fiscal year will in all probability be increased from\r\nthe causes set forth in the report of the Secretary. His suggestion,\r\ntherefore, that authority should be given to supply any temporary\r\ndeficiency by the issue of a limited amount of Treasury notes is\r\napproved, and I accordingly recommend the passage of such a law.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the report of the Secretary, the tariff of March 3,\r\n1857, has been in operation for so short a period of time and under\r\ncircumstances so unfavorable to a just development of its results as\r\na revenue measure that I should regard it as inexpedient, at least for\r\nthe present, to undertake its revision.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the reports made to me by the Secretaries of War and\r\nof the Navy, of the Interior, and of the Postmaster-General. They all\r\ncontain valuable and important information and suggestions, which I\r\ncommend to the favorable consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nI have already recommended the raising of four additional regiments, and\r\nthe report of the Secretary of War presents strong reasons proving this\r\nincrease of the Army under existing circumstances to be indispensable.\r\n\r\nI would call the special attention of Congress to the recommendation of\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy in favor of the construction of ten small war\r\nsteamers of light draft. For some years the Government has been obliged\r\non many occasions to hire such steamers from individuals to supply its\r\npressing wants. At the present moment we have no armed vessel in the\r\nNavy which can penetrate the rivers of China. We have but few which can\r\nenter any of the harbors south of Norfolk, although many millions of\r\nforeign and domestic commerce annually pass in and out of these harbors.\r\nSome of our most valuable interests and most vulnerable points are thus\r\nleft exposed. This class of vessels of light draft, great speed, and\r\nheavy guns would be formidable in coast defense. The cost of their\r\nconstruction will not be great and they will require but a comparatively\r\nsmall expenditure to keep them in commission. In time of peace they will\r\nprove as effective as much larger vessels and more useful, One of them\r\nshould be at every station where we maintain a squadron, and three or\r\nfour should be constantly employed on our Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\r\nEconomy, utility, and efficiency combine to recommend them as almost\r\nindispensable. Ten of these small vessels would be of incalculable\r\nadvantage to the naval service, and the whole cost of their construction\r\nwould not exceed $2,300,000, or $230,000 each.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Interior is worthy of grave\r\nconsideration. It treats of the numerous important and diversified\r\nbranches of domestic administration intrusted to him by law. Among\r\nthese the most prominent are the public lands and our relations with\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\nOur system for the disposal of the public lands, originating with the\r\nfathers of the Republic, has been improved as experience pointed the\r\nway, and gradually adapted to the growth and settlement of our Western\r\nStates and Territories. It has worked well in practice. Already thirteen\r\nStates and seven Territories have been carved out of these lands, and\r\nstill more than a thousand millions of acres remain unsold. What a\r\nboundless prospect this presents to our country of future prosperity\r\nand power!\r\n\r\nWe have heretofore disposed of 363,862,464 acres of the public land.\r\n\r\nWhilst the public lands, as a source of revenue, are of great\r\nimportance, their importance is far greater as furnishing homes for\r\na hardy and independent race of honest and industrious citizens who\r\ndesire to subdue and cultivate the soil. They ought to be administered\r\nmainly with a view of promoting this wise and benevolent policy. In\r\nappropriating them for any other purpose we ought to use even greater\r\neconomy than if they had been converted into money and the proceeds\r\nwere already in the public Treasury. To squander away this richest and\r\nnoblest inheritance which any people have ever enjoyed upon objects of\r\ndoubtful constitutionality or expediency would be to violate one of the\r\nmost important trusts ever committed to any people. Whilst I do not deny\r\nto Congress the power, when acting _bona fide_ as a proprietor, to give\r\naway portions of them for the purpose of increasing the value of the\r\nremainder, yet, considering the great temptation to abuse this power,\r\nwe can not be too cautious in its exercise.\r\n\r\nActual settlers under existing laws are protected against other\r\npurchasers at the public sales in their right of preemption to the\r\nextent of a quarter section, or 160 acres, of land. The remainder may\r\nthen be disposed of at public or entered at private sale in unlimited\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nSpeculation has of late years prevailed to a great extent in the public\r\nlands. The consequence has been that large portions of them have become\r\nthe property of individuals and companies, and thus the price is greatly\r\nenhanced to those who desire to purchase for actual settlement. In order\r\nto limit the area of speculation as much as possible, the extinction of\r\nthe Indian title and the extension of the public surveys ought only to\r\nkeep pace with the tide of emigration.\r\n\r\nIf Congress should hereafter grant alternate sections to States\r\nor companies, as they have done heretofore, I recommend that the\r\nintermediate sections retained by the Government should be subject\r\nto preemption by actual settlers.\r\n\r\nIt ought ever to be our cardinal policy to reserve the public lands as\r\nmuch as may be for actual settlers, and this at moderate prices. We\r\nshall thus not only best promote the prosperity of the new States and\r\nTerritories and the power of the Union, but shall secure homes for our\r\nposterity for many generations.\r\n\r\nThe extension of our limits has brought within our jurisdiction many\r\nadditional and populous tribes of Indians, a large proportion of which\r\nare wild, untractable, and difficult to control. Predatory and warlike\r\nin their disposition and habits, it is impossible altogether to restrain\r\nthem from committing aggressions on each other, as well as upon our\r\nfrontier citizens and those emigrating to our distant States and\r\nTerritories. Hence expensive military expeditions are frequently\r\nnecessary to overawe and chastise the more lawless and hostile.\r\n\r\nThe present system of making them valuable presents to influence them to\r\nremain at peace has proved ineffectual. It is believed to be the better\r\npolicy to colonize them in suitable localities where they can receive\r\nthe rudiments of education and be gradually induced to adopt habits of\r\nindustry. So far as the experiment has been tried it has worked well\r\nin practice, and it will doubtless prove to be less expensive than the\r\npresent system.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of Indians within our territorial limits is believed\r\nto be, from the best data in the Interior Department, about 325,000.\r\n\r\nThe tribes of Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Creeks settled in the\r\nTerritory set apart for them west of Arkansas are rapidly advancing in\r\neducation and in all the arts of civilization and self-government, and\r\nwe may indulge the agreeable anticipation that at no very distant day\r\nthey will be incorporated into the Union as one of the sovereign States.\r\nIt will be seen from the report of the Postmaster-General that the\r\nPost-Office Department still continues to depend on the Treasury, as\r\nit has been compelled to do for several years past, for an important\r\nportion of the means of sustaining and extending its operations. Their\r\nrapid growth and expansion are shown by a decennial statement of the\r\nnumber of post-offices and the length of post-roads, commencing with the\r\nyear 1827. In that year there were 7,000 post-offices; in 1837, 11,177;\r\nin 1847, 15,146, and in 1857 they number 26,586. In this year 1,725\r\npost-offices have been established and 704 discontinued, leaving a\r\nnet increase of 1,021. The postmasters of 368 offices are appointed\r\nby the President.\r\n\r\nThe length of post-roads in 1827 was 105,336 miles; in 1837, 141,242\r\nmiles; in 1847, 153,818 miles, and in the year 1857 there are 242,601\r\nmiles of post-road, including 22,530 miles of railroad on which the mails\r\nare transported.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of the Department for the fiscal year ending on the\r\n30th June, 1857, as adjusted by the Auditor, amounted to $11,507,670.\r\nTo defray these expenditures there was to the credit of the Department\r\non the 1st July, 1856, the sum of $789,599; the gross revenue of the\r\nyear, including the annual allowances for the transportation of free\r\nmail matter, produced $8,053,951, and the remainder was supplied by\r\nthe appropriation from the Treasury of $2,250,000 granted by the act of\r\nCongress approved August 18, 1856, and by the appropriation of $666,883\r\nmade by the act of March 3, 1857, leaving $252,763 to be carried to the\r\ncredit of the Department in the accounts of the current year. I commend\r\nto your consideration the report of the Department in relation to the\r\nestablishment of the overland mail route from the Mississippi River to\r\nSan Francisco, Cal. The route was selected with my full concurrence, as\r\nthe one, in my judgment, best calculated to attain the important objects\r\ncontemplated by Congress.\r\n\r\nThe late disastrous monetary revulsion may have one good effect should\r\nit cause both the Government and the people to return to the practice of\r\na wise and judicious economy both in public and private expenditures.\r\n\r\nAn overflowing Treasury has led to habits of prodigality and\r\nextravagance in our legislation. It has induced Congress to make large\r\nappropriations to objects for which they never would have provided had\r\nit been necessary to raise the amount of revenue required to meet them\r\nby increased taxation or by loans. We are now compelled to pause in our\r\ncareer and to scrutinize our expenditures with the utmost vigilance;\r\nand in performing this duty I pledge my cooperation to the extent of\r\nmy constitutional competency.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be observed at the same time that true public economy does\r\nnot consist in withholding the means necessary to accomplish important\r\nnational objects intrusted to us by the Constitution, and especially\r\nsuch as may be necessary for the common defense. In the present crisis\r\nof the country it is our duty to confine our appropriations to objects\r\nof this character, unless in cases where justice to individuals may\r\ndemand a different course. In all cases care ought to be taken that the\r\nmoney granted by Congress shall be faithfully and economically applied.\r\n\r\nUnder the Federal Constitution \"every bill which shall have passed the\r\nHouse of Representatives and the Senate shall, before it become a law.\"\r\nbe approved and signed by the President; and if not approved, \"he shall\r\nreturn it with his objections to that House in which it shall have\r\noriginated.\" In order to perform this high and responsible duty,\r\nsufficient time must be allowed the President to read and examine\r\nevery bill presented to him for approval. Unless this be afforded,\r\nthe Constitution becomes a dead letter in this particular, and, even\r\nworse, it becomes a means of deception. Our constituents, seeing the\r\nPresident's approval and signature attached to each act of Congress,\r\nare induced to believe that he has actually performed his duty, when\r\nin truth nothing is in many cases more unfounded.\r\n\r\nFrom the practice of Congress such an examination of each bill as the\r\nConstitution requires has been rendered impossible. The most important\r\nbusiness of each session is generally crowded into its last hours, and\r\nthe alternative presented to the President is either to violate the\r\nconstitutional duty which he owes to the people and approve bills which\r\nfor want of time it is impossible he should have examined, or by his\r\nrefusal to do this subject the country and individuals to great loss\r\nand inconvenience. Besides, a practice has grown up of late years to\r\nlegislate in appropriation bills at the last hours of the session on new\r\nand important subjects. This practice constrains the President either\r\nto suffer measures to become laws which he does not approve or to\r\nincur the risk of stopping the wheels of the Government by vetoing\r\nan appropriation bill. Formerly such bills were confined to specific\r\nappropriations for carrying into effect existing laws and the\r\nwell-established policy of the country, and little time was then\r\nrequired by the President for their examination.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I have deliberately determined that I shall approve no\r\nbills which I have not examined, and it will be a case of extreme and\r\nmost urgent necessity which shall ever induce me to depart from this\r\nrule. I therefore respectfully but earnestly recommend that the two\r\nHouses would allow the President at least two days previous to the\r\nadjournment of each session within which no new bill shall be presented\r\nto him for approval. Under the existing joint rule one day is allowed,\r\nbut this rule has been hitherto so constantly suspended in practice\r\nthat important bills continue to be presented to him up till the very\r\nlast moments of the session. In a large majority of cases no great\r\npublic inconvenience can arise from the want of time to examine their\r\nprovisions, because the Constitution has declared that if a bill be\r\npresented to the President within the last ten days of the session he\r\nis not required to return it, either with an approval or with a veto,\r\n\"in which case it shall not be a law.\" It may then lie over and be taken\r\nup and passed at the next session. Great inconvenience would only be\r\nexperienced in regard to appropriation bills, but, fortunately, under\r\nthe late excellent law allowing a salary instead of a per diem to\r\nmembers of Congress the expense and inconvenience of a called session\r\nwill be greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nI can not conclude without commending to your favorable consideration\r\nthe interest of the people of this District. Without a representative on\r\nthe floor of Congress, they have for this very reason peculiar claims\r\nupon our just regard. To this I know, from my long acquaintance with\r\nthem, they are eminently entitled.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 8, 1857_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHerewith I transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and His Majesty\r\nthe King of Denmark for the discontinuance of the Sound dues, signed in\r\nthis city on the 11th day of April last.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 10, 1857_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\n\r\nI transmit a copy of a letter of the 30th of May last from the\r\ncommissioner of the United States in China, and of the decree and\r\nregulation which accompanied it, for such revision thereof as Congress\r\nmay deem expedient, pursuant to the sixth section of the act approved\r\nthe 11th of August, 1848.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 17, 1857_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention for the mutual delivery of criminals\r\nfugitives from justice in certain cases, and for other purposes,\r\nconcluded at The Hague on the 21st day of August last, between the\r\nUnited States and His Majesty the King of the Netherlands.

Reynolds, late of the Quartermaster's Department\r\nof the Army, to be assistant quartermaster with the rank of captain, to\r\ndate from August 5, 1847, and to take place on the Army Register next\r\nbelow Captain S. Van Vliet, agreeably to the recommendation of the\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT, _January 6, 1858_.\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nSIR: Under date of October 9, 1855, Captain A.W. Reynolds, assistant\r\nquartermaster, was dismissed from the public service in virtue of the\r\nthird section of the act approved January 31, 1823.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards suit was brought in the United States district court\r\nfor the eastern district of Pennsylvania for the purpose of recovering\r\nthe amounts alleged to be due the United States from Captain Reynolds,\r\nand which were stated at $126,307.20. At the suggestion of the United\r\nStates district attorney, and with the consent of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, the matter was referred for a full and careful reexamination\r\nto three gentlemen, of whom one is understood to have been an\r\nexperienced clerk of the Treasury Department of the United States.\r\nThe verdict of the referees, fully concurred in by the United States\r\ndistrict attorney, subsequently confirmed by a jury, and according to\r\nwhich judgment was rendered by the court, is that the United States are,\r\non the contrary, indebted to Captain Reynolds in the sum of $130.63.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this high judicial award in Captain Reynolds's favor,\r\nnumerous petitions have been received--from the district attorney, from\r\nthe referees who examined the case, from his brother officers of the\r\nArmy--all testifying to their assured belief in his perfect integrity,\r\nno less than in his high character as a gentleman and a soldier, and\r\nearnestly requesting of the President of the United States that he would\r\nbe pleased to reinstate him in the position which he formerly held in\r\nthe Quartermaster's Department of the Army.\r\n\r\nAmong the last description of petitions are many of the highest\r\nofficers, in rank as well as reputation, who served with Captain\r\nReynolds in New Mexico, the theater of his difficulties, and they\r\nrespectfully urge their conviction that were the President \"cognizant,\"\r\nas many of them declare themselves to be, of the circumstances \"under\r\nwhich Captain Reynolds was made responsible for public property over\r\nwhich he had no control,\" that he could feel no hesitation about\r\nrestoring him to the service.\r\n\r\nIn view of all which facts I have the honor to submit his case for your\r\nconsideration, and respectfully recommend that he be nominated for\r\nrestoration to his original rank and place in the Army.\r\n\r\nI am, sir, with great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nJOHN B. FLOYD,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 7, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, in answer to\r\nthe resolution of the House of Representatives of the 4th instant,\r\nrequesting to be informed if any complaint had been made against our\r\nGovernment by the Government of Nicaragua on account of the recent\r\narrest of William Walker and his followers by Captain Paulding within\r\nthe territory of that Republic.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 7, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate a report from the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, with the accompanying documents, containing the information called\r\nfor by the resolution of the Senate of the 4th instant, requesting me\r\n\"to communicate to the Senate the correspondence, instructions, and\r\norders to the United States naval forces on the coast of Central America\r\nconnected with the arrest of William Walker and his associates,\" etc.\r\n\r\nIn submitting to the Senate the papers for which they have called I deem\r\nit proper to make a few observations.\r\n\r\nIn capturing General Walker and his command after they had landed on\r\nthe soil of Nicaragua Commodore Paulding has, in my opinion, committed\r\na grave error. It is quite evident, however, from the communications\r\nherewith transmitted that this was done from pure and patriotic motives\r\nand in the sincere conviction that he was promoting the interest and\r\nvindicating the honor of his country. In regard to Nicaragua, she has\r\nsustained no injury by the act of Commodore Paulding. This has inured to\r\nher benefit and relieved her from a dreaded invasion. She alone would\r\nhave any right to complain of the violation of her territory, and it is\r\nquite certain she will never exercise this right. It unquestionably does\r\nnot lie in the mouth of her invaders to complain in her name that she\r\nhas been rescued by Commodore Paulding from their assaults. The error of\r\nthis gallant officer consists in exceeding his instructions and landing\r\nhis sailors and marines in Nicaragua, whether with or without her\r\nconsent, for the purpose of making war upon any military force whatever\r\nwhich he might find in the country, no matter from whence they came.\r\nThis power certainly did not belong to him. Obedience to law and\r\nconformity to instructions are the best and safest guides for all\r\nofficers, civil and military, and when they transcend these limits and\r\nact upon their own personal responsibility evil consequences almost\r\ninevitably follow.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, when Marshal Rynders presented himself at the\r\nState Department on the 29th ultimo with General Walker in custody, the\r\nSecretary informed him \"that the executive department of the Government\r\ndid not recognize General Walker as a prisoner, that it had no\r\ndirections to give concerning him, and that it is only through the\r\naction of the judiciary that he could be lawfully held in custody to\r\nanswer any charges that might be brought against him.\"\r\n\r\nIn thus far disapproving the conduct of Commodore Paulding no inference\r\nmust be drawn that I am less determined than I have ever been to execute\r\nthe neutrality laws of the United States. This is my imperative\r\nduty, and I shall continue to perform it by all the means which the\r\nConstitution and the laws have placed in my power. My opinion of the\r\nvalue and importance of these laws corresponds entirely with that\r\nexpressed by Mr. Monroe in his message to Congress of December 7, 1819.\r\nThat wise, prudent, and patriotic statesman says:\r\n\r\n  It is of the highest importance to our national character and\r\n  indispensable to the morality of our citizens that all violations of\r\n  our neutrality should be prevented. No door should be left open for the\r\n  evasion of our laws, no opportunity afforded to any who may be disposed\r\n  to take advantage of it to compromit the interest or the honor of the\r\n  nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crime of setting on foot or providing the means for a military\r\nexpedition within the United States to make war against a foreign state\r\nwith which we are at peace is one of an aggravated and dangerous\r\ncharacter, and early engaged the attention of Congress. Whether\r\nthe executive government possesses any, or what, power under the\r\nConstitution, independently of Congress, to prevent or punish this\r\nand similar offenses against the law of nations was a subject which\r\nengaged the attention of our most eminent statesmen in the time of the\r\nAdministration of General Washington and on the occasion of the French\r\nRevolution. The act of Congress of the 5th of June, 1794, fortunately\r\nremoved all the difficulties on this question which had theretofore\r\nexisted. The fifth and seventh sections of this act, which relate to the\r\npresent question, are the same in substance with the sixth and eighth\r\nsections of the act of April 20, 1818, and have now been in force for\r\na period more than sixty years.\r\n\r\nThe military expedition rendered criminal by the act must have its\r\norigin, must \"begin\" or be \"set on foot,\" in the United States; but the\r\ngreat object of the law was to save foreign states with whom we were at\r\npeace from the ravages of these lawless expeditions proceeding from our\r\nshores. The seventh section alone, therefore, which simply defines the\r\ncrime and its punishment, would have been inadequate to accomplish this\r\npurpose and enforce our international duties. In order to render the\r\nlaw effectual it was necessary to prevent \"the carrying on\" of such\r\nexpeditions to their consummation after they had succeeded in leaving\r\nour shores. This has been done effectually and in clear and explicit\r\nlanguage by the authority given to the President under the eighth\r\nsection of the act to employ the land and naval forces of the United\r\nStates \"for the purpose of preventing the carrying on of any such\r\nexpedition or enterprise from the territories or jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States against the territories or dominions of any foreign prince\r\nor state or of any colony, district, or people with whom the United\r\nStates are at peace.\"\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, had Commodore Paulding intercepted the steamer\r\n_Fashion_, with General Walker and his command on board, at any period\r\nbefore they entered the port of San Juan de Nicaragua and conducted them\r\nback to Mobile, this would have prevented them from \"carrying on\" the\r\nexpedition and have been not only a justifiable but a praiseworthy act.\r\n\r\nThe crime well deserves the punishment inflicted upon it by our laws. It\r\nviolates the principles of Christianity, morality, and humanity, held\r\nsacred by all civilized nations and by none more than by the people of\r\nthe United States. Disguise it as we may, such a military expedition is\r\nan invitation to reckless and lawless men to enlist under the banner of\r\nany adventurer to rob, plunder, and murder the unoffending citizens of\r\nneighboring states, who have never done them harm. It is a usurpation\r\nof the war-making power, which belongs alone to Congress; and the\r\nGovernment itself, at least in the estimation of the world, becomes\r\nan accomplice in the commission of this crime unless it adopts all\r\nthe means necessary to prevent and to punish it.\r\n\r\nIt would be far better and more in accordance with the bold and manly\r\ncharacter of our countrymen for the Government itself to get up\r\nsuch expeditions than to allow them to proceed under the command of\r\nirresponsible adventurers. We could then at least exercise some control\r\nover our own agents and prevent them from burning down cities and\r\ncommitting other acts of enormity of which we have read.\r\n\r\nThe avowed principle which lies at the foundation of the law of nations\r\nis contained in the divine command that \"all things whatsoever ye would\r\nthat men should do to you do ye even so to them.\" Tried by this unerring\r\nrule, we should be severely condemned if we shall not use our best\r\nexertions to arrest such expeditions against our feeble sister Republic\r\nof Nicaragua. One thing is very certain, that a people never existed\r\nwho would call any other nation to a stricter account than we should\r\nourselves for tolerating lawless expeditions from their shores to make\r\nwar upon any portion of our territories. By tolerating such expeditions\r\nwe shall soon lose the high character which we have enjoyed ever since\r\nthe days of Washington for the faithful performance of our international\r\nobligations and duties, and inspire distrust against us among the\r\nmembers of the great family of civilized nations.\r\n\r\nBut if motives of duty were not sufficient to restrain us from engaging\r\nin such lawless enterprises, our evident interest ought to dictate this\r\npolicy. These expeditions are the most effectual mode of retarding\r\nAmerican progress, although to promote this is the avowed object of the\r\nleaders and contributors in such undertakings.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond question the destiny of our race to spread themselves over\r\nthe continent of North America, and this at no distant day should events\r\nbe permitted to take their natural course. The tide of emigrants will\r\nflow to the south, and nothing can eventually arrest its progress. If\r\npermitted to go there peacefully, Central America will soon contain an\r\nAmerican population which will confer blessings and benefits as well\r\nupon the natives as their respective Governments. Liberty under the\r\nrestraint of law will preserve domestic peace, whilst the different\r\ntransit routes across the Isthmus, in which we are so deeply interested,\r\nwill have assured protection.\r\n\r\nNothing has retarded this happy condition of affairs so much as the\r\nunlawful expeditions which have been fitted out in the United States to\r\nmake war upon the Central American States. Had one-half the number of\r\nAmerican citizens who have miserably perished in the first disastrous\r\nexpedition of General Walker settled in Nicaragua as peaceful emigrants,\r\nthe object which we all desire would ere this have been in a great\r\ndegree accomplished. These expeditions have caused the people of the\r\nCentral American States to regard us with dread and suspicion. It is our\r\ntrue policy to remove this apprehension and to convince them that we\r\nintend to do them good, and not evil. We desire, as the leading power on\r\nthis continent, to open and, if need be, to protect every transit route\r\nacross the Isthmus, not only for our own benefit, but that of the world,\r\nand thus open a free access to Central America, and through it to our\r\nPacific possessions. This policy was commenced under favorable auspices\r\nwhen the expedition under the command of General Walker escaped from our\r\nterritories and proceeded to Punta Arenas. Should another expedition\r\nof a similar character again evade the vigilance of our officers and\r\nproceed to Nicaragua, this would be fatal, at least for a season, to the\r\npeaceful settlement of these countries and to the policy of American\r\nprogress. The truth is that no Administration can successfully conduct\r\nthe foreign affairs of the country in Central America or anywhere else\r\nif it is to be interfered with at every step by lawless military\r\nexpeditions \"set on foot\" in the United States.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 11, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received from Samuel Medary, governor of the Territory of\r\nMinnesota, a copy of the constitution of Minnesota, \"together with an\r\nabstract of the votes polled for and against said constitution\" at the\r\nelection held in that Territory on the second Tuesday of October last,\r\ncertified by the governor in due form, which I now lay before Congress\r\nin the manner prescribed by that instrument.\r\n\r\nHaving received but a single copy of the constitution, I transmit this\r\nto the Senate.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 11, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives the reports of\r\nthe Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of the Navy, and of the\r\nAttorney-General, with the accompanying documents, containing the\r\ninformation called for by the resolution of the House of the 4th\r\ninstant, concerning \"the late seizure of General William Walker and\r\nhis followers in Nicaragua,\" etc.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and the Republic of\r\nPeru, signed on the 4th July last at Lima by the plenipotentiaries of\r\nthe contracting parties, with regard to the interpretation to be given\r\nto article 12 of the treaty of the 26th July, 1851.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\nJANUARY 12, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 14, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of a convention between the United States\r\nand His Majesty the King of Denmark, for the discontinuance of the Sound\r\ndues, the ratifications of which were exchanged in this city on the\r\n12th instant, and recommend that an appropriation be made to enable the\r\nExecutive seasonably to carry into effect the stipulations in regard to\r\nthe sums payable to His Danish Majesty's Government.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 27, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 7th instant,\r\nrequesting information on the subject of contracts made in Europe for\r\ninland-passage tickets for intending emigrants to the United States,\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the documents by\r\nwhich it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 28, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, under date of the 27th instant, with the\r\naccompanying papers, in compliance with a resolution adopted by the\r\nHouse on the 18th instant, requesting the President to communicate to\r\nthat body \"whether the census of the Territory of Minnesota has been\r\ntaken in accordance with the provisions of the fourth section of the\r\nact of Congress providing for the admission of Minnesota as a State,\r\napproved February 26, 1857, and if said census has been taken and\r\nreturned to him or any Department of the Government to communicate the\r\nsame to this House, and if the said census has not been so taken and\r\nreturned to state the reasons, if any exist to his knowledge, why it\r\nhas not been done.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 2, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received from J. Calhoun, esq., president of the late\r\nconstitutional convention of Kansas, a copy, duly certified by himself,\r\nof the constitution framed by that body, with the expression of a hope\r\nthat I would submit the same to the consideration of Congress \"with the\r\nview of the admission of Kansas into the Union as an independent State.\"\r\nIn compliance with this request, I herewith transmit to Congress, for\r\ntheir action, the constitution of Kansas, with the ordinance respecting\r\nthe public lands, as well as the letter of Mr. Calhoun, dated at\r\nLecompton on the 14th ultimo, by which they were accompanied. Having\r\nreceived but a single copy of the constitution and ordinance, I send\r\nthis to the Senate.\r\n\r\nA great delusion seems to pervade the public mind in relation to the\r\ncondition of parties in Kansas. This arises from the difficulty of\r\ninducing the American people to realize the fact that any portion of\r\nthem should be in a state of rebellion against the government under\r\nwhich they live. When we speak of the affairs of Kansas, we are apt to\r\nrefer merely to the existence of two violent political parties in that\r\nTerritory, divided on the question of slavery, just as we speak of such\r\nparties in the States. This presents no adequate idea of the true state\r\nof the case. The dividing line there is not between two political\r\nparties, both acknowledging the lawful existence of the government,\r\nbut between those who are loyal to this government and those who have\r\nendeavored to destroy its existence by force and by usurpation--between\r\nthose who sustain and those who have done all in their power to\r\noverthrow the Territorial government established by Congress. This\r\ngovernment they would long since have subverted had it not been\r\nprotected from their assaults by the troops of the United States. Such\r\nhas been the condition of affairs since my inauguration. Ever since\r\nthat period a large portion of the people of Kansas have been in a state\r\nof rebellion against the government, with a military leader at their\r\nhead of a most turbulent and dangerous character. They have never\r\nacknowledged, but have constantly renounced and defied, the government\r\nto which they owe allegiance, and have been all the time in a state\r\nof resistance against its authority. They have all the time been\r\nendeavoring to subvert it and to establish a revolutionary government,\r\nunder the so-called Topeka constitution, in its stead. Even at this very\r\nmoment the Topeka legislature are in session. Whoever has read the\r\ncorrespondence of Governor Walker with the State Department, recently\r\ncommunicated to the Senate, will be convinced that this picture is not\r\noverdrawn. He always protested against the withdrawal of any portion of\r\nthe military force of the United States from the Territory, deeming\r\nits presence absolutely necessary for the preservation of the regular\r\ngovernment and the execution of the laws. In his very first dispatch\r\nto the Secretary of State, dated June 2, 1857, he says:\r\n\r\n  The most alarming movement, however, proceeds from the assembling on\r\n  the 9th June of the so-called Topeka legislature, with a view to the\r\n  enactment of an entire code of laws. Of course it will be my endeavor\r\n  to prevent such a result, as it would lead to inevitable and disastrous\r\n  collision, and, in fact, renew the civil war in Kansas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was with difficulty prevented by the efforts of Governor Walker;\r\nbut soon thereafter, on the 14th of July, we find him requesting General\r\nHarney to furnish him a regiment of dragoons to proceed to the city\r\nof Lawrence; and this for the reason that he had received authentic\r\nintelligence, verified by his own actual observation, that a dangerous\r\nrebellion had occurred, \"involving an open defiance of the laws and\r\nthe establishment of an insurgent government in that city.\"\r\n\r\nIn the governor's dispatch of July 15 he informs the Secretary of\r\nState that--\r\n\r\n  This movement at Lawrence was the beginning of a plan, originating\r\n  in that city, to organize insurrection throughout the Territory,\r\n  and especially in all towns, cities, or counties where the Republican\r\n  party have a majority. Lawrence is the hotbed of all the abolition\r\n  movements in this Territory. It is the town established by the\r\n  abolition societies of the East, and whilst there are respectable\r\n  people there, it is filled by a considerable number of mercenaries who\r\n  are paid by abolition societies to perpetuate and diffuse agitation\r\n  throughout Kansas and prevent a peaceful settlement of this question.\r\n  Having failed in inducing their own so-called Topeka State legislature\r\n  to organize this insurrection, Lawrence has commenced it herself, and\r\n  if not arrested the rebellion will extend throughout the Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n  In order to send this communication immediately by mail, I must close\r\n  by assuring you that the spirit of rebellion pervades the great mass\r\n  of the Republican party of this Territory, instigated, as I entertain\r\n  no doubt they are, by Eastern societies, having in view results most\r\n  disastrous to the government and to the Union; and that the continued\r\n  presence of General Harney here is indispensable, as originally\r\n  stipulated by me, with a large body of dragoons and several batteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 20th July, 1857, General Lane, under the authority of the Topeka\r\nconvention, undertook, as Governor Walker informs us--\r\n\r\n  to organize the whole so-called Free-State party into volunteers and\r\n  to take the names of all who refuse enrollment. The professed object\r\n  is to protect the polls, at the election in August, of the new\r\n  insurgent Topeka State legislature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The object of taking the names of all who refuse enrollment is to\r\n  terrify the Free-State conservatives into submission. This is proved\r\n  by recent atrocities committed on such men by Topekaites. The speedy\r\n  location of large bodies of regular troops here, with two batteries,\r\n  is necessary. The Lawrence insurgents await the development of this\r\n  new revolutionary military organization....\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the governor's dispatch of July 27 he says that \"General Lane and his\r\nstaff everywhere deny the authority of the Territorial laws and counsel\r\na total disregard of these enactments.\"\r\n\r\nWithout making further quotations of a similar character from other\r\ndispatches of Governor Walker, it appears by a reference to Mr.\r\nStanton's communication to General Cass of the 9th of December last that\r\nthe \"important step of calling the legislature together was taken after\r\nI [he] had become satisfied that the election ordered by the convention\r\non the 21st instant could not be conducted without collision and\r\nbloodshed.\" So intense was the disloyal feeling among the enemies of the\r\ngovernment established by Congress that an election which afforded them\r\nan opportunity, if in the majority, of making Kansas a free State,\r\naccording to their own professed desire, could not be conducted without\r\ncollision and bloodshed.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that up till the present moment the enemies of the\r\nexisting government still adhere to their Topeka revolutionary\r\nconstitution and government. The very first paragraph of the message\r\nof Governor Robinson, dated on the 7th of December, to the Topeka\r\nlegislature now assembled at Lawrence contains an open defiance of\r\nthe Constitution and laws of the United States. The governor says:\r\n\r\n  The convention which framed the constitution at Topeka originated\r\n  with the people of Kansas Territory. They have adopted and ratified\r\n  the same twice by a direct vote, and also indirectly through two\r\n  elections of State officers and members of the State legislature.\r\n  Yet it has pleased the Administration to regard the whole proceeding\r\n  revolutionary.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Topeka government, adhered to with such treasonable pertinacity, is\r\na government in direct opposition to the existing government prescribed\r\nand recognized by Congress. It is a usurpation of the same character as\r\nit would be for a portion of the people of any State of the Union to\r\nundertake to establish a separate government within its limits for\r\nthe purpose of redressing any grievance, real or imaginary, of which\r\nthey might complain against the legitimate State government. Such a\r\nprinciple, if carried into execution, would destroy all lawful authority\r\nand produce universal anarchy.\r\n\r\nFrom this statement of facts the reason becomes palpable why the enemies\r\nof the government authorized by Congress have refused to vote for\r\ndelegates to the Kansas constitutional convention, and also afterwards\r\non the question of slavery, submitted by it to the people. It is because\r\nthey have ever refused to sanction or recognize any other constitution\r\nthan that framed at Topeka.\r\n\r\nHad the whole Lecompton constitution been submitted to the people the\r\nadherents of this organization would doubtless have voted against it,\r\nbecause if successful they would thus have removed an obstacle out of\r\nthe way of their own revolutionary constitution. They would have done\r\nthis, not upon a consideration of the merits of the whole or any part of\r\nthe Lecompton constitution, but simply because they have ever resisted\r\nthe authority of the government authorized by Congress, from which it\r\nemanated.\r\n\r\nSuch being the unfortunate condition of affairs in the Territory, what\r\nwas the right as well as the duty of the law-abiding people? Were they\r\nsilently and patiently to submit to the Topeka usurpation, or adopt the\r\nnecessary measures to establish a constitution under the authority of\r\nthe organic law of Congress?\r\n\r\nThat this law recognized the right of the people of the Territory,\r\nwithout any enabling act from Congress, to form a State constitution\r\nis too clear for argument. For Congress \"to leave the people of the\r\nTerritory perfectly free,\" in framing their constitution, \"to form and\r\nregulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States,\" and then to say that they shall\r\nnot be permitted to proceed and frame a constitution in their own way\r\nwithout an express authority from Congress, appears to be almost a\r\ncontradiction in terms. It would be much more plausible to contend\r\nthat Congress had no power to pass such an enabling act than to argue\r\nthat the people of a Territory might be kept out of the Union for an\r\nindefinite period, and until it might please Congress to permit them\r\nto exercise the right of self-government. This would be to adopt not\r\n\"their own way,\" but the way which Congress might prescribe.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that any people could have proceeded with more\r\nregularity in the formation of a constitution than the people of Kansas\r\nhave done. It was necessary, first, to ascertain whether it was the\r\ndesire of the people to be relieved from their Territorial dependence\r\nand establish a State government. For this purpose the Territorial\r\nlegislature in 1855 passed a law \"for taking the sense of the people\r\nof this Territory upon the expediency of calling a convention to form\r\na State constitution,\" at the general election to be held in October,\r\n1856. The \"sense of the people\" was accordingly taken and they decided\r\nin favor of a convention. It is true that at this election the enemies\r\nof the Territorial government did not vote, because they were then\r\nengaged at Topeka, without the slightest pretext of lawful authority,\r\nin framing a constitution of their own for the purpose of subverting\r\nthe Territorial government.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this decision of the people in favor of a convention,\r\nthe Territorial legislature, on the 27th day of February, 1857, passed\r\nan act for the election of delegates on the third Monday of June, 1857,\r\nto frame a State constitution. This law is as fair in its provisions as\r\nany that ever passed a legislative body for a similar purpose. The right\r\nof suffrage at this election is clearly and justly defined. \"Every _bona\r\nfide_ inhabitant of the Territory of Kansas,\" on the third Monday of\r\nJune, the day of the election, who was a citizen of the United States\r\nabove the age of 21, and had resided therein for three months previous\r\nto that date, was entitled to vote. In order to avoid all interference\r\nfrom neighboring States or Territories with the freedom and fairness of\r\nthe election, provision was made for the registry of the qualified\r\nvoters, and in pursuance thereof 9,251 voters were registered. Governor\r\nWalker did his whole duty in urging all the qualified citizens of Kansas\r\nto vote at this election. In his inaugural address, on the 27th May\r\nlast, he informed them that--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Under our practice the preliminary act of framing a State constitution\r\n  is uniformly performed through the instrumentality of a convention of\r\n  delegates chosen by the people themselves. That convention is now about\r\n  to be elected by you under the call of the Territorial legislature,\r\n  created and still recognized by the authority of Congress and clothed\r\n  by it, in the comprehensive language of the organic law, with full\r\n  power to make such an enactment. The Territorial legislature, then,\r\n  in assembling this convention, were fully sustained by the act of\r\n  Congress, and the authority of the convention is distinctly recognized\r\n  in my instructions from the President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe governor also clearly and distinctly warns them what would be the\r\nconsequences if they should not participate in the election.\r\n\r\n  The people of Kansas, then [he says], are invited by the highest\r\n  authority known to the Constitution to participate freely and fairly\r\n  in the election of delegates to frame a constitution and State\r\n  government. The law has performed its entire appropriate function\r\n  when it extends to the people the right of suffrage, but it can not\r\n  compel the performance of that duty. Throughout our whole Union,\r\n  however, and wherever free government prevails those who abstain from\r\n  the exercise of the right of suffrage authorize those who do vote to\r\n  act for them in that contingency; and the absentees are as much bound\r\n  under the law and Constitution, where there is no fraud or violence,\r\n  by the act of the majority of those who do vote as if all had\r\n  participated in the election. Otherwise, as voting must be voluntary,\r\n  self-government would be impracticable and monarchy or despotism would\r\n  remain as the only alternative.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may also be observed that at this period any hope, if such had\r\nexisted, that the Topeka constitution would ever be recognized by\r\nCongress must have been abandoned. Congress had adjourned on the 3d\r\nMarch previous, having recognized the legal existence of the Territorial\r\nlegislature in a variety of forms, which I need not enumerate. Indeed,\r\nthe Delegate elected to the House of Representatives under a Territorial\r\nlaw had been admitted to his seat and had just completed his term of\r\nservice on the day previous to my inauguration.\r\n\r\nThis was the propitious moment for settling all difficulties in Kansas.\r\nThis was the time for abandoning the revolutionary Topeka organization\r\nand for the enemies of the existing government to conform to the laws\r\nand to unite with its friends in framing a State constitution; but this\r\nthey refused to do, and the consequences of their refusal to submit to\r\nlawful authority and vote at the election of delegates may yet prove\r\nto be of a most deplorable character. Would that the respect for the\r\nlaws of the land which so eminently distinguished the men of the past\r\ngeneration could be revived. It is a disregard and violation of law\r\nwhich have for years kept the Territory of Kansas in a state of almost\r\nopen rebellion against its government. It is the same spirit which has\r\nproduced actual rebellion in Utah. Our only safety consists in obedience\r\nand conformity to law. Should a general spirit against its enforcement\r\nprevail, this will prove fatal to us as a nation. We acknowledge no\r\nmaster but the law, and should we cut loose from its restraints and\r\neveryone do what seemeth good in his own eyes our case will indeed be\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\nThe enemies of the Territorial government determined still to resist\r\nthe authority of Congress. They refused to vote for delegates to the\r\nconvention, not because, from circumstances which I need not detail,\r\nthere was an omission to register the comparatively few voters who were\r\ninhabitants of certain counties of Kansas in the early spring of 1857,\r\nbut because they had predetermined at all hazards to adhere to their\r\nrevolutionary organization and defeat the establishment of any other\r\nconstitution than that which they had framed at Topeka. The election was\r\ntherefore suffered to pass by default. But of this result the qualified\r\nelectors who refused to vote can never justly complain.\r\n\r\nFrom this review it is manifest that the Lecompton convention, according\r\nto every principle of constitutional law, was legally constituted and\r\nwas invested with power to frame a constitution.\r\n\r\nThe sacred principle of popular sovereignty has been invoked in favor\r\nof the enemies of law and order in Kansas. But in what manner is\r\npopular sovereignty to be exercised in this country if not through\r\nthe instrumentality of established law? In certain small republics\r\nof ancient times the people did assemble in primary meetings, passed\r\nlaws, and directed public affairs. In our country this is manifestly\r\nimpossible. Popular sovereignty can be exercised here only through the\r\nballot box; and if the people will refuse to exercise it in this manner,\r\nas they have done in Kansas at the election of delegates, it is not for\r\nthem to complain that their rights have been violated.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas convention, thus lawfully constituted, proceeded to frame a\r\nconstitution, and, having completed their work, finally adjourned on the\r\n7th day of November last. They did not think proper to submit the whole\r\nof this constitution to a popular vote, but they did submit the question\r\nwhether Kansas should be a free or a slave State to the people. This was\r\nthe question which had convulsed the Union and shaken it to its very\r\ncenter. This was the question which had lighted up the flames of civil\r\nwar in Kansas and had produced dangerous sectional parties throughout\r\nthe Confederacy. It was of a character so paramount in respect to the\r\ncondition of Kansas as to rivet the anxious attention of the people of\r\nthe whole country upon it, and it alone. No person thought of any other\r\nquestion. For my own part, when I instructed Governor Walker in general\r\nterms in favor of submitting the constitution to the people, I had no\r\nobject in view except the all-absorbing question of slavery. In what\r\nmanner the people of Kansas might regulate their other concerns was not\r\na subject which attracted any attention. In fact, the general provisions\r\nof our recent State constitutions, after an experience of eight years,\r\nare so similar and so excellent that it would be difficult to go far\r\nwrong at the present day in framing a new constitution.\r\n\r\nI then believed and still believe that under the organic act the Kansas\r\nconvention were bound to submit this all-important question of slavery\r\nto the people. It was never, however, my opinion that, independently\r\nof this act, they would have been bound to submit any portion of the\r\nconstitution to a popular vote in order to give it validity. Had I\r\nentertained such an opinion, this would have been in opposition to\r\nmany precedents in our history, commencing in the very best age of\r\nthe Republic. It would have been in opposition to the principle which\r\npervades our institutions, and which is every day carried out into\r\npractice, that the people have the right to delegate to representatives\r\nchosen by themselves their sovereign power to frame constitutions, enact\r\nlaws, and perform many other important acts without requiring that these\r\nshould be subjected to their subsequent approbation. It would be a most\r\ninconvenient limitation of their own power, imposed by the people upon\r\nthemselves, to exclude them from exercising their sovereignty in any\r\nlawful manner they think proper. It is true that the people of Kansas\r\nmight, if they had pleased, have required the convention to submit the\r\nconstitution to a popular vote; but this they have not done. The only\r\nremedy, therefore, in this case is that which exists in all other\r\nsimilar cases. If the delegates who framed the Kansas constitution have\r\nin any manner violated the will of their constituents, the people always\r\npossess the power to change their constitution or their laws according\r\nto their own pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe question of slavery was submitted to an election of the people of\r\nKansas on the 21st December last, in obedience to the mandate of the\r\nconstitution. Here again a fair opportunity was presented to the\r\nadherents of the Topeka constitution, if they were the majority, to\r\ndecide this exciting question \"in their own way\" and thus restore peace\r\nto the distracted Territory; but they again refused to exercise their\r\nright of popular sovereignty, and again suffered the election to pass\r\nby default.\r\n\r\nI heartily rejoice that a wiser and better spirit prevailed among a\r\nlarge majority of these people on the first Monday of January, and that\r\nthey did on that day vote under the Lecompton constitution for a\r\ngovernor and other State officers, a Member of Congress, and for members\r\nof the legislature. This election was warmly contested by the parties,\r\nand a larger vote was polled than at any previous election in the\r\nTerritory. We may now reasonably hope that the revolutionary Topeka\r\norganization will be speedily and finally abandoned, and this will go\r\nfar toward the final settlement of the unhappy differences in Kansas.\r\nIf frauds have been committed at this election, either by one or both\r\nparties, the legislature and the people of Kansas, under their\r\nconstitution, will know how to redress themselves and punish these\r\ndetestable but too common crimes without any outside interference.\r\n\r\nThe people of Kansas have, then, \"in their own way\" and in strict\r\naccordance with the organic act, framed a constitution and State\r\ngovernment, have submitted the all-important question of slavery to the\r\npeople, and have elected a governor, a Member to represent them in\r\nCongress, members of the State legislature, and other State officers.\r\nThey now ask admission into the Union under this constitution, which is\r\nrepublican in its form. It is for Congress to decide whether they will\r\nadmit or reject the State which has thus been created. For my own\r\npart, I am decidedly in favor of its admission, and thus terminating\r\nthe Kansas question. This will carry out the great principle of\r\nnonintervention recognized and sanctioned by the organic act, which\r\ndeclares in express language in favor of \"nonintervention by Congress\r\nwith slavery in the States or Territories,\" leaving \"the people thereof\r\nperfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their\r\nown way, subject only to the Constitution of the United States.\" In this\r\nmanner, by localizing the question of slavery and confining it to the\r\npeople whom it immediately concerned, every patriot anxiously expected\r\nthat this question would be banished from the halls of Congress, where\r\nit has always exerted a baneful influence throughout the whole country.\r\n\r\nIt is proper that I should briefly refer to the election held under\r\nan act of the Territorial legislature on the first Monday of January\r\nlast on the Lecompton constitution. This election was held after the\r\nTerritory had been prepared for admission into the Union as a sovereign\r\nState, and when no authority existed in the Territorial legislature\r\nwhich could possibly destroy its existence or change its character.\r\nThe election, which was peaceably conducted under my instructions,\r\ninvolved a strange inconsistency. A large majority of the persons who\r\nvoted against the Lecompton constitution were at the very same time and\r\nplace recognizing its valid existence in the most solemn and authentic\r\nmanner by voting under its provisions. I have yet received no official\r\ninformation of the result of this election.\r\n\r\nAs a question of expediency, after the right has been maintained, it may\r\nbe wise to reflect upon the benefits to Kansas and to the whole country\r\nwhich would result from its immediate admission into the Union, as well\r\nas the disasters which may follow its rejection. Domestic peace will\r\nbe the happy consequence of its admission, and that fine Territory,\r\nwhich has hitherto been torn by dissensions, will rapidly increase\r\nin population and wealth and speedily realize the blessings and the\r\ncomforts which follow in the train of agricultural and mechanical\r\nindustry. The people will then be sovereign and can regulate their own\r\naffairs in their own way. If a majority of them desire to abolish\r\ndomestic slavery within the State, there is no other possible mode by\r\nwhich this can be effected so speedily as by prompt admission. The will\r\nof the majority is supreme and irresistible when expressed in an orderly\r\nand lawful manner. They can make and unmake constitutions at pleasure.\r\nIt would be absurd to say that they can impose fetters upon their own\r\npower which they can not afterwards remove. If they could do this, they\r\nmight tie their own hands for a hundred as well as for ten years. These\r\nare fundamental principles of American freedom, and are recognized,\r\nI believe, in some form or other by every State constitution; and if\r\nCongress, in the act of admission, should think proper to recognize\r\nthem I can perceive no objection to such a course. This has been done\r\nemphatically in the constitution of Kansas. It declares in the bill\r\nof rights that \"all political power is inherent in the people and all\r\nfree governments are founded on their authority and instituted for\r\ntheir benefit, and therefore they have at all times an inalienable and\r\nindefeasible right to alter, reform, or abolish their form of government\r\nin such manner as they may think proper.\" The great State of New York is\r\nat this moment governed under a constitution framed and established in\r\ndirect opposition to the mode prescribed by the previous constitution.\r\nIf, therefore, the provision changing the Kansas constitution after the\r\nyear 1864 could by possibility be construed into a prohibition to make\r\nsuch a change previous to that period, this prohibition would be wholly\r\nunavailing. The legislature already elected may at its very first\r\nsession submit the question to a vote of the people whether they will\r\nor will not have a convention to amend their constitution and adopt\r\nall necessary means for giving effect to the popular will.\r\n\r\nIt has been solemnly adjudged by the highest judicial tribunal known to\r\nour laws that slavery exists in Kansas by virtue of the Constitution of\r\nthe United States. Kansas is therefore at this moment as much a slave\r\nState as Georgia or South Carolina. Without this the equality of the\r\nsovereign States composing the Union would be violated and the use and\r\nenjoyment of a territory acquired by the common treasure of all the\r\nStates would be closed against the people and the property of nearly\r\nhalf the members of the Confederacy. Slavery can therefore never be\r\nprohibited in Kansas except by means of a constitutional provision, and\r\nin no other manner can this be obtained so promptly, if a majority of\r\nthe people desire it, as by admitting it into the Union under its\r\npresent constitution.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, should Congress reject the constitution under the\r\nidea of affording the disaffected in Kansas a third opportunity of\r\nprohibiting slavery in the State, which they might have done twice\r\nbefore if in the majority, no man can foretell the consequences.\r\n\r\nIf Congress, for the sake of those men who refused to vote for delegates\r\nto the convention when they might have excluded slavery from the\r\nconstitution, and who afterwards refused to vote on the 21st December\r\nlast, when they might, as they claim, have stricken slavery from the\r\nconstitution, should now reject the State because slavery remains in the\r\nconstitution, it is manifest that the agitation upon this dangerous\r\nsubject will be renewed in a more alarming form than it has ever yet\r\nassumed.\r\n\r\nEvery patriot in the country had indulged the hope that the Kansas and\r\nNebraska act would put a final end to the slavery agitation, at least in\r\nCongress, which had for more than twenty years convulsed the country\r\nand endangered the Union. This act involved great and fundamental\r\nprinciples, and if fairly carried into effect will settle the question.\r\nShould the agitation be again revived, should the people of the sister\r\nStates be again estranged from each other with more than their former\r\nbitterness, this will arise from a cause, so far as the interests of\r\nKansas are concerned, more trifling and insignificant than has ever\r\nstirred the elements of a great people into commotion. To the people of\r\nKansas the only practical difference between admission or rejection\r\ndepends simply upon the fact whether they can themselves more speedily\r\nchange the present constitution if it does not accord with the will of\r\nthe majority, or frame a second constitution to be submitted to Congress\r\nhereafter. Even if this were a question of mere expediency, and not of\r\nright, the small difference of time one way or the other is of not the\r\nleast importance when contrasted with the evils which must necessarily\r\nresult to the whole country from a revival of the slavery agitation.\r\n\r\nIn considering this question it should never be forgotten that in\r\nproportion to its insignificance, let the decision be what it may so far\r\nas it may affect the few thousand inhabitants of Kansas who have from\r\nthe beginning resisted the constitution and the laws, for this very\r\nreason the rejection of the constitution will be so much the more keenly\r\nfelt by the people of fourteen of the States of this Union, where\r\nslavery is recognized under the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nAgain, the speedy admission of Kansas into the Union would restore peace\r\nand quiet to the whole country. Already the affairs of this Territory\r\nhave engrossed an undue proportion of public attention. They have sadly\r\naffected the friendly relations of the people of the States with each\r\nother and alarmed the fears of patriots for the safety of the Union.\r\nKansas once admitted into the Union, the excitement becomes localized\r\nand will soon die away for want of outside aliment. Then every\r\ndifficulty will be settled at the ballot box.\r\n\r\nBesides--and this is no trifling consideration--I shall then be enabled\r\nto withdraw the troops of the United States from Kansas and employ them\r\non branches of service where they are much needed. They have been kept\r\nthere, on the earnest importunity of Governor Walker, to maintain the\r\nexistence of the Territorial government and secure the execution of\r\nthe laws. He considered that at least 2,000 regular troops, under the\r\ncommand of General Harney, were necessary for this purpose. Acting\r\nupon his reliable information, I have been obliged in some degree to\r\ninterfere with the expedition to Utah in order to keep down rebellion in\r\nKansas. This has involved a very heavy expense to the Government. Kansas\r\nonce admitted, it is believed there will no longer be any occasion there\r\nfor troops of the United States.\r\n\r\nI have thus performed my duty on this important question, under a deep\r\nsense of responsibility to God and my country. My public life will\r\nterminate within a brief period, and I have no other object of earthly\r\nambition than to leave my country in a peaceful and prosperous condition\r\nand to live in the affections and respect of my countrymen. The dark\r\nand ominous clouds which now appear to be impending over the Union\r\nI conscientiously believe may be dissipated with honor to every portion\r\nof it by the admission of Kansas during the present session of Congress,\r\nwhereas if she should be rejected I greatly fear these clouds will\r\nbecome darker and more ominous than any which have ever yet threatened\r\nthe Constitution and the Union.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention for the purpose of further regulating the\r\nintercourse of American citizens within the Empire of Japan, signed at\r\nSimoda on the 17th day of June last by Townsend Harris, consul-general\r\nof the United States, and by the governors of Simoda, empowered for that\r\npurpose by their respective Governments.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 10, 1858.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 11, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, an additional article to the extradition convention\r\nbetween the United States and France of the 9th of November, 1843, and\r\nthe additional article thereto of the 24th February, 1845, signed in\r\nthis city yesterday by the Secretary of State and the minister of His\r\nImperial Majesty the Emperor of the French.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 12, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a report from the Secretary of State, with the\r\naccompanying documents, in reply to the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 18th ultimo, requesting to be furnished with\r\nofficial information and correspondence in relation to the execution\r\nof Colonel Crabb and his associates within or near the limits of the\r\nRepublic of Mexico.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _February 26, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives the reports\r\nof the Secretaries of State, of War, of the Interior, and of the\r\nAttorney-General, containing the information called for by a resolution\r\nof the House of the 27th ultimo, requesting \"the President, if not\r\nincompatible with the public interest, to communicate to the House\r\nof Representatives the information which gave rise to the military\r\nexpeditions ordered to Utah Territory, the instructions to the army\r\nofficers in connection with the same, and all correspondence which\r\nhas taken place with said army officers, with Brigham Young and his\r\nfollowers, or with others throwing light upon the question as to how\r\nfar said Brigham Young and his followers are in a state of rebellion\r\nor resistance to the Government of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 2, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate a report from the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, dated on the 24th instant [ultimo], furnishing the information\r\ncalled for by a resolution of the Senate adopted on the 16th instant\r\n[ultimo], requesting me \"to inform the Senate in executive session\r\non what evidence the nominees for the Marine Corps are stated to be\r\ntaken from the States as designated in his message communicating the\r\nnominations of January 13.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _March 4, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives communications from\r\nthe Secretary of War and Secretary of the Interior, in answer to the\r\nresolution adopted by the House on the 5th ultimo, requesting the\r\nPresident to furnish certain information in relation to the number of\r\ntroops, whether regulars, volunteers, drafted men, or militia, who were\r\nengaged in the service of the United States in the last war with Great\r\nBritain, etc.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 9, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Attorney-General, with accompanying\r\npapers, dated March 1, 1858, detailing proceedings under the act\r\napproved March 3, 1855, entitled \"An act to improve the laws of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia and to codify the same.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 23, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n26th of January, requesting the President to communicate to the House\r\n\"so much of the correspondence between the late Secretary of War and\r\nMajor-General John E.

From this there is reason to\r\nbelieve that our difficulties with the Territory of Utah have terminated\r\nand the reign of the Constitution and the laws has been restored.\r\nI congratulate you on this auspicious event.\r\n\r\nI lose no time in communicating this information and in expressing the\r\nopinion that there will now be no occasion to make any appropriation for\r\nthe purpose of calling into service the two regiments of volunteers\r\nauthorized by the act of Congress approved on the 7th of April last for\r\nthe purpose of quelling disturbances in the Territory of Utah, for the\r\nprotection of supply and emigrant trains, and the suppression of Indian\r\nhostilities on the frontier.\r\n\r\nI am the more gratified at this satisfactory intelligence from Utah\r\nbecause it will afford some relief to the Treasury at a time demanding\r\nfrom us the strictest economy, and when the question which now arises\r\nupon every new appropriation is whether it be of a character so\r\nimportant and urgent as to brook no delay and to justify and require\r\na loan and most probably a tax upon the people to raise the money\r\nnecessary for its payment.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the regiment of volunteers authorized by the same act of\r\nCongress to be called into service for the defense of the frontiers of\r\nTexas against Indian hostilities, I desire to leave this question to\r\nCongress, observing at the same time that in my opinion the State can be\r\ndefended for the present by the regular troops which have not yet been\r\nwithdrawn from its limits.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 11, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 19th ultimo, respecting\r\nthe Isthmus of Tehuantepec, I transmit herewith a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, with the documents by which it is accompanied,\r\ntogether with the copy of a letter from the Postmaster-General of the\r\n21st ultimo to the Department of State.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _June 11, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of War, with the\r\naccompanying papers,[8] in obedience to the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 2d of June, 1858.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Copies of contracts for deepening the channels of the\r\nSouthwest Pass and Pass à l'Outre, at the mouth of the Mississippi\r\nRiver, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _June 12, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI feel it to be an indispensable duty to call your attention to the\r\ncondition of the Treasury. On the 19th day of May last the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury submitted a report to Congress \"on the present condition of\r\nthe finances of the Government.\" In this report he states that after a\r\ncall upon the heads of Departments he had received official information\r\nthat the sum of $37,000,000 would probably be required during the first\r\ntwo quarters of the next fiscal year, from the 1st of July until the\r\n1st of January. \"This sum,\" the Secretary says, \"does not include such\r\namounts as may be appropriated by Congress over and above the estimates\r\nsubmitted to them by the Departments, and I have no data on which to\r\nestimate for such expenditures. Upon this point Congress is better able\r\nto form a correct opinion than I am.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary then estimates that the receipts into the Treasury from\r\nall sources between the 1st of July and the 1st of January would amount\r\nto $25,000,000, leaving a deficit of $15,000,000, inclusive of the sum\r\nof about $3,000,000, the least amount required to be in the Treasury\r\nat all times to secure its successful operation. For this amount he\r\nrecommends a loan. This loan, it will be observed, was required, after a\r\nclose calculation, to meet the estimates from the different Departments,\r\nand not such appropriations as might be made by Congress over and above\r\nthese estimates.\r\n\r\nThere was embraced in this sum of $15,000,000 estimates to the amount of\r\nabout $1,750,000 for the three volunteer regiments authorized by the act\r\nof Congress approved April 7, 1858, for two of which, if not for the\r\nthird, no appropriation will now be required. To this extent a portion\r\nof the loan of $15,000,000 may be applied to pay the appropriations\r\nmade by Congress beyond the estimates from the different Departments,\r\nreferred to in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nTo what extent a probable deficiency may exist in the Treasury between\r\nthe 1st July and the 1st January next can not be ascertained until the\r\nappropriation bills, as well as the private bills containing\r\nappropriations, shall have finally passed.\r\n\r\nAdversity teaches useful lessons to nations as well as individuals. The\r\nhabit of extravagant expenditures, fostered by a large surplus in the\r\nTreasury, must now be corrected or the country will be involved in\r\nserious financial difficulties.\r\n\r\nUnder any form of government extravagance in expenditure must be the\r\nnatural consequence when those who authorize the expenditure feel no\r\nresponsibility in providing the means of payment. Such had been for a\r\nnumber of years our condition previously to the late monetary revulsion\r\nin the country. Fortunately, at least for the cause of public economy,\r\nthe case is now reversed, and to the extent of the appropriations,\r\nwhatever these may be, ingrafted on the different appropriation bills,\r\nas well as those made by private bills, over and above the estimates of\r\nthe different Departments, it will be necessary for Congress to provide\r\nthe means of payment before their adjournment. Without this the Treasury\r\nwill be exhausted before the 1st of January and the public credit will\r\nbe seriously impaired. This disgrace must not fall upon the country.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me, however, now to ascertain this amount, nor does\r\nthere at present seem to be the least probability that this can be done\r\nand the necessary means provided by Congress to meet any deficiency\r\nwhich may exist in the Treasury before Monday next at 12 o'clock, the\r\nhour fixed for adjournment, it being now Saturday morning at half-past\r\n11 o'clock. To accomplish this object the appropriation bills, as they\r\nshall have finally passed Congress, must be before me, and time must\r\nbe allowed to ascertain the amount of the moneys appropriated and to\r\nenable Congress to provide the necessary means. At this writing it is\r\nunderstood that several of these bills are yet before the committee\r\nof conference and the amendments to some of them have not even been\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nForeseeing that such a state of things might exist at the close of\r\nthe session, I stated in the annual message to Congress of December\r\nlast that--\r\n\r\n  From the practice of Congress such an examination of each bill as the\r\n  Constitution requires has been rendered impossible. The most important\r\n  business of each session is generally crowded into its last hours, and\r\n  the alternative presented to the President is either to violate the\r\n  constitutional duty which he owes to the people and approve bills\r\n  which for want of time it is impossible he should have examined, or\r\n  by his refusal to do this subject the country and individuals to great\r\n  loss and inconvenience.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  For my own part, I have deliberately determined that I shall approve\r\n  no bills which I have not examined, and it will be a case of extreme\r\n  and most urgent necessity which shall ever induce me to depart from\r\n  this rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Treasury absolutely requires that I should\r\nadhere to this resolution on the present occasion, for the reasons which\r\nI have heretofore presented.\r\n\r\nIn former times it was believed to be the true character of an\r\nappropriation bill simply to carry into effect existing laws and the\r\nestablished policy of the country. A practice has, however, grown up of\r\nlate years to ingraft on such bills at the last hours of the session\r\nlarge appropriations for new and important objects not provided for by\r\npreexisting laws and when no time is left to the Executive for their\r\nexamination and investigation. No alternative is thus left to the\r\nPresident but either to approve measures without examination or by\r\nvetoing an appropriation bill seriously to embarrass the operations\r\nof the Government. This practice could never have prevailed without a\r\nsurplus in the Treasury sufficiently large to cover an indefinite amount\r\nof appropriations. Necessity now compels us to arrest it, at least so\r\nfar as to afford time to ascertain the amount appropriated and to\r\nprovide the means of its payment.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons I recommend to Congress to postpone the day of\r\nadjournment for a brief period. I promise that not an hour shall be lost\r\nin ascertaining the amount of appropriations made by them for which it\r\nwill be necessary to provide. I know it will be inconvenient for the\r\nmembers to attend a called session, and this above all things I desire\r\nto avoid.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Statutes at Large (Little, Brown & Co.), Vol. XI, p. 794.]\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas by an act of Congress approved March 3, 1855, entitled \"An act\r\nto improve the laws of the District of Columbia and to codify the same,\"\r\nthe President of the United States was directed to appoint a time and\r\nplace for taking the sense of the citizens of the District of Columbia\r\nfor or against the adoption of the code prepared in pursuance of said\r\nact, and, further, to provide and proclaim the mode and rules of\r\nconducting such election:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, be it known that I do hereby appoint Monday, the 15th\r\nday of February, 1858, as the day for taking the sense of the citizens\r\nof the District of Columbia as aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThe polls will be opened at 9 o'clock a.m. and closed at 5 o'clock p.m.\r\nEvery free white male citizen of the United States above the age of 21\r\nyears who shall have resided in the District of Columbia for one year\r\nnext preceding the said 15th day of February, 1858, shall be allowed to\r\nvote at said election.\r\n\r\nThe voting shall be by ballot.

The great mass of those settlers, acting under\r\nthe influence of leaders to whom they seem to have surrendered their\r\njudgment, refuse to be controlled by any other authority. They have been\r\noften advised to obedience, and these friendly counsels have been\r\nanswered with defiance. The officers of the Federal Government have been\r\ndriven from the Territory for no offense but an effort to do their\r\nsworn duty; others have been prevented from going there by threats of\r\nassassination; judges have been violently interrupted in the performance\r\nof their functions, and the records of the courts have been seized and\r\ndestroyed or concealed. Many other acts of unlawful violence have been\r\nperpetrated, and the right to repeat them has been openly claimed by the\r\nleading inhabitants, with at least the silent acquiescence of nearly all\r\nthe others. Their hostility to the lawful government of the country has\r\nat length become so violent that no officer bearing a commission from\r\nthe Chief Magistrate of the Union can enter the Territory or remain\r\nthere with safety, and all those officers recently appointed have been\r\nunable to go to Salt Lake or anywhere else in Utah beyond the immediate\r\npower of the Army. Indeed, such is believed to be the condition to which\r\na strange system of terrorism has brought the inhabitants of that region\r\nthat no one among them could express an opinion favorable to this\r\nGovernment, or even propose to obey its laws, without exposing his life\r\nand property to peril.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully considering this state of affairs and maturely weighing\r\nthe obligation I was under to see the laws faithfully executed, it\r\nseemed to me right and proper that I should make such use of the\r\nmilitary force at my disposal as might be necessary to protect the\r\nFederal officers in going into the Territory of Utah and in performing\r\ntheir duties after arriving there. I accordingly ordered a detachment\r\nof the Army to march for the city of Salt Lake, or within reach of that\r\nplace, and to act in case of need as a posse for the enforcement of the\r\nlaws. But in the meantime the hatred of that misguided people for the\r\njust and legal authority of the Government had become so intense that\r\nthey resolved to measure their military strength with that of the Union.\r\nThey have organized an armed force far from contemptible in point of\r\nnumbers and trained it, if not with skill, at least with great assiduity\r\nand perseverance. While the troops of the United States were on their\r\nmarch a train of baggage wagons, which happened to be unprotected,\r\nwas attacked and destroyed by a portion of the Mormon forces and the\r\nprovisions and stores with which the train was laden were wantonly\r\nburnt. In short, their present attitude is one of decided and unreserved\r\nenmity to the United States and to all their loyal citizens. Their\r\ndetermination to oppose the authority of the Government by military\r\nforce has not only been expressed in words, but manifested in overt acts\r\nof the most unequivocal character.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens of Utah, this is rebellion against the Government to\r\nwhich you owe allegiance; it is levying war against the United States,\r\nand involves you in the guilt of treason. Persistence in it will bring\r\nyou to condign punishment, to ruin, and to shame; for it is mere madness\r\nto suppose that with your limited resources you can successfully resist\r\nthe force of this great and powerful nation.\r\n\r\nIf you have calculated upon the forbearance of the United States, if you\r\nhave permitted yourselves to suppose that this Government will fail to\r\nput forth its strength and bring you to submission, you have fallen\r\ninto a grave mistake. You have settled upon territory which lies,\r\ngeographically, in the heart of the Union. The land you live upon was\r\npurchased by the United States and paid for out of their Treasury; the\r\nproprietary right and title to it is in them, and not in you. Utah is\r\nbounded on every side by States and Territories whose people are true to\r\nthe Union. It is absurd to believe that they will or can permit you to\r\nerect in their very midst a government of your own, not only independent\r\nof the authority which they all acknowledge, but hostile to them and\r\ntheir interests.\r\n\r\nDo not deceive yourselves nor try to mislead others by propagating the\r\nidea that this is a crusade against your religion. The Constitution and\r\nlaws of this country can take no notice of your creed, whether it be\r\ntrue or false. That is a question between your God and yourselves, in\r\nwhich I disclaim all right to interfere. If you obey the laws, keep the\r\npeace, and respect the just rights of others, you will be perfectly\r\nsecure, and may live on in your present faith or change it for another\r\nat your pleasure. Every intelligent man among you knows very well that\r\nthis Government has never, directly or indirectly, sought to molest you\r\nin your worship, to control you in your ecclesiastical affairs, or even\r\nto influence you in your religious opinions.\r\n\r\nThis rebellion is not merely a violation of your legal duty; it is\r\nwithout just cause, without reason, without excuse. You never made a\r\ncomplaint that was not listened to with patience; you never exhibited a\r\nreal grievance that was not redressed as promptly as it could be. The\r\nlaws and regulations enacted for your government by Congress have been\r\nequal and just, and their enforcement was manifestly necessary for your\r\nown welfare and happiness. You have never asked their repeal. They are\r\nsimilar in every material respect to the laws which have been passed for\r\nthe other Territories of the Union, and which everywhere else (with one\r\npartial exception) have been cheerfully obeyed. No people ever lived\r\nwho were freer from unnecessary legal restraints than you. Human wisdom\r\nnever devised a political system which bestowed more blessings or\r\nimposed lighter burdens than the Government of the United States in\r\nits operation upon the Territories.\r\n\r\nBut being anxious to save the effusion of blood and to avoid the\r\nindiscriminate punishment of a whole people for crimes of which it is\r\nnot probable that all are equally guilty, I offer now a free and full\r\npardon to all who will submit themselves to the just authority of the\r\nFederal Government. If you refuse to accept it, let the consequences\r\nfall upon your own heads. But I conjure you to pause deliberately and\r\nreflect well before you reject this tender of peace and good will.\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Buchanan, President of the United States, have\r\nthought proper to issue this my proclamation, enjoining upon all public\r\nofficers in the Territory of Utah to be diligent and faithful, to the\r\nfull extent of their power, in the execution of the laws; commanding all\r\ncitizens of the United States in said Territory to aid and assist the\r\nofficers in the performance of their duties; offering to the inhabitants\r\nof Utah who shall submit to the laws a free pardon for the seditions and\r\ntreasons heretofore by them committed; warning those who shall persist,\r\nafter notice of this proclamation, in the present rebellion against the\r\nUnited States that they must expect no further lenity, but look to be\r\nrigorously dealt with according to their deserts; and declaring that\r\nthe military forces now in Utah and hereafter to be sent there will not\r\nbe withdrawn until the inhabitants of that Territory shall manifest a\r\nproper sense of the duty which they owe to this Government.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of\r\nthe United States to be affixed to these presents.\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington the 6th day of April, 1858, and of the\r\nIndependence of the United States the eighty-second.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  LEWIS CASS,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas an extraordinary occasion has occurred rendering it necessary\r\nand proper that the Senate of the United States shall be convened to\r\nreceive and act upon such communications as have been or may be made\r\nto it on the part of the Executive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Buchanan, President of the United States, do\r\nissue this my proclamation, declaring that an extraordinary occasion\r\nrequires the Senate of the United States to convene for the transaction\r\nof business at the Capitol, in the city of Washington, on the 15th day\r\nof this month, at 12 o'clock at noon of that day, of which all who shall\r\nat that time be entitled to act as members of that body are hereby\r\nrequired to take notice.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthis 14th day of June, A.D. 1858, and of the Independence of the United\r\nStates the eighty-second.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  LEWIS CASS,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY JAMES BUCHANAN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas information has reached me from sources which I can not\r\ndisregard that certain persons, in violation of the neutrality laws of\r\nthe United States, are making a third attempt to set on foot a military\r\nexpedition within their territory against Nicaragua, a foreign State\r\nwith which they are at peace. In order to raise money for equipping\r\nand maintaining this expedition, persons connected therewith, as I\r\nhave reason to believe, have issued and sold bonds and other contracts\r\npledging the public lands of Nicaragua and the transit route through\r\nits territory as a security for their redemption and fulfillment.\r\n\r\nThe hostile design of this expedition is rendered manifest by the fact\r\nthat these bonds and contracts can be of no possible value to their\r\nholders unless the present Government of Nicaragua shall be overthrown\r\nby force. Besides, the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary\r\nof that Government in the United States has issued a notice, in\r\npursuance of his instructions, dated on the 27th instant, forbidding\r\nthe citizens or subjects of any nation, except passengers intending to\r\nproceed through Nicaragua over the transit route from ocean to ocean,\r\nto enter its territory without a regular passport, signed by the proper\r\nminister or consul-general of the Republic resident in the country from\r\nwhence they shall have departed. Such persons, with this exception,\r\n\"will be stopped and compelled to return by the same conveyance that\r\ntook them to the country.\" From these circumstances the inference is\r\nirresistible that persons engaged in this expedition will leave the\r\nUnited States with hostile purposes against Nicaragua. They can not,\r\nunder the guise which they have assumed that they are peaceful\r\nemigrants, conceal their real intentions, and especially when they\r\nknow in advance that their landing will be resisted and can only be\r\naccomplished by an overpowering force. This expedient was successfully\r\nresorted to previous to the last expedition, and the vessel in which\r\nthose composing it were conveyed to Nicaragua obtained a clearance\r\nfrom the collector of the port of Mobile. Although, after a careful\r\nexamination, no arms or munitions of war were discovered on board, yet\r\nwhen they arrived in Nicaragua they were found to be armed and equipped\r\nand immediately commenced hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of former illegal expeditions of the same character have\r\nopenly expressed their intention to renew hostilities against Nicaragua.\r\nOne of them, who has already been twice expelled from Nicaragua, has\r\ninvited through the public newspapers American citizens to emigrate to\r\nthat Republic, and has designated Mobile as the place of rendezvous and\r\ndeparture and San Juan del Norte as the port to which they are bound.\r\nThis person, who has renounced his allegiance to the United States and\r\nclaims to be President of Nicaragua, has given notice to the collector\r\nof the port of Mobile that two or three hundred of these emigrants will\r\nbe prepared to embark from that port about the middle of November.\r\n\r\nFor these and other good reasons, and for the purpose of saving American\r\ncitizens who may have been honestly deluded into the belief that they\r\nare about to proceed to Nicaragua as peaceful emigrants, if any such\r\nthere be, from the disastrous consequences to which they will be\r\nexposed, I, James Buchanan, President of the United States, have thought\r\nit fit to issue this my proclamation, enjoining upon all officers of\r\nthe Government, civil and military, in their respective spheres, to be\r\nvigilant, active, and faithful in suppressing these illegal enterprises\r\nand in carrying out their standing instructions to that effect;\r\nexhorting all good citizens, by their respect for the laws and their\r\nregard for the peace and welfare of the country, to aid the efforts of\r\nthe public authorities in the discharge of their duties.\r\n\r\nIn testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal\r\nof the United States to be affixed to these presents.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nDone at the city of Washington the 30th day of October, 1858, and of\r\nthe Independence of the United States the eighty-third.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  LEWIS CASS,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _December 6, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the condition of the country at the present day with\r\nwhat it was one year ago at the meeting of Congress, we have much reason\r\nfor gratitude to that Almighty Providence which has never failed to\r\ninterpose for our relief at the most critical periods of our history.\r\nOne year ago the sectional strife between the North and the South on the\r\ndangerous subject of slavery had again become so intense as to threaten\r\nthe peace and perpetuity of the Confederacy. The application for the\r\nadmission of Kansas as a State into the Union fostered this unhappy\r\nagitation and brought the whole subject once more before Congress. It\r\nwas the desire of every patriot that such measures of legislation might\r\nbe adopted as would remove the excitement from the States and confine\r\nit to the Territory where it legitimately belonged. Much has been done,\r\nI am happy to say, toward the accomplishment of this object during the\r\nlast session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of the United States had previously decided that all\r\nAmerican citizens have an equal right to take into the Territories\r\nwhatever is held as property under the laws of any of the States,\r\nand to hold such property there under the guardianship of the Federal\r\nConstitution so long as the Territorial condition shall remain.\r\n\r\nThis is now a well-established position, and the proceedings of the last\r\nsession were alone wanting to give it practical effect. The principle\r\nhas been recognized in some form or other by an almost unanimous vote of\r\nboth Houses of Congress that a Territory has a right to come into the\r\nUnion either as a free or a slave State, according to the will of a\r\nmajority of its people. The just equality of all the States has thus\r\nbeen vindicated and a fruitful source of dangerous dissension among them\r\nhas been removed.\r\n\r\nWhilst such has been the beneficial tendency of your legislative\r\nproceedings outside of Kansas, their influence has nowhere been so happy\r\nas within that Territory itself. Left to manage and control its own\r\naffairs in its own way, without the pressure of external influence, the\r\nrevolutionary Topeka organization and all resistance to the Territorial\r\ngovernment established by Congress have been finally abandoned. As a\r\nnatural consequence that fine Territory now appears to be tranquil and\r\nprosperous and is attracting increasing thousands of immigrants to make\r\nit their happy home.\r\n\r\nThe past unfortunate experience of Kansas has enforced the lesson, so\r\noften already taught, that resistance to lawful authority under our\r\nform of government can not fail in the end to prove disastrous to its\r\nauthors. Had the people of the Territory yielded obedience to the laws\r\nenacted by their legislature, it would at the present moment have\r\ncontained a large additional population of industrious and enterprising\r\ncitizens, who have been deterred from entering its borders by the\r\nexistence of civil strife and organized rebellion.\r\n\r\nIt was the resistance to rightful authority and the persevering attempts\r\nto establish a revolutionary government under the Topeka constitution\r\nwhich caused the people of Kansas to commit the grave error of refusing\r\nto vote for delegates to the convention to frame a constitution under\r\na law not denied to be fair and just in its provisions. This refusal\r\nto vote been the prolific source of all the evils which have followed.\r\nIn their hostility to the Territorial government they disregarded\r\nthe principle, absolutely essential to the working of our form of\r\ngovernment, that a majority of those who vote, not the majority who\r\nmay remain at home, from whatever cause, must decide the result of an\r\nelection. For this reason, seeking to take advantage of their own error,\r\nthey denied the authority of the convention thus elected to frame a\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nThe convention, notwithstanding, proceeded to adopt a constitution\r\nunexceptionable in its general features, and providing for the\r\nsubmission of the slavery question to a vote of the people, which, in my\r\nopinion, they were bound to do under the Kansas and Nebraska act. This\r\nwas the all-important question which had alone convulsed the Territory;\r\nand yet the opponents of the lawful government, persisting in their\r\nfirst error, refrained from exercising their right to vote, and\r\npreferred that slavery should continue rather than surrender their\r\nrevolutionary Topeka organization.\r\n\r\nA wiser and better spirit seemed to prevail before the first Monday\r\nof January last, when an election was held under the constitution.\r\nA majority of the people then voted for a governor and other State\r\nofficers, for a Member of Congress and members of the State legislature.\r\nThis election was warmly contested by the two political parties in\r\nKansas, and a greater vote was polled than at any previous election.\r\nA large majority of the members of the legislature elect belonged to\r\nthat party which had previously refused to vote. The antislavery party\r\nwere thus placed in the ascendant, and the political power of the State\r\nwas in their own hands. Had Congress admitted Kansas into the Union\r\nunder the Lecompton constitution, the legislature might at its very\r\nfirst session have submitted the question to a vote of the people\r\nwhether they would or would not have a convention to amend their\r\nconstitution, either on the slavery or any other question, and have\r\nadopted all necessary means for giving speedy effect to the will of\r\nthe majority. Thus the Kansas question would have been immediately\r\nand finally settled.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I submitted to Congress the constitution thus\r\nframed, with all the officers already elected necessary to put the State\r\ngovernment into operation, accompanied by a strong recommendation in\r\nfavor of the admission of Kansas as a State. In the course of my long\r\npublic life I have never performed any official act which in the\r\nretrospect has afforded me more heartfelt satisfaction. Its admission\r\ncould have inflicted no possible injury on any human being, whilst it\r\nwould within a brief period have restored peace to Kansas and harmony to\r\nthe Union. In that event the slavery question would ere this have been\r\nfinally settled according to the legally expressed will of a majority of\r\nthe voters, and popular sovereignty would thus have been vindicated in\r\na constitutional manner.\r\n\r\nWith my deep convictions of duty I could have pursued no other course.\r\nIt is true that as an individual I had expressed an opinion, both before\r\nand during the session of the convention, in favor of submitting the\r\nremaining clauses of the constitution, as well as that concerning\r\nslavery, to the people. But, acting in an official character, neither\r\nmyself nor any human authority had the power to rejudge the proceedings\r\nof the convention and declare the constitution which it had framed to be\r\na nullity. To have done this would have been a violation of the Kansas\r\nand Nebraska act, which left the people of the Territory \"perfectly\r\nfree to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way,\r\nsubject only to the Constitution of the United States.\" It would\r\nequally have violated the great principle of popular sovereignty, at\r\nthe foundation of our institutions, to deprive the people of the power,\r\nif they thought proper to exercise it, of confiding to delegates elected\r\nby themselves the trust of framing a constitution without requiring them\r\nto subject their constituents to the trouble, expense, and delay of a\r\nsecond election. It would have been in opposition to many precedents in\r\nour history, commencing in the very best age of the Republic, of the\r\nadmission of Territories as States into the Union without a previous\r\nvote of the people approving their constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is to be lamented that a question so insignificant when viewed in its\r\npractical effects on the people of Kansas, whether decided one way or\r\nthe other, should have kindled such a flame of excitement throughout\r\nthe country. This reflection may prove to be a lesson of wisdom and of\r\nwarning for our future guidance. Practically considered, the question is\r\nsimply whether the people of that Territory should first come into the\r\nUnion and then change any provision in their constitution not agreeable\r\nto themselves, or accomplish the very same object by remaining out of\r\nthe Union and framing another constitution in accordance with their\r\nwill. In either case the result would be precisely the same. The only\r\ndifference, in point of fact, is that the object would have been much\r\nsooner attained and the pacification of Kansas more speedily effected\r\nhad it been admitted as a State during the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation, however, for the immediate admission of Kansas failed\r\nto meet the approbation of Congress. They deemed it wiser to adopt a\r\ndifferent measure for the settlement of the question. For my own part, I\r\nshould have been willing to yield my assent to almost any constitutional\r\nmeasure to accomplish this object. I therefore cordially acquiesced in\r\nwhat has been called the English compromise and approved the \"act for\r\nthe admission of the State of Kansas into the Union\" upon the terms\r\ntherein prescribed.\r\n\r\nUnder the ordinance which accompanied the Lecompton constitution the\r\npeople of Kansas had claimed double the quantity of public lands for the\r\nsupport of common schools which had ever been previously granted to any\r\nState upon entering the Union, and also the alternate sections of land\r\nfor 12 miles on each side of two railroads proposed to be constructed\r\nfrom the northern to the southern boundary and from the eastern to\r\nthe western boundary of the State. Congress, deeming these claims\r\nunreasonable, provided by the act of May 4, 1858, to which I have just\r\nreferred, for the admission of the State on an equal footing with the\r\noriginal States, but \"upon the fundamental condition precedent\" that\r\na majority of the people thereof, at an election to be held for that\r\npurpose, should, in place of the very large grants of public lands\r\nwhich they had demanded under the ordinance, accept such grants as had\r\nbeen made to Minnesota and other new States. Under this act, should\r\na majority reject the proposition offered them, \"it shall be deemed\r\nand held that the people of Kansas do not desire admission into the\r\nUnion with said constitution under the conditions set forth in said\r\nproposition,\" In that event the act authorizes the people of the\r\nTerritory to elect delegates to form a constitution and State government\r\nfor themselves \"whenever, and not before, it is ascertained by a census,\r\nduly and legally taken, that the population of said Territory equals or\r\nexceeds the ratio of representation required for a member of the House\r\nof Representatives of the Congress of the United States.\" The delegates\r\nthus assembled \"shall first determine by a vote whether it is the wish\r\nof the people of the proposed State to be admitted into the Union at\r\nthat time, and, if so, shall proceed to form a constitution and take\r\nall necessary steps for the establishment of a State government in\r\nconformity with the Federal Constitution.\" After this constitution shall\r\nhave been formed, Congress, carrying out the principles of popular\r\nsovereignty and nonintervention, have left \"the mode and manner of its\r\napproval or ratification by the people of the proposed State\" to be\r\n\"prescribed by law,\" and they \"shall then be admitted into the Union as\r\na State under such constitution, thus fairly and legally made, with or\r\nwithout slavery, as said constitution may prescribe.\"\r\n\r\nAn election was held throughout Kansas, in pursuance of the provisions\r\nof this act, on the 2d day of August last, and it resulted in the\r\nrejection by a large majority of the proposition submitted to the people\r\nby Congress. This being the case, they are now authorized to form\r\nanother constitution, preparatory to admission into the Union, but not\r\nuntil their number, as ascertained by a census, shall equal or exceed\r\nthe ratio required to elect a member to the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nIt is not probable, in the present state of the case, that a third\r\nconstitution can be lawfully framed and presented to Congress by Kansas\r\nbefore its population shall have reached the designated number. Nor is\r\nit to be presumed that after their sad experience in resisting the\r\nTerritorial laws they will attempt to adopt a constitution in express\r\nviolation of the provisions of an act of Congress. During the session\r\nof 1856 much of the time of Congress was occupied on the question of\r\nadmitting Kansas under the Topeka constitution. Again, nearly the whole\r\nof the last session was devoted to the question of its admission under\r\nthe Lecompton constitution. Surely it is not unreasonable to require the\r\npeople of Kansas to wait before making a third attempt until the number\r\nof their inhabitants shall amount to 93,420. During this brief period\r\nthe harmony of the States as well as the great business interests of the\r\ncountry demand that the people of the Union shall not for a third time\r\nbe convulsed by another agitation on the Kansas question. By waiting for\r\na short time and acting in obedience to law Kansas will glide into the\r\nUnion without the slightest impediment.\r\n\r\nThis excellent provision, which Congress have applied to Kansas, ought\r\nto be extended and rendered applicable to all Territories which may\r\nhereafter seek admission into the Union.\r\n\r\nWhilst Congress possess the undoubted power of admitting a new State\r\ninto the Union, however small may be the number of its inhabitants,\r\nyet this power ought not, in my opinion, to be exercised before the\r\npopulation shall amount to the ratio required by the act for the\r\nadmission of Kansas. Had this been previously the rule, the country\r\nwould have escaped all the evils and misfortunes to which it has been\r\nexposed by the Kansas question.\r\n\r\nOf course it would be unjust to give this rule a retrospective\r\napplication, and exclude a State which, acting upon the past practice\r\nof the Government, has already formed its constitution, elected its\r\nlegislature and other officers, and is now prepared to enter the Union.\r\n\r\nThe rule ought to be adopted, whether we consider its bearing on the\r\npeople of the Territories or upon the people of the existing States.\r\nMany of the serious dissensions which have prevailed in Congress and\r\nthroughout the country would have been avoided had this rule been\r\nestablished at an earlier period of the Government.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the formation of a new Territory people from different\r\nStates and from foreign countries rush into it for the laudable purpose\r\nof improving their condition. Their first duty to themselves is to open\r\nand cultivate farms, to construct roads, to establish schools, to erect\r\nplaces of religious worship, and to devote their energies generally\r\nto reclaim the wilderness and to lay the foundations of a flourishing\r\nand prosperous commonwealth. If in this incipient condition, with a\r\npopulation of a few thousand, they should prematurely enter the Union,\r\nthey are oppressed by the burden of State taxation, and the means\r\nnecessary for the improvement of the Territory and the advancement of\r\ntheir own interests are thus diverted to very different purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government has ever been a liberal parent to the Territories\r\nand a generous contributor to the useful enterprises of the early\r\nsettlers. It has paid the expenses of their governments and legislative\r\nassemblies out of the common Treasury, and thus relieved them from a\r\nheavy charge. Under these circumstances nothing can be better calculated\r\nto retard their material progress than to divert them from their useful\r\nemployments by prematurely exciting angry political contests among\r\nthemselves for the benefit of aspiring leaders. It is surely no hardship\r\nfor embryo governors, Senators, and Members of Congress to wait until\r\nthe number of inhabitants shall equal those of a single Congressional\r\ndistrict. They surely ought not to be permitted to rush into the Union\r\nwith a population less than one-half of several of the large counties\r\nin the interior of some of the States. This was the condition of Kansas\r\nwhen it made application to be admitted under the Topeka constitution.\r\nBesides, it requires some time to render the mass of a population\r\ncollected in a new Territory at all homogeneous and to unite them on\r\nanything like a fixed policy. Establish the rule, and all will look\r\nforward to it and govern themselves accordingly.\r\n\r\nBut justice to the people of the several States requires that this\r\nrule should be established by Congress. Each State is entitled to two\r\nSenators and at least one Representative in Congress. Should the people\r\nof the States fail to elect a Vice-President, the power devolves upon\r\nthe Senate to select this officer from the two highest candidates on the\r\nlist. In case of the death of the President, the Vice-President thus\r\nelected by the Senate becomes President of the United States. On all\r\nquestions of legislation the Senators from the smallest States of the\r\nUnion have an equal vote with those from the largest. The same may be\r\nsaid in regard to the ratification of treaties and of Executive\r\nappointments. All this has worked admirably in practice, whilst it\r\nconforms in principle with the character of a Government instituted\r\nby sovereign States. I presume no American citizen would desire the\r\nslightest change in the arrangement. Still, is it not unjust and unequal\r\nto the existing States to invest some 40,000 or 50,000 people collected\r\nin a Territory with the attributes of sovereignty and place them on an\r\nequal footing with Virginia and New York in the Senate of the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I earnestly recommend the passage of a general act\r\nwhich shall provide that, upon the application of a Territorial\r\nlegislature declaring their belief that the Territory contains a number\r\nof inhabitants which, if in a State, would entitle them to elect a\r\nMember of Congress, it shall be the duty of the President to cause a\r\ncensus of the inhabitants to be taken, and if found sufficient then by\r\nthe terms of this act to authorize them to proceed \"in their own way\"\r\nto frame a State constitution preparatory to admission into the Union.\r\nI also recommend that an appropriation may be made to enable the\r\nPresident to take a census of the people of Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe present condition of the Territory of Utah, when contrasted with\r\nwhat it was one year ago, is a subject for congratulation. It was then\r\nin a state of open rebellion, and, cost what it might, the character of\r\nthe Government required that this rebellion should be suppressed and the\r\nMormons compelled to yield obedience to the Constitution and the laws.\r\nIn order to accomplish this object, as I informed you in my last annual\r\nmessage, I appointed a new governor instead of Brigham Young, and other\r\nFederal officers to take the place of those who, consulting their\r\npersonal safety, had found it necessary to withdraw from the Territory.\r\n\r\nTo protect these civil officers, and to aid them, as a _posse\r\ncomitatus_, in the execution of the laws in case of need, I ordered\r\na detachment of the Army to accompany them to Utah. The necessity for\r\nadopting these measures is now demonstrated.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of September, 1857, Governor Young issued his proclamation,\r\nin the style of an independent sovereign, announcing his purpose to\r\nresist by force of arms the entry of the United States troops into\r\nour own Territory of Utah. By this he required all the forces in the\r\nTerritory to \"hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment's notice\r\nto repel any and all such invasion,\" and established martial law from\r\nits date throughout the Territory. These proved to be no idle threats.\r\nForts Bridger and Supply were vacated and burnt down by the Mormons\r\nto deprive our troops of a shelter after their long and fatiguing\r\nmarch. Orders were issued by Daniel H. Wells, styling himself\r\n\"Lieutenant-General, Nauvoo Legion,\" to stampede the animals of the\r\nUnited States troops on their march, to set fire to their trains, to\r\nburn the grass and the whole country before them and on their flanks,\r\nto keep them from sleeping by night surprises, and to blockade the\r\nroad by felling trees and destroying the fords of rivers, etc.\r\n\r\nThese orders were promptly and effectually obeyed. On the 4th of\r\nOctober, 1857, the Mormons captured and burned, on Green River, three\r\nof our supply trains, consisting of seventy-five wagons loaded with\r\nprovisions and tents for the army, and carried away several hundred\r\nanimals. This diminished the supply of provisions so materially that\r\nGeneral Johnston was obliged to reduce the ration, and even with this\r\nprecaution there was only sufficient left to subsist the troops until\r\nthe 1st of June.\r\n\r\nOur little army behaved admirably in their encampment at Fort Bridger\r\nunder these trying privations. In the midst of the mountains, in a\r\ndreary, unsettled, and inhospitable region, more than a thousand miles\r\nfrom home, they passed the severe and inclement winter without a murmur.\r\nThey looked forward with confidence for relief from their country in due\r\nseason, and in this they were not disappointed.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War employed all his energies to forward them the\r\nnecessary supplies and to muster and send such a military force to Utah\r\nas would render resistance on the part of the Mormons hopeless, and thus\r\nterminate the war without the effusion of blood. In his efforts he\r\nwas efficiently sustained by Congress. They granted appropriations\r\nsufficient to cover the deficiency thus necessarily created, and also\r\nprovided for raising two regiments of volunteers \"for the purpose of\r\nquelling disturbances in the Territory of Utah, for the protection of\r\nsupply and emigrant trains, and the suppression of Indian hostilities\r\non the frontiers.\" Happily, there was no occasion to call these\r\nregiments into service. If there had been, I should have felt serious\r\nembarrassment in selecting them, so great was the number of our brave\r\nand patriotic citizens anxious to serve their country in this distant\r\nand apparently dangerous expedition. Thus it has ever been, and thus\r\nmay it ever be.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom and economy of sending sufficient reenforcements to Utah are\r\nestablished, not only by the event, but in the opinion of those who\r\nfrom their position and opportunities are the most capable of forming\r\na correct judgment. General Johnston, the commander of the forces, in\r\naddressing the Secretary of War from Fort Bridger under date of October\r\n18, 1857, expresses the opinion that \"unless a large force is sent here,\r\nfrom the nature of the country a protracted war on their [the Mormons's]\r\npart is inevitable.\" This he considered necessary to terminate the war\r\n\"speedily and more economically than if attempted by insufficient\r\nmeans.\"\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it was my anxious desire that the Mormons should yield\r\nobedience to the Constitution and the laws without rendering it\r\nnecessary to resort to military force. To aid in accomplishing\r\nthis object, I deemed it advisable in April last to dispatch two\r\ndistinguished citizens of the United States, Messrs. Powell and\r\nMcCulloch, to Utah. They bore with them a proclamation addressed by\r\nmyself to the inhabitants of Utah, dated on the 6th day of that month,\r\nwarning them of their true condition and how hopeless it was on their\r\npart to persist in rebellion against the United States, and offering\r\nall those who should submit to the laws a full pardon for their past\r\nseditions and treasons. At the same time I assured those who should\r\npersist in rebellion against the United States that they must expect no\r\nfurther lenity, but look to be rigorously dealt with according to their\r\ndeserts. The instructions to these agents, as well as a copy of the\r\nproclamation and their reports, are herewith submitted. It will be seen\r\nby their report of the 3d of July last that they have fully confirmed\r\nthe opinion expressed by General Johnston in the previous October as to\r\nthe necessity of sending reenforcements to Utah. In this they state that\r\nthey \"are firmly impressed with the belief that the presence of the\r\nArmy here and the large additional force that had been ordered to this\r\nTerritory were the chief inducements that caused the Mormons to abandon\r\nthe idea of resisting the authority of the United States. A less\r\ndecisive policy would probably have resulted in a long, bloody, and\r\nexpensive war.\"\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen conducted themselves to my entire satisfaction and\r\nrendered useful services in executing the humane intentions of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIt also affords me great satisfaction to state that Governor Cumming has\r\nperformed his duty in an able and conciliatory manner and with the\r\nhappiest effect. I can not in this connection refrain from mentioning\r\nthe valuable services of Colonel Thomas L. Kane, who, from motives\r\nof pure benevolence and without any official character or pecuniary\r\ncompensation, visited Utah during the last inclement winter for the\r\npurpose of contributing to the pacification of the Territory.\r\n\r\nI am happy to inform you that the governor and other civil officers of\r\nUtah are now performing their appropriate functions without resistance.\r\nThe authority of the Constitution and the laws has been fully restored\r\nand peace prevails throughout the Territory.\r\n\r\nA portion of the troops sent to Utah are now encamped in Cedar Valley,\r\n44 miles southwest of Salt Lake City, and the remainder have been\r\nordered to Oregon to suppress Indian hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe march of the army to Salt Lake City through the Indian Territory has\r\nhad a powerful effect in restraining the hostile feelings against the\r\nUnited States which existed among the Indians in that region and in\r\nsecuring emigrants to the far West against their depredations. This\r\nwill also be the means of establishing military posts and promoting\r\nsettlements along the route.\r\n\r\nI recommend that the benefits of our land laws and preemption system be\r\nextended to the people of Utah by the establishment of a land office in\r\nthat Territory.\r\n\r\nI have occasion also to congratulate you on the result of our\r\nnegotiations with China.\r\n\r\nYou were informed by my last annual message that our minister had been\r\ninstructed to occupy a neutral position in the hostilities conducted\r\nby Great Britain and France against Canton. He was, however, at the\r\nsame time directed to cooperate cordially with the British and French\r\nministers in all peaceful measures to secure by treaty those just\r\nconcessions to foreign commerce which the nations of the world had a\r\nright to demand. It was impossible for me to proceed further than this\r\non my own authority without usurping the war-making power, which under\r\nthe Constitution belongs exclusively to Congress.\r\n\r\nBesides, after a careful examination of the nature and extent of\r\nour grievances, I did not believe they were of such a pressing and\r\naggravated character as would have justified Congress in declaring war\r\nagainst the Chinese Empire without first making another earnest attempt\r\nto adjust them by peaceful negotiation. I was the more inclined to this\r\nopinion because of the severe chastisement which had then but recently\r\nbeen inflicted upon the Chinese by our squadron in the capture and\r\ndestruction of the Barrier forts to avenge an alleged insult to our\r\nflag.\r\n\r\nThe event has proved the wisdom of our neutrality. Our minister has\r\nexecuted his instructions with eminent skill and ability. In conjunction\r\nwith the Russian plenipotentiary, he has peacefully, but effectually,\r\ncooperated with the English and French plenipotentiaries, and each of\r\nthe four powers has concluded a separate treaty with China of a highly\r\nsatisfactory character. The treaty concluded by our own plenipotentiary\r\nwill immediately be submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nI am happy to announce that through the energetic yet conciliatory\r\nefforts of our consul-general in Japan a new treaty has been concluded\r\nwith that Empire, which may be expected materially to augment our trade\r\nand intercourse in that quarter and remove from our countrymen the\r\ndisabilities which have heretofore been imposed upon the exercise of\r\ntheir religion. The treaty shall be submitted to the Senate for approval\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nIt is my earnest desire that every misunderstanding with the Government\r\nof Great Britain should be amicably and speedily adjusted. It has been\r\nthe misfortune of both countries, almost ever since the period of the\r\nRevolution, to have been annoyed by a succession of irritating and\r\ndangerous questions, threatening their friendly relations. This has\r\npartially prevented the full development of those feelings of mutual\r\nfriendship between the people of the two countries so natural in\r\nthemselves and so conducive to their common interest. Any serious\r\ninterruption of the commerce between the United States and Great Britain\r\nwould be equally injurious to both. In fact, no two nations have ever\r\nexisted on the face of the earth which could do each other so much good\r\nor so much harm.\r\n\r\nEntertaining these sentiments, I am gratified to inform you that the\r\nlong-pending controversy between the two Governments in relation to the\r\nquestion of visitation and search has been amicably adjusted. The claim\r\non the part of Great Britain forcibly to visit American vessels on the\r\nhigh seas in time of peace could not be sustained under the law of\r\nnations, and it had been overruled by her own most eminent jurists.\r\nThis question was recently brought to an issue by the repeated acts of\r\nBritish cruisers in boarding and searching our merchant vessels in the\r\nGulf of Mexico and the adjacent seas. These acts were the more injurious\r\nand annoying, as these waters are traversed by a large portion of\r\nthe commerce and navigation of the United States and their free and\r\nunrestricted use is essential to the security of the coastwise trade\r\nbetween the different States of the Union. Such vexatious interruptions\r\ncould not fail to excite the feelings of the country and to require\r\nthe interposition of the Government. Remonstrances were addressed\r\nto the British Government against these violations of our rights of\r\nsovereignty, and a naval force was at the same time ordered to the Cuban\r\nwaters with directions \"to protect all vessels of the United States\r\non the high seas from search or detention by the vessels of war of\r\nany other nation.\" These measures received the unqualified and even\r\nenthusiastic approbation of the American people. Most fortunately,\r\nhowever, no collision took place, and the British Government promptly\r\navowed its recognition of the principles of international law upon this\r\nsubject as laid down by the Government of the United States in the note\r\nof the Secretary of State to the British minister at Washington of April\r\n10, 1858, which secure the vessels of the United States upon the high\r\nseas from visitation or search in time of peace under any circumstances\r\nwhatever. The claim has been abandoned in a manner reflecting honor\r\non the British Government and evincing a just regard for the law of\r\nnations, and can not fail to strengthen the amicable relations between\r\nthe two countries.\r\n\r\nThe British Government at the same time proposed to the United States\r\nthat some mode should be adopted, by mutual arrangement between the two\r\ncountries, of a character which may be found effective without being\r\noffensive, for verifying the nationality of vessels suspected on good\r\ngrounds of carrying false colors. They have also invited the United\r\nStates to take the initiative and propose measures for this purpose.\r\nWhilst declining to assume so grave a responsibility, the Secretary of\r\nState has informed the British Government that we are ready to receive\r\nany proposals which they may feel disposed to offer having this object\r\nin view, and to consider them in an amicable spirit. A strong opinion\r\nis, however, expressed that the occasional abuse of the flag of\r\nany nation is an evil far less to be deprecated than would be the\r\nestablishment of any regulations which might be incompatible with the\r\nfreedom of the seas. This Government has yet received no communication\r\nspecifying the manner in which the British Government would propose to\r\ncarry out their suggestion, and I am inclined to believe that no plan\r\nwhich can be devised will be free from grave embarrassments. Still,\r\nI shall form no decided opinion on the subject until I shall have\r\ncarefully and in the best spirit examined any proposals which they\r\nmay think proper to make.\r\n\r\nI am truly sorry I can not also inform you that the complications\r\nbetween Great Britain and the United States arising out of the Clayton\r\nand Bulwer treaty of April, 1850, have been finally adjusted.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of your last session I had reason to hope that,\r\nemancipating themselves from further unavailing discussions, the two\r\nGovernments would proceed to settle the Central American questions in\r\na practical manner, alike honorable and satisfactory to both; and this\r\nhope I have not yet abandoned. In my last annual message I stated that\r\novertures had been made by the British Government for this purpose in\r\na friendly spirit, which I cordially reciprocated. Their proposal was\r\nto withdraw these questions from direct negotiation between the two\r\nGovernments, but to accomplish the same object by a negotiation between\r\nthe British Government and each of the Central American Republics whose\r\nterritorial interests are immediately involved. The settlement was to be\r\nmade in accordance with the general tenor of the interpretation placed\r\nupon the Clayton and Bulwer treaty by the United States, with certain\r\nmodifications. As negotiations are still pending upon this basis, it\r\nwould not be proper for me now to communicate their present condition.\r\nA final settlement of these questions is greatly to be desired, as this\r\nwould wipe out the last remaining subject of dispute between the two\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the great Empires of France and Russia, as well as\r\nwith all other Governments on the continent of Europe, except that of\r\nSpain, continue to be of the most friendly character.\r\n\r\nWith Spain our relations remain in an unsatisfactory condition. In my\r\nmessage of December last I informed you that our envoy extraordinary\r\nand minister plenipotentiary to Madrid had asked for his recall, and it\r\nwas my purpose to send out a new minister to that Court with special\r\ninstructions on all questions pending between the two Governments, and\r\nwith a determination to have them speedily and amicably adjusted if that\r\nwere possible. This purpose has been hitherto defeated by causes which\r\nI need not enumerate.\r\n\r\nThe mission to Spain has been intrusted to a distinguished citizen of\r\nKentucky, who will proceed to Madrid without delay and make another and\r\na final attempt to obtain justice from that Government.\r\n\r\nSpanish officials under the direct control of the Captain-General of\r\nCuba have insulted our national flag and in repeated instances have\r\nfrom time to time inflicted injuries on the persons and property of our\r\ncitizens. These have given birth to numerous claims against the Spanish\r\nGovernment, the merits of which have been ably discussed for a series\r\nof years by our successive diplomatic representatives. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, we have not arrived at a practical result in any single instance,\r\nunless we may except the case of the _Black Warrior_, under the late\r\nAdministration, and that presented an outrage of such a character as\r\nwould have justified an immediate resort to war. All our attempts\r\nto obtain redress have been baffled and defeated. The frequent and\r\noft-recurring changes in the Spanish ministry have been employed as\r\nreasons for delay. We have been compelled to wait again and again until\r\nthe new minister shall have had time to investigate the justice of our\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\nEven what have been denominated \"the Cuban claims,\" in which more\r\nthan 100 of our citizens are directly interested, have furnished no\r\nexception. These claims were for the refunding of duties unjustly\r\nexacted from American vessels at different custom-houses in Cuba so\r\nlong ago as the year 1844. The principles upon which they rest are so\r\nmanifestly equitable and just that, after a period of nearly ten years,\r\nin 1854 they were recognized by the Spanish Government. Proceedings were\r\nafterwards instituted to ascertain their amount, and this was finally\r\nfixed, according to their own statement (with which we were satisfied),\r\nat the sum of $128,635.54. Just at the moment, after a delay of fourteen\r\nyears, when we had reason to expect that this sum would be repaid with\r\ninterest, we have received a proposal offering to refund one-third of\r\nthat amount ($42,878.41), but without interest, if we would accept this\r\nin full satisfaction. The offer is also accompanied by a declaration\r\nthat this indemnification is not founded on any reason of strict\r\njustice, but is made as a special favor.\r\n\r\nOne alleged cause for procrastination in the examination and adjustment\r\nof our claims arises from an obstacle which it is the duty of the\r\nSpanish Government to remove. Whilst the Captain-General of Cuba is\r\ninvested with general despotic authority in the government of that\r\nisland, the power is withheld from him to examine and redress wrongs\r\ncommitted by officials under his control on citizens of the United\r\nStates. Instead of making our complaints directly to him at Havana, we\r\nare obliged to present them through our minister at Madrid. These are\r\nthen referred back to the Captain-General for information, and much\r\ntime is thus consumed in preliminary investigations and correspondence\r\nbetween Madrid and Cuba before the Spanish Government will consent\r\nto proceed to negotiation. Many of the difficulties between the two\r\nGovernments would be obviated and a long train of negotiation avoided\r\nif the Captain-General were invested with authority to settle questions\r\nof easy solution on the spot, where all the facts are fresh and\r\ncould be promptly and satisfactorily ascertained. We have hitherto in\r\nvain urged upon the Spanish Government to confer this power upon the\r\nCaptain-General, and our minister to Spain will again be instructed to\r\nurge this subject on their notice. In this respect we occupy a different\r\nposition from the powers of Europe. Cuba is almost within sight of our\r\nshores; our commerce with it is far greater than that of any other\r\nnation, including Spain itself, and our citizens are in habits of daily\r\nand extended personal intercourse with every part of the island. It is\r\ntherefore a great grievance that when any difficulty occurs, no matter\r\nhow unimportant, which might be readily settled at the moment, we should\r\nbe obliged to resort to Madrid, especially when the very first step to\r\nbe taken there is to refer it back to Cuba.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that Cuba, in its existing colonial condition, is a\r\nconstant source of injury and annoyance to the American people. It is\r\nthe only spot in the civilized world where the African slave trade is\r\ntolerated, and we are bound by treaty with Great Britain to maintain a\r\nnaval force on the coast of Africa, at much expense both of life and\r\ntreasure, solely for the purpose of arresting slavers bound to that\r\nisland. The late serious difficulties between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain respecting the right of search, now so happily terminated,\r\ncould never have arisen if Cuba had not afforded a market for slaves.\r\nAs long as this market shall remain open there can be no hope for the\r\ncivilization of benighted Africa. Whilst the demand for slaves continues\r\nin Cuba wars will be waged among the petty and barbarous chiefs in\r\nAfrica for the purpose of seizing subjects to supply this trade. In such\r\na condition of affairs it is impossible that the light of civilization\r\nand religion can ever penetrate these dark abodes.\r\n\r\nIt has been made known to the world by my predecessors that the United\r\nStates have on several occasions endeavored to acquire Cuba from Spain\r\nby honorable negotiation. If this were accomplished, the last relic of\r\nthe African slave trade would instantly disappear. We would not, if we\r\ncould, acquire Cuba in any other manner. This is due to our national\r\ncharacter. All the territory which we have acquired since the origin of\r\nthe Government has been by fair purchase from France, Spain, and Mexico\r\nor by the free and voluntary act of the independent State of Texas in\r\nblending her destinies with our own. This course we shall ever pursue,\r\nunless circumstances should occur which we do not now anticipate,\r\nrendering a departure from it clearly justifiable under the imperative\r\nand overruling law of self-preservation.\r\n\r\nThe island of Cuba, from its geographical position, commands the\r\nmouth of the Mississippi and the immense and annually increasing\r\ntrade, foreign and coastwise, from the valley of that noble river,\r\nnow embracing half the sovereign States of the Union. With that island\r\nunder the dominion of a distant foreign power this trade, of vital\r\nimportance to these States, is exposed to the danger of being destroyed\r\nin time of war, and it has hitherto been subjected to perpetual injury\r\nand annoyance in time of peace. Our relations with Spain, which ought\r\nto be of the most friendly character, must always be placed in jeopardy\r\nwhilst the existing colonial government over the island shall remain in\r\nits present condition.\r\n\r\nWhilst the possession of the island would be of vast importance to the\r\nUnited States, its value to Spain is comparatively unimportant. Such\r\nwas the relative situation of the parties when the great Napoleon\r\ntransferred Louisiana to the United States. Jealous as he ever was of\r\nthe national honor and interests of France, no person throughout the\r\nworld has imputed blame to him for accepting a pecuniary equivalent\r\nfor this cession.\r\n\r\nThe publicity which has been given to our former negotiations upon this\r\nsubject and the large appropriation which may be required to effect the\r\npurpose render it expedient before making another attempt to renew the\r\nnegotiation that I should lay the whole subject before Congress. This\r\nis especially necessary, as it may become indispensable to success that\r\nI should be intrusted with the means of making an advance to the Spanish\r\nGovernment immediately after the signing of the treaty, without awaiting\r\nthe ratification of it by the Senate. I am encouraged to make this\r\nsuggestion by the example of Mr. Jefferson previous to the purchase of\r\nLouisiana from France and by that of Mr. Polk in view of the acquisition\r\nof territory from Mexico. I refer the whole subject to Congress and\r\ncommend it to their careful consideration.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation made in my message of December last in favor\r\nof an appropriation \"to be paid to the Spanish Government for the\r\npurpose of distribution among the claimants in the _Amistad_ case.\"\r\nPresident Polk first made a similar recommendation in December, 1847,\r\nand it was repeated by my immediate predecessor in December, 1853. I\r\nentertain no doubt that indemnity is fairly due to these claimants under\r\nour treaty with Spain of October 27, 1795; and whilst demanding justice\r\nwe ought to do justice. An appropriation promptly made for this purpose\r\ncould not fail to exert a favorable influence on our negotiations with\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nOur position in relation to the independent States south of us on this\r\ncontinent, and especially those within the limits of North America, is\r\nof a peculiar character. The northern boundary of Mexico is coincident\r\nwith our own southern boundary from ocean to ocean, and we must\r\nnecessarily feel a deep interest in all that concerns the well-being and\r\nthe fate of so near a neighbor. We have always cherished the kindest\r\nwishes for the success of that Republic, and have indulged the hope that\r\nit might at last, after all its trials, enjoy peace and prosperity\r\nunder a free and stable government. We have never hitherto interfered,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, with its internal affairs, and it is a duty\r\nwhich we owe to ourselves to protect the integrity of its territory\r\nagainst the hostile interference of any other power. Our geographical\r\nposition, our direct interest in all that concerns Mexico, and our\r\nwell-settled policy in regard to the North American continent render\r\nthis an indispensable duty.\r\n\r\nMexico has been in a state of constant revolution almost ever since it\r\nachieved its independence. One military leader after another has usurped\r\nthe Government in rapid succession, and the various constitutions from\r\ntime to time adopted have been set at naught almost as soon as they\r\nwere proclaimed. The successive Governments have afforded no adequate\r\nprotection, either to Mexican citizens or foreign residents, against\r\nlawless violence. Heretofore a seizure of the capital by a military\r\nchieftain has been generally followed by at least the nominal submission\r\nof the country to his rule for a brief period, but not so at the present\r\ncrisis of Mexican affairs. A civil war has been raging for some time\r\nthroughout the Republic between the central Government at the City of\r\nMexico, which has endeavored to subvert the constitution last framed\r\nby military power, and those who maintain the authority of that\r\nconstitution. The antagonist parties each hold possession of different\r\nStates of the Republic, and the fortunes of the war are constantly\r\nchanging. Meanwhile the most reprehensible means have been employed by\r\nboth parties to extort money from foreigners, as well as natives, to\r\ncarry on this ruinous contest. The truth is that this fine country,\r\nblessed with a productive soil and a benign climate, has been reduced\r\nby civil dissension to a condition of almost hopeless anarchy and\r\nimbecility. It would be vain for this Government to attempt to enforce\r\npayment in money of the claims of American citizens, now amounting to\r\nmore than $10,000,000, against Mexico, because she is destitute of all\r\npecuniary means to satisfy these demands.\r\n\r\nOur late minister was furnished with ample powers and instructions for\r\nthe adjustment of all pending questions with the central Government of\r\nMexico, and he performed his duty with zeal and ability. The claims of\r\nour citizens, some of them arising out of the violation of an express\r\nprovision of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and others from gross\r\ninjuries to persons as well as property, have remained unredressed\r\nand even unnoticed. Remonstrances against these grievances have been\r\naddressed without effect to that Government. Meantime in various\r\nparts of the Republic instances have been numerous of the murder,\r\nimprisonment, and plunder of our citizens by different parties claiming\r\nand exercising a local jurisdiction; but the central Government,\r\nalthough repeatedly urged thereto, have made no effort either to\r\npunish the authors of these outrages or to prevent their recurrence.\r\nNo American citizen can now visit Mexico on lawful business without\r\nimminent danger to his person and property. There is no adequate\r\nprotection to either, and in this respect our treaty with that Republic\r\nis almost a dead letter.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs was brought to a crisis in May last by the\r\npromulgation of a decree levying a contribution _pro rata_ upon all the\r\ncapital in the Republic between certain specified amounts, whether held\r\nby Mexicans or foreigners. Mr. Forsyth, regarding this decree in the\r\nlight of a \"forced loan,\" formally protested against its application\r\nto his countrymen and advised them not to pay the contribution, but to\r\nsuffer it to be forcibly exacted. Acting upon this advice, an American\r\ncitizen refused to pay the contribution, and his property was seized by\r\narmed men to satisfy the amount. Not content with this, the Government\r\nproceeded still further and issued a decree banishing him from the\r\ncountry. Our minister immediately notified them that if this decree\r\nshould be carried into execution he would feel it to be his duty\r\nto adopt \"the most decided measures that belong to the powers and\r\nobligations of the representative office.\" Notwithstanding this warning,\r\nthe banishment was enforced, and Mr. Forsyth promptly announced to the\r\nGovernment the suspension of the political relations of his legation\r\nwith them until the pleasure of his own Government should be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nThis Government did not regard the contribution imposed by the decree\r\nof the 15th May last to be in strictness a \"forced loan,\" and as such\r\nprohibited by the tenth article of the treaty of 1826 between Great\r\nBritain and Mexico, to the benefits of which American citizens are\r\nentitled by treaty; yet the imposition of the contribution upon\r\nforeigners was considered an unjust and oppressive measure. Besides,\r\ninternal factions in other parts of the Republic were at the same\r\ntime levying similar exactions upon the property of our citizens and\r\ninterrupting their commerce. There had been an entire failure on the\r\npart of our minister to secure redress for the wrongs which our citizens\r\nhad endured, notwithstanding his persevering efforts. And from the\r\ntemper manifested by the Mexican Government he had repeatedly assured\r\nus that no favorable change could be expected until the United States\r\nshould \"give striking evidence of their will and power to protect their\r\ncitizens,\" and that \"severe chastening is the only earthly remedy\r\nfor our grievances.\" From this statement of facts it would have been\r\nworse than idle to direct Mr. Forsyth to retrace his steps and resume\r\ndiplomatic relations with that Government, and it was therefore deemed\r\nproper to sanction his withdrawal of the legation from the City\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\nAbundant cause now undoubtedly exists for a resort to hostilities\r\nagainst the Government still holding possession of the capital. Should\r\nthey succeed in subduing the constitutional forces, all reasonable hope\r\nwill then have expired of a peaceful settlement of our difficulties.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, should the constitutional party prevail and their\r\nauthority be established over the Republic, there is reason to hope that\r\nthey will be animated by a less unfriendly spirit and may grant that\r\nredress to American citizens which justice requires so far as they\r\nmay possess the means. But for this expectation I should at once have\r\nrecommended to Congress to grant the necessary power to the President\r\nto take possession of a sufficient portion of the remote and unsettled\r\nterritory of Mexico, to be held in pledge until our injuries shall be\r\nredressed and our just demands be satisfied. We have already exhausted\r\nevery milder means of obtaining justice. In such a case this remedy of\r\nreprisals is recognized by the law of nations, not only as just in\r\nitself, but as a means of preventing actual war.\r\n\r\nBut there is another view of our relations with Mexico, arising from the\r\nunhappy condition of affairs along our southwestern frontier, which\r\ndemands immediate action. In that remote region, where there are but few\r\nwhite inhabitants, large bands of hostile and predatory Indians roam\r\npromiscuously over the Mexican States of Chihuahua and Sonora and our\r\nadjoining Territories. The local governments of these States are\r\nperfectly helpless and are kept in a state of constant alarm by the\r\nIndians. They have not the power, if they possessed the will, even\r\nto restrain lawless Mexicans from passing the border and committing\r\ndepredations on our remote settlers. A state of anarchy and violence\r\nprevails throughout that distant frontier. The laws are a dead letter\r\nand life and property wholly insecure. For this reason the settlement of\r\nArizona is arrested, whilst it is of great importance that a chain of\r\ninhabitants should extend all along its southern border sufficient for\r\ntheir own protection and that of the United States mail passing to and\r\nfrom California. Well-founded apprehensions are now entertained that\r\nthe Indians and wandering Mexicans, equally lawless, may break up the\r\nimportant stage and postal communication recently established between\r\nour Atlantic and Pacific possessions. This passes very near to the\r\nMexican boundary throughout the whole length of Arizona. I can imagine\r\nno possible remedy for these evils and no mode of restoring law and\r\norder on that remote and unsettled frontier but for the Government of\r\nthe United States to assume a temporary protectorate over the northern\r\nportions of Chihuahua and Sonora and to establish military posts within\r\nthe same; and this I earnestly recommend to Congress. This protection\r\nmay be withdrawn as soon as local governments shall be established in\r\nthese Mexican States capable of performing their duties to the United\r\nStates, restraining the lawless, and preserving peace along the border.\r\n\r\nI do not doubt that this measure will be viewed in a friendly spirit by\r\nthe governments and people of Chihuahua and Sonora, as it will prove\r\nequally effectual for the protection of their citizens on that remote\r\nand lawless frontier as for citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nAnd in this connection permit me to recall your attention to the\r\ncondition of Arizona. The population of that Territory, numbering, as is\r\nalleged, more than 10,000 souls, are practically without a government,\r\nwithout laws, and without any regular administration of justice. Murder\r\nand other crimes are committed with impunity. This state of things calls\r\nloudly for redress, and I therefore repeat my recommendation for the\r\nestablishment of a Territorial government over Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe political condition of the narrow isthmus of Central America,\r\nthrough which transit routes pass between the Atlantic and Pacific\r\noceans, presents a subject of deep interest to all commercial nations.\r\nIt is over these transits that a large proportion of the trade and\r\ntravel between the European and Asiatic continents is destined to pass.\r\nTo the United States these routes are of incalculable importance as a\r\nmeans of communication between their Atlantic and Pacific possessions.\r\nThe latter now extend throughout seventeen degrees of latitude on the\r\nPacific coast, embracing the important State of California and the\r\nflourishing Territories of Oregon and Washington. All commercial nations\r\ntherefore have a deep and direct interest that these communications\r\nshall be rendered secure from interruption. If an arm of the sea\r\nconnecting the two oceans penetrated through Nicaragua and Costa Rica,\r\nit could not be pretended that these States would have the right to\r\narrest or retard its navigation to the injury of other nations. The\r\ntransit by land over this narrow isthmus occupies nearly the same\r\nposition. It is a highway in which they themselves have little interest\r\nwhen compared with the vast interests of the rest of the world. Whilst\r\ntheir rights of sovereignty ought to be respected, it is the duty of\r\nother nations to require that this important passage shall not be\r\ninterrupted by the civil wars and revolutionary outbreaks which have\r\nso frequently occurred in that region. The stake is too important to\r\nbe left at the mercy of rival companies claiming to hold conflicting\r\ncontracts with Nicaragua. The commerce of other nations is not to\r\nstand still and await the adjustment of such petty controversies. The\r\nGovernment of the United States expect no more than this, and they will\r\nnot be satisfied with less. They would not, if they could, derive any\r\nadvantage from the Nicaragua transit not common to the rest of the\r\nworld. Its neutrality and protection for the common use of all nations\r\nis their only object. They have no objection that Nicaragua shall demand\r\nand receive a fair compensation from the companies and individuals who\r\nmay traverse the route, but they insist that it shall never hereafter\r\nbe closed by an arbitrary decree of that Government. If disputes arise\r\nbetween it and those with whom they may have entered into contracts,\r\nthese must be adjusted by some fair tribunal provided for the purpose,\r\nand the route must not be closed pending the controversy. This is our\r\nwhole policy, and it can not fail to be acceptable to other nations.\r\n\r\nAll these difficulties might be avoided if, consistently with the good\r\nfaith of Nicaragua, the use of this transit could be thrown open to\r\ngeneral competition, providing at the same time for the payment of a\r\nreasonable rate to the Nicaraguan Government on passengers and freight.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1852, the Accessory Transit Company made its first\r\ninter-oceanic trip over the Nicaraguan route, and continued in\r\nsuccessful operation, with great advantage to the public, until the 18th\r\nFebruary, 1856, when it was closed and the grant to this company as well\r\nas its charter were summarily and arbitrarily revoked by the Government\r\nof President Rivas. Previous to this date, however, in 1854, serious\r\ndisputes concerning the settlement of their accounts had arisen between\r\nthe company and the Government, threatening the interruption of the\r\nroute at any moment. These the United States in vain endeavored to\r\ncompose. It would be useless to narrate the various proceedings which\r\ntook place between the parties up till the time when the transit was\r\ndiscontinued. Suffice it to say that since February, 1856, it has\r\nremained closed, greatly to the prejudice of citizens of the United\r\nStates. Since that time the competition has ceased between the rival\r\nroutes of Panama and Nicaragua, and in consequence thereof an unjust and\r\nunreasonable amount has been exacted from our citizens for their passage\r\nto and from California. A treaty was signed on the 16th day of November,\r\n1857, by the Secretary of State and minister of Nicaragua, under the\r\nstipulations of which the use and protection of the transit route would\r\nhave been secured, not only to the United States, but equally to all\r\nother nations. How and on what pretext this treaty has failed to receive\r\nthe ratification of the Nicaraguan Government will appear by the papers\r\nherewith communicated from the State Department. The principal objection\r\nseems to have been to the provision authorizing the United States to\r\nemploy force to keep the route open in case Nicaragua should fail\r\nto perform her duty in this respect. From the feebleness of that\r\nRepublic, its frequent changes of government, and its constant internal\r\ndissensions, this had become a most important stipulation, and one\r\nessentially necessary, not only for the security of the route, but for\r\nthe safety of American citizens passing and repassing to and from our\r\nPacific possessions. Were such a stipulation embraced in a treaty\r\nbetween the United States and Nicaragua, the knowledge of this fact\r\nwould of itself most probably prevent hostile parties from committing\r\naggressions on the route, and render our actual interference for its\r\nprotection unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe executive government of this country in its intercourse with foreign\r\nnations is limited to the employment of diplomacy alone. When this fails\r\nit can proceed no further. It can not legitimately resort to force\r\nwithout the direct authority of Congress, except in resisting and\r\nrepelling hostile attacks. It would have no authority to enter the\r\nterritories of Nicaragua even to prevent the destruction of the transit\r\nand protect the lives and property of our own citizens on their passage.\r\nIt is true that on a sudden emergency of this character the President\r\nwould direct any armed force in the vicinity to march to their relief,\r\nbut in doing this he would act upon his own responsibility.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I earnestly recommend to Congress the passage\r\nof an act authorizing the President, under such restrictions as they may\r\ndeem proper, to employ the land and naval forces of the United States\r\nin preventing the transit from being obstructed or closed by lawless\r\nviolence, and in protecting the lives and property of American citizens\r\ntraveling thereupon, requiring at the same time that these forces shall\r\nbe withdrawn the moment the danger shall have passed away. Without such\r\na provision our citizens will be constantly exposed to interruption in\r\ntheir progress and to lawless violence.\r\n\r\nA similar necessity exists for the passage of such an act for the\r\nprotection of the Panama and Tehuantepec routes.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the Panama route, the United States, by their existing\r\ntreaty with New Granada, expressly guarantee the neutrality of the\r\nIsthmus, \"with the view that the free transit from the one to the other\r\nsea may not be interrupted or embarrassed in any future time while this\r\ntreaty exists.\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Tehuantepec route, which has been recently opened\r\nunder the most favorable auspices, our treaty with Mexico of the 30th\r\nDecember, 1853, secures to the citizens of the United States a right\r\nof transit over it for their persons and merchandise and stipulates\r\nthat neither Government shall \"interpose any obstacle\" thereto. It\r\nalso concedes to the United States the \"right to transport across the\r\nIsthmus, in closed bags, the mails of the United States not intended for\r\ndistribution along the line of the communication; also the effects of\r\nthe United States Government and its citizens which may be intended for\r\ntransit and not for distribution on the Isthmus, free of custom-house\r\nor other charges by the Mexican Government.\"\r\n\r\nThese treaty stipulations with New Granada and Mexico, in addition to\r\nthe considerations applicable to the Nicaragua route, seem to require\r\nlegislation for the purpose of carrying them into effect.\r\n\r\nThe injuries which have been inflicted upon our citizens in Costa Rica\r\nand Nicaragua during the last two or three years have received the\r\nprompt attention of this Government. Some of these injuries were of the\r\nmost aggravated character. The transaction at Virgin Bay in April, 1856,\r\nwhen a company of unarmed Americans, who were in no way connected with\r\nany belligerent conduct or party, were fired upon by the troops of\r\nCosta Rica and numbers of them killed and wounded, was brought to the\r\nknowledge of Congress by my predecessor soon after its occurrence, and\r\nwas also presented to the Government of Costa Rica for that immediate\r\ninvestigation and redress which the nature of the case demanded. A\r\nsimilar course was pursued with reference to other outrages in these\r\ncountries, some of which were hardly less aggravated in their character\r\nthan the transaction at Virgin Bay. At the time, however, when our\r\npresent minister to Nicaragua was appointed, in December, 1857, no\r\nredress had been obtained for any of these wrongs and no reply even had\r\nbeen received to the demands which had been made by this Government upon\r\nthat of Costa Rica more than a year before. Our minister was instructed,\r\ntherefore, to lose no time in expressing to those Governments the deep\r\nregret with which the President had witnessed this inattention to the\r\njust claims of the United States and in demanding their prompt and\r\nsatisfactory adjustment. Unless this demand shall be complied with at an\r\nearly day it will only remain for this Government to adopt such other\r\nmeasures as may be necessary in order to obtain for itself that justice\r\nwhich it has in vain attempted to secure by peaceful means from the\r\nGovernments of Nicaragua and Costa Rica. While it has shown, and will\r\ncontinue to show, the most sincere regard for the rights and honor of\r\nthese Republics, it can not permit this regard to be met by an utter\r\nneglect on their part of what is due to the Government and citizens of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nAgainst New Granada we have long-standing causes of complaint, arising\r\nout of the unsatisfied claims of our citizens upon that Republic, and\r\nto these have been more recently added the outrages committed upon our\r\ncitizens at Panama in April, 1856. A treaty for the adjustment of these\r\ndifficulties was concluded by the Secretary of State and the minister\r\nof New Granada in September, 1857, which contained just and acceptable\r\nprovisions for that purpose. This treaty was transmitted to Bogota\r\nand was ratified by the Government of New Granada, but with certain\r\namendments. It was not, however, returned to this city until after\r\nthe close of the last session of the Senate. It will be immediately\r\ntransmitted to that body for their advice and consent, and should this\r\nbe obtained it will remove all our existing causes of complaint against\r\nNew Granada on the subject of claims.\r\n\r\nQuestions have arisen between the two Governments as to the right of New\r\nGranada to levy a tonnage duty upon the vessels of the United States in\r\nits ports of the Isthmus and to levy a passenger tax upon our citizens\r\narriving in that country, whether with a design to remain there or to\r\npass from ocean to ocean by the transit route; and also a tax upon the\r\nmail of the United States transported over the Panama Railroad. The\r\nGovernment of New Granada has been informed that the United States would\r\nconsider the collection of either of these taxes as an act in violation\r\nof the treaty between the two countries, and as such would be resisted\r\nby the United States. At the same time, we are prepared to discuss these\r\nquestions in a spirit of amity and justice and with a sincere desire to\r\nadjust them in a satisfactory manner. A negotiation for that purpose has\r\nalready been commenced. No effort has recently been made to collect\r\nthese taxes nor is any anticipated under present circumstances.\r\n\r\nWith the Empire of Brazil our relations are of the most friendly\r\ncharacter. The productions of the two countries, and especially those\r\nof an agricultural nature, are such as to invite extensive mutual\r\nexchanges. A large quantity of American flour is consumed in Brazil,\r\nwhilst more than treble the amount in value of Brazilian coffee is\r\nconsumed in the United States. Whilst this is the case, a heavy duty has\r\nbeen levied until very recently upon the importation of American flour\r\ninto Brazil. I am gratified, however, to be able to inform you that in\r\nSeptember last this has been reduced from $1.32 to about 49 cents per\r\nbarrel, and the duties on other articles of our production have been\r\ndiminished in nearly the same proportion.\r\n\r\nI regret to state that the Government of Brazil still continues to levy\r\nan export duty of about 11 per cent on coffee, notwithstanding this\r\narticle is admitted free from duty in the United States. This is a heavy\r\ncharge upon the consumers of coffee in our country, as we purchase\r\nhalf of the entire surplus crop of that article raised in Brazil. Our\r\nminister, under instructions, will reiterate his efforts to have this\r\nexport duty removed, and it is hoped that the enlightened Government\r\nof the Emperor will adopt this wise, just, and equal policy. In that\r\nevent, there is good reason to believe that the commerce between the\r\ntwo countries will greatly increase, much to the advantage of both.\r\n\r\nThe claims of our citizens against the Government of Brazil are not in\r\nthe aggregate of very large amount; but some of these rest upon plain\r\nprinciples of justice and their settlement ought not to be longer\r\ndelayed. A renewed and earnest, and I trust a successful, effort will\r\nbe made by our minister to procure their final adjustment.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of June last Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing\r\nthe President \"to adopt such measures and use such force as in his\r\njudgment may be necessary and advisable\" \"for the purpose of adjusting\r\nthe differences between the United States and the Republic of Paraguay\r\nin connection with the attack on the United States steamer _Water Witch_\r\nand with other measures referred to\" in his annual message, and on the\r\n12th of July following they made an appropriation to defray the expenses\r\nand compensation of a commissioner to that Republic should the President\r\ndeem it proper to make such an appointment.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with these enactments, I have appointed a commissioner,\r\nwho has proceeded to Paraguay with full powers and instructions to\r\nsettle these differences in an amicable and peaceful manner if this be\r\npracticable. His experience and discretion justify the hope that he may\r\nprove successful in convincing the Paraguayan Government that it is due\r\nboth to honor and justice that they should voluntarily and promptly make\r\natonement for the wrongs which they have committed against the United\r\nStates and indemnify our injured citizens whom they have forcibly\r\ndespoiled of their property.\r\n\r\nShould our commissioner prove unsuccessful after a sincere and earnest\r\neffort to accomplish the object of his mission, then no alternative will\r\nremain but the employment of force to obtain \"just satisfaction\" from\r\nParaguay. In view of this contingency, the Secretary of the Navy, under\r\nmy direction, has fitted out and dispatched a naval force to rendezvous\r\nnear Buenos Ayres, which, it is believed, will prove sufficient for the\r\noccasion. It is my earnest desire, however, that it may not be found\r\nnecessary to resort to this last alternative.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress met in December last the business of the country had\r\njust been crushed by one of those periodical revulsions which are the\r\ninevitable consequence of our unsound and extravagant system of bank\r\ncredits and inflated currency. With all the elements of national wealth\r\nin abundance, our manufactures were suspended, our useful public and\r\nprivate enterprises were arrested, and thousands of laborers were\r\ndeprived of employment and reduced to want. Universal distress prevailed\r\namong the commercial, manufacturing, and mechanical classes. This\r\nrevulsion was felt the more severely in the United States because\r\nsimilar causes had produced the like deplorable effects throughout the\r\ncommercial nations of Europe. All were experiencing sad reverses at the\r\nsame moment. Our manufacturers everywhere suffered severely, not because\r\nof the recent reduction in the tariff of duties on imports, but because\r\nthere was no demand at any price for their productions. The people were\r\nobliged to restrict themselves in their purchases to articles of prime\r\nnecessity. In the general prostration of business the iron manufacturers\r\nin different States probably suffered more than any other class, and\r\nmuch destitution was the inevitable consequence among the great number\r\nof workmen who had been employed in this useful branch of industry.\r\nThere could be no supply where there was no demand. To present an\r\nexample, there could be no demand for railroad iron after our\r\nmagnificent system of railroads, extending its benefits to every\r\nportion of the Union, had been brought to a dead pause. The same\r\nconsequences have resulted from similar causes to many other branches\r\nof useful manufactures. It is self-evident that where there is no\r\nability to purchase manufactured articles these can not be sold, and\r\nconsequently must cease to be produced.\r\n\r\nNo government, and especially a government of such limited powers as\r\nthat of the United States, could have prevented the late revulsion. The\r\nwhole commercial world seemed for years to have been rushing to this\r\ncatastrophe. The same ruinous consequences would have followed in the\r\nUnited States whether the duties upon foreign imports had remained as\r\nthey were under the tariff of 1846 or had been raised to a much higher\r\nstandard. The tariff of 1857 had no agency in the result. The general\r\ncauses existing throughout the world could not have been controlled by\r\nthe legislation of any particular country.\r\n\r\nThe periodical revulsions which have existed in our past history must\r\ncontinue to return at intervals so long as our present unbounded system\r\nof bank credits shall prevail. They will, however, probably be the less\r\nsevere in future, because it is not to be expected, at least for many\r\nyears to come, that the commercial nations of Europe, with whose\r\ninterests our own are so materially involved, will expose themselves to\r\nsimilar calamities. But this subject was treated so much at large in\r\nmy last annual message that I shall not now pursue it further. Still,\r\nI respectfully renew the recommendation in favor of the passage of a\r\nuniform bankrupt law applicable to banking institutions. This is all the\r\ndirect power over the subject which I believe the Federal Government\r\npossesses. Such a law would mitigate, though it might not prevent,\r\nthe evil. The instinct of self-preservation might produce a wholesome\r\nrestraint upon their banking business if they knew in advance that\r\na suspension of specie payments would inevitably produce their civil\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBut the effects of the revulsion are now slowly but surely passing away.\r\nThe energy and enterprise of our citizens, with our unbounded resources,\r\nwill within the period of another year restore a state of wholesome\r\nindustry and trade. Capital has again accumulated in our large cities.\r\nThe rate of interest is there very low. Confidence is gradually\r\nreviving, and so soon as it is discovered that this capital can be\r\nprofitably employed in commercial and manufacturing enterprises and in\r\nthe construction of railroads and other works of public and private\r\nimprovement prosperity will again smile throughout the land. It is\r\nvain, however, to disguise the fact from ourselves that a speculative\r\ninflation of our currency without a corresponding inflation in other\r\ncountries whose manufactures come into competition with our own must\r\never produce disastrous results to our domestic manufactures. No tariff\r\nshort of absolute prohibition can prevent these evil consequences.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject it is proper to refer to our financial\r\ncondition. The same causes which have produced pecuniary distress\r\nthroughout the country have so reduced the amount of imports from\r\nforeign countries that the revenue has proved inadequate to meet\r\nthe necessary expenses of the Government. To supply the deficiency,\r\nCongress, by the act of December 23, 1857, authorized the issue of\r\n$20,000,000 of Treasury notes; and this proving inadequate, they\r\nauthorized, by the act of June 14, 1858, a loan of $20,000,000,\r\n\"to be applied to the payment of appropriations made by law.\"\r\n\r\nNo statesman would advise that we should go on increasing the national\r\ndebt to meet the ordinary expenses of the Government. This would be\r\na most ruinous policy. In case of war our credit must be our chief\r\nresource, at least for the first year, and this would be greatly\r\nimpaired by having contracted a large debt in time of peace. It is our\r\ntrue policy to increase our revenue so as to equal our expenditures.\r\nIt would be ruinous to continue to borrow. Besides, it may be proper to\r\nobserve that the incidental protection thus afforded by a revenue tariff\r\nwould at the present moment to some extent increase the confidence of\r\nthe manufacturing interests and give a fresh impulse to our reviving\r\nbusiness. To this surely no person will object.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the mode of assessing and collecting duties under a\r\nstrictly revenue tariff, I have long entertained and often expressed\r\nthe opinion that sound policy requires this should be done by specific\r\nduties in cases to which these can be properly applied. They are well\r\nadapted to commodities which are usually sold by weight or by measure,\r\nand which from their nature are of equal or of nearly equal value. Such,\r\nfor example, are the articles of iron of different classes, raw sugar,\r\nand foreign wines and spirits.\r\n\r\nIn my deliberate judgment specific duties are the best, if not the only,\r\nmeans of securing the revenue against false and fraudulent invoices,\r\nand such has been the practice adopted for this purpose by other\r\ncommercial nations. Besides, specific duties would afford to the\r\nAmerican manufacturer the incidental advantages to which he is fairly\r\nentitled under a revenue tariff. The present system is a sliding scale\r\nto his disadvantage. Under it, when prices are high and business\r\nprosperous, the duties rise in amount when he least requires their\r\naid. On the contrary, when prices fall and he is struggling against\r\nadversity, the duties are diminished in the same proportion, greatly\r\nto his injury.\r\n\r\nNeither would there be danger that a higher rate of duty than that\r\nintended by Congress could be levied in the form of specific duties. It\r\nwould be easy to ascertain the average value of any imported article for\r\na series of years, and, instead of subjecting it to an _ad valorem_ duty\r\nat a certain rate _per centum_, to substitute in its place an equivalent\r\nspecific duty.\r\n\r\nBy such an arrangement the consumer would not be injured. It is true\r\nhe might have to pay a little more duty on a given article in one year,\r\nbut, if so, he would pay a little less in another, and in a series of\r\nyears these would counterbalance each other and amount to the same\r\nthing so far as his interest is concerned. This inconvenience would be\r\ntrifling when contrasted with the additional security thus afforded\r\nagainst frauds upon the revenue, in which every consumer is directly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nI have thrown out these suggestions as the fruit of my own observation,\r\nto which Congress, in their better judgment, will give such weight as\r\nthey may justly deserve.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will explain in detail the\r\noperations of that Department of the Government. The receipts into the\r\nTreasury from all sources during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1858,\r\nincluding the Treasury notes authorized by the act of December 23, 1857,\r\nwere $70,273,869.59, which amount, with the balance of $17,710,114.27\r\nremaining in the Treasury at the commencement of the year, made an\r\naggregate for the service of the year of $87,983,983.86.\r\n\r\nThe public expenditures during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1858,\r\namounted to $81,585,667.76, of which $9,684,537.99 were applied to the\r\npayment of the public debt and the redemption of Treasury notes with the\r\ninterest thereon, leaving in the Treasury on July 1, 1858, being the\r\ncommencement of the present fiscal year, $6,398,316.10.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the first quarter of the present\r\nfiscal year, commencing the 1st of July, 1858, including one-half of the\r\nloan of $20,000,000, with the premium upon it, authorized by the act\r\nof June 14, 1858, were $25,230,879.46, and the estimated receipts for\r\nthe remaining three quarters to the 30th of June, 1859, from ordinary\r\nsources are $38,500,000, making, with the balance before stated, an\r\naggregate of $70,129,195.56.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures during the first quarter of the present fiscal\r\nyear were $21,708,198.51, of which $1,010,142.37 were applied to the\r\npayment of the public debt and the redemption of Treasury notes and the\r\ninterest thereon. The estimated expenditures during the remaining three\r\nquarters to June 30, 1859, are $52,357,698.48, making an aggregate of\r\n$74,065,896.99, being an excess of expenditure beyond the estimated\r\nreceipts into the Treasury from ordinary sources during the fiscal year\r\nto the 30th of June, 1859, of $3,936,701.43. Extraordinary means are\r\nplaced by law within the command of the Secretary of the Treasury, by\r\nthe reissue of Treasury notes redeemed and by negotiating the balance\r\nof the loan authorized by the act of June 14, 1858, to the extent\r\nof $11,000,000, which, if realized during the present fiscal year,\r\nwill leave a balance in the Treasury on the 1st day of July, 1859,\r\nof $7,063,298.57.\r\n\r\nThe estimated receipts during the next fiscal year, ending June 30,\r\n1860, are $62,000,000, which, with the above-estimated balance of\r\n$7,063,298.57 make an aggregate for the service of the next fiscal year\r\nof $69,063,298.57. The estimated expenditures during the next fiscal\r\nyear, ending June 30, 1860, are $73,139,147.46, which leaves a deficit\r\nof estimated means, compared with the estimated expenditures, for that\r\nyear, commencing on July 1, 1859, of $4,075,848.89.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this sum the Postmaster-General will require from the\r\nTreasury for the service of the Post-Office Department $3,838,728, as\r\nexplained in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, which will\r\nincrease the estimated deficit on June 30, 1860, to $7,914,576.89.\r\nTo provide for the payment of this estimated deficiency, which will\r\nbe increased by such appropriations as may be made by Congress not\r\nestimated for in the report of the Treasury Department, as well as to\r\nprovide for the gradual redemption from year to year of the outstanding\r\nTreasury notes, the Secretary of the Treasury recommends such a revision\r\nof the present tariff as will raise the required amount. After what\r\nI have already said I need scarcely add that I concur in the opinion\r\nexpressed in his report--that the public debt should not be increased\r\nby an additional loan--and would therefore strongly urge upon Congress\r\nthe duty of making at their present session the necessary provision\r\nfor meeting these liabilities.\r\n\r\nThe public debt on July 1, 1858, the commencement of the present fiscal\r\nyear, was $25,155,977.66.\r\n\r\nDuring the first quarter of the present year the sum of $10,000,000 has\r\nbeen negotiated of the loan authorized by the act of June 14, 1858,\r\nmaking the present outstanding public debt, exclusive of Treasury notes,\r\n$35,155,977.66. There was on the 1st of July, 1858, of Treasury notes\r\nissued by authority of the act of December 23, 1857, unredeemed, the sum\r\nof $19,754,800, making the amount of actual indebtedness at that date\r\n$54,910,777.66. To this will be added $10,000,000 during the present\r\nfiscal year, this being the remaining half of the loan of $20,000,000\r\nnot yet negotiated.\r\n\r\nThe rapid increase of the public debt and the necessity which exists\r\nfor a modification of the tariff to meet even the ordinary expenses of\r\nthe Government ought to admonish us all, in our respective spheres of\r\nduty, to the practice of rigid economy. The objects of expenditure\r\nshould be limited in number, as far as this may be practicable, and the\r\nappropriations necessary to carry them into effect ought to be disbursed\r\nunder the strictest accountability. Enlightened economy does not\r\nconsist in the refusal to appropriate money for constitutional purposes\r\nessential to the defense, progress, and prosperity of the Republic, but\r\nin taking care that none of this money shall be wasted by mismanagement\r\nin its application to the objects designated by law.\r\n\r\nComparisons between the annual expenditure at the present time and what\r\nit was ten or twenty years ago are altogether fallacious. The rapid\r\nincrease of our country in extent and population renders a corresponding\r\nincrease of expenditure to some extent unavoidable. This is constantly\r\ncreating new objects of expenditure and augmenting the amount required\r\nfor the old. The true questions, then, are, Have these objects been\r\nunnecessarily multiplied, or has the amount expended upon any or all\r\nof them been larger than comports with due economy? In accordance with\r\nthese principles, the heads of the different Executive Departments of\r\nthe Government have been instructed to reduce their estimates for the\r\nnext fiscal year to the lowest standard consistent with the efficiency\r\nof the service, and this duty they have performed in a spirit of\r\njust economy. The estimates of the Treasury, War, Navy, and Interior\r\nDepartments have each been in some degree reduced, and unless a sudden\r\nand unforeseen emergency should arise it is not anticipated that a\r\ndeficiency will exist in either within the present or the next fiscal\r\nyear. The Post-Office Department is placed in a peculiar position,\r\ndifferent from the other Departments, and to this I shall hereafter\r\nrefer.\r\n\r\nI invite Congress to institute a rigid scrutiny to ascertain whether the\r\nexpenses in all the Departments can not be still further reduced, and\r\nI promise them all the aid in my power in pursuing the investigation.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the reports made to me by the Secretaries of War,\r\nof the Navy, of the Interior, and of the Postmaster-General. They each\r\ncontain valuable information and important recommendations, to which\r\nI invite the attention of Congress.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I took occasion to recommend the immediate\r\nconstruction of ten small steamers of light draft, for the purpose\r\nof increasing the efficiency of the Navy. Congress responded to the\r\nrecommendation by authorizing the construction of eight of them. The\r\nprogress which has been made in executing this authority is stated\r\nin the report of the Secretary of the Navy. I concur with him in the\r\nopinion that a greater number of this class of vessels is necessary for\r\nthe purpose of protecting in a more efficient manner the persons and\r\nproperty of American citizens on the high seas and in foreign countries,\r\nas well as in guarding more effectually our own coasts. I accordingly\r\nrecommend the passage of an act for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe suggestions contained in the report of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, especially those in regard to the disposition of the public\r\ndomain, the pension and bounty-land system, the policy toward the\r\nIndians, and the amendment of our patent laws, are worthy of the serious\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Post-Office Department occupies a position very different from\r\nthat of the other Departments. For many years it was the policy of the\r\nGovernment to render this a self-sustaining Department; and if this can\r\nnot now be accomplished, in the present condition of the country, we\r\nought to make as near an approach to it as may be practicable.\r\n\r\nThe Postmaster-General is placed in a most embarrassing position by the\r\nexisting laws. He is obliged to carry these into effect. He has no other\r\nalternative. He finds, however, that this can not be done without heavy\r\ndemands upon the Treasury over and above what is received for postage,\r\nand these have been progressively increasing from year to year until\r\nthey amounted for the last fiscal year, ending on the 30th of June,\r\n1858, to more than $4,500,000, whilst it is estimated that for the\r\npresent fiscal year they will amount to $6,290,000. These sums are\r\nexclusive of the annual appropriation of $700,000 for \"compensation for\r\nthe mail service performed for the two Houses of Congress and the other\r\nDepartments and officers of the Government in the transmission of free\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\nThe cause of these large deficits is mainly attributable to the\r\nincreased expense of transporting the mails. In 1852 the sum paid for\r\nthis service was but a fraction above four millions and a quarter. Since\r\nthat year it has annually increased, until in 1858 it has reached more\r\nthan eight millions and a quarter, and for the service of 1859 it is\r\nestimated that it will amount to more than $10,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe receipts of the Post-Office Department can be made to approach or to\r\nequal its expenditure only by means of the legislation of Congress. In\r\napplying any remedy care should be taken that the people shall not be\r\ndeprived of the advantages which they are fairly entitled to enjoy from\r\nthe Post-Office Department. The principal remedies recommended to the\r\nconsideration of Congress by the Postmaster-General are to restore the\r\nformer rate of postage upon single letters to 5 cents; to substitute\r\nfor the franking privilege the delivery to those now entitled to enjoy\r\nit of post-office stamps for their correspondence, and to direct the\r\nDepartment in making contracts for the transportation of the mail to\r\nconfine itself to the payment of the sum necessary for this single\r\npurpose, without requiring it to be transported in post coaches or\r\ncarriages of any particular description. Under the present system the\r\nexpense to the Government is greatly increased by requiring that the\r\nmail shall be carried in such vehicles as will accommodate passengers.\r\nThis will be done, without pay from the Department, over all roads\r\nwhere the travel will remunerate the contractors.\r\n\r\nThese recommendations deserve the grave consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nI would again call your attention to the construction of a Pacific\r\nrailroad. Time and reflection have but served to confirm me in the truth\r\nand justice of the observations which I made on this subject in my last\r\nannual message, to which I beg leave respectfully to refer.\r\n\r\nIt is freely admitted that it would be inexpedient for this Government\r\nto exercise the power of constructing the Pacific railroad by its own\r\nimmediate agents. Such a policy would increase the patronage of the\r\nExecutive to a dangerous extent, and introduce a system of jobbing and\r\ncorruption which no vigilance on the part of Federal officials could\r\neither prevent or detect. This can only be done by the keen eye and\r\nactive and careful supervision of individual and private interest. The\r\nconstruction of this road ought therefore to be committed to companies\r\nincorporated by the States or other agencies whose pecuniary interests\r\nwould be directly involved. Congress might then assist them in the\r\nwork by grants of land or of money, or both, under such conditions and\r\nrestrictions as would secure the transportation of troops and munitions\r\nof war free from any charge and that of the United States mail at a fair\r\nand reasonable price.\r\n\r\nThe progress of events since the commencement of your last session has\r\nshown how soon difficulties disappear before a firm and determined\r\nresolution. At that time such a road was deemed by wise and patriotic\r\nmen to be a visionary project. The great distance to be overcome and the\r\nintervening mountains and deserts in the way were obstacles which, in\r\nthe opinion of many, could not be surmounted. Now, after the lapse of\r\nbut a single year, these obstacles, it has been discovered, are far\r\nless formidable than they were supposed to be, and mail stages with\r\npassengers now pass and repass regularly twice in each week, by a common\r\nwagon road, between San Francisco and St. Louis and Memphis in less than\r\ntwenty-five days. The service has been as regularly performed as it was\r\nin former years between New York and this city.\r\n\r\nWhilst disclaiming all authority to appropriate money for the\r\nconstruction of this road, except that derived from the war-making power\r\nof the Constitution, there are important collateral considerations\r\nurging us to undertake the work as speedily as possible.\r\n\r\nThe first and most momentous of these is that such a road would be a\r\npowerful bond of union between the States east and west of the Rocky\r\nMountains. This is so self-evident as to require no illustration.\r\n\r\nBut again, in a commercial point of view, I consider this the great\r\nquestion of the day. With the eastern front of our Republic stretching\r\nalong the Atlantic and its western front along the Pacific, if all the\r\nparts should be united by a safe, easy, and rapid intercommunication we\r\nmust necessarily command a very large proportion of the trade both of\r\nEurope and Asia. Our recent treaties with China and Japan will open\r\nthese rich and populous Empires to our commerce; and the history of the\r\nworld proves that the nation which has gained possession of the trade\r\nwith eastern Asia has always become wealthy and powerful. The peculiar\r\ngeographical position of California and our Pacific possessions invites\r\nAmerican capital and enterprise into this fruitful field. To reap the\r\nrich harvest, however, it is an indispensable prerequisite that we shall\r\nfirst have a railroad to convey and circulate its products throughout\r\nevery portion of the Union. Besides, such a railroad through our\r\ntemperate latitude, which would not be impeded by the frosts and snows\r\nof winter nor by the tropical heats of summer, would attract to itself\r\nmuch of the travel and the trade of all nations passing between Europe\r\nand Asia.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of August last Lieutenant J.N. Maffit, of the United States\r\nbrig _Dolphin_, captured the slaver _Echo_ (formerly the _Putnam_, of\r\nNew Orleans) near Kay Verde, on the coast of Cuba, with more than 300\r\nAfrican negroes on board. The prize, under the command of Lieutenant\r\nBradford, of the United States Navy, arrived at Charleston on the 27th\r\nAugust, when the negroes, 306 in number, were delivered into the custody\r\nof the United States marshal for the district of South Carolina. They\r\nwere first placed in Castle Pinckney, and afterwards in Fort Sumter, for\r\nsafe-keeping, and were detained there until the 19th September, when the\r\nsurvivors, 271 in number, were delivered on board the United States\r\nsteamer _Niagara_ to be transported to the coast of Africa under the\r\ncharge of the agent of the United States, pursuant to the provisions of\r\nthe act of the 3d March, 1819, \"in addition to the acts prohibiting the\r\nslave trade.\" Under the second section of this act the President is\r\n\"authorized to make such regulations and arrangements as he may deem\r\nexpedient for the safe-keeping, support, and removal beyond the limits\r\nof the United States of all such negroes, mulattoes, or persons of\r\ncolor\" captured by vessels of the United States as may be delivered to\r\nthe marshal of the district into which they are brought, \"and to appoint\r\na proper person or persons residing upon the coast of Africa as agent or\r\nagents for receiving the negroes, mulattoes, or persons of color\r\ndelivered from on board vessels seized in the prosecution of the slave\r\ntrade by commanders of United States armed vessels.\"\r\n\r\nA doubt immediately arose as to the true construction of this act. It is\r\nquite clear from its terms that the President was authorized to provide\r\n\"for the safe-keeping, support, and removal\" of these negroes up till\r\nthe time of their delivery to the agent on the coast of Africa, but no\r\nexpress provision was made for their protection and support after they\r\nhad reached the place of their destination. Still, an agent was to be\r\nappointed to receive them in Africa, and it could not have been supposed\r\nthat Congress intended he should desert them at the moment they were\r\nreceived and turn them loose on that inhospitable coast to perish for\r\nwant of food or to become again the victims of the slave trade. Had this\r\nbeen the intention of Congress, the employment of an agent to receive\r\nthem, who is required to reside on the coast, was unnecessary, and they\r\nmight have been landed by our vessels anywhere in Africa and left\r\nexposed to the sufferings and the fate which would certainly await them.\r\n\r\nMr. Monroe, in his special message of December 17, 1819, at the first\r\nsession after the act was passed, announced to Congress what in his\r\nopinion was its true construction. He believed it to be his duty under\r\nit to follow these unfortunates into Africa and make provision for\r\nthem there until they should be able to provide for themselves. In\r\ncommunicating this interpretation of the act to Congress he stated that\r\nsome doubt had been entertained as to its true intent and meaning, and\r\nhe submitted the question to them so that they might, \"should it be\r\ndeemed advisable, amend the same before further proceedings are had\r\nunder it.\" Nothing was done by Congress to explain the act, and Mr.\r\nMonroe proceeded to carry it into execution according to his own\r\ninterpretation. This, then, became the practical construction. When\r\nthe Africans from on board the _Echo_ were delivered to the marshal at\r\nCharleston, it became my duty to consider what disposition ought to be\r\nmade of them under the law. For many reasons it was expedient to remove\r\nthem from that locality as speedily as possible. Although the conduct of\r\nthe authorities and citizens of Charleston in giving countenance to the\r\nexecution of the law was just what might have been expected from their\r\nhigh character, yet a prolonged continuance of 300 Africans in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of that city could not have failed to become a source\r\nof inconvenience and anxiety to its inhabitants. Where to send them was\r\nthe question. There was no portion of the coast of Africa to which they\r\ncould be removed with any regard to humanity except to Liberia. Under\r\nthese circumstances an agreement was entered into with the Colonization\r\nSociety on the 7th of September last, a copy of which is herewith\r\ntransmitted, under which the society engaged, for the consideration of\r\n$45,000, to receive these Africans in Liberia from the agent of the\r\nUnited States and furnish them during the period of one year thereafter\r\nwith comfortable shelter, clothing, provisions, and medical attendance,\r\ncausing the children to receive schooling, and all, whether children or\r\nadults, to be instructed in the arts of civilized life suitable to their\r\ncondition. This aggregate of $45,000 was based upon an allowance of $150\r\nfor each individual; and as there has been considerable mortality among\r\nthem and may be more before they reach Africa, the society have agreed,\r\nin an equitable spirit, to make such a deduction from the amount as\r\nunder the circumstances may appear just and reasonable. This can not\r\nbe fixed until we shall ascertain the actual number which may become\r\na charge to the society.\r\n\r\nIt was also distinctly agreed that under no circumstances shall this\r\nGovernment be called upon for any additional expenses.\r\n\r\nThe agents of the society manifested a laudable desire to conform to the\r\nwishes of the Government throughout the transaction. They assured me\r\nthat after a careful calculation they would be required to expend the\r\nsum of $150 on each individual in complying with the agreement, and they\r\nwould have nothing left to remunerate them for their care, trouble, and\r\nresponsibility. At all events, I could make no better arrangement, and\r\nthere was no other alternative. During the period when the Government\r\nitself, through its own agents, undertook the task of providing for\r\ncaptured negroes in Africa the cost per head was very much greater.\r\n\r\nThere having been no outstanding appropriation applicable to this\r\npurpose, I could not advance any money on the agreement. I therefore\r\nrecommend that an appropriation may be made of the amount necessary\r\nto carry it into effect.\r\n\r\nOther captures of a similar character may, and probably will, be made\r\nby our naval forces, and I earnestly recommend that Congress may amend\r\nthe second section of the act of March 3, 1819, so as to free its\r\nconstruction from the ambiguity which has so long existed and render\r\nthe duty of the President plain in executing its provisions.\r\n\r\nI recommend to your favorable regard the local interests of the District\r\nof Columbia. As the residence of Congress and the Executive Departments\r\nof the Government, we can not fail to feel a deep concern in its\r\nwelfare. This is heightened by the high character and the peaceful\r\nand orderly conduct of its resident inhabitants.\r\n\r\nI can not conclude without performing the agreeable duty of expressing\r\nmy gratification that Congress so kindly responded to the recommendation\r\nof my last annual message by affording me sufficient time before the\r\nclose of their late session for the examination of all the bills\r\npresented to me for approval. This change in the practice of Congress\r\nhas proved to be a wholesome reform. It exerted a beneficial influence\r\non the transaction of legislative business and elicited the general\r\napprobation of the country. It enabled Congress to adjourn with that\r\ndignity and deliberation so becoming to the representatives of this\r\ngreat Republic, without having crowded into general appropriation bills\r\nprovisions foreign to their nature and of doubtful constitutionality\r\nand expediency. Let me warmly and strongly commend this precedent\r\nestablished by themselves as a guide to their proceedings during the\r\npresent session.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty of amity and commerce between the United States\r\nand Japan, concluded at the city of Yeddo on the 29th of July last.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty between the United States and China, signed at\r\nTien-tsin by the plenipotentiaries of the parties on the 18th day of\r\nJune last.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _December 10, 1858_.\r\n\r\nThe PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nSIR: In compliance with the resolution of the Senate of June 12, 1858,\r\nI herewith communicate a report from the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nshowing \"the amount of money paid for pensions in each of the States\r\nand Territories since the commencement of the present Government.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 10, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a copy of the treaty between the United States\r\nand the Kingdom of Siam, concluded on the 29th of May, 1856, and\r\nproclaimed on the 16th of August last, and call the attention of that\r\nbody to the necessity of an act for carrying into effect the provisions\r\nof Article II of the said treaty, conferring certain judicial powers\r\nupon the consul of the United States who may be appointed to reside at\r\nBangkok. I would also suggest that the extension to the Kingdom of Siam\r\nof the provisions of the act approved August 11, 1848, entitled \"An\r\nact to carry into effect certain provisions in the treaties between\r\nthe United States and China and the Ottoman Porte, giving certain\r\njudicial powers to ministers and consuls of the United States in those\r\ncountries,\" might obviate the necessity of any other legislation upon\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE OFFICE,\r\n\r\n_Washington, December 15, 1858_.\r\n\r\nHon. JAMES L. ORR,\r\n\r\n_Speaker of the House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nSIR: In compliance with a resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 13th instant, requesting the President of the United States, if not\r\ninconsistent with the public interest, \"to communicate all information\r\nin his possession, or which may shortly come into his possession,\r\nrespecting the reported recent acts of visitation by officers of the\r\nBritish navy of American vessels in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico,\"\r\nI transmit the accompanying reports from the Secretaries of State and\r\nthe Navy. The report from the Secretary of State is not in strictness\r\nembraced by the terms of the resolution, but I deem it advisable to\r\ncommunicate to the House the information therein contained.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 20, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, with accompanying\r\ndocuments, in answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 7th of\r\nJanuary last, calling for all the official dispatches and correspondence\r\nof the Hon. Robert M. McLane and of the Hon. Peter Parker, late\r\ncommissioners of the United States in China, with the Department of\r\nState.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 20, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe Senate will learn from the thirty-five naval nominations herewith\r\nsubmitted the result of my investigations under the resolutions of\r\nCongress of March 10 and May 11, 1858. In compliance with these\r\nresolutions, I have carefully examined the records of the courts of\r\ninquiry in fifty-eight cases, and have arrived at the conclusion that\r\ntwenty-three of the officers ought to remain in the positions where\r\nthey have been fixed by the courts of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe records are very voluminous and the labor of examination, in which\r\nI have been materially assisted by the Secretary of the Navy, the\r\nAttorney-General, and the Commissioner of Patents, has consumed much\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of January 17, 1857, the courts of inquiry were directed\r\nto investigate \"the physical, mental, professional, and moral fitness\"\r\nof each officer who applied to them for relief. These investigations it\r\nwas my duty to review. They have been very extensive and searching, as\r\nthe Senate will perceive from an examination of the records, embracing\r\nin many instances almost the entire professional life of the individual\r\nfrom his first entrance into the service.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of my duty I found the greatest difficulty in\r\ndeciding what should be considered as \"moral fitness\" for the Navy.\r\nPhysical, mental, and professional fitness may be decided with a\r\nconsiderable degree of accuracy by a naval court of inquiry, but the\r\nquestion of moral fitness is of a very different character. There has\r\nbeen but one perfect standard of morality on earth, and how far a\r\ndeparture from His precepts and example must proceed in order to\r\ndisqualify an officer for the naval service is a question on which a\r\ngreat difference of honest opinion must always exist. On this question\r\nI have differed in several instances from the courts of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThere is one nomination which I regret that I have not the power to\r\npresent to the Senate, and this is in the case of Commodore Stewart.\r\nHis name stood on the Register at the head of the list of captains in\r\nthe Navy until it was removed from this well-earned position by the\r\nretiring board and placed on the list of retired officers. The deeply\r\nwounded feelings of this veteran officer, who had contributed so much\r\nto the efficiency and glory of the Navy from its infancy, prevented him\r\nfrom applying for restoration to his rank and submitting to a court of\r\ninquiry composed of his junior officers the question of his \"physical,\r\nmental, professional, and moral fitness\" for the naval service. I would\r\nere this have recommended to Congress the passage of a joint resolution\r\nto restore him to his former rank had I not believed this would more\r\nappropriately emanate from the legislative branch of Government.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate the original records in the\r\nfifty-eight cases to which I have referred. After they shall have been\r\nexamined by the Senate I would respectfully request that they might be\r\nreturned to the Navy Department.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 22, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and Belgium for\r\nregulating the commerce and navigation between the two countries,\r\nsigned in this city on the 17th of July last.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 23, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit for the consideration of the Senate a convention with New\r\nGranada, signed on the 10th day of September, 1857, and a translation of\r\nthe decree of the President of that Republic ratifying and confirming\r\nthe same with certain modifications and explanations.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 27, 1858_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a copy of a letter of the 8th of April last from the minister\r\nof the United States in China, and of the decree and regulation which\r\naccompanied it, for such revision thereof as Congress may deem\r\nexpedient, pursuant to the sixth section of the act approved 11th\r\nAugust, 1848.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January_ 4, _1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives the report of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, with the accompanying documents, containing\r\nthe information called for by the resolution of the House of the 23d\r\nDecember, 1858, concerning the correspondence in reference to the\r\nclearance of vessels at the port of Mobile.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the constitutional action of the Senate, the\r\narticles of agreement and convention made and concluded on the 19th day\r\nof June last with the Mendawakanton and Wahpakoota bands of the Dakota\r\nor Sioux Indians.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the constitutional action of the Senate, the\r\narticles of agreement and convention made and concluded on the 19th day\r\nof June last (1858) with the Sisseeton and Wahpaton bands of the Dakota\r\nor Sioux Indians, with accompanying papers from the Department of the\r\nInterior.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 5, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith to the Senate, for its consideration with a view\r\nto ratification, a convention between the United States and the Republic\r\nof Chili, signed by the plenipotentiaries of the parties on the 10th\r\nday of November last, providing for the reference to an arbiter of\r\nthe questions which have long been in controversy between the two\r\nGovernments relative to a sum of money, the proceeds of the cargo of\r\nthe brig _Macedonia_, alleged to have belonged to citizens of the\r\nUnited States, which was seized in the Valley of Sitana, in Peru,\r\nby orders of an officer in the service of the Republic of Chili.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 6, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a report from the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, with accompanying papers, in compliance with\r\na resolution adopted December 23, 1858, requesting the President of\r\nthe United States \"to communicate to the House, if not deemed by him\r\nincompatible with the public interest, the instructions which have been\r\ngiven to our naval commanders in the Gulf of Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 7, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit reports from the Secretary of the Treasury and\r\nPostmaster-General, with the accompanying papers, in compliance with\r\nthe resolution of the House adopted December 23, 1858, requesting the\r\nPresident of the United States to report \"what action, if any, has been\r\ntaken under the sixth section of the Post-Office appropriation act approved\r\nAugust 18, 1856, for the adjustment of the damages due Carmick\r\n& Ramsey, and if the said section of said law yet remains unexecuted\r\nthat the President report the reasons therefor.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 11, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution of the Senate passed on the 16th ultimo,\r\nrequesting me to communicate, if in my opinion not incompatible with\r\nthe public interest, any information in my possession in relation to\r\nthe landing of the bark _Wanderer_ on the coast of Georgia with a\r\ncargo of slaves, I herewith communicate the report made to me by the\r\nAttorney-General, to whom the resolution was referred. From that report\r\nit will appear that the offense referred to in the resolution has been\r\ncommitted and that effective measures have been taken to see the laws\r\nfaithfully executed. I concur with the Attorney-General in the opinion\r\nthat it would be incompatible with the public interest at this time to\r\ncommunicate the correspondence with the officers of the Government at\r\nSavannah or the instructions which they have received. In the meantime\r\nevery practicable effort has been made, and will be continued, to\r\ndiscover all the guilty parties and to bring them to justice.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 13, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit a report from the Comptroller, with a copy of the\r\nletter of Messrs. Johnson and Williams, in relation to the decision upon\r\nthe Carmick & Ramsey claim.\r\n\r\nThis should have accompanied the papers which have already been\r\ntransmitted to the House, but was omitted by mistake.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 15, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of State, in answer to\r\nthe resolution of the House of Representatives of the 10th instant,\r\nrequesting a communication of the correspondence between this Government\r\nand France and England respecting the acquisition of Cuba by the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 19, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 14th of June\r\nlast, requesting a list of claims of citizens of the United States on\r\nforeign governments, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State,\r\nwith the documents which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 21, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have this day transmitted to the Senate a digest of the statistics of\r\nmanufactures, according to the returns of the Seventh Census, prepared\r\nunder the direction of the Secretary of the Interior in accordance\r\nwith a provision contained in the first section of an act of Congress\r\napproved June 12, 1858, entitled \"An act making appropriations for\r\nsundry civil expenses of the Government for the year ending the 30th of\r\nJune, 1859.\" The magnitude of the work has prevented the preparation of\r\nanother copy.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 21, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, in answer\r\nto the resolution of the Senate of the 18th instant, requesting the\r\nPresident, if not incompatible with the public interest, \"to communicate\r\nto the Senate any and all correspondence between the Government of the\r\nUnited States and the Government of Her Catholic Majesty relating to any\r\nproposition for the purchase of the island of Cuba, which correspondence\r\nhas not been furnished to either House of Congress.\" From this it\r\nappears that no such correspondence has taken place which has not\r\nalready been communicated to Congress. In my late annual message I\r\nstated in reference to the purchase of Cuba that \"the publicity which\r\nhas been given to our former negotiations on this subject and the large\r\nappropriation which may be required to effect the purpose render it\r\nexpedient before making another attempt to renew the negotiation that\r\nI should lay the whole subject before Congress.\" I still entertain the\r\nsame opinion, deeming it highly important, if not indispensable to the\r\nsuccess of any negotiation which I might institute for this purpose,\r\nthat the measure should receive the previous sanction of Congress.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 21, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate a digest of the statistics of\r\nmanufactures according to the returns of the Seventh Census, prepared\r\nunder the direction of the Secretary of the Interior in accordance with\r\na provision in the first section of an act of Congress approved June 12,\r\n1858, entitled \"An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses\r\nof the Government for the year ending the 30th of June, 1859.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 26, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit another report from the Secretary of State, in answer to\r\nthe resolution of the Senate of the 14th of June last, requesting\r\ninformation on the subject of claims of citizens of the United States\r\nagainst foreign governments.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 26, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to Congress a report, dated the 25th instant, with the\r\naccompanying papers, received from the Secretary of State, in compliance\r\nwith the requirement of the eighteenth section of the act entitled\r\n\"An act to regulate the diplomatic and consular systems of the United\r\nStates,\" approved August 18, 1856.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 29, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a report from the Secretary of War, with the accompanying\r\ndocuments, recommending the repayment to Governor Douglas, of Vancouvers\r\nIsland, of the sum of $7,000, advanced by him to Governor Stevens, of\r\nWashington Territory, which was applied to the purchase of ammunition\r\nand subsistence stores for the forces of the United States in time of\r\nneed and at a critical period of the late Indian war in that Territory.\r\n\r\nAs this advance was made by Governor Douglas out of his own private\r\nmeans and from friendly motives toward the United States, I recommend\r\nthat an appropriation may be made for its immediate payment, with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 29, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 25th instant, I\r\ntransmit a copy of the report of the special agent of the United States\r\nrecently sent to Vancouvers Island and British Columbia.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 5, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn reply to the resolution of the Senate of the 4th ultimo, I transmit a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State, together with the papers[9] therein\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Correspondence with the United States minister to Peru and\r\nothers relative to the

as Wilkes's Exploring Expedition;\"\r\nalso, what number of copies of the said work have been ordered, how they\r\nhave been distributed, what number of persons are now employed thereon,\r\nhow long they have been employed, respectively, and the amount of the\r\nappropriation now remaining undrawn.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 12, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Secretary of State, with\r\naccompanying papers, in answer to the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the 14th of June last, requesting the communication\r\nof all information and correspondence which may have been received in\r\nregard to any consular officer engaged in business in violation of law.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _February 15, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report from the Attorney-General, in reply to\r\nthe resolution of the House of Representatives adopted on the 22d\r\nultimo, requesting the President of the United States to \"report what\r\ninformation has been received by him, if any, in regard to the recent\r\nimportation of Africans into the State of Georgia or any other State\r\nof this Union, and what steps have been taken to bring to trial and\r\npunishment the persons engaged in this inhuman violation of the laws\r\nof the United States and to prevent similar violations hereafter.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 18, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe brief period which remains of your present session and the great\r\nurgency and importance of legislative action before its termination for\r\nthe protection of American citizens and their property whilst in transit\r\nacross the Isthmus routes between our Atlantic and Pacific possessions\r\nrender it my duty again to recall this subject to your notice. I have\r\nheretofore presented it in my annual messages, both in December, 1857\r\nand 1858, to which I beg leave to refer. In the latter I state that--\r\n\r\n  The executive government of this country in its intercourse with\r\n  foreign nations is limited to the employment of diplomacy alone. When\r\n  this fails it can proceed no further. It can not legitimately resort\r\n  to force without the direct authority of Congress, except in resisting\r\n  and repelling hostile attacks. It would have no authority to enter the\r\n  territories of Nicaragua even to prevent the destruction of the transit\r\n  and protect the lives and property of our own citizens on their\r\n  passage. It is true that on a sudden emergency of this character the\r\n  President would direct any armed force in the vicinity to march\r\n  to their relief, but in doing this he would act upon his own\r\n  responsibility.\r\n\r\n  Under these circumstances I earnestly recommend to Congress the\r\n  passage of an act authorizing the President, under such restrictions\r\n  as they may deem proper, to employ the land and naval forces of the\r\n  United States in preventing the transit from being obstructed or\r\n  closed by lawless violence and in protecting the lives and property of\r\n  American citizens traveling thereupon, requiring at the same time that\r\n  these forces shall be withdrawn the moment the danger shall have passed\r\n  away. Without such a provision our citizens will be constantly exposed\r\n  to interruption in their progress and to lawless violence.\r\n\r\n  A similar necessity exists for the passage of such an act for the\r\n  protection of the Panama and Tehuantepee routes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother subject, equally important, commanded the attention of the\r\nSenate at the last session of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Republics south of the United States on this continent have,\r\nunfortunately, been frequently in a state of revolution and civil\r\nwar ever since they achieved their independence. As one or the other\r\nparty has prevailed and obtained possession of the ports open to foreign\r\ncommerce, they have seized and confiscated American vessels and their\r\ncargoes in an arbitrary and lawless manner and exacted money from\r\nAmerican citizens by forced loans and other violent proceedings to\r\nenable them to carry on hostilities. The executive governments of Great\r\nBritain, France, and other countries, possessing the war-making power,\r\ncan promptly employ the necessary means to enforce immediate redress for\r\nsimilar outrages upon their subjects. Not so the executive government\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nIf the President orders a vessel of war to any of these ports to demand\r\nprompt redress for outrages committed, the offending parties are\r\nwell aware that in case of refusal the commander can do no more than\r\nremonstrate. He can resort to no hostile act. The question must then be\r\nreferred to diplomacy, and in many cases adequate redress can never be\r\nobtained. Thus American citizens are deprived of the same protection\r\nunder the flag of their country which the subjects of other nations\r\nenjoy. The remedy for this state of things can only be supplied by\r\nCongress, since the Constitution has confided to that body alone the\r\npower to make war. Without the authority of Congress the Executive can\r\nnot lawfully direct any force, however near it may be to the scene of\r\ndifficulty, to enter the territory of Mexico, Nicaragua, or New Granada\r\nfor the purpose of defending the persons and property of American\r\ncitizens, even though they may be violently assailed whilst passing in\r\npeaceful transit over the Tehuantepec, Nicaragua, or Panama routes. He\r\ncan not, without transcending his constitutional power, direct a gun to\r\nbe fired into a port or land a seaman or marine to protect the lives\r\nof our countrymen on shore or to obtain redress for a recent outrage\r\non their property. The banditti which infest our neighboring Republic\r\nof Mexico, always claiming to belong to one or other of the hostile\r\nparties, might make a sudden descent on Vera Cruz or on the Tehuantepec\r\nroute, and he would have no power to employ the force on shipboard in\r\nthe vicinity for their relief, either to prevent the plunder of our\r\nmerchants or the destruction of the transit.\r\n\r\nIn reference to countries where the local authorities are strong\r\nenough to enforce the laws, the difficulty here indicated can seldom\r\nhappen; but where this is not the case and the local authorities do not\r\npossess the physical power, even if they possess the will, to protect\r\nour citizens within their limits recent experience has shown that\r\nthe American Executive should itself be authorized to render this\r\nprotection. Such a grant of authority, thus limited in its extent,\r\ncould in no just sense be regarded as a transfer of the war-making\r\npower to the Executive, but only as an appropriate exercise of that\r\npower by the body to whom it exclusively belongs. The riot at Panama\r\nin 1856, in which a great number of our citizens lost their lives,\r\nfurnishes a pointed illustration of the necessity which may arise for\r\nthe exertion of this authority.\r\n\r\nI therefore earnestly recommend to Congress, on whom the responsibility\r\nexclusively rests, to pass a law before their adjournment conferring on\r\nthe President the power to protect the lives and property of American\r\ncitizens in the cases which I have indicated, under such restrictions\r\nand conditions as they may deem advisable. The knowledge that such a\r\nlaw exists would of itself go far to prevent the outrages which it is\r\nintended to redress and to render the employment of force unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWithout this the President may be placed in a painful position before\r\nthe meeting of the next Congress. In the present disturbed condition of\r\nMexico and one or more of the other Republics south of us, no person can\r\nforesee what occurrences may take place before that period. In case\r\nof emergency, our citizens, seeing that they do not enjoy the same\r\nprotection with subjects of European Governments, will have just cause\r\nto complain. On the other hand, should the Executive interpose, and\r\nespecially should the result prove disastrous and valuable lives be\r\nlost, he might subject himself to severe censure for having assumed a\r\npower not confided to him by the Constitution. It is to guard against\r\nthis contingency that I now appeal to Congress.\r\n\r\nHaving thus recommended to Congress a measure which I deem necessary and\r\nexpedient for the interest and honor of the country, I leave the whole\r\nsubject to their wisdom and discretion.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 18, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, two conventions between the United States and China,\r\none providing for the adjustment of claims of citizens of the United\r\nStates on the Government of that Empire, the other for the regulation\r\nof trade, both signed at Shanghai on the 8th of November last.

This is the last day of the\r\npresent Congress, and no provision has yet been made for the payment\r\nof appropriations and to meet the outstanding Treasury notes issued\r\nunder the authority of law. From the information which has already\r\nbeen communicated to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury it is\r\nmanifest that the ordinary receipts into the Treasury, even under the\r\nmost favorable circumstances, will scarcely meet the ordinary expenses\r\nof the Government during the remainder of the present fiscal year,\r\nending on the 30th of June. At that time nearly eighteen millions of\r\nTreasury notes will have become due, and many of those not yet due are\r\ndaily paid for duties at the different ports, and there will be no\r\nmeans in the Treasury to meet them. Thus the country, which is full of\r\nresources, will be dishonored before the world, and the American people,\r\nwho are a debt-paying people, will be disgraced by the omission on our\r\npart to do our duty. It is impossible to avoid this catastrophe unless\r\nwe make provision this very day to meet the lawful demands on the public\r\nTreasury. If this were the first instead of the last session of a\r\nCongress, the case would be different. You might then be convened by\r\nproclamation for to-morrow morning. But there are now thirteen States of\r\nthe Union, entitled to seventy-eight Representatives, in which none have\r\nbeen elected. It will therefore be impracticable for a large majority\r\nof these States to elect their Members before the Treasury shall be\r\ncompelled to stop payment.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I earnestly recommend to Congress to make\r\nprovision within the few remaining hours of the session for the\r\npreservation of the public credit. The urgency of the case not only\r\njustifies but demands that, if necessary, this shall be done by a\r\nseparate bill. We ought to incur no risk when the good faith of the\r\ncountry is at stake.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The first is a pocket veto.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 7, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the last session of Congress, as appears by the\r\nJournal of the House of Representatives, \"a joint resolution in regard\r\nto the carrying the United States mails from Saint Josephs, Missouri,\r\nto Placerville, California,\" was presented to me for my approval. This\r\nresolution authorized and directed the Postmaster-General \"to order an\r\nincrease of speed upon said route, requiring the mails to be carried\r\nthrough in thirty days, instead of thirty-eight days, according to the\r\nexisting contract: _Provided_, The same can be done upon a _pro rata_\r\nincrease of compensation to the contractors.\"\r\n\r\nI did not approve this joint resolution: First, because it was presented\r\nto me at so late a period that I had not the time necessary on the\r\nday of the adjournment of the last session for an investigation of\r\nthe subject. Besides, no injury could result to the public, as the\r\nPostmaster-General already possessed the discretionary power under\r\nexisting laws to increase the speed upon this as well as all other\r\nmail routes.\r\n\r\nSecond. Because the Postmaster-General, at the moment in the Capitol,\r\ninformed me that the contractors themselves had offered to increase the\r\nspeed on this route to thirty instead of thirty-eight days at a less\r\ncost than that authorized by the joint resolution. Upon subsequent\r\nexamination it has been ascertained at the Post-Office Department that\r\ntheir bid, which is still depending, proposes to perform this service\r\nfor a sum less by $49,000 than that authorized by the resolution.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _February 24, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return with my objections to the House of Representatives, in which\r\nit originated, the bill entitled \"An act donating public lands to the\r\nseveral States and Territories which may provide colleges for the\r\nbenefit of agriculture and the mechanic arts,\" presented to me on the\r\n18th instant.\r\n\r\nThis bill makes a donation to the several States of 20,000 acres of\r\nthe public lands for each Senator and Representative in the present\r\nCongress, and also an additional donation of 20,000 acres for each\r\nadditional Representative to which any State may be entitled under\r\nthe census of 1860.\r\n\r\nAccording to a report from the Interior Department, based upon the\r\npresent number of Senators and Representatives, the lands given to the\r\nStates amount to 6,060,000 acres, and their value, at the minimum\r\nGovernment price of $1.25 per acre, to $7,575,000.\r\n\r\nThe object of this gift, as stated by the bill, is \"the endowment,\r\nsupport, and maintenance of at least one college [in each State] where\r\nthe leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific or\r\nclassical studies, to teach such branches of learning as are related to\r\nagriculture and the mechanic arts, as the legislatures of the States may\r\nrespectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical\r\neducation of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and\r\nprofessions in life.\"\r\n\r\nAs there does not appear from the bill to be any beneficiaries in\r\nexistence to which this endowment can be applied, each State is required\r\n\"to provide, within five years at least, not less than one college, or\r\nthe grant to said State shall cease.\" In that event the \"said State\r\nshall be bound to pay the United States the amount received of any lands\r\npreviously sold, and that the title to purchasers under the State shall\r\nbe valid.\"\r\n\r\nThe grant in land itself is confined to such States as have public lands\r\nwithin their limits worth $1.25 per acre in the opinion of the governor.\r\nFor the remaining States the Secretary of the Interior is directed to\r\nissue \"land scrip to the amount of their distributive shares in acres\r\nunder the provisions of this act, said scrip to be sold by said States,\r\nand the proceeds thereof applied to the uses and purposes prescribed in\r\nthis act, and for no other use or purpose whatsoever.\" The lands are\r\ngranted and the scrip is to be issued \"in sections or subdivisions of\r\nsections of not less than one-quarter of a section.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to an estimate from the Interior Department, the number of\r\nacres which will probably be accepted by States having public lands\r\nwithin their own limits will not exceed 580,000 acres (and it may be\r\nmuch less), leaving a balance of 5,480,000 acres to be provided for by\r\nscrip. These grants of land and land scrip to each of the thirty-three\r\nStates are made upon certain conditions, the principal of which is that\r\nif the fund shall be lost or diminished on account of unfortunate\r\ninvestments or otherwise the deficiency shall be replaced and made good\r\nby the respective States.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to state my objections to this bill. I deem it to be\r\nboth inexpedient and unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n1. This bill has been passed at a period when we can with great\r\ndifficulty raise sufficient revenue to sustain the expenses of the\r\nGovernment. Should it become a law the Treasury will be deprived of the\r\nwhole, or nearly the whole, of our income from the sale of public lands,\r\nwhich for the next fiscal year has been estimated at $5,000,000.\r\n\r\nA bare statement of the case will make this evident. The minimum price\r\nat which we dispose of our lands is $1.25 per acre. At the present\r\nmoment, however, the price has been reduced to those who purchase the\r\nbounty-land warrants of the old soldiers to 85 cents per acre, and of\r\nthese warrants there are still outstanding and unlocated, as appears by\r\na report (February 12, 1859) from the General Land Office, the amount\r\nof 11,990,391 acres. This has already greatly reduced the current sales\r\nby the Government and diminished the revenue from this source. If in\r\naddition thirty-three States shall enter the market with their land\r\nscrip, the price must be greatly reduced below even 85 cents per acre,\r\nas much to the prejudice of the old soldiers who have not already parted\r\nwith their land warrants as to Government. It is easy to perceive that\r\nwith this glut of the market Government can sell little or no lands at\r\n$1.25 per acre, when the price of bounty-land warrants and scrip shall\r\nbe reduced to half this sum. This source of revenue will be almost\r\nentirely dried up. Under the bill the States may sell their land scrip\r\nat any price it may bring. There is no limitation whatever in this\r\nrespect. Indeed, they must sell for what the scrip will bring, for\r\nwithout this fund they can not proceed to establish their colleges\r\nwithin the five years to which they are limited. It is manifest,\r\ntherefore, that to the extent to which this bill will prevent the sale\r\nof public lands at $1.25 per acre, to that amount it will have precisely\r\nthe same effect upon the Treasury as if we should impose a tax to create\r\na loan to endow these State colleges.\r\n\r\nSurely the present is the most unpropitious moment which could have been\r\nselected for the passage of this bill.\r\n\r\n2. Waiving for the present the question of constitutional power,\r\nwhat effect will this bill have on the relations established between\r\nthe Federal and State Governments? The Constitution is a grant to\r\nCongress of a few enumerated but most important powers, relating chiefly\r\nto war, peace, foreign and domestic commerce, negotiation, and other\r\nsubjects which can be best or alone exercised beneficially by the common\r\nGovernment. All other powers are reserved to the States and to the\r\npeople. For the efficient and harmonious working of both, it is\r\nnecessary that their several spheres of action should be kept distinct\r\nfrom each other. This alone can prevent conflict and mutual injury.\r\nShould the time ever arrive when the State governments shall look to the\r\nFederal Treasury for the means of supporting themselves and maintaining\r\ntheir systems of education and internal policy, the character of both\r\nGovernments will be greatly deteriorated. The representatives of the\r\nStates and of the people, feeling a more immediate interest in obtaining\r\nmoney to lighten the burdens of their constituents than for the\r\npromotion of the more distant objects intrusted to the Federal\r\nGovernment, will naturally incline to obtain means from the Federal\r\nGovernment for State purposes. If a question shall arise between an\r\nappropriation of land or money to carry into effect the objects of the\r\nFederal Government and those of the States, their feelings will be\r\nenlisted in favor of the latter. This is human nature; and hence the\r\nnecessity of keeping the two Governments entirely distinct. The\r\npreponderance of this home feeling has been manifested by the passage of\r\nthe present bill. The establishment of these colleges has prevailed over\r\nthe pressing wants of the common Treasury. No nation ever had such an\r\ninheritance as we possess in the public lands. These ought to be managed\r\nwith the utmost care, but at the same time with a liberal spirit toward\r\nactual settlers.\r\n\r\nIn the first year of a war with a powerful naval nation the revenue from\r\ncustoms must in a great degree cease. A resort to loans will then become\r\nnecessary, and these can always be obtained, as our fathers obtained\r\nthem, on advantageous terms by pledging the public lands as security.\r\nIn this view of the subject it would be wiser to grant money to the\r\nStates for domestic purposes than to squander away the public lands\r\nand transfer them in large bodies into the hands of speculators.\r\n\r\nA successful struggle on the part of the State governments with the\r\nGeneral Government for the public lands would deprive the latter of\r\nthe means of performing its high duties, especially at critical and\r\ndangerous periods. Besides, it would operate with equal detriment to the\r\nbest interests of the States. It would remove the most wholesome of all\r\nrestraints on legislative bodies--that of being obliged to raise money\r\nby taxation from their constituents--and would lead to extravagance, if\r\nnot to corruption. What is obtained easily and without responsibility\r\nwill be lavishly expended.\r\n\r\n3. This bill, should it become a law, will operate greatly to the injury\r\nof the new States. The progress of settlements and the increase of an\r\nindustrious population owning an interest in the soil they cultivate\r\nare the causes which will build them up into great and flourishing\r\ncommonwealths. Nothing could be more prejudicial to their interests than\r\nfor wealthy individuals to acquire large tracts of the public land and\r\nhold them for speculative purposes. The low price to which this land\r\nscrip will probably be reduced will tempt speculators to buy it in large\r\namounts and locate it on the best lands belonging to the Government. The\r\neventual consequence must be that the men who desire to cultivate the\r\nsoil will be compelled to purchase these very lands at rates much higher\r\nthan the price at which they could be obtained from the Government.\r\n\r\n4. It is extremely doubtful, to say the least, whether this bill\r\nwould contribute to the advancement of agriculture and the mechanic\r\narts--objects the dignity and value of which can not be too highly\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government, which makes the donation, has confessedly no\r\nconstitutional power to follow it into the States and enforce the\r\napplication of the fund to the intended objects. As donors we shall\r\npossess no control over our own gift after it shall have passed from\r\nour hands. It is true that the State legislatures are required to\r\nstipulate that they will faithfully execute the trust in the manner\r\nprescribed by the bill. But should they fail to do this, what would be\r\nthe consequence? The Federal Government has no power, and ought to have\r\nno power, to compel the execution of the trust. It would be in as\r\nhelpless a condition as if, even in this, the time of great need, we\r\nwere to demand any portion of the many millions of surplus revenue\r\ndeposited with the States for safekeeping under the act of 1836.\r\n\r\n5. This bill will injuriously interfere with existing colleges in the\r\ndifferent States, in many of which agriculture is taught as a science\r\nand in all of which it ought to be so taught. These institutions of\r\nlearning have grown up with the growth of the country, under the\r\nfostering care of the States and the munificence of individuals, to meet\r\nthe advancing demands for education. They have proved great blessings to\r\nthe people. Many, indeed most, of them are poor and sustain themselves\r\nwith difficulty. What the effect will be on these institutions of\r\ncreating an indefinite number of rival colleges sustained by the\r\nendowment of the Federal Government it is not difficult to determine.\r\n\r\nUnder this bill it is provided that scientific and classical studies\r\nshall not be excluded from them. Indeed, it would be almost impossible\r\nto sustain them without such a provision, for no father would incur the\r\nexpense of sending a son to one of these institutions for the sole\r\npurpose of making him a scientific farmer or mechanic. The bill itself\r\nnegatives this idea, and declares that their object is \"to promote the\r\nliberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several\r\npursuits and professions of life.\" This certainly ought to be the\r\ncase. In this view of the subject it would be far better, if such an\r\nappropriation of land must be made to institutions of learning in\r\nthe several States, to apply it directly to the establishment of\r\nprofessorships of agriculture and the mechanic arts in existing\r\ncolleges, without the intervention of the State legislatures. It would\r\nbe difficult to foresee how these legislatures will manage this fund.\r\nEach Representative in Congress for whose district the proportion of\r\n20,000 acres has been granted will probably insist that the proceeds\r\nshall be expended within its limits. There will undoubtedly be a\r\nstruggle between different localities in each State concerning the\r\ndivision of the gift, which may end in disappointing the hopes of the\r\ntrue friends of agriculture. For this state of things we are without\r\nremedy. Not so in regard to State colleges. We might grant land to these\r\ncorporations to establish agricultural and mechanical professorships,\r\nand should they fail to comply with the conditions on which they\r\naccepted the grant we might enforce specific performance of these\r\nbefore the ordinary courts of justice.\r\n\r\n6. But does Congress possess the power under the Constitution to make a\r\ndonation of public lands to the different States of the Union to provide\r\ncolleges for the purpose of educating their own people?\r\n\r\nI presume the general proposition is undeniable that Congress does not\r\npossess the power to appropriate money in the Treasury, raised by taxes\r\non the people of the United States, for the purpose of educating the\r\npeople of the respective States. It will not be pretended that any such\r\npower is to be found among the specific powers granted to Congress nor\r\nthat \"it is necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" any one of\r\nthese powers. Should Congress exercise such a power, this would be to\r\nbreak down the barriers which have been so carefully constructed in the\r\nConstitution to separate Federal from State authority. We should then\r\nnot only \"lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises\" for\r\nFederal purposes, but for every State purpose which Congress might deem\r\nexpedient or useful. This would be an actual consolidation of the\r\nFederal and State Governments so far as the great taxing and money power\r\nis concerned, and constitute a sort of partnership between the two in\r\nthe Treasury of the United States, equally ruinous to both.\r\n\r\nBut it is contended that the public lands are placed upon a different\r\nfooting from money raised by taxation and that the proceeds arising from\r\ntheir sale are not subject to the limitations of the Constitution, but\r\nmay be appropriated or given away by Congress, at its own discretion,\r\nto States, corporations, or individuals for any purpose they may deem\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of this bill attempt to sustain their position upon the\r\nlanguage of the second clause of the third section of the fourth article\r\nof the Constitution, which declares that \"the Congress shall have power\r\nto dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting\r\nthe territory or other property belonging to the United States.\" They\r\ncontend that by a fair interpretation of the words \"dispose of\" in this\r\nclause Congress possesses the power to make this gift of public lands\r\nto the States for purposes of education.\r\n\r\nIt would require clear and strong evidence to induce the belief that the\r\nframers of the Constitution, after having limited the powers of Congress\r\nto certain precise and specific objects, intended by employing the words\r\n\"dispose of\" to give that body unlimited power over the vast public\r\ndomain. It would be a strange anomaly, indeed, to have created two\r\nfunds--the one by taxation, confined to the execution of the enumerated\r\npowers delegated to Congress, and the other from the public lands,\r\napplicable to all subjects, foreign and domestic, which Congress might\r\ndesignate; that this fund should be \"disposed of,\" not to pay the debts\r\nof the United States, nor \"to raise and support armies,\" nor \"to provide\r\nand maintain a navy,\" nor to accomplish any one of the other great\r\nobjects enumerated in the Constitution, but be diverted from them to\r\npay the debts of the States, to educate their people, and to carry into\r\neffect any other measure of their domestic policy. This would be to\r\nconfer upon Congress a vast and irresponsible authority, utterly at war\r\nwith the well-known jealousy of Federal power which prevailed at the\r\nformation of the Constitution. The natural intendment would be that as\r\nthe Constitution confined Congress to well-defined specific powers, the\r\nfunds placed at their command, whether in land or money, should be\r\nappropriated to the performance of the duties corresponding with these\r\npowers. If not, a Government has been created with all its other powers\r\ncarefully limited, but without any limitation in respect to the public\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nBut I can not so read the words \"dispose of\" as to make them embrace\r\nthe idea of \"giving away.\" The true meaning of words is always to be\r\nascertained by the subject to which they are applied and the known\r\ngeneral intent of the lawgiver. Congress is a trustee under the\r\nConstitution for the people of the United States to \"dispose of\" their\r\npublic lands, and I think I may venture to assert with confidence that\r\nno case can be found in which a trustee in the position of Congress has\r\nbeen authorized to \"_dispose of_\" property by its owner where it has\r\nbeen held that these words authorized such trustee to give away the fund\r\nintrusted to his care. No trustee, when called upon to account for the\r\ndisposition of the property placed under his management before any\r\njudicial tribunal, would venture to present such a plea in his defense.\r\nThe true meaning of these words is clearly stated by Chief Justice Taney\r\nin delivering the opinion of the court (19 Howard, p. 436). He says in\r\nreference to this clause of the Constitution:\r\n\r\nIt begins its enumeration of powers by that of disposing; in other\r\nwords, making sale of the lands or raising money from them, which, as we\r\nhave already said, was the main object of the cession (from the States),\r\nand which is the first thing provided for in the article.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to refer to the history of the times to establish the\r\nknown fact that this statement of the Chief Justice is perfectly well\r\nfounded. That it never was intended by the framers of the Constitution\r\nthat these lands should be given away by Congress is manifest from the\r\nconcluding portion of the same clause. By it Congress has power not only\r\n\"to dispose of\" the territory, but of the \"other property of the United\r\nStates.\" In the language of the Chief Justice (p. 437):\r\n\r\nAnd the same power of making needful rules respecting the territory is\r\nin precisely the same language applied to the other property of the\r\nUnited States, associating the power over the territory in this respect\r\nwith the power over movable or personal property; that is, the ships,\r\narms, or munitions of war which then belonged in common to the State\r\nsovereignties.\r\n\r\nThe question is still clearer in regard to the public lands in the\r\nStates and Territories within the Louisiana and Florida purchases.\r\nThese lands were paid for out of the public Treasury from money raised\r\nby taxation. Now if Congress had no power to appropriate the money with\r\nwhich these lands were purchased, is it not clear that the power over\r\nthe lands is equally limited? The mere conversion of this money into\r\nland could not confer upon Congress new power over the disposition of\r\nland which they had not possessed over money. If it could, then a\r\ntrustee, by changing the character of the fund intrusted to his care for\r\nspecial objects from money into land, might give the land away or devote\r\nit to any purpose he thought proper, however foreign from the trust.\r\nThe inference is irresistible that this land partakes of the very same\r\ncharacter with the money paid for it, and can be devoted to no objects\r\ndifferent from those to which the money could have been devoted. If this\r\nwere not the case, then by the purchase of a new territory from a\r\nforeign government out of the public Treasury Congress could enlarge\r\ntheir own powers and appropriate the proceeds of the sales of the land\r\nthus purchased, at their own discretion, to other and far different\r\nobjects from what they could have applied the purchase money which had\r\nbeen raised by taxation.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted truly that Congress in numerous instances have\r\ngranted lands for the purposes of education. These grants have been\r\nchiefly, if not exclusively, made to the new States as they successively\r\nentered the Union, and consisted at the first of one section and\r\nafterwards of two sections of the public land in each township for\r\nthe use of schools, as well as of additional sections for a State\r\nuniversity. Such grants are not, in my opinion, a violation of the\r\nConstitution. The United States is a great landed proprietor, and from\r\nthe very nature of this relation it is both the right and the duty of\r\nCongress as their trustee to manage these lands as any other prudent\r\nproprietor would manage them for his own best advantage. Now no\r\nconsideration could be presented of a stronger character to induce the\r\nAmerican people to brave the difficulties and hardships of frontier life\r\nand to settle upon these lands and to purchase them at a fair price\r\nthan to give to them and to their children an assurance of the means of\r\neducation. If any prudent individual had held these lands, he could not\r\nhave adopted a wiser course to bring them into market and enhance their\r\nvalue than to give a portion of them for purposes of education. As a\r\nmere speculation he would pursue this course. No person will contend\r\nthat donations of land to all the States of the Union for the erection\r\nof colleges within the limits of each can be embraced by this principle.\r\nIt can not be pretended that an agricultural college in New York or\r\nVirginia would aid the settlement or facilitate the sale of public lands\r\nin Minnesota or California. This can not possibly be embraced within the\r\nauthority which a prudent proprietor of land would exercise over his own\r\npossessions. I purposely avoid any attempt to define what portions of\r\nland may be granted, and for what purposes, to improve the value and\r\npromote the settlement and sale of the remainder without violating the\r\nConstitution. In this case I adopt the rule that \"sufficient unto the\r\nday is the evil thereof.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\nWhereas an extraordinary occasion has occurred rendering it necessary\r\nand proper that the Senate of the United States shall be convened to\r\nreceive and act upon such communications as have been or may be made\r\nto it on the part of the Executive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Buchanan, President of the United States, do\r\nissue this my proclamation, declaring that an extraordinary occasion\r\nrequires the Senate of the United States to convene for the transaction\r\nof business at the Capitol, in the city of Washington, on the 4th day of\r\nnext month, at 12 o'clock at noon of that day, of which all who shall\r\nthen be entitled to act as members of that body are hereby required to\r\ntake notice.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthis 26th day of February, A.D. 1859, and of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States the eighty-third.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  LEWIS CASS,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 9, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIt has become my sad duty to announce to the Senate the death of Aaron\r\nV. Brown, late Postmaster-General, at his residence in this city on\r\nyesterday morning at twenty minutes past 9 o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe death of this distinguished public officer, especially at the\r\npresent moment, when his eminent services are so much needed, is a great\r\nloss to his country. He was able, honest, and indefatigable in the\r\ndischarge of his high and responsible duties, whilst his benevolent\r\nheart and his kind deportment endeared him to all who approached him.\r\n\r\nSubmitting, as I do, with humble resignation to the will of Divine\r\nProvidence in this calamitous dispensation, I shall ever cherish his\r\nmemory with affectionate regard.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE ORDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Evening Star, March 10, 1859.]\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDER.\r\n\r\nWAR DEPARTMENT,\r\n\r\n_Washington, March 8, 1859_.\r\n\r\nUnder instructions from the President of the United States, the\r\nSecretary of War with unfeigned sorrow announces to the Army the decease\r\nof the Hon. A.V. Brown, Postmaster-General, which occurred in this city\r\nat an early hour this morning.\r\n\r\nAn enlightened statesman and a distinguished and able member of the\r\nGeneral Government has thus been stricken down at his post. The nation\r\nwill mourn the afflicting dispensation which has left so great a void in\r\nits councils. A worthy and estimable citizen has been removed from the\r\ncircle of his numerous friends. Society will mingle its grief with the\r\npatriotic regrets which the loss of a statesman will not fail to call\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nWhile the President, with the surviving members of the Cabinet, the\r\nlegislative and judicial departments of the Government, will unite in\r\nevery testimonial the sad occasion demands, it is fitting a similar\r\nrespect should be shown to the memory of the distinguished deceased\r\nby the national arms of defense. Accordingly, half-hour guns will be\r\nfired from sunrise to sunset at every garrisoned military post the\r\nday succeeding the receipt of this order, the national flag will be\r\ndisplayed at half-staff during the same time, and officers of the Army\r\nwill wear for three months the proper badge of military mourning.\r\n\r\nThe War Department and its bureaus will be closed until the day\r\nsucceeding the funeral obsequies.\r\n\r\nJOHN B FLOYD,\r\n\r\n_Secretary of War_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From the Daily National Intelligencer, March 10, 1859.]\r\n\r\nGENERAL ORDER.\r\n\r\nNAVY DEPARTMENT, _March 9, 1859_.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy, by the direction of the President, announces\r\nto the Navy and to the Marine Corps the lamented death of the Hon.

The general health of the country has been excellent,\r\nour harvests have been unusually plentiful, and prosperity smiles\r\nthroughout the land. Indeed, notwithstanding our demerits, we have much\r\nreason to believe from the past events in our history that we have\r\nenjoyed the special protection of Divine Providence ever since our\r\norigin as a nation. We have been exposed to many threatening and\r\nalarming difficulties in our progress, but on each successive occasion\r\nthe impending cloud has been dissipated at the moment it appeared ready\r\nto burst upon our head, and the danger to our institutions has passed\r\naway. May we ever be under the divine guidance and protection.\r\n\r\nWhilst it is the duty of the President \"from time to time to give to\r\nCongress information of the state of the Union,\" I shall not refer in\r\ndetail to the recent sad and bloody occurrences at Harpers Ferry. Still,\r\nit is proper to observe that these events, however bad and cruel in\r\nthemselves, derive their chief importance from the apprehension that\r\nthey are but symptoms of an incurable disease in the public mind, which\r\nmay break out in still more dangerous outrages and terminate at last in\r\nan open war by the North to abolish slavery in the South.\r\n\r\nWhilst for myself I entertain no such apprehension, they ought to\r\nafford a solemn warning to us all to beware of the approach of danger.\r\nOur Union is a stake of such inestimable value as to demand our constant\r\nand watchful vigilance for its preservation. In this view, let me\r\nimplore my countrymen, North and South, to cultivate the ancient\r\nfeelings of mutual forbearance and good will toward each other and\r\nstrive to allay the demon spirit of sectional hatred and strife now\r\nalive in the land. This advice proceeds from the heart of an old public\r\nfunctionary whose service commenced in the last generation, among the\r\nwise and conservative statesmen of that day, now nearly all passed away,\r\nand whose first and dearest earthly wish is to leave his country\r\ntranquil, prosperous, united, and powerful.\r\n\r\nWe ought to reflect that in this age, and especially in this country,\r\nthere is an incessant flux and reflux of public opinion. Questions which\r\nin their day assumed a most threatening aspect have now nearly gone from\r\nthe memory of men. They are \"volcanoes burnt out, and on the lava and\r\nashes and squalid scoria of old eruptions grow the peaceful olive, the\r\ncheering vine, and the sustaining corn.\" Such, in my opinion, will prove\r\nto be the fate of the present sectional excitement should those who\r\nwisely seek to apply the remedy continue always to confine their efforts\r\nwithin the pale of the Constitution. If this course be pursued, the\r\nexisting agitation on the subject of domestic slavery, like everything\r\nhuman, will have its day and give place to other and less threatening\r\ncontroversies. Public opinion in this country is all-powerful, and when\r\nit reaches a dangerous excess upon any question the good sense of the\r\npeople will furnish the corrective and bring it back within safe limits.\r\nStill, to hasten this auspicious result at the present crisis we ought\r\nto remember that every rational creature must be presumed to intend the\r\nnatural consequences of his own teachings. Those who announce abstract\r\ndoctrines subversive of the Constitution and the Union must not be\r\nsurprised should their heated partisans advance one step further and\r\nattempt by violence to carry these doctrines into practical effect. In\r\nthis view of the subject, it ought never to be forgotten that however\r\ngreat may have been the political advantages resulting from the Union\r\nto every portion of our common country, these would all prove to be as\r\nnothing should the time ever arrive when they can not be enjoyed without\r\nserious danger to the personal safety of the people of fifteen members\r\nof the Confederacy. If the peace of the domestic fireside throughout\r\nthese States should ever be invaded, if the mothers of families within\r\nthis extensive region should not be able to retire to rest at night\r\nwithout suffering dreadful apprehensions of what may be their own fate\r\nand that of their children before the morning, it would be vain to\r\nrecount to such a people the political benefits which result to them\r\nfrom the Union. Self-preservation is the first instinct of nature, and\r\ntherefore any state of society in which the sword is all the time\r\nsuspended over the heads of the people must at last become intolerable.\r\nBut I indulge in no such gloomy forebodings. On the contrary, I firmly\r\nbelieve that the events at Harpers Ferry, by causing the people to pause\r\nand reflect upon the possible peril to their cherished institutions,\r\nwill be the means under Providence of allaying the existing excitement\r\nand preventing further outbreaks of a similar character. They will\r\nresolve that the Constitution and the Union shall not be endangered by\r\nrash counsels, knowing that should \"the silver cord be loosed or the\r\ngolden bowl be broken ... at the fountain\" human power could never\r\nreunite the scattered and hostile fragments.\r\n\r\nI cordially congratulate you upon the final settlement by the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States of the question of slavery in the\r\nTerritories, which had presented an aspect so truly formidable at the\r\ncommencement of my Administration. The right has been established of\r\nevery citizen to take his property of any kind, including slaves,\r\ninto the common Territories belonging equally to all the States of\r\nthe Confederacy, and to have it protected there under the Federal\r\nConstitution. Neither Congress nor a Territorial legislature nor any\r\nhuman power has any authority to annul or impair this vested right.\r\nThe supreme judicial tribunal of the country, which is a coordinate\r\nbranch of the Government, has sanctioned and affirmed these principles\r\nof constitutional law, so manifestly just in themselves and so well\r\ncalculated to promote peace and harmony among the States. It is a\r\nstriking proof of the sense of justice which is inherent in our people\r\nthat the property in slaves has never been disturbed, to my knowledge,\r\nin any of the Territories. Even throughout the late troubles in Kansas\r\nthere has not been any attempt, as I am credibly informed, to interfere\r\nin a single instance with the right of the master. Had any such attempt\r\nbeen made, the judiciary would doubtless have afforded an adequate\r\nremedy. Should they fail to do this hereafter, it will then be time\r\nenough to strengthen their hands by further legislation. Had it been\r\ndecided that either Congress or the Territorial legislature possess the\r\npower to annul or impair the right to property in slaves, the evil would\r\nbe intolerable. In the latter event there would be a struggle for a\r\nmajority of the members of the legislature at each successive election,\r\nand the sacred rights of property held under the Federal Constitution\r\nwould depend for the time being on the result. The agitation would thus\r\nbe rendered incessant whilst the Territorial condition remained, and its\r\nbaneful influence would keep alive a dangerous excitement among the\r\npeople of the several States.\r\n\r\nThus has the status of a Territory during the intermediate period from\r\nits first settlement until it shall become a State been irrevocably\r\nfixed by the final decision of the Supreme Court. Fortunate has this\r\nbeen for the prosperity of the Territories, as well as the tranquillity\r\nof the States. Now emigrants from the North and the South, the East and\r\nthe West, will meet in the Territories on a common platform, having\r\nbrought with them that species of property best adapted, in their own\r\nopinion, to promote their welfare. From natural causes the slavery\r\nquestion will in each case soon virtually settle itself, and before\r\nthe Territory is prepared for admission as a State into the Union this\r\ndecision, one way or the other, will have been a foregone conclusion.\r\nMeanwhile the settlement of the new Territory will proceed without\r\nserious interruption, and its progress and prosperity will not be\r\nendangered or retarded by violent political struggles.\r\n\r\nWhen in the progress of events the inhabitants of any Territory shall\r\nhave reached the number required to form a State, they will then proceed\r\nin a regular manner and in the exercise of the rights of popular\r\nsovereignty to form a constitution preparatory to admission into the\r\nUnion. After this has been done, to employ the language of the Kansas\r\nand Nebraska act, they \"shall be received into the Union with or without\r\nslavery, as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their\r\nadmission.\" This sound principle has happily been recognized in some\r\nform or other by an almost unanimous vote of both Houses of the last\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nAll lawful means at my command have been employed, and shall continue to\r\nbe employed, to execute the laws against the African slave trade. After\r\na most careful and rigorous examination of our coasts and a thorough\r\ninvestigation of the subject, we have not been able to discover that any\r\nslaves have been imported into the United States except the cargo by the\r\n_Wanderer_, numbering between three and four hundred. Those engaged in\r\nthis unlawful enterprise have been rigorously prosecuted, but not with\r\nas much success as their crimes have deserved. A number of them are\r\nstill under prosecution.\r\n\r\nOur history proves that the fathers of the Republic, in advance\r\nof all other nations, condemned the African slave trade. It was,\r\nnotwithstanding, deemed expedient by the framers of the Constitution to\r\ndeprive Congress of the power to prohibit \"the migration or importation\r\nof such persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to\r\nadmit\" \"prior to the year 1808.\" It will be seen that this restriction\r\non the power of Congress was confined to such States only as might think\r\nproper to admit the importation of slaves. It did not extend to other\r\nStates or to the trade carried on abroad. Accordingly, we find that so\r\nearly as the 22d March, 1794, Congress passed an act imposing severe\r\npenalties and punishments upon citizens and residents of the United\r\nStates who should engage in this trade between foreign nations. The\r\nprovisions of this act were extended and enforced by the act of 10th\r\nMay, 1800.\r\n\r\nAgain, the States themselves had a clear right to waive the\r\nconstitutional privilege intended for their benefit, and to prohibit\r\nby their own laws this trade at any time they thought proper previous\r\nto 1808. Several of them exercised this right before that period, and\r\namong them some containing the greatest number of slaves. This gave\r\nto Congress the immediate power to act in regard to all such States,\r\nbecause they themselves had removed the constitutional barrier. Congress\r\naccordingly passed an act on 28th February, 1803, \"to prevent the\r\nimportation of certain persons into certain States where by the laws\r\nthereof their admission is prohibited.\" In this manner the importation\r\nof African slaves into the United States was to a great extent\r\nprohibited some years in advance of 1808.\r\n\r\nAs the year 1808 approached Congress determined not to suffer this trade\r\nto exist even for a single day after they had the power to abolish it.\r\nOn the 2d of March, 1807, they passed an act, to take effect \"from and\r\nafter the 1st day of January, 1808,\" prohibiting the importation of\r\nAfrican slaves into the United States. This was followed by subsequent\r\nacts of a similar character, to which I need not specially refer. Such\r\nwere the principles and such the practice of our ancestors more than\r\nfifty years ago in regard to the African slave trade. It did not occur\r\nto the revered patriots who had been delegates to the Convention, and\r\nafterwards became members of Congress, that in passing these laws they\r\nhad violated the Constitution which they had framed with so much care\r\nand deliberation. They supposed that to prohibit Congress in express\r\nterms from exercising a specified power before an appointed day\r\nnecessarily involved the right to exercise this power after that day\r\nhad arrived.\r\n\r\nIf this were not the case, the framers of the Constitution had expended\r\nmuch labor in vain. Had they imagined that Congress would possess no\r\npower to prohibit the trade either before or after 1808, they would not\r\nhave taken so much care to protect the States against the exercise of\r\nthis power before that period. Nay, more, they would not have attached\r\nsuch vast importance to this provision as to have excluded it from the\r\npossibility of future repeal or amendment, to which other portions\r\nof the Constitution were exposed. It would, then, have been wholly\r\nunnecessary to ingraft on the fifth article of the Constitution,\r\nprescribing the mode of its own future amendment, the proviso \"that no\r\namendment which may be made prior to the year 1808 shall in any manner\r\naffect\" the provision in the Constitution securing to the States the\r\nright to admit the importation of African slaves previous to that\r\nperiod. According to the adverse construction, the clause itself, on\r\nwhich so much care and discussion had been employed by the members of\r\nthe Convention, was an absolute nullity from the beginning, and all\r\nthat has since been done under it a mere usurpation.\r\n\r\nIt was well and wise to confer this power on Congress, because had\r\nit been left to the States its efficient exercise would have been\r\nimpossible. In that event any one State could have effectually continued\r\nthe trade, not only for itself, but for all the other slave States,\r\nthough never so much against their will. And why? Because African\r\nslaves, when once brought within the limits of any one State in\r\naccordance with its laws, can not practically be excluded from any State\r\nwhere slavery exists. And even if all the States had separately passed\r\nlaws prohibiting the importation of slaves, these laws would have failed\r\nof effect for want of a naval force to capture the slavers and to guard\r\nthe coast. Such a force no State can employ in time of peace without the\r\nconsent of Congress.\r\n\r\nThese acts of Congress, it is believed, have, with very rare and\r\ninsignificant exceptions, accomplished their purpose. For a period of\r\nmore than half a century there has been no perceptible addition to the\r\nnumber of our domestic slaves. During this period their advancement in\r\ncivilization has far surpassed that of any other portion of the African\r\nrace. The light and the blessings of Christianity have been extended\r\nto them, and both their moral and physical condition has been greatly\r\nimproved.\r\n\r\nReopen the trade and it would be difficult to determine whether the\r\neffect would be more deleterious on the interests of the master or on\r\nthose of the native-born slave. Of the evils to the master, the one most\r\nto be dreaded would be the introduction of wild, heathen, and ignorant\r\nbarbarians among the sober, orderly, and quiet slaves whose ancestors\r\nhave been on the soil for several generations. This might tend to\r\nbarbarize, demoralize, and exasperate the whole mass and produce most\r\ndeplorable consequences.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the existing slave would, if possible, be still more\r\ndeplorable. At present he is treated with kindness and humanity.\r\nHe is well fed, well clothed, and not overworked. His condition is\r\nincomparably better than that of the coolies which modern nations of\r\nhigh civilization have employed as a substitute for African slaves. Both\r\nthe philanthropy and the self-interest of the master have combined to\r\nproduce this humane result. But let this trade be reopened and what will\r\nbe the effect? The same to a considerable extent as on a neighboring\r\nisland, the only spot now on earth where the African slave trade is\r\nopenly tolerated, and this in defiance of solemn treaties with a power\r\nabundantly able at any moment to enforce their execution. There the\r\nmaster, intent upon present gain, extorts from the slave as much labor\r\nas his physical powers are capable of enduring, knowing that when death\r\ncomes to his relief his place can be supplied at a price reduced to the\r\nlowest point by the competition of rival African slave traders. Should\r\nthis ever be the case in our country, which I do not deem possible, the\r\npresent useful character of the domestic institution, wherein those too\r\nold and too young to work are provided for with care and humanity and\r\nthose capable of labor are not overtasked, would undergo an unfortunate\r\nchange. The feeling of reciprocal dependence and attachment which now\r\nexists between master and slave would be converted into mutual distrust\r\nand hostility.\r\n\r\nBut we are obliged as a Christian and moral nation to consider what\r\nwould be the effect upon unhappy Africa itself if we should reopen the\r\nslave trade. This would give the trade an impulse and extension which\r\nit has never had, even in its palmiest days. The numerous victims\r\nrequired to supply it would convert the whole slave coast into a perfect\r\npandemonium, for which this country would be held responsible in the\r\neyes both of God and man. Its petty tribes would then be constantly\r\nengaged in predatory wars against each other for the purpose of seizing\r\nslaves to supply the American market. All hopes of African civilization\r\nwould thus be ended.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when a market for African slaves shall no longer be\r\nfurnished in Cuba, and thus all the world be closed against this trade,\r\nwe may then indulge a reasonable hope for the gradual improvement of\r\nAfrica. The chief motive of war among the tribes will cease whenever\r\nthere is no longer any demand for slaves. The resources of that fertile\r\nbut miserable country might then be developed by the hand of industry\r\nand afford subjects for legitimate foreign and domestic commerce. In\r\nthis manner Christianity and civilization may gradually penetrate the\r\nexisting gloom.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of the course pursued by this Government toward China has\r\nbeen vindicated by the event. Whilst we sustained a neutral position in\r\nthe war waged by Great Britain and France against the Chinese Empire,\r\nour late minister, in obedience to his instructions, judiciously\r\ncooperated with the ministers of these powers in all peaceful measures\r\nto secure by treaty the just concessions demanded by the interests of\r\nforeign commerce. The result is that satisfactory treaties have been\r\nconcluded with China by the respective ministers of the United States,\r\nGreat Britain, France, and Russia. Our \"treaty, or general convention,\r\nof peace, amity, and commerce\" with that Empire was concluded at\r\nTien-tsin on the 18th June, 1858, and was ratified by the President,\r\nby and with the advice and consent of the Senate, on the 21st December\r\nfollowing. On the 15th December, 1858, John E. Ward, a distinguished\r\ncitizen of Georgia, was duly commissioned as envoy extraordinary and\r\nminister plenipotentiary to China.\r\n\r\nHe left the United States for the place of his destination on the 5th of\r\nFebruary, 1859, bearing with him the ratified copy of this treaty, and\r\narrived at Shanghai on the 28th May. From thence he proceeded to Peking\r\non the 16th June, but did not arrive in that city until the 27th July.\r\nAccording to the terms of the treaty, the ratifications were to be\r\nexchanged on or before the 18th June, 1859. This was rendered impossible\r\nby reasons and events beyond his control, not necessary to detail; but\r\nstill it is due to the Chinese authorities at Shanghai to state that\r\nthey always assured him no advantage should be taken of the delay, and\r\nthis pledge has been faithfully redeemed.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of Mr. Ward at Peking he requested an audience of the\r\nEmperor to present his letter of credence. This he did not obtain, in\r\nconsequence of his very proper refusal to submit to the humiliating\r\nceremonies required by the etiquette of this strange people in\r\napproaching their sovereign. Nevertheless, the interviews on this\r\nquestion were conducted in the most friendly spirit and with all due\r\nregard to his personal feelings and the honor of his country. When a\r\npresentation to His Majesty was found to be impossible, the letter\r\nof credence from the President was received with peculiar honors by\r\nKweiliang, \"the Emperor's prime minister and the second man in the\r\nEmpire to the Emperor himself.\" The ratifications of the treaty were\r\nafterwards, on the 16th of August, exchanged in proper form at\r\nPei-tsang. As the exchange did not take place until after the day\r\nprescribed by the treaty, it is deemed proper before its publication\r\nagain to submit it to the Senate. It is but simple justice to the\r\nChinese authorities to observe that throughout the whole transaction\r\nthey appear to have acted in good faith and in a friendly spirit toward\r\nthe United States. It is true this has been done after their own\r\npeculiar fashion; but we ought to regard with a lenient eye the ancient\r\ncustoms of an empire dating back for thousands of years, so far as this\r\nmay be consistent with our own national honor. The conduct of our\r\nminister on the occasion has received my entire approbation.\r\n\r\nIn order to carry out the spirit of this treaty and to give it full\r\neffect it became necessary to conclude two supplemental conventions, the\r\none for the adjustment and satisfaction of the claims of our citizens\r\nand the other to fix the tariff on imports and exports and to regulate\r\nthe transit duties and trade of our merchants with China. This duty was\r\nsatisfactorily performed by our late minister. These conventions bear\r\ndate at Shanghai on the 8th November, 1858. Having been considered in\r\nthe light of binding agreements subsidiary to the principal treaty, and\r\nto be carried into execution without delay, they do not provide for any\r\nformal ratification or exchange of ratifications by the contracting\r\nparties. This was not deemed necessary by the Chinese, who are already\r\nproceeding in good faith to satisfy the claims of our citizens and, it\r\nis hoped, to carry out the other provisions of the conventions. Still,\r\nI thought it was proper to submit them to the Senate, by which they were\r\nratified on the 3d of March, 1859. The ratified copies, however, did not\r\nreach Shanghai until after the departure of our minister to Peking, and\r\nthese conventions could not, therefore, be exchanged at the same time\r\nwith the principal treaty. No doubt is entertained that they will be\r\nratified and exchanged by the Chinese Government should this be thought\r\nadvisable; but under the circumstances presented I shall consider them\r\nbinding engagements from their date on both parties, and cause them to\r\nbe published as such for the information and guidance of our merchants\r\ntrading with the Chinese Empire.\r\n\r\nIt affords me much satisfaction to inform you that all our difficulties\r\nwith the Republic of Paraguay have been satisfactorily adjusted. It\r\nhappily did not become necessary to employ the force for this purpose\r\nwhich Congress had placed at my command under the joint resolution of\r\n2d June, 1858. On the contrary, the President of that Republic, in a\r\nfriendly spirit, acceded promptly to the just and reasonable demands\r\nof the Government of the United States. Our commissioner arrived at\r\nAssumption, the capital of the Republic, on the 25th of January, 1859,\r\nand left it on the 17th of February, having in three weeks ably and\r\nsuccessfully accomplished all the objects of his mission. The treaties\r\nwhich he has concluded will be immediately submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn the view that the employment of other than peaceful means might\r\nbecome necessary to obtain \"just satisfaction\" from Paraguay, a strong\r\nnaval force was concentrated in the waters of the La Plata to await\r\ncontingencies whilst our commissioner ascended the rivers to Assumption.\r\nThe Navy Department is entitled to great credit for the promptness,\r\nefficiency, and economy with which this expedition was fitted out and\r\nconducted. It consisted of 19 armed vessels, great and small, carrying\r\n200 guns and 2,500 men, all under the command of the veteran and gallant\r\nShubrick. The entire expenses of the expedition have been defrayed out\r\nof the ordinary appropriations for the naval service, except the sum of\r\n$289,000, applied to the purchase of seven of the steamers constituting\r\na part of it, under the authority of the naval appropriation act of the\r\n3d March last. It is believed that these steamers are worth more than\r\ntheir cost, and they are all now usefully and actively employed in the\r\nnaval service.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of so large a force, fitted out in such a prompt manner,\r\nin the far-distant waters of the La Plata, and the admirable conduct of\r\nthe officers and men employed in it, have had a happy effect in favor of\r\nour country throughout all that remote portion of the world.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the great Empires of France and Russia, as well as\r\nwith all other governments on the continent of Europe, unless we may\r\nexcept that of Spain, happily continue to be of the most friendly\r\ncharacter. In my last annual message I presented a statement of the\r\nunsatisfactory condition of our relations with Spain, and I regret\r\nto say that this has not materially improved.\r\n\r\nWithout special reference to other claims, even the \"Cuban claims,\" the\r\npayment of which has been ably urged by our ministers, and in which\r\nmore than a hundred of our citizens are directly interested, remain\r\nunsatisfied, notwithstanding both their justice and their amount\r\n($128,635.54) had been recognized and ascertained by the Spanish\r\nGovernment itself.\r\n\r\nI again recommend that an appropriation be made \"to be paid to\r\nthe Spanish Government for the purpose of distribution among the\r\nclaimants in the _Amistad_ case.\" In common with two of my predecessors,\r\nI entertain no doubt that this is required by our treaty with Spain of\r\nthe 27th October, 1795. The failure to discharge this obligation has\r\nbeen employed by the cabinet of Madrid as a reason against the\r\nsettlement of our claims.\r\n\r\nI need not repeat the arguments which I urged in my last annual message\r\nin favor of the acquisition of Cuba by fair purchase. My opinions on\r\nthat measure remain unchanged. I therefore again invite the serious\r\nattention of Congress to this important subject. Without a recognition\r\nof this policy on their part it will be almost impossible to institute\r\nnegotiations with any reasonable prospect of success.\r\n\r\nUntil a recent period there was good reason to believe that I should be\r\nable to announce to you on the present occasion that our difficulties\r\nwith Great Britain arising out of the Clayton and Bulwer treaty had been\r\nfinally adjusted in a manner alike honorable and satisfactory to both\r\nparties. From causes, however, which the British Government had not\r\nanticipated, they have not yet completed treaty arrangements with the\r\nRepublics of Honduras and Nicaragua, in pursuance of the understanding\r\nbetween the two Governments. It is, nevertheless, confidently expected\r\nthat this good work will ere long be accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhilst indulging the hope that no other subject remained which could\r\ndisturb the good understanding between the two countries, the question\r\narising out of the adverse claims of the parties to the island of San\r\nJuan, under the Oregon treaty of the 15th June, 1846, suddenly assumed\r\na threatening prominence. In order to prevent unfortunate collisions\r\non that remote frontier, the late Secretary of State, on the 17th July,\r\n1855, addressed a note to Mr. Crampton, then British minister at\r\nWashington, communicating to him a copy of the instructions which\r\nhe (Mr. Marcy) had given on the 14th July to Governor Stevens, of\r\nWashington Territory, having a special reference to an \"apprehended\r\nconflict between our citizens and the British subjects on the island\r\nof San Juan.\" To prevent this the governor was instructed \"that the\r\nofficers of the Territory should abstain from all acts on the disputed\r\ngrounds which are calculated to provoke any conflicts, so far as it can\r\nbe done without implying the concession to the authorities of Great\r\nBritain of an exclusive right over the premises. The title ought to be\r\nsettled before either party should attempt to exclude the other by force\r\nor exercise complete and exclusive sovereign rights within the fairly\r\ndisputed limits.\"\r\n\r\nIn acknowledging the receipt on the next day of Mr. Marcy's note the\r\nBritish minister expressed his entire concurrence \"in the propriety\r\nof the course recommended to the governor of Washington Territory\r\nby your [Mr. Marcy's] instructions to that officer,\" and stating\r\nthat he had \"lost no time in transmitting a copy of that document\r\nto the Governor-General of British North America\" and had \"earnestly\r\nrecommended to His Excellency to take such measures as to him may appear\r\nbest calculated to secure on the part of the British local authorities\r\nand the inhabitants of the neighborhood of the line in question the\r\nexercise of the same spirit of forbearance which is inculcated by you\r\n[Mr. Marcy] on the authorities and citizens of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThus matters remained upon the faith of this arrangement until the 9th\r\nJuly last, when General Harney paid a visit to the island. He found upon\r\nit twenty-five American residents with their families, and also an\r\nestablishment of the Hudsons Bay Company for the purpose of raising\r\nsheep. A short time before his arrival one of these residents had shot\r\nan animal belonging to the company whilst trespassing upon his premises,\r\nfor which, however, he offered to pay twice its value, but that was\r\nrefused. Soon after \"the chief factor of the company at Victoria, Mr.\r\nDalles, son-in-law of Governor Douglas, came to the island in the\r\nBritish sloop of war _Satellite_ and threatened to take this American\r\n[Mr. Cutler] by force to Victoria to answer for the trespass he had\r\ncommitted. The American seized his rifle and told Mr. Dalles if any\r\nsuch attempt was made he would kill him upon the spot. The affair\r\nthen ended.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the American settlers presented a petition to\r\nthe General \"through the United States inspector of customs, Mr. Hubbs,\r\nto place a force upon the island to protect them from the Indians, as\r\nwell as the oppressive interference of the authorities of the Hudsons\r\nBay Company at Victoria with their rights as American citizens.\" The\r\nGeneral immediately responded to this petition, and ordered Captain\r\nGeorge E. Pickett, Ninth Infantry, \"to establish his company on\r\nBellevue, or San Juan Island, on some suitable position near the harbor\r\nat the southeastern extremity.\" This order was promptly obeyed and a\r\nmilitary post was established at the place designated. The force was\r\nafterwards increased, so that by the last return the whole number of\r\ntroops then on the island amounted in the aggregate to 691 men.\r\n\r\nWhilst I do not deem it proper on the present occasion to go further\r\ninto the subject and discuss the weight which ought to be attached to\r\nthe statements of the British colonial authorities contesting the\r\naccuracy of the information on which the gallant General acted, it was\r\ndue to him that I should thus present his own reasons for issuing the\r\norder to Captain Pickett. From these it is quite clear his object was\r\nto prevent the British authorities on Vancouvers Island from exercising\r\njurisdiction over American residents on the island of San Juan, as\r\nwell as to protect them against the incursions of the Indians. Much\r\nexcitement prevailed for some time throughout that region, and serious\r\ndanger of collision between the parties was apprehended. The British\r\nhad a large naval force in the vicinity, and it is but an act of simple\r\njustice to the admiral on that station to state that he wisely and\r\ndiscreetly forbore to commit any hostile act, but determined to refer\r\nthe whole affair to his Government and await their instructions.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the matter, in my opinion, demanded serious attention.\r\nIt would have been a great calamity for both nations had they been\r\nprecipitated into acts of hostility, not on the question of title to\r\nthe island, but merely concerning what should be its condition during\r\nthe intervening period whilst the two Governments might be employed\r\nin settling the question to which of them it belongs. For this reason\r\nLieutenant-General Scott was dispatched, on the 17th of September last,\r\nto Washington Territory to take immediate command of the United States\r\nforces on the Pacific Coast, should he deem this necessary. The main\r\nobject of his mission was to carry out the spirit of the precautionary\r\narrangement between the late Secretary of State and the British\r\nminister, and thus to preserve the peace and prevent collision between\r\nthe British and American authorities pending the negotiations between\r\nthe two Governments. Entertaining no doubt of the validity of our title,\r\nI need scarcely add that in any event American citizens were to be\r\nplaced on a footing at least as favorable as that of British subjects,\r\nit being understood that Captain Pickett's company should remain on the\r\nisland. It is proper to observe that, considering the distance from the\r\nscene of action and in ignorance of what might have transpired on the\r\nspot before the General's arrival, it was necessary to leave much to\r\nhis discretion; and I am happy to state the event has proven that\r\nthis discretion could not have been intrusted to more competent\r\nhands. General Scott has recently returned from his mission, having\r\nsuccessfully accomplished its objects, and there is no longer any good\r\nreason to apprehend a collision between the forces of the two countries\r\nduring the pendency of the existing negotiations.\r\n\r\nI regret to inform you that there has been no improvement in the affairs\r\nof Mexico since my last annual message, and I am again obliged to ask\r\nthe earnest attention of Congress to the unhappy condition of that\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThe constituent Congress of Mexico, which adjourned on the 17th\r\nFebruary, 1857, adopted a constitution and provided for a popular\r\nelection. This took place in the following July (1857), and General\r\nComonfort was chosen President almost without opposition. At the same\r\nelection a new Congress was chosen, whose first session commenced on the\r\n16th of September (1857). By the constitution of 1857 the Presidential\r\nterm was to begin on the 1st of December (1857) and continue for four\r\nyears. On that day General Comonfort appeared before the assembled\r\nCongress in the City of Mexico, took the oath to support the new\r\nconstitution, and was duly inaugurated as President. Within a month\r\nafterwards he had been driven from the capital and a military rebellion\r\nhad assigned the supreme power of the Republic to General Zuloaga. The\r\nconstitution provided that in the absence of the President his office\r\nshould devolve upon the chief justice of the supreme court; and General\r\nComonfort having left the country, this functionary, General Juarez,\r\nproceeded to form at Guanajuato a constitutional Government. Before this\r\nwas officially known, however, at the capital the Government of Zuloaga\r\nhad been recognized by the entire diplomatic corps, including the\r\nminister of the United States, as the _de facto_ Government of Mexico.\r\nThe constitutional President, nevertheless, maintained his position with\r\nfirmness, and was soon established, with his cabinet, at Vera Cruz.\r\nMeanwhile the Government of Zuloaga was earnestly resisted in many parts\r\nof the Republic, and even in the capital, a portion of the army having\r\npronounced against it, its functions were declared terminated, and an\r\nassembly of citizens was invited for the choice of a new President. This\r\nassembly elected General Miramon, but that officer repudiated the plan\r\nunder which he was chosen, and Zuloaga was thus restored to his previous\r\nposition. He assumed it, however, only to withdraw from it; and Miramon,\r\nhaving become by his appointment \"President substitute,\" continues with\r\nthat title at the head of the insurgent party.\r\n\r\nIn my last annual message I communicated to Congress the circumstances\r\nunder which the late minister of the United States suspended his\r\nofficial relations with the central Government and withdrew from the\r\ncountry. It was impossible to maintain friendly intercourse with a\r\ngovernment like that at the capital, under whose usurped authority\r\nwrongs were constantly committed, but never redressed. Had this been an\r\nestablished government, with its power extending by the consent of the\r\npeople over the whole of Mexico, a resort to hostilities against it\r\nwould have been quite justifiable, and, indeed, necessary. But the\r\ncountry was a prey to civil war, and it was hoped that the success of\r\nthe constitutional President might lead to a condition of things less\r\ninjurious to the United States. This success became so probable that in\r\nJanuary last I employed a reliable agent to visit Mexico and report to\r\nme the actual condition and prospects of the contending parties. In\r\nconsequence of his report and from information which reached me from\r\nother sources favorable to the prospects of the constitutional cause,\r\nI felt justified in appointing a new minister to Mexico, who might\r\nembrace the earliest suitable opportunity of restoring our diplomatic\r\nrelations with that Republic. For this purpose a distinguished citizen\r\nof Maryland was selected, who proceeded on his mission on the 8th of\r\nMarch last, with discretionary authority to recognize the Government of\r\nPresident Juarez if on his arrival in Mexico he should find it entitled\r\nto such recognition according to the established practice of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of April following Mr. McLane presented his credentials to\r\nPresident Juarez, having no hesitation \"in pronouncing the Government\r\nof Juarez to be the only existing government of the Republic.\" He was\r\ncordially received by the authorities at Vera Cruz, and they have ever\r\nsince manifested the most friendly disposition toward the United States.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, however, the constitutional Government has not been able to\r\nestablish its power over the whole Republic.\r\n\r\nIt is supported by a large majority of the people and the States,\r\nbut there are important parts of the country where it can enforce\r\nno obedience.\r\n\r\nGeneral Miramon maintains himself at the capital, and in some of the\r\ndistant Provinces there are military governors who pay little respect\r\nto the decrees of either Government. In the meantime the excesses which\r\nalways attend upon civil war, especially in Mexico, are constantly\r\nrecurring. Outrages of the worst description are committed both upon\r\npersons and property. There is scarcely any form of injury which has\r\nnot been suffered by our citizens in Mexico during the last few years.\r\nWe have been nominally at peace with that Republic, but \"so far as the\r\ninterests of our commerce, or of our citizens who have visited the\r\ncountry as merchants, shipmasters, or in other capacities, are\r\nconcerned, we might as well have been at war.\" Life has been insecure,\r\nproperty unprotected, and trade impossible except at a risk of loss\r\nwhich prudent men can not be expected to incur. Important contracts,\r\ninvolving large expenditures, entered into by the central Government,\r\nhave been set at defiance by the local governments. Peaceful American\r\nresidents, occupying their rightful possessions, have been suddenly\r\nexpelled the country, in defiance of treaties and by the mere force of\r\narbitrary power. Even the course of justice has not been safe from\r\ncontrol, and a recent decree of Miramon permits the intervention of\r\nGovernment in all suits where either party is a foreigner. Vessels of\r\nthe United States have been seized without law, and a consular officer\r\nwho protested against such seizure has been fined and imprisoned for\r\ndisrespect to the authorities. Military contributions have been levied\r\nin violation of every principle of right, and the American who resisted\r\nthe lawless demand has had his property forcibly taken away and has been\r\nhimself banished. From a conflict of authority in different parts of\r\nthe country tariff duties which have been paid in one place have been\r\nexacted over again in another place. Large numbers of our citizens have\r\nbeen arrested and imprisoned without any form of examination or any\r\nopportunity for a hearing, and even when released have only obtained\r\ntheir liberty after much suffering and injury, and without any hope of\r\nredress. The wholesale massacre of Crabbe and his associates without\r\ntrial in Sonora, as well as the seizure and murder of four sick\r\nAmericans who had taken shelter in the house of an American upon the\r\nsoil of the United States, was communicated to Congress at its last\r\nsession. Murders of a still more atrocious character have been\r\ncommitted in the very heart of Mexico, under the authority of Miramon's\r\nGovernment, during the present year. Some of these were only worthy\r\nof a barbarous age, and if they had not been clearly proven would have\r\nseemed impossible in a country which claims to be civilized. Of this\r\ndescription was the brutal massacre in April last, by order of General\r\nMarquez, of three American physicians who were seized in the hospital at\r\nTacubaya while attending upon the sick and the dying of both parties,\r\nand without trial, as without crime, were hurried away to speedy\r\nexecution. Little less shocking was the recent fate of Ormond Chase,\r\nwho was shot in Tepic on the 7th of August by order of the same Mexican\r\ngeneral, not only without a trial, but without any conjecture by his\r\nfriends of the cause of his arrest. He is represented as a young man of\r\ngood character and intelligence, who had made numerous friends in Tepic\r\nby the courage and humanity which he had displayed on several trying\r\noccasions; and his death was as unexpected as it was shocking to the\r\nwhole community. Other outrages might be enumerated, but these are\r\nsufficient to illustrate the wretched state of the country and the\r\nunprotected condition of the persons and property of our citizens\r\nin Mexico.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases our ministers have been constant and faithful in\r\ntheir demands for redress, but both they and this Government, which they\r\nhave successively represented, have been wholly powerless to make their\r\ndemands effective. Their testimony in this respect and in reference to\r\nthe only remedy which in their judgments would meet the exigency has\r\nbeen both uniform and emphatic. \"Nothing but a manifestation of the\r\npower of the Government of the United States,\" wrote our late minister\r\nin 1856, \"and of its purpose to punish these wrongs will avail. I assure\r\nyou that the universal belief here is that there is nothing to be\r\napprehended from the Government of the United States, and that local\r\nMexican officials can commit these outrages upon American citizens with\r\nabsolute impunity.\" \"I hope the President,\" wrote our present minister\r\nin August last, \"will feel authorized to ask from Congress the power to\r\nenter Mexico with the military forces of the United States at the call\r\nof the constitutional authorities, in order to protect the citizens\r\nand the treaty rights of the United States. Unless such a power is\r\nconferred upon him, neither the one nor the other will be respected in\r\nthe existing state of anarchy and disorder, and the outrages already\r\nperpetrated will never be chastised; and, as I assured you in my No. 23,\r\nall these evils must increase until every vestige of order and\r\ngovernment disappears from the country.\" I have been reluctantly led\r\nto the same opinion, and in justice to my countrymen who have suffered\r\nwrongs from Mexico and who may still suffer them I feel bound to\r\nannounce this conclusion to Congress.\r\n\r\nThe case presented, however, is not merely a case of individual claims,\r\nalthough our just claims against Mexico have reached a very large\r\namount; nor is it merely the case of protection to the lives and\r\nproperty of the few Americans who may still remain in Mexico, although\r\nthe life and property of every American citizen ought to be sacredly\r\nprotected in every quarter of the world; but it is a question which\r\nrelates to the future as well as to the present and the past, and which\r\ninvolves, indirectly at least, the whole subject of our duty to Mexico\r\nas a neighboring State. The exercise of the power of the United States\r\nin that country to redress the wrongs and protect the rights of our own\r\ncitizens is none the less to be desired because efficient and necessary\r\naid may thus be rendered at the same time to restore peace and order to\r\nMexico itself. In the accomplishment of this result the people of the\r\nUnited States must necessarily feel a deep and earnest interest. Mexico\r\nought to be a rich and prosperous and powerful Republic. She possesses\r\nan extensive territory, a fertile soil, and an incalculable store of\r\nmineral wealth. She occupies an important position between the Gulf and\r\nthe ocean for transit routes and for commerce. Is it possible that such\r\na country as this can be given up to anarchy and ruin without an effort\r\nfrom any quarter for its rescue and its safety? Will the commercial\r\nnations of the world, which have so many interests connected with\r\nit, remain wholly indifferent to such a result? Can the United States\r\nespecially, which ought to share most largely in its commercial\r\nintercourse, allow their immediate neighbor thus to destroy itself and\r\ninjure them? Yet without support from some quarter it is impossible to\r\nperceive how Mexico can resume her position among nations and enter upon\r\na career which promises any good results. The aid which she requires,\r\nand which the interests of all commercial countries require that she\r\nshould have, it belongs to this Government to render, not only by\r\nvirtue of our neighborhood to Mexico, along whose territory we have a\r\ncontinuous frontier of nearly a thousand miles, but by virtue also of\r\nour established policy, which is inconsistent with the intervention\r\nof any European power in the domestic concerns of that Republic.\r\n\r\nThe wrongs which we have suffered from Mexico are before the world and\r\nmust deeply impress every American citizen. A government which is either\r\nunable or unwilling to redress such wrongs is derelict to its highest\r\nduties. The difficulty consists in selecting and enforcing the remedy.\r\nWe may in vain apply to the constitutional Government at Vera Cruz,\r\nalthough it is well disposed to do us justice, for adequate redress.\r\nWhilst its authority is acknowledged in all the important ports and\r\nthroughout the seacoasts of the Republic, its power does not extend to\r\nthe City of Mexico and the States in its vicinity, where nearly all\r\nthe recent outrages have been committed on American citizens. We must\r\npenetrate into the interior before we can reach the offenders, and this\r\ncan only be done by passing through the territory in the occupation of\r\nthe constitutional Government. The most acceptable and least difficult\r\nmode of accomplishing the object will be to act in concert with that\r\nGovernment. Their consent and their aid might, I believe, be obtained;\r\nbut if not, our obligation to protect our own citizens in their just\r\nrights secured by treaty would not be the less imperative. For these\r\nreasons I recommend to Congress to pass a law authorizing the President,\r\nunder such conditions as they may deem expedient, to employ a sufficient\r\nmilitary force to enter Mexico for the purpose of obtaining indemnity\r\nfor the past and security for the future. I purposely refrain from any\r\nsuggestion as to whether this force shall consist of regular troops or\r\nvolunteers, or both. This question may be most appropriately left to the\r\ndecision of Congress. I would merely observe that should volunteers be\r\nselected such a force could be easily raised in this country among those\r\nwho sympathize with the sufferings of our unfortunate fellow-citizens\r\nin Mexico and with the unhappy condition of that Republic. Such an\r\naccession to the forces of the constitutional Government would enable\r\nit soon to reach the City of Mexico and extend its power over the whole\r\nRepublic. In that event there is no reason to doubt that the just claims\r\nof our citizens would be satisfied and adequate redress obtained for the\r\ninjuries inflicted upon them. The constitutional Government have ever\r\nevinced a strong desire to do justice, and this might be secured in\r\nadvance by a preliminary treaty.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that these measures will, at least indirectly, be\r\ninconsistent with our wise and settled policy not to interfere in the\r\ndomestic concerns of foreign nations. But does not the present case\r\nfairly constitute an exception? An adjoining Republic is in a state\r\nof anarchy and confusion from which she has proved wholly unable to\r\nextricate herself. She is entirely destitute of the power to maintain\r\npeace upon her borders or to prevent the incursions of banditti into our\r\nterritory. In her fate and in her fortune, in her power to establish and\r\nmaintain a settled government, we have a far deeper interest, socially,\r\ncommercially, and politically, than any other nation. She is now a wreck\r\nupon the ocean, drifting about as she is impelled by different factions.\r\nAs a good neighbor, shall we not extend to her a helping hand to save\r\nher? If we do not, it would not be surprising should some other nation\r\nundertake the task, and thus force us to interfere at last, under\r\ncircumstances of increased difficulty, for the maintenance of our\r\nestablished policy.\r\n\r\nI repeat the recommendation contained in my last annual message that\r\nauthority may be given to the President to establish one or more\r\ntemporary military posts across the Mexican line in Sonora and\r\nChihuahua, where these may be necessary to protect the lives and\r\nproperty of American and Mexican citizens against the incursions and\r\ndepredations of the Indians, as well as of lawless rovers, on that\r\nremote region. The establishment of one such post at a point called\r\nArispe, in Sonora, in a country now almost depopulated by the hostile\r\ninroads of the Indians from our side of the line, would, it is believed,\r\nhave prevented much injury and many cruelties during the past season.\r\nA state of lawlessness and violence prevails on that distant frontier.\r\nLife and property are there wholly insecure. The population of Arizona,\r\nnow numbering more than 10,000 souls, are practically destitute of\r\ngovernment, of laws, or of any regular administration of justice.\r\nMurder, rapine, and other crimes are committed with impunity. I\r\ntherefore again call the attention of Congress to the necessity for\r\nestablishing a Territorial government over Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with Nicaragua of the 16th of February, 1857, to which I\r\nreferred in my last annual message, failed to receive the ratification\r\nof the Government of that Republic, for reasons which I need not\r\nenumerate. A similar treaty has been since concluded between the\r\nparties, bearing date on the 16th March, 1859, which has already been\r\nratified by the Nicaraguan Congress. This will be immediately submitted\r\nto the Senate for their ratification. Its provisions can not, I think,\r\nfail to be acceptable to the people of both countries.\r\n\r\nOur claims against the Governments of Costa Rica and Nicaragua remain\r\nunredressed, though they are pressed in an earnest manner and not\r\nwithout hope of success.\r\n\r\nI deem it to be my duty once more earnestly to recommend to Congress\r\nthe passage of a law authorizing the President to employ the naval\r\nforce at his command for the purpose of protecting the lives and\r\nproperty of American citizens passing in transit across the Panama,\r\nNicaragua, and Tehuantepec routes against sudden and lawless outbreaks\r\nand depredations. I shall not repeat the arguments employed in former\r\nmessages in support of this measure. Suffice it to say that the lives of\r\nmany of our people and the security of vast amounts of treasure passing\r\nand repassing over one or more of these routes between the Atlantic and\r\nPacific may be deeply involved in the action of Congress on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nI would also again recommend to Congress that authority be given to\r\nthe President to employ the naval force to protect American merchant\r\nvessels, their crews and cargoes, against violent and lawless seizure\r\nand confiscation in the ports of Mexico and the Spanish American States\r\nwhen these countries may be in a disturbed and revolutionary condition.\r\nThe mere knowledge that such an authority had been conferred, as I have\r\nalready stated, would of itself in a great degree prevent the evil.\r\nNeither would this require any additional appropriation for the naval\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection urged against the grant of this authority is that\r\nCongress by conferring it would violate the Constitution; that it\r\nwould be a transfer of the war-making, or, strictly speaking, the\r\nwar-declaring, power to the Executive. If this were well founded, it\r\nwould, of course, be conclusive. A very brief examination, however,\r\nwill place this objection at rest.\r\n\r\nCongress possess the sole and exclusive power under the Constitution \"to\r\ndeclare war.\" They alone can \"raise and support armies\" and \"provide\r\nand maintain a navy.\" But after Congress shall have declared war and\r\nprovided the force necessary to carry it on the President, as Commander\r\nin Chief of the Army and Navy, can alone employ this force in making war\r\nagainst the enemy. This is the plain language, and history proves that\r\nit was the well-known intention of the framers, of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt will not be denied that the general \"power to declare war\" is without\r\nlimitation and embraces within itself not only what writers on the law\r\nof nations term a public or perfect war, but also an imperfect war,\r\nand, in short, every species of hostility, however confined or limited.\r\nWithout the authority of Congress the President can not fire a hostile\r\ngun in any case except to repel the attacks of an enemy. It will not be\r\ndoubted that under this power Congress could, if they thought proper,\r\nauthorize the President to employ the force at his command to seize a\r\nvessel belonging to an American citizen which had been illegally and\r\nunjustly captured in a foreign port and restore it to its owner. But can\r\nCongress only act after the fact, after the mischief has been done? Have\r\nthey no power to confer upon the President the authority in advance to\r\nfurnish instant redress should such a case afterwards occur? Must they\r\nwait until the mischief has been done, and can they apply the remedy\r\nonly when it is too late? To confer this authority to meet future\r\ncases under circumstances strictly specified is as clearly within the\r\nwar-declaring power as such an authority conferred upon the President by\r\nact of Congress after the deed had been done. In the progress of a great\r\nnation many exigencies must arise imperatively requiring that Congress\r\nshould authorize the President to act promptly on certain conditions\r\nwhich may or may not afterwards arise. Our history has already presented\r\na number of such cases. I shall refer only to the latest.\r\n\r\nUnder the resolution of June 2, 1858, \"for the adjustment of\r\ndifficulties with the Republic of Paraguay,\" the President is\r\n\"authorized to adopt such measures and use such force as in his\r\njudgment may be necessary and advisable in the event of a refusal of\r\njust satisfaction by the Government of Paraguay.\" \"Just satisfaction\"\r\nfor what? For \"the attack on the United States steamer _Water Witch_\"\r\nand \"other matters referred to in the annual message of the President.\"\r\nHere the power is expressly granted upon the condition that the\r\nGovernment of Paraguay shall refuse to render this \"just satisfaction.\"\r\nIn this and other similar cases Congress have conferred upon the\r\nPresident power in advance to employ the Army and Navy upon the\r\nhappening of contingent future events; and this most certainly is\r\nembraced within the power to declare war.\r\n\r\nNow, if this conditional and contingent power could be constitutionally\r\nconferred upon the President in the case of Paraguay, why may it not be\r\nconferred for the purpose of protecting the lives and property of\r\nAmerican citizens in the event that they may be violently and unlawfully\r\nattacked in passing over the transit routes to and from California or\r\nassailed by the seizure of their vessels in a foreign port? To deny this\r\npower is to render the Navy in a great degree useless for the protection\r\nof the lives and property of American citizens in countries where\r\nneither protection nor redress can be otherwise obtained.\r\n\r\nThe Thirty-fifth Congress terminated on the 3d of March, 1859, without\r\nhaving passed the \"act making appropriations for the service of the\r\nPost-Office Department during the fiscal year ending the 30th of June,\r\n1860.\" This act also contained an appropriation \"to supply deficiencies\r\nin the revenue of the Post-Office Department for the year ending 30th\r\nJune, 1859.\" I believe this is the first instance since the origin of\r\nthe Federal Government, now more than seventy years ago, when any\r\nCongress went out of existence without having passed all the general\r\nappropriation bills necessary to carry on the Government until the\r\nregular period for the meeting of a new Congress. This event imposed on\r\nthe Executive a grave responsibility. It presented a choice of evils.\r\n\r\nHad this omission of duty occurred at the first session of the last\r\nCongress, the remedy would have been plain. I might then have instantly\r\nrecalled them to complete their work, and this without expense to the\r\nGovernment. But on the 4th of March last there were fifteen of the\r\nthirty-three States which had not elected any Representatives to the\r\npresent Congress. Had Congress been called together immediately, these\r\nStates would have been virtually disfranchised. If an intermediate\r\nperiod had been selected, several of the States would have been\r\ncompelled to hold extra sessions of their legislatures, at great\r\ninconvenience and expense, to provide for elections at an earlier day\r\nthan that previously fixed by law. In the regular course ten of these\r\nStates would not elect until after the beginning of August, and five\r\nof these ten not until October and November.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when I came to examine carefully the condition of the\r\nPost-Office Department, I did not meet as many or as great difficulties\r\nas I had apprehended. Had the bill which failed been confined to\r\nappropriations for the fiscal year ending on the 30th June next, there\r\nwould have been no reason of pressing importance for the call of an\r\nextra session. Nothing would become due on contracts (those with\r\nrailroad companies only excepted) for carrying the mail for the first\r\nquarter of the present fiscal year, commencing on the 1st of July, until\r\nthe 1st of December--less than one week before the meeting of the\r\npresent Congress. The reason is that the mail contractors for this and\r\nthe current year did not complete their first quarter's service until\r\nthe 30th September last, and by the terms of their contracts sixty\r\ndays more are allowed for the settlement of their accounts before the\r\nDepartment could be called upon for payment.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty and the great hardship consisted in the failure\r\nto provide for the payment of the deficiency in the fiscal year ending\r\nthe 30th June, 1859. The Department had entered into contracts, in\r\nobedience to existing laws, for the service of that fiscal year, and\r\nthe contractors were fairly entitled to their compensation as it became\r\ndue. The deficiency as stated in the bill amounted to $3,838,728, but\r\nafter a careful settlement of all these accounts it has been ascertained\r\nthat it amounts to $4,296,009. With the scanty means at his command the\r\nPostmaster-General has managed to pay that portion of this deficiency\r\nwhich occurred in the first two quarters of the past fiscal year, ending\r\non the 31st December last. In the meantime the contractors themselves,\r\nunder these trying circumstances, have behaved in a manner worthy\r\nof all commendation. They had one resource in the midst of their\r\nembarrassments. After the amount due to each of them had been\r\nascertained and finally settled according to law, this became a specific\r\ndebt of record against the United States, which enabled them to borrow\r\nmoney on this unquestionable security. Still, they were obliged to\r\npay interest in consequence of the default of Congress, and on every\r\nprinciple of justice ought to receive interest from the Government.\r\nThis interest should commence from the date when a warrant would have\r\nissued for the payment of the principal had an appropriation been made\r\nfor this purpose. Calculated up to the 1st December, it will not exceed\r\n$96,660--a sum not to be taken into account when contrasted with the\r\ngreat difficulties and embarrassments of a public and private character,\r\nboth to the people and the States, which would have resulted from\r\nconvening and holding a special session of Congress.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons I recommend the passage of a bill at as early a day\r\nas may be practicable to provide for the payment of the amount, with\r\ninterest, due to these last-mentioned contractors, as well as to make\r\nthe necessary appropriations for the service of the Post-Office\r\nDepartment for the current fiscal year.\r\n\r\nThe failure to pass the Post-Office bill necessarily gives birth\r\nto serious reflections. Congress, by refusing to pass the general\r\nappropriation bills necessary to carry on the Government, may not only\r\narrest its action, but might even destroy its existence. The Army, the\r\nNavy, the judiciary, in short, every department of the Government,\r\ncan no longer perform their functions if Congress refuse the money\r\nnecessary for their support. If this failure should teach the country\r\nthe necessity of electing a full Congress in sufficient time to enable\r\nthe President to convene them in any emergency, even immediately after\r\nthe old Congress has expired, it will have been productive of great\r\ngood. In a time of sudden and alarming danger, foreign or domestic,\r\nwhich all nations must expect to encounter in their progress, the very\r\nsalvation of our institutions may be staked upon the assembling of\r\nCongress without delay. If under such circumstances the President should\r\nfind himself in the condition in which he was placed at the close of the\r\nlast Congress, with nearly half the States of the Union destitute of\r\nrepresentatives, the consequences might be disastrous. I therefore\r\nrecommend to Congress to carry into effect the provisions of the\r\nConstitution on this subject, and to pass a law appointing some day\r\nprevious to the 4th March in each year of odd number for the election\r\nof Representatives throughout all the States. They have already\r\nappointed a day for the election of electors for President and\r\nVice-President, and this measure has been approved by the country.\r\n\r\nI would again express a most decided opinion in favor of the\r\nconstruction of a Pacific railroad, for the reasons stated in my two\r\nlast annual messages. When I reflect upon what would be the defenseless\r\ncondition of our States and Territories west of the Rocky Mountains in\r\ncase of a war with a naval power sufficiently strong to interrupt all\r\nintercourse with them by the routes across the Isthmus, I am still more\r\nconvinced than ever of the vast importance of this railroad. I have\r\nnever doubted the constitutional competency of Congress to provide for\r\nits construction, but this exclusively under the war-making power.\r\nBesides, the Constitution expressly requires as an imperative duty that\r\n\"the United States shall protect each of them [the States] against\r\ninvasion.\" I am at a loss to conceive how this protection can be\r\nafforded to California and Oregon against such a naval power by any\r\nother means. I repeat the opinion contained in my last annual message\r\nthat it would be inexpedient for the Government to undertake this great\r\nwork by agents of its own appointment and under its direct and exclusive\r\ncontrol. This would increase the patronage of the Executive to a\r\ndangerous extent and would foster a system of jobbing and corruption\r\nwhich no vigilance on the part of Federal officials could prevent.\r\nThe construction of this road ought, therefore, to be intrusted to\r\nincorporated companies or other agencies who would exercise that\r\nactive and vigilant supervision over it which can be inspired alone by\r\na sense of corporate and individual interest. I venture to assert that\r\nthe additional cost of transporting troops, munitions of war, and\r\nnecessary supplies for the Army across the vast intervening plains to\r\nour possessions on the Pacific Coast would be greater in such a war\r\nthan the whole amount required to construct the road. And yet this\r\nresort would after all be inadequate for their defense and protection.\r\n\r\nWe have yet scarcely recovered from the habits of extravagant\r\nexpenditure produced by our overflowing Treasury during several years\r\nprior to the commencement of my Administration. The financial reverses\r\nwhich we have since experienced ought to teach us all to scrutinize\r\nour expenditures with the greatest vigilance and to reduce them to the\r\nlowest possible point. The Executive Departments of the Government\r\nhave devoted themselves to the accomplishment of this object with\r\nconsiderable success, as will appear from their different reports and\r\nestimates. To these I invite the scrutiny of Congress, for the purpose\r\nof reducing them still lower, if this be practicable consistent with\r\nthe great public interests of the country. In aid of the policy of\r\nretrenchment, I pledge myself to examine closely the bills appropriating\r\nlands or money, so that if any of these should inadvertently pass both\r\nHouses, as must sometimes be the case, I may afford them an opportunity\r\nfor reconsideration. At the same time, we ought never to forget that\r\ntrue public economy consists not in withholding the means necessary\r\nto accomplish important national objects confided to us by the\r\nConstitution, but in taking care that the money appropriated for these\r\npurposes shall be faithfully and frugally expended.\r\n\r\nIt will appear from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury that it\r\nis extremely doubtful, to say the least, whether we shall be able to\r\npass through the present and the next fiscal year without providing\r\nadditional revenue. This can only be accomplished by strictly confining\r\nthe appropriations within the estimates of the different Departments,\r\nwithout making an allowance for any additional expenditures which\r\nCongress may think proper, in their discretion, to authorize, and\r\nwithout providing for the redemption of any portion of the $20,000,000\r\nof Treasury notes which have been already issued. In the event of a\r\ndeficiency, which I consider probable, this ought never to be supplied\r\nby a resort to additional loans. It would be a ruinous practice in the\r\ndays of peace and prosperity to go on increasing the national debt to\r\nmeet the ordinary expenses of the Government. This policy would cripple\r\nour resources and impair our credit in case the existence of war should\r\nrender it necessary to borrow money. Should such a deficiency occur as\r\nI apprehend, I would recommend that the necessary revenue be raised by\r\nan increase of our present duties on imports. I need not repeat the\r\nopinions expressed in my last annual message as to the best mode and\r\nmanner of accomplishing this object, and shall now merely observe that\r\nthese have since undergone no change.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Secretary of the Treasury will explain in detail the\r\noperations of that Department of the Government.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury from all sources during the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1859, including the loan authorized by the act of June\r\n14, 1858, and the issues of Treasury notes authorized by existing laws,\r\nwere $81,692,471.01, which sum, with the balance of $6,398,316.10\r\nremaining in the Treasury at the commencement of that fiscal year, made\r\nan aggregate for the service of the year of $88,090,787.11.\r\n\r\nThe public expenditures during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1859,\r\namounted to $83,751,511.57. Of this sum $17,405,285.44 were applied to\r\nthe payment of interest on the public debt and the redemption of the\r\nissues of Treasury notes. The expenditures for all other branches of the\r\npublic service during that fiscal year were therefore $66,346,226.13.\r\n\r\nThe balance remaining in the Treasury on the 1st July, 1859, being the\r\ncommencement of the present fiscal year, was $4,339,275.54.\r\n\r\nThe receipts into the Treasury during the first quarter of the present\r\nfiscal year, commencing July 1, 1859, were $20,618,865.85. Of this\r\namount $3,821,300 was received on account of the loan and the issue of\r\nTreasury notes, the amount of $16,797,565.85 having been received during\r\nthe quarter from the ordinary sources of public revenue. The estimated\r\nreceipts for the remaining three quarters of the present fiscal year,\r\nto June 30, 1860, are $50,426,400. Of this amount it is estimated that\r\n$5,756,400 will be received for Treasury notes which may be reissued\r\nunder the fifth section of the act of 3d March last, and $1,170,000 on\r\naccount of the loan authorized by the act of June 14, 1858, making\r\n$6,926,400 from these extraordinary sources, and $43,500,000 from the\r\nordinary sources of the public revenue, making an aggregate, with the\r\nbalance in the Treasury on the 1st July, 1859, of $75,384,541.89 for\r\nthe estimated means of the present fiscal year, ending June 30, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures during the first quarter of the present fiscal year\r\nwere $20,007,174.76. Four million six hundred and sixty-four thousand\r\nthree hundred and sixty-six dollars and seventy-six cents of this sum\r\nwere applied to the payment of interest on the public debt and the\r\nredemption of the issues of Treasury notes, and the remainder, being\r\n$15,342,808, were applied to ordinary expenditures during the quarter.\r\nThe estimated expenditures during the remaining three quarters, to June\r\n30, 1860, are $40,995,558.23, of which sum $2,886,621.34 are estimated\r\nfor the interest on the public debt. The ascertained and estimated\r\nexpenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1860, on account of\r\nthe public debt are accordingly $7,550,988.10, and for the ordinary\r\nexpenditures of the Government $53,451,744.89, making an aggregate of\r\n$61,-002,732.99, leaving an estimated balance in the Treasury on June\r\n30, 1860, of $14,381,808.40.\r\n\r\nThe estimated receipts during the next fiscal year, ending June 30,\r\n1861, are $66,225,000, which, with the balance estimated, as before\r\nstated, as remaining in the Treasury on the 30th June, 1860, will make\r\nan aggregate for the service of the next fiscal year of $80,606,808.40.\r\n\r\nThe estimated expenditures during the next fiscal year, ending 30th\r\nJune, 1861, are $66,714,928.79. Of this amount $3,386,621.34 will be\r\nrequired to pay the interest on the public debt, leaving the sum of\r\n$63,328,307.45 for the estimated ordinary expenditures during the fiscal\r\nyear ending 30th June, 1861. Upon these estimates a balance will be left\r\nin the Treasury on the 30th June, 1861, of $13,891,879.61.\r\n\r\nBut this balance, as well as that estimated to remain in the Treasury on\r\nthe 1st July, 1860, will be reduced by such appropriations as shall be\r\nmade by law to carry into effect certain Indian treaties during the\r\npresent fiscal year, asked for by the Secretary of the Interior, to the\r\namount of $539,350; and upon the estimates of the Postmaster-General for\r\nthe service of his Department the last fiscal year, ending 30th June,\r\n1859, amounting to $4,296,009, together with the further estimate of\r\nthat officer for the service of the present fiscal year, ending 30th\r\nJune, 1860, being $5,526,324, making an aggregate of $10,361,683.\r\n\r\nShould these appropriations be made as requested by the proper\r\nDepartments, the balance in the Treasury on the 30th June, 1861,\r\nwill not, it is estimated, exceed $3,530,196.61.\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the reports of the Secretaries of War, of the Navy,\r\nof the Interior, and of the Postmaster-General. They each contain\r\nvaluable information and important recommendations well worthy of the\r\nserious consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nIt will appear from the report of the Secretary of War that the Army\r\nexpenditures have been materially reduced by a system of rigid economy,\r\nwhich in his opinion offers every guaranty that the reduction will be\r\npermanent. The estimates of the Department for the next have been\r\nreduced nearly $2,000,000 below the estimates for the present fiscal\r\nyear and $500,000 below the amount granted for this year at the last\r\nsession of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of the Post-Office Department during the past fiscal\r\nyear, ending on the 30th June, 1859, exclusive of payments for mail\r\nservice specially provided for by Congress out of the general Treasury,\r\namounted to $14,964,493.33 and its receipts to $7,968,484.07, showing a\r\ndeficiency to be supplied from the Treasury of $6,996,009.26, against\r\n$5,235,677.15 for the year ending 30th June, 1858. The increased cost of\r\ntransportation, growing out of the expansion of the service required by\r\nCongress, explains this rapid augmentation of the expenditures. It is\r\ngratifying, however, to observe an increase of receipts for the year\r\nending on the 30th of June, 1859, equal to $481,691.21 compared with\r\nthose in the year ending on the 30th June, 1858.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the deficiency for the current fiscal year\r\nwill be $5,988,424.04, but that for the year ending 30th June, 1861,\r\nit will not exceed $1,342,473.90 should Congress adopt the measures of\r\nreform proposed and urged by the Postmaster-General. Since the month\r\nof March retrenchments have been made in the expenditures amounting to\r\n$1,826,471 annually, which, however, did not take effect until after\r\nthe commencement of the present fiscal year. The period seems to have\r\narrived for determining the question whether this Department shall\r\nbecome a permanent and ever-increasing charge upon the Treasury, or\r\nshall be permitted to resume the self-sustaining policy which had\r\nso long controlled its administration. The course of legislation\r\nrecommended by the Postmaster-General for the relief of the Department\r\nfrom its present embarrassments and for restoring it to its original\r\nindependence is deserving of your early and earnest consideration.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I would again commend to the just liberality of Congress\r\nthe local interests of the District of Columbia. Surely the city bearing\r\nthe name of Washington, and destined, I trust, for ages to be the\r\ncapital of our united, free, and prosperous Confederacy, has strong\r\nclaims on our favorable regard.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 7, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\npapers referred to therein, in answer to the resolution of the Senate of\r\nthe 21st of December last, in relation to the suspension of diplomatic\r\nrelations with Mexico by the United States legation in that country.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 16, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nHaving ratified the treaty between the United States and the Empire of\r\nChina, pursuant to the advice and consent of the Senate as expressed\r\nin their resolution of the 15th of December last, I lost no time in\r\nforwarding my ratification thither, in the hope that it might reach that\r\ncountry in season to be exchanged for the ratification of the Emperor\r\nwithin the time limited for that purpose. Unforeseen circumstances,\r\nhowever, retarded the exchange until the 16th of August last. I\r\nconsequently submit the instrument anew to the Senate, in order that\r\nthey may declare their assent to the postponement of the exchange of\r\nthe ratifications in such way as they may deem most expedient.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 19, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, with a view to ratification, a treaty of\r\nfriendship, commerce, and navigation concluded at Asuncion on the 4th of\r\nFebruary last between the plenipotentiaries of the United States and\r\nParaguay.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 19, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for consideration with a view to ratification,\r\na treaty of

of\r\nwhich a list is herewith furnished.\r\n\r\nI invite attention especially to the last document accompanying the\r\ntreaty, being a translation of a note of 26th September ultimo from Mr.\r\nMolina, chargé d'affaires _ad interim_ of Nicaragua, to the Secretary of\r\nState, together with the translation of the ratification of the treaty\r\nby the Nicaraguan Government, thereto annexed.\r\n\r\nThe amendment stipulated in the second article of the decree of\r\nratification by Nicaragua is in conformity with the views of this\r\nGovernment, to which the omitted clause was obnoxious, as will be seen\r\nby reference to the note of the Secretary of State to Mr. Trisarri of\r\n26th May, 1859, a copy of which is among the documents referred to.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 19, 1859_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, with a view to ratification, the special\r\nconvention concluded

the United\r\nStates accredited to the Mexican Government to the Secretary of State,\r\nrelative to these instruments.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 10, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for your constitutional action thereon, articles of\r\nagreement and convention made and concluded on the 5th day of October,\r\n1859,

instant, I transmit herewith the report of the Secretary of\r\nState and the papers accompanying it, relating to the treaties lately\r\nnegotiated by Mr. McLane and to the condition of the existing Government\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed from the report that these papers are originals, and\r\nthat it is indispensable they should be restored to the files of the\r\nDepartment when the subject to which they relate shall have been\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 20, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit

Harney, in command of the\r\nDepartment of Oregon.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 6, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit a copy of a letter of the 22d of April last from the chargé\r\nd'affaires _ad interim_ of the United States in China, and of the\r\nregulations for consular courts which accompanied it, for such revision\r\nthereof as Congress may deem expedient, pursuant to the sixth section of\r\nthe act approved the 11th of August, 1848.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 9, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit for the approval of the Senate an informal convention with\r\nthe Republic of Venezuela for the adjustment of claims of citizens of\r\nthe United States on the Government of that Republic growing out of\r\ntheir forcible expulsion by Venezuelan authorities from the guano island\r\nof Aves, in the Caribbean Sea. Usually it is not deemed necessary to\r\nconsult the Senate in regard to similar instruments relating to private\r\nclaims of small amount when the aggrieved parties are satisfied with\r\ntheir terms. In this instance, however, although the convention was\r\nnegotiated under the authority of the Venezuelan Executive and has\r\nbeen approved by the National Convention of that Republic, there is\r\nsome reason to apprehend that, owing to the frequent changes in that\r\nGovernment, the payments for which it provides may be refused or delayed\r\nupon the pretext that the instrument has not received the constitutional\r\nsanction of this Government. It is understood that if the payments\r\nadverted to shall be made as stipulated the convention will be\r\nacceptable to the claimants.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 9, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty of peace, friendship, commerce, and navigation\r\nbetween the United States and the Republic of Bolivia, signed by their\r\nrespective plenipotentiaries at La Paz on the 13th of May, 1858.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 20, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nEight memorials numerously signed by our fellow-citizens, \"residents for\r\nthe most part within the territorial limits of Kansas and Nebraska at\r\nand near the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains,\" have been presented\r\nto me, containing the request that I would submit the condition of\r\nthe memorialists to the two Houses of Congress in a special message.\r\nAccordingly, I transmit four of these memorials to the Senate and four\r\nto the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nThese memorialists invoke the interposition of Congress and of the\r\nExecutive \"for the early extinguishment of the Indian title, a\r\nconsequent survey and sale of the public land, and the establishment of\r\nan assay office in the immediate and daily reach of the citizens of that\r\nregion.\" They also urge \"the erection of a new Territory from contiguous\r\nportions of New Mexico, Utah, Kansas, and Nebraska,\" with the boundaries\r\nset forth in their memorial. They further state, if this request should\r\nnot be granted, \"that (inasmuch as during this year a census is to be\r\ntaken) an enabling act be passed with provision upon condition that if\r\non the 1st day of July, 1860, 30,000 resident inhabitants be found\r\nwithin the limits of the mineral region, then a Territorial government\r\nis constituted by Executive proclamation; or if on the 1st day of\r\nSeptember, 1860, 150,000 shall be returned, then a State organization\r\nto occur.\"\r\n\r\nIn transmitting these memorials to Congress I recommend that such\r\nprovision may be made for the protection and prosperity of our\r\nfellow-citizens at and near the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains as\r\ntheir distance and the exigencies of their condition may require for\r\ntheir government.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 25, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of

requesting\r\ninformation with regard to the present condition of the work of marking\r\nthe boundary pursuant to the first article of the treaty between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain of the

BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _April 3, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the Senate a report of the Attorney-General, in\r\nanswer to a resolution of the Senate of the 21st of March, \"that the\r\nPresident be respectfully requested to communicate to the Senate the\r\ncorrespondence between the judges of Utah and the Attorney-General or\r\nthe President with reference to the legal proceedings and condition of\r\naffairs in the Territory of Utah.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 5, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation between\r\nthe United States and the Republic of Honduras, signed by the\r\nplenipotentiaries of the parties in this city on the 28th day of last\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth article of this treaty is an exact copy of the\r\nsupplemental article of the \"treaty of friendship, commerce, and\r\nnavigation between Great Britain and the Republic of Honduras,\" dated\r\n26th day of August, 1856, with the necessary changes in names and dates.\r\nUnder this article the Government and people of the United States will\r\nenjoy in the fullest and most satisfactory manner the use of the\r\n\"Honduras Interoceanic Railway,\" in consideration of which the United\r\nStates recognizes the rights of sovereignty and property of Honduras\r\nover the line of the road and guarantees its neutrality, and, when \"the\r\nroad shall have been completed, equally engages, in conjunction with\r\nHonduras, to protect the same from interruption, seizure, or unjust\r\nconfiscation, from whatever quarter the attempt may proceed.\"\r\n\r\nThis treaty is in accordance with the policy inaugurated by the\r\nGovernment of the United States, and in an especial manner by the\r\nSenate, in the year 1846, and several treaties have been concluded to\r\ncarry it into effect. It is simple, and may be embraced in a few words.\r\nOn the one side a grant of free and uninterrupted transit for the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States over the transit routes\r\nacross the Isthmus, and on the other a guaranty of the neutrality and\r\nprotection of these routes, not only for the benefit of the Republics\r\nthrough which they pass, but, in the language of our treaty with New\r\nGranada, in order to secure to themselves the tranquil and constant\r\nenjoyment of these inter-oceanic communications.\r\n\r\nThe first in the series of these treaties is that with New Granada\r\nof the 12th December, 1846. This treaty was concluded before our\r\nacquisition of California and when our interests on the Pacific Coast\r\nwere of far less magnitude than at the present day. For years before\r\nthis period, however, the routes across the Isthmus had attracted the\r\nserious attention of this Government.\r\n\r\nThis treaty, after granting us the right of transit across the Isthmus\r\nof Panama in the most ample terms, binds this Government to guarantee\r\nto New Granada \"the perfect neutrality of the before-mentioned Isthmus,\r\nwith the view that the free transit from the one to the other sea may\r\nnot be interrupted or embarrassed in any future time while this treaty\r\nexists.\"\r\n\r\nIn one respect it goes further than any of its successors, because it\r\nnot only guarantees the neutrality of the route itself, but \"the rights\r\nof sovereignty and property\" of New Granada over the entire Province of\r\nPanama. It is worthy of remark that when it was sent to the Senate it\r\nwas accompanied by a message of President Polk, dated February 10, 1847,\r\nin which the attention of that body was especially called to these\r\nimportant stipulations of the thirty-fifth article, and in which it was\r\nstated, moreover, that our chargé d'affaires who negotiated the treaty\r\n\"acted in this particular upon his own responsibility and without\r\ninstructions.\" Under these circumstances the treaty was approved by the\r\nSenate and the transit policy to which I have referred was deliberately\r\nadopted. A copy of the executive document (confidential), Twenty-ninth\r\nCongress, second session, containing this message of President Polk and\r\nthe papers which accompanied it is hereto annexed.\r\n\r\nThe next in order of time of these treaties of transit and guaranty is\r\nthat of the 19th April, 1850, with Great Britain, commonly called the\r\nClayton and Bulwer treaty. This treaty, in affirmance of the policy of\r\nthe New Granada treaty, established a general principle which has ever\r\nsince, I believe, guided the proceedings of both Governments. The eighth\r\narticle of that treaty contains the following stipulations:\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States having not only desired in entering\r\ninto this convention to accomplish a particular object, but also to\r\nestablish a general principle, they hereby agree to extend their\r\nprotection by treaty stipulations to any other practicable\r\ncommunications, whether by canal or railway, across the isthmus which\r\nconnects North and South America, and especially to the interoceanic\r\ncommunications, should the same prove to be practicable, whether by\r\ncanal or railway, which are now proposed to be established by the way of\r\nTehuantepec or Panama.\r\n\r\nAnd that the said--\r\n\r\n  Canals or railways shall also be open on like terms to the citizens and\r\n  subjects of every other state which is willing to grant thereto such\r\n  protection as the United States and Great Britain propose to afford.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States, in a short time after the Clayton and Bulwer treaty\r\nwas concluded, carried this stipulation in regard to the Tehuantepec\r\nroute into effect by their treaty with Mexico of the 30th December,\r\n1853. The eighth article of this treaty, after granting to us the\r\ntransit privileges therein mentioned, stipulates that \"the Mexican\r\nGovernment having agreed to protect with its whole power the\r\nprosecution, preservation, and security of the work, the United States\r\nmay extend its protection as it shall judge wise, to use it when it may\r\nfeel sanctioned and warranted by the public or international law.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a sweeping grant of power to the United States, which no nation\r\nought to have conceded, but which, it is believed, has been confined\r\nwithin safe limits by our treaty with Mexico now before the Senate.\r\nSuch was believed to be the established policy of the Government at\r\nthe commencement of this Administration, viz, the grant of transits in\r\nour favor and the guaranty of our protection as an equivalent. This\r\nguaranty can never be dangerous under our form of government, because\r\nit can never be carried into execution without the express authority\r\nof Congress. Still, standing on the face of treaties, as it does, it\r\ndeters all evil-disposed parties from interfering with these routes.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances the attention of the Executive was early turned\r\nto the Nicaragua route as in many respects the most important and\r\nvaluable to the citizens of our country. In concluding a treaty to\r\nsecure our rights of transit over this route I experienced many\r\ndifficulties, which I need not now enumerate, because they are detailed\r\nin different messages to Congress. Finally a treaty was negotiated\r\nexactly in accordance with the established policy of the Government and\r\nthe views of the Executive, and clear from the embarrassments which\r\nmight arise under the phraseology of previous treaties. The fourteenth\r\narticle of the treaty contains a full, clear, and specific grant of\r\nthe right of transit to the United States and their citizens, and is\r\nbelieved to be perfectly unexceptionable. The fifteenth article, instead\r\nof leaving one equivalent duty of protection, general and unlimited, as\r\nin our treaty with New Granada and in the Clayton and Bulwer treaty, or\r\ninstead of that general right assured to the Government in the Mexican\r\ntreaty of extending its protection as it shall itself judge wise, when\r\nit may feel sanctioned and warranted by the public or international law,\r\nconfines the interference conceded within just and specific limits.\r\n\r\nUnder the sixteenth article of this treaty the Government of the United\r\nStates has no right to interpose for the protection of the Nicaragua\r\nroute except with the consent or at the request of the Government\r\nof Nicaragua, or of the minister thereof at Washington, or of the\r\ncompetent, legally appointed local authorities, civil or military; and\r\nwhen in the opinion of the Government of Nicaragua the necessity ceases\r\nsuch force shall be immediately withdrawn. Nothing can be more carefully\r\nguarded than this provision. No force can be employed unless upon the\r\nrequest of the Government of Nicaragua, and it must be immediately\r\nwithdrawn whenever in the opinion of that Government the necessity\r\nceases.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress shall come to adopt the measures necessary to carry this\r\nprovision of the treaty into effect they can guard it from any abuses\r\nwhich may possibly arise.\r\n\r\nThe general policy contained in these articles, although inaugurated by\r\nthe United States, has been fully adopted by the Governments of Great\r\nBritain and France. The plenipotentiaries of both these Governments have\r\nrecently negotiated treaties with Nicaragua, which are but transcripts\r\nof the treaty between the United States and Nicaragua now before the\r\nSenate. The treaty with France has been ratified, it is understood, by\r\nboth the French and Nicaraguan Governments, and is now in operation.\r\nThat with Great Britain has been delayed by other negotiations in\r\nNicaragua, but it is believed that these are now concluded and that the\r\nratifications of the British treaty will soon, therefore, be exchanged.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed that no objection will be made to \"the exceptional case\"\r\nof the sixteenth article, which is only intended to provide for the\r\nlanding of sailors or marines from our vessels which may happen to be\r\nwithin reach of the point of difficulty, in order to protect the lives\r\nand property of citizens of the United States from unforeseen and\r\nimminent danger.\r\n\r\nThe same considerations may be suggested with respect to the fifth\r\narticle of the treaty with Mexico, which is also pending before the\r\nSenate. This article is an exact copy of the sixteenth article, just\r\nreferred to, of the treaty with Nicaragua.\r\n\r\nThe treaty with Honduras, which is now submitted to the Senate, follows\r\non this subject the language of the British treaty with that Republic,\r\nand is not, therefore, identical in its terms with the Nicaraguan and\r\nMexican treaties. The same policy, however, has been adopted in all of\r\nthem, and it will not fail, I am persuaded, to receive from the Senate\r\nall that consideration which it so eminently deserves. The importance to\r\nthe United States of securing free and safe transit routes across the\r\nAmerican Isthmus can not well be overestimated. These routes are of\r\ngreat interest, of course, to all commercial nations, but they are\r\nespecially so to us from our geographical and political position as\r\nan American State and because they furnish a necessary communication\r\nbetween our Atlantic and Pacific States and Territories.\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States can never permit these routes to be\r\npermanently interrupted, nor can it safely allow them to pass under the\r\ncontrol of other rival nations. While it seeks no exclusive privileges\r\nupon them for itself, it can never consent to be made tributary to their\r\nuse to any European power. It is worthy of consideration, however,\r\nwhether to some extent it would not necessarily become so if after Great\r\nBritain and France have adopted our policy and made treaties with the\r\nIsthmian Governments in pursuance of it we should ourselves reconsider\r\nit and refuse to pursue it in the treaties of the United States. I might\r\nadd that the opening of these transit routes can not fail to extend the\r\ntrade and commerce of the United States with the countries through which\r\nthey pass; to afford an outlet and a market for our manufactures within\r\ntheir territories; to encourage American citizens to develop their vast\r\nstores of mining and mineral wealth for our benefit, and to introduce\r\namong them a wholesome American influence calculated to prevent\r\nrevolutions and to render their governments stable.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 10, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI communicate herewith a report from the Secretary of State, in reply\r\nto the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 6th instant,\r\nrespecting the expulsion of American citizens from Mexico and the\r\nconfiscation of their property by General Miramon.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 10, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n23d of December, 1858, requesting information in regard to the duties on\r\ntobacco in foreign countries, I transmit a report from the Secretary of\r\nState and the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _April 11, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nMarch 26, 1860, requesting me \"to transmit to the House all information\r\nin the possession of the officer in charge of the Coast Survey showing\r\nthe practicability of making Harlem River navigable for commercial\r\npurposes, and the expenses thereof,\" I herewith transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury containing the desired information.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 11, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 2d February,\r\n1859, requesting information in regard to the compulsory enlistment\r\nof citizens of the United States in the army of Prussia, I transmit\r\na report from the Secretary of State and the documents by which it\r\nwas accompanied.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 12, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 23d of February\r\nlast, requesting information in regard to the occupation by American\r\ncitizens of the island of Navassa, in the West Indies, I transmit a\r\nreport from the Secretary of State and the documents by which it was\r\naccompanied.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 12, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of War, with its\r\naccompaniments, communicating the information called for by the\r\nresolution of the House of Representatives of the 20th ultimo,\r\nrespecting Indian hostilities in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 16, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 4th instant,\r\nrequesting information not heretofore called for relating to the claim\r\nof any foreign governments to the military services of naturalized\r\nAmerican citizens, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and\r\nthe documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, D.C., _April 17, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith, for the information of the Senate, the Paris\r\nMoniteur of the 4th February last, the official journal of the French\r\nGovernment, containing an imperial decree promulgating a treaty of\r\nfriendship, commerce, and navigation, concluded on the 11th April, 1859,\r\nbetween France and the Republic of Nicaragua. It will be found in all\r\nrespects similar to the treaty between the United States and Nicaragua\r\nnow pending in the Senate.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 20, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith a report of the Secretary of the Navy, to whom was\r\nreferred the resolution of the House of Representatives of April 10,\r\n1860, requesting the President to communicate to the House, in addition\r\nto the information asked in the resolution adopted in reference to the\r\nAfrican slave trade, \"the number of officers and men in the service of\r\nthe United States belonging to the African Squadron who have died in\r\nthat service since the date of the Ashburton treaty up to the present\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 20, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives \"that the\r\nPresident be requested to communicate to the House, if not incompatible\r\nwith the public service, all such information as he may possess in\r\nrelation to the existence\" of the Territory of Minnesota, he has to\r\nstate that he possesses no information upon the subject except what has\r\nbeen derived from the acts of Congress and the proceedings of the House\r\nitself. Since the date of the act of the 11th of May, 1858, admitting\r\na portion of the Territory of Minnesota as a State into the Union, no\r\nact has been performed by the Executive either affirming or denying the\r\nexistence of such Territory. The question in regard to that portion of\r\nthe Territory without the limits of the existing State remains for the\r\ndecision of Congress, and is in the same condition it was when the State\r\nwas admitted into the Union.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 22, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return to the Senate the original convention between the United States\r\nand the Republic of New Granada, signed on the 10th September, 1857, and\r\nratified by me as amended by the Senate on the 12th March, 1859.\r\n\r\nThe amendments of the Senate were immediately transmitted to New Granada\r\nfor acceptance, but they arrived at Bogota three days after the\r\nadjournment of the Congress of that Republic, notwithstanding the\r\nsession had been protracted for twenty days solely with a view to the\r\nconsideration of the convention after it should have received the\r\nsanction of this Government.\r\n\r\nAt the earliest moment after the assembling of the New Granadian\r\nCongress, on the 1st of February last, the convention as amended and\r\nratified was laid before that body, and on the 25th of the same month\r\nit was approved with the amendments. Inasmuch, however, as the period\r\nhad expired within which by the third amendment of the Senate the\r\nratifications should have been exchanged, the Congress of New Granada\r\nprovided that \"the convention should be ratified and the ratification\r\nshould be exchanged at whatever time the Governments of the two\r\nRepublics may deem convenient for the purpose, and therefore the period\r\nhas been extended which the Senate of the United States had fixed.\"\r\n\r\nThe expediency of authorizing the exchange of ratifications at such time\r\nas may be convenient to the two Governments is consequently submitted to\r\nthe consideration of the Senate.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 23, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 18th instant,\r\nrequesting a copy of the instructions from the Department of State to\r\nMr. McLane when appointed minister to China, I transmit a report from\r\nthe Secretary of State, with the instructions which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 24, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolutions of the House of Representatives of\r\nthe 2d March, 1859, and of the 26th ultimo, requesting information\r\nrelative to discriminations in Switzerland against citizens of the\r\nUnited States of the Hebrew persuasion, I transmit a report of the\r\nSecretary of State, with the documents by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 25, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with a resolution of the Senate of the 22d ultimo, calling\r\nfor information concerning the expulsion from Prussia of Eugene Dullye,\r\na naturalized citizen of the United States, I transmit a report from the\r\nSecretary of State, dated the 24th instant.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 27, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of\r\nMarch 26, 1860, requesting \"copies of all official correspondence\r\nbetween the civil and military officers stationed in Utah Territory with\r\nthe heads or bureaus of their respective Departments, or between any of\r\nsaid officers, illustrating or tending to show the condition of affairs\r\nin said Territory since the 1st day of October, 1857, and which may not\r\nhave been heretofore officially published,\" I transmit reports from the\r\nSecretaries of State and War and the documents by which they were\r\naccompanied.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 30, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 2d of February,\r\n1859, requesting information in regard to the compulsory service of\r\ncitizens of the United States in the army of Prussia, I transmit an\r\nadditional report from the Secretary of State and the document by which\r\nit is accompanied.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE MANSION, _May 1, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate adopted March 19, 1860,\r\ncalling for the correspondence, etc., in relation to the Mountain Meadow\r\nand other massacres in Utah Territory, I have the honor to transmit the\r\nreport, with the accompanying documents, of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, who was instructed to collect the information.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 3, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a convention between the United States and Spain for\r\nthe settlement of claims, signed at Madrid on the 5th of March last.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 19, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nOn the 26th day of April last Lieutenant Craven, of the United States\r\nsteamer _Mohawk_, captured the slaver _Wildfire_ on the coast of Cuba,\r\nwith 507 African negroes on board. The prize was brought into Key West\r\non the 31st April and the negroes were delivered into the custody of\r\nFernando J. Moreno, marshal of the southern district of Florida.\r\n\r\nThe question which now demands immediate decision is, What disposition\r\nshall be made of these Africans? In the annual message to Congress of\r\nDecember 6, 1858, I expressed my opinion in regard to the construction\r\nof the act of the 3d March, 1819, \"in addition to the acts prohibiting\r\nthe slave trade,\" so far as the same is applicable to the present case.\r\nFrom this I make the following extract:\r\n\r\n  Under the second section of this act the President is \"authorized to\r\n  make such regulations and arrangements as he may deem expedient for the\r\n  safe-keeping, support, and removal beyond the limits of the United\r\n  States of all such negroes, mulattoes, or persons of color\" captured by\r\n  vessels of the United States as may be delivered to the marshal of the\r\n  district into which they are brought, \"and to appoint a proper person\r\n  or persons residing upon the coast of Africa as agent or agents for\r\n  receiving the negroes, mulattoes, or persons of color delivered from on\r\n  board vessels seized in the prosecution of the slave trade by commanders\r\n  of United States armed vessels.\"\r\n\r\n  A doubt immediately arose as to the true construction of this act. It is\r\n  quite clear from its terms that the President was authorized to provide\r\n  \"for the safe-keeping, support, and removal\" of these negroes up till\r\n  the time of their delivery to the agent on the coast of Africa, but no\r\n  express provision was made for their protection and support after they\r\n  had reached the place of their destination. Still, an agent was to be\r\n  appointed to receive them in Africa, and it could not have been supposed\r\n  that Congress intended he should desert them at the moment they were\r\n  received and turn them loose on that inhospitable coast to perish for\r\n  want of food or to become again the victims of the slave trade. Had this\r\n  been the intention of Congress, the employment of an agent to receive\r\n  them, who is required to reside on the coast, was unnecessary, and they\r\n  might have been landed by our vessels anywhere in Africa and left\r\n  exposed to the sufferings and the fate which would certainly await them.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Monroe, in his special message of December 17, 1819, at the first\r\n  session after the act was passed, announced to Congress what in his\r\n  opinion was its true construction. He believed it to be his duty under\r\n  it to follow these unfortunates into Africa and make provision for\r\n  them there until they should be able to provide for themselves. In\r\n  communicating this interpretation of the act to Congress he stated that\r\n  some doubt had been entertained as to its true intent and meaning, and\r\n  he submitted the question to them so that they might, \"should it be\r\n  deemed advisable, amend the same before further proceedings are had\r\n  under it.\" Nothing was done by Congress to explain the act, and Mr.\r\n  Monroe proceeded to carry it into execution according to his own\r\n  interpretation. This, then, became the practical construction.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdopting this construction of President Monroe, I entered into an\r\nagreement with the Colonization Society, dated 7th September, 1858, to\r\nreceive the Africans which had been captured on the slaver _Echo_ from\r\nthe agent of the United States in Liberia, to furnish them during the\r\nperiod of one year thereafter with comfortable shelter, clothing, and\r\nprovisions, and to cause them to be instructed in the arts of civilized\r\nlife suitable to their condition, at the rate of $150 for each\r\nindividual. It was believed that within that period they would be\r\nprepared to become citizens of Liberia and to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nAs Congress was not then in session and as there was no outstanding\r\nappropriation applicable to this purpose, the society were obliged to\r\ndepend for payment on the future action of that body. I recommended\r\nthis appropriation, and $75,000 were granted by the act of 3d March,\r\n1859 (the consular and diplomatic bill), \"to enable the President of the\r\nUnited States to carry into effect the act of Congress of 3d March, 1819,\r\nand any subsequent acts now in force for the suppression of the slave\r\ntrade.\" Of this appropriation there remains unexpended the sum of\r\n$24,350.90, after deducting from it an advance made by the Secretary\r\nof the Interior out of the judiciary fund of $11,348.10.\r\n\r\nI regret to say that under the mode adopted in regard to the Africans\r\ncaptured on board the _Echo_ the expense will be large, but this seems\r\nto a great extent to be inevitable without a violation of the laws of\r\nhumanity. The expenditure upon this scale for those captured on board\r\nthe _Wildfire_ will not be less than $100,000, and may considerably exceed\r\nthat sum. Still, it ought to be observed that during the period when the\r\nGovernment itself, through its own agents, undertook the task of providing\r\nfor captured negroes in Africa the cost per head was much greater\r\nthan that which I agreed to pay the Colonization Society.\r\n\r\nBut it will not be sufficient for Congress to limit the amount appropriated\r\nto the case of the _Wildfire_. It is probable, judging from the\r\nincreased activity of the slave trade and the vigilance of our cruisers,\r\nthat several similar captures may be made before the end of the year.\r\nAn appropriation ought therefore to be granted large enough to cover\r\nsuch contingencies.\r\n\r\nThe period has arrived when it is indispensable to provide some specific\r\nlegislation for the guidance of the Executive on this subject. With this\r\nview I would suggest that Congress might authorize the President to\r\nenter into a general agreement with the Colonization Society binding\r\nthem to receive on the coast of Africa, from an agent there, all the\r\ncaptured Africans which may be delivered to him, and to maintain them\r\nfor a limited period, upon such terms and conditions as may combine\r\nhumanity toward these unfortunates with a just economy. This would\r\nobviate the necessity of making a new bargain with every new capture\r\nand would prevent delay and avoid expense in the disposition of the\r\ncaptured. The law might then provide that in all cases where this may be\r\npracticable the captor should carry the negroes directly to Africa and\r\ndeliver them to the American agent there, afterwards bringing the\r\ncaptured vessel to the United States for adjudication.\r\n\r\nThe capturing officer, in case he should bring his prize directly to the\r\nUnited States, ought to be required to land the negroes in some one or\r\nmore ports, to be designated by Congress, where the prevailing health\r\nthroughout the year is good. At these ports cheap but permanent\r\naccommodations might be provided for the negroes until they could be\r\nsent away, without incurring the expense of erecting such accommodations\r\nat every port where the capturing officer may think proper to enter. On\r\nthe present occasion these negroes have been brought to Key West, and,\r\naccording to the estimate presented by the marshal of the southern\r\ndistrict of Florida to the Secretary of the Interior, the cost of\r\nproviding temporary quarters for them will be $2,500 and the aggregate\r\nexpenses for the single month of May will amount to $12,000. But this is\r\nfar from being the worst evil. Within a few weeks the yellow fever will\r\nmost probably prevail at Key West, and hence the marshal urges their\r\nremoval from their present quarters at an early day, which must be done,\r\nin any event, as soon as practicable. For these reasons I earnestly\r\ncommend this subject to the immediate attention of Congress. I transmit\r\nherewith a copy of the letter and estimate of Fernando J. Moreno,\r\nmarshal of the southern district of Florida, to the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, dated 10th May, 1860, together with a copy of the letter of\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior to myself, dated 16th May.\r\n\r\nIt is truly lamentable that Great Britain and the United States should\r\nbe obliged to expend such a vast amount of blood and treasure for the\r\nsuppression of the African slave trade, and this when the only portions\r\nof the civilized world where it is tolerated and encouraged are the\r\nSpanish islands of Cuba and Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 22, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI transmit herewith the copy of a letter, dated yesterday, from the\r\nSecretary of the Interior, communicating the copy of a letter addressed\r\nto him on the 13th instant by Fernando J. Moreno, marshal of the\r\nsouthern district of Florida. From this it appears that Lieutenant\r\nStanly, of the United States steamer _Wyandotte_, captured the bark\r\n_William_, with about 550 African negroes on board, on the south side of\r\nCuba, near the Isle of Pines, and brought her into Key West on the 12th\r\ninstant. These negroes have doubtless been delivered to the marshal, and\r\nwith those captured on board the _Wildfire_ will make the number in his\r\ncustody about 1,000. More may be daily expected at Key West, which, both\r\non account of a deficiency of water and provisions and its exposure to\r\nyellow fever, is one of the worst spots for an African negro depot which\r\ncould be found on the coast of the United States.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 22, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution passed on the 26th of March last, calling\r\nfor a detailed statement of the expenditures from the \"appropriations\r\nmade during the first session of the Thirty-fourth Congress and the\r\nfirst and second sessions of the Thirty-fifth Congress for legal\r\nassistance and other necessary expenditures in the disposal of private\r\nland claims in California and for the service of special counsel and\r\nother extraordinary expenses of such land claims, amounting in all to\r\n$114,000,\" I have the honor to transmit to the House of Representatives\r\na report of the Attorney-General, which, with the accompanying\r\ndocuments, contains the information required.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _May 26, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the\r\n21st instant, requesting any information recently received respecting\r\nthe Chinese cooly trade which has not been heretofore communicated to\r\nCongress, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State, with the\r\ndocuments which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 14, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI submit, for the consideration of the Senate, articles of agreement and\r\nconvention with the Delaware Indians, concluded May 13, 1860. I concur\r\nin the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior that the treaty\r\nshould be ratified, with the amendments suggested by the Commissioner\r\nof Indian Affairs.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE 23, 1860\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN: I feel it my duty to communicate to you that it has been\r\nfound impracticable to conclude a contract for the transportation of the\r\nmails between our Atlantic and Pacific ports on the terms authorized by\r\nthe fourth section of an act entitled \"An act making appropriations for\r\nthe service of the Post-Office Department during the fiscal year ending\r\n30th June, 1861,\" approved 15th June, 1860. The Postmaster-General has\r\noffered the California mails to the several companies and shipowners\r\nengaged in the trade with the Pacific via the Isthmus, but they have all\r\ndeclined carrying them for the postages. They demand a higher rate of\r\ncompensation, and unless power is given to the Postmaster-General to\r\naccede to this demand I am well satisfied that these mails can not\r\nbe forwarded. It should not be forgotten that, in consequence of the\r\ndiversion of a large part of the letter mail to the overland route,\r\nthe postages derived from the California service have been greatly\r\nreduced and afford a wholly inadequate remuneration for the ocean\r\ntransportation. The weight of these mails, averaging from 12 to 15 tons\r\nsemimonthly, renders it, in view of the climate and character of the\r\nroad, manifestly impossible to forward them overland without involving\r\nan expenditure which no wise administration of the Government would\r\nimpose upon the Treasury. I therefore earnestly recommend that the act\r\nreferred to be so modified as to empower the Postmaster-General to\r\nprovide for carrying the California mails at a rate of compensation\r\nwhich may be deemed reasonable and just.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 25, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have approved and signed the bill entitled \"An act making\r\nappropriation for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the year\r\nending the 30th of June, 1861.\"\r\n\r\nIn notifying the House of my approval of this bill I deem it proper,\r\nunder the peculiar circumstances of the case, to make a few explanatory\r\nobservations, so that my course may not hereafter be misunderstood.\r\n\r\nAmid a great variety of important appropriations, this bill contains an\r\nappropriation \"for the completion of the Washington Aqueduct, $500,000,\r\nto be expended according to the plans and estimates of Captain Meigs\r\nand under his superintendence: _Provided_, That the office of engineer\r\nof the Potomac Waterworks is hereby abolished and its duties shall\r\nhereafter be discharged by the chief engineer of the Washington\r\nAqueduct.\" To this appropriation, for a wise and beneficial object,\r\nI have not the least objection. It is true I had reason to believe when\r\nthe last appropriation was made of $800,000 on the 12th of June, 1858,\r\n\"_for the completion of the Washington Aqueduct_\" this would have been\r\nsufficient for the purpose. It is now discovered, however, that it will\r\nrequire half a million more \"_for the completion of the Washington\r\nAqueduct_\" and this ought to be granted.\r\n\r\nThe Captain Meigs to whom the bill refers is Montgomery C. Meigs, a\r\ncaptain in the Corps of Engineers of the Army of the United States, who\r\nhas superintended this work from its commencement under the authority\r\nof the late and present Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nHad this appropriation been made in the usual form, no difficulty could\r\nhave arisen upon it. This bill, however, annexes a declaration to the\r\nappropriation that the money is to be expended under the superintendence\r\nof Captain Meigs.\r\n\r\nThe first aspect in which this clause presented itself to my mind was\r\nthat it interfered with the right of the President to be \"Commander in\r\nChief of the Army and Navy of the United States.\" If this had really\r\nbeen the case, there would have been an end to the question. Upon\r\nfurther examination I deemed it impossible that Congress could have\r\nintended to interfere with the clear right of the President to command\r\nthe Army and to order its officers to any duty he might deem most\r\nexpedient for the public interest. If they could withdraw an officer\r\nfrom the command of the President and select him for the performance\r\nof an executive duty, they might upon the same principle annex to an\r\nappropriation to carry on a war a condition requiring it not to be used\r\nfor the defense of the country unless a particular person of its own\r\nselection should command the Army. It was impossible that Congress could\r\nhave had such an intention, and therefore, according to my construction\r\nof the clause in question, it merely designated Captain Meigs as its\r\npreference for the work, without intending to deprive the President of\r\nthe power to order him to any other army duty for the performance of\r\nwhich he might consider him better adapted. Still, whilst this clause\r\nmay not be, and I believe is not, a violation of the Constitution,\r\nyet how destructive it would be to all proper subordination and how\r\ndemoralizing its effect upon the morale of the Army if it should become\r\na precedent for future legislation! Officers might then be found,\r\ninstead of performing their appropriate duties, besieging the halls of\r\nCongress for the purpose of obtaining special favors and choice places\r\nby legislative enactment. Under these circumstances I have deemed it\r\nbut fair to inform Congress that whilst I do not consider the bill\r\nunconstitutional, this is only because, in my opinion, Congress did not\r\nintend by the language which they have employed to interfere with my\r\nabsolute authority to order Captain Meigs to any other service I might\r\ndeem expedient. My perfect right still remains, notwithstanding the\r\nclause, to send him away from Washington to any part of the Union to\r\nsuperintend the erection of a fortification or on any other appropriate\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nIt has been alleged, I think without sufficient cause, that this\r\nclause is unconstitutional because it has created a new office and has\r\nappointed Captain Meigs to perform its duties. If it had done this, it\r\nwould have been a clear question, because Congress have no right to\r\nappoint to any office, this being specially conferred upon the President\r\nand Senate. It is evident that Congress intended nothing more by this\r\nclause than to express a decided opinion that Captain Meigs should be\r\ncontinued in the employment to which he had been previously assigned\r\nby competent authority.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that another question of grave importance may arise\r\nout of this clause. Is the appropriation conditional and will it fall\r\nprovided I do not deem it proper that it shall be expended under the\r\nsuperintendence of Captain Meigs? This is a question which shall receive\r\nserious consideration, because upon its decision may depend whether\r\nthe completion of the waterworks shall be arrested for another season.\r\nIt is not probable that Congress could have intended that this great\r\nand important work should depend upon the various casualties and\r\nvicissitudes incident to the natural or official life of a single\r\nofficer of the Army. This would be to make the work subordinate to the\r\nman, and not the man to the work, and to reverse our great axiomatic\r\nrule of \"principles, not men.\" I desire to express no opinion upon the\r\nsubject. Should the question ever arise, it shall have my serious\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGES.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: The messages of February 1 and February 6, 1860, are\r\npocket vetoes.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _February 1, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the last Congress a bill, which had passed both\r\nHouses, entitled \"An act making an appropriation for deepening the\r\nchannel over the St. Clair flats, in the State of Michigan,\" was\r\npresented to me for approval.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to observe that during the closing hours of a\r\nsession it is impossible for the President on the instant to examine\r\ninto the merits or demerits of an important bill, involving, as this\r\ndoes, grave questions both of expediency and of constitutional power,\r\nwith that care and deliberation demanded by his public duty as well as\r\nby the best interests of the country. For this reason the Constitution\r\nhas in all cases allowed him ten days for deliberation, because if a\r\nbill be presented to him within the last ten days of the session he is\r\nnot required to return it, either with an approval or a veto, but may\r\nretain it, \"in which case it shall not be a law.\" Whilst an occasion can\r\nrarely occur when so long a period as ten days would be required to\r\nenable the President to decide whether he should approve or veto a\r\nbill, yet to deny him even two days on important questions before the\r\nadjournment of each session for this purpose, as recommended by a former\r\nannual message, would not only be unjust to him, but a violation of the\r\nspirit of the Constitution. To require him to approve a bill when it is\r\nimpossible he could examine into its merits would be to deprive him of\r\nthe exercise of his constitutional discretion and convert him into\r\na mere register of the decrees of Congress. I therefore deem it a\r\nsufficient reason for having retained the bill in question that it\r\nwas not presented to me until the last day of the session.\r\n\r\nSince the termination of the last Congress I have made a thorough\r\nexamination of the questions involved in the bill to deepen the channel\r\nover the St. Clair flats, and now proceed to express the opinions which I\r\nhave formed upon the subject; and\r\n\r\n1. Even if this had been a mere question of expediency, it was, to say\r\nthe least, extremely doubtful whether the bill ought to have been\r\napproved, because the object which Congress intended to accomplish\r\nby the appropriation which it contains of $55,000 had been already\r\nsubstantially accomplished. I do not mean to allege that the work had\r\nbeen completed in the best manner, but it was sufficient for all\r\npractical purposes.\r\n\r\nThe St. Clair flats are formed by the St. Clair River, which empties\r\ninto the lake of that name by several mouths, and which forms a bar or\r\nshoal on which in its natural state there is not more than 6 or 7 feet\r\nof water. This shoal is interposed between the mouth of the river and\r\nthe deep water of the lake, a distance of 6,000 feet, and in its natural\r\ncondition was a serious obstruction to navigation. The obvious remedy\r\nfor this was to deepen a channel through these flats by dredging, so\r\nas to enable vessels which could navigate the lake and the river to\r\npass through this intermediate channel. This object had been already\r\naccomplished by previous appropriations, but without my knowledge, when\r\nthe bill was presented to me. Captain Whipple, of the Topographical\r\nEngineers, to whom the expenditure of the last appropriation of $45,000\r\nfor this purpose in 1856 was intrusted, in his annual report of the 1st\r\nOctober, 1858, stated that the dredging was discontinued on the 26th\r\nAugust, 1858, when a channel had been cut averaging 275 feet wide, with\r\na depth varying from 12 to 15-1/2 feet. He says:\r\n\r\nSo long as the lake retains its present height we may assume that the\r\ndepth in the channel will be at least 13-1/2 feet.\r\n\r\nWith this result, highly creditable to Captain Whipple, he observes\r\nthat if he has been correctly informed \"all the lake navigators are\r\ngratified.\" Besides, afterwards, and during the autumn of 1858, the\r\nCanadian Government expended $20,000 in deepening and widening the inner\r\nend of the channel excavated by the United States. No complaint had been\r\nmade previous to the passage of the bill of obstructions to the commerce\r\nand navigation across the St. Clair flats. What, then, was the object of\r\nthe appropriation proposed by the bill?\r\n\r\nIt appears that the surface of the water in Lake St. Clair has been\r\ngradually rising, until in 1858 it had attained an elevation of 4 feet\r\nabove what had been its level in 1841. It is inferred, whether correctly\r\nor not it is not for me to say, that the surface of the water may\r\ngradually sink to the level of 1841, and in that event the water, which\r\nwas, when the bill passed, 13-1/2 feet deep in the channel, might sink\r\nto 9-1/2 feet, and thus obstruct the passage.\r\n\r\nTo provide for this contingency, Captain Whipple suggested \"the\r\npropriety of placing the subject before Congress, with an estimate for\r\nexcavating a cut through the center of the new channel 150 feet in width\r\nand 4-1/2 feet deep, so as to obtain from the river to the lake a depth\r\nof 18 feet during seasons of extreme high water and 12 feet at periods\r\nof extreme low water.\" It was not alleged that any present necessity\r\nexisted for this narrower cut in the bottom of the present channel,\r\nbut it is inferred that for the reason stated it may hereafter become\r\nnecessary. Captain Whipple's estimate amounted to $50,000, but Congress\r\nby the bill have granted $55,000. Now, if no other objection existed\r\nagainst this measure, it would not seem necessary that the appropriation\r\nshould have been made for the purpose indicated. The channel was\r\nsufficiently deep for all practical purposes; but from natural causes\r\nconstantly operating in the lake, which I need not explain, this channel\r\nis peculiarly liable to fill up. What is really required is that it\r\nshould at intervals be dredged out, so as to preserve its present depth;\r\nand surely the comparatively trifling expense necessary for this purpose\r\nought not to be borne by the United States. After an improvement has\r\nbeen once constructed by appropriations from the Treasury it is not too\r\nmuch to expect that it should be kept in repair by that portion of the\r\ncommercial and navigating interests which enjoys its peculiar benefits.\r\n\r\nThe last report made by Captain Whipple, dated on the 13th September\r\nlast, has been submitted to Congress by the Secretary of War, and to\r\nthis I would refer for information, which is, upon the whole, favorable,\r\nin relation to the present condition of the channel through the St.\r\nClair flats.\r\n\r\n2. But the far more important question is, Does Congress possess the\r\npower under the Constitution to deepen the channels of rivers and to\r\ncreate and improve harbors for purposes of commerce?\r\n\r\nThe question of the constitutional power of Congress to construct\r\ninternal improvements within the States has been so frequently and\r\nso elaborately discussed that it would seem useless on this occasion\r\nto repeat or to refute at length arguments which have been so often\r\nadvanced. For my own opinions on this subject I might refer to President\r\nPolk's carefully considered message of the 15th December, 1847,\r\naddressed to the House of Representatives whilst I was a member of\r\nhis Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe power to pass the bill in question, if it exist at all, must be\r\nderived from the power \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations and\r\namong the several States and with the Indian tribes.\"\r\n\r\nThe power \"to regulate:\" Does this ever embrace the power to create or\r\nto construct? To say that it does is to confound the meaning of words\r\nof well-known signification. The word \"regulate\" has several shades of\r\nmeaning, according to its application to different subjects, but never\r\ndoes it approach the signification of creative power. The regulating\r\npower necessarily presupposes the existence of something to be\r\nregulated. As applied to commerce, it signifies, according to the\r\nlexicographers, \"to subject to rules or restrictions, as to regulate\r\ntrade,\" etc. The Constitution itself is its own best expounder of the\r\nmeaning of words employed by its framers. Thus, Congress have the power\r\n\"to coin money.\" This is the creative power. Then immediately follows\r\nthe power \"to regulate the value thereof \"--that is, of the coined money\r\nthus brought into existence. The words \"regulate,\" \"regulation,\" and\r\n\"regulations\" occur several times in the Constitution, but always with\r\nthis subordinate meaning. Thus, after the creative power \"to raise and\r\nsupport armies\" and \"to provide and maintain a navy\" had been conferred\r\nupon Congress, then follows the power \"to make rules for the government\r\nand regulation of the land and naval forces\" thus called into being. So\r\nthe Constitution, acting upon the self-evident fact that \"commerce with\r\nforeign nations and among the several States and with the Indian tribes\"\r\nalready existed, conferred upon Congress the power \"to regulate\" this\r\ncommerce. Thus, according to Chief Justice Marshall, the power to\r\nregulate commerce \"is the power to prescribe the rule by which commerce\r\nis to be governed.\" And Mr. Madison, in his veto message of the 3d\r\nMarch, 1817, declares that--\r\n\r\n  \"The power to regulate commerce among the several States\" can not\r\n  include a power to construct roads and canals and to improve the\r\n  navigation of water courses, in order to facilitate, promote, and\r\n  secure such commerce, without a latitude of construction departing\r\n  from the ordinary import of the terms, strengthened by the known\r\n  inconveniences which doubtless led to the grant of this remedial\r\n  power to Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know from the history of the Constitution what these inconveniences\r\nwere. Different States admitted foreign imports at different rates of\r\nduty. Those which had prescribed a higher rate of duty for the purpose\r\nof increasing their revenue were defeated in this object by the\r\nlegislation of neighboring States admitting the same foreign articles\r\nat lower rates. Hence jealousies and dangerous rivalries had sprung up\r\nbetween the different States. It was chiefly in the desire to provide\r\na remedy for these evils that the Federal Convention originated. The\r\nConstitution, for this purpose, conferred upon Congress the power to\r\nregulate commerce in such a manner that duties should be uniform in all\r\nthe States composing the Confederacy, and, moreover, expressly provided\r\nthat \"no preference shall be given by any regulation of commerce or\r\nrevenue to the ports of one State over those of another.\" If the\r\nconstruction of a harbor or deepening the channel of a river be a\r\nregulation of commerce, as the advocates of this power contend, this\r\nwould give the ports of the State within which these improvements were\r\nmade a preference over the ports of other States, and thus be a\r\nviolation of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to assert that no human being in existence when the\r\nConstitution was framed entertained the idea or the apprehension that\r\nby conferring upon Congress the power to regulate commerce its framers\r\nintended to embrace the power of constructing roads and canals and of\r\ncreating and improving harbors and deepening the channels of rivers\r\nthroughout our extensive Confederacy. Indeed, one important branch of\r\nthis very power had been denied to Congress in express terms by the\r\nConvention. A proposition was made in the Convention to confer on\r\nCongress the power \"to provide for the cutting of canals when deemed\r\nnecessary.\" This was rejected by the strong majority of eight States to\r\nthree. Among the reasons given for this rejection was that \"the expense\r\nin such cases will fall on the United States and the benefits accrue\r\nto the places where the canals may be cut.\"\r\n\r\nTo say that the simple power of regulating commerce embraces within\r\nitself that of constructing harbors, of deepening the channels of\r\nrivers--in short, of creating a system of internal improvements for the\r\npurpose of facilitating the operations of commerce--would be to adopt\r\na latitude of construction under which all political power might be\r\nusurped by the Federal Government. Such a construction would be in\r\nconflict with the well-known jealousy against Federal power which\r\nactuated the framers of the Constitution. It is certain that the power\r\nin question is not enumerated among the express grants to Congress\r\ncontained in the instrument. In construing the Constitution we must then\r\nnext inquire, Is its exercise \"necessary and proper\"?--not whether it\r\nmay be convenient or useful \"for carrying into execution\" the power\r\nto regulate commerce among the States. But the jealous patriots of\r\nthat day were not content even with this strict rule of construction.\r\nApprehending that a dangerous latitude of interpretation might be\r\napplied in future times to the enumerated grants of power, they procured\r\nan amendment to be made to the original instrument, which declares that\r\n\"the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor\r\nprohibited by it to the States are reserved to the States respectively\r\nor to the people.\"\r\n\r\nThe distinctive spirit and character which pervades the Constitution is\r\nthat the powers of the General Government are confined chiefly to our\r\nintercourse with foreign nations, to questions of peace and war, and to\r\nsubjects of common interest to all the States, carefully leaving the\r\ninternal and domestic concerns of each individual State to be controlled\r\nby its own people and legislature. Without specifically enumerating\r\nthese powers, it must be admitted that this well-marked distinction runs\r\nthrough the whole instrument. In nothing does the wisdom of its framers\r\nappear more conspicuously than in the care with which they sought to\r\navoid the danger to our institutions which must necessarily result from\r\nthe interference of the Federal Government with the local concerns\r\nof the States. The jarring and collision which would occur from the\r\nexercise by two separate governments of jurisdiction over the same\r\nsubjects could not fail to produce disastrous consequences. Besides,\r\nthe corrupting and seducing money influence exerted by the General\r\nGovernment in carrying into effect a system of internal improvements\r\nmight be perverted to increase and consolidate its own power to the\r\ndetriment of the rights of the States.\r\n\r\nIf the power existed in Congress to pass the present bill, then taxes\r\nmust be imposed and money borrowed to an unlimited extent to carry such\r\na system into execution. Equality among the States is equity. This\r\nequality is the very essence of the Constitution. No preference can\r\njustly be given to one of the sovereign States over another. According\r\nto the best estimate, our immense coast on the Atlantic, the Gulf of\r\nMexico, the Pacific, and the Ivakes embraces more than 9,500 miles,\r\nand, measuring by its indentations and to the head of tide water on\r\nthe rivers, the distance is believed to be more than 33,000 miles.\r\nThis everywhere throughout its vast extent contains numerous rivers\r\nand harbors, all of which may become the objects of Congressional\r\nappropriation. You can not deny to one State what you have granted to\r\nanother. Such injustice would produce strife, jealousy, and alarming\r\ndissensions among them. Even within the same State improvements may be\r\nmade in one river or harbor which would essentially injure the commerce\r\nand industry of another river or harbor. The truth is that most of these\r\nimprovements are in a great degree local in their character and for\r\nthe especial benefit of corporations or individuals in their vicinity,\r\nthough they may have an odor of nationality on the principle that\r\nwhatever benefits any part indirectly benefits the whole.\r\n\r\nFrom our past history we may have a small foretaste of the cost of\r\nreviving the system of internal improvements.\r\n\r\nFor more than thirty years after the adoption of the Federal\r\nConstitution the power to appropriate money for the construction of\r\ninternal improvements was neither claimed nor exercised by Congress.\r\nAfter its commencement, in 1820 and 1821, by very small and modest\r\nappropriations for surveys, it advanced with such rapid strides that\r\nwithin the brief period of ten years, according to President Polk, \"the\r\nsum asked for from the Treasury for various projects amounted to more\r\nthan $200,000,000.\" The vetoes of General Jackson and several of his\r\nsuccessors have impeded the progress of the system and limited its\r\nextent, but have not altogether destroyed it. The time has now arrived\r\nfor a final decision of the question. If the power exists, a general\r\nsystem should be adopted which would make some approach to justice\r\namong all the States, if this be possible.\r\n\r\nWhat a vast field would the exercise of this power open for jobbing and\r\ncorruption! Members of Congress, from an honest desire to promote the\r\ninterest of their constituents, would struggle for improvements within\r\ntheir own districts, and the body itself must necessarily be converted\r\ninto an arena where each would endeavor to obtain from the Treasury as\r\nmuch money as possible for his own locality. The temptation would prove\r\nirresistible. A system of \"_logrolling_\" (I know no word so expressive)\r\nwould be inaugurated, under which the Treasury would be exhausted and\r\nthe Federal Government be deprived of the means necessary to execute\r\nthose great powers clearly confided to it by the Constitution for the\r\npurpose of promoting the interests and vindicating the honor of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nWhilst the power over internal improvements, it is believed, was\r\n\"reserved to the States respectively,\" the framers of the Constitution\r\nwere not unmindful that it might be proper for the State legislatures to\r\npossess the power to impose tonnage duties for the improvement of rivers\r\nand harbors within their limits. The self-interest of the different\r\nlocalities would prevent this from being done to such an extent as to\r\ninjure their trade. The Constitution, therefore, which had in a previous\r\nclause provided that all duties should be uniform throughout the United\r\nStates, subsequently modified the general rule so far as to declare\r\nthat \"no State shall without the consent of Congress levy any duty of\r\ntonnage.\" The inference is therefore irresistible that with the consent\r\nof Congress such a duty may be imposed by the States. Thus those\r\ndirectly interested in the improvement may lay a tonnage duty for its\r\nconstruction without imposing a tax for this purpose upon all the people\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nTo this provision several of the States resorted until the period when\r\nthey began to look to the Federal Treasury instead of depending upon\r\ntheir own exertions. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, with\r\nthe consent of Congress, imposed small tonnage duties on vessels at\r\ndifferent periods for clearing and deepening the channels of rivers\r\nand improving harbors where such vessels entered. The last of these\r\nlegislative acts believed to exist is that of Virginia, passed on the\r\n22d February, 1826, levying a tonnage duty on vessels for \"improving\r\nthe navigation of James River from Warwick to Rocketts Landing.\" The\r\nlatest act of Congress on this subject was passed on the 24th of\r\nFebruary, 1843, giving its consent to the law of the legislature of\r\nMaryland laying a tonnage duty on vessels for the improvement of the\r\nharbor of Baltimore, and continuing it in force until 1st June, 1850.\r\n\r\nThus a clear constitutional mode exists by which the legislature of\r\nMichigan may, in its discretion, raise money to preserve the channel\r\nof the St. Clair River at its present depth or to render it deeper.\r\nA very insignificant tonnage duty on American vessels using this channel\r\nwould be sufficient for the purpose; and as the St. Clair River is\r\nthe boundary line between the United States and the Province of Upper\r\nCanada, the provincial British authorities would doubtless be willing\r\nto impose a similar tonnage duty on British vessels to aid in the\r\naccomplishment of this object. Indeed, the legislature of that Province\r\nhave already evinced their interest on this subject by having but\r\nrecently expended $20,000 on the improvement of the St. Clair flats.\r\nEven if the Constitution of the United States had conferred upon\r\nCongress the power of deepening the channel of the St. Clair River,\r\nit would be unjust to impose upon the people of the United States the\r\nentire burden, which ought to be borne jointly by the two parties having\r\nan equal interest in the work. Whenever the State of Michigan shall\r\ncease to depend on the Treasury of the United States, I doubt not that\r\nshe, in conjunction with Upper Canada, will provide the necessary means\r\nfor keeping this work in repair in the least expensive and most\r\neffective manner and without being burdensome to any interest.\r\n\r\nIt has been contended in favor of the existence of the power to\r\nconstruct internal improvements that Congress have from the beginning\r\nmade appropriations for light-houses, and that upon the same principle\r\nof construction they possess the power of improving harbors and\r\ndeepening the channels of rivers. As an original question the authority\r\nto erect light-houses under the commercial power might be considered\r\ndoubtful; but even were it more doubtful than it is I should regard\r\nit as settled after an uninterrupted exercise of the power for\r\nseventy years. Such a long and uniform practical construction of\r\nthe Constitution is entitled to the highest respect, and has finally\r\ndetermined the question.\r\n\r\nAmong the first acts which passed Congress after the Federal\r\n\r\nGovernment went into effect was that of August 7, 1789, providing \"for\r\nthe establishment and support of light-houses, beacons, buoys, and\r\npublic piers.\" Under this act the expenses for the maintenance of\r\nall such erections then in existence were to be paid by the Federal\r\nGovernment and provision was made for the cession of jurisdiction over\r\nthem by the respective States to the United States. In every case since\r\nbefore a light-house could be built a previous cession of jurisdiction\r\nhas been required. This practice doubtless originated from that clause\r\nof the Constitution authorizing Congress \"to exercise exclusive\r\nlegislation ... over all places purchased by the consent of the\r\nlegislature of the State in which the same shall be, for the erection of\r\nforts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other _needful buildings_.\"\r\nAmong these \"_needful buildings_\" light-houses must in fact have been\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nThe bare statement of these facts is sufficient to prove that no analogy\r\nexists between the power to erect a light-house as a \"needful building\"\r\nand that to deepen the channel of a river.\r\n\r\nIn what I have said I do not mean to intimate a doubt of the power of\r\nCongress to construct such internal improvements as may be essentially\r\nnecessary for defense and protection against the invasion of a foreign\r\nenemy. The power to declare war and, the obligation to protect each\r\nState against invasion clearly cover such cases. It will scarcely be\r\nclaimed, however, that the improvement of the St. Clair River is within\r\nthis category. This river is the boundary line between the United States\r\nand the British Province of Upper Canada. Any improvement of its\r\nnavigation, therefore, which we could make for purposes of war would\r\nequally inure to the benefit of Great Britain, the only enemy which\r\ncould possibly confront us in that quarter. War would be a sad calamity\r\nfor both nations, but should it ever, unhappily, exist, the battles will\r\nnot be fought on the St. Clair River or on the lakes with which it\r\ncommunicates.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 6, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nOn the last day of the last session of Congress a resolution, which\r\nhad passed both Houses, \"in relation to removal of obstructions to\r\nnavigation in the mouth of the Mississippi River\" was presented to me\r\nfor approval. I have retained this resolution because it was presented\r\nto me at a period when it was impossible to give the subject that\r\nexamination to which it appeared to be entitled. I need not repeat the\r\nviews on this point presented in the introductory portion of my message\r\nto the Senate of the 2d [1st] instant.\r\n\r\nIn addition I would merely observe that although at different periods\r\nsums, amounting in the aggregate to $690,000, have been appropriated by\r\nCongress for the purpose of removing the bar and obstructions at the\r\nmouth of the Mississippi, yet it is now acknowledged that this money\r\nhas been expended with but little, if any, practical benefit to its\r\nnavigation.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _April 17, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return with my objections to the Senate, for their reconsideration,\r\nthe bill entitled \"An act for the relief of Arthur Edwards and his\r\nassociates,\" presented to me on the 10th instant.\r\n\r\nThis bill directs the Postmaster-General \"to audit and settle the\r\naccounts of Arthur Edwards and his associates for transporting the\r\nUnited States through mail on their steamers during the years 1849 and\r\n1853 and intervening years\" between Cleveland and Detroit, between\r\nSandusky and Detroit, and between Toledo and Detroit, and \"to allow\r\nand pay them not less than $28.60 for each and every passage of said\r\nsteamers between said places during the aforementioned time when the\r\nmails were on board.\"\r\n\r\nI have caused a statement to be made at the Post-Office Department of\r\nthe least sum which can be paid to Mr. Edwards and his associates under\r\nthe bill should it become a law, and from this it appears the amount\r\nwill be $80,405.23.\r\n\r\nMr. Edwards and his associates, in 1854, a short time after the alleged\r\nservices had been rendered, presented a claim to the Postmaster-General\r\nfor $25,180 as compensation for these services. This claim consisted of\r\nnine items, setting forth specifically all the services embraced by the\r\npresent bill. It is fair to presume that the parties best knew the value\r\nof their own services and that they would not by an underestimate do\r\nthemselves injustice. The whole claim of $25,180 was rejected by the\r\nPostmaster-General for reasons which it is no part of my present purpose\r\nto discuss.\r\n\r\nThe claimants next presented a petition to the Court of Claims in June,\r\n1855, \"for a reasonable compensation\" for these services, and \"pray the\r\njudgment of your honorable court for the actual value of the service\r\nrendered by them and received by the United States, which amounts to the\r\nsum of $50,000.\" Thus the estimate which they placed upon their services\r\nhad nearly doubled between 1854 and 1855--had risen from $25,180 to\r\n$50,000. On the ------, after a full hearing, the court decided against\r\nthe claim, and delivered an opinion in support of this decision which\r\ncan not, I think, be contested on legal principles. But they state in\r\nthe conclusion of the opinion that \"for any compensation for their\r\nservices beyond what they have received they must depend upon the\r\ndiscretion of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThis decision of the Court of Claims was reported to Congress on the\r\n1st of April, 1858, and from it the present bill has originated. The\r\namount granted by it is more by upward of $55,000 than the parties\r\nthemselves demanded from the Postmaster-General in 1854, and is more by\r\nupward of $30,000 than they demanded when before the Court of Claims.\r\nThe enormous difference in their favor between their own original\r\ndemand and the amount granted by the present bill constitutes my chief\r\nobjection to it. In presenting this objection I do not propose to enter\r\ninto the question whether the claimants are entitled in equity to any\r\ncompensation for their services beyond that which it is alleged they\r\nhave already received, or, if so, what would be \"a reasonable and fair\r\ncompensation.\" My sole purpose is to afford Congress an opportunity\r\nof reconsidering this case on account of its peculiar circumstances.\r\nI transmit to the Senate the reports of Horatio King, Acting\r\nPostmaster-General, and of A.N. Zevely, Third Assistant\r\nPostmaster-General, both dated on the 14th of April, 1860, on the\r\nsubject of this claim.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 22, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return with my objections to the Senate, in which it originated, the\r\nbill entitled \"An act to secure homesteads to actual settlers on the\r\npublic domain, and for other purposes,\" presented to me on the 20th\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\nThis bill gives to every citizen of the United States \"who is the head\r\nof a family,\" and to every person of foreign birth residing in the\r\ncountry who has declared his intention to become a citizen, though he\r\nmay not be the head of a family, the privilege of appropriating to\r\nhimself 160 acres of Government land, of settling and residing upon it\r\nfor five years; and should his residence continue until the end of this\r\nperiod, he shall then receive a patent on the payment of 25 cents per\r\nacre, or one-fifth of the present Government price. During this period\r\nthe land is protected from all the debts of the settler.\r\n\r\nThis bill also contains a cession to the States of all the public lands\r\nwithin their respective limits \"which have been subject to sale at\r\nprivate entry, and which remain unsold after the lapse of thirty years.\"\r\nThis provision embraces a present donation to the States of 12,229,731\r\nacres, and will from time to time transfer to them large bodies of such\r\nlands which from peculiar circumstances may not be absorbed by private\r\npurchase and settlement.\r\n\r\nTo the actual settler this bill does not make an absolute donation,\r\nbut the price is so small that it can scarcely be called a sale. It is\r\nnominally 25 cents per acre, but considering this is not to be paid\r\nuntil the end of five years, it is in fact reduced to about 18 cents per\r\nacre, or one-seventh of the present minimum price of the public lands.\r\nIn regard to the States, it is an absolute and unqualified gift.\r\n\r\n1. This state of the facts raises the question whether Congress, under\r\nthe Constitution, has the power to give away the public lands either to\r\nStates or individuals. On this question I expressed a decided opinion\r\nin my message to the House of Representatives of the 24th February,\r\n1859, returning the agricultural-college bill. This opinion remains\r\nunchanged. The argument then used applies as a constitutional objection\r\nwith greater force to the present bill. _There_ it had the plea of\r\nconsideration, growing out of a specific beneficial purpose; _here_\r\nit is an absolute gratuity to the States, without the pretext of\r\nconsideration. I am compelled for want of time in these the last\r\nhours of the session to quote largely from this message.\r\n\r\nI presume the general proposition will be admitted that Congress does\r\nnot possess the power to make donations of money already in the\r\nTreasury, raised by taxes on the people, either to States or\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nBut it is contended that the public lands are placed upon a different\r\nfooting from money raised by taxation and that the proceeds arising from\r\ntheir sale are not subject to the limitations of the Constitution, but\r\nmay be appropriated or given away by Congress, at its own discretion,\r\nto States, corporations, or individuals for any purpose they may deem\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of this bill attempt to sustain their position upon the\r\nlanguage of the second clause of the third section of the fourth article\r\nof the Constitution, which declares that \"the Congress shall have power\r\nto dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting\r\nthe territory or other property belonging to the United States.\" They\r\ncontend that by a fair interpretation of the words \"dispose of\" in this\r\nclause Congress possesses the power to make this gift of public lands to\r\nthe States for purposes of education.\r\n\r\nIt would require clear and strong evidence to induce the belief that the\r\nframers of the Constitution, after having limited the powers of Congress\r\nto certain precise and specific objects, intended by employing the words\r\n\"dispose of\" to give that body unlimited power over the vast public\r\ndomain. It would be a strange anomaly indeed to have created two\r\nfunds--the one by taxation, confined to the execution of the enumerated\r\npowers delegated to Congress, and the other from the public lands,\r\napplicable to all subjects, foreign and domestic, which Congress might\r\ndesignate; that this fund should be \"disposed of,\" not to pay the debts\r\nof the United States, nor \"to raise and support armies,\" nor \"to provide\r\nand maintain a navy,\" nor to accomplish any one of the other great\r\nobjects enumerated in the Constitution, but be diverted from them to\r\npay the debts of the States, to educate their people, and to carry into\r\neffect any other measure of their domestic policy. This would be to\r\nconfer upon Congress a vast and irresponsible authority utterly at war\r\nwith the well-known jealousy of Federal power which prevailed at the\r\nformation of the Constitution. The natural intendment would be that\r\nas the Constitution confined Congress to well-defined specific powers,\r\nthe funds placed at their command, whether in land or money, should be\r\nappropriated to the performance of the duties corresponding with these\r\npowers. If not, a Government has been created with all its other powers\r\ncarefully limited, but without any limitation in respect to the public\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nBut I can not so read the words \"dispose of\" as to make them embrace\r\nthe idea of \"giving away.\" The true meaning of words is always to be\r\nascertained by the subject to which they are applied and the known\r\ngeneral intent of the lawgiver. Congress is a trustee under the\r\nConstitution for the people of the United States to \"dispose of\" their\r\npublic lands, and I think I may venture to assert with confidence that\r\nno case can be found in which a trustee in the position of Congress has\r\nbeen authorized to \"_dispose of_\" property by its owner where it has\r\nbeen held that these words authorized such trustee to give away the\r\nfund intrusted to his care. No trustee, when called upon to account for\r\nthe disposition of the property placed under his management before any\r\njudicial tribunal, would venture to present such a plea in his defense.\r\nThe true meaning of these words is clearly stated by Chief Justice Taney\r\nin delivering the opinion of the court (19 Howard, p. 436). He says in\r\nreference to this clause of the Constitution: \"It begins its enumeration\r\nof powers by that of disposing; in other words, making sale of the lands\r\nor raising money from them, which, as we have already said, was the main\r\nobject of the cession (from the States), and which is the first thing\r\nprovided for in the article.\" It is unnecessary to refer to the history\r\nof the times to establish the known fact that this statement of the\r\nChief Justice is perfectly well founded. That it never was intended by\r\nthe framers of the Constitution that these lands should be given away\r\nby Congress is manifest from the concluding portion of the same clause.\r\nBy it Congress has power not only \"to dispose of\" the territory, but of\r\nthe \"other property of the United States.\" In the language of the Chief\r\nJustice (p. 437): \"And the same power of making needful rules respecting\r\nthe territory is in precisely the same language applied to the other\r\nproperty of the United States, associating the power over the territory\r\nin this respect with the power over movable or personal property; that\r\nis, the ships, arms, or munitions of war, which then belonged in common\r\nto the State sovereignties.\"\r\n\r\nThe question is still clearer in regard to the public lands in the\r\nStates and Territories within the Louisiana and Florida purchases. These\r\nlands were paid for out of the public Treasury from money raised by\r\ntaxation. Now if Congress had no power to appropriate the money with\r\nwhich these lands were purchased, is it not clear that the power over\r\nthe lands is equally limited? The mere conversion of this money into\r\nland could not confer upon Congress new power over the disposition\r\nof land which they had not possessed over money. If it could, then a\r\ntrustee, by changing the character of the fund intrusted to his care for\r\nspecial objects from money into land, might give the land away or devote\r\nit to any purpose he thought proper, however foreign from the trust.\r\nThe inference is irresistible that this land partakes of the very same\r\ncharacter with the money paid for it, and can be devoted to no objects\r\ndifferent from those to which the money could have been devoted. If\r\nthis were not the case, then by the purchase of a new territory from a\r\nforeign government out of the public Treasury Congress could enlarge\r\ntheir own powers and appropriate the proceeds of the sales of the land\r\nthus purchased, at their own discretion, to other and far different\r\nobjects from what they could have applied the purchase money which had\r\nbeen raised by taxation.\r\n\r\n2. It will prove unequal and unjust in its operation among the actual\r\nsettlers themselves.\r\n\r\nThe first settlers of a new country are a most meritorious class. They\r\nbrave the dangers of savage warfare, suffer the privations of a frontier\r\nlife, and with the hand of toil bring the wilderness into cultivation.\r\nThe \"old settlers,\" as they are everywhere called, are public\r\nbenefactors. This class have all paid for their lands the Government\r\nprice, or $1.25 per acre. They have constructed roads, established\r\nschools, and laid the foundation of prosperous commonwealths. Is it\r\njust, is it equal, that after they have accomplished all this by their\r\nlabor new settlers should come in among them and receive their farms at\r\nthe price of 25 or 18 cents per acre? Surely the old settlers, as a\r\nclass, are entitled to at least equal benefits with the new. If you give\r\nthe new settlers their land for a comparatively nominal price, upon\r\nevery principle of equality and justice you will be obliged to refund\r\nout of the common Treasury the difference which the old have paid above\r\nthe new settlers for their land.\r\n\r\n3. This bill will do great injustice to the old soldiers who have\r\nreceived land warrants for their services in fighting the battles of\r\ntheir country. It will greatly reduce the market value of these\r\nwarrants. Already their value has sunk for 160-acre warrants to 67 cents\r\nper acre under an apprehension that such a measure as this might become\r\na law. What price would they command when any head of a family may take\r\npossession of a quarter section of land and not pay for it until the end\r\nof five years, and then at the rate of only 25 cents per acre? The\r\nmagnitude of the interest to be affected will appear in the fact that\r\nthere are outstanding unsatisfied land warrants reaching back to the\r\nlast war with Great Britain, and even Revolutionary times, amounting\r\nin round numbers to seven and a half millions of acres.\r\n\r\n4. This bill will prove unequal and unjust in its operation, because\r\nfrom its nature it is confined to one class of our people. It is a boon\r\nexclusively conferred upon the cultivators of the soil. Whilst it is\r\ncheerfully admitted that these are the most numerous and useful class\r\nof our fellow-citizens and eminently deserve all the advantages which\r\nour laws have already extended to them, yet there should be no new\r\nlegislation which would operate to the injury or embarrassment of the\r\nlarge body of respectable artisans and laborers. The mechanic who\r\nemigrates to the West and pursues his calling must labor long before\r\nhe can purchase a quarter section of land, whilst the tiller of the\r\nsoil who accompanies him obtains a farm at once by the bounty of the\r\nGovernment. The numerous body of mechanics in our large cities can not,\r\neven by emigrating to the West, take advantage of the provisions of this\r\nbill without entering upon a new occupation for which their habits of\r\nlife have rendered them unfit.\r\n\r\n5. This bill is unjust to the old States of the Union in many respects;\r\nand amongst these States, so far as the public lands are concerned, we\r\nmay enumerate every State east of the Mississippi with the exception of\r\nWisconsin and a portion of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nIt is a common belief within their limits that the older States of the\r\nConfederacy do not derive their proportionate benefit from the public\r\nlands. This is not a just opinion. It is doubtful whether they could be\r\nrendered more beneficial to these States under any other system than\r\nthat which at present exists. Their proceeds go into the common Treasury\r\nto accomplish the objects of the Government, and in this manner all\r\nthe States are benefited in just proportion. But to give this common\r\ninheritance away would deprive the old States of their just proportion\r\nof this revenue without holding out any the least corresponding\r\nadvantage. Whilst it is our common glory that the new States have become\r\nso prosperous and populous, there is no good reason why the old States\r\nshould offer premiums to their own citizens to emigrate from them to the\r\nWest. That land of promise presents in itself sufficient allurements to\r\nour young and enterprising citizens without any adventitious aid. The\r\noffer of free farms would probably have a powerful effect in encouraging\r\nemigration, especially from States like Illinois, Tennessee, and\r\nKentucky, to the west of the Mississippi, and could not fail to reduce\r\nthe price of property within their limits. An individual in States thus\r\nsituated would not pay its fair value for land when by crossing the\r\nMississippi he could go upon the public lands and obtain a farm almost\r\nwithout money and without price.\r\n\r\n6. This bill will open one vast field for speculation. Men will not pay\r\n$1.25 for lands when they can purchase them for one-fifth of that price.\r\nLarge numbers of actual settlers will be carried out by capitalists upon\r\nagreements to give them half of the land for the improvement of the\r\nother half. This can not be avoided. Secret agreements of this kind will\r\nbe numerous. In the entry of graduated lands the experience of the Land\r\nOffice justifies this objection.\r\n\r\n7. We ought ever to maintain the most perfect equality between native\r\nand naturalized citizens. They are equal, and ought always to remain\r\nequal, before the laws. Our laws welcome foreigners to our shores, and\r\ntheir rights will ever be respected. Whilst these are the sentiments on\r\nwhich I have acted through life, it is not, in my opinion, expedient to\r\nproclaim to all the nations of the earth that whoever shall arrive in\r\nthis country from a foreign shore and declare his intention to become a\r\ncitizen shall receive a farm of 160 acres at a cost of 25 or 20 cents\r\nper acre if he will only reside on it and cultivate it. The invitation\r\nextends to all, and if this bill becomes a law we may have numerous\r\nactual settlers from China and other Eastern nations enjoying its\r\nbenefits on the great Pacific Slope. The bill makes a distinction in\r\nfavor of such persons over native and naturalized citizens. When applied\r\nto such citizens, it is confined to such as are the heads of families,\r\nbut when applicable to persons of foreign birth recently arrived on our\r\nshores there is no such restriction. Such persons need not be the heads\r\nof families provided they have filed a declaration of intention to\r\nbecome citizens. Perhaps this distinction was an inadvertence, but\r\nit is, nevertheless, a part of the bill.\r\n\r\n8. The bill creates an unjust distinction between persons claiming the\r\nbenefit of the preemption laws. Whilst it reduces the price of the land\r\nto existing preemptors to 62-1/2 cents per acre and gives them a credit\r\non this sum for two years from the present date, no matter how long they\r\nmay have hitherto enjoyed the land, future preemptors will be compelled\r\nto pay double this price per acre. There is no reason or justice in this\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\n9. The effect of this bill on the public revenue must be apparent to\r\nall. Should it become a law, the reduction of the price of land to\r\nactual settlers to 25 cents per acre, with a credit of five years, and\r\nthe reduction of its price to existing preemptors to 62-1/2 cents per\r\nacre, with a credit of two years, will so diminish the sale of other\r\npublic lands as to render the expectation of future revenue from that\r\nsource, beyond the expenses of survey and management, illusory. The\r\nSecretary of the Interior estimated the revenue from the public lands\r\nfor the next fiscal year at $4,000,000, on the presumption that the\r\npresent land system would remain unchanged. Should this bill become\r\na law, he does not believe that $1,000,000 will be derived from this\r\nsource.\r\n\r\n10. This bill lays the ax at the root of our present admirable land\r\nsystem. The public land is an inheritance of vast value to us and to\r\nour descendants. It is a resource to which we can resort in the hour of\r\ndifficulty and danger. It has been managed heretofore with the greatest\r\nwisdom under existing laws. In this management the rights of actual\r\nsettlers have been conciliated with the interests of the Government. The\r\nprice to all has been reduced from $2 per acre to $1.25 for fresh lands,\r\nand the claims of actual settlers have been secured by our preemption\r\nlaws. Any man can now acquire a title in fee simple to a homestead of\r\n80 acres, at the minimum price of $1.25 per acre, for $100. Should the\r\npresent system remain, we shall derive a revenue from the public lands\r\nof $10,000,000 per annum, when the bounty-land warrants are satisfied,\r\nwithout oppression to any human being. In time of war, when all other\r\nsources of revenue are seriously impaired, this will remain intact.\r\nIt may become the best security for public loans hereafter, in times\r\nof difficulty and danger, as it has been heretofore. Why should we\r\nimpair or destroy the system at the present moment? What necessity\r\nexists for it?\r\n\r\nThe people of the United States have advanced with steady but rapid\r\nstrides to their present condition of power and prosperity. They have\r\nbeen guided in their progress by the fixed principle of protecting the\r\nequal rights of all, whether they be rich or poor. No agrarian sentiment\r\nhas ever prevailed among them. The honest poor man, by frugality and\r\nindustry, can in any part of our country acquire a competence for\r\nhimself and his family, and in doing this he feels that he eats the\r\nbread of independence. He desires no charity, either from the Government\r\nor from his neighbors. This bill, which proposes to give him land at an\r\nalmost nominal price out of the property of the Government, will go far\r\nto demoralize the people and repress this noble spirit of independence.\r\nIt may introduce among us those pernicious social theories which have\r\nproved so disastrous in other countries.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 28, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAfter a delay which has afforded me ample time for reflection, and after\r\nmuch and careful deliberation, I find myself constrained by an imperious\r\nsense of duty, as a coordinate branch of the Federal Government, to\r\nprotest against the first two clauses of the first resolution adopted\r\nby the House of Representatives on the 5th instant, and published in the\r\nCongressional Globe on the succeeding day. These clauses are in the\r\nfollowing words:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That a committee of five members be appointed by the Speaker\r\n  for the purpose, first, of investigating whether the President of the\r\n  United States or any other officer of the Government has, by money,\r\n  patronage, or other improper means, sought to influence the action of\r\n  Congress or any committee thereof for or against the passage of any law\r\n  appertaining to the rights of any State or Territory; and, second, also\r\n  to inquire into and investigate whether any officer or officers of the\r\n  Government have, by combination or otherwise, prevented or defeated, or\r\n  attempted to prevent or defeat, the execution of any law or laws now\r\n  upon the statute book, and whether the President has failed or refused\r\n  to compel the execution of any law thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\nI confine myself exclusively to these two branches of the resolution,\r\nbecause the portions of it which follow relate to alleged abuses in\r\npost-offices, navy-yards, public buildings, and other public works\r\nof the United States. In such cases inquiries are highly proper in\r\nthemselves and belong equally to the Senate and the House, as incident\r\nto their legislative duties and being necessary to enable them to\r\ndiscover and to provide the appropriate legislative remedies for any\r\nabuses which may be ascertained. Although the terms of the latter\r\nportion of the resolution are extremely vague and general, yet my sole\r\npurpose in adverting to them at present is to mark the broad line of\r\ndistinction between the accusatory and the remedial clauses of this\r\nresolution. The House of Representatives possess no power under the\r\nConstitution over the first or accusatory portion of the resolution\r\nexcept as an impeaching body, whilst over the last, in common with the\r\nSenate, their authority as a legislative body is fully and cheerfully\r\nadmitted.\r\n\r\nIt is solely in reference to the first or impeaching power that I\r\npropose to make a few observations. Except in this single case, the\r\nConstitution has invested the House of Representatives with no power,\r\nno jurisdiction, no supremacy whatever over the President. In all other\r\nrespects he is quite as independent of them as they are of him. As a\r\ncoordinate branch of the Government he is their equal. Indeed, he is the\r\nonly direct representative on earth of the people of all and each of the\r\nsovereign States. To them, and to them alone, is he responsible whilst\r\nacting within the sphere of his constitutional duty, and not in any\r\nmanner to the House of Representatives. The people have thought proper\r\nto invest him with the most honorable, responsible, and dignified office\r\nin the world, and the individual, however unworthy, now holding this\r\nexalted position, will take care, so far as in him lies, that their\r\nrights and prerogatives shall never be violated in his person, but\r\nshall pass to his successors unimpaired by the adoption of a dangerous\r\nprecedent. He will defend them to the last extremity against any\r\nunconstitutional attempt, come from what quarter it may, to abridge\r\nthe constitutional rights of the Executive and render him subservient\r\nto any human power except themselves.\r\n\r\nThe people have not confined the President to the exercise of executive\r\nduties. They have also conferred upon him a large measure of legislative\r\ndiscretion. No bill can become a law without his approval, as\r\nrepresenting the people of the United States, unless it shall pass after\r\nhis veto by a majority of two-thirds of both Houses. In his legislative\r\ncapacity he might, in common with the Senate and the House, institute an\r\ninquiry to ascertain any facts which ought to influence his judgment in\r\napproving or vetoing any bill.\r\n\r\nThis participation in the performance of legislative duties between the\r\ncoordinate branches of the Government ought to inspire the conduct of\r\nall of them in their relations toward each other with mutual forbearance\r\nand respect. At least each has a right to demand justice from the other.\r\nThe cause of complaint is that the constitutional rights and immunities\r\nof the Executive have been violated in the person of the President.\r\n\r\nThe trial of an impeachment of the President before the Senate\r\non charges preferred and prosecuted against him by the House of\r\nRepresentatives would be an imposing spectacle for the world. In\r\nthe result not only his removal from the Presidential office would be\r\ninvolved, but, what is of infinitely greater importance to himself, his\r\ncharacter, both in the eyes of the present and of future generations,\r\nmight possibly be tarnished. The disgrace cast upon him would in some\r\ndegree be reflected upon the character of the American people, who\r\nelected him. Hence the precautions adopted by the Constitution to\r\nsecure a fair trial. On such a trial it declares that \"the Chief\r\nJustice shall preside.\" This was doubtless because the framers of\r\nthe Constitution believed it to be possible that the Vice-President\r\nmight be biased by the fact that \"in case of the removal of the\r\nPresident from office ... the same shall devolve on the Vice-President.\"\r\n\r\nThe preliminary proceedings in the House in the case of charges which\r\nmay involve impeachment have been well and wisely settled by long\r\npractice upon principles of equal justice both to the accused and to\r\nthe people. The precedent established in the case of Judge Peck, of\r\nMissouri, in 1831, after a careful review of all former precedents,\r\nwill, I venture to predict, stand the test of time.\r\n\r\nIn that case Luke Edward Lawless, the accuser, presented a petition to\r\nthe House, in which he set forth minutely and specifically his causes of\r\ncomplaint. He prayed \"that the conduct and proceedings in this behalf of\r\nsaid Judge Peck may be inquired into by your honorable body, and such\r\ndecision made thereon as to your wisdom and justice shall seem proper.\"\r\nThis petition was referred to the Judiciary Committee; such has ever\r\nbeen deemed the appropriate committee to make similar investigations.\r\nIt is a standing committee, supposed to be appointed without reference\r\nto any special case, and at all times is presumed to be composed of\r\nthe most eminent lawyers in the House from different portions of the\r\nUnion, whose acquaintance with judicial proceedings and whose habits of\r\ninvestigation qualify them peculiarly for the task. No tribunal, from\r\ntheir position and character, could in the nature of things be more\r\nimpartial. In the case of Judge Peck the witnesses were selected by the\r\ncommittee itself, with a view to ascertain the truth of the charge.\r\nThey were cross-examined by him, and everything was conducted in such\r\na manner as to afford him no reasonable cause of complaint. In view of\r\nthis precedent, and, what is of far greater importance, in view of the\r\nConstitution and the principles of eternal justice, in what manner\r\nhas the President of the United States been treated by the House of\r\nRepresentatives? Mr. John Covode, a Representative from Pennsylvania, is\r\nthe accuser of the President. Instead of following the wise precedents\r\nof former times, and especially that in the case of Judge Peck, and\r\nreferring the accusation to the Committee on the Judiciary, the House\r\nhave made my accuser one of my judges.\r\n\r\nTo make the accuser the judge is a violation of the principles of\r\nuniversal justice, and is condemned by the practice of all civilized\r\nnations. Every freeman must revolt at such a spectacle. I am to\r\nappear before Mr. Covode, either personally or by a substitute, to\r\ncross-examine the witnesses which he may produce before himself to\r\nsustain his own accusations against me; and perhaps even this poor\r\nboon may be denied to the President.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the nature of the investigation which his resolution\r\nproposes to institute? It is as vague and general as the English\r\nlanguage affords words in which to make it. The committee is to inquire,\r\nnot into any specific charge or charges, but whether the President has,\r\nby \"money, patronage, or other improper means, sought to influence,\"\r\nnot the action of any individual member or members of Congress, but\r\n\"the action\" of the entire body \"of Congress\" itself \"or any committee\r\nthereof.\" The President might have had some glimmering of the nature of\r\nthe offense to be investigated had his accuser pointed to the act or\r\nacts of Congress which he sought to pass or to defeat by the employment\r\nof \"money, patronage, or other improper means.\" But the accusation\r\nis bounded by no such limits. It extends to the whole circle of\r\nlegislation--to interference \"for or against the passage of any law\r\nappertaining to the rights of any State or Territory.\" And what law does\r\nnot appertain to the rights of some State or Territory? And what law or\r\nlaws has the President failed to execute? These might easily have been\r\npointed out had any such existed.\r\n\r\nHad Mr. Lawless asked an inquiry to be made by the House whether Judge\r\nPeck, in general terms, had not violated his judicial duties, without\r\nthe specification of any particular act, I do not believe there would\r\nhave been a single vote in that body in favor of the inquiry.\r\n\r\nSince the time of the star-chamber and of general warrants there has\r\nbeen no such proceeding in England.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives, the high impeaching power of the country,\r\nwithout consenting to hear a word of explanation, have indorsed this\r\naccusation against the President and made it their own act. They even\r\nrefused to permit a Member to inquire of the President's accuser what\r\nwere the specific charges against him. Thus, in this preliminary\r\naccusation of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" against a coordinate branch\r\nof the Government, under the impeaching power, the House refused to hear\r\na single suggestion, even in regard to the correct mode of proceeding,\r\nbut without a moment's delay passed the accusatory resolutions under\r\nthe pressure of the previous question.\r\n\r\nIn the institution of a prosecution for any offense against the most\r\nhumble citizen--and I claim for myself no greater rights than he\r\nenjoys--the constitutions of the United States and of the several States\r\nrequire that he shall be informed in the very beginning of the nature\r\nand cause of the accusation against him, in order to enable him to\r\nprepare for his defense. There are other principles which I might\r\nenumerate, not less sacred, presenting an impenetrable shield to protect\r\nevery citizen falsely charged with a criminal offense. These have been\r\nviolated in the prosecution instituted by the House of Representatives\r\nagainst the executive branch of the Government. Shall the President\r\nalone be deprived of the protection of these great principles which\r\nprevail in every land where a ray of liberty penetrates the gloom of\r\ndespotism? Shall the Executive alone be deprived of rights which all\r\nhis fellow-citizens enjoy? The whole proceeding against him justifies\r\nthe fears of those wise and great men who, before the Constitution was\r\nadopted by the States, apprehended that the tendency of the Government\r\nwas to the aggrandizement of the legislative at the expense of the\r\nexecutive and judicial departments.\r\n\r\nI again declare emphatically that I make this protest for no reason\r\npersonal to myself, and I do it with perfect respect for the House of\r\nRepresentatives, in which I had the honor of serving as a member for\r\nfive successive terms. I have lived long in this goodly land, and have\r\nenjoyed all the offices and honors which my country could bestow. Amid\r\nall the political storms through which I have passed, the present is the\r\nfirst attempt which has ever been made, to my knowledge, to assail my\r\npersonal or official integrity; and this as the time is approaching\r\nwhen I shall voluntarily retire from the service of my country. I feel\r\nproudly conscious that there is no public act of my life which will not\r\nbear the strictest scrutiny. I defy all investigation. Nothing but the\r\nbasest perjury can sully my good name. I do not fear even this, because\r\nI cherish an humble confidence that the gracious Being who has hitherto\r\ndefended and protected me against the shafts of falsehood and malice\r\nwill not desert me now when I have become \"old and gray headed.\" I can\r\ndeclare before God and my country that no human being (with an exception\r\nscarcely worthy of notice) has at any period of my life dared to\r\napproach me with a corrupt or dishonorable proposition, and until recent\r\ndevelopments it had never entered into my imagination that any person,\r\neven in the storm of exasperated political excitement, would charge me\r\nin the most remote degree with having made such a proposition to any\r\nhuman being. I may now, however, exclaim in the language of complaint\r\nemployed by my first and greatest predecessor, that I have been abused\r\n\"in such exaggerated and indecent terms as could scarcely be applied\r\nto a Nero, to a notorious defaulter, or even to a common pickpocket.\"\r\n\r\nI do therefore, for the reasons stated and in the name of the people of\r\nthe several States, solemnly protest against these proceedings of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, because they are in violation of the rights of\r\nthe coordinate executive branch of the Government and subversive of its\r\nconstitutional independence; because they are calculated to foster a\r\nband of interested parasites and informers, ever ready, for their own\r\nadvantage, to swear before _ex parte_ committees to pretended private\r\nconversations between the President and themselves, incapable from their\r\nnature of being disproved, thus furnishing material for harassing him,\r\ndegrading him in the eyes of the country, and eventually, should he be a\r\nweak or a timid man, rendering him subservient to improper influences in\r\norder to avoid such persecutions and annoyances; because they tend to\r\ndestroy that harmonious action for the common good which ought to be\r\nmaintained, and which I sincerely desire to cherish, between coordinate\r\nbranches of the Government; and, finally, because, if unresisted, they\r\nwould establish a precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my\r\nsuccessors, to whatever political party they might be attached.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _June 22, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn my message to the House of Representatives of the 28th March last I\r\nsolemnly protested against the creation of a committee, at the head of\r\nwhich was placed my accuser, for the purpose of investigating whether\r\nthe President had, \"by money, patronage, or other improper means, sought\r\nto influence the action of Congress or any committee thereof for or\r\nagainst the passage of any law appertaining to the rights of any State\r\nor Territory,\" I protested against this because it was destitute of any\r\nspecification; because it referred to no particular act to enable the\r\nPresident to prepare for his defense; because it deprived him of the\r\nconstitutional guards which, in common with every citizen of the United\r\nStates, he possesses for his protection, and because it assailed his\r\nconstitutional independence as a coordinate branch of the Government.\r\n\r\nThere is an enlightened justice, as well as a beautiful symmetry, in\r\nevery part of the Constitution. This is conspicuously manifested in\r\nregard to impeachments. The House of Representatives possesses \"the\r\nsole power of impeachment,\" the Senate \"the sole power to try all\r\nimpeachments;\" and the impeachable offenses are \"treason, bribery, or\r\nother high crimes or misdemeanors.\" The practice of the House from the\r\nearliest times had been in accordance with its own dignity, the rights\r\nof the accused, and the demands of justice. At the commencement of each\r\njudicial investigation which might lead to an impeachment specific\r\ncharges were always preferred; the accused had an opportunity of\r\ncross-examining the witnesses, and he was placed in full possession of\r\nthe precise nature of the offense which he had to meet. An impartial and\r\nelevated standing committee was charged with this investigation, upon\r\nwhich no member inspired with the ancient sense of honor and justice\r\nwould have served had he ever expressed an opinion against the accused.\r\nUntil the present occasion it was never deemed proper to transform the\r\naccuser into the judge and to confer upon him the selection of his own\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nThe charges made against me in vague and general terms were of such\r\na false and atrocious character that I did not entertain a moment's\r\napprehension for the result. They were abhorrent to every principle\r\ninstilled into me from my youth and every practice of my life, and I\r\ndid not believe it possible that the man existed who would so basely\r\nperjure himself as to swear to the truth of any such accusations. In\r\nthis conviction I am informed I have not been mistaken.\r\n\r\nIn my former protest, therefore, I truly and emphatically declared\r\nthat it was made for no reason personal to myself, but because the\r\nproceedings of the House were in violation of the rights of the\r\ncoordinate executive branch of the Government, subversive of its\r\nconstitutional independence, and if unresisted would establish\r\na precedent dangerous and embarrassing to all my successors.\r\nNotwithstanding all this, if the committee had not transcended\r\nthe authority conferred upon it by the resolution of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, broad and general as this was, I should have remained\r\nsilent upon the subject. What I now charge is that they have acted as\r\nthough they possessed unlimited power, and, without any warrant whatever\r\nin the resolution under which they were appointed, have pursued a course\r\nnot merely at war with the constitutional rights of the Executive, but\r\ntending to degrade the Presidential office itself to such a degree as to\r\nrender it unworthy of the acceptance of any man of honor or principle.\r\n\r\nThe resolution of the House, so far as it is accusatory of the\r\nPresident, is confined to an inquiry whether he had used corrupt or\r\nimproper means to influence the action of Congress or any of its\r\ncommittees on legislative measures pending before them--nothing more,\r\nnothing less. I have not learned through the newspapers or in any other\r\nmode that the committee have touched the other accusatory branch of the\r\nresolution, charging the President with a violation of duty in failing\r\nto execute some law or laws. This branch of the resolution is therefore\r\nout of the question. By what authority, then, have the committee\r\nundertaken to investigate the course of the President in regard to the\r\nconvention which framed the Lecompton constitution? By what authority\r\nhave they undertaken to pry into our foreign relations for the purpose\r\nof assailing him on account of the instructions given by the Secretary\r\nof State to our minister in Mexico relative to the Tehuantepec route?\r\nBy what authority have they inquired into the causes of removal from\r\noffice, and this from the parties themselves removed, with a view to\r\nprejudice his character, notwithstanding this power of removal belongs\r\nexclusively to the President under the Constitution, was so decided by\r\nthe First Congress in the year 1789, and has accordingly ever since been\r\nexercised? There is in the resolution no pretext of authority for the\r\ncommittee to investigate the question of the printing of the post-office\r\nblanks; nor is it to be supposed that the House, if asked, would have\r\ngranted such an authority, because this question had been previously\r\ncommitted to two other committees--one in the Senate and the other in\r\nthe House. Notwithstanding this absolute want of power, the committee\r\nrushed into this investigation in advance of all other subjects.\r\n\r\nThe committee proceeded for months, from March 22, 1860, to examine _ex\r\nparte_ and without any notice to myself into every subject which could\r\npossibly affect my character. Interested and vindictive witnesses were\r\nsummoned and examined before them; and the first and only information of\r\ntheir testimony which, in almost every instance, I received was obtained\r\nfrom the publication of such portions of it as could injuriously affect\r\nmyself in the New York journals. It mattered not that these statements\r\nwere, so far as I have learned, disproved by the most respectable\r\nwitnesses who happened to be on the spot. The telegraph was silent\r\nrespecting these contradictions. It was a secret committee in regard\r\nto the testimony in my defense, but it was public in regard to all the\r\ntestimony which could by possibility reflect on my character. The poison\r\nwas left to produce its effect upon the public mind, whilst the antidote\r\nwas carefully withheld.\r\n\r\nIn their examinations the committee violated the most sacred and\r\nhonorable confidences existing among men. Private correspondence,\r\nwhich a truly honorable man would never even entertain a distant thought\r\nof divulging, was dragged to light. Different persons in official and\r\nconfidential relations with myself, and with whom it was supposed I\r\nmight have held conversations the revelation of which would do me\r\ninjury, were examined. Even members of the Senate and members of my own\r\nCabinet, both my constitutional advisers, were called upon to testify,\r\nfor the purpose of discovering something, if possible, to my discredit.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the patronage of the Government is by far the most\r\ndisagreeable duty of the President. Applicants are so numerous and their\r\napplications are pressed with such eagerness by their friends, both in\r\nand out of Congress, that the selection of one for any desirable office\r\ngives offense to many. Disappointed applicants, removed officers, and\r\nthose who for any cause, real or imaginary, had become hostile to the\r\nAdministration presented themselves or were invited by a summons to\r\nappear before the committee. These are the most dangerous witnesses.\r\nEven with the best intentions they are so influenced by prejudice and\r\ndisappointment that they almost inevitably discolor truth. They swear to\r\ntheir own version of private conversations with the President without\r\nthe possibility of contradiction. His lips are sealed, and he is left\r\nat their mercy. He can not, as a coordinate branch of the Government,\r\nappear before a committee of investigation to contradict the oaths of\r\nsuch witnesses. Every coward knows that he can employ insulting language\r\nagainst the President with impunity, and every false or prejudiced\r\nwitness can attempt to swear away his character before such a committee\r\nwithout the fear of contradiction.\r\n\r\nThus for months, whilst doing my best at one end of the Avenue to\r\nperform my high and responsible duties to the country, has there been a\r\ncommittee of the House of Representatives in session at the other end of\r\nthe Avenue spreading a drag net, without the shadow of authority from\r\nthe House, over the whole Union, to catch any disappointed man willing\r\nto malign my character; and all this in secret conclave. The lion's\r\nmouth at Venice, into which secret denunciations were dropped, is an\r\napt illustration of the Covode committee. The star-chamber, tyrannical\r\nand odious as it was, never proceeded in such a manner. For centuries\r\nthere has been nothing like it in any civilized country, except the\r\nrevolutionary tribunal of France in the days of Robespierre. Now I\r\nundertake to state and to prove that should the proceedings of the\r\ncommittee be sanctioned by the House and become a precedent for future\r\ntimes the balance of the Constitution will be entirely upset, and there\r\nwill no longer remain the three coordinate and independent branches of\r\nthe Government--legislative, executive, and judicial. The worst fears of\r\nthe patriots and statesmen who framed the Constitution in regard to the\r\nusurpations of the legislative on the executive and judicial branches\r\nwill then be realized. In the language of Mr. Madison, speaking on this\r\nvery subject in the forty-eighth number of the Federalist:\r\n\r\n  In a representative republic, where the executive magistracy is\r\n  carefully limited, both in the extent and duration of its power, and\r\n  where the legislative power is exercised by an assembly which is\r\n  inspired, by a supposed influence over the people, with an intrepid\r\n  confidence in its own strength, which is sufficiently numerous to feel\r\n  all the passions which actuate a multitude, yet not so numerous as to\r\n  be incapable of pursuing the objects of its passions by means which\r\n  reason prescribes, it is against the enterprising ambition of this\r\n  department that the people ought to indulge all their jealousy and\r\n  exhaust all their precautions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in the expressive and pointed language of Mr. Jefferson, when\r\nspeaking of the tendency of the legislative branch of Government to\r\nusurp the rights of the weaker branches:\r\n\r\n  The concentrating these in the same hands is precisely the definition\r\n  of despotic government. It will be no alleviation that these powers\r\n  will be exercised by a plurality of hands, and not by a single one.\r\n  One hundred and seventy-three despots would surely be as oppressive\r\n  as one. Let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the Republic of\r\n  Venice. As little will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves.\r\n  An elective despotism was not the government we fought for, but one\r\n  which should not only be founded on free principles, but in which the\r\n  powers of government should be so divided and balanced among several\r\n  bodies of magistracy as that no one could transcend their legal limits\r\n  without being effectually checked and controlled by the others.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould the proceedings of the Covode committee become a precedent, both\r\nthe letter and spirit of the Constitution will be violated. One of the\r\nthree massive columns on which the whole superstructure rests will be\r\nbroken down. Instead of the Executive being a coordinate it will become\r\na subordinate branch of the Government. The Presidential office will\r\nbe dragged into the dust. The House of Representatives will then have\r\nrendered the Executive almost necessarily subservient to its wishes,\r\ninstead of being independent. How is it possible that two powers in the\r\nState can be coordinate and independent of each other if the one claims\r\nand exercises the power to reprove and to censure all the official acts\r\nand all the private conversations of the other, and this upon _ex parte_\r\ntestimony before a secret inquisitorial committee in short, to assume a\r\ngeneral censorship over the other? The idea is as absurd in public as\r\nit would be in private life. Should the President attempt to assert and\r\nmaintain his own independence, future Covode committees may dragoon him\r\ninto submission by collecting the hosts of disappointed office hunters,\r\nremoved officers, and those who desire to live upon the public Treasury,\r\nwhich must follow in the wake of every Administration, and they in\r\nsecret conclave will swear away his reputation. Under such circumstances\r\nhe must be a very bold man should he not surrender at discretion and\r\nconsent to exercise his authority according to the will of those\r\ninvested with this terrific power. The sovereign people of the several\r\nStates have elected him to the highest and most honorable office in\r\nthe world. He is their only direct representative in the Government.\r\nBy their Constitution they have made him Commander in Chief of their\r\nArmy and Navy. He represents them in their intercourse with foreign\r\nnations. Clothed with their dignity and authority, he occupies a proud\r\nposition before all nations, civilized and savage. With the consent of\r\nthe Senate, he appoints all the important officers of the Government.\r\nHe exercises the veto power, and to that extent controls the legislation\r\nof Congress. For the performance of these high duties he is responsible\r\nto the people of the several States, and not in any degree to the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\nShall he surrender these high powers, conferred upon him as the\r\nrepresentative of the American people for their benefit, to the House\r\nto be exercised under their overshadowing influence and control? Shall\r\nhe alone of all the citizens of the United States be denied a fair\r\ntrial? Shall he alone not be \"informed of the nature and cause of the\r\naccusation\" against him? Shall he alone not \"be confronted with the\r\nwitnesses\" against him? Shall the House of Representatives, usurping the\r\npowers of the Senate, proceed to try the President through the agency of\r\na secret committee of the body, where it is impossible he can make any\r\ndefense, and then, without affording him an opportunity of being heard,\r\npronounce a judgment of censure against him? The very same rule might\r\nbe applied for the very same reason to every judge of every court of\r\nthe United States. From what part of the Constitution is this terrible\r\nsecret inquisitorial power derived? No such express power exists.\r\nFrom which of the enumerated powers can it be inferred? It is true the\r\nHouse can not pronounce the formal judgment against him of \"removal\r\nfrom office,\" but they can by their judgment of censure asperse his\r\nreputation, and thus to the extent of their influence render the office\r\ncontemptible. An example is at hand of the reckless manner in which this\r\npower of censure can be employed in high party times. The House on a\r\nrecent occasion have attempted to degrade the President by adopting the\r\nresolution of Mr. John Sherman declaring that he, in conjunction with\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy, \"by receiving and considering the party\r\nrelations of bidders for contracts and the effect of awarding contracts\r\nupon pending elections, have set an example dangerous to the public\r\nsafety and deserving the reproof of this House.\"\r\n\r\nIt will scarcely be credited that the sole pretext for this vote of\r\ncensure was the simple fact that in disposing of the numerous letters\r\nof every imaginable character which I daily receive I had in the usual\r\ncourse of business referred a letter from Colonel Patterson, of\r\nPhiladelphia, in relation to a contract, to the attention of the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, the head of the appropriate Department, without\r\nexpressing or intimating any opinion whatever on the subject; and to\r\nmake the matter if possible still plainer, the Secretary had informed\r\nthe committee that \"_the President did not in any manner interfere in\r\nthis case, nor has he in any other case of contract since I have been\r\nin the Department_.\" The absence of all proof to sustain this attempt\r\nto degrade the President, whilst it manifests the venom of the shaft\r\naimed at him, has destroyed the vigor of the bow.\r\n\r\nTo return after this digression: Should the House, by the institution\r\nof Covode committees, votes of censure, and other devices to harass the\r\nPresident, reduce him to subservience to their will and render him their\r\ncreature, then the well-balanced Government which our fathers framed\r\nwill be annihilated. This conflict has already been commenced in earnest\r\nby the House against the Executive. A bad precedent rarely, if ever,\r\ndies. It will, I fear, be pursued in the time of my successors, no\r\nmatter what may be their political character. Should secret committees\r\nbe appointed with unlimited authority to range over all the words and\r\nactions, and, if possible, the very thoughts, of the President with a\r\nview to discover something in his past life prejudicial to his character\r\nfrom parasites and informers, this would be an ordeal which scarcely any\r\nmere man since the fall could endure. It would be to subject him to a\r\nreign of terror from which the stoutest and purest heart might shrink.\r\nI have passed triumphantly through this ordeal. My vindication is\r\ncomplete. The committee have reported no resolution looking to an\r\nimpeachment against me; no resolution of censure; not even a resolution\r\npointing out any abuses in any of the Executive Departments of the\r\nGovernment to be corrected by legislation. This is the highest\r\ncommendation which could be bestowed on the heads of these Departments.\r\nThe sovereign people of the States will, however, I trust, save my\r\nsuccessors, whoever they may be, from any such ordeal. They are frank,\r\nbold, and honest. They detest delators and informers. I therefore, in\r\nthe name and as the representative of this great people, and standing\r\nupon the ramparts of the Constitution which they \"have ordained and\r\nestablished,\" do solemnly protest against these unprecedented and\r\nunconstitutional proceedings.\r\n\r\nThere was still another committee raised by the House on the 6th\r\nMarch last, on motion of Mr. Hoard, to which I had not the slightest\r\nobjection. The resolution creating it was confined to specific charges,\r\nwhich I have ever since been ready and willing to meet. I have at\r\nall times invited and defied fair investigation upon constitutional\r\nprinciples. I have received no notice that this committee have ever\r\nproceeded to the investigation.\r\n\r\nWhy should the House of Representatives desire to encroach on the other\r\ndepartments of the Government? Their rightful powers are ample for every\r\nlegitimate purpose. They are the impeaching body. In their legislative\r\ncapacity it is their most wise and wholesome prerogative to institute\r\nrigid examinations into the manner in which all departments of the\r\nGovernment are conducted, with a view to reform abuses, to promote\r\neconomy, and to improve every branch of administration. Should they\r\nfind reason to believe in the course of their examinations that any\r\ngrave offense had been committed by the President or any officer of\r\nthe Government rendering it proper, in their judgment, to resort to\r\nimpeachment, their course would be plain. They would then transfer the\r\nquestion from their legislative to their accusatory jurisdiction, and\r\ntake care that in all the preliminary judicial proceedings preparatory\r\nto the vote of articles of impeachment the accused should enjoy the\r\nbenefit of cross-examining the witnesses and all the other safeguards\r\nwith which the Constitution surrounds every American citizen.\r\n\r\nIf in a legislative investigation it should appear that the public\r\ninterest required the removal of any officer of the Government, no\r\nPresident has ever existed who, after giving him a fair hearing, would\r\nhesitate to apply the remedy.\r\n\r\nThis I take to be the ancient and well-established practice. An\r\nadherence to it will best promote the harmony and the dignity of the\r\nintercourse between the coordinate branches of the Government and render\r\nus all more respectable both in the eyes of our own countrymen and of\r\nforeign nations.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas an extraordinary occasion has occurred rendering it necessary\r\nand proper that the Senate of the United States shall be convened to\r\nreceive and act upon such communications as have been or may be made\r\nto it on the part of the Executive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Buchanan, President of the United States, do\r\nissue this my proclamation, declaring that an extraordinary occasion\r\nrequires the Senate of the United States to convene for the transaction\r\nof business at the Capitol, in the city of Washington, on the 26th day\r\nof June instant, at 12 o'clock at noon of that day, of which all who\r\nshall then be entitled to act as members of that body are hereby\r\nrequired to take notice.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthis 25th day of June, A. D. 1860, and of the Independence of the United\r\nStates the eighty-fourth.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  LEWIS CASS,\r\n    _Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _December 3, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_Fellow-Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThroughout the year since our last meeting the country has been\r\neminently prosperous in all its material interests. The general health\r\nhas been excellent, our harvests have been abundant, and plenty smiles\r\nthroughout the land. Our commerce and manufactures have been prosecuted\r\nwith energy and industry, and have yielded fair and ample returns. In\r\nshort, no nation in the tide of time has ever presented a spectacle of\r\ngreater material prosperity than we have done until within a very recent\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nWhy is it, then, that discontent now so extensively prevails, and the\r\nUnion of the States, which is the source of all these blessings, is\r\nthreatened with destruction?\r\n\r\nThe long-continued and intemperate interference of the Northern people\r\nwith the question of slavery in the Southern States has at length\r\nproduced its natural effects. The different sections of the Union are\r\nnow arrayed against each other, and the time has arrived, so much\r\ndreaded by the Father of his Country, when hostile geographical parties\r\nhave been formed.\r\n\r\nI have long foreseen and often forewarned my countrymen of the now\r\nimpending danger. This does not proceed solely from the claim on the\r\npart of Congress or the Territorial legislatures to exclude slavery from\r\nthe Territories, nor from the efforts of different States to defeat the\r\nexecution of the fugitive-slave law. All or any of these evils might\r\nhave been endured by the South without danger to the Union (as others\r\nhave been) in the hope that time and reflection might apply the remedy.\r\nThe immediate peril arises not so much from these causes as from the\r\nfact that the incessant and violent agitation of the slavery question\r\nthroughout the North for the last quarter of a century has at length\r\nproduced its malign influence on the slaves and inspired them with vague\r\nnotions of freedom. Hence a sense of security no longer exists around\r\nthe family altar. This feeling of peace at home has given place to\r\napprehensions of servile insurrections. Many a matron throughout the\r\nSouth retires at night in dread of what may befall herself and children\r\nbefore the morning. Should this apprehension of domestic danger, whether\r\nreal or imaginary, extend and intensify itself until it shall pervade\r\nthe masses of the Southern people, then disunion will become inevitable.\r\nSelf-preservation is the first law of nature, and has been implanted in\r\nthe heart of man by his Creator for the wisest purpose; and no political\r\nunion, however fraught with blessings and benefits in all other\r\nrespects, can long continue if the necessary consequence be to render\r\nthe homes and the firesides of nearly half the parties to it habitually\r\nand hopelessly insecure. Sooner or later the bonds of such a union must\r\nbe severed. It is my conviction that this fatal period has not yet\r\narrived, and my prayer to God is that He would preserve the Constitution\r\nand the Union throughout all generations.\r\n\r\nBut let us take warning in time and remove the cause of danger. It can\r\nnot be denied that for five and twenty years the agitation at the North\r\nagainst slavery has been incessant. In 1835 pictorial handbills and\r\ninflammatory appeals were circulated extensively throughout the South of\r\na character to excite the passions of the slaves, and, in the language\r\nof General Jackson, \"to stimulate them to insurrection and produce all\r\nthe horrors of a servile war.\" This agitation has ever since been\r\ncontinued by the public press, by the proceedings of State and county\r\nconventions and by abolition sermons and lectures. The time of Congress\r\nhas been occupied in violent speeches on this never-ending subject, and\r\nappeals, in pamphlet and other forms, indorsed by distinguished names,\r\nhave been sent forth from this central point and spread broadcast over\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nHow easy would it be for the American people to settle the slavery\r\nquestion forever and to restore peace and harmony to this distracted\r\ncountry! They, and they alone, can do it. All that is necessary to\r\naccomplish the object, and all for which the slave States have ever\r\ncontended, is to be let alone and permitted to manage their domestic\r\ninstitutions in their own way. As sovereign States, they, and they\r\nalone, are responsible before God and the world for the slavery existing\r\namong them. For this the people of the North are not more responsible\r\nand have no more right to interfere than with similar institutions in\r\nRussia or in Brazil.\r\n\r\nUpon their good sense and patriotic forbearance I confess I still\r\ngreatly rely. Without their aid it is beyond the power of any President,\r\nno matter what may be his own political proclivities, to restore peace\r\nand harmony among the States. Wisely limited and restrained as is his\r\npower under our Constitution and laws, he alone can accomplish but\r\nlittle for good or for evil on such a momentous question.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings me to observe that the election of any one of our\r\nfellow-citizens to the office of President does not of itself afford\r\njust cause for dissolving the Union. This is more especially true if\r\nhis election has been effected by a mere plurality, and not a majority\r\nof the people, and has resulted from transient and temporary causes,\r\nwhich may probably never again occur. In order to justify a resort to\r\nrevolutionary resistance, the Federal Government must be guilty of \"a\r\ndeliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise\" of powers not granted by\r\nthe Constitution. The late Presidential election, however, has been held\r\nin strict conformity with its express provisions. How, then, can the\r\nresult justify a revolution to destroy this very Constitution? Reason,\r\njustice, a regard for the Constitution, all require that we shall wait\r\nfor some overt and dangerous act on the part of the President elect\r\nbefore resorting to such a remedy. It is said, however, that the\r\nantecedents of the President elect have been sufficient to justify the\r\nfears of the South that he will attempt to invade their constitutional\r\nrights. But are such apprehensions of contingent danger in the future\r\nsufficient to justify the immediate destruction of the noblest system of\r\ngovernment ever devised by mortals? From the very nature of his office\r\nand its high responsibilities he must necessarily be conservative. The\r\nstern duty of administering the vast and complicated concerns of this\r\nGovernment affords in itself a guaranty that he will not attempt any\r\nviolation of a clear constitutional right.\r\n\r\nAfter all, he is no more than the chief executive officer of the\r\nGovernment. His province is not to make but to execute the laws.\r\nAnd it is a remarkable fact in our history that, notwithstanding\r\nthe repeated efforts of the antislavery party, no single act has ever\r\npassed Congress, unless we may possibly except the Missouri compromise,\r\nimpairing in the slightest degree the rights of the South to their\r\nproperty in slaves; and it may also be observed, judging from present\r\nindications, that no probability exists of the passage of such an act by\r\na majority of both Houses, either in the present or the next Congress.\r\nSurely under these circumstances we ought to be restrained from present\r\naction by the precept of Him who spake as man never spoke, that\r\n\"sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\" The day of evil may never\r\ncome unless we shall rashly bring it upon ourselves.\r\n\r\nIt is alleged as one cause for immediate secession that the Southern\r\nStates are denied equal rights with the other States in the common\r\nTerritories. But by what authority are these denied? Not by Congress,\r\nwhich has never passed, and I believe never will pass, any act to\r\nexclude slavery from these Territories; and certainly not by the Supreme\r\nCourt, which has solemnly decided that slaves are property, and, like\r\nall other property, their owners have a right to take them into the\r\ncommon Territories and hold them there under the protection of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nSo far then, as Congress is concerned, the objection is not to anything\r\nthey have already done, but to what they may do hereafter. It will\r\nsurely be admitted that this apprehension of future danger is no good\r\nreason for an immediate dissolution of the Union. It is true that the\r\nTerritorial legislature of Kansas, on the 23d February, 1860, passed in\r\ngreat haste an act over the veto of the governor declaring that slavery\r\n\"is and shall be forever prohibited in this Territory.\" Such an act,\r\nhowever, plainly violating the rights of property secured by the\r\nConstitution, will surely be declared void by the judiciary whenever\r\nit shall be presented in a legal form.\r\n\r\nOnly three days after my inauguration the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates solemnly adjudged that this power did not exist in a Territorial\r\nlegislature. Yet such has been the factious temper of the times that the\r\ncorrectness of this decision has been extensively impugned before the\r\npeople, and the question has given rise to angry political conflicts\r\nthroughout the country. Those who have appealed from this judgment of\r\nour highest constitutional tribunal to popular assemblies would, if they\r\ncould, invest a Territorial legislature with power to annul the sacred\r\nrights of property. This power Congress is expressly forbidden by the\r\nFederal Constitution to exercise. Every State legislature in the Union\r\nis forbidden by its own constitution to exercise it. It can not be\r\nexercised in any State except by the people in their highest sovereign\r\ncapacity, when framing or amending their State constitution. In like\r\nmanner it can only be exercised by the people of a Territory represented\r\nin a convention of delegates for the purpose of framing a constitution\r\npreparatory to admission as a State into the Union. Then, and not until\r\nthen, are they invested with power to decide the question whether\r\nslavery shall or shall not exist within their limits. This is an act of\r\nsovereign authority, and not of subordinate Territorial legislation.\r\nWere it otherwise, then indeed would the equality of the States in the\r\nTerritories be destroyed, and the rights of property in slaves would\r\ndepend not upon the guaranties of the Constitution, but upon the\r\nshifting majorities of an irresponsible Territorial legislature. Such\r\na doctrine, from its intrinsic unsoundness, can not long influence any\r\nconsiderable portion of our people, much less can it afford a good\r\nreason for a dissolution of the Union.\r\n\r\nThe most palpable violations of constitutional duty which have yet been\r\ncommitted consist in the acts of different State legislatures to defeat\r\nthe execution of the fugitive-slave law. It ought to be remembered,\r\nhowever, that for these acts neither Congress nor any President can\r\njustly be held responsible. Having been passed in violation of the\r\nFederal Constitution, they are therefore null and void. All the courts,\r\nboth State and national, before whom the question has arisen have from\r\nthe beginning declared the fugitive-slave law to be constitutional. The\r\nsingle exception is that of a State court in Wisconsin, and this has not\r\nonly been reversed by the proper appellate tribunal, but has met with\r\nsuch universal reprobation that there can be no danger from it as a\r\nprecedent. The validity of this law has been established over and over\r\nagain by the Supreme Court of the United States with perfect unanimity.\r\nIt is founded upon an express provision of the Constitution, requiring\r\nthat fugitive slaves who escape from service in one State to another\r\nshall be \"delivered up\" to their masters. Without this provision it is a\r\nwell-known historical fact that the Constitution itself could never have\r\nbeen adopted by the Convention. In one form or other, under the acts of\r\n1793 and 1850, both being substantially the same, the fugitive-slave\r\nlaw has been the law of the land from the days of Washington until the\r\npresent moment. Here, then, a clear case is presented in which it will\r\nbe the duty of the next President, as it has been my own, to act with\r\nvigor in executing this supreme law against the conflicting enactments\r\nof State legislatures. Should he fail in the performance of this high\r\nduty, he will then have manifested a disregard of the Constitution and\r\nlaws, to the great injury of the people of nearly one-half of the States\r\nof the Union. But are we to presume in advance that he will thus violate\r\nhis duty? This would be at war with every principle of justice and of\r\nChristian charity. Let us wait for the overt act. The fugitive-slave\r\nlaw has been carried into execution in every contested case since the\r\ncommencement of the present Administration, though often, it is to\r\nbe regretted, with great loss and inconvenience to the master and\r\nwith considerable expense to the Government. Let us trust that the\r\nState legislatures will repeal their unconstitutional and obnoxious\r\nenactments. Unless this shall be done without unnecessary delay, it\r\nis impossible for any human power to save the Union.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States, standing on the basis of the Constitution, have a\r\nright to demand this act of justice from the States of the North. Should\r\nit be refused, then the Constitution, to which all the States are\r\nparties, will have been willfully violated by one portion of them in\r\na provision essential to the domestic security and happiness of the\r\nremainder. In that event the injured States, after having first used all\r\npeaceful and constitutional means to obtain redress, would be justified\r\nin revolutionary resistance to the Government of the Union.\r\n\r\nI have purposely confined my remarks to revolutionary resistance,\r\nbecause it has been claimed within the last few years that any State,\r\nwhenever this shall be its sovereign will and pleasure, may secede from\r\nthe Union in accordance with the Constitution and without any violation\r\nof the constitutional rights of the other members of the Confederacy;\r\nthat as each became parties to the Union by the vote of its own people\r\nassembled in convention, so any one of them may retire from the Union\r\nin a similar manner by the vote of such a convention.\r\n\r\nIn order to justify secession as a constitutional remedy, it must\r\nbe on the principle that the Federal Government is a mere voluntary\r\nassociation of States, to be dissolved at pleasure by any one of the\r\ncontracting parties. If this be so, the Confederacy is a rope of sand,\r\nto be penetrated and dissolved by the first adverse wave of public\r\nopinion in any of the States. In this manner our thirty-three States\r\nmay, resolve themselves into as many petty, jarring, and hostile\r\nrepublics, each one retiring from the Union without responsibility\r\nwhenever any sudden excitement might impel them to such a course.\r\nBy this process a Union might be entirely broken into fragments in\r\na few weeks which cost our forefathers many years of toil, privation,\r\nand blood to establish.\r\n\r\nSuch a principle is wholly inconsistent with the history as well as the\r\ncharacter of the Federal Constitution. After it was framed with the\r\ngreatest deliberation and care it was submitted to conventions of the\r\npeople of the several States for ratification. Its provisions were\r\ndiscussed at length in these bodies, composed of the first men of the\r\ncountry. Its opponents contended that it conferred powers upon the\r\nFederal Government dangerous to the rights of the States, whilst its\r\nadvocates maintained that under a fair construction of the instrument\r\nthere was no foundation for such apprehensions. In that mighty struggle\r\nbetween the first intellects of this or any other country it never\r\noccurred to any individual, either among its opponents or advocates,\r\nto assert or even to intimate that their efforts were all vain labor,\r\nbecause the moment that any State felt herself aggrieved she might\r\nsecede from the Union. What a crushing argument would this have proved\r\nagainst those who dreaded that the rights of the States would be\r\nendangered by the Constitution! The truth is that it was not until many\r\nyears after the origin of the Federal Government that such a proposition\r\nwas first advanced. It was then met and refuted by the conclusive\r\narguments of General Jackson, who in his message of the 16th of January,\r\n1833, transmitting the nullifying ordinance of South Carolina to\r\nCongress, employs the following language:\r\n\r\n  The right of the people of a single State to absolve themselves at will\r\n  and without the consent of the other States from their most solemn\r\n  obligations, and hazard the liberties and happiness of the millions\r\n  composing this Union, can not be acknowledged. Such authority is\r\n  believed to be utterly repugnant both to the principles upon which\r\n  the General Government is constituted and to the objects which it is\r\n  expressly formed to attain.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended that any clause in the Constitution gives\r\ncountenance to such a theory. It is altogether founded upon inference;\r\nnot from any language contained in the instrument itself, but from the\r\nsovereign character of the several States by which it was ratified.\r\nBut is it beyond the power of a State, like an individual, to yield a\r\nportion of its sovereign rights to secure the remainder? In the language\r\nof Mr. Madison, who has been called the father of the Constitution--\r\n\r\n  It was formed by the States; that is, by the people in each of\r\n  the States acting in their highest sovereign capacity, and formed,\r\n  consequently, by the same authority which formed the State\r\n  constitutions. ... Nor is the Government of the United States,\r\n  created by the Constitution, less a government, in the strict sense\r\n  of the term, within the sphere of its powers than the governments\r\n  created by the constitutions of the States are within their several\r\n  spheres. It is, like them, organized into legislative, executive,\r\n  and judiciary departments. It operates, like them, directly on\r\n  persons and things, and, like them, it has at command a physical\r\n  force for executing the powers committed to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was intended to be perpetual, and not to be annulled at the pleasure\r\nof any one of the contracting parties. The old Articles of Confederation\r\nwere entitled \"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the\r\nStates,\" and by the thirteenth article it is expressly declared that\r\n\"the articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by\r\nevery State, and the Union shall be perpetual.\" The preamble to the\r\nConstitution of the United States, having express reference to the\r\nArticles of Confederation, recites that it was established \"in order\r\nto form a more perfect union.\" And yet it is contended that this \"more\r\nperfect union\" does not include the essential attribute of perpetuity.\r\n\r\nBut that the Union was designed to be perpetual appears conclusively\r\nfrom the nature and extent of the powers conferred by the Constitution\r\non the Federal Government. These powers embrace the very highest\r\nattributes of national sovereignty. They place both the sword and the\r\npurse under its control. Congress has power to make war and to make\r\npeace, to raise and support armies and navies, and to conclude treaties\r\nwith foreign governments. It is invested with the power to coin money\r\nand to regulate the value thereof, and to regulate commerce with foreign\r\nnations and among the several States. It is not necessary to enumerate\r\nthe other high powers which have been conferred upon the Federal\r\nGovernment. In order to carry the enumerated powers into effect,\r\nCongress possesses the exclusive right to lay and collect duties on\r\nimports, and, in common with the States, to lay and collect all other\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nBut the Constitution has not only conferred these high powers upon\r\nCongress, but it has adopted effectual means to restrain the States\r\nfrom interfering with their exercise. For that purpose it has in\r\nstrong prohibitory language expressly declared that--\r\n\r\n  No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;\r\n  grant letters of marque and reprisal; coin money; emit bills of\r\n  credit; make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment\r\n  of debts; pass any bill of attainder, _ex post facto_ law, or law\r\n  impairing the obligation of contracts.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover--\r\n\r\n  No State shall without the consent of the Congress lay any imposts\r\n  or duties on imports or exports, except what may be absolutely\r\n  necessary for executing its inspection laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd if they exceed this amount the excess shall belong to the United\r\nStates. And--\r\n\r\n  No State shall without the consent of Congress lay any duty of\r\n  tonnage, keep troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into\r\n  any agreement or compact with another State or with a foreign power,\r\n  or engage in war, unless actually invaded or in such imminent danger\r\n  as will not admit of delay.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order still further to secure the uninterrupted exercise of these\r\nhigh powers against State interposition, it is provided: that--\r\n\r\n  This Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be\r\n  made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made or which shall be\r\n  made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme\r\n  law of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound\r\n  thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State to the\r\n  contrary notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solemn sanction of religion has been superadded to the obligations\r\nof official duty, and all Senators and Representatives of the United\r\nStates, all members of State legislatures, and all executive and\r\njudicial officers, \"both of the United States and of the several States,\r\nshall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to carry into effect these powers, the Constitution has\r\nestablished a perfect Government in all its forms--legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judicial; and this Government to the extent of its powers\r\nacts directly upon the individual citizens of every State, and executes\r\nits own decrees by the agency of its own officers. In this respect it\r\ndiffers entirely from the Government under the old Confederation, which\r\nwas confined to making requisitions on the States in their sovereign\r\ncharacter. This left it in the discretion of each whether to obey or\r\nto refuse, and they often declined to comply with such requisitions.\r\nIt thus became necessary for the purpose of removing this barrier and\r\n\"in order to form a more perfect union\" to establish a Government which\r\ncould act directly upon the people and execute its own laws without the\r\nintermediate agency of the States. This has been accomplished by the\r\nConstitution of the United States. In short, the Government created by\r\nthe Constitution, and deriving its authority from the sovereign people\r\nof each of the several States, has precisely the same right to exercise\r\nits power over the people of all these States in the enumerated cases\r\nthat each one of them possesses over subjects not delegated to the\r\nUnited States, but \"reserved to the States respectively or to the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nTo the extent of the delegated powers the Constitution of the United\r\nStates is as much a part of the constitution of each State and is as\r\nbinding upon its people as though it had been textually inserted\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nThis Government, therefore, is a great and powerful Government, invested\r\nwith all the attributes of sovereignty over the special subjects to\r\nwhich its authority extends. Its framers never intended to implant\r\nin its bosom the seeds of its own destruction, nor were they at its\r\ncreation guilty of the absurdity of providing for its own dissolution.\r\nIt was not intended by its framers to be the baseless fabric of a\r\nvision, which at the touch of the enchanter would vanish into thin air,\r\nbut a substantial and mighty fabric, capable of resisting the slow decay\r\nof time and of defying the storms of ages. Indeed, well may the jealous\r\npatriots of that day have indulged fears that a Government of such high\r\npowers might violate the reserved rights of the States, and wisely did\r\nthey adopt the rule of a strict construction of these powers to prevent\r\nthe danger. But they did not fear, nor had they any reason to imagine,\r\nthat the Constitution would ever be so interpreted as to enable any\r\nState by her own act, and without the consent of her sister States,\r\nto discharge her people from all or any of their federal obligations.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, then, Are the people of the States without redress\r\nagainst the tyranny and oppression of the Federal Government? By no\r\nmeans. The right of resistance on the part of the governed against\r\nthe oppression of their governments can not be denied. It exists\r\nindependently of all constitutions, and has been exercised at all\r\nperiods of the world's history. Under it old governments have been\r\ndestroyed and new ones have taken their place. It is embodied in strong\r\nand express language in our own Declaration of Independence. But the\r\ndistinction must ever be observed that this is revolution against an\r\nestablished government, and not a voluntary secession from it by virtue\r\nof an inherent constitutional right. In short, let us look the danger\r\nfairly in the face. Secession is neither more nor less than revolution.\r\nIt may or it may not be a justifiable revolution, but still it is\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nWhat, in the meantime, is the responsibility and true position of the\r\nExecutive? He is bound by solemn oath, before God and the country,\r\n\"to take care that the laws be faithfully executed,\" and from this\r\nobligation he can not be absolved by any human power. But what if\r\nthe performance of this duty, in whole or in part, has been rendered\r\nimpracticable by events over which he could have exercised no control?\r\nSuch at the present moment is the case throughout the State of South\r\nCarolina so far as the laws of the United States to secure the\r\nadministration of justice by means of the Federal judiciary are\r\nconcerned. All the Federal officers within its limits through whose\r\nagency alone these laws can be carried into execution have already\r\nresigned. We no longer have a district judge, a district attorney,\r\nor a marshal in South Carolina. In fact, the whole machinery of the\r\nFederal Government necessary for the distribution of remedial justice\r\namong the people has been demolished, and it would be difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to replace it.\r\n\r\nThe only acts of Congress on the statute book bearing upon this subject\r\nare those of February 28, 1795, and March 3, 1807. These authorize the\r\nPresident, after he shall have ascertained that the marshal, with his\r\n_posse comitatus_, is unable to execute civil or criminal process in\r\nany particular case, to call forth the militia and employ the Army\r\nand Navy to aid him in performing this service, having first by\r\nproclamation commanded the insurgents \"to disperse and retire peaceably\r\nto their respective abodes within a limited time.\" This duty can not by\r\npossibility be performed in a State where no judicial authority exists\r\nto issue process, and where there is no marshal to execute it, and\r\nwhere, even if there were such an officer, the entire population would\r\nconstitute one solid combination to resist him.\r\n\r\nThe bare enumeration of these provisions proves how inadequate they are\r\nwithout further legislation to overcome a united opposition in a single\r\nState, not to speak of other States who may place themselves in a\r\nsimilar attitude. Congress alone has power to decide whether the present\r\nlaws can or can not be amended so as to carry out more effectually the\r\nobjects of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe same insuperable obstacles do not lie in the way of executing the\r\nlaws for the collection of the customs. The revenue still continues to\r\nbe collected as heretofore at the custom-house in Charleston, and should\r\nthe collector unfortunately resign a successor may be appointed to\r\nperform this duty.\r\n\r\nThen, in regard to the property of the United States in South Carolina.\r\nThis has been purchased for a fair equivalent, \"by the consent of the\r\nlegislature of the State,\" \"for the erection of forts, magazines,\r\narsenals,\" etc., and over these the authority \"to exercise exclusive\r\nlegislation\" has been expressly granted by the Constitution to Congress.\r\nIt is not believed that any attempt will be made to expel the United\r\nStates from this property by force; but if in this I should prove to be\r\nmistaken, the officer in command of the forts has received orders to act\r\nstrictly on the defensive. In such a contingency the responsibility for\r\nconsequences would rightfully rest upon the heads of the assailants.\r\n\r\nApart from the execution of the laws, so far as this may be practicable,\r\nthe Executive has no authority to decide what shall be the relations\r\nbetween the Federal Government and South Carolina. He has been invested\r\nwith no such discretion. He possesses no power to change the relations\r\nheretofore existing between them, much less to acknowledge the\r\nindependence of that State. This would be to invest a mere executive\r\nofficer with the power of recognizing the dissolution of the confederacy\r\namong our thirty-three sovereign States. It bears no resemblance to the\r\nrecognition of a foreign _de facto_ government, involving no such\r\nresponsibility. Any attempt to do this would, on his part, be a naked\r\nact of usurpation. It is therefore my duty to submit to Congress the\r\nwhole question in all its bearings. The course of events is so rapidly\r\nhastening forward that the emergency may soon arise when you may be\r\ncalled upon to decide the momentous question whether you possess the\r\npower by force of arms to compel a State to remain in the Union.\r\nI should feel myself recreant to my duty were I not to express an\r\nopinion on this important subject.\r\n\r\nThe question fairly stated is, Has the Constitution delegated to\r\nCongress the power to coerce a State into submission which is attempting\r\nto withdraw or has actually withdrawn from the Confederacy? If answered\r\nin the affirmative, it must be on the principle that the power has been\r\nconferred upon Congress to declare and to make war against a State.\r\nAfter much serious reflection I have arrived at the conclusion that no\r\nsuch power has been delegated to Congress or to any other department\r\nof the Federal Government. It is manifest upon an inspection of the\r\nConstitution that this is not among the specific and enumerated powers\r\ngranted to Congress, and it is equally apparent that its exercise is\r\nnot \"necessary and proper for carrying into execution\" any one of these\r\npowers. So far from this power having been delegated to Congress, it was\r\nexpressly refused by the Convention which framed the Constitution. It\r\nappears from the proceedings of that body that on the 31st May, 1787,\r\nthe clause \"_authorizing an exertion of the force of the whole against\r\na delinquent State_\" came up for consideration. Mr. Madison opposed it\r\nin a brief but powerful speech, from which I shall extract but a single\r\nsentence. He observed:\r\n\r\n  The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration\r\n  of war than an infliction of punishment, and would probably be\r\n  considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous\r\n  compacts by which it might be bound.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon his motion the clause was unanimously postponed, and was never,\r\nI believe, again presented. Soon afterwards, on the 8th June, 1787,\r\nwhen incidentally adverting to the subject, he said: \"Any government\r\nfor the United States formed on the supposed practicability of using\r\nforce against the unconstitutional proceedings of the States would\r\nprove as visionary and fallacious as the government of Congress,\"\r\nevidently meaning the then existing Congress of the old Confederation.\r\n\r\nWithout descending to particulars, it may be safely asserted that the\r\npower to make war against a State is at variance with the whole spirit\r\nand intent of the Constitution. Suppose such a war should result in the\r\nconquest of a State; how are we to govern it afterwards? Shall we hold\r\nit as a province and govern it by despotic power? In the nature of\r\nthings, we could not by physical force control the will of the people\r\nand compel them to elect Senators and Representatives to Congress and\r\nto perform all the other duties depending upon their own volition and\r\nrequired from the free citizens of a free State as a constituent member\r\nof the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nBut if we possessed this power, would it be wise to exercise it under\r\nexisting circumstances? The object would doubtless be to preserve the\r\nUnion. War would not only present the most effectual means of destroying\r\nit, but would vanish all hope of its peaceable reconstruction. Besides,\r\nin the fraternal conflict a vast amount of blood and treasure would be\r\nexpended, rendering future reconciliation between the States impossible.\r\nIn the meantime, who can foretell what would be the sufferings and\r\nprivations of the people during its existence?\r\n\r\nThe fact is that our Union rests upon public opinion, and can never be\r\ncemented by the blood of its citizens shed in civil war. If it can not\r\nlive in the affections of the people, it must one day perish. Congress\r\npossesses many means of preserving it by conciliation, but the sword was\r\nnot placed in their hand to preserve it by force.\r\n\r\nBut may I be permitted solemnly to invoke my countrymen to pause and\r\ndeliberate before they determine to destroy this the grandest temple\r\nwhich has ever been dedicated to human freedom since the world began?\r\nIt has been consecrated by the blood of our fathers, by the glories of\r\nthe past, and by the hopes of the future. The Union has already made us\r\nthe most prosperous, and ere long will, if preserved, render us the most\r\npowerful, nation on the face of the earth. In every foreign region of\r\nthe globe the title of American citizen is held in the highest respect,\r\nand when pronounced in a foreign land it causes the hearts of our\r\ncountrymen to swell with honest pride. Surely when we reach the brink\r\nof the yawning abyss we shall recoil with horror from the last fatal\r\nplunge.\r\n\r\nBy such a dread catastrophe the hopes of the friends of freedom\r\nthroughout the world would be destroyed, and a long night of leaden\r\ndespotism would enshroud the nations. Our example for more than eighty\r\nyears would not only be lost, but it would be quoted as a conclusive\r\nproof that man is unfit for self-government.\r\n\r\nIt is not every wrong--nay, it is not every grievous wrong--which\r\ncan justify a resort to such a fearful alternative. This ought to be\r\nthe last desperate remedy of a despairing people, after every other\r\nconstitutional means of conciliation had been exhausted. We should\r\nreflect that under this free Government there is an incessant ebb and\r\nflow in public opinion. The slavery question, like everything human,\r\nwill have its day. I firmly believe that it has reached and passed the\r\nculminating point. But if in the midst of the existing excitement the\r\nUnion shall perish, the evil may then become irreparable.\r\n\r\nCongress can contribute much to avert it by proposing and recommending\r\nto the legislatures of the several States the remedy for existing evils\r\nwhich the Constitution has itself provided for its own preservation.\r\nThis has been tried at different critical periods of our history, and\r\nalways with eminent success. It is to be found in the fifth article,\r\nproviding for its own amendment. Under this article amendments have\r\nbeen proposed by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, and have been\r\n\"ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States,\"\r\nand have consequently become parts of the Constitution. To this process\r\nthe country is indebted for the clause prohibiting Congress from passing\r\nany law respecting an establishment of religion or abridging the freedom\r\nof speech or of the press or of the right of petition. To this we\r\nare also indebted for the bill of rights which secures the people\r\nagainst any abuse of power by the Federal Government. Such were the\r\napprehensions justly entertained by the friends of State rights at\r\nthat period as to have rendered it extremely doubtful whether the\r\nConstitution could have long survived without those amendments.\r\n\r\nAgain the Constitution was amended by the same process, after the\r\nelection of President Jefferson by the House of Representatives, in\r\nFebruary, 1803. This amendment was rendered necessary to prevent a\r\nrecurrence of the dangers which had seriously threatened the existence\r\nof the Government during the pendency of that election. The article\r\nfor its own amendment was intended to secure the amicable adjustment\r\nof conflicting constitutional questions like the present which might\r\narise between the governments of the States and that of the United\r\nStates. This appears from contemporaneous history. In this connection\r\nI shall merely call attention to a few sentences in Mr. Madison's\r\njustly celebrated report, in 1799, to the legislature of Virginia.\r\nIn this he ably and conclusively defended the resolutions of the\r\npreceding legislature against the strictures of several other State\r\nlegislatures. These were mainly founded upon the protest of the Virginia\r\nlegislature against the \"alien and sedition acts,\" as \"palpable and\r\nalarming infractions of the Constitution.\" In pointing out the peaceful\r\nand constitutional remedies--and he referred to none other--to which the\r\nStates were authorized to resort on such occasions, he concludes by\r\nsaying that--\r\n\r\n  The legislatures of the States might have made a direct representation\r\n  to Congress with a view to obtain a rescinding of the two offensive\r\n  acts, or they might have represented to their respective Senators\r\n  in Congress their wish that two-thirds thereof would propose an\r\n  explanatory amendment to the Constitution; or two-thirds of themselves,\r\n  if such had been their option, might by an application to Congress\r\n  have obtained a convention for the same object.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the very course which I earnestly recommend in order to\r\nobtain an \"explanatory amendment\" of the Constitution on the subject of\r\nslavery. This might originate with Congress or the State legislatures,\r\nas may be deemed most advisable to attain the object. The explanatory\r\namendment might be confined to the final settlement of the true\r\nconstruction of the Constitution on three special points:\r\n\r\n1. An express recognition of the right of property in slaves in the\r\nStates where it now exists or may hereafter exist.\r\n\r\n2. The duty of protecting this right in all the common Territories\r\nthroughout their Territorial existence, and until they shall be\r\nadmitted as States into the Union, with or without slavery, as their\r\nconstitutions may prescribe.\r\n\r\n3. A like recognition of the right of the master to have his slave who\r\nhas escaped from one State to another restored and \"delivered up\" to\r\nhim, and of the validity of the fugitive-slave law enacted for this\r\npurpose, together with a declaration that all State laws impairing\r\nor defeating this right are violations of the Constitution, and are\r\nconsequently null and void. It may be objected that this construction of\r\nthe Constitution has already been settled by the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, and what more ought to be required? The answer is that a\r\nvery large proportion of the people of the United States still contest\r\nthe correctness of this decision, and never will cease from agitation\r\nand admit its binding force until clearly established by the people of\r\nthe several States in their sovereign character. Such an explanatory\r\namendment would, it is believed, forever terminate the existing\r\ndissensions, and restore peace and harmony among the States.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be doubted that such an appeal to the arbitrament\r\nestablished by the Constitution itself would be received with favor by\r\nall the States of the Confederacy. In any event, it ought to be tried\r\nin a spirit of conciliation before any of these States shall separate\r\nthemselves from the Union.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered upon the duties of the Presidential office, the aspect\r\nneither of our foreign nor domestic affairs was at all satisfactory.\r\nWe were involved in dangerous complications with several nations,\r\nand two of our Territories were in a state of revolution against the\r\nGovernment. A restoration of the African slave trade had numerous and\r\npowerful advocates. Unlawful military expeditions were countenanced by\r\nmany of our citizens, and were suffered, in defiance of the efforts of\r\nthe Government, to escape from our shores for the purpose of making war\r\nupon the unoffending people of neighboring republics with whom we were\r\nat peace. In addition to these and other difficulties, we experienced\r\na revulsion in monetary affairs soon after my advent to power of\r\nunexampled severity and of ruinous consequences to all the great\r\ninterests of the country. When we take a retrospect of what was then\r\nour condition and contrast this with its material prosperity at the\r\ntime of the late Presidential election, we have abundant reason to\r\nreturn our grateful thanks to that merciful Providence which has never\r\nforsaken us as a nation in all our past trials.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Great Britain are of the most friendly character.\r\nSince the commencement of my Administration the two dangerous questions\r\narising from the Clayton and Bulwer treaty and from the right of search\r\nclaimed by the British Government have been amicably and honorably\r\nadjusted.\r\n\r\nThe discordant constructions of the Clayton and Bulwer treaty between\r\nthe two Governments, which at different periods of the discussion bore\r\na threatening aspect, have resulted in a final settlement entirely\r\nsatisfactory to this Government. In my last annual message I informed\r\nCongress that the British Government had not then \"completed treaty\r\narrangements with the Republics of Honduras and Nicaragua in pursuance\r\nof the understanding between the two Governments. It is, nevertheless,\r\nconfidently expected that this good work will ere long be accomplished.\"\r\nThis confident expectation has since been fulfilled. Her Britannic\r\nMajesty concluded a treaty with Honduras on the 28th November, 1859,\r\nand with Nicaragua on the 28th August, 1860, relinquishing the Mosquito\r\nprotectorate. Besides, by the former the Bay Islands are recognized\r\nas a part of the Republic of Honduras. It may be observed that the\r\nstipulations of these treaties conform in every important particular\r\nto the amendments adopted by the Senate of the United States to the\r\ntreaty concluded at London on the 17th October, 1856, between the two\r\nGovernments. It will be recollected that this treaty was rejected by the\r\nBritish Government because of its objection to the just and important\r\namendment of the Senate to the article relating to Ruatan and the other\r\nislands in the Bay of Honduras.\r\n\r\nIt must be a source of sincere satisfaction to all classes of our\r\nfellow-citizens, and especially to those engaged in foreign commerce,\r\nthat the claim on the part of Great Britain forcibly to visit and search\r\nAmerican merchant vessels on the high seas in time of peace has been\r\nabandoned. This was by far the most dangerous question to the peace of\r\nthe two countries which has existed since the War of 1812. Whilst it\r\nremained open they might at any moment have been precipitated into a\r\nwar. This was rendered manifest by the exasperated state of public\r\nfeeling throughout our entire country produced by the forcible search of\r\nAmerican merchant vessels by British cruisers on the coast of Cuba in\r\nthe spring of 1858. The American people hailed with general acclaim the\r\norders of the Secretary of the Navy to our naval force in the Gulf of\r\nMexico \"to protect all vessels of the United States on the high seas\r\nfrom search or detention by the vessels of war of any other nation.\"\r\nThese orders might have produced an immediate collision between the\r\nnaval forces of the two countries. This was most fortunately prevented\r\nby an appeal to the justice of Great Britain and to the law of nations\r\nas expounded by her own most eminent jurists.\r\n\r\nThe only question of any importance which still remains open is the\r\ndisputed title between the two Governments to the island of San Juan,\r\nin the vicinity of Washington Territory. As this question is still\r\nunder negotiation, it is not deemed advisable at the present moment\r\nto make any other allusion to the subject.\r\n\r\nThe recent visit of the Prince of Wales, in a private character, to the\r\npeople of this country has proved to be a most auspicious event. In its\r\nconsequences it can not fail to increase the kindred and kindly feelings\r\nwhich I trust may ever actuate the Government and people of both\r\ncountries in their political and social intercourse with each other.\r\n\r\nWith France, our ancient and powerful ally, our relations continue\r\nto be of the most friendly character. A decision has recently been\r\nmade by a French judicial tribunal, with the approbation of the Imperial\r\nGovernment, which can not fail to foster the sentiments of mutual\r\nregard that have so long existed between the two countries. Under the\r\nFrench law no person can serve in the armies of France unless he be\r\na French citizen. The law of France recognizing the natural right of\r\nexpatriation, it follows as a necessary consequence that a Frenchman by\r\nthe fact of having become a citizen of the United States has changed his\r\nallegiance and has lost his native character. He can not therefore be\r\ncompelled to serve in the French armies in case he should return to his\r\nnative country. These principles were announced in 1852 by the French\r\nminister of war and in two late cases have been confirmed by the French\r\njudiciary. In these, two natives of France have been discharged from\r\nthe French army because they had become American citizens. To employ\r\nthe language of our present minister to France, who has rendered good\r\nservice on this occasion, \"I do not think our French naturalized\r\nfellow-citizens will hereafter experience much annoyance on this\r\nsubject,\"\r\n\r\nI venture to predict that the time is not far distant when the other\r\ncontinental powers will adopt the same wise and just policy which has\r\ndone so much honor to the enlightened Government of the Emperor. In any\r\nevent, our Government is bound to protect the rights of our naturalized\r\ncitizens everywhere to the same extent as though they had drawn their\r\nfirst breath in this country. We can recognize no distinction between\r\nour native and naturalized citizens.\r\n\r\nBetween the great Empire of Russia and the United States the mutual\r\nfriendship and regard which has so long existed still continues to\r\nprevail, and if possible to increase. Indeed, our relations with that\r\nEmpire are all that we could desire. Our relations with Spain are now\r\nof a more complicated, though less dangerous, character than they have\r\nbeen for many years. Our citizens have long held and continue to hold\r\nnumerous claims against the Spanish Government. These had been ably\r\nurged for a series of years by our successive diplomatic representatives\r\nat Madrid, but without obtaining redress. The Spanish Government finally\r\nagreed to institute a joint commission for the adjustment of these\r\nclaims, and on the 5th day of March, 1860, concluded a convention for\r\nthis purpose with our present minister at Madrid.\r\n\r\nUnder this convention what have been denominated the \"Cuban claims,\"\r\namounting to $128,635.54, in which more than 100 of our fellow-citizens\r\nare interested, were recognized, and the Spanish Government agreed to\r\npay $100,000 of this amount \"within three months following the exchange\r\nof ratifications.\" The payment of the remaining $28,635.54 was to await\r\nthe decision of the commissioners for or against the _Amistad_ claim;\r\nbut in any event the balance was to be paid to the claimants either by\r\nSpain or the United States. These terms, I have every reason to know,\r\nare highly satisfactory to the holders of the Cuban claims. Indeed, they\r\nhave made a formal offer authorizing the State Department to settle\r\nthese claims and to deduct the amount of the _Amistad_ claim from the\r\nsums which they are entitled to receive from Spain. This offer, of\r\ncourse, can not be accepted. All other claims of citizens of the United\r\nStates against Spain, or the subjects of the Queen of Spain against the\r\nUnited States, including the _Amistad_ claim, were by this convention\r\nreferred to a board of commissioners in the usual form. Neither the\r\nvalidity of the _Amistad_ claim nor of any other claim against either\r\nparty, with the single exception of the Cuban claims, was recognized\r\nby the convention. Indeed, the Spanish Government did not insist\r\nthat the validity of the _Amistad_ claim should be thus recognized,\r\nnotwithstanding its payment had been recommended to Congress by two\r\nof my predecessors, as well as by myself, and an appropriation for\r\nthat purpose had passed the Senate of the United States.\r\n\r\nThey were content that it should be submitted to the board for\r\nexamination and decision like the other claims. Both Governments were\r\nbound respectively to pay the amounts awarded to the several claimants\r\n\"at such times and places as may be fixed by and according to the tenor\r\nof said awards.\"\r\n\r\nI transmitted this convention to the Senate for their constitutional\r\naction on the 3d of May, 1860, and on the 27th of the succeeding June\r\nthey determined that they would \"not advise and consent\" to its\r\nratification.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings place our relations with Spain in an awkward and\r\nembarrassing position. It is more than probable that the final\r\nadjustment of these claims will devolve upon my successor.\r\n\r\nI reiterate the recommendation contained in my annual message of\r\nDecember, 1858, and repeated in that of December, 1859, in favor of the\r\nacquisition of Cuba from Spain by fair purchase. I firmly believe that\r\nsuch an acquisition would contribute essentially to the well-being\r\nand prosperity of both countries in all future time, as well as prove\r\nthe certain means of immediately abolishing the African slave trade\r\nthroughout the world. I would not repeat this recommendation upon the\r\npresent occasion if I believed that the transfer of Cuba to the United\r\nStates upon conditions highly favorable to Spain could justly tarnish\r\nthe national honor of the proud and ancient Spanish monarchy. Surely no\r\nperson ever attributed to the first Napoleon a disregard of the national\r\nhonor of France for transferring Louisiana to the United States for\r\na fair equivalent, both in money and commercial advantages.\r\n\r\nWith the Emperor of Austria and the remaining continental powers of\r\nEurope, including that of the Sultan, our relations continue to be of\r\nthe most friendly character.\r\n\r\nThe friendly and peaceful policy pursued by the Government of the United\r\nStates toward the Empire of China has produced the most satisfactory\r\nresults. The treaty of Tien-tsin of the 18th June, 1858, has been\r\nfaithfully observed by the Chinese authorities. The convention of the\r\n8th November, 1858, supplementary to this treaty, for the adjustment\r\nand satisfaction of the claims of our citizens on China referred to in\r\nmy last annual message, has been already carried into effect so far as\r\nthis was practicable. Under this convention the sum of 500,000 taels,\r\nequal to about $700,000, was stipulated to be paid in satisfaction of\r\nthe claims of American citizens out of the one-fifth of the receipts\r\nfor tonnage, import, and export duties on American vessels at the ports\r\nof Canton, Shanghai, and Fuchau, and it was \"agreed that this amount\r\nshall be in full liquidation of all claims of American citizens at the\r\nvarious ports to this date.\" Debentures for this amount, to wit, 300,000\r\ntaels for Canton, 100,000 for Shanghai, and 100,000 for Fuchau, were\r\ndelivered, according to the terms of the convention, by the respective\r\nChinese collectors of the customs of these ports to the agent selected\r\nby our minister to receive the same. Since that time the claims of our\r\ncitizens have been adjusted by the board of commissioners appointed for\r\nthat purpose under the act of March 3, 1859, and their awards, which\r\nproved satisfactory to the claimants, have been approved by our\r\nminister. In the aggregate they amount to the sum of $498,694.78. The\r\nclaimants have already received a large proportion of the sums awarded\r\nto them out of the fund provided, and it is confidently expected that\r\nthe remainder will ere long be entirely paid. After the awards shall\r\nhave been satisfied there will remain a surplus of more than $200,000\r\nat the disposition of Congress. As this will, in equity, belong to the\r\nChinese Government, would not justice require its appropriation to some\r\nbenevolent object in which the Chinese may be specially interested?\r\n\r\nOur minister to China, in obedience to his instructions, has remained\r\nperfectly neutral in the war between Great Britain and France and the\r\nChinese Empire, although, in conjunction with the Russian minister, he\r\nwas ever ready and willing, had the opportunity offered, to employ his\r\ngood offices in restoring peace between the parties. It is but an act of\r\nsimple justice, both to our present minister and his predecessor, to\r\nstate that they have proved fully equal to the delicate, trying, and\r\nresponsible positions in which they have on different occasions been\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the treaty with Japan concluded at Yeddo on the\r\n29th July, 1858, were exchanged at Washington on the 22d May last, and\r\nthe treaty itself was proclaimed on the succeeding day. There is good\r\nreason to expect that under its protection and influence our trade and\r\nintercourse with that distant and interesting people will rapidly\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nThe ratifications of the treaty were exchanged with unusual\r\nsolemnity. For this purpose the Tycoon had accredited three of his\r\nmost distinguished subjects as envoys extraordinary and ministers\r\nplenipotentiary, who were received and treated with marked distinction\r\nand kindness, both by the Government and people of the United States.\r\nThere is every reason to believe that they have returned to their native\r\nland entirely satisfied with their visit and inspired by the most\r\nfriendly feelings for our country. Let us ardently hope, in the language\r\nof the treaty itself, that \"there shall henceforward be perpetual peace\r\nand friendship between the United States of America and His Majesty the\r\nTycoon of Japan and his successors.\"\r\n\r\nWith the wise, conservative, and liberal Government of the Empire of\r\nBrazil our relations continue to be of the most amicable character.\r\n\r\nThe exchange of the ratifications of the convention with the Republic\r\nof New Granada signed at Washington on the 10th of September, 1857, has\r\nbeen long delayed from accidental causes for which neither party is\r\ncensurable. These ratifications were duly exchanged in this city on the\r\n5th of November last. Thus has a controversy been amicably terminated\r\nwhich had become so serious at the period of my inauguration as to\r\nrequire me, on the 17th of April, 1857, to direct our minister to demand\r\nhis passports and return to the United States.\r\n\r\nUnder this convention the Government of New Granada has specially\r\nacknowledged itself to be responsible to our citizens \"for damages\r\nwhich were caused by the riot at Panama on the 15th April, 1856.\" These\r\nclaims, together with other claims of our citizens which had been long\r\nurged in vain, are referred for adjustment to a board of commissioners.\r\nI submit a copy of the convention to Congress, and recommend the\r\nlegislation necessary to carry it into effect.\r\n\r\nPersevering efforts have been made for the adjustment of the claims\r\nof American citizens against the Government of Costa Rica, and I am\r\nhappy to inform you that these have finally prevailed. A convention was\r\nsigned at the city of San Jose on the 2d July last, between the minister\r\nresident of the United States in Costa Rica and the plenipotentiaries of\r\nthat Republic, referring these claims to a board of commissioners and\r\nproviding for the payment of their awards. This convention will be\r\nsubmitted immediately to the Senate for their constitutional action.\r\n\r\nThe claims of our citizens upon the Republic of Nicaragua have not yet\r\nbeen provided for by treaty, although diligent efforts for this purpose\r\nhave been made by our minister resident to that Republic. These are\r\nstill continued, with a fair prospect of success.\r\n\r\nOur relations with Mexico remain in a most unsatisfactory condition.\r\nIn my last two annual messages I discussed extensively the subject of\r\nthese relations, and do not now propose to repeat at length the facts\r\nand arguments then presented. They proved conclusively that our citizens\r\nresiding in Mexico and our merchants trading thereto had suffered a\r\nseries of wrongs and outrages such as we have never patiently borne from\r\nany other nation. For these our successive ministers, invoking the faith\r\nof treaties, had in the name of their country persistently demanded\r\nredress and indemnification, but without the slightest effect. Indeed,\r\nso confident had the Mexican authorities become of our patient endurance\r\nthat they universally believed they might commit these outrages upon\r\nAmerican citizens with absolute impunity. Thus wrote our minister in\r\n1856, and expressed the opinion that \"nothing but a manifestation of\r\nthe power of the Government and of its purpose to punish these wrongs\r\nwill avail.\"\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in 1857, came the adoption of a new constitution for Mexico,\r\nthe election of a President and Congress under its provisions, and the\r\ninauguration of the President. Within one short month, however, this\r\nPresident was expelled from the capital by a rebellion in the army, and\r\nthe supreme power of the Republic was assigned to General Zuloaga. This\r\nusurper was in his turn soon compelled to retire and give place to\r\nGeneral Miramon.\r\n\r\nUnder the constitution which had thus been adopted Señor Juarez, as\r\nchief justice of the supreme court, became the lawful President of the\r\nRepublic, and it was for the maintenance of the constitution and his\r\nauthority derived from it that the civil war commenced and still\r\ncontinues to be prosecuted.\r\n\r\nThroughout the year 1858 the constitutional party grew stronger and\r\nstronger. In the previous history of Mexico a successful military\r\nrevolution at the capital had almost universally been the signal for\r\nsubmission throughout the Republic. Not so on the present occasion.\r\nA majority of the citizens persistently sustained the constitutional\r\nGovernment. When this was recognized, in April, 1859, by the Government\r\nof the United States, its authority extended over a large majority of\r\nthe Mexican States and people, including Vera Cruz and all the other\r\nimportant seaports of the Republic. From that period our commerce with\r\nMexico began to revive, and the constitutional Government has afforded\r\nit all the protection in its power.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Government of Miramon still held sway at the capital and\r\nover the surrounding country, and continued its outrages against the\r\nfew American citizens who still had the courage to remain within its\r\npower. To cap the climax, after the battle of Tacubaya, in April, 1859,\r\nGeneral Marquez ordered three citizens of the United States, two of them\r\nphysicians, to be seized in the hospital at that place, taken out and\r\nshot, without crime and without trial. This was done, notwithstanding\r\nour unfortunate countrymen were at the moment engaged in the holy cause\r\nof affording relief to the soldiers of both parties who had been wounded\r\nin the battle, without making any distinction between them.\r\n\r\nThe time had arrived, in my opinion, when this Government was bound\r\nto exert its power to avenge and redress the wrongs of our citizens\r\nand to afford them protection in Mexico. The interposing obstacle was\r\nthat the portion of the country under the sway of Miramon could not be\r\nreached without passing over territory under the jurisdiction of the\r\nconstitutional Government. Under these circumstances I deemed it my duty\r\nto recommend to Congress in my last annual message the employment of\r\na sufficient military force to penetrate into the interior, where the\r\nGovernment of Miramon was to be found, with or, if need be, without the\r\nconsent of the Juarez Government, though it was not doubted that this\r\nconsent could be obtained. Never have I had a clearer conviction on\r\nany subject than of the justice as well as wisdom of such a policy.\r\nNo other alternative was left except the entire abandonment of our\r\nfellow-citizens who had gone to Mexico under the faith of treaties\r\nto the systematic injustice, cruelty, and oppression of Miramon's\r\nGovernment. Besides, it is almost certain that the simple authority\r\nto employ this force would of itself have accomplished all our objects\r\nwithout striking a single blow. The constitutional Government would then\r\nere this have been established at the City of Mexico, and would have\r\nbeen ready and willing to the extent of its ability to do us justice.\r\n\r\nIn addition--and I deem this a most important consideration--European\r\nGovernments would have been deprived of all pretext to interfere in the\r\nterritorial and domestic concerns of Mexico. We should thus have been\r\nrelieved from the obligation of resisting, even by force should this\r\nbecome necessary, any attempt by these Governments to deprive our\r\nneighboring Republic of portions of her territory--a duty from which\r\nwe could not shrink without abandoning the traditional and established\r\npolicy of the American people. I am happy to observe that, firmly\r\nrelying upon the justice and good faith of these Governments, there\r\nis no present danger that such a contingency will happen.\r\n\r\nHaving discovered that my recommendations would not be sustained by\r\nCongress, the next alternative was to accomplish in some degree,\r\nif possible, the same objects by treaty stipulations with the\r\nconstitutional Government. Such treaties were accordingly concluded\r\nby our late able and excellent minister to Mexico, and on the 4th of\r\nJanuary last were submitted to the Senate for ratification. As these\r\nhave not yet received the final action of that body, it would be\r\nimproper for me to present a detailed statement of their provisions.\r\nStill, I may be permitted to express the opinion in advance that they\r\nare calculated to promote the agricultural, manufacturing, and\r\ncommercial interests of the country and to secure our just influence\r\nwith an adjoining Republic as to whose fortunes and fate we can never\r\nfeel indifferent, whilst at the same time they provide for the payment\r\nof a considerable amount toward the satisfaction of the claims of our\r\ninjured fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nAt the period of my inauguration I was confronted in Kansas by a\r\nrevolutionary government existing under what is called the \"Topeka\r\nconstitution.\" Its avowed object was to subdue the Territorial\r\ngovernment by force and to inaugurate what was called the \"Topeka\r\ngovernment\" in its stead. To accomplish this object an extensive\r\nmilitary organization was formed, and its command intrusted to the most\r\nviolent revolutionary leaders. Under these circumstances it became my\r\nimperative duty to exert the whole constitutional power of the Executive\r\nto prevent the flames of civil war from again raging in Kansas, which in\r\nthe excited state of the public mind, both North and South, might have\r\nextended into the neighboring States. The hostile parties in Kansas had\r\nbeen inflamed against each other by emissaries both from the North and\r\nthe South to a degree of malignity without parallel in our history.\r\nTo prevent actual collision and to assist the civil magistrates in\r\nenforcing the laws, a strong detachment of the Army was stationed in\r\nthe Territory, ready to aid the marshal and his deputies when lawfully\r\ncalled upon as a _posse comilatus_ in the execution of civil and\r\ncriminal process. Still, the troubles in Kansas could not have been\r\npermanently settled without an election by the people.\r\n\r\nThe ballot box is the surest arbiter of disputes among freemen. Under\r\nthis conviction every proper effort was employed to induce the hostile\r\nparties to vote at the election of delegates to frame a State\r\nconstitution, and afterwards at the election to decide whether Kansas\r\nshould be a slave or free State.\r\n\r\nThe insurgent party refused to vote at either, lest this might be\r\nconsidered a recognition on their part of the Territorial government\r\nestablished by Congress. A better spirit, however, seemed soon after\r\nto prevail, and the two parties met face to face at the third election,\r\nheld on the first Monday of January, 1858, for members of the\r\nlegislature and State officers under the Lecompton constitution. The\r\nresult was the triumph of the antislavery party at the polls. This\r\ndecision of the ballot box proved clearly that this party were in the\r\nmajority, and removed the danger of civil war. From that time we have\r\nheard little or nothing of the Topeka government, and all serious danger\r\nof revolutionary troubles in Kansas was then at an end.\r\n\r\nThe Lecompton constitution, which had been thus recognized at this State\r\nelection by the votes of both political parties in Kansas, was\r\ntransmitted to me with the request that I should present it to Congress.\r\nThis I could not have refused to do without violating my clearest and\r\nstrongest convictions of duty. The constitution and all the proceedings\r\nwhich preceded and followed its formation were fair and regular on their\r\nface. I then believed, and experience has proved, that the interests of\r\nthe people of Kansas would have been best consulted by its admission\r\nas a State into the Union, especially as the majority within a brief\r\nperiod could have amended the constitution according to their will and\r\npleasure. If fraud existed in all or any of these proceedings, it was\r\nnot for the President but for Congress to investigate and determine the\r\nquestion of fraud and what ought to be its consequences. If at the first\r\ntwo elections the majority refused to vote, it can not be pretended\r\nthat this refusal to exercise the elective franchise could invalidate\r\nan election fairly held under lawful authority, even if they had not\r\nsubsequently voted at the third election. It is true that the whole\r\nconstitution had not been submitted to the people, as I always desired;\r\nbut the precedents are numerous of the admission of States into the\r\nUnion without such submission. It would not comport with my present\r\npurpose to review the proceedings of Congress upon the Lecompton\r\nconstitution. It is sufficient to observe that their final action has\r\nremoved the last vestige of serious revolutionary troubles. The\r\ndesperate band recently assembled under a notorious outlaw in the\r\nsouthern portion of the Territory to resist the execution of the laws\r\nand to plunder peaceful citizens will, I doubt not, be speedily subdued\r\nand brought to justice.\r\n\r\nHad I treated the Lecompton constitution as a nullity and refused\r\nto transmit it to Congress, it is not difficult to imagine, whilst\r\nrecalling the position of the country at that moment, what would have\r\nbeen the disastrous consequences, both in and out of the Territory,\r\nfrom such a dereliction of duty on the part of the Executive.\r\n\r\nPeace has also been restored within the Territory of Utah, which at the\r\ncommencement of my Administration was in a state of open rebellion. This\r\nwas the more dangerous, as the people, animated by a fanatical spirit\r\nand intrenched within their distant mountain fastnesses, might have made\r\na long and formidable resistance. Cost what it might, it was necessary\r\nto bring them into subjection to the Constitution and the laws. Sound\r\npolicy, therefore, as well as humanity, required that this object should\r\nif possible be accomplished without the effusion of blood. This could\r\nonly be effected by sending a military force into the Territory\r\nsufficiently strong to convince the people that resistance would be\r\nhopeless, and at the same time to offer them a pardon for past offenses\r\non condition of immediate submission to the Government. This policy was\r\npursued with eminent success, and the only cause for regret is the heavy\r\nexpenditure required to march a large detachment of the Army to that\r\nremote region and to furnish it subsistence.\r\n\r\nUtah is now comparatively peaceful and quiet, and the military force has\r\nbeen withdrawn, except that portion of it necessary to keep the Indians\r\nin check and to protect the emigrant trains on their way to our Pacific\r\npossessions.\r\n\r\nIn my first annual message I promised to employ my best exertions in\r\ncooperation with Congress to reduce the expenditures of the Government\r\nwithin the limits of a wise and judicious economy. An overflowing\r\nTreasury had produced habits of prodigality and extravagance which could\r\nonly be gradually corrected. The work required both time and patience.\r\nI applied myself diligently to this task from the beginning and was\r\naided by the able and energetic efforts of the heads of the different\r\nExecutive Departments. The result of our labors in this good cause did\r\nnot appear in the sum total of our expenditures for the first two years,\r\nmainly in consequence of the extraordinary expenditure necessarily\r\nincurred in the Utah expedition and the very large amount of the\r\ncontingent expenses of Congress during this period. These greatly\r\nexceeded the pay and mileage of the members. For the year ending June\r\n30, 1858, whilst the pay and mileage amounted to $1,490,214, the\r\ncontingent expenses rose to $2,093,309.79; and for the year ending\r\nJune 30, 1859, whilst the pay and mileage amounted to $859,093.66, the\r\ncontingent expenses amounted to $1,431,565.78. I am happy, however,\r\nto be able to inform you that during the last fiscal year, ending\r\nJune 30, 1860, the total expenditures of the Government in all its\r\nbranches--legislative, executive, and judicial--exclusive of the public\r\ndebt, were reduced to the sum of $55,402,465.46. This conclusively\r\nappears from the books of the Treasury. In the year ending June 30,\r\n1858, the total expenditure, exclusive of the public debt, amounted\r\nto $71,901,129.77, and that for the year ending June 30, 1859, to\r\n$66,346,226.13. Whilst the books of the Treasury show an actual\r\nexpenditure of $59,848,474.72 for the year ending June 30, 1860,\r\nincluding $1,040,667.71 for the contingent expenses of Congress, there\r\nmust be deducted from this amount the sum of $4,296,009.26, with the\r\ninterest upon it of $150,000, appropriated by the act of February 15,\r\n1860, \"for the purpose of supplying the deficiency in the revenues and\r\ndefraying the expenses of the Post-Office Department for the year ending\r\nJune 30, 1859.\" This sum, therefore, justly chargeable to the year 1859,\r\nmust be deducted from the sum of $59,848,474.72 in order to ascertain\r\nthe expenditure for the year ending June 30, 1860, which leaves a\r\nbalance for the expenditures of that year of $55,402,465.46. The\r\ninterest on the public debt, including Treasury notes, for the same\r\nfiscal year, ending June 30, 1860, amounted to $3,177,314.62, which,\r\nadded to the above sum of $55,402,465.46, makes the aggregate\r\nof $58,579,780.08.\r\n\r\nIt ought in justice to be observed that several of the estimates from\r\nthe Departments for the year ending June 30, 1860, were reduced by\r\nCongress below what was and still is deemed compatible with the public\r\ninterest. Allowing a liberal margin of $2,500,000 for this reduction and\r\nfor other causes, it may be safely asserted that the sum of $61,000,000,\r\nor, at the most, $62,000,000, is amply sufficient to administer the\r\nGovernment and to pay the interest on the public debt, unless contingent\r\nevents should hereafter render extraordinary expenditures necessary.\r\n\r\nThis result has been attained in a considerable degree by the care\r\nexercised by the appropriate Departments in entering into public\r\ncontracts. I have myself never interfered with the award of any such\r\ncontract, except in a single case, with the Colonization Society,\r\ndeeming it advisable to cast the whole responsibility in each case on\r\nthe proper head of the Department, with the general instruction that\r\nthese contracts should always be given to the lowest and best bidder.\r\nIt has ever been my opinion that public contracts are not a legitimate\r\nsource of patronage to be conferred upon personal or political\r\nfavorites, but that in all such cases a public officer is bound to\r\nact for the Government as a prudent individual would act for himself.\r\n\r\nIt is with great satisfaction I communicate the fact that since the date\r\nof my last annual message not a single slave has been imported into\r\nthe United States in violation of the laws prohibiting the African\r\nslave trade. This statement is founded upon a thorough examination and\r\ninvestigation of the subject. Indeed, the spirit which prevailed some\r\ntime since among a portion of our fellow-citizens in favor of this\r\ntrade seems to have entirely subsided.\r\n\r\nI also congratulate you upon the public sentiment which now exists\r\nagainst the crime of setting on foot military expeditions within the\r\nlimits of the United States to proceed from thence and make war upon\r\nthe people of unoffending States with whom we are at peace. In this\r\nrespect a happy change has been effected since the commencement of my\r\nAdministration. It surely ought to be the prayer of every Christian\r\nand patriot that such expeditions may never again receive countenance\r\nin our country or depart from our shores.\r\n\r\nIt would be a useless repetition to do more than refer with earnest\r\ncommendation to my former recommendations in favor of the Pacific\r\nrailroad; of the grant of power to the President to employ the naval\r\nforce in the vicinity for the protection of the lives and property\r\nof our fellow-citizens passing in transit over the different Central\r\nAmerican routes against sudden and lawless outbreaks and depredations,\r\nand also to protect American merchant vessels, their crews and cargoes,\r\nagainst violent and unlawful seizure and confiscation in the ports of\r\nMexico and the South American Republics when these may be in a disturbed\r\nand revolutionary condition. It is my settled conviction that without\r\nsuch a power we do not afford that protection to those engaged in the\r\ncommerce of the country which they have a right to demand.\r\n\r\nI again recommend to Congress the passage of a law, in pursuance of\r\nthe provisions of the Constitution, appointing a day certain previous\r\nto the 4th March in each year of an odd number for the election of\r\nRepresentatives throughout all the States. A similar power has already\r\nbeen exercised, with general approbation, in the appointment of the\r\nsame day throughout the Union for holding the election of electors for\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the United States. My attention was\r\nearnestly directed to this subject from the fact that the Thirty-fifth\r\nCongress terminated on the 3d March, 1859, without making the necessary\r\nappropriation for the service of the Post-Office Department. I was then\r\nforced to consider the best remedy for this omission, and an immediate\r\ncall of the present Congress was the natural resort. Upon inquiry,\r\nhowever, I ascertained that fifteen out of the thirty-three States\r\ncomposing the Confederacy were without Representatives, and that\r\nconsequently these fifteen States would be disfranchised by such a call.\r\nThese fifteen States will be in the same condition on the 4th March\r\nnext. Ten of them can not elect Representatives, according to existing\r\nState laws, until different periods, extending from the beginning\r\nof August next until the months of October and November. In my last\r\nmessage I gave warning that in a time of sudden and alarming danger\r\nthe salvation of our institutions might depend upon the power of the\r\nPresident immediately to assemble a full Congress to meet the emergency.\r\n\r\nIt is now quite evident that the financial necessities of the Government\r\nwill require a modification of the tariff during your present session\r\nfor the purpose of increasing the revenue. In this aspect, I desire to\r\nreiterate the recommendation contained in my last two annual messages\r\nin favor of imposing specific instead of _ad valorem_ duties on all\r\nimported articles to which these can be properly applied. From long\r\nobservation and experience I am convinced that specific duties\r\nare necessary, both to protect the revenue and to secure to our\r\nmanufacturing interests that amount of incidental encouragement\r\nwhich unavoidably results from a revenue tariff.\r\n\r\nAs an abstract proposition it may be admitted that _ad valorem_ duties\r\nwould in theory be the most just and equal. But if the experience of\r\nthis and of all other commercial nations has demonstrated that such\r\nduties can not be assessed and collected without great frauds upon the\r\nrevenue, then it is the part of wisdom to resort to specific duties.\r\nIndeed, from the very nature of an _ad valorem_ duty this must be the\r\nresult. Under it the inevitable consequence is that foreign goods will\r\nbe entered at less than their true value. The Treasury will therefore\r\nlose the duty on the difference between their real and fictitious value,\r\nand to this extent we are defrauded.\r\n\r\nThe temptations which _ad valorem_ duties present to a dishonest\r\nimporter are irresistible. His object is to pass his goods through the\r\ncustom-house at the very lowest valuation necessary to save them from\r\nconfiscation. In this he too often succeeds in spite of the vigilance,\r\nof the revenue officers. Hence the resort to false invoices, one for the\r\npurchaser and another for the custom-house, and to other expedients to\r\ndefraud the Government. The honest importer produces his invoice to the\r\ncollector, stating the actual price, at which he purchased the articles\r\nabroad. Not so the dishonest importer and the agent of the foreign\r\nmanufacturer. And here it may be observed that a very large proportion\r\nof the manufactures imported from abroad are consigned for sale to\r\ncommission merchants, who are mere agents employed by the manufacturers.\r\nIn such cases no actual sale has been made to fix their value. The\r\nforeign manufacturer, if he be dishonest, prepares an invoice of the\r\ngoods, not at their actual value, but at the very lowest rate necessary\r\nto escape detection. In this manner the dishonest importer and the\r\nforeign manufacturer enjoy a decided advantage over the honest merchant.\r\nThey are thus enabled to undersell the fair trader and drive him from\r\nthe market. In fact the operation of this system has already driven from\r\nthe pursuits of honorable commerce many of that class of regular and\r\nconscientious merchants whose character throughout the world is the\r\npride of our country.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for these evils, is to be found in specific duties, so\r\nfar as this may be practicable. They dispense with any inquiry at the\r\ncustom-house into the actual cost or value of the article, and it pays\r\nthe precise amount of duty previously fixed by law. They present no\r\ntemptations to the appraisers of foreign goods, who receive but small\r\nsalaries, and might by undervaluation in a few cases render themselves\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nBesides, specific duties best conform to the requisition in the\r\nConstitution that \"no preference shall be given by any regulation of\r\ncommerce or revenue to the ports of one State over those of another.\"\r\nUnder our _ad valorem_ system such preferences are to some extent\r\ninevitable, and complaints have often been made that the spirit of this\r\nprovision has been violated by a lower appraisement of the same articles\r\nat one port than at another.\r\n\r\nAn impression strangely enough prevails to some extent that specific\r\nduties are necessarily protective duties. Nothing can be more\r\nfallacious. Great Britain glories in free trade, and yet her whole\r\nrevenue from imports is at the present moment collected under a system\r\nof specific duties. It is a striking fact in this connection that in the\r\ncommercial treaty of January 23, 1860, between France and England one\r\nof the articles provides that the _ad valorem_ duties which it imposes\r\nshall be converted into specific duties within six months from its date,\r\nand these are to be ascertained by making an average of the prices for\r\nsix months previous to that time. The reverse of the propositions would\r\nbe nearer to the truth, because a much larger amount of revenue would be\r\ncollected by merely converting the _ad valorem_ duties of a tariff into\r\nequivalent specific duties. To this extent the revenue would be\r\nincreased, and in the same proportion the specific duty might be\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nSpecific duties would secure to the American manufacturer the incidental\r\nprotection to which he is fairly entitled under a revenue tariff, and to\r\nthis surely no person would object. The framers of the existing tariff\r\nhave gone further, and in a liberal spirit have discriminated in favor\r\nof large and useful branches of our manufactures, not by raising the\r\nrate of duty upon the importation of similar articles from abroad, but,\r\nwhat is the same in effect, by admitting articles free of duty which\r\nenter into the composition of their fabrics.\r\n\r\nUnder the present system it has been often truly remarked that this\r\nincidental protection decreases when the manufacturer needs it most and\r\nincreases when he needs it least, and constitutes a sliding scale which\r\nalways operates against him. The revenues of the country are subject to\r\nsimilar fluctuations. Instead of approaching a steady standard, as would\r\nbe the case under a system of specific duties, they sink and rise with\r\nthe sinking and rising prices of articles in foreign countries. It would\r\nnot be difficult for Congress to arrange a system of specific duties\r\nwhich would afford additional stability both to our revenue and our\r\nmanufactures and without injury or injustice to any interest of the\r\ncountry. This might be accomplished by ascertaining the average value of\r\nany given article for a series of years at the place of exportation and\r\nby simply converting the rate of _ad valorem_ duty upon it which might\r\nbe deemed necessary for revenue purposes into the form of a specific\r\nduty. Such an arrangement could not injure the consumer. If he should\r\npay a greater amount of duty one year, this would be counterbalanced by\r\na lesser amount the next, and in the end the aggregate would be the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nI desire to call your immediate attention to the present condition\r\nof the Treasury, so ably and clearly presented by the Secretary in\r\nhis report to Congress, and to recommend that measures be promptly\r\nadopted to enable it to discharge its pressing obligations. The other\r\nrecommendations of the report are well worthy of your favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to Congress the reports of the Secretaries of War,\r\nof the Navy, of the Interior, and of the Postmaster-General. The\r\nrecommendations and suggestions which they contain are highly valuable\r\nand deserve your careful attention.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Postmaster-General details the circumstances under\r\nwhich Cornelius Vanderbilt, on my request, agreed in the month of July\r\nlast to carry the ocean mails between our Atlantic and Pacific coasts.\r\nHad he not thus acted this important intercommunication must have been\r\nsuspended, at least for a season. The Postmaster-General had no power\r\nto make him any other compensation than the postages on the mail matter\r\nwhich he might carry. It was known at the time that these postages would\r\nfall far short of an adequate compensation, as well as of the sum which\r\nthe same service had previously cost the Government. Mr. Vanderbilt, in\r\na commendable spirit, was willing to rely upon the justice of Congress\r\nto make up the deficiency, and I therefore recommend that an\r\nappropriation may be granted for this purpose.\r\n\r\nI should do great injustice to the Attorney-General were I to omit\r\nthe mention of his distinguished services in the measures adopted and\r\nprosecuted by him for the defense of the Government against numerous and\r\nunfounded claims to land in California purporting to have been made by\r\nthe Mexican Government previous to the treaty of cession. The successful\r\nopposition to these claims has saved the United States public property\r\nworth many millions of dollars and to individuals holding title under\r\nthem to at least an equal amount.\r\n\r\nIt has been represented to me from sources which I deem reliable that\r\nthe inhabitants in several portions of Kansas have been reduced nearly\r\nto a state of starvation on account of the almost total failure of their\r\ncrops, whilst the harvests in every other portion of the country have\r\nbeen abundant. The prospect before them for the approaching winter is\r\nwell calculated to enlist the sympathies of every heart. The destitution\r\nappears to be so general that it can not be relieved by private\r\ncontributions, and they are in such indigent circumstances as to be\r\nunable to purchase the necessaries of life for themselves. I refer the\r\nsubject to Congress, If any constitutional measure for their relief can\r\nbe devised, I would recommend its adoption.\r\n\r\nI cordially commend to your favorable regard the interests of the people\r\nof this District. They are eminently entitled to your consideration,\r\nespecially since, unlike the people of the States, they can appeal to\r\nno government except that of the Union.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit, for the consideration of the Senate with a view to\r\nratification, a convention for the adjustment of claims of citizens of\r\nthe United States against the Government of the Republic of Costa Rica,\r\nsigned by the plenipotentiaries of the contracting parties at San Jose\r\non the 2d day of July last.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _December 5, 1860_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 9th\r\nof April last, requesting information concerning the African slave\r\ntrade, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the documents\r\nby which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 2, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to\r\nratification, a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, and for the\r\nsurrender of fugitive criminals, between the United States and the\r\nRepublic of Venezuela, signed at Caracas on the 27th of August last.\r\n\r\nA similar treaty was concluded on the 10th July, 1856, was submitted\r\nto the Senate, and was by a resolution of that body approved, with an\r\namendment, on the 10th March, 1857. Before this amendment could be laid\r\nbefore the Government of Venezuela for acceptance a new minister of the\r\nUnited States was accredited to that Government. Meantime the attention\r\nof this Government had been drawn to the disadvantage which would result\r\nto our citizens residing in Venezuela if the second article of the\r\ntreaty of 1856 were permitted to go into effect, the \"pecuniary\r\nequivalent\" for exemption from military duty being an arbitrary and\r\ngenerally an excessive sum. In view of this fact it was deemed\r\npreferable to instruct our new minister to negotiate a new treaty which\r\nshould omit the objectionable second article and also the few words of\r\nthe twenty-eighth article which had been stricken out by the Senate.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, and with the addition of the last clause to the\r\ntwenty-seventh article, the treaty is the same as that already approved\r\nby the Senate.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 8, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nAt the opening of your present session I called your attention to the\r\ndangers which threatened the existence of the Union. I expressed my\r\nopinion freely concerning the original causes of those dangers, and\r\nrecommended such measures as I believed would have the effect of\r\ntranquilizing the country and saving it from the peril in which it had\r\nbeen needlessly and most unfortunately involved. Those opinions and\r\nrecommendations I do not propose now to repeat. My own convictions upon\r\nthe whole subject remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a great calamity was impending over the nation was even at\r\nthat time acknowledged by every intelligent citizen. It had already made\r\nitself felt throughout the length and breadth of the land. The necessary\r\nconsequences of the alarm thus produced were most deplorable. The\r\nimports fell off with a rapidity never known before, except in time\r\nof war, in the history of our foreign commerce; the Treasury was\r\nunexpectedly left without the means which it had reasonably counted upon\r\nto meet the public engagements; trade was paralyzed; manufactures were\r\nstopped; the best public securities suddenly sunk in the market; every\r\nspecies of property depreciated more or less, and thousands of poor men\r\nwho depended upon their daily labor for their daily bread were turned\r\nout of employment.\r\n\r\nI deeply regret that I am not able to give you any information upon the\r\nstate of the Union which is more satisfactory than what I was then\r\nobliged to communicate. On the contrary, matters are still worse at\r\npresent than they then were. When Congress met, a strong hope pervaded\r\nthe whole public mind that some amicable adjustment of the subject would\r\nspeedily be made by the representatives of the States and of the people\r\nwhich might restore peace between the conflicting sections of the\r\ncountry. That hope has been diminished by every hour of delay, and as\r\nthe prospect of a bloodless settlement fades away the public distress\r\nbecomes more and more aggravated. As evidence of this it is only\r\nnecessary to say that the Treasury notes authorized by the act of 17th\r\nof December last were advertised according to the law and that no\r\nresponsible bidder offered to take any considerable sum at par at a\r\nlower rate of interest than 12 per cent. From these facts it appears\r\nthat in a government organized like ours domestic strife, or even a\r\nwell-grounded fear of civil hostilities, is more destructive to our\r\npublic and private interests than the most formidable foreign war.\r\n\r\nIn my annual message I expressed the conviction, which I have long\r\ndeliberately held, and which recent reflection has only tended to deepen\r\nand confirm, that no State has a right by its own act to secede from the\r\nUnion or throw off its federal obligations at pleasure. I also declared\r\nmy opinion to be that even if that right existed and should be exercised\r\nby any State of the Confederacy the executive department of this\r\nGovernment had no authority under the Constitution to recognize its\r\nvalidity by acknowledging the independence of such State. This left me\r\nno alternative, as the chief executive officer under the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, but to collect the public revenues and to protect the\r\npublic property so far as this might be practicable under existing laws.\r\nThis is still my purpose. My province is to execute and not to make the\r\nlaws. It belongs to Congress exclusively to repeal, to modify, or to\r\nenlarge their provisions to meet exigencies as they may occur. I possess\r\nno dispensing power.\r\n\r\nI certainly had no right to make aggressive war upon any State, and\r\nI am perfectly satisfied that the Constitution has wisely withheld that\r\npower even from Congress. But the right and the duty to use military\r\nforce defensively against those who resist the Federal officers in the\r\nexecution of their legal functions and against those who assail the\r\nproperty of the Federal Government is clear and undeniable.\r\n\r\nBut the dangerous and hostile attitude of the States toward each other\r\nhas already far transcended and cast in the shade the ordinary executive\r\nduties already provided for by law, and has assumed such vast and\r\nalarming proportions as to place the subject entirely above and beyond\r\nExecutive control. The fact can not be disguised that we are in the\r\nmidst of a great revolution. In all its various bearings, therefore,\r\nI commend the question to Congress as the only human tribunal under\r\nProvidence possessing the power to meet the existing emergency. To\r\nthem exclusively belongs the power to declare war or to authorize\r\nthe employment of military force in all cases contemplated by the\r\nConstitution, and they alone possess the power to remove grievances\r\nwhich might lead to war and to secure peace and union to this distracted\r\ncountry. On them, and on them alone, rests the responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe Union is a sacred trust left by our Revolutionary fathers to their\r\ndescendants, and never did any other people inherit so rich a legacy.\r\nIt has rendered us prosperous in peace and triumphant in war. The\r\nnational flag has floated in glory over every sea. Under its shadow\r\nAmerican citizens have found protection and respect in all lands beneath\r\nthe sun. If we descend to considerations of purely material interest,\r\nwhen in the history of all time has a confederacy been bound together\r\nby such strong ties of mutual interest? Each portion of it is dependent\r\non all and all upon each portion for prosperity and domestic security.\r\nFree trade throughout the whole supplies the wants of one portion from\r\nthe productions of another and scatters wealth everywhere. The great\r\nplanting and farming States require the aid of the commercial and\r\nnavigating States to send their productions to domestic and foreign\r\nmarkets and to furnish the naval power to render their transportation\r\nsecure against all hostile attacks.\r\n\r\nShould the Union perish in the midst of the present excitement, we have\r\nalready had a sad foretaste of the universal suffering which would\r\nresult from its destruction. The calamity would be severe in every\r\nportion of the Union and would be quite as great, to say the least, in\r\nthe Southern as in the Northern States. The greatest aggravation of the\r\nevil, and that which would place us in the most unfavorable light both\r\nbefore the world and posterity, is, as I am firmly convinced, that the\r\nsecession movement has been chiefly based upon a misapprehension at the\r\nSouth of the sentiments of the majority in several of the Northern\r\nStates. Let the question be transferred from political assemblies to\r\nthe ballot box, and the people themselves would speedily redress the\r\nserious grievances which the South have suffered. But, in Heaven's name,\r\nlet the trial be made before we plunge into armed conflict upon the\r\nmere assumption that there is no other alternative. Time is a great\r\nconservative power. Let us pause at this momentous point and afford the\r\npeople, both North and South, an opportunity for reflection. Would that\r\nSouth Carolina had been convinced of this truth before her precipitate\r\naction! I therefore appeal through you to the people of the country to\r\ndeclare in their might that the Union must and shall be preserved by\r\nall constitutional means. I most earnestly recommend that you devote\r\nyourselves exclusively to the question how this can be accomplished\r\nin peace. All other questions, when compared to this, sink into\r\ninsignificance. The present is no time for palliations. Action, prompt\r\naction, is required. A delay in Congress to prescribe or to recommend\r\na distinct and practical proposition for conciliation may drive us to\r\na point from which it will be almost impossible to recede.\r\n\r\nA common ground on which conciliation and harmony can be produced is\r\nsurely not unattainable. The proposition to compromise by letting the\r\nNorth have exclusive control of the territory above a certain line\r\nand to give Southern institutions protection below that line ought to\r\nreceive universal approbation. In itself, indeed, it may not be entirely\r\nsatisfactory, but when the alternative is between a reasonable\r\nconcession on both sides and a destruction of the Union it is an\r\nimputation upon the patriotism of Congress to assert that its members\r\nwill hesitate for a moment.\r\n\r\nEven now the danger is upon us. In several of the States which have not\r\nyet seceded the forts, arsenals, and magazines of the United States have\r\nbeen seized. This is by far the most serious step which has been taken\r\nsince the commencement of the troubles. This public property has long\r\nbeen left without garrisons and troops for its protection, because no\r\nperson doubted its security under the flag of the country in any State\r\nof the Union. Besides, our small Army has scarcely been sufficient to\r\nguard our remote frontiers against Indian incursions. The seizure of\r\nthis property, from all appearances, has been purely aggressive, and not\r\nin resistance to any attempt to coerce a State or States to remain in\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of these unhappy troubles I determined that no act of\r\nmine should increase the excitement in either section of the country. If\r\nthe political conflict were to end in a civil war, it was my determined\r\npurpose not to commence it nor even to furnish an excuse for it by any\r\nact of this Government. My opinion remains unchanged that justice as\r\nwell as sound policy requires us still to seek a peaceful solution of\r\nthe questions at issue between the North and the South. Entertaining\r\nthis conviction, I refrained even from sending reenforcements to Major\r\nAnderson, who commanded the forts in Charleston Harbor, until an\r\nabsolute necessity for doing so should make itself apparent, lest it\r\nmight unjustly be regarded as a menace of military coercion, and thus\r\nfurnish, if not a provocation, at least a pretext for an outbreak on the\r\npart of South Carolina. No necessity for these reenforcements seemed to\r\nexist. I was assured by distinguished and upright gentlemen of South\r\nCarolina that no attack upon Major Anderson was intended, but that, on\r\nthe contrary, it was the desire of the State authorities as much as it\r\nwas my own to avoid the fatal consequences which must eventually follow\r\na military collision.\r\n\r\nAnd here I deem it proper to submit for your information copies of\r\na communication, dated December 28, 1860, addressed to me by R.W.\r\nBarnwell, J.H. Adams, and James L. Orr, \"commissioners\" from South\r\nCarolina, with the accompanying documents, and copies of my answer\r\nthereto, dated December 31.\r\n\r\nIn further explanation of Major Anderson's removal from Fort Moultrie\r\nto Fort Sumter, it is proper to state that after my answer to the South\r\nCarolina \"commissioners\" the War Department received a letter from that\r\ngallant officer, dated on the 27th of December, 1860, the day after this\r\nmovement, from which the following is an extract:\r\n\r\nI will add as my opinion that many things convinced me that the\r\nauthorities of the State designed to proceed to a hostile act.\r\n\r\nEvidently referring to the orders, dated December 11, of the late\r\nSecretary of War.\r\n\r\nUnder this impression I could not hesitate that it was my solemn duty to\r\nmove my command from a fort which we could not probably have held longer\r\nthan forty-eight or sixty hours to this one, where my power of\r\nresistance is increased to a very great degree.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the concluding part of these orders was in\r\nthe following terms:\r\n\r\nThe smallness of your force will not permit you, perhaps, to occupy\r\nmore than one of the three forts, but an attack on or attempt to\r\ntake possession of either one of them will be regarded as an act of\r\nhostility, and you may then put your command into either of them which\r\nyou may deem most proper to increase its power of resistance. You are\r\nalso authorized to take similar defensive steps whenever you have\r\ntangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act.\r\n\r\nIt is said that serious apprehensions are to some extent entertained (in\r\nwhich I do not share) that the peace of this District may be disturbed\r\nbefore the 4th of March next. In any event, it will be my duty to\r\npreserve it, and this duty shall be performed.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be permitted to me to remark that I have often\r\nwarned my countrymen of the dangers which now surround us. This may be\r\nthe last time I shall refer to the subject officially. I feel that my\r\nduty has been faithfully, though it may be imperfectly, performed, and,\r\nwhatever the result may be, I shall carry to my grave the consciousness\r\nthat I at least meant well for my country.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 15, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate passed on the 10th\r\ninstant, requesting me to inform that body, if not incompatible with the\r\npublic interest, \"whether John B. Floyd, whose appointment as Secretary\r\nof War was confirmed by the Senate on the 6th of March, 1857, still\r\ncontinues to hold said office, and, if not, when and how said office\r\nbecame vacant; and, further, to inform the Senate how and by whom the\r\nduties of said office are now discharged, and, if an appointment of an\r\nacting or provisional Secretary of War has been made, how, when, and by\r\nwhat authority it was so made, and why the fact of said appointment has\r\nnot been communicated to the Senate,\" I have to inform the Senate that\r\nJohn B. Floyd, the late Secretary of the War Department, resigned that\r\noffice on the 29th day of December last, and that on the 1st day of\r\nJanuary instant Joseph Holt was authorized by me to perform the duties\r\nof the said office until a successor should be appointed or the vacancy\r\nfilled. Under this authority the duties of the War Department have been\r\nperformed by Mr. Holt from the day last mentioned to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe power to carry on the business of the Government by means of a\r\nprovisional appointment when a vacancy occurs is expressly given by the\r\nact of February 13, 1795, which enacts--\r\n\r\n  That in case of vacancy in the office of Secretary of State,\r\n  Secretary of the Treasury, or of the Secretary of the Department\r\n  of War, or of any officer of either of the said Departments whose\r\n  appointment is not in the head thereof, whereby they can not perform\r\n  the duties of their respective offices, it shall be lawful for the\r\n  President of the United States, in case he shall think it necessary,\r\n  to authorize any person or persons, at his discretion, to perform the\r\n  duties of the said respective offices until a successor be appointed\r\n  or such vacancy be filled: _Provided_, That no one vacancy shall be\r\n  supplied in manner aforesaid for a longer period than six months.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that if the power which this law gives had been withheld\r\nthe public interest would frequently suffer very serious detriment.\r\nVacancies may occur at any time in the most important offices which can\r\nnot be immediately and permanently filled in a manner satisfactory to\r\nthe appointing power. It was wise to make a provision which would enable\r\nthe President to avoid a total suspension of business in the interval,\r\nand equally wise so to limit the Executive discretion as to prevent any\r\nserious abuse of it. This is what the framers of the act of 1795 did,\r\nand neither the policy nor the constitutional validity of their law has\r\nbeen questioned for sixty-five years.\r\n\r\nThe practice of making such appointments, whether in a vacation or\r\nduring the session of Congress, has been constantly followed during\r\nevery Administration from the earliest period of the Government, and its\r\nperfect lawfulness has never to my knowledge been questioned or denied.\r\nWithout going back further than the year 1829, and without taking into\r\nthe calculation any but the chief officers of the several Departments,\r\nit will be found that provisional appointments to fill vacancies were\r\nmade to the number of 179 from the commencement of General Jackson's\r\nAdministration to the close of General Pierce's. This number would\r\nprobably be greatly increased if all the cases which occurred in the\r\nsubordinate offices and bureaus were added to the count. Some of them\r\nwere made while the Senate was in session; some which were made in\r\nvacation were continued in force long after the Senate assembled.\r\nSometimes the temporary officer was the commissioned head of another\r\nDepartment, sometimes a subordinate in the same Department. Sometimes\r\nthe affairs of the Navy Department have been directed _ad interim_ by a\r\ncommodore and those of the War Department by a general. In most, if not\r\nall, of the cases which occurred previous to 1852 it is believed that\r\nthe compensation provided by law for the officer regularly commissioned\r\nwas paid to the person who discharged the duties _ad interim_. To give\r\nthe Senate a more detailed and satisfactory view of the subject, I send\r\nthe accompanying tabular statement, certified by the Secretary of State,\r\nin which the instances are all set forth in which provisional as well as\r\npermanent appointments were made to the highest executive offices from\r\n1829 nearly to the present time, with their respective dates.\r\n\r\nIt must be allowed that these precedents, so numerous and so long\r\ncontinued, are entitled to great respect, since we can scarcely suppose\r\nthat the wise and eminent men by whom they were made could have been\r\nmistaken on a point which was brought to their attention so often. Still\r\nless can it be supposed that any of them willfully violated the law or\r\nthe Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe lawfulness of the practice rests upon the exigencies of the public\r\nservice, which require that the movements of the Government shall not be\r\narrested by an accidental vacancy in one of the Departments; upon an act\r\nof Congress expressly and plainly giving and regulating the power, and\r\nupon long and uninterrupted usage of the Executive, which has never been\r\nchallenged as illegal by Congress.\r\n\r\nThis answers the inquiry of the Senate so far as it is necessary to show\r\n\"how and by whom the duties of said office are now discharged.\" Nor is\r\nit necessary to explain further than I have done \"how, when, and by what\r\nauthority\" the provisional appointment has been made; but the resolution\r\nmakes the additional inquiry \"_why_ the fact of said appointment has not\r\nbeen communicated to the Senate,\"\r\n\r\nI take it for granted that the Senate did not mean to call for the\r\nreasons upon which I acted in performing an Executive duty nor to demand\r\nan account of the motives which governed me in an act which the law and\r\nthe Constitution left to my own discretion. It is sufficient, therefore,\r\nfor that part of the resolution to say that a provisional or temporary\r\nappointment like that in question is not required by law to be\r\ncommunicated to the Senate, and that there is no instance on record\r\nwhere such communication ever has been made.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 22, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI herewith transmit to the House of Representatives a communication from\r\nthe Secretary of the Navy, with accompanying reports, of the persons who\r\nwere sent to the Isthmus of Chiriqui to make the examinations required\r\nby the fifth section of the act making appropriations for the naval\r\nservice, approved June 22, 1860.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 24, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolution of the Senate of the 19th instant,\r\nrequesting a copy of correspondence between the Department of State and\r\nministers of foreign powers at Washington in regard to foreign vessels\r\nin Charleston, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments by which it was accompanied.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 28, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty to submit to Congress a series of resolutions adopted\r\nby the legislature of Virginia on the 19th instant, having in view a\r\npeaceful settlement of the exciting questions which now threaten the\r\nUnion. They were delivered to me on Thursday, the 24th instant, by\r\nex-President Tyler, who has left his dignified and honored retirement in\r\nthe hope that he may render service to his country in this its hour of\r\nperil. These resolutions, it will be perceived, extend an invitation\r\n\"to all such States, whether slaveholding or nonslaveholding, as are\r\nwilling to unite with Virginia in an earnest effort to adjust the\r\npresent unhappy controversies in the spirit in which the Constitution\r\nwas originally formed, and consistently with its principles, so as to\r\nafford to the people of the slaveholding States adequate guaranties\r\nfor the securities of their rights, to appoint commissioners to meet,\r\non the 4th day of February next, in the city of Washington, similar\r\ncommissioners appointed by Virginia, to consider and, if practicable,\r\nagree upon some suitable adjustment.\"\r\n\r\nI confess I hail this movement on the part of Virginia with great\r\nsatisfaction. From the past history of this ancient and renowned\r\nCommonwealth we have the fullest assurance that what she has undertaken\r\nshe will accomplish if it can be done by able, enlightened, and\r\npersevering efforts. It is highly gratifying to know that other\r\npatriotic States have appointed and are appointing commissioners to meet\r\nthose of Virginia in council. When assembled, they will constitute a\r\nbody entitled in an eminent degree to the confidence of the country.\r\n\r\nThe general assembly of Virginia have also resolved--\r\n\r\n  That ex-President John Tyler is hereby appointed, by the concurrent\r\n  vote of each branch of the general assembly, a commissioner to the\r\n  President of the United States, and Judge John Robertson is hereby\r\n  appointed, by a like vote, a commissioner to the State of South\r\n  Carolina and the other States that have seceded or shall secede, with\r\n  instructions respectfully to request the President of the United States\r\n  and the authorities of such States to agree to abstain, pending the\r\n  proceedings contemplated by the action of this general assembly, from\r\n  any and all acts calculated to produce a collision of arms between the\r\n  States and the Government of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever strong may be my desire to enter into such an agreement, I am\r\nconvinced that I do not possess the power. Congress, and Congress alone,\r\nunder the war-making power, can exercise the discretion of agreeing to\r\nabstain \"from any and all acts calculated to produce a collision of\r\narms\" between this and any other government. It would therefore be a\r\nusurpation for the Executive to attempt to restrain their hands by an\r\nagreement in regard to matters over which he has no constitutional\r\ncontrol. If he were thus to act, they might pass laws which he should be\r\nbound to obey, though in conflict with his agreement.\r\n\r\nUnder existing circumstances, my present actual power is confined within\r\nnarrow limits. It is my duty at all times to defend and protect the\r\npublic property within the seceding States so far as this may be\r\npracticable, and especially to employ all constitutional means to\r\nprotect the property of the United States and to preserve the public\r\npeace at this the seat of the Federal Government. If the seceding States\r\nabstain \"from any and all acts calculated to produce a collision of\r\narms,\" then the danger so much to be deprecated will no longer exist.\r\nDefense, and not aggression, has been the policy of the Administration\r\nfrom the beginning.\r\n\r\nBut whilst I can enter into no engagement such as that proposed, I\r\ncordially commend to Congress, with much confidence that it will meet\r\ntheir approbation, to abstain from passing any law calculated to produce\r\na collision of arms pending the proceedings contemplated by the action\r\nof the general assembly of Virginia. I am one of those who will never\r\ndespair of the Republic. I yet cherish the belief that the American\r\npeople will perpetuate the Union of the States on some terms just and\r\nhonorable for all sections of the country. I trust that the mediation of\r\nVirginia may be the destined means, under Providence, of accomplishing\r\nthis inestimable benefit. Glorious as are the memories of her past\r\nhistory, such an achievement, both in relation to her own fame and the\r\nwelfare of the whole country, would surpass them all.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _January 30, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI have received the resolution of the Senate of the 24th instant,\r\nrequesting the return to that body of the convention between the United\r\nStates and the Republic of Venezuela on the subject of the Aves Island.\r\nThat instrument is consequently herewith returned. It was approved by\r\nthe Senate on the 24th June last with the following amendment:\r\n\r\nArticle III: Strike out this article, in the following words:\r\n\r\n  In consideration of the above agreement and indemnification, the\r\n  Government of the United States and the individuals in whose behalf they\r\n  have been made agree to desist from all further reclamation respecting\r\n  the island of Aves, abandoning to the Republic of Venezuela whatever\r\n  rights might pertain to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amendment does not seem necessary to secure any right either of the\r\nUnited States or of any American citizen claiming under them. Neither\r\nthe Government nor the citizens in whose behalf the convention has been\r\nconcluded have any further claims upon the island of Aves. Nor is it\r\nknown or believed that there are any claims against the Government of\r\nVenezuela having any connection with that island other than those\r\nprovided for in this convention. I therefore recommend the\r\nreconsideration of the subject.\r\n\r\nNo steps have yet been taken toward making known to the Venezuelan\r\nGovernment the conditional approval of the convention by the Senate.\r\nThis might have been necessary if the instrument had stipulated for a\r\nratification in the usual form and it had been ratified accordingly.\r\nInasmuch, however, as the convention contains no such stipulation, and\r\nas some of the installments had been paid according to its terms, it has\r\nbeen deemed preferable to suspend further proceedings in regard to it,\r\nespecially as it was not deemed improbable that the Senate might request\r\nit to be returned. This anticipation has been realized.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 5, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI have received from the governor of Kentucky certain resolutions\r\nadopted by the general assembly of that Commonwealth, containing an\r\napplication to Congress for the call of a convention for proposing\r\namendments to the Constitution of the United States, with a request that\r\nI should immediately place the same before that body. It affords me\r\ngreat satisfaction to perform this duty, and I feel quite confident that\r\nCongress will bestow upon these resolutions the careful consideration to\r\nwhich they are eminently entitled on account of the distinguished and\r\npatriotic source from which they proceed, as well as the great\r\nimportance of the subject which they involve.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 8, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nI deemed it a duty to transmit to Congress with my message of the 8th of\r\nJanuary the correspondence which occurred in December last between the\r\n\"commissioners\" of South Carolina and myself.\r\n\r\nSince that period, on the 14th of January, Colonel Isaac W. Hayne, the\r\nattorney-general of South Carolina, called and informed me that he was\r\nthe bearer of a letter from Governor Pickens to myself which he would\r\ndeliver the next day. He was, however, induced by the interposition of\r\nHon. Jefferson Davis and nine other Senators from the seceded and\r\nseceding States not to deliver it on the day appointed, nor was it\r\ncommunicated to me until the 31st of January, with his letter of that\r\ndate. Their letter to him urging this delay bears date January 15, and\r\nwas the commencement of a correspondence, the whole of which in my\r\npossession I now submit to Congress. A reference to each letter of the\r\nseries in proper order accompanies this message.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _February 12, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI herewith submit to the Senate, for their advice, the proceedings and\r\naward of the commissioners under the convention between the United\r\nStates of America and the Republic of Paraguay, proclaimed by the\r\nPresident on the 12th of March, 1860. It is decided by the award of\r\nthese commissioners that \"the United States and Paraguay Navigation\r\nCompany have not proved or established any right to damages upon their\r\nsaid claim against the Government of the Republic of Paraguay, and that\r\nupon the proofs aforesaid the said Government is not responsible to the\r\nsaid company in any damages or pecuniary compensation whatever in all\r\nthe premises.\"\r\n\r\nThe question arises, Had the commissioners authority under the\r\nconvention to make such an award, or were they not confined to the\r\nassessment of damages which the company had sustained from the\r\nGovernment of Paraguay?\r\n\r\nOur relations with that Republic had for years been of a most\r\nunsatisfactory character. They had been investigated by the preceding\r\nand by the present Administration. The latter came to the conclusion\r\nthat both the interest and honor of the country required that our rights\r\nagainst that Government for their attack on the _Water Witch_ and for\r\nthe injuries they had inflicted on this company should, if necessary, be\r\nenforced. Accordingly, the President in his annual message of December,\r\n1857, called the attention of Congress to the subject in the following\r\nlanguage:\r\n\r\nA demand for these purposes will be made in a firm but conciliatory\r\nspirit. This will the more probably be granted if the Executive shall\r\nhave authority to use other means in the event of a refusal. This is\r\naccordingly recommended.\r\n\r\nAfter due deliberation, Congress, on the 2d of June, 1858, authorized\r\nthe President \"to adopt such measures and use such force as in his\r\njudgment may be necessary and advisable\" in the premises. A commissioner\r\nwas accordingly appointed and a force fitted out and dispatched to\r\nParaguay for the purpose, if necessary, of enforcing atonement for these\r\nwrongs.\r\n\r\nThe expedition appeared in the waters of the La Plata and our\r\ncommissioner succeeded in concluding a treaty and convention embracing\r\nboth branches of our demand. The convention of indemnity was signed on\r\nthe 4th of February, 1859. The preamble of this convention refers to the\r\ninterruption for a time of the good understanding and harmony between\r\nthe two nations which has rendered that distant armament necessary.\r\nBy the first article the Government of Paraguay \"binds itself for the\r\nresponsibility in favor of the United States and Paraguay Navigation\r\nCompany which may result from the decree of commissioners\" to be\r\nappointed in the manner provided by article 2. This was in accordance\r\nwith the instructions to our commissioner, who was told that an\r\nindispensable preliminary to the negotiation would, \"of course, be an\r\nacknowledgment on the part of the Paraguayan Government of its liability\r\nto the company.\" The first paragraph of this second article clearly\r\nspecifies the object of the convention. This was not to ascertain\r\nwhether the claim was just, to enforce which we had sent a fleet to\r\nParaguay, but to constitute a commission to \"determine,\" not the\r\nexistence, but \"the amount, of said reclamations.\" The final paragraph\r\nprovides that \"the two commissioners named in the said manner shall meet\r\nin the city of Washington to investigate, adjust, and _determine the\r\namount_ of the claims of the above-mentioned company upon sufficient\r\nproofs of the charges and defenses of the contending parties.\" By the\r\nfifth article the Government of Paraguay \"binds itself to pay to the\r\nGovernment of the United States of America, in the city of Assumption,\r\nParaguay, thirty days after presentation to the Government of the\r\nRepublic, the draft which that of the United States of America shall\r\nissue for the amount for which the two commissioners concurring, or\r\nby the umpire, shall declare it responsible to the said company.\"\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of May 16, 1860, employs the same language that\r\nis used in the convention, \"to investigate, adjust, and determine the\r\namount\" of the claims against Paraguay. Congress, not doubting that an\r\naward would be made in favor of the company for some certain amount\r\nof damages, in the sixth section of the act referred to provides that\r\nthe money paid out of the Treasury for the expenses of the commission\r\n\"shall be retained by the United States out of the money\" (not any\r\nmoney) \"that may, pursuant to the terms of said convention, be received\r\nfrom Paraguay.\"\r\n\r\nAfter all this had been done, after we had fitted out a warlike\r\nexpedition in part to obtain satisfaction for this very claim, after\r\nthese solemn acts had been performed by the two Republics, the\r\ncommissioners have felt themselves competent to decide that they could\r\ngo behind the action of the legislative and executive branches of this\r\nGovernment and determine that there was no justice in the original\r\nclaim. A commissioner of Paraguay might have been a proper person to\r\nact merely in assessing the amount of damages when an arbiter had been\r\nprovided to decide between him and the commissioner on the part of the\r\nUnited States, but to have authorized him to decide upon the original\r\njustice of the claim against his own Government would have been a\r\nnovelty. The American commissioner is as pure and honest a man as\r\nI have ever known, but I think he took a wrong view of his powers\r\nunder the convention.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the liability of Paraguay having been established by\r\nthe highest political acts of the United States and that Republic in\r\ntheir sovereign capacity, the commissioners, who would seem to have\r\nmisapprehended their powers, have investigated and undertaken to decide\r\nwhether the Government of the United States was right or wrong in\r\nthe authority which they gave to make war if necessary to secure the\r\nindemnity. Governments may be, and doubtless often have been, wrong\r\nin going to war to enforce claims; but after this has been done, and\r\nthe inquiry which led to the reclamations has been acknowledged by the\r\nGovernment that inflicted it, it does not appear to me to be competent\r\nfor commissioners authorized to ascertain the indemnity for the injury\r\nto go behind their authority and decide upon the original merits of the\r\nclaim for which the war was made. If a commissioner were appointed under\r\na convention to ascertain the damage sustained by an American citizen in\r\nconsequence of the capture of a vessel admitted by the foreign\r\ngovernment to be illegal, and he should go behind the convention and\r\ndecide that the original capture was a lawful prize, it would certainly\r\nbe regarded as an extraordinary assumption of authority.\r\n\r\nThe present appears to me to be a case of this character, and for these\r\nreasons I have deemed it advisable to submit the whole subject for the\r\nconsideration of the Senate.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 21, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nThe treaty concluded between Great Britain and the United States on\r\nthe 15th of June, 1846, provided in its first article that the line of\r\nboundary between the territories of Her Britannic Majesty and those of\r\nthe United States from the point on the forty-ninth parallel of north\r\nlatitude up to which it had already been ascertained should be continued\r\nwestward along the said parallel \"to the middle of the channel which\r\nseparates the continent from Vancouvers Island, and thence southerly\r\nthrough the middle of said channel and of Fucas Straits to the Pacific\r\nOcean.\" When the commissioners appointed by the two Governments to\r\nmark the boundary line came to that point of it which is required to\r\nrun southerly through the channel which divides the continent from\r\nVancouvers Island, they differed entirely in their opinions, not only\r\nconcerning the true point of deflection from the forty-ninth parallel,\r\nbut also as to the channel intended to be designated in the treaty.\r\nAfter a long-continued and very able discussion of the subject, which\r\nproduced no result, they reported their disagreement to their respective\r\nGovernments. Since that time the two Governments, through their\r\nministers here and at London, have had a voluminous correspondence\r\non the point in controversy, each sustaining the view of its own\r\ncommissioner and neither yielding in any degree to the claims of the\r\nother. In the meantime the unsettled condition of this affair has\r\nproduced some serious local disturbances, and on one occasion at least\r\nhas threatened to destroy the harmonious relations existing between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States. The island of San Juan will fall\r\nto the United States if our construction of the treaty be right, while\r\nif the British interpretation be adopted it will be on their side of\r\nthe line. That island is an important possession to this country, and\r\nvaluable for agricultural as well as military purposes. I am convinced\r\nthat it is ours by the treaty fairly and impartially construed. But\r\nargument has been exhausted on both sides without increasing the\r\nprobability of final adjustment. On the contrary, each party seems now\r\nto be more convinced than at first of the justice of its own demands.\r\nThere is but one mode left of settling the dispute, and that is by\r\nsubmitting it to the arbitration of some friendly and impartial power.\r\nUnless this be done, the two countries are exposed to the constant\r\ndanger of a collision which may end in war.\r\n\r\nIt is under these circumstances that the British Government, through its\r\nminister here, has proposed the reference of the matter in controversy\r\nto the King of Sweden and Norway, the King of the Netherlands, or to the\r\nRepublic of the Swiss Confederation. Before accepting this proposition\r\nI have thought it right to take the advice of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe precise questions which I submit are these: Will the Senate approve\r\na treaty referring to either of the sovereign powers above named the\r\ndispute now existing between the Governments of the United States and\r\nGreat Britain concerning the boundary line between Vancouvers Island and\r\nthe American continent? In case the referee shall find himself unable to\r\ndecide where the line is by the description of it in the treaty of 15th\r\nJune, 1846, shall he be authorized to establish a line according to the\r\ntreaty as nearly as possible? Which of the three powers named by Great\r\nBritain as an arbiter shall be chosen by the United States?\r\n\r\nAll important papers bearing on the questions are herewith communicated\r\nin the originals. Their return to the Department of State is requested\r\nwhen the Senate shall have disposed of the subject.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the resolutions of the Senate of the 17th and 18th\r\nFebruary, 1858, requesting information upon the subject of the Aves\r\nIsland, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments which accompanied it.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1861_.\r\n\r\nHon. JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,\r\n\r\n_President of the Senate_.\r\n\r\nSIR: Herewith I inclose, for constitutional action of the Senate thereon\r\nshould it approve the same, supplemental articles of agreement made and\r\nconcluded with the authorities of the Delaware Indians on the 21st July\r\nlast, with a view to the abrogation of the sixth article of the treaty\r\nof May 30, 1860.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 23, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to a resolution of the House of Representatives adopted on the\r\n11th instant, respecting the seizure of the mint at New Orleans, with\r\na large amount of money therein, by the authorities of the State of\r\nLouisiana, the refusal of the branch mint to pay drafts of the United\r\nStates, etc., I have to state that all the information within my\r\npossession or power on these subjects was communicated to the House by\r\nthe Secretary of the Treasury on the 21st instant, and was prepared\r\nunder the resolution above referred to and a resolution of the same\r\ndate addressed to himself.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _February 26, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to the resolution of the Senate of the 25th instant,\r\nrequesting information relative to the extradition of one Anderson, a\r\nman of color, charged with the commission of murder in the State of\r\nMissouri, I transmit a report from the Secretary of State and the\r\ndocuments by which it was accompanied. The dispatch of Mr. Dallas being\r\nin the original, its return to the Department of State is requested.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 1, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIn answer to their resolution of the 11th instant [ultimo], \"that the\r\nPresident of the United States furnish to the House, if not incompatible\r\nwith the public service, the reasons that have induced him to assemble\r\nso large a number of troops in this city, and why they are kept here;\r\nand whether he has any information of a conspiracy upon the part of any\r\nportion of the citizens of this country to seize upon the capital and\r\nprevent the inauguration of the President elect,\" the President submits\r\nthat the number of troops assembled in this city is not large, as the\r\nresolution presupposes, its total amount being 653 men exclusive of\r\nthe marines, who are, of course, at the navy-yard as their appropriate\r\nstation. These troops were ordered here to act as a _posse comitatus_,\r\nin strict subordination to the civil authority, for the purpose of\r\npreserving peace and order in the city of Washington should this be\r\nnecessary before or at the period of the inauguration of the President\r\nelect.\r\n\r\nSince the date of the resolution Hon. Mr. Howard, from the select\r\ncommittee, has made a report to the House on this subject. It was\r\nthoroughly investigated by the committee, and although they have\r\nexpressed the opinion that the evidence before them does not prove the\r\nexistence of a secret organization here or elsewhere hostile to the\r\nGovernment that has for its object, upon its own responsibility, an\r\nattack upon the capital or any of the public property here, or an\r\ninterruption of any of the functions of the Government, yet the House\r\nlaid upon the table by a very large majority a resolution expressing the\r\nopinion \"that the regular troops now in this city ought to be forthwith\r\nremoved therefrom.\" This of itself was a sufficient reason for not\r\nwithdrawing the troops.\r\n\r\nBut what was the duty of the President at the time the troops\r\nwere ordered to this city? Ought he to have waited before this\r\nprecautionary measure was adopted until he could obtain proof that\r\na secret organization existed to seize the capital? In the language\r\nof the select committee, this was \"in a time of high excitement\r\nconsequent upon revolutionary events transpiring all around us, the very\r\nair filled with rumors and individuals indulging in the most extravagant\r\nexpressions of fears and threats.\" Under these and other circumstances,\r\nwhich I need not detail, but which appear in the testimony before the\r\nselect committee, I was convinced that I ought to act. The safety of the\r\nimmense amount of public property in this city and that of the archives\r\nof the Government, in which all the States, and especially the new\r\nStates in which the public lands are situated, have a deep interest; the\r\npeace and order of the city itself and the security of the inauguration\r\nof the President elect, were objects of such vast importance to the\r\nwhole country that I could not hesitate to adopt precautionary defensive\r\nmeasures. At the present moment, when all is quiet, it is difficult to\r\nrealize the state of alarm which prevailed when the troops were first\r\nordered to this city. This almost instantly subsided after the arrival\r\nof the first company, and a feeling of comparative peace and security\r\nhas since existed both in Washington and throughout the country. Had\r\nI refused to adopt this precautionary measure, and evil consequences,\r\nwhich many good men at the time apprehended, had followed, I should\r\nnever have forgiven myself.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON, _March 2, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI deem it proper to invite the attention of the Senate to the fact that\r\nwith this day expires the limitation of time for the exchange of the\r\nratifications of the treaty with Costa Rica of 2d July, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe minister of that Republic is disappointed in not having received\r\nthe copy intended for exchange, and the period will lapse without the\r\npossibility of carrying out the provisions of the convention in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nI submit, therefore, the expediency of the passage of a resolution\r\nauthorizing the exchange of ratifications at such time as may be\r\nconvenient, the limitations of the ninth article to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVETO MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON CITY, _January 25, 1861_.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:\r\n\r\nI return with my objections to the House, in which it originated, the\r\nbill entitled \"An act for the relief of Hockaday & Leggit,\" presented to\r\nme on the 15th instant.\r\n\r\nThis bill appropriates $59,576 \"to Hockaday & Leggit, in full payment\r\nfor damages sustained by them in reduction of pay for carrying the mails\r\non route No. 8911; and that said amount be paid to William Leggit for\r\nand on account of Hockaday & Leggit, and for their benefit.\"\r\n\r\nA bill containing the same language, with the single exception that the\r\nsum appropriated therein was $40,000 instead of $59,576, passed both\r\nHouses of Congress at their last session; but it was presented to me\r\nat so late a period of the session that I could not examine its merits\r\nbefore the time fixed for the adjournment, and it therefore, under\r\nthe Constitution, failed to become a law. The increase of the sum\r\nappropriated in the present bill over that in the bill of the last\r\nsession, being within a fraction of $20,000, has induced me to examine\r\nthe question with some attention, and I find that the bill involves an\r\nimportant principle, which if established by Congress may take large\r\nsums out of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nIt appears that on the 1st day of April, 1858, John M. Hockaday entered\r\ninto a contract with the Postmaster-General for transporting the mail\r\non route No. 8911, from St. Joseph, Mo., by Fort Kearney, Nebraska\r\nTerritory, and Fort Leavenworth, to Salt Lake City, for the sum of\r\n$190,000 per annum for a weekly service. The service was to commence on\r\nthe 1st day of May, 1858, and to terminate on the 30th November, 1860.\r\nBy this contract the Postmaster-General reserved to himself the right\r\n\"to reduce the service to semimonthly whenever the necessities of the\r\npublic and the condition of affairs in the Territory of Utah may not\r\nrequire it more frequently.\" And again:\r\n\r\n  That the Postmaster-General may discontinue or curtail the service, in\r\n  whole or in part, in order to place on the route a greater degree of\r\n  service, or whenever the public interests require such discontinuance\r\n  for any other cause, he allowing one month's extra pay on the amount of\r\n  service dispensed with.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 11th April, 1859, the Postmaster-General curtailed the service,\r\nwhich he had a clear right to do under the contract, to semimonthly,\r\nwith an annual deduction of $65,000, leaving the compensation $125,000\r\nfor twenty-four trips per year instead of $190,000 for fifty-two trips.\r\nThis curtailment was not to take effect till the 1st of July, 1859.\r\n\r\nAt the time the contract was made it was expected that the army in\r\nUtah might be engaged in active operations, and hence the necessity of\r\nfrequent communications between the War Department and that Territory.\r\nThe reservation of the power to curtail the service to semimonthly trips\r\nitself proves that the parties had in view the contingency of such\r\ncurtailment \"whenever the necessities of the public and the condition of\r\naffairs in the Territory of Utah may not require it more frequently.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the Postmaster-General ordered this curtailment he had an\r\ninterview with the Secretary of War upon the subject, in the course of\r\nwhich the Secretary agreed that a weekly mail to St. Joseph and Salt\r\nLake City was no longer needed for the purposes of the Government--this,\r\nevidently, because the trouble in Utah had ended.\r\n\r\nMr. Hockaday faithfully complied with his contract, and the full\r\ncompensation was paid, at the rate of $190,000 per annum, up to the\r\n1st July, 1859, and \"one month's extra pay on the amount of service\r\ndispensed with,\" according to the contract.\r\n\r\nPrevious to that date, as has been already stated, on the 14th of\r\nApril, 1859, the Postmaster-General curtailed the service to twice per\r\nmonth, and on the 11th May, 1859, Messrs. Hockaday & Co. assigned the\r\ncontract to Jones, Russell & Co. for a bonus of $50,000. Their property\r\nconnected with the route was to be appraised, which was effected, and\r\nthey received on this account about $94,000, making the whole amount\r\nabout $144,000.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the contractors have sustained considerable loss\r\nin the whole transaction. The amount I shall not pretend to decide,\r\nwhether $40,000 or $59,576, or any other sum.\r\n\r\nIt will be for Congress to consider whether the precedent established\r\nby this bill will not in effect annul all restrictions contained in the\r\nmail contracts enabling the Postmaster-General to reduce or curtail the\r\npostal service according to the public exigencies as they may arise.\r\nI have no other solicitude upon the subject. I am informed that there\r\nare many cases in the Post-Office Department depending upon the same\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nA PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas objects of interest to the United Slates require that the Senate\r\nshould be convened at 12 o'clock on the 4th of March next to receive and\r\nact upon such communications as may be made to it on the part of the\r\nExecutive:\r\n\r\nNow, therefore, I, James Buchanan, President of the United States, have\r\nconsidered it to be my duty to issue this my proclamation, declaring\r\nthat an extraordinary occasion requires the Senate of the United States\r\nto convene for the transaction of business at the Capitol, in the city\r\nof Washington, on the 4th day of March next, at 12 o'clock at noon on\r\nthat day, of which all who shall at that time be entitled to act as\r\nmembers of that body are hereby required to take notice.\r\n\r\n[SEAL.]\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and the seal of the United States, at Washington,\r\nthe 11th day of February, A.D. 1861, and of the Independence of the\r\nUnited States the eighty-fifth.\r\n\r\nJAMES BUCHANAN.\r\n\r\nBy the President:\r\n  J.S.
