It is not so\r\nmuch a history of events as a reading of them in the light of a particular\r\npolitical philosophy. In the strict sense a history of Liberalism should\r\ncover much more than politics. The same habit of mind is to be discovered\r\neverywhere else in the history of thought, most conspicuously in religious\r\nhistory, but not less certainly in the history of science and of art. The\r\ngeneral victory in these innumerable conflicts of opinion has been to\r\nLiberalism, and the movement of the race, during the period with which the\r\nwriter is concerned, is precisely measured by the degree in which the\r\nLiberal spirit has succeeded in modifying the establishments of the\r\npreceding age. The object of this book is to investigate the course of that\r\nprocess of modification in politics.\r\n\r\nBy Liberalism I mean, not a policy, but a habit of mind. It is the\r\ndisposition of the man who looks upon each of his fellows as of equal worth\r\nwith himself. He does not assume that all men and women are of equal\r\ncapacity, or equally entitled to offices and privileges. But he is always\r\ninclined to leave and to give them equal opportunity with himself for\r\nself-expression and for self-development. He assumes, as the basis of his\r\nactivity, that he has no right to interfere with any other person's\r\nattempts {8} to employ his natural powers in what he conceives to be the\r\nbest way. He is unwilling to impose his judgment upon that of others, or to\r\nforce them to live their lives according to his ideas rather than their\r\nown. They are never to be used by him for his own ends, but for theirs.\r\nEach is to be left to himself, to work out his own salvation. The Liberal\r\nhabit of mind has its positive as well as its negative side. Just as it\r\nleads its possessor to refrain from interfering with the development of\r\nothers, so it leads him to take active steps to remove the artificial\r\nbarriers which impede that development. Natural obstacles will remain,\r\nthough even these may be diminished. But the artificial conditions, which\r\nprevent or hinder growth, are perpetually obnoxious to the Liberal. Upon\r\nclass distinctions in society, privileges of sex, rank, wealth, and creed,\r\nhe wages unceasing war. They are, in his eye, weights and impediments. To\r\none of two individuals, not distinguishable in natural capacity, they give\r\nan advantage which is denied to the other. It is the object of the Liberal,\r\nnot to deprive any individual of such opportunities as are required for the\r\nexercise of his natural powers, but to prevent the excessive appropriation\r\nof such opportunities by members of the privileged class. The differences\r\nbetween the practical aims and methods of Liberals at different times are\r\nvery wide. But the mental habit has always been the same. \"The passion for\r\nimproving mankind, in its ultimate object, does not vary. But the immediate\r\nobject of reformers and the forms of persuasion by which they seek to\r\nadvance them, vary much in different generations. To a hasty observer they\r\nmight even seem contradictory, and to justify the notion that nothing\r\nbetter than a desire for change, selfish or perverse, is at the bottom of\r\nall reforming movements. Only those who will think a little longer about it\r\ncan discern the same old cause of social good against class interests, for\r\nwhich, under altered names, Liberals are fighting now as they were fifty\r\nyears ago.\"[1] The constitutional Liberalism of Fox, the economical\r\nLiberalism of Cobden, and the new collectivist Liberalism of Mr. Lloyd {9}\r\nGeorge exhibit great differences in comparison. But the three men are alike\r\nin their desire to set free the individual from existing social bonds, and\r\nto procure him liberty of growth.\r\n\r\nThe justification for this individual freedom is not that the man is left\r\nto his own selfish motives, to develop himself for his own advantage. It is\r\nthat it is only in this way that he can realize that his own best advantage\r\nis only secured by consulting that of his fellows. \"The foundation of\r\nliberty is the idea of growth ... it is of course possible to reduce a man\r\nto order and prevent him from being a nuisance to his neighbours by\r\narbitrary control and harsh punishment.... It is also possible, though it\r\ntakes a much higher skill, to teach the same man to discipline himself, and\r\nthis is to foster the development of will, of personality, of self-control,\r\nor whatever we please to call that central harmonizing power which makes us\r\ncapable of directing our own lives. Liberalism is the belief that society\r\ncan safely be founded on this self-directing power of personality.\"[2] This\r\nLiberalism has nothing to do with anarchy. Coercion may be consistently\r\napplied wherever individual liberty is employed for the public injury, and\r\nthe imprisonment of burglars and the regulation of factories by law are\r\nonly two aspects of the same thing. But Liberalism restricts freedom only\r\nto extend freedom. Where the individual uses his own liberty to restrict\r\nthat of others he may be coerced. But in spite of the modifications to\r\nwhich all such political principles must be subject, the general rule holds\r\ngood. The ideal Liberal State is that in which every individual is equally\r\nfree to work out his own life.\r\n\r\nThe practical difficulty of working out the relations between the\r\nindividual and the society in which he is placed is of course very great,\r\nand it will probably always be impossible to maintain a perfect\r\nequilibrium. No doubt we shall always suffer from one or other of the two\r\nunsatisfying conditions--the sacrifice of the individual to what the\r\nmajority thinks to be the right of the whole society, and the sacrifice of\r\nthe {10} society to the undue emancipation of the individual. But the\r\nnecessary imperfection of the result is no argument against this or any\r\nother political system of thought. Politics are no more than a means of\r\ngetting things done, and when we have found a society of perfect human\r\nbeings, we can fairly complain that their affairs are not perfectly\r\nmanaged. So far as he can, the Liberal aims at securing this balance of\r\nsocial and individual good, remembering that the good of society can only\r\nbe measured by the good of all its members, and not by the good only of\r\nsome dominant rank, creed, or class. \"Rights are relative to the well-being\r\nof society, but the converse proposition is equally true, that the\r\nwell-being of society may be measured by the degree in which their moral\r\nrights are secured to its component members.... The moral right of an\r\nindividual is simply a condition of the full development of his personality\r\nas a moral being. Equally, the moral right of any community is the\r\ncondition of the maintenance of its common life, and since that society is\r\nbest, happiest, and most progressive which enables its members to make the\r\nutmost of themselves, there is no necessary conflict between them. The\r\nmaintenance of rights is the condition of human progress.... To reconcile\r\nthe rule of right with the principle of the public welfare is the supreme\r\nend of social theory.\"[3]\r\n\r\nIn practical politics the work of modern Liberalism has been to alter the\r\nconditions of society so that this freedom of growth may be secured for\r\neach member of it. The old conception of society was a conception of\r\nclasses. Human beings were graded and standardized. Certain privileges were\r\nreserved for certain groups. Society looked, for its estimate of a man, not\r\nto his natural powers, not to what he might make of himself, but to his\r\nbrand or mark. If within a certain degree, he had a free choice of his mode\r\nof life; if without it, he found his condition prescribed, sometimes so\r\nrigorously that he could hardly ever improve it. Liberalism has endeavoured\r\nto go deeper into the man, to get beneath the outward complexion, {11} to\r\nfind out his intrinsic worth, and to give him that place in the social\r\nestimate which his natural powers deserve. Arbitrary distinctions are\r\nabhorrent to it. It is incapable of thinking in terms of class. Every class\r\nis, in its eyes, only an aggregate of individuals, and to exalt one class\r\nabove another is to appreciate some individuals at the expense of others,\r\nto place marks of comparative social worth upon the members of different\r\ngroups which do not correspond to the relative values of their natural\r\nqualities. Against a privileged race, rank, creed, or sex Liberalism must\r\nfight continually. By the artificial elevation of one above another, it is\r\nmade to count for more in society, its members are aggrandized and those of\r\nits rivals are depreciated; and while the first are encouraged to abuse,\r\nthe second are hampered and fettered in their growth. The Liberal asserts\r\nthat no man, because he happens to be of a particular sect, or to be born\r\nof a particular family, or to possess a particular form of property, or to\r\nhold particular opinions, shall be invested by Society with privileges\r\nwhich give him an advantage in social intercourse over his fellows. He does\r\nnot assert that all human beings are equal in capacity, but he demands that\r\ntheir natural inequalities shall not be aggravated by artificial\r\nconditions. For what he is worth, each shall be free to realize his highest\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nThe Liberal conception of equality as between individuals is extended to\r\nthe case of Churches, of nations, and of sexes. These classes are indeed\r\nnot regarded by the Liberal as classes, but simply as associations, for\r\nlimited purposes, of individuals, who are, in all essential respects,\r\nseparate and distinct. To confer a privilege upon one Church or nation or\r\nsex is simply to confer a privilege upon the individuals who compose it,\r\nand whether the privilege is the monopoly of political power or the sole\r\nright to take part in a public ceremony, it does in greater or less degree\r\naffect the relative social values of the members of the two groups, and\r\nplaces the members of the inferior at the disposition of those of the\r\nsuperior. To give the Established Church the sole right to take part in the\r\ncoronation of the King is a violation {12} of Liberal principle of the same\r\nkind, though not of the same degree, as to exclude Dissenters or Catholics\r\nfrom Parliament, and if men were content to exclude women only from the\r\nlegal profession, they would be arrogating to themselves a superior value\r\nno less clearly than when they refuse to them the right to control their\r\nown government.\r\n\r\nThe same general habit of mind is applied to foreign policy. The\r\nacknowledgment of the equal worth of individuals within the nation becomes\r\nthe acknowledgment of the equal worth of nations among themselves.\r\n\"Nationalism has stood for liberty, not only in the sense that it has\r\nresisted tyrannous encroachment, but also in the sense that it has\r\nmaintained the right of a community to work out its own salvation in its\r\nown way. A nation has an individuality, and the doctrine that individuality\r\nis an element in well-being is rightly applied to it. The world advances by\r\nthe free, vigorous growth of divergent types, and is stunted when all the\r\nfresh bursting shoots are planed off close to the heavy, solid stem.\"[4]\r\nThe interference of one with another, attempts to prescribe the limits or\r\nthe cause of development, are as obnoxious in international as in\r\nintra-national relations. It was in fact in connection with this idea of\r\nnationality that the words \"Liberal\" and \"Liberalism\" came into use. The\r\nfirst English Liberals were those statesmen who followed Canning in his\r\nchampionship of Greece and the South American Republics, and some of them\r\nwere very far from being Liberals within the borders of their own State.[5]\r\n\r\nThis extension of Liberalism from individuals to nations is easy as a\r\nmental process, but very far from easy as a matter of practical politics.\r\nNationality is not difficult to define in general terms. It is sometimes\r\ninfinitely difficult to decide in a particular case whether the general\r\ndefinition applies. John Stuart Mill has perhaps given as much precision to\r\nthe Liberal conception of nationality as it can bear. \"A portion of mankind\r\nmay be said {13} to constitute a nation if they are united among themselves\r\nby common sympathies which do not exist between them and others. This\r\nfeeling of nationality may have been generated by various causes. Sometimes\r\nit is the effect of identity of race and descent. Community of language and\r\ncommunity of religion greatly contribute to it. Geographical limits are one\r\nof the causes. But the strongest of all is identity of political\r\nantecedents, the possession of a national history and consequent community\r\nof recollections, collective pride and humiliation, pleasure and regret,\r\nconnected with the same incidents in the past.\"[6] Nationality is not a\r\nthing of sharp outline, any more than any other political conception, and\r\ncommunity of interest, the management of common concerns over a long period\r\nof time, has triumphed over differences so potent as those of race and\r\ncreed. Such has been the fortune of Switzerland, of Canada, and of white\r\nSouth Africa, and it is the hope of Liberalism that such will also be the\r\nfortune of Ireland. Without attempting to draw hard lines between\r\ncommunities, the Liberal sees in them distinctions of worth and capacity\r\nsuch as he sees in individuals, and he would give the same freedom of\r\nself-development to a nation as to a human being.\r\n\r\nThe idea that nations are to be bound by moral rules as much as individuals\r\nis only another application of the general rule that one man is to be\r\ntreated as equally entitled with every other to the development of his own\r\nfaculties. The same rule is extended to nations as to single persons. No\r\none people has the right to interfere with the free development of another,\r\nuntil it is clearly and unmistakably proved that that free development will\r\nbe generally injurious. Once this principle is accepted, it becomes\r\nimpossible, as in the case of single persons, for one nation to decline to\r\nrecognize moral rules in its dealings with others. Morality is nothing but\r\nthe subjection of individual wills to the common will, as expressed in\r\ndefined rules. Immorality is only the arrogance of the individual will,\r\nrefusing to submit itself to general rules, while it endeavours to enforce\r\ngeneral rules upon {14} others. The Liberal State is that which recognizes\r\nthe universal application of its own principles of conduct, declines to\r\nthrust its own ideas upon unwilling associates, and works in harmony with\r\nother races instead of in opposition to them.\r\n\r\nIt is not suggested here that it is any part of the Liberal doctrine to\r\nseek peace at any price, or to turn the other cheek to the smiter. A vital\r\ncondition of the existence of morality is that moral persons shall be ready\r\nat all times to defend it. To suffer wanton aggression is as fatal to a\r\nnation as to an individual. It is a mere encouragement to the general\r\ninfringement of rights which means the dissolution of international\r\nmorality. Liberal patriotism exists, though it is of a different kind from\r\nthat patriotism which is so conspicuous a feature of our modern\r\nImperialism. Imperialist patriotism is often a vulgar assertion of selfish\r\npower. Liberal patriotism is a means of diminishing national selfishness.\r\nJust as the Liberal believes that the best life within the nation is\r\nproduced by the growth of free individuality, so he believes that the best\r\nlife in the race at large is produced by the growth of free nationality.\r\n\"If there is one condition precedent to effective internationalism or to\r\nthe establishment of any reliable relations between States, it is the\r\nexistence of strong, secure, well-developed, and responsible nations.\r\nInternationalism can never be subserved by the suppression or forcible\r\nabsorption of nations; for these practices react disastrously upon the\r\nsprings of internationalism, on the one hand setting nations on their armed\r\ndefence and stifling the amicable approaches between them, on the other\r\ndebilitating the larger nations through excessive corpulence and\r\nindigestion. The hope of a coming internationalism enjoins above all else\r\nthe maintenance and natural growth of independent nationalities, for\r\nwithout such there could be no gradual evolution of internationalism, but\r\nonly a series of unsuccessful attempts at a chaotic and unstable\r\ncosmopolitanism. As individualism is essential to any sane form of national\r\nsocialism, so nationalism is essential to internationalism.\"[7]\r\n\r\n{15}\r\n\r\nBy far the most difficult of all the tasks which Liberalism has to perform\r\nis in its conduct of foreign policy. Even in domestic affairs it is often\r\nnot easy to calculate the effects of particular proposals, how far they can\r\nbe pressed towards the ideal, in what temper they will be received by the\r\npeople, with what smoothness they will operate when they have been\r\nexpressed in an Act of Parliament. It is a matter of accommodating\r\nourselves to somewhat intractable material, and of managing, persuading,\r\nand guiding human beings whose motives we cannot directly control. But the\r\nfacts are at least fairly within reach. The Liberal statesman has as much\r\nopportunity as anybody can have of knowing the mental habit and disposition\r\nof those whom his legislation will affect. He is acquainted with their\r\nhistory. He is guided by previous successes or failures. In the last\r\nresort, he knows that the great bulk of the people concerned will respect\r\nthe law even if they dislike it, and will express their dissent no more\r\ndangerously than by turning him out of office. In foreign affairs his\r\ndifficulties are infinitely greater, and the consequences of failure may be\r\ndisastrous. He is dealing, not with subjects, but with independent persons,\r\nwho, except in a few points settled by agreement, observe no common law\r\nwith himself. Their objects are obscure, and may only temporarily coincide\r\nwith his own. They may have private arrangements among themselves of which\r\nhe knows little or nothing, and if they cheat him in their own interest he\r\nhas no remedy except one which is so violent as to be worse almost than any\r\ndisease. Finally, even if his knowledge of the facts were more accurate,\r\nand his confidence in his associates more complete, he would still be\r\nbaffled by the hostility to Liberal ideas which animates some, if not all,\r\nof the foreign diplomatists.\r\n\r\nThese are obstacles to direct action which it would be folly not to take\r\ninto consideration, and in the case of the present Foreign Secretary they\r\nseem to have proved insuperable. But in some directions it is obvious that\r\nthe Liberal statesman can pursue his course without fear. Where no powerful\r\nopponent or associate is concerned, he is as free as within his own\r\ncountry, and he is bound to act on purely Liberal principles. He must act\r\nalways {16} according to moral rules, even in dealing with weak peoples. He\r\nis bound to do nothing which would help to maintain a vicious system or\r\ngovernment. He is bound not to interfere in the domestic affairs of another\r\nnation, save where the fundamental liberties of his own countrymen are in\r\ndanger. It is equally his duty to refrain from arrogance towards distracted\r\nChina and towards united Germany. It is not his business to lecture the\r\nRussian Government for its vile domestic policy or the Spanish Government\r\nfor the atrocious murder of Ferrer. But it is no more his business to\r\nstrengthen these Governments, either by his alliance or otherwise, in thus\r\nacting towards their subjects. It is no doubt the duty of Liberals who are\r\nprivate persons to protest against cruelty and oppression, wherever it may\r\nbe found. Public opinion counts for something, even in a foreign country,\r\nand if we cannot prevent evil abroad, we can at least keep alive the hatred\r\nof it in our own country. The Englishman who is indifferent to the\r\nsufferings of Finland is in danger of becoming insensitive to his own. But\r\nwhatever may be the duty of private persons, official representations to a\r\nforeign State are always useless, and often exaggerate the evils to which\r\nthey refer. In the face of foreign dictation, domestic tyranny becomes a\r\npatriotic duty. Whatever a Liberal Foreign Secretary may think, he must not\r\ndictate to any established Government. But his duty on the other side is\r\nequally clear, and he must do nothing to strengthen such a Government\r\nagainst its subjects. Palmerston's expressed approval of Napoleon III's\r\n_coup d'etat_ and Sir Edward Grey's more indirect support of the present\r\nRussian tyranny are equally illiberal. If a Government which violates every\r\nLiberal principle in its domestic policy is not to be treated as an enemy,\r\nit is no more to be treated as a friend. It is entitled to the honourable\r\nobservance of all agreements for the joint management of joint concerns,\r\nand to perfect freedom in its own domestic administration. It is not\r\nentitled to anything which will enhance its power. To assist it directly or\r\nindirectly is to participate in its wrongdoing, and no Liberal can safely\r\ndo that without impairing his own character. {17}\r\n\r\nThese are elementary rules which the Liberal must observe in all cases\r\nwhere his conduct is to be determined by nothing out of his own control. In\r\nother cases he can often do very little, and is compelled to acquiesce in\r\nconduct of which he would never himself be guilty. Here it is his duty to\r\ndo as much as he can, to avoid the offensive imposition of his own ideas\r\nupon his fellows, to avoid arrangements which dispose of the fortunes of\r\nweak peoples irrespective of their wishes, to work in concert, not with one\r\nPower or group of Powers, but with all who are interested, and, in case of\r\ndifficulty, to throw his weight into the scale with those whose aims most\r\nresemble his own. Generally, it is his duty to substitute the expression of\r\nmoral rules by arbitration for the brutal assertion of national egoism in\r\nwar. But there is no general presumption against war. It is always an evil.\r\nBut it may be the least of possible evils. War for the independence of his\r\nown nation requires no justification. War for the independence of another\r\nnation or for the defence of some rule of international morality is to be\r\njudged by its expediency. \"It seems to be impossible to state the principle\r\nof non-intervention in rational and statesmanlike terms, if it is under all\r\ncircumstances, and without qualification or limit, to preclude an armed\r\nprotest against intervention by other foreign Powers. There may happen to\r\nbe good reasons why we should on a given occasion passively watch a foreign\r\nGovernment interfering by violence in the affairs of another country. Our\r\nown Government may have its hands full; or it may have no military means of\r\nintervening to good purpose; or its intervention might in the long run do\r\nmore harm than good to the object of its solicitude. But there can be no\r\ngeneral prohibitory rule. When a military despot interferes to crush the\r\nmen of another country while struggling for their national rights, no\r\nprinciple can make it wrong for a free nation to interfere by force against\r\nhim. It can only be a question of expediency and prudence.\"[8] In other\r\nwords, the importance of the moral rule involved must be weighed with the\r\nchances {18} of success, the cost of war, the waste of life and wealth, and\r\nthe sufferings of the poorer classes, which are the inevitable consequences\r\nof war. In the face of a universal enemy like Napoleon a war on behalf of\r\nSpain and Portugal was just. The Crimean War and the Boer Wars were unjust.\r\nWars on behalf of Poles or Finns against Russia or Hungarians against\r\nAustrians would have been just, but not expedient, because no maritime\r\npower could have waged them with any chance of permanent success. It is a\r\nmatter of calculation, and there are few wars, other than wars for the\r\nindependence of their own country, which Liberals would not hold to cost\r\nmore in blood and treasure than the principle for which they were\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this reasoning is entirely inconsistent with the theory\r\nof the balance of power. That theory, unhappily revived in recent years,\r\nrequires not merely the subordination of morality to expediency in\r\nparticular cases, but the complete abandonment of morality as a condition\r\nof international politics. Its essence is not international agreement and\r\nthe rule of right, but international hostility and the rule of force. It\r\nsets the States into two groups, one of which must always act against the\r\nother. England's policy is no longer decided by herself, but by herself in\r\nconsultation with allies, whose character and objects may be purely\r\nselfish. If one of her associates is guilty of immoral aggression against\r\none of the opposing group, or asserts some right which ought only to be\r\nconferred upon her by international agreement, she is dragged into a\r\nquarrel in defence of wrong against right, and not only violates moral\r\nrules in the particular case, but weakens her own ability to observe them\r\nin every other. Her honour and her interest alike are placed in the hands\r\nof others. She accepts a bill in blank, which the holder may fill in with\r\nany amount he pleases. In cases of extreme necessity this may be\r\ninevitable. When all are threatened by an enemy of the type of Napoleon,\r\nEngland cannot dissociate herself from the rest on account of their want of\r\nscruple. But as a settled and habitual policy the maintenance of the\r\nbalance of power must be abhorrent to every {19} man who is not ready to\r\nput his conscience into the keeping of others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn examination of the opposing mode of thought will make clearer the\r\nessential nature of Liberalism. This opposite may fairly be called Toryism,\r\nif that term is used, like the other, to describe a persisting habit of\r\nmind and not a policy, which varies from generation to generation.\r\nConservatism and Unionism are not satisfactory equivalents. The latter,\r\nespecially, expresses only opposition to a particular project of\r\nLiberalism, and is itself, like its object, of a temporary nature.\r\nConservatism on the other hand, though a permanent force, is not\r\nessentially opposed to Liberalism. It is indeed often allied with Toryism,\r\nand so long as Liberalism continues to do positive and reconstructive work\r\nthe strength of Toryism must generally lie in this negative and preserving\r\ninstinct. When the two opponents exchange their usual parts, the\r\nConservative mass swings over to the Liberal side. It is to Conservatism,\r\nas well as to Liberalism, that Free Trade owes its present security. In the\r\nface of active retrogression, the true Conservative, without becoming a\r\nLiberal, ranges himself with Liberals. But this sort of temporary alliance\r\nis rare. Until very recent years Liberalism has been the active and\r\nchanging force, and has accordingly always found Conservatism its enemy.\r\n\r\nA very good illustration of this working agreement between the positive\r\ndislike of individual emancipation and the negative reluctance to modify an\r\ninstitution which prevents it was furnished a short time ago by the Dean of\r\nCanterbury. The Convocation of the Diocese was considering whether the\r\nwife's pledge to obey her husband should be struck out of the marriage\r\nservice. To the Liberal, this pledge, purporting to invest the subjection\r\nof the female sex to the male with a divine sanction, is one of the most\r\nobnoxious of all the fetters upon the freedom of women. Regarding the woman\r\nas of equal worth with the man, he has no doubt that this institution must\r\nbe modified in her interest. On the occasion in question, the proposal for\r\nher {20} relief was successfully opposed by the Dean. He said that when\r\nthey were asked to say that the views of the Apostles regarding the\r\nposition of the two sexes were wrong, that was a somewhat alarming and\r\ndistressing principle to introduce into their deliberations. They were\r\nbound, not only by the ancient traditions of their Church, but by their\r\nvows, to submit their judgment absolutely to the statements of the Apostles\r\non matters of that kind.[9] This is a clear case of Conservatism defending\r\nToryism. The subjection of the wife enjoined by the marriage service dates\r\nfrom a period long preceding even that of apostolic barbarism, when women\r\nwere regarded as absolutely at the disposition of their male associates. In\r\norigin it was a crude assertion of the male ego at the expense of the\r\nfemale. The modern Church makes no such naked requisition, and defends the\r\nselfish establishment, not because it is selfish, but because it is an\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nThis is the usual method of Conservatism. The position was fixed by the\r\nremote ancestors of the present garrison, and they are content to defend it\r\neven though they would never have themselves taken it up. But pure Toryism\r\nlives to-day, and reproduces the thoughts, the arguments, and often the\r\nvery words, of the Toryism of a century ago. Opponents of Disestablishment\r\nrepeat the language of the supporters of the Test Act. Opponents of Woman\r\nSuffrage, even those who call themselves Liberals, argue as Eldon and Peel\r\nargued against Parliamentary Reform. Ulster preserves the atmosphere of the\r\nstruggle for Catholic Emancipation. Mr. Lloyd George, like Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain thirty years ago, excites the same fury as was produced by Tom\r\nPaine's _Rights of Man_. The same principles contend on different stages,\r\nand through the mouths of different actors. Though the cries of the\r\nunending warfare change, the parties are always the same. Liberty is like\r\nthe books of the Roman Sybil. As each instalment is wrested from the grasp\r\nof the monopolists, the remainder becomes at once as precious as was\r\npreviously the whole: loss of one privilege never prepares them for the\r\nsurrender of another. The admission of Dissenters {21} to public office\r\ninvolved no adoption of the general principle that all sects should be\r\ntreated equally by the State. The abandonment of rotten boroughs was no\r\nacknowledgment that every individual subject to government had the right to\r\ncontrol government. The innumerable concessions made by Toryism to Irish\r\nnationality have involved no general recognition. The old arguments have\r\nbeen shattered and dissipated in more than one contest. But when the forces\r\nof Liberalism advance against the next line of defence, the ancient\r\nretainers of monopoly are dragged from the hospitals and galvanized into\r\nnew activity, to be routed again after a struggle almost as bitter and as\r\nlong as the first. Toryism is beaten. It is never converted.\r\n\r\nThis Toryism is the habit of mind which refuses to concede to others that\r\nright of free expression which it requires for itself. It is the egoistic\r\nmind which regards all others as at its disposition. Its opinions are of\r\nsuperior worth, and others must give way. As the Liberal temper is\r\nextended, so is the Tory. The ego includes the Church, the occupation, the\r\nnation, and the sex of the individual. It thinks of human beings in\r\nclasses, as distinguished from itself. They are Dissenters, or \"people who\r\ndo not agree with my religious opinions\"; tenants, or \"people who pay money\r\nto me or my class for the privilege of working or living on our land\";\r\nforeigners, or \"people who happen to be born in countries other than my\r\nown\"; wives, widows, and spinsters, or \"persons who are, or have been, or\r\nwill be connected with my sex.\" The Tory habitually thinks of his\r\nfellow-creatures not according to their individuality, but according to\r\ntheir class, the face value which, regardless of their intrinsic worth,\r\neither entitles or disentitles them to his favour. They either belong to\r\nhis own class or they do not. The real worth of each is not the standard by\r\nwhich he forms his judgment of them. Every act and utterance, every request\r\nand protest of another person is referred to the artificial connection, or\r\ndistinction, instead of being judged for itself. The prime condition is\r\nthat the other should keep in his place. By the Liberal the other is\r\nconsidered as an isolated object, an end in {22} himself, to be treated\r\nwithout regard to any artificial association between them. The accidental\r\nis distinguished from the essential, and the creed, nationality,\r\noccupation, or sex is not allowed to interrupt the clear view of the human\r\nbeing who is enclosed in it. The Tory deals with his object as invested\r\nwith a status. The Liberal deals with the man in himself.\r\n\r\nThese different points of view determine the different attitudes of the two\r\nparties to political problems as they arise. The pure Tory is of course as\r\nrare as the pure Liberal, and neither of the two groups, which are at any\r\nparticular time described as Liberal and Tory, corresponds exactly with the\r\nhabit of mind associated with its name.[10] Self-styled Tories are\r\noccasionally strongly Liberal in particular cases. Windham, who thought\r\nthat the abolition of bull-baiting was a dangerous revolution, voted\r\nagainst the Slave Trade. Peel, the greatest man whom the old Tory party\r\never produced, was Liberal in finance, in legislation about crime and\r\nfactories, and in foreign policy. In the same way, men who are Liberal in\r\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred show {23} themselves to be Tory in the\r\nlast. Robert Lowe, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer in the great Liberal\r\nMinistry of 1868, had as fierce a contempt for the working classes as Lord\r\nSalisbury himself. The question of Woman Suffrage, appearing unexpectedly\r\non the surface of politics in 1906, has divided both parties, though in\r\ndifferent proportions. The true Liberal supports the demand for\r\nenfranchisement. The true Tory opposes it. But the agitation has discovered\r\nsome of the most bitter of sexual egoists on the Radical benches of the\r\nHouse of Commons, and champions of the individual's right to control her\r\nown government even among the Cecils.[11] The division between the members\r\nof the schools is thus not sharply defined. But the schools always exist,\r\nand it is in the perpetual conflict between them that the progress of the\r\nnation takes place.\r\n\r\nEvery political problem involves a conflict between an existing institution\r\nand the interest of individuals. The two parties thus approach it from\r\ndifferent sides. The Tory looks down from the institution to the man, the\r\nLiberal up from the man to the institution. To the Liberal, the State and\r\nall other institutions within it are things of flesh and blood, they are so\r\nmany expressions of human society, associations of human beings for their\r\nown human purposes. To the Tory, the institution is a machine, its\r\nefficient working is everything, and it is the duty of the individual to\r\nsubordinate himself to that object whether his own interest is served by it\r\nor not. The Liberal says, \"The State is made for man, and not man for the\r\nState.\" The Tory reverses the dogma, and even when he pursues the good of\r\nindividuals, he pursues it rather in order to make them better soldiers or\r\nworkers, that is to say, better servants of the State, than to make them\r\nbetter in themselves. Democratic government to the Liberal is an essential\r\ncondition of the free growth of the individual soul. To the Tory, if he\r\nbelieves in it at all, it is a piece of efficient political machinery.\r\n\"What use can the State make of this man?\" asks the Tory. \"What {24} use\r\ncan this man make of himself?\" asks the Liberal. The Tory theory is\r\nexpressed in terms of duties, the Liberal in terms of rights. The disposing\r\nmind is at the back of the one, the encouraging mind at the back of the\r\nother. The Tory finds the good of the individual in the strength of the\r\nState. The Liberal finds the strength of the State in the good of the\r\nindividual. Where the one seeks to maintain and use, the other seeks to\r\nease, to alter, and to readjust, binding himself to no particular scheme of\r\npolitical or economic construction, but ready to apply to each case of\r\nindividual hardship, as it arises, such devices as he can invent.\r\n\r\nPractical Toryism, the theory as it has been expressed in actual politics,\r\nhas been until recent years the Toryism of a governing class. But no class\r\nhas a monopoly of it. The same habit of mind exists everywhere. There is\r\nnothing so universal as the aristocratic temper, which disposes of the\r\nfortunes of others according to its own sense of what is fitting. The Tory\r\nstatesman of a hundred and fifty years ago was a landowner, a Churchman,\r\nand a man of wealth. But his view of life would have been much the same if\r\nhe had been a tinker, an atheist, and in daily expectation of the\r\nworkhouse. He might, in pursuit of his own class interest, have rebelled\r\nagainst the Toryism of the governing class, without abating any of his own.\r\nTo such persons as came within his disposition he would display the same\r\nzeal for the assertion of his own ego at the expense of theirs, as that\r\nwhich he resented in his own superiors. Even the poorest man has generally\r\na wife, and even the meanest of Englishmen can always speak contemptuously\r\nof foreigners. Toryism is a habit of mind, which is often modified by\r\ncircumstances, but can and does exist in men and women of all classes,\r\nirrespective of wealth, creed, or occupation.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this Tory doctrine is not always crudely stated. The\r\nformula is more often that of identification than that of disposition. If\r\nthe inferior class is so placed that the superior class may dispose of it,\r\nit suffers no hardship, because the interest of both is the same. The\r\npeople are identified with the State, {25} the workmen are identified with\r\nthe employer, the wife is identified with the husband. Make the State\r\nstrong, and you make the people happy. Give the employer higher profits,\r\nand the workmen get higher wages out of those profits. Give the husband\r\nsecurity and freedom, and the wife will partake of them both. But whatever\r\nthe form of argument may be, the result is the same. There is an inevitable\r\ntendency in human nature to deteriorate in the enjoyment of absolute power.\r\nSome governing classes may use the strength of the State to make the people\r\nhappy. Some employers may cheerfully share their increased gains with their\r\nworkpeople. Some husbands may concede to their wives that complete freedom\r\nof occupation, expression of opinion, and control of property which they\r\nthemselves possess. But history and contemporary experience alike afford\r\ninnumerable examples of governing classes oppressing or keeping down their\r\nsubjects, of employers giving higher wages only in response to strong or\r\neven violent pressure from their workmen, and of husbands depriving their\r\nwives of independence of thought and action, and even of the control of\r\ntheir own bodies. There is no security for the individual in the generosity\r\nof superiors. It is only when all are recognized by the State as having\r\nequal worth in their relations with each other that individual liberty can\r\nbe enjoyed by all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe essential differences between Liberalism and Toryism are revealed in\r\ntheir disputes about the larger political topics. The franchise never fails\r\nto draw clear expressions of character from both sides. To the Liberal, the\r\nright of a man to control his own government is only one of the many rights\r\nwhich go to make up his right to control his own life. His freedom of life\r\ncannot be complete if, without his consent, his earnings may be diminished\r\nby taxation, his business ruined by a commercial treaty, the education of\r\nhis children prescribed by legislation, and his whole fortune impaired by a\r\ndeclaration of war. There can be no real freedom of growth without control\r\nof government. But the argument for enfranchisement is based on more than\r\nthe {26} direct consequences of it. That the man who is taxed against his\r\nwill enjoys only an imperfect freedom is obvious. What is not so readily\r\nperceived is that he is indirectly affected in a much more serious way. It\r\nis axiomatic that a governing class will, sooner or later, abuse its\r\nabsolute power. Landowners use the tariff to increase their rents, and so\r\nimpose burdens upon the poor. The middle class prohibits the combination of\r\nworkmen in trade disputes, or resists the regulation of factories by law.\r\nWorking-men exclude working-women from trades which they wish to preserve\r\nfor their own sex. Men erect a system of marriage law which places the wife\r\nin the power of the husband. All this is written in history, and cannot be\r\ndisputed. But the unseen consequences of disfranchisement are not so often\r\nrealized. There is constant action and reaction between political\r\ninstitutions and social estimates. If disfranchisement springs from\r\ndepreciation, it also encourages it. To confine the control of government\r\nto one class is to appreciate that class at the expense of others, and to\r\nencourage its members to abuse their disfranchised associates whenever they\r\nare brought into contact with them. So long as the big business of politics\r\nis reserved for them, so long are they compelled to believe that the\r\nmonopoly is the reward of their superior worth. Their ego is exalted, and\r\nthat of their subjects is depressed. Private insolence is the inevitable\r\nconsequence of public privilege. Government by landlords means interference\r\nwith the political and religious opinions of tenants. Government by\r\nProtestants means the exclusion of Catholics from offices of dignity and\r\nprofit. Government by masters means bad conditions of labour and fettered\r\npowers of combination among workmen. Government by men means the exclusion\r\nof women from professions and the maintenance of a double standard of\r\nmorality. It is not suggested here that disfranchisement does more than\r\naffect tendencies. The political thinker who values his reputation will\r\nalways write in terms of tendencies rather than in terms of states. But\r\ndisfranchisement at least tends to produce, if it does not actually\r\nproduce, the consequences of social depreciation. In some countries, or in\r\n{27} some states of society, these may be less dangerous than the\r\nconsequences of general enfranchisement. But they always exist.\r\n\r\nAn admirable statement of this part of the case for enfranchisement has\r\nbeen recently made by an opponent of Woman Suffrage. \"If you enfranchise\r\nwomen,\" he said, \"you cannot deprive them of the powers and privileges\r\nwhich accompany it. If they are to share men's political duties they must\r\nenjoy his rights, they must be eligible for the Bar, the Bench, for the\r\nCivil Service, and for election to Parliament. Once in Parliament you\r\ncannot brand them as a class or sex apart, to be deprived of any of the\r\nhigh offices open to men. If they are not to attain these offices, it\r\ncannot be by the avowal of sex, but by an admission of incapacity.\"[12]\r\nThis is absolute Toryism. Disfranchisement is a convenient means of\r\ndepreciating women in private life, and the main bulwark of the male ego.\r\nIt disables every woman in advance, and deprives her of private rights\r\nwithout the trouble of testing her capacity. Her political disability marks\r\nher with a brand wherever she goes, and the person who disposes of her\r\npolitics, disposes also, in proportion to his own selfishness, of her\r\noccupation, of her marital rights, and of her honour. Mr. Harcourt is\r\ncontent to exclude her from Parliament and the legal profession. Baser men\r\ndisplay the same male egoism in depriving her of education, in enfeebling\r\nher body and mind by excessive child-bearing, and in taking advantage of\r\nher poverty to use her as a prostitute for the gratification of their\r\nvilest passions. This confession by an opponent of Woman Suffrage\r\nillustrates the temper of Toryism in all controversies about the franchise.\r\nAcknowledge the right to control government, and you acknowledge the right\r\nto control life. So long as it lies in the power of one class to impose\r\ntaxes, to regulate the hours of labour, to admit and to exclude from\r\noccupations, and generally to control the political organization of\r\nsociety, so long will its members be tempted to dispose of the members of\r\nthe subject class in every part of life. When the equality of both classes\r\nin the State is admitted, the admission of their equal worth in all their\r\nprivate {28} relations inevitably follows. There is no essential difference\r\nbetween public and private rights.\r\n\r\nBut the reaction of political status upon the individual has another aspect\r\nno less important than this. Participation in the organized life of the\r\ncommunity is a necessary part of that education which modern opinion\r\nrequires for every human being. There are now living very few of those\r\nfrantic Tories who believe that it is harmful to develop the minds of the\r\npoor, and every civilized State regards public education as one of its\r\nordinary duties. But once the right of individuals to a good education is\r\nadmitted, the extent of the right can hardly be limited to the provision of\r\nelementary or secondary schools. There is no education to be compared with\r\nthe experience of organized life. Trade Unionism and Co-operation,\r\npolitical associations outside Parliament, the management of charities, all\r\nthese are valuable not only for their immediate results, but for the way in\r\nwhich they train the people concerned. Incomparably the best school of the\r\nkind is politics. Nothing so broadens the mind and so disciplines the\r\ntemper as being engaged, even in a humble capacity, in the management of\r\npolitical affairs. But the connection between the individual and the State\r\nmust be direct, if it is to produce its full benefit. The vague and\r\nirresponsible interest of the disfranchised is a poor substitute for the\r\ndefinite obligation to apply one's own strength to the machine itself,\r\nwhich is the privilege of the enfranchised. The extension of the suffrage\r\nto all individuals in the State is thus an essential part of the Liberal\r\nfaith, not only because it prevents direct and indirect abuse, but because\r\nit is a means of education without which few individuals can ever develop\r\ntheir natural powers to the full. \"We, who were reformers from the\r\nbeginning, always said that the enfranchisement of the people was an end in\r\nitself. We said, and we were much derided for saying so, that citizenship\r\nonly gives that self-respect which is the true basis of respect of others,\r\nand without which there is no lasting social order or real morality.\"[13]\r\n\"If the individual is {29} to have a higher feeling of public duty, he must\r\ntake part in the work of the State.... That active interest in the service\r\nof the State, which makes patriotism in the better sense, can hardly arise\r\nwhile the individual's relation to the State is that of a passive recipient\r\nof protection in the exercise of his rights of person and property.\"[14] It\r\nis this conception of the exercise of the franchise which leads to the\r\napparent paradox that the people are never fit for the suffrage until they\r\npossess it. In practice these logical difficulties have little weight. It\r\nis true that the only real test of political capacity is politics. But it\r\nis no hard task to detect in a person's management of other affairs how he\r\nis likely to conduct himself as a voter. Plain good sense is the only\r\nessential quality. It is got by living, not by learning, and where\r\nconditions of life are reasonably good, political capacity will not be\r\nwanting. The franchise completes, it does not make, education. It may thus\r\nbe fairly extended to all ordinary persons as part of the Liberal method of\r\nequipping the individual for the fullest life of which he is capable.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by these considerations, the Liberal asserts that the franchise\r\nis a right which exists in the individual subject. To the Tory, accustomed\r\nto the idea of disposition, the subject is under and not above the State.\r\nWhere the Liberal emphasizes the responsibility of the State to the\r\nsubject, and requires that every act of its ministers shall be done in the\r\ninterest of the subject, the Tory emphasizes the duty of the subject to\r\nsubmit to the State, and by a process of argument which is as illogical as\r\nit is politically vicious, leaves it to the State to decide even to what\r\npersons it shall be responsible. Thus Sir Robert Inglis, opposing in 1853 a\r\nBill for permitting Jews to sit in Parliament, contended \"that power was a\r\ntrust which the State might delegate to those whom it thought fit to\r\nexercise it--the exercise of the suffrage, for example--but it was the\r\ninherent right of no man. If it were, then indeed had they destroyed the\r\nvalue of the principle by all the restrictions imposed with respect to\r\nproperty, {30} to age, and to sex.\"[15] The allusion to sex was prophetic.\r\nMore than half a century later, Professor Dicey uses precisely the same\r\nargument against the enfranchisement of women. \"The rights of an individual\r\nwith regard to matters which primarily concern the State are public or\r\npolitical rights, or, in other words, duties or functions to be exercised\r\nby the possessor not in accordance with his own wish or interest, but\r\nprimarily at least with a view to the interest of the State, and therefore\r\nmay be limited or extended in any way which conduces to the welfare of the\r\ncommunity.\"[16]\r\n\r\nThe confusion of thought in both these passages is the same. What is the\r\nState? Who are the community? How is the State to know what conduces to the\r\nwelfare of the community? Both these Tory thinkers reason as if the State\r\nwere some concrete thing, some piece of machinery, existing out of and\r\nindependent of the society of human beings, managing their affairs,\r\nallotting them their rights, and associating with itself in their\r\ngovernment such of them as it was pleased to select. Their argument is\r\nbased upon this fundamental absurdity. The State has in fact no existence\r\napart from human beings; it is not external to society, but a growth out of\r\nit, and its own form and constitution are determined in all cases by the\r\ncreatures whom the Tory theorists treat as subjected to its absolute\r\ndiscretion. The Liberal declares that human beings exist before the State,\r\nand control it, that their opinion determines in what way the State, like\r\nthe Church, the industrial system, and the home, shall be constructed, that\r\nopinion varies in different countries and in different ages, and will at\r\none time and in one place acquiesce in despotism and at another time and in\r\nanother place require adult suffrage, but that always, first and last, the\r\nsubjects are masters of the State.\r\n\r\nWhat is actually at the back of the Tory mind, when it reasons in this\r\nfashion, is that the State, as conceived by them, is not external to all\r\nsociety, but only to a part of it. In other words, {31} when it says \"the\r\nState,\" it means \"the governing class for the time being.\" It is always\r\nthinking of a privileged class disposing of the fortunes of another class.\r\nTo Sir Robert Inglis \"the State\" meant \"men of twenty-one years of age, who\r\nare landowners and Christians.\" To Windham, fifty years before, it meant\r\n\"men of twenty-one years of age, who are landowners and Churchmen.\" To\r\nProfessor Dicey, fifty years later, it meant \"men of twenty-one years of\r\nage.\" The class varies, and its boundaries extend. But it is always of a\r\nclass of some dimensions that the Tory thinks when he speaks of \"the\r\nState.\" In effect he argues that the general body of men and women have no\r\nright to control their own government, except when the class into whose\r\nhands government has fallen sees fit to give it them. By the same process\r\nof reasoning the most bloody despot who ever usurped a throne could exclude\r\naristocracy itself, and keep the control of government in the hands of the\r\nmeanest of his parasites. This conflict between the individual right of the\r\nsubject and the absolute discretion of the governing class has been\r\nrepeated at every proposal to extend the franchise in Great Britain. The\r\nwork of Liberalism has been, and is still, to extend the limits of the\r\ngoverning class, and to make State and subjects, government and governed,\r\nco-extensive.\r\n\r\nThe same characteristic difference between the desire to adapt an\r\ninstitution to the encouragement of individual growth and the desire to\r\ncompel individual growth to the efficient working of an institution peeps\r\nout, even where the practical proposals of the two parties appear to be\r\nidentical. A Liberal supports State education because it puts the poor man\r\ninto fuller possession of himself. A Tory supports it because an ignorant\r\npoor man is likely to be turbulent and to make attacks upon the institution\r\nof property. A Liberal supports a Mental Deficiency Bill because it\r\nprotects feeble-minded persons against their neighbours and against\r\nthemselves. A Tory supports it because it discourages the breeding of types\r\nwhich he regards as useless to the State. While the general attitude of\r\nToryism to the economic reforms of modern Liberalism has been hostile, a\r\nsmall {32} section of the Tory party has shown itself ready enough to\r\nsupport, and even to originate schemes which interfere with economic\r\nfreedom and the rights of property. But the motives of the Liberal and the\r\nTory social reformers are not the same. The one aims at private happiness,\r\nthe other at public utility. \"We would endeavour,\" said Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, \"to secure to every man the best conditions of living,\r\nand so far as can be done by laws and customs, to secure him also an equal\r\nchance with others of a useful and happy life.\"[17] \"The essence of our\r\npolicy,\" says Lord Willoughby de Broke, \"is to give each individual the\r\nelements that will afford him an opportunity of at least living a free and\r\na decorous existence, and the opportunity to raise himself or herself to\r\nthe highest point of moral and material efficiency.\"[18] The emphasis on\r\nhappiness in the one passage and on efficiency in the other shows precisely\r\nthe difference in the objects of the two men. The first is personal, the\r\nsecond instrumental. The Liberal conception of the State makes the\r\ndevelopment of the individual an end in itself. The Tory conception makes\r\nit a means of public advantage, of obtaining workers for national\r\nindustries and soldiers for national armies, and it is accompanied by\r\nproposals for conscription, protection, and the maintenance of popular\r\neducation at a low level, which are redolent of restriction and\r\nsubordination. A Tory journalist puts the matter more precisely: \"If\r\nUnionism is to recover the confidence of the masses it must recognize their\r\nclaim to a fuller and a happier life. Only in this way can it serve the\r\ngreat causes which it has at heart. We stand for the Empire. An Imperial\r\npeople cannot be built up in squalor and poverty, when every thought is\r\nabsorbed by the provision of the daily bread. We cannot get a hearing for\r\nImperial causes until we have brought happiness into the homes of the\r\npeople.\"[19] The Tory makes its inhabitants happy for the sake of the\r\nEmpire. The Liberal has no use for the Empire unless it makes its\r\ninhabitants happy.\r\n\r\n{33}\r\n\r\nModern Toryism is identified with Imperialism, and, except for the relics\r\nof old controversies between sects, most of the antagonism of Liberal and\r\nTory centres to-day about the Empire. The most definite opposition is to be\r\nobserved in original conceptions. To the Tory, the Empire seems to be\r\nsomething in itself; he is impressed with its size, its wealth, its\r\npopulation; the mere existence of such a huge fabric, efficiently\r\nmaintained, under the national flag, satisfies him. The Liberal is more\r\nconcerned with what the Empire represents, with its maintenance of\r\nindividual liberty, with its development of the subject peoples which it\r\ncontains, with its encouragement to exploitation, with its implied\r\nantagonism to foreign peoples, with its increase of the cost of armaments,\r\nand with its effect upon the temper of domestic government. He is not, as a\r\npractical statesman, concerned to evacuate any part of this vast\r\ninheritance. \"The situation of man is the preceptor of his duty.\" But he\r\nlooks with suspicion upon any attempt to increase it, he encourages every\r\ntransfer of control to local authorities, he insists that where races of an\r\ninferior civilization are incorporated their affairs shall be managed in\r\ntheir interest and not in that of the conquering race, and he views with\r\nconstant apprehension the inclusion of such races because he knows that\r\ntheir despotic government must threaten the existence of his own free\r\ninstitutions. If the Empire is justified at all, it is justified by the\r\nideals which it expresses, and by nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe better Imperial idea was thus described a few years ago by Mr. Joseph\r\nChamberlain: \"We, in our Colonial policy, as fast as we acquire new\r\nterritory and develop it, develop it as trustees of civilization for the\r\ncommerce of the world. We offer in all these markets over which our flag\r\nfloats the same opportunities, the same open field, to foreigners that we\r\noffer to our own subjects, and upon the same terms. In that policy we stand\r\nalone, because all other nations, as fast as they acquire new\r\nterritory--acting, as I believe, most mistakenly in their own interests,\r\nand, above all, in the interests of the countries that they administer--all\r\nother nations seek at once to secure the {34} monopoly for their own\r\nproducts by preferential and other methods.\"[20] These are noble and\r\ngenerous words. The conception of a rich and powerful race extending the\r\nblessings of order, good government, and industrial enterprise into the\r\nbackward parts of the earth for the universal benefit of all mankind is a\r\nmagnificent conception. But if it ever was Imperialism it is not the\r\nImperialism of to-day. In less than ten years the speaker denied himself.\r\nThe trustees of civilization became national egoists, subordinating all\r\nothers to their own ascendancy. The free and open market was made a\r\nnational monopoly, and British subjects arrogated to themselves all the\r\nexclusive privileges which had been \"most mistakenly\" reserved to\r\nthemselves by other nations. The deterioration of generosity has seldom\r\nbeen so swift and so complete. In 1912 Mr. Chamberlain's successor in the\r\nleadership of Protectionist Imperialism makes the exclusion of the\r\nforeigner the very essence of Empire. \"Co-operation in war was a vital\r\nnecessity; but there could never be real co-operation in war unless there\r\nfirst had been co-operation in peace. It was for that reason that Unionists\r\nhad advocated, and intended to advocate, the policy of Imperial preference.\r\nAll the Dominions had urged the Mother Country to adopt in trade--and in\r\neverything else--that principle which would enable one portion of the\r\nEmpire to treat all other portions of the Empire on better terms than were\r\ngiven to the rest of the world.\" The whole basis of the Empire is thus made\r\nto be hostility towards foreign peoples, and instead of war being a hateful\r\nnecessity, undertaken to preserve the ideals for which the Empire stands,\r\nit becomes itself the first object of the Empire, to which all its other\r\npossibilities must be sacrificed.\r\n\r\nThe Empire, as conceived by modern Imperialists, is in fact the negation of\r\nLiberalism. Domestic liberty, local independence, economic freedom, the\r\ndevelopment of inferior races, all must be sacrificed to the idea of an\r\nisolated and mechanically efficient unity. \"The Unionist policy is a policy\r\nof union and strength. The Unionists say: As we are faced by great dangers,\r\n{35} let us hold to the tried and proved national organization which was\r\ndevised to meet such dangers in the past. And they say also: Let us have\r\npeace between the classes, for division in that way is even more dangerous\r\nthan the division of the United Kingdom into its separate tribes or\r\nparishes.... We must keep united or we will be destroyed. But the Unionists\r\ngo farther, and they say: We must be united not only as a United Kingdom\r\nbut as a British Empire. Old England by herself may not have the strength\r\nto face the enormous forces now being arrayed against her. In the same way\r\nthe Dominions by themselves have not the strength to maintain their freedom\r\nagainst possible attacks. Let us therefore combine, and then we shall be\r\nlike the bundle of faggots, impossible to break. Now this policy of\r\nImperial union cannot be achieved by sentiment alone. Sentiment is an\r\nexcellent thing; but as part of the Empire is Dutch and part French, and as\r\neven British colonists tend to forget the Mother Country and look upon\r\ntheir own new country as the centre and the boundary of their patriotism,\r\nwe need the perpetual unifier of material interest. Where a man's treasure\r\nis, there shall his heart be also.\" Therefore we must tax imported\r\nfoodstuffs in order to give a preference to the Colonies. If we do not,\r\n\"What are we to offer to Canada in the way of a material interest strong\r\nenough to make her foreign policy identical with ours?\"[21]\r\n\r\nThis is the subordination of everything to organization. Ireland is to be\r\ngoverned against its will, the poorer classes are to be kept down by force\r\nor by indulgence, the industrial and commercial freedom of the Colonies and\r\nthe Mother Country is to be fettered by artificial bonds of trade, in order\r\nthat {36} Germany may be kept in her place. The illustration of the bundle\r\nof faggots will serve for the Liberal as well as for the Tory. What the\r\nLiberal wants is not a bundle of dead wood, but a group of living and\r\ngrowing trees about a parent stem, each planted freely in the soil and\r\ndrawing from it its own sustenance.\r\n\r\nThe Tory conception of the Empire is in fact very like the old Roman\r\nEmpire, and ominous comparisons are often drawn between the two.[22] The\r\nRoman Empire was a similar gigantic organization, which subordinated all\r\nother ideas to that of strength and unity against external peoples. What\r\nwill preserve the British Empire from the fate of the Roman is what the\r\nRomans omitted, the encouragement of local independence, the sacrifice of\r\nmere mechanical efficiency to that infinite diversity of individual\r\ncivilizations which keeps nations alive. The recent Canadian attempt to\r\nmake a treaty of reciprocity with the United States produced some excellent\r\nexamples of the viciousness of Imperialism. The Liberal Ministry allowed\r\nthe British Ambassador in the States to place his services at the disposal\r\nof the Canadian Government. They assumed that it was not their business to\r\ndictate to the Canadians what commercial arrangements they should or should\r\nnot make with foreign peoples, and they treated a Canadian Government which\r\nhad been in office for seventeen years as properly representative of the\r\nCanadian people. The Tory Imperialists attacked them for assisting the\r\nCanadian Ministry in its negotiations. Their demand, in effect, was that\r\nthe British Government should have at least tacitly disapproved of this\r\nassertion of Canadian independence. For the moment the Canadian people have\r\nrefused to enter into the treaty. Ten years hence they may have changed\r\ntheir minds, and we shall then have a direct conflict between Imperialism\r\nand Canadian Nationalism. The Liberals would allow the Canadians to manage\r\ntheir own affairs as they think best. The Tories, even though they would\r\nrefrain from force, would at least try to bribe {37} them into an\r\nartificial union, which they would not enter of their own free will.\r\n\r\nThe deterioration of Imperialism really dates from the South African War.\r\nThis was the first expression of Imperial unity. But what was that unity\r\nworth, which was employed for the shameful purpose of destroying the local\r\nindependence which it existed only to maintain? The whole justification of\r\nthe Empire was that it enabled communities of different characters to grow\r\nfreely within it, and the war destroyed what war should never have been\r\nundertaken except to preserve. The difference of opinion about that grave\r\nevent marked the characteristic difference between Liberal and Tory. The\r\nlife of the individual parts is everything to the Liberal, and their\r\norganization is only tolerable in so far as it protects and encourages that\r\nlife. It is not to him, as it is to the Tory, a thing in itself, a\r\npermanent segregation of his race from the rest of humanity, a monopoly and\r\na preserve, to be maintained as a weight in the balance of international\r\npower. Nor has he any doubt that the loosely knit federation, which he\r\nprefers, will prove in the end stronger against Foreign enemies than the\r\ndrilled and disciplined union which the Tories want. The Roman Empire\r\ncollapsed because of this unnatural perfection of strength. The native\r\nvigour and independence of its parts were sacrificed to centralization. By\r\nenslaving the minds of her dependents to the Imperial idea, Rome threw\r\nherself open to less organized but more individualistic enemies. By leaving\r\nthe inhabitants of her Dominions to develop themselves according to their\r\nown ideas, and not by managing them as potential weapons against the\r\nforeigner, Great Britain has brought herself to her present strength. A\r\nconscript army may be maintained for an indefinite period by constantly\r\nrenewing the recruits. Nations cannot be renewed, and a conscript Empire\r\nmust inevitably perish of its own rigidity.\r\n\r\nImperialists often speak of the Empire as if it consisted entirely of\r\nself-governing dominions of white men. In fact, by far the greater part of\r\nit is governed despotically, and consists of countries where white men\r\ncannot make permanent settlements. This {38} part of the Empire the Liberal\r\nregards from two points of view. The less civilized or less powerful races\r\nwhich inhabit them are as individual to him as are the Canadians or the\r\nGermans, and are no more to be used by him for his own interest. \"A\r\nsuperior race is bound to observe the highest current morality of the time\r\nin all its dealings with the subject race.\"[23] Order, justice, capital,\r\nthe development of natural resources, and education, with an honest spirit\r\nin the Government, may help rather than retard the growth of the local\r\nlife. But with the benefits of civilization is too often introduced the\r\ntemper of exploitation. Confiscation, massacre, slavery, open or disguised,\r\nand the abuse of native women, have been common enough in the building of\r\nthe Empire, and the conduct of men like Cole of Nairobi and Lewis of\r\nRhodesia shows that the same habit of mind is far from rare at this\r\nday.[24] The modern history of South Africa contains more than one\r\ndisreputable passage of this kind, and if the development of territories\r\nlike Uganda and Batsutoland has been more disinterested, it is only because\r\nthey offered less easy prizes to the rapacity of trading companies and\r\nfinanciers. The primary motive of all our appropriations of territory has\r\nof course been our desire to increase our own wealth, and in most quarters\r\nwe have been more anxious to force the native population into labour for\r\nour profit than to improve their condition or character. The plea that our\r\nEmpire is justified because it elevates inferior races is a piece of cant\r\nwhich has been grafted on to a purely materialistic system. How little\r\nseparates us even now from the old slavery may be seen in the following\r\npassage from a Tory newspaper: \"In all essential qualities of racial\r\nprogress, in self-control, perseverance, reasoning power, and so forth, the\r\nnegro races are far behind the white.... The negro is given new racial\r\nambitions by the acquisition of civil and in some cases of political\r\nrights.... The white South {39} African ... may be forced to reconsider his\r\nwhole native policy.... Education is a frightful source of mischief....\r\nIndustrial education, the painful teaching of toil in civilization, must\r\nprecede the higher development.\"[25] In plain English, we may have to\r\ndisfranchise the coloured voters of Cape Colony, shut up their schools and\r\nchurches, and reduce them to slavery. In just such language did the West\r\nIndian planters reason in the days of Wilberforce, from the fact of\r\ninferiority, through the deprivation of the means of improvement, to the\r\nultimate destruction of character in \"industrial education.\" It is in\r\nproblems of this sort that the Liberal sees the evil side of Empire. It is\r\nmore important to him that the black races of Cape Colony should not be\r\ndeprived of the franchise than that South Africa should be able to assist\r\nGreat Britain in time of war. If the country can only be included in the\r\nEmpire at the cost of this deliberate degradation of the native peoples, it\r\nis better in his eyes that it should become independent. When the Empire\r\nceases to encourage the growth of all peoples within it, the justification\r\nof it has ceased to exist.[26]\r\n\r\nThe badness of this government of less efficient races lies not only in its\r\npossible, and almost inevitable, exploitation of those races themselves,\r\nbut in its reaction upon the people of Great Britain. There are very few\r\nmen who can occupy themselves even with the honest and disinterested\r\nmanagement of the affairs of a subject people without suffering some\r\ndeterioration of their love of liberty. However benevolent despotism may\r\nbe, it is always despotism. The essence of such government as that of India\r\nis to dispose of the fortunes of a people according to our own opinion of\r\nwhat is best for them, and not according to theirs. When it is bad, it is\r\ntyranny. When it is good, as it nearly always is, it is indulgence. It is\r\nnever responsibility. It never {40} seriously contemplates the time when\r\nthe subject shall control his own affairs, or shall even be associated on\r\nequal terms with the foreign conqueror. Those who grow accustomed to this\r\nabsolute power can never work comfortably with free institutions, and the\r\nwhole of the governing race tends to become infected with the disposing\r\nhabit. The business of government becomes more than the spirit of it, the\r\nmechanical successes of administration are applauded, while the\r\nstultification of the general mind is overlooked. Efficiency is exaggerated\r\nat the expense of freedom, criticism of the Ministry is treated as\r\ninsolence, and the right of every intelligent man to interest himself in\r\nthe affairs of his own country is subordinated to the convenience of\r\nofficials.[27] The official always looks up and not down for approval and\r\ncensure, and he cannot depress the eye of his mind when he returns home\r\nfrom one of our foreign dependencies. The Imperialist revival of the last\r\nthirty years has thus coincided, not only with the neglect of domestic\r\naffairs, but with the active suppression of domestic freedom. The foremost\r\nchampions of the House of Lords in 1909 were a retired Viceroy of India and\r\na man who, after a successful career in Egypt, had been the mouthpiece of\r\nBritish insolence in South Africa. The best name in the list of the\r\nopponents of Woman Suffrage is that of the greatest despot that Egypt has\r\never known. \"Is it not just possible,\" asked Cobden in 1860, \"that we may\r\nbecome corrupted at home by the reaction of arbitrary political maxims in\r\nthe East upon our domestic politics, just as Greece and Rome were\r\ndemoralized by their contact with Asia?\"[28] No Liberal who has watched the\r\njoint progress of {41} Imperial expansion and domestic reaction, which has\r\ntaken place since Cobden's death, can answer that searching question in the\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing examination will be sufficient to indicate the scope and the\r\nmethod of the following chapters. They attempt to describe the political\r\ngrowth of the country, from a time when power was confined to a small\r\ndisposing class, to the present day, when we have reached a well-defined\r\nstage on our advance towards complete equality of values. They also deal\r\nwith the varying fortunes of Liberal ideas in foreign policy. The process\r\nseems to the writer to resemble the change from the old Ptolemaic to the\r\nnew Copernican system of Astronomy. The old astronomers believed that the\r\nEarth was the centre of the Universe, and that the planets revolved about\r\nit. The new astronomers discovered that the Earth was not the centre, and\r\nthat the other planets, though they had certain relations with and\r\nattractions for the earth, actually were, in the main, independent of it,\r\nand revolved, like it, about a common centre in orbits of their own.\r\nSimilarly Toryism imagined that the unprivileged sex, classes, and creeds\r\nexisted for no other purpose than fulfilling those duties which related to\r\nitself, and for enjoying those rights which proceeded from itself. It has\r\nbeen compelled to recognize that other individuals, however united with the\r\ndominant class for certain limited purposes, have their independent\r\ninterests, orbits, and personalities. The writer cannot pretend to be\r\nindifferent, as between Liberalism and Toryism. But the last chapter will\r\nbe sufficient proof that he is not over-full of the spirit of mere party.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{42}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL CONDITIONS IN THE REIGN OF GEORGE III\r\n\r\nModern English politics may be fairly said to begin about the accession of\r\nGeorge III. The conflict of Liberalism and Toryism can no doubt be traced\r\nfarther back. But though the same principles may have been at stake during\r\nthe Civil War, or even in the time of the Lollards, the general movement\r\nwas slow, and the connection with modern politics less definite. About the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century society began to group itself more\r\npermanently, and a train of events was started which can be traced\r\ncontinuously to our own time. Movement also became more rapid, and the\r\nappearance of the social fabric has been more changed in the last hundred\r\nand fifty years than it was in the preceding fifteen hundred. It is\r\npossible, therefore, to get a substantially accurate explanation of modern\r\npolitics by a survey of the recent period alone. So many causes have been\r\ncrowded into those few years that the weight of the others is almost\r\nnegligible. The history of Liberalism is, for practical purposes, the\r\nhistory of Liberalism since 1760. This chapter will therefore examine the\r\npolitical condition of England about that date.\r\n\r\nThe political structure changed little between 1760 and 1820. At the end of\r\nthat period, as at its beginning, power was in the hands of a class which\r\nmonopolized every privilege of race, sex, creed, and rank, and disposed, at\r\nits discretion, of the fortunes of all inferior persons. Ireland and the\r\nColonies were subordinated to Great Britain, women to men, Catholics and\r\nDissenters to Churchmen, manufacturers, traders, and workmen to landowners.\r\n{43} The classification of humanity, for political purposes, was complete.\r\nThe machinery of the State was controlled by a governing class, bound to\r\nlisten to the complaints of its subjects, but not submitted to their\r\nauthority. The temper of this class as a whole, though it was nominally\r\ndivided into Tories and Whigs, was essentially Tory. The two sections\r\ndisputed between themselves, and some of the Whigs expressed Liberal\r\nopinions on particular subjects. But the general mental habit of both\r\nparties was that of Toryism. It was not until after the Reform Act of 1832\r\nthat even the germ of a Liberal party made its appearance in English\r\npolitics, and it was not until after the Reform Act of 1867 that such a\r\nparty held office. The history of Liberalism in the early period of its\r\ngrowth is the history of its slow and painful progress through people who\r\ndid not consciously accept it.\r\n\r\nThe general Tory view of political society was most forcibly expressed\r\nafter the French Revolution. The proclamation of the equality of\r\nindividuals which that implied was met by very clear and explicit denials.\r\nIt is obvious that Toryism was thus strung to its highest pitch, and that\r\nit may have been less aggressive in temper before the violence of the\r\nRevolution inflamed it. But though it was exaggerated by the Revolution, it\r\nwas not essentially altered, and the language of the Tories of 1820 may\r\nfairly be taken to illustrate the mental habit of Tories of 1760. The root\r\nprinciple of government was that it should be controlled by the wealthy\r\nowners of land. There was some free voting in towns. But most borough seats\r\ncould be bought, and many were in the absolute disposition of the nearest\r\nlandowner. The owners of freeholds worth forty shillings a year voted in\r\ncounty elections, and were comparatively independent. But no voter, however\r\nsturdy and self-reliant, had a real voice in politics. The landed gentry\r\ntook politics for their business, and if the voter could draw attention to\r\nwhat he conceived to be a grievance, the landowner decided whether any\r\nremedy should be applied. \"The country gentlemen,\" said Lord North, \"are\r\nthe best and most respectable objects of the confidence of the people.\"[29]\r\nWilberforce described {44} the same class as \"the very nerves and ligatures\r\nof the body politic.\"[30] The manufacturing class and traders were looked\r\nupon with a curious and comical jealousy. The great growth of these classes\r\nat the end of the century meant a new form of wealth and a new form of\r\npolitical power, and Sir William Jones probably spoke the feelings of most\r\nof his class when he opposed a motion for the Reform of Parliament in 1793.\r\nHe said \"it had ever been his opinion, since he began his political career,\r\nthat the country had too much of a commercial turn, and that its commerce\r\nwould soon become more than a match for its virtues. The petitioners\r\nproposed a measure that evidently tended to throw weight into a scale which\r\npreponderated too much already. He asserted that boroughs, bought and\r\ncontrolled by men of property, formed the only balance to the commercial\r\ninfluence, which was increasing by too rapid strides, and which ought to be\r\nchecked.\"[31] So Robert Jenkinson, afterwards Earl of Liverpool, \"thought\r\nthe landed interest, which was the stamina of the country, ought to have\r\nthe preponderant weight, the manufacturing and commercial interest the next\r\nplace, and then those whom he styled 'the professional people.'\" He\r\ntherefore opposed attempts to reform Parliament, because \"the counties and\r\nmany of the populous boroughs were required for the return of country\r\ngentlemen. The commercial towns secured the election of certain persons in\r\nthat line, and the close boroughs for the election of the professional\r\npeople.\"[32] He thus divided society into nicely graded classes, and\r\nconstructed the whole political system with a view to securing that each\r\nclass should express just the value which he attached to it. Corrupt town\r\nconstituencies were to be preserved in the constitution in order that the\r\nlanded gentry might preserve their monopoly of politics against the men of\r\ncommerce. But a more striking, because a more innocent, revelation of the\r\narrogance of the dominant class is contained in Lord John Russell's record\r\nof his discovery of intelligence among employers of labour. Russell was a\r\nWhig, and lived long enough to become a Liberal. In 1810, {45} when he was\r\na young man, he made a pilgrimage through England, and solemnly made this\r\nentry in his diary. \"The first of the few remarks still to be made is the\r\nsingular quantity of talent we found amongst the manufacturers. There was\r\nnot one master manufacturer of Manchester or Leeds ... that might not be\r\nset apart as a man of sense, and hardly any that, besides being\r\ntheoretically and practically masters of their own business, were not men\r\nof general reading and information.\"[33] What are we to think of social\r\nestimates, when a young nobleman makes a note of signs of intelligence\r\namong captains of industry in the conscientious spirit in which his modern\r\nsuccessors record traces of civilization among Papuans or the inhabitants\r\nof the Congo? The public privileges of the two classes corresponded with\r\nthese private estimates of their relative importance. Political offices as\r\na matter of course were reserved for the landed proprietors. A trader was\r\nsometimes made a knight or a baronet, but never a peer.[34] The best\r\nappointments in the Army and Navy and what is now called the Civil Service\r\nwere distributed in the same way. A Member of Parliament must have a\r\ndefinite income derived from land.[35] A similar qualification was required\r\nin Justices of the Peace. No one could kill game who was not a landowner,\r\nor a person holding a licence as gamekeeper from a landowner. If a man died\r\nin debt, his plate, furniture, and stock in trade might be seized by his\r\ncreditors, but his land could not. In every way land was invested with\r\npeculiar rights. There were in fact only three ways in which a man might\r\nrise to political importance without being a landowner. A few naval\r\nofficers of high rank had risen from mean beginnings. Servants of the East\r\nIndia Company sometimes acquired vast fortunes in India, and forced their\r\nway into domestic politics by sheer weight of wealth. A lawyer of {46} the\r\nhumblest birth might fight his way up to the Woolsack, and become a peer of\r\nthe realm. But as a rule the ordinary avenues were open only to the\r\nlandowning class.\r\n\r\nThe wage-earning common people were more contemptible than the merchants\r\nand manufacturers. On no account were they to be admitted into the\r\npolitical ring. \"Send the people to the loom and the anvil,\" said Lord\r\nWestmoreland, and there let them earn bread, instead of wasting time at\r\nseditious meetings.[36] \"I do not know,\" said Bishop Horsley, \"what the\r\nmass of the people in any country have to do with the laws but to obey\r\nthem.\"[37] \"It requires no proof,\" said the Lord Justice Clerk from the\r\nbench, \"to show that the British Constitution is the best that ever was\r\nsince the creation of the world, and it is not possible to make it\r\nbetter.... A government in every country should be just like a corporation;\r\nand in this country it is made up of the landed interest, which alone has a\r\nright to be represented; as for the rabble who have nothing but personal\r\nproperty, what hold has the nation upon them?\"[38] So Pitt \"did not\r\nconsider those to be the best friends of the people who were always goading\r\nthem to bring forward petitions, and encouraging the agitation and\r\ndiscussion of political affairs.\"[39] Castlereagh, the last great leader of\r\nthe Tory reaction, \"always maintained that in a representative government\r\nthe preponderance of property and high station was more conducive to order\r\nand general prosperity than that of mob orators or needy adventurers.... He\r\nwas no friend to a system which was to be directed by men who had no other\r\ninfluence than what they could acquire by pandering to the low interests\r\nand lower passions of a misguided rabble.\"[40] The most consistent of all\r\nthe Tories was Windham, a country gentleman of considerable learning and\r\npractical good sense, and the intimate friend of Pitt. He began his\r\npolitical {47} career as a Whig, but turned Tory after the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution, and died without a shred of Whiggery left to him, except a\r\nqualified dislike of the Slave Trade. He seldom lost an opportunity of\r\ndepreciating the common people, and of excluding them from politics. \"He\r\ncould not see the harm there was of preventing all endeavours to explain to\r\na poor, illiterate fellow, whose extent of powers was but barely adequate\r\nto the task of procuring food for his own subsistence, points which had\r\ndivided the opinions of the ablest writers.\"[41] Referring to the case of\r\nBloomfield, a labourer, who wrote a poem called \"The Farmer's Boy,\" he said\r\nthat \"he had doubts how far it was proper to encourage ideas of literary\r\nprofit or renown in those who had been bred to a useful trade.\"[42]\r\nSpeaking against a Bill for the suppression of bull-baiting, he said that\r\nthe petition from Stamford against the Bill came from \"a body of sober,\r\nloyal men, who attended to their several vocations, and never meddled with\r\npolitics.\"[43] When Whitbread introduced a Bill to provide a public school\r\nin every parish, Windham opposed it. \"The increase of this sort of\r\nintroduction to knowledge would only tend to make the people study\r\npolitics, and lay them open to the arts of designing men.\"[44] The\r\npublication of the proceedings in Parliament was to be suppressed for\r\nsimilar reasons. \"The people at large were entitled to justice--they were\r\nentitled to every favour that could be shown to them consistently with\r\ntheir own safety, on which depended their own happiness--they were entitled\r\nto every advantage they could possibly be capable of enjoying, as much as\r\nthe proudest person in the state; but they had not education to enable them\r\nto judge of political affairs.... He confessed he never saw any man of a\r\nlow condition with a newspaper in his hand, and who read any of it, without\r\ncomparing him to a man who was swallowing poison under the hope of {48}\r\nimproving his health.\"[45] Though Windham did not succeed in persuading the\r\nHouse to exclude the reporters, the basis of his case was generally\r\naccepted by the Tory party. Plunket described the working classes in the\r\nsame style as Windham. \"He was willing to allow to them the enjoyment of\r\nevery constitutional privilege which they were entitled to possess; he\r\nnever could consider that nice discussions on the very frame of the\r\nconstitution, on the most essential changes in the institutions and\r\nfundamental laws of the country, were calculated for minds of such\r\nintelligence and cultivation.\"\r\n\r\nPolitics, in a word, were bad for the lower classes. \"These men, the nature\r\nof whose employment and whose education disallowed them to be statesmen,\r\nmight, however, learn enough to become turbulent and discontented\r\nsubjects.\"[46] Government was not to be according to the will of the\r\npeople, who were incapable of directing that will rightly. \"If, to our\r\nmisfortune,\" said Canning, \"we had found a popular assembly existing under\r\nthe direct control of the people, forced to obey its will, and liable to be\r\ndismissed by its authority,... it would have been the duty of wise\r\nlegislators to diminish its overbearing freedom, and to substitute in its\r\nplace a deliberative freedom.\"[47] Even public meetings were only to take\r\nplace under the sanction of the superior class. \"Far was it from him,\" said\r\nCastlereagh, in introducing his Six Acts, \"to call on the House to do\r\nanything that would operate against the ancient and sacred right of the\r\npeople to petition, under the protection and with the sanction of the\r\nmagistrates, or the other constituted authorities of the land.... But\r\nmeetings not called under such authorities, convened by men without\r\ncharacter, rank, or fortune, were in all probability called for improper\r\nobjects, and therefore were a fit subject for the animadversion of the law,\r\nand it was but reasonable that they should assemble under circumstances\r\nthat gave a sort of prima {49} facie security against outrage.\"[48] There\r\nwas a general presumption that a popular meeting was a seditious meeting,\r\nand if any such meeting was held at all, its respectability must be\r\nguaranteed by members of the upper classes. These opinions, aggravated as\r\nthey were by the excesses of the French Revolution, may be taken as fairly\r\nrepresentative of Toryism during the whole of the reign of George III.\r\n\r\nThe natural consequence of this general depreciation of the poorer people\r\nwas that they were injured in other ways than mere disfranchisement. The\r\nwhole scheme of society was so constructed as to prevent them from ever\r\nrising above the station in which they were placed. No facilities were\r\nprovided for their education by the State, in spite of the obvious\r\ninadequacy of private enterprise. A Scottish Act of 1696 had compelled\r\nlandowners to provide schools in every parish of Scotland. But in England\r\nthe neglect was gross and widespread. A Select Committee reported in 1818\r\nthat not more than 570,000 children were publicly educated. As the number\r\nof children of school age was about 2,000,000, this meant that only one\r\nchild in four received any sort of education. As the teaching was often\r\nhopelessly inefficient, the case was much worse even than the figures\r\nthemselves showed; and as affairs had considerably improved during the\r\ntwenty years before the Committee began its inquiry, it would probably be\r\nfair to assume that in 1788, immediately before the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution, only one poor child in ten received any substantial mental\r\ntraining. Lancaster the Quaker began to found schools in 1801, and the\r\nBritish and Foreign and National Societies commenced operations a few years\r\nlater. No systematic teaching of the poor had been previously attempted\r\nexcept by private benevolence. But it must not be supposed that even\r\ncharity was always disinterested. Lurking behind many of these projects was\r\nthe belief in education as a precaution against disorder. Wilberforce spoke\r\nof popular education in language which showed that he believed in it not\r\nmerely because it helped the poorer people to develop their natural\r\ncapacities. Referring to {50} the political disturbances of 1819, he asked,\r\n\"If a proper notion of the sacredness of property had been given to the\r\npeople, would they have passed such resolutions as those by which they had\r\ndisgraced themselves at Barnsley?\"[49] The governing class thus used\r\neducation partly, at any rate, as a measure of police. Ignorant poverty\r\nmeant danger to wealth.\r\n\r\nThe poorer people, being kept in such a state of intellectual degradation,\r\nwere naturally criminal to a far greater degree than at the present day,\r\nand the criminal law punished their offences with such savagery that juries\r\noften acquitted guilty persons rather than expose them to the consequences\r\nof an adverse verdict. In 1819 there were still on the Statute Book two\r\nhundred felonies punishable with death. When it was proposed to substitute\r\ntransportation for life for the death penalty in the case of stealing goods\r\nworth five shillings from a shop, Lord Ellenborough, the Lord Chief\r\nJustice, protested in the House of Lords in the name of himself and all his\r\ncolleagues on the bench.[50] Conspicuous in ferocity were the Game Laws. In\r\n1816 it was made a crime punishable with transportation for seven years for\r\nany person to be found at night in possession of a net or a snare.[51]\r\nSpring-guns and man-traps might be set by any landowner about his premises.\r\nThe public prisons were dens of vice and breeding-places of disease. Women\r\nwere flogged in public till 1817, and in private till 1819, and\r\ntransportation meant prostitution for nine women out of ten, if not on the\r\nvoyage, at any rate after they reached the colony.[52]\r\n\r\nWhile the general state of the common people was so low, some of them had\r\nreligious consolations. Those of them who belonged to the Church of England\r\nwere elevated above Dissenters and Catholics, as country gentlemen were\r\nelevated above themselves. The same habit of mind persisted in religion as\r\nin politics. A particular Church, connected with the ruling class, and\r\nstaffed by {51} its members and dependents, was termed the Church of the\r\nnation. Others existed only on sufferance. The conditions of their\r\nexistence were prescribed by the members of the dominant sect.\r\nFree-thinkers were punished for blasphemous libel. Dissenting Christians,\r\nwhether Protestant or Catholic, were excluded in different degrees from\r\npublic life. Persecution of an active sort was at this date very rare, and\r\nDissenters, at any rate, enjoyed a qualified legal immunity. The Test and\r\nCorporation Acts, passed in the reign of Charles II, were still in force,\r\nand bound practically every public officer to take the sacrament according\r\nto the rites of the Church of England. As a Liberal Churchman of the time\r\nput it, \"The Saviour of the world instituted the Eucharist in commemoration\r\nof His death--an event so tremendous that afflicted Nature hid herself in\r\ndarkness; but the British Legislature has made it a qualification for\r\ngauging beer-barrels and soap-boilers' tubs, for writing Custom-House\r\ndockets and debentures, and for seizing smuggled tea.\"[53] But breaches of\r\nthese Acts were regularly committed, and were regularly covered by the\r\npassing of an annual Act of Indemnity. The Catholics were in much worse\r\ncase. A whole code of penal laws had been contrived against them in the\r\nreign of William III, and in Ireland, where three-fourths of the people\r\nwere Catholics, the code had been a fearful engine of oppression. Catholics\r\nwere by these laws excluded, not only from Parliament and public offices,\r\nbut from the Army and Navy and the legal profession. A Catholic could not\r\nhave a priest as his private chaplain. He could not send his children to be\r\neducated abroad. He could not inherit land. He could not own horses above a\r\ncertain value. The exclusions were still absolute in 1760. The grosser\r\ninterferences with private liberty were, like the Acts against Dissenters,\r\nnot commonly enforced, though so late as 1793 a zealous Scottish Protestant\r\nclaimed his right to tender a Protestant oath to a Catholic landowner, and,\r\non his refusal, to take possession of his estate.[54] But such enjoyments\r\nas were possessed by the members of these inferior Churches, including the\r\ndeliberate {52} mitigations of the existing law, were concessions from\r\ntheir superiors. All was a matter of permission and connivance, and not of\r\nright. It was the benevolence of masters which they had to acknowledge, and\r\nnot the association of equals. \"It is idle to hope,\" said Castlereagh in\r\n1801, \"that Dissenters of any description can ever be so zealously attached\r\nsubjects as those who are of the established religion; but the question is,\r\nwhat system, without hazarding the powers of the State itself, is best\r\ncalculated, if not warmly to attach, at least to disarm the hostility of\r\nthose classes in the community who cannot be got rid of, and must be\r\ngoverned?\" Pitt, eleven years earlier, displayed less insolence, but was as\r\nfirmly opposed to any idea of equality between sects. \"The Dissenters had a\r\nright to enjoy their liberty and property; to entertain their own\r\nspeculative opinions, and to educate their offspring in such religious\r\nprinciples as they approve. But the indispensable necessity of a certain\r\npermanent church establishment, for the good of the state, required that\r\ntoleration should not be extended to an equality.... He had no idea of such\r\nlevelling principles as those which warranted to all citizens an equality\r\nof rights.\"[55] This is the essence of Toryism, to grant to others such\r\nindulgences as we think fit, and to retain the consciousness of our own\r\nsuperior worth and power, even while we refrain from abusing them.\r\n\r\nWithin the borders of Great Britain the Tory philosophy was expressed most\r\ncrudely and practised most universally in the relations of men and women.\r\nWomen were made only for those purposes which they could fulfil in\r\nconnection with men. They must be trained only in those qualities which men\r\nrequired in them, irrespective of their own varying capacities and\r\ndispositions. They must not engage in any occupation where they might\r\ncompete with men. Their political conditions were prescribed by men. Even\r\nthe moral rules which regulated their private conduct were settled by men,\r\nwho degraded the wretched prostitute while they permitted themselves the\r\nindulgence which produced her downfall. When a woman married a man her real\r\n{53} property passed to him for his life and her personal property\r\nabsolutely, and the subordination of her judgment to his, enjoined upon her\r\nby the marriage service, was secured by this deprivation of her economic\r\nindependence. \"The profession of ladies,\" said Mrs. Hannah More, \"to which\r\nthe bent of their instruction should be turned, is that of daughters,\r\nwives, mothers, and mistresses of families.\"[56] \"Men,\" said Mrs. Barbauld,\r\n\"have various departments in life; women have but one.... It is, to be a\r\nwife, a mother, a mistress of a family.\"[57] Association with a man being\r\nthe beginning and end of a woman's course of life, her whole mind was to be\r\ntrained, not according to her capacities, but according to what a man would\r\nwant of her. Almost every contemporary treatise on the education of women\r\nemphasizes the necessity of suppressing the woman's intellect in the\r\npresence of the man's. \"If you have any learning,\" said Dr. Gregory in a\r\nvery popular work, \"keep it a profound secret, especially from the men, who\r\ngenerally look with a jealous and malignant eye on a woman of great parts\r\nand a cultivated understanding.\"[58] \"Young ladies,\" said Mrs. Barbauld,\r\n\"ought only to have such a general tincture of knowledge as to make them\r\nagreeable companions to a man of sense,\"[59] and she persuaded Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Montagu to abandon her scheme of endowing a women's college.\r\nToryism has never elsewhere been so remorseless in warping nature to its\r\nown prejudices, and no slave was ever more carefully trained to\r\nintellectual feebleness and triviality, or more carefully educated in\r\nsubmission and docility towards his master, than was the ordinary young\r\nEnglish lady of the end of the eighteenth century.[60]\r\n\r\nIf this was the general atmosphere of feminine education, it is not\r\ndifficult to understand the ferocious contempt which was poured upon Mary\r\nWollstonecraft, who suggested that women should even take part in affairs\r\nof State. Even Fox, who came nearer to {54} pure Liberalism than almost any\r\nof his contemporaries, spoke with derision of Woman Suffrage.[61] After the\r\ngreat war with France, demonstrations of the working classes in favour of\r\nReform were frequently attended by women. This drew from Castlereagh a\r\ncoarse and brutal condemnation. Speaking in favour of his Six Acts, which\r\nwere intended for the suppression of these popular demonstrations, he said:\r\n\"There was one point on which he should propose no law; it was the part\r\nwhich women had borne in the late transactions, for he trusted that it\r\nwould be sufficient to restrain them from similar conduct in future, to let\r\nthem know that when the French republicans were carrying on their bloody\r\norgies, they could find no female to join them except by ransacking the\r\nbagnios and public brothels. He was happy that no female had attended any\r\npublic meeting in the metropolis. Such a drama would, he trusted, be put an\r\nend to by the innate decorum and the innate sense of modesty which the\r\nwomen in this country possessed, and which would purge the country of this\r\ndisgrace.\"[62] Castlereagh was an honest and chivalrous man according to\r\nthe standards of his time. But which showed the greater appreciation of the\r\nreal worth of woman, and the greater respect for her real interest, the\r\nworkman who permitted her to take an active part in political affairs, or\r\nthe nobleman who hinted that if she so much as showed herself at a public\r\nmeeting, she was no better than a whore?\r\n\r\nEighteenth-century Toryism was less definitely extended beyond the\r\nboundaries of Great Britain than is its modern equivalent. The conception\r\nof a nation as a unit in human society had little weight in politics until\r\nafter the French Revolution. Before that great event the mass of a people\r\nwas regarded more as an appendage to the titular head of the State than as\r\nan aggregate of human beings with claims to control their lives without\r\nforeign interference. It was only when nations came to be regarded as\r\ncollections of individual men and women, whose individual security and\r\nhappiness were the first objects of their government, and no longer as mere\r\nlumps of weight in the {55} balance of power, that the independence of a\r\nnation became an important thing in itself. The revolt of the American\r\nColonies, which fired the train of modern Liberalism, was an assertion not\r\nonly of individual rights as against government, but of the rights of one\r\nhomogeneous and self-contained community against another. But Toryism had a\r\nmore ancient and a more thorough experience in Ireland. A clearer example\r\nof the egoistic use of one nation by another could hardly be found in\r\nhistory. From the day when the first English raiders descended upon the\r\nIrish coast down to the day when George III ascended the throne the\r\nparamount object of the English Government in Ireland had been the\r\nmaintenance of English and not of Irish interests. It was no longer a case\r\nof subjugation and forcible repression. But it was still a case of\r\nconscious and deliberate employment of the territory and resources of a\r\nconquered people for the benefit of the conquerors. The Irish were left the\r\nsemblance of freedom, but they were so hedged round with limitations and\r\nqualifications that they would have resented slavery no more bitterly. The\r\nstrength of their limbs served only to aggravate the fretting of their\r\nchains. They had a Parliament which could legislate only as the English\r\nParliament allowed. They could engage in industry, but only in such\r\nindustries as the English Government, ever jealous for the English\r\nmanufacturer, permitted. They could make goods for export, but the English\r\nGovernment kept the most lucrative branches of foreign and colonial trade\r\nfor its own people, and practically confined the Irish to supplying such\r\ngoods as it required for its own domestic consumption. Englishmen owned\r\nland in Ireland, and spent the rents in England. English clergy owned cures\r\nin Ireland, and did their duties by deputy. The whole system was absentee,\r\nand the fate of Ireland was always decided abroad.\r\n\r\nBut the worst of the grievances of the Irish were the penal laws against\r\nCatholics, by which racial and religious Toryism combined to deprive of\r\nproperty and exclude from public life, not a sect, but almost an entire\r\npeople. Of all the instruments of foreign tyranny, religious disabilities\r\nare the most hateful, and {56} if economic abuses did more to impoverish\r\nthe Irish, the penal laws did most to poison their temper. The Irishman's\r\nenemy pursued him into his most private heart, and as the wound was\r\ndeepest, so the resentment was most fierce. The laws were not enforced so\r\nmercilessly as they had been fifty years before. But they remained on the\r\nStatute Book, and kept alive the memories of the more active persecutions\r\nof the past. The whole nation was thus aggrieved. The Protestants suffered\r\nno less than the Catholics from the legislative and commercial grievances,\r\nand if the religious disabilities tended to sunder the dominant caste from\r\nthe rest of the people, both sects tended to forget their mutual hostility\r\nin their hatred of the common enemy. Towards the end of the century a few\r\nEnglish statesmen foresaw the inevitable explosion, and urged that the\r\nrecognition of Irish nationality was the only way to establish good Irish\r\ngovernment. Not even an Irish Parliament could work if it was closed to the\r\nvast majority of the people. \"The Catholics,\" said Fox, \"are no longer a\r\nparty. The parties now to be dreaded in Ireland are, on the one hand, a few\r\npeople holding places of great emolument, and supporting corruption and\r\nabuses; and, on the other, the Irish nation.... I no longer apprehend any\r\ndanger to Ireland from disputes between the Catholics and the Protestants;\r\nwhat I apprehend is the alienation of the whole Irish people from the\r\nEnglish Government.\"[63] \"God never intended one country to govern\r\nanother,\" said Shelburne, \"but that each country should govern itself.\"[64]\r\n\"In a mighty empire,\" said Dr. Laurence, \"which enjoyed the blessing of a\r\nfree constitution pervading the whole, where two independent Parliaments\r\nexisted, that which was the more illustrious and exalted in character, in\r\nauthority, and in jurisdiction, he should have expected, would have felt it\r\nto be its peculiar duty to cultivate, protect, and foster in the other,\r\nwhatever could be there discovered of the true parliamentary spirit. And\r\nwhat was that spirit? A zealous attachment of each and all to their proper\r\nconstitution, a conscious sense of their own {57} dignity, a reverence for\r\nthemselves, a vehement and a jealous love of independence.\"[65]\r\n\r\nThese Whigs, speaking after the French Revolution had shaken old political\r\nsystems to their foundations, expressed the Liberal theory of the Empire,\r\nthat local control of local affairs is not only the best preventive of\r\nEnglish egoism, but also the best cure for local feuds. But in 1760, thirty\r\nyears before the Revolution, few Englishmen of either party could be\r\npersuaded, in dealing with Ireland, to consult anybody's interest but their\r\nown. In 1778 Bills were introduced to abolish most of the restrictions upon\r\nIrish trade with England and the Colonies. So vehement was the opposition\r\naroused by these proposals that we are assured by a contemporary authority\r\nthat \"a foreign invasion could scarcely have created a greater alarm.\"\r\nPetitions poured in from every quarter except the City of London. Even the\r\nerrors of the English manufacturers displayed their bitter and unreasoning\r\njealousy. An old Statute had permitted the importation of Irish sailcloth.\r\nThis Statute was overlooked, and one of the new Bills proposed, in effect,\r\nto enact what was already law. But this was opposed as fiercely as the\r\nrest, and the most disastrous consequences were predicted from a practice\r\nwhich had been in operation for half a century. The efforts of Burke and\r\nthe other champions of Ireland were powerless in this whirl of selfishness.\r\nMost of the proposed reforms were abandoned, and his disinterested conduct\r\ncost Burke his seat for Bristol.[66] No other events of the time so clearly\r\nshowed how the great majority of Englishmen regarded Ireland.\r\n\r\nSuch was the general scheme of Toryism, an elaborate system of\r\ndistinctions. A small class of male, rich, Church of England landowners\r\ncontrolled and regulated the whole of political society. This class\r\nmonopolized public honours and dignities of every kind, and in each of\r\ntheir separate spheres of aristocracy smaller personages lorded it over\r\nthose without the pale. Some were invested with all the privileges at once,\r\nothers might content themselves with one or two. Everywhere some one was\r\n{58} exalted and some one depressed, irrespective of their natural\r\ncapacities and their intrinsic worth. It is not suggested here that active\r\ntyranny was at all common. The Catholics were not persecuted as they had\r\nbeen in the reign of William III. Dissenters were generally indulged. The\r\neducation of women, bad as it was, was substantially better than in the\r\ntime of the later Stuarts. The working classes enjoyed a much higher degree\r\nof comfort and security than was to be theirs for a century to come. But\r\nthe atmosphere of Toryism remained. The test of a political system is not\r\nhow it operates in a state of equilibrium, but how it shows itself in the\r\nface of changes. Condescension and indulgence are no less the marks of\r\ntyranny than persecution and confiscation, and its essential nature is\r\nrevealed when the inferior asks to be permitted to think and act for\r\nhimself. When economic and psychological changes began to break down the\r\nold acquiescence in arbitrary disposition, Toryism became active, positive,\r\nand subjugating.\r\n\r\nFormally contrasted with the political party which was called Tory, was the\r\npolitical party which was called Whig. In many respects the contrast was no\r\nmore than formal. The fundamental assumptions of the two parties about the\r\ncomparative worth of classes were the same, though the Whigs relied more\r\nthan the Tories upon commercial places like the City of London. In theory\r\nthere was substantial difference between the two conceptions of the State.\r\nThe Tories preferred strong government, and inclined towards the Crown, as\r\nits titular head. The theory of Hobbes thus expressed the Tory mind: \"The\r\nCovenant of the State is made in such a manner as if every man should say\r\nto every man, 'I authorize and give up my right of governing myself to this\r\nman, or to this assembly of men, on this condition, that thou give up thy\r\nright to him, and authorize all his actions in like manner.' This done, the\r\nmultitude so united is called a Commonwealth.\"[67] In this view association\r\nin political society is association in surrender. The essence of it is\r\nsubordination. The Whigs, on the other hand, inclined towards Locke. \"Men\r\n{59} being by nature all free, equal, and independent, no one can be put\r\nout of this estate and subjected to the power of another without his own\r\nconsent. The only way whereby any one divests himself of his natural\r\nliberty, and puts on the bonds of civil society, is by agreeing with other\r\nmen to join and unite into a community.\"[68] The essence of this\r\nassociation was delegation and not surrender. The subject conferred power\r\nwithout abandoning his right to control the use of it. The theory of Locke\r\nwas afterwards incorporated by Rousseau and the other French thinkers into\r\ntheir revolutionary philosophy, and at the end of the eighteenth century\r\nits effect was tremendous. It contains the germ of complete Liberalism, But\r\nin England it was long embedded in a mass of circumstances which prevented\r\nit from attaining to full growth. The people who held it were aristocrats\r\nand landowners, and they converted the potentiality of Liberalism into the\r\nfact of Whiggery. Whiggery, in short, was nothing but Liberalism qualified\r\nby interest.\r\n\r\nTo this extent Whigs and Tories were distinguished. The Whigs, in the line\r\nof old controversies, inclined to Parliament as against the Crown. Society,\r\naccording to Locke, was based upon a sort of contract. Each member, subject\r\nto the corresponding rights of his neighbours, was entitled to enjoy such\r\nproperty as he acquired without interference by others. For the common\r\ngood, certain general rules are contrived by agreement, and the State is\r\nentrusted with all powers necessary for protecting the common interest of\r\nthe whole as well as the separate interests of the individual members. As\r\nthe State affects all, so it must act with the consent of all, and a\r\nrepresentative Parliament is the only means of expressing that consent.\r\nThis argument puts the supreme control of the State in the hands of\r\nParliament. If the Tories had any definite theory of this nature, it was\r\nmore that of Hobbes, who suggested that the State was imposed upon Society\r\nfor the purpose of maintaining order among mutually hostile individuals.\r\nThe two schools of thought were {60} thus led to emphasize, in the one\r\ncase, the need for Parliamentary control, and in the other, the need for a\r\nstrong executive Government. But this theoretic distinction, though it\r\ncontained the seeds of many practical divergences, did not correspond, in\r\nthe year 1760, to any great difference of character. The Whigs as a body\r\nwere aristocratic, they were Protestant, they were Church of England, they\r\nwere territorial, they were male. The sole point in which they were\r\nsubstantially more Liberal than the Tories was the toleration of opinion.\r\nThey inherited from Locke a much more real belief that a man had a right to\r\nthink as he pleased, and to express his opinions as he pleased. They were\r\nmore willing that other people should differ from themselves. They had no\r\ndoubt of their own superiority, but they did not abuse their inferiors.\r\nThey remained themselves orthodox, but they declined to persecute.\r\n\r\nThis general toleration must not be rated at too high a value. Religion was\r\na cold and lifeless thing among the governing class, and the Wesleyan\r\nmovement, which began about this time to breathe a new moral spirit into\r\nthe common people, was treated by the bulk of fashionable society with\r\nextreme contempt. Toleration sprang more often from indifference than from\r\ngenerosity, and when the French Revolution broke out most of the Whig\r\naristocracy deserted to the Established Church as one of the strongholds of\r\nreaction. Religion then became valuable to property. So long as it meant\r\nlittle, they gave it liberty. When restriction became useful to the\r\nmagistrate, liberty was forgotten. It was only a small section of the Whigs\r\nthat, at any particular date between 1760 and 1820, could be found steadily\r\nand conscientiously practising Liberal ideas even in religion. In the early\r\npart of that period Liberalism existed only among the body headed by Lord\r\nRockingham, of whom Edmund Burke was the brains and the tongue. Burke thus\r\nattacked the Catholic disabilities: \"To exclude whole classes of men\r\nentirely from this part of government cannot be considered as absolute\r\nslavery. It only implies a lower and degraded state of citizenship; such is\r\n(with more or less strictness) the condition of all countries in {61} which\r\nan hereditary nobility possess the exclusive rule.\" He admits that \"this\r\nmay be no bad form of government,\" but declares that in the Irish case the\r\nindirect hardships produced by the Protestant ascendancy are more even than\r\nthe indirect. \"They are rivalled, to say the least of the matter, in every\r\nlaborious and lucrative cause of life; while every franchise, every honour,\r\nevery trust, every place down to the very lowest and least confidential\r\n(besides whole professions) is reserved for the master cast.... If they who\r\ncompose the privileged body have not an interest, they must but too\r\nfrequently have motives of pride, passion, petulance, peevish jealousy, a\r\ntyrannic suspicion, to urge them to treat the excluded people with contempt\r\nand rigour.\" This is pure Liberalism, perceiving that the whole man is\r\ndepreciated by his political disabilities.[69] So Fox said of the Catholic\r\nclaims: \"Though they require only qualification for corporations,\r\nParliament, and offices under Government, the object is of great magnitude\r\nto them. It is founded on the great principle of requiring to be placed on\r\na footing of equality with their fellow-subjects.\"[70] This insight was\r\nrare, and it was confined almost entirely to matters of religion.\r\nDiscussion of political and proprietary institutions was as hateful to the\r\nordinary Whig after the Revolution as to any Tory, and even Burke always\r\ndrew the line at Unitarians. This Church had been excluded from the\r\nToleration Act of William III, and in 1792, the year in which Burke wrote\r\nhis _Letter to Langrishe_, Fox introduced a Bill to put them in the same\r\nposition as other Dissenters. Some of the Unitarians, especially Priestley\r\nof Birmingham, had written and spoken in favour of the Revolution, and a\r\nUnitarian society had celebrated the anniversary of the fall of the\r\nBastille. Burke's support of the Catholics may have been partly due to his\r\nreverence for the antiquity of their creed, which was, if anything, more\r\nvenerable and more august than his own. {62} The Unitarians were\r\nrevolutionaries in religion and in politics alike, and were opposed to the\r\nEstablished Church. \"Let them disband as a faction,\" said Burke, \"and let\r\nthem act as individuals; and when I see them with no other views than to\r\nenjoy their own conscience in peace, I for one shall most cheerfully vote\r\nfor their relief.\" Fox was beaten by two to one, and the Unitarians were\r\nnot relieved until the end of the French War.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of this Rockingham section, and the small section which\r\nat a later date took the Liberal view of the French Revolution, there were\r\nno Whigs who showed a real tendency towards Liberalism. They suffered, for\r\nthe most part, no uneasiness at aristocratic monopolies, and had no\r\nillusions about the equal worth of all human beings and their right to\r\nequal opportunities. They believed in a governing class as firmly as the\r\nTories, and but for their religious freedom and their dislike of\r\nprosecutions for seditious libels the Rockingham Whigs were not much better\r\nthan the rest. Government must always remain in the hands of aristocracy.\r\nThere must be an element of representation in order to prevent an abuse of\r\nthe governed by men endowed with absolute power. But representation must be\r\nof classes and interests, and not of persons; and it must always be\r\nqualified by property. \"Nothing is a due and adequate representation of a\r\nState that does not represent its ability as well as its property. But as\r\nability is a vigorous and active principle, and as property is sluggish,\r\ninert, and timid, it can never be safe from the invasions of ability unless\r\nit be out of all proportion in the representation.\"[71] The franchise must\r\nbe confined to men of substance, and so long as there was a fair\r\nrepresentation of all classes, except those who had no property, it was of\r\nlittle importance that whole centres of population had no representatives\r\nat all, while some depopulated districts had almost as many representatives\r\nas electors. The individual voter did not count. He voted as representing\r\nan interest. One manufacturing town would be able to protect the industries\r\nof all. One seaport {63} would maintain the interest of all. It was a\r\nsufficient check on a Government that there was one channel of\r\ncommunication through which its subjects might make their complaints\r\naudible.\r\n\r\nThe elector thus appointed had no power to suggest or to originate. He\r\ncould only check and prevent. So Burke, in his speech on a Bill for\r\nShortening the Duration of Parliaments, said: \"Faithful watchmen we ought\r\nto be over the rights and privileges of the people. But our duty, if we are\r\nqualified for it as we ought, is to give them information, and not to\r\nreceive it from them; we are not to go to school to them to learn the\r\nprinciples of law and government. In doing so we should not dutifully\r\nserve, but we should basely and scandalously betray the people, who are not\r\ncapable of this service by nature, nor in any instance called to it by the\r\nconstitution.... They can well see whether we are tools of a court or their\r\nhonest servants ... but of the particular merits of a measure I have other\r\nstandards.\" Philip Francis was no less explicit: \"In the lowest situations\r\nof life the people know, as well as we do, that wherever personal industry\r\nis encouraged, and property is protected, there must be inequalities of\r\npossession, and consequently distinction of ranks. Then come the form and\r\nthe order, by which the substance is at once defined and preserved.\r\nDistribution and limitation prevent confusion, and government by orders is\r\nthe natural result of property protected by Freedom.\"[72] In plain English,\r\nthe Whigs regarded man not as a political, but as a proprietary animal. The\r\nobject of the State was to protect man as the owner of property. Man as a\r\nliving creature was not its concern. If he could acquire property he came\r\nwithin its consideration. If he could not, it would not help him; he must\r\nfend for himself. He had a right to its protection against interference,\r\nbut he must expect no positive help. Equal worth, equal rights, and equal\r\nopportunities were principles of which the Whigs knew as little as the\r\nTories themselves.\r\n\r\nBetween 1760 and 1820 there were only two prominent Whigs who approached\r\ncomplete Liberalism. Others occasionally used {64} language which led in\r\nthe same direction. Lord Moira was not far away in 1796, when he opposed a\r\nBill for suppressing public meetings. \"He could not believe that the\r\nAlmighty made any part of mankind merely to work and eat like beasts. He\r\nhad endowed man with reasoning faculties, and given him leave to use them.\"\r\nWhitbread was as near when he introduced a Bill to enable justices to fix a\r\nminimum wage instead of leaving workmen to charity and the Poor Law.\r\n\"Charity afflicted the mind of a good man, because it took away his\r\nindependence--a consideration as valuable to the labourer as to the man of\r\nhigh rank.\"[73] But the Whig leaders whose settled habits of mind were most\r\nLiberal were Shelburne and Charles James Fox. Shelburne's Liberalism was\r\ndeep and philosophic, that of Fox impetuous and practical. But both, though\r\nthey were never friendly with each other, had substantially the same\r\nsympathies in all controversies of their time. Shelburne seems to have had\r\nno social prejudices. He was an intimate friend of Bentham the Utilitarian,\r\nof Priestley the Unitarian, of Price the Dissenting parson-economist, and\r\nof Horne Tooke the Radical. He even appointed a Dissenting minister as\r\ntutor to his son. In politics he held opinions which were astonishingly in\r\nadvance of those of his contemporaries. He was a Free Trader. He favoured\r\nthe election of local authorities, the abolition of alehouses, the\r\nencouragement of workmen's clubs and friendly societies, annual national\r\nholidays, cheap county courts, the conversion of prisons into reformatory\r\ninstitutions, and national compulsory education.[74] This practical\r\nLiberalism was inspired by original Liberal theory. The old feudalism and\r\ngovernment by territorial aristocracy must go, and the middle and working\r\nclasses must take its place. After the fall of the Bastille he said: \"The\r\nnonsense of feudality can never be revived.... The Bastille cannot be\r\nrebuilt. The administration of justice {65} and feudality cannot again go\r\ntogether.... The rest ... may be very safely left to public opinion and to\r\nthe light of the times. Public opinion once set free acts like the sea\r\nnever ceasingly, controlling imperceptibly and irresistibly both laws and\r\nministers of laws, reducing and advancing everything to its own level.\"[75]\r\nIn drawing up a series of reflections on society he laid down \"one\r\nfundamental principle, never to be departed from, _to put yourself in the\r\npower of no man_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Constitutional liberty consists in the right of exercising freely every\r\nfaculty of mind or body, which can be exercised without preventing another\r\nman from doing the like.... No man can be trusted with power over\r\nanother.... No gratitude can withstand power. Every man from the monarch\r\ndown to the peasant is sure to abuse it.\"[76] The territorial theory he\r\ndespised. \"It would have been happy if the right of primogeniture was\r\ndestroyed altogether or never had existed.\"[77] He said that the middle and\r\nworking classes were sure to govern England in the long run, and not only\r\npublished an English edition of Condorcet's _Life of Turgot_, in order to\r\nspread sound economic ideas among them, but even proposed to found a\r\nnon-party and Free Trade newspaper to be called _The Neutralist_.[78] He\r\nwelcomed the rise of the new industrial democracy. \"Towns,\" he said, \"will\r\nbe always found the most open to conviction, and among them the tradesmen\r\nand middling class of men. Next to them are the manufacturers [_i.e._, the\r\nworkmen], after which, but at a great distance, comes the mercantile\r\ninterest, for in fact they belong to no country, their wealth is movable,\r\nand they seek to gain by all, which they are in the habit of doing at the\r\nexpense of every principle; but last of all come the country gentlemen and\r\nfarmers, for the former have had both their fortunes and their\r\nunderstandings at a stand ... and the farmers, who, uneducated and centered\r\nin their never-ceasing pursuit of gain, are incapable of comprehending\r\nanything beyond it.\"[79] This frank acceptance of the new order at home and\r\nabroad, and this wise confidence in the good sense of the {66} classes who\r\nwere coming into power contrast very forcibly with the frantic\r\ndenunciations of Jacobinism in which Burke taught most of his\r\ncontemporaries to indulge. Shelburne was generally suspected and disliked\r\nby his associates, and the only explanation seems to be his undisguised\r\nindifference to the conventions of the old order.\r\n\r\nFox was as Liberal in his own way as Shelburne, and if his Liberalism was\r\nless wise, it was much more lively. Even his vices seem not to have\r\nimpaired what was a rare and beautiful nature. He never took sides coldly.\r\nAs a mere debater he excelled. He was a perfect master of words, and no\r\nEnglish orator has ever surpassed him in readiness, in force, in the\r\narrangement of a case, in simplicity and directness of statement. But his\r\nfinest quality was his warmth of heart. He was a very spendthrift of\r\nsympathy, and every speech of his on behalf of the Americans against\r\nEngland, of the Indians against Warren Hastings, of Revolutionary France\r\nagainst her foreign invaders, of the Irish Catholics against their\r\nProtestant oppressors, or of the English common people against their\r\nreactionary Government, had a reality which was absent from the more\r\nsplendid utterances of men like Sheridan. Even Burke, who was allied with\r\nFox in such fierce contests as those about America, Warren Hastings, and\r\nCatholic disabilities, never felt a cause as Fox felt it. Fox had that very\r\nrare and admirable faculty of inserting himself into the very heart of the\r\noppressed and of resenting their wrongs as if they had been his own. Even\r\nin his greatest moments, when he denounced the treatment of the Americans\r\nor of the Hindoos, Burke was external to the object of his sympathy. He was\r\na sort of divine arbiter, condemning wickedness because it violated an\r\neternal principle. Fox was never more than human, and if he was always less\r\nmajestic than Burke, his sensitiveness was far more acute. \"The defeats of\r\ngreat armies of invaders,\" he said, \"always gave me the greatest\r\nsatisfaction in reading history, from Xerxes' time downwards.\"[80] A man\r\nwho can feel the ardour of a patriot in a struggle more than two thousand\r\nyears old may {67} be a bad philosopher, but he is the best possible\r\nchampion of struggling colonies, of oppressed nationalities, and of peoples\r\nwhose governors deprive them of the rights of liberty and discussion. His\r\ndefence of democratic institutions shows how Fox got into the heart of\r\nLiberalism. \"We are compelled to own that it gives a power of which no\r\nother form of government is capable. Why? Because it incorporates every man\r\nwith the State, because it arouses everything that belongs to the soul as\r\nwell as to the body of man; because it makes every individual feel that he\r\nis fighting for himself, and not for another; that it is his own cause, his\r\nown safety, his own concern, his own dignity on the face of the earth, and\r\nhis own interest on the identical soil which he has to maintain.\"[81] It\r\nwas this capacity for seeking human beings rather than forms which made Fox\r\nsuch a champion of liberty during the great war with France. He never\r\nthought out his principles, and his instinct for their application was not\r\nalways unerring. There are some early instances of factious opposition,\r\nwhich do him no credit. But he stood the great test of the French\r\nRevolution, and if others provide posterity with more of the philosophy of\r\nLiberalism than he, no other ever preached it more honestly or more\r\ncourageously in his day.\r\n\r\nWith these exceptions the Whig party of the end of the eighteenth century\r\ncontained few believers in Liberalism. The parties were indeed less sharply\r\ndivided at the accession of George III than they are at the present time.\r\nGroups of statesmen, like the Rockingham Whigs, were united on general\r\nprinciples of government. Districts, like the City of London and\r\nWestminster, showed a general inclination towards democratic institutions.\r\nBut party ties were largely personal, and George III deliberately set\r\nhimself to break down divisions of opinion by bribery and intimidation, and\r\nto consolidate a majority of the Commons in a union which had nothing in\r\ncommon but its subserviency to the Crown. The labels of Whig and Tory could\r\nnot then be applied so surely as those of Liberal and {68} Conservative\r\nto-day. Liberal opinions are therefore to be found only in a state of\r\npartial distribution. The Rockingham Whigs were Liberal in maintaining the\r\nsupremacy of Parliament over the Crown, in claiming the rights of free\r\nelection and free discussion for the electors, in advocating the abolition\r\nof religious disabilities, and especially in defending the American\r\ncolonists against arbitrary government from England. But even they had no\r\nbelief in a wide franchise, and some of them, who lived into the French\r\nRevolution, even became violently reactionary. Liberalism was thus a matter\r\nof patchwork at the best, and it would be difficult to find any\r\nconsiderable party of men who were united in a substantially Liberal\r\npolitical creed until 1868, when Gladstone's first Government came into\r\npower. The general tone of government up to the outbreak of the Revolution\r\nwas Tory, tempered in some quarters by Liberal views of special subjects.\r\nAfter the Revolution, though the general aspect was more definitely Tory, a\r\nreal Liberal appearance was assumed by a small section of the Whig party,\r\nand the growth of modern Liberalism actually began.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{69}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST MOVEMENT TOWARDS LIBERALISM\r\n\r\nThree great events, or series of events, combined to produce the process of\r\nindividual emancipation, which is the subject of this book. The first was\r\nthe economic transformation, called the Industrial Revolution, which began\r\nabout 1760 and ended about 1830. The second was the American Rebellion,\r\nwhich ended in the recognition of the independence of the United States in\r\n1783. The third was the French Revolution, in part at least a consequence\r\nof the American Rebellion, which ended in the establishment of a Republic\r\nin 1793.[82] The first operated to change the conditions of life of the\r\nEnglish people. The second and third operated to communicate to them ideas\r\nfor which their new conditions of life had made them ready. Revolutions are\r\nnever the product of circumstances alone, or of speculation alone. They are\r\nbegotten by speculation acting upon circumstances. New ideas falling upon a\r\npeople who have no reason to seek change bring forth little fruit. New\r\nideas falling upon a people who have cause for discontent may bring forth\r\nfruit a hundredfold. England, at the end of the eighteenth century, was a\r\nsociety in a state of rapid economic {70} change, which produced a\r\ndisposition in the mass of the community to alter institutions adapted for\r\nmore stable conditions. From America and from France came the preaching of\r\nthe right of the individual to control his own life, which precisely suited\r\nthe case of those whom swift alterations of the economic structure exposed\r\nto injury.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this work it is not necessary to examine the industrial\r\nchanges in detail. They had four leading features: the discovery of new\r\nprocesses of manufacture, the invention of machinery, the application of\r\npower, and the improvement of communications. The application of coal,\r\ninstead of wood, to the smelting of iron, and the introduction of powerful\r\nmachinery in the cotton and woollen industries, enormously increased the\r\nproduction of goods, and with that the demand for workpeople and the size\r\nof towns. In 1761 Brindley and the Duke of Bridgewater began constructing\r\ncanals, which enabled goods to be carried about the country in greater bulk\r\nand with more speed than was ever possible with packhorses and carts. James\r\nWatt obtained his first patent for the steam-engine in 1769, and by the end\r\nof the century it was established in almost every industry of importance.\r\nAll these changes combined to increase to an enormous extent the quantity\r\nof manufactured articles. But they did much more. They altered the\r\ndistribution of population, and they altered the whole system upon which\r\nindustry was based. Two things were of vital importance for the working of\r\nthe new inventions. The iron industry had formerly been situated in the\r\nSouth of England, where the forests of Sussex provided ample fuel. The\r\ncoal-beds lay in South Wales and the North of England, and the iron mines\r\nlay conveniently beside them. The iron industry accordingly disappeared\r\nentirely from Sussex, and was re-established in the other districts. The\r\ncoal and iron industries determined the situation of the industries which\r\nrequired steam power and machinery. The cotton industry found another of\r\nits necessities in the climate of Lancashire. The woollen industry was\r\ntransferred from Norfolk, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, and\r\n{71} Devonshire to the West Riding of Yorkshire. These geographical\r\nredistributions of industry, in the course of half a century, shifted the\r\nbulk of the population to the Midlands and the North.\r\n\r\nThe change was not merely geographical. Machinery required additional\r\ncapital expenditure, and steam power must be used on a large scale if it\r\nwas to be profitable. For the old manufacturer, a workman managing tools or\r\na hand machine in his own cottage, was substituted the new manufacturer, a\r\ncapitalist employing large numbers of artisans in his factory, managing his\r\nlarge machines, which were operated by his steam power. The old system was\r\na system of small and scattered master workmen, producing and selling their\r\nown goods. The new system was a system of closely aggregated wage-earners,\r\nproducing goods for a common employer, who provided the machinery, the\r\npower, and the superintendence, and sold the product of their labour for\r\nhis own profit. This feature of the Industrial Revolution was as important\r\nas its redistribution of industry. It meant a considerable loss of\r\nindependence among the working class, and it meant the birth of an entirely\r\nnew class, the employers of labour, whose wealth and importance were\r\ndestined to rival and eventually to surpass that of the landed gentry.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious consequence of these economic changes was the conversion\r\nof the rustic cottager into the town-dwelling artisan, and the growth of\r\nthe towns presented difficulties and created grievances of which previous\r\ngenerations had had little experience. The towns were designed at hazard,\r\nwith little adaptation to the needs of the present, and with no view to the\r\nneeds of the future. They were hastily planned and hastily built. The\r\nproblem of the slum, previously recognized only in London and a few\r\nseaports and country towns, was now to be found in every little factory\r\ntown which sprang up in the potteries, the textile districts, and the coal\r\nand iron districts. Narrow streets, dark courts, houses built back to back,\r\ninadequate sanitary appliances, deficient water-supply, bad drainage, every\r\nevil thing which to-day stares at the sad eyes of progress, was planted at\r\na thousand spots where before there had at least {72} been open country and\r\nfresh air. Factory and housing legislation were unknown. Men toiled twelve\r\nor fourteen hours a day in bad air, in excessive heat or cold, and with\r\ninsufficient light. Women, who had been accustomed to weave, and spin, and\r\nbake, and brew in their own cottage homes, followed their industries into\r\nthe factories. Some of them toiled underground in coalpits. A child of six\r\nmight be worked for fourteen hours a day in a mine, as a chimney sweep, at\r\na potter's oven, or in a cotton mill. Pauper children were farmed out to\r\nemployers under conditions which were no better than slavery. Wages, in the\r\nabsence of any real combination among the workpeople, were at the\r\ndiscretion of the employers, and naturally fell to the lowest possible\r\nlevel. Some trades were better than others, and some employers were better\r\nthan others. But the evidence collected by different Parliamentary\r\nCommittees between 1800 and 1840 is overwhelming proof of general, if not\r\nuniversal, degradation. The managing class seems to have believed that\r\nleisure was dangerous, even for little children, and the poor were made\r\nslaves, lest they should become dissolute.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of life and labour, bad as they were, were often made worse\r\nby the precarious nature of employment. At the present day, invention\r\nseldom inflicts great shocks upon labour. Improvements are constant but\r\ngradual. In the hurry of the Industrial Revolution, invention proceeded at\r\nan accelerating pace, and the introduction of some new appliance into a\r\nsingle industry might reduce the demand for labour by a quarter, or a half,\r\nor even three-quarters, and almost depopulate a town at a single blow. Some\r\ntrades were more fortunate than others in this respect, but almost all\r\nsuffered. All alike were injured by the constant wars in which the country\r\nwas involved. These wasted capital, increased the taxation of the\r\nnecessaries of life, and, by disturbing foreign trade, made profits\r\nspeculative, and so made it difficult for the most benevolent manufacturer\r\nto establish his business upon the basis of high and steady wages for his\r\nworkfolk. The country was never actually invaded, so that industry was\r\nnever ruined, as it was ruined in Germany and other parts of {73} Europe.\r\nEven Napoleon clothed his troops in Yorkshire woollens when he set out to\r\nconquer Russia. But the production of wealth, which so increased in spite\r\nof war, was chiefly for the benefit of the employing and investing classes.\r\nThe share of the working class was undoubtedly much less in proportion than\r\ntheir share under the old system. But their lot was made harder still by\r\nhigh prices, and especially by the high price of corn. The growth of\r\npopulation had, by the end of the eighteenth century, made it impossible\r\nfor the country to supply all the wheat required for domestic consumption.\r\nThe war checked imports, bad harvests reduced the home supply, and a\r\nvicious protective tariff completed the work of natural causes. Between\r\n1785 and 1794 the average price of a quarter of wheat was about 50s.\r\nBetween 1795 and 1801 it was about 87s., and at a later date it rose to a\r\nstill greater height. The industrial population was thus distressed by bad\r\nconditions of life, fluctuations of employment, long hours, low wages, and\r\nhigh prices. When we recollect that this society was composed very largely\r\nof ignorant men, we are not surprised to find many of them disaffected and\r\neven turbulent. The man who knows, or thinks that he knows a remedy for his\r\nmisery is often dangerous. But he is never so dangerous as the man who\r\nknows nothing of causes and effects, has never pondered over a question of\r\neconomics, and, as he has never sought an explanation for the present, can\r\nhave little idea of how he can most wisely direct the future. The progress\r\nof the Industrial Revolution was thus accompanied by suffering and\r\ndiscontent among the labouring population.\r\n\r\nThese economic changes led directly to psychological changes, and the new\r\nthinking was not merely the expression of unreasoning discomfort. An\r\nentirely new class appeared in society. The employers of labour were added\r\nto the other elements of the middle class, the merchants and shipowners,\r\nthe barristers and doctors, and the better sort of clergy and attorneys.\r\nThe new class, larger and more wealthy than any of the others, was\r\ndominated by no traditions, either for good or evil, and it depended for\r\nits existence and growth upon qualities of enterprise and adaptability,\r\nwhich territorial wealth neither required from {74} nor fostered in its\r\nowners. The rise of the capitalist employers meant a great increase in the\r\nLiberal spirit, and their influence eventually broke down the Toryism of\r\nthe old landed interest. The manufacturers were perhaps more Liberal than\r\nthey knew, and their unconscious influence on political habits of mind was\r\nas great as their deliberate expression of new ideas. The whole atmosphere\r\nin which they lived was fatal to Conservatism, and new ideas moved more\r\nrapidly among them than among those who were surrounded by the stereotyped\r\nforms and persisting influences of a feudal land system. Manufacture, by\r\nits constantly changing processes, accustoms those who engage in it to the\r\nidea of continual adaptation and improvement. Its organizers are never\r\nafraid of change in itself, and they always refer established things to\r\nstandards of utility. They are intolerant of any thing which appears to\r\nsubject convenience to forms. The early capitalists were therefore little\r\ndisposed to set much store by the distinctions of sects and orders. They\r\nwere wealthy, and were naturally not inspired by zeal for the wider\r\ndistribution of wealth. They were employers of labour, and were naturally\r\nnot anxious to strengthen labour in its demand for higher wages and better\r\nconditions. But they were ready to accept, not manhood suffrage, but the\r\nreform of rotten boroughs; not the disestablishment of the Church, but the\r\nremoval of the disabilities of Dissenters and Catholics; not social reform,\r\nbut the abolition of the protective tariff; not State education, but the\r\nmitigation of the ferocities of the criminal law; not the appropriation of\r\nthe unearned increment of land, but the destruction of the antiquated\r\nceremonies which made its transfer difficult and expensive. The general\r\neffect of the rise of this class was to strengthen Liberalism, not so much\r\nby a direct assault upon Toryism as by overbearing Conservatism. One\r\npositive piece of Liberal work is due to them. Their whole industrial\r\nsystem was built up in free and open competition. They hated the\r\ninterference of the State, and it was they who, in a subsequent generation,\r\nabolished Protection. But at the time with which this chapter is concerned,\r\ntheir chief value lay in that they had none of the aristocratic Tory's\r\nantipathy {75} to new ideas as such. They had no love of political\r\nmonopolies which were not their own.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Industrial Revolution upon the minds of the working class\r\nwas infinitely more acute. The employers had no aversion to change. The\r\nemployed had every reason to seek for it. While they became, as dwellers in\r\ntowns, more exposed to the infection of new ideas, they encountered new\r\nhardships, which made them more sensitive. Political doctrines, which\r\nhardly stirred the mind of a cottager, dividing his time between\r\nmanufacturing and tilling a small plot of ground in open country, sounded\r\nloudly in the ears of an artisan, quickened by contact with machinery and\r\nconstant intercourse with his fellows in the factory or in the street,\r\ncramped by living in a sunless court in a crowded town, earning a bare\r\nsubsistence by exhausting labour, or thrown out of work by the introduction\r\nof a new machine or the bankruptcy of his employer. Even in the absence of\r\nsystematic education, there is a kind of intellectual development which is\r\ninevitable in industrial society. Friendly societies, Trade Unions, crowded\r\nworkshops, closely packed dwellings, all tend to stimulate the exchange of\r\nideas, and however clumsy the industrial organization of the period may\r\nhave been, it inevitably produced a new quickness of thinking. The\r\ncharacter of that thinking was determined by the conditions of life.\r\n\r\nPolitical disability may have nothing, it cannot have much, to do directly\r\nwith economic distresses. But no people in a state of bodily misery was\r\never yet persuaded by the most logical argument that the one is not\r\nconnected indissolubly with the other. They are wretched. They cannot\r\ncontrol their circumstances. Does it not follow that if they could control\r\ntheir own circumstances they would cease to be wretched? Economic\r\ndiscontent invariably produces political discontent, and that whether the\r\nsufferer has a voice in his government or not. It is always to the\r\nadvantage of society that he should have such a voice. If he has a vote he\r\nmay overturn a Government. But he will not overturn all government. He may\r\nexpel a party. He will not subvert the State. Whether a trade depression\r\nwill produce a {76} revolution or only a General Election depends on\r\nwhether the bulk of the working people are enfranchised or not. In the one\r\ncase the party system provides discontent with an alternative. In the other\r\nthere is no hope of constitutional change. Probably only the excitement of\r\nthe war with France saved England from violent internal disturbances at the\r\nend of the eighteenth century. The sense of national power is a good\r\nanodyne for personal misery, as governing classes have always been aware.\r\nBut if there was no great disaster, there was grave unrest. All\r\ncircumstances combined to make the preaching of new social principles\r\npopular and their application to the existing state of society fierce.\r\n\r\nIt was not merely a vague and general suffering which stimulated political\r\ndiscussion among the working classes at this time. They had definite\r\ngrievances, which were obviously produced by their disfranchisement and\r\ncould only be removed by their admission to political power. When the\r\nIndustrial Revolution began, there was still on the Statute Book the Act of\r\nElizabeth, which allowed the magistrates to fix wages in proportion to the\r\nprevailing local price of corn. It is doubtful whether this method of\r\nestablishing a minimum wage based on the standard of bare subsistence could\r\nhave been used successfully in the new conditions. Country gentlemen might\r\nhave been able to make an accurate guess at a fair wage when industry was\r\nstable and competition not acute. They would certainly be incompetent in\r\nthe age of machinery, of violent fluctuations of trade, and of intense\r\ncompetition between employers. The only people who can ever fix minimum\r\nwages are the employers and workmen themselves, acting through\r\nrepresentatives. But the Act offered at least the opportunity of\r\nexperiment, and any attempt to preserve a decent standard of life among the\r\nworkpeople would have been better than the alternative of leaving the\r\nstandard to the discretion of the employer, who would naturally be disposed\r\nto make it low. The agricultural labourers made several attempts to get\r\ntheir wages fixed in this way.[83] For {77} various reasons the Act was not\r\nenforced, and in 1795 the magistrates began to adopt the alternative of\r\ngranting poor relief regulated by the price of corn. This was the fatal\r\nSpeenhamland policy, which, by securing a subsistence to all labourers,\r\nirrespective of their work, degraded their character by making up wages to\r\nthe subsistence level, whatever their amount, induced employers to reduce\r\nwages for pauper labourers and independent labourers alike, and, by\r\nenormously increasing the burden of rates, seriously injured the whole\r\nagricultural industry.\r\n\r\nA similar experience befell many of the artisans, especially the cotton\r\nweavers. In 1795 Whitbread introduced a Bill, which proposed to apply the\r\nprinciples of the Elizabethan Act to the workers in towns. It was read a\r\nsecond time without opposition, but got no farther. Thirteen years later a\r\nsecond Bill was defeated by the Economists and _laissez faire_. It was\r\nhonestly believed by theorists and by the few practical politicians who,\r\nlike Pitt, were beginning to study political economy, that wages could only\r\nbe fixed by bargaining between employers and employed, and depended upon\r\nthe extent of the wages fund, the amount left after the employers had paid\r\nthe rent of their land, the interest on their capital, and their own\r\nprofits. This fund was always assumed to be fixed. Any attempt to increase\r\nit meant a reduction of profits, and a reduction of profits meant a less\r\ninducement to employers to establish industries, and consequently a\r\nreduction of employment. To some extent the argument was sound. During the\r\nrapid transition from hand labour to machinery, it might have been worth an\r\nemployer's while to employ large numbers of men at low wages rather than a\r\nsmall number of men with expensive machinery. A slight increase of the\r\naverage wage might have turned the balance in favour of the machinery. But\r\nthe argument as a whole ignored two facts. The first was that the\r\ninducement offered to the employers was excessive, and that they might\r\nstill have established as many factories, even if their profits had been\r\nsomewhat less. The second was that an increase in wages {78} would have\r\nbeen followed by increased efficiency and an increased production of\r\nwealth, leaving larger sums to be given to employers and employed alike.\r\nThese considerations did not weigh with the early economists. Wages were\r\nleft to what was called free bargaining, in which the comparatively wealthy\r\nemployer got the better of his comparatively poor workmen.\r\n\r\nThis refusal of redress by legislation was the more exasperating because it\r\nwas accompanied by a prohibition of redress by combination. Parliament\r\nwould neither help the workmen nor allow them to help themselves. Attempts\r\nto organize Trade Unions were discouraged or actively suppressed. In 1799\r\nand 1800 two Combination Acts were passed, which made illegal all contracts\r\nbetween workmen for obtaining an advance in wages, for reducing hours of\r\nemployment, for preventing employers from employing any particular workman,\r\nor for controlling any person in the management of his business. Breach of\r\nthe Acts was made a criminal offence, punishable by fine and\r\nimprisonment.[84] Combinations of employers were nominally prohibited in\r\nprecisely the same way, but in the political circumstances of the time the\r\nlaw was enforced only against the men. Trade Unions, in fact, continued to\r\nexist, and in many trades they succeeded in arranging wages with the\r\nmasters. So long as the relations of employers and employed were friendly,\r\nthe Acts were left alone. But when a strike began they were brought into\r\noperation, and the workpeople were forcibly reminded of the consequences of\r\npolitical impotence. Large numbers of them were thus reduced to the same\r\nstate as the agricultural labourers, and lived on scanty wages, eked out by\r\ncharity and the Poor Law.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Revolution thus gradually transformed society, and created\r\nwhat were substantially two new classes of people, of which the first was\r\nby nature averse to Conservatism, and the second was by circumstances made\r\nrestless and eager for change. The successive events of the American\r\nRebellion and the French Revolution fell upon this changing society like\r\nflame upon {79} stubble. But a few years before the dispute with the\r\nColonies came to a head, there took place a sort of preliminary\r\ndemonstration of the principles which that controversy forced into\r\nprominence. Speculation had brought a small body of Englishmen to definite\r\nsupport of manhood suffrage, annual Parliaments, and the substitution of\r\npledged delegates for representatives with freedom of action. These\r\nprinciples were simply the logical extreme of Liberalism. If every man is\r\nto be regarded as equal with every other, then every man must have a vote.\r\nIf every man ought to have a vote, he must be allowed to exercise it as\r\nsoon as he becomes entitled to it, and therefore Parliament must be\r\ndissolved every year in order to permit the new voters to express their\r\nwishes. If every man ought to have a vote, he must be allowed to vote not\r\nmerely on general principles of policy, but on details, and his\r\nrepresentative must be instructed to vote for or against without using his\r\nown discretion. This abstract reasoning had not affected any large\r\nproportion of the population. The Duke of Richmond was the most\r\ndistinguished of these speculators; John Cartwright, a naval officer, who\r\nafterwards became a major in the militia, was the most voluminous of their\r\nwriters; their most effective workers were men like the clerical Horne\r\nTooke and Wyvil; and their largest following was in the county of\r\nYorkshire. As a political force they counted for nothing at all. But the\r\naffair of Wilkes and the Middlesex election brought the whole subject of\r\nrepresentative government vividly into the public eye, and the political\r\nphilosophers found their doctrines for a short time popular.\r\n\r\nBetween 1768 and 1770 there was a distinct tendency in politics towards the\r\nreform of Parliament, the reduction of the number of rotten boroughs, and\r\nthe restriction of the influence of the Crown. This was produced by bad\r\nharvests and industrial depression. The expulsion of John Wilkes from the\r\nHouse of Commons in 1770 brought this discontent to a head, and provoked\r\nnot only dangerous riots in London, but also violent discussion of\r\npolitical principles. Wilkes was a disreputable person, though not more\r\ndisreputable than some men who enjoyed {80} the confidence of the Crown and\r\nParliament. He was obnoxious to the Government of the day, and after twice\r\nbeating the Tory candidate for Middlesex, was twice expelled from the\r\nHouse. The Government and the House thus asserted their right to refuse to\r\naccept the chosen representative of the electors, and, in effect, to\r\ndictate to them what representative they should choose. It did not require\r\nany pedantic process of reasoning to show that this was the negation of\r\nrepresentative government, even of the qualified representative government\r\nof that time. The right of election is nothing unless it is the right to\r\nelect whom the electors please. Within the metropolitan area the House of\r\nCommons was fiercely attacked, and there was more than one conflict between\r\nthe Courts of Law and the Executive. The main question was whether the\r\nHouse of Commons was to be a private assembly of gentlemen, managing public\r\naffairs as irresponsibly as they managed their own estates, or whether it\r\nwas to be a public assembly, chosen by the community and responsible to it.\r\n\"What were the relations between the House of Commons and the\r\nconstituencies? Could the House dictate to the constituencies whom they\r\nshould elect? If it could, did it not follow that members were neither\r\nrepresentatives nor delegates, but an absolute oligarchy?\" From this the\r\npublic proceeded to inquire not only whether the House was right in\r\nexpelling an elected member, but by what title those who voted in favour of\r\nexpulsion held their own seats. The scandals of the existing system were\r\nobvious. Even at that day, before the growth of the great towns, the\r\ndistribution of seats bore no relation to the figures of the population.\r\nThe county of Cornwall returned as many members as the whole of Scotland.\r\nLondon, Westminster, and Middlesex, the most densely populated part of the\r\nkingdom, returned only eight members, while Cornwall returned forty-four.\r\nOut of 513 English and Welsh members, 254 were returned by only 11,500\r\nvoters, and six constituencies had less than four voters each. Bribery and\r\ncorruption was thus made an easy task. Boroughs were bought and sold like\r\nlanded estates, and Lord Chesterfield complained in {81} 1767 that the\r\nIndian adventurers had so raised prices that mere inherited wealth could\r\nnot compete with them.[85] The expenses of elections were enormous, and in\r\nsome cases reached L30,000 or L40,000.[86] Inside the House, members, who\r\nhad thus acquired their seats either by nomination or by purchase, had\r\nnothing to fear from their constituents, and many of them could be bought\r\nby the Crown with little difficulty. In 1770 no less than 192 of them held\r\noffices under the Crown, and were directly under its influence.[87] A House\r\nof this sort could only be endured without complaint while it acted in\r\nharmony with public opinion. So long as politics were no more than a\r\nbusiness for gentlemen, it mattered little how gentlemen acquired their\r\ninterest in it, or how they employed their interest when they had got it.\r\nBut the disputes about Wilkes made people think that politics concerned the\r\nelectors as well as the legislators, and when the voters of Middlesex found\r\nthat the gentlemen in the House refused to accept their representative,\r\nthey, and other voters like them, began to inquire fiercely into the whole\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nWilkes actually made use of some of the logical Liberal or Radical terms of\r\nspeech for his own purposes. In No. 19 of the _North Briton_, he wrote of\r\nthe right of the people \"to resume the power they have delegated, and to\r\npunish their servants who have abused it,\" and he invited his constituents\r\nto give him their \"instructions.\" Whether Wilkes honestly held the Radical\r\nfaith or not, he preached it with great popularity and success, and he\r\nstood for much more than he was. He was unquestionably a scoundrel. But he\r\nwas expelled from the House because he was a demagogue. Persecution\r\nconverted him from a blackguard into a standard of battle, and \"Wilkes and\r\nLiberty\" became the cry of all who valued free government. Liberty has\r\nalways owed as much to the folly and extravagance of its enemies as to the\r\nwisdom and devotion of its friends.\r\n\r\nThe contest ended in the victory of Wilkes and the electors of {82}\r\nMiddlesex, and the popular ardour was quickly cooled. But two permanent\r\nmarks were left upon English politics. The first was of infinite\r\nimportance, as indicating a breach in the aristocratic monopoly of public\r\naffairs. The public meeting became a regular means of expressing opinion\r\nand of influencing Parliament. In August, 1769, a meeting was held in\r\nWestminster Hall at which seven thousand people were said to be\r\npresent.[88] Many meetings were also held of the freehold voters of the\r\ndifferent counties, who were at this time almost the only independent\r\nvoters in the country. These passed resolutions, sent instructions to their\r\nmembers, and approved petitions.[89] The second permanent change effected\r\nby the Wilkes controversy was the establishment of the Society of the\r\nSupporters of the Bill of Rights. This was founded in 1769 to assist\r\nWilkes, the prime mover being Horne Tooke, the Vicar of Brentford.[90] The\r\nfundamental principles of this Society were Radical, and it proposed to\r\ntest every candidate for Parliament by inviting him to pledge himself to\r\nequal distribution of seats, annual Parliaments, and the exclusion of\r\nplacemen from the Commons, and to take an oath against bribery. The Society\r\nwas soon superseded by the Constitutional Society, which maintained the\r\nsame principles, and from this time political associations outside\r\nParliament have remained a permanent feature of English life.\r\n\r\nWhen the immediate controversy had subsided, the course of domestic\r\npolitics remained uneventful for a few years. The King and Lord North were\r\nslowly buying up the House of Commons, and establishing a practical\r\ndespotism which proved far more dangerous to the public than the more\r\nobvious tyranny of the Stuarts. The Rockingham Whigs looked with jealous\r\neyes upon this revival of their ancient enemy, the power of the Crown. Even\r\nas it stood, Parliament was better than Monarchy. Parliament acted\r\naccording to law, the Crown at its discretion or caprice. Parliament was\r\nresponsible in some {83} measure to the people it governed, the Crown was\r\nnot responsible at all. Parliament was an instrument which could be\r\nwielded, however clumsily, by the nation; the Crown was an active and\r\nindependent agent, which could only be expelled for misbehaviour, after the\r\nmischief had been done. If the Crown were allowed to overcome the\r\nresistance of Parliament, the last check on its power would be gone. This\r\nsmall body of Whigs therefore laboured, though with little success, to\r\nmaintain the purity and independence of the Commons by the exclusion of\r\nplacemen and the reduction of sinecures. The American War brought the whole\r\nquestion of government to an issue, and the struggle, which had seemed to\r\nend in the English Revolution of 1688, was fought out again across the\r\nAtlantic. The dispute between England and the Colonies was simply whether\r\nthe Colonies were to be governed despotically or in accordance with their\r\nown wishes. The stamp duty and the tea duty, which figured so largely in\r\nthe quarrel, imposed no real burden on the Americans, and would not, by\r\nthemselves, have caused any difficulty. Even the elaborate commercial\r\nrestrictions, which used the Colonies for the interest of the Mother\r\nCountry in the same way as they used Ireland, had produced little\r\nill-feeling. What really happened in the first fifteen years of George\r\nIII's reign was that a community of civilized men, united by their common\r\ngeographical situation and common interest, and sundered from an older\r\ncivilization by some thousands of miles of ocean, became resolved no longer\r\nto be governed in accordance with the ideas of that older civilization. The\r\nAmericans, in a word, had acquired a nationality of their own. While the\r\nFrench held Canada, the danger of invasion from the North kept the\r\ncolonists eager for the British connection. The expulsion of the French in\r\n1763 left the colonists free from external menace, and without this\r\npressure towards union, the essential differences of the two societies made\r\nthemselves felt. The dispute about taxation would undoubtedly be settled by\r\nall modern lawyers in favour of England. Parliament had the legal right to\r\nimpose taxes on the Americans, nor was there anything {84} morally wrong in\r\nasking them to contribute to the cost of their own defence. But the\r\nproposal to tax was only evidence of a persisting habit of disposition. The\r\nAmericans were not interested in the affairs of Europe. They preferred to\r\nmanage their own business. The English Government made the fatal error of\r\nfirst irritating them by arbitrary interference, and then alienating them\r\nby force. In 1783 George III acknowledged the independence of the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\nThe war produced a direct conflict between Liberalism and Toryism. Did the\r\nColonies exist for the benefit of the Mother Country or for their own? Had\r\nor had not one section of the Anglo-Saxon race the right to compel another\r\nsection? Was a homogeneous society two thousand miles away to be governed\r\nby an English Government in a way of which it disapproved? Subsequent\r\ngenerations have settled the Empire upon Liberal principles, and have\r\ndecided to treat a colony of white men as an independent nationality. The\r\nTories of the American Rebellion decided otherwise, with disastrous\r\nresults. But in losing the American Colonies, England escaped a greater\r\ndisaster. It was a choice between losing the Colonies and losing domestic\r\nliberty. Never was the relation between foreign and domestic policy more\r\nvividly displayed. Never was it more clearly demonstrated that a political\r\nphilosophy is one and indivisible. The Tories could only conquer in America\r\nby principles which would enable them to conquer in England also. This was\r\nalways present to the minds of the Whigs, who had no doubt that in fighting\r\nfor the Americans they were fighting their old enemy of the Revolution.\r\nLiberalism and Conservatism were in this case identified. The Whigs, in\r\nmaintaining the principle of representative government, were defending an\r\nestablished institution. The Tories, in endeavouring to destroy local\r\nself-government by principles which struck at the root of domestic\r\nself-government, were revolutionaries rushing headlong into reaction. \"I\r\ndeny,\" said one of their champions, \"that there is any such thing as\r\nRepresentation at all in our Constitution, but that the Commons are taken\r\nout of {85} the people, as the democratic part of the Government, not\r\nelected as representatives of the people, but commissioned by them in like\r\nmanner as the Lords are commissioned or appointed by the Crown. If the\r\nCommons were the representatives of the people, the people might control\r\nthem, and the instructions of the electors would be binding upon the\r\nmembers.\"[91] The Whig doctrine, opposed to this negation of Parliament,\r\nwas stated most forcibly by Burke, in his _Address to the King_. In this\r\nmanifesto he said: \"To leave any real freedom to Parliament, freedom must\r\nbe left to the Colonies. A military government is the only substitute for\r\ncivil liberty. That the establishment of such a power in America will\r\nutterly ruin our finances (though its certain effect) is the smallest part\r\nof our concern. It will become an apt, powerful, and certain engine for the\r\ndestruction of our freedom here. Great bodies of armed men, trained to a\r\ncontempt of popular assemblies representative of an English people; kept up\r\nfor the purpose of exacting impositions without their consent and\r\nmaintained by that exaction; instruments in subverting, without any process\r\nof law, great ancient establishments and respected forms of government; set\r\nfree from, and therefore above, the ordinary English tribunals where they\r\nserve,--these men cannot so transform themselves, merely by crossing the\r\nsea, as to behold with love and reverence, and submit with profound\r\nobedience to the very same things in Great Britain which in America they\r\nhad been taught to despise, and had been accustomed to awe and humble....\r\nWe deprecate the effect of the doctrines which must support and countenance\r\nthe government over conquered Englishmen.\"[92]\r\n\r\n{86}\r\n\r\nThe matter was indeed worse than a mere corruption of the army. The people\r\nwho used the army would be as much demoralized as the army itself, and\r\nevery Tory civilian would be converted into an active enemy of his own\r\nfreedom. Burke, whose speeches on this subject are a treasure-house of\r\npolitical wisdom, saw straight into the heart of the matter. \"There are\r\nmany whose whole scheme of freedom is made up of pride, perverseness, and\r\ninsolence. They feel themselves in a state of thraldom, they imagine that\r\ntheir souls are cooped and cabined in unless they have some man, or some\r\nbody of men, dependent on their mercy. This desire of having some one below\r\nthem descends to those who are the very lowest of all, and a Protestant\r\ncobbler, debased by his poverty, but exalted by his share of the ruling\r\nChurch, feels a pride in knowing it is by his generosity alone that the\r\npeer, whose footman's instep he measures, is able to keep his chaplain from\r\na jail. This disposition is the true source of the passion which many men\r\nin very humble life have taken to the American war. _Our_ subjects in\r\nAmerica; _our_ colonies; _our_ dependants.\"[93] It was not argument, but a\r\nhabit of mind, which Burke encountered. Even without a victory in America,\r\nthe corruption of the Tory mind was bad enough. It was precisely in the\r\ntemper of the American War that Tory statesmen, after the French\r\nRevolution, afflicted their own countrymen. But from the utter loss of the\r\ntemper of independence England was saved by the loss of the Colonies. The\r\npower of the Crown seemed to be strong even after the war. But a train of\r\nevents in the mind had been started which could not be stopped, and in\r\nfeet, when George III abandoned his hold over the Americans, he abandoned\r\nalso his hold over the English.\r\n\r\nThis victory was decisive, and it is difficult to see in what other quarter\r\nit could ever have been won. There was no country in Europe where such a\r\ndefinite assertion of the right of {87} a people to control their\r\ngovernment was likely to be made. Even France, where a few years later the\r\nassertion came with ten times greater vigour, owed much to the American\r\nrising. The French Government, which allied itself with the Americans to\r\ninjure its old enemy England, by that very act destroyed itself. The final\r\nresult of its exertions was precisely the opposite of what it intended, and\r\nwhat, at first sight, it achieved. Apparently, it humiliated England and\r\nelevated itself. Actually, it saved England and destroyed itself. Its\r\nsubjects were exposed in America to the fatal contagion of liberty. They\r\nbrought it back to their own country, and in ten years the French\r\nGovernment had perished, and the whole of Europe was infected.\r\n\r\nIt cannot safely be asserted that the Revolution in Europe would have been\r\nso successful but for the American Rebellion. The general ignorance and\r\napathy of the poorer classes, and the general acceptance of established\r\nthings which prevailed among the others, were weights which few Europeans\r\nwould have tried to lift, or could have lifted if they had tried. In the\r\nAmerican Colonies were gathered people of a different complexion. The\r\nRebellion was not that purely noble and disinterested thing which lovers of\r\nliberty would have wished it to be. But the people concerned were such as\r\nmade certain their maintenance of a noble principle, even from bad motives.\r\nThe stocks from which they sprang were among the most vigorous of the\r\nEnglish race. The lives which most of them lived made them hard and\r\nself-reliant. The distance which they lived from the Mother Country\r\nweakened the influences of tradition. Their institutions were in some\r\ndistricts reminiscent of the English. But in general it would be fair to\r\nsay that they had no aristocracy and no privileged Church, land was free to\r\nall, the women were trained to vigour and independence no less than the\r\nmen. Except in a few of the older settlements every circumstance tended to\r\nfoster individuality, and left a man free to raise himself by his own\r\nexertions to positions of dignity and power. As Tom Paine put it in the\r\nSecond Part of his _Rights of Man_, \"So deeply rooted were all the\r\nGovernments of the old world, and so effectually {88} had the tyranny and\r\nthe antiquity of habit established itself over the mind, that no beginning\r\ncould be made in Asia, Africa, or Europe, to reform the political condition\r\nof man. Freedom had been hunted round the globe; reason was considered as\r\nrebellion; and the slavery of fear had made men afraid to think.\" The\r\nsignificance of this great event could hardly be exaggerated. One of the\r\noldest and most powerful monarchies had been humiliated by a people who\r\nproclaimed, as the foundation of their new State, the equality of all\r\nindividuals within it. The presence of the United States was a perpetual\r\nreminder to the discontented and the suffering among the older peoples that\r\nsuccessful revolt was possible, and that constitutions might stand fast\r\nwhich did not confer privileges upon any class in the community. It would\r\nbe absurd to pretend that the American people have not often fallen short\r\nof their own ideals. But the ideals were at least established. It was no\r\nsmall thing that a State should have come into being whose founders\r\nproclaimed in their Declaration of Independence that \"We hold these truths\r\nto be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed\r\nby their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are\r\nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that to secure these rights\r\nGovernments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the\r\nconsent of the governed.\" There are not less than five historical or\r\nlogical errors in that sonorous passage. But it acted on the old world like\r\nthe voice of God among the dry bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion in England seems to have been generally favourable to the war.\r\nOpposition was most marked among the commercial classes, whose trade was\r\nseriously injured by the loss of the colonial market and the destruction of\r\nshipping. Such as it was, it encouraged the organization of public opinion\r\noutside Parliament, which had been previously practised in the affair of\r\nWilkes. The attack was properly directed against the Crown. The City of\r\nLondon led the way in December, 1779, by resolving \"that the various\r\nmeasures which have brought the landed and {89} mercantile interest of this\r\ncountry into its present reduced and deplorable situation could not have\r\nbeen pursued to their actual extremity, had it not been for the abuse of\r\nthe present increased, enormous, and undue influence of the Crown.\" There\r\nfollowed a meeting of the freeholders of Yorkshire. This assembly protested\r\nagainst the multiplication of sinecures and pensions \"from whence the Crown\r\nhad acquired a great and unconstitutional influence, which, if not checked,\r\nmight soon prove fatal to the liberties of this country,\" and a committee\r\nwas appointed to prepare a plan for an association to promote economic\r\nreform and restore the freedom of Parliament. Great excitement was caused\r\nat this meeting by the indiscreet remarks of a gentleman called Smelt, who\r\nhad been one of the tutors of the Prince of Wales. He appears to have\r\nargued that the King's influence was too little rather than too great, and\r\nthe indignation produced by his remarks shows how widely independent\r\nopinion dissented from the servility of Parliament.[94] Similar meetings\r\nwere held in nearly thirty different counties and boroughs, and in most of\r\nthem committees of correspondence were appointed. Deputies from some of\r\nthese committees met in London in March, under the chairmanship of Wyvil,\r\nthe Yorkshire clergyman. The deputies published a memorial which described\r\nthe state of government as \"a despotic system,\" declared that \"the whole\r\ncapacity of popular freedom had been struck at,\" and referred in plain\r\nterms to the \"venal majority\" in the House of Commons. The memorial\r\ndemanded that one hundred new members should be sent to Westminster to\r\nrepresent the counties.[95]\r\n\r\nThis external pressure produced some effect even upon Parliament, corrupt\r\nthough it was. In April the House of Commons resolved by a majority of\r\neighteen \"that the influence of the Crown has increased, is increasing, and\r\nought to be diminished.\" Resolutions in favour of economical reforms were\r\npassed without divisions, and Burke introduced a Bill for reducing\r\nexpenditure {90} by about L200,000 a year and for abolishing some of the\r\nworst of the sinecures. But the tide soon ceased to flow in Parliament. The\r\nGordon Riots in June, 1780, gave the Tories a very useful weapon against\r\npopular agitation. The Duke of Richmond actually introduced a Bill for\r\nmanhood suffrage and annual Parliaments on the very day when the Protestant\r\nmob began the work of plunder and arson. But any attempt at political\r\nreform was at this time hopeless. There was no unanimity among the\r\nreformers. The Duke of Richmond was a logical Radical. Fox supported annual\r\nParliaments and opposed manhood suffrage. Burke, who was active in\r\nproposals to suppress corruption, would not accept even triennial\r\nParliaments, and though he had no objection to slight changes in the\r\ndistribution of seats, hated equally all drastic changes in the franchise\r\nand in the composition of the House of Commons. A dissolution of Parliament\r\nand an election, at which the King spent nearly L50,000 in buying votes,\r\nstrengthened the Tory Government, and even Burke's plans for economical\r\nreforms were generally defeated.\r\n\r\nThe campaign in the country persisted, and in May, 1782, William Pitt\r\nrevived the question of political reform in the House of Commons. There can\r\nbe no doubt that Pitt was then and for some time afterwards in favour of\r\nconsiderable changes, and but for the accident of the French Revolution, he\r\nwould probably have abolished many of the rotten boroughs and extended the\r\nfranchise by the end of the eighteenth century. His speech of 1782 was\r\nhardly less vigorous in its denunciations of royal and aristocratic\r\ninfluence than were the speeches of Fox in the House and those of the\r\ncountry meetings outside it. But he was at this time only a new member,\r\nwith none of that mastery of the assembly which he afterwards acquired. His\r\nmotion for a Special Committee was beaten by 161 votes to 141, and fifty\r\nyears elapsed before the cause received such powerful support again. Pitt\r\ndid indeed introduce a Bill in 1785 which provided for the purchase of a\r\ncertain number of rotten boroughs and the transfer of their members to the\r\ncounties and London, and for the establishment of a permanent compensation\r\nfund which should be {91} applied to similar objects in future years, as\r\nthe population passed to the unrepresented industrial towns of the North.\r\nBut in this scheme he acted without his colleagues. By 248 votes to 174 the\r\nHouse refused him leave to introduce the Bill, and he never made a second\r\nattempt. Five years later the French Revolution made him a determined\r\nopponent of the cause which he had once supported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as Parliament was concerned, the Liberal movement for political\r\nreform made no headway. In other channels the Liberal tide moved quietly\r\nbut steadily. In 1778 relief was obtained by the Roman Catholics from some\r\nof their worst disabilities. In that year Sir George Savile's Bill\r\nabolishing the penalties upon priests and Jesuits who were found teaching\r\nin schools, and the infamous rule which dispossessed a Papist owner of real\r\nproperty in favour of the next Protestant heir, was passed in both Houses\r\nwithout opposition. But even this slight measure of justice aroused great\r\nhostility in the country, and two years later the Gordon Riots showed that\r\nthe persecuting zeal of Protestantism was not yet dead. The Dissenters were\r\nthe next to move, but in their case Conservatism was too powerful. In 1787,\r\ndissatisfied with the annual Acts of Indemnity, which preserved the stigma\r\nof inferiority while relieving them of its legal penalties, the\r\nPresbyterians, Independents, and Baptists attempted to procure the repeal\r\nof the Test Act and the Corporation Act. Their case was presented in the\r\nHouse of Commons by a Churchman named Beaufoy in 1787 and again in 1789.\r\nNorth opposed him on the grounds that abolition would endanger the\r\nEstablished Church, which was an essential part of the British\r\nConstitution. Fox took the true Liberal view, declared that no Church\r\nshould be Established which was not the Church of the majority of the\r\npeople, and went so far as to say that \"if the majority of the people of\r\nEngland should ever be for the abolition of the Established Church, in such\r\na case the abolition ought immediately to follow.\" Pitt was no bigot, but\r\nconsulted the Archbishop of Canterbury. A meeting of the {92} Bishops\r\ndecided against abolition by ten votes to two.[96] Pitt, therefore spoke\r\nagainst the motion, which was defeated.[97] But the cause was not hopeless.\r\nThe voting in 1787 was 178 against 100. In 1789 it was 122 against 102. But\r\nin 1792, when a similar motion was made by Fox, the conditions were\r\naltered. The French Revolution had broken out. The property of the French\r\nChurch had been confiscated. Dr. Priestley, the most copious of the\r\nDissenting writers, had expressed his desire to disestablish the English\r\nChurch. Dr. Price, the most popular of the Dissenting preachers, had\r\npraised the acts of the French revolutionaries. All the fears of reaction\r\nrallied to support the Establishment, and the motion was beaten by 296\r\nvotes to 105. It was not brought forward again for nearly forty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right of free discussion, so essential to the maintenance of political\r\nand religious liberty, gained some additional protection in 1791, when\r\nFox's Libel Act was passed. Prior to that date juries had been confined in\r\nlibel cases to answering two questions: was the document published? and\r\nwhat did its words mean? The judge then decided whether the meaning put\r\nupon the words by the jury constituted a libel or not. This system gave a\r\ngreat advantage to the Government in all cases of seditious or blasphemous\r\nlibel, and prosecutions of printers and journalists were very common. The\r\njudge was a lawyer, and probably Tory in his opinions. He was connected\r\nwith Government, with the propertied classes, and with the Established\r\nChurch. Any attack on existing political, proprietary, or religious\r\ninstitutions was therefore tested by a man who was probably prejudiced in\r\nfavour of all three, and might actually have defended in the House of Lords\r\nthe policy which had been attacked by the prisoner at the bar. Judges like\r\nLord Mansfield and Lord Camden had shown themselves, during the Wilkes\r\ncontroversy, to be honourable and upright. But the danger existed, and even\r\nif the judge's power was not consciously abused, it was always {93} liable\r\nto be affected by class prejudice.[98] Fox's Libel Act gave to the jury the\r\nright to decide whether a publication was libellous or not. After the\r\noutbreak of the French Revolution, when the middle classes showed\r\nthemselves as bigoted as the upper, even trial by jury was but a poor\r\nprotection to an avowed Republican or atheist. But the new principle was\r\nsafer than the old, and it was something even to have asserted that a man's\r\npolitical opinions should be judged by his fellow-subjects, and not by a\r\nmember of the governing class. The Act implied, in the minds of those who\r\nvoted for it, a reversal of the old conception of State and subject. So\r\nlong as the supremacy of the State was assumed, criticism of government was\r\ninevitably regarded as improper. It was, in effect, the servant rebuking\r\nthe master. On the other hand, when the right of the subject to control the\r\nState becomes the basis of political reasoning, criticism of government is\r\nno more than the master rebuking the servant. The passing of Fox's Libel\r\nAct is a proof that political minds were in a state of transition, and\r\nsuggests, no less than Pitt's proposals for reform, that but for the French\r\nRevolution political estimates might have been revised, and political\r\ninstitutions readjusted, at a much earlier date than they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne other transaction of this period is of importance in the history of\r\nLiberalism. In 1785 the House of Commons resolved that Warren Hastings\r\nshould be impeached for his conduct of affairs in India. Hastings had been\r\nGovernor-General under the East India Company, whose territory and\r\ninfluence had been enormously increased since the victories of Clive and\r\nthe expulsion of the French twenty years before. The prime mover in the\r\nimpeachment was Burke, who devoted to the preparation of the charges and\r\nthe conduct of the trial enormous industry, and an eloquence so tremendous\r\nthat to this day no man can read his speeches without shaking with horror\r\nand indignation. {94} The Company had been guilty of every vice which the\r\ndisposing mind displays when it is brought into contact with weaker\r\npeoples. It had developed the art of exploitation to perfection. Its agents\r\nwere in the country to make money for their shareholders, and in pursuing\r\nthe interest of their shareholders they did not forget their own. The\r\nnatives were exposed to a double confiscation, and every consideration of\r\ngood government was not seldom subordinated to this universal rapacity. The\r\nagents bribed and forged, they abused judicial process, they broke treaties\r\nand sold their allies, they made war upon those peoples whom it was\r\nconvenient to treat as their enemies, and when they wanted an excuse for a\r\ncampaign of their own they hired out British soldiers to a native\r\ndestroyer, and entrusted to him the work of massacre and pillage which they\r\nwere unwilling to undertake themselves. The inhabitants of India were not\r\nat that time acquainted with the classics. Had they been, they might more\r\nthan once have quoted with grim justice against the British those words\r\nwhich the Latin historian put into the mouth of one of their own ancestors:\r\n\"Slaughter and plunder are in their vocabulary synonymous with Empire, and\r\nwhen they have made a desert they call it peace.\"[99]\r\n\r\nHastings was in fact incomparably better than his predecessors, and after\r\nthe trial had dragged on for more than seven years he was acquitted by the\r\nLords. But the proceedings had established the great principle that\r\nmorality is to be observed by white races in dealing with black, and that\r\neven though forms of government may be different, the objects of government\r\nare the same in all parts of the world, the happiness of the governed and\r\nnot the enrichment of the governor. The impeachment cost Burke fourteen\r\nyears of unremitting labour. But though he failed in his immediate object,\r\nand though the improvement in the methods of Indian government was slow,\r\nthe permanent effects of his work remained. Burke's speeches were often\r\novercharged, and if {95} Hastings had been as bad as Burke believed him to\r\nbe, he would have been supernaturally bad. But indignation on behalf of an\r\nalien race is not so common that we can afford to spare even its excess. A\r\nlater generation of Englishmen, reading some of the sorry pages in the\r\nhistory of our modern Empire, may regret the absence from us of Burke's\r\nimagination, sympathy, and inexhaustible wrath. Acts of Parliament passed\r\nin 1772 and 1784 gave the Crown political control over the East India\r\nCompany, and the complete transfer of the Company's rights in 1858\r\nestablished the government of India upon a political and no longer upon a\r\ncommercial basis. Blemishes there are still, but there are few systems of\r\ngovernment in the world which are less influenced by the desire to promote\r\nthe selfish ends of the governors. The transformation of English opinion\r\nwith regard to India began with Burke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the French Revolution there seemed to be a very good prospect\r\nof reforms in the English Constitution. The Catholics had made an actual\r\nadvance. The Dissenters had every reason to be hopeful. The Tory leader\r\nhimself had shown sympathy with free election and the enfranchisement of\r\nthe new industrial districts. But the fate of English liberties lay in the\r\nhands of the French Government. If Turgot and the French reformers had had\r\ntheir way, the Revolution might have been averted, or at least mitigated.\r\nThe triumph of the French privileged classes made reform impossible, and\r\nmade it certain that revolution would be violent and universal. In May,\r\n1776, Louis XVI, impelled by faction and his bad wife, dismissed the one\r\nstatesman who could have made absolute monarchy tolerable to the French\r\npeople. By the end of 1793 he and the Queen had perished on the scaffold,\r\nthe nobility were dead or in exile, and a French Republic was proclaiming\r\nwith even greater emphasis than the American the doctrines of individuality\r\nand natural right. The shock to established things was terrific. This was\r\nnot a matter of a handful of colonists in a remote part of the world. It\r\nwas a whole nation, and that {96} in the heart of Europe, which had not\r\nonly risen against monarchy but had destroyed it, and with it aristocracy\r\nand the Church. Every institution upon which political society was based\r\nhad vanished in the flood, and the French people, not content with\r\nestablishing new principles at home, were calling upon the common people\r\nabroad to do the like, and were announcing their intention of carrying help\r\nwherever it was required. It is difficult to imagine in these days with\r\nwhat feelings those who believed in class distinctions and privileges and\r\nthe aristocratic monopoly of government witnessed the triumph of an\r\nassembly which issued this Declaration of Rights.\r\n\r\n\"I. Men are born, and always continue, free and equal in respect of their\r\nrights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be founded only on public\r\nutility.\r\n\r\n\"II. The end of all political associations is the preservation of the\r\nnatural and imprescriptible rights of man; and these rights are liberty,\r\nproperty, security, and resistance to oppression.\r\n\r\n\"III. The nation is essentially the source of all sovereignty; nor can any\r\nindividual or any body of men be entitled to any authority which is not\r\nexpressly derived from it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Declaration affords as ample material for criticism on logical and\r\nhistorical grounds as the American Declaration of Independence. But its\r\nplain meaning was the same: that the subordination of the individual to the\r\ninstitution was at an end, and that everything in politics was to be tested\r\nin future by its effect upon human beings, irrespective of their rank,\r\nwealth, creed, or occupation, or sex. In a word, it was the source of\r\nmodern Liberalism.\r\n\r\nIn England the Revolution was at first regarded with general approbation,\r\nor at least indifferent curiosity. To Whigs like Fox and Mackintosh, as\r\nwell as to Radicals like Price and Cartwright, it was a matter of\r\nexultation to see the end of absolute monarchy in France. Even a Tory might\r\nview with equanimity the summoning of a French Assembly which bore some\r\nresemblance to the English. Even a lawyer might rejoice at the fall of the\r\nBastille, the symbol of arbitrary government, {97} and the negation of the\r\nEnglish rule of law. But as the Revolution swept beyond the constitutional\r\nforms, when the mob broke loose in Paris, when the King's head was cut off,\r\nwhen the heads of men and women who were noble in character as well as rank\r\nwere carried through the streets on pikes, when the property of the Church\r\nwas confiscated, and when members of the old nobility of the most splendid\r\nnation in Europe exhibited their destitution in every town of England, the\r\nbulk of the English people hurried into reaction. If anything beyond the\r\nmere excesses of the Revolution was required to turn a timid friend into a\r\nfrantic enemy, it was the Assembly's proclamation of its intention to help\r\nall other peoples to follow its example. There is no people which hates\r\npolitical bloodshed more than the English. There is no people which more\r\nstubbornly resents foreign interference in its domestic affairs. Both these\r\nnational characteristics were offended by the Revolution, and their offence\r\nwas the opportunity of Toryism. Burke's _Reflections on the Late Revolution\r\nin France_ was published in 1791, and gave voice to the national dislike of\r\nviolent political changes. The book, with its deep reading of human nature,\r\nits insistence on the continuity of national growth, and its contempt for\r\nthose who thought to alter a political society by reasoning in the\r\nabstract, was the wisest book which the Revolution produced on either side.\r\nBut it was full of errors of fact, and it made no allowances for the\r\nhorrible suffering which the old system had imposed upon the common people\r\nof France. If it expressed the opinions of a wise Conservatism, it was also\r\nmade the textbook of selfishness and monopoly. Every person who owned\r\nproperty or privilege was roused by it into hatred of any change which\r\nthreatened to extend the political rights of the majority. The governing\r\nclass marshalled itself to defend its own. From the moment when Burke\r\npublished his book to the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, hardly a single Liberal measure was passed into law. The fate of\r\nthe Dissenters has already been described. Parliamentary Reform fared no\r\nbetter. In 1792, 1793, and 1795 Charles Grey, afterwards Earl Grey, brought\r\nthe subject {98} before the House of Commons. In 1782 Pitt had been beaten\r\nby 161 votes to 141. In 1793 Grey was beaten by 282 to 41, and in 1793 by\r\n258 to 63. The Dissenters were not admitted to public offices till 1828.\r\nThe Catholics had to wait till 1829. Parliament was not reformed till 1832.\r\nNor was the Tory spirit displayed simply in neglect. It was active and\r\nvicious. During the long interval between the beginning of the Revolution\r\nand the triumph of the Whigs in 1831, the Press was gagged, political\r\nassociations were broken up, combinations of workmen were prohibited, the\r\nHabeas Corpus Act was suspended, public meetings were forbidden or\r\nviolently dispersed, and large numbers of worthy and respectable men were\r\ntransported or kept in prison, in many cases without trial. Free\r\ninstitutions endured, but they ceased to operate. Liberty was kept, but in\r\nchains.\r\n\r\nThe man who determined the course of this reaction was William Pitt, and\r\nthough much of its evil must be ascribed to the state of general opinion,\r\nhis personal responsibility was very great. He seems to have assumed that\r\nfailure would follow every attempt at change, and though he was in favour\r\nof the Reform of Parliament, of Catholic Emancipation, of Free Trade, and\r\nof the Abolition of the Slave Trade, and was not hostile to the removal of\r\nthe disabilities of Dissenters, he abated every one of his principles\r\nwithout seriously attempting to put them into practice. He was one of the\r\ngreatest politicians and one of the worst statesmen England has ever had.\r\nHe managed Parliament with astonishing success, and hardly ever used it for\r\na good purpose. His failure to reform the House of Commons increased\r\ndiscontent and made government more difficult. His failure to emancipate\r\nthe Catholics before the Union with Ireland was the final and decisive\r\ncause of the Rebellion of 1798, and his failure to emancipate them after\r\nthe Union was the chief reason why that measure did nothing to improve the\r\ncondition of Ireland or its relations with England. His failure to abolish\r\nthe Slave Trade, when even Tories like Windham were against it, prolonged\r\nfor twenty years a system of human misery and {99} degradation such as had\r\nnever been known in any civilized part of the world. His system of finance\r\nburdened the country with an unnecessary load of debt. His failure to\r\nadjust the customs tariff to the new conditions of a population which was\r\nno longer self-sufficing increased distress and discontent with it. His\r\nchief enterprise, the war with France, was begun in folly and conducted\r\nwith incompetence, and it was not until after his death that it was\r\nefficiently conducted to a successful issue. The one thing which he did was\r\nto maintain a strong central government in the United Kingdom. But to this\r\nmaintenance of government he sacrificed almost everything for which\r\ngovernment exists. \"The Pilot who weathered the storm\" flung all the cargo\r\nout of the ship, and steered her from the high seas into dangerous\r\nshallows, from some of which she has not yet escaped.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{100}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND ENGLISH OPINION\r\n\r\nThe Revolution affected English society in two directly opposite ways. It\r\nis unquestionable that its violence drove the majority into hostility not\r\nonly to Revolution, but to Reform. But many men and women welcomed the\r\ntriumph of its principles with an enthusiasm which was almost as\r\nextravagant as the opposition of the rest. Those who had preached equality\r\nin the days of Wilkes and the American War were encouraged to greater zeal,\r\nand the bigness of the new shock awakened interest in masses of people who\r\nhad previously been apathetic. The Industrial Revolution had by this time\r\nproduced much of the social alteration of which some account has already\r\nbeen given, and the artisans of the North offered a fertile soil for\r\ndoctrines which had previously fallen on barren ground. Political\r\nspeculation now for the first time attracted the serious attention of the\r\ngoverning class. The new thinkers themselves belonged to all ranks, though\r\nvery few of them were to be found among the aristocracy. They all preached,\r\nwith more or less ardour, and with a more or less crude application of\r\nlogic to political conditions, the doctrine that every man had an equal\r\nmoral right with every other to control his own life. For practical\r\npurposes the speculation of these primitive Liberals did not extend beyond\r\nmale limits. But some, of whom Mary Wollstonecraft was the most\r\nconspicuous,[100] even made the same claim for every woman. When only one\r\nwoman in ten thousand had any substantial intellectual training, it was\r\nnatural enough that men should give little {101} thought to their political\r\nrights. Until women were sufficiently educated to ask for equality in the\r\nState, it was impossible that men should think seriously of granting it.\r\nBut the French Revolution, though its direct effect on the political\r\ncondition of women was insignificant, started, in their case as in that of\r\nmen, a train of events which has borne fruit in more modern times. The\r\nemancipation of women from the control of men, which is the most profound\r\nof all the social changes of the last fifty years, has been produced by\r\nprecisely the same changes in social ideas as those which have abolished\r\nthe political distinctions among sects and classes of men. It is only\r\nanother part of the process of the emancipation of the individual which is\r\ncalled Liberalism.\r\n\r\nThe most obvious feature of this early Liberal movement is its neglect of\r\neconomic questions, and its concentration upon the mere machinery of\r\ngovernment. The science of political economy was indeed only in its\r\ninfancy, and Adam Smith's _Wealth of Nations_, published in 1776, had\r\nlittle effect upon practical politicians of any school until the beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century. Political argument was therefore conducted in\r\nthese early stages very largely upon a theoretical basis, and Tories,\r\nWhigs, and Radicals contended as mightily about the abstractions of natural\r\nrights and sovereignty as the early Churches about the difference between\r\nHomoousion and Homoiousion. Almost the only practical grievances alleged\r\nagainst the old system were expensive wars and the maintenance of\r\nsinecures. The early Reformers, though the doctrine of _laissez faire_ was\r\nnot formulated until half a century later, in fact believed it. They were\r\nin economics what the Whigs were in politics. They hated the interference\r\nof the executive, and they would probably have looked upon attempts to\r\nalter economic conditions as meddling, which would restrict the liberty of\r\nthe citizen and increase the already dangerous influence of the Crown.\r\n\r\nThis indifference, or rather hostility, to economic reforms was shared by\r\nall parties alike. Practically everybody agreed that it was a bad thing for\r\nGovernment to interfere with trade, though few went so far as to condemn\r\nthe system of Protection. {102} Arthur Young disliked Government\r\ninterference as an economist. \"All restrictive forcible measures in\r\ndomestic policy are bad.\"[101] Burke declared that his opinion was against\r\n\"an overdoing of any sort of administration, and more especially against\r\nthis most momentous of all meddling on the part of authority, the meddling\r\nwith the subsistence of the people.\"[102] Adam Smith, in his _Wealth of\r\nNations_ said that \"According to the system of natural liberty, the\r\nsovereign has only three duties to attend to ... I. The duty of protecting\r\nthe society from the violence and invasion of other independent societies;\r\nII. The duty of protecting, as far as possible, every member of the society\r\nfrom the injustice or oppression of every other member of it, or the duty\r\nof establishing an exact administration of justice; and III. The duty of\r\nerecting and maintaining certain public works and certain public\r\ninstitutions, which it can never be for the interest of any individual, or\r\nsmall number of individuals, to erect and maintain, because the profit\r\ncould never repay the expense to any individual or small number of\r\nindividuals, though it may frequently do much more than repay it to a great\r\nsociety.\"[103] This was the general opinion of the manufacturers, and in\r\n1806 it was embodied in a Parliamentary Report on industrial conditions:\r\n\"The right of every man to employ the capital he inherits or has acquired\r\naccording to his own discretion without molestation or obstruction, so long\r\nas he does not infringe on the rights or property of others, is one of\r\nthose privileges which the free and happy constitution of this country has\r\nlong accustomed every Briton to consider as his birthright.\"[104] The\r\naristocracy and the commercial classes alike distrusted an interference\r\nwhich restricted their personal freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Radicals, who professed to be, and were much more alive to the\r\ndistresses of the labourers and artisans, were hardly less emphatic. \"All\r\ngovernment,\" said Dr. Price, \"even within a State, becomes tyrannical as\r\nfar as it is a needless and wanton exercise of power, or is carried farther\r\nthan is absolutely necessary to preserve the peace or to secure the safety\r\nof the State. This {103} is what an excellent writer calls 'governing too\r\nmuch.'\"[105] \"Government,\" said Godwin, \"can have no more than two\r\nlegitimate purposes, the suppression of injustice against individuals\r\nwithin the community and defence against external invasion.\"[106] Most of\r\nthe Radicals were in fact of the middle class, and few of them saw things\r\nfrom the workman's point of view. However far they went, they were careful\r\nto maintain the rights of property. \"The phrase 'domineering rich' is\r\nexceptionable,\" said Major Cartwright, \"as it may, by cavillers, be\r\nconstrued into an attempt to excite the poor to invade the property of the\r\nrich. It is not by an invasion of such property that the condition of the\r\npoor is to be amended, but by such equal laws as would have a natural\r\ntendency to prevent injustice, and to benefit every class of the\r\ncommunity.\"[107] A free Parliament would allow every man an equal chance of\r\nobtaining wealth. Neither Cartwright nor any of his associates seems to\r\nhave considered that, while wealth was accumulated in the hands of a small\r\nclass, equality, even of opportunity, was impossible without some measure\r\nof State interference. What was needed by the working class was the removal\r\nof taxes upon food and raw materials, a helpful instead of a degrading Poor\r\nLaw, the right to combine against their employers, and factory legislation.\r\nBut the speculators were more concerned to reduce the interference of\r\naristocratic government with the liberty of the middle class than to\r\nincrease the interference of any sort of government with the working class,\r\nand they failed to see that the workmen's grievances were not the same as\r\ntheir own. A man who was wellnigh pressed to death with heavy weights was\r\nto be relieved by an improvement in the ventilation of the torture-chamber.\r\n\r\nThe Radicals[108] thus, in common with the Tories and the Whigs, ignored\r\neconomic problems, or assumed that they were {104} incapable of solving\r\nthem by political action. But their opinions, so far as they went, were\r\nLiberal opinions. They made the individual the unit of political society,\r\nand denounced all artificial barriers between ranks and classes. In his\r\nyounger days Cartwright held principles which led directly to\r\nRepublicanism. In his pamphlet _Take Your Choice_, which was published in\r\n1776, at the height of the American dispute, he said: \"How much soever any\r\nindividual may be qualified for, or deserve any elevation, he hath no right\r\nto it till it be conferred upon him by his fellows.... It is liberty, and\r\nnot dominion, which is held by divine right.\"[109] The suffrage must be\r\nextended to all adult men. \"Personality is the sole foundation of the right\r\nof being represented; ... property has, in reality, nothing to do in the\r\ncase.... It is a very fit object of the attention of his representative in\r\nParliament, but it contributes nothing to his right of having that\r\nrepresentation.\"[110] \"We might as well make the possession of forty\r\nshillings per annum the proof of a man's being rational, as of his being\r\nfree.\"[111]\r\n\r\nBut Cartwright, though a perfect specimen of the logical politician, and\r\nreasoning on principles as purely Republican as those of Paine himself, was\r\na member of the middle class, and enjoyed, during a great part of his life,\r\na substantial income. He openly opposed the followers of Paine, and at a\r\nmeeting of the Society of the Friends of the People, which he helped to\r\nfound in 1792, he carried a resolution in favour of King, Lords, and\r\nCommons.[112] This Society contained not only Radicals like Cartwright, but\r\nWhig Reformers like Grey and the Duke of Bedford. Eventually, the logicians\r\nwere squeezed out, and the Society became a Whig organization, the least\r\nvigorous of all those which worked for reform outside of Parliament. The\r\nbest of its members were practical politicians, who concentrated on active\r\nand notorious abuses like rotten boroughs and the disfranchisement of large\r\ntowns.[113] Grey worked in {105} Parliament very steadily, and other\r\nrepresentatives of the Society spoke manfully on occasion in both Houses.\r\nBut as a whole it seems to have done little to arouse the feeling of the\r\ncountry, and it was as vigorous in its condemnation of its more active\r\nassociates as in its attack upon the common enemy. Its principles were\r\nessentially Whig, and not Liberal. \"We profess,\" wrote Lord John Russell,\r\nthe chairman of the London Society in 1794, \"not to entertain a wish 'that\r\nthe great plan of public benefit which Mr. Paine has so powerfully\r\nrecommended will speedily be carried into effect,' nor to amuse our\r\nfellow-citizens with the magnificent promise of obtaining for them 'the\r\nrights of the people in their full extent'--the indefinite language of\r\ndelusion.\"[114] So even Fox, though he said that \"government originated not\r\nonly for, but from the people,\" and \"the people were the legitimate\r\nsovereign in every community,\" yet declared himself \"a steady and decided\r\nenemy to general and universal representation.\"[115] Sir Francis Burdett\r\nand one or two other Members of Parliament took the purely Radical view.\r\nBut so late as 1818, when, after nearly twenty years of heated agitation,\r\nBurdett moved resolutions in favour of manhood suffrage, annual\r\nParliaments, and equal electoral districts, Brougham said on behalf of the\r\nofficial Whig Opposition: \"As for universal suffrage, or the doctrine which\r\nsevered the elective franchise altogether from property, he begged leave to\r\nobserve that he never had at any time held it as less than the utter\r\ndestruction of the Constitution.\"[116] The Whig Reformers were thus\r\ndistinguished from the Radicals, and as they spoke contemptuously of the\r\nextremists, so they were in their turn attacked as lukewarm and\r\ntime-serving. Even Fox himself did not escape censure, though he was always\r\ncareful to abstain from recrimination.[117] The real value of the Whigs was\r\nthat they opposed themselves steadily to all attempts to suspend the\r\nordinary law, to stifle public discussion, and to {106} govern the country\r\nby the arbitrary power of the executive. In this cause Bedford and Grey and\r\nFox were heartily at one, and the various Bills for suspending the Habeas\r\nCorpus Act, suppressing or restricting public meetings, and dissolving\r\npolitical associations were always opposed by a compact body of members of\r\nboth Houses.[118] The few Whigs, who kept their heads in the face of\r\nRevolutionary France, aimed at the old Whig objects, the supremacy of\r\nParliament over the executive, and the maintenance of the rule of ordinary\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nWhen the Society of the Friends of the People had fallen into the hands of\r\nthe Whigs, Cartwright and Radicals like the Duke of Richmond, Dr. Price,\r\nand Horne Tooke found a new outlet for their logical energies in the\r\nSociety for Constitutional Information, which had been founded in 1780. The\r\nmembers of this Society were infinitely less experienced in practical\r\naffairs than men like Grey, and some of their publications show a most\r\npedantic and ludicrous precision of reasoning from abstract principles.\r\nLike all abstract politicians, they despised those who were content to\r\nadvance in opinion by easy stages. \"How,\" asked Cartwright, \"shall we speak\r\nof the imbecile efforts of our professors of moderate reform--so much in\r\nthe nature of moderate honesty!--politicians whose abortive conceptions and\r\nSisyphean labours never can command the respect of Parliament, Prince, or\r\nPeople? Can nothing cure these step-by-step Reformists of their\r\ninsanity?\"[119] Their own doctrine was compressed on one occasion into the\r\nfollowing remarkable resolutions:\r\n\r\n\"1. Representation--'the happiest discovery of human wisdom'--is the vital\r\nprinciple of the English Constitution, inasmuch as it is that alone which,\r\nin a State too extensive for personal legislation, constitutes Political\r\nLiberty.\r\n\r\n\"2. Political Liberty being a common right, Representation co-extensive\r\nwith direct Taxation ought, with all practicable equality, to be fairly and\r\nhonestly distributed throughout the community; the facility of which cannot\r\nbe denied.\r\n\r\n{107}\r\n\r\n\"3. The constitutional duration of a Parliament cannot exceed one year.\"\r\n\r\nThe question of the ballot was on this occasion left open, and a prize,\r\nconsisting of the thanks of the Society, was offered for the best essay on\r\nits advantages. The justification of the third proposition is a comical\r\ninstance of the way in which these theorizing politicians were carried away\r\nfrom practical affairs.\r\n\r\n\"The truth of the third proposition in the Constitution or this Union is\r\nmade evident by the following, among other considerations:\r\n\r\n\"1. An Englishman, at twenty-one years of age, enters on his inheritance,\r\nwhatever it may be. 2. A greater inheritance descends to every one of us\r\nfrom Right and the Laws than from our Parents; on which maxim Sir Edward\r\nCoke (in his second Institute) remarks, 'Right is the best birthright the\r\nsubject hath; for thereby his goods, land, wife, children, his body, life,\r\nhonour, and estimation are protected from wrong.' 3. To no other 'Right'\r\nthan that of a People either personally or representatively making their\r\nown Laws, whereby they may be 'protected from Wrong,' can this remark of\r\nSir Edward Coke possibly apply. 4. When Election is withholden for seven\r\nyears, then all who came of age since the preceding election are kept out\r\nof their Inheritance and best Birthright. 5. Even supposing the\r\nRepresentation of our Country were in other respects quite perfect, yet\r\nseptennial Parliaments would still deprive the whole Nation of its\r\npolitical Liberty for six parts in seven of human life; and triennial\r\nParliaments must have a like effect for two years in every three; whence it\r\nfollows, that Parliaments of any duration exceeding One Year instead of a\r\nprotection from, would be an infliction of 'wrong'; contrary to the\r\nConstitution, against Right, and destruction of Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThis pedantry would destroy itself: by the application of the same\r\nprinciples it could be proved that a General Election was necessary once a\r\nmonth, or once a week, or once a day. But the real objection is that which\r\nthese _a priori_ Reformers constantly overlooked, the fact that a\r\nConstitution is after all only {108} a machine contrived for certain\r\npractical ends of government, that it must be arranged upon a basis of\r\nconvenience, and that infinitely greater hardship could be inflicted upon\r\nthe country by interrupting trade for one month in every twelve and\r\nspending a million pounds in unproductive ways, than by forcing a small\r\nportion of the population to abstain from voting even until it was as much\r\nas twenty-eight years old.\r\n\r\nThese doctrines being based upon pure logic, and not upon practical\r\nconvenience, were naturally made applicable to all peoples without\r\ndistinction. \"All being pure and genuine,\" said Cartwright, \"the result\r\nwill be, a strict unity of form universally applicable; and exhibiting its\r\nsubject, political liberty, as evidently a common right and inheritance of\r\nevery people or nation; for to talk of English liberty, and French or\r\nSpanish or Italian liberty, as different in nature is contrary to\r\nreason.\"[120] It is easy to understand why men like Fox and Grey,\r\naccustomed to grapple with the affairs of men who were swayed by prejudice,\r\ntradition, interest, by everything but reason, were contemptuous of\r\npolitical theories of this sort. No one who has been engaged in active\r\npolitics can fail to understand that men are infinitely variable, and that\r\nwhat suits one race will not suit another. There was really only one\r\nproblem to consider. Given a society with a known history, composed of\r\nhuman beings of a known character, and distributed among known conditions,\r\nwhat form of government was best suited to their case? Origin, character,\r\nsocial and economic distribution, and past history, are all different in\r\ndifferent peoples, and political institutions will inevitably differ also.\r\nThe Radicals were far enough away from real life. But with all their\r\nincapacity for politics, they performed the great service of preaching the\r\npolitical importance of individuality.\r\n\r\nMore influential than they were Tom Paine and his followers. These had\r\nfewer men of experience in their ranks, they had less respect for existing\r\ninstitutions, and they were as bitterly contemptuous of pioneers like\r\nCartwright as the pioneers in their turn were contemptuous of the Whigs in\r\nParliament. {109} Cartwright clung to King, Lords, and Commons, the\r\nEstablished Church, and administration by men of property and rank. Paine\r\nwas a Republican, a theist, and a social reformer. The one had influence\r\namong the aristocracy, the gentry, the manufacturers, and the\r\nforty-shilling freeholders. The other was popular with the artisans and\r\ntradesmen. But in general habit of mind the two men were very similar. The\r\ndifferences were differences of class. Both belonged to the same species.\r\nThey were equally destitute of the historic sense, and equally incapable of\r\nunderstanding that institutions must grow and change with society, and\r\ncannot be praised or condemned according as, at any particular moment, they\r\ndo or do not correspond with the needs of the people who work them. Both\r\npushed theory to logical conclusions, irrespective of the course of events\r\nin the past or the practical difficulties of the present. Of the two, Paine\r\nhad more political capacity. He had more genuine understanding of the\r\ncharacter of his audience, and his influence was infinitely more widespread\r\nthan that of any of the older men. Burke's _French Revolution_ drew a\r\nvolley of books and pamphlets from his opponents. The _Vindiciae Gallicae_\r\nof Sir James Mackintosh was the best of these. But Mackintosh, no less that\r\nDr. Price, Mrs. Macaulay, and Mary Wollstonecraft, was outwritten and\r\noutsold by Paine. Of the _French Revolution_ 19,000 copies were sold in\r\ntwelve months. In the same period Paine sold more than 40,000 copies of the\r\nFirst Part of the _Rights of Man_.[121]\r\n\r\nThis famous book is marked by many of the vices of extreme opinions. Its\r\nreading of events in France, in some of which Paine had taken part, was far\r\nmore accurate than that of Burke's treatise. Paine avoided the mistake of\r\ntaking the Revolution to be a mere outbreak of capricious violence, and\r\ngave due weight to the intellectual revolution which had preceded it, and\r\nto the economic distress which aggravated it. But though he knew France\r\nbetter than Burke, he had not Burke's grasp of the idea of growth, of the\r\nnecessity of development rather than of reconstruction in politics, and he\r\ncould not understand that an institution, which {110} was now useless or\r\ndetrimental, might, in an older system, have been necessary to the\r\nexistence of society. Such phrases as Burke's \"chain and continuity of the\r\ncommonwealth\" had no meaning for him. Everything was to be cut off and\r\nbegun afresh. \"Every age and generation must be as free to act for itself\r\nin all cases as the ages and generations which preceded it.\"[122] \"When we\r\nsurvey the wretched condition of man, and the monarchical and hereditary\r\nsystems of government, dragged from his home by one power, or driven by\r\nanother, and impoverished by taxes more than by enemies, it becomes evident\r\nthat those systems are bad, and that a general revolution in the principle\r\nand construction of governments is necessary.\"[123] Paine is here not\r\nunlike the surgeon in Mr. Shaw's play, for ever eager to plunge his knife\r\ninto the vitals of the patient, without knowing either the history of the\r\ndisease or the chances of its cure. How much wiser is Burke's \"I cannot\r\nconceive how any man can have brought himself to that pitch of presumption,\r\nto consider his country as nothing but carte blanche, upon which he may\r\nscribble whatever he pleases. A man full of warm, speculative benevolence\r\nmay wish his society otherwise constituted than he finds it, but a good\r\npatriot and a true politician always considers how he shall make the most\r\nof the existing materials of his country. A disposition to preserve, and an\r\nability to improve, taken together, would be my standard of a statesman.\"\r\nPaine's prophecies were as extravagant as his reading of history was\r\ninaccurate. \"I do not believe,\" he said, \"that monarchy and aristocracy\r\nwill continue seven years longer in any of the enlightened countries in\r\nEurope.\"[124] After one hundred and twenty years Portugal alone has\r\nattempted to follow the example of France, and it was eighty years before\r\neven France expelled its last despot.\r\n\r\nThe truth lay midway between the two extremes. Burke was right in theory\r\nand wrong in facts. Paine was right in facts and wrong in theory. Paine was\r\ndeceived by the events of his own time. He had personally assisted at the\r\nmaking of two new {111} constitutions, and he exaggerated the ease with\r\nwhich others might be made like them. This violent plucking out of ancient\r\nloyalties seemed normal, when in fact it was altogether abnormal. In\r\nAmerica, separated from the old world and its old habits, the process had\r\nbeen comparatively easy. In France, as subsequent events proved, it was of\r\nenormous difficulty. Men who habitually build their houses on the sites of\r\nabated earthquakes are not in a day to be twisted out of their habit of\r\nsubmitting to illogical things like kings and nobles and Churches. Nor is\r\nit often servility or credulity which produces that submission. In the vast\r\nmajority of cases it is only that they accept that to which they have been\r\naccustomed, and require some outrageous provocation to make them change.\r\nThis was incredible to Paine. What was unreasonable was fraudulent, and\r\nwhat was fraudulent to-day had always been fraudulent. \"It is impossible\r\nthat such Governments as have hitherto existed in the world would have\r\ncommenced by any other means than a total violation of every principle,\r\nsacred and moral. The obscurity in which the origin of all the present\r\nGovernments is buried implies the iniquity and disgrace with which they\r\nbegan.\"[125] The obscurity seems a little less dense to us, and the King\r\nand the Church appear as necessary in their proper order to the\r\nconsolidation of society and its advance out of barbarism. To Paine the\r\nearly king was only the head of a band of robbers, and the early Church was\r\ncontrived only to maintain him in power by investing him with superstitious\r\nterrors. He assailed monarchy and aristocracy with a variety of scornful\r\nepithets: \"Nobility means No-ability.\" \"Titles are but nicknames.\" \"France\r\nhas outgrown the baby-cloaths of Count and Duke, and has breeched itself in\r\nmanhood.\" \"The difference between a republican and a courtier with a\r\nrespect to monarchy is that the one opposes monarchy, believing it to be\r\nsomething, and the other laughs at it, knowing it to be nothing.\" \"As to\r\nwho is king in England or elsewhere, or whether there is any king at all,\r\nor whether the people choose a Cherokee chief, or a Hessian hussar, for a\r\nking, it is not a matter {112} that I trouble myself about.\" \"The House of\r\nBrunswick, one of the petty tribes of Germany.\" \"The splendour of a throne\r\n... is made up of a band of parasites living in luxurious indolence out of\r\nthe public taxes.\" \"Monarchy is the master-fraud, which shelters all\r\nothers.\" A torrent of these gibes and sneers at things which to the\r\nordinary man and woman of comfortable surroundings were hardly less than\r\nsacred, roused against Paine all that horror and aversion which in our own\r\nday has been inspired by Mr. Lloyd George.\r\n\r\nBut the most disturbing part of Paine's book was not its epithets, but its\r\ndoctrine. Before him Radicals had argued more or less directly from the\r\nassumption of natural rights that every man is invested at his birth with\r\nrights against his neighbours, and that political constitutions must be\r\nbased upon these rights. The theory of natural rights came from Rousseau,\r\nand the French Revolution claimed to be a practical consequence of it.\r\nPaine brought it over from France in its crude simplicity, and preached it\r\nmore forcibly and more effectively than it had ever been preached before.\r\nIt was based on a false historical assumption. Every account of the\r\ncreation agreed that men are all born equal, of the same degree, and\r\nendowed with equal natural rights. These, natural rights were the\r\nfoundation of all his civil rights. \"Natural rights are those which\r\nappertain to man in right of his existence. Of this kind are all the\r\nintellectual rights, or rights of the mind, and also all those rights of\r\nacting as an individual for his own comfort and happiness, which are not\r\ninjurious to the natural rights of others. Civil rights are those which\r\nappertain to man in right of his being a member of society. Every civil\r\nright has for its foundation some natural right fore-existing in the\r\nindividual, but to the enjoyment of which his individual power is not, in\r\nall cases, sufficiently competent. Of this kind are all those which relate\r\nto security and protection.\" The basis of liberty is contained in the first\r\nthree articles of the Declaration of Rights of the French National\r\nAssembly, the whole of which Paine quotes in full and declares to be \"of\r\nmore value to the world than all the laws and statutes that have yet {113}\r\nbeen promulgated.\" The first of these articles, if true, destroys every one\r\nof the distinctions of class and creed which were dear to\r\neighteenth-century England. \"Men are born, and always continue, free and\r\nequal in respect of their rights. Civil distinctions, therefore, can be\r\nfounded only on public utility.\" It followed from this premise that no one\r\nclass had any right to impose laws upon the rest of the community without\r\ntheir consent. The nation must be the source of sovereignty, and no\r\nindividual or body of men could be entitled to any authority which was not\r\nexpressly derived from it. Monarchy, aristocracy, the Established Church,\r\nthe territorial system, and primogeniture, everything which gave artificial\r\nadvantages to one man over his neighbour, must be swept away. Given the\r\nfirst assumption that all men are born equal, the rest follows as a matter\r\nof course.\r\n\r\nIt is as easy to refute the doctrine as to state it. It is not historically\r\ntrue that men are or ever have been born equal. It is not logically true\r\nthat a man is born with any rights or can ever acquire any except with the\r\nconsent of his associates. The historical basis must appear absurd to any\r\none who is acquainted with the theory of evolution and the early history of\r\nfamily and tribal organization. The logical basis must appear equally\r\nabsurd to any one who is acquainted with the nature of a right. It is\r\nimpossible to conceive of such a thing as an abstract right apart from\r\ndefinite human relationships. A right cannot exist in the air. It cannot\r\neven attach to an isolated individual. A right is always a right against\r\nsome other, and postulates the association of its possessor with at least\r\none other human being. How can we with any propriety speak of the rights of\r\nRobinson Crusoe before the arrival of Friday? The powers of Crusoe were at\r\nfirst limited solely by physical considerations. When he took Friday under\r\nhis protection he acquired certain rights as against Friday, and at the\r\nsame time Friday acquired certain rights as against him. But this is only\r\nto say that the natural power of each to do as he pleased, hitherto limited\r\nonly by natural forces, was thereafter limited also by certain rules of\r\nconduct, recognized by both for observance so long as their {114} mutual\r\nrelations continued. The extent of those limits could only be defined by\r\ntheir agreement. These are all the rights which any man can ever possess,\r\neven in the most complex society. A right is nothing more or less than a\r\ndefined natural power. It may vary in the degree of its definition. It may\r\nbe enforced by all the authority of the whole community, and be called a\r\nlegal right. It may be enforced only by the pressure of the opinion of the\r\ncommunity or of a class, and be called a moral right. In neither case is it\r\na thing of spontaneous generation. It arises always out of the relations of\r\nhuman beings with each other, and may always be tempered and qualified by\r\nthe nature of their relations.\r\n\r\nPaine's mistake lay simply in using the word \"natural\" instead of the word\r\n\"moral.\" To assert that a man has a natural right to control his own\r\ngovernment is to assert what is demonstrably false. To assert that a man\r\nhas a moral right to control his own government is to assert simply that in\r\nthe writer's opinion a man ought to be allowed to control his own\r\ngovernment, and the dispute is simply about a particular problem of ethics.\r\nSubstitute the one word for the other in the passage above quoted, and what\r\nis now a false statement of fact becomes a reasonable, if not an\r\nunanswerable, argument. The quarrel between Paine and Burke, so far as it\r\nwas a practical quarrel and not merely a quarrel about terms, was a quarrel\r\nabout the precise manner in which certain common ethical principles should\r\nbe enforced. Government is merely the organization of human beings for\r\ncertain common purposes, and the structure is to be adapted solely to the\r\nexecution of those purposes. If a particular scheme means the abuse of one\r\nsection of the community by another, one of the ends of government, the\r\nprotection of all the human beings concerned, is not achieved, and the\r\nscheme, if possible, should be altered. Once we come to the conclusion,\r\nupon ethical principles, that every human being ought to have an equal\r\nchance with every other of developing himself, it follows, not as a logical\r\ndeduction, but simply as a matter of practical convenience, that one class\r\nought not to be entrusted with the control of {115} others. A constitution\r\nin itself has no merit. Its only value is as a piece of working machinery,\r\nand it is to be tested not by the degree of its conformity to abstract\r\nprinciples, but by its practical effects.\r\n\r\nBurke himself, in fact, destroyed his whole argument against \"natural\r\nrights,\" not as a proposition of logic, but as a basis of political action.\r\nHe admitted that men had certain \"real\" rights: \"to justice,\" \"to the\r\nfruits of their industry and to the means of making their industry\r\nfruitful,\" \"to the acquisitions of their parents, to the nourishment and\r\nimprovement of their offspring, to instruction in life, and to consolation\r\nin death.\" But what is the difference between these \"real\" rights of Burke\r\nand the \"natural\" rights of Paine? How are these rights created and\r\nmaintained, but by public opinion and current ideas of morality? And if\r\nthese, why not others? \"It is a thing,\" said Burke, \"to be settled by\r\nconvention.\" Tom Paine meant nothing else. But when Burke said, \"As to the\r\nshare of power, authority, and direction which each individual ought to\r\nhave in the management of the State, that I must deny to be amongst the\r\ndirect, original rights of man in civil society,\" Paine might have asked in\r\nwhat respect rights to justice and to the fruits of industry differed from\r\nrights to control government. If the rules of justice are defined by\r\nGovernment so that it becomes difficult, tedious, and expensive, how is the\r\npoor man to exercise his right to justice? If Government taxes the raw\r\nmaterial of his industry, is not his right to the fruits of it being\r\nimpaired? In his _Present Discontents_ Burke had described clearly enough\r\nthe consequences of absolute power, the corruption of the governor and the\r\noppression of the governed. If government remains in the hands of a class,\r\nit will inevitably be conducted in the interests of that class, and the\r\nrules of justice and the regulation of industry will be contrived according\r\nto its interests and not according to those of the general community. In\r\nother words, the rights of the rest of society, however real, direct, and\r\noriginal, are always liable to be diminished or destroyed by the caprice of\r\ntheir governors. {116} Burke's admissions lead as inevitably to universal\r\nsuffrage as the false assumptions of Paine.\r\n\r\nIt must not be assumed that Paine was a mere theorizer. So far as the\r\ninterests of the mass of the people were concerned, he was the most\r\npractical of reformers. Tories and reactionary Whigs appealed to \"the\r\nglorious Revolution of 1688.\"[126] Cartwright and the Radicals deduced\r\nliberty from abstract hypotheses without considering to what practical uses\r\nliberty was to be put. Paine came boldly forward with definite proposals\r\nfor social reforms, and it was this practical application of his principles\r\nwhich made him to be detested where Cartwright was only despised. It was\r\nbad enough to assail aristocracy. Words could hardly express the feelings\r\nwith which comfortable people listened to his attacks upon property. These\r\nwould seem moderate to a generation which has grown accustomed to\r\nSocialism, as a creed if not as an institution, and his proposals were\r\nlittle more drastic than those of the present Liberal Government. He\r\nadvocated graduated death duties, old-age pensions, maternity grants, the\r\nright to work, and international agreement for the limitation of\r\narmaments.[127] It is true that the language of his proposals was anything\r\nbut reckless. He was far from being an advocate of violent methods. \"It is\r\nalways better to obey a bad law, making use at the same time of every\r\nargument to show its errors and procure its repeal, than forcibly to\r\nviolate it; because the precedent of breaking a bad law might weaken the\r\nforce, and lead to a discretionary violation of those which are good.\"[128]\r\n\"The right of property being secured and inviolable, no one ought to be\r\ndeprived of it, except in cases of evident public necessity, legally\r\nascertained, and on condition of a previous just indemnity.\"[129] This is\r\nthe language of temperance. But the owners of property have little capacity\r\nfor reflection when their interests are attacked. They are seldom concerned\r\nto examine the justice {117} of any infringement of their privileges, and\r\nthey find it difficult to distinguish between taxation and spoliation,\r\nbetween appeals to natural justice and the negation of law. Paine's\r\nadversaries did not believe in natural rights. But they believed in what\r\nwere far worse. They believed in natural wrongs. It was monstrous to\r\nsuggest that all men were entitled to equal opportunities. But it was quite\r\nreasonable that the vast majority should be kept in a situation where they\r\ncould not be confident even of a bare subsistence. The good cause, if not\r\nthe logical reasoning, was Paine's. The right to property is, like all his\r\n\"natural\" rights, or the \"real\" rights of Burke, a moral right, and its\r\nextent is to be determined upon the same principles as every other. Violent\r\ndisturbances of it are bad, as violent disturbances of every right are bad,\r\nnot because they are disturbances, but because they are violent. There is\r\nnothing more essentially vicious in a criticism of property in land or\r\nmachinery than in a criticism of property in a negro. As Burke said, \"It is\r\na thing to be settled by convention.\"\r\n\r\nPaine's suggestions for social reform were of little immediate importance,\r\nand it was a hundred years before the first of them, a graduated death\r\nduty, was passed into law. His value in his own day lay, not in his\r\npractical proposals, but in his insistence upon the equal value of\r\nindividuals in the State. What the Whigs had practised partially and\r\nobscurely Paine preached universally and with precision. His _Rights of\r\nMan_ was the principal textbook of the new school of politicians, who, by\r\nbasing their politics upon individuality instead of class, eventually\r\ntransformed the English theory of government. The Reformers found\r\ngovernment the profession of a few families of landed proprietors, at the\r\nbest prevented from active abuse by an imperfect system of representation\r\nof classes. They made it a thing of trust and responsibility, for which\r\nevery man must prove his competence by his readiness to act directly for\r\nthe benefit of those whom he governed. They found it an incident in the\r\nlives of men of leisure. They made it an expression of the life of men of\r\nall ranks alike. Omitting the false historical {118} assumption, there is\r\nnothing substantially untrue in Paine's contrast of the old spirit with the\r\nnew. \"Government on the old system was an assumption of power, for the\r\naggrandizement of itself; on the new, a delegation of power for the common\r\nbenefit of society.\"[130]\r\n\r\nThese new principles did not appear on the surface of politics until forty\r\nyears later, and not a single institution was in the interval altered in\r\nthe direction of Liberalism. The Whig Opposition broke into pieces, and the\r\nmajority joined the Tories.[131] The Church of England found itself for\r\nonce allied with the Wesleyans, whose Christianity was as much repelled by\r\nPaine's _Age of Reason_ as its own aristocratic temper was repelled by his\r\n_Rights of Man_. The governing class was driven into a paroxysm of fear and\r\nrage by Paine's triple assault on aristocracy, property, and orthodox\r\nreligion, and every Conservative instinct was roused in its defence. Every\r\nReformer, moderate and extreme, was involved together in one denunciation.\r\nTheir opinions admittedly came from France, and every atrocity which had\r\ntaken place in France was due to those opinions. Voltaire was an atheist.\r\nRousseau was a profligate. The French aristocracy had been massacred. The\r\nFrench Church had been stripped of its possessions. The French landed\r\nproprietors had been spoiled. All this had been done in the name of the\r\nrights of man. The English Reformers believed in the rights of man. These\r\nhad been proved by events in France to be incompatible with law, order,\r\nreligion, and morality. All who valued these must unite in their defence\r\nagainst the deadly opinions. Belief in the rights of man marked an\r\nEnglishman like a contagious disease. Atheists, Theists, and Christians,\r\nTrinitarians and Unitarians, Churchmen and Dissenters, Reformers, Radicals,\r\nand Republicans, landowners, manufacturers, and artisans, people who\r\nbelieved in vested interests and people who did not, all were Jacobins, and\r\nall were swept away in one turbid flood of unreasoning invective.\r\n\r\n{119}\r\n\r\nEvery proposal for change was opposed by the same arguments. Every\r\ninstitution, good, bad, or indifferent, became a foothold for shuddering\r\nConservatism. Alteration became synonymous with evil; there was no good\r\nsave in establishment. Even the Slave Trade was strengthened against pious\r\nTory gentlemen like Wilberforce by the same arguments which defended the\r\nrepresentative system against the profane Republican artisans of\r\nLancashire. Thus Lord Abingdon claimed to have \"incontrovertibly proved\r\nthat the proposition for the abolition of the Slave Trade is a French\r\nproposition, that it is grounded in and founded upon French principles,\r\nthat it means neither more nor less than liberty and equality, that it has\r\nTom Paine's _Rights of Man_ for its chief and best support ... that it has\r\nhad in the colonies of France all the direful effects necessarily flowing\r\nfrom such principles, namely, those of insubordination, anarchy, confusion,\r\nmurder, havock, devastation, and ruin.\"[132] Nearly thirty years after the\r\npublication of Paine's book, Lord Wellesley, denouncing universal suffrage,\r\nannual elections, and voting by ballot, said that, if carried into\r\nexecution, they \"would be the destruction of all regular government, the\r\ndestruction of all religion, and the destruction of all private\r\nproperty.\"[133] But the most ludicrous expression of this fear of change\r\noccurs in one of Windham's speeches against the Bill to suppress\r\nbull-baiting. The House of Commons solemnly listened to a solemn assurance\r\nthat the Bill was promoted by Methodists and Jacobins, and that it was\r\ndirected to the destruction of the old English character by the abolition\r\nof all rural sports. \"Out of the whole number of the disaffected, he\r\nquestioned if a single bull-baiter could be found, or if a single sportsman\r\nhad distinguished himself in the Corresponding Society ... the antiquity of\r\nthe thing was deserving of respect, for antiquity was the best preservation\r\nof the Church and State.\"[134]\r\n\r\nThe controversy was not allowed to remain a mere matter {120} of words.\r\nBoth sides set themselves to organize machinery for the dissemination of\r\ntheir opinions. The Radicals used the Society for Constitutional\r\nInformation. The extremists established the Corresponding Society, whose\r\nbranches, composed chiefly of the middle and working classes, corresponded\r\nwith similar societies in France, held meetings and published their\r\nresolutions in the newspapers, and industriously circulated copies of the\r\n_Rights of Man_. So vigorous were their operations that a Royal\r\nProclamation was issued in May, 1792, denouncing these \"wicked and\r\nseditious writings\" and correspondence with \"persons in foreign parts,\" and\r\nexhorting all subjects of the Crown to discourage them.[135] In November\r\nthe Tories formed an Association for Preserving Liberty and Property\r\nagainst Republicans and Levellers, which declared that \"It appears from\r\nhistory and observation, that the inequality of rank and fortune in this\r\nhappy country is more the result of every man's own exertions than of any\r\ncontrolling institution of the State. Men become great who have greatly\r\ndistinguished themselves by the application of talents natural or acquired;\r\nand men become rich who have persevered with industry in the application to\r\ntrade and commerce, to manufactures, and other useful employments.\"[136]\r\nSuch language was hardy enough in a society where public dignities were\r\nmonopolized by a few families, whose inherited wealth was augmented as\r\noften by jobbery as by industry. The Association seems to have acted as a\r\nprivate detective agency and sent reports and secret information to the\r\nGovernment. But the honours of agitation rested, as usual, with the\r\nreforming party. If their success was small, it was due less to the private\r\nefforts of their opponents than to the superior resources of the Government\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n{121}\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to discover how widely the new ideas had spread by the end\r\nof the century. The war with France, which lasted almost continuously from\r\n1793 to 1815, probably drew off much of the national enthusiasm. A foreign\r\nwar is always favourable to the enemies of domestic liberty, and however\r\nmuch their distresses may drive common men to hate their governors, they\r\ngenerally hate them less than the national enemy. Industrious as they were,\r\nthe agitators were too closely identified with France to be popular, and it\r\nwas not till the end of the war that the middle and working classes as a\r\nwhole began to lend them a favourable ear. In the meantime, they were\r\nregarded by the Government as infinitely more powerful than they really\r\nwere, and for thirty years they worked in constant danger of imprisonment\r\nor transportation. They had been depressed, in common with Whigs like Fox\r\nand Grey, by the ferocity of the French mobs. But the invasion of France by\r\nthe Duke of Brunswick and the complete victory of the new national\r\nGovernment, restored their confidence at the same time as it reawakened the\r\nterrors of the Tories. The most trifling expressions of sympathy with the\r\nFrench people or their principles exposed them to spies and informers and\r\nzealous loyalists.[137] On the 8th May James Ridgway and H. D. Symonds were\r\nsentenced to four years' imprisonment for publishing Paine's works. On the\r\n27th, for saying in a coffee-house, \"I am for equality; I see no reason why\r\none man should be greater than another; I would have no king, and the\r\nconstitution of this country is a bad one,\" Mr. Frost was struck oft the\r\nroll of attorneys and sentenced to an hour in the pillory and six months in\r\nNewgate. On the 1st October Mr. Pigott and Dr. Hudson were tried for\r\ndrinking \"The French Republic\" in a coffee-house. At Leicester a man called\r\nVaughan distributed a handbill criticizing the war because it inflicted\r\nhardship on the poor. He was sent to prison for three months. Benjamin\r\n{122} Bull distributed the _Rights of Man_ at Bath, and was imprisoned for\r\na year.[138] Paine himself was tried for seditious libel in 1792, and in\r\nhis absence was outlawed. But the most ferocious punishments were inflicted\r\nin Scotland. In England, short of high treason, there was no legal offence\r\npossible except sedition or seditious libel, for which the punishment was a\r\nterm of imprisonment. In Scotland the offenders might be transported. In\r\nSeptember, 1793, the Rev. Thomas Fysche Palmer, Unitarian minister at\r\nDundee, for publishing an address couched in very temperate language, from\r\nwhich it was proved that he had struck out some more extravagant\r\nexpressions, was sentenced to seven years' transportation. The Whigs in\r\nParliament protested against this monstrous sentence. But the House, by a\r\nlarge majority, refused even to compel the Home Secretary to detain the\r\nconvict ship pending its revision.[139] In the same year Thomas Muir, a\r\ngentleman of acknowledged respectability, was sentenced to fourteen years'\r\ntransportation for an offence of as trivial a kind as that of Mr.\r\nPalmer.[140] Other Reformers, chiefly members of Corresponding Societies,\r\nmet at Edinburgh in December, 1792, in what they rashly called a \"National\r\nConvention.\" This consisted of delegates from Societies all over the\r\nkingdom. It passed resolutions, appointed committees, and acted as a\r\npermanent body of political delegates is accustomed to act, in order to\r\nfurther the cause of Parliamentary Reform. There was nothing violent in the\r\nobjects, the proceedings, or the language of the Convention, which passed a\r\nresolution in favour of government by King, Lords, and Commons without a\r\nsingle dissentient voice.[141] But the French Revolution had begun by the\r\nmeeting of a \"Convention,\" and the delegates, in addition to selecting that\r\nunfortunate title, presented an address to the French National Convention,\r\nand habitually addressed each other, in imitation of the French, as\r\n\"citizens.\" This was {123} enough for the Government. A representative\r\nbody, with a French title, in communication with the French Government, and\r\nusing French forms of speech, must meditate that sort of revolution which\r\nhad been contrived by the French people. It fell upon the delegates with\r\nall the ferocity of despotism in a panic. William Skirving, Maurice\r\nMargarot, and Joseph Gerald were transported for fourteen years, and\r\nAlexander Callender was outlawed. English juries were less frantic than\r\nScottish. The members of the London Corresponding Society had done similar\r\nacts in England. But in 1794, when several of them, including Horne Tooke,\r\nwere tried for high treason, all were acquitted.\r\n\r\nThe precise details of all these proceedings, and the widespread suffering\r\nwhich they caused, are not important for this book. It is enough to state\r\nhere that there was much expression of discontent, and that the Government\r\ndealt with it in the worst possible way. The wise course was to detach the\r\nrespectable agitators from the agitators who were not respectable by\r\nsubstantial improvements in the franchise and the distribution of seats.\r\nBut the Government were incapable of drawing distinctions, and, by\r\nconfounding all sorts of discontent in their repression, alienated and\r\nembittered even those whom they had it in their power to conciliate.\r\nEvidence of any general conspiracy to alter the existing order by violent\r\nmeans there is none. Nothing was ever published on behalf of the Government\r\nitself which proved anything but constitutional and orderly expressions of\r\ndissatisfaction, with occasional outbreaks of reckless language and\r\nexceedingly rare instances of such acts as the purchase or manufacture of\r\nweapons.[142] There were no collections of arms, no riots, except such as\r\nwere purely industrial, and no demonstrations of force. Not a single life\r\nwas ever taken or attempted by the Reformers, and the only dangerous\r\npolitical disturbance of the {124} period was the outbreak of the Tory mob,\r\nwho looted and burnt the houses of Dissenters and Radicals at Birmingham.\r\nBut the governing class was afraid, and in its fear it struck out blindly\r\nat everything which it disliked.\r\n\r\nThe Habeas Corpus Act was suspended in 1791, and the executive received\r\npower to arrest and detain suspects without trial. At a later date,\r\nextraordinary powers were created. A meeting held near London in October,\r\n1795, was followed by an attempt to assassinate the King. The meeting was\r\norderly, and there was not a shadow of proof that there was any connection\r\nbetween the two events. But the Government took advantage of the prevailing\r\nindignation to create new crimes, and to increase the punishments for\r\nexisting crimes. The Treason Act made it an offence, punishable on a second\r\nconviction with seven years' transportation, to \"incite or stir up the\r\npeople to hatred or dislike of His Majesty's person or the established\r\nGovernment and constitution of the realm,\" and extended the definition of\r\nhigh treason. The Sedition Act prohibited the holding of meetings without\r\nthe presence of a magistrate, made it an offence punishable with death for\r\ntwelve persons to remain together after a magistrate had called upon them\r\nto disperse, and declared that any house, where a substantial number of\r\npersons beyond that of the resident family assembled for a common purpose,\r\nshould be treated as a disorderly house, unless specially licensed. In\r\n1799, after the mutiny in the fleet at the Nore and the great Irish\r\nRebellion, in both of which the Society of United Irishmen had been\r\ninvolved, new statutes made it a criminal offence, punishable by fine and\r\nimprisonment, to belong to the Corresponding Society, or the Societies of\r\nUnited Irishmen and United Englishmen, or to take oaths of secrecy. No\r\nprinter was to be allowed to conduct his business without obtaining a\r\ncertificate from a clerk of the peace. No attempt was made to discriminate\r\nbetween the Corresponding Societies, whose violence was confined to their\r\nlanguage, and the other two societies, which had undoubtedly been concerned\r\nin the mutiny and the Rebellion. Individual atrocities were ascribed to\r\nFrench principles. The Reform Societies preached French principles. {125}\r\nTherefore they were as guilty as the criminals themselves. In effect, all\r\norganized political agitation was suppressed.\r\n\r\nAll these measures were steadily opposed by the small body of Parliamentary\r\nWhigs who had not lost their belief in free government. Fox, Grey, and\r\nWhitbread in the Commons, and Bedford, Lansdowne,[143] Moira, and\r\nLauderdale in the Lords, denounced every restriction upon the right of free\r\ndiscussion, and at huge meetings at Copenhagen House and in Palace Yard\r\nthey protested against the Treason and Sedition Bills. They were not in\r\nsympathy with the extremists, who often attacked them as bitterly as the\r\nTories themselves. There is nothing so obnoxious to violent opinions as\r\nmoderation. It seems to add hypocrisy to wickedness. But to those who can\r\nsee historical events in proportion the good service of this handful of\r\nstatesmen is beyond question. They maintained the purely Liberal view that\r\ntoleration is not to be confined to opinions of which we ourselves approve.\r\n\"All political libels,\" said Fox, \"he would leave to themselves;\r\ndiscussions on government, so far as they did not interfere with private\r\ncharacter, he would permit to pass entirely unrestrained.\"[144] \"The best\r\nsecurity of a Government,\" said Tierney, \"is in the free complaints of a\r\npeople.\"[145] \"The safety of the State,\" said Grey, \"could only be found in\r\nthe protection of the liberties of the people.... There never was an\r\nextensive discontent without great misgovernment. The people ought to be\r\ntaught to look to Parliament with a confident expectation that their\r\ncomplaints would be heard, and protection afforded to them. When no\r\nattention was paid to the calls of the people for relief, when their\r\npetitions were rejected, and their sufferings aggravated, was it wonderful\r\nthat at last public discontents should assume a formidable aspect?\"[146]\r\nProtests sometimes became threats. Fox declared in 1795 that if the Treason\r\nand Sedition Bills were carried into law, the propriety of resistance to\r\ngovernment would no longer be a matter of morality but of prudence only,\r\nand in this he was supported by Sheridan and Grey.\r\n\r\n{126}\r\n\r\nThese Whigs at least contrived to see the popular point of view, and would\r\nhave suffered opinions which they would do nothing to promote. The Tories\r\nsaw no point of view but their own. They hated free discussion, because\r\nthey saw that it meant the end of the institutions which they cherished.\r\nDiscussion was to them only a stage on the way to rapine and murder. It\r\nmade, therefore, no difference whether discussion were honest and orderly\r\nor not. They were resolute to maintain existing establishments, and the\r\nmost constitutional of critics was as much a public enemy as the most\r\nferocious of rebels. They drew no distinction between agitation and\r\nrevolution. They inquired into discontents, but only into their extent and\r\nnot into their causes. They applied violent remedies, not to the real\r\ndisease, but to its symptoms. The patient was noisy, and they beat him for\r\nbeing noisy, when they ought to have cured the fever which produced his\r\ndelirium. The vice of their system lay not so much in their suppression of\r\ndisorder as in their neglect of reform. Order must be maintained by\r\ngovernment, even when the breach of it is the fault of government. But it\r\nmust be accompanied by redress of grievances. It is the business of a\r\nstatesman to manage his people, not to compel them, and however necessary\r\nit may sometimes be for him to enforce the law, it remains the weakest, and\r\nshould always be the last of his instruments. It is useless for him to\r\nmaintain order unless it is accompanied by goodwill. Some men may be\r\nconstitutionally so disaffected that nothing can appease them. But the\r\nmajority can always be satisfied by a generous treatment of their\r\ngrievances. Even after the crisis of the Revolution Pitt might have made\r\nthe state of England more happy than it was. But what he did not do was not\r\nso important as what he had not done. He believed in Parliamentary Reform,\r\nin Catholic Emancipation, in the relief of Dissenters, in Free Trade. He\r\nwas in power from 1783 to the outbreak of the Revolution, and might have\r\nconciliated the middle class and the Irish, diminished public corruption,\r\nstimulated industry, and reduced the cost of living. This would not have\r\nprevented all discontent. But it would have confined it to its essential\r\nand irreducible minimum. {127} Whether this inaction was due to his own\r\nlethargy or the incurable selfishness and stupidity of his associates and\r\nsupporters, it was undoubtedly responsible for a large part of his\r\nsubsequent difficulties. He left heaps of combustible material untouched,\r\nand it was his own fault that it caught fire. In this unhappy state,\r\nlurching between bitter discontent and savage repression, English liberty\r\nstruggled through the great war.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Ireland furnished another battle-ground for contending\r\nprinciples during this period. The complete subjugation of that country was\r\nended in 1782, when demonstrations of armed force wrested legislative\r\nindependence from an England surrounded by foreign enemies. The Irish\r\nParliament was left free to make such laws as it pleased for Ireland, and\r\nthe deliberate destruction of Irish industries in the interest of English\r\nceased for ever. But this independence, though won by the united efforts of\r\nall creeds and classes, was the independence of a Protestant oligarchy. The\r\ngreat bulk of the Irish people escaped an external only to submit to an\r\ninternal tyrant. The Irish Parliament, though patriotic in matters of\r\ncommerce, was hardly any more indulgent than the English in its religious\r\npolicy. Catholics were excluded from the Houses at Dublin as vigorously as\r\nfrom those at Westminster, and few important mitigations of their lot were\r\nobtained from their own countrymen. In 1792 Catholics were admitted to the\r\nBar, mixed marriages were allowed, and it was made legal for a Catholic to\r\neducate his children abroad. In 1793 all public offices were thrown open to\r\nthem, except seats in Parliament and the highest places in the Army, the\r\nJudicature, and the Civil Service. These changes removed the worst\r\ndisabilities of the upper and middle classes, who had now fewer\r\ndisabilities than their fellows in England and Scotland, and there was thus\r\nexhibited a considerable reduction of Protestant insolence. The supremacy\r\nof Pitt in England aroused great hopes that the last stones of the edifice\r\nwould soon be removed. Catholic emancipation would not have cured all the\r\nills of Ireland, any more than Parliamentary Reform would have cured all\r\nthe ills of England. An excessive population, {128} crowded into\r\nagriculture by the destruction of manufactures, demoralized by landowners\r\nwho were too often thriftless or absentees, and deprived of education by\r\nthe laws which prohibited teaching by Catholic priests or laymen, was in a\r\ncondition which mere political reforms could do little to improve. What\r\nCatholic disabilities did was to poison economic discontent by the memories\r\nof racial and religious persecution. The conduct of the English Government\r\nof the day was dangerously uncertain. The hopes of the Catholics were\r\nroused in 1794 by the appointment of Lord Fitzwilliam as Lord-Lieutenant.\r\nFitzwilliam was notoriously in favour of the Catholic claims, even though\r\nhe was not authorized to make any promises on behalf of the Government. He\r\nwas too open in his professions of sympathy, and when Protestant bigotry\r\nprocured his recall, the apparent treachery only aggravated the bitterness\r\nof old subjection. Catholic resentment and Protestant arrogance soon\r\nbrought matters to a crisis. Neither party gained credit from the rising of\r\n1798. The excesses of the magistrates and the troops before, during, and\r\nafter the fighting were often of mediaeval atrocity, and the retaliation of\r\nthe rebels cannot be justified, though it is amply explained by the\r\ncharacter of the provocation. This fearful outbreak in the middle of the\r\nFrench War satisfied the English Government that only by a Union could\r\nIreland be kept in peace. The good effects of the recent concessions had\r\nvanished in this whirlwind of savagery, and Protestant and Catholic were\r\nonce more in the temper of the Middle Ages. Mutual goodwill could only be\r\nrestored by a common tutelage.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing bad in itself in the plan for a legislative Union. Had it\r\nbeen carried through with a just regard for Irish opinion, and had it been\r\nfollowed by a strict attention to the grievances of the common people, the\r\nUnion might have been one of the brilliant successes of the English race.\r\nIn fact it was itself effected by shameful means, and it was followed by\r\nmisgovernment as fatally unsympathetic as that which had preceded it.\r\nEnglish rule in Ireland was less ferocious in the {129} nineteenth century\r\nthan in the eighteenth. But it was no less conspicuous a failure. No\r\nconstitutional machinery can be better than the men who work it, and\r\nEnglishmen after the Union showed themselves no less unimaginative and\r\negoistic than their predecessors. The objects of the Union were stated by\r\nPitt, with perfect good faith, to be the substitution of government by an\r\nimpartial authority for government by a faction which was steeped in the\r\nmemories of old oppression. \"An impartial Legislature standing aloof from\r\nlocal party connection, sufficiently removed from the influence of\r\ncontending factions to be advocate or champion of neither, being so placed\r\nas to have no superstitious reverence for the names and prejudices of\r\nancient families, who have so long enjoyed the exclusive monopolies of\r\ncertain public patronages and property ... this is the thing that is wanted\r\nfor Ireland.\"[147] That was what was wanted for Ireland. What it obtained\r\nwas a Legislature as partial, as inextricably involved in local party\r\nconnection, and as closely wrapped about with superstitious reverence for\r\nancient families and their patronages and property as could have been\r\ncontrived. For half a century at least the government of Ireland remained\r\nwhat it has always been in the hands of England, government by armed force,\r\nin the interests of the landlords against the tenants, of the Protestants\r\nagainst the Catholics. A system which Pitt devised as a protection against\r\nthe old abuses was converted into an effective engine for their\r\nmaintenance. Pitt was himself partly to blame for this disastrous failure.\r\nHe probably never saw the need for economic reorganization. But he saw\r\nclearly enough the need for the ending of religious strife, which poisoned\r\nthe whole temper of the people and wasted on the jealousies of sects and\r\nthe hatred of government energy which would otherwise be free to run in\r\nhealthy and productive channels. His weakness in not pushing on with Lord\r\nFitzwilliam made the rebellion of 1798 inevitable. Similar weakness after\r\nthe Union made the constitutional change useless. It was undoubtedly part\r\nof his original plan to emancipate the Catholics. But the King, the {130}\r\nChurch, and Protestant Ireland were too strong for him. Pitt resigned. The\r\nWhigs came into office, with a Ministry which was united at least on the\r\nCatholic question. The King again had his way, and rather than hold office\r\nwithout fulfilling their Catholic pledges, they resigned in their\r\nturn.[148] Pitt's course was clear. He should have refused to come back\r\nwithout permission to do what he thought right. But he preferred the\r\nconvenience of the King, and accepted office on condition that the Catholic\r\nquestion was left open. This was as effective as a definite refusal.\r\nCanning persuaded the House of Commons in 1812, but Eldon in the Lords\r\ndefeated his colleague's Bill, and until Eldon could be expelled there was\r\nno hope for Ireland. The friendly Tories would never unite with the Whigs\r\nto defeat the hostile Tories. Nothing was done to solve the problem, and\r\nIreland, for a generation after the Union, was governed by coercion.\r\n\r\nThroughout this wretched dispute the Whigs maintained the ancient doctrines\r\nof their party with regard to religious disabilities. But the problem\r\naroused controversy about a second conception of more recent growth, the\r\nconception of nationality. Burke had tried to treat Ireland as an equal\r\nnation for commercial purposes. The Whigs of 1801 extended the idea to its\r\nextreme limits. Had the Irish Parliament the right to surrender its powers\r\nto a Parliament of the United Kingdom without receiving the approval of its\r\nown electors? Unquestionably it had the legal right. Had it also the moral\r\nright? The Whigs held that it had not. \"What right,\" asked Sheridan, \"has\r\nthe Irish Parliament to resolve that, instead of going back to their\r\nconstituents, they shall form part of a foreign legislature?\"[149] \"The\r\nUnion,\" said Fox, \"is not an alteration, but a destruction and annihilation\r\nof the Irish Constitution. Union therefore, like revolution, cannot be\r\njustifiable but by the unequivocal {131} consent of the people.\"[150] Pitt\r\nopposed this doctrine on the usual Tory ground. It led, he said,\r\nimmediately \"to the system of universal right of suffrage in the people, to\r\nthe doctrine that each man should have a share in the government of the\r\ncountry by having a choice for his representative; and then goes back to\r\nthe whole system of Jacobinism.\"[151]\r\n\r\nThe Union was therefore carried through the instrumentality of a\r\nlegislature bribed to betray its constituents. This transaction was much\r\nworse than it appeared. The English Government which neglected the wishes\r\nof the Irish people in this matter would neglect them in all others. The\r\nUnion was a supreme act of despotism, the fitting prelude to the systematic\r\ndisregard of Irish opinion which followed it. \"There must,\" wrote Fox a few\r\nyears later, \"be a fundamental change in the system of governing Ireland,\r\nto give even a chance of future quiet there.... That there should be a part\r\nof the United Kingdom to which our laws, nominally at least, extend, and\r\nwhich is nevertheless in such a state as to call for martial law, etc., so\r\nrepeatedly, is of itself ground for reconsidering, at least, the system by\r\nwhich it is governed.\"[152] The Tories could not understand, even in the\r\ncase of England, that it is the business of a governor to manage and not to\r\ncoerce the governed, and race and religion combined to obscure still\r\nfurther their view of Ireland. The system remained what it had been and\r\nwas, and the consequences of this fatal negligence are with us to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of the Government gave not a few opportunities for\r\nexpressions of Liberalism. The rights of nationalities were in issue in the\r\nbeginning of the French War, in the treatment of Ireland, in the descent\r\nupon Copenhagen, and in the negotiations which followed the downfall {132}\r\nof Napoleon. In all these cases the Whig Opposition stated the pure Liberal\r\ndoctrine. In that of the war with France, one section of them carried the\r\ndoctrine to an absurd extent. In origin, the war was unquestionably a war\r\nof interference, an attempt to force upon the French people an obnoxious\r\ngovernment, and to compel them to abandon those new and revolutionary\r\nprinciples which they had adopted for themselves. Pitt himself had\r\napparently no such object, and was hurried into the war partly by the\r\nFrench threats of assisting other peoples to revolt, and chiefly by the\r\nirresistible pressure of the English governing class. It is impossible to\r\nread contemporary literature, the debates in Parliament, the newspapers,\r\nthe pamphlets of Burke and other acknowledged leaders of opinion, the\r\nresolutions of corporations and public meetings, and the private\r\ncorrespondence, without coming to the conclusion that the great bulk of\r\ninfluential political society was inspired by a fanatical hatred of the new\r\nopinions. Whatever pretexts may have been urged in public, and may have\r\nbeen in fact held by comparatively sober people like Pitt, the impelling\r\nforce behind the English armies was dread of French principles. The sword\r\nof the invader could not have been feared more than the fatal contagion of\r\nhis ideas. The Germans and Austrians, who invaded France in 1792 to restore\r\nthe monarchy, were less concerned to hide their motives than the English\r\nGovernment. But there was little difference in substance between them. The\r\nContinental Sovereigns moved of their own motion. The English Ministers\r\nwere carried on by their supporters.\r\n\r\nAgainst a war of this kind the Whigs spoke forcibly and with justice.\r\nLansdowne described it as \"a war, the alleged object of which was to repel\r\nunprovoked aggressions, but the real one to prescribe laws to an\r\nindependent country.\"[153] It was \"a metaphysical war; it was declared\r\nagainst France on account of her internal circumstances.\"[154] Fox said it\r\nwas no better than the methods of the Inquisition. We were killing people\r\nbecause they thought differently from ourselves. \"How could we blame all\r\n{133} those abominable acts of bloodshed and torture, which had been\r\ncommitted from time to time under the specious name of religion, when we\r\nourselves had the presumption to wage a similar war?\"[155] It was \"the most\r\ngross violation of everything sacred which could exist between nation and\r\nnation, as striking at the root of the right which each must ever possess\r\nof internal legislation.\"[156] \"Whatever our detestation of the guilt of\r\nforeign nations may be, we are not called to take upon ourselves the task\r\nof avengers; we are bound only to act as guardians of the welfare of those\r\nwith whose concerns we are immediately entrusted.\"[157]\r\n\r\nThis language was wise, and its wisdom was proved by events. The Bourbons\r\nwere not restored. The temper of the French people was incredibly\r\nstimulated. The new system which might have repelled by its violence and\r\nrapacity became the centre of the national enthusiasm. It inflicted a\r\ncrushing defeat upon its foreign invaders and then proceeded to avenge this\r\nadditional injury by the massacre of those whom the invasion was intended\r\nto assist. Whether Napoleon would have appeared in French history or not\r\nwithout this strengthening of the Revolutionary system, it is impossible to\r\nsay. Certainly the foreign interference with the first Government\r\nconsolidated the nation, and prepared for Napoleon's use the most\r\nformidable weapon that he could have obtained for the braying of Europe.\r\nThere is a tragic instance of that insight which is not foresight in the\r\ncorrespondence of Castlereagh, and it shows how completely the English\r\nGovernment misunderstood what they had done. \"The only thing ... which\r\nreally dispirits me is, the unprecedented struggle of order against\r\nanarchy, and the unfortunate facility with which France recruits her army\r\nas fast as the sword exterminates it. A few days transforms their\r\nragamuffins into troops, which are not contemptible even when opposed to\r\nthe best soldiers in Europe.... It is the first time that _all_ the\r\npopulation and _all_ the wealth of a great kingdom has been concentrated in\r\nthe field: what may be the result is beyond my perception.\"[158] {134} What\r\nwas going on was that anarchy was being reduced into order within the\r\nboundaries of France, and no hatred of early extravagance or subsequent\r\ntyranny need blind us to the courage, energy, and skill of those French\r\nstatesmen who, in the face of their enemies, built up the new system upon\r\nthe ruins of the old. The war made their task comparatively easy, and if it\r\ndiminished their strength, it made their material more workable. The\r\nforeign invasion operated like a powerful electric current, and fused the\r\nscattered particles of French nationalism into a solid bulk. The whole\r\nfiery mass of France was being beaten and welded and forged into something\r\nwhich Castlereagh could not understand: a nation, every member of which had\r\na personal interest in and a personal devotion to his nationality. Such a\r\nthing had not been known before in France. But it was not long before even\r\nCastlereagh was made to feel that in the councils of Europe the rights of\r\nman might count for as much as government by orders.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs carried their maintenance of the equal rights of nationalities to\r\nits inevitable conclusion that nations, no less than individuals, must be\r\nbound by moral rules in their dealings with each other. Fox declared that\r\n\"the greatest resource a nation can possess, the sweet source of power, is\r\na strict attention to the principles of justice. I firmly believe that the\r\ncommon proverb of honesty being the best policy is as applicable to nations\r\nas to individuals ... and that cases which may sometimes be supposed\r\nexceptions arise from our taking narrow views of the subject, and being\r\nunable at once to comprehend the whole.\"[159] When he was almost at the\r\npoint of death he proceeded to suggest an international congress for\r\nsettling disputes. \"He disapproved ... of any government pursuing under the\r\ntitle of indemnities a system of partition of States, making some\r\nrepublics, some monarchies, and annihilating the political existence of\r\nothers, without regard to moral rectitude or to the common feelings of\r\nmankind, which considerations had more influence on the affairs of the\r\nworld than some politicians were aware. The partition {135} of Poland, the\r\nseizure of Holland, the subjugation of Switzerland, and the division of\r\nStates, by the agreement of some, and by the fraud and rapacity of others,\r\nhad done more to destroy the confidence of mankind in each other than all\r\nthe other misconduct of the powers put together. In private society, when\r\nmen lost their confidence in one another, the compact was dissolved. The\r\nsame rule applied to States, for they were only aggregates of individuals.\r\nHe recommended to all the powers of Europe a system of justice and\r\nmoderation, as the only means of putting an end to the evils under which we\r\nlabour. He recommended a general congress, and that these principles should\r\nbe prevalent in its deliberations.\"[160]\r\n\r\nThese principles of international morality were applied most forcibly to\r\nthe destruction of the Danish fleet at Copenhagen in 1805. The Danes were\r\nnot hostile to us, and in common with all the other small peoples of Europe\r\nthey had every reason to fear Napoleon. The English Government knew that\r\nNapoleon intended, if he could, to use the Danish fleet against them. The\r\nEnglish fleet accordingly was sent to Copenhagen to demand the surrender of\r\nthe Danish ships, and on receiving a very natural refusal, destroyed some\r\nand carried off the rest. This proceeding is generally treated in English\r\nschools as a matter for national gratification. To Liberals it appears a\r\nvery dangerous abuse of arbitrary power. Contemporary Europe was of the\r\nsame opinion, and the direct consequence of the affair was to range all the\r\nNorthern States on the side of Napoleon. We deprived him of the Danish\r\nships, and we threw into his hands the Danish army, and all the forces of\r\nSweden, Norway, and Russia as well. The chorus of denunciation in\r\nParliament was for once not confined to the Whigs. Even Windham said \"he\r\nwould sooner have seen the Danish fleet in Buonaparte's hands than in ours,\r\nunder all the circumstances of the case.\"[161] Erskine lamented that the\r\nwhole course of civilization had been interrupted by this act. \"If anything\r\ncould give delight in reading the history of civilized nations, it was the\r\nprogressive improvement that was to be traced {136} in law and civilization\r\namongst the nations of the world. This was the first instance in which the\r\nprinciples of that amelioration had been trampled upon by us.\"[162] Lord\r\nMoira spoke in the same strain. \"As long as there was a power in Europe\r\nwhich, from its regard to justice and to the rights of other States, could\r\nform a sort of rallying-point to the oppressed, there was some probability\r\nthat the nations who were groaning under the yoke of a pitiless and\r\ninexorable tyrant would have watched for some opportunity, and made some\r\nexertion in common to throw it off. Such a power was this country, previous\r\nto the late most unjustifiable and unfortunate attack upon Denmark; but by\r\nthis attack that hope had been completely extinguished.\"[163] Grey disposed\r\nof the argument that reasons of State could justify immorality. \"So far\r\nfrom adding to the safety of the country, that point on which its safety\r\nmost particularly depended, he meant its honour, had not only been greatly\r\nweakened, but had in fact received a mortal stab.\"[164] Prior to this\r\noppression of the Danes, England had had the chance of heading a European\r\nmovement for emancipation from Napoleon. Every small State might have\r\nsupported her as a protector, and every large one as an ally against a\r\ndangerous rival. After the attack it became for the small States simply a\r\nchoice between two protectors, either of whom seemed to offer security\r\nagainst the other if not against itself. The exasperation of the moment\r\nswung the balance to the side of Napoleon, and England found herself face\r\nto face with a hostile Continent.[165]\r\n\r\nFortunately for the country, the Government soon effected a great change in\r\ntheir policy. For the first time they enlisted on their side what the\r\nFrench had had from the beginning, the idea of nationality. The war had\r\nentirely changed its character. Beginning as an interference with the\r\ninternal affairs of the French people, it had merged, since the rise of\r\nNapoleon, into a struggle against a power which was as universal in its\r\nappetite {137} as it was unscrupulous in its methods. Against this force,\r\nwhich was so astonishing that it appeared to many pious Christians as\r\nAnti-Christ himself, schemes and combinations had proved powerless. England\r\nhad escaped disaster because she was an island. The rest of Europe, with\r\nthe exception of Russia, had been beaten to the ground. These dynastic\r\ncontrivances of kings and emperors wanted the national spirit which\r\nsupported their adversary. To the common people in many parts of Europe\r\nNapoleon appeared as a deliverer from their domestic oppressors, and the\r\nlittle states of Germany and Italy, which he had carved out of the bigger,\r\nwere ready enough to see a champion of freedom in one who tyrannized only\r\nover tyrants. The end began when he deposed a Spanish king and put his own\r\nbrother on the throne of the proudest and most exclusive nation of Europe.\r\nThe Peninsular War at last found England in her right place, at the head of\r\na league of nationalities. The Whig Opposition, always weak in numbers, was\r\nnow broken to pieces. Part of it repeated the old arguments, which applied\r\nto everything but the present facts, hailed Napoleon as the champion of\r\nliberty, and even expressed regret at his downfall at Waterloo. The wiser\r\nmen saw at once the significance of the Spanish expedition. Canning was now\r\nthe Tory Foreign Secretary. He found a hearty supporter in Grey among the\r\nWhigs, and both felt an idea in what for Castlereagh was still no more than\r\na matter of business. \"Of all the infamies ever incurred by a nation,\" said\r\nGrey, \"I think the greatest would have been to have appeared to abandon the\r\nSpaniards.\"[166] \"The allies have now been placed by France in the\r\nsituation in which France was originally placed by the allies. The success\r\nof both has been occasioned by the spirit of resistance, produced by injury\r\nand oppression; and my great hopes of the present confederacy are chiefly\r\nderived from this, that it has arisen rather from the feeling of the\r\npeoples than the policy of the Governments which it embraces.\"[167] The new\r\nprinciple succeeded at last. The Spanish people, with English {138} help,\r\ncrippled Napoleon, the Russian people wore him out, and the German people\r\noverwhelmed him. In 1815 the victory of Waterloo completed his destruction,\r\nand the European peoples had at last leisure to look to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComparing the England of 1815 with the England of 1790, the Liberals of the\r\ntime would find little cause for satisfaction. The economic problems of the\r\ncountry were more acute, and the attempts to remedy them directly by\r\nlegislation and indirectly by encouraging combinations of workmen had been\r\ndefeated. A solitary Act of 1802, which did something to regulate the\r\nconditions of parish children who had been apprenticed to private\r\nemployers, was the only measure of protection which had passed into law.\r\nParliamentary Reform and Religious Emancipation seemed more remote than\r\never. The principle of nationality had been violated in Ireland, and if the\r\nrecognition of it in the later stages of the war gave some ground for\r\nfuture confidence, hope was soon to be dispelled.\r\n\r\nUnhappily for the common people, the spirit of nationality had been used\r\nonly as a means and not as an end by the various enemies of Napoleon. No\r\nsooner was the common enemy destroyed than the victorious monarchs sat down\r\nto cut up and distribute Europe among themselves. They had fought, not the\r\nFrench, but the French Revolution, and when the main conflagration had been\r\nextinguished, they had still to stamp out the burning embers which had been\r\nblown about its borders. The young Republics which had been created were to\r\nbe restored to their old rulers, and all the ancient monarchies were to be\r\nre-established, and where necessary strengthened by the acquisition of new\r\nterritory. There is something almost ludicrous to modern eyes in the\r\nspectacle of these kings and emperors and their chancellors and envoys\r\nassigning and allotting human beings, by millions together, without\r\ninquiring into the wishes or interests of those with whom they dealt.\r\nEngland participated in the game, and Toryism and Liberalism were again\r\nbrought into conflict. {139}\r\n\r\nThe Tory view, expressed by Castlereagh and Liverpool, was hardly less\r\ncallous than that of the Tzar Alexander himself. There is hardly a word in\r\nany of their speeches or dispatches which shows any tenderness for men and\r\nwomen as such. Human beings to them were only subjects. The old form of\r\nEurope was to be restored, subject only to such changes as were necessary\r\nto strengthen the principal enemies of Revolutionary France. To the balance\r\nof power was to be sacrificed all local or national independence. \"Upon the\r\nsubject of Austria and Prussia,\" wrote Lord Liverpool, \"we must always\r\nexpect a degree of jealousy on the part of every French Government. It is\r\nquite essential, however, to any balance of power that these two monarchies\r\nshould be made respectable. The principle recognized in the early part of\r\nthis year, that Austria should have a population in the whole of about\r\n27,000,000 of souls, and Prussia one of about 11,000,000, appears to be\r\nquite reasonable, and ought to give no umbrage to France.\"[168] Lord\r\nLiverpool wrote of \"souls,\" but if he had been writing of cattle his\r\nlanguage would have been no different. Castlereagh was no better. The\r\nCongress of Vienna, at which this vivisection of a continent took place,\r\nhad in his eyes two objects, to check France and to check Russia. Prussia\r\nand Austria must therefore be aggrandized. Italy might be the next free\r\npeople and become as dangerous as France, and the dream of her unity and\r\nindependence must be subordinated to the necessity of at once strengthening\r\nAustria against Russia and of suppressing those small states upon which\r\nNapoleon had conferred independence. Venice, an ancient Republic, was\r\nhanded over to Austria. Lest France should infect Italy, the Genoese\r\nRepublic must be annexed to the Kingdom of Piedmont. Lest Russia should\r\ndominate Sweden, Norway must be taken from Denmark and given to Sweden. In\r\norder that Holland might be strengthened against France in the North, she\r\nmust be allowed to annex Belgium. Prussia must be strengthened, but not too\r\nmuch, and accordingly the Kingdom of Saxony was cut in half. The Poles had\r\nbeen {140} divided between Russia, Austria, and Prussia in 1792. They now\r\nexpressed a desire for independence, but in vain.[169] Austria and Prussia\r\nmust be maintained at all costs. Castlereagh regretted that they should be\r\nsacrificed and left them to their fate.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs protested warmly against this infamous disposition of the affairs\r\nof unconsenting peoples. Particular acts, in particular the partition of\r\nPoland, it was not in the power of England to prevent. But that was no\r\nreason why she should give them her formal sanction. \"England,\" said the\r\nyoung Lord John Russell, \"might have appeared as a member of a confederacy\r\nto oppose France without sanctioning any of those acts of pillage by which\r\nthe deliverance of Europe has been disgraced. If she was not able to\r\nprevent those acts, she need not have soiled her fair fame by appearing to\r\ncountenance them.\"[170] But other matters were entirely within the control\r\nof England. She had entered into a treaty with Russia and Sweden, by which\r\nshe bound herself not only formally to transfer Norway from Denmark to\r\nSweden, but actually to compel the Norwegians by force of arms to submit to\r\ntheir new masters. Even Canning, who, though a member of the Government,\r\nheld Liberal opinions in foreign affairs, declared that \"if the question\r\nnow was, whether consent should be given to the treaty, he had no\r\nhesitation in saying that he would refuse it.\"[171] Wilberforce \"considered\r\nthe partitioning of States against their will a most despotic sacrifice of\r\npublic rights.\"[172] Lord Grenville appealed \"to the old-established and\r\ntrue principles of national law in opposition to the new-fangled doctrine\r\nof utility, or, in other words, the subversion of all moral principle,\" and\r\ndenounced \"the horrible injustice by which an unoffending people were to be\r\nbent to the dominion of a foreign power.\"[173] Grey expressed the complete\r\nLiberal theory. \"The principles are the same in the one case and the other,\r\nwhether between individuals or {141} between States. No matter to what\r\ndegree the impunity of power might silence the claims of right, its nature\r\ncannot be altered; it is equally sacred, equally important, and is equally\r\nto be recognized, in every attempt to protect the weak against the\r\nstrong.... The rights of the Sovereign over his subjects are not the rights\r\nof property. They do not confer the privilege of transferring them from one\r\nto another like cattle attached to the soil.... The Sovereign might\r\nwithdraw himself from their protection. He might absolve them from their\r\nallegiance to himself; but he had no right to transfer their allegiance to\r\nany other State. It became, then, the right of the people to decide to whom\r\ntheir allegiance should be given.\"[174] He dealt in fitting terms with the\r\ncontention that it was after all for the benefit of the Norwegian people.\r\n\"Can it be argued,\" he asked, \"that any country shall be obliged to accept\r\nwhat a foreign State thinks proper to consider as happiness? No sort of\r\ntyranny can, in my judgment, be conceived more complete than that a\r\nGovernment should undertake to force another people to submit to that\r\nsystem which such Government may regard as happy, although that people may\r\nthink quite the contrary.\"[175] Neither the reluctance of Canning nor the\r\nattacks of the Whigs could prevent the outrage. The British fleet blockaded\r\nthe Norwegian ports, and the Norwegian people submitted to their new\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{142}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE DECLINE OF TORYISM\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the war closed the outlet through which the national\r\nenergies had been so long strained, and left the people free to contemplate\r\ntheir own situation. Popular discontent again made itself felt, and it was\r\nmore formidable than ever. Trade was dislocated by the peace, industries\r\nwere reduced which had fattened upon the war, and the numbers of the idle\r\nworkmen were swollen by disbanded soldiers and sailors. At the same time\r\nbad harvests diminished the supply of corn, and a new Corn Law which\r\nprohibited imports till the home price was eighty shillings a quarter\r\naggravated the effects of natural deficiency. Wages in some trades were\r\nbad, and grew worse. In 1819 ribbon and silk weavers of Coventry petitioned\r\nParliament to provide them with the means of emigrating to another country.\r\nThey worked sixteen hours a day, in some cases for eighteenpence or half a\r\ncrown a week. None of them earned more than ten shillings a week. A\r\nhand-loom cotton weaver could make only five or six shillings a week. A\r\npound a week was a good wage for a workman in any industry.[176] The price\r\nof corn rose higher and higher. In January, 1816, a quarter of wheat cost\r\nfifty-two shillings and sixpence. In June, 1817, it cost a hundred and\r\nseventeen shillings.[177] As each member of the working class consumed on\r\nthe average about one quarter a year, it {143} follows that a family of\r\nfive spent on bread at the rate of L13 a year at the first rate, and\r\neighteen months later at the rate of L29. The whole income of a weaver\r\nmight be swallowed up in buying bread alone, and his family be still left\r\nin want.\r\n\r\nTo this dreadful picture a comic touch was not wanting. The Lord Advocate\r\nonce referred to it in language which shows how remotely separated were the\r\npeople and their rulers. \"In many instances,\" he said, \"the manufacturers,\r\nwho in former times were in the habit of attending church, now employed the\r\nforenoon of the Sabbath in political discussions; and it was a common\r\npractice for weavers to work at their looms on the same day, and till a\r\nlate hour of the night--and this too with their windows open, to the horror\r\nand disgust of the passengers.\"[178] The economic necessity which deprived\r\nthe wretched artisans even of the day appointed for their rest was thus\r\ntwisted into a stain upon their character. It is not surprising that they\r\ndiscussed politics. Pending their emancipation, they had only three\r\npossible aids, starvation, parish relief, and charity; and many unhappy\r\nworkmen and their families experienced all three. Political agitation\r\nrevived on the conclusion of peace, and it was more extensive and more\r\ndetermined than before. It was met by the same dull and brutal repression\r\nand refusal of redress.\r\n\r\nWe have before us all the evidence upon which the Government proceeded, and\r\nthere can be even less doubt than in connection with the events of twenty\r\nyears before that its action was wrong and foolish. Almost every\r\ndisturbance which took place could be traced to industrial or agrarian\r\ncauses, and the ordinary law was in all cases sufficient. The Government\r\npreferred to treat the riots as proof of a general conspiracy against the\r\nState, and they took extraordinary steps in order to suppress them. In 1817\r\nthey suspended the Habeas Corpus Act. The suspensions of the {144} earlier\r\nperiod might have been justified by the universal war, by the rapid\r\ndispersion of Jacobin principles, by the dangerous state of Ireland. The\r\nsuspension of 1817 had no such excuse. The paroxysm of the French\r\nRevolution had come to an end. Ireland was disaffected but subdued. There\r\nwas no war. The Government had nothing to do but to attend to the condition\r\nof the people. But this was the last thing which it occurred to the\r\nGovernment to do. Even when the original impulse had ceased to operate,\r\nthey continued to move in the line of reaction, and repeated mechanically\r\nthe watchwords of their predecessors, who had at least the excuse that they\r\nwere surprised and horrified. Sidmouth gravely described the Radicals as\r\n\"the enemy.\"[179] It never seems to have occurred to any one in authority\r\nthat Radicalism and riots were not cause and effect, and instead of\r\ngrappling with the economic conditions which were equally the cause of\r\nboth, Ministers discussed nothing but the means whereby the law was to be\r\nmore easily enforced.[180] Undoubtedly there were occasional disturbances\r\nof a serious character. Between 1801 and 1811 the population increased by\r\n21 per cent. The bulk of increase was among the North Country artisans,\r\nwhose growing numbers at once made their economic distress and their\r\npolitical impotence more conspicuous than ever. There was a dangerous riot\r\nin Spa Fields, London, in November, 1816. Another occurred at Huddersfield\r\nin the following May, a third at Derby, and a fourth at Nottingham. Secret\r\nsocieties were formed in different parts of the country, and the tongue of\r\nHunt and the pen of William Cobbett, rivalling the earlier popularity of\r\n{145} the _Rights of Man_, led the Government to suppose that the whole\r\nfabric of society was in danger. The Habeas Corpus Act was suspended, the\r\nSeditious Meetings Act was revived, and Secret Committees of both Houses\r\nwere appointed to collect information.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the reports of these Committees that there was nothing in\r\nthe state of the country to justify these unusual measures. The great mass\r\nof the people showed no sympathy with the rioters. Education was spreading\r\nrapidly in Lancashire, Yorkshire, and Scotland, and the artisans were\r\nthinking for themselves. Violence was rare, but agitation was general.\r\nLarge bodies of people marched to public meetings at Manchester, Leeds,\r\nBirmingham, and other provincial towns. Not a shadow of proof was produced\r\nby the Committees that these had any criminal intention, and one fact is\r\nsufficient to prove the contrary. At almost every meeting women and\r\nchildren were present.[181] The discipline and order of these crowds were\r\nindeed, in the obscure reasonings of men like Liverpool, Sidmouth, and\r\nCastlereagh, an additional proof of their seditious character. A turbulent\r\ncommon people never puzzled a Tory. It was the nature of the beast to be\r\ndisorderly. But a common people which thought, and spoke, and organized,\r\nand met and dispersed in companies at the advice of its leaders, was a\r\nthing which he could not understand. What he could not understand, he\r\nfeared. Not the least significant fact in this record of dull and\r\nunimaginative mismanagement is the connection between Castlereagh and\r\nContinental statesmen of the type of Metternich. These people had formed a\r\nHoly Alliance for the express purpose of suppressing attempts to establish\r\nLiberal Constitutions in Europe. Castlereagh, representing Great Britain,\r\nhad refused to join the Alliance. But in his own country he was pursuing\r\nits very policy, as the European despots well knew. The letters in which\r\nthe Courts of {146} Vienna and Berlin congratulated him on his suspension\r\nof the Habeas Corpus Act and the right of public meeting are among the most\r\ndegrading which have ever passed through the British Foreign Office.[182]\r\n\r\nThe worst incident of this struggle between people and Government was the\r\naffair of Peterloo. This showed, as vividly as could have been desired, how\r\ncompletely the working class was at the mercy of a governing class, which\r\ncontrolled Parliament, the Army, and the Bench. A large but peaceful\r\nmeeting, containing many women and children, was held in St. Peter's\r\nSquare, Manchester, to hear speeches by Hunt and other popular leaders. The\r\ncrowd had gathered from all the towns in the neighbourhood, and had\r\nmarched, unarmed but in military order, to the place of assembly. The\r\nmagistrates thought they were faced with rebellion. They sent police and\r\nyeomen to arrest Hunt, who stood on a waggon in the middle of the crowd.\r\nThe yeomen got entangled among the people, and with the assistance of some\r\nhussars proceeded to convert the meeting into a riot. Men, women, and\r\nchildren were cut down or trampled by the horses; a few were killed and\r\nmany injured. The action of the soldiers was endorsed by the magistrates\r\nand by the Government.[183] Whigs in both houses protested and demanded an\r\ninquiry, and Radical meetings everywhere denounced the affair as a\r\nmassacre. The Government listened neither to expostulation nor to abuse.\r\nThey refused to hold an inquiry. Persons injured had a legal remedy, and it\r\nwas not the business of the executive to investigate matters which might\r\ncome before the judiciary. It was true that a man or woman who was cut down\r\nin the midst of a panic-stricken mob might be unable to identify the\r\ncavalryman concerned. But it was not the business of the Government to step\r\nin where the law failed. Besides, the magistracy were honourable and\r\npatriotic men, and it would cast a slur upon them and weaken {147} their\r\nauthority if their superiors examined their conduct. The language of\r\nMinisters was in keeping with their whole policy. The people were to be\r\nkept down, and it was not necessary, seeing that they were politically\r\npowerless, to be squeamish about ways and means. All the usual arguments\r\nwere thus employed to protect the official wrongdoers against the public.\r\nOne official will always defend the wickedness of another against private\r\npersons who happen to be unpopular, and a Secretary of State, who can rely\r\non the support of a resentful party, will always ignore the wrongs of\r\npolitical opponents upon whose votes he is not forced to depend.[184] It is\r\nin agitations for the franchise that we learn best to appreciate it. In no\r\nother circumstances is the tendency to abuse power greater in the governor,\r\nnor the incapacity to obtain redress more conspicuous in the governed.\r\n\r\nThe direct consequence of this wanton abuse of power was to increase the\r\ndisaffection of the common people and to stimulate the Whigs in Parliament.\r\nMuch as they hated Radicals, the Whigs were too honestly indignant to\r\ntolerate executive outrage of this kind, and too anxious to retain their\r\nown leadership of constitutional opposition, to leave all the work of\r\nprotest to the Radicals themselves.[185] The citizens of London, York,\r\nBristol, Nottingham, and other large towns sent addresses to the Prince\r\nRegent, and a great meeting of Yorkshire voters was summoned by no less a\r\nperson than Lord Fitzwilliam, the Lord-Lieutenant of the county. The\r\nGovernment was more frightened than ever, and contrived new methods of\r\nrepression. Fitzwilliam was dismissed from his office, and Sir Francis\r\nBurdett was fined L2,000 and imprisoned for three months for publishing a\r\nviolent criticism in a newspaper. Castlereagh then introduced the notorious\r\nSix Acts. The drilling which had preceded popular meetings was made\r\nillegal. The trial of offenders was to be more expeditious. The magistrates\r\nwere authorized to issue warrants to search for {148} arms. Transportation\r\nwas made the punishment for a second conviction for seditious libel. Public\r\nmeetings were restricted. Pamphlets were subjected to the same stamp duties\r\nas newspapers. A touch of comedy was lent to these proceedings by a grant\r\nof L1,000,000 for the purposes of building new churches. This had two\r\nobjects. The first was to check the spread of Dissent. \"It was their duty,\"\r\nsaid Lord Liverpool, \"to take care that those who received the benefits of\r\neducation should not be obliged to resort to Dissenting places of worship\r\nby finding the doors of the church shut against them.\" But the second\r\nobject was to prevent political agitation. \"The recent increase of\r\npopulation,\" said the same statesman, \"had taken place chiefly in the\r\nmanufacturing towns; and it was impossible that great masses of human\r\nbeings should be brought together in the manner in which they were situated\r\nin these towns without being exposed to vicious habits, and to corrupting\r\ninfluences dangerous to the public security as well as to private\r\nmorality.\"[186] The gravity with which such remedial measures as this were\r\nproposed shows how utterly the Tories had failed to understand their\r\nbusiness. It is always the habit of a Tory to suppose that popular\r\ndiscontent is a matter of preaching. It is always preached up, and it can\r\nalways be preached down. The people ask for bread, and the Tories offer\r\nthem a dogma. The Government of 1819 was no wiser than its predecessors,\r\nand it applied itself with great diligence to convert the people by words\r\nfrom a disposition which arose directly out of a combination of low wages\r\nand high prices. They were saved by the forces of nature. The Regent\r\nascended the throne as George IV in 1820, and his scandalous prosecution of\r\nhis wife for a short time gave the people a new cry against the Government.\r\nBut with the defeat of the Bill of Pains and Penalties the popular feeling\r\nsubsided. Ministers had imagined themselves to be faced with a conspiracy\r\nbetween the Queen and the populace like that which had placed Catherine II\r\non the throne of Russia. But the death of the Queen removed the {149}\r\nleader, and good harvests, by bringing down the cost of living, reduced the\r\nsufferings of the people. The Tories remained in office for another ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAn attempt at economic reform was made at this time of crisis which\r\ndeserves some notice. On the 16th December, 1819, Sir William de Crespigny\r\nmoved that a Select Committee of the Commons be appointed to inquire into\r\nRobert Owen's scheme of co-operative production in New Lanark. Owen's\r\nexperiment eventually failed. But as an experiment it was immensely\r\nvaluable, and afforded abundant proof of the value of education, of the\r\nreduction of child labour, of a short working day, and of good conditions\r\nof housing and factory administration. Parliament could not have failed to\r\nprofit by the study of such an excellent model. During the debate on\r\nCrespigny's motion, many professions of sympathy with distressed workmen\r\nwere made, and not a few compliments were paid to the owner of the New\r\nLanark mills. But Owen had made two dangerous blunders. As a Socialist he\r\nhad spoken against private property, and his religious opinions were\r\nunorthodox. His scheme was therefore \"subversive of the religion and\r\ngovernment of the country,\" and Tories like Castlereagh, Pietists like\r\nWilberforce, and individualist economists like Ricardo joined in denouncing\r\nit. The argument of Wilberforce shows with what conscientious frivolity\r\nthese governors studied the condition of their subjects. If Owen's plan, he\r\nsaid, \"proceeded upon a system of morals founded upon no religion whatever,\r\nbut rather upon considerations of moral rectitude of conduct only, he was\r\nof opinion that it behoved the House to be cautious how it gave its\r\nsanction to an institution which did not acknowledge as one of its\r\nessential features that doctrine on whose truth and piety it was not for\r\nhim now to enlarge.\"[187] Upon such barriers the motion was shipwrecked. It\r\nwas lost by 141 votes to 16, and the working classes were left to the\r\ntender mercies of competition.\r\n\r\nEverything at home seemed hopeless for the cause of {150} Liberalism. But\r\nwhile the demand for reform seemed to have grown weaker and its concession\r\nmore remote, the aspect of foreign affairs was much more favourable. During\r\nthis last period of Tory domination, which extended from the accession of\r\nGeorge IV in 1820 to his death in 1830, the principle of nationality was\r\nsteadily and courageously maintained. In capacity the members of these Tory\r\nGovernments, with the exceptions of George Canning and Sir Robert Peel,\r\nwere inferior to all who had held office before them since 1791.\r\nCastlereagh, the strongest of the older men, killed himself in 1822.\r\nLiverpool, who was Prime Minister from 1812 to 1827, was a respectable\r\nmediocrity. Sidmouth was rather less. Eldon, as Lord Chancellor, reigned\r\nsupreme in the Lords, and nearly every measure of reform which was pushed\r\nthrough the Commons was overwhelmed in the Lords by his single argument.\r\n\"The change now proposed was in direct contradiction to what their\r\nancestors had supposed to be the constitution; whether they were right or\r\nnot in that supposition was a matter which he would not take it upon him to\r\ndecide.\"[188] But foreign affairs were happily outside the control of the\r\nHouse of Lords, and Canning, who joined the Government after Castlereagh's\r\ndeath, managed them in the temper of pure Liberalism. Except on the\r\nCatholic question, Canning was in domestic politics a Tory. But his zeal\r\nfor the rights of nationalities was as warm as that of Fox himself, and he\r\nnever failed to encourage the growth of that spirit which had finally\r\novercome Napoleon. He became the acknowledged leader of European\r\nLiberalism. Even Castlereagh, after the great partition of Europe had been\r\ncompleted, had declined to interfere in foreign civil wars, or to assist in\r\nthe coercion of rebellious nationalities. Canning turned the cold negations\r\nof his predecessor into warm encouragement and remonstrance.\r\n\r\nThe first difficulties arose in Spain. The expulsion of the French had been\r\nfollowed by the restoration of the Spanish dynasty, and the promises of\r\nfree institutions which had been used to stir up popular feeling were soon\r\nforgotten. Once {151} secure upon his throne, King Ferdinand proceeded with\r\ngreat vigour to suppress what elements of liberty he could discover in his\r\ndominions, and by 1822 the whole of Northern Spain was in a state of civil\r\nwar and the South American Colonies were in revolt. The Holy Alliance had\r\nbeen contrived for just such circumstances as these. The French King sent\r\nan army into Spain to help King Ferdinand. That this was an outrage not\r\neven Castlereagh and Liverpool could deny, though it merely imitated the\r\npolicy of the English Tories of 1793. They declined to join the Holy\r\nAlliance, and they addressed a strong protest to the guilty Powers. They\r\ndeclined, on the other hand, to go to war on behalf of one half of the\r\nSpanish people against the other. The system of Spanish government was for\r\nthe Spanish people to decide. But the revolt of the Colonies gave Canning\r\nan opportunity of which he was glad to avail himself. At the earliest\r\nopportunity he formally recognized the revolutionary Governments. The\r\nestablishment of a reactionary monarchy in Spain, where the issue of the\r\ncivil war was in doubt, was one thing, the extension of the reaction to\r\ncolonies which had set themselves completely free from their former rulers\r\nwas another. There was no question here of appearing as a partisan in a\r\ndomestic dispute. The Colonies were in fact independent. Was England to\r\nremain passive while they were reduced once more into subjection? Canning\r\nwas resolved that if despotism were to be the rule on the Continent of\r\nEurope it should not be extended beyond those limits. He \"called the New\r\nWorld into existence to redress the balance of the Old,\"[189] and no one\r\nwho compares the present condition of South America with that of Spain will\r\nquestion the wisdom any more than the expediency of his act.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of Portugal produced a similar problem, and in 1826 Canning\r\nwent so far as to send troops to Lisbon to protect the Portuguese Liberal\r\nRegency from Spanish invasion. In 1828 Don Miguel usurped the Portuguese\r\nthrone and violated the constitution which as Regent he had sworn to\r\nprotect. The {152} Tory Government, which had lost Canning in 1827, and was\r\nnow in the hands of Wellington, adopted the strict Liberal attitude of not\r\ndictating to the Portuguese people how they should be governed. If they\r\nprevented France from supporting despotism, they could not, with any\r\nconsistency, themselves support democracy. \"Don Miguel,\" said Peel, \"was\r\nthe person administering _de facto_ the government of Portugal, and he\r\ncould not think it prudent on the part of England to undertake to displace\r\nhim and to dictate to the Portuguese who should be their ruler.\"[190] But\r\nthe Government went farther than inaction. An expedition was fitted out in\r\nEngland by Portuguese refugees, and made a descent upon the Azores. A\r\nBritish ship fired on them and turned them back. It was the manner of the\r\nact rather than the act itself which was at fault. If the Government were\r\nbound not to assist the Constitutionalists in Portugal, they were bound to\r\nprevent their own territory from being made a base for their operations.\r\nThe expedition should never have been allowed to sail. The use of armed\r\nforce on the high seas was very unpopular, and Wellington was severely\r\ncriticized by the Whigs. Their instinct was right, if their conduct was\r\nwrong. Wellington was in fact not so much refraining from interference in\r\nthe domestic affairs of Portugal as suppressing a democratic movement. \"We\r\nare determined,\" he wrote, \"that there shall be no revolutionary movement\r\nfrom England on any part of the world.\"[191] He was equally determined, as\r\nsubsequent events showed, that there should be no revolutionary movement in\r\nEngland itself. He would have drilled the English people as he allowed\r\nMiguel to drill the Portuguese, and if his policy was Liberal, his temper\r\nwas Tory.\r\n\r\nThe debates on these Portuguese incidents are significant, not only because\r\nthey reveal an almost universal acceptance of the principle of\r\nnon-interference, but because they contain the ominous expressions of\r\ndissent from that principle which fell from the lips of Palmerston.\r\nPalmerston had succeeded Canning at the Foreign Office, and he always\r\nclaimed to be Canning's {153} disciple as well as his successor. He\r\nformally joined the Whig party in 1830, and with the brief interval\r\noccupied by Peel's administration of 1841, dominated the foreign policy of\r\nEngland until his death in 1865. He had all Canning's hatred of foreign\r\ntyranny, but, in his case, generosity was mixed with an arrogance and\r\nvanity which increased his difficulties and often defeated his objects. \"If\r\nby interference,\" he said in the Miguel debates, \"is meant interference by\r\nforce of arms, such interference, the Government are right in saying,\r\ngeneral principles and our own practice forbade us to exert. But if by\r\ninterference is meant intermeddling, and intermeddling in every way, and to\r\nevery extent, short of military force, then I must affirm that there is\r\nnothing in such interference which the laws of nations may not in certain\r\ncases permit.... In like manner as in a particular community any bystander\r\nis at liberty to interfere to prevent a breach of the law of that\r\ncommunity; so also, and upon the same principle, may any nation interpose\r\nto prevent a flagrant violation of the laws of the community of\r\nnations.\"[192] The bystander in a street row is an exact description of\r\nPalmerston in his foreign politics. It is in these passages that we find\r\nthe explanation of a foreign policy which for a whole generation afterwards\r\ndisturbed, irritated, and demoralized the whole civilized world. For the\r\ntime being he continued Canning's policy with success. In spite of\r\nWellington, he assisted to liberate the Greeks from the Turks in 1829, and\r\nit was largely owing to his bold opposition to France that Belgium burst\r\nthe fetters imposed upon her by the Treaty of Vienna, and wrested her\r\nindependence from Holland in 1830. In foreign affairs Liberalism had thus\r\nmade a great advance since 1820. The interference in French domestic policy\r\nwhich was involved in the war of 1793 had never been repeated, and England,\r\nwhile herself respecting the rights of other nations, had actively assisted\r\nat the emancipation of Portugal, South America, Greece, and Belgium.\r\n\r\nEven in domestic affairs the Tory barriers were being slowly {154} borne\r\ndown by the rising tide. A humanitarian treatment of the lower classes had\r\nalready become apparent in legislation. The punishment of the pillory was\r\nabolished in 1816. The whipping of women was stopped in 1820. In 1823 Peel\r\nsucceeded Sidmouth at the Home Office, and the temper of that department\r\nchanged as conspicuously as that of the Foreign Office changed when Canning\r\ntook the place of Castlereagh. Romilly had fought in vain for mitigations\r\nof the criminal law from 1808 to 1818. Sir James Mackintosh, after him, had\r\nmet with slight success. Peel introduced Government Bills, and overcame\r\neven Eldon and the Bishops in the House of Lords. One hundred capital\r\noffences were abolished by a single one of these Bills. In 1827 it was made\r\nillegal for any one to use man-traps or spring-guns for the capture of\r\nhousebreakers or poachers. In 1802 Peel had passed a Bill for the\r\nprotection and education of parish apprentices who were employed in\r\nmanufactures. In 1819, 1825, and 1829 he applied similar regulations to the\r\ncase of all children, whether paupers or not, who were employed in\r\nfactories. The sum total of these restrictions was little enough, and they\r\nstill permitted a child of ten to be worked for sixty-nine hours a week.\r\nBut they laid the foundation of our system of Factory Law. In 1824 the\r\nCombination Acts were repealed, and an instrument which had been frequently\r\nused for the disablement of workmen agitating for better terms of\r\nemployment was thus taken from the employers. Even before the great Whig\r\nvictory of 1831 there was thus strong evidence of a change in the temper of\r\ngovernment. Political power was retained as jealously as ever. But the\r\nruling class was obviously losing its blind and obstinate reverence for\r\nantiquity and establishments. This change was due partly to the influence\r\nof Evangelical Christianity, which at this time guided a large section of\r\nthe English middle class, including Tories as solid as Wilberforce and\r\nHannah More. This philanthropic Christianity had played a great part in the\r\nabolition of the Slave Trade, and it now operated to humanize in some\r\nmeasure the state of England. But the most powerful {155} influence of the\r\ntime was a philosophy which was identified with revolution and free thought\r\nrather than with Toryism and religion. This was the philosophy of Bentham,\r\nor Utilitarianism.\r\n\r\nUnlike the philosophies of men like Cartwright and Paine, Utilitarianism\r\nextended far beyond the boundaries of politics. It was a system of ethics\r\nfrom which political principles were deduced, and it was directed not only\r\nto political institutions, but to social institutions of every kind,\r\nincluding property and marriage. Burke's _French Revolution_, though\r\nprimarily political, had in fact expressed a whole intellectual system, and\r\nits almost mystical Conservatism, believing in the irrational working of\r\nhuman instincts through illogical and hardly comprehended instruments, had\r\nbeen developed and extended by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Benthamism was a\r\nrationalistic and criticizing system, which referred everything to reason\r\nand experience, and would accept nothing merely because it had become by\r\nage the centre of human confidence. The intellectual Conservative tended to\r\nidentify truth with antiquity. That an institution had existed, that an\r\nidea had been generally accepted for a long period, was sufficient proof of\r\nits rightness; it should be criticized with reverence and modified, if at\r\nall, without substantial change. The Benthamite respected nothing and\r\ncriticized everything. Armed with his own practical philosophy, he summoned\r\nevery institution and every idea to stand and give an account of itself,\r\nand if it failed to satisfy him, no degree of antiquity could save it from\r\ncondemnation. Benthamism was thus a profoundly modifying force in other\r\nfields than that of politics. But for the purposes of this book it is not\r\nnecessary to undertake a general examination of it.\r\n\r\nBentham began to preach his philosophy before the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. But its influence was not great until the French War had exhausted\r\npractical Toryism. Largely under the direction of James Mill the new\r\nthinking then began to make headway, and it had produced considerable\r\npolitical results even before the enfranchisement of the middle class in\r\n1832. {156} In the turmoil of warring theories Bentham laid about him with\r\ngreat impartiality. He had no sympathy with antiquity and prescription.\r\nThese were but \"the infantile foolishness of the cradle of the race.\"[193]\r\nBut his contempt for historical Conservatism was equalled by his contempt\r\nfor the conception of natural rights. \"Rights, properly so called, are the\r\ncreatures of law, properly so called; real laws give birth to real\r\nrights.\"[194] He had no patience either with appeals to history or with\r\nabstract reasoning. He was as ready as Paine to cut off society and begin\r\nit afresh, and as little ready as Burke to construct a theory in the air\r\nand apply it without regard to its practical effects. He had one guiding\r\nprinciple--that of utility, by which he meant a tendency to promote human\r\nhappiness. Burke and Coleridge asked, \"How has it grown?\" Cartwright and\r\nPaine asked, \"How does it conform to reason?\" Bentham asked, \"How does it\r\nwork?\" Every institution--the monarchy, the Established Church, the law,\r\nproperty, marriage--was to be examined. If it promoted the general\r\nhappiness, it might remain, however little it realized an abstract ideal.\r\nIf it did not, it must go, whatever its antiquity and splendour. Cumbrous\r\nlegal forms and savage punishments which did not prevent crime must be\r\nabolished, even if they dated from the reign of Richard I. The House of\r\nCommons must be reformed, root and branch, because it was corrupt and\r\nselfish. Property was essential to the stability of society, and it must be\r\npreserved, whatever advantages it gave to one class over another. Marriage\r\nmust be made dissoluble, because, while divorce was impossible,\r\nindissoluble unions meant misery for many men and women.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to find fallacies in the philosophy of Benthamism. It is untrue\r\nto say that morality consists in the pursuit of pleasure. There are logical\r\nfallacies in the expression \"the greatest happiness of the greatest\r\nnumber.\" Men do not habitually pursue their own interests, and if they are\r\nleft free to pursue them it is not true that each of them will secure the\r\ngreatest happiness for {157} himself. But whatever difficulties reasoners\r\nmay find in the philosophy, there is no question that the practice of the\r\nUtilitarians was of immense value to society. The abstraction at which they\r\naimed was not a mere abstraction. Cartwright wanted liberty as an end in\r\nitself. Bentham wanted happiness, which involved an indefinite number of\r\ntangible benefits. A Benthamite might reason absurdly about \"self-interest\"\r\nand \"happiness,\" but in effect he was seeking to improve conditions of life\r\nand to redress grievances. An assertion that it is the duty of Government\r\nto produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number might confuse a\r\nlogician. To the ordinary Englishman, incapable of deep reasoning, it meant\r\nthat it was his business, whenever he saw an abuse which could be remedied\r\nby legislation, to promote legislation to remove it. Utilitarianism\r\nprovided a working formula for practical philanthropy.\r\n\r\nIts direct influence upon politics was distinctly of a Liberal kind. Every\r\nman was to count for one, and no man for more than one. No man could know\r\nthe interest of another better than the other himself, and each must be\r\nleft free to pursue his own. A restricted franchise and government by a\r\nclass could not stand. Where each man's conduct was directed solely to the\r\npursuit of his own interest this could only mean the abuse of the majority\r\nfor the benefit of the minority. \"Whatsoever evil it is possible for man to\r\ndo for the advancement of his own private and personal interest that evil\r\nsooner or later he will do, unless by some means or other, intentional or\r\notherwise, he be prevented from doing it.... If it be true, according to\r\nthe homely proverb, that the eye of the master makes the ox fat, it is no\r\nless so that the eye of the public makes the statesman virtuous.\"[195] The\r\nargument is, of course, only partly true, and if it were entirely true it\r\nwould be a poor argument for a wide franchise. If every man will, sooner or\r\nlater, subject the public interest to his own, are we likely to be any more\r\nhappy under a democracy than under an oligarchy? If all are corrupt, does\r\nit matter very much whether all or only a few have power? Democratic {158}\r\ngovernment has its peculiar dangers, and it may be corrupted by absolute\r\npower no less than despotism or aristocracy. But it at least diffuses power\r\namong an infinitely greater variety of people, who are less likely to be\r\nanimated by a single interest than a closely knit and homogeneous class.\r\nFor the practical purposes of the time, where the privileges were all in\r\nthe hands of the minority and the deprivations were all suffered by the\r\nimpotent majority, the argument was good enough. It led to universal\r\nsuffrage no less directly than reasoning from the abstract rights of man.\r\nIn practice some of the Benthamites stopped short at a middle-class\r\nfranchise. This class was so large and so varied in character that it might\r\nbe trusted to legislate for the nation as a whole. But the Benthamite\r\nreasoning went beyond this. It involved, as Bentham himself admitted, the\r\nenfranchisement of women. James Mill and many of his friends would not go\r\nso far, and drew from William Thompson, in 1825, his _Appeal of One-Half of\r\nthe Human Race_, which is the second of the great marks in the progress of\r\nEnglish women.\r\n\r\nDisputes about subjects of this sort, which were not yet practically\r\nimportant, did not weaken the general influence of the Utilitarians. Even\r\nwhere their philosophy was rejected, their sustained and general attack\r\nupon abuses produced its effect. They were allied with Tories like\r\nWilberforce in abolishing the Slave Trade. Romilly, Mackintosh, and Peel\r\nreformed the criminal law in the very spirit of Bentham. Sydney Smith,\r\nJeffrey, Macaulay, Brougham, and the other Whigs, who since 1802 had\r\nwritten in the _Edinburgh Review_, habitually spoke with contempt of\r\nUtilitarians. But their practical politics were hardly different from those\r\nof James Mill and George Grote.[196] Restrictions on trade, excessive\r\npunishments for crime, costly and incomprehensible legal procedure,\r\nreligious inequalities, anomalies {159} of the franchise, sinecures, jobs,\r\nall the fetters which hampered the individual in the pursuit of his own\r\ninterest, were attacked by Whigs and Utilitarians together, and with the\r\nirregular assistance of Tories like Peel, the two contrived, between 1820\r\nand 1850, to transform English politics.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Utilitarians was Liberal, so far as it went. Their\r\ninsistence upon the equal value of all individuals led to the removal of\r\nrestrictions upon liberty. No man could know the interest of another.\r\nTherefore every man must be left, as far as possible, to himself. Each must\r\ncontrol his own government. Each must be permitted to hold and to publish\r\nhis own opinions. Trade and manufacture must be left to the unfettered\r\ndiscretion of traders and manufacturers. The Government must stand away\r\nfrom the individual, except when, as for national defence, some central\r\ncontrol was inevitable. This course of reasoning led the Benthamites into\r\nthe neglect of economic problems which was the great blemish of their\r\npractical politics. The economists had arrived at the theory of _laissez\r\nfaire_ by a different route. Both schools now gave a scientific expression\r\nto the old English dislike of Government interference, which the Whigs\r\ncherished as part of their inheritance from the past, and the new middle\r\nclass as the result of their methods of industry. All four groups agreed in\r\nthis claim for individual freedom, and the humanitarian tendencies of\r\nBenthamism were sacrificed to its pedantry. Enterprise was allowed full\r\nplay. Protective duties were reduced and finally abolished. Competition\r\nstimulated and encouraged the production of wealth. But while the masters\r\nprofited, the workpeople suffered.\r\n\r\nThere is a very precise indication of the way in which the political\r\neconomy of the day and the Utilitarian theorizing combined to neglect the\r\npeculiar miseries of the common people, in a speech of Joseph Hume. He was\r\nspeaking against the Framework Knitters' Bill of 1812, which proposed to\r\nfix maximum and minimum rates of wages, and to prohibit the payment of\r\nworkmen otherwise than in cash. Hume declared that the function of the\r\nState in economic matters was \"to protect both {160} masters and workmen,\r\nand allow every individual to exert himself in employing his capital and\r\nlabour in such an honourable manner as he may think best; every one in\r\ngeneral being the best judge of his own abilities how to employ his stock\r\nin trade.... Viewing capitalists and artisans equally as traders, I\r\nconsider an uncontrolled competition as beneficial to both, and the\r\nstrongest spur to ingenuity and industry.... If it should be more\r\nconvenient or profitable for a workman to receive payment for his labour\r\npartly or wholly in goods, why should he be prevented from doing so? For if\r\nsuch a practice is inconvenient or injurious to any man, he will not work a\r\nsecond time for the master who pays him in that manner.\"[197] In the same\r\nspeech Hume declared that he would put masters and men on an equal footing\r\nby the repeal of the Combination Acts, and the Acts were repealed, on\r\nHume's motion, in 1824. This speech and the repeal of the Acts were\r\nBenthamite in essence. But equal treatment by the State was not equality,\r\nand to leave masters and men free to fight out their disputes was not to\r\nmake each count for one and no one for more than one. Of what use was it to\r\ntell a workman that his uncontrolled competition with his fellows was a\r\nspur to his ingenuity and industry, when it meant that a crowd of men,\r\nunder pressure of starvation, undersold each other for a bare subsistence?\r\nOf what use was it to put capitalists and workmen into a comparison as\r\ntraders, when for the one holding out of the market meant merely a\r\ntemporary loss of income, and for the other it meant destitution? Of what\r\nuse was it to say that a workman who was deprived of part of his earnings\r\nby the truck system could refuse to work a second time for the master who\r\npaid him in that manner, when he had perhaps no means of travelling to find\r\nanother, and when in any case there were so many men willing to fill his\r\nplace on any terms that the master had no reason to fear his refusal? For\r\nall its philanthropy, Benthamism did not settle the problem of the\r\nconditions of life among the working classes. Wages, hours of labour,\r\nventilation, sanitary appliances, housing and the planning of towns, were\r\nall {161} left by the Utilitarians to this desperate system of individual\r\nbargaining. On this side their philosophy was as conspicuously deficient as\r\nthat of Cartwright himself. But its results were positive, and it gave to\r\nthe scattered impulses of Liberalism a coherence and a philosophic unity\r\nwhich they had hitherto lacked.\r\n\r\nApart from the new humanitarianism, there were other signs that the old\r\nTory structure was breaking to pieces. Two of its main supports were\r\ndestroyed before the Tory party left office in 1830. The Church of England\r\nwas at last deprived of its political monopoly. Papists, Dissenters, and\r\nJacobins had long enjoyed a common abhorrence, and all the progress which\r\nthe two depreciated religious classes had won before the French Revolution\r\nhad been lost. In 1819 the Tory Government had actually spent L1,000,000,\r\nraised indiscriminately by taxing them as well as Churchmen, on building\r\nnew churches to prevent the spread of their opinions. Ten years later each\r\nhad won a signal victory over its hereditary enemy.\r\n\r\nThe state of Ireland since the Union had been such as to make all lovers of\r\norder and good government despair. A population of 7,000,000 was crowded on\r\nto land which was not extensive enough to support it. One-seventh of the\r\npeople, it was said, lived by begging or robbery.[198] The rest farmed\r\nlittle patches of land for which many of them paid rent at the amazing rate\r\nof ten guineas an acre a year.[199] The average rate of wages was fourpence\r\na day.[200] Squalor and disease were the lot of the majority of the\r\ninhabitants of a rich and fertile land. Their economic distress, which was\r\ndue, at least in part, to the vicious, unsympathetic system of absentee\r\nlandlordism, was aggravated by religious disabilities. Under the Tithe Law\r\na Protestant clergyman was entitled to one-tenth of the produce which a\r\nCatholic farmer could scrape out of his potato-patch. Poverty and ignorance\r\ncombined with religious bitterness to make the {162} government of Ireland\r\nimpossible. In every year since the Union the ordinary law had been\r\nsuspended, and the English ruled Ireland only in the way of foreign\r\nconquerors. In 1822 they governed under the Insurrection Act, which\r\nempowered the Lord-Lieutenant to proclaim a whole county to be in a\r\ndisturbed state, to compel all residents to keep in their houses between\r\nsunset and sunrise, to instruct magistrates to enter houses at night to see\r\nif the inmates were at home. Constitutional government was at an end.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 Plunket, who was a Tory Irishman, introduced a Bill to relieve the\r\nCatholics from their disabilities. It was carried through the Commons by a\r\nmajority which included such rigid Tories as Castlereagh, Wilberforce, and\r\nCroker, as well as Canning and Palmerston and the Whigs. The Lords, led by\r\nLiverpool, Eldon, Wellington, and Sidmouth, threw out the Bill. Canning\r\nintroduced another Bill in 1822, which met the same fate. But a measure of\r\na different kind was passed into law in the same year, and did much to\r\nallay the bitterness, if it did little to improve the economic conditions\r\nof the Irish. This was an Act which extended the Tithe Law to grazing land\r\nas well as to agricultural land, and at the same time enabled the\r\ntithe-owners to accept a money payment instead of a part of the actual\r\nproduce. This relieved the peasantry of the obnoxious liability to hand\r\nover the actual produce of their labour to the representative of an alien\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nThe main grievance remained, and the struggle for complete emancipation now\r\nentered upon its final stage. In 1823 Daniel O'Connell founded the Catholic\r\nAssociation, a gigantic league, which included Catholics of every rank, and\r\nlevied a rent or annual contribution on all its members. In 1825 this had\r\nbecome such a formidable engine that an Act was passed to suppress it. The\r\nlaw was evaded. It was directed against societies formed for political\r\nobjects. The Association was dissolved, and a new Association was formed\r\nostensibly for educational and charitable purposes. The Act suppressed\r\nsocieties which renewed their meetings for more than fourteen days. The new\r\nAssociation sat for {163} fourteen days at a time, and described the\r\nmeetings as \"convened pursuant to Act of Parliament.\" The rent was paid as\r\nbefore, but was stated to be paid \"for the relief of the forty-shilling\r\nfreeholders,\" or \"for all purposes allowable by law.\" The Act, in short,\r\nachieved nothing except to irritate the Catholics, and to show them that\r\nthey could defy the English Government.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, there was nothing for wise Protestants to do but\r\nto give way. A Bill was introduced relieving the Catholics of their\r\npolitical disabilities. It was accompanied by two other Bills, which were\r\nintended to mitigate the dangers of the first. One of these additional\r\nBills, or \"wings,\" was intended to take political power from the poorest,\r\nmost ignorant, and least independent of the peasantry, by disfranchising\r\nthe forty-shilling freeholders. The other was intended to conciliate and\r\nimprove the character of the leaders of opinion, by endowing the Catholic\r\nclergy. The Emancipation Bill passed the Commons by a majority of 21. The\r\nbigotry and stupidity of the Lords had not diminished since 1812, and they\r\nthrew it out by 178 votes to 130. For four years more the Catholic\r\nAssociation remained the dominant force in Irish politics, and every bitter\r\nand violent man in the country had a just ground for denouncing the English\r\nGovernment. The House of Lords made one more attempt to reduce Ireland to\r\nanarchy. Liverpool died in 1827, and was succeeded by Canning as Prime\r\nMinister. This substitution of a friend of the Catholics for an enemy meant\r\nthe beginning of the end. Eldon, Wellington, Peel, and four other Ministers\r\nresigned, some of the Whigs joined the Cabinet, and the English Ministry\r\nwas at last united in a policy of justice and wisdom. But the death of\r\nCanning a few months after he became Premier again shattered the hopes of\r\nLiberalism. The old party came back, with Wellington at their head, pledged\r\nto resist the Catholic claims. Within twelve months they had cut their own\r\nthroats, and a trifling controversy in the Cabinet led not only to Catholic\r\nEmancipation, but to the entire destruction of the Tory system. {164}\r\n\r\nTwo boroughs, Penryn and East Retford, had been disfranchised for bribery\r\nand corruption. The question arose whether their members should be\r\ntransferred to the counties in which they were situated or given to some of\r\nthe large towns like Manchester, Leeds, and Birmingham, which had no\r\nmembers at all. Huskisson, the President of the Board of Trade, took the\r\nLiberal view, and in an important division voted against the Government.\r\nThe letter in which he explained his action was accepted by Wellington as a\r\nresignation. His post was given to Vesey Fitzgerald, the member for Clare,\r\nwho submitted himself for re-election in the ordinary way. To the\r\nconsternation of the Tories, O'Connell himself came forward as a Catholic\r\ncandidate. The Catholic Association and the priests led or drove the voters\r\nto the poll, Fitzgerald was beaten out of the field, and O'Connell,\r\ndisqualified by his religion, but with three-fourths of the Irish people at\r\nhis back, claimed a seat in the House of Commons. The Government had the\r\nchoice of two courses, neither of which promised them any credit. They\r\nmight give way to organized illegality and emancipate the Catholics. They\r\nmight exclude O'Connell and undertake a new civil war in Ireland.\r\nWellington was as good as a soldier as he was bad as a statesman, and he\r\nknew when a position had become untenable. He was now ready to retreat in\r\ngood order. Peel supported him, and the two together controlled the\r\nCabinet. The Relief Bill and the Bill disfranchising the freeholders were\r\nboth law by the end of April, 1829.[201] The endowment of the clergy was\r\nabandoned. Two facts of vital importance were involved in this defeat of\r\nthe Government. The first was that, for the first time in English history,\r\na political association had compelled Parliament against its will to pass a\r\nmeasure into law. The people were beginning to control their Government.\r\nThe second fact was that the Irish had been forced into the belief that\r\npatience and endurance were less likely to succeed in obtaining redress\r\nthan violence and {165} intimidation. The stupid resistance of the House of\r\nLords had planted this idea ineradicably in the Irish mind, and the events\r\nof the next fifty years watered it and made it flourish to excess. The\r\nreaction of these events upon English politics resembled that of the\r\nsuccess of the American Rebellion. The people were no longer at the\r\ndisposition of the governing class. What Ireland had done, England could\r\ndo. All over the country Political Unions for Reform came into existence,\r\nand imitated the success of the Catholic Association. In two years the old\r\nsystem came to an end.\r\n\r\nBefore the final breakdown of the Tory party the Dissenters had won for\r\nthemselves the abolition of their disabilities. On February 26, 1828, Lord\r\nJohn Russell moved for the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts. There\r\nwas nothing new to be said on either side of this controversy. Was or was\r\nnot a Dissenter to count for as much in the State as a Churchman? Two\r\nquotations from the debate will set the two schools of thought in their\r\nplaces. Sir Robert Inglis, a Tory Churchman, said: \"The question whether\r\nany man ought to be eligible to power is a question of pure expediency, not\r\nof justice; and such power may be regulated by sex, by age, by property, or\r\nby opinions, without any wrong to any one's natural claims.\"[202] In other\r\nwords, a disposing class is to decide the social value of another class in\r\nthe interests of any institution with which it is itself associated.\r\nBrougham replied in the language of pure Liberalism: \"Assuming that no\r\npractical grievance exists, is the stigma nothing? Is it nothing that a\r\nDissenter, wherever he goes, is looked on and treated as an inferior person\r\nto a Churchman?... Is it nothing even that the honourable baronet should\r\nsay, as he has said this night, 'We will allow you to do so and so'? What\r\nis it that gives the honourable baronet the title to use this language ...\r\nbut that the law encourages him to use it?\"[203] On this occasion\r\nLiberalism won an unexpected victory. The motion for repeal was carried by\r\n237 votes to 193, and Peel, accepting the decision of the {166} Commons,\r\nwas able, after much labour, to overcome the resistance of the Lords.[204]\r\n\r\nTwo great breaches had thus been made in the edifice of Toryism, and the\r\nLiberal tide was now very high above the point at which it had been left by\r\nthe French War. But events were moving more rapidly outside Parliament than\r\nwithin it. The large provincial towns were still growing larger and their\r\ndemand for representation louder. A financial crisis in 1825 had injured\r\nindustry. Bad harvests in 1829 and 1830 combined with the import duties on\r\ncorn to increase the sufferings of the artisans and labourers. The latter\r\nwere already much demoralized by the administration of the Poor Law, and\r\nthe riots and disturbances in agricultural districts and factory towns\r\nalike were more serious than they had ever been. The demand for Reform was\r\nrenewed with great vigour, and this time with success. The details of the\r\nfinal struggle are not important for this work. Several circumstances\r\ncombined with the economic condition of the people to make agitation\r\neffective. Continental Liberalism won two great victories in 1830. Belgium\r\nshook off the yoke of Holland, and Charles X of France, expelled by a new\r\nrevolution, took refuge in England. Both these events gave encouragement to\r\nEnglish reformers. At the same time the Parliamentary Whigs, who had never\r\nbefore recovered the cohesion which they lost in 1793, were united under\r\nthe leadership of Lord Althorp in the Commons and Lord Grey in the Lords.\r\nThe Tories, on the other hand, were broken up by the surrender to the\r\nDissenters and the Catholics. The Whigs, with a few exceptions like Lord\r\nDurham and Lord John Russell, had no liking for drastic changes. But the\r\npressure in the country was too strong. A motion on some trivial matter\r\nconnected with the Civil List overthrew the Ministry. The Whigs came in\r\nunder Lord Grey, and introduced a Reform Bill which made a clean sweep of\r\nthe {167} rotten boroughs, gave seats to all the large provincial towns,\r\nand enfranchised every townsman who occupied a house worth L10 a year. A\r\ndefeat in Committee produced a dissolution and a great Whig victory at the\r\npolls. The Lords, indifferent alike to the trend of history and to the\r\nstate of contemporary opinion, threw out a second Bill. A great clamour\r\nbroke out all over the country, and at Bristol, Nottingham, and other\r\nplaces the scum of the populace destroyed an enormous amount of public and\r\nprivate property in riots. A third Bill was introduced in 1832, Wellington\r\nagain led his forces in retreat, and the Bill received Royal Assent on the\r\n7th June, 1832. The people were at last the masters in their own house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{168}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE-CLASS SUPREMACY\r\n\r\nThe significance of the victory of 1832 was immense. It broke up and\r\nreconstructed the whole of the machinery by which the old Toryism had\r\nmanaged the people, and it involved the first great revision of social\r\nvalues which had taken place in England. It was perhaps more important as a\r\nprecedent for future changes than for what it was in itself. It was very\r\nfar from implying the triumph of Revolutionary principles, though the\r\nspread of Revolutionary principles had alone made it possible. The Whigs\r\nthemselves remained aristocratic and territorial, and they still dominated\r\npolitics. The small group of commercial and manufacturing Members of\r\nParliament was considerably increased by the enfranchisement of the new\r\ntowns. But members continued for another generation to be chosen for the\r\nmost part from the nobility and gentry, and only their constituents and the\r\ntone of their policy were changed. Very few members and only a small\r\nproportion of the newly enfranchised class had any belief in the equal\r\nworth of individuals in the State. The revision of values extended no\r\nfarther than the middle class. Capital was appreciated in relation to land.\r\nLabour was still depreciated in relation to both. An end was put \"to all\r\nthe advantages which particular forms of property possess over other\r\nforms,\"[205] but property as a whole was still supreme. The Reform Act was\r\nintended to enfranchise \"the middle class of England, with the flower of\r\nthe aristocracy at its head, and the flower of the working classes {169}\r\nbringing up its rear.\"[206] From their new elevation these looked down upon\r\nthe mass of wage-earners as the old Tories had looked down upon them. \"I\r\nwould withhold from them,\" said Macaulay, \"nothing which it might be for\r\ntheir good to possess.... If I would refuse to the working people that\r\nlarger share of power which some of them have demanded, I would refuse it\r\nbecause I am convinced that, by giving it, I should only increase their\r\ndistress. I admit that the end of government is their happiness. But that\r\nthey may be governed for their happiness, they must not be governed\r\naccording to the doctrines which they have learned from their illiterate,\r\nincapable, low-minded flatterers.\"[207] In just such language had Pitt\r\nreferred to the working class and the Corresponding Society. Just as the\r\nold Tories had held that the landed gentry were the natural leaders of the\r\nnation, so the new Whigs paid the same tribute to the upper and middle\r\nclasses combined. \"The higher and middling orders are the natural\r\nrepresentatives of the human race.\"[208] The disposing habit had come down\r\na step. But it remained the disposing habit.\r\n\r\nThe new governing class had that dislike of forms and liking of individual\r\nliberty to which reference has been made. The Parliamentary Whigs, no less\r\nthan the manufacturers, were imbued with the same spirit. The natural bias\r\nof their party had always been in that direction. They had abolished\r\nslavery, had emancipated Dissenters and Catholics, had defended free speech\r\nduring the reaction, and had finally substituted the control of the middle\r\nclass of the common people for that of the aristocracy and the landed\r\ninterest. In recent years they had been infected with the temper, even\r\nwhile they despised the philosophizing, of the Benthamites. In one respect\r\nthey lagged behind the Philosophic Radicals. They were landed proprietors,\r\nand their adoption of Free Trade was slow and reluctant. It was as\r\nunnatural for them to lower the price of their tenants' corn as it {170}\r\nwas for the manufacturers to reduce the hours of their men's labour. But\r\ntheir general tendency to restrict the action of Government was as marked\r\nas that of the avowed Utilitarians. They constantly, as in the reference to\r\n\"happiness\" already quoted, used the very language of the creed. The\r\nfollowing words of Macaulay might have been spoken by Grote or Roebuck.\r\n\"The business of Government is not directly to make the people rich, but to\r\nprotect them in making themselves rich.... We can give them only freedom to\r\nemploy their industry to the best advantage, and security in the enjoyment\r\nof what their industry has acquired. These advantages it is our duty to\r\ngive at the smallest possible cost. The diligence and forethought of\r\nindividuals will thus have fair play; and it is only by the diligence and\r\nforethought of individuals that the community can become prosperous.\" The\r\nReform Bill would thus indirectly conduce to the national prosperity. \"It\r\nwill secure to us a House of Commons which, by preserving peace, by\r\ndestroying monopolies, by taking away unnecessary public burdens, by\r\njudiciously distributing necessary public burdens, will, in the progress of\r\ntime, greatly improve our condition.\"[209]\r\n\r\n\"Reform,\" said Sydney Smith, \"will produce economy and investigation; there\r\nwill be fewer jobs and a less lavish expenditure; wars will not be\r\npersevered in for years after the people are tired of them; taxes will be\r\ntaken off the poor and laid upon the rich;... cruel and oppressive\r\npunishments (such as those for night poaching) will be abolished. If you\r\nsteal a pheasant you will be punished as you ought to be, but not sent away\r\nfrom your wife and children for seven years. Tobacco will be 2d. per lb.\r\ncheaper. Candles will fall in price ... if peace, economy, and justice are\r\nthe results of Reform, a number of small benefits ... will accrue to\r\nmillions of the people; and the connection between the existence of Lord\r\nJohn Russell and the reduced price of bread and cheese will be as clear as\r\nit has been the object of his honest, wise, and useful life to make\r\nit.\"[210]\r\n\r\n{171}\r\n\r\nThere was therefore very little disposition among the Whigs to undertake\r\neconomic reforms. \"We can no more prevent time,\" said Macaulay, \"from\r\nchanging the distribution of property and intelligence, we can no more\r\nprevent property and intelligence from aspiring to political power, than we\r\ncan change the courses of the seasons and of the tides.\"[211] But in the\r\nimmediate present they would decline to change the distribution of property\r\nas firmly as to change that of political power. The two things in fact went\r\ntogether. Society was based on property; universal suffrage meant the\r\nconfiscation of property. Therefore the franchise must be limited to the\r\nowners of property. \"My firm conviction,\" said the same typical Whig, \"is\r\nthat, in our country, universal suffrage is incompatible, not with this or\r\nthat form of government, but with all forms of government, and with\r\neverything for the sake of which forms of government exist; that it is\r\nincompatible with property, and that it is incompatible with\r\ncivilization.\"[212]\r\n\r\nThis refusal to undertake anything in the nature of graduated taxation or\r\nsocial reform was accompanied by a dislike of the organizations by which\r\nthe working people endeavoured to help themselves. After the repeal of the\r\nCombination Acts in 1824 the number of Trade Unions had greatly increased.\r\nThe methods of these associations were often of a violent and dangerous\r\ncharacter. Any unusual poverty will produce disorder, even among men of\r\ngood understanding. The effect on men of poor education is much worse. The\r\nnew-found power of combining was thus often abused, intimidation and\r\nassault were common, and even murder was not unknown. To the Whigs, as to\r\nthe philosophic Radicals, the whole system of Trade Unionism was nothing\r\nbut tyranny and oppression. They failed to see the necessity for\r\ncombination. They assumed that nothing could increase wages but an increase\r\nof production, and consequently that so long as the total earnings of a\r\ntrade remained fixed a Trade Union could produce no result except a bad\r\n{172} temper. They ignored the possibility that the master's profits and\r\nthe landlord's rent might both be reduced without injury to the industry as\r\na whole. In all this the Utilitarians agreed with them. But theorists like\r\nHume and Roebuck were compelled logically to admit that if a man was to be\r\nfree to pursue his own interest, he was to be free to combine with others.\r\nA Trade Union was thus not offensive to a Radical except when it abused its\r\nrights and acted oppressively. The Whigs had a much stronger objection. A\r\nUnion to them was obnoxious in itself, probably because it had a social and\r\npolitical, as well as an industrial complexion. The Radical employer at\r\nleast understood his men. The Whig landowner probably did not. Brougham\r\ndescribed the Union leaders as \"idle, good for nothing agitators,\" and\r\ndeclared that \"the worst enemies of the trades themselves, the most\r\npernicious counsellors that they possibly could have, were those who had\r\nadvised them to adopt the line of conduct which they had followed since the\r\nrepeal of the Combination laws.\"[213] Palmerston referred constantly in his\r\ncorrespondence to the rise of Trade Unions as a danger to the State.[214]\r\nThis is the style in which modern Tories spoke during the miners' strike of\r\n1912. The grievances were ignored or not understood, and the attempts at\r\nself-help were treated only as evidence of a malicious and dangerous\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThis temper led the Government into one gross abuse of power. In 1834 an\r\nAgricultural Labourers' Union was formed in Dorsetshire. Some foolish\r\nperson thought it necessary to bind the members by an oath. One of the\r\nStatutes of the Revolution period had made it illegal to administer an oath\r\nto a member of any association. The Act had been passed in consequence of\r\nthe mutiny at the Nore and the activities of societies like the {173}\r\nUnited Irishmen, which were avowedly criminal. It had not been intended to\r\napply, and it had practically never been applied to any other kind of\r\nsociety. It was suddenly revived in the case of the Dorsetshire labourers.\r\nSix of them were tried at Dorchester, found guilty, and sentenced to seven\r\nyears' transportation. The ferocity of the sentence was surpassed by the\r\nindecent haste with which the Government hurried the wretched men out of\r\nthe country. They proceeded exactly as the Tories had proceeded in the\r\ncases of Muir and Palmer. The prisoners were put on board a convict ship,\r\nwhich set sail before the matter could be discussed in Parliament. To the\r\nworking man new Whig was but old Tory spelt differently. But on this\r\noccasion popular opinion was against the Government. The men were ignorant,\r\nbut honest. Two of them were Methodist preachers. None of them was, in any\r\nreal sense of the word, criminal, and the whole country was roused in their\r\nbehalf. Petitions poured in from towns of every sort, from Oxford,\r\nCheltenham, Leeds, Newcastle, and Dundee. Hume, Roebuck, and O'Connell\r\nspoke in the House of Commons. Twenty thousand workmen, headed by Robert\r\nOwen, marched on one occasion to Whitehall, and Melbourne was compelled to\r\nreceive a deputation. Humanity and reason at last had their way, but it was\r\ntwo years before the prisoners received a pardon, and longer before they\r\nhad all returned home. In this episode the country showed itself more\r\nLiberal than the Government, and the Whigs were sharply reminded that the\r\nReform Act had changed their own situation no less than that of the Tories.\r\n\r\nThe case of the Dorchester labourers is sufficient proof that the Whigs had\r\nlittle understanding of the working classes and little sympathy with their\r\npoint of view. The agitation for the people's charter, manhood suffrage,\r\nannual Parliaments, vote by ballot, and the rest, never made any impression\r\nupon Parliament. The Chartists were sent to prison when they broke the law,\r\ntheir meetings were sometimes dispersed by force, and they were sometimes\r\nshot dead in the course of riots. For several years after the Reform Act\r\nthe Whig Government was engaged in {174} watching and suppressing political\r\nagitation almost as regularly as the Tories before it. But more than one\r\nimportant economic reform was carried through Parliament about the same\r\ntime, and conferred considerable benefits upon the common people. One was\r\nthe Act of 1834, which reconstructed the Poor Law system. This was purely\r\nBenthamite, and the Report of Royal Commissioners, upon which it was based,\r\nwas drafted by the Utilitarian, Nassau Senior. The new Poor Law combined\r\nthe thorough, scientific, mechanical principles of the theory of utility\r\nwith the characteristic Benthamite avoidance of restrictions on liberty.\r\nThe old system had been promiscuous and charitable. Relief had been granted\r\nin many quarters promiscuously, and without regard to indirect\r\nconsequences. Wages had been kept down, bastardy had been encouraged, no\r\ntests had been required to show that the applicants were really distressed.\r\nRates had in consequence increased enormously, and in one parish had\r\nreached such a height that the whole economic system had broken down, and\r\nindustry had actually ceased. There were some remarkable exceptions,[215]\r\nbut the general state of the country was slovenly. The reform was of the\r\nmost drastic character. A central body of commissioners was appointed to\r\nintroduce uniformity. Small parishes were united to form efficient units of\r\nadministration. Relief was to be granted by elected Boards of Guardians,\r\nand not by inexperienced justices of the peace. But for the purposes of\r\nthis book the most important changes were in the system rather than in the\r\nmachinery. Every applicant for relief must pass a test. He was offered\r\nrelief, but only coupled with the workhouse, where he must make some return\r\nin labour for what he received. The workhouse must be of such an\r\nunattractive character that none but those who were in actual want would\r\nenter it. In short, the poor man must be forced, by this sufficient\r\ndeterrent, to rely upon his individual strength and skill. The new system\r\nmet with great apparent success, and much of the success was real. It\r\nunquestionably stopped the demoralization of the labourers, and rates {175}\r\nwere everywhere reduced. The failure was of the sort which was inevitably\r\nincident to Benthamism. The law checked pauperism, but it did not abolish\r\npoverty. It prevented the abuse of public assistance, but it did not deal\r\nwith those causes of poverty which did not depend on the motives of the\r\npoor themselves. The idler was driven by the workhouse into work. The\r\nhonest man who was made destitute by the bad organization of casual labour,\r\nby the periodic fluctuations of trade, by the introduction of machinery, or\r\nby the bankruptcy of his employer, could only be driven into the street.\r\nWhere independence depended upon the will of the man himself the unpleasant\r\nnature of poor relief was beneficial. Where it depended upon causes beyond\r\nhis control it was actually harmful. The Utilitarian dislike of positive\r\nattempts to improve conditions of life and labour thus left their work\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\nA second economic reform was the Factory legislation of 1831 and 1833. The\r\nobject of the Acts, which, owing to inadequate inspection, was only\r\npartially attained, was to restrict the hours of labour of children and\r\nyoung persons. Peel's Act of 1825 had prohibited the employment of children\r\nunder sixteen for more than twelve hours of actual work a day, and it\r\napplied only to cotton mills. The Act of 1833 prohibited all night work in\r\nall textile mills, prohibited the employment of children under nine except\r\nin silk mills, imposed a limit of forty-eight hours a week on children up\r\nto thirteen, and a limit of sixty-nine hours on young persons up to\r\neighteen. It also provided for a system of inspection, which unfortunately\r\nproved insufficient. This was the first important example of a general\r\nState interference in economic conditions, and the campaign for its\r\nimprovement and extension divided all parties.\r\n\r\nThe true line of Liberal action was undoubtedly in the direction of\r\nrestricting the liberty of the individual to exploit those who were unable\r\nto protect themselves. But such a course was contrary to the general\r\nindividualistic current of the time, and a large section of the Whig party\r\nwas persistently and bitterly hostile. The best of them eventually came to\r\nthe same conclusions as {176} Macaulay. \"I hardly know which is the greater\r\npest to society, a paternal Government, that is to say, a prying,\r\nmeddlesome Government which intrudes itself into every part of human life,\r\nand which thinks that it can do everything for everybody better than\r\nanybody can do anything for himself; or a careless, lounging Government\r\nwhich suffers grievances, such as it could at once remove, to grow and\r\nmultiply, and which to all complaint and remonstrance has only one answer:\r\n'We must let things alone; we must let things find their level.'... I hold\r\nthat, where public health is concerned, and where public morality is\r\nconcerned, the State may be justified in regulating even the contracts of\r\nadults.... Never will I believe that what makes a population stronger, and\r\nhealthier, and wiser, and better, can ultimately make it poorer.\"[216] But\r\nthere were few of the Whigs who held these wise opinions immediately after\r\ntheir triumph in 1831, and even Macaulay in 1832 defeated a Tory candidate\r\nwhose views on Factory legislation were at that time far sounder than his\r\nown. Those Whigs who belonged to the middle class were generally hostile to\r\nthe whole movement. Cobden, not yet in Parliament, would have prohibited\r\nall employment of children under the age of thirteen.[217] But Brougham,\r\nHarriet Martineau, and the type of business man which was best represented\r\nby John Bright, were bitter opponents of reform. The utmost which could be\r\ngot from the middle-class Parliaments which followed the Reform Act was a\r\nrestriction of the work of children. The protection of adults, even by the\r\nregulation of machinery, ventilation, and temperature, was always repugnant\r\nto their stubborn belief in the power and the duty of the individual to\r\nwork out his own salvation.\r\n\r\nThe real impulse to Factory legislation came from two different quarters.\r\nThe first was Tory philanthropy. The second was the industrial democracy\r\nwhich had worked for Parliamentary Reform, and had been left out of the Act\r\nof 1832. These last acted obviously from interested motives. Their own\r\nhealth and {177} happiness were at stake, and their campaign on behalf of\r\nthe children was only part of a general campaign for shorter hours and\r\nbetter conditions of labour. The Tory Evangelicals acted as Tory theorists.\r\nRobert Southey, Richard Oastler, Michael Sadler, whom Macaulay beat at\r\nLeeds in 1832, and Lord Shaftesbury, who succeeded Oastler as the\r\nParliamentary leader of the movement, were Tories of a pronounced type. But\r\nthey were philanthropists, they had no personal interest as manufacturers,\r\nand their Toryism left them logically free to employ the power of the State\r\non behalf of their philanthropy. Their general readiness to dispose of the\r\naffairs of others was in this case wholly beneficial. Shaftesbury hated\r\nCatholic Emancipation, Free Trade, life peerages, the higher criticism, the\r\nOxford movement, everything which during his lifetime tended to free the\r\nindividual from the control of selfish interests and monopolies. But as he\r\nrefused to allow a Catholic or a Tractarian religious freedom, or the\r\ncommon people political freedom, so he refused to allow a cotton-spinner\r\neconomic freedom. To his narrow mind, no less than to his large heart, the\r\nlegal protection of working people against economic tyranny is due. It must\r\nnot be supposed that he found more favour with the ordinary Tory than with\r\nthe ordinary Whig or Benthamite. It was only where philosophic Toryism was\r\ncombined with the philanthropic instincts of Evangelical Christianity that\r\nthere was any marked superiority in one party over another. Shaftesbury had\r\nto fight every step of his way, and he encountered indifference, if not\r\nopposition, wherever he turned.[218]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApart from this lamentable neglect of economic reforms the Whigs of the\r\nReform Bill made valuable contributions to the work of Liberalism.\r\nSomething was done to abolish the cumbrous devices which made legal\r\nprocedure unintelligible and costly, and the method of conveying land was\r\nsimplified and {178} cheapened.[219] A Bill to establish local courts for\r\nthe recovery of small debts was introduced by Brougham, but abandoned. The\r\nreform of Parliament was followed by the reform of municipal corporations.\r\nThe old close corporations were of the same type as the old close House of\r\nCommons. All were founded on monopoly, most were corrupt, and hardly any\r\nwere responsible to the ratepayers whose affairs they administered. By an\r\nAct of 1835 the old system was destroyed, and the control of local\r\ngovernment in towns was vested in bodies elected by the ratepayers.[220]\r\nThe representative principle was thus asserted in local as in national\r\naffairs. The domination of the landed interest was further reduced. The old\r\nGame Laws had made the killing of game the exclusive privilege of\r\nlandowners. No one else could kill game legally, and the law, sparing\r\noffenders of higher rank, was ruthlessly enforced by landowning magistrates\r\nagainst the poor. Between 1827 and 1830 more than 8,000 persons had been\r\nsentenced, some of them to transportation for life, for offences against\r\nthis law. In 1831, before the passing of the Reform Bill, the Whigs altered\r\nthe savage and partial Game Laws by permitting any one to kill game who\r\nobtained a licence from the Inland Revenue authorities.[221] After the\r\nelection of the first reformed Parliament, a second attack on land was\r\nmade. In 1807 the land of traders only had been made liable to the payment\r\nof his simple contract debts. Romilly had in vain attempted to {179} make\r\nthis provision impartial. But in 1833 the liability was extended to all\r\nclasses, and the country gentleman was no longer allowed to evade the\r\nobligations which were imposed by law upon his social rivals.[222]\r\n\r\nIn the same year slavery was abolished in the West Indies. The trade had\r\nbeen stopped in 1807. But it was still legal for the planters to own\r\nslaves, though they could no longer import them. In 1821 Wilberforce had\r\nsolemnly confided the leadership of his cause to Thomas Fowell Buxton.\r\nMackintosh, Brougham, and Lushington had supported him steadily in the\r\nCommons, and they had always had the help of Canning. But the planters had\r\nsucceeded, partly by threats of secession, partly by promises of amendment,\r\nin maintaining their abominable system. The decline of the West Indian\r\ntrade since the peace had reduced their influence, and Parliament, free\r\nfrom unrest at home, could turn its attention more easily to the Colonies.\r\nThe planters were presented with twenty millions of public money. The\r\nslaves were to be treated as apprentices for seven years and afterwards\r\nwere to be free labourers. Thus the last trace of acknowledged slavery was\r\nremoved from the British Empire. It is melancholy to reflect that the men\r\nwho expended so much honest sympathy and indignation over slavery in the\r\nWest Indies should have so carefully refrained from using it to abolish the\r\nslavery which oppressed their fellow-countrymen. Slavery is not always a\r\nmatter of buying and selling, of chaining and whipping; and in the sweated\r\nlabour and prostitution which were rife in England there were things no\r\nless horrible than the worst barbarities of the colonial planters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Liberal reform no less important than the Factory Act was the\r\nestablishment of a State department of education. In 1833 Radicals like\r\nRoebuck and Grote and Whigs like Brougham persuaded Parliament to grant\r\nL20,000 to supplement the private donations which were being administered\r\nby the different societies for education. Whitbread had introduced a Bill\r\nto establish schools in all poor parishes in 1807. Brougham had obtained\r\n{180} returns showing the existing provision for popular education in 1818.\r\nBut nothing was done by the State to remedy the deficiencies of private\r\nenterprise until 1833, and even what was done then was so unscientific\r\nthat, the private societies being all Protestant, Roman Catholic children\r\ngot no benefit from it at all. After further efforts by Brougham and other\r\nenthusiasts, the Government in 1839 proposed to appoint a committee of the\r\nPrivy Council as a central education authority. A training school for\r\nteachers was to be established under its supervision, and the State grant\r\nwas to be increased to L30,000.\r\n\r\nThese proposals were slight enough in themselves. But they produced one of\r\nthose ugly conflicts which are inevitable in English politics so long as\r\none religious sect holds a privileged position. Some of the clergy of the\r\nEstablished Church claimed the control of all popular education, religious\r\nand secular. The more responsible claimed to control the religious\r\neducation only. The Archbishop of Canterbury used language which was none\r\nthe less insolent because it fell from the lips of an amiable and\r\nbenevolent man. \"The moral and religious instruction of the great mass of\r\nthe people of this country was a subject peculiarly belonging to the clergy\r\nof the Established Church.... In the distribution of the public money for\r\nthe encouragement of religion, their first object ought to be to maintain\r\nand extend the religion of the State.\"[223] \"The State,\" said the Bishop of\r\nLondon, \"has established a great National Church, a great instrument of\r\neducation, which ought to conduct the whole process as far as religion is\r\nconcerned. The Church is the only recognized medium of communicating\r\nreligious knowledge to the people at large; and where there is an\r\nEstablished Church the Legislature ought to embrace every fit opportunity\r\nof maintaining and extending the just influence of the clergy, due regard\r\nbeing had to complete toleration.\"[224] In other words, these ecclesiastics\r\nregarded it as perfectly fair that money should be taken from Dissenters to\r\npay for the teaching of doctrines of which they disapproved, while none was\r\nexpended on the teaching of doctrines of which they {181} did approve. They\r\nwere answered firmly by Ministers, more bitterly and more effectively by\r\nBrougham. \"In what does the tolerance consist?\" asked Brougham. \"Is it in\r\npermitting the Dissenting children to be instructed in those schools in\r\nwhich the Church doctrines alone are taught?\"[225] The meaning of religious\r\nliberty was extended. \"Men who value religious liberty do not, in these\r\ndays, dread anything that can be called persecution, but they do dread\r\nprivileges and oppressive exclusions, preferences to one sect over\r\nanother;... they are resolved never to pay to man any tax to support\r\neducation, if the fruit of the tax does not go to maintain education to\r\nwhich all shall have an equal access.\"[226] The issue was thus again joined\r\nbetween those who would dispose of the consciences of others and those who\r\nwould allow every man an equal right with every other for the propagation\r\nof his own opinions.\r\n\r\nOn this point the Whigs were successful. Their proposals for distribution\r\nbetween the sects were in the direct line of their removal of ancient\r\npolitical disabilities, and they stood their ground. One concession was\r\nmade. The inspectors of schools were to present their reports to the Bishop\r\nof the diocese as well as to the Committee of Council. But after several\r\nclose divisions in the Commons and several defeats in the Lords the scheme\r\nwas established. It must not be supposed that the majority of the Whigs\r\nsupported these novel proposals in a very Liberal spirit. Brougham was\r\npassionately Liberal. The Radicals made State education part of their\r\npractical philosophy of equality. To men of this type education was a means\r\nof increasing the individual's power to develop and express himself. But to\r\nvery many of the supporters of Government the measure was rather a measure\r\nof police than of emancipation. Ignorance meant discontent and danger to\r\nsociety and property. In answering the Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord\r\nLansdowne said: \"In the 80,000 uninstructed children now growing out of\r\ninfancy your Lordships may see the rising Chartists of the next age.\"[227]\r\nEight years later Macaulay {182} declared that \"It is the duty of\r\nGovernment to protect our persons and our property from danger. The gross\r\nignorance of the common people is a principal cause of danger to our\r\npersons and property. Therefore it is the duty of the Government to take\r\ncare that the common people shall not be grossly ignorant.\"[228] This is\r\nmore in the temper of Wilberforce than in that of Tom Paine. But whatever\r\ntheir motives, the services of the Whigs were great. Their grant was\r\nabsurdly inadequate. But they had at least begun to enable the common\r\npeople to think for themselves, and if they had not prevented the disputes\r\nof sects, they had at least secured that no sect should have an artificial\r\nadvantage over another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great Whig administration went out of office in 1841. Their foreign\r\npolicy was the policy of Palmerston, and is perhaps best treated in\r\nconnection with his conduct of affairs after 1846, when his party returned\r\nto power for an almost continuous period of twenty years. Lord Grey retired\r\nin 1834, and was succeeded by Lord Melbourne, an easy gentleman, whose only\r\nclaim to the gratitude of posterity was his careful training of the young\r\nQueen Victoria. Under his guidance the country was little troubled by\r\nlegislation, and the closing years of the Ministry were marked by no\r\nimportant domestic achievement. But the establishment of a new Constitution\r\nin Canada marked the beginning of a new and Liberal colonial policy. This\r\nwas the work of Lord Durham, who had outrun all his colleagues at the time\r\nof the Reform Bill, and earned for himself the name of \"Radical Jack.\" He\r\nreceived little support from the Home Government during his service in\r\nCanada, and all the credit which it deserves is his alone.[229]\r\n\r\nSince the loss of the American Colonies, Canada was the only considerable\r\ncolony of white men which England possessed. Australia and New Zealand were\r\ncomparatively recent {183} discoveries, and South Africa, captured from the\r\nDutch during the great war, was only sparsely populated. Canada represented\r\na civilization of an older type, and a large portion of its inhabitants was\r\nFrench. In 1791 a Constitution had created two Provinces, Upper and Lower\r\nCanada, which corresponded roughly with the distribution of the two\r\nnationalities. The arrangement was satisfactory to nobody. Upper Canada was\r\ndominated by an oligarchy which monopolized public offices, and had\r\nacquired the bulk of the public land for its own use. The Governor and his\r\nExecutive Council habitually rejected the advice of his elected\r\nLegislature, and the Province was in practice governed by officials. In\r\nLower Canada the elected House was chiefly French, and the Governor,\r\npacking the Upper House with English, managed his Province much as England\r\nhad managed Ireland. The real Government of both Provinces was in fact the\r\nColonial Office. Parliament generally was indifferent. Many of the\r\nRadicals, following Bentham, accepted in full the theory that local affairs\r\nmust be controlled by local representative assemblies. But they pushed\r\ntheir theory to logical conclusions, and, believing that the complete\r\nindependence of the Provinces must come, sooner or later, were little\r\ninclined to administer the affairs of territories which were only costly\r\nburdens upon the British taxpayer. The Whigs, misreading the lesson of the\r\nAmerican Rebellion, saw no alternatives but this complete independence and\r\nthe present difficult and irritating subjection. In this atmosphere the\r\nofficials had their own way. Bickerings about domestic affairs continued\r\nfrom 1810 to 1837. The Lower Province wanted an elected Upper House and\r\npower to dispose of the Crown Lands. The Upper Province wanted\r\nresponsibility of Ministers and no oligarchy. Commissioners were sent to\r\nCanada in 1836 to inquire into complaints, and at once came to grief. In\r\nMarch, 1837, the English House of Commons, in spite of Radical opposition,\r\nresolved that it was inexpedient to make the Upper House of Lower Canada\r\nelective. In August the Assembly of the Province was dissolved, and rioting\r\nbegan. Troops were called in, and Canadians were {184} killed. In May,\r\n1838, Durham arrived at Quebec on an errand of pacification. Some of his\r\nacts were arbitrary, and he was at last forced to resign by a torrent of\r\nabuse, which the Home Government did nothing to avert. But his policy was\r\nin effect adopted, and his _Report_ contains the statement of the\r\nprinciples which have ever since been the foundation of our colonial\r\nsystem.[230]\r\n\r\nThe reforms were not until a later date completed by the consolidation of\r\nthe two Provinces, which directed the energies of the two races into the\r\nmanagement of their common affairs, and so ended the discord which had\r\nnearly ruined Lower Canada. But both Provinces were separately endowed with\r\nresponsible government. Full control was given over revenue, Ministers were\r\nmade responsible to the Legislature, and the nominated Houses were\r\nabolished. \"Hitherto,\" said Durham, \"the course of policy adopted by the\r\nEnglish Government towards the colony has had reference to the state of\r\nparties in England, instead of the wants and circumstances of the\r\nProvince.\" In future, other principles were to prevail, and the first step\r\nwas to equip the colony with the machinery for managing its own business.\r\n\"I do not anticipate that a Colonial Legislature, thus strong and thus\r\nself-governing, would desire to abandon the connection with great Britain.\r\nOn the contrary, I believe that the practical relief from undue\r\ninterference, which would be the result of such a change, would strengthen\r\nthe present bond of feelings and interests; and that the connection would\r\nonly become more durable and advantageous, by having more of equality, of\r\nfreedom, and of local independence. But at any rate, our first duty is to\r\nsecure the well-being of our colonial countrymen; and if in the hidden\r\ndecrees of that wisdom by which this world is ruled, it is written that\r\nthese countries are not for ever to remain portions of the Empire, we owe\r\nit to our honour to take good care that, when they separate from us, they\r\nshould not be the only countries on the American continent in which the\r\nAnglo-Saxon race shall be found unfit to govern itself.\r\n\r\n\"I am, in truth, so far from believing that the increased power {185} and\r\nweight that would be given to these Colonies by union would endanger their\r\nconnection with the Empire, that I look to it as the only means of\r\nfostering such a national feeling throughout them as would effectually\r\ncounterbalance whatever tendencies may now exist towards separation. No\r\nlarge community of free and intelligent men will long feel contented with a\r\npolitical system which places them, because it places their country, in a\r\nposition of inferiority to their neighbours.\" The object of the reforms was\r\nto give as much freedom to the colonists as was compatible with the\r\nsovereignty of the Crown. They would then lose two temptations to\r\nrebellion; the interference of foreign officials in the disputes of their\r\nown parties, and the contrast which the liberty of Americans as well as of\r\nEnglish presented to their own condition. Some points were left open, and\r\nwere not settled until a later date. But Parliament had at last been\r\nbrought to recognize that \"Englishmen abroad are the same animals as\r\nEnglishmen at home--energetic, self-relying, capable of managing their own\r\naffairs, impatient of needless and domineering interference.\"[231] The\r\negoistic habit had received a decisive check.\r\n\r\nThe total contribution of the Whigs to Liberalism was very large. They had\r\ndeclared that government, national and local, was to be no longer the\r\nbusiness of a class, but the interest of the people as a whole; that no\r\nform of religious opinion was to be appreciated at the expense of another;\r\nthat no man should be allowed to have property in the body of another; that\r\nland should not be privileged against goods in relation to legal debts, and\r\nthat landowners should not be privileged against landless men in relation\r\nto the killing of game; that employers and parents should not be allowed to\r\ndispose of the health and happiness of children; that the English people\r\nshould not be permitted to regulate the domestic concerns of one of their\r\ncolonies. Much remained to be done. The middle class was admitted to\r\npolitical power, but the working class was not. Catholics and Dissenters\r\nwere no longer practically disabled by the Church, but both were still\r\ndepreciated by the establishment of the rival sect, and the Jew {186} was\r\nstill excluded from Parliament and office by the Christian. Land was still\r\nprivileged by the Corn Law as against industry, and particular industries\r\nas against the public by the protective tariff. The poor working man was\r\nstill liable to be abused by his wealthy employer. If the Colonies were\r\nemancipated, Ireland was not. The condition of women had not been improved,\r\nor even considered. Some of these reforms were simply applications of old\r\nWhig theories about the responsibility of Government to the people and the\r\ntoleration of heterodox opinions. A Whig of 1688 would have understood the\r\nideas which lay beneath the Reform Act, the Canadian Constitution, the\r\nrepeal of the Test Act, and Catholic Emancipation, even if he had disliked\r\nthe particular expression of them. Other reforms were novel not only in\r\nthemselves, but also as implying a new attitude of mind, a new conception\r\nof the relations between the State and society. The education scheme and\r\nthe Factory Act meant that men were ceasing to look upon the State as\r\nsomething external to the people, a thing which was contrived simply to\r\nprotect individual human beings from being injured either by foreign\r\ninvaders or by domestic law-breakers. They were beginning to look upon it\r\nas an engine which might be put to positive as well as to negative use,\r\nwhich might be employed to strike off fetters as well as to prevent their\r\nimposition, which might be consciously directed towards improving a man's\r\nnatural capacity as well as towards allowing it free play. It was a long\r\ntime before these ideas received much fuller expression. Political power\r\nremained in the hands of classes who required little assistance of this\r\nsort for themselves, and were incapable of seeing how urgently it was\r\nneeded by others. Until the Reform Act of 1867 had transferred power to the\r\nworking classes the new conception of the State was only rarely and\r\nunsystematically expressed in legislation. In the meantime the landed\r\ngentry and the manufacturers exaggerated rather than diminished the old\r\nidea of individualism, and neglected or resisted every proposal which\r\ntended to restrict competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the Tories under Peel came into office. The Toryism {187} of this\r\nshort administration was very different from that of Pitt, of Castlereagh,\r\nand of Liverpool. The Prime Minister was not in the least aggressive in\r\nforeign policy, and was far more Liberal in abstaining from interference\r\nwith other nations than was a Whig like Palmerston. At home he was\r\ninfluenced by the spirit, if not by the direct teaching of Bentham, and the\r\nPeelite school of Ministers was a group which for efficiency and economy\r\nhas never been surpassed in England. Peel's most conspicuous virtue was\r\nperhaps his incapacity to make permanent resistance to sound argument. Men\r\nlike Liverpool would hold to a bad principle at any cost. Peel was always\r\nopen to conversion. In 1829 he had, by one of these wise surrenders, saved\r\nthe country from the maintenance of the Catholic disabilities, and he was\r\nnow in a similar way to abandon Protection. But the real credit for this\r\nLiberal triumph belonged to the Manchester School. In other matters he\r\nmoved in the same line without outside pressure. The most conspicuous\r\nexhibition of Liberalism which was made by Peel of his own initiative was\r\nhis treatment of Ireland, and his most useful project was frustrated by his\r\nown party. He applied himself with his usual disinterested ambition to the\r\ngovernment of Ireland. He saw that that country must be treated according\r\nto its own nature, and not according to that of England, if it was ever to\r\nbe prosperous and contented. Its principal grievances were the subjection\r\nof Catholicism to Protestantism, and the distortion of a peculiarly Irish\r\nsystem of landholding to the peculiarly English rules of law. Both problems\r\nwere attacked by Peel in the right spirit, if not in the right way,\r\n\r\nOne of the worst consequences of the religious inequality was the ignorance\r\nof the Catholic clergy and population. No honest Catholic would set foot in\r\nthe Irish Universities, which were exclusively Protestant in temper. A\r\nsmall annual grant of L9,000 had been made to the Catholic College for\r\npriests at Maynooth since the beginning of the century. This was all that\r\nhad been done to carry out the conciliatory policy of Pitt. Peel in 1845\r\nproposed to increase the grant to L26,000. This was not a purely Liberal\r\nway of dealing with the difficulty. No {188} system of endowment can\r\nestablish equality between sects, because no Government is capable either\r\nof endowing all sects or of deciding what sects should be selected in\r\npreference to the others. Endowment can only create inequalities. The only\r\nlevelling process is disendowment. But the Maynooth grant was a practical\r\nmeasure, however little it squared with logic. The Whigs supported it, and\r\nin the face of a clamour which recalled the days of the Puritan Revolution,\r\nPeel had his way.[232] A second Bill established three colleges for laymen,\r\nwhich offered education to all comers irrespective of creed.\r\n\r\nThe second line of advance was towards the establishment of the tenant's\r\nright to compensation for improvements. The Irish land question had at last\r\nattracted the earnest attention of an English Government. The particular\r\ndifficulty with which Peel now endeavoured to grapple was the result of the\r\nEnglish legal theory that everything put into the soil was the property of\r\nthe landlord, and the Irish custom which allowed the tenant to make all the\r\nimprovements in the holding. A tenant who spent his own money on building,\r\nfencing, and ditching found his rent raised on the ground that the land had\r\nthereby been made more valuable, and in default of payment, was mercilessly\r\nevicted. In England, where the landlord paid for most permanent\r\nimprovements, this rule was not unjust. In Ireland, where the landlord paid\r\nfor none of them, it was little better than robbery. Bills entitling the\r\ntenant to compensation for his improvements had been introduced in 1835,\r\n1836, and in 1843. A Royal Commission appointed by Peel presented a\r\nfavourable report in 1845, and a fourth Bill was brought forward in the\r\nLords. That Assembly, by one of its most fatal displays of Tory spirit,\r\nkilled the Bill, and it was not introduced again for thirty-six years.\r\n\r\nThe debate in the Lords presented the Tory theory of Irish government in\r\nits crudest form. It was nothing that the history and the economic\r\nstructure of Irish society were entirely different from those of English\r\nsociety. If Ireland appeared different, it {189} was a reason, not for\r\ntrying to understand her, but for trying to coerce her. If she would not\r\nbehave like England, she must be forced. If she would not swallow of her\r\nown free will those provisions which formed the ordinary diet of England,\r\nthey must be rammed down her throat. Thirty-six Peers, owning Irish land,\r\npresented a petition against the Bill. Lord Clanricarde stated the case\r\nwith precision. \"What,\" he asked, \"had of late years been the drift of\r\ntheir Irish legislation? Had it not been, as far as they could, to\r\nassimilate the laws of that country to those of Britain? And if they meant\r\nto preserve tranquillity--to support the Union--they must persevere\r\nsteadily in that course of legislation.\"[233] To this disastrous policy\r\nLord Stanley, for the Government, Lord Devon, the chairman of the\r\nCommission, and one or two other Peers, offered a vain resistance. Nobleman\r\nafter nobleman rose to denounce this interference with the rights of\r\nproperty. The Bill was thrown out, and Parliament returned to its dull\r\napplication of armed force to the management of the affairs of Ireland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{190}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MANCHESTER SCHOOL AND PALMERSTON\r\n\r\nWhile Peel was thus, with the co-operation of the Whigs, making some\r\napproach towards Liberalism, the real control of Liberal policy was passing\r\nout of the hands of the old governing class altogether. The active force in\r\nthe Liberal movement of this period was the Manchester School. The members\r\nof this school were not unlike the Philosophic Radicals, and the two were\r\ngenerally found on the same side. But the Manchester men differed in\r\ncharacter, if not in opinions, from the philosophers, and as they were more\r\nnumerous, they were more powerful. Conclusions which in the one case were\r\nreached by reasoning from accepted principles of human nature were reached\r\nin the other by the ways of practical experience. The manufacturer liked\r\nindividual liberty, not because he believed that it was only by leaving\r\nevery man to pursue his own interest that the greatest happiness of the\r\ngreatest number could be secured, but because he felt that he could manage\r\nhis business best if no outside person interfered with him, and that in\r\nsimilar circumstances others could do the same. The Radical was a Free\r\nTrader because Protection benefited one class at the expense of another.\r\nThe manufacturer was a Free Trader because Protection, by raising the price\r\nof corn, made his workpeople wretched, lowered the purchasing power of the\r\npeople, and lessened the demand for his manufactures, or else forced him to\r\npay higher wages and exposed him to foreign competition. The Radical\r\nsuggested that war should be made expensive, in order that human nature\r\n{191} might revolt against it. The manufacturer confined himself to the\r\ncommercial view that, so long as war existed, it was better to make it\r\ncheap and to confine it to the smallest possible area. The Radical approved\r\nof colonial independence because he believed that the Home Government could\r\nnot understand the interests of the colonists as well as the colonists\r\nthemselves. The manufacturer approved of colonial independence because it\r\nlessened the expenses and lightened the taxation of the English people. By\r\ndifferent roads the two schools generally reached the same end.\r\n\r\nThe Manchester School was essentially a middle-class school. The Radicals\r\nhad nothing in common but their Radicalism. The Manchester men were almost\r\nall of that sober, clear-headed, independent class, often sadly wanting in\r\ngracefulness and culture, but always amply endowed with courage,\r\nenterprise, and common sense, which has built up the cotton industry of\r\nEast Lancashire. They were not democratic in any theoretical sense.[234]\r\nThey cared nothing either for aristocracy or democracy. They were\r\naccustomed to mix on terms of equality with men of all classes, and their\r\nestimate of a man's worth was always their own, and depended on nothing but\r\nhis capacity. So far as personal intercourse is concerned, there is no part\r\nof the world where the social estimate of a man depends less upon the\r\naccidents of birth than that part of England where the Manchester School\r\nflourished. The manufacturers were not proof against the attacks of\r\ninterest, and their opposition to factory legislation is a serious blot on\r\ntheir political character. They believed as firmly as the Whigs in the\r\nvirtues of property, and most of them had no liking for such things as\r\nuniversal suffrage. But in other respects they had an influence upon the\r\nprogress of Liberalism which was profound and continuous. They made\r\nParliament think highly of the common people.\r\n\r\nTheir general principles were best stated by Fox, of Oldham. \"I have gone\r\ninto politics,\" he said, \"with this question constantly in my mind, What\r\nwill your theories, your forms, your {192} propositions, do for human\r\nnature? Will they make man more manly? Will they raise men and women in the\r\nscale of creation? Will they lift them above the brutes? Will they call\r\nforth their thoughts, their feelings, their actions? Will they make them\r\nmore moral beings? Will they be worthy to tread the earth as children of\r\nthe common Parent, and to look forward, not only for His blessing here, but\r\nfor His benignant bestowment of happiness hereafter? If institutions do\r\nthis, I applaud them; if they have lower aims, I despise them; and if they\r\nhave antagonistic aims, I counteract them with all my might and main.\"[235]\r\nThe language is more florid than that of Bentham would have been. But the\r\nprinciples are Bentham's, and they are purely Liberal.\r\n\r\nThe policy thus expounded by Fox was not a mere creed of pounds, shillings,\r\nand pence. The Manchester School is often denounced alternately as\r\ncold-hearted and material and as warmhearted and sentimental, of\r\nsacrificing at one time humanity to trade and at another national interests\r\nto a feeble love of peace. It in fact combined an intense moral earnestness\r\nwith a degree of plain good sense which has never been surpassed. It is, on\r\nthe one hand, largely due to the efforts of the School that ideas of\r\ninternational unity have supplanted the old ideas of the balance of\r\ninternational hostilities. But their whole programme--Free Trade, peace,\r\nnon-intervention, reduction of armaments, retrenchment, arbitration, and\r\ncolonial self-government--might have been, and in suitable circumstances\r\nalways was, urged on grounds of convenience and interest. Both the Peace\r\nSociety and Mr. Norman Angell are descended politically from the Manchester\r\nSchool, and without the union of the two forces, moral and economic, the\r\nSchool would have effected little. No popular agitation can ever succeed\r\nwithout an appeal to a moral sense, good or bad. Cobden and Bright and the\r\nother Manchester men saw, what the men of the world who differ from them\r\nnever see, that in politics, as in all life, your ultimate interest\r\ncoincides with morality. Honesty, if it had no virtue in itself, would\r\nstill be the best policy. It is as {193} true among nations as among\r\nindividuals that material good is achieved most easily and maintained most\r\nsecurely by treating your neighbour as you would have him treat you.\r\nInterference, boasting, hostile tariffs, regulating the affairs of a nation\r\nwithout regard to the feelings of its members, all mean unrest, expense,\r\nheavy taxation, and perhaps war. Order and peace are essential to\r\nprosperity, and order and peace can only be secured by moral conduct. Even\r\nthe dullest economic programmes were thus touched by the Manchester men\r\nwith moral fire. \"I see in the Free Trade policy,\" said Cobden, \"that which\r\nshall act on the moral world as the principle of gravitation in the\r\nuniverse--drawing men together, thrusting aside the antagonism of race, and\r\ncreed, and language, and uniting us in the bonds of eternal peace.\"[236]\r\nThe hope was sanguine, and its realization will not come yet. But it is\r\nonly by hopes like this that the world has ever been moved. We advance by\r\nthe labours of those who identify interest with morality, and not of those\r\nwho calculate morality in terms of interest. To domestic and foreign policy\r\nalike the Manchester School gave a tone which they had never possessed\r\nbefore. The international ideas of the French Revolution, thus identified\r\nwith national interest, were by them made part of the inheritance of\r\nLiberalism.\r\n\r\nThe School naturally subordinated foreign and colonial policy to domestic\r\npolicy. Foreign affairs were bluntly described by one of them as a gigantic\r\nsystem of outdoor relief for the aristocracy, and they resented the use of\r\nthe common people for the dynastic aims of diplomatists. \"Crowns, coronets,\r\nmitres,\" said Bright, \"military display, the pomp of war, wide colonies,\r\nand a huge empire, are, in my view, all trifles light as air, and not worth\r\nconsidering, unless with them you can have a fair share of comfort,\r\ncontentment, and happiness among the great body of the people.\"[237] \"It\r\nwas with that view,\" said Cobden, \"that I preferred my budget, and\r\nadvocated the reduction of our armaments; it is with that view, coupled\r\nwith higher motives, that I have recommended arbitration treaties, to\r\nrender unnecessary {194} the vast amount of armaments which are kept up\r\nbetween civilized countries. It is with that view--the view of largely\r\nreducing the expenditure of the State, and giving relief, especially for\r\nthe agricultural classes--that I have made myself the object of the\r\nsarcasms of those very parties, by going to Paris to attend peace meetings.\r\nIt is with that view that I have directed attention to our Colonies,\r\nshowing how you might be carrying out the principle of Free Trade, give to\r\nthe Colonies self-government, and charge them, at the same time, with the\r\nexpense of their own government.\"[238] \"The condition of England question,\"\r\nwrote Cobden to Peel, after the repeal of the Corn Laws, \"there is your\r\nmission!\"[239] It was certainly the mission of Cobden and his associates.\r\n\r\nThis insistence upon the paramount importance of domestic policy led the\r\nManchester men into an exaggerated contempt for foreign policy. Their\r\npatriotism was not wanting in sturdiness, but it was of that noble and rare\r\nvariety which is not afraid to rebuke national insolence and oppression.\r\nTheir opposition to the Crimean War and the support which most of them gave\r\nto the North during the American Civil War are among the best things which\r\nthe School ever did for England. Bright spoke of \"the high example of a\r\nChristian nation, free in its institutions, courteous and just in its\r\nconduct towards all foreign States, and resting its policy on the\r\nunchangeable foundation of Christian morality.... I believe there is no\r\npermanent greatness to a nation except it is based upon morality.... The\r\nmoral law was not written for men alone in their individual character, but\r\nthat it was written as well for nations.\"[240] The patriotism of a man like\r\nthis may have been mistaken, but it was never mean. The title of a \"Peace\r\nat any price man\" was never deserved by any member of the School. It\r\nopposed only the aggressive and risky policy, which in Palmerston's day\r\npassed for the maintenance of national dignity and influence, and wasted\r\nthe wealth of the people in quarrels with which they had no real {195}\r\nconcern. \"The middle and industrious class of England can have no interest\r\napart from the preservation of peace. The honour, the fame, the emoluments\r\nof war belong not to them; the battle-plain is the harvest-field of the\r\naristocracy, watered with the blood of the people.... It is only when at\r\npeace with other States that a nation finds the leisure for looking within\r\nitself, and discovering the means to accomplish great domestic\r\nameliorations.\"[241] So they suspected British rule in India, partly\r\nbecause it involved wars, partly because its temper reacted upon free\r\ngovernment at home. So they maintained that England should never interfere\r\nin the quarrels of other peoples. The Balance of Power was to them a mere\r\nphrase, and unless the interests of England were directly involved, the\r\nGovernment had no right to inflict upon her common people the miseries even\r\nof a successful war. If Russia abused the Poles, or invaded Hungary to\r\nreduce it into the power of Austria, that was their affair, and not ours.\r\n\"We are no more called upon,\" said Cobden, \"to wrest the attribute of\r\nvengeance from the Deity, and deal it forth upon the Northern aggressor,\r\nthan we are to preserve the peace and good behaviour of Mexico, or to\r\nchastise the wickedness of the Ashantees.\"[242] \"It is not our duty,\" said\r\nBright, \"to make this country the knight-errant of the human race.\"[243]\r\nThis was a rule of good sense. The breach of it was not only costly, but a\r\nbad precedent. \"If you claim the right of intervention in your Government\r\nyou must tolerate it in other nations also.... I say, if you want to\r\nbenefit nations struggling for their freedom, establish as one of the\r\nmaxims of international law the principle of non-intervention.\"[244] Cobden\r\nonce went so far as to say that \"at some future election we may probably\r\nsee the test of 'no foreign politics' applied to those who offer to become\r\nthe representatives of free constituencies.\"[245] But he was never opposed\r\nto a policy which protected our own {196} interests, and he approved of\r\noffers to mediate between two contending foreign nations.[246] This dislike\r\nof armed force went much farther than the old Whig principle. The Whigs\r\ndenounced active interference in the domestic affairs of other peoples. The\r\nManchester School would have prevented interference for the protection of\r\none nation against another. Let the Continent settle its own quarrels, and\r\nhowever much we may abhor particular acts of immorality, let us confine\r\nourselves to cases where we are ourselves concerned. This marked the\r\nextreme of the reaction against the policy of aggression, and it went\r\nfarther than a Liberal ought to go. The Manchester men were probably driven\r\nto exaggerate their principles by the excesses of Palmerston. Canning, who\r\nwas a true Liberal, interfered in defence of national rights, but only when\r\nhe had a good chance of success. Palmerston often interfered when he had no\r\nchance of success, and irritated to no purpose. The reaction against\r\nPalmerston's ill-judged activity brought the Manchester School to the point\r\nof justifying inactivity even where activity would have been safe for\r\nEngland and of benefit to a foreign people. But however ill-judged it may\r\nhave been in particulars, the general effect of this depreciation of\r\nforeign affairs was beneficial. The condition of England has ever since\r\nremained the first care of English Governments.\r\n\r\nThe domestic policy which the Manchester School made the first object of\r\ngovernment was in the direct course of Liberalism. As has already been\r\nstated, they agreed generally with the individualist proposals of the\r\nPhilosophic Radicals. \"I do not partake,\" said Cobden, \"of that spurious\r\nhumanity which would indulge in an unreasoning kind of philanthropy at the\r\nexpense of the great bulk of the community. Mine is that masculine species\r\nof charity which would lead me to inculcate in the minds of the labouring\r\nclass the love of independence, the privilege of self-respect, the disdain\r\nof being patronized or petted, the desire to accumulate, and the ambition\r\nto rise.... Whilst I will not be the sycophant of the great, I cannot\r\nbecome the parasite of the {197} poor.\"[247] This habit of mind was\r\nexpressed in a general opposition to institutions and policies which\r\ninterfered with individual freedom. The School gave no assistance to\r\nproposals for economic regulation, and opposed Factory Bills in the same\r\nspirit as they opposed Protection.\r\n\r\nThe greatest practical service which they rendered was the emancipation of\r\nindustry from the system of Protection. Import duties were an interference\r\nby Government with the freedom of the individual to use his capital and his\r\nintelligence as he thought best, and they gave advantages to certain\r\nclasses and interests over other classes and interests and over the\r\ncommunity at large. An import duty raised the price of the taxed article\r\nfor the benefit of the industry which produced the same article in England.\r\nTwo consequences followed. The industries which used the taxed article paid\r\nan artificially high price for the benefit of the industries which made it,\r\nand the tax might be so high that they would be unable to continue in the\r\nface of foreign competition. Government was incapable of selecting what\r\nindustries might be taxed in this way without injury. It made an arbitrary\r\nselection without regard to the general interest, or at the instigation of\r\nclasses which desired to be benefited at the expense of the community. Some\r\nindustries were maintained by this artificial system which could not have\r\nmaintained themselves by their own efficiency. Other industries were\r\ncrippled which, in a freer system, could develop themselves to an\r\nindefinitely greater extent. Protection was vicious precisely as government\r\nby a class was vicious or as a system of religious disabilities was\r\nvicious. It established an aristocracy of industry, which was as bad as an\r\naristocracy of birth or of creed. Every industry should have an equal\r\nchance with every other, and no industry should be given the chance of\r\nexploiting the common people.\r\n\r\nThe Free Trade movement had begun with Adam Smith in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. But little progress had been made in practical politics before the\r\nReform Act. A {198} few economists like Ricardo and Joseph Hume argued the\r\ncase in the Commons with as much persistency as Cobden and Bright. But the\r\ncountry gentry were not economists, and their main practical object had\r\nbeen the maintenance of their rents by import duties on corn. The common\r\npeople, without any direct voice in politics, had been stung by their own\r\nsufferings into a vision of the truth, and resolutions in favour of free\r\nimports of corn had been passed at some of the Radical meetings after the\r\nFrench War.[248] In 1820 a number of London merchants presented a petition\r\nto the House of Commons which covered import duties of every kind, and\r\nstated \"That freedom from restraint is calculated to give the utmost\r\nextension to foreign trade, and the best direction to the capital and\r\nindustry of the country.\"[249] Huskisson, who was President of the Board of\r\nTrade from 1826 to 1828, had done something to readjust some of the import\r\nduties as between raw materials and partly or wholly manufactured goods.\r\nThe Whig victory took the matter no farther. The Whigs were at first\r\noccupied with constitutional changes, and after Melbourne had succeeded\r\nGrey, they ceased to apply themselves to reform of any kind. Immediately\r\nbefore their defeat in 1841 they made one or two vague proposals, but were\r\nbeaten before they could carry them into effect. The arrival of Peel, a\r\nUtilitarian Tory, decided the fate of the old system.\r\n\r\nPeel, with Gladstone at the Board of Trade, carried on Huskisson's policy\r\nwith vigour and success. The tariff in 1842 included no less than 1,200\r\nseparate articles. On 750 of these the duties were cut down, and a general\r\nrule was established that duties on raw materials should never exceed 5 per\r\ncent. of their value. Though this was not Free Trade, it was a great\r\ndeparture from the existing system of regulating trade by taxes. But the\r\ncorner-stone of Protection was the Corn Law, and this remained in force,\r\nmodified, but in principle untouched. Whigs and Tories alike believed in\r\nthe supremacy of land, and nothing {199} but a revolt of the manufacturers\r\ncould break it down. The revolt was led by the Manchester School.\r\n\r\nThe details of this famous struggle are not to be stated here. One or two\r\nquotations will indicate the Liberal temper of the Free Traders. The\r\nRadicals attacked the Corn Law in Radical language. \"It is the duty of\r\nParliament,\" said Hume, \"equally to protect all the different interests in\r\nthe country.... Are we warranted in giving to one particular interest a\r\nmonopoly against the other interests? I see no reason for giving the\r\ncapital employed in agriculture greater protection than the capital vested\r\nin other branches of trade, manufacture, or commerce.\"[250] The\r\nmanufacturers hated the landowners with a more personal hatred. They had\r\nlittle respect for these ignorant country gentlemen who maintained their\r\nown dignity at the expense of the manufacturer's capital and the workman's\r\nlife. \"The sooner the power in this country is transferred from the landed\r\noligarchy, which has so misused it, and is placed absolutely in the hands\r\nof the intelligent middle and industrious classes, the better for the\r\ncondition and destinies of this country.\"[251] The Corn Law was described\r\nas saying to the people, \"Scramble for what there is, and if the poorest\r\nand the weakest starve, foreign supplies shall not come in for fear some\r\ninjury should be done to the mortgaged landowners.\"[252] \"The labourer's\r\nbones and muscles are his own property, and not the landlord's. We claim\r\nfor ourselves that which we concede to him--the fair produce of whatever\r\npower, privileges, or advantages we possess. Here our principle claims the\r\nsame respect, the same sacred veneration, for the rights of property of the\r\nman who has nothing in the world but the physical strength with which he\r\ngoes forth in the morning to earn his dinner at noon, and that of the\r\ninheritor of the widest and most princely domain which can be boasted of in\r\nthis country of Great Britain.... There is no doubt that any duty on the\r\nimportation of corn must enhance the price of food; and whatever enhances\r\nthe price of food takes away from the fair earnings {200} of the\r\nindustrious.\"[253] The victory of the Anti-Corn Law League meant the\r\nvictory of the people over the landowners.\r\n\r\nBut that victory was emphasized not only by the triumph of principle, but\r\nby the triumph of organization. The fighting was done almost entirely by\r\nCobden and Bright outside Parliament. Both of the leaders, with Hume,\r\nVilliers, and other members, made speeches in Parliament. But the real work\r\nwas done by the League, which was founded in 1838, and for eight years\r\ncarried on an indefatigable but orderly campaign in the country. It bore\r\nsome resemblance to the Political Unions which had supported the great\r\nReform Bill. But those Unions had been massed behind the official Whig\r\nOpposition. The League had very few Members of Parliament at its head, and\r\nnot one of those was within the circle of Whig favour. The Unions had\r\nforced their policy upon the Tory party. The League forced its policy upon\r\nParliament. So far as active assistance was concerned the Opposition was no\r\nmore to the Free Traders than the Government. Both official parties looked\r\nupon it with suspicion, and the old jealousy of popular organization which\r\nhad faced the Corresponding Society and the Catholic Association was\r\ndisplayed by Whig as well as by Tory landlords. The lecturers of the League\r\nwere denounced, not only as \"commercial swindlers,\" but as \"the paid\r\nhirelings of a disloyal faction,\" and \"revolutionary emissaries,\" who\r\ninflamed the public mind \"with sentiments destructive of all moral right\r\nand order.\"[254] In 1843 the League was accused of promoting a strike of\r\nfactory hands in the North, and of rick-burning by agricultural labourers\r\nin the South, and it was rumoured that the Government intended to suppress\r\nit, as it suppressed the Catholic Association. It was not until Lord John\r\nRussell published his manifesto in favour of repeal in 1845 that a Member\r\nof Parliament of official rank openly allied himself with the League. Once\r\nthe leaders of Opposition had given way the work was easy. The political\r\ncentre of gravity was thus shifted from Westminster to the {201} country.\r\nIt was no longer open to Parliament to decide policy, and to direct the\r\nfortunes of the nation as it thought fit. Not even Opposition could make a\r\nfree choice of the topics of controversy and of legislation. It became the\r\nduty of members to observe the main currents of opinion, to check and\r\ndeflect them, but no longer to originate them. They must look in future,\r\nnot to their leaders, but to their constituents, for the principles which\r\nwere to direct their conduct. The people were brought into direct touch\r\nwith politics, and asserted their right, not only to censure their\r\nrepresentatives by unseating them at elections, but positively to influence\r\ntheir actions while they sat in the House.\r\n\r\nAn equally remarkable feature of the League, though its immediate political\r\nimportance was much less, was its use of a women's branch, which took an\r\nactive part in the work. This was the first organized employment of women\r\nin practical politics. The women who took part in Reform demonstrations\r\nlike that of Peterloo belonged to an impotent class, and did little active\r\nwork. The women of the Anti-Corn Law League did not make speeches.[255] But\r\nshort of appearing on public platforms they did the same kind of work as\r\ntheir men. Politics were at last acknowledged by the most powerful class in\r\nthe State to be women's work as well as men's. For the moment there was no\r\ndemand that women should control their own political affairs. But the one\r\nstep followed inevitably from the other. It was impossible that a woman of\r\nstrong character should thus engage in a strenuous political agitation\r\nwithout acquiring some of that desire for personal control which is the\r\nessence of democratic politics. Among the men of the League there were\r\nprobably few who would have allowed women to work with them except as\r\nsubordinates, and the supporters of the women used language which showed\r\nthat they were not very far removed from the eighteenth century. \"I offer\r\nno apology,\" quaintly says the historian of the League, \"for the course\r\nthey took, for I never {202} had the smallest doubt of its perfect\r\npropriety and its perfect consistency with the softer characteristics of\r\nfemale virtue.\"[256] It did not occur to him that, even if it had been\r\ninconsistent with those softer characteristics, it might still have been\r\nconsistent with the desire of the women to use their natural powers as they\r\nthemselves, and not as he, thought fit. Men had not yet got to the point of\r\nallowing women to regulate their own lives in their own way. But when they\r\nadmitted that they might safely take part in serious public business, they\r\nsowed seed which has since borne much fruit. The modern Women Suffrage\r\nmovement began in those Northern districts where the League was powerful,\r\nand it has made least impression in those quarters where the League was\r\nweak.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Corn Law was the greatest practical achievement of the\r\nManchester School. In other matters they divided the credit with the\r\nRadicals, who were avowed followers of Bentham, and with the Peelites, who\r\nwere often Utilitarian in practice though not in theory. So far as domestic\r\npolicy was concerned their Liberalism was of the negative and incomplete\r\nkind. An attempt had been made in 1835 to establish agricultural training\r\nschools and model farms in Ireland. It was not enough to relieve the\r\ndistress of that miserable land, but it attacked one of its most urgent\r\nproblems in the right way. The Manchester men objected to their support of\r\na particular industry by the State, and Peel and the Benthamites took the\r\nsame side. In 1844 Peel ended the system of practical instruction, and the\r\nmodel farms were nearly all abandoned. In the same temper the Manchester\r\nSchool opposed Shaftesbury's Factory Bills, and if Free Trade is the best\r\nthing which they did for their country, their resistance to Factory\r\nlegislation is the worst. Many of them accepted restrictions on the hours\r\nof child labour. But anything which forced the employer to regulate his\r\nbuildings or his machinery or his processes in the interests of the health\r\nor safety of his workmen was opposed fiercely and persistently by the\r\nmajority. They objected to any interference with adult {203} men. On a\r\nmotion to inquire into the condition of journeymen bakers, Bright once\r\nspoke with a most unpleasant flippancy. \"He did not see how Parliament was\r\nto interfere directly and avowedly with the labour of adult men.... He\r\nshould be ashamed to stand up in defence of about two hundred stalwart\r\nScotchmen, who could publish a Gazette of their own, and write articles in\r\nit of considerable literary merit, and appeal for a remedy to that\r\nHouse.\"[257] He and his associates overlooked the fact that the difference\r\nbetween a man and a woman or a child was only a difference of degree. They\r\nmisunderstood the principle of all legislation of this kind. Women and\r\nchildren were protected not because they were women and children, but\r\nbecause they were economically weak. They were not organized, they were\r\npoor, and their employers could use them as they pleased. Any class of men\r\nwhich was economically weak was morally entitled to the same protection. To\r\nsay that they were adult men was no answer to a complaint which had nothing\r\nto do with sex or age. Maleness did not of itself prevent either long hours\r\nor dirty premises. Here Radicals and Manchester men failed, and by 1867\r\nParliament had got no farther than to prohibit the employment of children\r\nunder eight years, to restrict the hours of labour of women and youths\r\nunder eighteen to ten or twelve hours a day, and to impose conditions about\r\nsanitation, ventilation, and the fencing of machinery upon some of the more\r\nunhealthy or dangerous trades. This progress, qualified by many exemptions,\r\nwas all that could be won in the face of individualist opposition to\r\neconomic reform.[258] But in another quarter the different schools of\r\nindividualists were united with conspicuous success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most complete and the most successful application of Liberal principles\r\nduring this period was in the reconstruction {204} of the colonial system.\r\nThe American Rebellion and the restoration of Canada had been isolated\r\nexamples, the first of Liberal defeat, the second of Liberal victory. But\r\nby the middle of the century this casual wisdom had been developed into a\r\ndeliberate and consistent policy. The growth of the other Colonies at the\r\nCape, Australia, and New Zealand forced upon the Home Government the\r\nreconsideration of their methods of transacting colonial business. The Cape\r\nhad been taken from the Dutch during the French War. Australia and New\r\nZealand had been discovered at the end of the eighteenth century, and by\r\n1840 were both recognized as British Colonies. The Government were then\r\nfaced with the same problem as that which had confronted them in America.\r\nThe old system was government by the Colonial Office, and in one respect it\r\nhad been more deliberately egoistic than in any other part of the world.\r\nThe Australian Colonies had for a long time been used as a dumping ground\r\nfor social rubbish. The people for whom the Home Government could not\r\nprovide in England, it had been accustomed to send to New South Wales, to\r\nWestern Australia, and to Van Diemen's Land. A large part of the population\r\nof these countries consisted partly of transported convicts and partly of\r\npaupers whom public or private money had enabled to emigrate. As Sir\r\nWilliam Molesworth bluntly described it, \"Colonial Office colonization\r\nconsists in the transportation of convicts and the shovelling out of\r\npaupers.\"[259] The time was at length reached when the independent\r\nemigrants and the descendants of earlier settlers who were themselves of\r\ngood character protested against this use of their country without their\r\nown consent.[260]\r\n\r\n{205}\r\n\r\nIn 1839 Russell, as Colonial Secretary, stopped transportation to New South\r\nWales. But convicts were still sent to Tasmania and Norfolk Island. In four\r\nyears no less than sixteen thousand of these unwelcome immigrants had been\r\nforced upon the inhabitants of Tasmania, and in 1840 they presented a\r\npetition praying that the system might be stopped. Peel's Government\r\nsuspended transportation to Tasmania for two years, but actually\r\ncontemplated reviving it in the case of New South Wales. Transportation was\r\napparently regarded as a sort of administration of human alcohol. So long\r\nas the proportion of convicts to independent settlers did not exceed a\r\ncertain figure no harm would be done. But the inhabitants of New South\r\nWales protested loudly, and when the Whigs came into office in 1847, with\r\nLord Grey as Secretary for the Colonies, they abolished all transportation\r\nexcept to Bermuda and Gibraltar. A last attempt to impose upon colonists\r\nwas made in 1849. A shipload of convicts was then taken to the Cape. There\r\nwas a violent outburst of feeling, and the noxious cargo was finally\r\ndischarged in Tasmania. After a few more years of bickering between the\r\nembarrassed Imperial Government and the determined colonists, the system\r\nwas completely abandoned in 1853.[261]\r\n\r\nThe next step was to entrust the colonists with the management of their own\r\ndomestic affairs. The details of the various Acts of Parliament are not\r\nimportant. In 1842 Peel's Ministry had established a Legislative Council in\r\nNew South Wales. The Whigs extended the system to the whole of Australia.\r\nBut the real credit for establishing the new spirit belongs to the\r\nManchester School and the Radicals, of whom Sir William Molesworth was the\r\nmost conspicuous. Russell and Grey always took the Liberal line, but with\r\nmore coldness. They were content with nominated or partly nominated\r\nLegislatures. Molesworth argued boldly for a complete system of responsible\r\ngovernment. \"The nostrum of the Colonial Office for the Australian Colonies\r\nis the {206} single, partly nominated Chamber. Now every one acknowledges\r\nthat such an institution is not only in opposition to the principle of\r\npolitical science, but to the universal experience of Anglo-Saxon\r\ncommunities in every part of the globe.... An Englishman, when he emigrates\r\nto the United States, carries with him in reality all the laws, rights, and\r\nliberties of an Englishman; but if he emigrates to our Colonies, on\r\ntouching colonial soil he loses some of the most precious of his liberties,\r\nand becomes the subject of an ignorant and irresponsible despot at the\r\nAntipodes.\"[262] He proposed \"that the Colonial Office shall cease to\r\ninterfere with the management of the local affairs of these Colonies, and\r\nthat they shall possess the greatest amount of self-government that is not\r\ninconsistent with the unity and well-being of the British Empire.\"[263]\r\n\r\nThe practical proposals of Molesworth were not immediately accepted, and\r\nthe first colonial constitutions did not provide for the responsibility of\r\nMinisters to the Legislature. But a clause in the Australian Colonies\r\nGovernment Act of 1850 provided that the Colonies might alter their own\r\nconstitutions, and it was not long before they took advantage of the\r\npermission. The Liberal principle of local independence was thus\r\npermanently established. The temper in which the Imperial Government has\r\never since applied itself to the details of administration has been that of\r\nMolesworth. \"The great principle of colonial government is, that all\r\naffairs of merely local concern should be left to the regulation of the\r\nlocal authorities; to that principle I know of no general exceptions,\r\nunless in cases where local interests may clash with the interests of the\r\nEmpire at large, or in cases where some one predominant class of a society\r\nmight be disposed to exert such powers, so as unjustly to depress some\r\nfeebler and defenceless class.\"[264] In modern times the line between local\r\nand Imperial interests has been pushed farther back. Some Acts of {207}\r\nColonial Legislatures have been disallowed by the Crown. These have\r\ngenerally conflicted in spirit or in letter with the Imperial law. Among\r\nthem have been Acts for reducing the salary of a Governor-General, for\r\nregulating copyright and shipping, for checking foreign immigration, and\r\nfor altering the law relating to marriage and divorce. But with the growth\r\nof colonial populations even this interference has become rarer. Acts for\r\nchecking Chinese immigration into Australia and for permitting marriage\r\nwith a deceased husband's brother in New Zealand have been recently\r\nsanctioned by the Crown. Under the influence of this Liberal temper the\r\nself-governing Empire has grown to its present proportions. A queer freak\r\nof political fortune has made Tories of the present generation the\r\nself-styled champions of communities which, if Tory doctrines had been\r\napplied to their government half a century ago, would have been long since\r\ndriven into revolt and independence.\r\n\r\nThe fidelity of Parliament to the new theory was once more seriously tested\r\nin 1853, when the Whigs were no longer in absolute power, and the\r\ngovernment was in the hands of a coalition of Whigs and Peelites. The Tory\r\nside was then weighted by the influence of the Church of England, in whose\r\nfavour an unfortunate reservation had been made in Canada. The question\r\narose out of the appropriation of some lands in Canada for the endowment of\r\nthe Church. The Canadian Legislature had presented an address to the Crown,\r\npraying that the disposition of these lands might be left to itself as a\r\nmatter of purely local and not Imperial concern. There had been\r\nconsiderable dispute about the subject in previous years, and in 1840\r\nParliament had passed an Act appropriating the revenues of the Clergy\r\nReserves in part to the Church of England, in part to the Church of\r\nScotland, and otherwise for religious and educational purposes. The\r\nCanadian Legislature now asked that Parliament should invest it with full\r\npower to deal with the endowments according to the wishes of the\r\ninhabitants of the Colony. The issue was plain. The Churches were in\r\nCanada, the clergy were in Canada, the lands were in Canada. {208} Were\r\ntheir affairs to be managed by Canadians or Englishmen? The Church fought\r\nfor its privileges. In 1840 the Bishops in the House of Lords had demanded\r\nthat whatever other concessions were made to colonial feeling, the Church\r\nat least should be maintained at all costs. \"The Church wished, for the\r\nsake of peace, to make any reasonable concessions with regard to property,\r\nprovided always that the Church was recognized as the Established Church of\r\nthe Colony.\"[265] The Canadians were to be adapted to the use of the\r\nChurch, not the Church to the use of the Canadians.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 these arguments were employed in the House of Commons by Sir John\r\nPakington and by Lord John Manners. Property had been appropriated to the\r\nChurch of England, and it must remain with her even at the cost of colonial\r\nindependence. Sir William Molesworth and Gladstone put the Liberal case as\r\nforcibly as on the Australian Bill. \"It is high time,\" said the latter, \"to\r\nhave done appealing to one part of the people. We know of old the meaning\r\nof these words--we know from disastrous experience their effects--we know\r\nthat the effect of them was to create knots and cliques of intriguers, who\r\nput upon themselves the profession of British supporters, who denied the\r\nname of loyalists to all who would not adopt their shibboleth, and caused a\r\nstrong reaction in the minds of the colonial population; so that, if under\r\nthat system of government you would look to govern the people of Canada,\r\nyou must expect the spread, if not of disloyalty, yet of dissatisfaction\r\nand dissent; and that pervading the great mass of the community there will\r\nbe a current of public opinion throughout the Colony, if not contrary to,\r\nyet distinct from, the current of British feeling.\"[266] This argument,\r\nshowing clearly that the speaker's mind was already moving towards the\r\nIrish policy of which he himself had as yet no conception, was sufficient\r\nto keep the House in the path upon which it had previously entered. The\r\nChurch was beaten by 275 votes to 192, and the last foundation-stone of\r\nEmpire was firmly laid. The strength of the {209} structure was tested\r\nagain in 1858, when the Canadian Parliament was allowed to impose duties\r\nupon British manufactures. It stood the strain, and in 1879 it was finally\r\nacknowledged that in its fiscal arrangements a Colony might treat the\r\nMother Country as it treated a Foreign State.[267]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn foreign affairs the predominance of Palmerston gave a uniform tone to\r\nEnglish policy for a whole generation. The Whigs were in power from 1830 to\r\n1841, from 1846 to 1852, and, with a brief interval, from 1852 to 1866, and\r\nthough Palmerston was not always at the Foreign Office, his influence was\r\nalways great while his party was in a majority. Generally his sympathies\r\nwere on the side of Liberalism. He believed in the theory of nationality,\r\nand, though he was no enthusiast for democracy, he had a great hatred of\r\ntyranny. But while his principles were in the main Liberal, his methods\r\nwere essentially Tory. He had a constant desire to see England play a great\r\npart in foreign affairs, and while he sometimes oppressed small peoples for\r\nunworthy objects, he frequently irritated and offended Great Powers without\r\nany profitable result. As one of his subordinates said of him, \"He wished\r\nto make and to keep England at the head of the world, and to cherish in the\r\nminds of others the notion that she was so.\"[268] \"England,\" he said, \"is\r\nstrong enough to brave consequences.\"[269] The braving of consequences in\r\nforeign, even more than in domestic affairs, is a dangerous game to play.\r\nIt was a game in which Palmerston delighted, and whenever he was in office\r\nthe country might count on a succession of hazardous enterprises being\r\nundertaken for its amusement, and at its expense.\r\n\r\nThis egoistic policy was not inconsistent with the principles of Whigs who\r\nliked national independence and English political institutions, and in some\r\nof his most dangerous exploits Palmerston had the powerful support of Lord\r\nJohn Russell. But it was opposed on the one hand to the theories of\r\nPeelites like Peel himself, Gladstone, and Lord Aberdeen, and on the other\r\nto the {210} theories of Cobden and Bright and the Manchester School. The\r\nformer disliked everything that was unmethodical, disturbing, and\r\nexpensive. The latter hated Palmerstonism, because it so vividly expressed\r\nthat aristocratic subordination of domestic to foreign affairs, that use of\r\nthe common people for purposes which they could not understand, which it\r\nwas their habit to attack in all its forms. The conflict which extended\r\nover the whole of the Palmerston era was thus rather a conflict between a\r\nTory use of Liberalism and a Liberal use of it than between Toryism and\r\nLiberalism. There was no general disposition on either side to interfere\r\ndirectly in the domestic concerns of foreign peoples. Palmerston was more\r\nthan once guilty of this gross offence. But men so opposite as Peel and\r\nCobden were agreed on the point, and Peel's dignified request for fair play\r\nfor the Socialist French Republic of 1848 is more in the vein of Fox and\r\nGrey than in that of Pitt and Grenville. Even Palmerston would not dispute\r\nthe soundness of the general principle. But his constant attempts to\r\ndictate policies to other peoples made his Liberalism a very different\r\nthing from that of his opponents, who, while they were sometimes ready to\r\noffer mediation, were never ready, as he was, to hazard the fortunes of the\r\nEnglish people on behalf of causes where success was doubtful or\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nBetween 1830 and 1841 Palmerston was chiefly concerned with the Iberian\r\nPeninsula and the Near East. In 1832 he very rightly sent a fleet to the\r\nTagus to stop Miguel's abuse of British subjects, and he declined with\r\nequal propriety to prevent France from doing the same on her own behalf. He\r\nthen proceeded to open negotiations for filling the thrones of both\r\nPortugal and Spain, which were inconsistent with Liberal principle and\r\nproduced no result except to excite the jealousy of France. Hostility to\r\nFrance combined with hostility to Russia to shape his policy in Turkey and\r\nEgypt. He had at this time a belief, which he never lost, that Turkey could\r\nregenerate herself. When Mohammed Ali, the Pasha of Egypt, threw off his\r\nallegiance to the Sultan, and not only expelled the Turks from his own\r\nterritory but conquered a large part of their possessions in Syria, {211}\r\nPalmerston interfered to prevent his advance. France had shown sympathy\r\nwith Egypt, Russia with Turkey. To leave the matter where it stood meant\r\nthe permanent separation of the two Eastern countries, neither strong\r\nenough to stand alone, and each therefore dependent on and dominated by one\r\nof the two European Powers whom Palmerston disliked. At all costs Turkey\r\nmust be kept from Russia and Egypt from France. The British fleet was\r\ntherefore sent to Syria, and Mohammed Ali was stripped of his conquests and\r\nsent back to his own country. This was a clear case of the exploitation of\r\nweaker races in the interest of England's private disputes with other\r\nPowers.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese War of 1840, in which English ships and men were used to force\r\nthe opium traffic upon China, was hardly Palmerston's fault, and was begun\r\nand conducted by the British diplomatic agents. In 1841 he rendered great\r\nservice to the cause of international friendship by procuring the European\r\nPowers to consent to a convention for the suppression of the Slave Trade,\r\nand thus completed the work which had been begun by Wilberforce and\r\nClarkson more than fifty years before. In 1846, after the fall of Peel, he\r\nbegan his second term of office by a refusal to join France and Austria in\r\ninterfering by force of arms in the internal disorders of Switzerland, and\r\nprocured a settlement by mediation. This was as wise and temperate a course\r\nas could be required. But immediately afterwards he began a series of\r\nextraordinary violations of Liberal principle. In July, 1846, he instructed\r\nthe British Ambassador in Spain to lecture the Spanish Government on its\r\nunconstitutional domestic policy, and in order to thwart Louis Philippe of\r\nFrance, meddled with the marriage of the young Queen. In November he sent a\r\nfleet to Lisbon to overawe the Portuguese Junta, and re-established the\r\nQueen, who had been expelled, on condition of her giving up her absolutism\r\nand undertaking to govern with free institutions. In the next year he sent\r\nLord Minto to Italy on a pedagogic tour among the various Governments,\r\nbidding them set their houses in order before the prevailing unrest upset\r\nthem. {212} All this was in the worst possible manner, and love of national\r\nfreedom was strangely mixed with jealousy of France and Austria. In 1848,\r\nthe year of Revolutions, when every country in Europe except Russia was\r\ndisturbed, and even England suffered a final and sporadic outbreak of\r\nChartism, Palmerston indulged his love of freedom to the full. Neither he\r\nnor Lord John Russell concealed their sympathy with the Poles, the\r\nHungarians, and the Italians, and while they declined to join in\r\nContinental wars, they upheld the Sultan in his refusal to give up\r\nHungarian refugees to Austria and Russia. No Liberal could find much cause\r\nfor complaint in this sympathetic policy, even though it incurred the\r\nhostility of reactionary Governments. Contrasted with Russia assisting\r\nAustria to put down the Hungarians, and with the French Republic helping\r\nAustria to destroy the Republic of Rome, England at this time appeared\r\nconspicuously magnanimous. But in 1851 Palmerston's gay pugnacity led him\r\ninto a gross blunder.\r\n\r\nThe object of his censure was Greece. The condition of that State was such\r\nas Palmerston could not overlook. British subjects had from time to time\r\nreason to complain of the inefficiency of the law and of the delays and\r\nevasions of the Government. A riot, in which a substantial amount of\r\nprivate property was destroyed, at last gave an excuse for intervention.\r\nClaims for compensation were presented to the Greek Government, and\r\nPalmerston, without advising the sufferers to try the law, and without\r\nhimself allowing any play for diplomacy, sent a fleet to blockade the\r\nPiraeus, and demanded the settlement of all the claims in full. Some of\r\nthese claims, of which that of the Maltese Jew Pacifico was the worst, were\r\nnotoriously extravagant or dishonest, and Palmerston, by his hasty action,\r\nhad made the British fleet an instrument of the most impudent blackmail.\r\nFrance and Russia stepped in, at first with offers of mediation, and then,\r\nwhen Palmerston flouted their suggestions, with vigorous remonstrance. In\r\nthe face of this opposition such a bad case could not be pressed, and the\r\nmatter was referred to arbitration. Palmerston's egoism had betrayed him.\r\nHe had bullied Greece. {213} He gave way to France, and he abased himself\r\nbefore Russia. The note addressed to the Russian Ambassador by Count\r\nNesselrode is perhaps the most humiliating document ever received by an\r\nEnglish Minister. \"It remains to be seen whether Great Britain, abusing the\r\nadvantages which are afforded her by her immense maritime superiority,\r\nintends henceforth to pursue an isolated policy, without caring for those\r\nengagements which bind her to the other Cabinets; whether she intends to\r\ndisengage herself from every obligation, as well as from all community of\r\naction, and to authorize all Great Powers, on every fitting opportunity, to\r\nrecognize to the weak no other rule but their own will, no other right but\r\ntheir own physical strength. Your Excellency will please to read this\r\ndispatch to Lord Palmerston, and to give him a copy of it.\" To the meek\r\nacceptance of lectures like this was Great Britain reduced by Palmerston's\r\n\"spirited and aggressive\" policy. The rebuke was not made less effective by\r\nthe fact that every word of it might have been addressed to Russia herself.\r\nBut Palmerston, with his theories of the Balance of Power and his bluster\r\nin Spain and Portugal, no less than with his genuine love of national\r\nindependence and constitutional government, had contrived to offend all the\r\nGreat Powers in turn, and they clutched eagerly at this chance of reading a\r\nlecture to the man who had so often played the pedagogue towards\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe case of Don Pacifico was the cause of a general attack upon\r\nPalmerston's conduct of foreign affairs. In the House of Lords, Stanley\r\ncarried a vote of censure on the particular incident. This was answered in\r\nthe Commons by Roebuck's motion of general confidence in the whole policy.\r\nThe debate lasted for six days, and Palmerston defended himself in the\r\nfinest speech he ever made. He claimed to have maintained the honour of\r\nEngland, and to have entitled every subject of the Crown to boast of his\r\ncitizenship like the old Romans. He was answered as brilliantly by Peel and\r\nGladstone, by Molesworth, and by Cobden. \"I protest,\" said the philosophic\r\nRadical, \"against the honourable and learned gentleman's doctrines, which\r\nwould {214} make us the political pedagogues of the world.... I maintain\r\nthat one nation has no more right to interfere with the local affairs of\r\nanother nation than one man has to interfere in the private affairs of\r\nanother man.\"[270] Gladstone was less dogmatic but equally forcible, and it\r\nis in his speech rather than in those of Radicals and Manchester men that\r\nthe real Liberal view of the case was expressed. He admitted that it might\r\nsometimes be right that one nation should interfere with another, and that\r\nif England ever interfered she should interfere on the side of liberty as\r\nagainst despotism. But his case against Palmerston was that he interfered\r\non behalf of revolution before it was successful. We should interfere, if\r\nat all, to protect an established constitutional Government, and not to set\r\nit up. \"The difference among us arises upon this question: Are we, or are\r\nwe not, to go abroad and make occasions for the propagation even of the\r\npolitical opinions which we consider to be sound? I say we are not.... We\r\nmust remember that if we claim the right not only to accept, when they come\r\nspontaneously and by no act of ours, but to create and catch at,\r\nopportunities for spreading in other countries the opinions of our own\r\nmeridian, we must allow to every other nation a similar license both of\r\njudgment and of action. What is to be the result? That if in every country\r\nthe name of England is to be the symbol and the nucleus of a party, the\r\nname of France and Russia, or of Austria, may and will be the same. And are\r\nyou not, then, laying the foundation of a system hostile to the real\r\ninterests of freedom, and destructive of the peace of the world?...\r\nInterference in foreign countries, sir, according to my mind, should be\r\nrare, deliberate, decisive in character, and effectual for its end.... I\r\nprotest against these anticipations of occasion, on every ground both of\r\npolicy and of justice. The general doctrine is that we are not entitled to\r\nrecognize a government, far less to suggest one, until we see it\r\nestablished, and have presumptive evidence that it springs from a national\r\nsource.\"[271]\r\n\r\nOn the point of Don Pacifico, Gladstone administered a rebuke {215} which\r\nwas equally crushing. \"It would be a contravention of the law of nature and\r\nof God, if it were possible for any single nation of Christendom to\r\nemancipate itself from the obligations which bind all other nations, and to\r\narrogate, in the face of mankind, a position of peculiar privilege.... What\r\nwas a Roman citizen? He was the member of a privileged caste; he belonged\r\nto a conquering race, to a nation that held all others bound down by the\r\nstrong arm of power. For him there was to be an exceptional system of law;\r\nfor him principles were to be asserted, and by him rights were to be\r\nenjoyed that were to be denied to the rest of the world.... He adopts in\r\npart that vain conception that we, forsooth, have a mission to be the\r\ncensors of vice and folly, of abuse and imperfection, among the other\r\ncountries of the world; that we are to be the universal\r\nschoolmasters.\"[272]\r\n\r\nThe victory of argument was with the critics. But Palmerston triumphed in\r\nthe Lobby, and there is no question that his policy was popular. A few\r\nmonths later he was turned out of office. He procured his downfall by a\r\nsuccession of foolish acts. Kossuth, the Hungarian patriot, paid a visit to\r\nEngland early in 1851, and Palmerston gave a cordial reception to a\r\ndeputation which described the Emperors of Austria and Russia as despots,\r\ntyrants, and odious assassins. The language was not very inaccurate. But it\r\nwas not the business of the Foreign Secretary to receive it with\r\napprobation. Public feeling was in this matter with Palmerston, and he was\r\nallowed to keep his place. But in December of the same year Napoleon, then\r\nPresident of the French Republic, tore up the Constitution under which he\r\nheld office, shot down some of his subjects in the streets of Paris,\r\nimprisoned his principal enemies, and took steps to get himself elected\r\nEmperor. The affair was as flagrant a violation of moral rules as any\r\nrevolution that had ever taken place, and the most stubborn of English\r\nTories might have been repelled by such a breach of faith. The Government,\r\nacting on the Liberal principle of non-interference, instructed the British\r\nAmbassador to be strictly neutral. But Palmerston privately told {216} the\r\nFrench Ambassador that he strongly approved of what had been done. This was\r\ntoo much for the Queen and for the Cabinet, and it was also too much for\r\nParliament and the people. The offending Minister was dismissed. With him\r\nwent the strength of the Whig party. In a few months the Ministry had\r\nfallen to pieces, and a coalition of Whigs and Peelites, with Lord\r\nGranville at the Foreign Office, had taken the place of the Tory Ministry\r\nwhich succeeded it.\r\n\r\nIn a Memorandum addressed to the Queen, Lord Granville laid down the main\r\nprinciples of the new foreign policy. They were a distinct expression of\r\nLiberal ideas. \"It was the duty and interest of a country such as Great\r\nBritain to encourage progress among all other nations. But for this purpose\r\nthe foreign policy of Great Britain should be none the less marked by\r\njustice, moderation, and self-respect, and avoid any undue attempt to\r\nenforce her own ideas by hostile threats.... They did not attach to the\r\nexpression 'non-intervention' the meaning implied by some who used it,\r\nviz., that diplomacy is become obsolete, and that it is unnecessary for\r\nthis country to know or to take part in what passes in other countries....\r\nWith respect to the internal affairs of other countries, such as the\r\nestablishment of Liberal institutions and the reduction of tariffs in which\r\nthis country has an interest, H.M.'s representatives ought to be furnished\r\nwith the views of H.M.'s Government ... but they should be instructed to\r\npress those views only when fitting opportunities occurred, and only when\r\ntheir advice and assistance would be welcome or be effectual.... With the\r\ncountries which have adopted institutions similar in liberality to our own,\r\nit ought to be the endeavour of H.M.'s Government to cultivate the most\r\nintimate relations ... and also to exert its influence to dissuade other\r\nPowers from encroaching on their territory or attempting to subvert their\r\ninstitutions. Cases might occur in which the honour and good faith of this\r\ncountry would require that it should support such allies with more than\r\nmerely friendly assurances.\"[273] This was the policy of the Government,\r\ncomposed partly of Whigs and {217} partly of Peelites, which replaced the\r\nshort-lived Government of Lord Derby in 1852.\r\n\r\nThe new Premier was Lord Aberdeen. He had been Foreign Secretary in Peel's\r\nadministration, and had exhibited a wise temper in a dispute with America,\r\nwhich Palmerston had left in a state of great difficulty. By an ironic\r\ntwist of fortune, this Liberal Ministry was soon involved in the Crimean\r\nWar, a blunder for which Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, the British\r\nAmbassador at Constantinople, Napoleon III of France, and the Palmerston\r\nSchool in England, must share the moral responsibility. Stratford was eager\r\nfor war, and stimulated the Sultan, Napoleon wanted to dazzle his people by\r\nmilitary glory, and Palmerston, once more in office as Home Secretary,\r\nhating Russia as the champion of autocracy, inspired by jealousy of her\r\npower, or fearful of anything which might endanger our communications with\r\nIndia, wished to bolster up the Turkish Government at all costs. The\r\ndetails of the negotiations need not be stated here. There was not\r\noriginally the least prospect of any danger to British interests, economic\r\nor political. The question at issue was whether Russia should have the\r\nright to protect the Christians of the Balkan Peninsular against the\r\nabominable tyranny of the Sultan of Turkey. Great Britain, through Lord\r\nStratford de Redcliffe, from the first did everything possible to impede\r\nRussia and to stimulate the Sultan. Eventually, the terms which the chief\r\nPowers presented to the two parties were accepted by Russia. Turkey, acting\r\nunder the direct instigation of Lord Stratford, rejected them, and war\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nLiberal protests were in vain. They were drowned by the clamour of a\r\npeople, which is not more conspicuous than any other for wisdom in time of\r\nwar. The Ministry collapsed under the odium of their bad management of the\r\ncampaign in the Crimea, and Palmerston, in whose temper the negotiations\r\nhad been conducted, came back to office, this time as Prime Minister. His\r\ntriumph over Liberalism was complete. Every one of the leading principles\r\nof Granville's memorandum was violated. England interfered in a quarrel on\r\nbehalf of the vilest {218} Government in Europe. She interfered on behalf\r\nof a State which had rejected her terms against a State which had accepted\r\nthem. She marched into the field at the side of a despot who had gained his\r\nthrone by a monstrous crime. The enemy against whom she fought was so vast\r\nthat not even such ends as she had could be gained except for a brief\r\nspace, and real success was as impossible as the cause was bad.\r\n\r\nIn two years the war was at an end. Hundreds of thousands of lives had been\r\nlost. Hundreds of millions of pounds had been blown away. The Emperor of\r\nthe French had strengthened his seat upon his throne. The Sultan of Turkey\r\nwas enabled, for twenty years more, to murder, flay, beat, and ravish his\r\nChristian subjects. Russia, rebuffed for the time being in the Balkans,\r\nbegan to move eastwards, and threatened us more directly in Persia. The\r\ngains of England were of the vaguest kind. If she had succeeded, after a\r\nwar which was chiefly due to the folly of her representative at\r\nConstantinople, in preventing Russia from appropriating part of the\r\nSultan's dominions, she had succeeded at the cost of committing herself to\r\nthe support of an ally who was as untrustworthy as he was vicious. The most\r\nsolid and permanent acquisition of the war was probably not understood at\r\nthe time by one Englishman in a thousand. It was accidental, and had\r\nnothing to do with the objects of British policy. It consisted in the work\r\nof Florence Nightingale. This had finally proved two things: the value of\r\ntrained nursing in the regulation of health, and the capacity of women to\r\nconstruct and control complicated organizations of human beings. Miss\r\nNightingale's work in the Crimea gave her an authority which made her\r\nsubsequent organization of trained nursing a comparatively easy task. Few\r\nstatesmen of the nineteenth century can claim to have done more than she to\r\nmake life worth living for their fellow-creatures, and if the war had\r\nproduced no result but this it might almost have been worth its cost. The\r\nimportance of Miss Nightingale's success in its bearings on the general\r\ncondition of women will appear greater fifty years hence than now. It was\r\ncertainly very great. Mary Somerville had {219} already acquired a\r\nreputation as an astronomer. Harriet Martineau had been an acknowledged\r\nchampion of Free Trade. But Florence Nightingale was the first woman who\r\nobtained for her public work that degree of publicity which catches the\r\nimagination of a people. Contemporary opinion, after assailing her with\r\nthat abuse and ridicule to which all pioneers are accustomed, consecrated\r\nher as \"The Angel with the Lamp.\" A wiser generation declines to identify\r\nher merely with those gentle qualities in which she is rivalled by many\r\nthousands of her sex, and sees in her strong and imperious temper, her\r\ncapacity for reducing order out of chaos, and her power of enforcing her\r\nwishes upon her subordinates, qualities in which she has seldom been\r\nsurpassed even by the greatest men. No English statesmen engaged in the\r\nconduct of the war displayed in a higher degree than she the attributes of\r\na great administrator, and the impression of her statesmanlike qualities\r\ncan never be effaced. It has not been possible, since her day, for any\r\nreasonable man to argue that women, as such, are constitutionally incapable\r\nof managing large affairs.\r\n\r\nThe deeper significance of the Crimean War was not perceived for another\r\ngeneration, and in domestic affairs at least a decade elapsed before any\r\nGovernment displayed activity. The whole nation seemed resigned into the\r\nhands of Palmerston. Ireland continued in its sullen course. The artisans,\r\nwhose political agitation had collapsed in 1848, were consolidating their\r\nTrade Unions and making successful experiments in co-operation. John Bright\r\noccasionally spoke on Parliamentary Reform, and denounced government by\r\naristocracy with a contempt as hearty as that of Paine. But he admitted\r\nthat he was \"flogging a dead horse.\" Apathy in domestic politics pervaded\r\nall classes. Except in foreign affairs, where Palmerston kept alive his\r\npeculiar conceptions of Liberalism, Parliament showed little activity. The\r\nCabinet, partly Whig and partly Peelite, was animated by no general\r\nprinciple. Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, already on his way\r\nfrom the Peelite camp to the Liberal, confessed that in domestic matters\r\nhis colleagues of 1860 were far {220} less Liberal than those of 1841,[274]\r\nand when the Lords rejected his Bill for the repeal of the Paper Duty in\r\nthat year, it was with the utmost difficulty that he dragged his chief into\r\na fight for the privileges of the Commons.\r\n\r\nOne or two measures, which excited little public interest, and required\r\nlittle effort from the easy-going Premier, marked the slow advance of\r\nLiberalism. The Settlement Duty Act of 1853 reduced the privileges of the\r\nlanded interest by imposing the same duties on land passing under a\r\nsettlement as had previously been paid by personal property. The Oxford\r\nUniversity Act of 1854 and the Cambridge University Act of 1856 opened the\r\ntwo ancient Universities to Nonconformists, though the highest degrees and\r\nall the important offices were still retained by the Establishment. The\r\nJewish Relief Bill, which had passed the Commons and been rejected by the\r\nLords seven times since 1832, became law in 1859, and the Christian\r\nmonopoly of Parliament came to an end. In 1857 the Divorce Act was carried\r\nin the face of clerical opposition, and enabled any person to obtain the\r\ndissolution of an unhappy marriage in a civil court. This was an\r\nessentially Liberal measure, in that it freed the individual from an\r\necclesiastical institution, but it emphasized on the other hand that sexual\r\nToryism which is worse than the Toryism of creed or class. One of the most\r\nbarbarous rules of a male society was preserved by the Act, and while a man\r\nwas permitted to divorce his wife for a single act of infidelity, a woman\r\ncould only divorce her husband if he were also guilty of cruelty or\r\ndesertion. Implicitly the Act permitted a man to indulge freely in vice so\r\nlong as he chose to live with his wife and not to beat her, at the same\r\ntime that it sentenced her to social extinction for a single fault. Moral\r\nstandards have risen since that time, and the use of women is no longer\r\nrecommended by medical men to their patients as a means of maintaining\r\nhealth. But the legal privilege preserved by the Divorce Act is enjoyed by\r\nthe dominant sex to this day. The Act had other faults, the chief of which\r\nwas that the procedure under it was so expensive that it was almost useless\r\nfor the {221} poor. But it was at least an advance towards liberty.[275]\r\nOne other measure of a Liberal sort has already been mentioned. In 1860 the\r\nLords rejected the Bill for the repeal of the duty on paper. In 1861 it was\r\nforced through, the price of paper was reduced, and the cheap newspaper and\r\nthe cheap book, with their enormous influence upon the habits of the mass\r\nof the people, were made possible. This was the work of Gladstone alone,\r\nand he and Cobden together contrived the great French Commercial Treaty\r\nwhich completed the reform of the tariff, and left the country with no\r\nimport duties except those which were imposed on goods not produced in\r\nEngland, and those which a countervailing excise robbed of all protective\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nWith these exceptions, the important events of the Palmerston period took\r\nplace abroad, where the Prime Minister's foreign policy pursued its\r\npretentious course. It presented its usual alternation of generous but\r\nrisky interference on behalf of oppressed nationalities with arrogant\r\nassertions of the British ego. A war with China in 1856 exhibited it at its\r\nvery worst. A ship called the _Arrow_ had obtained a licence from our\r\nrepresentative to fly the British flag in the China seas. Like others which\r\nenjoyed the same privilege, the _Arrow_ seems to have used it for very\r\ndubious purposes. After the period for which the licence was granted had\r\nexpired the Chinese Governor Yeh of Canton boarded the ship and arrested\r\nsome of its crew on a charge of piracy. Though his conduct at a later stage\r\nwas more violent, it seems clear that at the beginning of the quarrel he\r\nacted with dignity, and strictly within the law. But Sir John Bowring, the\r\nBritish Minister on the spot, chose to treat his action as a wanton and\r\nunprovoked insult to the British flag. He demanded the surrender of the\r\nprisoners and an apology, and when Yeh did what Bowring himself would have\r\ndone if their positions had been reversed, and refused to give way, he\r\nproceeded to employ all the ships and troops at his disposal in warlike\r\noperations. It was the {222} affair of Don Pacifico over again, with an\r\neven less specious excuse. In this case there was no legal justification\r\neven for diplomatic remonstrance.\r\n\r\nThe affair was atrocious enough in itself. But its atrocity was increased\r\nby the language and the methods of the English representatives. The _Arrow_\r\nhad been entitled by licence to hoist the British flag. The period covered\r\nby the licence had expired. \"But,\" argued Sir John Bowring, \"the Chinese\r\ndid not know that the time had expired, so that the insult to the flag is\r\nno less, and our pretext no worse.\" Macchiavelli himself could not have\r\nargued more shamelessly than this Utilitarian, and Cobden, who was a\r\npersonal friend of Bowring, rightly denounced it as the most dishonest\r\nthing that had ever been written in a British official letter. The British\r\nagents were in fact dealing with people whom they thought to be barbarians,\r\nand they were not concerned to stand upon the points of honour which were\r\ncommonly observed by civilized men. One of the incidents of the war\r\nexpressed this unworthy discrimination between Europeans and Asiatics no\r\nless clearly than the methods of the diplomatists. During the Crimean War\r\nthe Government had been very careful to avoid the bombardment of\r\nunfortified towns. However reckless they had been in going to war, they had\r\nhad sufficient moral discipline to refrain from the wanton injury of\r\ndefenceless persons. This rule, now universally adopted by all civilized\r\npeoples, was abandoned by the British Government in China, and half Canton\r\nwas laid in ruins and some hundreds of its peaceful inhabitants were shot\r\nor burnt to death, in order to assert the superiority of the civilized\r\nWestern nation over these insolent barbarians.\r\n\r\nThese outrageous proceedings were brought before the House of Lords by Lord\r\nDerby and before the House of Commons by Cobden, in speeches which in sheer\r\nforce of argument have never been surpassed. Every man of eminence, except\r\nthe few who were in office under Palmerston, spoke on the same side, and\r\neven Lord Lyndhurst, whose Toryism dated from the days of Eldon, took the\r\nLiberal view. Lord John Russell echoed the language of the Copenhagen\r\ndebate of half a century before. {223} \"We have heard much of late--a great\r\ndeal too much, I think--of the prestige of England. We used to hear of the\r\ncharacter, of the reputation, of the honour of England.\"[276] Even Roebuck,\r\nwhose motion had once defended Palmerston's against the consequences of\r\nactions hardly more honourable than this, came back to the Liberal side.\r\n\"The rule of morality extends over the globe, and what is just and unjust\r\nin the Mersey is equally just and unjust in the river before Canton.\"[277]\r\nOn this occasion Palmerston's majority deserted him. He won by a small\r\nmajority in the Lords, but was soundly beaten in the Commons. But the\r\nresources of the constitution were not exhausted. He dissolved Parliament\r\nand appealed to the country. The result of the election was not encouraging\r\nto those who valued honour in foreign policy. The Crimean fever had not\r\nabated, and this fresh appeal to national arrogance produced a great\r\ndemonstration in favour of the Prime Minister. The most striking feature of\r\nthe election was the extinction of the Manchester School. Cobden, Bright,\r\nMilner Gibson, and Fox of Oldham were all turned out of their seats. But\r\nthough the Liberals were thus censured by their contemporaries, the\r\njudgment of posterity must be pronounced hardly less emphatically in their\r\nfavour. Ten years later the new Liberal party, united on domestic and\r\nforeign policy, came into power, and it governed in both fields in a spirit\r\nwhich was the very opposite of that of Palmerston.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the lively veteran proceeded with varying success and\r\nunchanging cheerfulness. In November, 1857, he saw fit to pass public\r\ncensure on the French Emperor, which he had done nothing recently to\r\ndeserve. But by the following February he had completely changed his tone.\r\nA man named Orsini had made bombs in London for the purpose of blowing up\r\nthe Emperor in Paris, and Count Walewski, in a most impudent dispatch,\r\nrequested Palmerston to alter the law of England so as to prevent the\r\nrepetition of such practices. To the consternation of a House of Commons\r\nwhich had been {224} elected to express approval of his high-handed\r\ndealings with Russia and China, he meekly introduced a Conspiracy to Murder\r\nBill. This was too much even for his own followers, and within twelve\r\nmonths of his triumph he was beaten, and resigned. But nothing could stop\r\nhim, because nobody could replace him. In two years he returned to office,\r\nand he remained there until his death in 1865.\r\n\r\nForeign affairs gave him more than one more opportunity for the display of\r\nhis peculiar qualities. The Indian Mutiny was provoked and suppressed in\r\nIndia, and except for the protest which some Liberals raised against the\r\noccasional ferocity of the conquerors, there were few revelations of\r\ndifferences of opinion. The appropriation of Schleswig and Holstein by\r\nGermany in 1863 attracted at once Palmerston's zeal for national\r\nindependence and his desire to assert himself in Europe. He was always\r\neager to protect the little man irrespective of his merits. He and Lord\r\nJohn Russell ventured to interfere with some outrageous oppression of the\r\nPoles by Russia and Prussia in the beginning of 1863. It was a clear case\r\nof interference with domestic concerns of another nation, and the Russian\r\nGovernment in effect told them to mind their own business. Their\r\nsuggestions for reform here produced no good effect whatever. But in the\r\nsame year they again interfered, with hardly more excuse and no better\r\nresult, in the quarrel between Prussia and Denmark. The quarrel did little\r\ncredit to anybody concerned. Prussia, under the direction of Bismarck,\r\nbehaved with that dishonesty which was as marked a feature of that\r\nstatesman's diplomacy as its apparent success. Denmark behaved with a\r\nrashness which she could not afford in defence of a position which she\r\nought not to have taken up. By a Treaty of London which had been signed in\r\n1852 by England, France, Austria, Prussia, Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, the\r\ntwo Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein had been united with Denmark. Their\r\ninhabitants were mostly German, so that this treaty was inconsistent with\r\nLiberal theory. But such as it was, Prussia could not honestly refuse to\r\nobserve it. In 1864, after some fruitless {225} negotiations, she and\r\nAustria invaded the Danish territories. Probably no war has ever been begun\r\nwith less justification since Frederick the Great marched into Silesia.\r\nPalmerston was carried away by his feelings, and declared that \"those who\r\nmade the attempt would find in the result that it would not be Denmark\r\nalone with which they would have to contend.\"[278] Relying on this rash\r\ndeclaration, Denmark maintained a bold front. A speedy surrender might have\r\nleft her with part at least of the disputed provinces. In the end she was\r\ndespoiled of both. France and Russia would not fight, England would not\r\nfight alone. After encouraging Denmark to her fatal resistance, and after\r\nsummoning an ineffectual conference of the Powers she left her to her fate.\r\n\r\nThe error of the Government in this case lay not so much in their view of\r\nthe facts or their refusal to go to war as in the rash declarations which\r\nhad led the Danes to believe that they would have English support.\r\nPalmerston had once more applied Liberal principles in an awkward and\r\ndisastrous way. Even Cobden supported him in Parliament, and approved of\r\nhis refusal to go to war with a military Power like Prussia. But he pointed\r\nout that there were other principles in issue besides the interests of the\r\nreigning House of Denmark, and protested against \"the dynastic, secret,\r\nirresponsible engagements of our Foreign Office,\" which had in the first\r\nplace assigned these German men and women to a Danish Government. He\r\nemphasized the need that all diplomatists should attend to \"the question of\r\nnationalities--the instinct, now so powerful, leading communities to seek\r\nto live together, because they are of the same race, language, and\r\nreligion.... There will never again, in all probability, be a conference\r\nmeeting together to dispose, for dynastic purposes, of a population whose\r\nwishes they do not take into account.\"[279] The Government contrived to\r\nremain in office until Palmerston died, and the maintenance of the rights\r\nof nations fell into the hands of people who were as ardent as himself, and\r\nmuch more wise.\r\n\r\n{226}\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the foreign policy of Palmerston had been more ostentatious\r\nthan wise, and its failures were as conspicuous as its successes. But in\r\none quarter he and Lord John Russell together by their boldness rendered\r\ninvaluable service to a struggling nationality. The Treaty of Vienna had\r\noperated nowhere so vilely as in Italy. The whole country had been\r\nparcelled out between Governments, some of whom were alien and others\r\nbarbarous. The kingdom of Sardinia and Piedmont was Italian. Lombardy and\r\nVenetia were Austrian. In the middle, the Pope misgoverned one-third of the\r\npeople. The last third was oppressed in Naples and Sicily by a King of the\r\nHouse of Bourbon. The rising of 1848 had been suppressed by French troops\r\nat Rome and by Austrian troops in Lombardy. But in 1860 the zeal and\r\ndevotion of Italian men and women of all classes won a final victory, and\r\nit was England's privilege to assist at this great awakening, the birth of\r\nthat new Italy which died the other day in Tripoli. By a series of\r\nmiraculous victories, Garibaldi drove the Bourbons out of Sicily and\r\nNaples, and Vittorio Emmanuele marched down through the Papal States to\r\nmeet him. The Powers watched this uprising of a people with mixed feelings.\r\nAustria, France, Prussia, and Russia expressed their emphatic disapproval.\r\nLord John behaved like a Whig whose fire the Manchester School had not\r\nquenched. In a dispatch written on the 27th October, 1860, he supported the\r\nnew Italian system. He quoted Vattel with point: \"When a people from good\r\nreasons take up arms against an oppressor, it is but an act of justice and\r\ngenerosity to assist brave men in the defence of their liberties.\" The\r\nquestion was whether the Italian rising had taken place for good reasons.\r\n\"Upon this grave matter Her Majesty's Government hold that the people in\r\nquestion are themselves the best judges of their own affairs.... Such\r\nhaving been the causes and concomitant circumstances of the Revolution in\r\nItaly, Her Majesty's Government can see no sufficient grounds for the\r\nsevere censure with which Austria, France, Prussia, and Russia have visited\r\nthe acts of the King of Sardinia. Her Majesty's Government turn their eyes\r\nrather to the gratifying prospect of a people {227} building up the edifice\r\nof their liberties, and consolidating the work of their independence, amid\r\nthe sympathies and good wishes of Europe.\" All the noble temper which had\r\nbeen wasted on Turkey, Poland, and Denmark was concentrated with triumphant\r\nsuccess in this dispatch. The despotic Powers held their hands, and the\r\nItalian nation was enabled to work out its own destiny.\r\n\r\nOne more controversy arose during the Palmerston era, and it tested English\r\nLiberalism as severely as any other. This was the American Civil War, which\r\nbroke out in 1861 and continued until 1864. It was easy for a Liberal to\r\nfind a logical reason for taking either side. He might support the North,\r\nbecause it was fighting to suppress slavery. He might support the South,\r\nbecause it was fighting for local independence against a central tyranny.\r\nThe States were all legally independent except for certain common purposes\r\nof defence. It was thus very plausibly argued that it was the duty of a\r\nLiberal to support the South in its claim to secede from the Union which\r\ninterfered with its internal affairs. Though it was not the business of\r\nEngland to go to war with the North, it could easily be squared with the\r\ndoctrines of men like Canning that she should formally recognize the\r\nindependence of the South as soon as it appeared to be achieved. When the\r\nissues were thus confused, English statesmen were dangerously vague in\r\ntheir language and their conduct. Toryism and the governing class took the\r\nside of the South, which in its aristocratic temper differed from the North\r\nmuch as they themselves differed from the Manchester School. Russell and\r\nGladstone took the false Liberal view, and inclined towards recognition.\r\nThe Manchester men were severely injured by the blockade of the Southern\r\nports and the consequent dearth of cotton, and many of them may have hoped,\r\neven against their convictions, that the Government would take such an easy\r\nway of ending the war. The situation was highly dangerous. The North were\r\nfighting for national unity. They were fighting to keep within the Union\r\npeople who wanted to secede only to maintain the most infamous of all human\r\ninstitutions save one. The war was not a war between nations. The\r\nSoutherners were {228} a class, not a people. The war was a war between two\r\ncivilizations, one based on free labour, the other on slavery. The\r\nintervention of England would have meant war on behalf of the bad old\r\nsystem against that which was most in harmony with her own. So long as the\r\nissue in the States was doubtful the risk remained. Confederate privateers\r\nwere fitted out in English ports, and the Government was scandalously\r\nremiss in taking steps to stop them. Mr. Gladstone in 1862 made an\r\nindiscreet speech which hinted at recognition, and the American Ambassador\r\nnearly sent in his papers. The one public man who kept his head cool and\r\nhis vision clear was John Bright, who spoke unceasingly against the\r\napproval of slavery. But it was reserved for some nameless men and women to\r\nmake the noblest display of wisdom which came from England during the war.\r\nThe condition of the people of Lancashire would have been little worse than\r\nit was if every one of their cotton-mills had been swept from the face of\r\nthe earth. Practically the whole of the cotton operatives and their\r\nfamilies lived for months together upon charity. If any had cause to\r\nclamour for recognition and the defeat of the North, it was they. But in\r\nthe midst of their distress this magnificent race stood by its principles.\r\nNo saint or philosopher ever betrayed a greater fortitude than these poor\r\nand simple workfolk. While the merchant princes of Liverpool clamoured for\r\nwar, and sent their clerks to howl at Henry Ward Beecher when he pleaded\r\nthe cause of the North, the suffering populace of East Lancashire made no\r\ncomplaint. At one meeting at Manchester they even passed a resolution of\r\nsympathy with the North. This is probably the noblest thing that has ever\r\nbeen done in the world. It is not uncommon for men and women, in the\r\nexcitement of war and in defence of their homes and children, to sacrifice\r\nthemselves and all they have. But the act of the Lancashire workfolk was\r\ndone in cold blood, and in defiance of every natural impulse. There is\r\nnothing more majestic in human records than the spectacle of these starving\r\nmen and women, gathered in the very shadow of their dark and silent mills\r\nto encourage those whose success meant the continuing of their own\r\nmiseries. The {229} use of such a people as this in support of the Southern\r\nStates would have been a monstrous crime. The final triumph of the North\r\nsaved the Government from such a fatal error and made the recognition of\r\nthe independence of the South unnecessary by making it impossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{230}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE GLADSTONE PERIOD\r\n\r\nThe Palmerston era was now at an end, and that of Gladstone was beginning.\r\nThe first had been a period of domestic indifference and external\r\nagitation. Energy at home and restraint abroad were the marks of the first\r\nLiberal Ministry. The dominating force in practical politics was a man who\r\nderived his principles from a mixture of sound stocks. A temperate foreign\r\npolicy, a rigorous economy in expenditure, and a dislike of commercial\r\ninterference and restriction he had inherited from Sir Robert Peel.\r\nBeginning his career as a strong Churchman, he had gradually acquired the\r\nold Whig liberality in religious matters. \"I think it,\" he wrote in 1865,\r\n\"a most formidable responsibility in these times to doubt any man's\r\ncharacter on account of his opinions. The limit of possible variation\r\nbetween character and opinion, ay, between character and belief, is\r\nwidening, and will widen.\"[280] To belief in popular government he seems to\r\nhave approached of his own nature, and he shared with Bright the honours of\r\nleadership in the new agitation for Reform. His party was compounded in\r\nmuch the same way of the different schools, old Whig doctrines of freedom\r\nof opinion, Palmerston's enthusiasm for nationalities, and the Manchester\r\nSchool's dislike of foreign affairs and preference for domestic interests\r\ncombining in a general theory of individual and national liberty, which for\r\nthe first time approached complete Liberalism. In two directions {231} the\r\npolicy of the new school of thought showed a distinct advance upon any of\r\nits predecessors. Its conception of freedom was less pedantic than that of\r\nBenthamites or Manchester men, and it was not afraid to imitate the methods\r\nof State interference which Tory philanthropy alone had previously ventured\r\nto employ. This new spirit combined with the regard for nationalities to\r\nproduce an entirely novel policy in Ireland, where peculiar diseases were\r\nat last met with peculiar remedies.\r\n\r\nThe policy of economic reconstruction, which was first seriously undertaken\r\nby the Liberal Ministry of 1868, was undertaken largely in response to\r\npressure from a new section of society. The Reform Act of 1832 had\r\nenfranchised the L10 householder. The Representation of the People Act of\r\n1867 enfranchised every town-dweller who paid rates. The first gave power\r\nto the middle class. The second gave power to the working class. The\r\nartisans, whose political agitation had died out in the Chartist movement\r\nof 1848, had devoted their energies since that date to the development of\r\ntheir industrial organizations. In 1863 Holyoake started an \"Association\r\nfor the Promotion of Co-operation,\" and in 1869 the Co-operative Societies\r\nhad a total capital of L2,000,000, and an annual trade of L8,000,000. A\r\nsimilar growth had taken place in the case of Trade Unions. Between 1855\r\nand 1865 the numbers of Trade Unionists seem to have been more than\r\ndoubled, and Unions which in 1870 contained 142,000 members, had 266,000 in\r\n1875.[281] This form of organization was even more directly political than\r\nco-operation in the manufacture or supply of goods. It was frequently\r\nbrought into conflict with legal theories about conspiracy, restraint of\r\ntrade, intimidation, and breach of contract; and the necessity of amending\r\nthe existing law was apparent.\r\n\r\nThis growth of organizations had produced a great increase of intelligence\r\nand influence among the better sort of working men. In thus managing\r\naffairs on a large scale, they had developed a capacity for political\r\ncontrol which was very different from the vaguer discontent of an earlier\r\ngeneration. They were now {232} organized and disciplined, and their demand\r\nfor enfranchisement could no longer be ignored or despised. The American\r\nCivil War had aroused their interest in politics, and the fortitude with\r\nwhich some of them had borne the sufferings of the time had done much to\r\ndisarm opposition. Bright's agitation at last found a response, and in 1866\r\nthe Whig Government introduced a Reform Bill. The Ministry, deprived of\r\nPalmerston, collapsed before the Bill could be carried, and by a cynical\r\nsacrifice of the very Tory principles which had defeated the Whig Bill, the\r\nTory Ministry of Lord Derby and Disraeli passed the Bill of 1867 into law.\r\nWith the Tory leader himself supporting the Bill, the voice of Toryism was\r\nnot loudly raised against it. Lord Robert Cecil, who soon afterwards became\r\nLord Salisbury, was the most bitter of the independent men behind Disraeli,\r\nand he was rivalled, if not surpassed, by the Radical Robert Lowe. Party\r\ndiscipline kept most of the Tories quiet, and there was no general\r\nopposition on the other side. Disraeli cared little for his own Bill,\r\nexcept as a means of \"dishing the Whigs,\" and Gladstone and Bright were the\r\nreal champions of the measure, in and out of Parliament. \"The working men,\"\r\nsaid the latter, \"in thinking over this question, feel they are distrusted,\r\nthat they are marked as inferiors, that they are a sort of pariahs.\"[282]\r\nThe former roused the contempt of Lord Cranborne by describing the workmen\r\nas \"our own flesh and blood.\" The issue, in short, was simply that of all\r\ndisputes about the franchise. Was the governing class for the time being to\r\nadmit that the other was capable of managing its own affairs, or was it to\r\ndeclare that there was some essential difference between them which made\r\nits own ascendancy necessary? Disraeli was not, in these matters, a Tory,\r\nand with Liberal support he carried his Bill. It was a job, without any\r\ngenuine enthusiasm to inspire it, but it had its Liberal effect. The\r\nartisans obtained fuller control over their own lives, and the Liberal\r\nGovernment which they set up in 1868 expressed for the first time the\r\nwishes of their class in legislation.\r\n\r\n{233}\r\n\r\nIt is necessary at this point to refer to two forces which were acting upon\r\nthe political machine. The first, Socialism, was a diffused influence,\r\noperating among the working classes. The other, the teaching of John Stuart\r\nMill, was a definite intellectual impulse, which worked directly upon the\r\nminds of men of education. Socialism has never been accepted as a creed by\r\nthe majority of British working men, and its hard, logical reasoning will\r\nprobably always prove as alien to them as Philosophic Radicalism was to the\r\nmiddle class. It had been expressed for a short time in the co-operative\r\nexperiment of Robert Owen, and it came into prominence at the time of the\r\nFrench Revolution of 1830. But its direct proclamation that the system of\r\nprivate capital meant the abuse of wage-earners, and that it was only where\r\nthe whole people owned and controlled the means of production,\r\ndistribution, and exchange that the poorer section could get economic\r\nsecurity, was never popular. The Chartist movement had a purely political\r\nprogramme of annual Parliaments, payment of members, the ballot, and other\r\nconstitutional reforms. Practical Socialism, the direct interference of the\r\nState in order to improve economic conditions, was concentrated after the\r\nReform Act of 1832 in the Tory philanthropists. Lord Shaftesbury hated\r\nSocialism as a creed. But in opposing a Secular Education Bill of 1850 he\r\nused the very arguments by which Socialists justified their demand for the\r\nnationalization of capital: \"The honourable and learned member seemed to\r\nthink that crime was to be traced in almost all instances to want of\r\neducation; no doubt that was in many cases a source of crime, but it was\r\nnot the only, nor the chief source. Want of employment was the source of a\r\nvast proportion of crime. The condition in which the people lived, the\r\ninfluences to which they were subjected, the sunken and immoral state of a\r\nvast number of parents, rendered it next to impossible to produce any\r\npermanent improvement in many brought into our schools; and so long as you\r\nshould leave the condition of your great towns, in all their sanitary,\r\nsocial, and domestic arrangements, such as at present, a large proportion\r\nof your efforts would be vain, {234} and the education you could give\r\nnearly fruitless.\"[283] This was not Socialism. But it was the recognition\r\nof the fact that the individual would have no chance of honest growth\r\nunless society co-operated to improve the conditions in which he lived.\r\n\r\nThe general attitude of legislators towards the spirit of Socialism was\r\nvery different. The Tories were largely moved to oppose it by its alliance\r\nwith free thought. In 1833 the Bishop of Exeter formally moved that the\r\nGovernment should take steps to suppress it. The Bishop of London said that\r\n\"The Government, as a Christian Government, were called upon in the\r\nexercise of their parental functions to interpose a shield between these\r\npernicious doctrines and the minds of those who were more than the rest of\r\nsociety liable to the dominion of passion.\"[284] Wellington gravely\r\nreferred to the \"atrocious character\" of the Socialist Associations, which\r\ndecoyed the people away from church by inviting them to Sunday dances. The\r\nWhig Ministry then declined to interfere with the propagation of any\r\nopinions, however obnoxious. But their intellectual hostility was as marked\r\nas that of Wellington himself. In 1852, after the French Revolution of\r\n1848, with its disastrous attempt to provide work for all at the expense of\r\nthe State, had brought the new doctrines again into prominence, Macaulay\r\ndeclined with great vigour to have anything to do with \"Fourierism, or St.\r\nSimonianism, or Socialism, or any of those other 'isms,' for which the\r\nplain English word is 'robbery.'\"[285] Whigs and Tories, whatever their\r\nopinions about free thought, were at least united in their determination to\r\nbrook no interference with private property.\r\n\r\nThe real English Socialism was of a more practical kind than the\r\ndoctrinaire Socialism of Continental thinkers like Lassalle and Marx. The\r\nchief spokesman was Thomas Carlyle, who was a philosopher rather than a\r\npolitician, and rather created a {235} new spirit in men than contrived for\r\nthem any practical expedients. He never concealed his contempt for the\r\nordinary politician, and had more in common with a Tory like Shaftesbury\r\nthan with Whigs, Radicals, or political workmen.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs were \"the grand dilettanti\" or \"lukewarm, withered mongrels.\" The\r\nRadicals were \"ballot-boxing on the graves of heroic ancestors.\" The mass\r\nof the people were \"the rotten multitudinous canaille,\" and manhood\r\nsuffrage was as reasonable as \"horsehood and doghood suffrage.\" The world\r\ncould only be saved by the hero, and the best thing mankind could do was to\r\nentrust itself to the unfettered genius of its great men. All this, and\r\nmuch more wild abuse sprang from Carlyle's violent indignation against\r\nindividualism. He had no respect either for the aristocratic neglect of the\r\nWhigs or for the philosophical basis of the school of _laissez faire_. For\r\nthe conception of society as a collection of competing individuals,\r\nprotected in their competition by the State, he endeavoured to substitute a\r\nconception of society as a mass of mutually dependent individuals, united\r\nby \"organic filaments,\" the weaker aided and protected by the State against\r\nthe competition of the stronger, and the whole rising and falling,\r\nadvancing and retreating together. \"Call that yet a society,\" he exclaimed,\r\n\"where there is no longer any social idea extant; not so much as the idea\r\nof a Common Home, but only of a common overcrowded Lodging House? Where\r\neach isolated, regardless of his neighbour, turned against his neighbour,\r\nclutches what he can get, and cries 'Mine,' and calls it Peace, because in\r\nthe cut-purse and cut-throat scramble no steel knives but only a far\r\ncunninger sort can be employed.\"[286] This is not scientific Socialism,\r\nwith its logical formulae, the evolution of economic structures, the\r\nultimate nationalization of all the means of production, distribution and\r\nexchange, and the rest. But it is a passionate appeal, in the very spirit\r\nof Socialism, to the sense of brotherhood, to the feeling that every man\r\nhas as much right as every other not to be left behind in the race of\r\nindustrial {236} competition, and that the State, the organization of\r\nSociety for common purposes, should not be confined merely to negative\r\nfunctions, but should be made the active and positive instrument of the\r\nimprovement of human life.\r\n\r\nCarlyle presented a curious contrast of the aristocrat and the democrat.\r\nHis feeling was all for the people. But it was to be carried into practical\r\neffect by despotic or oligarchic methods. No man ever saw more clearly the\r\nmiseries of poverty, or felt more acutely the degradation of worth by\r\nexternal circumstances. \"Through every living soul the glory of a present\r\nGod still beams.\" But he was convinced that misery could not be entrusted\r\nwith the instruments of its own relief. The two habits of mind, the\r\nsympathetic and the disposing, were in him united. His contempt for\r\npolitical democracy was bound up with his zeal for social democracy, his\r\nrecognition of the equal worth of all with his determination not to give\r\nthem equal power. The generation in which he wrote based all its hopes upon\r\npolitics. Political reform was everything. Once enfranchised, the\r\npopulation would be able to protect itself against aggression, and its\r\ndistress would come automatically to an end. Carlyle saw, what the Whigs,\r\nthe Radicals, and the Manchester men could not or would not see, that this\r\nnegative operation of the vote, this power of defence against interference\r\nby others, was of little use for his immediate purpose, the economic\r\nreconstruction of society, and he declared in his haste that it was of no\r\nuse. Political reform did not go deep enough, and Carlyle drove violently\r\ninto the camp of opposition. There was no hope except in the hero, the man\r\nof extraordinary understanding and strength, who could both detect the\r\ncauses of human suffering and compel society to abate them.\r\n\r\nIt was this emotional appeal of Carlyle which made him such a powerful\r\nforce among thoughtful men and women, and especially among those whom\r\nexperience had made acquainted with the worst effects of the industrial\r\nrevolution. His hero-worship gave no little encouragement to the more\r\nbrutal sort of Toryism, and there are still many English people who believe\r\n{237} that the history of a nation is only the biography of its great men.\r\nBut his insistence upon the direct responsibility of the social\r\norganization for the happiness of every one within it was in the line of a\r\nreaction against crude individualism, which by 1850 was strongly marked\r\noutside Tory philanthropy. Mrs. Gaskell's _Mary Barton_, a novel which\r\ndealt sympathetically with industrial unrest, was published in 1848.\r\nHarriet Martineau, identified with Whiggery and the Manchester School,\r\nwrote in 1849 of the state of the wage-earners: \"A social idea or system\r\nwhich compels such a state of things as this must be, in so far, worn out.\r\nIn ours, it is clear that some renovation is wanted, and must be\r\nfound.\"[287] In 1850 the Christian Socialist movement in the Church of\r\nEngland produced the _Tracts on Christian Socialism_ and Charles Kingsley's\r\nnovel _Alton Locke_. Dickens published his _Hard Times_ in 1854, and\r\nconstantly attacked the system of _laissez faire_ in the columns of\r\n_Household Words_. Ruskin, with less political instinct, pleaded as\r\npassionately for beauty in common life as for ethical principles in art,\r\nand, like his master Carlyle, clothed his economic sermons in a style which\r\nput the cold reasoning of individualism to shame. Even Disraeli, who\r\ncombined unusual moral levity with an unusual capacity for discovering the\r\nset of social currents, gave utterance to similar opinions in _Sybil_ and\r\nother novels. By the time that the working men were enfranchised in 1867,\r\nthe Parliamentary work of Lord Shaftesbury was being accompanied by a\r\ngeneral movement in society. Negative Liberalism, the removal of\r\nrestrictions upon the individual, had obviously produced little direct good\r\namong the poorer people. It was time that humane and generous impulses in\r\nthe direction of positive assistance had their way. The difference between\r\nthe new Liberalism and the old was the difference between emancipation and\r\ntoleration, between leaving alone and setting free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influence of John Stuart Mill was not so much in the direction of\r\ndefinite changes in society as in the direction of {238} an alteration of\r\nmental processes by which such changes became possible. Liberal thinkers\r\nlike Paine and Bentham had assailed the human mind from without, clamouring\r\nabout its gates with completely fashioned ideas, which they endeavoured to\r\nthrust into it by a sort of intellectual assault. They had no doubts of\r\ntheir own rightness or of the duty of others to agree with them. Mill,\r\nchiefly through his acquaintance with the evolutionary ideas of Comte, was\r\nof a more tolerant disposition, and preferred to adopt the method of\r\ngetting to understand how his adversary's error had arisen, and of\r\npersuading him, as it were, to retrace his steps, and by choosing another\r\nroad, arrive at a sounder conclusion. His book on Logic was an attempt to\r\nalter the prevailing system of intuitional philosophy, by which he believed\r\nthat prejudices and the dictates of interest were assumed to be absolute\r\ntruths, and to substitute for it a system in which every idea might be\r\nthoroughly examined and tested before it was adopted. In other words, he\r\nproposed to do with the conceptions of philosophy what Bentham proposed to\r\ndo with institutions, to accept none, except on their merits. He thus hoped\r\nto produce, not definitely new ideas, but a condition of mind to which new\r\nideas would not be repugnant. This method of undermining his adversary's\r\nposition was his method in politics as in general philosophy.\r\n\r\nMill was the son of a Utilitarian, and was himself a disciple of Bentham.\r\nBut he never accepted the Benthamite theory without qualification. He knew\r\nthat men were actuated by other motives, good and bad, than self-interest.\r\nHe did not believe that by setting all men free to pursue their own\r\ninterest the majority would achieve happiness. He did not believe that it\r\nwas enough in politics to enfranchise every person of twenty-one years of\r\nage, or that a democracy might not be guilty of as abominable tyranny as a\r\ndespot or an oligarchy. He held most of the Benthamite principles, as\r\nforming the best working philosophy, but he never supposed that they would\r\nnot require safeguards against abuse, or would inevitably produce the\r\ndesired result. Bentham said, \"This individual is actuated by this {239}\r\nmotive; apply this remedy to his condition, and he will develop himself to\r\nthis point.\" Mill said, \"This individual seems to be actuated by various\r\nmotives, of which this seems to be the most important, his history and the\r\nexperience of other individuals suggests that if this remedy is applied to\r\nhis condition he will tend to develop himself to this point. I will\r\ntherefore make the experiment.\" Bentham was always confident and dogmatic.\r\nMill was never more than patient and hopeful.\r\n\r\nMill in effect combined the qualities of the historical and the critical\r\nschools of thought. His was not the vigorous hammering method of previous\r\nLiberals, but a cold, illuminating, and suggestive examination, which gave\r\nfull credit to the existing institution, even while it displayed its\r\ndefects. He asked, \"How has it grown?\" as earnestly as \"How does it work?\"\r\nand he lamented the indifference of his predecessors to history. \"No one\r\ncan calculate what struggles, which the cause of improvement has yet to\r\nundergo, might have been spared if the philosophers of the eighteenth\r\ncentury had done anything like justice to the past.\"[288] Every institution\r\nis to be studied historically, though it must be justified empirically. If\r\nit is bad in use, it must be reformed or abolished, but the change must be\r\nmade along the line of past growth. What he said of the position of women\r\nhe applied to every other problem. \"The least that can be demanded is, that\r\nthe question should not be considered as prejudged by existing fact and\r\nexisting opinion, but open to discussion on its merits, as a question of\r\njustice and expediency; the decision on this, as on any of the other social\r\narrangements of mankind, depending on what an enlightened estimate of\r\ntendencies and consequences may show to be most advantageous to humanity in\r\ngeneral.... Through all the progressive period of human history, the\r\ncondition of women has been approaching nearer to equality with men. This\r\ndoes not of itself prove that the assimilation must go on to complete\r\nequality, but it assuredly affords some presumption that such is the\r\ncase.\"[289] This double view, combining the Radical view of Bentham with\r\nthe historical {240} view of Burke, enabled Mill to see his subject, as it\r\nwere, stereoscopically and in true relation with its surroundings. He was\r\nnot influenced by Darwin's theory of evolution. But his own work produced a\r\nvery similar effect. It made men accustomed to the idea of continuous\r\nalteration, of future as well as past growth.\r\n\r\nMill was thus the most prominent thinker of a time in which old systems of\r\nthought were being undermined. Natural science and the higher criticism\r\nwere breaking up the foundations of authority in religion, and Mill's\r\ngeneral method of dealing with habits of thought, no less than the direct\r\nplea for free thinking and free speaking contained in his treatise on\r\n_Liberty_, gave a wider scope to honest scepticism. He expressed approval\r\nof some of the new Socialistic projects. He was in favour of compulsory\r\neducation, of the regulation of hours of labour, of Trade Unionism and\r\nco-operation, and he looked forward to a time \"when the division of the\r\nproduce of labour, instead of depending, as in so great a degree it now\r\ndoes, on the accident of birth, will be made in concert on an acknowledged\r\nprinciple of justice.\" The social problem of the future, he said, would be\r\n\"how to unite the greatest individual liberty of action with a common\r\nownership of the new material of the globe, and an equal participation of\r\nall in the benefits of combined labour.\"[290] His most original\r\ncontribution to politics was his appeal for absolute equality of freedom\r\nfor men and women, which was the first effective attempt to remove the\r\nclass brand from women, and to abolish the aristocracy of sex. But his most\r\nvaluable work, as has already been suggested, was not so much to sow new\r\npolitical ideas in the minds of his followers as to plough them for the\r\nreception of such ideas. He did not so much start them along new paths as\r\nset them to inquire whether they were right in remaining in the old, and\r\nwhether there was any real danger in leaving them. As solvents of\r\nprejudice, Mill's works have not been surpassed by any. He promoted, not\r\nchange, but the readiness to change; not Liberal measures, but {241}\r\nLiberal-mindedness. Thus persuaded to refrain from hasty judgments upon\r\nopinions, and to accept every new idea upon its merits, the rising\r\ngeneration applied itself to the working of the improved political machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Liberalism of the Government which was in power from 1868 to 1874 was\r\ndisplayed in the further application of old principles, no less than in the\r\nadoption of principles which were new. Religious equality was expressed in\r\ntheir Irish policy and in their treatment of education. Reforms in the\r\nCivil Service and the Army abolished more class distinctions in the public\r\nservice. The new School Boards were another example of popular control of\r\nGovernment. Acts dealing with Trade Unions and the ownership of Irish land\r\nexpressed the new theory of State interference with individual liberty, and\r\nActs referring to women marked a great appreciation of them in comparison\r\nwith men.\r\n\r\nOne old principle was the basis of the Ballot Act of 1872. This gave to\r\ndependent persons the power of voting freely in the choice of their\r\nrepresentatives, without fear of landlords, employers, or customers. The\r\nproject was as old as the agitation for manhood suffrage, and was first\r\nsuggested in the days of Wilkes and the Society of the Friends of the Bill\r\nof Rights. Other impediments to individual freedom were removed in 1870,\r\nwhen all posts in the Civil Service, outside the Foreign Office, were\r\nopened to competitive examination; and in 1871, when the system of\r\npurchasing commissions in the Army was abolished. Two preserves of\r\naristocracy and wealth were thus thrown open to the people at large. Direct\r\naid was given to the poorer classes by the establishment of a national\r\nsystem of education in 1870. This had been first suggested by Whitbread,\r\nand gained the support of Bentham, the Whigs, and the Manchester School.\r\nTories like Lord Shaftesbury had been in favour of it so long as nothing\r\nwas done to limit the privileges of the Church, and there had been no\r\nreason, other than indifference, why the parsimonious grants out of the\r\nExchequer should not {242} have been increased long before. By this time\r\nthe neglect of the poorer children and the complete failure of private\r\nenterprise had become conspicuous. Two million children received no\r\neducation at all, one million received an education which was inadequate,\r\nand only one million three hundred thousand were educated in schools aided\r\nand inspected by the State.[291] The system was now made general, and the\r\nlocal control was placed in the hands of School Boards, elected by the\r\nratepayers, and empowered to provide for the expenses of their districts by\r\nlevying a rate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old Liberal principle of equality between sects, implied in the Irish\r\nChurch Act, was expressed more simply in an Act of 1871, which abolished\r\nall theological tests for professors, fellows, tutors, and scholars of\r\nOxford and Cambridge, except in the Theological Faculties. The exception\r\nwas a characteristic revelation of Mr. Gladstone's influence. If absolute\r\nfreedom of religious thinking is required more in one place than in\r\nanother, it is in a school of divinity. But the Churchman was still\r\ninvolved in the Liberal Prime Minister, and the theological honours and\r\noffices were left to the dominant creed. The exception was not of much\r\ngeneral importance, and the Act removed the principal disabilities which\r\nhad fettered the mind of the Universities no less than they had hindered\r\nthe education of Nonconformists. This Act was passed with little\r\nopposition, even from the Lords. The great conflict of religious principle\r\ntook place over the Education Act, which, like most of its predecessors and\r\nsuccessors, might have been more aptly styled the \"Religious Difficulty in\r\nSchools Act.\" The problem was not educational at all. A substantial\r\nmajority of all parties would have agreed upon a scheme of national secular\r\neducation in a few hours. But the course of events had determined that the\r\nchildren's minds should appear less important to Parliament than their\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nA logical Liberal, faced with the task of establishing a national system of\r\neducation, could take only the course which was {243} advocated by the\r\nBirmingham League. That was to make education free, compulsory, and\r\nsecular. No one should pay for education except as a taxpayer, all should\r\nbe compelled to send their children to school, and no form of religious\r\nopinion should be taught. This would have secured all the benefits of\r\nsecular learning and discipline, without compelling the member of one sect\r\nto contribute to the propagation of the opinions of another, and without\r\ncompelling a child to be instructed in opinions which were obnoxious to its\r\nparents. But it was impossible for logic to have its way. Schools had been\r\nestablished in some districts for many years. The majority taught the\r\ndoctrines of the Establishment. Others were Wesleyan, others Unitarian,\r\nothers Catholic, others Jewish. Most of these had already enjoyed State\r\naid, though they had been built by voluntary subscription. It was\r\nimpossible to ignore their existence. It was impossible also to ignore the\r\nfact that the majority of the English people, in a rough and ready way,\r\ndesired that some sort of religion should be taught in the schools. There\r\nwas no way out except in a compromise, and the difficulty thus acknowledged\r\nhas never yet been removed. State aid was given to sectarian schools as\r\nwell as Board Schools, and by the since famous Cowper Temple clause it was\r\nprovided that no distinctive religious formulary should be taught in a\r\nBoard School. This was not pure Liberalism. Nonconformists might object, as\r\nthey had always objected, to paying for the propagation of obnoxious\r\ndogmas. Churchmen and Catholics might object, with equal reason, to paying\r\nfor the propagation of opinions which were obnoxious because they contained\r\nno dogmas at all. Between the devil of dogma and the deep sea of\r\nNonconformity no English Government has yet found a way. But the sects have\r\nhad to live together in the country, and the compromise of 1870, though it\r\nsettled nothing, was as good an arrangement as could have been made at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Education Act was an obvious interference of Government with absolute\r\nliberty, and the argument that this measure {244} of control was only\r\nundertaken in order to equip the individual for the better enjoyment of\r\nliberty was an argument which would have applied to Socialism itself. But\r\nthis Act was only a continuation of previous policy. The Trades Union Act\r\nof 1871 was a contrivance of an entirely new sort, and the support given to\r\nit by the Liberal Ministry meant a great change. Previous legislation had\r\nmarked an alteration in the attitude of the State towards combinations of\r\nworkmen, and the Act of 1871 carried the change a degree farther. The Acts\r\nof 1799 and 1800 had prohibited Trade Unions. The Acts of 1824 and 1825 had\r\npermitted them. The Act of 1871 protected them and gave them special\r\nprivileges. This was the direct consequence of pressure by organized\r\nworkmen, assisted by members of the middle class like Thomas Hughes and\r\nFrederic Harrison. Decisions of the judges had tended to cripple labour\r\norganizations by declaring strikes to be intimidation, and peaceful\r\npicketing a nuisance, and by holding that workmen acting in combination\r\nmight be guilty of the crime of conspiracy, even though they did nothing\r\nwhich would have been a crime in the case of a single person. One decision\r\nhad declared that a Trade Union, being an association in restraint of\r\ntrade, was illegal, and that an official who embezzled its funds could not\r\nbe sued by the Society.\r\n\r\nThese judicial attacks were only part of a campaign which was now being\r\nwaged against the whole system of Trade Unionism. The workmen were\r\nbeginning to make their strength felt, and the old legal dislike of\r\ninterference with liberty joined with the less disinterested objections of\r\nemployers to anything which interfered with their power to do as they liked\r\nwith their capital and their labourers. Some serious outrages, committed by\r\nthe smaller organizations of a few towns like Sheffield and Manchester,\r\ngave colour to the general indictment of combinations of this sort. As a\r\nmatter of fact nothing stood between the most moral and responsible workmen\r\nand exploitation by the worse sort of masters but his Trade Union. Absolute\r\nfreedom to sell his labour as he pleased meant for the ordinary workman\r\nabsolute freedom to be abused by an economic superior. The Trade {245}\r\nUnion was the workman's only means of obtaining security of life. \"Any one\r\nwho regards it as a simple instrument to raise wages,\" wrote Mr. Frederic\r\nHarrison, \"is, as Adam Smith says, 'as ignorant of the subject as of human\r\nnature.' Unionism, above all, aims at making regular, even, and safe the\r\nworkman's life. No one who had not specially studied it would conceive the\r\nvast array of grievances against which Unionism and strikes are directed.\r\nIf we looked only to that side of the question, we should come to fancy\r\nthat from the whole field of labour there went up one universal protest\r\nagainst injustice. There is a 'miserable monotony' of wrong and suffering\r\nin it. Excessive labour, irregular labour, spasmodic overwork, spasmodic\r\nlocking-out, 'overtime,' 'short time,' double time, night work, Sunday\r\nwork, truck in every form, overlookers' extortion, payment in kind, wages\r\nreduced by drawbacks, 'long pays,' or wages held back, fines,\r\nconfiscations, rent and implements irregularly stopped out of wages,\r\nevictions from tenements, 'black lists' of men, short weights, false\r\nreckoning, forfeits, children's labour, women's labour, unhealthy labour,\r\ndeadly factories and processes, unguarded machinery, defective machinery,\r\npreventable accidents, recklessness from desire to save,--in countless ways\r\nwe find a waste of human life, health, well-being, and power, which are not\r\nrepresented in the ledgers or allowed for in bargains.\"[292] In other\r\nwords, the law, by a pedantic application of rules of abstract liberty, was\r\ndepriving workmen of real liberty. Liberty of contract did not mean liberty\r\nof life, and it was only by sacrificing individual freedom to the common\r\ngood in organization that real freedom was to be secured.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1871 partly remedied the evil. Trade Unions, if there were\r\nnothing criminal in their expressed objects, were allowed to be registered,\r\nand could then enjoy the rights over their funds which were possessed by\r\nFriendly Societies. But they were given absolute freedom in their internal\r\norganization, and no action at law could be brought against them. These\r\nchanges in {246} the law were unfortunately almost nullified by a Criminal\r\nLaw Amendment Act which practically gave statutory force to many of the\r\nrecent legal decisions. Strikes were made legal, but everything done in\r\npursuance of a strike was illegal, and working men and women were\r\nfrequently imprisoned after 1871 for the most trivial acts, even while the\r\nserious boycotting of workpeople by employers was freely permitted. It is a\r\ngreat blot on the reputation of the Government, still dominated by the\r\nmiddle class and its dislike of combination, that it refused to complete\r\nthe work which it had begun, and to enable Trade Unions not only to exist,\r\nbut to work. At the General Election of 1874 two workmen, Alexander\r\nMacdonald and Thomas Burt, were actually elected to the House of Commons,\r\nand the roused feeling of the Unionists gained its object. The Conservative\r\nHome Secretary repealed the disabling Act, peaceful picketing was\r\nlegalized, and workmen in combination were no longer punishable except for\r\nacts which were criminal if committed by single individuals. The strength\r\ngained by the Unions in this brief campaign finally established them in the\r\nindustrial and political life of the country. The political reforms did not\r\ndirectly improve the condition of the working classes. But many, if not\r\nall, the improvements which subsequently took place, were only possible in\r\nthe state of real freedom which the Acts of 1871 and 1874 had established.\r\n\r\nOne attempt to interfere with the absolute liberty of the individual\r\nfailed. This was the Licensing Bill of 1871, which proposed to reduce the\r\nnumber of public-houses in the country. The departure from the old line was\r\nvery marked. There had never been absolute freedom of trade in strong\r\ndrink. From the earliest years alehouses had been licensed and supervised\r\nby magistrates. But their numbers in all parts of the country were more\r\nthan was required for any reasonable consumption by the population. In\r\nLiverpool a disastrous experiment had been tried. Licences had been granted\r\nto every person of good character who chose to apply, on the assumption\r\nthat unrestricted competition would lead to good management and the\r\nextinction of the worst class of house by competition. A principle which\r\nwas abundantly {247} successful in the cotton industry proved a helpless\r\nfailure in the drink trade. There was no unhealthy demand for cotton goods.\r\nIt did not depend on a natural instinct which might be increased by supply\r\nbeyond the needs of health. To multiply drink-shops was to multiply, for\r\nmany of the people who dealt with them, the temptations to demoralizing\r\nexcess of consumption. The Liverpool experiment showed the folly of\r\n_laissez faire_ in a matter of this sort. The Licensing Bill of 1871\r\nexpressed the opposite policy. It proposed to reduce the number of houses\r\nin each district to that which the justices thought was enough for its\r\nlegitimate needs. The licences, though generally renewed, were granted for\r\none year only. For ten years they were to be continued, subject to a small\r\nannual payment by the licensees. After the expiration of that period the\r\njustices were to fix the number for the district, and, in virtue of the\r\nartificial monopoly which the licences conferred, were to distribute them\r\namong such respectable persons as offered the highest prices. These\r\nproposals were as vigorous an interference with individual liberty as was\r\nconsistent with existing rights. The holders of licences had no legal right\r\nto more than a year's profits from their licences. Custom had given them an\r\nexpectancy of indefinite length. The public interest required that their\r\nnumbers should be reduced. Reduction was therefore proposed, but after a\r\nsubstantial delay. The scheme was just in principle and generous in\r\npractice. But the extreme advocates of temperance legislation objected to\r\nits generosity, and the brewers and licensed victuallers objected to its\r\njustice. The Home Secretary, Mr. Bruce, was not strong enough to carry it.\r\nIt was abandoned soon after its introduction, and a priceless opportunity\r\nof at once improving the conditions of town life and of subduing a powerful\r\ntrade interest to the public was lost for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most difficult of the Ministry's problems was the Irish problem, and\r\nthe most novel of its proposals were its Irish proposals. Judged by the\r\ndegree of their success, these measures were perhaps not very important. At\r\nleast, they did not settle the affairs of Ireland. But their spirit was of\r\nthe greatest possible {248} significance. This Liberal Government was the\r\nfirst English Government which ever set itself to legislate for Ireland\r\naccording to Irish ideas, to recognize the essential differences between\r\nthe two countries, to establish in Ireland what it would not maintain in\r\nEngland, and to destroy in Ireland those English institutions which had\r\nbeen erected by the egoism of its predecessors. The existing system was\r\nrecognized as hopeless. In February, 1868, the Tory Government suspended\r\nthe Habeas Corpus Act for the fourth time in two years. Fenianism was\r\nchecked, but the disease of which it was a symptom was not cured. The\r\nLiberals endeavoured to go to the root of the matter. The maintenance of\r\norder was only a condition of further action, and the only possible further\r\naction was the redress of grievances.\r\n\r\nThe case of Ireland had for a long time caused anxiety to Liberal thinkers.\r\nIn 1835 Cobden had contrasted England's readiness to sympathize with Poland\r\nand Greece with her complete indifference to the claims of Ireland. \"Whilst\r\nour diplomatists, fleets, and armies have been put in motion at enormous\r\ncost, to carry our counsel, or, if needful, our arms, to the assistance of\r\nthe people of these remote regions, it is an unquestionable fact, that the\r\npopulation of a great portion of our own Empire has, at the same time,\r\npresented a grosser spectacle of moral and physical debasement than is to\r\nbe met with in the whole civilized world.\"[293] Disraeli in 1844 declared\r\nthat it was the duty of an English Minister \"To effect by his policy all\r\nthose changes which a revolution would accomplish by force.\"[294] In 1847\r\nBright pointed to the root cause: \"There is an unanimous admission now that\r\nthe misfortunes of Ireland are connected with the question of the\r\nmanagement of the land.\"[295] The rejection of Peel's Bill of 1845 has\r\nalready been noticed. The only measure passed for the relief of Irish\r\ntenants since that date was the Encumbered Estates Act of 1849. This had\r\nprovided State assistance for the sale of hopelessly mortgaged estates. Its\r\nchief result had been to substitute for a thriftless but easy-going gentry\r\n{249} a company of grasping absentees, who rack-rented their tenants\r\nwithout mercy, where their predecessors had at any rate let them alone. The\r\nstate of the Irish peasantry, even though the pressure of population had\r\nbeen greatly reduced by famine and emigration, was substantially worse in\r\n1868 than it had been in 1845. The violence of Fenianism, murder and armed\r\nrescue at Manchester, and gunpowder plot at Clerkenwell, at last drew\r\nattention to a state of affairs in which there was nothing new except the\r\ndegree of its badness.\r\n\r\nBefore the Liberals dealt with the land question, they turned their\r\nattention to the other great Irish grievance, the establishment of an alien\r\nChurch. This was one of those matters of sentiment which, between\r\nconquering and conquered peoples, produce the most deadly and incurable\r\nanimosities. The Irish Church had been established for the express purpose\r\nof prosecuting the English cause. It embodied and symbolized the alien\r\ndomination. It perpetuated the memories of a thousand massacres and\r\nconfiscations. In the language of John Bright, it was \"a garrison Church\r\n... the effect has been to make Catholicism in Ireland not only a faith,\r\nbut absolutely a patriotism.\" Every clergyman \"is necessarily in his\r\ndistrict a symbol of the supremacy of the few and of the subjection of the\r\nmany.\"[296] In its presence every Catholic Irishman felt himself a member\r\nof a conquered race, and every economic grievance was exaggerated. To\r\ninvest the alien Church with the privileges of Establishment was to rub\r\nsalt into the wounds of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Tories resisted the Liberal Bill partly on proprietary grounds. They\r\ntreated a corporation, created for the propagation of certain opinions, a\r\ntask in which it had conspicuously failed, as if it were a private person,\r\nand denounced disendowment as robbery. The Liberals contended that the\r\nState had endowed the Church, and that on the failure of the Church to\r\nprovide for the spiritual needs of the Irish people, it was fair that the\r\nState should resume part of the property and apply it for other purposes.\r\nBut the details of disendowment are hardly material. The {250} essence of\r\nthe Bill was that it tended to destroy the ascendancy of Protestantism as\r\nagainst Catholicism, and of Englishmen as against Irishmen. Gathorne Hardy\r\nput the Tory case on this point in one sentence. He said that he looked\r\nupon the Church \"as a part of the Imperial Government.\"[297] Sergeant Dowse\r\nstated the Liberal case in reply. \"The Irish people regarded that Church as\r\na great wrong and a standing memorial of conquest.... Nobody ever said the\r\nmeasure would lead to social equality. But in future a Bishop or Dean would\r\nno longer be preferred over a Bishop or Dean of the Catholic or minister of\r\nthe Presbyterian Church, and in that way, at least, an important removal of\r\nsocial distinctions would be effected.\" He reminded his hearers that on the\r\nanniversary of the Battle of the Boyne orange flags were hoisted on the\r\nspires of State churches, and described them as \"the badge of degradation\r\nto the vast majority of the Irish people. Protestant ascendancy did exist,\r\nas long as one Church was patronized and preferred above another Church\r\neither of the whole or a portion of the people.\"[298] The Bill was carried\r\ninto law after a hard fight with the House of Lords. It did not entirely\r\ndestroy the insolence of Irish Protestants or allay all the discontents of\r\nthe peasantry. But it was an earnest of the disposition of an English\r\nGovernment to legislate for the Irish people as they would have legislated\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nThe sentimental grievance having been removed, the Liberals turned to the\r\npractical grievance. The Irish Land Act of 1870 provided that the tenant\r\nshould receive compensation for his improvements, and unless the contrary\r\nwere proved, it was to be presumed that all improvements were his, and not\r\nthe landlord's. If a tenant were evicted, he was to be compensated for\r\ndisturbance, unless the eviction were for non-payment of rent, and even\r\nthen the court might hold that the exorbitant amount demanded, or other\r\ncircumstances, entitled him to special compensation. No tenant who paid\r\nless than L50 a year could contract out of the Act. Two great principles\r\nwere expressed in this measure. The first was that of the Church Act, the\r\n{251} Irish government of Ireland. The second was the new collectivism. The\r\nAct not only alleviated the great hardship of the Irish tenants, it was a\r\ndirect interference by the State with the right of property and with\r\nfreedom of contract. The absolute owner of land was no longer allowed to\r\ndeal with it as he pleased without compensating those to whom he leased it,\r\nand a poor tenant was expressly prevented from agreeing to his own injury.\r\nUtilitarianism and _laissez faire_ had ceased to dominate the Liberal mind,\r\nand liberty was deliberately restricted in one direction that it might\r\nexpand more readily in another. Where one party was rich and the other\r\npoor, where one held land in his absolute disposition and the other could\r\nnot live without it, freedom of bargaining meant the lessening of liberty.\r\nThis principle, suggested in the Factory Acts, and first openly applied to\r\nthe problem of Irish land, is now the distinctive character of Liberal\r\ndomestic policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA phenomenon of this period as remarkable as the appearance of Socialistic\r\nideas is the direction of the attention of Parliament to the affairs of\r\nwomen. One or two Acts had dealt with the condition of working women as\r\nwith that of working children, and they had been excluded altogether from\r\nthe brutalizing labour of mines. But the general status of the sex, as\r\ncompared with that of men, had remained unaltered since the accession of\r\nGeorge III. Beneath the surface of politics a substantial improvement had\r\ntaken place. The first condition of emancipation was that women themselves\r\nshould be enabled to demand it. The carefully fostered ignorance of the\r\neighteenth century was now being gradually reduced by improvements in\r\neducation. The vast majority of middle-class women still received a mental\r\ntraining which was infinitely inferior to that of men. But a few schools,\r\nof which those of Miss Buss in North London and Miss Dorothea Beale at\r\nCheltenham were the most conspicuous, had begun to substitute a scientific\r\ntraining of the mind for the futile cultivation of graces and\r\naccomplishments. Bedford College and Queen's College in London provided\r\n{252} similar training for girls who had passed the school age, and in 1870\r\nthe first women's college at Cambridge was established by Anne Jemima\r\nClough. A few books had been published by women, who claimed the same\r\nfreedom of development for the individual woman as all Liberals required\r\nfor the individual man. The public distinctions of women like George Eliot,\r\nthe Brontes, Mary Somerville, Harriet Martineau, and Florence Nightingale\r\nhad accustomed society to the idea of vigorous female independence.\r\nElizabeth Blackwell and Elizabeth Garrett had already contrived to squeeze\r\nthemselves, in the face of every kind of opposition, into the medical\r\nprofession, and soon after the Liberal victory of 1868 Sophia Jex-Blake\r\nbegan that extraordinary struggle at Edinburgh which at last ended in the\r\ndefeat of male jealousy and the admission of women to medical schools and\r\nmedical degrees. In all directions women of the middle class were beginning\r\nto assert their right to develop their own faculties and to employ their\r\nown powers according to their own ideas of what was right and fitting, and\r\nnot according to those of the dominant sex.\r\n\r\nThis movement among women was only part of the general movement towards\r\nindividual freedom from external control which is described in these pages.\r\nThe ruling sex was as little capable of understanding the part as the Tory\r\nof the French Revolution had been of understanding the whole. But the real\r\nLiberal had no difficulty in discovering and in comprehending the movement\r\nof women, and the most conspicuous Liberal thinker of the time attacked\r\nsexual Toryism as he attacked the Toryism of class or creed. Mill's\r\n_Subjection of Women_, published in 1869, applied to the condition of women\r\nprecisely those arguments which, in other works, he applied to that of men.\r\nThe question must be studied with an open mind, and not subject to a priori\r\nassumptions. Why should it be presumed that dependence and feebleness of\r\nmind were natural to women? Why should it be presumed that it was natural\r\nthat men should regulate even the private lives of women? Why should it be\r\npresumed that a woman was naturally incapable of managing her own affairs?\r\n{253} These propositions, which had perhaps been true in a barbarous\r\nsociety, could only be proved in a state of civilization by reason and\r\nargument. Until women had had some opportunity of exerting their natural\r\npowers in a state of independence, it was absurd to argue that those\r\nnatural powers were not equal to independence. An arbitrary standard,\r\nconvenient to the interest of the dominant sex, had been erected for women,\r\nand they had been carefully trained up to it. Delicacy of mind and body,\r\ndiffidence and self-effacement, superficial and unscientific learning had\r\nbeen required of them, and it was not surprising that they had very rarely\r\nattained to anything stronger. It was absurd to argue that women were\r\nnaturally incapable of intellectual exertion, of professional skill, or of\r\ntaking part in public affairs, when the whole scheme of their education had\r\nbeen contrived to make them so incapable. The supposed weaknesses are at\r\nbest exaggerated by education, and it was not improbable that they had been\r\ncreated by it. When everything possible had been done by artificial means\r\nto strengthen their minds and bodies, we might be able to form some\r\naccurate judgment of what their powers were. In any case, we had no right\r\nto enforce a general mode of life upon all women, irrespective of their\r\nindividual variations. We no longer branded men with class marks, and\r\nreserved special occupations and dignities for special groups. Why should\r\nwe persist in maintaining the same system for women? If there was only one\r\nwoman in England who was capable of practising as a doctor, it was her\r\nright as an individual to be allowed to practise, and the incapacity of\r\nevery other of her sex was no reason for depriving her of her opportunity\r\nof working out her own life. Every kind of school and college, every\r\noccupation and profession, should be thrown open, and women should be\r\npermitted, as men were permitted, each to find her own place, according to\r\nher own natural capacity.\r\n\r\nThis was the ordinary argument of Liberalism, a plea for the substitution\r\nof individual opportunity for class regulation. Mill went farther, as every\r\nLiberal is bound to go, and claimed for women the same right to control\r\ntheir own government as that {254} which he claimed for men. During the\r\ndebates on the Reform Bill of 1867 he actually moved an amendment providing\r\nfor the enfranchisement of women on the same terms as men. The respect with\r\nwhich the House listened to his speech was accorded to the speaker rather\r\nthan to his argument, and it is only in very recent years that the\r\nopposition to Woman Suffrage has ceased to be largely frivolous and even\r\nobscene. In Mill's day the force outside Parliament was very weak, and it\r\nwas impossible that his proposals should succeed. Even among the middle and\r\nupper classes only one woman in ten received a scientific mental training,\r\nand many of the best educated were so far removed by circumstances from all\r\npersonal hardships that their sense of the common grievance was slight. But\r\nthe movement which Mill thus brought to the surface of politics was\r\nessentially part of the great tide of individual emancipation which had\r\nbeen flowing since the French Revolution, and pioneers like Lydia Becker\r\nwere already struggling with prejudice and prudery with some success. Women\r\nwere beginning to refuse, as Catholics, Dissenters, and workmen had\r\nrefused, to be treated in the State as a branded class. If the domination\r\nof one class of men over another class of men had led to abuse, did not the\r\ndomination of one sex over another also lead to abuse? The deliberate\r\nstunting of the female mind in education,[299] the exclusion of women from\r\nthe Universities and the professions, the gross inequalities sanctioned by\r\nthe new Divorce Act, the barbarity which stripped the wife on marriage of\r\nall her property and even of the earnings of her own labour, and reduced\r\nher to absolute physical and mental dependence upon her husband, all this\r\nwas the direct or indirect consequence of the political domination of the\r\nmale sex. Those who disposed of women in the State, disposed of them also\r\nin the schools, in industry, and in the family. With excess of logic, the\r\nearly Woman Suffragists even opposed the restriction of women's labour by\r\n{255} Factory Acts as if every such interference had been inspired by male\r\njealousy.\r\n\r\nMost barbarous of all the grievances of women were the legal and\r\nconventional rules which affected the moral relations of the sexes. In\r\nnothing had the egoism of men been so remarkably displayed as in the\r\nconstruction of these rules, and in the care with which they had concealed\r\nthe consequences from women. The progress of the movement in favour of\r\nWoman Suffrage is precisely to be measured by the growth of women's\r\nknowledge of the facts of sex, and in particular of the meaning of\r\nprostitution. The general conspiracy of silence was at last being broken\r\nup, and the new women were turning their new eyes upon the old facts. It\r\nwas at this time still common for medical men to recommend the practice of\r\nvice to their men patients, and the practice of vice was an easy thing. A\r\nchild of thirteen might legally \"consent\" to her own dishonour, and the man\r\nwho used her for his pleasure could not be punished as a criminal. It was a\r\ncrime to abduct a young girl for the purpose of marrying her and so getting\r\ncontrol of her property. But it was not a crime to abduct her for the\r\npurpose of keeping her in a brothel. It was a crime to keep a brothel. But\r\nit was a crime because it was a nuisance to the public, not because it\r\nmeant the systematic degradation of women and girls. Their knowledge that\r\nthe law sanctioned, and that so much of male opinion encouraged, the abuse\r\nof their sex for the indulgence of their political superiors was enough in\r\nitself to direct the attention of earnest women to politics. But these\r\ngrievances were of ancient growth, and it might reasonably be pleaded that\r\nignorance and want of imagination alone prevented their remedy. A new\r\nexpression of the same disposing habit of mind showed that it had lost\r\nnothing of its old vigour.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the Contagious Diseases Acts of 1866 and 1869 is dreadful to\r\ncontemplate and to describe. But its significance is so immense, and its\r\nneglect by all ordinary historians is so marked, that it must be treated in\r\nthis book. The conflict between the disposing and the sympathetic minds,\r\nbetween the {256} blind and largely unconscious egoism of a governing class\r\nand the interest of its depreciated subjects, has never been elsewhere so\r\nterribly illustrated. Prostitution has always been regarded by a male\r\nsociety either as a danger or as a convenience. By such women as have known\r\nof its existence it has been more justly considered as an example of\r\nheartless oppression and abuse. Only a minority of the women who engage in\r\nit are there out of their own choice. The great bulk of this trade, which\r\nis now not improperly described as the White Slave Traffic, is supplied by\r\nunwilling victims. They are entrapped in childhood, or in early youth, they\r\nare corrupted by bad housing and overcrowding, they are betrayed by\r\nseducers, or they are driven by starvation wages to earn their living on\r\nthe streets. Their condition is the most wretched of any people in the\r\nworld. No other trade is so dangerous to those who are employed in it, or\r\nso quickly uses up their lives. No other trade so swiftly devours in its\r\nworkpeople those noble qualities of the mind which would enable them to\r\nsupport the heaviest physical burdens. In prostitution everything is sooner\r\nor later destroyed that most adorns body, mind, and soul.\r\n\r\nFor the victims of this traffic in flesh the Legislature had for long\r\nprovided nothing but fine and imprisonment, methods which were as useless\r\nto deter the minority which was corrupt as they were powerless to save the\r\nmajority which was unfortunate. The Liberal could adopt only one course, to\r\nattack the causes at their roots, to amend Statutes like the Divorce Act,\r\nwhich sanctioned vice in men, to protect young girls by raising the age of\r\nconsent, and to impose penalties on those who exploited them, to improve\r\nthe conditions of housing and labour, and to raise wages. The Government\r\nwhich was left in power by Palmerston, seeing prostitution only with male\r\neyes, made a fatal error. They set themselves, not to make prostitution\r\ndifficult for women, but to make it safe for men. The diseases produced by\r\nvice were seriously injuring the health of the Army and Navy. The\r\nGovernment did not attempt, as its successors have attempted, to reduce the\r\npractice of vice among their servants. They took the easier {257} course of\r\nrecognizing and regulating what they thought they could not check. By the\r\nAct of 1866, amended by the Act of 1869, they compelled the unfortunate\r\nwomen in garrison towns to submit themselves periodically to medical\r\nexamination. The healthy were discharged. The diseased were compulsorily\r\ndetained in hospitals until they were cured, when they also were released\r\nto continue the practice of their trade. The soldiers and sailors were\r\nimplicitly told that if they were careful to select one of these Government\r\nwomen they could be vicious with impunity. The climax of the system was\r\nreached in 1885, when the Commander-in-Chief in India instructed his\r\ncommanding officers to see that plenty of good-looking girls were provided\r\nfor their men, and that they had all proper facilities for practising their\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nOf the foul barbarity of this contrivance of the Legislature it is\r\ndifficult to write with moderation, even at this distance of time. It is\r\nnot suggested here that the majority of the men who were responsible were\r\nanimated by vicious motives. It was only another example of unimaginative\r\ndullness legislating without responsibility. But the effect of deliberate\r\nwickedness could not have been worse. The wretched were confirmed in\r\nwretchedness. The degraded were thrust farther into the depths of\r\ndegradation. Thousands of human beings of the subject class, originally\r\nguilty of nothing worse than poverty or a youthful lapse from principle,\r\nwere placed by the State at the disposal of the governing class for the\r\nfoulest purpose. It is a most vivid illustration of the rarity of complete\r\nLiberalism, that the Contagious Diseases Acts remained on the Statute Book\r\nfor seventeen years, and that if they were in the first place smuggled\r\nthrough Parliament, they were afterwards defended by men of all parties\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nA few politicians like James Stansfeld fought steadily in Parliament. But\r\nthe Parliamentary machine is so constructed, that when parties are divided\r\npublic causes fall to the ground. In this case, as in that of the repeal of\r\nthe Corn Laws, reform came by way of a struggle outside the walls of the\r\nLegislature. {258} Mrs. Josephine Butler was the leader of the agitation.\r\nSeventeen years of fighting against vested interests, against the medical\r\nprofession and the Army, against indifference, against active and\r\npersecuting prudery, and against physical violence were required, and the\r\nvictory was not completed till 1886. But this long agony was of enormous\r\nhistorical importance. It not only achieved its immediate object, the\r\nrepeal of the Acts and the further result of the passing of the Criminal\r\nLaw Amendment Act of 1885; its indirect effects were infinite. It was the\r\nfirst organized effort on the part of women in their own political\r\ninterest. It extended to other parts of the world. It taught women,\r\nirrespective of class and race, the value of solidarity. It stimulated the\r\ndemand for education, for better moral standards, for the franchise, for\r\neverything which would enable women to control their own lives and to take\r\nthemselves out of the disposition of men. It was in fact the greatest\r\nsingle stimulus to that vast social movement for the emancipation of women\r\nwhich is to-day visible in every part of the world. No one can understand\r\nthe modern demand for Woman Suffrage who does not realize that the driving\r\nforce behind it is the increasing knowledge of prostitution which has\r\nsprung from Mrs. Butler's agitation. Rightly or wrongly, the Suffragists\r\nbelieve that political domination involves moral domination, and that\r\ninvoluntary prostitution will exist so long as the regulation of women's\r\npolitical affairs rests in the hands of men.\r\n\r\nThe Contagious Diseases Acts represented the extreme abuse of the male ego.\r\nBut the Liberal Government of 1868, which actually passed the second of the\r\ntwo Acts, did not a little in other ways to improve the condition of women.\r\nThe Married Women's Property Act of 1870 protected the wife's earnings\r\nagainst her husband, and permitted her to enjoy, for her own use, property\r\nwhich she had acquired by inheritance. The Education Act of 1870 permitted\r\nwomen to be elected as members of the new School Boards, and an Act of 1875\r\nadmitted them also to Boards of Guardians. These three Acts marked a\r\nsubstantial rise in the social scale. They affected chiefly women of the\r\n{259} richer classes. But the admissions which they implied were of\r\nindefinite extent. Society had begun to look at the individual within the\r\nfamily as it had begun to look at the individual within the class or sect.\r\nThe wife was acknowledged to be a separate individual from her husband, and\r\nthe presence of women on public bodies was a sufficient answer to the\r\nargument that women should be confined to those duties which they could\r\nonly perform in association with men. Marriage had ceased to be the sole\r\nobject of a decent woman's life. In spite of the monstrous injustice of the\r\nContagious Diseases Acts, woman was being placed in Society, in some\r\nmeasure at least, in accordance with her own worth, and not with the\r\nassumptions of male egoism.\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of the Government was conspicuously Liberal, and it was\r\njustified by its results. Liberty was maintained and moral rules were\r\nenforced without Palmerston's recklessness, and there were none of the acts\r\nof petty bullying with which he had varied his tilting at tyrants. The\r\ngeneral outline of the new policy is contained in a memorandum addressed by\r\nMr. Gladstone to the Queen in 1871. He stated its principles to be \"That\r\nEngland should keep entire in her own hands the means of estimating her own\r\nobligations upon the various states of facts as they arise; that she should\r\nnot foreclose and narrow her own liberty of choice, by declarations made to\r\nother powers, in their real or supported interests, of which they would\r\nclaim to be joint interpreters; that it is dangerous for her to assume\r\nalone an advanced, and therefore an isolated, position, in regard to\r\nEuropean controversies; that, come what may, it is better for her to\r\npromise too little than too much; that she should not encourage the weak by\r\ngiving expectations of aid to resist the strong, but should rather seek to\r\ndeter the strong, by firm but moderate language, from aggression on the\r\nweak; that she should seek to develop and mature the action of a common, or\r\npublic, or European opinion, as the best standing bulwark against wrong,\r\nbut should beware of seeming to lay down the law of that opinion by her own\r\nauthority, and thus running the risk of setting against {260} her, and\r\nagainst right and justice, that general sentiment which ought to be, and\r\ngenerally would be, arrayed in their favour. I am persuaded that opinions\r\nof this colour are the only opinions which the country is disposed to\r\napprove. But I do not believe that on that account it is one whit less\r\ndisposed than it has been at any time, to cast in its lot upon any fitting\r\noccasion with the cause it believes to be right.\"[300]\r\n\r\nThis is a sort of middle between Palmerstonism and Cobdenism. It repudiates\r\nthe balance of power. It condemns isolated, single-handed war on behalf of\r\nweak nations against strong, and emphasizes the necessity of international\r\nco-operation. But it lays down no general rule of non-interference, it\r\njustifies diplomatic protest against the immoral treatment of one nation by\r\nanother, and it admits that war may sometimes be right and necessary, even\r\nwhen no specifically British interest is directly involved.[301] It is\r\nprobably as nearly a precise definition of Liberal policy as could be made\r\nin connection with a matter where precision is extremely difficult.\r\n\r\nMinisters were more than once severely tested during their term of office.\r\nLord Clarendon, the Foreign Secretary, made some attempt to suggest a\r\ngeneral reduction of armaments. The British forces had been considerably\r\ndiminished by the withdrawal of troops from the self-governing Colonies,\r\nand expenditure on both the war services had been cut down. Lord\r\nClarendon's tentative advances were at least disinterested. He approached\r\nthe French Emperor and Bismarck. Each waited for the other to begin, and on\r\nthe 15th July, 1870, six months after the proposals were made, the outbreak\r\nof the Franco-Prussian War supplied a tragically ironic comment on their\r\nfutility. The British Government suggested mediation, but without success,\r\nand in another six months France was at the feet of her enemies. Sir Henry\r\nBulwer, an old subordinate of Palmerston, was the {261} only responsible\r\nstatesman who suggested intervention on her behalf.[302] The quarrel was\r\nher own. If Bismarck had been dishonest, Napoleon III had been little\r\nbetter, and the French people had been as eager for war as the German.\r\nMinisters had no difficulty in maintaining a strict neutrality.\r\n\r\nOn two controversies arising out of the war they showed themselves as\r\nprompt and as resolute as any one could have wished. In order to prejudice\r\nFrance in the eyes of Europe, Bismarck published some proposals which the\r\nFrench Emperor had made to the King of Prussia a few years before for the\r\nannexation of Belgium to France. The independence of Belgium had been\r\nguaranteed by England, France, Prussia, Austria, and Russia in 1839, and\r\nthis plan was as immoral in itself as it was dangerous to the peace of\r\nEurope. It was suggested that England was not concerned single-handed to\r\nenforce a treaty to which other Powers were parties. Gladstone was\r\ndetermined at least to attempt it. An ingenious treaty was contrived\r\nbetween Great Britain and the two belligerents, by which either France or\r\nGermany was to go to war in alliance with Great Britain, if the\r\nindependence of Belgium was violated by the other. The House of Commons\r\nvoted two millions of money and approved of an increase of the forces by\r\n20,000 men. The treaty and the Parliamentary votes were sufficient proofs\r\nof the determination of the Government to defend the Belgians, and no\r\nhostile army set foot upon their soil. This was an intervention in a good\r\ncause, made without bluster, and it was justified by success.\r\n\r\nThe second occasion for strong action was a similar violation of an\r\ninternational agreement. By the treaty of Paris, which ended the Crimean\r\nWar, Russia and Turkey had agreed to place no ships of war upon the Black\r\nSea. This was a futile interference with what might almost be called the\r\ndomestic concerns of the two countries, in an inland sea which was entirely\r\nsurrounded by their own territories. But such as it was, it was made\r\nbinding in most solemn terms. Russia could have {262} obtained a release by\r\ndiplomatic means without any difficulty. She preferred, in the crisis of\r\nthe Franco-Prussian War, to announce that she intended to be no longer\r\nbounded by this restriction. This was an impudent breach of her engagement,\r\nmade possible only by the difficulties of her associates. The English\r\nGovernment acted again with vigour and directness. Lord Granville[303]\r\nwrote to the British Ambassador at Petersburg in language which was really\r\nthat of Gladstone: \"It is quite evident that the effect of such doctrine,\r\nand of any proceeding which, with or without avowal, is founded upon it, is\r\nto bring the entire authority and efficacy of treaties under the\r\ndiscretionary control of each one of the Powers who may have signed them,\r\nthe result of which would be the entire destruction of treaties in their\r\nessence.\"[304] Mr. Odo Russell got the support of Prussia by saying that\r\nEngland would fight, even if she had no allies,[305] and a conference in\r\nLondon resolved formally that no single nation could arrogate to itself the\r\npower of dispensing with a treaty. The obnoxious clause in the Treaty of\r\nParis was then repealed. Here again the readiness to use force in support\r\nof moral rules was successful.\r\n\r\nA third occasion for intervention arose when Germany required France to\r\ncede the two provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. Gladstone wished to procure\r\na European protest against this transfer of territory without the assent of\r\nthe inhabitants. \"My opinion certainly is that the transfer of territory\r\nand inhabitants by mere force calls for the reprobation of Europe, and that\r\nEurope is entitled to utter it with good effect.\"[306] He did not suggest\r\nthat England should step in single-handed, in the manner of Palmerston. It\r\nwas Europe's duty as it was Europe's interest. \"A matter of this kind\r\ncannot be regarded as in principle a question between the two belligerents\r\nonly, but involves considerations of legitimate interest to all the Powers\r\nof Europe. It appears to bear on the Belgian question in {263} particular.\r\nIt is also a principle likely to be of great consequence in the eventual\r\nsettlement of the Eastern question.\"[307] He apprehended \"that this violent\r\nlaceration and transfer is to lead us from bad to worse, and to be the\r\n_beginning_ of a new series of European complications.\"[308] He was\r\nperfectly right. His aim could only be secured with the assistance of the\r\nneutral Powers, and the greatest of these had just shown how little she\r\nregarded rules of morality and the public opinion of Europe. Bismarck had\r\nindeed begun a new era, and the theory of compensation was being\r\nsubstituted for the theory of obligation. It was no longer \"I keep my word,\r\ntherefore you must keep yours,\" but \"I will acquiesce in your breaking your\r\nword, if you will allow me to break mine.\" Gladstone's attempt to maintain\r\nthe better system was prevented by his Cabinet, and with Russia imitating\r\nGerman contempt for morality, it was probably the wisest course to do\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nAfter these two demonstrations of their readiness to enforce moral rules\r\nwhere the circumstances required it, the Government showed that they were\r\nequally ready to observe moral rules even against their own material\r\ninterest. The American Civil War had left them the onerous legacy of the\r\n_Alabama_ claims. The _Alabama_ was a privateer, which Palmerston and\r\nRussell, in spite of the protests of the American Ambassador, had allowed\r\nto sail from Birkenhead. In the service of the Confederate Government, she\r\nhad inflicted great damage upon the shipping of the North, and after the\r\nconclusion of the war the American Government had claimed that the British\r\nGovernment should pay compensation for the consequences of their\r\nnegligence. Their case was spoilt by the impudent inclusion of claims for\r\nremote injuries, including the whole cost of the war after the last defeat\r\nof the Confederate army in the field.[309] Palmerston and Lord John Russell\r\nhad steadily refused to admit liability. Gladstone and Lord Granville had\r\nmore wisdom and {264} more real courage. The whole case was submitted to a\r\nCourt of Arbitration at Geneva composed of representatives of the two\r\ndisputants, Italy, Switzerland, and Brazil. Great Britain was held to be\r\nresponsible, and damages were awarded. The American claims for direct\r\ninjury were nine and a half millions. The award was for three and a\r\nquarter. This was perhaps the greatest act of the Government. For the first\r\ntime in history, a great State, instead of asserting its claims by force,\r\nhad agreed to be bound by the decision of an impartial tribunal, and had\r\npaid damages for its wrong-doing as if it had been a private person in a\r\ncourt of law. The cause of international morality advances slowly, and\r\nreaction is frequent and universal. But the disposition to subdue egoism to\r\nthe common interest and to subordinate national vanity to moral rules grows\r\nsteadily on the whole. The first important step in advance was made by the\r\nLiberal Government which submitted to the arbitration at Geneva.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{265}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nGLADSTONE VERSUS DISRAELI\r\n\r\nThe history of the Disraeli Ministry which in 1874 followed that of\r\nGladstone is almost entirely a history of foreign policy. The new Premier\r\nhad described the domestic activity of his predecessor as a policy of\r\nplundering and blundering, and he himself avoided the imputation of either\r\nform of error by doing little of any significance at home. In effect he\r\nrevived the system of Palmerston, and endeavoured to distract the popular\r\nattention from domestic grievances by splendid demonstrations abroad. One\r\nor two useful Liberal measures, besides the Employers and Workmen Act, were\r\npassed into law. An Artisans Dwellings Act empowered municipal corporations\r\nto acquire land by compulsory purchase, for the erection of workmen's\r\nhouses. This was an entirely wise application of the new collectivist\r\nprinciples, and a belated individualist was discovered in Mr. Fawcett, who\r\nopposed the Bill, on strictly logical grounds, as \"class legislation.\" The\r\nsame argument would abolish the Poor Law. Another measure of great utility\r\nwas forced on the Government by Plimsoll, a Liberal philanthropist. It\r\nprovided for the inspection and detention of unseaworthy ships, and was a\r\nnotable example of interference with private property and freedom of\r\ncontract in the interest of a class of adult men. A third reform of a\r\nLiberal kind was due to Parnell, the new leader of the Irish Nationalists,\r\nwho amended the Prison Bill of 1877 by inserting a clause that persons\r\nguilty of seditious libel should be treated as {266} first-class\r\nmisdemeanants and not as common criminals. This was the high-water mark of\r\nthe reaction from the eighteenth-century treatment of political criticism.\r\nIn 1777 an honest Republican might have been treated as a felon. Since 1877\r\nallowance has been made for the motives even of the advocate of Revolution.\r\nEven the law shows respect for the right of the common man to censure his\r\ngovernors. A last Liberal measure was the Act of 1878, which enabled\r\nUniversities to confer medical degrees upon women. These Acts were\r\nsubstantially all the important domestic legislation of the Ministry.\r\n\r\nWhile thus abstaining from activity at home, Disraeli gratified his\r\ninstinct for magnificence abroad, and sacrificed morality and interest on\r\nthe altar of prestige. One bold stroke was to buy from the Khedive of Egypt\r\nhis shares in the Suez Canal. This feat was not so splendid as it was\r\nclaimed to be. It gave England no additional hold over the route to India,\r\nwhich, in time of war, can only be maintained by the fleet, whether the\r\nCanal is English or Egyptian. But it gave England a deciding voice in the\r\nmanagement of a neutral waterway, and prevented it from falling into the\r\nhands of other and less altruistic Powers. This action at least did no\r\nharm. The other proceedings of the Government were almost uniformly\r\ndisgraceful, and most disgraceful where they were most pretentious. In the\r\nBalkans and in Afghanistan they were guilty of conduct which was at once\r\nvainglorious, unsuccessful, and wrong, and neither in objects, nor methods,\r\nnor results was there anything worthy of credit. The first of these shabby\r\nperformances took place in the Near East, where they adopted Palmerston's\r\npolicy of protecting Turkey without any of his excuse. It could be urged in\r\nfavour of the Crimean War that it was undertaken to enable the Turks to set\r\ntheir house in order, and a firm belief in the possibility of that\r\nregeneration might justify an honest man in supporting Turkey against\r\nRussia. Palmerston retained that belief until his death. At the time of\r\nDisraeli's accession it could not have existed in the mind of any\r\nreasonable being. After twenty years, Turkish Government of subject\r\nChristian races remained what it had always been, and in {267} 1876 a just\r\nand necessary revolt in Bulgaria was suppressed with the usual Turkish\r\nincidents of massacre, burning alive, rape, torture, and destruction of\r\nproperty. Gladstone was inspired to a passionate demand for armed\r\nintervention, and the British peoples have never been so deeply stirred as\r\nby his pamphlet to ignore the distinctions of party, class, and creed.\r\nDisraeli treated the news of outrage with characteristic flippancy, and\r\ntalked airily of \"coffee-house babble,\" even when Lord Derby, his Foreign\r\nSecretary, was instructing the British Ambassador at Constantinople to\r\nprotest against the atrocities of the Turkish agents. The responsibility of\r\nGreat Britain could not be questioned. We had taken Turkey under our\r\nprotection twenty years before, to serve our private ends, and as we had\r\nhelped to maintain the system of government, so we were entitled to\r\ndenounce its abuse. There was indeed only one step for an honourable and\r\ncourageous people to take, to confess our error and to confine Turkish\r\nsovereignty to Turkish people. There was no question of single-handed\r\naction. Russia, Austria, and Germany agreed, in the Berlin Memorandum, to\r\nrequire the Sultan to reform his government, and France and Italy\r\nconcurred. Great Britain refused to join the others, on the ground that she\r\nhad not been consulted from the first. This policy had but one motive,\r\ndistrust of Russia; it had but one consequence, the encouragement of\r\nTurkey. The joint Memorandum was ineffective, and in the face of\r\nAnglo-Russian jealousy, the Sultan snapped his fingers at suggestions of\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nThe climax was reached when Great Britain refused to join Russia in a naval\r\ndemonstration in the Bosphorus. The Tsar then declared that he would act\r\nalone, and gave the British Ambassador his word of honour that he had no\r\nintention of annexing any part of the Turkish dominions or of permanently\r\noccupying Constantinople. On the lips of the Tsar Nicholas of the Crimean\r\nWar such a pledge might have meant little. On the lips of the Tsar\r\nAlexander, a genuine Liberal, who had emancipated the serfs and given his\r\nsubjects, for the first time in their history, courts of law in place of\r\nbureaucratic caprice, it {268} meant very much. Nothing is more certain\r\nthan that the Tsar was honest in his professions, and that he was impelled\r\nby a disinterested wave of enthusiasm among his subjects. The Balkan\r\nquestion is the one question on which a Russian Government always expresses\r\nthe opinions of the Russian people. But even if the Tsar had been\r\ndishonest, and if England had been placed in a real dilemma, it was\r\nentirely England's fault. The Tory Government, by refusing to act in\r\nconcert with the other Powers, had left only two alternatives possible to\r\nRussia: to do nothing, or to interfere single-handed. When she showed signs\r\nof adopting the second, Disraeli at the Lord Mayor's Banquet made ominous\r\nreferences to war. Everything was done by the Tory Press to inflame the\r\npopular mind against Russia, and to divert attention from the real issue.\r\nEven the Liberal Opposition was distracted, and in Parliament Mr. Gladstone\r\nmaintained his straight and courageous course almost without a helper.[310]\r\nWhen the Russians had crossed the border, and, after an astonishingly\r\nsuccessful resistance by the Turks, were actually approaching\r\nConstantinople, the balance of English opinion swung against them, and the\r\nGovernment openly prepared for war.[311] The music-halls rallied to their\r\nsupport, the name of Jingo was invented, and Gladstone's windows were\r\nbroken by the mob. But the conclusion of peace by the Treaty of San Stefano\r\nended the war between Turkey and Russia and prevented the war between\r\nRussia and Great Britain. The Tory Government was saved, by no fault of its\r\nown, from a moral disaster which no material successes could have effaced.\r\nDuring the negotiations which followed the Treaty they made full use of the\r\ndangerous temper which they had aroused.\r\n\r\nThe terms of the Treaty gave them an opportunity of enforcing a Liberal\r\nprinciple, and for the first time Russia made {269} a false step. The\r\ntreaty gave Russia a small indemnity and a little territory. Bulgaria was\r\nmade an independent principality, and the Turks, as Gladstone had demanded,\r\n\"one and all, bag and baggage, cleared out from the province they had\r\ndesolated and profaned.\" Russia had done single-handed what it should have\r\nbeen the duty and the pride of England to help her to do. But the treaty,\r\nas it stood, was as much an infraction of the Treaty of Paris as the\r\nplacing of armed ships upon the Black Sea, and the British Government very\r\nproperly required an international agreement. Russia at first refused, and\r\nif this difficult situation had not been the direct result of their own\r\nunprincipled conduct, the British Government would have had a very good\r\nexcuse for war. A disaster was once more imminent, and Lord Derby finally\r\nresigned. He was succeeded by Lord Cranborne,[312] and the Tory Press once\r\nmore fanned the flames of national hatred.\r\n\r\nBut Disraeli was above all things a contriver of effects, and while his\r\nfollowers applauded his firmness and resolution in maintaining the Treaty\r\nof Paris, he was privately engaged in pulling it to pieces. He made a\r\nsecret treaty with Russia, agreeing to support her at the international\r\nconference in asking substantially for what she had obtained by the Treaty\r\nof San Stefano. He then proceeded with great solemnity to Berlin, after\r\nhaving apparently humiliated his adversary, and Russia obtained what she\r\nwanted without difficulty. The Treaty of Berlin made few alterations in the\r\nTreaty of San Stefano, and the most important was unquestionably for the\r\nworse. The extent of the New Bulgaria was reduced, and it was divided into\r\ntwo provinces, which a few years later joined together to form the present\r\nState. The reduction was effected by the restoration of Macedonia to\r\nTurkey, and as these words are being written that unhappy district, after\r\nanother generation of distress, has become the cause of another Balkan war.\r\nThe policy of Disraeli was for the time as popular as that of Palmerston\r\nhad ever been. Surveyed after thirty-five years, it appears to have\r\nconsisted in {270} encouraging Turkey to fight in defence of an iniquitous\r\nsystem of government, and, after nearly involving the British people in a\r\nwar for a vile cause, in forcing the inhabitants of Macedonia to suffer for\r\nanother generation at the hands of their unregenerate oppressors. Through\r\nthis policy, for the last thirty years the Macedonian peasant, setting out\r\nin the morning for the fields, has not known that on his return in the\r\nevening he would not find his house burnt to the ground and his wife\r\ndishonoured. Through this policy, the bloody issue of the Balkans has now\r\nbeen settled for the second time by a savage and destructive war. The\r\ntransaction, so selfish in its origin, so shameless in its methods, and so\r\nhorrible in its consequences, is generally described by admirers of\r\nBeaconsfield in his own words, as his achievement of \"Peace with\r\nHonour.\"[313]\r\n\r\nThe next scene for the display of this reckless and improvident system was\r\nAfghanistan. The Viceroy of India was Lord Lytton, whose strong character\r\nwas expressed in a wise and vigorous conduct of domestic affairs, and a\r\nconduct of foreign affairs which was only vigorous. His attention was\r\ndirected, soon after the Balkan difficulty began, to Central Asia. In that\r\nquarter Russia, following her usual habit of advancing in Asia whenever she\r\nwas repulsed in Europe, had come into touch with the Afghans. The policy of\r\nthe Gladstone Government, in similar circumstances, had always been to\r\nnegotiate directly with Russia, and they had steadily refused to use other\r\npeoples as tools of their diplomacy. This was not merely a moral, it was\r\nalso a wise rule of conduct. Just as strong and independent Balkan States\r\nwere better barriers against Russia than a corrupt {271} and enfeebled\r\nTurkey, so the best bulwarks of India were native tribes who had no reason\r\nto fear British aggression, and every reason to believe that she would\r\nprotect them against the encroachments of other States. The policy of\r\nLiberalism coincided with that of almost every Indian statesman of\r\nexperience. Everything had been done, in past times, to avoid the\r\nappearance of dictating to the small peoples beyond the frontier. \"Surround\r\nIndia,\" wrote Lord Lytton's predecessor, \"with strong, friendly, and\r\nindependent states, who will have more interest in keeping well with us\r\nthan with any other Power.\"[314]\r\n\r\nThis was the policy of wisdom. Lord Lytton and his Home Government\r\npreferred to adopt the other policy, and to make the Amir of Afghanistan a\r\npawn in their game with Russia. \"A tool in the hands of Russia I will never\r\nallow him to become. Such a tool it would be my duty to break before it\r\ncould be used.\"[315] In other words, the Amir was to put himself into the\r\nhands of England in order that he might be unable to put himself in the\r\nhands of Russia. He was requested to receive a British Envoy in terms which\r\nwould have been more properly addressed to an open enemy than to an ally,\r\nand from the first Lord Lytton adopted a tone which did nothing to\r\nconciliate and everything to disturb a race who are, beyond almost all\r\nothers, suspicious of foreign interference. The result was that Shere Ali\r\nwas driven into the arms of Russia, whose manners were better if her aims\r\nwere not less selfish than those of the British Viceroy. Russia was not\r\nreluctant to embarrass England in Central Asia, and the Bulgarian dispute\r\nwas followed by the despatch of a Russian mission to Kabul. The Amir\r\nobjected, but was powerless. The Russian representative soon left the\r\ncountry, but not before his object, the provocation of the Viceroy, had\r\nbeen achieved. Lord Lytton retaliated by sending {272} an envoy of his own,\r\nwho was turned back at the Kyber Pass. War began in November, 1878, and the\r\nParliamentary parties were divided more sharply than by the threatened war\r\nwith Russia.\r\n\r\nGladstone was on this occasion supported by all the Liberal Opposition, and\r\nin the House of Lords, Lord Lawrence, one of the greatest Englishmen who\r\nhad ever governed in India, was on the same side.[316] Liberal principles\r\nhad been offended in more than one way. The Viceroy had bullied Afghanistan\r\nas Palmerston had bullied China. He had attempted to interfere with her\r\nindependence. He had endeavoured to repair the blunders of his diplomacy by\r\nwar, and to supply his own deficiency of wisdom by brute force. If he had\r\nhad any real cause of quarrel it was with Russia, and he had used\r\nAfghanistan simply as an unwilling means to an end of his own, on account\r\nof transactions in which she had had no freedom and no responsibility.\r\n\"Having a cause of complaint against the strong,\" said Whitbread, \"they\r\nfixed the quarrel on the weak; and they have brought us to a war, in which\r\nalready gallant men's lives have been lost, and homes made desolate, to\r\natone for the blunders and errors of their administration.\"[317] Mr.\r\nChamberlain, the rising hope of the uncompromising Radicals, reiterated\r\nthose general principles which are familiar to all who have read the\r\ndebates on the China War in 1860. \"Is it sufficient to call a man a\r\nbarbarian in order to discharge oneself of all obligations to treat him\r\nwith common fairness and consideration?... Only admit that a country has to\r\nfollow the law of self-preservation without reference to others, and it is\r\nevidently a justification for an attack, say of France upon Belgium, or\r\nGermany upon Holland, or the absorption of Canada by the United States, and\r\nthis deliberate attempt to substitute might for right in dealing with\r\nIndian Princes, and the law of force for the law of nations, is certain, in\r\nmy opinion, to {273} have a most disastrous effect upon the true\r\nfoundations of our Indian Empire.\"[318]\r\n\r\nForce triumphed, for the time, over morals. But retribution came with more\r\nthan its usual swiftness. The Afghans were beaten in the field. Shere Ali\r\ndisappeared, and his son Yakub Khan took his place. Lord Lytton had\r\ndistrusted the father, who was no worse than weak. He confided in the son,\r\nwho was thoroughly bad. Major Cavagnari entered Kabul as British Envoy on\r\nthe 24th of July, 1879. On the 3rd of September he was murdered with all\r\nhis people. A second war was undertaken, more lives were lost, and the\r\nGovernment actually proposed to partition Afghanistan, and to incorporate\r\nthe eastern part in the Indian Empire. This course could have produced only\r\nthree consequences. Free Afghanistan would have been thrust into the arms\r\nof Russia. British Afghanistan would have been in a perpetual condition of\r\nunrest. Our military responsibilities would have been extended beyond the\r\nnatural barrier of the great mountains at the same time that they would\r\nhave been indefinitely increased by the direct contact with the Russian\r\nfrontier. Entangled in difficult passes, and surrounded by unfriendly hill\r\ntribes, our troops would have been infinitely less formidable to Russia\r\nthan in the plains of India. The General Election of 1880 extricated Great\r\nBritain from this dangerous folly, and the new Government evacuated\r\nAfghanistan and abandoned the project of a British Envoy at Kabul. From\r\nthat day to this the Afghans have been treated according to the principles\r\nlaid down by the Liberal Opposition.[319] They have been encouraged to\r\nbelieve that Great Britain will protect them against external aggression,\r\nand nothing has been done to make them suspect that she has any intention\r\nof interfering with their independence.\r\n\r\nOne other action of this Tory Government betrayed the same {274} desire to\r\nacquire territory and to extend responsibilities as their enterprise in\r\nCentral Asia. In 1877 they annexed the Transvaal Republic. This step was\r\nprompted partly by military motives, as giving additional security against\r\nthe Zulus, whose quarrels with the scattered Dutch farmers caused perpetual\r\nunrest. It was also part of a scheme for South African federation, which\r\nwas the offspring of the growing spirit of Imperialism. Nor did it seem at\r\nfirst that annexation was contrary to Boer sentiment. The Republic was\r\nloosely organized, its finances were in a bad state, its great mineral\r\nwealth was unknown, and some of the inhabitants were anxious to obtain the\r\nstability which the British connection would afford. If the promise of\r\nrepresentative institutions, which was made at the time, had been fulfilled\r\nwith reasonable speed, the hostile section might have been reduced to\r\ninsignificance. But the British Government seemed to forget that it was\r\ndealing with a race whose dislike of foreign domination was as stubborn as\r\nthat of their own people. It is unquestionable that the bulk of the Boer\r\npopulation resented the annexation, and used every peaceful means of\r\nexpressing its real wishes. But in spite of deputations, public meetings,\r\nand petitions signed by practically every elector of the old Republic, the\r\nDisraeli Ministry continued to govern by the arbitrary methods of Crown\r\nColony Government. When the Liberals came into power, in 1880, three years\r\nafter the annexation, the Boers were still without the promised\r\ninstitutions, and the opponents of England were no longer a faction, but\r\nthe whole people. Want of imagination never stumbled into a worse folly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Election of 1880 is the only election which has ever been\r\nfought in Great Britain on the general principles of foreign policy.\r\nGladstone had retired from the nominal leadership of the Liberal party\r\nafter his defeat in 1874. But there was no question who had directed its\r\npolicy in the last few years, and Lord Hartington, in 1880, was obviously\r\nno more than the lieutenant of his principal follower. Any doubts which may\r\nhave before existed were dispelled by Gladstone's election campaign {275}\r\nin Midlothian. He invaded the strongest Tory constituency in Scotland, beat\r\nthe nominee of the Duke of Buccleuch, and in his speeches dictated the\r\nissues upon which candidates fought all over Great Britain. These speeches\r\nwere almost entirely concerned with the Liberal case against egoism in\r\nforeign affairs, and the result of the polls was an emphatic approval of\r\ntheir principles. There were some errors in the speeches. To represent the\r\nZulu War as an outrage of the same kind as the annexation of the Transvaal,\r\nor the invasion of Afghanistan, was absurd. The rights of bloodthirsty and\r\naggressive savages are different from those of civilized white men or even\r\nthe comparatively peaceful tribes of Asia. But this was only an unwise\r\napplication of the sound general principles which were expressed in the\r\nspeeches.\r\n\r\nThe Midlothian speeches reproduced the opinions of Granville's Memorandum\r\nof 1851 and those of Clarendon's statement of 1871. Gladstone dissented\r\nfrom the absolute pacificism of the Manchester School.[320] But while he\r\nadmitted the occasional necessity for war, and pointed to his own readiness\r\nto protect Belgium as a proof that he did not believe in peace at any\r\nprice, he required that a real and sober policy should be substituted for\r\nthe ostentatious vanities of the Tories. \"What we want in foreign policy is\r\nthe substitution of what is true and genuine for what is imposing and\r\npretentious, but unreal.... Let us get rid of all these shams and fall back\r\nupon realities, the character of which is to be quiet, to be\r\nunostentatious, to pretend to nothing, not to thrust claims and\r\nunconstitutional claims for ascendancy and otherwise in the teeth of your\r\nneighbour, but to maintain your rights and to respect the rights of others\r\nas much as your own.\"[321] \"The great duty of a Government, especially in\r\nforeign affairs, is to soothe and tranquillize the minds of a people, not\r\nto set up false phantoms of glory which are to delude them into calamity,\r\nnot to flatter their infirmities by leading them to believe that they are\r\nbetter than the rest of the world, and so encourage the baleful {276}\r\nspirit of domination; but to proceed upon a principle that recognizes the\r\nsisterhood and equality of nations, the absolute equality of public right\r\namong them.\"[322] The speaker denounced Beaconsfield's reference to\r\n\"Imperium et Libertas\" as he had once before denounced Palmerston's use of\r\n\"Civis Romanus Sum,\" and appealed to \"the sound and sacred principle that\r\nChristendom is formed of a band of nations who are united to one another in\r\nthe bonds of right; that they are without distinction of great and small;\r\nthere is an absolute equality between them, the same sacredness defends the\r\nnarrow limits of Belgium as attaches to the extended frontiers of Russia,\r\nor Germany, or France.\"[323] From this admission of the equality of nations\r\ncame the need for the observance of public law. \"There is no duty so\r\nsacred, incumbent upon any Government in its foreign policy, as that\r\ncareful and strict regard to public law.\"[324]\r\n\r\nGladstone laid down six general principles by which our foreign policy\r\nshould be guided. \"The first thing is to foster the strength of the Empire\r\nby just legislation and economy at home, thereby producing two of the great\r\nelements of national power--namely, wealth, which is a physical element,\r\nand union and contentment, which are moral elements--and to reserve the\r\nstrength of the Empire, to reserve the expenditure of that strength for\r\ngreat and worthy occasions abroad.... My second principle ... is this--that\r\nits aim ought to be to preserve to the nations of the world ... the\r\nblessings of peace. My third principle is this--when you do a good thing,\r\nyou may do it in so bad a way that you may entirely spoil the beneficial\r\neffect; and if we were to make ourselves the apostles of peace in the sense\r\nof conveying to the minds of other nations that we thought ourselves more\r\nentitled to an opinion on that subject than they are, or to deny their\r\nrights--well, very likely we should destroy the whole value of our\r\ndoctrines. In my opinion the third sound principle is this--to strive to\r\ncultivate and maintain, ay, to the very uttermost, what is called the\r\nConcert of Europe; to keep the Powers of {277} Europe in union together.\r\nAnd why? Because by keeping all in union together you neutralize and fetter\r\nand bind up the selfish aims of each.... My fourth principle is that you\r\nshould avoid needless and entangling engagements. You may boast about them,\r\nyou may brag about them. You may say you are procuring consideration for\r\nthe country. You may say that an Englishman can now hold up his head among\r\nthe nations.... But what does all this come to, gentlemen? It comes to\r\nthis, that you are increasing your engagements without increasing your\r\nstrength; ... you really reduce the Empire and do not increase it.... My\r\nfifth principle is, to acknowledge the equal rights of all nations. You may\r\nsympathize with one nation more than another.... But in point of right all\r\nare equal, and you have no right to set up a system under which one of them\r\nis to be placed under moral suspicion or espionage, or to be made the\r\nconstant subject of invective.... The sixth principle is that ... subject\r\nto all the limitations that I have described, the foreign policy of England\r\nshould always be inspired by the love of freedom. There should be a\r\nsympathy with freedom, a desire to give it scope, founded not upon\r\nvisionary ideas, but upon the long experience of many generations within\r\nthe shores of this happy isle, that in freedom you lay the firmest\r\nfoundations both of loyalty and order; the firmest foundations for the\r\ndevelopment of individual character, and the best provision for the\r\nhappiness of the nation at large.... It is that sympathy, not a sympathy\r\nwith disorder, but, on the contrary, founded upon the deepest and most\r\nprofound love of order, ... which ought to be the very atmosphere in which\r\na Foreign Secretary of England ought to live and to move.\"[325] The most\r\nimportant of these general principles was that of the equality of nations,\r\n\"because, without recognizing that principle, there is no such thing as\r\npublic right, and without public international right there is no instrument\r\navailable for settling the transactions of mankind except material force.\r\nConsequently the principle of equality among nations lies ... at the very\r\nbasis and root of a Christian {278} civilization, and when that principle\r\nis compromised or abandoned, with it must depart our hopes of tranquillity\r\nand of progress for mankind.\" The policy of the Tory Government had been\r\n\"unregardful of public right, and it has been founded upon ... an untrue,\r\narrogant, and dangerous assumption that we were entitled to assume for\r\nourselves some dignity, which we should also be entitled to withhold from\r\nothers, and to claim on our part authority to do things which we would not\r\npermit to be done by others.\"[326] These general rules, to be applied, not\r\nin the temper of logical pedantry, but, like all general political rules,\r\nas far as the circumstances of each case will permit, form the complete\r\ntheory of a Liberal foreign policy.\r\n\r\nEvery one of Gladstone's principles had been violated by the Government.\r\nThe welfare of the people had been subordinated to a costly display of\r\nenergy abroad. The ordinary expenditure on armaments had increased by more\r\nthan six millions in five years, and a special vote of credit had been\r\nrequired by the quarrel with Russia. The acquisitions in the Transvaal, in\r\nZululand, in Cyprus, and in Afghanistan had increased our burdens without\r\nadding to our strength. Peace had always been in danger, and had more than\r\nonce been broken. The Government had claimed a peculiar right to dictate to\r\nTurkey, had threatened Russia with war for appearing to claim a similar\r\nright, and had made international action impossible by refusing to join the\r\nConcert of Europe. They had prevented Russia from making a separate treaty\r\nwith Turkey because it violated the Treaty of Paris, and they had\r\nthemselves made a treaty with Turkey which violated the Treaty of Paris in\r\nthe same way and to the same extent. They had made an indefinite engagement\r\nwith Turkey to go to war in defence of her Asiatic territory, no matter how\r\nshe abused her sovereign rights. They had been partial and capricious in\r\ntheir friendships and in their antipathies. Russia could do nothing right,\r\nTurkey could do nothing wrong. The claims of freedom had been ignored. The\r\nTransvaal had been annexed against the formally expressed wish of its\r\ninhabitants. {279} The Afghans had been coerced into accepting an envoy.\r\nNothing had been done to help the Bulgarians against the Turks, and when\r\nRussia undertook the work which England should have done, she had been\r\nopposed instead of helped. The worst thing that Gladstone said of his\r\nopponents is the worst thing that posterity can say of them. He quoted from\r\na dispatch of the Turkish Government: \"The Sultan's Ministers lay great\r\nstress on the maintenance of the Beaconsfield Cabinet, which has given so\r\nmany proofs of its benevolent intentions for the Turkish Empire.\" The\r\napprobation of these men, whose praise was blame, is more damning to the\r\nTory foreign policy of this period than any censure of their party enemies.\r\nGladstone made some mistakes in his general attack. But posterity has\r\nseldom been so nearly unanimous as in its belief that on his two main\r\nlines, Turkey and Afghanistan, he was completely right.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Liberal Ministry which succeeded that of Beaconsfield is\r\nnot a splendid record. The Cabinet and the party were in fact in process of\r\ndisintegration, and even without the Irish controversy, some new grouping\r\nof the parties would soon have taken place. All sections of the Liberals\r\nwere united in their dislike of the Imperialist foreign policy of their\r\npredecessors. But the younger men, headed by Mr. Chamberlain and Sir\r\nCharles Dilke, were aggressively Radical, deeply tinged with new theories\r\nabout land, capital and labour, and the unfair distribution of wealth.\r\nOlder men, like the Duke of Argyll, held by the individualist ideas of a\r\nprevious generation, and Goschen refused to join the Government at all\r\nbecause he objected to proposed extensions of the franchise. The internal\r\ndifferences of such a composite Ministry inevitably weakened it in the face\r\nof the enemy. The external difficulties were also unusually great. A trade\r\ndepression in 1878 and 1879 caused great distress among the working\r\nclasses. Ireland was again seething with discontent, the Land League had\r\nbegun a campaign against the payment of rent, and agrarian and political\r\ncrime soon attained to such proportions that it seemed as if Society would\r\nbe dissolved. In Parliament, the Irish Nationalists {280} made the\r\nobstruction of business a fine art, and the Fourth Party,[327] shouldering\r\nSir Stafford Northcote out of the leadership, conducted the Conservative\r\nOpposition with equal vigour and success. These different obstacles reduced\r\nthe real power of the Government below its apparent strength. But it\r\ncontrived, nevertheless, to apply Liberal principles with considerable\r\nsuccess, both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe progress of reform was along the lines which had been marked out by the\r\nlast Liberal Government. Education was made compulsory in 1881, almost\r\nwithout opposition. The household franchise, conferred upon dwellers in\r\ntowns by the Act of 1867, was extended to rural districts by an Act of\r\n1884, and so far as men were concerned, the right of the individual to\r\ncontrol his own government was thus secured, nearly a hundred years after\r\nthe French Revolution began. Almost more significant than this legislation\r\nas a mark of the appreciation of the voter was the construction of the\r\nmodern party machine on the model of Mr. Chamberlain's system in\r\nBirmingham. Electors are now grouped in wards and divisions, each section\r\nhaving its elected committee, and all linked up together in a central\r\ncaucus. Communication between voters and representatives has thus become\r\nmore direct than ever before, and the Member of Parliament is now\r\ncompletely subject to the authority of those whom he is supposed to govern.\r\nBoth parties, and the women auxiliaries who, about this time, were\r\norganized in connection with them, adopted this organization of public\r\nopinion between 1880 and 1890, and the effect on political life has been\r\nvery great. The common man is brought into direct touch with the machinery\r\nof the State, his information is more precise, and the expression of his\r\nwishes more effective. The party system as it exists to-day has in fact\r\ncompletely reversed the eighteenth-century theory of government. In 1812\r\nthe Legislature, within very wide limits, enforced the wishes of its\r\nmembers upon the people. In 1912 the people, within very {281} wide limits,\r\nenforced its wishes upon the members of the Legislature. Ministers have\r\nceased to be the leaders of the Houses in which they sit, and have become\r\nleaders of the people. Their appeal is direct to the constituencies, and it\r\nis among the rank and file of their party in the country that they find\r\ntheir strength. The new system is not without its dangers. If it is a more\r\nefficient check upon abuse of the common people than the old, it offers\r\nless freedom to the independent member, and where we once contrived party\r\nas a means of controlling our government, we are now rather inclined to\r\ncast about for some contrivance which will control our party. The extent to\r\nwhich the Cabinet, relying upon its hold over the party machine, is enabled\r\nto dictate its wishes to the members who depend upon that machine for their\r\nown success, is the greatest danger to real political freedom which at\r\npresent exists. The Cabinet is now almost as much a legislative as an\r\nexecutive body. But whatever the difficulties and the risks involved, the\r\nconstruction of this political machinery in 1880 was a distinct mark in the\r\nprogress of Liberalism.\r\n\r\nThe condition of women once more attracted the attention of a Liberal\r\nParliament. An Act of 1882 finally separated the wife from her husband in\r\nall matters concerned with property, and permitted her to make contracts,\r\nand to acquire, hold, and dispose of property as if she were a single\r\nwoman. Even this reform was incomplete. A husband is still responsible for\r\nall the civil wrongs of his wife, except those which consist in breach of\r\ncontract, and the year 1912 has seen a husband sent to prison because he\r\ncould not pay income tax on his wife's income which she earned by her own\r\nexertions and had not disclosed to him. But the existing relics of the old\r\nlegal theory which subjected the wife to the husband, and made him\r\nresponsible for her conduct as if she were a child, are not very numerous\r\nor important. Substantially, so far as the law allows, the wife has been\r\neconomically independent of her husband since 1882. The Contagious Diseases\r\nActs were suspended in 1883, and were finally repealed in 1886. In 1885 the\r\nCriminal Law {282} Amendment Act raised the age of consent to sixteen, and\r\npenalties were at last imposed upon those who procured women and girls for\r\nimmoral purposes. Another reform was effected by administrative act.\r\nProfessor Fawcett, the Postmaster-General, began to employ women in the\r\ninferior posts in his department, and so opened to the sex the whole of the\r\nlarge field of labour provided by the Civil Service. These successive\r\nimprovements in the state of women were made with little difficulty except\r\nsuch as sprang from ignorance, and the indifference of legislators to the\r\nspecial claims of disfranchised classes. As has always been the case,\r\npractical reforms were executed by the Legislature when the demand for the\r\nenfranchisement of women became urgent. This House of Commons actually\r\ncontained a majority who had promised to vote for Woman Suffrage. The\r\npledges, given in response to pressure from the women of the middle class,\r\nwere of that easy, good-natured sort in which Parliamentary candidates\r\nindulge in matters to which party is indifferent. The women trusted that\r\nthey would be carried into effect by an amendment of the Reform Bill of\r\n1884. But the House of Lords offered so much opposition to the Bill as it\r\nstood, that Gladstone spoke against the inclusion of women, and the\r\nproposal was defeated. The Toryism of class was destroyed. That of sex\r\nremained, and it was not until the Liberal revival of twenty years later\r\nthat it was ever again threatened.\r\n\r\nOn ancient subjects of party controversy temper again rose high. Church and\r\nChapel fought the last of many battles over the Burials Bill. The point\r\nraised by this measure was very simple. In more than 10,000 parishes the\r\nonly burial ground was the churchyard. In large towns, where there were\r\npublic cemeteries, and in districts where Nonconformists were wealthy, and\r\ncould purchase private ground, no difficulty arose. But in the other cases\r\nno Nonconformist could be buried except with the Burial Service of the\r\nEstablished Church. The service, however majestic in its language,\r\nexpressed opinions which were obnoxious to many Nonconformists, and the\r\nBurials Bill provided that any person might be buried in the yard of the\r\nparish church with {283} such religious service as his relatives desired.\r\nThe Church party, while claiming that the Church was the Church of the\r\nnation and not of a sect, protested against being deprived of the absolute\r\ncontrol of the public burial grounds. Any person might be buried there, but\r\nonly on such terms as they chose to appoint. It was a plain case of a\r\nconflict between public right and private privilege. The Bill had been\r\npassed four times by the last Liberal House of Commons. It was beaten in\r\nthe following Tory House. In the Parliament of 1880 it was at last accepted\r\nby the Lords, and the Nonconformist grievance was removed.\r\n\r\nA second religious controversy provided a useful illustration of the\r\ndifference between Liberalism and the Liberal party. The Nonconformist\r\nmembers, in debating the Burials Bill, had expressed the pure Liberal\r\ndoctrine that no man should be prevented from exercising a public right by\r\nhis opinions on matters of conscience. When they came to deal with Charles\r\nBradlaugh, many of them showed themselves to be as Tory in their essential\r\nhabit of mind as the most bigoted vicar who ever shut out a Quaker funeral\r\nfrom his churchyard. Bradlaugh was a dogmatic atheist, and as honest a man\r\nas was ever elected to Parliament. He was chosen for Northampton with Henry\r\nLabouchere, who was a man of no more Christian opinions and of much less\r\npure character than himself. Labouchere, like other easy-going men, had no\r\nscruples about taking the oath required from Members of Parliament;\r\nBradlaugh refused to swear, and claimed to make affirmation in the form\r\nprescribed by Statute for witnesses in courts of law. A Committee of the\r\nHouse decided against him, and he then offered to take the oath in the\r\nordinary way. There arose such a storm of bigotry and insolence as is\r\ngenerally to be found only in Orange Lodges. Gladstone and Bright, two men\r\nin whom Christianity was usually conspicuous, contended in vain, not only\r\nagainst Tories, but against those of their own party whose religious\r\ntolerance did not extend beyond the Jews. It was resolved that Bradlaugh\r\ncould neither swear nor affirm, and when he refused to withdraw he was\r\ncommitted to the Clock Tower. Eventually, he made affirmation and took his\r\nseat, {284} speaking on several occasions with good sense. But the matter\r\nwas not ended. An informer obtained a judgment against him in the King's\r\nBench Division, and his seat was declared vacant. He was re-elected, and\r\nagain attempted to enter the House. On this occasion he was thrown out by\r\nthe police. A third election sent him back again, and he sat for some time\r\nbelow the bar of the House. In 1883 a special Bill was introduced which\r\nenabled any person, who thought fit, to make affirmation instead of taking\r\nan oath. It was thrown out. Bradlaugh resigned, and was elected for the\r\nfourth time in February, 1884. But it was not until the end of this\r\nParliament, and after an enormous waste of time, energy, and money in\r\nagitation and litigation, that his struggle came to an end. He was elected\r\nto the new Parliament of 1885, and took the oath without serious\r\nopposition. In 1888 he himself introduced and carried through the enabling\r\nBill. In 1891, when he died, all the hostile resolutions were expunged from\r\nthe records of the House, and freedom of conscience received at last full\r\nrecognition.\r\n\r\nThe whole proceeding did little credit to a Liberal House of Commons.\r\nParliament had been opened to Dissenters in 1828, to Catholics in 1829, and\r\nto Jews in 1858. If these reforms had any significance at all, they meant\r\nthat for political posts only political tests were to be applied, and that\r\na man's opinions upon subjects which were not political were not the\r\nconcern of the State. Liberty of thinking is one and indivisible. As\r\nGladstone, himself the most dogmatic of Churchmen, put it, \"On every\r\nreligious ground, as well as on every political ground, the true and the\r\nwise course is not to deal out religious liberty by halves, quarters, and\r\nfractions, but to deal it out entire, and make no distinctions between man\r\nand man on the ground of religious differences from one end of the land to\r\nthe other.\"[328] Every argument which could shut out Bradlaugh could shut\r\nout a Quaker or a Wesleyan. The atheist was to the Nonconformist of the\r\nday, what the Nonconformist had been to the Churchman of 1800, a person who\r\nheld opinions other than his own. {285} Experience of toleration should\r\nhave satisfied those who could not see truth by their own light. The ablest\r\nmen in the Cabinet were of the utmost possible diversity of religious\r\nbelief. The Prime Minister was a High Churchman, Lord Hartington was a Low\r\nChurchman, Bright was a Quaker, Mr. Chamberlain was a Unitarian, Forster\r\nbelonged to no Church and professed no creed. But there were members of the\r\nLiberal party who tolerated this latitude in their leaders, and yet could\r\nnot bear the society of an avowed atheist. They drew the line at God. The\r\ncase was made somewhat worse by Bradlaugh's opinions on the limitation of\r\npopulation. But the real weight of the charge against him was that he did\r\nnot believe in the existence of a deity, and was sufficiently honest and\r\nsufficiently public-spirited to endeavour to preach his gospel. Some\r\nLiberals abstained from voting in these divisions. Others joined the most\r\nbigoted and reactionary of their usual opponents, and used arguments\r\nagainst Bradlaugh which, if logically applied, would have excluded from\r\nParliament more than one of the best men in the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nWhile old issues were thus fought out, the new economics made a further\r\nimpression upon legislation. Fawcett again led the way by making the Post\r\nOffice extend its activities farther into the field of private enterprise,\r\nand experiment as a Savings Bank, in the creation of annuities, and in the\r\nmanagement of the telegraph. About this time also began the modern\r\ndevelopment of municipal trading, which has converted the local authority\r\nfrom a mere regulating body to a body which supplies the means of light,\r\nheat, and locomotion to the inhabitants of its area. The debts of English\r\nmunicipalities in 1875 amounted to about L93,000,000. In 1905 they were\r\nabout L483,000,000, and the bulk of this increase is represented by the\r\nvarious gas, water, electricity, and tramway enterprises which are managed\r\nby the local bodies. All this large part of national industry is now\r\nmonopolized by collective management, and it is not now denied that on the\r\nwhole the public wants are better supplied by these municipal monopolies\r\nthan by the competition of private traders.\r\n\r\nAn extension of national and municipal enterprises was {286} accompanied by\r\nmore direct legislative restrictions upon economic freedom. The Employers'\r\nLiability Act of 1880 began the series of statutes which have compelled\r\nemployers to insure their workmen against accident. The legal doctrine of\r\n\"common employment\" had produced a stupid state of affairs. A man who was\r\ninjured through the negligence of another man's servant, acting in his\r\nemployer's business, might recover damages from the employer. But if both\r\nmen were the servants of the same employer, and if the transaction in which\r\nthe injury was inflicted was part of their common business as servants of\r\nthe same master, no claim for compensation was allowed. A master was liable\r\nfor the negligence of his workmen to everybody but his other workmen. The\r\nAct of 1880, in the face of loud opposition from employers of all parties,\r\nto some extent abolished this absurd distinction, and made the master\r\nliable to his men for injuries sustained through the negligence of his\r\nsuperintendents or foremen. An Act giving the English tenant the right to\r\nkill game on his own land was followed by an Agricultural Holdings Act,\r\nwhich entitled him to compensation against his landlord for unexhausted\r\nimprovements. In 1884, in response to an agitation which had nothing to do\r\nwith party, the Government appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the\r\nhousing of the poor, and thus prepared for an extension of the system which\r\nhad been begun by their predecessors.[329] But the most striking economic\r\nexperiment made by this Liberal Government, as by the last, was made in\r\nIreland. The condition of that country was now more dangerous than at any\r\ntime since the Rebellion of 1798. The wholesale and systematic depopulation\r\nof the country by rack-renting and evictions had demoralized and degraded\r\nthose whom it had not driven out of the country or starved to death, and\r\nthroughout the most congested districts no spirit was to be found {287} but\r\nhatred of the landlords and the English connection. Boycotting had now been\r\ninvented, and boycotting was accompanied by agrarian outrages of the most\r\nbrutal description. The Land League was supreme. Rents could not be\r\ncollected. No man would work for a tenant who paid his rent, or for a man\r\nwho took a farm from which a former tenant had been evicted. The whole\r\ncountry seemed to be in sympathy with the Moonlighters and maimers of\r\ncattle, informers were murdered or intimidated, and the perpetrators of\r\nsome of the most atrocious crimes were never discovered. The Government\r\napplied itself at once to the suppression of disorder and to the redress of\r\ngrievances. Drastic Coercion Acts armed the executive with new powers, and\r\nin 1881 Gladstone introduced and carried, practically single-handed, a new\r\nLand Act.\r\n\r\nThis Act went farther than any previous Act of Parliament in interfering\r\nwith freedom of contract. It strained the relations of the two sections of\r\nthe Cabinet almost to breaking point, and the Duke of Argyll actually\r\nresigned. The Act of 1870 had provided that the tenant should be\r\ncompensated for eviction except in case of non-payment of rent. The\r\nexception took nine-tenths of the virtue out of the Act. The country was\r\ncrowded with poor people who wanted land and could not live without it. The\r\ntenant got no compensation so long as he kept his farm, and so long as he\r\nkept it he was rack-rented. If he was at last evicted, he was probably no\r\nbetter off for his compensation, because he had little chance of getting a\r\nsecond farm on any better conditions than the first. In these\r\ncircumstances, bad landlords did very much as they pleased, and a Royal\r\nCommission reported that \"Freedom of contract did not in fact exist.\"[330]\r\nThe tenant was at the mercy of the landlord in every case. The Government\r\ntherefore stepped in to protect him, on the principle that interference is\r\njustified \"where the necessities of one of the parties to a bargain deprive\r\nhis seeming freedom of choice of all substance.\"[331] Their Bill accepted\r\nthe recommendations of the {288} Royal Commission, and established what\r\nwere known as \"the three F's,\" fair rent, fixity of tenure, and freedom of\r\nsale. The amount of the rent was to be fixed by an impartial Land Court.\r\nThe tenant was to pay this rent for fifteen years, after which it might be\r\nrevised. The right to remain in the holding at this rent was to be\r\ntransferable to any purchaser. No tenant whose land was worth less than\r\nL200 a year could contract himself out of the benefits of the Act. This\r\nsweeping reform prevented the rack-renting of tenants. But the state of\r\nIreland was now such as no remedies could affect. Parnell, the Irish\r\nNationalist leader, was imprisoned in October, and all the extraordinary\r\npowers of the executive were employed. But in 1882 Lord Frederick\r\nCavendish, the newly appointed Secretary for Ireland, was brutally murdered\r\nin Phoenix Park, and the release of Mr. Parnell, and an Act for\r\nextinguishing arrears of rent, were accompanied by new measures of\r\ncoercion. Two years of hard administration of the law suppressed the\r\ndisorder. But the national feeling was as ill as ever, and no Liberal\r\nMinistry could confound the maintenance of order with government. To\r\nproduce moral corruption in his subjects is the worst wrong of which any\r\ngovernor can be capable, and coercion disgraces government more than it\r\npunishes crime. The disease of lawlessness was not to be cured by the mere\r\nsuppression of its symptoms. So long as the temper of the people remains\r\nunchanged, obedience to the commands of authority is worth little or\r\nnothing. The attempt to find a new method of Irish government in 1885\r\nsettled the course of English politics for a whole generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo disasters overtook the Government in foreign affairs. The first\r\noccurred in the Transvaal, and it was entirely their own fault. They had\r\ncriticized the annexation when it took place: it had obviously been carried\r\nthrough in haste and contrary to the wishes of the inhabitants, and the\r\nright and wise course was to withdraw. Crown Colony Government, which meant\r\ngovernment by Sir Owen Lanyon, an honest but unsympathetic official, had\r\nbrought the Boers to the verge of revolt by the time that the {289}\r\nLiberals came into office. They were in fact restrained only by their\r\nconfidence that a change of government would mean a change of policy. But\r\nthis very absence of turbulence deceived the new Ministry. They were\r\nofficially informed that the Boers were reconciled to British rule, and\r\nGladstone, Bright, and Chamberlain were overruled by their less Liberal\r\ncolleagues. Unofficial warnings went astray, arrived too late, or were\r\ndisregarded. By January, 1881, the Boers were in arms, and had repulsed Sir\r\nGeorge Colley at Laing's Nek. The Government, at last aware that the\r\npopulation of the Transvaal wanted independence, opened negotiations. A\r\nrash move by Colley produced the defeat at Majuba and his own death.\r\n\r\nThe situation was now such that the Government could gain little credit,\r\neven by doing what was right. They had the choice of three alternatives.\r\nThey could defeat the Boers and keep the Transvaal. They could defeat the\r\nBoers and give up the Transvaal. They could stop fighting and give up the\r\nTransvaal. The first meant that in order to avenge a defeat in a battle\r\nwhich ought never to have been fought they should do some more men to\r\ndeath, and then keep a country which they confessed they should never have\r\ntaken. Having been guilty in the first place of robbery, they should\r\nendeavour to repair its consequences by murder, and having made it\r\ndifficult to work with the Boers by apparent insincerity, they were to make\r\nit impossible by deliberate cruelty. The second course meant simply that\r\nthey should do men to death to gratify their own wounded vanity. Either\r\ncourse was brutal, and the first was also stupid. No Liberal Government,\r\nwith the case of Ireland before its eyes, could undertake the permanent\r\ndomination of a free white people by force of arms. The Ministry, in the\r\nface of a loud outcry from those who believed that the strength of England\r\nconsisted in her readiness to assert her own brute strength at the expense\r\nof others, chose the third way out of the difficulty. What was right before\r\nMajuba was not wrong after Majuba. The negotiations which had been begun\r\nwere allowed to proceed. No more lives were destroyed, and the Transvaal\r\nregained its independence, subject {290} to some vague provisions for\r\nBritish suzerainty. In 1884 all references to this suzerainty were struck\r\nout of the Convention by the hand of the Colonial Secretary himself, and\r\nthere is no question that it was then implied that England waived all right\r\nto interfere in the domestic concerns of the Dutch Republic. The Government\r\nacted as a Liberal Government was bound to act. It preferred to act\r\naccording to moral rules, and to do what it thought right without regard to\r\nthe protests of national egoism. This was the moral and the courageous\r\ncourse. But tardy moral courage is not an adequate political substitute for\r\ntimely wisdom. For twenty years the two races cherished the memories of\r\nthis miserable episode, and the recollections of wounded pride on the one\r\nhand and of hard-won triumph on the other were at last found to be\r\nexcellent fuel for the flames of a second war.\r\n\r\nThe blunders of the Government in South Africa were balanced by other\r\nblunders in North Africa. Beaconsfield had declined to occupy Egypt openly\r\nand with the sanction of the Concert of Europe. Gladstone stumbled into it\r\nagainst his will, asking in vain for European sanction, and protesting his\r\nintention to withdraw at the earliest possible moment. Never was such a\r\nsuccessful experiment in government begun in such an irresolute and\r\nunmethodical way. The details of the occupation of Egypt are not important\r\nfor this book. The main outlines are clear enough. To increase the extent\r\nof the Empire by the appropriation of any country was a violation of the\r\nprinciples of the Midlothian speeches, and there is no question that the\r\nentry into Egypt was made with misgiving and reluctance. But circumstances\r\nwere too strong, and for the first and last time in his life Gladstone\r\nmasqueraded in the trappings of Imperialism.\r\n\r\nEgypt, nominally subject to the Sultan of Egypt, had long enjoyed an\r\ninsolvent independence under its Khedive. In 1879 its finances had been\r\nentrusted, in the interest of foreign bondholders, to the joint control of\r\nEngland and France, represented for the purpose by a large and costly army\r\nof officials. The entanglement of England in Egypt was thus the first\r\nexample of what is now a common political case, the disposition of the\r\n{291} fortunes of a whole people by its investing class. Plutocracy was\r\nbeginning to usurp the temper, as well as the place, of aristocracy. In\r\n1881 a revolt began, which was partly due to military discontent, and\r\npartly to a nationalist dislike of foreign domination. Had the British\r\nGovernment been free to act as they pleased, they would probably have\r\nabstained from interference, and would have recognized and supported the\r\nfirst Nationalist Government of Egypt, whatever its constitution might have\r\nbeen. But their hands were tied by the financial arrangements of their\r\npredecessors. The Khedive was acting under the advice of England and\r\nFrance, and could not be deserted. When the revolt became fanatical, and\r\nEuropeans were massacred in the streets of Alexandria, there was no longer\r\nany room for choice. The other Powers declined to interfere, France\r\nwithdrew when it came to the use of armed force, and the revolt was\r\nsuppressed by English ships and English troops. One step after another led\r\nEngland deeper into occupation. In 1883 the Dual Control was abolished, and\r\nSir Auckland Colvin became the sole Financial Adviser of the Khedive. By\r\n1885 British financial control was established throughout Egypt, and\r\nevacuation, though the intention of it was not abandoned by either Liberals\r\nor Conservatives for some time afterwards, really became impossible. The\r\ntotal effect of this new acquisition can hardly yet be estimated. It was\r\ninfinitely less equivocal in origin than our conquest of India, and the\r\nmaterial benefits which it has conferred upon the native population are\r\nimmense. The real test of its temper will arise when the Egyptians desire\r\nto take the control of their own affairs into their own hands. If the\r\nBritish bureaucracy can surrender its supremacy as generously as, on the\r\nwhole, it has employed it, it will prove itself a miracle of magnanimity.\r\nIn the meantime, the events of this time are important as marking the\r\nintrusion of high finance into foreign politics, and the beginning of a\r\nseries of huge extensions of territory, which have reacted very forcibly\r\nupon the fortunes of the British peoples.\r\n\r\nThe Gladstone Government, having been pushed and dragged into Egypt, was at\r\nleast determined to go no farther. A wise {292} application of Liberal\r\nprinciple was the withdrawal from the Soudan. The death of General Gordon,\r\nwho ought never to have been sent to Khartoum, has invested this operation\r\nwith an unreal significance. To conquer and hold the southern provinces\r\nwould have been as difficult and as costly as to conquer and hold\r\nAfghanistan. Being in Egypt, the Government wisely decided to restrict\r\ntheir responsibilities. The reorganization of finance was the first\r\ncondition of the conquest of the Soudan, and a few years later the swift,\r\nsuccessful, and cheap campaign of Lord Kitchener did what could at that\r\ntime only have been done at the cost of enormous financial burdens. The\r\nwisdom of the policy of evacuation is not now questioned. But the loss of\r\nGordon, due as much to his own disobedience to orders as to the tardiness\r\nof the Government, was very damaging to their reputation. They ought either\r\nto have kept out of Egypt altogether, or to have gone into it with a\r\ndetermination to do the work thoroughly. A vote of censure was averted in\r\nFebruary, 1885, by only fourteen votes, and it was obvious that the days of\r\nthe Government were numbered.\r\n\r\nOne flash of vigour illuminated their decline. The Ameer of Afghanistan, by\r\nthe judicious treatment of Lord Ripon and Lord Dufferin, had been converted\r\ninto a firm friend of Great Britain. An advance by Russia in Central Asia\r\nmade some definition of boundaries necessary, and while negotiations\r\nbetween the two Powers were in progress some Russian troops made an attack\r\nupon Afghans in Penjdeh. The Government promptly obtained a vote of credit\r\nfor six and a half millions, and showed Russia plainly that, however\r\nanxious they were to restrict the extent of the Empire, they were ready at\r\nall times to defend those peoples whom they had taken under their\r\nprotection. The dispute was referred to the arbitration of the King of\r\nDenmark. The reference was denounced by the Tories as a cowardly surrender.\r\nThe Liberals were content with the victory of morality over prestige. This\r\naffair took place in April. In the middle of June the Government,\r\ndistracted by the prospect of more coercion in Ireland, resigned, and Lord\r\nSalisbury became Prime Minister. {293}\r\n\r\nIn spite of their difficulties, this Liberal Ministry had contrived to do\r\nmuch for the cause of Liberalism. They had extended the control of the\r\nindividual over his government to substantially all men. They had raised\r\nthe value of women. They had removed one of the few remaining disabilities\r\nof the Dissenters. They had restored freedom to the Transvaal, and saved\r\nincalculable expense to both Great Britain and India by withdrawing from\r\nAfghanistan. They had blundered into Imperialism in Egypt, and though they\r\nhad treated Ireland without egoism, like all their predecessors they had\r\nfailed to pacify it. In the new spirit of collectivism they had stepped in\r\nbetween the economically weak and the economically strong. The Irish\r\npeasant had been further protected against the Irish landlord. The English\r\nfarmers had got compensation for improvements and the right to protect\r\ntheir crops against game. Something had been done to get the poor into\r\nbetter houses. Workmen had got some protection against the negligence of\r\ntheir employers. The record of emancipation in the various fields of class,\r\nof sex, of race, and of wealth was respectable, if not glorious. Everything\r\nexcept the state of Ireland indicated the future course of Liberalism with\r\nclearness. Mr. Chamberlain expressed the opinions of the advance guard when\r\nhe demanded the reform of the House of Lords, the compulsory purchase of\r\nland for agricultural holdings, free as well as compulsory education, the\r\ndisestablishment of the Church, and a graduated income tax. This was the\r\nwork to be done, to reduce the power of aristocracy in government, which\r\nhad been displayed of late in more than one conflict between the two\r\nHouses, to perfect the equalization of sects in the State, to employ the\r\nsuperfluity of wealth in mitigating the conditions in which poverty lived.\r\nBut the actual course of events was determined by the state of Ireland.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{294}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE IMPERIALIST REACTION\r\n\r\nThe condition of Ireland was now forced upon the attention of both parties.\r\nThe Irish Nationalist party had demanded Home Rule since Parnell assumed\r\nthe leadership in 1879. The General Election of 1885 gave this demand a\r\nforce which it had never possessed before. The extension of the franchise\r\nby the Act of 1884 gave a much larger representation to agricultural\r\nIreland, and agricultural Ireland was wholly Nationalist. Out of\r\neighty-nine contests Parnell's party won eighty-five. All the fourteen\r\nLiberal Irish members were thrown out. The Protestant half of Ulster\r\nremained Tory and returned seventeen members. But the general sense of the\r\ncountry was made clear. Parnell, so long denounced by both English parties\r\nas the head of a faction, was now manifestly what he had always claimed to\r\nbe, the leader of a nation. Strong and resolute English government had\r\nhopelessly failed. Crime was suppressed. But no Nationalist had been\r\nconverted by punishment into a good citizen. Egoistic government by England\r\ncould not succeed. Altruistic government by England could not succeed. The\r\nonly alternative was the government of Ireland by Ireland.\r\n\r\nBoth English parties showed signs of a change of temper. Gladstone had\r\nhinted in his first Midlothian Speeches at a general devolution of local\r\ncontrol upon England, Scotland, and Ireland,[332] and in his election\r\naddress in 1885 he declared that, subject to the unity of the Empire being\r\npreserved, grants of such control {295} to portions of the country averted\r\ndanger and increased strength. Mr. Chamberlain denounced government by\r\nofficials at Dublin Castle as heartily as any Nationalist could have\r\nwished. Mr. Childers pronounced definitely for Home Rule. The other side\r\nhinted at a complete change of policy. They appointed, in Lord Carnarvon, a\r\nLord-Lieutenant who was known to be in sympathy with Home Rule, and he\r\nactually entered into informal negotiations with Parnell. They declined to\r\nrenew the last Coercion Act, and Lord Salisbury at Newport, Lord Carnarvon\r\nin the Lords, and Sir Michael Hicks-Beach and Lord Randolph Churchill in\r\nthe Commons denounced coercion with different degrees of vigour.[333] So\r\nfar as the political leaders were concerned, the most definite opposition\r\nto Home Rule came from the Liberal Lord Hartington. But everything pointed\r\nto the abandonment of government by force and the substitution for it of\r\ngovernment by sympathy. Parnell actually instructed Irish Nationalists in\r\nall constituencies to vote against the Liberals.\r\n\r\nThe election gave the Parliament into the hands of the Nationalists. The\r\nLiberals had a majority of eighty-five over the Conservatives, and Parnell\r\ncommanded exactly eighty-five votes. The Government were beaten on an\r\namendment to the Address, and the Liberals came into office dependent on\r\nthe Nationalist vote. If they had had any reluctance to introduce a Home\r\nRule Bill, they must have been beaten in their turn. But Gladstone's line\r\nof action had been sketched with sufficient definition to make it clear\r\nthat he would introduce some measure for the better government of Ireland,\r\nand Lord Hartington, Goschen, Bright, and Sir Henry James refused on that\r\nground to join the Ministry. Before the Bill was introduced Mr. Chamberlain\r\nand Mr. Trevelyan resigned, and the disruption of the Liberal party began.\r\nThe Bill was laid before the House on the 8th April, 1886. It proposed to\r\nestablish an Irish {296} Parliament and an Irish Executive responsible to\r\nit. Law and police were included in their powers, but the establishment and\r\nendowment of religion were not, nor were the Customs. Ireland was to levy\r\ntaxes and to pay one-twelfth of the British revenue to the Imperial\r\nTreasury. This Bill was accompanied by a Land Purchase Bill, under which\r\nthe landlords might be bought out on the security of British credit.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the Home Rule proposals was that of Liberal policy since\r\n1868. The attempt to govern Ireland from England was to be given up, and\r\nthe right of the Irish people to have an Irish Government was to be\r\nrecognized, in the only possible way, by putting the government under the\r\ncontrol of Irish representatives. \"The fault of the administrative system\r\nof Ireland,\" said Gladstone, \"is simply this--that its spring and source of\r\naction is English, and not Irish.... Without having an Irish Parliament, I\r\nwant to know how you will bring about this result, that your administrative\r\nsystem shall be Irish and not English?\"[334] Recognition of the principle\r\nof local independence would, it was hoped, be followed by a union between\r\nthe two peoples stronger than the union of mere form. \"British force,\" said\r\nThomas Burt, one of the three working men in the Commons, \"could do a great\r\ndeal; but it could not make a real and genuine union between one people and\r\nanother. That was only possible on a moral basis.\"[335] Home Rule, with all\r\nits possible risks, was the Liberal substitute for government which was\r\nalien, and consequently costly, obnoxious, and unsuccessful. It was not\r\nthat Englishmen and Irishmen were by nature so discordant that they could\r\nnot manage their joint affairs in harmony. As a problem of race differences\r\nthe Irish problem need never have existed. But artificial means had been\r\nemployed to produce a divergence of character almost as complete as the\r\ndivergence of East and West, of Europe and Asia. Successive English\r\nGovernments had first imagined and then in fact produced such an\r\nincompatibility of temper as generally arises between nationalities so\r\ndistinct as Turk and Slav, or German {297} and Magyar, or Russian and Finn.\r\nAs Mr. Balfour has recently put it, \"The difficulty is not that when\r\nEngland went to Ireland it had to face nationality. The difficulty is that\r\nthe behaviour of England in Ireland has produced nationality.\"[336] With\r\nthis creation of her own selfish folly England had now to deal. Gladstone\r\nproposed to fuse the ancestral antipathies in the common management of\r\ncommon affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Tories had several mighty weapons. They appealed to Conservatives to\r\ndefend the Union. They appealed to Nonconformists against the threat of\r\nCatholic domination in Ireland. They appealed to law-abiding citizens\r\nagainst concession to violence, and against the gift of supremacy to a\r\npolitical party which had not condemned, if it had not encouraged,\r\nintimidation and murder. They appealed to the less worthy motives of\r\nLiberals against whom Parnell had thrown the weight of his authority at the\r\nelection. They appealed to the timid persons who listened to the threats of\r\nUlster rebellion. They hinted at the development of municipal government.\r\nBut they did nothing to solve what Mr. John Morley told them was the\r\nimmediate problem of the hour, \"How are you to govern Ireland?\"[337] They\r\ninsisted, as usual, upon forms. They spoke of the greatness of the Empire\r\nand the wickedness of severance, of the cost to the taxpayer and of\r\npossible difficulties in case of foreign war. Much of the criticism of\r\ndetail was just, and there was emphasis of mechanical difficulties which\r\nwas sound enough. But nothing was expressed, in or out of Parliament, which\r\nshowed that the Opposition could contrive any system which should satisfy\r\nthe first condition of good government, that it should be acceptable to the\r\ngoverned. The most powerful Tory argument was the shocking history of\r\nagrarian crime. The sole argument which had moral force behind it was the\r\nargument that the Ulster Protestants would be persecuted by the Catholic\r\nNationalists. Those who had used every engine of oppression to degrade and\r\ndemoralize their religious enemies had a very {298} genuine fear that the\r\nhour of retaliation had arrived. If there had been any real chance for the\r\nNationalists, at the very gates of England, to avenge all the wrongs that\r\ntheir race had suffered at the hands of Ulster, this risk would have been\r\nenough to deter even Gladstone from Home Rule.\r\n\r\nThe Tory alternative was announced by Lord Salisbury to the Union of\r\nConservative Associations on the 15th May. In a passage which contained a\r\nreference to Hottentots and Hindus, he declared that the Irish were\r\nincapable of self-government. His policy was \"that Parliament should enable\r\nthe Government of England to govern Ireland. Apply that recipe honestly and\r\nresolutely for twenty years, and at the end of that time you will find that\r\nIreland will be fit to accept any gifts in the way of local government or\r\nrepeal of coercion laws that you may wish to give her. What she wants is\r\ngovernment--government that does not flinch, that does not vary.\" In plain\r\nEnglish, government by consent was to come to an end. The Irish were not to\r\ncontrol their own political affairs. They were to be kept in subjection to\r\na people whom they had every reason to regard as alien, and such force was\r\nto be applied as should be necessary. The temper of Roman ascendancy,\r\napplied by Palmerston to weak States like Greece, and by Disraeli to\r\nuncivilized tribes like the Afghans, was thus to be exerted over a people\r\nwho, in all parts of the Empire, had shown themselves as capable of\r\nmanaging political affairs as any nation in Europe. Disraeli had preached\r\nthe gospel of \"Empire and Liberty.\" His successor preached the gospel of\r\n\"Empire before Liberty.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 8th June the Bill was defeated on the second reading. No less than\r\nninety-three Liberals voted with the Opposition, and the party broke into\r\npieces. The General Election completed its ruin. Before Parliament was\r\ndissolved, a violent outbreak of Protestant savagery in Belfast was\r\nsuppressed by force of arms, and all the devils of racial and religious\r\nascendancy were awake. Egoism was reinforced by the ordinary reluctance of\r\nConservatism, by a very honest hatred of agrarian crime, and by an equally\r\nhonest if less reasonable fear of religious persecution. The Liberals were\r\n{299} driven from the field in headlong rout, and the majority against Home\r\nRule was more than 120. Gladstone came into office again in 1892. But he\r\nwas without the essentials of power. The main current of political thought\r\nremained Tory for twenty years.\r\n\r\nThis general political temper was Tory and not Conservative. It was more\r\npositively reactionary than at any time since the Reform Act of 1832.\r\nPeel's so-called Tory administration of 1841 contained many Liberal\r\nelements. The Tory Ministries, which filled in the gaps in the subsequent\r\nperiod of Whig ascendancy, were too short-lived to make any definite\r\nexpression of principles of government. The Toryism of the Disraeli Cabinet\r\nwas most marked in foreign policy, and at home made little display. But\r\nbetween 1885 and 1905 the temper of the dominant party was definitely and\r\nconsistently Tory, and there was hardly any problem that it touched which\r\nit did not stamp with the brand of Toryism. The prime cause of this\r\nreaction was the dispute about Home Rule. The victory of Toryism in the\r\ncontroversy of 1886 had much the same effect upon general politics as a\r\nvictory in the American War a hundred years earlier would have had. It\r\ncould only be gained by arguments which applied universally, and not only\r\nin the particular case. The temper of the government of Ireland must be the\r\ntemper of the government of Great Britain and the Empire.\r\n\r\nEven among Conservatives this Irish policy was sometimes described in\r\nlanguage which it deserved. No Liberal could put the case against Mr.\r\nBalfour's system more concisely than Sir Michael Hicks-Beach when he warned\r\nhis constituents against \"our favourite English habit of measuring\r\neverything by the English rule, of bringing English prejudice to bear upon\r\nthe settlement of Irish affairs, and of looking upon Irishmen as our\r\ninferiors rather than our equals.\"[338] This was the very temper of Mr.\r\nBalfour, who believed that all the law and all the civilization in Ireland\r\nare the work of England.[339] No Liberal ever {300} suggested that the\r\ndifficulties of Irish government had nothing to do with the character of\r\nthe Irish people. But no Liberal ever had any doubt that the character of\r\nthe Irish people, as it appeared in 1886, was very largely due to\r\ndeliberately vicious and demoralizing abuse of them by their English\r\nconquerors. Mr. Balfour preferred to deal with them in the manner of a\r\nstatesman who wished them well, but was convinced that they could do no\r\ngood with themselves. Every manifestation of Irish discontent was thus\r\nattributed to a natural incapacity for good behaviour under government.\r\nOutrage and violence never attained in this Tory period to the proportions\r\nwith which the last Liberal Government had had to deal. But coercion was\r\napplied as unsparingly as ever, and almost with cheerfulness. A Crimes Act,\r\na permanent Coercion Act, was passed in 1887, and under its powers the\r\nIrish Executive might, by proclamation, apply it to any part of the country\r\nwhenever it pleased. Under this Act not only were agrarian crimes punished\r\nand the armed forces of the Crown employed to collect rents and evict\r\ntenants, but Irish newspapers were suppressed, and Irish members who made\r\nspeeches no more criminal than those of innumerable English, Scottish, and\r\nWelsh Liberals were imprisoned with all the degrading incidents of cells,\r\nclothing, and discipline which were forced upon common felons. Ireland was\r\ngoverned as Egypt and India were governed, and a race which had shown\r\nitself in other countries perfectly competent to sustain freedom of\r\ndiscussion and representative institutions was treated in that despotic\r\ntemper which was elsewhere reserved for people of colour. Two incidents\r\ndisplayed this Toryism at its very worst. The first was the affair of\r\nMitchelstown. The second was the Parnell Commission.\r\n\r\nBut before either of these events illustrated the mental habit of Toryism,\r\nanother had displayed its complete futility. Under the land Act of 1881\r\nrents all over Ireland had been fixed for fifteen years. Immediately\r\nafterwards the prices of agricultural produce began to fall, and the rents\r\nwhich had been thought fair became unfair. Good landlords reduced their\r\ndemands of their own free {301} will. The type of landlord which was more\r\ncommon in Ireland than anywhere else in the world spoke of \"the sacredness\r\nof judicial rents,\" and exacted the last penny of their dues. The usual\r\nprocess of eviction, starvation, and riot began. The Plan of Campaign was\r\nformed by the more determined Nationalists. Tenants who paid more than they\r\nthought fit were to meet and agree what rents they should offer to their\r\nlandlord. If these were refused, the money was paid to a central fund,\r\nwhich was used to resist evictions. This was a criminal conspiracy. But\r\ncriminal conspiracies are common in countries whose economic history\r\nresembles that of Ireland, and this had at least the merit of being free\r\nfrom violence and outrage. A Royal Commission inquired into the working of\r\nthe Act of 1881, and reported in favour of a revision of judicial rents.\r\nLord Salisbury, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, and Mr. Balfour declared\r\nemphatically that they would never interfere with the rents.[340] They\r\nintroduced a Land Bill in March, 1887. This Bill allowed leaseholders, who\r\nhad been excluded from the Act of 1881, to obtain the benefits of its\r\nprovisions. The Bill said nothing about revision. But Nature knew nothing\r\nof racial and religious distinctions. The fall in prices had been\r\nuniversal, and the tenants of Ulster complained as loudly as the tenants of\r\nConnaught. The Government gave way, and amended the Bill. Then the\r\nlandlords set up an outcry, and the amendment was withdrawn. The tenants\r\nagain raised their voices, and seeing that to hold out meant that Ulster\r\nand Nationalist Ireland might agree to subordinate their jealousies to\r\ntheir common grievance, the Government again surrendered. When passed, the\r\nAct provided for the revision of judicial rents. The first of the twenty\r\nyears of resolute government had ended in a fresh triumph for agrarian\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nConcession involved no change in temper. On the 9th September, 1887, a\r\nmeeting was held at Mitchelstown, at which English Members of Parliament\r\nand English ladies were present. It was not illegal, and no attempt was\r\nmade to suppress {302} it. But the police wished to have a shorthand note\r\nof the speeches, and with gross and unpardonable folly endeavoured to force\r\na reporter through the crowd. A squabble began, the police were hustled and\r\nbeaten with sticks, they retreated to their barracks and fired upon the\r\npeople who followed them, and three men were killed. All the facts except\r\none were obscure. There was no question that the police should have applied\r\nfor accommodation on or near the platform, instead of using force to\r\nintroduce their reporter. What happened afterwards required thorough\r\ninvestigation. A coroner's jury returned a verdict of wilful murder against\r\nsix officers, but this was quashed on technical grounds by the High Court.\r\nNo other inquiry ever took place, though every means was used to put\r\npressure on the Government. Their duty was plain. Even if no policeman had\r\nbeen technically guilty of crime, it was clear that there had been an\r\natrocious blunder. The Government was bound to make a strict investigation,\r\nand to punish by censure, reduction of rank, or dismissal from the force\r\nthe officers who were responsible. Mr. Balfour did nothing of the kind. He\r\ntreated the affair of Mitchelstown as the Tories of 1819 had treated the\r\naffair of Peterloo. Before any thorough inquiry could have been made, he\r\ndeclared that the police were free from blame, and he never made any\r\nattempt to do justice between them and the public. Only one meaning was to\r\nbe attached to his action. His policy was crudely egoistic. The English\r\nGovernment was to decide at its pleasure by what rules of conduct it was to\r\nbe bound in its dealings with Ireland, and considerations of morality were\r\nto be subordinated to the convenience of the executive. Gladstone appealed\r\nto the British people to \"remember Mitchelstown,\" and the affair became a\r\npotent weapon in the hands of the Liberals. To refuse inquiry where injury\r\nhas been done to the person is the most unfortunate thing that an English\r\nstatesman can do. Not even the memories of agrarian crime could prevent\r\nsober people from being alienated by this refusal of the opportunity of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nThe Parnell Commission was equally ugly. During April, {303} 1887, the\r\n_Times_ newspaper published a series of articles which endeavoured to prove\r\nthat the Nationalist party were responsible for agrarian outrages of the\r\nworst kind. On the 18th of the month it printed what professed to be a\r\nletter from Parnell. If genuine, the letter showed that Parnell, while\r\npublicly disapproving of the Phoenix Park murders, privately defended them.\r\nAs a matter of fact, it had been forged by a man named Pigott, and the\r\nproprietor of the _Times_ had bought it with such credulity as showed that\r\nhe was completely reckless in his eagerness to injure Parnell. In November\r\nan action was brought against the _Times_ by another Nationalist, and the\r\nAttorney-General, who acted for the defendants, produced in court a number\r\nof other letters of the same kind. Parnell then took action. He had been\r\nadvised by English Liberals that the verdict of a London jury would be\r\ncast, from political motives, against him. He had known that a verdict on\r\nthe other side from a Dublin jury would get no credit out of Ireland. He\r\nhad therefore declined to issue a writ for libel. He now demanded an\r\ninquiry by a Select Committee of the House of Commons. The Tories, who\r\nbelieved the letter to be genuine, refused the Committee, but promised to\r\nestablish a Commission of three judges \"to inquire into the allegations and\r\ncharges made against Members of Parliament by the defendants in the recent\r\naction.\" This was accepted by Parnell instead of a Select Committee. But\r\nthe Government, without his consent, inserted the words \"and other persons\"\r\nafter the word \"Parliament,\" and thus turned a particular inquiry into the\r\nconduct of members into a roving investigation into Irish politics of the\r\nlast ten years. Members of Parliament, boycotters, defaulting tenants,\r\nmoonlighters, murderers, and maimers of cattle were all lumped together for\r\nexamination by a body which was incapable by its nature of giving weight to\r\nthe historical and economic condition of Ireland. Whether Parnell had\r\nexpressed approval of murder or not was a question of fact which could be\r\nsettled by a court of law better than by any one else. The rights and\r\nwrongs of England and Ireland could not be tried by {304} any tribunal upon\r\nearth, and Parnell's case was huddled up with the rest simply in the hope\r\nthat general prejudice against proved outrage might outweigh the effect of\r\nan acquittal on the particular charge. Nothing would be settled by proving\r\nthat the National League had promoted outrage. The case for the League was\r\nthat it was the only means of obtaining justice for the Irish peasant. No\r\njudge, however impartial, could try such an issue. The Bill establishing\r\nthe Commission was forced through the House, without the excuse of urgency,\r\nby the use of the closure. Parnell was thus compelled to accept a tribunal\r\nfor which he had not asked, in order that the Tory party might find\r\njudicial support for their case against Ireland. The facts revealed by the\r\ninquiry were of no particular value. The forger shot himself, and the\r\nletters were declared to be fabrications. The Irish members were acquitted\r\non the charge of encouraging crime, and condemned for not being more ready\r\nto disapprove it. This was nothing new. The demoralization of respectable\r\nIrishmen has been the worst result of English misgovernment of Ireland.\r\nWhen worthy means of obtaining redress are exhausted it requires almost a\r\nsupernatural virtue not to acquiesce in unworthy means. The moral and\r\npolitical defence of the Nationalists could not be heard by the Commission,\r\nand the judgment did not affect it. So far as the affair influenced\r\nindependent opinion at all, it influenced it against the Government. The\r\neagerness with which the Tories had assumed the truth of the Parnell\r\nletters, and the indecency with which they had confounded irrelevant issues\r\nin order to present an indictment against a whole people were as vivid\r\nillustrations as the Mitchelstown incident of Tory disregard of equity and\r\nfair dealing. From this moment the Liberal party began to recover strength,\r\nand the union between English Liberalism and Irish Nationalism became\r\nindissoluble. But for the O'Shea divorce case, which discredited Parnell\r\nand distracted the Nationalist party, the strength of the united forces\r\nmight have been sufficient to carry Home Rule in the next Parliament. In\r\nthe actual event, the Liberal victory at the election of 1892 was {305}\r\nlittle more than nominal, and in 1895 Toryism asserted itself more\r\nemphatically than before.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Toryism to govern Ireland in this spirit without the\r\ncontagion spreading to other quarters. Those who refused liberty to others\r\ncame near to losing their own, and those who claimed arbitrarily to dispose\r\nof the fortunes of the Irish people found it an easy task to assert their\r\negoism elsewhere. During the twenty years which followed the rejection of\r\nthe first Home Rule Bill, every principle which Liberalism had inherited\r\nfrom the Whigs, the Radicals, and the Manchester School was violated in\r\nturn. The powers of hereditary aristocracy were increased,[341] the status\r\nof woman was lowered, the Established Church was aggrandized, an attempt\r\nwas made to revive Protection, a sinister trade monopoly was allowed to\r\ndictate the policy of the State in its own interest, a system of labour was\r\nestablished under the British flag which was not distinguishable from some\r\nancient forms of slavery, the powers of Trade Unions were limited by\r\njudicial decisions, a foreign State was invaded because it mismanaged its\r\ninternal affairs, large tracts, including the territories of two\r\nself-governing races of white men, were annexed to the Empire by force,\r\nmorality was frankly struck out of the list of national virtues, and in its\r\nfavourite cant word \"efficiency\" Imperialism coined an exact equivalent for\r\nthe vertu of Macchiavelli. Even women suffered a loss of status. The\r\nagitation for Woman Suffrage dwindled away. By the Education Act of 1902,\r\nwhich abolished the old School Boards, they were deprived of one of their\r\nopportunities of being elected to a public body, and were given in exchange\r\nthe inferior dignity of co-option to a committee of men. In 1897 they\r\nreceived a worse blow, when the regulation of vice was re-established, in a\r\nmodified form, in India. These positive wrongs were accompanied by a\r\nserious neglect to improve the conditions of common life, and the\r\nconsequences of neglect were made worse by the {306} burden of debt and the\r\nincreased expenditure on armaments which the prevailing policy involved. At\r\nthe end of the Tory period, when the excitement of the Boer War left the\r\npeople once more free to contemplate their own condition, economic reforms\r\nwere overdue, and attempts to grapple with the modern industrial problems\r\njostled with attempts to undo the work of positive reaction, and to assert\r\nonce more the Liberal principles of the previous generation.\r\n\r\nIt is of course not suggested that the Liberal Government of 1906 had to\r\nbegin again from the beginning. The practical reaction was not, and could\r\nnot have been, so complete as the moral. But the tide rose high and some\r\nlandmarks were covered. The full term of reaction was not reached until the\r\nend of the century, and especially in the early years of Tory domination\r\nmore than one useful and Liberal measure was passed. Some of these were due\r\nto Liberal Unionist influence. Others were in the line of previous Tory\r\naction. Bradlaugh carried his Oaths Bill into law in 1888. In the same year\r\nthe Local Government Act abolished the old system of county administration,\r\nand substituted councils elected by the ratepayers for the justices of the\r\npeace who were appointed by the Lord Chancellor. In London a County Council\r\ntook the place of a Metropolitan Board of Works. This Act gave to all the\r\ninhabitants of counties and of London that control of their own government\r\nwhich had been enjoyed by the inhabitants of all other large towns since\r\nthe Whig Ministry of 1832. One blemish of importance was left in the Act, a\r\ncurious proof that this, like other Tory reforms in political machinery,\r\nwas due to a desire rather for efficient working than for the assertion of\r\nany principle of popular freedom. Two women were elected to the first\r\nLondon County Council, and a court of law decided that their election was\r\nvoid. No attempt was made to remove the disability, which remained until\r\nthe revival of Liberalism in the twentieth century. Liberal Unionism\r\nremained male. In Ireland more than one useful change was made. A private\r\nMembers' County Councils Bill was rejected in 1888. But in the same year a\r\n{307} Land Act advanced L5,000,000 to assist land purchase, and in 1891 a\r\nsecond Act provided for advances up to L30,000,000 for buying out the\r\nlandlords. Grants to relieve the distress caused by failure of the potato\r\ncrop were made in the usual spirit of Tory benevolence, and accompanied the\r\nmost relentless application of coercion. They prevented starvation, and\r\nthey did nothing to alter the popular enthusiasm for Home Rule. No amount\r\nof indulgence from an acknowledged superior will satisfy the man who wants\r\nonly freedom to look after himself. Ireland took what she could get, and\r\nasked for more. A last domestic reform was made in 1891, when education was\r\nmade free, as well as compulsory.\r\n\r\nThe Liberals came into office again in 1892. The most important result of\r\ntheir brief triumph was perhaps the illustration which it afforded of the\r\npower of the new party machinery in the country. The National Liberal\r\nFederation met at Newcastle, immediately before the election, and succeeded\r\nin imposing its will upon the Liberal party with questionable effect. It\r\nseemed to be animated by the logical temper of the early Radicals rather\r\nthan by the practical, managing temper which is so essential to political\r\naction. It advocated, among more orthodox things, the Disestablishment of\r\nthe Churches of Scotland and Wales, and a local veto on the sale of\r\nalcoholic liquors. Both these proposals carried Liberal principles to\r\nlogical and unreasonable extremes. Disestablishment in Wales was a right\r\napplication of the principle of religious equality. To invest with public\r\nprivileges the members of a sect which contained a minority of the\r\npopulation, and had been for more than a century alien in spirit as well as\r\nin the nationality of its official heads, was one of those artificial\r\nappreciations which are abhorrent to all Liberals. The Scottish case was\r\nentirely different. The Established Church Of Scotland differed only in\r\nunimportant details of constitution and government from the other Churches.\r\nNo social privileges were claimed or enjoyed by its members, and there was\r\nno national demand for the abolition of its formal privileges. An\r\naristocratic Church with a form of service alien to the natural disposition\r\nof the people was {308} an institution which the Welsh could reasonably\r\ndenounce. A Church which was as plain and sober in its habit as the\r\nhumblest chapel in the land was accepted by the Scotch because it never\r\nclaimed to be more than it was worth.\r\n\r\nLocal veto was as dangerous an application of logic as the Disestablishment\r\nof the Church of Scotland. It meant that the majority of the inhabitants of\r\na district could prevent any one of them from obtaining a particular form\r\nof refreshment. It was not a question of protecting weak men against\r\ntemptation by reducing the number of public-houses. Nor was it a question\r\nof the inhabitants preventing a public-house being placed in a district\r\nwhere none had been before. Either of these applications of a popular vote\r\nwould be legitimate. Every public-house above a certain number in\r\nproportion to the population is a public nuisance, and if a man has gone to\r\nreside in a neighbourhood where he cannot get a drink, it is quite\r\nreasonable to argue that he has no real need of the opportunity. But local\r\nveto means that the neighbours of an honest and sober citizen can impose on\r\nhim against his will total abstinence, a form of life of which he does not\r\napprove. Modern forms of interference with economic freedom can generally\r\nbe justified on the ground that while they diminish the apparent liberty of\r\na few they increase the real liberty of many. Local veto is an attempt\r\nrather to diminish the liberty of many in order to increase that of a few.\r\nIf the extreme view of it is accepted, that total abstinence must be\r\nenforced because it is better than even moderate indulgence, it is not\r\ndistinguishable from the crudest Toryism, which forces upon some\r\nindividuals what others believe to be in their best interest. Hard lines\r\ncan never be drawn in politics. But local veto appears to be one of those\r\ninterferences with private conduct which are intolerable, even if they are\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\nOne or two Government measures were passed into law. District and Parish\r\nCouncils were established by an Act of 1893 to do the less important work\r\nof rural government under the County Councils, and this Act was more\r\nLiberal than that of 1888 in that it permitted the election of women. The\r\nBudget {309} of 1894 greatly increased the death duties on landed property\r\nand at last put an end to the advantages which it enjoyed in comparison\r\nwith other forms of wealth. The same Budget emphasized and extended the\r\nprinciple of taxation according to ability to pay. Where money was required\r\nby the State for public purposes, it was reasonable that those who had\r\nlarge accumulations should pay at a higher rate than those who had small.\r\nEquality of rate was not equality of taxation. The estates of deceased\r\npersons were thus directly taxed upon a graduated scale, and the first step\r\nwas taken in the process of shifting fiscal burdens from the poorer to the\r\nricher classes, which is so marked a feature of modern Liberal policy. This\r\nreform, the House of Lords not having yet the boldness to interfere with\r\ntaxation, was carried without much difficulty. A more direct attempt to\r\nimprove economic conditions failed. The Employers' Liability Bill,\r\ncompensating workmen for injuries caused by the neglect of fellow-workmen\r\nunder the rank of foreman, was so amended by the Lords that it had to be\r\ndropped. The second Home Rule Bill passed the Commons, but was beaten in\r\nthe Lords by ten to one. Gladstone resigned in March, 1894, and his place\r\nwas taken by Lord Rosebery, a splendid orator, who could never lead the\r\npeople because he could never understand them. Welsh Disestablishment and\r\nLocal Veto Bills were introduced and dropped, because even the House of\r\nCommons would not pass them. The party collapsed in a few months, and the\r\nTories came back to office and to power. The tide had been but little\r\nchecked, and it now resumed its steady course away from Liberal ideals. The\r\nexamination of the current of events requires some preliminary\r\ninvestigation of prevailing modes of thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to understand the present methods of English political\r\nthinking without some consideration of the theory of evolution. Both habits\r\nof mind, the Liberal and the Tory, have been able to employ it for their\r\nown purposes, and its influence upon Socialism at one extreme and\r\nImperialism at the other {310} has been equally marked. Darwin's book, _The\r\nOrigin of Species_, was published in 1859, and produced instantly a turmoil\r\nin science and religion. Its bearing upon politics was less obvious, and\r\nthere are no traces of it in the speculations of such a philosophical\r\nLiberal as Mill. The man who did most to bring the theory to bear upon\r\nthings other than biology was Herbert Spencer, who was anything but a\r\npolitician. But the channels by which its influence was poured into the\r\ngeneral mind had become, by the end of the century, too numerous for\r\ndiscrimination, and the pulpit, the Press, the stage, the platform, and\r\npopular literature of every kind were full of references to the struggle\r\nfor existence and the survival of the fittest. For good and evil the idea\r\nof evolution had become part of the national stock.\r\n\r\nStated in plain terms, Darwin's theory was that the old conception of man,\r\nas having been specially created by God in a state of blessedness from\r\nwhich he fell by his own sin, was false, and that he had in fact been\r\ngradually developed out of an inferior state to his present degree of\r\nperfection. Humanity, like every other living thing, had been developed,\r\nwhether mechanically or by divine order was not important, by a constant\r\nstruggle with environment. Individuals, varying among themselves, were\r\nplaced under certain conditions of life, for which some were better suited\r\nthan others. Those who were fittest for the particular environment\r\nsurvived, and transmitted their particular variations to their offspring.\r\nWhen a sufficient number of generations had lived and died, these\r\nvariations or characters were permanently fixed in the stock, and a class\r\nor species had appeared on the earth, which was distinct from others, who\r\nin different environments had similarly developed different forms. This\r\ntheory was connected, not only with experiments and observations in the\r\nfield of biology, but with geological investigation and the system of\r\nhistorical examination of constitutions, systems of law, and social\r\nstructure, which was becoming increasingly common in Darwin's day. All\r\nunited to emphasize the idea of growth. The eighteenth century appeared to\r\nconceive of everything as stationary. The later {311} nineteenth century\r\nconceived of everything as in motion. The organisms which were healthy and\r\nvigorous were those which adapted themselves most successfully to their\r\nenvironment, fixed new characters in their stocks, and rose from a lower\r\ncondition to a higher.\r\n\r\nThe immediate application of this theory to politics is obvious. If true,\r\nit gives a scientific explanation and justification of change and\r\ndevelopment. It is impossible at the present day for any political thinkers\r\nto do what Sir Henry Maine did at the beginning of the Imperialist\r\nreaction, and speak of change as a phenomenon peculiar to Western Europe\r\nand of a stationary condition as the general rule.[342] Events of recent\r\nyears in Japan, China, India, Persia, Turkey, and Egypt have exposed the\r\nfalse basis of his reasoning. But even without this experience, a\r\npost-Darwinian politician would point to the changelessness of the East as\r\nin itself a sign of degeneracy, and the restlessness of the West as a proof\r\nof its superiority. Life is identified with change. Movement is normal,\r\nactivity the universal rule of health. The peoples who stagnate, decay; and\r\nthe one test of vitality is the capacity to receive and to apply new ideas.\r\nThe primeval mollusc indeed saved itself from injury by its protective\r\nshell, and its descendants are molluscs to this day. The organisms which,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, preferred mobility and risk to immobility and\r\nperfect safety, have evolved, through countless intervening steps, to man.\r\nThe modern outburst of reforming zeal is thus not spasmodic, but only an\r\nacceleration of an eternal process of development. The old Toryism is dead\r\nand damned. The maintenance of the old, without inquiry and without\r\nreadjustment, is the upsetting of the natural order. The prospect of change\r\nhas lost its terrors. What we fear to-day is not change, but permanence; or\r\nrather, we seek for permanence in a line of change.\r\n\r\nThe evolutionary philosophy has thus come directly to the aid of\r\nLiberalism, and some reformers, particularly a certain school of\r\nSocialists, apply it mechanically to the growth of {312} society, as from\r\nhome industry to factory industry, from factory industry to the Trust, and\r\nfrom the Trust to the national organization of production. But most\r\nadvocates of change are more cautious, and are content to find in it a\r\ndefence of the need or the harmlessness of change. On the other hand, it\r\nhas moderated the reforming temper. No Liberal of any capacity of mind can\r\nnow rush to the cutting and carving of society with the cheerful zeal of\r\nPaine or Bentham. There can be for him no cutting off and beginning afresh.\r\nThe historical caution which distinguishes Mill from Bentham must now be\r\nemphasized in his successors. Reform must be a process of training and\r\nadaptation, not of destruction and substitution. Logic must be applied with\r\ncircumspection, and if the statesman has now a more certain hope that the\r\npeople will ultimately achieve happiness, he is no less sure that they can\r\nnever be dragged into it by the hair of the head.\r\n\r\nWhile the idea of evolution has thus operated both to encourage and to\r\ndiscipline the Liberal temper, it has also operated to give license to the\r\nTory. The most brutal egoism is supported by pseudo-scientific applications\r\nof the theory of the survival of the fittest. Some thinkers find in the\r\nmere existence of a governing class a proof that its members were the\r\nfittest for their position. Capacity for government has been bred into our\r\naristocracy, as beef is bred into a bullock, or speed into a racehorse, and\r\nthe poor members of other classes represent the unfit stocks, who have\r\nfallen, by the operation of natural laws, into the position best suited to\r\nthem. Neglect of social reform is justified, in a similar way, on the\r\nground that the economic struggle eliminates unfit types, and that to make\r\nlife easier for the masses of the people is to preserve undesirable stocks\r\nin the race. It is useless, and even positively dangerous, to interfere\r\nbetween landlord and tenant, and master and workman, or to put an end to\r\nslums and sweating. These things should be left to themselves. In the\r\napparently dreadful conflict between individuals and their environment,\r\nbeneficent laws are at work. The fittest men will survive out of this as\r\nthe fittest {313} organisms survive in the animal kingdom. Good sense and\r\ncommon humanity have generally prevailed over these two applications of the\r\ntheory. But in foreign policy it has unquestionably dominated modern\r\nToryism. As among primitive invertebrates, so among civilized races of\r\nmankind, it is only in struggle that any one can be developed to its\r\nhighest capacity. International politics should therefore be a system of\r\nperpetual antagonism. It is only in war that we can develop those vigorous\r\nqualities which are essential to human as to animal progress. Humanity and\r\nconsideration for others are fatal to that success in the internecine\r\nstrife, which is necessary for the survival of the fittest among nations.\r\nThe consideration of evolutionary Toryism in domestic affairs is postponed\r\nto the next chapter. It is here necessary only to deal with its connection\r\nwith what is called Imperialism. At the end of the last century it\r\nunquestionably combined with the apparent success of Bismarck to revive and\r\naggravate egoism in foreign policy.\r\n\r\nThe first serious suggestion of Imperialism was made by Disraeli in 1872.\r\nSpeaking at the Crystal Palace, he said that \"self-government, when it was\r\nconceded, ought to have been conceded as part of a great policy of Imperial\r\nconsolidation. It ought to have been accompanied by an Imperial tariff ...\r\nand by a military code which should have precisely defined the means and\r\nthe responsibilities by which the Colonies should have been defended, and\r\nby which, if necessary, this country should call for aid from the Colonies\r\nthemselves. It ought further to have been accompanied by the institution of\r\nsome representative council in the metropolis which would have brought the\r\nColonies into constant and continuous relations with the Home\r\nGovernment.... In my judgment, no Minister in this country will do his duty\r\nwho neglects any opportunity of reconstructing as much as possible our\r\ncolonial Empire, and of responding to those distant sympathies which may\r\nbecome the source of incalculable strength and happiness to this land.\" He\r\nexhorted his hearers to choose between national and cosmopolitan\r\nprinciples, and to fight \"against Liberalism on the continental system.\"\r\nNothing was {314} done by his Ministry to carry out the plan of Imperial\r\nconsolidation, except the addition of the Imperial title to the dignity of\r\nthe Crown and the abortive attempt to federate South Africa. The fight\r\nagainst cosmopolitanism was not avoided, and the demonstrations against\r\nRussia in Turkey and Afghanistan showed the fatal ease with which large\r\nconceptions of national importance degenerate into vulgarity. The new idea\r\nof Empire was thus early identified with national insolence and immorality.\r\n\r\nThe federation of self-governing dominions has not been the most striking\r\nfeature of Imperialist policy since Disraeli. In the last thirty years of\r\nthe nineteenth century four and three-quarter millions of square miles of\r\nland and eighty-eight millions of human beings were added to the Empire,\r\nand of the latter only two millions were white people.[343] The primary\r\nobject of all these extensions was not the incorporation of free peoples in\r\na federal union, but the subjugation of weak peoples for the purposes of\r\nprivate profit. The British trader and the British capitalist who wanted\r\nsecurity for his foreign investments were the pioneers of Empire, and in\r\nSouth Africa they succeeded, not only in incorporating, by methods often\r\nworse than dubious, races of barbarians, but in dragging the whole British\r\npeople into a costly war for the annexation of two civilized Republics.\r\nImperialism has not of set purpose extended liberty in any part of the\r\nglobe. It has introduced order and justice into some unsettled tracks, it\r\nhas provided capital for the development of neglected natural resources,\r\nand in South Africa it showed how readily it would subordinate the moral to\r\nthe material interests of Empire. The only conspicuous extensions of\r\nliberty during the period of expansion have been made by Liberals, and in\r\nSouth Africa they acted in the face of almost unanimous protest from the\r\nImperialist party. The successes of Imperialism have been material.\r\n\r\nThe steady deterioration which has taken place in the ideals of Imperialism\r\nhas already been indicated. Its moral failure {315} is due simply to the\r\nfact that the object of expansion was never in any case moral.\r\nIncidentally, as in India, Egypt, and Nigeria, an enlightened bureaucracy\r\nhas avoided the blunders of exploitation and oppression. But for the most\r\npart, the best that can be said of our rule is that it is disinterested.\r\nLittle has been done, even in India, to train and develop the higher\r\nfaculties of the natives, and it is only in the Liberal reforms of Lord\r\nMorley that definite steps towards self-government have been taken. We are\r\nin these countries frankly to maintain order and to produce wealth, and for\r\nthe most part we attempt nothing else. Benefits to the natives are only\r\nincidental and not primary. Unquestionably the growth of the Empire has\r\nextended the advantages of civilization to backward and uncultivated\r\ndistricts. But it has been promoted by the zeal of the investor rather than\r\nof the missionary. The enormous growth of wealth required new fields for\r\ninvestment. Visions of national grandeur were employed to direct the common\r\npeople from the social reforms which would have reduced this wealth. The\r\nPress, the pulpit, and the platform united to represent the material\r\npursuit of gain as a disinterested labour on behalf of humanity. A mist of\r\nmoral enthusiasm was wrapped about the crude realities of commercial\r\nenterprise, and the acquisition of wealth by private persons was disguised\r\nin the trappings of national magnificence. Much honest enthusiasm was thus\r\ngenerated which commercial and financial magnates turned to their\r\nadvantage. But in the face of temptation the artificial structure\r\ncollapsed. National egoism and cupidity have now converted the organization\r\nfor the distribution of blessings into an organization for the monopolizing\r\nof profits. The Empire is to-day regarded by Imperialists as essentially\r\nnational, and not as essentially international. It is to be surrounded by a\r\ntariff for the exclusion of the foreign trader, and it is to be organized\r\nas a gigantic weapon against those nations with which, for the time being,\r\nwe happen to be at variance.\r\n\r\nThis conception of Empire has grown with those false applications of\r\nevolutionary theory to which reference has been previously {316} made. The\r\nobjects of the organization of the State having ceased to be moral, it has\r\nceased to be moral in its methods of working. International morality is\r\nflung away with the other rules of conduct, and material success becomes\r\nthe sole justification of public action. \"As a nation we are brought up to\r\nfeel it a disgrace to succeed by falsehood; the word 'spy' conveys in it\r\nsomething as repulsive as slave. We will keep hammering away with the\r\nconviction that honesty is the best policy, and that truth always wins in\r\nthe long run. These pretty little sentences do well enough for a child's\r\npocket-book, but the man who acts upon them in war had better sheathe his\r\nsword for ever.\"[344] Out of success, by whatever methods it may be\r\nachieved, this school proposes to acquire the desirable human qualities. By\r\nwarfare, and warfare only, whether it be military or diplomatic, is it\r\npossible for a people to develop and to retain strength, courage, and\r\nresource. Those nations which survive in this perpetual conflict are\r\npresumed, in the Darwinian phrase, to be the \"fittest.\" Survival justifies\r\nitself. Success is the test of virtue, and the steps by which it is\r\nobtained may be safely ignored. The gross fallacies of this process of\r\nargument have been sufficiently dealt with by other hands.[345] It is only\r\nnecessary here to suggest the Liberal answer. A State is not an individual.\r\nIt is simply an expression of the ideas of a human society, or aggregation\r\nof human beings. The morals of a State are nothing but the morals of its\r\nindividual members. To say that morality must be observed by those members\r\nin their dealings with each other, but not in their collective dealings\r\nwith the members of other States, is to weaken private and not public\r\nmorality. Public morality is not distinguishable from private. The man who\r\nabstains from stealing his neighbour's goods cannot, without personal\r\ndeterioration, join his neighbours in appropriating the territory of\r\nanother {317} nation. Morality has gradually spread from organizations\r\nwithin the State till it includes all persons within the State. In the\r\nremote past, morality was observed only in dealings between members of the\r\nsame family. Strangers took their chance. At a later date it was extended\r\nto the tribe, or the village, or the Church, and finally to all subjects of\r\nthe same central government. There is no reason for stopping the operation\r\nof moral rules at the Straits of Dover, that would not prevent an\r\nEnglishman from dealing honourably with a Scotchman, or a Churchman from\r\ndealing honourably with a Dissenter. Morality must be universal, or it\r\nceases to be morality. The argument thus outlined must be fatal to\r\nevolutionary Imperialism. Qualities cannot be developed in nations. They\r\ncan only be developed in the individuals who compose those nations. To\r\nspeak of a strong and virile State is to obscure the issue. Strong and\r\nvirile States can only be those which are maintained by strong and virile\r\nhuman beings. States which \"survive\" by the exercise of force and fraud can\r\nonly be those whose subjects have ceased to dislike force and fraud. In\r\nother words, the evolution of the individual and the evolution of the State\r\ncannot proceed upon different lines. Man has now reached a point of\r\ndevelopment where mere brute strength has ceased to be a desirable quality.\r\nThe test of a man is always a moral test. We have evolved morality. If we\r\nformally reject morality in our use of the State, for the express purpose,\r\nas it were, of \"breeding it out,\" we deliberately turn back the course of\r\nhuman evolution. The State will react upon the individual, and the\r\nindividual will suffer. We cannot select certain qualities for individuals,\r\nand certain others for States, and suppose that evolution can be directed\r\ntowards the development of both together.\r\n\r\nBritish Imperialism, thus strengthening its natural tendency to egoism by\r\nthe assimilation of scientific theory, has been only a local manifestation\r\nof an almost universal tendency. The career of Bismarck in Germany formed\r\nan excellent example of the operation of the same principles. Germany\r\nconsolidated, France and Austria humiliated, and territory snatched from\r\nFrance and {318} Denmark have invested the gospel of \"State might is State\r\nright\" with a lustre which conceals the deterioration of private morals,\r\nthe distresses of the common people, and the profound social unrest, which\r\nthis costly parade has brought in its train. Men and women as individuals\r\nmay sometimes escape the Nemesis which waits on immorality. Nations can\r\nnever die, and the debt incurred by one generation must always be paid by\r\nits successor. Only a short view of German history can fail to see the\r\ndangers which the policy of Bismarck has brought upon his country. The\r\nreaction of Russian policy upon the internal state of Russia is more\r\nobvious, and the case of Great Britain is hardly less clear. But for the\r\nmoment, Imperialism is the fashion at home and abroad. The earth is\r\nparcelled out among the Powers. England, Germany, and France share Africa\r\nbetween them. Austria covets and by instalments obtains territory in the\r\nBalkans. Russia is thrust out of Manchuria, and compensates herself in\r\nMongolia and Persia. All join in wresting concessions of territory and\r\nfinancial opportunities from China, and even the United States takes her\r\ncolonies from Spain. In all parts of the earth the Powers are thus brought\r\ninto new competition. The Balance of Power is revived, but for investors\r\nand not for dynasties. The struggle is for opportunities for the private\r\nacquisition of wealth, rather than opportunities for the public control of\r\nterritory. But the result is the same. Obligations are indefinitely\r\nextended. The risks of conflict are indefinitely increased. The burden of\r\narmaments grows larger every year. The common people are more and more\r\nremoved from the decision of the most far-reaching public questions, and\r\nknow little more of the things which may decide their fate than is forced\r\nupon them by the weight of their taxes and the advice which they receive\r\nfrom their governors for the direction of their national antipathies.\r\n\r\nBritish Imperialism came to a head in the South African War. Since the\r\ntroubles of 1880 the condition of the Transvaal had greatly changed. The\r\ndiscovery of gold had caused an enormous flow of immigrants, mostly of\r\nBritish descent. The {319} government remained in the hands of more\r\nprimitive men, who resented the intrusion of this foreign and industrial\r\npopulation. Paul Kruger, the last President, was a stubborn member of the\r\nold school, and while he possessed the confidence of his own countrymen, he\r\nwas incapable of appreciating the necessity for new ideas and new\r\ninstitutions which the new economic conditions had produced. The older men,\r\nwho had not forgotten how they had wrested their independence out of the\r\nunwilling hands of England, were being steadily overtaken by men of wider\r\nviews, who saw clearly enough that independence could not be maintained for\r\never on the basis of racial distinctions. Government could not be kept for\r\never in the hands of Dutch agriculturists, when the most vigorous, the best\r\neducated, and almost the most numerous section of the community were\r\nBritish industrialists. The existing system was the system which produced\r\nour Irish problem. But in the Transvaal the problem was neither so old nor\r\nso acute as in Ireland, and there was no question that time would have\r\nremedied all the grievances of the Outlanders. The conflict of the two\r\nraces would have died a natural death, and would have ended in the\r\nTransvaal, as it had ended long before in Cape Colony, in amicable\r\nadjustment. The disease would have run its course. But the folly of British\r\nImperialism preferred a surgical operation. The Outlanders who agitated for\r\nreforms of the franchise, of taxation, and of the judicial system, were\r\nused for purposes other than their own. A group of South African\r\npoliticians, headed by Cecil Rhodes, a genuine, if unscrupulous\r\nImperialist, and including several financial magnates, whose interest in\r\nthe Empire was pecuniary rather than hereditary, determined to use the\r\nlegitimate grievances of the Outlanders as weapons for the destruction of\r\nthe Transvaal Republic. Rhodes was determined, at all costs, to unite South\r\nAfrica under the British flag. His less enthusiastic associates wanted to\r\ncontrol the Transvaal Government in their own interest, and they knew that\r\nthey could not control it unless it was made British. Therefore they took\r\nsteps to provoke a war which should end in the annexation of the Republic.\r\n{320}\r\n\r\nCase for armed interference by Great Britain there was none. The Convention\r\nof 1884, which reserved to her some rights in connection with foreign\r\naffairs, was intended to leave the Transvaal independent in domestic\r\nmatters. Undoubtedly she might have interfered on behalf of her own\r\nsubjects, if they had suffered gross oppression. But they had not. They had\r\nentered the country in pursuit of gain, and many of them had acquired\r\nenormous wealth. They were denied the franchise, which they ought to have\r\npossessed. But disfranchisement had not exposed them to peculiar hardships,\r\nand the current of opinion among the Dutch was setting steadily in their\r\nfavour. Taxation, though heavy, was not ruinous. Justice, though generally\r\nslovenly and sometimes corrupt, was no worse than in many parts of the\r\nUnited States. The general condition of the Outlanders was infinitely\r\nsuperior to that of the vast majority of the English people before 1832,\r\nand no grievance was so intolerable as to make it impossible to wait until\r\nthe old governing class of Dutch was replaced by the new. There was ample\r\nreason for political pressure from within. There was ample reason for\r\ndiplomatic representations from without. There was no reason for armed\r\nforce either within or without.[346]\r\n\r\nHaving no case for war on the merits, the Imperial and financial\r\npoliticians proceeded to manufacture one for themselves. A systematic\r\ncampaign of calumny against the Transvaal Government was begun in the\r\nAfrican and British newspapers, every abuse was exaggerated, and every\r\nincident misinterpreted. The climax was reached at the end of 1895, when,\r\nwith the connivance of Rhodes, Dr. Jameson led a small party of invaders\r\ninto the Transvaal. This expedition, as wicked a violation of State rights\r\nas has ever been made, was designed expressly to provoke rebellion and\r\nintervention. It was invested with all the splendour of a war for liberty,\r\nand a forged invitation had been {321} prepared some weeks before, to be\r\ndischarged at the critical moment, which represented that the honour of\r\nEnglish women in Johannesburg was in danger from the Dutch. The Raid met\r\nwith the fate which its vicious inspiration and the foul lie which\r\naccompanied it deserved. The final effect of it was to destroy all the\r\nmoral authority of the British Government, and to convince even the Dutch\r\nReformers that they could only maintain their independence by force of\r\narms. When Mr. Chamberlain publicly declared that Rhodes had done nothing\r\ninconsistent with honour, and, in the course of further negotiations about\r\nthe franchise, revived the obnoxious term \"suzerainty,\" all chance of peace\r\nhad gone. The Dutch were consolidated against the English as the French had\r\nbeen consolidated in 1793, reform was denounced as inconsistent with\r\npatriotism, and diplomatic language was received with suspicion as\r\nproceeding from a hopelessly corrupt and tainted source. War began in 1899,\r\nand ended, after a display of energy and resource by the enemy which none\r\nof our responsible statesmen had expected, in the annexation of both the\r\nRepublics.\r\n\r\nThe events of the war are of little importance for this book. A Liberal,\r\nwho witnessed this display of national egoism, with its boastful\r\nbeginnings, its slovenly neglect of preparations for its own work, the\r\nbestial ferocity of language with which it assailed its enemy, and its\r\nhysterical exultation at its final triumph, can find no pleasure in the\r\nrecollection of it. Posterity will pass its final judgment in its own time,\r\nand if it sees virtue in the conduct of our soldiers in the field and in\r\nthe colonial zeal for the common interest of the Empire, it will doubtless\r\nsee more in the stubbornness of the Dutch and in the devotion with which\r\nthe people of the Orange Free State sacrificed life, property, and\r\nindependence in a cause which was not their own. The actual event was\r\nprobably more beneficial to us than either the thorough defeat which our\r\nvanity deserved, or the easy and overwhelming triumph which it anticipated,\r\nwould have been. The one might have broken up the Empire. The other might\r\nhave led us into further exploits of the same kind, which could only have\r\nended in {322} our final overthrow. The chastisement was serious enough to\r\nreform without destroying. The violent emotions produced by the war, and\r\nthe distress consequent on its waste of life and treasure, roused the\r\ncommon people, whose attention had been diverted by conceptions of Imperial\r\nmagnificence to other parts of the world, once more to the contemplation of\r\ntheir own affairs. Even before the end of the fighting the reaction had\r\nbegun, and when the Imperialists were driven out of office in 1905, it was\r\nthe despised and discredited Pro-Boer, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who\r\nwas at the head of their successors.\r\n\r\nBefore this change of Government, Toryism had completed its course of\r\nreaction. Its government of Ireland had finally broken down. The system of\r\nLocal Government by County Councils, rejected in 1888, was established in\r\n1898, and in 1904 British credit was pledged to secure the extinction of\r\nlandlordism by purchase. But if Tory government of Ireland had become\r\nlittle more than the tardy application of Liberal principles, its\r\ngovernment of England remained its own. In 1902 fresh vigour was given by\r\nthe Education Act to the Established Church and its itch for instructing\r\nthe children of Dissenters in its own dogmas. In 1904 the drink trade\r\nprocured a Licensing Act, which gave it a new legal property in its\r\nopportunities for demoralizing the people, by making it impossible to\r\nabolish superfluous public-houses except on payment of compensation out of\r\na limited fund. In 1903 Imperialism came to its natural end, by proposing\r\nto revive the old system of Protection, with a preference to the Colonies\r\nas against foreign countries. This was partly a Tory way of dealing with\r\neconomic distress, and it has unquestionably appealed to honest as well as\r\nto corrupt sentiment. But its essential principles are national jealousy\r\nagainst foreign peoples, and the abuse of the common people by the\r\nplutocracy. To both these Liberalism found itself in 1903 in direct\r\nopposition. Tariff Reform involved a rise in the cost of living which would\r\npress most hardly on the poor, it involved the control of tariffs by vested\r\ninterests of landlords and manufacturers, and, less certainly, of Trade\r\nUnionists. There was nothing in it which {323} distinguished it in essence\r\nfrom the old Protection, and Liberalism was, in this line of attack,\r\nreinforced by the Conservatism which had grown around Free Trade. A last\r\nprovocation to the working classes had been given by judicial decisions,\r\nwhich construed the legislation of thirty years before to deprive the Trade\r\nUnions of their powers of peaceful picketing, and exposed their accumulated\r\nfunds to actions for damages for wrongs done by their agents during trade\r\ndisputes. Trade Union activity was thus stimulated. The new Labour Party\r\ncame into existence, and joined with the opponents of Tory Imperialism, the\r\nNonconformists alienated by the Education Act, the people of all classes\r\nwho had been offended by the Licensing Act, the Conservative Free Traders,\r\nand those who were anxious to resume the work of economic reconstruction,\r\nto overwhelm the Tory Party at the General Election.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{324}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nLIBERALISM SINCE 1906\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Liberal Government which came into power in 1906 was the\r\npolicy of those who had followed the old course during the Imperialist\r\nreaction. The general principles laid down by the new Prime Minister did\r\nnot differ substantially from those of Gladstone, though the problems with\r\nwhich he had to deal were not precisely the same. His argument against\r\nTariff Reform was inspired by the same zeal for personal freedom as those\r\nwhich he used against Chinese Labour, the Education Act, and aggression in\r\nSouth Africa. It was a conflict between habits of mind, and not a\r\ndifference of opinion. Protection placed the common people at the mercy of\r\ncapitalists and landlords, and increased the political power of plutocracy.\r\nChinese labour established an industrial system, which had for its primary\r\nobject, not the well-being of all its members, but the increase of the\r\nprofits of capital. The Education Act subjected large numbers of\r\nNonconformists to the domination of the Established Church in the\r\ninstruction of their children. The Boer War was a brutal interference with\r\nthe national concerns of a foreign race. The Liberal attack on the\r\nImperialist position was thus general and not particular. Liberals in this\r\nmatter were not fighting a single proposal, but a whole spirit and tone of\r\npolicy and administration and legislation. \"These fiscal proposals were\r\nsaturated, as the whole of the present Government had been found to be,\r\nwith restriction against freedom, with inequality between trade and trade\r\nwith injustice towards the community of consumers, with {325} privilege and\r\nmonopoly, with jealousy and unfriendliness towards other nations. They were\r\nessentially part of a retrograde and anti-democratic system.\"[347] It was\r\nthis clear sight of the real issues of the moment which extinguished Lord\r\nRosebery, and brought back the Liberals who had supposed they could at once\r\nsupport the Boer War and retain Liberal habits of mind in domestic affairs.\r\nThe great social currents which had run strong until Home Rule produced a\r\ntemporary diversion had once more gathered head, and those who suggested\r\nthat the Liberal party could take a clean slate, and ignore the writings of\r\nits predecessors, were sharply reminded by the result of the election that\r\nit was their duty to take up the tale where it had been interrupted twenty\r\nyears before. When the flood of war had subsided, the social stream was\r\nfound running in the channel which it had followed since the French\r\nRevolution. The bad memories of Ireland were not effaced. The problems of\r\nindustry were more urgent than ever. The pent-up hopes of women broke free.\r\nNonconformity once more demanded relief from sectarian domination. Only\r\nthose could deal with the new situation who had not tried to forget how\r\nthey had been accustomed to deal with the old. Lord Rosebery, punting about\r\nfor a new course, grounded on the shallows, and was left behind.\r\nCampbell-Bannerman, holding on the old course through the storm, found\r\nhimself afloat, and set for a prosperous journey.\r\n\r\nMuch of the Liberal work done since 1905 has consisted in the undoing of\r\nthe work of reactionary Toryism. For the first time since the close of the\r\nFrench War, Liberalism has found itself engaged in maintaining\r\nestablishments, and in leading the people to reoccupy positions which they\r\nhave evacuated. Free Trade is a purely negative policy, and means nothing\r\nbut keeping the ground clear for economic reconstruction. The unsuccessful\r\nattempts at Education and Licensing Reform would at best have done no more\r\nthan restore the social values which had been established in the previous\r\ncentury. The extension of {326} self-government to the Transvaal and the\r\nOrange River Colony undid, so far as it could be undone, the war, and\r\nrestored freedom.[348] The abolition of Chinese Labour was a complete\r\nreversal of a policy only a few years old. The Trade Disputes Act of 1906\r\nput Trade Unions in the legal position which they had occupied without\r\nquestion for twenty years after 1874.[349] All this work of restoration\r\nhampered the Government in its positive work, and when it ought to have\r\nbeen free to deal with the peculiar problems of its own day, it was forced\r\nto wait while it resettled those of a previous generation. The most\r\noriginal work of the new Liberalism has been economic. What most\r\ndistinguishes the Governments which have held office since 1906 is the\r\ndegree to which they have interfered with the economic structure of society\r\nin order to give greater freedom to the poorer classes. This work was begun\r\nunder Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and since Mr. Lloyd George has relieved\r\nMr. Asquith of the duty of inspiring his followers with new ideas, has been\r\ncontrolled and directed by the present Chancellor of the Exchequer. The\r\nBudget of 1909, the Old Age Pensions Act, the Workmen's Compensation Act,\r\nthe Wages Boards Act, the Labour Exchanges Act, the Education (Provision of\r\nMeals) Act, and the Insurance Act have all one feature in common, the use\r\nof State machinery for the active assistance of the economically weak. The\r\nprinciple of the Factory Acts has been extended into projects for Social\r\nReform, the number and variety of which may be almost indefinitely\r\nincreased. Burke's test of convenience is applied even to the {327} right\r\nof property. \"Private property is no longer regarded as one of the natural\r\nrights of man; its incidents are considered and settled by the common\r\nmodern criterion of all these matters--to wit, the balance of social\r\nadvantage.\"[350]\r\n\r\nThis growth of the importance attached to economic problems has appeared\r\nsudden only to those who have been at once deaf to the warnings of history\r\nand without experience of personal hardship. The dangers once expected from\r\nextensions of the franchise had receded from the view of a plutocracy and a\r\nmiddle class, which had contemplated for twenty years a common people\r\ndazzled by visions of national greatness.[351] The clamour with which these\r\ndisposing classes greeted the new democracy in 1906 expressed the natural\r\ndismay of those who had thought that they could always manage the people as\r\nthey pleased, and now realized, in the presence of forty working men\r\nelected to the House of Commons, that the people were going to manage\r\nthemselves. Gladstone's concentration upon Ireland had delayed this advent.\r\nBut for his adoption of Home Rule, the new policy, already suggested by Mr.\r\nChamberlain, would have been incorporated in practical Liberalism at least\r\nfifteen years earlier. It was not made less ominous by the postponement.\r\nEconomic discontent was both more bitter and more articulate in 1906 than\r\nit would have been in 1891. The Trade Unions had been roused by hostile\r\njudicial decisions. The political organizations of workmen were perfected,\r\nand the Trade Unions and the Independent Labour Party worked in harmony.\r\nThe workmen formed a distinct party of their own, and several of their\r\n{328} representatives were of definitely Socialist opinions. Outside the\r\nworking classes the public mind had been directed more and more to the\r\nstudy of industrial problems. The Fabian Society had been active for twenty\r\nyears, and Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb were only the most industrious of the\r\nmany investigators who were establishing a historical and scientific case\r\nfor reform. All this improvement of machinery marched with an increase in\r\nactual distress. The war added not only to the temporary, but also to the\r\npermanent burdens of the poor, and not merely by accumulating debt, but by\r\nincreasing the expenditure on armaments which an immoral policy required\r\nfor its defence. The dislocation of industry, which always follows a war,\r\nhad brought insecurity to many and destitution to not a few. Casual labour\r\nwas more general, and sweating not less than at any previous period. In\r\nevery direction distress and discontent had increased, and the political\r\nmachinery was now adapted to the direct and articulate expression of the\r\nfeelings of the common people. The Parliament of 1906 represented the\r\ndesire of the masses to fit their conditions of life to their own capacity\r\nfor growth.\r\n\r\nLiberals were bound to apply themselves to the new conditions in a new way,\r\nand it savours of pedantry to accuse Liberal economists of 1906 of having\r\ndeparted from the principles of Liberal economists of 1846. Paradoxical as\r\nit may appear to say that a positive policy of constant interference is the\r\nsame as a negative policy of constant abstention, it is true that the\r\nmental habit at the back of the one is identical with that at the back of\r\nthe other. Both aim at emancipating the individual from the things which\r\nprevent him from developing his natural capacities. The Manchester School\r\nsaw only the fetters which directly impeded him. The modern Liberal sees\r\nalso the want of the positive aids without which he is only half free. \"Of\r\nall the obstacles which obstruct men's advance towards good living, and of\r\nall the evils with which politics can help to deal, there is no obstacle\r\nmore formidable and no evil more grave than poverty.... Our first principle\r\nleads clearly and directly to a policy of social {329} reform. Whoever\r\nadmits that the duty of the State is to secure, so far as it is able, the\r\nfullest opportunities to lead the best life, cannot refuse to accept the\r\nfurther proposition, that to lessen the causes of poverty and to lighten\r\nits effects are essential parts of a right policy of State action.\"[352]\r\nPoverty cripples the individual in many ways. It deprives him of mobility,\r\nso that he cannot travel freely in search of employment. It prevents him\r\nfrom accumulating reserves for times of emergency, so that a depression in\r\ntrade or an illness of a month's duration may drive an honest and\r\nindustrious man with his wife and family to the workhouse, and make it\r\nimpossible for him ever again to resume his place in the ranks of\r\nindependent labour. It disables him from saving enough to keep himself in\r\nhis old age, and thus makes him either an additional burden on his children\r\nor a charge upon the ratepayers. If bad enough, it permanently reduces his\r\nbodily, mental, and moral efficiency, stunts his faculties, prevents the\r\nfull development of his children, and creates disease, vice, and crime in\r\nhimself and his descendants. The diseases, the temporary losses of\r\nemployment, and the fluctuations in income which, to a man of substantial\r\nmeans, may never be, and cannot immediately be disastrous, often involve in\r\nthe case of the ordinary wage-earner, the complete destruction of\r\neverything which makes life worth living. No one who seriously believes\r\nthat it is the duty of society to secure freedom of growth to every one of\r\nits members can doubt that it is its duty to mitigate, so far as it is\r\nable, those consequences of poverty which no degree of thrift, enterprise,\r\nor fortitude can avert.\r\n\r\nTo this end the economic reforms of the new Liberalism have been directed.\r\nThe Labour Exchanges Act did not furnish work for all. It provided\r\nfacilities for obtaining work for all who sought for it. The workman is no\r\nlonger left to scramble about for fresh employment. He goes to a public\r\noffice, where he learns what posts are vacant, and is put in touch with\r\nthose who may be willing to employ him. No man can now complain that\r\nbecause he cannot afford to travel in search of work, or to delay {330} for\r\nmore than a day or two before he finds it, he has suffered a permanent\r\ndeterioration in health or character. If this Act can eliminate the evils\r\nof casual and irregular labour, it will have enormously increased\r\nindividual liberty for growth.[353] The Old Age Pensions Act removed from\r\nthe shoulders of working-class families what was to many an intolerable\r\nburden. Before the Act came into force some thousands of men and women,\r\nfrom no cause but the lapse of time, became incapable of supporting\r\nthemselves. The alternatives were the workhouse and the generosity of their\r\nchildren. The first meant a loss of independence for themselves, the second\r\na fetter upon the freedom of their relations. In the absence of sickness\r\nrequiring hospital treatment, the pension of five shillings a week is\r\ngenerally sufficient to maintain the dignity of the pensioner and the\r\nefficiency of the children. The Workmen's Compensation Act, extending Mr.\r\nChamberlain's Acts of 1896 and 1900, insures the working people against\r\naccident as the Old Age Pensions Act insures them against age, and the\r\nInsurance Act against sickness and unemployment due to causes beyond their\r\ncontrol. So the Act providing for the feeding of necessitous children in\r\npublic schools aims at preventing the permanent deterioration of body and\r\ncharacter which is produced by inadequate nourishment in the early years of\r\nlife. So the Wage Boards Act and the Miners' Minimum Wage Act established\r\nmachinery for fixing a wage in certain employments which, having regard to\r\nthe circumstances of each trade, would insure that the wage-earner should\r\nenjoy a reasonable standard of health and comfort. All these measures are\r\nbased upon the same principle, that absolute liberty of the individual\r\nmeant the degradation, if not the destruction, of many individuals who were\r\npoor. There can be no equal chance of growth so long as accidents which\r\ncannot be averted, by any effort of the individual, may permanently impair\r\nhis natural capacity. Social reform is {331} justified as a national army\r\nis justified. It is a system of common organization for the purpose of\r\ncommon protection. What Mr. Churchill said of insurance may be said of all\r\nthese economic projects: \"I think it is our duty to use the strength and\r\nthe resources of the State to arrest the ghastly waste, not merely of human\r\nhappiness, but of national health and strength, which follows when a\r\nworking man's home, which has taken him years to get together, is broken up\r\nand scattered through a long spell of unemployment, or when, through the\r\ndeath, the sickness, or the invalidity of the bread-winner, the frail boat\r\nin which the fortunes of the family are embarked founders, and the women\r\nand children are left to struggle helplessly on the dark waters of a\r\nfriendless world.\"[354] The conception of society is no longer that of an\r\nextended procession, the strongest pushing on to the full limit of their\r\npowers, while the country to the rear is strewn with the sick and injured.\r\nIt is that of a compact army, every man of which has to be brought in, with\r\na sufficient organization of waggons and ambulances to pick up all the\r\nstragglers.\r\n\r\nThis elaboration of the system of protection is not inconsistent with such\r\ncompetition as is necessary for the development of character, and for the\r\nproduction of the wealth which is so distributed among the members of\r\nsociety. It is not Socialism. It is not a system of doles. It removes only\r\nsome of the risks of failure, and only those which are beyond individual\r\ncontrol. No man is made less thrifty because at the age of seventy he will\r\nreceive five shillings a week. No man works the better for knowing that if\r\nhe is ever ill for a month he and his family will never be free again, or\r\nwill work the worse for knowing that his home will be kept together until\r\nhe is able once more to support it by his own exertions. No woman gets any\r\nvirtue out of working fifteen hours a day for seven days a week, with the\r\nknowledge that even then she will not earn enough to keep herself in food\r\nand clothing without recourse to charity or prostitution, and her character\r\nwill not be deteriorated when a {332} level is fixed below which her wages\r\ncannot fall. The benefit of competition remains. The disasters inevitably\r\nattendant on it are averted. The poorer people no longer wrestle on the\r\nbrink of an unfenced precipice. \"I do not want to see impaired the vigour\r\nof competition, but we can do much to mitigate the consequences of failure.\r\nWe want to draw a line below which we will not allow persons to live and\r\nlabour, yet above which they may compete with all the strength of their\r\nmanhood. We want to have free competition upwards; we decline to allow free\r\ncompetition to run downwards. We do not want to pull down the structures of\r\nscience and civilization, but to spread a net over the abyss.\"[355] \"It is\r\nclear that the unlimited and uncontrolled struggle of wages spells anarchy\r\nalmost as painful in its effects as the unlimited and uncontrolled\r\ncompetition of physical force in our streets and highways. What is to be\r\nthe remedy? What, using the expression in its broadest sense, appears to be\r\nthe solution--whether through Parliament, local boards, or an independent\r\nCommission--to which we are heading? A Plimsoll line for labour as well as\r\nfor ships; a line above which the ship is not to sink with its burden when\r\nit puts out to sea; a line to limit with human lives on land as with those\r\n'who go down to the sea in great ships,' the extent of peril and suffering\r\nto which the worker is to be liable. Not to abolish competition any more\r\nthan competition has been abolished in ships. Competition will always be\r\npowerful enough. But to limit the strife--to fix a ring round the\r\nprize-fight--to protect the vital parts from the blows of the\r\ncombatants.\"[356] These statements reconcile the old individualism with the\r\nnew. Individual growth can only take place in competition. But it is not\r\nnecessary that failure in competition should be mortal. The struggle of\r\ncompetition is to go on. But it is not to go on to the death. Economic\r\nsociety is to be converted into a gigantic Trade Union,[357] based upon the\r\n{333} belief that the highest good of the individual can only be secured in\r\nco-operation with his fellows, and limiting his freedom only in so far as\r\nit is necessary to secure freedom to his associates.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that this new economic Liberalism has borrowed largely from\r\nSocialism, and it has one character in common with Protection. Once we\r\nadmit that it is right for the State to interfere with economic freedom, we\r\nhave advanced one step on the road which leads towards the nationalization\r\nof industry and towards the regulation of production by tariffs. The\r\ndifference between Social Reform and Tariff Reform is nevertheless clear.\r\nSocial Reform operates directly, only where it is needed, and without\r\nsubstantially interfering with any individual's enjoyment of life. Tariff\r\nReform, if it can destroy poverty at all, can only destroy it indirectly by\r\ngiving higher profits to the employer, who may or may not share his\r\nincreased gains with his workpeople. Its operation is also entirely\r\ncapricious, it can only apply to industries which suffer from foreign\r\ncompetition, and cannot touch those many underpaid forms of employment in\r\nwhich such competition cannot or does not in fact exist. Finally, as it can\r\nonly operate by raising prices, it can only give benefits to one class of\r\nlabour by imposing burdens upon another. It has only one certainty, the\r\nincrease of prices, with the consequent increase of profits and rents. The\r\nbenefits to be obtained from it by the poor are vague, must be confined to\r\none section only, and cannot be got by that except at the cost of those\r\nwhich are differently situated.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance between Social Reform and Socialism is much more real. The\r\nsympathies and the objects of the two are not dissimilar, though their\r\npractical proposals are essentially different. Socialism, so far as it is\r\never expressed in definite terms, makes a logical application of a general\r\nformula. Private ownership of the means of production, distribution, and\r\nexchange means a combination of the owners of capital against the\r\nwage-earners to the injury of the class which is economically the weaker of\r\nthe two. Therefore society as a whole must take possession of industrial\r\ncapital, production for use must be substituted for {334} production for\r\nprofit, work at a good wage must be guaranteed to every one who asks for\r\nit, and the fair distribution of wealth among the workers must be regarded\r\nas of more primary importance than the quantity which is produced.\r\nSocialists differ widely about methods and the rapidity with which the\r\neconomic change is to be effected. Generally, the modern Socialist of the\r\nFabian type prefers a gradual evolution to the cruder appropriations of\r\nearly thinkers, he is prepared to exempt certain industries from his\r\nscheme, and the equal distribution of rewards has gone the way of the class\r\nwar and community of goods. But all agree that, sooner or later, society,\r\nas politically organized in the form of the State, shall produce and\r\ndistribute or control the production and distribution of wealth according\r\nto ethical principles. The Liberal is less universal in his proposals. He\r\ndoes not object to the municipalization, or even nationalization, of\r\nmechanical monopolies, of industries which in fact do not admit of\r\ncompetition. Such industries as the supply of water, gas and electricity,\r\ntramways and railways, are not in fact competitive, and efficiency is\r\nprobably as well maintained by aggrieved payers of rates and taxes as by\r\nshareholders disappointed of their profits. But the Liberal is not disposed\r\nto admit that similar conditions would produce similar results in\r\nindustries of a more speculative or hazardous character. Nor can he admit\r\nthat private ownership of capital necessarily involves the exploitation of\r\nlabour. In certain industries, notably the cotton industry of Lancashire,\r\nhe sees examples of the successful combination of individual enterprise in\r\nmanagement with minimum standards of life and wages fixed either by the\r\nFactory Acts or by powerful Trade Unions, and he is not satisfied that the\r\nenterprise would be as brilliant or the minimum standards as high if the\r\ncapital engaged were owned by the State.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the Liberal distrusts the bureaucratic system of management\r\nwhich Socialism involves. The London School of Economics seems to him a\r\nvery good servant. He has no doubt that it would be a bad master. Even with\r\nits disadvantages, the system which makes private gain at once the {335}\r\nincentive to efficiency and its only possible test may be much superior to\r\nthat which leaves the determination of industrial policy to a sort of lay\r\nhierarchy. An active and persecuting aristocracy will at least keep its\r\nsubjects alive. The dull and unimaginative methods of bureaucracy stifle\r\neven when they are inspired by benevolence. Officialism is generally fatal\r\nto new ideas, and apart from the reduction of wealth which would probably\r\nfollow the abolition of private profit, the officialization of mind which\r\nwould be diffused throughout society is a sufficiently deadly argument\r\nagainst Socialism. It might even destroy individual life as completely as\r\ndid some of the religions of the East. This argument against Socialism is\r\nto some extent an argument against Social Reform. Social Reform requires\r\nthe appointment of many officials. But the functions of such as have\r\nalready been appointed are confined to inspection, to advice, and to the\r\ncollection of money or information. We have had no experience of officials\r\nengaged in the manufacture of goods for export, or in the conduct of the\r\nshipping trade. Such experience as we have had of municipal enterprise has\r\nonly satisfied us of the capacity of officials who are controlled and\r\ncriticized by unofficial ratepayers, who have a personal and pecuniary\r\ninterest in the efficiency of the official. No Liberal Government has yet\r\nproposed to extend official management to those many fields where success\r\ndepends upon the judicious calculation of risks. Until that proposal is\r\nmade there will always be a gulf between Liberals and Socialists, and a\r\ndistinction between the policy which limits the destructiveness of\r\ncompetition for private gain and that which abolishes such competition\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nA second objection which is urged against Social Reform is its cost; and\r\nthe charges on the public, required by Old Age Pensions, Insurance, and\r\nLabour Exchanges, have afforded a good opportunity for contrasting the\r\ngreatly increased expenditure of Liberal Government with the demand of\r\nLiberal Opposition for \"Peace, Retrenchment, and Reform.\" As the terms are\r\nnow understood, Retrenchment and Reform cannot go together. The new\r\nLiberalism has been compelled to recognize that {336} economy and parsimony\r\nare not synonymous expressions, and that the mere refusal to spend money\r\nmay in the end prove more costly than a judicious outlay in the present.\r\nWhat is too generally ignored by the critics of this new policy is that, in\r\none way or another, all the service which is now being rendered by the\r\nState has already been rendered by society. Since the reign of Elizabeth we\r\nhave admitted our duty to provide for the destitute, and the burden which\r\nhas not fallen upon the poor rates has been borne by private charity, by\r\npublic hospitals, and by the police. In public or private poor relief, in\r\nthe curing of disease, and in the punishment of crime we have long been\r\naccustomed to pay for the consequences of poverty. The new Social Reforms\r\nmerely transfer these various duties to the national Exchequer. It is\r\nimpossible to compare figures of expenditure. But it is most probable that\r\nultimately the total weight of poverty will be considerably less than under\r\nthe old system. Prevention is better than cure. Relief used to be delayed\r\nuntil some permanent degradation of body or character had taken place. It\r\nis now applied while there is still a chance of restoring the unfortunate\r\nto their old efficiency. The Old Age Pension directly relieves the rates by\r\nkeeping the pensioner out of the workhouse, or gives his family the\r\nopportunity of a fuller life by releasing the money hitherto required for\r\nhis support. The Insurance Act should eventually abolish all that very\r\nlarge proportion of pauperism which is produced by casual sickness, prevent\r\nthe deterioration which so often follows the temporary loss of work, and\r\nmaintain the average level of industrial efficiency at a higher level than\r\nbefore. The Minimum Wage Acts impose a direct charge upon industry. It is\r\npossible that some trades may be extinguished because they cannot bear the\r\ncharge. If that should be the event, it can only be because the trades in\r\nquestion are at present parasitic: they do not support themselves, but suck\r\nnourishment from society by way of outdoor relief, charity, petty larceny,\r\nor prostitution. The cost to the community will here be made definite\r\ninstead of remaining unknown. But in most of the underpaid trades the Acts\r\nwill have the same effect as a powerful {337} Trade Union. So long as\r\nParliament abstains from fixing wages, and confines itself to the erection\r\nof machinery for fixing them in accordance with the conditions of the\r\ntrade, Minimum Wage Acts merely create by law what Trade Unionism creates\r\nby voluntary effort. The higher wages established under the Acts will do\r\nwhat higher wages established under Trade Unionism have done. They will\r\nmean increased efficiency, increased production of wealth, and increased\r\npurchasing power. In this case, as in those of the Workmen's Compensation\r\nAct and the Insurance Act, not only will a burden be transferred from one\r\npart of the community to another, but it will in time be reduced in weight.\r\nSo the Act for feeding necessitous school-children, by preventing the\r\nreduction of physical, mental, and moral strength in the present, will\r\nprevent future expenditure in poor relief, hospitals, and police. The\r\nsurvey which includes nothing but the legislative reforms themselves is\r\npartial and deceptive. It is only when we realize that poverty is already\r\nbeing relieved in a tardy, disorganized, and unscientific way that we can\r\nsee how the cost of the new reforms will be in fact a most wise economy of\r\nnational resources, and that by spending on prevention instead of on\r\nrestoration we will actually be saving money.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical argument against Social Reform which has most weight is\r\nneither the argument from bureaucracy nor the argument from expense. It is\r\nthe argument which is more justly directed against Socialism, that by\r\nhelping individuals the State deprives them, in whole or in part, of the\r\ndisposition to help themselves, that they tend to rely more and more upon\r\nthe social organization and less upon their own strength. Everything in the\r\nway of public assistance is thus regarded with suspicion. To feed\r\nschool-children is to weaken parental responsibility. To raise wages by\r\nlegislation is as demoralizing as to distribute doles. To offer a pension\r\nof five shillings a week in old age is to discourage thrift in youth. It is\r\ntherefore better, in the end, that poverty should be allowed to run its\r\ncourse than that a misdirected benevolence should demoralize {338} the\r\npeople. This argument, reproducing the logical individualism of the\r\nUtilitarians, has been greatly strengthened by Darwinism. No less impartial\r\na man than Herbert Spencer has thus applied the theory of evolution to\r\npolitical affairs. \"The well-being of existing humanity, and the unfolding\r\nof it into ... ultimate perfection, are both secured by the same\r\nbeneficent, though severe discipline to which the animate creation at large\r\nis subject; a felicity-pursuing law which never swerves for the avoidance\r\nof partial and temporary suffering. The poverty of the incapable, the\r\ndistresses that come upon the imprudent, the starvation of the idle, and\r\nthose shoulderings aside of the weak by the strong, which leave so many in\r\nshallows and in miseries, are the decree of a large, far-seeing\r\nbenevolence.\"[358] The conception, which makes of foreign politics an\r\nimmoral conflict between nations, is to make of domestic politics an\r\nequally immoral conflict between individuals, in which justice and humanity\r\nare to be set aside as inconsistent with the progress of the race. At first\r\nsight it would appear that the whole of that progress up to the time of\r\nDarwin had been along a wrong line. If there is one thing which most\r\ndistinguishes modern from ancient society, and society of any kind from the\r\ndisorganized existence of primitive man, it is the prevalence of the idea\r\nthat we are, in some measure, responsible for the condition of our\r\nneighbours. The emotions and the reasoning faculties which have produced\r\nmoral inhibitions on our own desires, laws for the protection of the weak\r\nagainst the strong, the machinery of private charity, and the public relief\r\nof the poor, all these have been evolved with the other characteristics of\r\nhumanity as we know it. If the course of past development is any guide we\r\nmay be certain that unless we take steps to alter our conditions, we shall\r\ncertainly continue in the same course in the future. It would be at least\r\nsurprising that the salvation of the race should now be found to lie in\r\ndeliberate reaction, against the movement of countless ages towards the\r\nstage of undisciplined human egoism which followed that of the anthropoid\r\napes. A doctrine so repugnant to what we {339} have been accustomed to\r\nregard as our better feelings requires little examination to discover its\r\nfallacies.\r\n\r\nThe evolutionary argument against Social Reform falls to the ground when it\r\nis once admitted that the individuals in contemplation are individuals\r\norganized in a society, and that it is only so long as they are so\r\norganized that development, as we understand it, can take place. If mankind\r\nwere left to scramble for such good things as it could get without\r\nco-operation, the race would no doubt, in course of time, develop such\r\ncharacteristics as that competition would allow to survive. But if we erect\r\nhigher standards, and require, even from selfish motives, the moral,\r\nintellectual, and physical benefits which only organization, culture, and\r\nthe communication of ideas will produce, the comparison between human\r\nbeings and the rest of the animate creation is useless for our purpose.\r\nSome limitation of the struggle for existence is obviously needed, if we\r\nare not to fall back to the level where only the brute qualities of\r\nstrength, swiftness, and cunning are of value. Once we admit the need of a\r\nsocial organization, which involves a very considerable check on mechanical\r\nevolution by the survival of the fittest, the only controversy is about the\r\nextent and character of the limits on competition, and not about their\r\nexistence. The beasts, birds, and fishes which are unfit for their\r\nenvironment, and have not those qualities which make for survival, perish\r\nby disease or are destroyed by their enemies. The man generally remains a\r\ndrag on the community. What is the community to do with him? The lethal\r\nchamber being regarded as impossible, it must keep him in hospital, in\r\nprison, in the workhouse, or in a charitable institution, and if he is not\r\nthus maintained he will maintain himself by crime or beggary. Throughout\r\nhis life he remains a parasite upon his fellows. It is always therefore the\r\nmost economical course, if it be possible, to alter his environment, so\r\nthat he may have the chance of supporting himself.\r\n\r\nBut the argument for Social Reform is not based only on the possibility of\r\naltering environment so that individuals who are unfit for it may maintain\r\nthemselves so long as they live. Spencer was reasoning away from the facts.\r\nIt is not only the incapable {340} who are poor. It is not only the\r\nimprudent who are overcome by distresses. It is not only the idle who\r\nstarve. Bad conditions of life destroy not only the inefficient, but the\r\nefficient, and many of those whom they do not kill they maim. He is a very\r\ndull and stupid observer who supposes that all the slovenly, debauched, and\r\ncriminal men and women whom he sees around him are what they are because of\r\ntheir innate qualities, or that all those who die of their own dirt,\r\ndebauchery, and criminality are any worse. They were not all born criminals\r\nwhom our great-grandfathers hung or transported for petty larceny, nor are\r\nthey all born inefficients whom some modern eugenists would segregate or\r\nsterilize. A bad environment does not merely destroy the inefficient, it\r\nmanufactures them; and it is as reasonable to oppose social reform, because\r\nit prevents the elimination of the unfit, as it would be to defend\r\nexcessive eating and drinking, or sitting in wet clothes. Unhealthy living\r\nwould no doubt destroy people with weak stomachs and livers, and a tendency\r\nto chalky deposits in the joints. But for every one who perished in this\r\nstruggle with environment there would be ten who survived. Bad housing and\r\nbad wages produce the same results as bad habits. Of all the slum children\r\nwho die of their surroundings, a large number would have lived to become\r\nvaluable citizens if they had had better conditions of life in their early\r\nyears. An ill-fed girl becomes the mother of weakly children. Inadequate\r\nhousing produces disease, incest, and prostitution, besides killing a few\r\nundesirable infants. Casual labour kills only after it has given birth to\r\nan incalculable amount of laziness, vice, and mental disorder. Everywhere\r\nthe good is kept back, even if some of the bad is prevented from\r\ndevelopment. The slum creates what the slum destroys, and it discharges\r\nupon the community much that it does not destroy. The elimination of the\r\nunfit is uncertain and capricious. The deterioration of the fit is certain\r\nand remorseless. Social Reform, if it is nothing else, is thus the only\r\npossible means of discovering which individuals are fit in the human sense.\r\nIt is only when all have a chance of survival that we can distinguish the\r\nnaturally inefficient from the accidentally inefficient. The {341} reformer\r\nneed have no fear that his generous impulses are signs of an anti-social\r\nsentimentalism. He is in fact only Evolution conscious of itself. He marks\r\na point in the great course of life, at which the cultivation of\r\nindividuals ceases to be careless and wasteful, and becomes deliberate and\r\neconomical, adapting its own environment to the achievement of its ideals.\r\n\r\nWhen the necessity for Social Reform is admitted, the provision for its\r\ncost affords another opportunity for the conflict of Liberalism and\r\nToryism. The Budget of 1909, which tempted a plutocratic House of Lords\r\ninto a rashness which an aristocratic House of Lords had never ventured to\r\ndisplay, was a clear expression of the new Liberal principles. Part of that\r\nBudget was merely an extension of the Finance Act of 1894. Another part was\r\nentirely new. It carried the principle of graduation to a further point,\r\nboth in income tax and in death duties, and it imposed for the first time a\r\ntax upon the natural monopoly of land. To those who understand the meaning\r\nof Social Reform, the necessity of the Budget is clear. Money must be found\r\nfor the purpose of relieving poverty. To raise it by a general taxation of\r\nrich and poor would be to lay a new burden upon the poor in order to remove\r\nan old burden, to increase by one act the poverty which the other was\r\nintended to diminish. Social Reform financed by Protection is an economic\r\ncontradiction. The money required to improve the condition of the poor must\r\nbe taken from the rich, if it is to be of any practical use. The heaviest\r\nof the new taxes were therefore placed, according to a graduated scale,\r\nupon the payers of income tax, the inheritors of large estates, and the\r\nrecipients of unearned increments from land. These taxes had one principle\r\nin common. They were based, not upon the enjoyment of property, but the\r\nmethod of its acquisition. Those who drew incomes from permanent\r\ninvestments were taxed more heavily than those whose prosperity depended\r\nupon their personal exertions, and the owners of property, which was a\r\nnatural monopoly and grew in value without any effort of their own, were\r\ncompelled to pay charges, from which the owners of property of other kinds\r\nwere exempted. Other taxes were imposed upon {342} the luxuries of the\r\nworking classes. These would in any case be paid by those who could afford\r\nthem, and would not deprive a poor man of anything which was a real\r\nnecessity of life.\r\n\r\nThe arguments against the Budget were characteristic of their plutocratic\r\norigin. The class which had used Imperialist sentiment in the interest of\r\nits foreign investments, and had proposed at once to finance its military\r\nexploits and to increase its wealth by taxation of the common people,\r\nnaturally resented this increase of its own fiscal burdens. The super-tax\r\non incomes of more than L5,000 a year was described as a penalty upon\r\nthrift and enterprise, and it was urged with most patriotic zeal that these\r\nappropriations of surplus wealth would produce unemployment. The answer to\r\nthe first argument is that incomes and accumulations of a size to be\r\naffected by the new taxes are not produced by thrift, in any real sense of\r\nthe word, nor will the enterprise which produces them be checked by such\r\ntrifling deductions. Enterprise was as vigorous and successful fifty years\r\nago, when L10,000 a year was a very large income, as it is now, when\r\nincomes of L50,000 and L100,000, are almost as common. A certain definite\r\ninducement is required to stimulate a man to the utmost use of his capacity\r\nfor producing wealth. Beyond that limit all that he earns is sheer waste,\r\nand uneconomic remuneration which evokes no further effort. Upon that\r\nsurplus, and upon that only, do the new taxes operate. The argument from\r\nunemployment is more specious. It is that, deprived of the money required\r\nfor income tax and death duties, the more prosperous citizens will be\r\ncompelled to dismiss some of their servants. During the discussion of the\r\nBudget, the general public learnt, for the first time, that those wealthy\r\npersons who spent money on horses and dogs, motor-cars, jewellery, and\r\nchina, shooting-boxes, racing stables, and rock-gardens were animated by no\r\nselfish love of their own ease and comfort, but by a disinterested passion\r\nfor providing remunerative labour for the common people. The argument was\r\npartial. It dealt only with the taxes of the Budget, and ignored the\r\nalternative taxes of Tariff Reform. The problem was to raise money.\r\nWhatever form the taxation took, it must {343} deprive the taxpayer of his\r\npower of spending money and employing labour. If L1,000 was paid by a man\r\nwith L20,000 a year, his power to employ motormen and gardeners, jockeys,\r\ngamekeepers, and dealers in pictures and jewellery was reduced by precisely\r\nthat amount. But if the same sum is paid by a thousand cotton operatives,\r\ntheir power to employ butchers, bakers, tailors, and bootmakers is equally\r\nreduced. The reduction of employment is precisely the same in each case,\r\nwhether the L1,000 is taxed out of one rich man or out of a thousand poor\r\nmen. But there is an infinite difference in the other consequences of the\r\ntwo systems of taxation. The rich man paying the L1,000 is not deprived of\r\nanything which contributes to his present efficiency, to his future\r\nsecurity, or to his reasonable enjoyment of life.[359] The poor men paying\r\nthe same sum may suffer in any one of the three ways. A charge of sixpence\r\na week upon an artisan who earns twenty-five shillings a week may be the\r\ndifference between sufficiency and insufficiency. A charge of L1,000 a year\r\nupon the head of a family who earns, or receives without earning, L20,000 a\r\nyear leaves him with everything which could be required for the fullest\r\ndevelopment of all his natural capacities. Taxation of poverty cripples\r\nlife. Taxation of wealth does not. The new Liberalism, seeking to extend\r\nlife, must draw upon abundance and superfluity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their economic proposals the Liberal Governments since 1906 have thus\r\nadvanced along the old line towards the more complete emancipation of the\r\nindividual. If they have interfered with liberty, they have interfered with\r\nliberty on one side only to enlarge it on another, and the money required\r\nfor reform has been so provided as to reduce by as little as possible\r\nindividual capacity for growth. Whatever the particular defects of these\r\n{344} social reforms may be, their general character has been as Liberal as\r\nthat of the reforms of 1832 and 1868. In other matters they have met with\r\nvaried success. Their repayment of debt and their refusal to continue the\r\nwasteful policy of borrowing for the construction of works have followed\r\nthe best traditions of Peel and Gladstone, though Mr. Lloyd George's\r\ntreatment of the surplus of 1912 affords a vicious precedent for less\r\neconomical successors. The Irish University Act, the Home Rule Bill, and\r\nthe Welsh Disestablishment Bill are partly recognitions of the principle of\r\nnationality, concessions to the demand that matters of local concern shall\r\nbe regulated by local opinion. They also express the other Liberal\r\nprinciple, that sects shall be equal in the State. Recent demonstrations in\r\nUlster, the persecution of Catholic and Liberal workmen in the shipyards of\r\nBelfast, and speeches which reveal a ferocity of religious bigotry equal to\r\nthat of the seventeenth century, have confirmed rather than weakened\r\nLiberal belief in Home Rule. So long as one section of Irish society looks\r\nto England as the successor of an ancient enemy, and the other looks to her\r\nas a protector against the descendants of those whom their fathers kept\r\nbeneath their heel, so long will incompatibility of temper exist. As soon\r\nas possible Liberals intend to put the inhabitants of Ireland in such a\r\nposition that, ceasing to batten upon the exhumed remains of mediaeval\r\ncontroversies, they may discover, in the course of managing their joint\r\naffairs, that they are only Irishmen after all. The various Education Bills\r\nseem to have only partially expressed Liberal principles. It is impossible,\r\nin a country where sharply divided sects exist side by side, to establish a\r\nsystem which shall completely satisfy any party. Denominationalists and\r\nundenominationalists must agree upon mutual concessions. No practical\r\nhardship is done where denominational schools, with teachers subjected to\r\ndenominational tests, are confined to the instruction of children whose\r\nparents approve of such a system. The demand of some Nonconformists, that\r\nthey should not be compelled to pay for denominational teaching, cannot be\r\nrecognized unless the demand of some Churchmen and all Catholics, {345}\r\nthat they should not be compelled to pay for undenominational teaching, is\r\nalso recognized. Whatever logical answer there may be to the second, a\r\nLiberal State, accepting the equality of all sects as its first principle,\r\nmust give them precisely the same liberty as the first. If a Churchman is\r\nnot to count for more than a Dissenter, a Dissenter is not to count for\r\nmore than a Churchman. Where the denominationalist case passes from a\r\nreasonable request for justice to the assertion of an insolent and\r\nintolerable claim to control the opinions of others is when it requires\r\nthat any school, which was founded for denominational purposes, shall be\r\nmaintained by public money as a denominational school, with denominational\r\nteachers, for the instruction of Nonconformist children. No Liberal can\r\nhave regard to this claim, not to teach their own opinions to their own\r\nchildren, but to teach their own opinions to other people's children.\r\nNothing can justify this part of the denominationalist case, which would\r\nnot also justify a grant from the national Exchequer to the Church of\r\nEngland for a mission to convert Dissenters. So far as the recent proposals\r\ntend to overthrow this denominational control of schools to which the\r\nchildren of Nonconformist parents are compelled by circumstances to go,\r\nthey are as purely Liberal as the repeal of the Test Act or the abolition\r\nof the Church monopoly of the Universities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn two matters of vital importance the Liberal Governments have\r\nconspicuously failed to express Liberal principles. The right of the\r\nindividual to control his own government was recognized, with equal courage\r\nand wisdom, when the conquered Dutch Republics, in the face of Tory\r\nopposition, received the grant of responsible government under the Crown.\r\nThe contest with the House of Lords in 1910 re-established the control of\r\ngovernment elected by representatives, and the subordination of the\r\nhereditary and irresponsible House to that which the people could choose\r\nfor themselves. The payment of Members has somewhat enlarged the field of\r\nchoice, though the expense of an election is still an almost impassable\r\nobstacle to a {346} poor man. The Plural Voting Bill, passed through the\r\nCommons and rejected by the Lords, was an attempt of the same sort to give\r\nequal political rights to individuals, irrespective of the amount of their\r\nproperty, and the Franchise Bill of 1912 proposed to abolish the property\r\nqualification, or limitation, altogether. The extension of political\r\nfreedom in South Africa and the defeat of the House of Lords in its attempt\r\nto prevent the application of the new economic principles of Liberalism\r\nrepresented real conflicts in matters of vital importance. The other\r\nmeasures were comparatively trifling, and the proposal to enfranchise all\r\nadult men has less popular enthusiasm behind it than any previous Reform\r\nBill which was introduced by a Government. The only existing problem which\r\ninvolves the struggle between essential Liberalism and essential Toryism is\r\nthat of Woman Suffrage. It is here, more than in any other field of\r\ndomestic policy, that the Government have failed to discover and to pursue\r\nthe Liberal course.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of the writer to describe in detail a course of\r\nevents which has been so interesting to the student of reforming\r\nfanaticism, unimaginative administration, and political chicanery. The\r\nlevity with which Members of Parliament have given pledges which they never\r\nmeant to perform, and have prepared to break pledges given openly, in the\r\nface of all circumstances, existing, probable, and possible, may seem\r\nludicrous or contemptible according to the disposition of those who watch\r\nthe working of the political machine.[360] The writer has little to say\r\nabout this subject in this place. He is now only concerned to place the\r\ndemand for the enfranchisement of women in relation {347} with other\r\nexpressions of the Liberal habit of mind. The arguments which support Woman\r\nSuffrage are those which have supported every proposal for the\r\nenfranchisement of men. Women claim now to be treated in political society\r\nas Dissenters claimed to be treated in 1828, and Catholics in 1829, and the\r\nmiddle class in 1832. They decline to remain any longer at the disposition\r\nof governors over whom they have no control. They desire to enforce their\r\nopinions, not merely as a sex, for the removal of such political\r\ndisabilities as are imposed upon them on account of their sex, but as\r\nseparate and distinct individuals, each of whom has the same interest in\r\nquestions of general politics as a man. Women have peculiar grievances in\r\nmarriage laws, in the law dealing with sexual vice and crime, in the\r\npayment of women in the Civil Service, and in threatened legislation for\r\nexcluding married women from work in factories. But their peculiar\r\ngrievances are no more to them than those which they share with men. They\r\npay taxes, their conditions of labour are regulated by the State, their\r\nwages may be affected, favourably or adversely, by legislation, questions\r\nof peace and war are decided to their benefit or detriment, in almost every\r\naction of Government the individual woman is involved to precisely the same\r\nextent as the individual man. It is not to them a question of men imposing\r\noppressive taxes upon women, it is a question of a legislature imposing\r\ntaxes upon individuals. The human being who controls his own fortunes and\r\ntakes all the chance of life in society is to them no different from any\r\nother human being in the same situation. To confer political control upon\r\none class of such human beings and to deny it to the other is to establish\r\none of those artificial distinctions in social value which are of the\r\nessence of Toryism, and produce the private egoism in the superior and the\r\nincomplete development of the inferior which have been already described.\r\n\r\nThe arguments against Woman Suffrage are the usual arguments of Toryism.\r\nThe franchise is not a right, but a privilege, to be conferred by a\r\ndisposing class upon such persons as it selects. Women are, from physical\r\ncauses, periodically incapable of taking a rational interest in public\r\naffairs. To enfranchise women will {348} distract them from their proper\r\nduties of maternity and the management of the home. It will produce\r\ndissension between husband and wife. It will lead to the admission of women\r\nto the professions, to Parliament, and to public offices. To those who have\r\nfollowed the course of Liberalism, as described in these pages, the\r\narguments will appear familiar. The first is the general Tory assumption,\r\ninconsistent with every Liberal proposal of every kind, that the individual\r\nhas no rights, except such as the State, or rather the governing class,\r\nchooses to bestow upon him. The second, third, and fourth are the egoistic\r\narguments, which express the mind of a person who sees another always in\r\nrelation with himself. They assume that the other is completely defined in\r\nterms of that relationship, and has outside its limits no character. All\r\nthe actions of the other are explained by abstract reasoning from that\r\nassumption. Women are thus supposed to be involved entirely in their sex,\r\nand while no man suggests that the demand of transport workers for higher\r\nwages or the violence incident to a transport strike is an expression of\r\nmaleness, the demand of women for the franchise and the violence of\r\nmilitant Suffragists are assumed to be the actions of spinsters\r\ndisappointed of maternity and of females impelled by perverted sexual\r\ninstincts.[361] The argument from maternity is one of those which imply\r\nthat the governed class must be confined, so far as artificial methods\r\npermit, to those occupations which it can only perform in association with\r\nthe governors. Women's political fortunes must be regulated upon the\r\nassumption that they ought to become mothers. Women are not to be free to\r\nchoose maternity out of all possible occupations, they must be driven to it\r\nby the want of opportunity to do anything else. It is not a question of\r\nwhat women think that they ought to do, but of what men think that they\r\nought to do. The individual is not to have the right to plan out her life\r\nas she pleases. Maternity is her business, and men will so contrive the\r\nState as to {349} discourage her from engaging in any other. In the same\r\nway eighteenth-century fathers warned their daughters not to develop their\r\nminds, lest the revelation of intellectual power should discourage suitors.\r\nLiterary education was withheld in the reign of George III for the same\r\nreason that political education is withheld to-day, because it involves the\r\nindependent activity of the individual. The fourth argument is even more\r\ncrudely selfish than the third. Stated in plain terms, it means that if\r\nwomen have votes they will tend to form political opinions of their own,\r\nthat these may differ from those of their husbands, and that as such a\r\ndiscordance could not be tolerated, the home will be broken up. The husband\r\nmight be wrong. But the argument has nothing to do with the soundness of\r\nhis opinions. He is entitled to think for himself, and in order to maintain\r\nhis unquestioned despotism of political judgment the wife is to be deprived\r\nof the encouragement to thinking for herself. Another argument, that the\r\nnatives of India will refuse to submit to government by a race which has\r\nenfranchised its women, is a characteristic example of the reaction of\r\nImperialism upon domestic liberty. The constitution of the United Kingdom\r\nis to be determined, not by the needs of its inhabitants, but by the wishes\r\nof a race whom they have conquered. The development of the individual is\r\nsubordinated to the use which the disposing class wishes to make of her.\r\nEven if it were true that the Indian peoples would object to the\r\nenfranchisement of English women, an assertion which has never been\r\nsupported by any evidence, the success of the argument would be the most\r\nastonishing example of Toryism in English history. No Englishman would\r\nsuggest, after the loss of the American Colonies, that one self-governing\r\ncommunity of white men within the Empire should dictate to another how its\r\ngovernment should be constituted. But it carries the opposite doctrine of\r\ninterference in local affairs to a frantic extremity, to say that a\r\nconquered race shall be allowed to dictate the constitution of the\r\ngovernment of the conquerors. If this argument prevails, and the ill temper\r\nof the Indian peoples is allowed to decide the form of our political {350}\r\nsystem, our eighteenth-century exploitation of them will be amply avenged.\r\nThe last argument, that enfranchisement will only be a step towards other\r\nmeasures of emancipation, is another characteristic expression of Toryism.\r\nPrivate depreciation will cease, as soon as political depreciation is\r\nabolished. How can a Liberal man dictate to a woman how she shall exert\r\nherself in society? There is no motive, other than that of selfish\r\ninterest, the desire to retain the most honourable and profitable\r\noccupations for the dominant sex, which can impel a man to the use of this\r\nargument. It is precisely that which most roused Burke to the support of\r\nthe Catholics. It was used forty years ago against the women who wished to\r\npractise medicine, and Sophia Jex-Blake was covered with insult, and even\r\npelted with mud, for no other reason than that she tried to obtain\r\nadmission to the medical schools of Edinburgh. It is now admitted that if a\r\nwoman has the natural capacities which enable her to practise medicine mere\r\nartificial restrictions shall not stand in her way. When the medical\r\nprofession is opened, how can any other logically be kept closed? When the\r\nindividual can satisfy the tests which are imposed at the entrance, whether\r\nthey are tests by examination or tests by election, why should she be\r\nexcluded because she possesses the quality of sex, which has nothing to do\r\nwith those tests? This is simply to brand women, who vary infinitely among\r\nthemselves, with a class mark, and to decide the fortunes of each\r\nindividual by some general assumption which may be true in other cases and\r\nfalse in hers. No one can use this argument, who is not steeped in those\r\nideas of domination and disposition, which once operated in the same way to\r\nprevent the free development of Catholics and Dissenters. The case against\r\nWoman Suffrage varies little from the case against every other Liberal\r\nmovement, and some of the arguments are literally the same as the arguments\r\nagainst the Reform Bills of 1832, 1867, and 1884. Fundamentally the case is\r\npure Toryism.[362]\r\n\r\n{351}\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the movement in favour of Woman Suffrage, neglected during the\r\nImperialist reaction, became once more prominent. Various causes\r\ncontributed to produce this revival. Like all the other movements for\r\nenlarging the opportunities of women, it partook of the fortunes of the\r\ngeneral movement of Liberalism. In the history of English women the periods\r\nof emancipation have always been those of Liberal ascendancy, and the\r\ngeographical and social divisions between Liberalism and Toryism have\r\nalways been substantially the same as those between Feminism and\r\nAnti-Feminism.[363] The manufacturing districts of the North are Liberal\r\nand Feminist. The agricultural districts of the South are Tory and\r\nAnti-Feminist. The Feminist movement is strong among the better sort of\r\nartisans and those of the middle class who depend upon their own exertions.\r\nIt is weak among the country gentry and those whom accumulated wealth\r\nenables to live a parasitic or partly parasitic existence. The so-called\r\nLiberal who opposes the emancipation of women finds himself allied with his\r\nhereditary political enemies. Liberalism must be universal. The immediate\r\ncauses of the new agitation for Woman Suffrage were three. The first was\r\nthe {352} economic condition of working women, upon whom the low wages,\r\nlong hours, and unhealthy surroundings, which are described by the general\r\nterm of \"sweating,\" pressed with far greater force than upon men. The\r\nsecond was the general improvement in feminine education, not only by the\r\nimprovement of schools and colleges for women of the middle class and the\r\npublic education of women of the working class, but by the development of\r\nwomen's organizations. Bodies like the Women's Liberal Federation, a purely\r\npolitical association, the National Union of Women Workers, an association\r\nof middle-class women for the study and improvement of women's labour of\r\nall sorts, the Women's Co-operative Guild, an association of working women,\r\nthe various Women's Trade Unions, associations of women for the protection\r\nof their industrial interests, all these bodies, founded in the twenty-five\r\nyears preceding the Liberal victory, had broadened and deepened the minds\r\nof women, extended their knowledge of affairs, increased their practical\r\ncapacity, and given them that interest in association for the management of\r\ncommon concerns which is the basis of all political movements. In\r\nparticular, their attention had been directed to foreign countries like the\r\nUnited States, Australia, and Norway, where women had recently been\r\nenfranchised, and more than one international association linked up the\r\nEnglish movement with the rest of the universal progress of women. But the\r\nmost influential of all the causes of the new strength of the agitation was\r\nthe increased knowledge of physical facts and the consequences of sexual\r\nvice. The development of sick nursing since Florence Nightingale, the\r\nexperience of work among prostitutes since Josephine Butler, and the study\r\nof medicine since Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Sophia Jex-Blake, had\r\nrevealed to an increasing number of women the dreadful consequences of a\r\nmoral standard which indulged men and degraded women. Prostitution appears\r\nto the Suffragist to be a direct consequence of the political supremacy of\r\none sex over the other, to be the result of that encouragement of egoism\r\nwhich always follows the disposition of the political affairs of one class\r\nby another. There are in the United Kingdom at the {353} present day not\r\nless than one hundred thousand women who are kept, through no desire of\r\ntheir own, for no other purpose than that of the destruction of their\r\nbodies and souls for the gratification of their political superiors. In\r\n1899 Englishmen went to war, as they supposed, to rescue some of their\r\ncountrymen from oppressive taxation and the abuse of the machinery of\r\njustice. The Suffragists since 1906 have been conducting a political\r\nagitation of a milder sort, as they suppose, to rescue some of their\r\nfellow-creatures from an infinitely more dreadful fate. Those who require\r\nan explanation of their earnestness, or an excuse for their extravagance,\r\nwill find it in their belief that social degradation is the inevitable\r\nconsequence of political inferiority. The White Slave Traffic Act of 1913,\r\nflung by Parliament as a sop to womanhood in revolt, merely touches the\r\nsurface of the problem. The whole system of sexual ethics is put in issue\r\nby the Woman Suffrage movement.[364]\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Government and their followers to deal liberally with\r\nthis question has been an interesting revelation of the incompleteness of\r\nself-styled Liberalism, and of the power of the party machine to subdue\r\nindependent thinking to the convenience of Ministers with stereotyped\r\nminds. The majority of members of the Liberal party, in the Cabinet and\r\nelsewhere, have acknowledged the justice of the demand, even though its\r\nsudden violence has taken them by surprise. A minority, which unhappily\r\nincludes Mr. Asquith, have displayed a Toryism, in matters of sex, as\r\ncomplete as that of Castlereagh. It has been particularly unfortunate for\r\nthe credit of the Liberal party that its leader at such a critical moment\r\nshould be a man of little imagination. It is the large imagination, ever\r\nranging beyond the bounds of the practicable and the expedient, and\r\ndetecting in the obscurity of apparent chaos the currents of new social\r\nforces, which distinguishes the greatest statesmen from those who are\r\nmerely {354} great. Peel had it, though in him it was often blind and\r\ngroping. Disraeli had it, though spoilt by his mean and tawdry ideals.\r\nGladstone had it, in full measure, and so, with less practical gifts, had\r\nCampbell-Bannerman. The mantle of leadership descended in 1908 upon the\r\nshoulders of a man who had all the qualities of a great leader except the\r\ngreatest of all; and Mr. Asquith's inability to see the rightness of the\r\nwomen's movement has brought his party into great difficulty and greater\r\ndiscredit. In spite of his own public promise to adopt the opinion of the\r\nHouse of Commons, even if it be contrary to his own, a perverted sense of\r\nloyalty has caused many of his followers to find in his feelings a reason\r\nfor the violation of their own express and public pledges. This dullness of\r\nvision in Ministers has been severely blamed. But it is not for the want of\r\nimagination which disables them from understanding the problem that they\r\nare to be condemned. The historian who wastes his indignation on such\r\nnatural incapacities will have little to spare for the graver political\r\nvices. The blameworthiness of the Liberal party and the Government lies in\r\ntheir mismanagement of the disorder which was produced by their refusal to\r\nredress grievances. The writer has nothing to say in defence of the recent\r\nactions of the militant Suffragists. The earliest breaches of the law\r\nproduced no substantial injury to anybody but the women themselves. Those\r\nof the last twelve months have in some cases been as wicked as they have in\r\nall cases been foolish. But however arrogant, reckless, and unscrupulous\r\nthe militant movement may now have become, it was in origin as\r\ndisinterested and as remorseless in its self-sacrifice as any political\r\nmovement in history, and its corruption is due no more to the native\r\nill-disposition of the women than to the folly of the Government and its\r\nsupporters.[365]\r\n\r\n{355}\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, the treatment of the militant Suffrage movement since\r\nthe death of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has been in the very temper of\r\nthe Toryism of the French Revolution. Trifling disorders, springing from\r\npolitical discontent, have been treated as serious crimes, and people who\r\noffended, not out of private malice or greed, but out of a desire to\r\nimprove the conditions of society, have been subjected to harsh and\r\ndegrading punishments. It has always been the contention of Liberals in\r\nopposition that a distinction should be drawn between criminals whose\r\nmotives are political and criminals whose motives are personal, between\r\nthose who break the law for private and anti-social ends and those who\r\nbreak it for ends which they honestly believe represent the advantage of\r\ntheir fellow-creatures. This distinction, obvious to the moralist, is\r\nexpressed in the legislation of almost every other civilized state, as well\r\nas in that Act of Parliament which provides that a seditious libeller shall\r\nbe treated in prison, not as a common offender, but as a first-class\r\nmisdemeanant. The same ethical distinction impelled the Whigs to oppose\r\nTory methods of repression during the French War, and was the basis of all\r\nmodern Liberal attacks on Tory methods in Ireland. Liberals have always\r\nrecognized that the maintenance of order is only a condition of the redress\r\nof grievances, and that those who are impatient for redress are to be\r\nrestrained only and not to be injured. If there is one principle of\r\nadministration more distinctively Liberal than any other, it is that\r\nwrongful action from right motives requires delicate handling, and that\r\neven if it must be punished, the motives which produce it must be\r\ndestroyed, not by brutality, but by removal of the abuse which has created\r\nthem. What the Government did with the militant Suffrage movement was to\r\nviolate this essentially Liberal principle, and while they refused to\r\nremove the cause of discontent, they repressed its early and trifling\r\nsymptoms with a severity which only dangerous crime could have\r\ndeserved.[366] The {356} Government in fact did what Tory Governments have\r\nalways done. They looked, not to the people concerned, to find out what\r\nthey were, and why they acted as they did, but to the class brand which\r\ncustom had placed upon them. They thought they were dealing with women,\r\nwhen in fact they were only dealing with human beings. They assumed that\r\nthe disorder was due to something peculiar to the sex, and not to a state\r\nof mind which was common to men and women alike. Their formula was not the\r\ngeneral political formula, \"Disorder springs from grievances,\" but some\r\nhasty deduction from inaccurate assumptions about the physical constitution\r\nof women. They thought that they were dealing, not with political\r\ndiscontent, but with sexual aberration, and they sought for explanations,\r\nnot in the history of Reform, Chartism, and Fenianism, but in medical\r\ntreatises on the diseases of women.[367] They did not reflect that this\r\nrevolt of women did not differ in any essential from previous revolts of\r\nmen, or that as it sprang from similar causes it could be cured by the same\r\nremedies. When Ministers ought to have been giving facilities to a Woman\r\nSuffrage Bill, they were contriving means of avoiding vitriol, and based\r\ntheir policy upon speculations about erotic mania when they should have\r\nthought of nothing but common political principles. This sexuality of mind,\r\nexactly reproducing the mental habit of eighteenth-century Toryism,\r\ndetermined their fatal course of action.\r\n\r\nMinisters could not reasonably have been required to introduce a Government\r\nBill for the enfranchisement of women. The Cabinet had not been formed on\r\nthat basis, and no Anti-Suffrage {357} Minister could be compelled to\r\nsubmit his judgment to that of his colleagues. But there has not been, at\r\nany time since 1906, any reason why facilities should not have been given\r\nfor the passing of a private members' Bill. So long as the Government\r\nrefused to help the women, and refused to allow private members to help\r\nthem, even while they continued to inflict degrading forms of punishment,\r\nso long must their administration increase instead of diminish discontent.\r\nFacilities for the private Bill were refused year after year, until the\r\nmilitant women and their sympathizers had become convinced of the\r\ninsincerity of the Government, and when at last the concession was obtained\r\nit was robbed of all value by the recollection of previous quibbling and\r\nevasion. In the meantime punishment had failed to do anything but poison\r\nthe temper of agitation. Imprisonment in the third division among common\r\nfelons was at first imposed upon women who had been guilty only of\r\ntechnical offences. When the women were roused to demand privileged\r\ntreatment in the second division, the Government advanced to granting\r\nordinary treatment in the second division. When the demand became a demand\r\nfor imprisonment in the first division, the Government consented to\r\nprivileged treatment in the second division. When the women refused to\r\nsubmit to any imprisonment at all, and prepared to starve rather than\r\nremain in jail, the Government made a partial surrender, and offered the\r\nleaders the first division, while it kept their followers, the tools and\r\ninstruments of their conspiracy, in the second. Each stage of the disease\r\nhas been conscientiously treated with those remedies which would have cured\r\nit at the preceding stage, and always without any result, except to\r\nincrease the contempt with which the offenders regarded the Government.\r\nConcessions, which should have been made boldly and generously, have been\r\nmade grudgingly and parsimoniously, and where prompt and spontaneous action\r\nwould have been effective, this tardy and reluctant yielding to pressure\r\nhas produced no good at all.\r\n\r\nThe folly of the Government has not been confined to their neglect. In two\r\nmatters they have been guilty of positive action, {358} for which they\r\ncannot escape heavy censure. The first was the adoption of the policy of\r\nfeeding by force those women who starved rather than submit to degrading\r\nconditions of imprisonment. The second was Mr. Churchill's refusal to\r\ninquire into the charges which were brought against the police in\r\nconnection with one of the women's deputations. The writer will not attempt\r\nto argue the abstract merits of the operation of forcible feeding. He has\r\nread most of the public and private proofs that among criminals, lunatics,\r\nand dyspeptics it is a harmless process. They appear to him to have nothing\r\nto do with the Government's adoption of it in the case of people who were\r\nneither of bad character nor of unsound mind, and who were not only\r\nunwilling patients, but were already inspired by a profound resentment\r\nagainst their political superiors. It is not the business of a statesman to\r\nconsider how his actions would affect other persons in other conditions. It\r\nis his business to consider only what is their effect upon the particular\r\nindividuals with whom he has to deal at the particular moment. Tried by\r\nthis test, the Government's forcible feeding was of almost incredible\r\nstupidity. It is clear that in the case of the militant women it produced\r\ngrave physical and mental injuries, in many cases of a permanent kind.[368]\r\nOf its political consequences the writer can speak from personal knowledge.\r\nIt exasperated the temper of the agitation to an infinitely greater degree,\r\nand brought us, in 1909, from the breaking of a few panes of glass to the\r\nbrink of assassination. The concession of privileged treatment which was\r\nwrested from Mr. Churchill in 1910 at once allayed this dangerous spirit,\r\nbut it was at once revived in 1912, when Mr. McKenna, defying all\r\nexperience, resumed the stupid and brutal policy of his predecessor. It is\r\nof course argued that the Government cannot enforce the law unless it\r\nadopts this course. Are we to release dangerous criminals because they\r\nrefuse food? The {359} answer to this is simply that if the Government had\r\nbeen wise in the past they would have had no such difficulty to encounter\r\nin the present. When forcible feeding was first employed, hardly a single\r\nassault, even of the most trivial character, had been committed, and there\r\nhad only been a few isolated cases of the breaking of windows. If\r\nconcessions had been freely granted then, crime would not have become so\r\nfrequent or so dangerous now. The Government, having adopted harsh methods\r\nat the beginning, are impelled to use harsher methods now. They have been\r\noccupied with great diligence in turning enthusiasts into fanatics, and\r\nfanatics into criminals, and they are now faced with dangers and\r\ndifficulties which could once have been prevented by the use of tact and\r\ndiscretion. Five years ago they might have disarmed their rebellious\r\nsubjects by giving a week of Parliamentary time for the study of their\r\ngrievance. To-day, they can only subdue them by starvation or hanging. They\r\nwill get little credit from posterity either for humanity or for wisdom.\r\n\r\nThe episode of Parliament Square was as ugly an affair as Mitchelstown or\r\nPeterloo. On the 18th November, 1910, the militant organization known as\r\nthe Social and Political Union sent a numerous body of women to present a\r\nmemorial to the Prime Minister. Mr. Asquith, whose views had been\r\nrepeatedly published, declined to receive the deputation, it was turned\r\nback by the police, and many women were arrested. Women, under similar\r\ncircumstances, had been more than once maltreated by the mob. On this\r\noccasion it was alleged that brutality was displayed by the police as well\r\nas by the populace. In more than twenty cases specific charges of indecent\r\nassault were made. Many of the women concerned are known to the writer,\r\npersonally or by reputation, and however strongly he may disagree with\r\ntheir general policy, he has no doubt that they are incapable of\r\nfabricating accusations of this sort. The police, against whom the charges\r\nwere made, were not those who had had to deal with previous deputations,\r\nbut had been brought in from rougher districts like Whitechapel. The case\r\nagainst them was not {360} brought by the militant women, but by the\r\ncommittee of Members of Parliament of all parties, which had been formed to\r\npress forward the cause of Woman Suffrage in the House of Commons, and it\r\nwas with great reluctance that the women consented to give the committee\r\nthe information for which it asked. Mr. Ellis Griffith, a Liberal, and Lord\r\nRobert Cecil, a Conservative, both lawyers of experience and reputation,\r\npersonally examined some of the women, and read the written statements of\r\nthe rest, and came to the conclusion that the complaints were made honestly\r\nand deserved inquiry. In the face of this request Mr. Churchill behaved\r\nprecisely as Lord Grenville behaved in 1819, and Mr. Balfour in 1887. He\r\nmade no attempt to examine any witnesses against the police, and he\r\ndeclared that the charges should be brought against individuals in a court\r\nof law.[369] But while he refused to pronounce judgment on the constables,\r\nhe was eager to pronounce judgment on the women. He acted, not as an\r\nimpartial representative of the public in a dispute between officials and\r\nprivate citizens, but as a champion of the officials. He threw all his\r\ninfluence against the women, described their story as a fabrication, and\r\nthe Social and Political Union as \"a copious fountain of mendacity.\" Mr.\r\nChurchill's party followers will no doubt be content to accept his\r\njudgment. Posterity cannot act so lightly. It is not to accept accusations\r\n{361} against individual policemen to say that charges put forward under\r\nsuch circumstances, and supported by such responsible and independent\r\nauthorities, must have had some foundation in fact. No impartial observer\r\ncan acquit either the police of misconduct, or the Home Secretary of a\r\ngross and partisan abuse of the powers of his office. Lord Gladstone, who\r\nbegan the maladministration of the law, could urge that he was taken by\r\nsurprise, and that he knew neither the character of the individual women,\r\nnor the force of the movement which was behind them. Mr. McKenna, who\r\nsucceeded Mr. Churchill, and has developed the policy of harshness with a\r\ncaprice and a partiality which has enormously increased its ill effects,\r\nmay plead his natural incompetence in explanation of all his blunders. Mr.\r\nChurchill has neither one excuse nor the other. He acted in cold-blood, and\r\nhe is too wise a man to be allowed to suggest that he did not know his\r\nduty. His was a deliberate refusal to grant to his political opponents the\r\nopportunity of obtaining a public endorsement of their complaints, and it\r\nwill always remain a blot upon the reputation of the Government. The memory\r\nof this affair, added to the passionate resentment provoked by forcible\r\nfeeding, now prevents all chance of reconciliation. The loss of the\r\nFranchise Bill of 1912, which no reasonable person believes to be the\r\nresult of deliberate dishonesty on the part of the Government, has only\r\ncompleted the process of satisfying the militant women that there is no\r\ngood faith to be found in Parliament. The Government should have given full\r\nfacilities to the Private Members' Bills of 1910 and 1911. When they had\r\nthe opportunity, they refused to disarm the hostile party by concession,\r\nand when they at last had the will, the opportunity was taken away. They\r\nwill now be faced by a conspiracy, involving danger, certainly to property,\r\nand probably to life, less extensive and less excusable, but no less\r\ndetermined than Irish Fenianism. They will suppress it with the approval of\r\nthe great majority of English men and women. But no acknowledgment of the\r\nmoral corruption which has now fallen upon the women will blind those who\r\nhave followed closely the varying fortunes of the Suffrage {362} movement\r\nto the fact that that moral corruption is largely due to the gross\r\nadministrative blunders of the Government and the levity and moral\r\ncowardice of Members of Parliament. Such clumsy folly in the management of\r\ndiscontent has not been displayed in England since 1832.[370]\r\n\r\nWhile the failure of the Liberal party in one important part of domestic\r\npolicy has thus been unquestionable and complete, it appears, so far as it\r\nis possible to get an accurate sight of events, that they have also failed\r\nin foreign policy. In India, the Liberalism of Lord Morley triumphed over\r\nofficial tradition. The admission of natives of India to a greater share in\r\ntheir own government was as much an expression of Liberalism as the\r\nreversal of Lord Curzon's partition of Bengal, a preference of the national\r\nidea over one of those mechanically efficient devices by which despotic\r\nGovernments continually increase their own difficulties. Outside India, the\r\nmanagement of external affairs has been less successful. The deportation of\r\nCole of Nairobi was an excellent example of the protection of native\r\npopulations against the arbitrary power of white colonists. But no effort\r\non the part of the British Government could guarantee the political rights\r\nof black men under the new South African Constitution, and this and the\r\nequally complete failure to secure freedom of movement and occupation for\r\ncoloured immigrants into the new Federation are disquieting evidence of the\r\nconflict between the two Imperial principles of self-government for white\r\nmen and full opportunities of development for black and brown. These\r\nfailures could hardly have been avoided. The general failure of foreign\r\npolicy, so far as it is possible to speak with certainty, is due largely,\r\nif not entirely, to our own fault.\r\n\r\n{363}\r\n\r\nThe writer has already indicated, in the first chapter of this book, how\r\nlittle he is disposed to lay down hard and fast rules for the conduct of\r\nforeign policy. It is conceivable, in his view, that facts may subsequently\r\nbe disclosed which will satisfy Liberals of another generation that Sir\r\nEdward Grey's abandonment of most of the principles of his Liberal\r\npredecessors has been forced upon him, and that the speeches, in which he\r\nhas appeared to repudiate them, have been the utterances of diplomacy\r\nrather than conviction.[371] Imperialism has not been a monopoly of Great\r\nBritain. Russia in China and Persia, Japan in China, Austria in Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, Italy in Tripoli, and France in Morocco, have in turn shown\r\ntheir willingness to upset the established rules of international morality\r\nin the pursuit of their own interests. In the almost universal\r\ndemoralization of foreign policy which has followed The Hague Peace\r\nConference of 1899, it has perhaps been impossible for a single statesman\r\nto tread a straight path. When Sir Edward Grey failed to persuade the\r\nPowers to take concerted action to prevent Austria's cynical appropriations\r\nof 1908, the fault was unquestionably not his.[372] The selfish aims of his\r\nassociates prevented him from attaining his own object. But other\r\ncircumstances suggest that he has not had the will to act liberally, even\r\nif he has had the opportunity. Before 1908 he had shown a personal\r\nincapacity, which had nothing to do with the machinations of competing\r\ndiplomatists. The public execution and flogging of the villagers of\r\nDenshawi in 1906, for an offence which barely amounted to manslaughter, and\r\nwas committed under extreme provocation, was more in the Russian than in\r\nthe English temper. Here the Foreign Secretary acted {364} under the\r\ndirection of Lord Cromer, and it is not impossible that in other cases he\r\nmay have surrendered himself to the hierarchy of the Foreign Office.[373]\r\nWhatever the cause, the desertion of Liberalism is clear. Even Lord\r\nLansdowne and the late Lord Salisbury, after the Boer War, gave up some of\r\nthe inheritance of Beaconsfield. They ceased to befriend Turkey, and in\r\n1903 Lord Lansdowne failed, through no fault of his own, to revive the\r\npolicy of concerted European pressure on the Turk. He, like Lord Salisbury,\r\ngenerally pursued a policy which tended towards internationalism, and away\r\nfrom egoism. But his successor twisted even his internationalism into\r\nweapons of offence. In 1904 Lord Lansdowne made an agreement with France by\r\nwhich the two contracting Powers settled all their outstanding disputes.\r\nThis was intended by its author to be only the first of a series of\r\ninternational agreements. It was converted by Sir Edward Grey into a weapon\r\nof offence against Germany, the country upon which, after passing from\r\nRussia to the United States, and from the United States to France, the\r\nanimosity of modern Toryism had definitely settled. The fortunes of Great\r\nBritain were bound up with those of France. The theory of the Balance of\r\nPower was revived, every diplomatic conference was made a conflict between\r\nFrance and Great Britain on the one side and Germany on the other, and in\r\n1911 the lives and the wealth of the British people were endangered, not to\r\nmaintain any moral principle or any British interest, but to promote the\r\nmaterial interests of French financiers in Morocco. To this diplomatic\r\nwarfare, and to the military warfare which it constantly contemplates, our\r\nwhole foreign policy is subdued. When Germany proposed at a Hague\r\nConference, that international agreement should abolish the system of\r\ndestroying private property at sea, Great Britain refused even to discuss\r\nthe point. When we fought Germany, our great fleet would be able to destroy\r\nher commerce. The right to destroy her commerce was our {365} most powerful\r\nweapon against her, and as our peace policy was determined by our war\r\npolicy, we preserved this relic of barbarism. The inevitable consequence of\r\nour diplomacy was to give German Jingoism an irresistible argument for the\r\nincrease of the German Fleet. The increase in the German Fleet was\r\ndescribed in threatening language by Mr. Churchill, and was matched by an\r\nincrease in our own. The burden of armaments increased, and unremunerative\r\nexpenditure drained the resources which should have been available for the\r\ncosts of social reform. Such was the foreign policy of Great Britain until\r\nthe outbreak of the Balkan War at the end of 1912. There may have been\r\ninformation in the possession of the Foreign Office which justified this\r\npersistent hostility towards Germany. That country may have been animated\r\nby some desire to destroy our commerce, or to appropriate our Colonies. So\r\nfar as we are allowed by our governors to learn any facts at all, there is\r\nno more than a shadow of a foundation for such an assumption. Up to the end\r\nof 1912 we were bound straight for a conflict, of the causes of which not\r\none Englishman in ten thousand knew anything definite, and not one in a\r\nthousand knew anything at all. All the Gladstonian principles, rightly or\r\nwrongly, had been forsaken. We made no serious attempt to establish the\r\ncomity of nations, we carefully distinguished between Germany and the rest\r\nof the world, and we entangled ourselves in engagements with France and\r\nRussia, which brought us no profit, and served only to increase the\r\nsuspicions of the German people. This violation of Liberal principle, which\r\nwas also a violation of the practice of the last Tory Foreign Secretary,\r\nmay have been inevitable. But its justification is not contained in\r\nanything that has yet been said or written on behalf of Sir Edward Grey,\r\nand those of us who held by the old rules during the Boer War can get only\r\na melancholy satisfaction out of a comparison of the failure of this\r\nImperialist Liberal in foreign affairs with the successes of his Pro-Boer\r\nassociates in South Africa, in India, and in Social Reform.[374]\r\n\r\n{366}\r\n\r\nThe departure from principle which has most disgusted the supporters of the\r\nGovernment is the alliance with Russia. This, like so many of our modern\r\nassociations, is cemented by finance, and the union of the two Governments\r\nhas been followed by a steady flow of British capital into Russian\r\nmunicipal and industrial securities. It is suggested that the object of\r\nboth the diplomatic and the financial support is the same, to restore the\r\ninfluence of Russia, seriously impaired by her humiliation at the hands of\r\nJapan and by her violent internal dissensions, in the councils of Europe.\r\nIn other words, we have strengthened the Russian Government as part of our\r\nscheme for keeping Germany in her place. This is one of those alliances\r\nwhich would have been repugnant to a Liberal of the old school. Russian\r\nGovernment and British Government are essentially different. The temper of\r\nnational independence, which is welcomed by English Liberals everywhere,\r\nand even by English Tories outside the boundaries of the Empire, is to the\r\ngoverning class of Russia what a heap of dirt is to a sanitary inspector.\r\nIt is a perpetual menace to what it is their business to protect, and they\r\ndevote to the extinction of some of the noblest of human aspirations the\r\nuntiring zeal with which better men apply themselves to the destruction of\r\nevil. No Government in the world has so persistently violated the rules of\r\nmorality in its dealings with its own subjects or with the foreign peoples\r\nwho lie without its boundaries. In five years of the {367} twentieth\r\ncentury it executed 3,750 persons, its courts of law sentenced 31,885\r\npolitical offenders to imprisonment or exile, and its administrative orders\r\ntransported 28,173 others without trial. More than 30,000 of its Jewish\r\nsubjects have been massacred in organized riots at which it has connived.\r\nIn these affairs it has had to deal with all sorts of persons. But it has\r\nexercised little discrimination in its treatment, and if some of its\r\nvictims have been the vilest of criminals, it has also caused thousands of\r\nhonourable men and women to be shot or bludgeoned, to be exiled, or to rot\r\nin crowded prisons. It has even employed agents to promote the\r\nassassination of its own associates, that it might have the better excuse\r\nfor taking violent measures to suppress peaceful agitation. It has now\r\ncrowned its career of domestic misgovernment by beginning to destroy the\r\nliberties of the Finnish people, whose social policy has been at once the\r\nadmiration of the civilized world, and a standing rebuke to the comparative\r\nbrutality of Russia. It is not the business of Great Britain to dictate to\r\nestablished Governments, or to go to war with them for the better\r\nregulation of their internal affairs. Nor is it the business of a British\r\nGovernment to refuse to make agreements with any foreign Government for the\r\nmanagement of matters in which they are jointly concerned. But it is the\r\nduty of a British Government not to corrupt its own people by involving\r\nitself intimately with a Government whose methods are not only different\r\nbut are utterly alien from its own. An alliance with France is bad only in\r\nso far as it is turned into a combination against Germany. An alliance with\r\nRussia is in itself unnatural and horrible.\r\n\r\nThe Persian Agreement of 1907 appears to have been twisted into such an\r\nalliance. Originally that Agreement, like the Moroccan Agreement with\r\nFrance, provided merely for the settlement of outstanding disputes in Asia,\r\nand as such it was welcomed by all Liberals. It has been converted into an\r\ninstrument for the destruction of the independence of Persia, which both\r\nPowers had solemnly declared it was their intention to maintain, and more\r\nrecently into a means of enabling Russia {368} to blackmail the struggling\r\nChinese Republic. The successive steps of Russian aggression cannot be\r\ndescribed here. In effect, the Northern Sphere, marked out by the Agreement\r\nsolely for the purposes of financial and commercial development, has been\r\nannexed politically to Russia, and occupation by her troops has been\r\nfollowed by outrages of almost indescribable brutality. The attempt of the\r\nPersian Government to restore the finances of the country, with the aid of\r\nthe American Mr. Morgan Shuster, was frustrated by Russian intervention,\r\nand for want of money the protection of trade routes, life, and private\r\nproperty has ceased in many districts. In each successive act of Russian\r\ninsolence, except the foul barbarities at Tabriz, Sir Edward Grey has\r\nacquiesced, and he actively assisted in the removal of Mr. Shuster. He has\r\napparently acted Liberally in only two matters, in his protest against the\r\noutrages which followed the Russian occupation, and in his refusal to\r\nparticipate in the guilt of a formal partition. But the national\r\nindependence of Persia to which the recent revolution seemed to give a new\r\njustification, has been practically destroyed, and the supposed limitations\r\non British freedom of action by war of protest are construed out of that\r\nAgreement, which professed to be based upon its preservation. The\r\nstrangling of Persia has not been such a plain affair of right and wrong as\r\nsome critics of Sir Edward Grey suggest. Generations of misgovernment had\r\ncorrupted the native system. Mr. Shuster gave provocation by his\r\nstraightforward independence where a more supple diplomatist might have\r\nsucceeded in managing even Russia. But he was the only hope of Persia, and\r\nif he could have been supported as Afghanistan has been supported, even\r\nRussia might have been forced to hold her hand.[375] Here again we are\r\nbrought up against our policy of isolating Germany. At all costs Russia was\r\nto be kept out of the orbit of German diplomacy. We acquiesced in Russian\r\nappropriations in Persia for the same reason that we supported French\r\nexploitations of Morocco. We were bound to make it to the {369} interest of\r\nour allies to prefer association with us to association with our enemy.\r\nWhere we might have defended a people against Russia on moral grounds, we\r\nsacrificed them for our diplomatic interests. Where we might have promoted\r\ninternational agreements for the disposition of uncivilized races, we were\r\ncompelled to resist them in the interest of the ally, with whom we had just\r\narranged a private deal. All came back to our settled policy of acting in\r\nopposition to Germany. There may be excuses, of which we have as yet no\r\nknowledge. But it is unquestionable that the present Government had lost\r\nthe habit of expressing Liberalism in foreign policy. Liberals had\r\ncertainly reason to regret it. Posterity alone will know whether or not\r\nthey had also reason to be ashamed.\r\n\r\nMore recent events have lightened the general gloom. The Persian disgrace\r\nremains, and the Russian penetration of Mongolia proceeds steadily. But\r\njust as the rising tide of French Jingoism seems to have found a President\r\nand a Premier who will float easily upon its surface, the Anglo-German feud\r\nhas begun to ebb. Apparently by no effort of our own, but simply through\r\nthe overwhelming pressure of our common interest in peace, the Balkan\r\ncrisis has united Great Britain, France, and Germany in preventing war\r\nbetween Austria and Russia. We have not lacked suggestions that we should\r\nmake war on Germany because Russia wished to prevent Austria from attacking\r\nServia. This would have been the climax of anti-Liberalism; to engage in\r\nwar because Servia wished to impose her will upon that of the Albanians,\r\nand because the allies with whom we were entangled decided to support\r\nher.[376] From this disgrace, and from the destruction of European\r\ncivilization which such a war would have involved, we have been preserved.\r\nThe reality of common interests and common aims has broken the fiction of\r\nthe Balance of Power into pieces, and Sir Edward Grey, whose career had\r\nbeen watched with dismay by the most Liberal of his followers, now finds\r\n{370} himself in universal favour as he expresses once more the pure theory\r\nof Liberalism. The Concert of Europe has been revived, with Great Britain\r\nat the head of it, and if the Foreign Secretary can make out of our\r\ntemporary association with Germany something in the nature of a permanent\r\nfriendship he will render a greater service to his country than any of his\r\npredecessors. The gross brutality of Denshawi in 1906 and the unexplained\r\nprovocation of Germany in 1911 will not be obliterated by a peaceful and\r\nhonourable issue out of our afflictions, and the Russian difficulty is only\r\nnow beginning. It is possible that there can be no such thing as a\r\npermanently Liberal Foreign Policy, that the systematic application of\r\nLiberal principles to foreign affairs can never be undertaken with any\r\nchance of success. No Liberal as yet will be content with that desperate\r\nassumption, and the recent improvement in the international situation\r\nrather confirms than weakens his belief that abroad, as at home, politics\r\nwill ultimately rest upon a basis of ethics. His chief hope is not in the\r\nchancelleries, but in the large and increasing body of international\r\nassociations of private persons. Unions for the purpose of promoting peace,\r\nand for the discussion of the unnational interests of women and of working\r\nmen, and periodical meetings of representatives of all nations to determine\r\nthe principles of commercial law, and even the rules of war, are steadily\r\nuniting the nations by \"organic filaments.\" For what the present Government\r\nhas apparently done in the way of preventing rather than encouraging union,\r\nLiberals are ready enough to find excuses. But until they are presented\r\nwith more facts than have yet been published by the Government itself, they\r\nwill continue to contemplate its foreign record with more regret than\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n{371}\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n  Aberdeen, Lord, 217\r\n  American Rebellion, 83;\r\n    effect of, on Liberalism, 86\r\n  American Civil War, 227, 263\r\n  Army Purchase, 241\r\n\r\n  Balance of Power, 18, 139, 364\r\n  Balfour, Arthur, 280 _n._, 297, 299, 302\r\n  Ballot, 107, 241\r\n  Beaconsfield, _see_ Disraeli\r\n  Bentham, Jeremy, 155\r\n  Bowring, Sir John, 221\r\n  Bradlaugh, Charles, 283\r\n  Bright, John, and Factory Acts, 176, 203;\r\n    moral ideals of, 194;\r\n    and American Civil War, 228;\r\n    and Reform, 219, 232;\r\n    on Ireland, 248, 249;\r\n    otherwise mentioned, 193, 195, 199, 223, 283\r\n  Brougham, Lord, on the franchise, 105;\r\n    on religious disabilities, 165;\r\n    on Trade Unions, 172;\r\n    otherwise mentioned, 176, 181\r\n  Burke, Edmund, and Ireland, 57;\r\n    on Catholic disabilities, 60;\r\n    on Unitarians, 62;\r\n    on the franchise, 62, 63;\r\n    on American Rebellion, 85, 86;\r\n    and Warren Hastings, 93;\r\n    and French Revolution, 97, 109, 115\r\n\r\n  Campbell-Bannerman, Sir Henry, 322, 324\r\n  Canada, affairs of, 182\r\n  Canning, George, on the franchise, 48;\r\n    and Catholic disabilities, 130;\r\n    and nationality, 140, 150\r\n  Carlyle, Thomas, and Socialism, 234\r\n  Cartwright, Major John, 79, 103, 104, 106, 108\r\n  Castlereagh, Lord, on the working class, 46;\r\n    on public meetings, 48;\r\n    on Dissenters, 52;\r\n    on women in politics, 54;\r\n    on French War, 133;\r\n    at Vienna, 139;\r\n    and Reform agitation, 145, 147\r\n  Catholics, political condition of, 50, 55;\r\n    emancipation of, 91, 127, 129, 161, 162\r\n  Chamberlain, Joseph, 33, 272, 279, 321\r\n  China, affairs of, 211, 221\r\n  Civil Service, reforms in, 241\r\n  Clarendon, Lord, 260\r\n  Cobden, Richard, on Empire, 40;\r\n    and Factory Acts, 176;\r\n    moral ideals of, 193;\r\n    on intervention, 195;\r\n    on social reform, 196;\r\n    and Palmerston, 213, 225;\r\n    on Ireland, 248;\r\n    otherwise mentioned, 199, 223\r\n  Collectivism, _see_ Social Reform.\r\n  Colonial System, the old, 55, 83;\r\n    the new, 182, 204;\r\n    and Imperialism, 33\r\n  Contagious Diseases Acts, 255\r\n  {372}\r\n  Co-operation, 231\r\n  Copenhagen, attack on, 135\r\n  Crimean War, 217\r\n  Criminal Law, 50;\r\n    reforms in, 154\r\n\r\n  Denmark, Palmerston and, 224\r\n  Disestablishment, 307\r\n  Disraeli (Beaconsfield), and the franchise, 232;\r\n    on Ireland, 248;\r\n    Turkish policy of, 266;\r\n    Afghan policy of, 270;\r\n    and Social Reform, 237;\r\n    and Imperialism, 313\r\n  Divorce Act, 220\r\n  Dorchester Labourers, 172\r\n  Durham, Lord, 166;\r\n    on Canada, 182\r\n\r\n  Education, 31;\r\n    condition of, 49, 241;\r\n    first public grant for, 179;\r\n    legislation concerning, 241, 280, 307, 322, 344\r\n  Egypt, affairs of, 290, 363\r\n  Empire, Liberal and Tory conceptions of, 32, 33\r\n  Evolution, theory of, and politics, 309;\r\n    and foreign policy, 313;\r\n    and social reform, 337\r\n\r\n  Factory Acts, 175\r\n  Fawcett, Henry, 265, 282, 285\r\n  Foreign policy, 15, 131, 187, 193, 209, 259, 266, 275, 313, 362\r\n    Fox, Charles James, Liberalism of, 66;\r\n    on Ireland, 56, 130, 131;\r\n    on Catholic disabilities, 61;\r\n    on Reform, 90, 105;\r\n    Libel Act of, 92;\r\n    on political discussion, 125;\r\n    on French War, 132;\r\n    on international morality, 134\r\n  Fox, W.

It is time, however, that the people were permitted to speak for\r\nthemselves, and in this book they have done so. From the South of England\r\nto the far North of Scotland men and women have sent in letters detailing\r\nthe actual hardships they have suffered through land monopoly. Included in\r\nthe volume are many letters and testimonies from people who understand by\r\nexperience how much more could be done with our land under happier laws,\r\nand thus contribute their ideas, not only on the nature of, but on the\r\nremedies for, a difficult problem. Mrs. Cobden Unwin writes a chapter\r\ndealing with the utterances of her father on the land question, and\r\nvindicating his insight into a problem which still awaits its solution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nT.

The author briefly and clearly\r\nexplains the economic forces that determine the share of wealth that can be\r\nclaimed by the various classes of the community, and argues that unless\r\nsome remedy can be found the growth of land-rents will increasingly\r\nimpoverish the people. He advocates legislative action along various lines,\r\nand particularly insists upon the rating and taxing of land value. This\r\nlatter policy is carefully analysed in all its bearings. The author shows\r\nwhat it will do, and what it cannot do, and by a fresh line of argument\r\nproves the necessity for other supplementary forms of taxation. The book\r\naffords a complete and balanced statement of the case that has to be met by\r\nany practical Land Policy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nT.

The book is not a political pamphlet--it is something\r\nmore.

He also deals with the phenomena of\r\nmental contagion, and with the part played by the lower elements of the\r\npopulace--the semi-criminal crowd--in times of revolution. A large part of\r\nthe book deals with the great French revolution, analysing it and applying\r\nto its problems the methods of the new psychology.

Lord Hugh Cecil's _Conservatism_ is tinged with Liberal ideas on\r\nFree Trade and Foreign Affairs. Mr. Pierse Loftus's _Conservative Party and\r\nthe Future_ is essentially Tory, but is rather suggestion for the future\r\nthan an expression of the present mind of Toryism. Mr. J. M. Kennedy's\r\n_Tory Democracy_ is the philosophy of Nietzsche masquerading in political\r\ndress, and bears no relation to practical politics, past, present, or\r\nfuture. Mr. Price Collier's _England and the English_ is the Toryism of an\r\nAmerican who has enjoyed the hospitality of the leisured class, and has\r\nread the _Times_ with some diligence. The cheap reprint is introduced by a\r\ncharacteristic eulogy from the pen of Lord Rosebery, who seems to have\r\nspent the last twenty-five years, if not in a castle in Spain, at least in\r\nan eighteenth-century nobleman's country house. Neither he nor Mr. Collier\r\nseems to have any knowledge of the industrial North. The _Standard_ has now\r\nopened its columns to a discussion of the principles and proposals of\r\nToryism, but I have not yet (December, 1912) detected much system in what\r\nhas been published. Various periodicals express various shades of Toryism,\r\nfrom the purity of Mr. W. S. Lilly, through the individualism of Mr. A.\r\nBaumann, to the Protectionist-Social Reform School of \"Curio.\"\r\n\r\n[11] But most of the Tory Suffragists stop at a narrow property franchise.\r\n\r\n[12] Mr. Lewis Harcourt at the Albert Hall, 28th February, 1911.\r\n\r\n[13] T.

The most startling\r\nfeature of this passage is its assumption that patriotism can be bought,\r\nand, indeed, cannot be made secure except by being bought. If it be true\r\nthat patriotism follows the cash, we are bound to the Argentine Republic\r\nand the United States by as close ties as to Canada, and if the present\r\nflow of British capital continues, our hearts will soon warm towards\r\nRussia. For the Liberal view of Empire, half a century old, see Gladstone's\r\nspeech (1855), quoted in Morley's _Life of Gladstone_, i. 363.\r\n\r\n[22] See, for example, leading articles in the _Morning Post_, 18th July,\r\n1912, and _Daily Telegraph_, 12th July, 1912.\r\n\r\n[23] Morley's _Burke_ (English Men of Letters), 136.\r\n\r\n[24] Cole shot a black man because he suspected him of stealing sheep.\r\nLewis shot another because his daughter said he had insulted her. Both acts\r\nwere done in cold blood, and with the approval of local whites. There was\r\nno suggestion in either case that the law was inadequate or could not have\r\nbeen enforced.\r\n\r\n[25] _Morning Post_, leading article, 14th May, 1912.\r\n\r\n[26] The grossest modern example of Tory Imperialism is Mr. Bonar Law's\r\nproposal, while claiming the right to close English markets to foreign\r\nmanufacturers, to keep those of India, whether Indians like it or not, open\r\nto English manufacturers. It is matched by his proposal that it should be\r\nleft to the Dominions to say whether or not our own food supplies should be\r\nfree or taxed.\r\n\r\n[27] The _Times_ recently spoke of \"insolence\" when a meeting of East\r\nLancashire manufacturers and Members of Parliament criticized Sir Edward\r\nGrey's policy in Persia. We may be wrong in the North. But we shall always\r\nthink for ourselves. The same journal has made a vicious attack upon the\r\nSupreme Court of India, because it interferes with the arbitrary acts of\r\nexecutive officers.\r\n\r\n[28] Moray's _Life of Cobden_, ii. 361. The _Review of Reviews_ furnished\r\nanother example of this vicious reaction when it urged (October, 1912) that\r\nEngland must not put pressure upon Turkey to reform its government of\r\nMacedonia, because such action would impair our authority over the Moslem\r\nof India. In other words, because of our Empire, we must connive at murder,\r\nrape, and every form of brigandage.\r\n\r\n[29] _Parliamentary History_, xxv. 472.\r\n\r\n[30] _Wilberforce Correspondence_, i. 219.\r\n\r\n[31] _Annual Register_, 1793, 113.\r\n\r\n[32] _Parl.

See Mr. Jethro Brown's\r\n_Underlying Principles of Modern Legislation_.\r\n\r\n[351] In a very remarkable article in the _Edinburgh Review_ for January,\r\n1912, an anonymous writer declares that the better sort of workmen are now\r\nnot merely politically, but actually, in character and ability, the\r\nsuperiors of the middle class. The shameless ignorance and hostility to\r\nideas, which he discovers in the latter, are due partly to the increase of\r\nluxury and partly to the public-school system. The reform of the latter,\r\nwhich is now in progress, is probably as urgent a need of the middle, as\r\nindustrial insurance is of the working class.\r\n\r\n[352] Herbert Samuel's _Liberalism_, 8, 11.\r\n\r\n[353] The Labour Exchange at Liverpool has actually decasualized the whole\r\nof the system of dock labour in that port. Credit for this is due to Mr.\r\nRowland Williams, of the Exchange, and Mr. Lawrence D. Holt, a local\r\nshipowner. The machinery established by the Act has done what private\r\neffort had for a generation found beyond its strength.\r\n\r\n[354] _Liberalism and the Social Problem_, 316. These speeches are by far\r\nthe best expression of the philosophy of the new Liberalism.\r\n\r\n[355] Churchill, _op. cit._, 82.\r\n\r\n[356] Mr. Harold Spender, in Mr. Philip Snowden's _Living Wage_, x.\r\n\r\n[357] It should be remembered that in the peculiar case of women Trade\r\nUnionism is almost impossible. Without the State, they have no means of\r\nraising their wages as men have raised theirs by combination.\r\n\r\n[358] _Social Statics_ (1851), 325.\r\n\r\n[359] A great proportion of this surplus wealth is spent on giving\r\nfictitious values to works of art and curiosities. A china jar which cost\r\nL500 fifty years ago may be bought for L5,000 to-day. The increase\r\nrepresents no real increase in value, but simply an increased capacity of\r\nmillionaires to bid against each other. The price will again fall, as\r\nincomes are reduced.\r\n\r\n[360] Accusations of moral corruption are most rarely made by those who are\r\nbest acquainted with political history. But what other term is to be\r\napplied to this action, of which I am informed on the best possible\r\nauthority? For several days before the day on which the Woman Suffrage\r\namendment was moved to the Franchise Bill, a Liberal Member, who had\r\nrefused to pledge himself to either side, was \"bombarded\" with requests\r\nfrom pledged Suffragist Members that he would vote against them and defeat\r\nthe amendment. We hang soldiers who commit this offence in military\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n[361] Sir Almroth Wright's notorious pamphlet has of course been repudiated\r\nby the saner women Anti-Suffragists. But it certainly represents the\r\nopinions of the average man Anti-Suffragist.\r\n\r\n[362] I cannot deal seriously with the argument that the vote is merely an\r\nexpression of physical force, that a minority only yields to a majority\r\nbecause it would be beaten in a civil war, that substantially all women\r\nmight vote on one side at an election and substantially all men on the\r\nother, that the women outnumber the men and would therefore be able to\r\nprocure the legislation which they wanted, that the men would refuse to\r\nobey the law, that civil war would follow, that the women would be beaten,\r\nand that society would be dissolved. Those politicians who believe in the\r\npossibility of such a succession of miracles had better retire each to a\r\nseparate desert island. They will not find in any society of human beings a\r\nconstitution which does not admit, on similarly logical grounds, of the\r\nsame dreadful disasters. Such an absurd and pedantic example of reasoning\r\naway from human nature has not been seriously maintained in England since\r\nthe time of Cartwright.\r\n\r\n[363] I use these terms as a convenient way of referring to the general\r\nmovements for and against emancipation. They may mean anything in\r\nthemselves. So far as I am concerned, I believe neither in that sexual\r\npromiscuity which some Anti-Suffragists charge against their opponents, nor\r\non the other hand in that theory of a primitive matriarchate upon which\r\nsome Suffragists base their claims.\r\n\r\n[364] For the history of the agitation see Mrs. Fawcett's _Women's\r\nSuffrage_ (\"The People's Books\" series); and for its philosophical basis,\r\nMrs. Olive Schreiner's _Women and Labour_, and my own _Emancipation of\r\nEnglish Women_.\r\n\r\n[365] I refer those who believe that the militant women were suffering from\r\nhysteria or other sexual disorder to the deliberate contradiction of Mr.\r\nH. L. Carre-Smith, in the _Standard_ of the 9th April, 1912. Mr. Smith is a\r\ncompetent physician, and an Anti-Suffragist, and he has made a careful\r\nstudy of the militant type. \"As a rule,\" he says, \"I have been struck by\r\ntheir normal demeanour.\"\r\n\r\n[366] The only Government department which acted wisely in dealing with the\r\nwomen was the Irish Office. The first offenders against the law in Dublin\r\nwere promptly placed in the first division. Unhappily, this was after Mr.\r\nMcKenna had revived forcible feeding, and too late to produce any effect.\r\nThe next Irish offences were attempts at arson and murder, committed by one\r\nof Mr. McKenna's prisoners. Had Mr. Birrell been at the Home Office in\r\n1906, we should still be far from arson and explosives.\r\n\r\n[367] I received a letter from a Cabinet Minister in 1909, in which he said\r\nthat he expected vitriol-throwing at any moment. Vitriol is, of course, the\r\nweapon of an outraged sex instinct, the injured wife or discarded mistress.\r\n\r\n[368] I refer my readers to the grave and responsible report of Sir Victor\r\nHorsley, Dr. Mansell Moulin, and Dr. Agnes Saville, three physicians of\r\nunquestioned competence and probity, which appeared in the _Lancet_ of the\r\n24th August, 1912.\r\n\r\n[369] One of the charges, that a large number of plain-clothes policemen\r\nhad mingled with the crowd for the purpose of attacking the women, was no\r\nmore a subject for investigation in a court of law than the subject of the\r\nParnell Commission. On this point Mr. Churchill denied the charges without\r\ninquiring of anybody but police officers, whose evidence, even if it was\r\nperfectly honest, was of little value. For a police officer to say that he\r\ndid not see a fact, one of a large number of facts, is not sufficient proof\r\nthat a private person is lying when he states that he did see it. Two\r\ngentlemen known to me say that they saw a large number (one says \"more than\r\na hundred\") of plain-clothes men march back into Scotland Yard after the\r\ndisturbance. Mr. Churchill says that there were \"not more than a dozen\" on\r\nduty. My informants may be lying or mistaken. But Mr. Churchill is not in a\r\nposition to say so, because he never attempted to cross-examine them. Both\r\nappear to me to be honest witnesses.\r\n\r\n[370] For a naive and illuminating statement of the militant women's case\r\nsee _The Suffragette_, by Sylvia Pankhurst; and for a fuller statement of\r\nmy own opinions, my _Emancipation of English Women_ (1913 edition). For the\r\ncase against Mr. Churchill see the pamphlet _Treatment of the Women's\r\nDeputations by the Metropolitan Police_ (The Woman's Press, 1911). See also\r\nmy pamphlet _Political Prisoners_ (National Political League, 1912). During\r\nthe London Dock strike of 1912 charges similar to those above mentioned\r\nwere made against the police. Mr. McKenna granted a public inquiry at once.\r\n\r\n[371] No Liberal questions Sir Edward Grey's honesty or good will. His\r\nrecord in connection with Woman's Suffrage, no bad touchstone, is\r\nconspicuously pure.\r\n\r\n[372] The action of Austria in establishing formal sovereignty over Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina was not such a gross violation of moral rules as it appears\r\nat first sight. Austria had been in occupation of these territories, with\r\nEuropean sanction, for more than a generation, and there is no question\r\nthat they had been well governed. It was only in taking advantage of the\r\nrevolution in Turkey, without obtaining the formal consent of the Powers,\r\nthat she acted immorally.\r\n\r\n[373] It should be remembered that the whole of the Foreign Service is\r\nrecruited from among people with minimum incomes of L400 a year. This\r\nensures a Tory bias among permanent officials.\r\n\r\n[374] There is great need of a history of foreign policy which shall trace\r\nin a satisfactory way the various currents which have brought us to our\r\npresent situation. For the present we have to rely on detached studies like\r\nMr. E. D. Morel's _Morocco in Diplomacy_, Mr. E. H. Perris's _Our Foreign\r\nPolicy and Sir Edward Grey's Failure_, Mr. J. A. Spender's pamphlet\r\nreprinted from the _Westminster Gazette_, Mr. Morgan Shuster's _Strangling\r\nof Persia_, Professor E. G. Browne's pamphlets on the same subject, and the\r\nHon. George Peel's _Friends of England_, _Enemies of England_, and _Future\r\nof England_. There is no general historical survey, and until there is,\r\nforeign policy will remain as much the monopoly of a caste as ancient legal\r\nsystems. It is time that this mysterification of such important affairs was\r\nended. At this moment (February, 1913), though the French Government has\r\npublished a huge Yellow Book on the Morocco crisis, Sir Edward Grey still\r\nrefuses to the English people any explanation of the reason why he nearly\r\nled them into war eighteen months ago.\r\n\r\n[375] An article in the _Times_ of the 15th March, 1913 seems to endorse\r\nall our Liberal protests and criticisms.\r\n\r\n[376] See, for example, the article by Mr. Sydney Brooks in the\r\n_Fortnightly Review_ for January, 1913. The suggestion was also made in a\r\nleading article in the _Daily Telegraph_, the date of which I forget.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges made against printed original.\r\n\r\nPage 10. \"The maintenance of rights is the condition of human progress\":\r\n'conditions' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 90. \"The Gordon Riots in June, 1780\": '1880' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 197. \"paid an artificially high price\": 'artifically' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 235. \"mass of mutually dependent individuals\": 'mutally' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 261. \"to which other Powers were parties\": 'others Powers' in\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nPage 290. \"not an adequate political substitute\": 'adeqate' in original.\r\n\r\nPage 308. \"protecting weak men against temptation\": 'tempation' in\r\noriginal.",
