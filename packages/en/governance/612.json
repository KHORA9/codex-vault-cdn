Government is a sacred trust\r\nof the people, the authority for which is derived from the\r\npeople, the powers of which are exercised by the representatives\r\nof the people, and the benefits of which are enjoyed by the\r\npeople. This is a universal principle of mankind upon which this\r\nConstitution is founded. We reject and revoke all constitutions,\r\nlaws, ordinances, and rescripts in conflict herewith.\r\n\r\n     We, the Japanese people, desire peace for all time and are\r\ndeeply conscious of the high ideals controlling human\r\nrelationship, and we have determined to preserve our security and\r\nexistence, trusting in the justice and faith of the peace-loving\r\npeoples of the world. We desire to occupy an honored place in an\r\ninternational society striving for the preservation of peace, and\r\nthe banishment of tyranny and slavery, oppression and intolerance\r\nfor all time from the earth. We recognize that all peoples of the\r\nworld have the right to live in peace, free from fear and want.\r\n\r\n     We believe that no nation is responsible to itself alone,\r\nbut that laws of political morality are universal; and that\r\nobedience to such laws is incumbent upon all nations who would\r\nsustain their own sovereignty and justify their sovereign\r\nrelationship with other nations.\r\n\r\n     We, the Japanese people, pledge our national honor to\r\naccomplish these high ideals and purposes with all our resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CHAPTER I.
