PUTNAM WEALE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis volume tells everything that the student or the casual reader\r\nneeds to know about the Chinese Question. It is sufficiently\r\nexhaustive to show very clearly the new forces at work, and to\r\nbring some realisation of the great gulf which separates the\r\nthinking classes of to-day from the men of a few years ago;\r\nwhilst, at the same time, it is sufficiently condensed not to\r\noverwhelm the reader with too great a multitude of facts.\r\n\r\nParticular attention may be devoted to an unique feature--namely,\r\nthe Chinese and Japanese documentation which affords a sharp\r\ncontrast between varying types of Eastern brains. Thus, in the\r\nMemorandum of the Black Dragon Society (Chapter VII) we have a\r\nvery clear and illuminating revelation of the Japanese political\r\nmind which has been trained to consider problems in the modern\r\nWestern way, but which remains saturated with theocratic ideals in\r\nthe sharpest conflict with the Twentieth Century. In the pamphlet\r\nof Yang Tu (Chapter VIII) which launched the ill-fated Monarchy\r\nScheme and contributed so largely to the dramatic death of Yuan\r\nShih-kai, we have an essentially Chinese mentality of the\r\nreactionary or corrupt type which expresses itself both on home\r\nand foreign issues in a naively dishonest way, helpful to future\r\ndiplomacy. In the Letter of Protest (Chapter X) against the\r\nrevival of Imperialism written by Liang Ch'i-chao--the most\r\nbrilliant scholar living--we have a Chinese of the New or Liberal\r\nChina, who in spite of a complete ignorance of foreign languages\r\nshows a marvellous grasp of political absolutes, and is a\r\nharbinger of the great days which must come again to Cathay. In\r\nother chapters dealing with the monarchist plot we see the\r\nofficial mind at work, the telegraphic despatches exchanged\r\nbetween Peking and the provinces being of the highest diplomatic\r\ninterest. These documents prove conclusively that although the\r\nJapanese is more practical than the Chinese--and more concise--\r\nthere can be no question as to which brain is the more fruitful.\r\n\r\nCoupled with this discussion there is much matter giving an\r\ninsight into the extraordinary and calamitous foreign ignorance\r\nabout present-day China, an ignorance which is just as marked\r\namong those resident in the country as among those who have never\r\nvisited it. The whole of the material grouped in this novel\r\nfashion should not fail to bring conviction that the Far East,\r\nwith its 500 millions of people, is destined to play an important\r\nrole in post-bellum history because of the new type of modern\r\nspirit which is being there evolved. The influence of the Chinese\r\nRepublic, in the opinion of the writer, cannot fail to be\r\nultimately world-wide in view of the practically unlimited\r\nresources in man-power which it disposes of.\r\n\r\nIn the Appendices will be found every document of importance for\r\nthe period of under examination,--1911 to 1917. The writer desires\r\nto record his indebtedness to the columns of The Peking Gazette, a\r\nnewspaper which under the brilliant editorship of Eugene Ch'en--a\r\npure Chinese born and educated under the British flag--has fought\r\nconsistently and victoriously for Liberalism and Justice and has\r\nmade the Republic a reality to countless thousands who otherwise\r\nwould have refused to believe in it.\r\n\r\nPUTNAM WEALE.

With the\r\nproclamation of the Republic, the fiction of autocratic rule had\r\ntruly enough vanished; yet the tradition survived and with it\r\nsufficient of the essential machinery of Imperialism to defeat the\r\nnominal victors until the death of Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\nThe movement to expel the Manchus, who had seized the Dragon\r\nThrone in 1644 from the expiring Ming Dynasty, was an old one.\r\nHistorians are silent on the subject of the various secret plots\r\nwhich were always being hatched to achieve that end, their silence\r\nbeing due to a lack of proper records and to the difficulty of\r\nestablishing the simple truth in a country where rumour reigns\r\nsupreme. But there is little doubt that the famous Ko-lao-hui, a\r\nSecret Society with its headquarters in the remote province of\r\nSzechuan, owed its origin to the last of the Ming adherents, who\r\nafter waging a desperate guerilla warfare from the date of their\r\nexpulsion from Peking, finally fell to the low level of inciting\r\nassassinations and general unrest in the vain hope that they might\r\nsome day regain their heritage. At least, we know one thing\r\ndefinitely: that the attempt on the life of the Emperor Chia Ching\r\nin the Peking streets at the beginning of the Nineteenth Century\r\nwas a Secret Society plot, and brought to an abrupt end the\r\npleasant habit of travelling among their subjects which the great\r\nManchu Emperors K'anghsi and Ch'ien Lung had inaugurated and\r\nalways pursued and which had so largely encouraged the growth of\r\npersonal loyalty to a foreign House.\r\n\r\nFrom that day onwards for over a century no Emperor ventured out\r\nfrom behind the frowning Walls of the Forbidden City save for\r\nbrief annual ceremonies such as the Worship of Heaven on the\r\noccasion of the Winter Solstice, and during the two \"flights\"--\r\nfirst, in 1860 when Peking was occupied by an Anglo-French\r\nexpedition and the Court incontinently sought sanctuary in the\r\nmountain Palaces of Jehol; and, again, in 1900, when with the\r\npricking of the Boxer bubble and the arrival of the International\r\nrelief armies, the Imperial Household was forced along the stony\r\nroad to faroff Hsianfu.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this immurement was soon visible; the Manchu rule,\r\nwhich was emphatically a rule of the sword, was rapidly so\r\nweakened that the emperors became no more than rois faineants at\r\nthe mercy of their ministers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: As there is a good deal of misunderstanding on the\r\nsubject of the Manchus an explanatory note is useful.\r\n\r\nThe Manchu people, who belong to the Mongol or Turanian Group,\r\nnumber at the maximum five million souls. Their distribution at\r\nthe time of the revolution of 1911 was roughly as follows: In and\r\naround Peking say two millions, in posts through China say one-\r\nhalf million,--or possibly three-quarters of a million; in\r\nManchuria Proper--the home of the race--say two or two and a half\r\nmillions. The fighting force was composed in this fashion: When\r\nPeking fell into their hands in 1644 as a result of a stratagem\r\ncombined with dissensions among the Chinese themselves, the entire\r\narmed strength was re-organized in Eight Banners or Army Corps,\r\neach corps being composed of three racial divisions, (1) pure\r\nManchus, (2) Mongols who had assisted in the conquest and (3)\r\nNothern Chinese who had gone over to the conquerors. These Eight\r\nBanners, each commanded by an \"iron-capped\" Prince, represented\r\nthe authority of the Throne and had their headquarters in Peking\r\nwith small garrisons throughout the provinces at various strategic\r\ncentres. These garrisons had entirely ceased to have any value\r\nbefore the 18th Century had closed and were therefore pure\r\nceremonial and symbolic, all the fighting being done by special\r\nChinese corps which were raised as neccessity arose.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the Nineteenth Century is thus logically enough the\r\nhistory of successive collapses. Not only did overseas foreigners\r\nopenly thunder at the gateways of the empire and force an ingress,\r\nbut native rebellions were constant and common. Leaving minor\r\ndisturbances out of account, there were during this period two\r\nhuge Mahommedan rebellions, besides the cataclysmic Taiping rising\r\nwhich lasted ten years and is supposed to have destroyed the\r\nunbelievable total of one hundred million persons. The empire,\r\ntorn by internecine warfare, surrendered many of its essential\r\nprerogatives to foreigners, and by accepting the principle of\r\nextraterritoriality prepared the road to ultimate collapse.\r\n\r\nHow in such circumstances was it possible to keep alive\r\nabsolutism? The answer is so curious that we must be explicit and\r\nexhaustive.\r\n\r\nThe simple truth is that save during the period of vigour\r\nimmediately following each foreign conquest (such as the Mongol\r\nconquest in the Thirteenth Century and the Manchu in the\r\nSeventeenth) not only has there never been any absolutism properly\r\nso-called in China, but that apart from the most meagre and\r\ninefficient tax-collecting and some rough-and-ready policing in\r\nand around the cities there has never been any true governing at\r\nall save what the people did for themselves or what they demanded\r\nof the officials as a protection against one another. Any one who\r\ndoubts these statements has no inkling of those facts which are\r\nthe crown as well as the foundation of the Chinese group-system,\r\nand which must be patiently studied in the village-life of the\r\ncountry to be fitly appreciated. To be quite frank, absolutism is\r\na myth coming down from the days of Kublai Khan when he so proudly\r\nbuilt his Khan-baligh (the Cambaluc of Marco Polo and the forebear\r\nof modern Peking) and filled it with his troops who so soon\r\nvanished like the snows of winter. An elaborate pretence, a\r\ndeliberate policy of make-believe, ever since those days invested\r\nImperial Edicts with a majesty which they have never really\r\npossessed, the effacement of the sovereign during the Nineteenth\r\nCentury contributing to the legend that there existed in the\r\ncapital a Grand and Fearful Panjandrum for whom no miracle was too\r\ngreat and to whom people and officials owed trembling obedience.\r\n\r\nIn reality, the office of emperor was never more than a politico-\r\nreligious concept, translated for the benefit of the masses into\r\nsocio-economic ordinances. These pronouncements, cast in the form\r\nof periodic homilies called Edicts, were the ritual of government;\r\ntheir purpose was instructional rather than mandatory; they were\r\ndesigned to teach and keep alive the State-theory that the Emperor\r\nwas the High Priest of the Nation and that obedience to the\r\nmorality of the Golden Age, which had been inculcated by all the\r\nphilosophers since Confucius and Mencius flourished twenty-five\r\ncenturies ago, would not only secure universal happiness but\r\ncontribute to national greatness.\r\n\r\nThe office of Emperor was thus heavenly rather than terrestrial,\r\nand suasion, not arms, was the most potent argument used in\r\neveryday life. The amazing reply (i.e., amazing to foreigners)\r\nmade by the great Emperor K'ang-hsi in the tremendous Eighteenth\r\nCentury controversy between the Jesuit and the Dominican\r\nmissionaries, which ruined the prospects of China's ever becoming\r\nRoman Catholic and which the Pope refused to accept--that the\r\ncustom of ancestor-worship was political and not religious--was\r\nabsolutely correct, POLITICS IN CHINA UNDER THE EMPIRE BEING ONLY\r\nA SYSTEM OF NATIONAL CONTROL EXERCISED BY INCULCATING OBEDIENCE TO\r\nFOREBEARS. The great efforts which the Manchus made from the end\r\nof the Sixteenth Century (when they were still a small Manchurian\r\nPrincipality striving for the succession to the Dragon Throne and\r\nlaunching desperate attacks on the Great Wall of China) to receive\r\nfrom the Dalai Lama, as well as from the lesser Pontiffs of Tibet\r\nand Mongolia, high-sounding religious titles, prove conclusively\r\nthat dignities other than mere possession of the Throne were held\r\nnecessary to give solidity to a reign which began in militarism\r\nand which would collapse as the Mongol rule had collapsed by a\r\nmere Palace revolution unless an effective MORAL title were\r\nsomehow won.\r\n\r\nNor was the Manchu military Conquest, even after they had entered\r\nPeking, so complete as has been represented by historians. The\r\nManchus were too small a handful, even with their Mongol and\r\nChinese auxiliaries, to do more than defeat the Ming armies and\r\nobtain the submission of the chief cities of China. It is well-\r\nknown to students of their administrative methods, that whilst\r\nthey reigned over China they RULED only in company with the\r\nChinese, the system in force being a dual control which, beginning\r\non the Grand Council and in the various great Boards and\r\nDepartments in the capital, proceeded as far as the provincial\r\nchief cities, but stopped short there so completely and absolutely\r\nthat the huge chains of villages and burgs had their historic\r\nautonomy virtually untouched and lived on as they had always\r\nlived. The elaborate system of examinations, with the splendid\r\nofficial honours reserved for successful students which was\r\nadopted by the Dynasty, not only conciliated Chinese society but\r\nprovided a vast body of men whose interest lay in maintaining the\r\nnew conquest; and thus Literature, which had always been the door\r\nto preferment, became not only one of the instruments of\r\ngovernment, but actually the advocate of an alien rule. With their\r\npersons and properties safe, and their women-folk protected by an\r\nelaborate set of capitulations from being requisitioned for the\r\nharems of the invaders, small wonder if the mass of Chinese\r\nwelcomed a firm administration after the frightful disorders which\r\nhad torn the country during the last days of the Mings. [Footnote:\r\nThis most interesting point--the immunity of Chinese women from\r\nforced marriage with Manchus--has been far too little noticed by\r\nhistorians though it throws a flood of light on the sociological\r\naspects of the Manchu conquest. Had that conquest been absolute it\r\nwould have been impossible for the Chinese people to have\r\nprotected their womenfolk in such a significant way.]\r\n\r\nIt was the foreigner, arriving in force in China after the capture\r\nof Peking and the ratification of the Tientsin Treaties in 1860,\r\nwho so greatly contributed to making the false idea of Manchu\r\nabsolutism current throughout the world; and in this work it was\r\nthe foreign diplomat, coming to the capital saturated with the\r\ntradition of European absolutism, who played a not unimportant\r\npart. Investing the Emperors with an authority with which they\r\nwere never really clothed save for ceremonial purposes\r\n(principally perhaps because the Court was entirely withdrawn from\r\nview and very insolent in its foreign intercourse) a conception of\r\nHigh Mightiness was spread abroad reminiscent of the awe in which\r\nEighteenth Century nabobs spoke of the Great Mogul of India.\r\nChinese officials, quickly discovering that their easiest means of\r\ndefence against an irresistible pressure was to take refuge behind\r\nthe august name of the sovereign, played their role so\r\nsuccessfully that until 1900 it was generally believed by\r\nEuropeans that no other form of government than a despotism sans\r\nphrase could be dreamed of. Finding that on the surface an\r\nImperial Decree enjoyed the majesty of an Ukaze of the Czar,\r\nEuropeans were ready enough to interpret as best suited their\r\nenterprises something which they entirely failed to construe in\r\nterms expressive of the negative nature of Chinese civilization;\r\nand so it happened that though the government of China had become\r\nno government at all from the moment that extraterritoriality\r\ndestroyed the theory of Imperial inviolability and infallibility,\r\nthe miracle of turning state negativism into an active governing\r\nelement continued to work after a fashion because of the disguise\r\nwhich the immense distances afforded.\r\n\r\nAdequately to explain the philosophy of distance in China, and\r\nwhat it has meant historically, would require a whole volume to\r\nitself; but it is sufficient for our purpose to indicate here\r\ncertain prime essentials. The old Chinese were so entrenched in\r\ntheir vastnesses that without the play of forces which were\r\nsupernatural to them, i.e., the steam-engine, the telegraph, the\r\narmoured war-vessel, etc., their daily lives could not be\r\naffected. Left to themselves, and assisted by their own methods,\r\nthey knew that blows struck across the immense roadless spaces\r\nwere so diminished in strength, by the time they reached the spot\r\naimed at, that they became a mere mockery of force; and, just\r\nbecause they were so valueless, paved the way to effective\r\ncompromises. Being adepts in the art which modern surgeons have\r\nadopted, of leaving wounds as far as possible to heal themselves,\r\nthey trusted to time and to nature to solve political differences\r\nwhich western countries boldly attacked on very different\r\nprinciples. Nor were they wrong in their view. From the capital to\r\nthe Yangtsze Valley (which is the heart of the country), is 800\r\nmiles, that is far more than the mileage between Paris and Berlin.\r\nFrom Peking to Canton is 1,400 miles along a hard and difficult\r\nroute; the journey to Yunnan by the Yangtsze river is upwards of\r\n2,000 miles, a distance greater than the greatest march ever\r\nundertaken by Napoleon. And when one speaks of the Outer\r\nDominions--Mongolia, Tibet, Turkestan--for these hundreds of\r\nmiles it is necessary to substitute thousands, and add there to\r\ndifficulties of terrain which would have disheartened even Roman\r\nGenerals.\r\n\r\nNow the old Chinese, accepting distance as the supreme thing, had\r\nmade it the starting-point as well as the end of their government.\r\nIn the perfected viceregal system which grew up under the Ming\r\nDynasty, and which was taken over by the Manchus as a sound and\r\nadmirable governing principle, though they superimposed their own\r\nmilitary system of Tartar Generals, we have the plan that\r\nnullified the great obstacle. Authority of every kind was\r\ndelegated by the Throne to various distant governing centuries in\r\na most complete and sweeping manner, each group of provinces,\r\nunited under a viceroy, being in everything but name so many\r\nindependent linked commonwealths, called upon for matricular\r\ncontributions in money and grain but otherwise left severely\r\nalone. [Footnote: A very interesting proof--and one that has never\r\nbeen properly exposed--of the astoundingly rationalistic\r\nprinciples on which the Chinese polity is founded is to be seen in\r\nthe position of priesthoods in China. Unlike every other\r\ncivilization in the world, at no stage of the development of the\r\nState has it been necessary for religion in China to intervene\r\nbetween the rulers and the ruled, saving the people from\r\noppression. In Europe without the supernatural barrier of the\r\nChurch, the position of the common people in the Middle Ages would\r\nhave been intolerable, and life, and virtue totally unprotected.\r\nBuckle, in his \"History of Civilization,\" like other extreme\r\nradicals, has failed to understand that established religions have\r\nparadoxically been most valuable because of their vast secular\r\npowers, exercised under the mask of spiritual authority. Without\r\nthis ghostly restraint rulers would have been so oppressive as to\r\nhave destroyed their peoples. The two greatest monuments to\r\nChinese civilization, then consist of these twin facts; first,\r\nthat the Chinese have never had the need for such supernatural\r\nrestraints exercised by a privileged body, and secondly, that they\r\nare absolutely without any feeling of class or caste--prince and\r\npauper meeting on terms of frank and humorous equality--the race\r\nthus being the only pure and untinctured democracy the world has\r\never known.] The chain which bound provincial China to the\r\nmetropolitan government was therefore in the last analysis finance\r\nand nothing but finance; and if the system broke down in 1911 it\r\nwas because financial reform--to discount the new forces of which\r\nthe steam engine was the symbol--had been attempted, like military\r\nreform, both too late and in the wrong way, and instead of\r\nstrengthening, had vastly weakened the authority of the Throne.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the reform-plan which became popular after the\r\nBoxer Settlement had allowed the court to return to Peking from\r\nHsianfu, the viceroys found their most essential prerogative,\r\nwhich was the control of the provincial purse, largely taken from\r\nthem and handed over to Financial Commissioners who were directly\r\nresponsible to the Peking Ministry of Finance, a Department which\r\nwas attempting to replace the loose system of matricular\r\ncontributions by the European system of a directly controlled\r\ntaxation every penny of which would be shown in an annual Budget.\r\nNo doubt had time been vouchsafed, and had European help been\r\nenlisted on a large scale, this change could ultimately have been\r\nmade successful. But it was precisely time which was lacking; and\r\nthe Manchus consequently paid the penalty which is always paid by\r\nthose who delay until it is too late. The old theories having been\r\nopenly abandoned, it needed only the promise of a Parliament\r\ncompletely to destroy the dignity of the Son of Heaven, and to\r\nleave the viceroys as mere hostages in the hands of rebels. A few\r\nshort weeks of rebellion was sufficient in 1911 to cause the\r\nprovinces to revert to their condition of the earlier centuries\r\nwhen they had been vast unfettered agricultural communities. And\r\nonce they had tasted the joys of this new independence, it was\r\nimpossible to conceive of their becoming \"obedient\" again.\r\n\r\nHere another word of explanation is necessary to show clearly the\r\nprecise meaning of regionalism in China.\r\n\r\nWhat had originally created each province was the chief city in\r\neach region, such cities necessarily being the walled repositories\r\nof all increment. Greedy of territory to enhance their wealth, and\r\njealous of their power, these provincial capitals throughout the\r\nages had left no stone unturned to extend their influence in every\r\npossible direction and bring under their economic control as much\r\nland as possible, a fact which is abundantly proved by the highly\r\ndiversified system of weights and measures throughout the land\r\ndeliberately drawn-up to serve as economic barriers. River-\r\ncourses, mountain-ranges, climate and soil, no doubt assisted in\r\ngoverning this expansion, but commercial and financial greed was\r\nthe principal force. Of this we have an exceedingly interesting\r\nand conclusive illustration in the struggle still proceeding\r\nbetween the three Manchurian provinces, Fengtien, Kirin and\r\nHeilungchiang, to seize the lion's share of the virgin land of\r\nEastern Inner Mongolia which has an \"open frontier\" of rolling\r\nprairies. Having the strongest provincial capital--Moukden--it\r\nhas been Fengtien province which has encroached on the Mongolian\r\ngrasslands to such an extent that its jurisdiction to-day envelops\r\nthe entire western flank of Kirin province (as can be seen in the\r\nlatest Chinese maps) in the form of a salamander, effectively\r\npreventing the latter province from controlling territory that\r\ngeographically belongs to it. In the same way in the land-\r\nsettlement which is still going on the Mongolian plateau\r\nimmediately above Peking, much of what should be Shansi territory\r\nhas been added to the metropolitan province of Chihli. Though\r\nadjustments of provincial boundaries have been summarily made in\r\ntimes past, in the main the considerations we have indicated have\r\nbeen the dominant factors in determining the area of each unit.\r\n\r\nNow in many provinces where settlement is age-old, the regionalism\r\nwhich results from great distances and bad communications has been\r\ngreatly increased by race-admixture. Canton province, which was\r\nlargely settled by Chinese adventurers sailing down the coast from\r\nthe Yangtsze and intermarrying with Annamese and the older\r\nautochthonous races, has a population-mass possessing very\r\ndistinct characteristics, which sharply conflict with Northern\r\ntraits. Fuhkien province is not only as diversified but speaks a\r\ndialect which is virtually a foreign language. And so on North and\r\nWest of the Yangtsze it is the same story, temperamental\r\ndifferences of the highest political importance being everywhere\r\nin evidence and leading to perpetual bickerings and jealousies.\r\nFor although Chinese civilization resembles in one great\r\nparticular the Mahommedan religion, in that it accepts without\r\nquestion all adherents irrespective of racial origin, POLITICALLY\r\nthe effect of this regionalism has been such that up to very\r\nrecent times the Central Government has been almost as much a\r\nforeign government in the eyes of many provinces as the government\r\nof Japan. Money alone formed the bond of union; so long as\r\nquestions of taxation were not involved, Peking was as far removed\r\nfrom daily life as the planet Mars.\r\n\r\nAs we are now able to see very clearly, fifty years ago--that is\r\nat the time of the Taiping Rebellion--the old power and spell of\r\nthe National Capital as a military centre had really vanished.\r\nThough in ancient days horsemen armed with bows and lances could\r\nsweep like a tornado over the land, levelling everything save the\r\nwalled cities, in the Nineteenth Century such methods had become\r\nimpossible. Mongolia and Manchuria had also ceased to be\r\ninexhaustible reservoirs of warlike men; the more adjacent\r\nportions had become commercialized; whilst the outer regions had\r\nsunk to depopulated graziers' lands. The Government, after the\r\ncollapse of the Rebellion, being greatly impoverished, had openly\r\nfallen to balancing province against province and personality\r\nagainst personality, hoping that by some means it would be able to\r\nregain its prestige and a portion of its former wealth. Taking\r\ndown the ledgers containing the lists of provincial contributions,\r\nthe mandarins of Peking completely revised every schedule,\r\nredistributed every weight, and saw to it that the matricular\r\nlevies should fall in such a way as to be crushing. The new\r\ntaxation, likin, which, like the income-tax in England, is in\r\norigin purely a war-tax, by gripping inter-provincial commerce by\r\nthe throat and rudely controlling it by the barrier-system, was\r\nsuddenly disclosed as a new and excellent way of making felt the\r\nmenaced sovereignty of the Manchus; and though the system was\r\nplainly a two-edged weapon, the first edge to cut was the Imperial\r\nedge; that is largely why for several decades after the Taipings\r\nChina was relatively quiet.\r\n\r\nTime was also giving birth to another important development--\r\nimportant in the sense that it was to prove finally decisive. It\r\nwould have been impossible for Peking, unless men of outstanding\r\ngenius had been living, to have foreseen that not only had the\r\nreal bases of government now become entirely economic control, but\r\nthat the very moment that control faltered the central government\r\nof China would openly and absolutely cease to be any government at\r\nall. Modern commercialism, already invading China at many points\r\nthrough the medium of the treaty-ports, was a force which in the\r\nlong run could not be denied. Every year that passed tended to\r\nemphasize the fact that modern conditions were cutting Peking more\r\nand more adrift from the real centres of power--the economic\r\ncentres which, with the single exception of Tientsin, lie from 800\r\nto 1,500 miles away. It was these centres that were developing\r\nrevolutionary ideas--i. e., ideas at variance with the Socio-\r\neconomic principles on which the old Chinese commonwealth had been\r\nslowly built up, and which foreign dynasties such as the Mongol\r\nand the Manchu had never touched. The Government of the post-\r\nTaiping period still imagined that by making their hands lie more\r\nheavily than ever on the people and by tightening the taxation\r\ncontrol--not by true creative work--they could rehabilitate\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt would take too long, and would weary the indulgence of the\r\nreader to establish in a conclusive manner this thesis which had\r\nlong been a subject of inquiry on the part of political students.\r\nChinese society, being essentially a society organized on a\r\ncredit-co-operative system, so nicely adjusted that money, either\r\ncoined or fiduciary, was not wanted save for the petty daily\r\npurchases of the people, any system which boldly clutched at the\r\nfinancial establishments undertaking the movement of sycee\r\n(silver) from province to province for the settlement of trade-\r\nbalances, was bound to be effective so long as those financial\r\nestablishments remained unshaken.\r\n\r\nThe best known establishments, united in the great group known as\r\nthe Shansi Bankers, being the government bankers, undertook not\r\nonly all the remittances of surpluses to Peking, but controlled by\r\nan intricate pass-book system the perquisites of almost every\r\noffice-holder in the empire. No sooner did an official, under the\r\nsystem which had grown up, receive a provincial appointment than\r\nthere hastened to him a confidential clerk of one of these\r\naccommodating houses, who in the name of his employers advanced\r\nall the sums necessary for the payment of the official's post, and\r\nthen proceeded with him to his province so that moiety by moiety,\r\nas taxation flowed in, advances could be paid off and the\r\nequilibrium re-established. A very intimate and far-reaching\r\nconnection thus existed between provincial money-interests and the\r\nofficial classes. The practical work of governing China was the\r\nbalancing of tax-books and native bankers' accounts. Even the\r\n\"melting-houses,\" where sycee was \"standardized\" for provincial\r\nuse, were the joint enterprises of officials and merchants;\r\nbargaining governing every transaction; and only when a violent\r\nbreak occurred in the machinery, owing to famine or rebellion, did\r\nany other force than money intervene.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing exceptional in these practices, in the use of\r\nwhich the old Chinese empire was merely following the precedent of\r\nthe Roman Empire. The vast polity that was formed before the time\r\nof Christ by the military and commercial expansion of Rome in the\r\nMediterranean Basin, and among the wild tribes of Northern Europe,\r\ndepended very largely on the genius of Italian financiers and tax-\r\ncollectors to whom the revenues were either directly \"farmed,\" or\r\nwho \"assisted\" precisely after the Chinese method in financing\r\nofficials and local administrations, and in replenishing a central\r\ntreasury which no wealth could satisfy. The Chinese phenomenon was\r\ntherefore in no sense new; the dearth of coined money and the\r\nvariety of local standards made the methods used economic\r\nnecessities. The system was not in itself a bad system: its fatal\r\nquality lay in its woodenness, its lack of adaptability, and in\r\nits growing weakness in the face of foreign competition which it\r\ncould never understand. Foreign competition--that was the enemy\r\ndestined to achieve an overwhelming triumph and dash to ruins a\r\nhoary survival.\r\n\r\nWar with Japan sounded the first trumpet-blast which should have\r\nbeen heeded. In the year 1894, being faced with the necessity of\r\nfinding immediately a large sum of specie for purpose of war, the\r\nnative bankers proclaimed their total inability to do so, and the\r\nfirst great foreign loan contract was signed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: (a) This loan was the so-called 7 per cent Silver loan\r\nof 1894 for Shanghai Taels 10,000,000 negotiated by the Hongkong &\r\nShanghai Bank. It was followed in 1895 by a 3,000,000 pounds Gold\r\n6 per cent Loan, then by two more 6 per cent loans for a million\r\neach in the same year, making a total of 6,635,000 pounds sterling\r\nfor the bare war-expenses. The Japanese war indemnity raised in\r\nthree successive issues--from 1895 to 1898--of 16,000,000 pounds\r\neach, added 48,000,000 pounds. Thus the Korean imbroglio cost\r\nChina nearly 55 millions sterling. As the purchasing power of the\r\nsovereign is eight times larger in China than in Europe, this debt\r\neconomically would mean 440 millions in England--say nearly double\r\nwhat the ruinous South African war cost. It is by such methods of\r\ncomparison that the vital nature of the economic factor in recent\r\nChinese history is made clear.]\r\n\r\nLittle attention was attracted to what is a turning-point in\r\nChinese history. There cannot be the slightest doubt that in 1894\r\nthe Manchus wrote the first sentences of an abdication which was\r\nonly formally pronounced in 1912: they had inaugurated the\r\nfinancial thraldom under which China still languishes. Within a\r\nperiod of forty months, in order to settle the disastrous Japanese\r\nwar, foreign loans amounting to nearly fifty-five million pounds\r\nwere completed. This indebtedness, amounting to nearly three times\r\nthe \"visible\" annual revenues of the country--that is, the\r\nrevenues actually accounted for to Peking--was unparalleled in\r\nChinese history. It was a gold indebtedness subject to all sorts\r\nof manipulations which no Chinese properly understood. It had\r\nspecial political meaning and special political consequences\r\nbecause the loans were virtually guaranteed by the Powers. It was\r\na long-drawn coup d'etat of a nature that all foreigners\r\nunderstood because it forged external chains.\r\n\r\nThe internal significance was even greater than the external. The\r\nloans were secured on the most important \"direct\" revenues\r\nreaching Peking--the Customs receipts, which were concerned with\r\nthe most vital function in the new economic life springing up, the\r\nsteam-borne coasting and river-trade as well as the purely\r\nforeign trade. That most vital function tended consequently to\r\nbecome more and more hall-marked as foreign; it no longer depended\r\nin any direct sense on Peking for protection. The hypothecation of\r\nthese revenues to foreigners for periods running into decades--\r\ncoupled with their administration by foreigners--was such a\r\ndistinct restriction of the rights of eminent domain as to amount\r\nto a partial abrogation of sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThat this was vaguely understood by the masses is now quite\r\ncertain. The Boxer movement of 1900, like the great proletarian\r\nrisings which occurred in Italy in the pre-Christian era as a\r\nresult of the impoverishment and moral disorder brought about by\r\nRoman misgovernment, was simply a socio-economic catastrophe\r\nexhibiting itself in an unexpected form. The dying Manchu dynasty,\r\nat last in open despair, turned the revolt, insanely enough,\r\nagainst the foreigner--that is against those who already held the\r\nreally vital portion of their sovereignty. So far from saving\r\nitself by this act, the dynasty wrote another sentence in its\r\ndeath-warrant. Economically the Manchus had been for years almost\r\nlost; the Boxer indemnities were the last straw. By more than\r\ndoubling the burden of foreign commitments, and by placing the\r\noperation of the indemnities directly in the hands of foreign\r\nbankers by the method of monthly quotas, payable in Shanghai, THE\r\nPEKING GOVERNMENT AS FAR BACK AS FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WAS REDUCED TO\r\nBEING A GOVERNMENT AT THIRTY DAYS' SIGHT, AT THE MERCY OF ANY\r\nSHOCK OF EVENTS WHICH COULD BE PROTRACTED OVER A FEW MONTHLY\r\nSETTLEMENTS. There is no denying this signal fact, which is\r\nprobably the most remarkable illustration of the restrictive power\r\nof money which has ever been afforded in the history of Asia.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon, however, was complex and we must be careful to\r\nunderstand its workings. A mercantile curiosity, to find the\r\nparallel for which we must go back to the Middle Ages in Europe,\r\nwhen \"free cities\" such as those of the Hanseatic League\r\nplentifully dotted river and coast line, served to increase the\r\ngeneral difficulties of a situation which no one formula could\r\nadequately cover. Extraterritoriality, by creating the \"treaty\r\nport\" in China, had been the most powerful weapon in undermining\r\nnative economics; yet at the same time it had been the agent for\r\ncreating powerful new counter-balancing interests. Though the\r\nincreasingly large groups of foreigners, residing under their own\r\nlaws, and building up, under their own specially protected system\r\nof international exchange, a new and imposing edifice, had made\r\nthe hovel-like nature of Chinese economics glaringly evident, the\r\nmercantile classes of the New China, being always quick to avail\r\nthemselves of money-making devices, had not only taken shelter\r\nunder this new and imposing edifice, but were rapidly extending it\r\nof their own accord. In brief, the trading Chinese were\r\nidentifying themselves and their major interests with the treaty-\r\nports; they were transferring thither their specie and their\r\ncredits; making huge investments in land and properties, under the\r\naegis of foreign flags in which they absolutely trusted. The\r\nmoney-interests of the country knew instinctively that the native\r\nsystem was doomed and that with this doom there would come many\r\nchanges; these interests, in the way common to money all the world\r\nover, were insuring themselves against the inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe force of this--politically--became finally evident in 1911;\r\nand what we have said in our opening sentences should now be\r\nclear. The Chinese Revolution was an emotional rising against the\r\nPeking System because it was a bad and inefficient and retrograde\r\nsystem, just as much as against the Manchus, who after all had\r\nadopted purely Chinese methods and who were no more foreigners\r\nthan Scotchmen or Irishmen are foreigners to-day in England. The\r\nRevolution of 1911 derived its meaning and its value--as well as\r\nits mandate--not from what it proclaimed, but for what it stood\r\nfor. Historically, 1911 was the lineal descendant of 1900, which\r\nagain was the offspring of the economic collapse advertised by the\r\ngreat foreign loans of the Japanese war, loans made necessary\r\nbecause the Taipings had disclosed the complete disappearance of\r\nthe only raison d'etre of Peking sovereignty, i.e. the old-time\r\nmilitary power. The story is, therefore, clear and well-connected\r\nand so logical in its results that it has about it a finality\r\nsuggesting the unrolling of the inevitable.\r\n\r\nDuring the Revolution the one decisive factor was shown to be\r\nalmost at once--money, nothing but money. The pinch was felt at\r\nthe end of the first thirty days. Provincial remittances ceased;\r\nthe Boxer quotas remained unpaid; a foreign embargo was laid upon\r\nthe Customs funds. The Northern troops, raised and trained by Yuan\r\nShih-kai, when he was Viceroy of the Metropolitan province, were,\r\nit is true, proving themselves the masters of the Yangtsze and\r\nSouth China troops; yet that circumstance was meaningless. Those\r\ntroops were fighting for what had already proved itself a lost\r\ncause--the Peking System as well as the Manchu dynasty. The fight\r\nturned more and more into a money-fight. It was foreign money\r\nwhich brought about the first truce and the transfer of the so-\r\ncalled republican government from Nanking to Peking. In the\r\nstrictest sense of the words every phase of the settlement then\r\narrived at was a settlement in terms of cash.[Footnote: There is\r\nno doubt that the so-called Belgian loan, 1,800,000 pounds of\r\nwhich was paid over in cash at the beginning of 1912, was the\r\ninstrument which brought every one to terms.]\r\n\r\nHad means existed for rapidly replenishing the Chinese Treasury\r\nwithout having recourse to European stockmarkets (whose actions\r\nare semi-officially controlled when distant regions are involved)\r\nthe Republic might have fared better. But placed almost at once\r\nthrough foreign dictation under a species of police-control,\r\nwhich while nominally derived from Western conceptions, was\r\nprimarily designed to rehabilitate the semblance of the authority\r\nwhich had been so sensationally extinguished, the Republic\r\nremained only a dream; and the world, taught to believe that there\r\ncould be no real stability until the scheme of government\r\napproximated to the conception long formed of Peking absolutism,\r\nwaited patiently for the rude awakening which came with the Yuan\r\nShih-kai coup d'etat of 4th November, 1913. Thus we had this\r\ndouble paradox; on the one hand the Chinese people awkwardly\r\ntrying to be western in a Chinese way and failing: on the other,\r\nforeign officials and foreign governments trying to be Chinese and\r\nmaking the confusion worse confounded. It was inevitable in such\r\ncircumstances that the history of the past six years should have\r\nbeen the history of a slow tragedy, and that almost every page\r\nshould be written over with the name of the man who was the\r\nselected bailiff of the Powers--Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE ENIGMA OF YUAN SHIH-KAI\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF THE MAN FROM THE OPENING OF HIS CAREER IN KOREA, IN\r\n1882 TO THE END OF THE REVOLUTION, 12TH FEBRUARY, 1912\r\n\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai's career falls into two clear-cut parts, almost as\r\nif it had been specially arranged for the biographer; there is the\r\nprobationary period in Korea, and the executive in North China.\r\nThe first is important only because of the moulding-power which\r\nearly influences exerted on the man's character; but it is\r\ninteresting in another way since it affords glimpses of the sort\r\nof things which affected this leader's imagination throughout his\r\nlife and finally brought him to irretrievable ruin. The second\r\nperiod is choke-full of action; and over every chapter one can see\r\nthe ominous point of interrogation which was finally answered in\r\nhis tragic political and physical collapse.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai's origin, without being precisely obscure, is\r\nunimportant. He came of a Honanese family who were nothing more\r\ndistinguished than farmers possessing a certain amount of land,\r\nbut not too much of the world's possessions. The boy probably ran\r\nwild in the field at an age when the sons of high officials and\r\nliterati were already pale and anaemic from overmuch study. To\r\nsome such cause the man undoubtedly owed his powerful physique,\r\nhis remarkable appetite, his general roughness. Native biographers\r\nstate that as a youth he failed to pass his hsiu-tsai\r\nexaminations--the lowest civil service degree--because he had\r\nspent too much time in riding and boxing and fencing. An uncle in\r\nofficial life early took charge of him; and when this relative\r\ndied the young man displayed filial piety in accompanying the\r\ncorpse back to the family graves and in otherwise manifesting\r\ngrief. Through official connections a place was subsequently found\r\nfor him in that public department under the Manchus which may be\r\ncalled the military intendancy, and it was through this branch of\r\nthe civil service that he rose to power. Properly speaking Yuan\r\nShih-kai was never an army-officer; he was a military official--\r\nhis highest rank later on being that of military judge, or better,\r\nJudicial Commissioner.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai first emerges into public view in 1882 when, as a\r\nsequel to the opening of Korea through the action of foreign\r\nPowers in forcing the then Hermit kingdom to sign commercial\r\ntreaties, China began dispatching troops to Seoul. Yuan Shih-kai,\r\nwith two other officers, commanding in all some 3,000 men, arrived\r\nfrom Shantung, where he had been in the train of a certain General\r\nWu Chang-ching, and now encamped in the Korean capital nominally\r\nto preserve order, but in reality, to enforce the claims of the\r\nsuzerain power. For the Peking Government had never retreated from\r\nthe position that Korea had been a vassal state ever since the\r\nMing Dynasty had saved the country from the clutches of Hideyoshi\r\nand his Japanese invaders in the Sixteenth Century. Yuan Shih-kai\r\nhad been personally recommended by this General Wu Chang-ching as\r\na young man of ability and energy to the famous Li Hung Chang, who\r\nas Tientsin Viceroy and High Commissioner for the Northern Seas\r\nwas responsible for the conduct of Korean affairs. The future\r\ndictator of China was then only twenty-five years old.\r\n\r\nHis very first contact with practical politics gave him a peculiar\r\nmanner of viewing political problems. The arrival of Chinese\r\ntroops in Seoul marked the beginning of that acute rivalry with\r\nJapan which finally culminated in the short and disastrous war of\r\n1894-95. China, in order to preserve her influence in Korea\r\nagainst the growing influence of Japan, intrigued night and day in\r\nthe Seoul Palaces, allying herself with the Conservative Court\r\nparty which was led by the notorious Korean Queen who was\r\nafterwards assassinated. The Chinese agents aided and abetted the\r\nreactionary group, constantly inciting them to attack the Japanese\r\nand drive them out of the country.\r\n\r\nContinual outrages were the consequence. The Japanese legation was\r\nattacked and destroyed by the Korean mob not once but on several\r\noccasions during a decade which furnishes one of the most amazing\r\nchapters in the history of Asia. Yuan Shih-kai, being then merely\r\na junior general officer under the orders of the Chinese Imperial\r\nResident, is of no particular importance; but it is significant of\r\nthe man that he should suddenly come well under the limelight on\r\nthe first possible occasion. On 6th December, 1884, leading 2,000\r\nChinese troops, and acting in concert with 3,000 Korean soldiers,\r\nhe attacked the Tong Kwan Palace in which the Japanese Minister\r\nand his staff, protected by two companies of Japanese infantry,\r\nhad taken refuge owing to the threatening state of affairs in the\r\ncapital. Apparently there was no particular plan--it was the\r\naction of a mob of soldiery tumbling into a political brawl and\r\nassisted by their officers for reasons which appear to-day\r\nnonsensical. The sequel was, however, extraordinary. The Japanese\r\nheld the Palace gates as long as possible, and then being\r\ndesperate exploded a mine which killed numbers of Koreans and\r\nChinese soldiery and threw the attack into confusion. They then\r\nfought their way out of the city escaping ultimately to the\r\nnearest sea-port, Chemulpo.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this extraordinary episode has never been made\r\npublic. The practical result was that after a period of extreme\r\ntension between China and Japan which was expected to lead to war,\r\nthat political genius, the late Prince Ito, managed to calm things\r\ndown and arrange workable modus vivendi. Yuan Shih-kai, who had\r\ngone to Tientsin to report in person to Li Hung Chang, returned to\r\nSeoul triumphantly in October, 1885, as Imperial Resident. He was\r\nthen twenty-eight years old; he had come to the front, no matter\r\nby what means, in a quite remarkable manner.\r\n\r\nThe history of the next nine years furnishes plenty of minor\r\nincidents, but nothing of historic importance. As the faithful\r\nlieutenant of Li Hung Chang, Yuan Shih-kai's particular business\r\nwas simply to combat Japanese influence and hold the threatened\r\nadvance in check. He failed, of course, since he was playing a\r\nlosing game; and yet he succeeded where he undoubtedly wished to\r\nsucceed. By rendering faithful service he established the\r\nreputation he wished to win; and though he did nothing great he\r\nretained his post right up to the act which led to the declaration\r\nof war in 1894. Whether he actually precipitated that war is still\r\na matter of opinion. On the sinking by the Japanese fleet of the\r\nBritish steamer Kowshing, which was carrying Chinese\r\nreinforcements from Taku anchorage to Asan Bay to his assistance,\r\nseeing that the game was up, he quietly left the Korean capital\r\nand made his way overland to North China. That swift, silent\r\njourney home ends the period of his novitiate.\r\n\r\nIt took him a certain period to weather the storm which the utter\r\ncollapse of China in her armed encounter with Japan brought about\r\n--and particularly to obtain forgiveness for evacuating Seoul\r\nwithout orders. Technically his offence was punishable by death--\r\nthe old Chinese code being most stringent in such matters. But by\r\n1896 he was back in favour again, and through the influence of his\r\npatron Li Hung Chang, he was at length appointed in command of the\r\nHsiaochan camp near Tientsin, where he was promoted and given the\r\ntask of reforming a division of old-style troops and making them\r\nas efficient as Japanese soldiery. He had already earned a wide\r\nreputation for severity, for willingness to accept responsibility,\r\nfor nepotism, and for a rare ability to turn even disasters to his\r\nown advantage--all attributes which up to the last moment stood\r\nhim in good stead.\r\n\r\nIn the Hsiaochan camp the most important chapter of his life\r\nopens; there is every indication that he fully realized it.\r\nTientsin has always been the gateway to Peking: from there the\r\nroad to high preferment is easily reached. Yuan Shih-kai marched\r\nsteadily forward, taking the very first turning-point in a manner\r\nwhich stamped him for many of his compatriots in a way which can\r\nnever be obliterated.\r\n\r\nIt is first necessary to say a word about the troops of his\r\ncommand, since this has a bearing on present-day politics. The\r\nbulk of the soldiery were so-called Huai Chun--i.e., nominally\r\ntroops from the Huai districts, just south of Li Hung Chang's\r\nnative province Anhui. These Kiangu men, mixed with Shantung\r\nrecruits, had earned a historic place in the favour of the Manchus\r\nowing to the part they had played in the suppression of the\r\nTaiping Rebellion, in which great event General Gordon and Li Hung\r\nChang had been so closely associated. They and the troops of Hunan\r\nprovince, led by the celebrated Marquis Tseng Kuo-fan, were \"the\r\nloyal troops,\" resembling the Sikhs during the Indian Mutiny; they\r\nwere supposed to be true to their salt to the last man. Certainly\r\nthey gave proofs of uncustomary fidelity.\r\n\r\nIn those military days of twenty years ago Yuan Shih-kai and his\r\nhenchmen were, however, concerned with simpler problems. It was\r\nthen a question of drill and nothing but drill. In his camp near\r\nTientsin the future President of the Chinese Republic succeeded in\r\nreorganizing his troops so well that in a very short time the\r\nHsiaochan Division became known as a corps d'elite. The discipline\r\nwas so stern that there were said to be only two ways of noticing\r\nsubordinates, either by promoting or beheading them. Devoting\r\nhimself to his task Yuan Shih-kai gave promise of being able to\r\nhandle much bigger problems.\r\n\r\nHis zeal soon attracted the attention of the Manchu Court. The\r\ncircumstances in Peking at that time were peculiar. The famous old\r\nEmpress Dowager, Tzu-Hsi, after the Japanese war, had greatly\r\nrelaxed her hold on the Emperor Kwanghsu, who though still in\r\nsubjection to her, nominally governed the empire. A well-\r\nintentioned but weak man, he had surrounded himself with advanced\r\nscholars, led by the celebrated Kang Yu Wei, who daily studied\r\nwith him and filled him with new doctrines, teaching him to\r\nbelieve that if he would only exert his power he might rescue the\r\nnation from international ignominy and make for himself an\r\nimperishable name.\r\n\r\nThe sequel was inevitable. In 1898 the oriental world was\r\nelectrified by the so-called Reform Edicts, in which the Emperor\r\nundertook to modernize China, and in which he exhorted the nation\r\nto obey him. The greatest alarm was created in Court circles by\r\nthis action; the whole vast body of Metropolitan officialdom,\r\nseeing its future threatened, flooded the Palace of the Empress\r\nDowager with Secret Memorials praying her to resume power.\r\nFlattered, she gave her secret assent.\r\n\r\nThings marched quickly after that. The Empress, nothing loth,\r\nbegan making certain dispositions. Troops were moved, men were\r\nshifted here and there in a way that presaged action; and the\r\nEmperor, now thoroughly alarmed and yielding to the entreaties of\r\nhis followers, sent two members of the Reform Party to Yuan Shih-\r\nkai bearing an alleged autograph order for him to advance\r\ninstantly on Peking with all his troops; to surround the Palace,\r\nto secure the person of the Emperor from all danger, and then to\r\ndepose the Empress Dowager for ever from power. What happened is\r\nequally well-known. Yuan Shih-kai, after an exhaustive examination\r\nof the message and messengers, as well as other attempts to\r\nsubstantiate the genuineness of the appeal, communicated its\r\nnature to the then Viceroy of Chihli, the Imperial Clansman Jung\r\nLu, whose intimacy with the Empress Dowager since the days of her\r\nyouth has passed into history. Jung Lu lost no time in acting. He\r\nbeheaded the two messengers and personally reported the whole plot\r\nto the Empress Dowager who was already fully warned. The result\r\nwas the so-called coup d'etat of September, 1898, when all the\r\nReformers who had not fled were summarily executed, and the\r\nEmperor Kwanghsu himself closely imprisoned in the Island Palace\r\nwithin that portion of the Forbidden City known as the Three\r\nLakes, having (until the Boxer outbreak of 1900 carried him to\r\nHsianfu), as sole companions his two favourites, the celebrated\r\nodalisques \"Pearl\" and \"Lustre.\"\r\n\r\nThis is no place to enter into the controversial aspect of Yuan\r\nShih-kai's action in 1898 which has been hotly debated by\r\npartisans for many years. For onlookers the verdict must always\r\nremain largely a matter of opinion; certainly this is one of those\r\nmatters which cannot be passed upon by any one but a Chinese\r\ntribunal furnished with all the evidence. Those days which\r\nwitnessed the imprisonment of Kwang Hsu were great because they\r\nopened wide the portals of the Romance of History: all who were in\r\nPeking can never forget the counter-stroke; the arrival of the\r\nhordes composed of Tung Fu-hsiang's Mahommedan cavalry--men who\r\nhad ridden hard across a formidable piece of Asia at the behest of\r\ntheir Empress and who entered the capital in great clouds of dust.\r\nIt was in that year of 1898 also that Legation Guards reappeared\r\nin Peking--a few files for each Legation as in 1860--and it was\r\nthen that clear-sighted prophets saw the beginning of the end of\r\nthe Manchu Dynasty.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai's reward for his share in this counter-revolution\r\nwas his appointment to the governorship of Shantung province. He\r\nmoved thither with all his troops in December, 1899. Armed cap-a-\r\npie he was ready for the next act--the Boxers, who burst on China\r\nin the Summer of 1900. These men were already at work in Shantung\r\nvillages with their incantations and alleged witchcraft. There is\r\nevidence that their propaganda had been going on for months, if\r\nnot for years, before any one had heard of it. Yuan Shih-kai had\r\nthe priceless opportunity of studying them at close range and soon\r\nmade up his mind about certain things. When the storm burst,\r\npretending to see nothing but mad fanatics in those who, realizing\r\nthe plight of their country, had adopted the war-cry \"Blot out the\r\nManchus and the foreigner,\" he struck at them fiercely, driving\r\nthe whole savage horde headlong into the metropolitan province of\r\nChihli. There, seduced by the Manchus, they suddenly changed the\r\ninscription on their flags. Their sole enemy became the foreigner\r\nand all his works, and forthwith they were officially protected.\r\nFar and wide they killed every white face they could find. They\r\ntore up railways, burnt churches and chapels and produced a\r\ngeneral anarchy which could only have one end--European\r\nintervention. The man, sitting on the edge of Chinese history but\r\nnot yet identifying himself with its main currents because he was\r\nnot strong enough for that, had once again not judged wrongly.\r\nWith his Korean experience to assist him, he had seen precisely\r\nwhat the end must inevitably be.\r\n\r\nThe crash in Peking, when the siege of the Legations had been\r\nraised by an international army, found him alert and sympathetic--\r\nready with advice, ready to shoulder new responsibilities, ready\r\nto explain away everything. The signature of the Peace Protocol of\r\n1901 was signalized, by his obtaining the viceroyalty of Chihli,\r\nsucceeding the great Li Hung Chang himself, who had been\r\nreappointed to his old post, but had found active duties too\r\nwearisome. This was a marvellous success for a man but little over\r\nforty. And when the fugitive Court at length returned from Hsianfu\r\nin 1902, honours were heaped upon him as a person particularly\r\nworthy of honour because he had kept up appearances and maintained\r\nthe authority of the distressed Throne. As if in answer to this he\r\nflooded the Court with memorials praying that in order to restore\r\nthe power of the Dynasty a complete army of modern troops be\r\nraised--as numerous as possible but above all efficient.\r\n\r\nHis advice was listened to. From 1902 until 1907 as Minister of\r\nthe Army Reorganization Council--a special post he held\r\nsimultaneously with that of metropolitan Viceroy--Yuan Shih-kai's\r\ngreat effort was concentrated on raising an efficient fighting\r\nforce. In those five years, despite all financial embarrassments,\r\nNorth China raised and equipped six excellent Divisions of field-\r\ntroops--75,000 men--all looking to Yuan Shih-kai as their sole\r\nmaster. So much energy did he display in pushing military\r\nreorganization throughout the provinces that the Court, warned by\r\njealous rivals of his growing power, suddenly promoted him to a\r\npost where he would be powerless. One day he was brought to Peking\r\nas Grand Councillor and President of the Board of Foreign Affairs,\r\nand ordered to hand over all army matters to his noted rival, the\r\nManchu Tieh Liang. The time had arrived to muzzle him. His last\r\nphase as a pawn had come.\r\n\r\nFew foreign diplomats calling at China's Foreign Office to discuss\r\nmatters during that short period which lasted barely a twelve-\r\nmonth, imagined that the square resolute-looking man who as\r\nPresident of the Board gave the same energy and attention to\r\nconsular squabbles as to the reorganization of a national fighting\r\nforce, was almost daily engaged in a fierce clandestine struggle\r\nto maintain even his modest position. Jealousy, which flourishes\r\nin Peking like the upas tree, was for ever blighting his schemes\r\nand blocking his plans. He had been brought to Peking to be tied\r\nup; he was constantly being denounced; and even his all powerful\r\npatroness, the old Empress Dowager, who owed so much to him,\r\nsuffered from constant premonitions that the end was fast\r\napproaching, and that with her the Dynasty would die.\r\n\r\nIn the Autumn of 1908 she took sick. The gravest fears quickly\r\nspread. It was immediately reported that the Emperor Kwanghsu was\r\nalso very ill--an ominous coincidence. Very suddenly both\r\npersonages collapsed and died, the Empress Dowager slightly before\r\nthe Emperor. There is little doubt that the Emperor himself was\r\npoisoned. The legend runs that as he expired not only did he give\r\nhis Consort, who was to succeed him in the exercise of the nominal\r\npower of the Throne, a last secret Edict to behead Yuan Shih-kai,\r\nbut that his faltering hand described circle after circle in the\r\nair until his followers understood the meaning. In the vernacular\r\nthe name of the great viceroy and the word for circle have the\r\nsame sound; the gesture signified that the dying monarch's last\r\nwish was revenge on the man who had failed him ten years before.\r\n\r\nAn ominous calm followed this great break with the past. It was\r\nunderstood that the Court was torn by two violent factions\r\nregarding the succession which the Empress Tzu-hsi had herself\r\ndecided. The fact that another long Regency had become inevitable\r\nthrough the accession of the child Hsuan Tung aroused instant\r\napprehensions among foreign observers, whilst it was confidently\r\npredicted that Yuan Shih-kai's last days had come.\r\n\r\nThe blow fell suddenly on the 2nd January, 1909. In the interval\r\nbetween the death of the old Empress and his disgrace, Yuan Shih-\r\nkai was actually promoted to the highest rank in the gift of the\r\nThrone, that is made \"Senior Guardian of the Heir Apparent\" and\r\nplaced in charge of the Imperial funeral arrangements--a\r\nlucrative appointment. During that interval it is understood that\r\nthe new Regent, brother of the Emperor Kwang-hsu, consulted all\r\nthe most trusted magnates of the empire regarding the manner in\r\nwhich the secret decapitation Decree should be treated. All\r\nadvised him to be warned in time, and not to venture on a course\r\nof action which would be condemned both by the nation and by the\r\nPowers. Another Edict was therefore prepared simply dismissing\r\nYuan Shih-kai from office and ordering him to return to his native\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nEvery one remembers that day in Peking when popular rumour\r\ndeclared that the man's last hour had come. Warned on every side\r\nto beware, Yuan Shih-kai left the Palace as soon as he had read\r\nthe Edict of dismissal in the Grand Council and drove straight to\r\nthe railway-station, whence he entrained for Tientsin, dressed as\r\na simple citizen. Rooms had been taken for him at a European\r\nhotel, the British Consulate approached for protection, when\r\nanother train brought down his eldest son bearing a message direct\r\nfrom the Grand Council Chamber, absolutely guaranteeing the safety\r\nof his life. Accordingly he duly returned to his native place in\r\nHonan province, and for two years--until the outbreak of the\r\nRevolution--devoted himself sedulously to the development of the\r\nlarge estate he had acquired with the fruits of office. Living\r\nlike a patriarch of old, surrounded by his many wives and\r\nchildren, he announced constantly that he had entirely dropped out\r\nof the political life of China and only desired to be left in\r\npeace. There is reason to believe, however, that his henchmen\r\ncontinually reported to him the true state of affairs and bade him\r\nbide his time. Certain it is that the firing of the first shots on\r\nthe Yangtsze found him alert and issuing private orders to his\r\nfollowers. It was inevitable that he should have been recalled to\r\noffice--and actually within one hundred hours of the first news of\r\nthe outbreak the Court sent for him urgently and ungraciously.\r\n\r\nFrom the 14th October, 1911, when he was appointed by Imperial\r\nEdict Viceroy of Hupeh and Hunan and ordered to proceed at once to\r\nthe front to quell the insurrection, until the 1st November, when\r\nhe was given virtually Supreme Power as President of the Grand\r\nCouncil in place of Prince Ching, a whole volume is required to\r\ndiscuss adequately the maze of questions involved. For the\r\npurposes of this account, however, the matter can be dismissed\r\nvery briefly in this way. Welcoming the opportunity which had at\r\nlast come and determined once for all to settle matters\r\ndecisively, so far as he was personally concerned, Yuan Shih-kai\r\ndeliberately followed the policy of holding back and delaying\r\neverything until the very incapacity marking both sides--the\r\nRevolutionists quite as much as the Manchus--forced him, as man of\r\naction and man of diplomacy, to be acclaimed the sole mediator and\r\nsaviour of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe detailed course of the Revolution, and the peculiar manner in\r\nwhich Yuan Shih-kai allowed events rather than men to assert their\r\nmastery has often been related and need not long detain us. It is\r\ngenerally conceded that in spite of the bravery of the raw\r\nrevolutionary levies, their capacity was entirely unequal to the\r\ntrump card Yuan Shih-kai held all the while in his hand--the six\r\nfully-equipped Divisions of Field Troops he himself had organized\r\nas Tientsin Viceroy. It was a portion of this field-force which\r\ncaptured and destroyed the chief revolutionary base in the triple\r\ncity of Hankow, Hanyang and Wuchang in November, 1911, and which\r\nhe held back just as it was about to give the coup de grace by\r\ncrossing the river in force and sweeping the last remnants of the\r\nrevolutionary army to perdition. Thus it is correct to declare\r\nthat had he so wished Yuan Shih-kai could have crushed the\r\nrevolution entirely before the end of 1911; but he was\r\nsufficiently astute to see that the problem he had to solve was\r\nnot merely military but moral as well. The Chinese as a nation\r\nwere suffering from a grave complaint. Their civilization had been\r\nmade almost bankrupt owing to unresisted foreign aggression and to\r\nthe native inability to cope with the mass of accumulated wrongs\r\nwhich a superimposed and exhausted feudalism--the Manchu system--\r\nhad brought about. Yuan Shih-kai knew that the Boxers had been\r\ntheoretically correct in selecting as they first did the watchword\r\nwhich they had first placed on their banners--\"blot out the\r\nManchus and all foreign things.\" Both had sapped the old\r\ncivilization to its foundations. But the program they had proposed\r\nwas idealistic, not practical. One element could be cleared away--\r\nthe other had to be endured. Had the Boxers been sensible they\r\nwould have modified their program to the extent of protecting the\r\nforeigners, whilst they assailed the Dynasty which had brought\r\nthem so low. The Court Party, as we have said, seduced their\r\nleaders to acting in precisely the reverse sense.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai was neither a Boxer, nor yet a believer in\r\nidealistic foolishness. He had realized that the essence of\r\nsuccessful rule in the China of the Twentieth Century was to\r\nsupport the foreign point of view--nominally at least--because\r\nforeigners disposed of unlimited monetary resources, and had\r\nscience on their side. He knew that so long as he did not openly\r\nflout foreign opinion by indulging in barefaced assassinations, he\r\nwould be supported owing to the international reputation he had\r\nestablished in 1900. Arguing from these premises, his instinct\r\nalso told him that an appearance of legality must always be\r\nsedulously preserved and the aspirations of the nation nominally\r\nsatisfied. For this reason he arranged matters in such a manner as\r\nto appear always as the instrument of fate. For this reason,\r\nalthough he destroyed the revolutionists on the mid-Yangtsze, to\r\nequalize matters, on the lower Yangtsze he secretly ordered the\r\nevacuation of Nanking by the Imperialist forces so that he might\r\nhave a tangible argument with which to convince the Manchus\r\nregarding the root and branch reform which he knew was necessary.\r\nThat reform had been accepted in principle by the Throne when it\r\nagreed to the so-called Nineteen Fundamental Articles, a corpus of\r\ndemands which all the Northern Generals had endorsed and had\r\nindeed insisted should be the basis of government before they\r\nwould fight the rebellious South in 1911. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that provided he had been made de facto Regent, Yuan Shih-\r\nkai would have supported to the end a Manchu Monarchy. But the\r\nsurprising swiftness of the Revolutionary Party's action in\r\nproclaiming the Republic at Nanking on the 1st January, 1912, and\r\nthe support which foreign opinion gave that venture confused him.\r\nHe had already consented to peace negotiations with the\r\nrevolutionary South in the middle of December, 1911, and once he\r\nwas drawn into those negotiations his policy wavered, the\r\narmistice in the field being constantly extended because he saw\r\nthat the Foreign Powers, and particularly England, were averse\r\nfrom further civil war. Having dispatched a former lieutenant,\r\nTong Shao-yi, to Shanghai as his Plenipotentiary, he soon found\r\nhimself committed to a course of action different from what he had\r\noriginally contemplated. South China and Central China insisted so\r\nvehemently that the only solution that was acceptable to them was\r\nthe permanent and absolute elimination of the Manchu Dynasty, that\r\nhe himself was half-convinced, the last argument necessary being\r\nthe secret promise that he should become the first President of\r\nthe united Republic. In the circumstances, had he been really\r\nloyal, it was his duty either to resume his warfare or resign his\r\nappointment as Prime Minister and go into retirement. He did\r\nneither. In a thoroughly characteristic manner he sought a middle\r\ncourse, after having vaguely advocated a national convention to\r\nsettle the matter. By specious misrepresentation the widow of the\r\nEmperor Kwang Hsu--the Dowager Empress Lung Yu who had succeeded\r\nthe Prince Regent Ch'un in her care of the interests of the child\r\nEmperor Hsuan Tung--was induced to believe that ceremonial\r\nretirement was the only course open to the Dynasty if the country\r\nwas to be saved from disruption and partition. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that the Memorial of all the Northern Generals which was\r\ntelegraphed to Peking on the 28th January, 1912, and which advised\r\nabdication, was inspired by him. In any case it was certainly Yuan\r\nShih-kai, who drew up the so-called Articles of Favourable\r\nTreatment for the Manchu House and caused them to be telegraphed\r\nto the South, whence they were telegraphed back to him as the\r\nmaximum the Revolutionary Party was prepared to concede: and by a\r\ncurious chance the attempt made to assassinate him outside the\r\nPalace Gates actually occurred on the very day he had submitted an\r\noutline of these terms on his bended knees to the Empress Dowager\r\nand secured their qualified acceptance. The pathetic attempt to\r\nconfer on him as late as the 26th January the title of Marquess,\r\nthe highest rank of nobility which could be given a Chinese, an\r\nattempt which was four times renewed, was the last despairing\r\ngesture of a moribund power. Within very few days the Throne\r\nreluctantly decreed its own abdication in three extremely curious\r\nEdicts which are worthy of study in the appendix. They prove\r\nconclusively that the Imperial Family believed that it was only\r\nabdicating its political power, whilst retaining all ancient\r\nceremonial rights and titles. Plainly the conception of a\r\nRepublic, or a People's Government, as it was termed in the native\r\nideographs, was unintelligible to Peking.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai had now won everything he wished for. By securing\r\nthat the Imperial Commission to organize the Republic and re-unite\r\nthe warring sections was placed solely in his hands, he prepared\r\nto give a type of Government about which he knew nothing a trial.\r\nIt is interesting to note that he held to the very end of his life\r\nthat he derived his powers solely from the Last Edicts, and in\r\nnowise from his compact with the Nanking Republic which had\r\ninstituted the so-called Provisional Constitution. He was careful,\r\nhowever, not to lay this down categorically until many months\r\nlater when his dictatorship seemed undisputed. But from the day of\r\nthe Manchu Abdication almost, he was constantly engaged in\r\ncalculating whether he dared risk everything on one throw of the\r\ndice and ascend the Throne himself; and it is precisely this which\r\nimparts such dramatic interest to the astounding story which\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM REPUBLIC\r\n\r\n(FROM THE 1ST JANUARY, 1912, TO THE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo describe briefly and intelligibly the series of transactions\r\nfrom the 1st January, 1912, when the Republic was proclaimed at\r\nNanking by a handful of provincial delegates, and Dr. Sun Yat Sen\r\nelected Provisional President, to the coup d'etat of 4th November,\r\n1913, when Yuan Shih-kai, elected full President a few weeks\r\npreviously, after having acted as Chief Executive for twenty\r\nmonths, boldly broke up Parliament and made himself de facto\r\nDictator of China, is a matter of extraordinary difficulty.\r\n\r\nAll through this important period of Chinese history one has the\r\nimpression that one is in dreamland and that fleeting emotions\r\ntake the place of more solid things. Plot and counter-plot follow\r\none another so rapidly that an accurate record of them all would\r\nbe as wearisome as the Book of Chronicles itself; whilst the\r\namazing web of financial intrigue which binds the whole together\r\nis so complex--and at the same time so antithetical to the\r\npolitical struggle--that the two stories seem to run counter to\r\none another, although they are as closely united as two assassins\r\npledged to carry through in common a dread adventure. A huge\r\nagglomeration of people estimated to number four hundred millions,\r\nbeing left without qualified leaders and told that the system of\r\ngovernment, which had been laid down by the Nanking Provisional\r\nConstitution and endorsed by the Abdication Edicts, was a system\r\nin which every man was as good as neighbour, swayed meaninglessly\r\nto and fro, vainly seeking to regain the equilibrium which had\r\nbeen so sensationally lost. A litigious spirit became so universal\r\nthat all authority was openly derided, crimes of every description\r\nbeing so common as to force most respectable men to withdraw from\r\npublic affairs and leave a bare rump of desperadoes in power.\r\n\r\nLong embarrassed by the struggle to pay her foreign loans and\r\nindemnities, China was also virtually penniless. The impossibility\r\nof arranging large borrowings on foreign markets without the open\r\nsupport of foreign governments--a support which was hedged round\r\nwith conditions--made necessary a system of petty expedients under\r\nwhich practically every provincial administration hypothecated\r\nevery liquid asset it could lay hands upon in order to pay the\r\ninordinate number of undisciplined soldiery who littered the\r\ncountryside. The issue of unguaranteed paper-money soon reached\r\nsuch an immense figure that the market was flooded with a\r\nworthless currency which it was unable to absorb. The Provincial\r\nleaders, being powerless to introduce improvement, exclaimed that\r\nit was the business of the Central Government as representative of\r\nthe sovereign people to find solutions; and so long as they\r\nmaintained themselves in office they went their respective ways\r\nwith a sublime contempt for the chaos around them.\r\n\r\nWhat was this Central Government? In order successfully to\r\nunderstand an unparalleled situation we must indicate its nature.\r\n\r\nThe manoeuvres to which Yuan Shih-kai had so astutely lent himself\r\nfrom the outbreak of the Revolution had left him at its official\r\nclose supreme in name. Not only had he secured an Imperial\r\nCommission from the abdicating Dynasty to organize a popular\r\nGovernment in obedience to the national wish, but having brought\r\nto Peking the Delegates of the Nanking Revolutionary Body he had\r\nreceived from them the formal offer of the Presidency.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements had, of course, been secretly agreed to en bloc\r\nbefore the fighting had been stopped and the abdication\r\nproclaimed, and were part and parcel of the elaborate scenery\r\nwhich officialdom always employs in Asia even when it is dealing\r\nwith matters within the purview of the masses. They had been made\r\npossible by the so-called \"Article of Favourable Treatment\" drawn-\r\nup by Yuan Shih-kai himself, after consultation with the\r\nrebellious South. In these Capitulations it had been clearly\r\nstipulated that the Manchu Imperial Family should receive in\r\nperpetuity a Civil List of $4,000,000 Mexican a year, retaining\r\nall their titles as a return for the surrender of their political\r\npower, the bitter pill being gilded in such fashion as to hide its\r\nreal meaning, which alone was a grave political error.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this agreement, however, great mutual suspicion\r\nexisted between North and South China. Yuan Shih-kai himself was\r\nunable to forget that the bold attempt to assassinate him in the\r\nPeking streets on the 17th January, when he was actually engaged\r\nin negotiating these very terms of the Abdication, had been\r\napparently inspired from Nanking; whilst the Southern leaders were\r\ndaily reminded by the vernacular press that the man who held the\r\nbalance of power had always played the part of traitor in the past\r\nand would certainly do the same again in the near future.\r\n\r\nWhen the Delegates came to Peking in February, by far the most\r\nimportant matter which was still in dispute was the question of\r\nthe oath of office which Yuan Shih-kai was called upon to take to\r\ninsure that he would be faithful to the Republic. The Delegates\r\nhad been charged specifically to demand on behalf of the seceding\r\nprovinces that Yuan Shih-kai should proceed with them to Nanking\r\nto take that oath, a course of action which would have been held\r\ntantamount by the nation to surrender on his part to those who had\r\nbeen unable to vanquish him in the field. It must also not be\r\nforgotten that from the very beginning a sharp and dangerous\r\ncleavage of opinion existed as to the manner in which the powers\r\nof the new government had been derived. South and Central China\r\nclaimed, and claimed rightly, that the Nanking Provincial\r\nConstitution was the Instrument on which the Republic was based:\r\nYuan Shih-kai declared that the Abdication Edicts, and not the\r\nNanking Instrument had established the Republic, and that\r\ntherefore it lay within his competence to organize the new\r\ngovernment in the way which he considered most fit.\r\n\r\nThe discussion which raged was suddenly terminated on the night of\r\nthe 29th February (1912) when without any warning there occurred\r\nthe extraordinary revolt of the 3rd Division, a picked Northern\r\ncorps who for forty-eight hours plundered and burnt portions of\r\nthe capital without any attempts at interference, there being\r\nlittle doubt to-day that this manoeuvre was deliberately arranged\r\nas a means of intimidation by Yuan Shih-kai himself. Although the\r\ndisorders assumed such dimensions that foreign intervention was\r\nnarrowly escaped, the upshot was that the Nanking Delegates were\r\ncompletely cowed and willing to forget all about forcing the\r\ndespot of Peking to proceed to the Southern capital. Yuan Shih-kai\r\nas the man of the hour was enabled on the 10th March, 1912, to\r\ntake his oath in Peking as he had wished thus securing full\r\nfreedom of action during the succeeding years. [Footnote: The\r\ndefective nature of this oath of office will be patent at a\r\nglance: \"At the beginning of the Republic there are many things to\r\nbe taken care of. I, Yuan Shih-kai, sincerely wish to exert my\r\nutmost to promote the democratic spirit, to remove the dark blots\r\nof despotism, to obey strictly the Constitution, and to abide by\r\nthe wish of the people, so as to place the country in a safe,\r\nunited, strong, and firm position, and to effect the happiness and\r\nwelfare of the divisions of the Chinese race. All these wishes I\r\nwill fulfil without fail. As soon as a new President is elected by\r\nthe National Assembly I shall at once vacate my present position.\r\nWith all sincerity I take this oath before the people of China.\r\n\"Dated the tenth day of March in the First Year of the Republic of\r\nChina (1912).\"\r\n\r\n(Signed) Yuan Shih-kai.]\r\n\r\nIt was on this astounding basis--by means of an organized revolt--\r\nthat the Central Government was re-organized; and every act that\r\nfollowed bears the mark of its tainted parentage. Accepting\r\nreadily as his Ministers in the more unimportant government\r\nDepartments the nominees of the Southern Confederacy (which was\r\nnow formally dissolved), Yuan Shih-kai was careful to reserve for\r\nhis own men everything that concerned the control of the army and\r\nthe police, as well as the all-important ministry of finance. The\r\nframework having been thus erected, attention was almost\r\nimmediately concentrated on the problem of finding money, an\r\namazing matter which would weary the stoutest reader if given in\r\nall its detail but which being part and parcel of the general\r\nproblem must be referred to.\r\n\r\nCertain essential features can be very rapidly exposed. We have\r\nalready made clear the purely economic nature of the forces which\r\nhad sapped the foundations of Chinese society. Primarily it had\r\nbeen the disastrous nature of Chinese gold-indebtedness which had\r\ngiven the new ideas the force they required to work their will on\r\nthe nation. And just because the question of this gold-\r\nindebtedness had become so serious and such a drain on the nation,\r\nsome months before the outbreak of the Revolution an arrangement\r\nhad been entered into with the bankers of four nations for a\r\nCurrency Loan of 10,000,000 pounds with which to make an organized\r\neffort to re-establish internal credit. But this loan had never\r\nactually been floated, as a six months' safety clause had\r\npermitted a delay during which the Revolution had come. It was\r\ntherefore necessary to begin the negotiations anew; and as the\r\nrich prizes to be won in the Chinese lottery had attracted general\r\nattention in the European financial world through the\r\nadvertisement which the Revolution had given the country, a host\r\nof alternative loan proposals now lay at the disposal of Peking.\r\n\r\nConsequently an extraordinary chapter of bargaining commenced.\r\nWarned that an International Debt Commission was the goal aimed at\r\nby official finance, Yuan Shih-kai and the various parties who\r\nmade up the Government of the day, though disagreeing on almost\r\nevery other question, were agreed that this danger must be fought\r\nas a common enemy. Though the Four-Power group alleged that they\r\nheld the first option on all Chinese loans, money had already been\r\nadvanced by a Franco-Belgian Syndicate to the amount of nearly two\r\nmillion pounds during the critical days of the Abdication. Furious\r\nat the prospect of losing their percentages, the Four Power group\r\nmade the confusion worse confounded by blocking all competing\r\nproposals and closing every possible door. Russia and Japan, who\r\nhad hitherto not been parties to the official consortium,\r\nperceiving that participation had become a political necessity,\r\nnow demanded a place which was grudgingly accorded them; and it\r\nwas in this way that the celebrated six-power Group arose.\r\n\r\nIt was round this group and the proposed issue of a 60,000,000\r\npounds loan to reorganize Chinese finance that the central battle\r\nraged. The Belgian Syndicate, having been driven out of business\r\nby the financial boycott which the official group was strong\r\nenough to organize on the European bourses, it remained for China\r\nto see whether she could not find some combination or some man who\r\nwould be bold enough to ignore all governments.\r\n\r\nHer search was not in vain. In September (1912) a London\r\nstockbroker, Mr. Birch Crisp, determined to risk a brilliant coup\r\nby negotiating by himself a Loan of 10,000,000 pounds; and the\r\nworld woke up one morning to learn that one man was successfully\r\nopposing six governments. The recollection of the storm raised in\r\nfinancial circles by this bold attempt will be fresh in many\r\nminds. Every possible weapon was brought into play by\r\ninternational finance to secure that the impudence of financial\r\nindependence should be properly checked; and so it happened that\r\nalthough 5,000,000 pounds was secured after an intense struggle,\r\nit was soon plain that the large requirements of a derelict\r\ngovernment could not be satisfied in this Quixotic manner. Two\r\nimportant points had, however, been attained; first, China was\r\nkept financially afloat during the year 1912 by the independence\r\nof a single member of the London Stock Exchange; secondly, using\r\nthis coup as a lever the Peking Government secured better terms\r\nthan otherwise would have been possible from the official\r\nconsortium.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the general internal situation remained deplorable.\r\nNothing was done for the provinces whose paper currency was\r\ndepreciating from month to month in an alarming manner; whilst the\r\nrivalries between the various leaders instead of diminishing\r\nseemed to be increasing. The Tutuhs, or Military Governors, acting\r\nprecisely as they saw fit, derided the authority of Peking and\r\nsought to strengthen their old position by adding to their armed\r\nforces. In the capital the old Manchu court, safely entrenched in\r\nthe vast Winter Palace from which it has not even to-day been\r\nejected (1917) published daily the Imperial Gazette, bestowing\r\nhonours and decorations on courtiers and clansmen and preserving\r\nall the old etiquette. In the North-western provinces, and in\r\nManchuria and Mongolia, the socalled Tsung She Tang, or Imperial\r\nClan Society, intrigued perpetually to create risings which would\r\nhasten the restoration of the fallen House; and although these\r\nintrigues never rose to the rank of a real menace to the country,\r\nthe fact that they were surreptitiously supported by the Japanese\r\nsecret service was a continual source of anxiety. The question of\r\nOuter Mongolia was also harassing the Central Government. The\r\nHutuktu or Living Buddha of Urga--the chief city of Outer\r\nMongolia--had utilized the revolution to throw off his allegiance\r\nto Peking; and the whole of this vast region had been thrown into\r\ncomplete disorder--which was still further accentuated when Russia\r\non the 21st October (1912) recognized its independence. It was\r\nknown that as a pendent to this Great Britain was about to insist\r\non the autonomy of Tibet,--a development which greatly hurt\r\nChinese pride.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th August, 1912, the deplorable situation was well-\r\nepitomised by an extraordinary act in Peking, when General Chang\r\nCheng-wu, one of the \"heroes\" of the original Wuchang rising, who\r\nhad been enticed to the capital, was suddenly seized after a\r\nbanquet in his honour and shot without trial at midnight.\r\n\r\nThis event, trivial in itself during times when judicial murders\r\nwere common, would have excited nothing more than passing interest\r\nhad not the national sentiment been so aroused by the chaotic\r\nconditions. As it was it served to focus attention on the general\r\nmaladministration over which Yuan Shih-kai ruled as provisional\r\nPresident. \"What is my crime?\" had shrieked the unhappy\r\nrevolutionist as he had been shot and then bayonetted to death.\r\nThat query was most easily answered. His crime was that he was not\r\nstrong enough or big enough to compete against more sanguinary\r\nmen, his disappearance being consequently in obedience to an\r\nuniversal law of nature. Yuan Shih-kai was determined to assert\r\nhis mastery by any and every means; and as this man had flouted\r\nhim he must die.\r\n\r\nThe uproar which this crime aroused was, however, not easily\r\nappeased; and the Advisory Council, which was sitting in Peking\r\npending the assembling of the first Parliament, denounced the\r\nProvisional President so bitterly that to show that these\r\nreproaches were ill-deserved he invited Dr. Sun Yat-sen to the\r\ncapital treating him with unparalleled honours and requesting him\r\nto act as intermediary between the rival factions. All such\r\nmanoeuvres, however, were inspired with one object,--namely to\r\nprove how nobody but the master of Peking could regulate the\r\naffairs of the country.\r\n\r\nStill no Parliament was assembled. Although the Nanking\r\nProvisional Constitution had stipulated that one was to meet\r\nwithin ten months i. e. before 1st November, 1912, the elections\r\nwere purposely delayed, the attention of the Central Government\r\nbeing concentrated on the problem of destroying all rivals, and\r\neverything being subordinate to this war on persons. Rascals,\r\ngetting daily more and more out of hand, worked their will on rich\r\nand poor alike, discrediting by their actions the name of\r\nrepublicanism and destroying public confidence--which was\r\nprecisely what suited Yuan Shih-kai. Dramatic and extraordinary\r\nincidents continually inflamed the public mind, nothing being too\r\nsingular for those remarkable days.\r\n\r\nVery slowly the problem developed, with everyone exclaiming that\r\nforeign intervention was becoming inevitable. With the beginning\r\nof 1913, being unable to delay the matter any longer, Yuan Shih-\r\nkai allowed elections to be held in the provinces. He was so badly\r\nbeaten at the polls that it seemed in spite of his military power\r\nthat he would be outvoted and outmanoeuvred in the new National\r\nAssembly and his authority undermined. To prevent this a fresh\r\nassassination was decided upon. The ablest Southern leader, Sung\r\nChiao-jen, just as he was entraining for Peking with a number of\r\nParliamentarians at Shanghai, was coolly shot in a crowded railway\r\nstation by a desperado who admitted under trial that he had been\r\npaid 200 pounds for the job by the highest authority in the land,\r\nthe evidence produced in court including telegrams from Peking\r\nwhich left no doubt as to who had instigated the murder.\r\n\r\nThe storm raised by this evil measure made it appear as if no\r\nparliament could ever assemble in Peking. But the feeling had\r\nbecome general that the situation was so desperate that action had\r\nto be taken. Not only was their reputation at stake, but the\r\nKuomingtang or Revolutionary Party now knew that the future of\r\ntheir country was involved just as much as the safety of their own\r\nlives; and so after a rapid consultation they determined that they\r\nwould beard the lion in his den. Rather unexpectedly on the 7th\r\nApril (1913) Parliament was opened in Peking with a huge Southern\r\nmajority and the benediction of all Radicals. [Footnote: The\r\nParliament of China is composed of a House of Representatives\r\nnumbering 596 members and a Senate of 274. The Representatives are\r\nelected by means of a property and educational franchise which is\r\nestimated to give about four million voters (1 per cent of the\r\npopulation) although in practice relatively few vote. The Senate\r\nis elected by the Provincial Assemblies by direct ballot. In the\r\nopinion of the writer, the Chinese Parliament in spite of obvious\r\nshortcoming, is representative of the country in its present\r\ntransitional stage.] Hopes rose with mercurial rapidity as a\r\nsolution at last seemed in sight. But hardly had the first\r\nformalities been completed and Speakers been elected to both\r\nHouses, than by a single dramatic stroke Yuan Shih-kai reduced to\r\nnought these labours by stabbing in the back the whole theory and\r\npractice of popular government.\r\n\r\nThe method he employed was simplicity itself, and it is peculiarly\r\ncharacteristic of the man that he should have been so bluntly\r\ncynical. Though the Provisional Nanking Constitution, which was\r\nthe \"law\" of China so far as there was any law at all, had laid\r\ndown specifically in article XIX that all measures affecting the\r\nNational Treasury must receive the assent of Parliament, Yuan\r\nShih-kai, pretending that the small Advisory Council which had\r\nassisted him during the previous year and which had only just been\r\ndissolved, had sanctioned a foreign loan, peremptorily ordered the\r\nsignature of the great Reorganization Loan of 25,000,000 pounds\r\nwhich had been secretly under negotiation all Winter with the\r\nfinancial agents of six Powers, [Footnote: The American Group at\r\nthe last moment dropped out of the Sextuple combination (prior to\r\nthe signature of the contract) after President Wilson had made his\r\nwell-known pronouncement deprecating the association of Americans\r\nin any financial undertakings which impinged upon the rights of\r\nsovereignty of a friendly Power,--which was his considered view of\r\nthe manner in which foreign governments were assisting their\r\nnationals to gain control of the Salt Administration. The exact\r\nlanguage the President used was that the conditions of the loan\r\nseemed \"to touch very nearly the administrative independence of\r\nChina itself,\" and that a loan thus obtained was \"obnoxious\" to\r\nthe principles upon which the American government rests. It is to\r\nbe hoped that President Wilson's dictum will be universally\r\naccepted after the war and that meddling in Chinese affairs will\r\ncease.] although the rupture which had come in the previous June\r\nas a forerunner to the Crisp loan had caused the general public to\r\nlose sight of the supreme importance of the financial factor.\r\nParliament, seeing that apart from the possibility of a Foreign\r\nDebt Commission being created something after the Turkish and\r\nEgyptian models, a direct challenge to its existence had been\r\noffered, raged and stormed and did its utmost to delay the\r\nquestion; but the Chief Executive having made up his mind shut\r\nhimself up in his Palace and absolutely refused to see any\r\nParliamentary representatives. Although the Minister of Finance\r\nhimself hesitated to complete the transaction in the face of the\r\nrising storm and actually fled the capital, he was brought back by\r\nspecial train and forced to complete the agreement. At four\r\no'clock in the morning on the 25th April the last documents were\r\nsigned in the building of a foreign bank and the Finance Minister,\r\ngalloping his carriage suddenly out of the compound to avoid\r\npossible bombs, reported to his master that at last--in spite of\r\nthe nominal foreign control which was to govern the disbursement--\r\na vast sum was at his disposal to further his own ends.\r\n\r\nSafe in the knowledge that possession is nine points of the law,\r\nYuan Shih-kai now treated with derision the resolutions which\r\nParliament passed that the transaction was illegal and the loan\r\nagreement null and void. Being openly backed by the agents of the\r\nForeign Powers, he immediately received large cash advances which\r\nenabled him to extend his power in so many directions that further\r\nargument with him seemed useless. It is necessary to record that\r\nthe Parliamentary leaders had almost gone down on their knees to\r\ncertain of the foreign Ministers in Peking in a vain attempt to\r\npersuade them to delay--as they could very well have done--the\r\nsignature of this vital Agreement for forty-eight hours so that it\r\ncould be formally passed by the National Assembly, and thus save\r\nthe vital portion of the sovereignty of the country from passing\r\nunder the heel of one man. But Peking diplomacy is a perverse and\r\ndisagreeable thing; and the Foreign Ministers of those days,\r\nalthough accredited to a government which while it had not then\r\nbeen formally recognized as a Republic by any Power save the\r\nUnited States, was bound to be so very shortly, were determined to\r\nbe reactionary and were at heart delighted to find things running\r\nback normally to absolutism.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The United States accorded formal recognition to the\r\nRepublic on the election of the Speakers of the two Houses of\r\nParliament: the other Treaty Powers delayed recognition until Yuan\r\nShih-kai had been elected full President in October. It has been\r\nvery generally held that the long delay in foreign recognition of\r\nthe Republic contributed greatly to its internal troubles by\r\nmaking every one doubt the reality of the Nanking transaction.\r\nMost important, however, is the historical fact that a group of\r\nPowers numbering the two great leaders of democracy in Europe--\r\nEngland and France--did everything they could in Peking to\r\nenthrone Yuan Shih-kai as dictator.]\r\n\r\nHigh finance had at last got hold of everything it required from\r\nChina and was in no mood to relax the monopoly of the salt\r\nadministration which the Loan Agreement conferred. Nor must be the\r\nfact be lost sight of that of the nominal amount of 25,000,000\r\npounds which had been borrowed, fully half consisted of repayments\r\nto foreign Banks and never left Europe. According to the schedules\r\nattached to the Agreement, Annex A, comprising the Boxer arrears\r\nand bank advances, absorbed 4,317,778 pounds: Annex B, being so-\r\ncalled provincial loans, absorbed a further 2,870,000 pounds:\r\nAnnex C, being liabilities shortly maturing, amounted to 3,592,263\r\npounds: Annex D, for disbandment of troops, amounted to 3,000,000\r\npounds: Annex C, to cover current administrative expenses totalled\r\n5,500,000 pounds: whilst Annex E which covered the reorganization\r\nof the Salt Administration, absorbed the last 2,000,000 pounds.\r\nThe bank profits on this loan alone amounted to 1 1/4 million\r\npounds; whilst Yuan Shih-kai himself was placed in possession by a\r\nsystem of weekly disbursements of a sum roughly amounting to ten\r\nmillion sterling, which was amply sufficient to allow him to wreak\r\nhis will on his fellow-countrymen. Exasperated to the pitch of\r\ndespair by this new development, the Central and Southern\r\nprovinces, after a couple of months' vain argument, began openly\r\nto arm. On the 10th July in Kiangse province on the river Yangtsze\r\nthe Northern garrisons were fired upon from the Hukow forts by the\r\nprovincial troops under General Li Lieh-chun and the so-called\r\nSecond Revolution commenced.\r\n\r\nThe campaign was short and inglorious. The South, ill-furnished\r\nwith munitions and practically penniless, and always confronted by\r\nthe same well-trained Northern Divisions who had proved themselves\r\ninvincible only eighteen months before, fought hard for a while,\r\nbut never became a serious menace to the Central Government owing\r\nto the lack of co-operation between the various Rebel forces in\r\nthe field. The Kiangse troops under General Li Lieh-chun, who\r\nnumbered at most 20,000 men, fought stiffly, it is true, for a\r\nwhile but were unable to strike with any success and were\r\ngradually driven far back from the river into the mountains of\r\nKiangse where their numbers rapidly melted away. The redoubtable\r\nrevolutionary Huang Hsin, who had proved useful as a propagandist\r\nand a bomb-thrower in earlier days, but who was useless in serious\r\nwarfare, although he assumed command of the Nanking garrison which\r\nhad revolted to a man, and attempted a march up the Pukow railway\r\nin the direction of Tientsin, found his effort break down almost\r\nimmediately from lack of organization and fled to Japan. The\r\nNanking troops, although deserted by their leader, offered a\r\nstrenuous resistance to the capture of the southern capital which\r\nwas finally effected by the old reactionary General Chang Hsun\r\noperating in conjunction with General Feng Kuo-chang who had been\r\ndispatched from Peking with a picked force. The attack on the\r\nShanghai arsenal which had been quietly occupied by a small\r\nNorthern Garrison during the months succeeding the great loan\r\ntransaction, although pushed with vigour by the South, likewise\r\nultimately collapsed through lack of artillery and proper\r\nleadership. The navy, which was wholly Southern in its sympathies\r\nand which had been counted upon as a valuable weapon in cutting\r\noff the whole Yangtsze Valley, was at the last moment purchased to\r\nneutrality by a liberal use of money obtained from the foreign\r\nbanks, under, it is said, the heading of administrative expenses!\r\nThe turbulent city of Canton, although it also rose against the\r\nauthority of Peking, had been well provided for by Yuan Shih-kai.\r\nA border General, named Lung Chi-Kwang, with 20,000 semi-savage\r\nKwangsi troops had been moved near the city and at once attacked\r\nand overawed the garrison. Appointed Military Governor of the\r\nprovince in return for his services, this Lung Chi-kwang, who was\r\nan infamous brute, for three years ruled the South with heartless\r\nbarbarity, until he was finally ejected by the great rising of\r\n1916. Thoroughly disappointed in this and many other directions\r\nthe Southern Party was now emasculated; for the moneyed classes\r\nhad withheld their support to the end, and without money nothing\r\nis possible in China. The 1913 outbreak, after lasting a bare two\r\nmonths, ignominiously collapsed with the flight of every one of\r\nthe leaders on whose heads prices were put. The road was now left\r\nopen for the last step Yuan Shih-kai had in mind, the coup against\r\nParliament itself, which although unassociated in any direct way\r\nwith the rising, had undoubtedly maintained secret relations with\r\nthe rebellious generals in the field.\r\n\r\nParliament had further sinned by appointing a Special\r\nConstitutional Drafting Committee which had held its sittings\r\nbehind closed doors at the Temple of Heaven. During this drafting\r\nof the Permanent Constitution, admittance had been absolutely\r\nrefused to Yuan Shih-kai's delegates who had been sent to urge a\r\nmodification of the decentralization which had been such a\r\ncharacteristic of the Nanking Instrument. Such details as\r\ntranspired showed that the principle of absolute money-control was\r\nnot only to be the dominant note in the Permanent Constitution,\r\nbut that a new and startling innovation was being included to\r\nsecure that a de facto Dictatorship should be rendered impossible.\r\nBriefly, it was proposed that when Parliament was not actually in\r\nsession there should be left in Peking a special Parliamentary\r\nCommittee, charged with supervising and controlling the Executive,\r\nand checking any usurpation of power.\r\n\r\nThis was enough for Yuan Shih-kai: he felt that he was not only an\r\nobject of general suspicion but that he was being treated with\r\ncontempt. He determined to finish with it all. He was as yet,\r\nhowever, only provisional President and it was necessary to show\r\ncunning. Once more he set to work in a characteristic way. By a\r\nliberal use of money Parliament was induced to pass in advance of\r\nthe main body of articles the Chapter of the Constitution dealing\r\nwith the election and term of office of the President. When that\r\nhad been done the two Chambers sitting as an Electoral College,\r\nafter the model of the French Parliament, being partly bribed and\r\npartly terrorised by a military display, were induced to elect him\r\nfull President.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th October he took his final oath of office as President\r\nfor a term of five years before a great gathering of officials and\r\nthe whole diplomatic body in the magnificent Throne Room of the\r\nWinter Palace. Safe now in his Constitutional position nothing\r\nremained for him but to strike. On the 4th November he issued an\r\narbitrary Mandate, which received the counter-signature of the\r\nwhole Cabinet, ordering the unseating of all the so-called\r\nKuomingtang or Radical Senators and Representatives on the counts\r\nof conspiracy and secret complicity with the July rising and\r\nvaguely referring to the filling of the vacancies thus created by\r\nnew elections. [Footnote: According to the official lists\r\npublished subsequent to the coup d'etat, 98 Senators and 252\r\nMembers of the House of Representatives had their Parliamentary\r\nCertificates impounded by the police as a result of the Mandates\r\nof the 4th November, and were ordered to leave the Capital. In\r\naddition 34 Senators and 54 Members of the Lower House fled from\r\nPeking before their Certificates could be seized. Therefore the\r\ntotal number affected by the proscription was 132 Senators and 306\r\nRepresentatives. As the quorums in the case of both Houses are\r\nhalf the total membership, any further sittings were thus made\r\nimpossible.] The Metropolitan Police rigorously carried out the\r\norder and although no brutality was shown, it was made clear that\r\nif any of the indicted men remained in Peking their lives would be\r\nat stake. Having made it impossible for Parliament to sit owing to\r\nthe lack of quorums, Yuan Shih-kai was able to proceed with his\r\nwork of reorganization in the way that best suited him; and the\r\nnovel spectacle was offered of a truly Mexican situation created\r\nin the Far East by and with the assent of the Powers. It is\r\nsignificant that the day succeeding this coup d'etat of the 4th\r\nNovember the agreement conceding autonomy to Outer Mongolia was\r\nsigned with Russia, China simply retaining the right to station a\r\ndiplomatic representative at Urga. [Footnote: A full copy of this\r\nagreement will be found in the appendix.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of his undisputed power, matters however did not improve.\r\nThe police-control, judiciously mingled with assassinations, which\r\nwas now put in full vigour was hardly the administration to make\r\nroom for which the Manchus had been expelled; and the country\r\nsecretly chafed and cursed. But the disillusionment of the people\r\nwas complete. Revolt had been tried in vain; and as the support\r\nwhich the Powers were affording to this regime was well understood\r\nthere was nothing to do but to wait, safe in the knowledge that\r\nsuch a situation possessed no elements of permanency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE DICTATOR AT WORK\r\n\r\n(FROM THE COUP D'ETAT OF THE 4TH NOVEMBER, 1913, TO THE OUTBREAK\r\nOF THE WORLD-WAR 1ST AUGUST, 1914)\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the Parliament of China effectively destroyed, and the\r\nturbulent Yangtsze Valley dragooned into sullen submission, Yuan\r\nShih-kai's task had become so vastly simplified that he held the\r\nmoment to have arrived when he could openly turn his hand to the\r\nproblem of making himself absolutely supreme, de jure as well as\r\nde facto. But there was one remaining thing to be done. To drive\r\nthe last nail into the coffin of the Republic it was necessary to\r\ndiscredit and virtually imprison the man who was Vice-President.\r\n\r\nIt is highly characteristic that although he had received from the\r\nhero of the Wuchang Rising the most loyal co-operation--a co-\r\noperation of a very arduous character since the Commander of the\r\nMiddle Yangtsze had had to resist the most desperate attempts to\r\nforce him over to the side of the rebellion in July, 1913,\r\nnevertheless, Yuan Shih-kai was determined to bring this man to\r\nPeking as a prisoner of state.\r\n\r\nIt was just the fact that General Li Yuan-hung was a national hero\r\nwhich impelled the Dictator to action. In the election which had\r\nbeen carried out in October, 1913, by the National Assembly\r\nsitting as a National Convention, in spite of every effort to\r\ndestroy his influence, the personal popularity of the Vice-\r\nPresident had been such that he had received a large number of\r\nvotes for the office of full President--which had necessitated not\r\none but three ballots being taken, making most people declare that\r\nhad there been no bribery or intimidation he would have probably\r\nbeen elected to the supreme office in the land, and ousted the\r\nambitious usurper. In such circumstances his complete elimination\r\nwas deemed an elementary necessity. To secure that end Yuan Shih-\r\nkai suddenly dispatched to Wuchang--where the Vice-President had\r\nresided without break since 1911--the Minister of War, General\r\nTuan Chi-jui, with implicit instructions to deal with the problem\r\nin any way he deemed satisfactory, stopping short of nothing\r\nshould his victim prove recalcitrant.\r\n\r\nFortunately General Tuan Chi-jui did not belong to the ugly breed\r\nof men Yuan Shih-kai loved to surround himself with; and although\r\nhe was a loyal and efficient officer the politics of the assassin\r\nwere unknown to him. He was therefore able to convince the Vice-\r\nPresident after a brief discussion that the easiest way out of the\r\nring of intriguers and plotters in which Yuan Shih-kai was rapidly\r\nsurrounding him in Wuchang was to go voluntarily to the capital.\r\nThere at least he would be in daily touch with developments and\r\nable to fight his own battles without fear of being stabbed in the\r\nback; since under the eye of the foreign Legations even Yuan Shih-\r\nkai was exhibiting a certain timidity. Indeed after the outcry\r\nwhich General Chang Cheng-wu's judicial murder had aroused he had\r\nreserved his ugliest deeds for the provinces, only small men being\r\ndone to death in Peking. Accordingly, General Li Yuan-hung packed\r\na bag and accompanied only by an aide-de-camp left abruptly for\r\nthe capital where he arrived on the 11th December, 1913.\r\n\r\nA great sensation was caused throughout China by this sudden\r\ndeparture, consternation prevailing among the officers and men of\r\nthe Hupeh (Wuchang) army when the newspapers began to hint that\r\ntheir beloved chief had been virtually abducted. Although\r\ncordially received by Yuan Shih-kai and given as his personal\r\nresidence the Island Palace where the unfortunate Emperor Kwang\r\nHsu had been so long imprisoned by the Empress Dowager Tsu Hsi\r\nafter her coup d'etat of 1898, it did not take long for General Li\r\nYuan-hung to understand that his presence was a source of\r\nembarrassment to the man who would be king. Being, however, gifted\r\nwith an astounding fund of patience, he prepared to sit down and\r\nallow the great game which he knew would now unroll to be played\r\nto its normal ending. What General Li Yuan-hung desired above all\r\nwas to be forgotten completely and absolutely--springing to life\r\nwhen the hour of deliverance finally arrived. His policy was shown\r\nto be not only psychologically accurate, but masterly in a\r\npolitical sense. The greatest ally of honesty in China has always\r\nbeen time, the inherent decency of the race finally discrediting\r\nscoundrelism in every period of Chinese history.\r\n\r\nThe year 1914 dawned with so many obstacles removed that Yuan\r\nShih-kai became more and more peremptory in his methods. In\r\nFebruary the young Empress Lun Yi, widow of the Emperor Kwang Hsu,\r\nwho two years previously in her character of guardian of the boy-\r\nEmperor Hsuan Tung, had been cajoled into sanctioning the\r\nAbdication Edicts, unexpectedly expired, her death creating\r\nprofound emotion because it snapped the last link with the past.\r\nYuan Shih-kai's position was considerably strengthened by this\r\nauspicious event which secretly greatly delighted him; and by his\r\norder for three days the defunct Empress lay in State in the Grand\r\nHall of the Winter Palace and received the obeisance of countless\r\nmultitudes who appeared strangely moved by this hitherto unknown\r\nprocedure. There was now only a nine-year old boy between the\r\nDictator and his highest ambitions. Two final problems still\r\nremained to be dealt with: to give a legal form to a purely\r\nautocratic rule, and to find money to govern the country. The\r\nsecond matter was vastly more important than the first to a man\r\nwho did not hesitate to base his whole polity on the teachings of\r\nMachiavelli, legality being looked upon as only so much political\r\nwindow-dressing to placate foreign opinion and prevent\r\nintervention, whilst without money even the semblance of the\r\nrights of eminent domain could not be preserved. Everything indeed\r\nhinged on the question of finding money.\r\n\r\nThere was none in China, at least none for the government.\r\nFinancial chaos still reigned supreme in spite of the great\r\nReorganization Loan of 25,000,000 pounds, which had been carefully\r\narranged more for the purpose of wiping-out international\r\nindebtedness and balancing the books of foreign bankers than to\r\ninstitute a modern government. All the available specie in the\r\ncountry had been very quietly remitted in these troubled times by\r\nthe native merchant-guilds from every part of China to the vast\r\nemporium of Shanghai for safe custody, where a sum not far short\r\nof a hundred million ounces now choked the vaults of the foreign\r\nbanks,--being safe from governmental expropriation. The collection\r\nof provincial revenues having been long disorganized, Yuan Shih-\r\nkai, in spite of his military dictatorship, found it impossible to\r\nsecure the proper resumption of the provincial remittances. Fresh\r\nloans became more and more sought after; by means of forced\r\ndomestic issues a certain amount of cash was obtained, but the\r\ncountry lived from hand to mouth and everybody was unhappy. Added\r\nto this by March the formidable insurrection of the \"White Wolf\"\r\nbandits in Central China--under the legendary leadership of a man\r\nwho was said to be invulnerable--necessitated the mobilization of\r\na fresh army which ran into scores of battalions and which was\r\nvainly engaged for nearly half a year in rounding-up this replica\r\nof the Mexican Villa. So demoralized had the army become from long\r\nlicense that this guerilla warfare was waged with all possible\r\nslackness until a chance shot mortally wounded the chief brigand\r\nand his immense following automatically dispersed. During six\r\nmonths these pests had ravaged three provinces and menaced one of\r\nthe most strongly fortified cities in Asia--the old capital of\r\nChina, Hsianfu, whither the Manchu Court had fled in 1900.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile wholesale executions were carried out in the provinces\r\nwith monotonous regularity and all attempts at rising ruthlessly\r\nsuppressed. In Peking the infamous Chih Fa Chu or Military Court--\r\na sort of Chinese Star-Chamber--was continually engaged in\r\nsummarily dispatching men suspected of conspiring against the\r\nDictator. Even the printed word was looked upon as seditious, an\r\nunfortunate native editor being actually flogged to death in\r\nHankow for telling the truth about conditions in the riverine\r\ndistricts. These cruelties made men more and more determined to\r\npay off the score the very first moment that was possible.\r\nAlthough he was increasingly pressed for ready money, Yuan Shih-\r\nkai, by the end of April, 1914, had the situation sufficiently in\r\nhand to bring out his supreme surprise,--a brand-new Constitution\r\npromulgated under the euphonious title of \"The Constitutional\r\nCompact.\"\r\n\r\nThis precious document, which had no more legality behind it as a\r\ngoverning instrument than a private letter, can be studied by the\r\ncurious in the appendix where it is given in full: here it is\r\nsufficient to say that no such hocuspocus had ever been previously\r\nindulged in China. Drafted by an American legal adviser, Dr.\r\nGoodnow, who was later to earn unenviable international notoriety\r\nas the endorser of the monarchy scheme, it erected what it was\r\npleased to call the Presidential System; that is, it placed all\r\npower directly in the hands of the President, giving him a single\r\nSecretary of State after the American model and reducing Cabinet\r\nMinisters to mere Department Chiefs who received their\r\ninstructions from the State Department but had no real voice in\r\nthe actual government. A new provincial system was likewise\r\ninvented for the provinces, the Tutuhs or Governors of the\r\nRevolutionary period being turned into Chiang Chun or Military\r\nOfficials on the Manchu model and provincial control absolutely\r\ncentralized in their hands, whilst the Provincial Assemblies\r\nestablished under the former dynasty were summarily abolished. The\r\nworship at the Temple of Heaven was also re-established and so was\r\nthe official worship of Confucius--both Imperialistic measures--\r\nwhilst a brand-new ceremony, the worship of the two titulary\r\nMilitary Gods, was ordered so as to inculcate military virtue! It\r\nwas laid down that in the worship of Heaven the President would\r\nwear the robes of the Dukes of the Chow dynasty, B. C. 1112, a\r\nnovel and interesting republican experiment. Excerpts from two\r\nMandates which belong to these days throw a flood of light on the\r\nkind of reasoning which was held to justify these developments.\r\nThe first declares:\r\n\r\n... \"In a Republic the Sovereign Power is vested in the people,\r\nand the main principle is that all things should be determined in\r\naccordance with the desires of the majority. These desires may be\r\nembraced by two words, namely, existence and happiness. I, the\r\nPresident, came from my farm because I was unable to bear the\r\neternal sufferings of the innocent people. I assumed office and\r\ntried vainly to soothe the violent feelings. The greatest evil\r\nnowadays is the misunderstanding of true principles. The\r\nRepublicans on the pretext of public interest try to attain\r\nselfish ends, some going so far as to consider the forsaking of\r\nparents as a sign of liberty and regarding the violation of the\r\nlaws as a demonstration of equality. I will certainly do my best\r\nto change all this.\"\r\n\r\nIn the second Mandate Yuan Shih-kai justifies the re-establishment\r\nof the Confucian worship in a singular way, incidentally showing\r\nhow utterly incomprehensible to him is the idea of representative\r\ngovernment, since he would appear to have imagined that by\r\ndispatching circular telegrams to the provincial capitals and\r\nreceiving affirmative replies from his creatures all that is\r\nnecessary in the way of a national endorsement of high\r\nconstitutional measures had been obtained.\r\n\r\n... \"China's devotion to Confucius began with the reign of the\r\nEmperor Hsiaowu, of the Han dynasty, who rejected the works of the\r\nhundred authors, making the six Confucian classics the leading\r\nbooks. Confucius, born in the time of the tyranny of the nobility,\r\nin his works declared that after war disturbances comes peace, and\r\nwith peace real tranquillity and happiness. This, therefore, is\r\nthe fountain of Republicanism. After studying the history of China\r\nand consulting the opinions of scholars, I find that Confucius\r\nmust remain the teacher for thousands of generations. But in a\r\nRepublic the people possess sovereign power. Therefore circular\r\ntelegrams were dispatched to all the provinces to collect\r\nopinions, and many affirmative answers have already been received.\r\nTherefore, all colleges, schools, and public bodies are ordered to\r\nrevive the sacrificial ceremony of Confucius, which shall be\r\ncarefully and minutely ordained\" ...\r\n\r\nWith the formal promulgation of the Constitutional Compact the\r\nsituation had become bizarre in the extreme. Although even the\r\nchild-mind might have known that powers for Constitution-making\r\nwere vested solely in the National Assembly, and that the re-\r\ndivision of authority which was now made was wholly illegal,\r\nbecause Yuan Shih-kai as the bailiff of the Powers was able to do\r\nmuch as he pleased; and at a moment when Liberal Europe was on the\r\neve of plunging into the most terrible war in history in defence\r\nof right against might, reaction and Prussianism of the most\r\nrepulsive type were passed by unnoticed in China. In a few loosely\r\ndrafted chapters not only was the governance of the country\r\nrearranged to suit a purely dictational rule, but the actual\r\nParliament was permanently extinguished and replaced by a single\r\nLegislative Chamber (Li Fa Yuan) which from its very composition\r\ncould be nothing but a harmless debating Society with no greater\r\nsignificance than a dietine of one of the minor German States.\r\nMeanwhile, as there was no intention of allowing even this chamber\r\nto assemble until the last possible moment, a Senate was got\r\ntogether as the organ of public opinion, ten Senators being chosen\r\nto draft yet another Constitution which would be the final one.\r\nRemarkable steps were taken a little later in the year (1914) to\r\nsecure that the succession to the dictatorship should be left in\r\nYuan Shih-kai's own hands. An elaborate ritual was contrived and\r\nofficially promulgated under the title of the Presidential\r\nSuccession Law on the 29th December whereby the Chief Executive\r\nselected three names which were placed in a gold box in a Stone\r\nHouse in the grounds of the Palace,--the gold box only to be\r\nopened when death or incapacity deprived the nation of its self-\r\nappointed leader. For the term of the presidency was openly\r\nconverted into one of ten years and made subject to indefinite\r\nrenewal by this precious instrument which was the work of the\r\npuppet senate. In case of the necessity of an election suddenly\r\narising, an Electoral College was to be formed by fifty members\r\ndrawn from the Legislative Chamber and fifty from the Senate, the\r\nPresidential candidates consisting of the President (if he so\r\ndesired) and the three whose names were in the gold box in the\r\nStone House in the Palace grounds. It is not definitely known to\r\nwhom these provisions were due, but it is known that at least they\r\nwere not the work of the American adviser.\r\n\r\nHis responsibility, however, was very great; for the keynote of\r\nall this scheme, according to Dr. Goodnow, [Footnote: It is\r\nsignificant that Dr. Goodnow carried out all his Constitutional\r\nStudies in Germany, specializing in that department known as\r\nAdministrative Law which has no place, fortunately, in Anglo-Saxon\r\nconceptions of the State.] was \"centralization of power,\" a\r\nparrot-like phrase which has deluded better men than ever came to\r\nChina and which--save as a method necessary during a state of war\r\n--should have no place in modern politics. But it was precisely\r\nthis which appealed to Yuan Shih-kai. Although as President he was\r\nex officio Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, he now turned\r\nthis office into a direct and special organization installed\r\nwithin the precincts of the Imperial City. The flags of this new\r\ndictatorship constantly floated over his palace, whilst scores of\r\nofficers were appointed to scores of departments which were\r\ndirectly concerned with centralizing the control of every armed\r\nman in the country in the master's hands. Meanwhile in order to\r\nplacate provincial commanders, a \"Palace of Generals,\" was created\r\nin Peking to which were brought all men it was held desirable to\r\nemasculate. Here, drawing ample salaries, they could sit in\r\nidleness the livelong day, discussing the battles they had never\r\nfought and intriguing against one another, two occupations in\r\nwhich the product of the older school of men in China excels.\r\nProvincial levies which had any military virtue, were gradually\r\ndisbanded, though many of the rascals and rapscallions, who were\r\nopen menaces to good government were left with arms in their hands\r\nso as to be an argument in favour of drastic police-rule. Thus it\r\nis significant of the underlying falseness and weakness of the\r\ndictator's character that he never dared to touch the troops of\r\nthe reprobate General Chang Hsun, who had made trouble for years,\r\nand who had nearly embroiled China in war with Japan during the\r\nso-called Second Revolution (July-August, 1913) by massacring some\r\nJapanese civilians in the streets of Nanking when the city was\r\nrecaptured. So far from disbanding his men, Chang Hsun managed\r\nconstantly to increase his army of 30,000 men on the plea that the\r\npost of Inspector-General of the Yangtsze Valley, which had been\r\ngiven to him as a reward for refusing to throw in his lot with the\r\nSouthern rebels, demanded larger forces. Yuan Shih-kai, although\r\nhalf-afraid of him, found him at various periods useful as a\r\ncounterweight to other generals in the provinces; in any case he\r\nwas not the man to risk anything by attempting to crush him. As he\r\nwas planted with his men astride of the strategically important\r\nPukow railway, it was always possible to order him at a moment's\r\nnotice into the Yangtsze Valley which was thus constantly under\r\nthe menace of fire and sword.\r\n\r\nFar and wide Yuan Shih-kai now stretched his nets. He even\r\nemployed Americans throughout the United States in the capacity of\r\npress-agents in order to keep American public opinion favourable\r\nto him, hoping to invoke their assistance against his life-enemy--\r\nJapan--should that be necessary. The precise details of this\r\npropaganda and the sums spent in its prosecution are known to the\r\nwriter; if he refrains from publishing them it is solely for\r\nreasons of policy. England it was not necessary to deal with in\r\nthis way. Chance had willed that the British Representative in\r\nPeking should be an old friend who had known the Dictator\r\nintimately since his Korean days; and who faithful to the\r\nextraordinary English love of hero-worship believed that such a\r\nsurprising character could do little wrong. British policy which\r\nhas always been a somewhat variable quantity in China, owing to\r\nthe spasmodic attention devoted to such a distant problem, may be\r\nsaid to have been non-existent during all this period--a state of\r\naffairs not conducive to international happiness.\r\n\r\nSlowly the problem developed in a shiftless, irresolute way.\r\nUnable to see that China had vastly changed, and that government\r\nby rascality had become a physical and moral impossibility, the\r\nLegations in Peking adopted an attitude of indifference leaving\r\nYuan Shih-kai to wreak his will on the people. The horde of\r\nforeign advisers who had been appointed merely as a piece of\r\npolitical window-dressing, although they were allowed to do no\r\nwork, were useful in running backwards and forwards between the\r\nLegations and the Presidential headquarters and in making each\r\nPower suppose that its influence was of increasing importance. It\r\nwas made abundantly clear that in Yuan Shih-kai's estimation the\r\nLegations played in international politics much the same role that\r\nprovincial capitals did in domestic politics: so long as you bound\r\nboth to benevolent neutrality the main problem--the consolidation\r\nof dictatorial power--could be pushed on with as you wished.\r\nMoney, however, remained utterly lacking and a new twenty-five\r\nmillion sterling loan was spoken of as inevitable--the accumulated\r\ndeficit in 1914 being alone estimated at thirty-eight million\r\npounds. But although this financial dearth was annoying, Chinese\r\nresources were sufficient to allow the account to be carried on\r\nfrom day to day. Some progress was made in railways, building\r\nconcessions being liberally granted to foreign corporations, this\r\npolicy having received a great impetus from the manner in which\r\nDr. Sun Yat Sen had boomed the necessity for better communications\r\nduring the short time he had ruled at a National Railway Bureau in\r\nShanghai, an office from which he had been relieved in 1913 on it\r\nbeing discovered that he was secretly indenting for quick-firing\r\nguns. Certain questions proved annoying and insoluble, for\r\ninstance the Tibetan question concerning which England was very\r\nresolute, as well as the perpetual risings in Inner Mongolia, a\r\nregion so close to Peking that constant concentrations of troops\r\nwere necessary. But on the whole as time went on there was\r\nincreasing indifference both among the Foreign Powers and Chinese\r\nfor the extraordinary state of affairs which had been allowed to\r\ngrow up.\r\n\r\nThere was one notable exception, however, Japan. Never relaxing\r\nher grip on a complicated problem, watchful and active, where\r\nothers were indifferent and slothful, Japan bided her time.\r\nKnowing that the hour had almost arrived when it would be possible\r\nto strike, Japan was vastly active behind the scenes in China long\r\nbefore the outbreak of the European war gave her the longed for\r\nopportunity; and largely because of her the pear, which seemed\r\nalready almost ripe, finally withered on the tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE FACTOR OF JAPAN\r\n\r\n(FROM THE OUTBREAK OP THE WORLD-WAR, 1ST AUGUST, 1914, TO THE\r\nFILING OP THE TWENTY-ONE DEMANDS, 18TH JANUARY, 1915)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thunderclap of the European war shattered the uneasy calm in\r\nChina, not because the Chinese knew anything of the mighty issues\r\nwhich were to be fought out with such desperation and valour, but\r\nbecause the presence of the German colony of Kiaochow on Chinese\r\nsoil and the activity of German cruisers in the Yellow Sea brought\r\nthe war to China's very doors. Vaguely conscious that this might\r\nspell disaster to his own ambitious plans, Yuan Shih-kai was\r\nactually in the midst of tentative negotiations with the German\r\nLegation regarding the retrocession of the Kiaochow territory when\r\nthe news reached him that Japan, after some rapid negotiations\r\nwith her British Ally, had filed an ultimatum on Germany,\r\nperemptorily demanding the handing-over of all those interests\r\nthat had been forcibly acquired in Shantung province in the great\r\nleasing-year of 1898.\r\n\r\nAt once Yuan Shih-kai realized that the Nemesis which had dogged\r\nhis footsteps all his life was again close behind him. In the\r\nJapanese attack on Kiaochow he foresaw a web of complications\r\nwhich even his unrivalled diplomacy might be unable to unravel;\r\nfor he knew well from bitter experience that wherever the Japanese\r\nsets his foot there he remains. It is consequently round this\r\nsingle factor of Japan that the history of the two succeeding\r\nyears revolves. From being indisputably the central figure on the\r\nChinese canvas, Yuan Shih-kai suddenly becomes subordinate to the\r\nterror of Japanese intervention which hangs over him constantly\r\nlike a black cloud, and governs every move he made from the 15th\r\nAugust, 1914, to the day of his dramatic death on the 6th June,\r\n1916. We shall attempt to write down the true explanation of why\r\nthis should have been so.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely hard to discuss the question of Japan for the\r\nbenefit of an exclusively Western audience in a convincing way\r\nbecause Japanese policy has two distinct facets which seem utterly\r\ncontradictory, and yet which are in a great measure understandable\r\nif the objects of that diplomacy are set down. Being endowed with\r\nan extraordinary capacity for taking detached views, the Statesmen\r\nof Tokio long ago discerned the necessity of having two\r\nindependent policies--an Eastern policy for Eastern Asia and a\r\nWestern policy for Western nations--because East and West are\r\nessentially antithetical, and cannot be treated (at least not yet)\r\nin precisely the same manner. Whilst the Western policy is frank\r\nand manly, and is exclusively in the hands of brilliant and\r\nattractive men who have been largely educated in the schools of\r\nEurope and America and who are fully able to deal with all matters\r\nin accordance with the customary traditions of diplomacy, the\r\nEastern policy is the work of obscurantists whose imaginations are\r\nheld by the vast projects which the Military Party believes are\r\ncapable of realization in China. There is thus a constant\r\ncontradiction in the attitude of Japan which men have sought in\r\nvain to reconcile. It is for this reason that the outer world is\r\ndivided into two schools of thought, one believing implicitly in\r\nJapan's bona fides, the other vulgarly covering her with abuse and\r\ndeclaring that she is the last of all nations in her conceptions\r\nof fair play and honourable treatment. Both views are far-fetched.\r\nIt is as true of Japan as it is of every other Government in the\r\nworld that her actions are dictated neither by altruism nor by\r\nperfidy, but are merely the result of the faulty working of a\r\nnumber of fallible brains and as regards the work of\r\nadministration in Japan itself the position is equally\r\nextraordinary. Here, at the extreme end of the world, so far from\r\nbeing in any way threatened, the principle of Divine Right, which\r\nis being denounced and dismembered in Europe as a crude survival\r\nfrom almost heathen days, stands untouched and still exhibits\r\nitself in all its pristine glory. A highly aristocratic Court,\r\npossessing one of the most complicated and jealously protected\r\nhierarchies in the world, and presided over by a monarch claiming\r\ndirect descent from the sacred Jimmu Tenno of twenty-five hundred\r\nyears ago, decrees to-day precisely as before, the elaborate\r\nritual governing every move, every decision and every agreement.\r\nThere is something so engaging in this political curiosity,\r\nsomething so far removed from the vast world-movement now rolling\r\nfiercely to its conclusion, that we may be pardoned for\r\ninterpolating certain capital considerations which closely affect\r\nthe future of China and therefore cannot fail to be of public\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese, who owe their whole theocratic conception to the\r\nChinese, just as they owe all their letters and their learning to\r\nthem, still nominally look upon their ruler as the link between\r\nHeaven and Earth, and the central fact dominating their cosmogony.\r\nAlthough the vast number of well-educated men who to-day crowd the\r\ncities of Japan are fully conscious of the bizarre nature of this\r\nbelief in an age which has turned its back on superstition,\r\nnothing has yet been done to modify it because--and this is the\r\nimportant point--the structure of Japanese society is such that\r\nwithout a violent upheaval which shall hurl the military clan\r\nsystem irremediably to the ground, it is absolutely impossible for\r\nhuman equality to be admitted and the man-god theory to be\r\ndestroyed. So long as these two features exist; that is so long as\r\na privileged military caste supports and attempts to make all-\r\npowerful the man-god theory, so long will Japan be an\r\ninternational danger-spot because there will lack those democratic\r\nrestraints which this war has shown are absolutely essential to\r\nsecure a peaceful understanding among the nations. It is for this\r\nreason that Japan will fail to attain the position the art-genius\r\nand industry of her people entitle her to and must limp behind the\r\nprogress of the world unless a very radical revision of the\r\nconstitution is achieved. The disabilities which arise from an\r\narchaic survival are so great that they will affect China as\r\nadversely as Japan, and therefore should be universally\r\nunderstood. Japanese history, if stripped of its superficial\r\naspects, has a certain remarkable quality; it seems steeped in\r\nheroic blood. The doctrine of force, which expresses itself in its\r\ncrudest forms in Europe, has always been in Japan a system of\r\nheroic-action so fascinating to humanity at large that until\r\nrecent times its international significance has not been realized.\r\nThe feudal organization of Japanese society which arose as a\r\nresult of the armed conquest of the islands fifteen hundred years\r\nago, precluded centralizating measures being taken because the\r\nThrone, relying on the virtues of Divine Ancestors rather than on\r\nany well-articulated political theory, was weak in all except\r\ncertain quasi-sacerdotal qualities, and forced to rely on great\r\nchieftains for the execution of its mandates as well as for its\r\ndefence. The military title of \"barbarian-conquering general,\"\r\nwhich was first conferred on a great clan leader eight centuries\r\nago, was a natural enough development when we remember that the\r\nautochthonous races were even then not yet pushed out of the main\r\nisland, and were still battling with the advancing tide of\r\nJapanese civilization which was itself composed of several rival\r\nstreams coming from the Asiatic mainland and from the Malayan\r\narchipelagoes. This armed settlement saturates Japanese history\r\nand is responsible for the unending local wars and the\r\nglorification of the warrior. The conception of triumphant\r\ngeneralship which Hideyoshi attempted unsuccessfully to carry into\r\nKorea in the Sixteenth Century, led directly at the beginning of\r\nthe Seventeenth Century to the formal establishment of the\r\nShogunate, that military dictatorship being the result of the\r\nbackwash of the Korean adventure, and the greatest proof of the\r\ndisturbance which it had brought in Japanese society. The\r\npersistence of this hereditary military dictatorship for more than\r\ntwo and a half centuries is a remarkable illustration of the fact\r\nthat as in China so in Japan the theocratic conception was\r\nunworkable save in primitive times--civilization demanding\r\norganization rather than precepts and refusing to bow its head to\r\nspeechless kings. Although the Restoration of 1868 nominally gave\r\nback to the Throne all it had been forced to leave in other hands\r\nsince 1603, that transfer of power was imaginary rather than real,\r\nthe new military organization which succeeded the Shogun's\r\ngovernment being the vital portion of the Restoration. In other\r\nwords, it was the leaders of Japan's conscript armies who\r\ninherited the real power, a fact made amply evident by the\r\ncrushing of the Satsuma Rebellion by these new corps whose\r\norganization allowed them to overthrow the proudest and most\r\nvalourous of the Samurai and incidentally to proclaim the triumph\r\nof modern fire-arms.\r\n\r\nNow it is important to note that as early as 1874--that is six\r\nyears after the Restoration of the Emperor Meiji--these facts were\r\nattracting the widest notice in Japanese society, the agitation\r\nfor a Constitution and a popular assembly being very vigourously\r\npushed. Led by the well-known and aristocratic Itagaki, Japanese\r\nLiberalism had joined battle with out-and-out Imperialism more\r\nthan a quarter of a century ago; and although the question of\r\nrecovering Tariff and Judicial autonomy and revising the Foreign\r\nTreaties was more urgent in those days, the foreign question was\r\noften pushed aside by the fierceness of the constitutional\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until 1889 that a Constitution was finally\r\ngranted to the Japanese--that instrument being a gift from the\r\nCrown, and nothing more than a conditional warrant to a limited\r\nnumber of men to become witnesses of the processes of government\r\nbut in no sense its controllers. The very first Diet summoned in\r\n1890 was sufficient proof of that. A collision at once occurred\r\nover questions of finance which resulted in the resignation of the\r\nMinistry. And ever since those days, that is for twenty-seven\r\nconsecutive years, successive Diets in Japan have been fighting a\r\nforlorn fight for the power which can never be theirs save by\r\nrevolution, it being only natural that Socialism should come to be\r\nlooked upon by the governing class as Nihilism, whilst the mob-\r\nthreat has been very acute ever since the Tokio peace riots of\r\n1905.\r\n\r\nNow it is characteristic of the ceremonial respect which all\r\nJapanese have for the Throne that all through this long contest\r\nthe main issue should have been purposely obscured. The\r\ntraditional feelings of veneration which a loyal and obedient\r\npeople feel for a line of monarchs, whose origin is lost in the\r\nmists of antiquity, are such that they have turned what is in\r\neffect an evergrowing struggle against the archaic principle of\r\ndivine right into a contest with clan-leaders whom they assert are\r\nacting \"unconstitutionally\" whenever they choose to assert the\r\nundeniable principles of the Constitution. Thus to-day we have\r\nthis paradoxical situation: that although Japanese Liberalism must\r\nfrom its very essence be revolutionary, i.e., destructive before\r\nit can hope to be constructive, it feigns blindness, hoping that\r\nby suasion rather than by force the principle of parliamentary\r\ngovernment will somehow be grafted on to the body politic and the\r\nemperors, being left outside the controversy, become content to\r\naccept a greatly modified rule.\r\n\r\nThis hope seems a vain one in the light of all history. Militarism\r\nand the clans are by no means in the last ditch in Japan, and they\r\nwill no more surrender their power than would the Russian\r\nbureaucracy. The only argument which is convincing in such a case\r\nis the last one which is ever used; and the mere mention of it by\r\nso-called socialists is sufficient to cause summary arrest in\r\nJapan. Sheltering themselves behind the Throne, and nominally\r\nderiving their latter-day dictatorship from the Imperial mandate,\r\nthe military chiefs remain adamant, nothing having yet occurred to\r\nincline them to surrender any of their privileges. By a process of\r\nadaptation to present-day conditions, a formula has now been\r\ndiscovered which it is hoped will serve many a long year. By\r\nsecuring by extra-legal means the return of a \"majority\" in the\r\nHouse of Representatives the fiction of national support of the\r\nautocracy has been re-invigourated, and the doctrine laid down\r\nthat what is good for every other advanced people in the world is\r\nbad for the Japanese, who must be content with what is granted\r\nthem and never question the superior intelligence of a privileged\r\ncaste. In the opinion of the writer, it is every whit as important\r\nfor the peace of the world that the people of Japan should govern\r\nthemselves as it is for the people of Germany to do so. The\r\npersistence of the type of military government which we see to-day\r\nin Japan is harmful for all alike because it is as antiquated as\r\nTsarism and a perpetual menace to a disarmed nation such as China.\r\nSo long as that government remains, so long must Japan remain an\r\ninternational suspect and be denied equal rights in the council-\r\nchambers of the Liberal Powers.\r\n\r\nIf the situation which arose on the 15th August, 1914, is to be\r\nthoroughly understood, it is necessary to pick up threads of\r\nChino-Japanese relations from a good many years back. First-hand\r\nfamiliarity with the actors and the scenes of at least three\r\ndecades is essential to give the picture the completeness, the\r\nbrilliancy of colouring, and withal the suggestiveness inseparable\r\nfrom all true works of art. For the Chino-Japanese question is\r\nprimarily a work of art and not merely a piece of jejune diplomacy\r\nstretched across the years. As the shuttle of Fate has been cast\r\nswiftly backwards and forwards, the threads of these entwining\r\nrelations have been woven into patterns involving the whole Far\r\nEast, until to-day we have as it were a complete Gobelin tapestry,\r\nmagnificent with meaning, replete with action, and full of\r\nscholastic interest.\r\n\r\nLet us follow some of the tracery. It has long been the habit to\r\naffirm that the conflict between China and Japan had its origin in\r\nKorea, when Korea was a vassal state acknowledging the suzerainty\r\nof Peking; and that the conflict merited ending there, since of\r\nthe two protagonists contending for empire Japan was left in\r\nundisputed mastery. This statement, being incomplete, is\r\ndangerously false. Dating from that vital period of thirty years\r\nago, when Yuan Shih-kai first went to Seoul as a general officer\r\nin the train of the Chinese Imperial Resident (on China being\r\nforced to take action in protection of her interests owing to the\r\n\"opening\" of Korea by the American Treaty of 1882) three\r\ncontestants, equally interested in the balance of land-power in\r\nEastern Asia were constantly pitted against one another with Korea\r\nas their common battling-ground--Russia, China and Japan. The\r\nstruggle, which ended in the eclipse of the first two, merely\r\nshifted the venue from the Korean zone to the Manchurian zone; and\r\nfrom thence gradually extended it further and further afield until\r\nat last not only was Inner Mongolia and the vast belt of country\r\nfronting the Great Wall embraced within its scope, but the entire\r\naspect of China itself was changed. For these important facts have\r\nto be noted. Until the Russian war of 1904-05 had demonstrated the\r\nutter valuelessness of Tsarism as an international military\r\nfactor, Japan had been almost willing to resign herself to a\r\nsubordinate role in the Far East. Having eaten bitter bread as the\r\nresult of her premature attempt in 1895 (after the Korean war) to\r\nbecome a continental power--an attempt which had resulted in the\r\nforced retrocession of the Liaotung Peninsula--she had been placed\r\non her good behaviour, an attitude which was admirably reflected\r\nin 1900 when her Peking Expeditionary Force proved itself so well-\r\nbehaved and so gallant as to arouse the world's admiration. But\r\nthe war with Russia and the collapse of the Tsar's Manchurian\r\nadventure not only drew her back into territory that she never\r\nhoped to see again, but placed her in possession of a ready-made\r\nrailway system which carried her almost up to the Sungari river\r\nand surrendered to her military control vast grasslands stretching\r\nto the Khingan mountains. This Westernly march so greatly enlarged\r\nthe Japanese political horizon, and so entirely changed the\r\nJapanese viewpoint, that the statesmen of Tokio in their\r\nexcitement threw off their ancient spectacles and found to their\r\nastonishment that their eyes were every whit as good as European\r\neyes. Now seeing the world as others had long seen it, they\r\nunderstood that just as with the individuals so with nations the\r\nstruggle for existence can most easily be conducted by adopting\r\nthat war-principle of Clausewitz--the restless offensive, and not\r\nby writing meaningless dispatches. Prior to the Russian war they\r\nhad written to Russia a magnificent series of documents in which\r\nthey had pleaded with sincerity for an equitable settlement,--\r\nonly to find that all was in vain. Forced to battle, they had\r\nfound in combat not only success but a new principle.\r\n\r\nThe discovery necessitated a new policy. During the eighties, and\r\nin a lesser degree in the nineties, Japan had apart from\r\neverything else been content to act in a modest and retiring way,\r\nbecause she wished at all costs to avoid testing too severely her\r\nimmature strength. But owing to the successive collapses of her\r\nrivals, she now found herself not only forced to attack as the\r\nsafest course of action, but driven to the view that the Power\r\nthat exerts the maximum pressure constantly and unremittedly is\r\ninevitably the most successful. This conclusion had great\r\nimportance. For just as the first article of faith for England in\r\nAsia has been the doctrine that no Power can be permitted to seize\r\nstrategic harbours which menace her sea-communications, so did it\r\nnow become equally true of Japan that her dominant policy became\r\nnot an Eastern Monroe doctrine, as shallow men have supposed, but\r\nsimply the Doctrine of Maximum Pressure. To press with all her\r\nstrength on China was henceforth considered vital by every\r\nJapanese; and it's in this spirit that every diplomatic pattern\r\nhas been woven since the die was cast in 1905. Until this signal\r\nfact has been grasped no useful analysis can be made of the\r\nevolution of present conditions. Standing behind this policy, and\r\nconstantly reinforcing it, are the serried ranks of the new\r\ndemocracy which education and the great increase in material\r\nprosperity have been so rapidly creating. The soaring ambition\r\nwhich springs from the sea lends to the attacks developed by such\r\na people the aspect of piracies; and it is but natural in such\r\ncircumstances that for Chinese Japan should not only have the\r\naspect of a sea-monster but that their country should appear as\r\nhapless Andromeda bound to a rock, always awaiting a Perseus who\r\nnever comes. ...\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1911 had been entirely unexpected in Japan.\r\nWhilst large outbreaks had been certainly counted on since the\r\nChinese Revolutionary party had for years used Japan as an asylum\r\nand a base of operations, never had it been anticipated that the\r\nfall of an ancient Dynasty could be so easily encompassed.\r\nConsequently, the abdication of the Manchus as the result of\r\nintrigues rather than of warfare was looked upon as little short\r\nof a catastrophe because it hopelessly complicated the outlook,\r\nbroke the pattern which had been so carefully woven for so many\r\nyears, and interjected harsh elements which could not be assigned\r\nan orderly place. Not only was a well-articulated State-system\r\nsuddenly consigned to the flames, but the ruin threatened to be so\r\ngeneral that the balance of power throughout the Far East would be\r\ntwisted out of shape. Japanese statesmen had desired a weak China,\r\na China which would ultimately turn to them for assistance because\r\nthey were a kindred race, but not a China that looked to the\r\nFrench Revolution for its inspiration. To a people as slow to\r\nadjust themselves to violent surprises as are the Japanese, there\r\nwas an air of desperation about the whole business which greatly\r\nalarmed them, and made them determined at the earliest possible\r\nmoment to throw every ounce of their weight in the direction which\r\nwould best serve them by bringing matters back to their original\r\nstarting-point. For this reason they were not only prepared in\r\ntheory in 1911 to lend armed assistance to the Manchus but would\r\nhave speedily done so had not England strongly dissented from such\r\na course of action when she was privately sounded about the\r\nmatter. Even to-day, when a temporary adjustment of Japanese\r\npolicy has been successfully arranged, it is of the highest\r\nimportance for political students to remember that the dynastic\r\ninfluences in Tokio have never departed from the view that the\r\nlegitimate sovereignty of China remains vested in the Manchu House\r\nand that everything that has taken place since 1911 is irregular\r\nand unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, however, two dissimilar circumstances demanded\r\ncaution: first, the enthusiasm which the Japanese democracy, fed\r\nby a highly excited press, exhibited towards the Young China which\r\nhad been so largely grounded in the Tokio schools and which had\r\ncarried out the Revolution: secondly--and far more important--the\r\ndeep, abiding and ineradicable animosity which Japanese of all\r\nclasses felt for the man who had come out of the contest head and\r\nshoulders above everybody else--Yuan Shih-kai. These two\r\nremarkable features ended by completely thrusting into the\r\nbackground during the period 1911-1914 every other element in\r\nJapanese statesmanship; and of the two the second must be counted\r\nthe decisive one. Dating back to Korea, when Yuan Shih-kai's\r\nextraordinary diplomatic talents constantly allowed him to worst\r\nhis Japanese rivals and to make Chinese counsels supreme at the\r\nKorean Court up to the very moment when the first shots of the war\r\nof 1894 were fired, this ancient dislike, which amounted to a\r\nconsuming hatred, had become a fixed idea. Restrained by the\r\nworld's opinion during the period prior to the outbreak of the\r\nworld-war as well as by the necessity of acting financially in\r\nconcert with the other Powers, it was not until August, 1914, that\r\nthe longed-for opportunity came and that Japan prepared to act in\r\na most remarkable way.\r\n\r\nThe campaign against Kiaochow was unpopular from the outset among\r\nthe Japanese public because it was felt that they were not\r\nlegitimately called upon to interest themselves in such a remote\r\nquestion as the balance of power among European nations, which was\r\nwhat British warfare against Germany seemed to them to be. Though\r\nsome ill-will was felt against Germany for the part played by her\r\nin the intervention of 1895, it must not be forgotten that just as\r\nthe Japanese navy is the child of the British navy, so is the\r\nJapanese army the child of the German army--and that Japanese army\r\nchiefs largely control Japan. These men were averse from \"spoiling\r\ntheir army\" in a contest which did not interest them. There was\r\nalso the feeling abroad that England by calling upon her Ally to\r\ncarry out the essential provisions of her Alliance had shown that\r\nshe had the better part of a bargain, and that she was exploiting\r\nan old advantage in a way which could not fail to react adversely\r\non Japan's future world's relationships. Furthermore, it is\r\nnecessary to underline the fact that official Japan was displeased\r\nby the tacit support an uninterested British Foreign Office had\r\nconsistently given to the Yuan Shih-kai regime. That the Chinese\r\nexperiment was looked upon in England more with amusement than\r\nwith concern irritated the Japanese--more particularly as the\r\nBritish Foreign Office was issuing in the form of White Papers\r\ndocuments covering Yuan Shih-kai's public declarations as if they\r\nwere contributions to contemporary history. Thus in the preceding\r\nyear (1913) under the nomenclature of \"affairs in China\" the text\r\nof a dementi regarding the President of China's Imperial\r\naspirations had been published,--a document which Japanese had\r\nclassified as a studied lie, and as an act of presumption because\r\nits wording showed that its author intended to keep his back\r\nturned on Japan. The Dictator had declared:--\r\n\r\n... \"From my student days, I, Yuan Shih-kai, have admired the\r\nexample of the Emperors Yao and Shun, who treated the empire as a\r\npublic trust, and considered that the record of a dynasty in\r\nhistory for good or ill is inseparably bound up with the public\r\nspirit or self-seeking by which it has been animated. On attaining\r\nmiddle age I grew more familiar with foreign affairs, was struck\r\nby the admirable republican system in France and America, and felt\r\nthat they were a true embodiment of the democratic precepts of the\r\nancients. When last year the patriotic crusade started in Wuchang\r\nits echoes went forth into all the provinces, with the result that\r\nthis ancient nation with its 2,000 years of despotism adopted with\r\none bound the republican system of government.\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune to see this glorious day at my life's late\r\neve; I cherished the hope that I might dwell in the seclusion of\r\nmy own home and participate in the blessings of an age of peace.\r\n\r\nBut once again my fellow-countrymen honoured me with the pressing\r\nrequest that I should again assume a heavy burden, and on the day\r\non which the Republic was proclaimed I announced it the whole\r\nnation that never again should a monarchy be permitted in China.\r\nAt my inauguration I again took this solemn oath in the sight of\r\nheaven above and earth beneath. Yet of late ignorant persons in\r\nthe provinces have fabricated wild rumours to delude men's minds,\r\nand have adduced the career of the First Napoleon on which to base\r\ntheir erroneous speculations. It is best not to inquire as to\r\ntheir motives; in some cases misconception may be the cause, in\r\nothers deliberate malice.\r\n\r\nThe Republic has now been proclaimed for six months; so far there\r\nis no prospect of recognition from the Powers, while order is far\r\nfrom being restored in the provinces. Our fate hangs upon a hair;\r\nthe slightest negligence may forfeit all. I, who bear this arduous\r\nresponsibility, feel it my bounden duty to stand at the helm in\r\nthe hope of successfully breasting the wild waves.\r\n\r\nBut while those in office are striving with all their might to\r\neffect a satisfactory solution, spectators seem to find a\r\ndifficulty in maintaining a generous forbearance. They forget that\r\nI, who have received this charge from my countrymen, cannot\r\npossibly look dispassionately on when the fate of the nation is in\r\nthe balance. If I were aware that the task was impossible and\r\nplayed a part of easy acquiescence, so that the future of the\r\nRepublic might become irreparable, others might not reproach me,\r\nbut my own conscience would never leave me alone.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts are manifest in the sight of high heaven. But at this\r\nseason of construction and dire crisis how shall these mutual\r\nsuspicions find a place? Once more I issue this announcement; if\r\nyou, my fellow countrymen, do indeed place the safety of China\r\nbefore all other considerations, it behooves you to be large-\r\nminded. Beware of lightly heeding the plausible voice of calumny,\r\nand of thus furnishing a medium for fostering anarchy. If evilly\r\ndisposed persons, who are bent on destruction, seize the excuse\r\nfor sowing dissension to the jeopardy of the situation, I, Yuan\r\nShih-kai, shall follow the behest of my fellow-countrymen in\r\nplacing such men beyond the pale of humanity.\r\n\r\nA vital issue is involved. It is my duty to lay before you my\r\ninmost thought, so that suspicion may be dissipated. Those who\r\nknow have the right to impose their censure. It is for public\r\nopinion to take due notice.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover Yuan Shih-kai had also shown in his selection and use of\r\nforeign Advisers, that he was determined to proceed in such a\r\nmanner as to advertise his suspicion and enmity of Japan. After\r\nthe Coup d'etat of the 4th November, 1913, and the scattering of\r\nParliament, it was an American Adviser who was set to work on the\r\nnew \"Constitution\"; and although a Japanese, Dr. Ariga, who was in\r\nreceipt of a princely salary, aided and abetted this work, his\r\nendorsement of the dictatorial rule was looked upon as traitorous\r\nby the bulk of his countrymen. Similarly, it was perfectly well-\r\nknown that Yuan Shih-kai was spending large sums of money in Tokio\r\nin bribing certain organs of the Japanese Press and in attempting\r\nto win adherents among Japanese members of Parliament. Remarkable\r\nstories are current which compromise very highly-placed Japanese\r\nbut which the writer hesitates to set down in black and white as\r\ndocumentary proof is not available. In any case, be this as it\r\nmay, it was felt in Tokio that the time had arrived to give a\r\nproper definition to the relations between the two states,--the\r\nmore so as Yuan Shih-kai, by publicly proclaiming a small war-zone\r\nin Shantung within the limits of which the Japanese were alone\r\npermitted to wage war against the Germans, had shown himself\r\nindifferent to the majesty of Japan. The Japanese having captured\r\nKiaochow by assault before the end of 1914 decided to accept the\r\nview that a de facto Dictatorship existed in China. Therefore on\r\nthe 18th of January, 1915, the Japanese Minister, Dr. Hioki,\r\npersonally served on Yuan Shih-kai the now famous Twenty-one\r\nDemands, a list designed to satisfy every present and future need\r\nof Japanese policy and to reduce China to a state of vassalage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE TWENTY-ONE DEMANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the press of the world gave a certain prominence at the\r\ntime to the astounding demarche with which we now have to deal,\r\nthere was such persistent mystery about the matter and so many\r\nofficial dementis accompanied every publication of the facts that\r\neven to this day the nature of the assault which Japan delivered\r\non China is not adequately realized, nor is the narrow escape\r\nassigned its proper place in estimates of the future. Briefly, had\r\nthere not been publication of the facts and had not British\r\ndiplomacy been aroused to action there is little doubt that Japan\r\nwould have forced matters so far that Chinese independence would\r\nnow be virtually a thing of the past. Fortunately, however, China\r\nin her hour of need found many who were willing to succour her;\r\nwith the result that although she lost something in these\r\nnegotiations, Japan nevertheless failed in a very signal fashion\r\nto attain her main objective. The Pyrrhic victory which she won\r\nwith her eleventh hour ultimatum will indeed in the end cost her\r\nmore than would have a complete failure, for Chinese suspicion and\r\nhostility are now so deep-seated that nothing will ever completely\r\neradicate them. It is therefore only proper that an accurate\r\nrecord should be here incorporated of a chapter of history which\r\nhas much international importance; and if we invite close\r\nattention to the mass of documents that follow it is because we\r\nhold that an adequate comprehension of them is essential to\r\nsecuring the future peace of the Far East. Let us first give the\r\nofficial text of the original Demands:\r\n\r\nJAPAN'S ORIGINAL TWENTY-ONE DEMANDS\r\n\r\nTranslations of Documents Handed to the President, Yuan shih-kai,\r\nby Mr. Hioki, the Japanese Minister, on January 18th, 1915.\r\n\r\nGROUP I\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government and the Chinese Government being desirous\r\nof maintaining the general peace in Eastern Asia and further\r\nstrengthening the friendly relations and good neighbourhood\r\nexisting between the two nations agree to the following articles:--\r\n\r\nArticle 1. The Chinese Government engages to give full assent to\r\nall matters upon which the Japanese Government may hereafter agree\r\nwith the German Government relating to the disposition of all\r\nrights, interests and concessions, which Germany, by virtue of\r\ntreaties or otherwise, possesses in relation to the Province of\r\nShantung.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. The Chinese Government engages that within the Province\r\nof Shantung and along its coast no territory or island will be\r\nceded or leased to a third Power under any pretext.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. The Chinese Government consents to Japan's building a\r\nrailway from Chefoo or Lungkow to join the Kiaochou-Tsinanfu\r\nrailway.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. The Chinese Government engages, in the interest of\r\ntrade and for the residence of foreigners, to open by herself as\r\nsoon as possible certain important cities and towns in the\r\nProvince of Shantung as Commercial Ports. What places shall be\r\nopened are to be jointly decided upon in a separate agreement.\r\n\r\nGROUP II\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government and the Chinese Government, since the\r\nChinese Government has always acknowledged the special position\r\nenjoyed by Japan in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia,\r\nagree to the following articles:--\r\n\r\nArticle 1. The two Contracting Parties mutually agree that the\r\nterm of lease of Port Arthur and Dalny and the term of lease of\r\nthe South Manchurian Railway and the Antung-Mukden Railway shall\r\nbe extended to the period of 99 years.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. Japanese subjects in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner\r\nMongolia shall have the right to lease or own land required either\r\nfor erecting suitable buildings for trade and manufacture or for\r\nfarming.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. Japanese subjects shall be free to reside and travel in\r\nSouth Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia and to engage in\r\nbusiness and in manufacture of any kind whatsoever.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. The Chinese Government agrees to grant to Japanese\r\nsubjects the right of opening the mines in South Manchuria and\r\nEastern Inner Mongolia. As regards what mines are to be opened,\r\nthey shall be decided upon jointly.\r\n\r\nArticle 5. The Chinese Government agrees that in respect of the\r\n(two) cases mentioned herein below the Japanese Government's\r\nconsent shall be first obtained before action is taken:--\r\n\r\n(a) Whenever permission is granted to the subject of a third Power\r\nto build a railway or to make a loan with a third Power for the\r\npurpose of building a railway in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner\r\nMongolia.\r\n\r\n(b) Whenever a loan is to be made with a third Power pledging the\r\nlocal taxes of South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia as\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nArticle 6. The Chinese Government agrees that if the Chinese\r\nGovernment employs political, financial or military advisers or\r\ninstructors in South Manchuria or Eastern Inner Mongolia, the\r\nJapanese Government shall first be consulted.\r\n\r\nArticle 7. The Chinese Government agrees that the control and\r\nmanagement of the Kirin-Changchun Railway shall be handed over to\r\nthe Japanese Government for a term of 99 years dating from the\r\nsigning of this Agreement.\r\n\r\nGROUP III\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government and the Chinese Government, seeing that\r\nJapanese financiers and the Hanyehping Co. have dose relations\r\nwith each other at present and desiring that the common interests\r\nof the two nations shall be advanced, agree to the following\r\narticles:--\r\n\r\nArticle 1. The two Contracting Parties mutually agree that when\r\nthe opportune moment arrives the Hanyehping Company shall be made\r\na joint concern of the two nations and they further agree that\r\nwithout the previous consent of Japan, China shall not by her own\r\nact dispose of the rights and property of whatsoever nature of the\r\nsaid Company nor cause the said Company to dispose freely of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. The Chinese Government agrees that all mines in the\r\nneighbourhood of those owned by the Hanyehping Company shall not\r\nbe permitted, without the consent of the said Company, to be\r\nworked by other persons outside of the said Company; and further\r\nagrees that if it is desired to carry out any undertaking which,\r\nit is apprehended, may directly or indirectly affect the interests\r\nof the said Company, the consent of the said Company shall first\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\nGROUP IV\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government and the Chinese Government with the object\r\nof effectively preserving the territorial integrity of China agree\r\nto the following special articles:--\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government engages not to cede or lease to a third\r\nPower any harbour or bay or island along the coast of China.\r\n\r\nGROUP V\r\n\r\nArticle 1. The Chinese Central Government shall employ influential\r\nJapanese advisers in political, financial and military affairs.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. Japanese hospitals, churches and schools in the\r\ninterior of China shall be granted the right of owning land.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. Inasmuch as the Japanese Government and the Chinese\r\nGovernment have had many cases of dispute between Japanese and\r\nChinese police to settle cases which caused no little\r\nmisunderstanding, it is for this reason necessary that the police\r\ndepartments of important places (in China) shall be jointly\r\nadministered by Japanese and Chinese or that the police\r\ndepartments of these places shall employ numerous Japanese, so\r\nthat they may at the same time help to plan for the improvement of\r\nthe Chinese Police Service.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. China shall purchase from Japan a fixed amount of\r\nmunitions of war (say 50% or more) of what is needed by the\r\nChinese Government or that there shall be established in China a\r\nSino-Japanese jointly worked arsenal. Japanese technical experts\r\nare to be employed and Japanese material to be purchased.\r\n\r\nArticle 5. China agrees to grant to Japan the right of\r\nconstructing a railway connecting Wuchang with Kiukiang and\r\nNanchang, another line between Nanchang and Hanchow, and another\r\nbetween Nanchang and Chaochou.\r\n\r\nArticle 6. If China needs foreign capital to work mines, build\r\nrailways and construct harbour-works (including dock-yards) in the\r\nProvinces of Fukien, Japan shall be first consulted.\r\n\r\nArticle 7. China agrees that Japanese subjects shall have the\r\nright of missionary propaganda in China. [Footnote: Refers to\r\npreaching Buddhism.]\r\n\r\nThe five groups into which the Japanese divided their demands\r\npossess a remarkable interest not because of their sequence, or\r\nthe style of their phraseology, but because every word reveals a\r\npeculiar and very illuminating chemistry of the soul. To study the\r\noriginal Chinese text is to pass as it were into the secret\r\nrecesses of the Japanese brain, and to find in that darkened\r\nchamber a whole world of things which advertise ambitions mixed\r\nwith limitations, hesitations overwhelmed by audacities,\r\ngreatnesses succumbing to littlenesses, and vanities having the\r\nappearance of velleities. Given an intimate knowledge of Far\r\nEastern politics and Far Eastern languages, only a few minutes are\r\nrequired to re-write the demands in the sequence in which they\r\nwere originally conceived as well as to trace the natural history\r\nof their genesis. Unfortunately a great deal is lost in their\r\nofficial translation, and the menace revealed in the Chinese\r\noriginal partly cloaked: for by transferring Eastern thoughts into\r\nWestern moulds, things that are like nails in the hands of soft\r\nsensitive Oriental beings are made to appear to the steel-clad\r\nWest as cold-blooded, evolutionary necessities which may be\r\nrepellent but which are never cruel. The more the matter is\r\nstudied the more convinced must the political student be that in\r\nthis affair of the 18th January we have an international coup\r\ndestined to become classic in the new text-books of political\r\nscience. All the way through the twenty-one articles it is easy to\r\nsee the desire for action, the love of accomplished facts,\r\nstruggling with the necessity to observe the conventions of a\r\nstereotyped diplomacy and often overwhelming those conventions. As\r\nthe thoughts thicken and the plot develops, the effort to mask the\r\nreal intention lying behind every word plainly breaks down, and a\r\ngrowing exultation rings louder and louder as if the coveted\r\nChinese prize were already firmly grasped. One sees as it were the\r\nJapanese nation, released from bondage imposed by the Treaties\r\nwhich have been binding on all nations since 1860, swarming madly\r\nthrough the breached walls of ancient Cathay and disputing hotly\r\nthe spoils of age-old domains.\r\n\r\nGroup I, which deals with the fruits of victory in Shantung, has\r\nlittle to detain us since events which have just unrolled there\r\nhave already told the story of those demands. In Shantung we have\r\na simple and easily-understood repeated performance of the\r\nhistory of 1905 and the settlement of the Russo-Japanese War.\r\nPlaced at the very head of the list of demands, though its\r\nlegitimate position should be after Manchuria, obviously the\r\npurpose of Group I is conspicuously to call attention to the fact\r\nthat Japan had been at war with Germany, and is still at war with\r\nher. This flourish of trumpets, after the battle is over, however,\r\nscarcely serves to disguise that the fate of Shantung, following\r\nso hard on the heels of the Russian debacle in Manchuria, is the\r\ngreat moral which Western peoples are called upon to note. Japan,\r\ndetermined as she has repeatedly announced to preserve the peace\r\nof the Orient by any means she deems necessary, has found the one\r\nand only formula that is satisfactory--that of methodically\r\nannexing everything worth fighting about.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. The insertion of a special preamble to Group II,\r\nwhich covers not only South Manchuria but Eastern Inner Mongolia\r\nas well, is an ingenious piece of work since it shows that the hot\r\nmood of conquest suitable for Shantung must be exchanged for a\r\ncertain judicial detachment. The preamble undoubtedly betrays the\r\nguiding hand of Viscount Kato, the then astute Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs, who saturated in the great series of international\r\nundertakings made by Japan since the first Anglo-Japanese Treaty\r\nof 1902, clearly believes that the stately Elizabethan manner\r\nwhich still characterizes British official phrasing is an\r\nadmirable method to be here employed. The preamble is quite\r\nEnglish; it is so English that one is almost lulled into believing\r\nthat one's previous reasoning has been at fault and that Japan is\r\nonly demanding what she is entitled to. Yet study Group II closely\r\nand subtleties gradually emerge. By boldly and categorically\r\nplacing Eastern Inner Mongolia on precisely the same footing as\r\nSouthern Manchuria--though they have nothing in common--the\r\nassumption is made that the collapse in 1908 of the great Anglo-\r\nAmerican scheme to run a neutral railway up the flank of Southern\r\nManchuria to Northern Manchuria (the once celebrated Chinchow-\r\nAigun scheme), coupled with general agreement with Russia which\r\nwas then arrived at, now impose upon China the necessity of\r\npublicly resigning herself to a Japanese overlordship of that\r\nregion. In other words, the preamble of Group II lays down that\r\nEastern Inner Mongolia has become part and parcel of the\r\nManchurian Question because Japan has found a parallel for what\r\nshe is doing in the acts of European Powers.\r\n\r\nThese things, however, need not detain us. Not that Manchuria or\r\nthe adjoining Mongolian plain is not important; not that the\r\nthreads of destiny are not woven thickly there. For it is certain\r\nthat the vast region immediately beyond the Great Wall of China is\r\nthe Flanders of the Far East--and that the next inevitable war\r\nwhich will destroy China or make her something of a nation must be\r\nfought on that soil just as two other wars have been fought there\r\nduring the past twenty years. But this does not belong to\r\ncontemporary politics; it is possibly an affair of the Chinese\r\narmy of 1925 or 1935. Some day China will fight for Manchuria, if\r\nit is impossible to recover it in any other way,--nobody need\r\ndoubt that. For Manchuria is absolutely Chinese--people must\r\nremember. No matter how far the town-dwelling Japanese may invade\r\nthe country during the next two or three decades, no matter what\r\nlarge alien garrisons may be planted there, the Chinese must and\r\nwill remain the dominant racial element, since their population\r\nwhich already numbers twenty-five millions is growing at the rate\r\nof half a million a year, and in a few decades will equal the\r\npopulation of a first-class European Power.\r\n\r\nWhen we reach Group III we touch matters that are not only\r\nimmediately vital but quite new in their type of audacity and\r\nwhich every one can to-day understand since they are politico-\r\nindustrial. Group III, as it stands in the original text, is\r\nSIMPLY THE PLAN FOR THE CONQUEST OF THE MINERAL WEALTH OF THE\r\nYANGTSZE VALLEY which mainly centres round Hankow because the vast\r\nalluvial plains of the lower reaches of this greatest of rivers\r\nwere once the floor of the Yellow Sea, the upper provinces of\r\nHupeh, Hunan, Kiangsi being the region of prehistoric forests\r\nclothing the coasts, which once looked down upon the slowly-\r\nreceding waste of waters, and which to-day contain all the coal\r\nand iron. Hitherto every one has always believed that the Yang\r\ntsze Valley was par excellence the British sphere in China; and\r\nevery one has always thought that that belief was enough. It is\r\ntrue that political students, going carefully over all published\r\ndocuments, have ended their search by declaring that the matter\r\ncertainly required further elucidation. To be precise, this so-\r\ncalled British sphere is not an enclave at all in the proper\r\nsense; indeed it can only seem one to those who still believe that\r\nit is still possible to pre-empt provinces by ministerial\r\ndeclarations. The Japanese have been the first to dare to say that\r\nthe preconceived general belief was stupid. They know, of course,\r\nthat it was a British force which invaded the Yangtsze Valley\r\nseventy-five years ago, and forced the signature of the Treaty of\r\nNanking which first opened China to the world's trade; but they\r\nare by no means impressed with the rights which that action has\r\nbeen held to confer, since the mineral resources of this region\r\nare priceless in their eyes and must somehow be won.\r\n\r\nThe study of twenty years of history proves this assumption to be\r\ncorrect. Ever since 1895, Japan has been driving wedges into the\r\nYangtsze Valley of a peculiar kind to form the foundations for her\r\nsweeping claims of 1915. Thus after the war with China in 1894-95,\r\nshe opened by her Treaty of Peace four ports in the Yangtsze\r\nValley region, Soochow, Hangchow, Chungking and Shasi; that is, at\r\nthe two extreme ends of the valley she established politico-\r\ncommercial points d'appui from which to direct her campaign.\r\nWhilst the proximity of Soochow and Hangchow to the British\r\nstronghold of Shanghai made it difficult to carry out any\r\n\"penetration\" work at the lower end of the river save in the form\r\nof subsidized steam-shipping, the case was different in Hunan and\r\nHupeh provinces. There she was unendingly busy, and in 1903 by a\r\nfresh treaty she formally opened to trade Changsha, the capital of\r\nthe turbulent Hunan province. Changsha for years remained a secret\r\ncentre possessing the greatest political importance for her, and\r\nserving as a focus for most varied activities involving Hunan,\r\nHupeh, and Kiangsi, as well as a vast hinterland. The great Tayeh\r\niron-mines, although entirely Chinese-owned, were already being\r\ntapped to supply iron-ore for the Japanese Government Foundry at\r\nWakamatsu on the island of Kiushiu. The rich coal mines of\r\nPinghsiang, being conveniently near, supplied the great Chinese\r\nGovernment arsenal of Hanyang with fuel; and since Japan had very\r\nlittle coal or iron of her own, she decided that it would be best\r\nto embrace as soon as possible the whole area of interests in one\r\ncategorical demand--that is to claim a dominant share in the\r\nHanyang arsenal, the Tayeh iron-mines and the Ping-hsiang\r\ncollieries. [Footnote: The reader will observe, that the\r\nexpression \"Hanyehping enterprises\" is compounded by linking\r\ntogether characters denoting the triple industry.] By lending\r\nmoney to these enterprises, which were grouped together under the\r\nname of Hanyehping, she had early established a claim on them\r\nwhich she turned at the psychological moment into an international\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nWe can pass quickly by Group IV which is of little importance,\r\nexcept to say that in taking upon herself, without consultation\r\nwith the senior ally, the duty of asking from China a declaration\r\nconcerning the future non-leasing of harbours and islands, Japan\r\nhas attempted to assume a protectorship of Chinese territory which\r\ndoes not belong to her historically. It is well also to note that\r\nalthough Japan wished it to appear to the world that this action\r\nwas dictated by her desire to prevent Germany from acquiring a\r\nfresh foothold in China after the war, in reality Group IV was\r\ndrafted as a general warning to the nations, one point being that\r\nshe believed that the United States was contemplating the\r\nreorganization of the Foochow Arsenal in Fuhkien province, and\r\nthat as a corollary to that reorganization would be given the\r\nlease of an adjoining harbour such as Santuao.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, until we reach Group V that the real purpose\r\nof the Japanese demands becomes unalterably clear, for in this\r\nGroup we have seven sketches of things designed to serve as the\r\ncoup de grace. Not only is a new sphere--Fuhkien province--\r\nindicated; not only is the mid-Yangtsze, from the vicinity of\r\nKiukiang, to serve as the terminus for a system of Japanese\r\nrailways, radiating from the great river to the coasts of South\r\nChina; but the gleaming knife of the Japanese surgeon is to aid\r\nthe Japanese teacher in the great work of propaganda; the Japanese\r\nmonk and the Japanese policeman are to be dispersed like\r\nskirmishers throughout the land; Japanese arsenals are to supply\r\nall the necessary arms, or failing that a special Japanese arsenal\r\nis to be established; Japanese advisers are to give the necessary\r\nadvice in finance, in politics, in every department--foreshadowing\r\na complete and all embracing political control. Never was a more\r\nsweeping program of supervision presented, and small wonder if\r\nChinese when they learnt of this climax exclaimed that the fate of\r\nKorea was to be their own. For a number of weeks after the\r\npresentation of these demands everything remained clothed in\r\nimpenetrable mystery, and despite every effort on the part of\r\ndiplomatists reliable details of what was occurring could not be\r\nobtained. Gradually, however, the admission was forced that the\r\nsecrecy being preserved was due to the Japanese threat that\r\npublicity would be met with the harshest reprisals; and presently\r\nthe veil was entirely lifted by newspaper publication and foreign\r\nAmbassadors began making inquiries in Tokio. The nature and scope\r\nof the Twenty-one Demands could now be no longer hidden; and in\r\nresponse to the growing indignation which began to be voiced by\r\nthe press and the pressure which British diplomacy brought to\r\nbear, Japan found it necessary to modify some of the most\r\nimportant items. She had held twenty-four meetings at the Chinese\r\nForeign Office, and although the Chinese negotiators had been\r\nforced to give way in such matters as extending the \"leasing\"\r\nperiods of railways and territories in Manchuria and in admitting\r\nthe Japanese right to succeed to all German interests and rights\r\nin Shantung (Group I and II), in the essential matters of the\r\nHanyehping concessions (Group III) and the noxious demands of\r\nGroup V China had stood absolutely firm, declining even to discuss\r\nsome of the items.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Japanese diplomacy was forced to re-state and re-group\r\nthe whole corpus of the demands. On the 26th April, acting under\r\ndirect instructions from Tokio, the Japanese Minister to Peking\r\npresented a revised list for renewed consideration, the demands\r\nbeing expanded to twenty-four articles (in place of the original\r\ntwenty-one largely because discussion had shown the necessity of\r\nbreaking up into smaller units some of the original articles).\r\nMost significant, however, is the fact that Group V, (which in its\r\noriginal form was a more vicious assault on Chinese sovereignty\r\nthan the Austrian Ultimatum to Serbia of June, 1914) was so\r\nremodelled as to convey a very different meaning, the group\r\nheading disappearing entirely and an innocent-looking exchange of\r\nnotes being asked for. It is necessary to recall that, when taxed\r\nwith making Demands which were entirely in conflict with the\r\nspirit of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the Japanese Government\r\nthrough its ambassadors abroad had categorically denied that they\r\nhad ever laid any such Demands on the Chinese Government. It was\r\nclaimed that there had never been twenty-one Demands, as the\r\nChinese alleged, but only fourteen, the seven items of Group V\r\nbeing desiderata which it was in the interests of china to endorse\r\nbut which Japan had no intention of forcing upon her. The writer,\r\nbeing acquainted from first to last with everything that took\r\nplace in Peking from the 18th January to the filing of the\r\nJapanese ultimatum of the 7th May, has no hesitation in\r\nstigmatising this statement as false. The whole aim and object of\r\nthese negotiations was to force through Group V. Japan would have\r\ngladly postponed sine die the discussion of all the other Groups\r\nhad China assented to provisions which would have made her\r\nindependence a thing of the past. Every Chinese knew that, in the\r\nmain, Group V was simply a repetition of the measures undertaken\r\nin Korea after the Russo-Japanese war of 1905 as a forerunner to\r\nannexation; and although obviously in the case of China no such\r\nrapid surgery could be practised, the endorsement of these\r\nmeasures would have meant a virtual Japanese Protectorate. Even a\r\ncursory study of the text that follows will confirm in every\r\nparticular these capital contentions:\r\n\r\nJAPAN'S REVISED DEMANDS\r\n\r\nJapan's Revised Demands on China, twenty-four in all, presented\r\nApril 26, 1915.\r\n\r\nNOTE ON ORIGINAL TEXT:\r\n\r\n[The revised list of articles is a Chinese translation of the\r\nJapanese text. It is hereby declared that when a final decision is\r\nreached, there shall be a revision of the wording of the text.]\r\n\r\nGROUP I\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government and the Chinese Government, being desirous\r\nof maintaining the general peace in Eastern Asia and further\r\nstrengthening the friendly relations and good neighbourhood\r\nexisting between the two nations, agree to the following\r\narticles:--\r\n\r\nArticle 1. The Chinese Government engages to give full assent to\r\nall matters upon which the Japanese Government may hereafter agree\r\nwith the German Government, relating to the disposition of all\r\nrights, interests and concessions, which Germany, by virtue of\r\ntreaties or otherwise, possesses in relation to the Province of\r\nShangtung.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. (Changed into an exchange of notes.)\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government declares that within the Province of\r\nShantung and along its coast no territory or island will be ceded\r\nor leased to any Power under any pretext.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. The Chinese Government consents that as regards the\r\nrailway to be built by China herself from Chefoo or Lung kow to\r\nconnect with the Kiaochow-Tsinanfu Railway, if Germany is willing\r\nto abandon the privilege of financing the Chefoo-Weihsien line.\r\nChina will approach Japanese capitalists to negotiate for a loan.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. The Chinese Government engages, in the interest of\r\ntrade and for the residence of foreigners, to open by China\r\nherself as soon as possible certain suitable places in the\r\nProvince of Shantung as Commercial Ports.\r\n\r\n(Supplementary Exchange of Notes)\r\n\r\nThe places which ought to be opened are to be chosen and the\r\nregulations are to be drafted, by the Chinese Government, but the\r\nJapanese Minister must be consulted before making a decision.\r\n\r\nGROUP II\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government and the Chinese Government, with a view to\r\ndeveloping their economic relations in South Manchuria and Eastern\r\nInner Mongolia, agree to the following articles:--\r\n\r\nArticle 1. The two contracting Powers mutually agree that the term\r\nof lease of Port Arthur and Dalny and the terms of the South\r\nManchuria Railway and the Antung-Mukden Railway shall be extended\r\nto 99 years.\r\n\r\n(Supplementary Exchange of Notes)\r\n\r\nThe term of lease of Port Arthur and Dalny shall expire in the\r\n86th year of the Republic or 1997. The date for restoring the\r\nSouth Manchurian Railway to China shall fall due in the 91st year\r\nof the Republic or 2002. Article 12 in the original South\r\nManchurian Railway Agreement stating that it may be redeemed by\r\nChina after 36 years after the traffic is opened is hereby\r\ncancelled. The term of the Antung-Mukden Railway shall expire in\r\nthe 96th year of the Republic or 2007.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. Japanese subjects in South Manchuria may lease or\r\npurchase the necessary land for erecting suitable buildings for\r\ntrade and manufacture or for prosecuting agricultural enterprises.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. Japanese subjects shall be free to reside and travel in\r\nSouth Manchuria and to engage in business and manufacture of any\r\nkind whatsoever.\r\n\r\nArticle 3a. The Japanese subjects referred to in the preceding two\r\narticles, besides being required to register with the local\r\nauthorities pass-ports which they must procure under the existing\r\nregulations, shall also submit to police laws and ordinances and\r\ntax regulations, which are approved by the Japanese consul. Civil\r\nand criminal cases in which the defendants are Japanese shall be\r\ntried and adjudicated by the Japanese consul; those in which the\r\ndefendants are Chinese shall be tried and adjudicated by Chinese\r\nAuthorities. In either case an officer can be deputed to the court\r\nto attend the proceedings. But mixed civil cases between Chinese\r\nand Japanese relating to land shall be tried and adjudicated by\r\ndelegates of both nations conjointly in accordance with Chinese\r\nlaw and local usage. When the judicial system in the said region\r\nis completely reformed, all civil and criminal cases concerning\r\nJapanese subjects shall be tried entirely by Chinese law courts.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. (Changed to an exchange of notes.)\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government agrees that Japanese subjects shall be\r\npermitted forthwith to investigate, select, and then prospect for\r\nand open mines at the following places in South Manchuria, apart\r\nfrom those mining areas in which mines are being prospected for or\r\nworked; until the Mining Ordinance is definitely settled methods\r\nat present in force shall be followed.\r\n\r\n    PROVINCE OF FENG-TIEN\r\n\r\n    Locality              District        Mineral\r\n\r\n    Niu Hsin T'ai         Pen-hsi         Coal\r\n    Tien Shih Fu Kou      Pen-hsi         Coal\r\n    Sha Sung Kang         Hai-lung        Coal\r\n    T'ieh Ch'ang          Tung-hua        Coal\r\n    Nuan Ti Tang          Chin            Coal\r\n    An Shan Chan region   From Liao-yang\r\n                          to Pen-hsi      Iron\r\n\r\n    PROVINCE of KIRIN\r\n    (Southern portion)\r\n\r\n    Sha Sung Kang         Ho-lung          Coal and Iron\r\n    Kang Yao              Chi-lin (Kirin)  Coal\r\n    Chia P'i Kou          Hua-tien         Gold\r\n\r\nArticle 5. (Changed to an exchange of notes.) The Chinese\r\nGovernment declares that China will hereafter provide funds for\r\nbuilding railways in South Manchuria; if foreign capital is\r\nrequired, the Chinese Government agrees to negotiate for the loan\r\nwith Japanese capitalists first.\r\n\r\nArticle 5a. (Changed to an exchange of notes.) The Chinese\r\nGovernment agrees that hereafter, when a foreign loan is to be\r\nmade on the security of the taxes of South Manchuria (not\r\nincluding customs and salt revenue on the security of which loans\r\nhave already been made by the Central Government), it will\r\nnegotiate for the loan with Japanese capitalists first.\r\n\r\nArticle 6. (Changed to an exchange of notes.) The Chinese\r\nGovernment declares that hereafter if foreign advisers or\r\ninstructors on political, financial, military or police matters,\r\nare to be employed in South Manchuria, Japanese will be employed\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nArticle 7. The Chinese Government agrees speedily to make a\r\nfundamental revision of the Kirin-Changchun Railway Loan\r\nAgreement, taking as a standard the provisions in railroad loan\r\nagreements made heretofore between China and foreign financiers.\r\nIf, in future, more advantageous terms than those in existing\r\nrailway loan agreements are granted to foreign financiers, in\r\nconnection with railway loans, the above agreement shall again be\r\nrevised in accordance with Japan's wishes.\r\n\r\nAll existing treaties between China and Japan relating to\r\nManchuria shall, except where otherwise provided for by this\r\nConvention, remain in force.\r\n\r\n1. The Chinese Government agrees that hereafter when a foreign\r\nloan is to be made on the security of the taxes of Eastern Inner\r\nMongolia, China must negotiate with the Japanese Government first.\r\n\r\n2. The Chinese Government agrees that China will herself provide\r\nfunds for building the railways in Eastern Inner Mongolia; if\r\nforeign capital is required, she must negotiate with the Japanese\r\nGovernment first.\r\n\r\n3. The Chinese Government agrees, in the interest of trade and for\r\nthe residence of foreigners, to open by China herself, as soon as\r\npossible, certain suitable places in Eastern Inner Mongolia as\r\nCommercial Ports. The places which ought to be opened are to be\r\nchosen, and the regulations are to be drafted, by the Chinese\r\nGovernment, but the Japanese Minister must be consulted before\r\nmaking a decision.\r\n\r\n4. In the event of Japanese and Chinese desiring jointly to\r\nundertake agricultural enterprises and industries incidental\r\nthereto, the Chinese Government shall give its permission.\r\n\r\nGROUP III\r\n\r\nThe relations between Japan and the Hanyehping Company being very\r\nintimate, if those interested in the said Company come to an\r\nagreement with the Japanese capitalists for co-operation, the\r\nChinese Government shall forthwith give its consent thereto. The\r\nChinese Government further agrees that, without the consent of the\r\nJapanese capitalists, China will not convert the Company into a\r\nstate enterprise, nor confiscate it, nor cause it to borrow and\r\nuse foreign capital other than Japanese.\r\n\r\nGROUP IV\r\n\r\nChina to give a pronouncement by herself in accordance with the\r\nfollowing principle:--\r\n\r\nNo bay, harbour, or island along the coast of China may be ceded\r\nor leased to any Power.\r\n\r\nNotes to be Exchanged A\r\n\r\nAs regards the right of financing a railway from Wuchang to\r\nconnect with the Kiu-kiang-Nanchang line, the Nanchang-Hangchow\r\nrailway, and the Nanchang-Chaochow railway, if it is clearly\r\nascertained that other Powers have no objection, China shall grant\r\nthe said right to Japan.\r\n\r\nB\r\n\r\nAs regards the rights of financing a railway from Wuchang to\r\nconnect with the Kiu-kiang-Nanchang railway, a railway from\r\nNanchang to Hangchow and another from Nanchang to Chaochow, the\r\nChinese Government shall not grant the said right to any foreign\r\nPower before Japan comes to an understanding with the other Power\r\nwhich is heretofore interested therein.\r\n\r\nNOTES TO BE EXCHANGED\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government agrees that no nation whatever is to be\r\npermitted to construct, on the coast of Fukien Province, a\r\ndockyard, a coaling station for military use, or a naval base; not\r\nto be authorized to set up any other military establishment. The\r\nChinese Government further agrees not to use foreign capital for\r\nsetting up the above mentioned construction or establishment.\r\n\r\nMr. Lu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, stated as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The Chinese Government, shall, whenever, in future, it\r\nconsiders this step necessary, engage numerous Japanese advisers.\r\n\r\n2. Whenever, in future, Japanese subjects desire to lease or\r\npurchase land in the interior of China for establishing schools or\r\nhospitals, the Chinese Government shall forthwith give its consent\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\n3. When a suitable opportunity arises in future, the Chinese\r\nGovernment will send military officers to Japan to negotiate with\r\nJapanese military authorities the matter of purchasing arms or\r\nthat of establishing a joint arsenal.\r\n\r\nMr. Hioki, the Japanese Minister, stated as follows:--\r\n\r\nAs relates to the question of the right of missionary propaganda\r\nthe same shall be taken up again for negotiation in future.\r\n\r\nAn ominous silence followed the delivery of this document. The\r\nChinese Foreign Office had already exhausted itself in a\r\ndiscussion which had lasted three months, and pursuant to\r\ninstructions from the Presidential Palace prepared an exhaustive\r\nMemorandum on the subject. It was understood by now that all the\r\nForeign Offices in the world were interesting themselves very\r\nparticularly in the matter; and that all were agreed that the\r\nsituation which had so strangely developed was very serious. On\r\nthe 1st May, proceeding by appointment to the Waichiaopu (Foreign\r\nOffice) the Japanese Minister had read to him the following\r\nMemorandum which it is very necessary to grasp as it shows how\r\nsolicitous China had become of terminating the business before\r\nthere was an open international break. It will also be seen that\r\nthis Memorandum was obviously composed for purpose of public\r\nrecord, the fifth group being dealt with in such a way as to fix\r\nupon Japan the guilt of having concealed from her British Ally\r\nmatters which conflicted vitally with the aims and objects of the\r\nAnglo-Japanese Alliance Treaty.\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nRead by the Minister of Foreign Affairs to Mr. Hioki, the Japanese\r\nMinister, at a Conference held at Wai Chiao Pu, May 1, 1915.\r\n\r\nThe list of demands which the Japanese Government first presented\r\nto the Chinese Government consists of five groups, the first\r\nrelating to Shantung, the second relating to South Manchuria and\r\nEastern Inner Mongolia, the third relating to Hanyehping Company,\r\nthe fourth asking for non-alienation of the coast of the country,\r\nand the fifth relating to the questions of national advisers,\r\nnational police, national arms, missionary propaganda, Yangtsze\r\nValley railways, and Fukien Province. Out of profound regard for\r\nthe intentions entertained by Japan, the Chinese Government took\r\nthese momentous demands into grave and careful consideration and\r\ndecided to negotiate with the Japanese Government frankly and\r\nsincerely what were possible to negotiate. This is a manifestation\r\nto Japan of the most profound regard which the Chinese Government\r\nentertains for the relations between the two nations.\r\n\r\nEver since the opening of the negotiations China has been doing\r\nher best to hasten their progress holding as many as three\r\nconferences a week. As regards the articles in the second group,\r\nthe Chinese Government being disposed to allow the Japanese\r\nGovernment to develop the economic relations of the two countries\r\nin South Manchuria, realizing that the Japanese Government\r\nattaches importance to its interests in that region, and wishing\r\nto meet the hope of Japan, made a painful effort, without\r\nhesitation, to agree to the extension of the 25-year lease of Port\r\nArthur and Dalny, the 36-year period of the South Manchurian\r\nRailway and the 15-year period of the Antung-Mukden Railway, all\r\nto 99 years; and to abandon its own cherished hopes to regain\r\ncontrol of these places and properties at the expiration of their\r\nrespective original terms of lease. It cannot but be admitted that\r\nthis is a most genuine proof of China's friendship for Japan.\r\n\r\nAs to the right of opening mines in South Manchuria, the Chinese\r\nGovernment has already agreed to permit Japanese to work mines\r\nwithin the mining areas designated by Japan. China has further\r\nagreed to give Japan a right of preference in the event of\r\nborrowing foreign capital for building railways or of making a\r\nloan on the security of the local taxes in South Manchuria. The\r\nquestion of revising the arrangement for the Kirin-Changchun\r\nRailway has been settled in accordance with the proposal made by\r\nJapan. The Chinese Government has further agreed to employ\r\nJapanese first in the event of employing foreign advisers on\r\npolitical, military, financial and police matters.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the provision about the repurchase period in the\r\nSouth Manchurian Railway was not mentioned in Japan's original\r\nproposal. Subsequently, the Japanese Government alleging that its\r\nmeaning was not clear, asked China to cancel the provision\r\naltogether. Again, Japan at first demanded the right of Japanese\r\nto carry on farming in South Manchuria, but subsequently she\r\nconsidered the word \"farming\" was not broad enough and asked to\r\nreplace it with the phrase \"agricultural enterprises.\" To these\r\nrequests the Chinese Government, though well aware that the\r\nproposed changes could only benefit Japan, still acceded without\r\ndelay. This, too, is a proof of China's frankness and sincerity\r\ntowards Japan.\r\n\r\nAs regards matters relating to Shangtung the Chinese Government\r\nhas agreed to a majority of the demands.\r\n\r\nThe question of inland residence in South Manchuria is, in the\r\nopinion of the Chinese Government, incompatible with the treaties\r\nChina had entered into with Japan and other Powers, still the\r\nChinese Government did its best to consider how it was possible to\r\navoid that incompatibility. At first, China suggested that the\r\nChinese Authorities should have full rights of jurisdiction over\r\nJapanese settlers. Japan declined to agree to it. Thereupon China\r\nreconsidered the question and revised her counter-proposal five or\r\nsix times, each time making some definite concession, and went so\r\nfar to agree that all civil and criminal cases between Chinese and\r\nJapanese should be arranged according to existing treaties. Only\r\ncases relating to land or lease contracts were reserved to be\r\nadjudicated by Chinese Courts, as a mark of China's sovereignty\r\nover the region. This is another proof of China's readiness to\r\nconcede as much as possible.\r\n\r\nEastern Inner Mongolia is not an enlightened region as yet and the\r\nconditions existing there are entirely different from those\r\nprevailing in South Manchuria. The two places, therefore, cannot\r\nbe considered in the same light. Accordingly, China agreed to open\r\ncommercial marts first, in the interests of foreign trade.\r\n\r\nThe Hanyehping Company mentioned in the third group is entirely a\r\nprivate company, and the Chinese Government is precluded from\r\ninterfering with it and negotiating with another government to\r\nmake any disposal of the same as the Government likes, but having\r\nregard for the interests of the Japanese capitalists, the Chinese\r\nGovernment agreed that whenever, in future, the said company and\r\nthe Japanese capitalists should arrive at a satisfactory\r\narrangement for co-operation, China will give her assent thereto.\r\nThus the interests of the Japanese capitalists are amply\r\nsafeguarded.\r\n\r\nAlthough the demand in the fourth group asking for a declaration\r\nnot to alienate China's coast is an infringement of her sovereign\r\nrights, yet the Chinese Government offered to make a voluntary\r\npronouncement so far as it comports with China's sovereign rights.\r\nThus, it is seen that the Chinese Government, in deference to the\r\nwishes of Japan, gave a most serious consideration even to those\r\ndemands, which gravely affect the sovereignty and territorial\r\nrights of China as well as the principle of equal opportunity and\r\nthe treaties with foreign Powers. All this was a painful effort on\r\nthe part of the Chinese Government to meet the situation--a fact\r\nof which the Japanese Government must be aware.\r\n\r\nAs regards the demands in the fifth group, they all infringe\r\nChina's sovereignty, the treaty rights of other Powers or the\r\nprinciple of equal opportunity. Although Japan did not indicate\r\nany difference between this group and the preceding four in the\r\nlist which she presented to China in respect to their character,\r\nthe Chinese Government, in view of their palpably objectionable\r\nfeatures, persuaded itself that these could not have been intended\r\nby Japan as anything other than Japan's mere advice to China.\r\nAccordingly China has declared from the very beginning that while\r\nshe entertains the most profound regard for Japan's wishes, she\r\nwas unable to admit that any of these matters could be made the\r\nsubject of an understanding with Japan. Much as she desired to pay\r\nregard to Japan's wishes, China cannot but respect her own\r\nsovereign rights and the existing treaties with other Powers. In\r\norder to be rid of the seed for future misunderstanding and to\r\nstrengthen the basis of friendship, China was constrained to\r\niterate the reasons for refusing to negotiate on any of the\r\narticles in the fifth group, yet in view of Japan's wishes China\r\nhas expressed her readiness to state that no foreign money was\r\nborrowed to construct harbour work in Fukien Province. Thus it is\r\nclear that China went so far as to see a solution for Japan of a\r\nquestion that really did not admit of negotiation. Was there,\r\nthen, evasion, on the part of China?\r\n\r\nNow, since the Japanese Government has presented a revised list of\r\ndemands and declared at the same time, that it will restore the\r\nleased territory of Kiaochow, the Chinese Government reconsiders\r\nthe whole question and herewith submits a new reply to the\r\nfriendly Japanese Government.\r\n\r\nIn this reply the unsettled articles in the first group are stated\r\nagain for discussion.\r\n\r\nAs regards the second group, those articles which have already\r\nbeen initialled are omitted. In connection with the question of\r\ninland residence the police regulation clause has been revised in\r\na more restrictive sense. As for the trial of cases relating to\r\nland and lease contracts the Chinese Government now permits the\r\nJapanese Consul to send an officer to attend the proceedings.\r\n\r\nOf the four demands in connection with that part of Eastern Inner\r\nMongolia which is within the jurisdiction of South Manchuria and\r\nthe Jehol intendency, China agrees to three.\r\n\r\nChina, also, agrees to the article relating to the Hanyehping\r\nCompany as revised by Japan.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the Japanese Government will appreciate the\r\nconciliatory spirit of the Chinese Government in making this final\r\nconcession and forthwith give her assent thereto.\r\n\r\nThere is one more point. At the beginning of the present\r\nnegotiations it was mutually agreed to observe secrecy but\r\nunfortunately a few days after the presentation of the demands by\r\nJapan an Osaka newspaper published an \"Extra\" giving the text of\r\nthe demands. The foreign and the Chinese press has since been\r\npaying considerable attention to this question and frequently\r\npublishing pro-Chinese or pro-Japanese comments in order to call\r\nforth the World's conjecture--a matter which the Chinese\r\nGovernment deeply regrets.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government has never carried on any newspaper campaign\r\nand the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly\r\ndeclared this to the Japanese Minister.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Chinese Government wishes to express its hope\r\nthat the negotiations now pending between the two countries will\r\nsoon come to an end and whatever misgivings foreign countries\r\nentertain toward the present situation may be quickly dispelled.\r\n\r\nThe Peking Government, although fully aware of the perils now\r\nconfronting it, had dared to draft a complete reply to the revised\r\nDemands and had reduced Japanese redundancy to effective limits.\r\nNot only were various articles made more compact, but the\r\nphraseology employed conveyed unmistakably, if in a somewhat\r\nsubtle way, that China was not a subordinate State treating with a\r\nsuzerain. Moreover, after dealing succinctly and seriously with\r\nGroups I, II and III, the Chinese reply terminates abruptly, the\r\nother points in the Japanese List being left entirely unanswered.\r\nIt is important to seize these points in the text that follows.\r\n\r\nCHINA'S REPLY TO REVISED DEMANDS\r\n\r\nChina's Reply of May 1, 1915, to the Japanese Revised Demands of\r\nApril 26, 1915.\r\n\r\nGROUP I\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government and the Japanese Government, being desirous\r\nof maintaining the general peace in Eastern Asia and further\r\nstrengthening the friendly relations and good neighbourhood\r\nexisting between the two nations, agree to the following\r\narticles:--\r\n\r\nArticle 1. The Chinese Government declares that they will give\r\nfull assent to all matters upon which the Japanese and German\r\nGovernments may hereafter mutually agree, relating to the\r\ndisposition of all interests, which Germany, by virtue of treaties\r\nor recorded cases, possesses in relation to the Province of\r\nShantung.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government declares that when the Chinese Government\r\ngive their assent to the disposition of interests above referred\r\nto, Japan will restore the leased territory of Kiaochow to China;\r\nand further recognize the right of the Chinese Government to\r\nparticipate in the negotiations referred to above between Japan\r\nand Germany.\r\n\r\nArticle 2. The Japanese Government consents to be responsible for\r\nthe indemnification of all losses occasioned by Japan's military\r\noperation around the leased territory of Kiaochow. The customs,\r\ntelegraphs and post offices within the leased territory of\r\nKiaochow shall, prior to the restoration of the said leased\r\nterritory to China, be administered as heretofore for the time\r\nbeing. The railways and telegraph lines erected by Japan for\r\nmilitary purposes are to be removed forthwith. The Japanese troops\r\nnow stationed outside the original leased territory of Kiaochow\r\nare now to be withdrawn first, those within the original leased\r\nterritory are to be withdrawn on the restoration of the said\r\nleased territory to China.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. (Changed to an exchange of notes.)\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government declares that within the Province of\r\nShantung and along its coast no territory or island will be ceded\r\nor leased to any Power under any pretext.\r\n\r\nArticle 4. The Chinese Government consent that as regards the\r\nrailway to be built by China herself from Chefoo or Lung kow to\r\nconnect with the Kiaochow-Tsinanfu railway, if Germany is willing\r\nto abandon the privilege of financing the Chefoo-Weihsien line,\r\nChina will approach Japanese capitalists for a loan.\r\n\r\nArticle 5. The Chinese Government engage, in the interest of trade\r\nand for the residence of foreigners, to open by herself as soon as\r\npossible certain suitable places in the Province of Shantung as\r\nCommercial Ports.\r\n\r\n(Supplementary Exchange of Notes)\r\n\r\nThe places which ought to be opened are to be chosen, and the\r\nregulations are to be drafted by the Chinese Government, but the\r\nJapanese Minister must be consulted before making a decision.\r\n\r\nArticle 6. If the Japanese and German Governments are not able to\r\ncome to a definite agreement in future in their negotiations\r\nrespecting transfer, etc., this provisional agreement contained in\r\nthe foregoing articles shall be void.\r\n\r\nGROUP II [Footnote: Six articles found in Japan's Revised Demands\r\nare omitted here as they had already been initiated by the Chinese\r\nForeign Minister and the Japanese minister.]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government and the Japanese Government, with a view to\r\ndeveloping their economic relations in South Manchuria, agree to\r\nthe following articles:--\r\n\r\nArticle 2. Japanese subjects in South Manchuria may, by\r\narrangement with the owners, lease land required for erecting\r\nsuitable buildings for trade and manufacture or agricultural\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nArticle 3. Japanese subjects shall be free to reside and travel in\r\nSouth Manchuria and to engage in business and manufacture of any\r\nkind whatsoever.\r\n\r\nArticle 3a. The Japanese subjects referred to in the preceding two\r\narticles, besides being required to register with the local\r\nauthorities pass-ports which they must procure under the existing\r\nregulations, shall also observe police rules and regulations and\r\npay taxes in the same manner as Chinese. Civil and criminal cases\r\nshall be tried and adjudicated by the authorities of the defendant\r\nnationality and an officer can be deputed to attend the\r\nproceedings. But all cases purely between Japanese subjects and\r\nmixed cases between Japanese or Chinese, relating to land or\r\ndisputes arising from lease contracts, shall be tried and\r\nadjudicated by Chinese Authorities and the Japanese Consul may\r\nalso depute an officer to attend the proceedings. When the\r\njudicial system in the said Province is completely reformed, all\r\nthe civil and criminal cases concerning Japanese subjects shall be\r\ntried entirely by Chinese law courts.\r\n\r\nRELATING TO EASTERN INNER MONGOLIA (To be Exchanged by Notes)\r\n\r\n1. The Chinese Government declare that China will not in future\r\npledge the taxes, other than customs and salt revenue of that part\r\nof Eastern Inner Mongolia under the jurisdiction of South\r\nManchuria and Jehol Intendency, as security for raising a foreign\r\nloan.\r\n\r\n2. The Chinese Government declare that China will herself provide\r\nfunds for building the railways in the part of Eastern Inner\r\nMongolia under the jurisdiction of South Manchuria and the Jehol\r\nIntendency; if foreign capital is required, China will negotiate\r\nwith Japanese capitalists first, provided this does not conflict\r\nwith agreements already concluded with other Powers.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government agree, in the interest of trade and for the\r\nresidence of foreigners, to open by China herself certain suitable\r\nplaces in that part of Eastern Inner Mongolia under the\r\njurisdiction of South Manchurian and the Jehol Intendency, as\r\nCommercial Marts.\r\n\r\nThe regulations for the said Commercial Marts will be made in\r\naccordance with those of other Commercial Marts opened by China\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nGROUP III\r\n\r\nThe relations between Japan and the Hanyehping Company being very\r\nintimate, if the said Company comes to an agreement with the\r\nJapanese capitalists for co-operation, the Chinese Government\r\nshall forthwith give their consent thereto. The Chinese Government\r\nfurther declare that China will not convert the company into a\r\nstate enterprise, not confiscate it, nor cause it to borrow and\r\nuse foreign capital other than Japanese.\r\n\r\nLetter to be addressed by the Japanese Minister to the Chinese\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nExcellency: I have the honour to state that a report has reached\r\nme that the Chinese Government have given permission to foreign\r\nnations to construct, on the coast of Fukien Province, dock-yards,\r\ncoaling stations for military use, naval bases and other\r\nestablishments for military purposes; and further, that the\r\nChinese Government are borrowing foreign capital for putting up\r\nthe above-mentioned constructions or establishments. I shall be\r\nmuch obliged if the Chinese Government will inform me whether or\r\nnot these reports are well founded in fact.\r\n\r\nReply to be addressed by the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nto the Japanese Minister.\r\n\r\nExcellency: I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your\r\nExcellency's Note of ... In reply I beg to state that the\r\nChinese Government have not given permission to foreign Powers to\r\nconstruct, on the coast of Fukien Province, dock-yards, coaling\r\nstations for military use, naval bases or other establishments for\r\nmilitary purposes; nor do they contemplate to borrow foreign\r\ncapital for putting up such constructions or establishments.\r\n\r\nWithin forty-eight hours of this passage-at-arms of the 1st May it\r\nwas understood in Peking that Japan was meditating a serious step.\r\nThat vague feeling of unrest which so speedily comes in capitals\r\nwhen national affairs reach a crisis was very evident, and the\r\nword \"ultimatum\" began to be whispered. It was felt that whilst\r\nChina had held to her rights to the utmost and had received\r\nvaluable indirect support from both England and the United States,\r\nthe world-situation was such that it would be difficult to prevent\r\nJapan from proceeding to extremities. Accordingly there was little\r\nreal surprise when on the 7th May Japan filed an ultimatum\r\ndemanding a satisfactory reply within 48 hours to her Revised\r\nDemands--failing which those steps deemed necessary would be\r\ntaken. A perusal of the text of the Ultimatum will show an\r\ninteresting change in the language employed. Coaxing having\r\nfailed, and Japan being 'now convinced that so long as she did not\r\nseek to annex the rights of other Foreign Powers in China open\r\nopposition could not be offered to her,' states her case very\r\ndefiantly. One significant point, however, must be carefully\r\nnoted--that she agrees \"to detach Group V from the present\r\nnegotiations and to discuss it separately in the future.\" It is\r\nthis fact which remains the sword of Damocles hanging over China's\r\nhead; and until this sword has been flung back into the waters of\r\nthe Yellow Sea the Far Eastern situation will remain perilous.\r\n\r\nJAPAN'S ULTIMATUM TO CHINA\r\n\r\nJapan's Ultimatum delivered by the Japanese Minister to the\r\nChinese Government, on May 7th, 1915.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the Imperial Government opened the present\r\nnegotiations with the Chinese Government is first to endeavour to\r\ndispose of the complications arising out of the war between Japan\r\nand China, and secondly to attempt to solve those various\r\nquestions which are detrimental to the intimate relations of China\r\nand Japan with a view to solidifying the foundation of cordial\r\nfriendship subsisting between the two countries to the end that\r\nthe peace of the Far East may be effectually and permanently\r\npreserved. With this object in view, definite proposals were\r\npresented to the Chinese Government in January of this year, and\r\nup to today as many as twenty-five conferences have been held with\r\nthe Chinese Government in perfect sincerity and frankness.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the negotiation the Imperial Government have\r\nconsistently explained the aims and objects of the proposals in a\r\nconciliatory spirit, while on the other hand the proposals of the\r\nChinese Government, whether important or unimportant, have been\r\nattended to without any reserve.\r\n\r\nIt may be stated with confidence that no effort has been spared to\r\narrive at a satisfactory and amicable settlement of those\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the entire corpus of the proposals was\r\npractically at an end at the twenty-fourth conference; that is on\r\nthe 17th of the last month. The Imperial Government, taking a\r\nbroad view of the negotiation and in consideration of the points\r\nraised by the Chinese Government, modified the original proposals\r\nwith considerable concessions and presented to the Chinese\r\nGovernment on the 26th of the same month the revised proposals for\r\nagreement, and at the same time it was offered that, on the\r\nacceptance of the revised proposals, the Imperial Government\r\nwould, at a suitable opportunity, restore, with fair and proper\r\nconditions, to the Chinese Government the Kiaochow territory, in\r\nthe acquisition of which the Imperial Government had made a great\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May, the Chinese Government delivered the reply to\r\nthe revised proposals of the Japanese Government, which is\r\ncontrary to the expectations of the Imperial Government. The\r\nChinese Government not only did not give a careful consideration\r\nto the revised proposals but even with regard to the offer of the\r\nJapanese Government to restore Kiaochow to the Chinese Government\r\nthe latter did not manifest the least appreciation for Japan's\r\ngood will and difficulties.\r\n\r\nFrom the commercial and military point of view Kiaochow is an\r\nimportant place, in the acquisition of which the Japanese Empire\r\nsacrificed much blood and money, and, after the acquisition the\r\nEmpire incurs no obligation to restore it to China. But with the\r\nobject of increasing the future friendly relations of the two\r\ncountries, they went to the extent of proposing its restoration,\r\nyet to her great regret, the Chinese Government did not take into\r\nconsideration the good intention of Japan and manifest\r\nappreciation of her difficulties. Furthermore, the Chinese\r\nGovernment not only ignored the friendly feelings of the Imperial\r\nGovernment in offering the restoration of Kiaochow Bay, but also\r\nin replying to the revised proposals they even demanded its\r\nunconditional restoration; and again China demanded that Japan\r\nshould bear the responsibility of paying indemnity for all the\r\nunavoidable losses and damages resulting from Japan's military\r\noperations at Kiaochow; and still further in connection with the\r\nterritory of Kiaochow China advanced other demands and declared\r\nthat she has the right of participation at the future peace\r\nconference to be held between Japan and Germany. Although China is\r\nfully aware that the unconditional restoration of Kiaochow and\r\nJapan's responsibility of indemnification for the unavoidable\r\nlosses and damages can never be tolerated by Japan yet she\r\npurposely advanced these demands and declared that this reply was\r\nfinal and decisive.\r\n\r\nSince Japan could not tolerate such demands the settlement of the\r\nother questions, however compromising it may be, would not be to\r\nher interest. The consequence is that the present reply of the\r\nChinese Government is, on the whole, vague and meaningless.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in the reply of the Chinese Government to the other\r\nproposals in the revised list of the Imperial Government, such as\r\nSouth Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia, where Japan\r\nparticularly has geographical, commercial, industrial and\r\nstrategic relations, as recognized by all the nations, and made\r\nmore remarkable in consequence of the two wars in which Japan was\r\nengaged the Chinese Government overlooks these facts and does not\r\nrespect Japan's position in that place. The Chinese Government\r\neven freely altered those articles which the Imperial Government,\r\nin a compromising spirit, have formulated in accordance with the\r\nstatement of the Chinese Representatives thereby making the\r\nstatements of the Representatives an empty talk; and on seeing\r\nthem conceding with the one hand and withholding with the other it\r\nis very difficult to attribute faithfulness and sincerity to the\r\nChinese authorities.\r\n\r\nAs regards the articles relating to the employment of advisers,\r\nthe establishment of schools, and hospitals, the supply of arms\r\nand ammunition and the establishment of arsenals and railway\r\nconcessions in South China in the revised proposals they were\r\neither proposed with the proviso that the consent of the Power\r\nconcerned must be obtained, or they are merely to be recorded in\r\nthe minutes in accordance with the statements of the Chinese\r\ndelegates, and thus they are not in the least in conflict either\r\nwith Chinese sovereignty or her treaties with the Foreign Powers,\r\nyet the Chinese Government in their reply to the proposals,\r\nalleging that these proposals are incompatible with their\r\nsovereign rights and treaties with Foreign Powers, defeat the\r\nexpectations of the Imperial Government. However in spite of such\r\nattitude of the Chinese Government, the Imperial Government,\r\nthough regretting to see that there is no room for further\r\nnegotiations, yet warmly attached to the preservation of the peace\r\nof the Far East, is still hoping for a satisfactory settlement in\r\norder to avoid the disturbance of the relations.\r\n\r\nSo in spite of the circumstances which admitted no patience, they\r\nhave reconsidered the feelings of the Government of their\r\nneighbouring country and, with the exception of the article\r\nrelating to Fukien which is to be the subject of an exchange of\r\nnotes as has already been agreed upon by the Representatives of\r\nboth nations, will undertake to detach the Group V from the\r\npresent negotiation and discuss it separately in the future.\r\nTherefore the Chinese Government should appreciate the friendly\r\nfeelings of the Imperial Government by immediately accepting\r\nwithout any alteration all the articles of Group I, II, III, and\r\nIV and the exchange of notes in connection with Fukien province in\r\nGroup V as contained in the revised proposals presented on the\r\n26th of April.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Government hereby again offer their advice and hope\r\nthat the Chinese Government, upon this advice, will give a\r\nsatisfactory reply by 6 o'clock P. M. on the 9th day of May. It is\r\nhereby declared that if no satisfactory reply is received before\r\nor at the specified time, the Imperial Government will take steps\r\nthey may deem necessary.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATORY NOTE\r\n\r\nAccompanying Ultimatum delivered to the Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs by the Japanese Minister, May 7th, 1915.\r\n\r\n1. With the exception of the question of Fukien to be arranged by\r\nan exchange of notes, the five articles postponed for later\r\nnegotiation refer to (a) the employment of advisers, (b) the\r\nestablishment of schools and hospitals, (c) the railway\r\nconcessions in South China, (d) the supply of arms and ammunition\r\nand the establishment of arsenals and (e) right of Missionary\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\n2. The acceptance by the Chinese Government of the article\r\nrelating to Fukien may be either in the form as proposed by the\r\nJapanese Minister on the 26th of April or in that contained in the\r\nReply of the Chinese Government of May 1st. Although the Ultimatum\r\ncalls for the immediate acceptance by China of the modified\r\nproposals presented on April 26th, without alteration but it\r\nshould be noted that it merely states the principle and does not\r\napply to this article and articles 4 and 5 of this note.\r\n\r\n3. If the Chinese Government accept all the articles as demanded\r\nin the Ultimatum the offer of the Japanese Government to restore\r\nKiaochow to China, made on the 26th of April, will still hold\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n4. Article 2 of Group II relating to the lease or purchase of\r\nland, the terms \"lease\" and \"purchase\" may be replaced by the\r\nterms \"temporary lease\" and \"perpetual lease\" or \"lease on\r\nconsultation,\" which means a long-term lease with its\r\nunconditional renewal.\r\n\r\nArticle 4 of Group II relating to the approval of police laws and\r\nOrdinances and local taxes by the Japanese Council may form the\r\nsubject of a secret agreement.\r\n\r\n5. The phrase \"to consult with the Japanese Government\" in\r\nconnection with questions of pledging the local taxes for raising\r\nloans and the loans for the construction of railways, in Eastern\r\nInner Mongolia, which is similar to the agreement in Manchuria\r\nrelating to the matters of the same kind, may be replaced by the\r\nphrase \"to consult with the Japanese capitalists.\"\r\n\r\nThe article relating to the opening of trade marts in Eastern\r\nInner Mongolia in respect to location and regulations, may,\r\nfollowing their precedent set in Shantung, be the subject of an\r\nexchange of notes.\r\n\r\n6. From the phrase \"those interested in the Company\" in Group III\r\nof the revised list of demands, the words \"those interested in\"\r\nmay be deleted.\r\n\r\n7. The Japanese version of the Formal Agreement and its annexes\r\nshall be the official text or both the Chinese and Japanese shall\r\nbe the official texts.\r\n\r\nWhilst it would be an exaggeration to say that open panic followed\r\nthe filing of this document, there was certainly very acute\r\nalarm,--so much so that it is today known in Peking that the\r\nJapanese Legation cabled urgently to Tokio that even better terms\r\ncould be obtained if the matter was left to the discretion of the\r\nmen on the spot. But the Japanese Government had by now passed\r\nthrough a sufficiently anxious time itself, being in possession of\r\ncertain unmistakable warnings regarding what was likely to happen\r\nafter a world-peace had come,--if matters were pressed too far.\r\nConsequently nothing more was done, and on the following day China\r\nsignified her acceptance of the Ultimatum in the following terms.\r\n\r\nReply of the Chinese Government to the Ultimatum of the Japanese\r\nGovernment, delivered to the Japanese Minister by the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs on the 8th of May, 1915,\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of this month, at three o'clock P. M. the Chinese\r\nGovernment received an Ultimatum from the Japanese Government\r\ntogether with an Explanatory Note of seven articles. The Ultimatum\r\nconcluded with the hope that the Chinese Government by six o'clock\r\nP. M. on the 9th of May will give a satisfactory reply, and it is\r\nhereby declared that if no satisfactory reply is received before\r\nor at the specified time, the Japanese Government will take steps\r\nshe may deem necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government with a view to preserving the peace of the\r\nFar East hereby accepts, with the exception of those five articles\r\nof Group V postponed for later negotiation, all the articles of\r\nGroup I, II, III, and IV and the exchange of notes in connection\r\nwith Fukien Province in Group V as contained in the revised\r\nproposals presented on the 26th of April, and in accordance with\r\nthe Explanatory Note of seven articles accompanying the Ultimatum\r\nof the Japanese Government with the hope that thereby all the\r\noutstanding questions are settled, so that the cordial\r\nrelationship between the two countries may be further\r\nconsolidated. The Japanese Minister is hereby requested to appoint\r\na day to call at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make the\r\nliterary improvement of the text and sign the Agreement as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThus ended one of the most extraordinary diplomatic negotiations\r\never undertaken in Peking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE TWENTY-ONE DEMANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key to this remarkable business was supplied by a cover sent\r\nanonymously to the writer during the course of these negotiations\r\nwith no indication as to its origin. The documents which this\r\nenvelope contained are so interesting that they merit attention at\r\nthe hands of all students of history, explaining as they do the\r\npsychology of the Demands as well as throwing much light on the\r\nmanner in which the world-war has been viewed in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe first document is purely introductory, but is none the less\r\ninteresting. It is a fragment, or rather a precis of the momentous\r\nconversation which took place between Yuan Shih-kai and the\r\nJapanese Minister when the latter personally served the Demands on\r\nthe Chief Executive and took the opportunity to use language\r\nunprecedented even in the diplomatic history of Peking.\r\n\r\nThe precis begins in a curious way. After saying that \"the\r\nJapanese Minister tried to influence President Yuan Shih-kai with\r\nthe following words,\" several long lines of asterisks suggest that\r\nafter reflection the unknown chronicler had decided, for political\r\nreasons of the highest importance, to allow others to guess how\r\nthe \"conversation\" opened. From the context it seems absolutely\r\nclear that the excised words have to deal with the possibility of\r\nthe re-establishment of the Empire in China--a very important\r\nconclusion in view of what followed later in the year. Indeed\r\nthere is no reason to doubt that the Japanese Envoy actually told\r\nYuan Shih-kai that as he was already virtually Emperor it lay\r\nwithin his power to settle the whole business and to secure his\r\nposition at one blow. In any case the precis begins with these\r\nilluminating sentences:\r\n\r\n... Furthermore, the Chinese revolutionists are in close touch and\r\nhave intimate relations with numerous irresponsible Japanese, some\r\nof whom have great influence and whose policy is for strong\r\nmeasures. Our Government has not been influenced by this policy,\r\nbut if your Government does not quickly agree to these\r\nstipulations, it will be impossible to prevent some of our\r\nirresponsible people from inciting the Chinese revolutionists to\r\ncreate trouble in China.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Japanese people are also opposed to President\r\nYuan and Yuan's Government. They all declare that the President\r\nentertains anti-Japanese feeling and adopts the policy of\r\n\"befriending the Far\" (Europe and America) and \"antagonizing the\r\nNear\" (Japan). Japanese public opinion is therefore exceedingly\r\nhostile.\r\n\r\nOur Government has all along from first to last exerted its best\r\nefforts to help the Chinese Government, and if the Chinese\r\nGovernment will speedily agree to these stipulations it will have\r\nthus manifested its friendship for Japan.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese people will then be able to say that the President\r\nnever entertained anti-Japanese feelings, or adopted the policy of\r\n\"befriending the Far and antagonizing the Near.\" Will not this\r\nthen be indeed a bona fide proof of our friendly relations?\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Government also will then be inclined to render\r\nassistance to President Yuan's Government whenever it is necessary\r\n... .\r\n\r\nWe are admittedly living in a remarkable age which is making waste\r\npaper of our dearest principles. But in all the welter which the\r\nworld war has made it would be difficult to find anything more\r\nextraordinary than these few paragraphs. Japan, through her\r\nofficial representative, boldly tears down the veil hiding her\r\nambitions, and using the undoubted menace which Chinese\r\nrevolutionary activities then held for the Peking Government,\r\ndeclares in so many words that unless President Yuan Shih-kai bows\r\nhis head to the dictation of Tokio, the duel which began in Seoul\r\ntwenty-five years ago would be openly resumed.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the \"conversation\" is the principal document\r\nin the dossier. This is nothing less than an exhaustive\r\nMemorandum, divided into two sections, containing the policy\r\nadvocated by the Japanese secret society, called the Black Dragon\r\nSociety, which is said to have assumed that name on account of the\r\nmembers (military officers) having studied the situation in the\r\nHeilungchiang (or \"Black Dragon\") province of Manchuria. The\r\nmemorandum is the most remarkable document dealing with the Far\r\nEast which has come to light since the famous Cassini Convention\r\nwas published in 1896. Written presumably late in the autumn of\r\n1914 and immediately presented to the Japanese Government, it may\r\nundoubtedly be called the fulminate which exploded the Japanese\r\nmine of the 18th January, 1915. It shows such sound knowledge of\r\nworld-conditions, and is so scientific in its detachment that\r\nlittle doubt can exist that distinguished Japanese took part in\r\nits drafting. It can therefore be looked upon as a genuine\r\nexpression of the highly educated Japanese mind, and as such\r\ncannot fail to arouse serious misgivings. The first part is a\r\ngeneral review of the European War and the Chinese Question: the\r\nsecond is concerned with the Defensive Alliance between China and\r\nJapan which is looked upon as the one goal of all Japanese\r\nDiplomacy.\r\n\r\nPART I. THE EUROPEAN WAR AND THE CHINESE QUESTION\r\n\r\nThe present gigantic struggle in Europe has no parallel in\r\nhistory. Not only will the equilibrium of Europe be affected and\r\nits effect felt all over the globe, but its results will create a\r\nNew Era in the political and social world. Therefore, whether or\r\nnot the Imperial Japanese Government can settle the Far Eastern\r\nQuestion and bring to realization our great Imperial policy\r\ndepends on our being able to skilfully avail ourselves of the\r\nworld's general trend of affairs so as to extend our influence and\r\nto decide upon a course of action towards China which shall be\r\npractical in execution. If our authorities and people view the\r\npresent European War with indifference and without deep concern,\r\nmerely devoting their attention to the attack on Kiaochow,\r\nneglecting the larger issues of the war, they will have brought to\r\nnought our great Imperial policy, and committed a blunder greater\r\nthan which it can not be conceived. We are constrained to submit\r\nthis statement of policy for the consideration of our authorities,\r\nnot because we are fond of argument but because we are deeply\r\nanxious for our national welfare.\r\n\r\nNo one at present can foretell the outcome of the European War. If\r\nthe Allies meet with reverses and victory shall crown the arms of\r\nthe Germans and Austrians, German militarism will undoubtedly\r\ndominate the European Continent and extend southward and eastward\r\nto other parts of the world. Should such a state of affairs happen\r\nto take place the consequences resulting therefrom will be indeed\r\ngreat and extensive. On this account we must devote our most\r\nserious attention to the subject. If, on the other hand, the\r\nGermans and Austrians should be crushed by the Allies, Germany\r\nwill be deprived of her present status as a Federated State under\r\na Kaiser. The Federation will be disintegrated into separate\r\nstates, and Prussia will have to be content with the status of a\r\nsecond-rate Power. Austria and Hungary, on account of this defeat,\r\nwill consequently be divided. What their final fate shall be, no\r\none would now venture to predict. In the meantime Russia will\r\nannex Galicia and the Austrian Poland: France will repossess\r\nAlsace and Lorraine: Great Britain will occupy the German Colonies\r\nin Africa and the South Pacific; Servia and Montenegro will take\r\nBosnia, Herzegovina and a certain portion of Austrian Territory;\r\nthus making such great changes in the map of Europe that even the\r\nNapoleonic War in 1815 could not find a parallel.\r\n\r\nWhen these events take place, not only will Europe experience\r\ngreat changes, but we should not ignore the fact that they will\r\noccur also in China and in the South Pacific. After Russia has\r\nreplaced Germany in the territories lost by Germany and Austria,\r\nshe will hold a controlling influence in Europe, and, for a long\r\ntime to come, will have nothing to fear from her western frontier.\r\nImmediately after the war she will make an effort to carry out her\r\npolicy of expansion in the East and will not relax that effort\r\nuntil she has acquired a controlling influence in China. At the\r\nsame time Great Britain will strengthen her position in the\r\nYangtsze Valley and prohibit any other country from getting a\r\nfooting there. France will do likewise in Yunnan province using it\r\nas her base of operations for further encroachments upon China and\r\nnever hesitate to extend her advantages. We must therefore\r\nseriously study the situation remembering always that the combined\r\naction of Great Britain, Russia, and France will not only affect\r\nEurope but that we can even foresee that it will also affect\r\nChina.\r\n\r\nWhether this combined action on the part of England, France and\r\nRussia is to terminate at the end of the war or to continue to\r\noperate, we can not now predict. But after peace in Europe is\r\nrestored, these Powers will certainly turn their attention to the\r\nexpansion of their several spheres of interest in China, and, in\r\nthe adjustment, their interests will most likely conflict with one\r\nanother. If their interests do not conflict, they will work\r\njointly to solve the Chinese Question. On this point we have not\r\nthe least doubt. If England, France and Russia are actually to\r\ncombine for the coercion of China, what course is to be adopted by\r\nthe Imperial Japanese Government to meet the situation? What\r\nproper means shall we employ to maintain our influence and extend\r\nour interests within this ring of rivalry and competition? It is\r\nnecessary that we bear in mind the final results of the European\r\nWar and forestall the trend of events succeeding it so as to be\r\nable to decide upon a policy towards China and determine the\r\naction to be ultimately taken. If we remain passive, the Imperial\r\nJapanese Government's policy towards China will lose that\r\nsubjective influence and our diplomacy will be checked forever by\r\nthe combined force of the other Powers. The peace of the Far East\r\nwill be thus endangered and even the existence of the Japanese\r\nEmpire as a nation will no doubt be imperilled. It is therefore\r\nour first important duty at this moment to enquire of our\r\nGovernment what course is to be adopted to face that general\r\nsituation after the war? What preparations are being made to meet\r\nthe combined pressure of the Allies upon China? What policy has\r\nbeen followed to solve the Chinese Question? When the European War\r\nis terminated and peace restored we are not concerned so much with\r\nthe question whether it be the Dual Monarchies or the Triple\r\nEntente which emerge victorious but whether, in anticipation of\r\nthe future expansion of European influence in the Continents of\r\nEurope and Asia, the Imperial Japanese Government should or should\r\nnot hesitate to employ force to check the movement before this\r\noccurrence. Now is the most opportune moment for Japan to quickly\r\nsolve the Chinese Question. Such an opportunity will not occur for\r\nhundreds of years to come. Not only is it Japan's divine duty to\r\nact now, but present conditions in China favour the execution of\r\nsuch a plan. We should by all means decide and act at once. If our\r\nauthorities do not avail themselves of this rare opportunity,\r\ngreat difficulty will surely be encountered in future in the\r\nsettlement of this Chinese Question. Japan will be isolated from\r\nthe European Powers after the war, and will be regarded by them\r\nwith envy and jealousy just as Germany is now regarded. Is it not\r\nthen a vital necessity for Japan to solve at this very moment the\r\nChinese Question?\r\n\r\nNo one--not even those who care nothing for politics--can deny\r\nthat there is in this document an astounding disclosure of the\r\nmental attitude of the Japanese not only towards their enemies but\r\ntowards their friends as well. They trust nobody, befriend nobody,\r\nenvy nobody; they content themselves with believing that the whole\r\nworld may in the not distant future turn against them. The burden\r\nof their argument swings just as much against their British ally\r\nas against Germany and Austria; and the one and only matter which\r\npreoccupies Japanese who make it their business to think about\r\nsuch things is to secure that Japan shall forestall Europe in\r\nseizing control of China. It is admitted in so many words that it\r\nis too early to know who is to triumph in the gigantic European\r\nstruggle; it is also admitted that Germany will forever be the\r\nenemy. At the same time it is expected, should the issue of the\r\nstruggle be clearcut and decisive in favour of the Allies, that a\r\nnew three-Power combination formed by England, France and Russia\r\nmay be made to operate against Japan. Although the alliance with\r\nEngland, twice renewed since 1902, should occupy as important a\r\nplace in the Far East as the Entente between England and France\r\noccupies in Europe, not one Japanese in a hundred knows or cares\r\nanything about such an arrangement; and even if he has knowledge\r\nof it, he coolly assigns to his country's major international\r\ncommitment a minimum and constantly diminishing importance. In his\r\nview the British Alliance is nothing but a piece of paper which\r\nmay be consumed in the great bonfire now shedding such a lurid\r\nlight over the world. What is germane to the matter is his own\r\nplan, his own method of taking up arms in a sea of troubles. The\r\nsecond part of the Black Dragon Society's Memorandum, pursuing the\r\nargument logically and inexorably and disclosing traces of real\r\npolitical genius, makes this unalterably clear.\r\n\r\nHaving established clearly the attitude of Japan towards the\r\nworld--and more particularly towards the rival political\r\ncombinations now locked together in a terrible death-struggle,\r\nthis second part of the Memorandum is concerned solely with China\r\nand can be broken into two convenient sections. The first section\r\nis constructive--the plan for the reconstruction of China is\r\noutlined in terms suited to the Japanese genius. This part begins\r\nwith an illuminating piece of rhetoric.\r\n\r\nPART II. THE CHINESE QUESTION AND THE DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE\r\n\r\nIt is a very important matter of policy whether the Japanese\r\nGovernment, in obedience to its divine mission, shall solve the\r\nChinese Question in a heroic manner by making China voluntarily\r\nrely upon Japan. To force China to such a position there is\r\nnothing else for the Imperial Japanese Government to do but to\r\ntake advantage of the present opportunity to seize the reigns of\r\npolitical and financial power and to enter by all means into a\r\ndefensive alliance with her under secret terms as enumerated\r\nbelow:\r\n\r\nThe Secret Terms of the Defensive Alliance\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Japanese Government, with due respect for the\r\nSovereignty and Integrity of China and with the object and hope of\r\nmaintaining the peace of the Far East, undertakes to share the\r\nresponsibility of co-operating with China to guard her against\r\ninternal trouble and foreign invasion and China shall accord to\r\nJapan special facilities in the matter of China's National\r\nDefence, or the protection of Japan's special rights and\r\nprivileges and for these objects the following treaty of Alliance\r\nis to be entered into between the two contracting parties:\r\n\r\n1. When there is internal trouble in China or when she is at war\r\nwith another nation or nations, Japan shall send her army to\r\nrender assistance, to assume the responsibility of guarding\r\nChinese territory and to maintain peace and order in China.\r\n\r\n2. China agrees to recognize Japan's privileged position in South\r\nManchuria and Inner Mongolia and to cede the sovereign rights of\r\nthese regions to Japan to enable her to carry out a scheme of\r\nlocal defence on a permanent basis.\r\n\r\n3. After the Japanese occupation of Kiaochow, Japan shall acquire\r\nall the rights and privileges hitherto enjoyed by the Germans in\r\nregard to railways, mines and all other interests, and after peace\r\nand order is restored in Tsingtao, the place shall be handed back\r\nto China to be opened as an International Treaty port.\r\n\r\n4. For the maritime defence of China and Japan, China shall lease\r\nstrategic harbours along the coast of the Fukien province to Japan\r\nto be converted into naval bases and grant to Japan in the said\r\nprovince all railway and mining rights.\r\n\r\n5. For the reorganization of the Chinese army China shall entrust\r\nthe training and drilling of the army to Japan.\r\n\r\n6. For the unification of China's firearms and munitions of war,\r\nChina shall adopt firearms of Japanese pattern, and at the same\r\ntime establish arsenals (with the help of Japan) in different\r\nstrategic points.\r\n\r\n7. With the object of creating and maintaining a Chinese Navy,\r\nChina shall entrust the training of her navy to Japan.\r\n\r\n8. With the object of reorganizing her finances and improving the\r\nmethods of taxation, China shall entrust the work to Japan, and\r\nthe latter shall elect competent financial experts who shall act\r\nas first-class advisers to the Chinese Government.\r\n\r\n9. China shall engage Japanese educational experts as educational\r\nadvisers and extensively establish schools in different parts of\r\nthe country to teach Japanese so as to raise the educational\r\nstandard of the country.\r\n\r\n10. China shall first consult with and obtain the consent of Japan\r\nbefore she can enter into an agreement with another Power for\r\nmaking loans, the leasing of territory, or the cession of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the signing of this Defensive Alliance, Japan and\r\nChina shall work together hand-in-hand. Japan will assume the\r\nresponsibility of safeguarding Chinese territory and maintaining\r\nthe peace and order in China. This will relieve China of all\r\nfuture anxieties and enable her to proceed energetically with her\r\nreforms, and, with a sense of territorial security, she may wait\r\nfor her national development and regeneration. Even after the\r\npresent European War is over and peace is restored China will\r\nabsolutely have nothing to fear in the future of having pressure\r\nbrought against her by the foreign powers. It is only thus that\r\npermanent peace can be secured in the Far East.\r\n\r\nBut before concluding this Defensive Alliance, two points must\r\nfirst be ascertained and settled. (1) Its bearing on the Chinese\r\nGovernment. (2) Its bearing on those Powers having intimate\r\nrelations with and great interests in China.\r\n\r\nIn considering its effect on the Chinese Government, Japan must\r\ntry to foresee whether the position of China's present ruler Yuan\r\nShih-kai shall be permanent or not; whether the present\r\nGovernment's policy will enjoy the confidence of a large section\r\nof the Chinese people; whether Yuan Shi-kai will readily agree to\r\nthe Japanese Government's proposal to enter into a treaty of\r\nalliance with us. These are points to which we are bound to give a\r\nthorough consideration. Judging by the attitude hitherto adopted\r\nby Yuan Shi-kai we know he has always resorted to the policy of\r\nexpediency in his diplomatic dealings, and although he may now\r\noutwardly show friendliness towards us, he will in fact rely upon\r\nthe influence of the different Powers as the easiest check against\r\nus and refuse to accede to our demands. Take for a single\r\ninstance, his conduct towards us since the Imperial Government\r\ndeclared war against Germany and his action will then be clear to\r\nall. Whether we can rely upon the ordinary friendly methods of\r\ndiplomacy to gain our object or not it does not require much\r\nwisdom to decide. After the gigantic struggle in Europe is over,\r\nleaving aside America which will not press for advantage, China\r\nwill not be able to obtain any loans from the other Powers. With a\r\ndepleted treasury, without means to pay the officials and the\r\narmy, with local bandits inciting the poverty-stricken populace to\r\ntrouble, with the revolutionists waiting for opportunities to\r\nrise, should an insurrection actually occur while no outside\r\nassistance can be rendered to quell it we are certain it will be\r\nimpossible for Yuan Shi-kai, single-handed, to restore order and\r\nconsolidate the country. The result will be that the nation will\r\nbe cut up into many parts beyond all hope of remedy. That this\r\nstate of affairs will come is not difficult to foresee. When this\r\noccurs, shall we uphold Yuan's Government and assist him to\r\nsuppress the internal insurrection with the certain assurance that\r\nwe could influence him to agree to our demands, or shall we help\r\nthe revolutionists to achieve a success and realize our object\r\nthrough them? This question must be definitely decided upon this\r\nvery moment so that we may put it into practical execution. If we\r\ndo not look into the future fate of China but go blindly to uphold\r\nYuan's Government, to enter into a Defensive Alliance with China,\r\nhoping thus to secure a complete realization of our object by\r\nassisting him to suppress the revolutionists, it is obviously a\r\nwrong policy. Why? Because the majority of the Chinese people have\r\nlost all faith in the tottering Yuan Shi-kai who is discredited\r\nand attacked by the whole nation for having sold his country. If\r\nJapan gives Yuan the support, his Government, though in a very\r\nprecarious state, may possibly avoid destruction. Yuan Shi-kai\r\nbelongs to that school of politicians who are fond of employing\r\ncraftiness and cunning. He may be friendly to us for a time, but\r\nhe will certainly abandon us and again befriend the other Powers\r\nwhen the European war is at an end. Judging by his past we have no\r\ndoubt as to what he will do in the future. For Japan to ignore the\r\ngeneral sentiment of the Chinese people and support Yuan Shi-kai\r\nwith the hope that we can settle with him the Chinese Question is\r\na blunder indeed. Therefore in order to secure the permanent peace\r\nof the Far East, instead of supporting a Chinese Government which\r\ncan neither be long continued in power nor assist in the\r\nattainment of our object, we should rather support the 400,000,000\r\nChinese people to renovate their corrupt Government, to change its\r\npresent form, to maintain peace and order in the land and to usher\r\ninto China a new era of prosperity so that China and Japan may in\r\nfact as well as in name be brought into the most intimate and\r\nvital relations with each other. China's era of prosperity is\r\nbased on the China-Japanese Alliance and this Alliance is the\r\nfoundational power for the repelling of the foreign aggression\r\nthat is to be directed against the Far East at the conclusion of\r\nthe European war. This Alliance is also the foundation-stone of\r\nthe peace of the world. Japan therefore should take this as the\r\nlast warning and immediately solve this question. Since the\r\nImperial Japanese Government has considered it imperative to\r\nsupport the Chinese people, we should induce the Chinese\r\nrevolutionists, the Imperialists and other Chinese malcontents to\r\ncreate trouble all over China. The whole country will be thrown\r\ninto disorder and Yuan's Government will consequently be\r\noverthrown. We shall then select a man from amongst the most\r\ninfluential and most noted of the 400,000,000 of Chinese and help\r\nhim to organize a new form of Government and to consolidate the\r\nwhole country. In the meantime our army must assist in the\r\nrestoration of peace and order in the country, and in the\r\nprotection of the lives and properties of the people, so that they\r\nmay gladly tender their allegiance to the new Government which\r\nwill then naturally confide in and rely upon Japan. It is after\r\nthe accomplishment of only these things that we shall without\r\ndifficulty gain our object by the conclusion of a Defensive\r\nAlliance with China.\r\n\r\nFor us to incite the Chinese revolutionists and malcontents to\r\nrise in China we consider the present to be the most opportune\r\nmoment. The reason why these men can not now carry on an active\r\ncampaign is because they are insufficiently provided with funds.\r\nIf the Imperial Government can take advantage of this fact to make\r\nthem a loan and instruct them to rise simultaneously, great\r\ncommotion and disorder will surely prevail all over China. We can\r\nintervene and easily adjust matters.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the European War warns Japan with greater urgency\r\nof the imperative necessity of solving this most vital of\r\nquestions. The Imperial Government can not be considered as\r\nembarking on a rash project. This opportunity will not repeat\r\nitself for our benefit. We must avail ourselves of this chance and\r\nunder no circumstances hesitate. Why should we wait for the\r\nspontaneous uprising of the revolutionists and malcontents? Why\r\nshould we not think out and lay down a plan beforehand? When we\r\nexamine into the form of Government in China, we must ask whether\r\nthe existing Republic is well suited to the national temperament\r\nand well adapted to the thoughts and aspirations of the Chinese\r\npeople. From the time the Republic of China was established up to\r\nthe present moment, if what it has passed through is to be\r\ncompared to what it ought to be in the matter of administration\r\nand unification, we find disappointment everywhere. Even the\r\nrevolutionists themselves, the very ones who first advocated the\r\nRepublican form of government, acknowledge that they have made a\r\nmistake. The retention of the Republican form of Government in\r\nChina will be a great future obstacle in the way of a Chino-\r\nJapanese Alliance. And why must it be so? Because, in a Republic\r\nthe fundamental principles of government as well as the social and\r\nmoral aims of the people are distinctly different from that of a\r\nConstitutional Monarchy. Their laws and administration also\r\nconflict. If Japan act as a guide to China and China models\r\nherself after Japan, it will only then be possible for the two\r\nnations to solve by mutual effort the Far East Question without\r\ndifferences and disagreements. Therefore to start from the\r\nfoundation for the purpose of reconstructing the Chinese\r\nGovernment, of establishing a Chino-Japanese Alliance, of\r\nmaintaining the permanent peace of the Far East and of realizing\r\nthe consummation of Japan's Imperial policy, we must take\r\nadvantage of the present opportunity to alter China's Republican\r\nform of Government into a Constitutional Monarchy which shall\r\nnecessarily be identical, in all its details, to the\r\nConstitutional Monarchy of Japan, and to no other. This is really\r\nthe key and first principle to be firmly held for the actual\r\nreconstruction of the form of Government in China. If China\r\nchanges her Republican form of Government to that of a\r\nConstitutional Monarchy, shall we, in the selection of a new\r\nruler, restore the Emperor Hsuan T'ung to his throne or choose the\r\nmost capable man from the Monarchists or select the most worthy\r\nmember from among the revolutionists? We think, however, that it\r\nis advisable at present to leave this question to the exigency of\r\nthe future when the matter is brought up for decision. But we must\r\nnot lose sight of the fact that to actually put into execution\r\nthis policy of a Chino-Japanese Alliance and the transformation of\r\nthe Republic of China into a Constitutional Monarchy, is, in\r\nreality, the fundamental principle to be adopted for the\r\nreconstruction of China.\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the bearing of this Defensive Alliance on\r\nthe other Powers. Needless to say, Japan and China will in no way\r\nimpair the rights and interests already acquired by the Powers. At\r\nthis moment it is of paramount importance for Japan to come to a\r\nspecial understanding with Russia to define our respective spheres\r\nin Manchuria and Mongolia so that the two countries may co-operate\r\nwith each other in the future. This means that Japan after the\r\nacquisition of sovereign rights in South Manchuria and Inner\r\nMongolia will work together with Russia after her acquisition of\r\nsovereign rights in North Manchuria and Outer Mongolia to maintain\r\nthe status quo, and endeavour by every effort to protect the peace\r\nof the Far East. Russia, since the outbreak of the European War,\r\nhas not only laid aside all ill-feelings against Japan, but has\r\nadopted the same attitude as her Allies and shown warm friendship\r\nfor us. No matter how we regard the Manchurian and Mongolian\r\nQuestions in the future she is anxious that we find some way of\r\nsettlement. Therefore we need not doubt but that Russia, in her\r\nattitude towards this Chinese Question, will be able to come to an\r\nunderstanding with us for mutual co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe British sphere of influence and interest in China is centred\r\nin Tibet and the Yangtsze Valley. Therefore if Japan can come to\r\nsome satisfactory arrangement with China in regard to Tibet and\r\nalso give certain privileges to Great Britain in the Yangtsze\r\nValley, with an assurance to protect those privileges, no matter\r\nhow powerful Great Britain might be, she will surely not oppose\r\nJapan's policy in regard to this Chinese Question. While this\r\npresent European War is going on Great Britain has never asked\r\nJapan to render her assistance. That her strength will certainly\r\nnot enable her to oppose us in the future need not be doubted in\r\nthe least.\r\n\r\nSince Great Britain and Russia will not oppose Japan's policy\r\ntowards China, it can readily be seen what attitude France will\r\nadopt in regard to the subject. What Japan must now somewhat\r\nreckon with is America. But America in her attitude towards us\r\nregarding our policy towards China has already declared the\r\nprinciple of maintaining China's territorial integrity and equal\r\nopportunity and will be satisfied, if we do not impair America's\r\nalready acquired rights and privileges. We think America will also\r\nhave no cause for complaint. Nevertheless America has in the East\r\na naval force which can be fairly relied upon, though not\r\nsufficiently strong to be feared. Therefore in Japan's attitude\r\ntowards America there is nothing really for us to be afraid of.\r\n\r\nSince China's condition is such on the one hand and the Powers'\r\nrelation towards China is such on the other hand, Japan should\r\navail herself in the meantime of the European War to definitely\r\ndecide upon a policy towards China, the most important move being\r\nthe transformation of the Chinese Government to be followed up by\r\npreparing for the conclusion of the Defensive Alliance. The\r\nprecipitate action on the part of our present Cabinet in acceding\r\nto the request of Great Britain to declare war against Germany\r\nwithout having definitely settled our policy towards China has no\r\nreal connection with our future negotiations with China or affect\r\nthe political condition in the Far East. Consequently all\r\nintelligent Japanese, of every walk of life throughout the land,\r\nare very deeply concerned about the matter.\r\n\r\nOur Imperial Government should now definitely change our dependent\r\nforeign policy which is being directed by others into an\r\nindependent foreign policy which shall direct others, proclaiming\r\nthe same with solemn sincerity to the world and carrying it out\r\nwith determination. If we do so, even the gods and spirits will\r\ngive way. These are important points in our policy towards China\r\nand the result depends on how we carry them out. Can our\r\nauthorities firmly make up their mind to solve this Chinese\r\nQuestion by the actual carrying out of this fundamental principle?\r\nIf they show irresolution while we have this heaven-conferred\r\nchance and merely depend on the good will of the other Powers, we\r\nshall eventually have greater pressure to be brought against the\r\nFar East after the European War is over, when the present\r\nequilibrium will be destroyed. That day will then be too late for\r\nus to repent of our folly. We are therefore impelled by force of\r\ncircumstances to urge our authorities to a quicker sense of the\r\nsituation and to come to a determination.\r\n\r\nThe first point which leaps out of this extraordinarily frank\r\ndisquisition is that the origin of the Twenty-one Demands is at\r\nlast disclosed. A perusal of the ten articles forming the basis of\r\nthe Defensive alliance proposed by the Black Dragon Society,\r\nallows us to understand everything that occurred in Peking in the\r\nspring of 1915. As far back as November, 1914, it was generally\r\nrumoured in Peking that Japan had a surprise of an extraordinary\r\nnature in her diplomatic archives, and that it would be merely a\r\nmatter of weeks before it was sprung. Comparing this elaborate\r\nmemorandum of the Black Dragon Society with the original text of\r\nthe Twenty-one Demands it is plain that the proposed plan, having\r\nbeen handed to Viscount Kato, had to be passed through the\r\ndiplomatic filters again and again until all gritty matter had\r\nbeen removed, and an appearance of innocuousness given to it. It\r\nis for this reason that the defensive alliance finally emerges as\r\nfive compact little \"groups\" of demands, with the vital things\r\ndirectly affecting Chinese sovereignty labelled desiderata, so\r\nthat Japanese ambassadors abroad could leave very warm assurances\r\nat every Foreign Office that there was nothing in what Japan\r\ndesired which in any way conflicted with the Treaty rights of the\r\nPowers in China. The air of mystery which surrounded the whole\r\nbusiness from the 18th January to the 7th May--the day of the\r\nultimatum--was due to the fact that Japan attempted to translate\r\nthe conspiracy into terms of ordinary intercourse, only to find\r\nthat in spite of the \"filtering\" the atmosphere of plotting could\r\nnot be shaken off or the political threat adequately hidden. There\r\nis an arresting piece of psychology in this.\r\n\r\nThe conviction expressed in the first portion of the Memorandum\r\nthat bankruptcy was the rock on which the Peking administration\r\nmust sooner or later split, and that the moment which Japan must\r\nseize is the outbreak of insurrections, is also highly instructive\r\nin view of what happened later. Still more subtle is the manner in\r\nwhich the ultimate solution is left open: it is consistently\r\nadmitted throughout the mass of reasoning that there is no means\r\nof knowing whether suasion or force will ultimately be necessary.\r\nForce, however, always beckons to Japan because that is the\r\nsimplest formula. And since Japan is the self-appointed defender\r\nof the dumb four hundred millions, her influence will be thrown on\r\nthe side of the populace in order \"to usher into China a new era\r\nof prosperity\" so that China and Japan may in fact as well as in\r\nname be brought into the most intimate and vital relations with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe object of the subsidized insurrections is also clearly stated:\r\nit is to alter China's republican form of government into a\r\nConstitutional Monarchy which shall necessarily be identical in\r\nall its details to the Constitutional Monarchy of Japan and to no\r\nother. Who the new Emperor is to be is a point left in suspense,\r\nalthough we may here again recall that in 1912 in the midst of the\r\nrevolution Japan privately sounded England regarding the\r\nadvisability of lending the Manchus armed assistance, a proposal\r\nwhich was immediately vetoed. But there are other things: nothing\r\nis forgotten in the Memorandum. Russia is to be specially\r\nplacated, England to be specially negotiated with, thus\r\nincidentally explaining Japan's recent attitude regarding the\r\nYangtsze Railways. Japan, released from her dependent foreign\r\npolicy, that is from a policy which is bound by conventions and\r\ntreaties which others respect, can then carry out her own plans\r\nwithout fear of molestation.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us to the two last documents of the dossier--the\r\nmethod of subsidizing and arranging insurrections in China when\r\nand wherever necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first document is a detailed agreement between the\r\nRevolutionary Party and various Japanese merchants. Trained\r\nleaders are to be used in the provinces South of the Yellow River,\r\nand the matter of result is so systematized that the agreement\r\nspecifies the amount of compensation to be paid for every Japanese\r\nkilled on active service; it declares that the Japanese will\r\ndeliver arms and ammunition in the districts of Jihchow in\r\nShantung and Haichow in Kiangsu; and it ends by stating that the\r\nfirst instalment of cash, Yen 400,000, had been paid over in\r\naccordance with the terms of the agreement. The second document is\r\nan additional loan agreement between the interested parties\r\ncreating a special \"trading\" corporation, perhaps satirically\r\nnamed \"The Europe and Asia Trading Company,\" which in a\r\nconsideration of a loan of half a million yen gives Japanese prior\r\nrights over all the mines of China.\r\n\r\nALLEGED SECRET AGREEMENT MADE BETWEEN SUN WEN (SUN YAT SEN) AND\r\nTHE JAPANESE\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the peace in the Far East, it is necessary\r\nfor China and Japan to enter into an offensive and defensive\r\nalliance whereby in case of war with any other nation or nations\r\nJapan shall supply the military force while China shall be\r\nresponsible for the finances. It is impossible for the present\r\nChinese Government to work hand in hand with the Japanese\r\nGovernment nor does the Japanese Government desire to co-operate\r\nwith the former. Consequently Japanese politicians and merchants\r\nwho have the peace of the Far East at heart are anxious to assist\r\nChina in her reconstruction. For this object the following\r\nAgreement is entered into by the two parties:\r\n\r\n1. Before an uprising is started, Terao, Okura, Tseji Karoku and\r\ntheir associates shall provide the necessary funds, weapons and\r\nmilitary force, but the funds so provided must not exceed\r\n1,500,000 yen and rifles not to exceed 100,000 pieces.\r\n\r\n2. Before the uprising takes place the loan shall be temporarily\r\nsecured by 10,000,000 yen worth of bonds to be issued by Sun Wen\r\n(Sun Yat Sen). It shall however be secured afterwards by all the\r\nmovable properties of the occupied territory. (See Article 14 of\r\nthis Agreement.)\r\n\r\n3. The funds from the present loan and military force to be\r\nprovided are for operations in the provinces South of the Yellow\r\nRiver viz: Yunnan, Kweichow, Hunan, Hupeh, Szechuan, Kiangsi,\r\nAnhuei, Kiangsu, Chekiang, Fukien, Kwangsi and Kwangtung. If it is\r\nintended to invade the Northern provinces North of the Yellow\r\nRiver, Tseji Karoku and his associates shall participate with the\r\nrevolutionists in all deliberations connected with such\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n4. The Japanese volunteer force shall be allowed from the date of\r\ntheir enrolment active service pay in accordance with the\r\nregulations of the Japanese army. After the occupation of a place,\r\nthe two parties will settle the mode of rewarding the meritorious\r\nand compensating the family of the killed, adopting the most\r\ngenerous practice in vogue in China and Japan. In the case of the\r\nkilled, compensation for each soldier shall, at the least, be more\r\nthan 1,000 yen.\r\n\r\n5. Wherever the revolutionary army might be located the Japanese\r\nmilitary officers accompanying these expeditions shall have the\r\nright to advise a continuation or cessation of operations.\r\n\r\n6. After the revolutionary army has occupied a region and\r\nstrengthened its defences, all industrial undertakings and railway\r\nconstruction and the like, not mentioned in the Treaties with\r\nother foreign Powers, shall be worked with joint capital together\r\nwith the Japanese.\r\n\r\n7. On the establishment of a new Government in China, all Japan's\r\ndemands on China shall be recognized by the new Government as\r\nsettled and binding.\r\n\r\n8. All Japanese Military Officers holding the rank of Captain or\r\nhigher ranks engaged by the Chinese revolutionary army shall have\r\nthe privilege of being continued in their employment with a limit\r\nas to date and shall have the right to ask to be thus employed.\r\n\r\n9. The loan shall be paid over in three instalments. The first\r\ninstalment will be 400,000 yen, the second instalment ... yen and\r\nthe third instalment ... yen. After the first instalment is paid\r\nover, Okura who advances the loan shall have the right to appoint\r\nmen to supervise the expenditure of the money.\r\n\r\n10. The Japanese shall undertake to deliver all arms and\r\nammunition in the Districts of Jih Chao and Haichow (in Shantung\r\nand Kiangsu, South of Kiaochow).\r\n\r\n11. The payment of the first instalment of the loan shall be made\r\nnot later than three days after the signing of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n12. All the employed Japanese Military officers and Japanese\r\nvolunteers are in duty bound to obey the orders of the Commander\r\nof the revolutionary army.\r\n\r\n13. The Commander of the revolutionary army shall have the right\r\nto send back to Japan those Japanese military officers and\r\nJapanese volunteers who disobey his orders and their passage money\r\nshall not be paid if such decision meets with the approval of\r\nthree or more of the Japanese who accompany the revolutionary\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n14. All the commissariat departments in the occupied territory\r\nmust employ Japanese experts to co-operate in their management.\r\n\r\n15. This Agreement takes effect immediately it is signed by the\r\ntwo parties.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing fifteen articles have been discussed several times\r\nbetween the two parties and signed by them in February. The first\r\ninstalment of 400,000 yen has been paid according to the terms of\r\nthis Agreement.\r\n\r\nLOAN AGREEMENT MADE BETWEEN THE REVOLUTIONARY PARTY REPRESENTED BY\r\nCHANG YAO CHING AND HIS ASSOCIATES OF THE FIRST PART AND KAWASAKI\r\nKULANOSKE OF THE SECOND PART\r\n\r\n1. The Europe and Asia Trading Company undertakes to raise a loan\r\nof 500,000 yen. After the Agreement is signed and sealed by the\r\ncontracting parties the Japanese Central Bank shall hand over 3/10\r\nof the loan as the first instalment. When Chang Yao Ching and his\r\nassociates arrive at their proper destination the sum of 150,000\r\nyen shall be paid over as the second instalment. When final\r\narrangements are made the third and last instalment of 200,000 yen\r\nshall be paid.\r\n\r\n2. When money is to be paid out, the Europe and Asia Trading\r\nCompany shall appoint supervisers. Responsible individuals of the\r\ncontracting parties shall jointly affix their seals (to the\r\nchecks) before money is drawn for expenditure.\r\n\r\n3. The Europe and Asia Trading Company shall secure a volunteer\r\nforce of 150 men, only retired officers of the Japanese army to be\r\neligible.\r\n\r\n4. On leaving Japan the travelling expenses and personal effects\r\nof the volunteers shall be borne by themselves. After reaching\r\nChina, Chang Yao Ching and his associates shall give the\r\nvolunteers the pay of officers of the subordinate grade according\r\nto the established regulations of the Japanese army.\r\n\r\n5. If a volunteer is wounded while on duty Chang Yao Ching and his\r\nassociates shall pay him a provisional compensation of not\r\nexceeding 1,000 yen. When wounded seriously a provisional\r\ncompensation of 5,000 yen shall be paid as well as a life pension\r\nin accordance with the rules of the Japanese army. If a volunteer\r\nmeets with an accident, thus losing his life, an indemnity of\r\n50,000 yen shall be paid to his family.\r\n\r\n6. If a volunteer is not qualified for duty Chang Yao-ching and\r\nhis associates shall have the power to dismiss him. All volunteers\r\nare subject to the orders of Chang Yao-ching and his associates\r\nand to their command in the battlefields.\r\n\r\n7. When volunteers are required to attack a certain selected place\r\nit shall be their duty to do so. But the necessary expenses for\r\nthe undertaking shall be determined beforehand by both parties\r\nafter investigating into existing conditions.\r\n\r\n8. The volunteer force shall be organized after the model of the\r\nJapanese army. Two Japanese officers recommended by the Europe and\r\nAsia Trading Company shall be employed.\r\n\r\n9. The Europe and Asia Trading Company shall have the power to\r\ndispose of the public properties in the places occupied by the\r\nvolunteer force.\r\n\r\n10. The Europe and Asia Trading Company shall have the first\r\npreference for working the mines in places occupied and protected\r\nby the volunteer force.\r\n\r\nAnd here ends this extraordinary collection of papers. Is fiction\r\nmixed with fact--are these only \"trial\" drafts, or are they real\r\ndocuments signed, sealed, and delivered? The point seems\r\nunimportant. The thing of importance is the undoubted fact that\r\nassembled and treated in the way we have treated them they present\r\na complete and arresting picture of the aims and ambitions of the\r\nordinary Japanese; of their desire to push home the attack to the\r\nlast gasp and so to secure the infeodation of China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MONARCHIST PLOT\r\n\r\nTHE PAMPHLET OF YANG TU\r\n\r\n\r\nA shiver of impotent rage passed over the country when the nature\r\nand acceptance of the Japanese Ultimatum became generally known.\r\nThe Chinese, always an emotional people responding with quasi-\r\nfeminine volubility to oppressive acts, cried aloud at the\r\nignominy of the diplomacy which had so cruelly crucified them. One\r\nand all declared that the day of shame which had been so harshly\r\nimposed upon them would never be forgotten and that Japan would\r\nindeed pay bitterly for her policy of extortion.\r\n\r\nTwo movements were started at once: one to raise a National\r\nSalvation Fund to be applied towards strengthening the nation in\r\nany way the government might decide; the other, to boycott all\r\nJapanese articles of commerce. Both soon attained formidable\r\nproportions. The nation became deeply and fervently interested in\r\nthe double-idea; and had Yuan Shih-kai possessed true political\r\nvision there is little doubt that by responding to this national\r\ncall he might have ultimately been borne to the highest pinnacles\r\nof his ambitions without effort on his part. His oldest enemies\r\nnow openly declared that henceforth he had only to work honourably\r\nand whole-heartedly in the nation's interest to find them\r\nsupporting him, and to have every black mark set against his name\r\nwiped out.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances what did he do? His actions form one of the\r\nmost incredible and, let it be said, contemptible chapters of\r\ncontemporary history.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the origins of the Twenty-one Demands we have\r\nalready discussed the hints the Japan Representative had\r\nofficially made when presenting his now famous Memorandum. Briefly\r\nYuan Shih-kai had been told in so many words that since he was\r\nalready autocrat of all the Chinese, he had only to endorse the\r\nprinciple of Japanese guidance in his administration to find that\r\nhis Throne would be as good as publicly and solidly established.\r\nBeing saturated with the doleful diplomacy of Korea, and seeing in\r\nthese proposals a mere trap, Yuan Shih-kai, as we have shown, had\r\ndrawn back in apparent alarm. Nevertheless the words spoken had\r\nsunk in deep, for the simple and excellent reason that ever since\r\nthe coup d'etat of the 4th November, 1913, the necessity of\r\n\"consolidating\" his position by something more permanent than a\r\ndisplay of armed force had been a daily subject of conversation in\r\nthe bosom of his family. The problem, as this misguided man saw\r\nit, was simply by means of an unrivalled display of cunning to\r\nprofit by the Japanese suggestion, and at the same time to leave\r\nthe Japanese in the lurch.\r\n\r\nHis eldest son, an individual of whom it has been said that he had\r\nabsorbed every theory his foreign teachers had taught him without\r\nbeing capable of applying a single one, was the leader in this\r\nfamily intrigue. The unhappy victim of a brutal attempt to kill\r\nhim during the Revolution, this eldest son had been for years\r\nsemi-paralyzed: but brooding over his disaster had only fortified\r\nin him the resolve to succeed his father as legitimate Heir.\r\nHaving saturated himself in Napoleonic literature, and being fully\r\naware of how far a bold leader can go in times of emergency, he\r\ndaily preached to his father the necessity of plucking the pear as\r\nsoon as it was ripe. The older man, being more skilled and more\r\ncautious in statecraft than this youthful visionary, purposely\r\nrejected the idea so long as its execution seemed to him\r\npremature. But at last the point was reached when he was persuaded\r\nto give the monarchy advocates the free hand they solicited, being\r\nlargely helped to this decision by the argument that almost\r\nanything in China could be accomplished under cover of the war,--\r\nSO LONG AS VESTED FOREIGN INTERESTS WERE NOT JEOPARDIZED.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this decision, very shortly after the 18th\r\nJanuary, the dictator's lieutenants had begun to sound the leaders\r\nof public opinion regarding the feasibility of substituting for\r\nthe nominal Republic a Constitutional Monarchy. Thus, in a highly\r\ncharacteristic way, all through the tortuous course of the\r\nJapanese negotiations, to which he was supposed to be devoting his\r\nsole attention in order to save his menaced fatherland, Yuan Shih-\r\nkai was assisting his henchmen to indoctrinate Peking officialdom\r\nwith the idea that the salvation of the State depended more on\r\nrestoring on a modified basis the old empire than in beating off\r\nthe Japanese assault. It was his belief that if some scholar of\r\nnational repute could be found, who would openly champion these\r\nideas and urge them with such persuasiveness and authority that\r\nthey became accepted as a Categorical Imperative, the game would\r\nbe as good as won, the Foreign Powers being too deeply committed\r\nabroad to pay much attention to the Far East. The one man who\r\ncould have produced that result in the way Yuan Shih-kai desired\r\nto see it, the brilliant reformer Liang Chi-chao, famous ever\r\nsince 1898, however, obstinately refused to lend himself to such\r\nwork; and, sooner than be involved in any way in the plot, threw\r\nup his post of Minister of Justice and retired to the neighbouring\r\ncity of Tientsin from which centre he was destined to play a\r\nnotable part.\r\n\r\nThis hitch occasioned a delay in the public propaganda, though not\r\nfor long. Forced to turn to a man of secondary ability, Yuan Shih-\r\nkai now invoked the services of a scholar who had been known to be\r\nhis secret agent in the Old Imperial Senate under the Manchus--a\r\ncertain Yang Tu--whose constant appeals in that chamber had indeed\r\nbeen the means of forcing the Manchus to summon Yuan Shih-kai back\r\nto office to their rescue on the outbreak of the Wuchang rebellion\r\nin 1911. After very little discussion everything was arranged. In\r\nthe person of this ex-Senator, whose whole appearance was\r\ncuriously Machiavellian and decadent, the neo-imperialists at last\r\nfound their champion.\r\n\r\nEvents now moved quickly enough. In the Eastern way, very few\r\nweeks after the Japanese Ultimatum, a society was founded called\r\nthe Society for the Preservation of Peace (Chou An Hut) and\r\nhundreds of affiliations opened in the provinces. Money was spent\r\nlike water to secure adherents, and when the time was deemed ripe\r\nthe now famous pamphlet of Yang Tu was published broadcast, being\r\nin everybody's hands during the idle summer month of August. This\r\ndocument is so remarkable as an illustration of the working of\r\nthat type of Chinese mind which has assimilated some portion of\r\nthe facts of the modern world and yet remains thoroughly\r\nreactionary and illogical, that special attention must be directed\r\nto it. Couched in the form of an argument between two individuals\r\n--one the inquirer, the other the expounder--it has something of\r\nthe old Testament about it both in its blind faith and in its\r\ninsistence on a few simple essentials. It embodies everything\r\nessential to an understanding of the old mentality of China which\r\nhas not yet been completely destroyed. From a literary standpoint\r\nit has also much that is valuable because it is so naive; and\r\nalthough it is concerned with such a distant region of the world\r\nas China its treatment of modern political ideas is so bizarre and\r\nyet so acute that it will repay study.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, for some time, that the significance of this\r\npamphlet was generally understood. It was such an amazing\r\ndeparture from old precedents for the Peking Government to lend\r\nitself to public propaganda as a revolutionary weapon that the\r\nmind of the people refused to credit the fatal turn things were\r\ntaking. But presently when it became known that the \"Society for\r\nthe Preservation of Peace\" was actually housed in the Imperial\r\nCity and in daily relations with the President's Palace; and that\r\nfurthermore the Procurator-General of Peking, in response to\r\ninnumerable memorials of denunciation, having attempted to proceed\r\nagainst the author and publishers of the pamphlet, as well as\r\nagainst the Society, had been forced to leave the capital under\r\nthreats against his life, the document was accepted at its face-\r\nvalue. Almost with a gasp of incredulity China at last realized\r\nthat Yuan Shih-kai had been seduced to the point of openly\r\nattempting to make himself Emperor. From those August days of 1915\r\nuntil the 6th June of the succeeding year, when Fate had her own\r\ngrim revenge, Peking was given up to one of the most amazing\r\nepisodes that has ever been chronicled in the dramatic history of\r\nthe capital. It was as if the old city walls, which had looked\r\ndown on so much real drama, had determined to lend themselves to\r\nthe staging of an unreal comedy. For from first to last the\r\nmonarchy movement had something unreal about it, and might have\r\nbeen the scenario of some vast picture-play. It was acting pure\r\nand simple--acting done in the hope that the people might find it\r\nso admirable that they would acclaim it as real, and call the\r\nDictator their King. But it is time to turn to the arguments of\r\nYang Tu and allow a Chinese to picture the state of his country:\r\n\r\nA DEFENCE OF THE MONARCHICAL MOVEMENT PART I\r\n\r\nMr. Ko (or 'the stranger'): Since the establishment of the\r\nRepublic four years have passed, and upon the President depends\r\nthe preservation of order at home and the maintenance of prestige\r\nabroad. I suppose that after improving her internal administration\r\nfor ten or twenty years, China will become a rich and prosperous\r\ncountry, and will be able to stand in the front rank with western\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: No! No! If China does not make any change in the form of\r\ngovernment there is no hope for her becoming strong and rich;\r\nthere is even no hope for her having a constitutional government.\r\nI say that China is doomed to perish.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: Why so?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: The republican form of government is responsible. The\r\nChinese people are fond of good names, but they do not care much\r\nabout the real welfare of the nation. No plan to save the country\r\nis possible. The formation of the Republic as a result of the\r\nfirst revolution has prevented that.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: Why is it that there is no hope of China's becoming\r\nstrong?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: The people of a republic are accustomed to listen to the\r\ntalk of equality and freedom which must affect the political and\r\nmore especially the military administration. In normal\r\ncircumstances both the military and student classes are required\r\nto lay great emphasis upon unquestioned obedience and respect for\r\nthose who hold high titles. The German and Japanese troops observe\r\nstrict discipline and obey the orders of their chiefs. That is why\r\nthey are regarded as the best soldiers in the world. France and\r\nAmerica are in a different position. They are rich but not strong.\r\nThe sole difference is that Germany and Japan are ruled by\r\nmonarchs while France and America are republics. Our conclusion\r\ntherefore is that no republic can be strong.\r\n\r\nBut since the French and American peoples possess general\r\neducation, they are in a position to assume responsibility for the\r\ngood government of their nations which they keep in good order. On\r\nthat account, although these republics are not strong in dealing\r\nwith the Powers, they can maintain peace at home. China, however,\r\nis unlike these countries, for her standard of popular education\r\nis very low. Most of the Chinese soldiers declare as a\r\ncommonplace; \"We eat the imperial food and we must therefore serve\r\nthe imperial master.\" But now the Imperial family is gone, and for\r\nit has been substituted an impersonal republic, of which they know\r\nnothing whatsoever. These soldiers are now law-abiding because\r\nthey have awe-inspiring and respectful feelings for the man at the\r\nhead of the state. But as the talk of equality and freedom has\r\ngradually influenced them, it has become a more difficult task to\r\ncontrol them. As an example of this corrupt spirit, the commanders\r\nof the Southern troops formerly had to obey their subordinate\r\nofficers and the subordinate officers had to obey their soldiers.\r\nWhenever there was an important question to be discussed, the\r\nsoldiers demanded a voice and a share in the solution. These\r\nsoldiers were called the republican army. Although the Northern\r\ntroops have not yet become so degenerate, still they never\r\nhesitate to disobey the order of their superiors whenever they are\r\nordered to proceed to distant localities. Now we have come to the\r\npoint when we are deeply satisfied if the army of the Republic\r\ndoes not openly mutiny! We cannot expect any more from them save\r\nto hope that they will not mutiny and that they will be able to\r\nsuppress internal disturbances. In the circumstances there is no\r\nuse talking about resistance of a foreign invasion by these\r\nsoldiers. As China, a republic, is situated between two countries,\r\nJapan and Russia, both of which have monarchical governments, how\r\ncan we resist their aggression once diplomatic conversations\r\nbegin? From this it is quite evident that there is nothing which\r\ncan save China from destruction. Therefore I say there is no hope\r\nof China becoming strong.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: But why is it that there is no hope of China ever becoming\r\nrich?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: People may not believe that while France and America are\r\nrich China must remain poor. Nevertheless, the reason why France\r\nand America are rich is that they were allowed to work out their\r\nown salvation without foreign intervention for many years, and\r\nthat at the same time they were free from internal disturbances.\r\nIf any nation wishes to become rich, it must depend upon\r\nindustries for its wealth. Now, what industries most fear is\r\ndisorder and civil war. During the last two years order has been\r\nrestored and many things have returned their former State, but our\r\nindustrial condition is the same as under the Manchu Dynasty.\r\nMerchants who lost their capital during the troublous times and\r\nwho are now poor have no way of retrieving their losses, while\r\nthose who are rich are unwilling to invest their money in\r\nindustrial undertakings, fearing that another civil war may break\r\nout at any moment, since they take the recent abortive second\r\nrevolution as their warning. In future, we shall have disquietude\r\nevery few years; that is whenever the president is changed. Then\r\nour industrial and commercial condition will be in a still worse\r\ncondition. If our industries are not developed, how can we expect\r\nto be strong? Take Mexico as a warning. There is very little\r\ndifference between that country and China, which certainly cannot\r\nbe compared with France and America. Therefore I say there is no\r\nhope for China ever becoming rich.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: Why is it that you say there is no hope for China having a\r\nConstitutional Government?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: A true republic must be conducted by many people\r\npossessing general education, political experience and a certain\r\npolitical morality. Its president is invested with power by the\r\npeople to manage the general affairs of the state. Should the\r\npeople desire to elect Mr. A their president today and Mr. B\r\ntomorrow, it does not make much difference; for the policy of the\r\ncountry may be changed together with the change of the president\r\nwithout there being any danger of disorder of chaos following such\r\nchange. We have a very different problem to solve in China. The\r\nmajority of our people do not know what the republic is, nor do\r\nthey know anything about a Constitution nor have they any true\r\nsense of equality and freedom. Having overthrown the Empire and\r\nestablished in its place a republic they believe that from now on\r\nthey are subservient to no one, and they think they can do as they\r\nplease. Ambitious men hold that any person may be president and if\r\nthey cannot get the presidency by fair means of election they are\r\nprepared to fight for it with the assistance of troops and\r\nrobbers. The second revolution is an illustration of this point.\r\nFrom the moment that the Emperor was deposed, the centralization\r\nof power in the government was destroyed; and no matter who may be\r\nat the head of the country, he cannot restore peace except by the\r\nre-establishment of the monarchy. So at the time when the republic\r\nwas formed, those who had previously advocated Constitutional\r\nGovernment turned into monarchists. Although we have a Provisional\r\nConstitution now and we have all kinds of legislative organs,\r\nwhich give to the country an appearance of a constitutional\r\ngovernment, China has a constitutional government in name only and\r\nis a monarchy in spirit. Had the government refrained from\r\nexercising monarchical power during the last four years, the\r\npeople could not have enjoyed one day of peace. In short, China's\r\nrepublic must be governed by a monarchy through a constitutional\r\ngovernment. If the constitutional government cannot govern the\r\nrepublic, the latter cannot remain. The question of constitutional\r\ngovernment is therefore very important, but it will take ten or\r\ntwenty years before it can be solved.\r\n\r\nLook at the people of China today! They know that something\r\nterrible is going to come sooner or later. They dare not think of\r\nthe future. The corrupt official lines his pocket with unrighteous\r\nmoney, preparing to flee to foreign countries or at least to the\r\nForeign Settlements for safety. The cautious work quietly and do\r\nnot desire to earn merit but merely try to avoid giving offence.\r\nThe scholars and politicians are grandiloquent and discourse upon\r\ntheir subjects in a sublime vein, but they are no better than the\r\ncorrupt officials. As for our President, he can remain at the head\r\nof the State for a few years. At most he may hold office for\r\nseveral terms,--or perhaps for his whole life. Then questions must\r\narise as to who shall succeed him; how to elect his successor; how\r\nmany rivals will there be; whether their policies will be\r\ndifferent from his, etc., etc. He personally has no idea regarding\r\nthe solution of these questions. Even if the president is a\r\nsagacious and capable man, he will not be able to make a policy\r\nfor the country or fix a Constitution which will last for a\r\nhundred years. Because of this he is driven merely to adopt a\r\npolicy so as to maintain peace in his own country and to keep the\r\nnation intact so long as he may live. In the circumstances such a\r\npresident can be considered the best executive head we can have.\r\nThose who are worshippers of the constitutional government cannot\r\ndo more than he does. Here we find the reason for the silence of\r\nthe former advocates of a constitutional administration. They have\r\nrealized that by the formation of the republic the fundamental\r\nproblem of the country has been left unsolved. In this wise it\r\nhappens that the situation is something like this. Whilst the\r\ncountry is governed by an able president, the people enjoy peace\r\nand prosperity. But once an incapable man assumes the presidency,\r\nchaos will become the order of the day, a state of affairs which\r\nwill finally lead to the overthrow of the president himself and\r\nthe destruction of the country. In such circumstances, how can you\r\ndevise a general policy for the country which will last for a\r\nhundred years? I say that there is no hope for China establishing\r\na truly constitutional government.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: In your opinion there is no hope for China becoming strong\r\nand rich or for her acquiring a constitutional government. She has\r\nno choice save ultimately to disappear. And yet is there no plan\r\npossible whereby she may be saved?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: If China wishes to save herself from ultimate\r\ndisappearance from the face of the earth, first of all she must\r\nget rid of the republic. Should she desire wealth and strength,\r\nshe must adopt a constitutional government. Should she want\r\nconstitutional government she must first establish a monarchy.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: How is it that should China desire wealth and strength she\r\nmust first adopt the constitutional form of government?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: Wealth and strength is the object of the country, and a\r\nconstitutional government is the means to realizing this object.\r\nIn the past able rulers could accomplish their purpose without a\r\nconstitutional government. We refer to Emperor Wu of the Han\r\nDynasty and Emperor Tai Chung of the Tang Dynasty. However, when\r\nthese able rulers died their system of administration died with\r\nthem. This contention can be supported by numerous historical\r\ninstances; but suffice to say that in China as well as in Europe,\r\nthe lack of a constitutional government has been the cause of the\r\nweakness of most of the nations in ancient times. Japan was never\r\nknown as a strong nation until she adopted a constitutional\r\ngovernment. The reason is this: when there is no constitutional\r\ngovernment, the country cannot continue to carry out a definite\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nWithin comparatively recent times there was born in Europe the\r\nconstitutional form of government. European nations adopted it,\r\nand they became strong. The most dangerous fate that can confront\r\na nation is that after the death of an able ruler the system of\r\nadministration he has established disappears with him; but this\r\nthe constitutional form of government is able to avert. Take for\r\ninstance William I of Germany who is dead but whose country\r\ncontinues to this day strong and prosperous. It is because of\r\nconstitutional government. The same is true of Japan, which has\r\nadopted constitutional government and which is becoming stronger\r\nand stronger every day. The change of her executive cannot affect\r\nher progress in respect of her strength. From this it is quite\r\nclear that constitutional government is a useful instrument for\r\nbuilding up a country. It is a government with a set of fixed laws\r\nwhich guard the actions of both the people and the president none\r\nof whom can overstep the boundary as specified in the laws. No\r\nruler, whether be he a good man or a bad man, can change one iota\r\nof the laws. The people reap the benefit of this in consequence.\r\nIt is easy to make a country strong and rich but it is difficult\r\nto establish a constitutional government. When a constitutional\r\ngovernment has been established, everything will take care of\r\nitself, prosperity following naturally enough. The adoption of a\r\nconstitutional government at the present moment can be compared to\r\nthe problem of a derailed train. It is hard to put the train back\r\non the track, but once on the track it is very easy to move the\r\ntrain. What we should worry about is not how to make the country\r\nrich and prosperous, but how to form a genuine constitutional\r\ngovernment. Therefore I say that if China desires to be strong and\r\nprosperous, she should first of all adopt the constitutional form\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: I do not understand why it is that a monarchy should be\r\nestablished before the constitutional form of government can be\r\nformed?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: Because if the present system continues there will be\r\nintermittent trouble. At every change of the president there will\r\nbe riot and civil war. In order to avert the possibility of such\r\naweful times place the president in a position which is permanent.\r\nIt follows that the best thing is to make him Emperor. When that\r\nbone of contention is removed, the people will settle down to\r\nbusiness and feel peace in their hearts, and devote their whole\r\nenergy and time to the pursuit of their vocations. It is logical\r\nto assume that after the adoption of the monarchy they will\r\nconcentrate their attention on securing a constitutional\r\ngovernment which they know is the only salvation for their\r\ncountry. As for the Emperor, knowing that he derives his position\r\nfrom the change from a republic, and filled with the desire of\r\npacifying the people, he cannot help sanctioning the formation of\r\nthe constitutional form of government, which in addition, will\r\ninsure to his offspring the continuation of the Throne. Should he\r\nadopt any other course, he will be exposed to great personal\r\ndanger. If he is broadminded, he will further recognize the fact\r\nthat if no constitutional form of government is introduced, his\r\npolicy will perish after his death. Therefore I say that before\r\nthe adoption of the constitutional form of government, a monarchy\r\nshould be established. William I of Germany and the Emperor Meiji\r\nof Japan both tried the constitutional form of government and\r\nfound it a success.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: Please summarize your discussion.\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: In short, the country cannot be saved except through the\r\nestablishment of a constitutional form of government. No\r\nconstitutional government can be formed except through the\r\nestablishment of a monarchy. The constitutional form of government\r\nhas a set of fixed laws, and the monarchy has a definite head who\r\ncannot be changed, in which matters lies the source of national\r\nstrength and wealth.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: What you have said in regard to the adoption of the\r\nconstitutional monarchy as a means of saving the country from\r\ndismemberment is quite true, but I would like to have your opinion\r\non the relative advantages and disadvantages of a republic and a\r\nmonarchy, assuming that China adopts the scheme of a monarchy.\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: I am only too glad to give you my humble opinion on this\r\nmomentous question.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: You have said that China would be devastated by contending\r\narmies of rival leaders trying to capture the presidency. At what\r\nprecise moment will that occur?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: The four hundred million people of China now rely upon the\r\nPresident alone for the protection of their lives and property.\r\nUpon him likewise falls the burden of preserving both peace and\r\nthe balance of power in the Far East. There is no time in the\r\nhistory of China that the Head of the State has had to assume such\r\na heavy responsibility for the protection of life and property and\r\nfor the preservation of peace in Asia; and at no time in our\r\nhistory has the country been in greater danger than at the present\r\nmoment. China can enjoy peace so long as His Excellency Yuan Shih-\r\nkai remains the President, and no longer. Should anything befall\r\nthe President, every business activity will at once be suspended,\r\nshops will be closed, disquietude will prevail, people will become\r\npanic-stricken, the troops uncontrollable, and foreign warship\r\nwill enter our harbours. European and American newspapers will be\r\nfull of special dispatches about the complicated events in China,\r\nand martial law will be declared in every part of the country. All\r\nthis will be due to the uncertainty regarding the succession to\r\nthe presidency.\r\n\r\n It will be seen from the first section of this long and\r\nextraordinary pamphlet how the author develops his argument. One\r\nof his major premises is the inherent unruliness of Republican\r\nsoldiery,--the armies of republics not to be compared with the\r\narmed forces of monarchies,--and consequently constituting a\r\nperpetual menace to good government. Passing on from this, he lays\r\ndown the proposition that China cannot hope to become rich so long\r\nas the fear of civil war is ever-present; and that without a\r\nproper universal education a republic is an impossibility. The\r\nexercise of monarchical power in such circumstances can only be\r\ncalled an inevitable development,--the one goal to be aimed at\r\nbeing the substitution of Constitutional Government for the\r\ndictatorial rule. The author deals at great length with the\r\nbackground to this idea, playing on popular fears to reinforce his\r\ncasuistry. For although constitutional government is insisted upon\r\nas the sole solution, he speedily shows that this\r\nconstitutionalism will depend more on the benevolence of the\r\ndictator than on the action of the people. And should his advice\r\nbe not heeded, when Fortune wills that Yuan Shih-kai's rule shall\r\nend, chaos will ensue owing to the \"uncertainty\" regarding the\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nHere the discussion reaches its climax--for the demand that\r\nsalvation be sought by enthroning Yuan Shih-kai now becomes clear\r\nand unmistakable. Let the author speak for himself.\r\n\r\n Mr. Ko: But it is provided in the Constitutional Compact that a\r\npresident must be selected from among the three candidates whose\r\nnames are now kept in a golden box locked in a stone room. Do you\r\nthink this provision is not sufficient to avert the terrible times\r\nwhich you have just described?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: The provision you have mentioned is useless. Can you find\r\nany person who is able to be at the head of the state besides His\r\nExcellency Yuan Shih-kai? The man who can succeed President Yuan\r\nmust enjoy the implicit confidence of the people and must have\r\nextended his influence all over the country and be known both at\r\nhome and abroad. He must be able to maintain order, and then no\r\nmatter what the constitution provides, he will be unanimously\r\nelected President. He must also be able to assure himself that the\r\ntwo other candidates for the presidency have no hope for success\r\nin the presidential campaign. The provision in the constitution,\r\nas well as the golden casket in which the names of the three\r\ncandidates are kept which you have mentioned, are nothing but\r\nnominal measures. Moreover there is no man in China who answers\r\nthe description of a suitable successor which I have just given.\r\nHere arises a difficult problem; and what has been specified in\r\nthe Constitutional Compact is a vain attempt to solve it. It is\r\npertinent to ask why the law-makers should not have made the law\r\nin such a way that the people could exercise their free choice in\r\nthe matter of the presidential successor? The answer is that there\r\nis reason to fear that a bad man may be elected president by\r\nmanipulations carried out with a masterly hand, thereby\r\njeopardizing the national welfare. This fear has influenced the\r\nconstitution-makers to settle upon three candidates from among\r\nwhom the president must be elected. Then it may be asked why not\r\nfix upon one man instead of upon three since you have already\r\ndeprived the people of part of their freedom? The answer is that:\r\nthere is not a single man whose qualifications are high enough to\r\nbe the successor. As it is, three candidates of equal\r\nqualifications are put forward for the people to their selection.\r\nNo matter how one may argue this important question from the legal\r\npoint of view, there is the fact that the law makers fixed upon\r\nthree candidates for the presidency, believing that we do not\r\npossess a suitable presidential successor. The vital question of\r\nthe day setting aside all paper talk, is whether or not China has\r\na suitable man to succeed President Yuan Shih-kai. Whether or not\r\nthe constitutional compact can be actually carried out in future I\r\ndo not know; but I do know that that instrument will eventually\r\nbecome ineffective.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: I desire a true picture of the chaos which you have hinted\r\nwill ensue in this country. Can you tell me anything along that\r\nline?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: In a time of confusion, the soldiers play the most\r\nimportant part, virtuous and experienced and learned statesmen\r\nbeing unable to cope with the situation. The only qualification\r\nwhich a leader at such a time needs to possess is the control of\r\nthe military, and the ability to suppress Parliament. Should such\r\na person be made the president, he cannot long hold his enviable\r\npost in view of the fact that he cannot possess sufficient\r\ninfluence to control the troops of the whole country. The generals\r\nof equal rank and standing will not obey each other, while the\r\nsoldiers and politicians, seeing a chance in these differences for\r\ntheir advancement, will stir up their feelings and incite one\r\nanother to fight. They will fight hard among themselves. The\r\nrebels, who are now exiles in foreign lands, taking advantage of\r\nthe chaos in China, will return in very little time to perpetrate\r\nthe worst crimes known in human history. The royalists who are in\r\nretirement will likewise come out to fish in muddy waters. Persons\r\nwho have the qualifications of leaders will be used as tools to\r\nfight for the self-aggrandizement of those who use them. I do not\r\nwish to mention names, but I can safely predict that more than ten\r\ndifferent parties will arise at the psychological moment. Men who\r\nwill never be satisfied until they become president, and those who\r\nknow they cannot get the presidency but who are unwilling to serve\r\nothers, will come out one after another. Confusion and disturbance\r\nwill follow with great rapidity. Then foreign countries which have\r\nentertained wild ambitions, availing themselves of the distressful\r\nsituation in China, will stir up ill-feelings among these parties\r\nand so increase the disturbances. When the proper time comes,\r\nvarious countries, unwilling to let a single country enjoy the\r\nprivilege of controlling China, will resort to armed intervention.\r\nIn consequence the eastern problem will end in a rupture of the\r\ninternational peace. Whether China will be turned at that time\r\ninto a battleground for the Chinese people or for the foreign\r\nPowers I cannot tell you. It is too dreadful to think of the\r\nfuture which is enshrouded in a veil of mystery. However, I can\r\ntell you that the result of this awful turmoil will be either the\r\nslicing of China like a melon or the suppression of internal\r\ntrouble with foreign assistance which will lead to dismemberment.\r\nAs to the second result some explanation is necessary. After\r\nforeign countries have helped us to suppress internal\r\ndisturbances, they will select a man of the type of Li Wang of\r\nKorea, who betrayed his country to Japan, and make him Emperor of\r\nChina. Whether this man will be the deposed emperor or a member of\r\nthe Imperial family or the leader of the rebel party, remains to\r\nbe seen. In any event he will be a figurehead in whose hand will\r\nnot be vested political, financial and military power, which will\r\nbe controlled by foreigners. All the valuable mines, various kinds\r\nof industries and our abundant natural resources will likewise be\r\ndeveloped by others. China will thus disappear as a nation.\r\n\r\nIn selecting a man of the Li Wang type, the aforesaid foreign\r\ncountries will desire merely to facilitate the acquisition of\r\nChina's territory. But there can be easily found such a man who\r\nbears remarkable resemblance to Li Wang, and who will be willing\r\nto make a treaty with the foreigners whereby he unpatriotically\r\nsells his country in exchange for a throne which he can never\r\nobtain or keep without outside assistance. His procedure will be\r\nsomething like this: He will make an alliance with a foreign\r\nnation by which the latter will be given the power to carry on\r\nforeign relations on behalf of his country. In the eyes of\r\nforeigners, China will have been destroyed, but the people will\r\ncontinue deceived and made to believe that their country is still\r\nin existence. This is the first step. The second step will be to\r\nimitate the example of Korea and make a treaty with a certain\r\npower, whereby China is annexed and the throne abolished. The\r\nimperial figure-head then flees to the foreign country where he\r\nenjoys an empty title. Should you then try to make him devise\r\nmeans for regaining the lost territory it will be too late. For\r\nChina will have been entirely destroyed by that time. This is the\r\nsecond procedure in the annexation of Chinese territory. The\r\nreason why that foreign country desires to change the republic\r\ninto the monarchy is to set one man on the throne and make him\r\nwitness the whole process of annexation of his country, thereby\r\nsimplifying the matter. When that time has come, the people will\r\nnot be permitted to make any comment upon the form of government\r\nsuitable for China, or upon the destruction of their country. The\r\nrebels who raised the standard of the republic have no principles\r\nand if they now find that some other tactics will help to increase\r\ntheir power they will adopt these tactics. China's republic is\r\ndoomed, no matter what happens. If we do not change it ourselves,\r\nothers will do it for us. Should we undertake the change ourselves\r\nwe can save the nation: otherwise there is no hope for China to\r\nremain a nation. It is to be regretted that our people now assume\r\nan attitude of indifference, being reluctant to look forward to\r\nthe future, and caring not what may happen to them and their\r\ncountry. They are doomed to become slaves after the loss of their\r\nnational independence.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: I am very much frightened by what you have said. You have\r\nstated that the adoption of a constitutional monarchy can avert\r\nsuch terrible consequences; but is there not likely to be\r\ndisturbance during the change of the republic to monarchy, since\r\nsuch disturbance must always accompany the presidential election?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: No comparison can be formed between these two things.\r\nThere may be tumult during the change of the form of government,\r\nbut it will be better in comparison with the chaos that will some\r\nday ensue in the republic. There is no executive head in the\r\ncountry when a republic endeavours to select a presidential\r\nsuccessor. At such a time, the ambitious try to improve their\r\nfuture, while the patriotic are at a loss now to do anything which\r\nwill assist in the maintenance of order. Those who are rebellious\r\nrise in revolt while those who are peace-loving are compelled by\r\ncircumstances to join their rank and file. Should the form of\r\ngovernment be transformed into a monarchical one, and should the\r\ntime for change of the head of the state come, the successor\r\nhaving already been provided for, that will be well-known to the\r\npeople. Those who are patriotic will exert their utmost to\r\npreserve peace, and as result the heir-apparent can peacefully\r\nstep on the throne. There are persons who will contend for the\r\noffice of the President, but not for the throne. Those who contend\r\nfor the office of President do not commit any crime, but those who\r\ntry to seize the throne are rebels. Who dares to contend for the\r\nThrone?\r\n\r\nAt the time of the change of the president in a republic,\r\nambitious persons arise with the intention of capturing this most\r\nhonourable office, but not so when the emperor is changed. Should\r\nthere be a body of persons hostile to the heir-apparent, that body\r\nmust be very small. Therefore I say that the enemies of a\r\nsucceeding Emperor are a few, whilst there are many in the case of\r\na presidential successor. This is the first difference.\r\n\r\nThose who oppose the monarchy are republican enthusiasts or\r\npersons who desire to make use of the name of the republic for\r\ntheir own benefit. These persons will raise trouble even without\r\nthe change of the government. They do not mind disturbing the\r\npeace of the country at the present time when the republic exists.\r\nIt is almost certain that at the first unfurling of the imperial\r\nflags they will at once grasp such an opportune moment and try to\r\nsatisfy their ambition. Should they rise in revolt at the time\r\nwhen the Emperor is changed the Government, supported by the loyal\r\nstatesmen and officials, whose interests are bound up with the\r\nwelfare of the imperial family and whose influence has spread far\r\nand wide, will be able to deal easily with any situation which may\r\ndevelop. Therefore I declare that the successor to the throne has\r\nmore supporters while the presidential successor has few. This is\r\nthe second difference between the republic and the constitutional\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nWhy certain persons will contend for the office of the President\r\ncan be explained by the fact that there is not a single man in the\r\ncountry whose qualifications are above all the others. Succession\r\nto the throne is a question of blood-relation with the reigning\r\nEmperor, and not a question of qualifications. The high officials\r\nwhose qualifications are unusually good are not subservient to\r\nothers but they are obedient to the succeeding Emperor, because of\r\ntheir gratitude for what the imperial family has done for them,\r\nand because their well-being is closely associated with that of\r\nthe imperial household. I can cite an historical incident to\r\nsupport my contention. Under the Manchu Dynasty, at one time\r\nGeneral Chu Chung-tang was entrusted with the task of suppressing\r\nthe Mohammedan rebellion. He appointed General Liu Sung San\r\ngeneralissimo. Upon the death of General Liu, Chu Chung-tang\r\nappointed his subordinate officers to lead the army, but the\r\nsubordinate officers competed for power. Chu Chung-tang finally\r\nmade the step-son of General Liu the Commander-in-Chief and the\r\nofficers and soldiers all obeyed his order as they did his\r\nfather's. But it may be mentioned that this young man was not more\r\nable than any of his father's subordinate commanders. Nevertheless\r\nprestige counted. He owed his success to his natural\r\nqualification, being a step-son to General Liu. So is the case\r\nwith the emperor whose successor nobody dares openly to defy--to\r\nsay nothing of actually disputing his right to the throne. This is\r\nthe third difference between the republic and the monarchy.\r\n\r\nI will not discuss the question: as to whether there being no\r\nrighteous and able heir-apparent to succeed his Emperor-father,\r\ngreat danger may not confront the nation. However, in order to\r\nprovide against any such case, I advocate that the formation of a\r\nconstitutional government should go hand in hand with the\r\nestablishment of the monarchy. At first it is difficult to\r\nestablish and carry out a constitutional government, but once it\r\nis formed it will be comparatively easy. When the constitutional\r\ngovernment has been established, the Emperor will have to seek his\r\nfame in such useful things as the defence of his country and the\r\nconquest of his enemy. Everything has to progress, and men\r\npossessing European education will be made use of by the reigning\r\nfamily. The first Emperor will certainly do all he can to capture\r\nthe hearts of the people by means of adopting and carrying out in\r\nletter as well as in spirit constitutional government. The heir-\r\napparent will pay attention to all new reforms and new things.\r\nShould he do so, the people will be able to console themselves by\r\nsaying that they will always be the people of a constitutional\r\nmonarchy even after the succession to the throne of the heir-\r\napparent. When the time comes for the heir-apparent to mount the\r\nthrone the people will extend to him their cordial welcome, and\r\nthere will be no need to worry about internal disturbances.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I conclude that the successor to the presidential chair\r\nhas to prevent chaos by wielding the monarchical power, while the\r\nnew emperor can avert internal disquietude forever by means of his\r\nconstitutional government. This is the fourth difference between\r\nthe republic and the monarchy. These four differences are\r\naccountable for the fact that there will not be as much\r\ndisturbance at the time of the change of emperors as at the time\r\nwhen the president is changed.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: I can understand what you have said with regard to the\r\nadvantages and disadvantages of the republic and the monarchy, but\r\nthere are many problems connected with the formation of a\r\nconstitutional monarchy which we have to solve. Why is it that the\r\nattempt to introduce constitutional government during the last\r\nyears of the Manchu Dynasty proved a failure?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: The constitutional government of the Manchu Dynasty was\r\none in name only, and as such the forerunner of the revolution of\r\n1911. Towards the end of the Manchu Dynasty, the talk of starting\r\na revolution to overthrow the imperial regime was in everybody's\r\nmouth, although the constitutional party endeavoured to accomplish\r\nsomething really useful. At that time His Excellency Yuan Shih-kai\r\nwas the grand chancellor, and realizing the fact that nothing\r\nexcept the adoption of a constitutional government could save the\r\nthrone of the Manchus, he assumed the leadership of the\r\nconstitutional party, which surpassed in strength the\r\nrevolutionary party as a result of his active support. The\r\npeople's hearts completely turned to the constitutional party for\r\nsalvation, while the revolutionary party lost that popular support\r\nwhich it had formerly enjoyed. Then it seemed that the imperial\r\nhousehold would soon adopt the constitutional monarchy and the\r\nthreatening revolution could be averted. Unfortunately, the\r\nelaborate plans of His Excellency Yuan Shih-kai regarding the\r\nadoption of the constitutional government were not carried out by\r\nthe imperial household. A great change took place: His Excellency\r\nretired to his native province; and after losing this powerful\r\nleader the constitutional party was pitilessly shattered. A\r\nmonarchist party suddenly made its appearance on the political\r\narena to assist the imperial family, which pretended to do its\r\nvery best for the development of a constitutional government, but\r\nsecretly exerted itself to the utmost for the possession and\r\nretention of the real power. This double-dealing resulted in\r\nbringing about the revolution of 1911. For instance, when the\r\npeople cried for the convening of a parliament, the imperial\r\nfamily said \"No.\" The people also failed to secure the abolition\r\nof certain official organs for the imperialists. They lost\r\nconfidence in the Reigning House, and simultaneously the\r\nrevolutionary party raised its banner and gathered its supporters\r\nfrom every part of the country. As soon as the revolt started at\r\nWuchang the troops all over the country joined in the movement to\r\noverthrow the Manchu Dynasty. The members of the Imperial Senate,\r\nmost of whom were members of the constitutional party, could not\r\nhelp showing their sympathy with the revolutionists. At last the\r\nimperial household issued a proclamation containing Nineteen\r\nArticles--a veritable magna carta--but it was too late. The\r\nconstitutional government which was about to be formed was thus\r\nlaid aside. What the imperial family did was the mere organization\r\nof an advisory council. A famous foreign scholar aptly remarked:\r\n\"A false constitutional government will eventually result in a\r\ntrue revolution.\" In trying to deceive the people by means of a\r\nfalse constitutional government the imperial house encompassed its\r\nown destruction. Once His Excellency Yuan Shih-kai stated in a\r\nmemorial to the throne that there were only two alternatives: to\r\ngive the people a constitutional government or to have them\r\nrevolt. What happened afterwards is a matter of common knowledge.\r\nTherefore I say that the government which the imperial family\r\nattempted to form was not a constitutional government.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: Thank you for your discussion of the attempt of the\r\nimperial household to establish a constitutional government; but\r\nhow about the Provisional Constitution, the parliament and the\r\ncabinet in the first and second years of the Republic? The\r\nparliament was then so powerful that the government was absolutely\r\nat its mercy, thereby disturbing the peaceful condition of the\r\ncountry. The people have tasted much of the bitterness of\r\nconstitutional government. Should you mention the name of\r\nconstitutional government again they would be thoroughly\r\nfrightened. Is that true?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: During the first and second years of the Republic, in my\r\nmany conversations with the members of the Kuo Ming Tang, I said\r\nthat the republic could not form an efficient method of control,\r\nand that there would be an over centration of power through the\r\nadoption of monarchical methods of ruling, knowing as well as I\r\ndid the standards of our people. When the members of the Kuo Ming\r\nTang came to draw up the Provisional Constitution they purposely\r\ntook precisely the opposite course of action and ignored my\r\nsuggestion. It may, however, be mentioned that the Provisional\r\nConstitution made in Nanking was not so bad, but after the\r\ngovernment was removed to Peking, the Kuo Ming Tang people tied\r\nthe hand and foot of the government by means of the Cabinet System\r\nand other restrictions with the intention of weakening the power\r\nof the central administration in order that they might be able to\r\nstart another revolution. From the dissolution of the Nanking\r\ngovernment to the time of the second revolution they had this one\r\nobject in view, namely to weaken the power of the central\r\nadministration so that they could contend for the office of the\r\npresident by raising further internal troubles in China. Those\r\nmembers of the Kuo Ming Tang who made the constitution know as\r\nwell as I that China's republic must be governed through a\r\nmonarchical administration; and therefore the unreasonable\r\nrestrictions in the Provisional Constitution were purposely\r\ninserted.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: What is the difference between the constitutional\r\ngovernment which you have proposed and the constitutional\r\ngovernment which the Manchu Dynasty intended to adopt?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: The difference lies in the proper method of procedure and\r\nin honesty of purpose, which are imperative if constitutional\r\ngovernment expects to be successful.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: What do you mean by the proper method of procedure?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: The Provisional Constitution made in Nanking, which was\r\nconsidered good, is not suitable for insertion in the future\r\nconstitution, should a constitutional monarchy be established. In\r\nmaking a constitution for the future constitutional monarchy we\r\nhave to consult the constitutions of the monarchies of the world.\r\nThey can be divided into three classes which are represented by\r\nEngland, Prussia and Japan. England is advanced in its\r\nconstitutional government, which has been in existence for\r\nthousands of years, (sic) and is the best of all in the world. The\r\nEnglish king enjoys his empty title and the real power of the\r\ncountry is exercised by the parliament, which makes all the laws\r\nfor the nation. As to Prussia, the constitutional monarchy was\r\nestablished when the people started a revolution. The ruler of\r\nPrussia was compelled to convene a parliament and submitted to\r\nthat legal body a constitution. Prussia's constitution was made by\r\nits ruler together with the parliament. Its constitutional\r\ngovernment is not so good as the English. As to the Japanese\r\nconstitutional monarchy, the Emperor made a constitution and then\r\nconvened a parliament. The constitutional power of the Japanese\r\npeople is still less than that of the Prussian people. According\r\nto the standard of our people we cannot adopt the English\r\nconstitution as our model, for it is too advanced. The best thing\r\nfor us to do is to adopt part of the Prussian and part of the\r\nJapanese in our constitution-making. As our people are better\r\neducated now than ever before, it is decidedly unwise entirely to\r\nadopt the Japanese method, that is, for the Emperor to make a\r\nconstitution without the approval of the parliament and then to\r\nconvoke a legislative body. In the circumstances China should\r\nadopt the Prussian method as described above with some\r\nmodifications, which will be very suitable to our conditions. As\r\nto the contents of the constitution we can copy such articles as\r\nthose providing the right for the issue of urgent orders and\r\nappropriation of special funds, etc. from the Japanese\r\nConstitution, so that the power of the ruler can be increased\r\nwithout showing the slightest contempt for the legislative organ.\r\nI consider that this is the proper method of procedure for the\r\nformation of a constitutional monarchy for China.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: Can I know something about the contents of our future\r\nconstitution in advance?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: If you want to know them in detail I recommend you to read\r\nthe Constitutions of Prussia and Japan. But I can tell you this\r\nmuch. Needless to say that such stipulations as articles\r\nguaranteeing the rights of the people and the power of the\r\nparliament will surely be worked into the future constitution.\r\nThese are found in almost every constitution in the world. But as\r\nthe former Provisional Constitution has so provided that the power\r\nof the parliament is unlimited, while that of the president is\r\nvery small the Chief Executive, besides conferring decorations and\r\ngiving Orders of Merit, having almost nothing to do without the\r\napproval of the Senate, it is certain that nothing will be taken\r\nfrom that instrument for the future constitution. Nor will the\r\nmakers of the future constitution take anything from the nineteen\r\ncapitulations offered by the Manchu Government, which gave too\r\nmuch power to the legislative organ. According to the Nineteen\r\nArticles the Advisory Council was to draw up the constitution,\r\nwhich was to be ratified by the parliament; the Premier being\r\nelected by the parliament; whilst the use of the army and navy\r\nrequired the parliament's sanction; the making of treaties with\r\nforeign countries have likewise to be approved by the parliament,\r\netc., etc. Such strict stipulations which are not even known in\r\nsuch an advanced country in matters constitutional as England were\r\nextorted from the imperial family by the advisory council.\r\nTherefore it is most unlikely that the makers of the future\r\nconstitution will take any article from the nineteen capitulations\r\nof \"confidence.\" They will use the Constitutions of Japan and\r\nPrussia as joint model and will always have in their mind the\r\nactual conditions of this country and the standard of the people.\r\nIn short, they will copy some of the articles in the Japanese\r\nconstitution, and adopt the Prussian method of procedure for the\r\nmaking of the constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: What do you mean by honesty?\r\n\r\nMr. Hu: It is a bad policy to deceive the people. Individually the\r\npeople are simple, but they cannot be deceived collectively. The\r\nManchu Government committed an irretrievable mistake by promising\r\nthe people a constitutional government but never carrying out\r\ntheir promise. This attitude on the part of the then reigning\r\nhouse brought about the first revolution. As the standard of our\r\npeople at the present time is not very high, they will be\r\nsatisfied with less power if it is properly given to them. Should\r\nany one attempt to deceive them his cause will finally be lost. I\r\ndo not know how much power the people and the parliament will get\r\nin the constitutional monarchy, but I would like to point out here\r\nthat it is better to give them less power than to deceive them. If\r\nthey are given less power, and if they want more, they will\r\ncontend for it. Should the government deem it advisable to give\r\nthem a little more, well and good. Should they be unfit for the\r\npossession of greater power, the government can issue a\r\nproclamation giving the reasons for not complying with their\r\nrequest, and they will not raise trouble knowing the true\r\nintention of the government. However, honesty is the most\r\nimportant element in the creation of a constitutional monarchy. It\r\nis easy and simple to practise it. The parliament must have the\r\npower to decide the laws and fix the budgets. Should its decision\r\nbe too idealistic or contrary to the real welfare of the country,\r\nthe Government can explain its faults and request it to reconsider\r\nits decision. Should the parliament return the same decision, the\r\nGovernment can dissolve it and convoke another parliament. In so\r\ndoing the Government respects the parliament instead of despising\r\nit. But what the parliament has decided should be carried out\r\nstrictly by the Government, and thus we will have a real\r\nconstitutional Government. It is easy to talk but difficult to\r\nact, but China like all other countries has to go through the\r\nexperimental stage and face all kinds of difficulties before a\r\ngenuine constitutional government can be evolved. The beginning is\r\ndifficult but once the difficulty is over everything will go on\r\nsmoothly. I emphasize that it is better to give the people less\r\npower at the beginning than to deceive them. Be honest with them\r\nis my policy.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko: I thank you very much for what you have said. Your\r\ndiscussion is interesting and I can understand it well. The proper\r\nmethod of procedure and honesty of purpose which you have\r\nmentioned will tend to wipe out all former corruption.\r\n\r\nMr. Ko, or the stranger, then departed.\r\n\r\n On this note the pamphleteer abruptly ends. Having discussed ad\r\nnauseam the inadequacy of all existing arrangements, even those\r\nmade by Yuan Shih-kai himself, to secure a peaceful succession to\r\nthe presidency; and having again insisted upon the evil part\r\nsoldiery cannot fail to play, he introduces a new peril, the\r\ncertainty that the foreign Powers will set up a puppet Emperor\r\nunless China solves this problem herself, the case of Korea being\r\ninvoked as an example of the fate of divided nations. Fear of\r\nJapan and the precedent of Korea, being familiar phenomena, are\r\ngiven a capital in all this debate, being secondary only to the\r\ncrucial business of ensuring the peaceful succession to the\r\nsupreme office. The transparent manner in which the history of the\r\nfirst three years of the Republic is handled in order to drive\r\nhome these arguments will be very apparent. A fit crown is put on\r\nthe whole business by the final suggestion that the Constitutional\r\nGovernment of China under the new empire must be a mixture of the\r\nPrussian and Japanese systems, Yang Tu's last words being that it\r\nis best to be honest with the people! No more damning indictment\r\nof Yuan Shih-kai's regime could possibly have been penned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE MONARCHY PLOT\r\n\r\nTHE MEMORANDUM OF DR. GOODNOW\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough this extraordinary pamphlet was soon accepted by Chinese\r\nsociety as a semi-official warning of what was coming, it alone\r\nwas not sufficient to launch a movement which to be successful\r\nrequired the benign endorsement of foreign opinion. The Chinese\r\npamphleteer had dealt with the emotional side of the case: it was\r\nnecessary to reinforce his arguments with an appeal which would be\r\nunderstood by Western statesmen as well as by Eastern politicians.\r\nYuan Shih-kai, still pretending to stand aside, had kept his\r\nattention concentrated on this very essential matter; for, as we\r\nhave repeatedly pointed out, he never failed to understand the\r\nsuperlative value of foreign support in all his enterprises,--that\r\nsupport being given an exaggerated value by the public thanks to\r\nChina's reliance on foreign money. Accordingly, as if still\r\nunconvinced, he now very naively requested the opinion of his\r\nchief legal adviser, Dr. Goodnow, an American who had been\r\nappointed to his office through the instrumentality of the Board\r\nof the Carnegie Institute as a most competent authority on\r\nAdministrative Law.\r\n\r\nEven in this most serious matter the element of comedy was not\r\nlacking. Dr. Goodnow had by special arrangement returned to Peking\r\nat the psychological moment; for having kicked his heels during\r\nmany weary months in the capital, he had been permitted in 1914 to\r\ntake up the appointment of President of an American University on\r\ncondition that he would be available for legal \"advice\" whenever\r\nwanted. The Summer vacation gave him the opportunity of revisiting\r\nin the capacity of a transient the scenes of his former idleness;\r\nand the holiday-task set him by his large-hearted patron was to\r\nprove in as few folios as possible that China ought to be a\r\nMonarchy and not a Republic--a theme on which every schoolboy\r\ncould no doubt write with fluency. Consequently Dr. Goodnow,\r\narming himself with a limited amount of paper and ink, produced in\r\nvery few days the Memorandum which follows,--a document which it\r\nis difficult to speak of dispassionately since it seems to have\r\nbeen deliberately designed to play into the hands of a man who was\r\nnow openly set on betraying the trust the nation reposed in him,\r\nand who was ready to wade through rivers of blood to satisfy his\r\ninsensate ambition.\r\n\r\nNothing precisely similar to this Goodnow Memorandum has ever been\r\nseen before in the history of Asia: it was the ultramodern spirit\r\nimpressed into the service of mediaeval minds. In any other\r\ncapital of the world the publication of such a subversive\r\ndocument, following the Yang Tu pamphlet, would have led to riot\r\nand tumult. In China, the home of pacifism, the politicians and\r\npeople bowed their heads and bided their time. Even foreign\r\ncircles in China were somewhat nonplussed by the insouciance\r\ndisplayed by the peripatetic legal authority; and the Memorandum\r\nwas for many days spoken of as an unnecessary indiscretion.\r\n[Footnote: It is perhaps of importance to note that Dr. Goodnow\r\ncarried out all his studies in Germany.] Fastening at once on the\r\npoint to which Yang Tu had ascribed such importance--the question\r\nof succession--Dr. Goodnow in his arguments certainly shows a\r\ndetachment from received principles which has an old-world flavour\r\nabout it, and which has damned him forever in the eyes of the\r\nrising generation in China. The version which follows is the\r\ntranslation of the Chinese translation, the original English\r\nMemorandum having been either mislaid or destroyed; and it is best\r\nthat this argument should be carefully digested before we add our\r\ncomments.\r\n\r\nDR. GOODNOW'S MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nA country must have a certain form of government, and usually the\r\nparticular form of government of a particular country is not the\r\nresult of the choice of the people of that country. There is not\r\nany possibility even for the most intellectual to exercise any\r\nmental influence over the question. Whether it be a monarchy or\r\nrepublic, it cannot be the creation of human power except when it\r\nis suitable to the historical, habitual, social and financial\r\nconditions of that country. If an unsuitable form of government is\r\ndecided upon, it may remain for a short while, but eventually a\r\nsystem better suited will take its place.\r\n\r\nIn short, the form of government of a country is usually the\r\nnatural and only result of its circumstances. The reasons for such\r\nan outcome are many, but the principal one is Force. If we study\r\nthe monarchical countries we will find that usually a dynasty is\r\ncreated by a person who is capable of controlling the force of the\r\nentire country and overthrowing other persons opposed to him,\r\nworking towards his goal with an undaunted spirit. If this man is\r\ncapable of ruling the nation and if he is a rare genius of the\r\nday, and the conditions of the country are suited for a\r\nmonarchical government, he as a rule creates a new dynasty and his\r\ndescendants inherit the same from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nIf this is so, then the solution of a difficult position of a\r\ncountry is to be found in a monarchy rather than a republic. For\r\non the death of a monarch no doubt exists as to who shall succeed\r\nhim, and there is no need of an election or other procedure.\r\nEnglishmen say, \"The King is dead, Long live the King.\" This\r\nexpresses the point. But in order to attain this point it is\r\nnecessary that the law of succession be definitely defined and\r\npublicly approved; otherwise there will not be lacking, on the\r\ndeath of the monarch, men aspiring to the throne; and as no one is\r\nqualified to settle the dispute for power, internal disturbance\r\nwill be the result.\r\n\r\nHistorically speaking no law of succession is so permanently\r\nsatisfactory as that used by the nations of Europe. According to\r\nthis system the right of succession belongs to the eldest son of\r\nthe monarch, or failing him, the nearest and eldest male relative.\r\nThe right of succession, however, may be voluntarily surrendered\r\nby the rightful successor if he so desires; thus if the eldest son\r\ndeclines to succeed to the throne the second son takes his place.\r\nThis is the rule of Europe.\r\n\r\nIf instead of this law of a succession a system is adopted by\r\nwhich the successor is chosen by the monarch from among his sons\r\nor relatives without any provision being made for the rights of\r\nthe eldest son, disturbance will be the inevitable result. There\r\nwill not be a few who would like to take possession of the throne\r\nand they will certainly plot in the very confines of the palace,\r\nresulting in an increase of the sufferings of an aged monarch;\r\nand, even if the disaster of civil war be avoided, much dispute\r\nwill arise owing to the uncertainty of the successor--a dangerous\r\nsituation indeed.\r\n\r\nSuch is the lesson we learn from history. The conclusion is,\r\nspeaking from the viewpoint of the problem of transmission of\r\npower, that the superiority of the monarchical system over the\r\nrepublican system is seen in the law of succession,--that is the\r\neldest son of the ruler should succeed to the throne.\r\n\r\nLeaving out the nations of ancient times, the majority of\r\ncountries in Europe and Asia have adopted the monarchical system.\r\nThere are, however, exceptions such as Wen-ni-shih (Venice) and\r\nSwitzerland, which adopted the republican form of government; but\r\nthey are in the minority while most of the great nations of the\r\nworld have adopted the monarchical form of government.\r\n\r\nDuring the recent century and a half the attitude of Europe has\r\nundergone a sudden change and the general tendency is to discredit\r\nmonarchism and adopt republicanism. The one great European power\r\nwhich first attempted to make a trial of republicanism is Great\r\nBritain. In the Seventeenth Century a revolution broke out in\r\nEngland and King Charles I was condemned to death by Parliament\r\nand executed as a traitor to the nation. A republic was\r\nestablished and the administration was called republican with\r\nCromwell as regent, i.e. President, Cromwell was able to control\r\nthe power of government because at the head of the revolutionary\r\narmy he defeated the King. This English republic however, only\r\nexisted for a few years and was finally defeated in turn. The\r\nreason was that the problem of succession after the death of\r\nCromwell was difficult to solve. Cromwell had a desire to place\r\nhis son in his place as regent after his death, but as the English\r\npeople were then unsuited for a republic and his son had not the\r\nability to act as chief executive, the republic of England\r\nsuddenly disappeared. The British people then abandoned the\r\nrepublican system and readopted the monarchical system. Thus\r\nCharles II, the son of Charles I, was made King not only with the\r\nsupport of the army but also with the general consent of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe second European race which attempted to have a republic was\r\nthe American. In the Eighteenth Century the United States of\r\nAmerica was established in consequence of the success of a\r\nrevolution. But the American revolution was not at first intended\r\nto overthrow the monarchy. What it sought to do was to throw off\r\nthe yoke of the monarchy and become independent. The revolution,\r\nhowever, succeeded and the circumstances were such that there was\r\nno other alternative but to have a republic: for there was no\r\nroyal or Imperial descendant to shoulder the responsibilities of\r\nthe state. Another factor was the influence of the advocates of\r\nrepublicanism who came to America in the previous century from\r\nEngland and saturated the minds of the Americans with the ideas of\r\nrepublicanism. The minds of the American people were so imbued\r\nwith the ideas of republicanism that a republican form of\r\ngovernment was the ideal of the entire race. Had General\r\nWashington--the leader of the revolutionary army--had the desire\r\nto become a monarch himself he would probably have been\r\nsuccessful. But Washington's one aim was to respect republicanism\r\nand he had no aspiration to become King. Besides he had no son\r\ncapable of succeeding him on the throne. Consequently on the day\r\nindependence was won, the republican form of government was\r\nadopted without hesitation, and it has survived over a hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to ask whether the result of the establishment of\r\nthe American Republic has been good or bad. The republican form of\r\ngovernment is really the making of the United States of America.\r\nBut it should be remembered that long before the establishment of\r\nthe republic, the American people had already learned the good\r\nlaws and ordinances of England, and the constitution and\r\nparliamentary system of England had been long in use in America\r\nfor over a hundred years. Therefore the change in 1789 from a\r\ncolony into a Republic was not a sudden change from a monarchy to\r\na republic. Thorough preparations had been made and self-\r\ngovernment was well practised before the establishment of the\r\nrepublic. Not only this, but the intellectual standard of the\r\nAmerican people was then already very high; for ever since the\r\nbeginning of American history attention was given to universal\r\neducation. No youth could be found who could not read, and the\r\nextent of education can thus be gauged.\r\n\r\nSoon after the formation of the American Republic, the French\r\nRepublic followed in her footsteps. Now in France a monarchical\r\ngovernment was in existence before the declaration of\r\nindependence, and the supreme power of administration was in the\r\nhands of the King. The people, having never participated in the\r\nadministration and lacking experience in self-government, made a\r\npoor experiment of the republican system which they suddenly set\r\nup. The result was that for many years disorder reigned, and the\r\ntyranny of the military governments held sway one after another.\r\nAfter the defeat of Napoleon, the monarchical system was restored\r\nas a result of the intervention of other Powers. The second\r\nrevolution in 1830 again resulted in the restoration of the\r\nmonarchy but the power of the common people was considerably\r\nincreased. The monarchy was again overthrown in 1848 and a\r\nRepublic formed in its stead--the nephew of Napoleon was then made\r\nPresident. This President, however, once more discarded\r\nrepublicanism and set up a monarchy for himself. It was not until\r\nafter the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 that Napoleon III was\r\noverthrown and the final Republic established which has lived for\r\nhalf a century now, there being every likelihood of its continuing\r\nin its present form.\r\n\r\nIndeed the Republic of France has every prospect of being\r\npermanent, but the permanency is only the result of a hundred\r\nyears' political revolution. For a hundred years the foundations\r\nwere being laid by means of an energetic and persistent campaign\r\nof education, which increased the political knowledge of the\r\npeople. The people were also allowed to participate in political\r\naffairs, and so gained experience in self-government. This is why\r\nthe French Republic is a success. Then in France and America they\r\nhave found a solution for the difficult problem of the nation,\r\nthat is the problem of succession of the government in power. The\r\nPresident of France is elected by the Parliament while the\r\nPresident of America is elected by the people. The people of these\r\ntwo countries are all experienced in self-government as a result\r\nof participation in political affairs. Furthermore, for the last\r\nfifty years these two countries have all laid emphasis on\r\nuniversal education by having an extensive system of schools,\r\nsubsidized by the Government. The intellectual standard of these\r\ntwo people is therefore fairly high.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the examples set up by France and America, at the\r\nend of the Eighteenth Century the Spanish colonies in Central and\r\nSouth America also declared their independence one after the\r\nother. The conditions then prevailing in those countries were\r\nsomewhat similar to those of America. When their independence was\r\ndeclared, it seemed that the republican system was best suited to\r\ntheir condition. For on the one hand there was no imperial house\r\nto direct the people, on the other hand the Republic of North\r\nAmerica was a good example to follow. Public opinion was at that\r\ntime unanimous that since the republican form of government was\r\nthe ideal form, it was suitable for any country and any people.\r\nThe idea thus quickly spread and almost every country became a\r\nrepublic. The independence of these countries, however, was\r\nsecured only at the cost of a hard struggle and once the spirit of\r\nrebellion was aroused it became difficult to suppress in a short\r\nwhile. And since education was not then universal the intellect of\r\nthe people was low. What they were expert in was in autocratic\r\nmethods. No task is harder than to establish a republic in a\r\ncountry, the intelligence of whose people is low. These republics,\r\ntherefore, reaped no good results although they tried to retain\r\nrepublicanism unnaturally. The consequence is that the republics\r\nof Central and South America have been a living drama of\r\ncontinuous internal disturbance. One after another their military\r\nleaders have grasped the power of administration. Occasionally\r\nthere has been peace but this peace has only been secured by the\r\niron hand of one or two powerful men holding the power. Such\r\npowerful men, however, seldom pay any attention to educational\r\nmatters, and one never hears of their establishing any schools. As\r\nto the people under them, they are not allowed to participate in\r\npolitical affairs by which their experience in politics may be\r\nripened. The result is, on the man in power becoming sick or\r\ndying--and the iron rule relaxed--that those who wish to usurp the\r\npower of the state rise at once; and as the satisfactory solution\r\nof the problem of succession cannot be found, those undertakings\r\nwhich have made progress during the time of peace are swept away\r\nwithout a single exception. In extreme cases the disturbances\r\ncontinues to such an extent that the country falls into a state of\r\nanarchy. Thus the social and financial factors of the whole\r\ncountry are trodden on and destroyed under foot. The conditions\r\nnow prevailing in Mexico have been many times duplicated in other\r\nrepublics in Central and South America. For this can be the only\r\nresult from adopting the republican form of government where the\r\npolitical and financial conditions are unsuited. Diaz, a military\r\nleader, once held the power of state in his own hand, and when he\r\nbecame the President of Mexico it looked as if the political\r\nproblem was solved thereby. Diaz, however, did not push education\r\nbut instead oppressed the people and did not allow them to\r\nparticipate in politics. When he was advanced in age and his\r\ninfluence decreased, he lost entire control once the banner of\r\nrebellion was raised. Ever since the overthrow of Diaz, military\r\nleaders of that country have been fighting one another and the\r\ndisturbance is developing even today. In the present circumstances\r\nthere is no other means to solve the political problem of Mexico\r\nexcept by intervention from abroad. (Sic.)\r\n\r\nAmong the republics of Central and South America, however, there\r\nare some which have made fairly good progress, the most prominent\r\nof which are Argentina, Chili, and Peru. For some time there was\r\ndisorder in the first two republics immediately after the adoption\r\nof the republican system, but later peace was gradually restored\r\nand the people have been enjoying peace. As regards Peru, although\r\nsome disturbances have occurred since the establishment of the\r\nrepublican government, the life of the Republic as a whole has\r\nbeen peaceful. All of these three countries, however, developed\r\nconstitutional government with the utmost vigour. Even as far back\r\nas in the earlier part of the Nineteenth Century Argentina and\r\nChili were already endeavouring to excel each other in their\r\nprogress, and as for Peru, its people were encouraged even while\r\nunder the Imperial regime, to participate in political affairs.\r\nThe success of these three republics is, therefore, not a mere\r\nchance happening.\r\n\r\nThe study of the experiences of these republics of Central and\r\nSouth America and the history of France and the United States\r\nbrings forward two points which we should carefully consider:--\r\n\r\n1. In order to make a satisfactory solution of the problem of\r\nsuccession to the chief executive in a republican country, it is\r\nnecessary that the country be in possession of an extensive system\r\nof schools; that the intellect of its people has been brought up\r\nto a high Standard by means of a patient process of universal\r\neducation; and that they be given a chance to participate in\r\npolitical affairs for the purpose of gaining the needed\r\nexperience, before the republican form can be adopted without\r\nharm;\r\n\r\n2. It is certain that the adoption of a republican form of\r\ngovernment in a country where the people are low in intellect and\r\nlack experience and knowledge in political affairs, will not yield\r\nany good result. For as the position of the President is not\r\nhereditary, and consequently the problem of succession cannot be\r\nsatisfactorily solved, the result will be a military dictatorship.\r\nIt might be possible to have a short-lived peace but such a period\r\nof peace is usually intermingled with periods of disturbances,\r\nduring which the unduly ambitious people may rise and struggle\r\nwith each other for the control of power, and the disaster which\r\nwill follow will be irremediable.\r\n\r\nThis is not all. The present tendency is that the European and\r\nother western Powers will not tolerate the existence of a military\r\ngovernment in the world; for experience shows that the result of\r\nmilitary government is anarchy. Now this is of vital importance to\r\nthe interests of the European Powers. Since their financial\r\ninfluence has extended so far, their capital as well as their\r\ncommercial undertakings of all branches and sorts have reached\r\nevery corner of the world, they will not hesitate to express their\r\nviews for the sake of peace, as to the system of government a\r\ncountry should adopt, although they have no right to interfere\r\nwith the adoption of a form of government by another nation. For\r\nunless this is done they cannot hope to get the due profit on the\r\ncapital they have invested. If this view is carried to the\r\nextreme, the political independence of a nation may be interfered\r\nwith or even the Government may be replaced with some other organ.\r\nIf such steps are necessary to attain their views the Powers will\r\nnot scruple to take them. Therefore no nation will be allowed\r\nhereafter to choose its own form of government if that results in\r\nconstant revolution, as in the case of South America in the last\r\ncentury. The Governments of the future should, therefore,\r\ncarefully consider the system to be adopted for the maintenance of\r\npeace; otherwise control by foreigners will be unavoidable.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to consider what significance these points\r\nreviewed above have for the political conditions of China. China,\r\nowing to the folly of an absolute monarchical system, has\r\nneglected the education of the masses, whose intellectual\r\nattainments have been consequently of a low standard. Then, there\r\nis the additional fact that the people have never had a voice in\r\nthe doings of their government. Therefore they have not the\r\nability to discuss politics. Four years ago the absolute monarchy\r\nwas suddenly changed into a Republic. This movement was all too\r\nsudden to expect good results. If the Manchus had not been an\r\nalien race, which the country wished to overthrow, the best step\r\nwhich could then have been adopted was to retain the Emperor and\r\ngradually lead him to a constitutional government. What the\r\nCommissioners on Constitutional Government suggested was quite\r\npractical if carried out gradually until perfection was reached.\r\nUnfortunately the feeling of alien control was bitter to the\r\npeople and the maintenance of the throne was an utter\r\nimpossibility. Thus the monarchy was overthrown and the adoption\r\nof a republican system was the only alternative.\r\n\r\nThus we see that China has during the last few years been\r\nprogressing in constitutional government. The pioneering stage of\r\nthe process was, however, not ideal. The results could have been\r\nmuch better if a person of royal blood, respected by the people,\r\nhad come out and offered his service. Under the present conditions\r\nChina has not yet solved the problem of the succession to the\r\nPresidency. What provisions we have now are not perfect. If the\r\nPresident should one day give up his power the difficulties\r\nexperienced by other nations will manifest themselves again in\r\nChina. The conditions in other Countries are similar to those\r\nobtaining in China and the dangers are also the same. It is quite\r\nwithin the bounds of possibility that the situation might threaten\r\nChina's independence if internal disturbance should occur in\r\nconnection with this problem and not be immediately put down.\r\n\r\nWhat attitude then should those who have the good of the nation at\r\nheart, take under the present circumstances? Should they advocate\r\nthe continuance of the Republic or suggest a change for a\r\nmonarchy? It is difficult to answer these questions. But I have no\r\ndoubt in saying that the monarchical system is better suited to\r\nChina than the republican system. For, if China's independence is\r\nto be maintained, the government should be constitutional, and in\r\nconsideration of China's conditions as well as her relations with\r\nother Powers, it will be easier to form a constitutional\r\ngovernment by adopting a monarchy than a Republic.\r\n\r\nHowever, it must be remembered that in order to secure the best\r\nresults from changing the Republic into a Monarchy not a single\r\none of the following points can be dispensed with:\r\n\r\n1. Such a change must not arouse the opposition of the Chinese\r\npeople or the Foreign Powers, which will cause the disturbances so\r\nenergetically suppressed by the Republican Government to appear\r\nagain in China. For the peace now prevailing in the country should\r\nbe maintained at any price so that no danger may come therefrom.\r\n\r\n2. If the law of succession be not definitely defined in such a\r\nway that it will leave no doubts as to the proper successor, no\r\ngood can come from the change from Republic to Monarchy. I have\r\nsaid enough about the necessity of not allowing the monarch to\r\nchoose his own successor. Although the power of an Emperor is\r\ngreater than that of a President, when the majority of the people\r\nknow nothing, it is more respected by the people. But the reason\r\nfor such a change will not be valid if the change is brought about\r\nmerely to add to the power of the chief executive without the\r\nquestion of succession being definitely settled. For the\r\ndefiniteness about succession is the most prominent point of\r\nsuperiority of the monarchical system over the republican system.\r\n\r\n3. If the Government should fail to make provisions for the\r\ndevelopment of the constitutional government, no permanent benefit\r\nwill result from the change of a republic into a monarchy. For if\r\nChina wishes to occupy a suitable place among the world powers,\r\nthe patriotism of her people must be made to grow so that the\r\ngovernment will be more than strong enough to cope with outside\r\naggression. The patriotism of the people will not grow if they are\r\nnot allowed to participate in political affairs, and without the\r\nhearty assistance of the people no government can become strong.\r\nFor the reason why the people will assist the government is\r\nbecause they feel they are a part of the government. Therefore the\r\ngovernment should make the people realize that the government is\r\nthe organ which aims at bringing blessing to the people, and make\r\nthe people understand that they have the right to superintend the\r\ngovernment before the government can achieve great things.\r\n\r\nEvery one of the points mentioned above are indispensable for the\r\nchange of the Republic into a monarchy. Whether the necessary\r\nconditions are present must be left to those who know China well\r\nand are responsible for her future progress. If these conditions\r\nare all present then I have no doubt that the change of the form\r\nof the government will be for the benefit of China.\r\n\r\nThe first illuminating point, as we have already said, to leap up\r\nand lock attention to the exclusion of everything else in this\r\nmemorandum, is that the chief difficulty which perplexes Dr.\r\nGoodnow is not the consolidation of a new government which had\r\nbeen recognized by all the Treaty Powers only two years previously\r\nbut the question of succession to the supreme office in the land,\r\na point which had already been fully provided for in the one\r\nchapter of the Permanent Constitution which had been legally\r\npassed prior to the Coup d'etat of the 4th November, 1913. But\r\nYuan Shih-kai's first care after that coup d'etat had been to\r\npromulgate with the assistance of Dr. Goodnow and others, a bogus\r\nLaw, resting on no other sanction than his personal volition, with\r\nan elaborate flummery about three candidates whose names were to\r\nbe deposited in the gold box in the Stone House in the gardens of\r\nthe Palace. Therefore since the provisional nature of this\r\nprestidigitation had always been clear, the learned doctor's only\r\nsolution is to recommend the overthrow of the government; the\r\nrestoration of the Empire under the name of Constitutional\r\nMonarchy; and, by means of a fresh plot to do in China what all\r\nEurope has long been on the point of abandoning, namely, to\r\nsubstitute Family rule for National rule.\r\n\r\nNow had these suggestions been gravely made in any country but\r\nChina by a person officially employed it is difficult to know what\r\nwould have happened. Even in China had an Englishman published or\r\ncaused to be published--especially after the repeated statements\r\nYuan Shih-kai had given out that any attempt to force the sceptre\r\non him would cause him to leave the country and end his days\r\nabroad [Footnote: The most widely-quoted statement on this subject\r\nis the remarkable interview, published in the first week of July,\r\n1915, throughout the metropolitan press, between President Yuan\r\nShih-kai and General Feng Kuo-chang, commanding the forces on the\r\nlower Yangtsze. This statement was telegraphed by foreign\r\ncorrespondents all over the world. Referring to the many rumours\r\nafloat that titles of nobility would be revived as a precursor to\r\nthe monarchy the President declared that even if he seized the\r\nThrone that would not increase his powers, whilst as for\r\ntransmitting the Imperial Yellow to his sons none were fitted for\r\nthat honour which would mean the collapse of any new dynasty. Here\r\nGeneral Feng Kuo-chang interrupted with the remark that the people\r\nof South China would not oppose such a change ultimately, though\r\nthey thought it was too early to talk about it just now. Thereupon\r\nthe president's features became stern and he declared in a\r\nheightened voice: \"You and others seem still to believe that I\r\nharbour secret ambitions. I affirm positively that when I sent my\r\nsons to study in England, I privately ordered the purchase of a\r\nsmall estate there as a possible home. If the people of China\r\ninsist upon my accepting the sceptre I shall leave this country\r\nand spend the remaining days of my life abroad.\" This interview,\r\nso far from being denied, has been affirmed to the present writer\r\nas being substantially correct.]--that Englishman, we say, would\r\nhave been liable under the Orders in Council to summary\r\nimprisonment, the possibility of tumult and widespread internal\r\ndisturbances being sufficient to force a British Court to take\r\naction. What are the forces which brought an American to say\r\nthings which an Englishman would not dare to say--that in 1915\r\nthere was a sanction for a fresh revolutionary movement in China?\r\nFirst, an interpretation of history so superficial, combined with\r\nsuch an amazing suppression of contemporary political thought,\r\nthat it is difficult to believe that the requirements of the\r\ncountry were taken in the least bit seriously; secondly, in the\r\ncomparisons made between China and the Latin republics, a\r\ndeliberate scouting of the all-important racial factor; and,\r\nlastly, a total ignorance of the intellectual qualities which are\r\nby far the most outstanding feature of Chinese civilization.\r\n\r\nDr. Goodnow's method is simplicity itself. In order to prove the\r\nsuperiority of Monarchism over Republicanism--and thus\r\ndeliberately ignoring the moral of the present cataclysmic war--he\r\nransacks the dust-laden centuries. The English Commonwealth, which\r\ndisappeared nearly three hundred years ago, is brought forward as\r\nan example of the dangers which beset a republic, though it is\r\ndifficult to see what relation an experiment made before the idea\r\nof representative government had been even understood bears to our\r\ntimes. But there is worse. The statement is deliberately made that\r\nthe reason for the disappearance of that Commonwealth was \"that\r\nthe problem of succession after the death of Cromwell was\r\ndifficult to solve.\" English historians would no doubt have\r\nnumerous remarks to offer on this strange untruth which dismiss a\r\nremarkably interesting chapter of history in the most misleading\r\nway, and which tells Chinese political students nothing about the\r\ncomplete failure which military government--not republicanism--\r\nmust always have among the Anglo-Saxon peoples and which is the\r\nsole reason why Cromwellism disappeared. Even when treating the\r\nhistory of his own country Dr. Goodnow seems to take pleasure in\r\nbeing absurd. For he says: \"The mind of the American people was so\r\nimbued with the idea of republicanism that a republican form of\r\ngovernment was the ideal of the whole race\"; then adding as if to\r\nrefute his own statements, \"Had General Washington--the leader of\r\nthe revolutionary army--had the desire to become a monarch he\r\nwould probably have been successful.\" We do not know how Americans\r\nwill like this kind of interpretation of their history; but at\r\nleast they will not fail to note what dismal results it hastened\r\non in China. With the experimental Eighteenth Century French\r\nRepublic; with the old Spanish Colonies of Central and South\r\nAmerica; and above all with Mexico, Dr. Goodnow deals in the same\r\nvein. Vast movements, which can be handled only tentatively even\r\nin exhaustive essays are dismissed in misleading sentences framed\r\nso as to serve as mere introduction to the inevitable climax--the\r\nChinese Constitutional Monarchy of 1915 with Yuan Shih-kai as\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nYet this is not all. As if in alarm at the very conclusions he so\r\npurposely reaches, at the end of his Memorandum he reduces these\r\nconclusions to naught by stating that three impossible conditions\r\nare necessary to consummate the Restoration of the Monarchy in\r\nChina, (1) no opposition should be aroused, (2) the law of\r\nsuccession must be properly settled, (3) full provision must be\r\nmade for the development of Constitutional Government. That these\r\nconditions were known to be impossible, everyone in the Far East\r\nhad long admitted. Had Dr. Goodnow paid the slightest attention to\r\nthe course of history in China he would have known (a) that any\r\nusurpation of the Throne would infallibly lead to rebellion in\r\nChina and intervention on the part of Japan, (b) that Yuan Shih-\r\nkai's power was purely personal and as such could not be\r\ntransmitted to any son by any means known to the human intellect,\r\n(c) that all Yuan Shih-kai's sons were worthless, the eldest son\r\nbeing semi-paralyzed, (d) that constitutional government and the\r\nEastern conception of kingship, which is purely theocratic, are so\r\nantithetical that they cannot possibly co-exist, any re-\r\nestablishment of the throne being ipso facto the re-establishment\r\nof a theocracy, (e) that although he so constantly speaks of the\r\nlow political knowledge of the people, the Chinese have had a most\r\ncomplete form of local self-government from the earliest times,\r\nthe political problem of the day being simply to gather up and\r\nexpress these local forms in some centralized system: (f) the so-\r\ncalled non-patriotism of the Chinese is non-existent and is an\r\nidea which has been spread abroad owing to the complete foreign\r\nmisunderstanding of certain basic facts--for instance that under\r\nthe Empire foreign affairs were the sole concern of the Emperors,\r\nprovincial China prior to 1911 being a socio-economic\r\nconfederation resembling mediaeval contrivances such as the\r\nHanseatic League--a provincial confederation not concerning\r\nitself with any matter which lay outside its everyday economic\r\nlife, such as territorial overlordship or frontier questions or\r\nthe regulation of sea-port intercourse etc., because such matters\r\nwere meaningless. It was only when foreign encroachment in the\r\nPOST-Japanese war period (i. e. after 1895) carried problems from\r\nthe fringes of the Empire into the economic life of the people\r\nthat their pride was touched and that in spite of \"their lack of\r\nexperience and knowledge in political affairs\" they suddenly\r\ndisplayed a remarkable patriotic feeling, the history of China\r\nduring the past two decades being only comprehensible when this\r\ncapital contention, namely the reality of Chinese patriotism, is\r\ngiven the central place.\r\n\r\nIt is useless, however, to pursue the subject: we have said enough\r\nto disclose the utter levity of those who should have realized\r\nfrom the first that the New China is a matter of life and death to\r\nthe people, and that the first business of the foreigner is to\r\nuphold the new beliefs. The Goodnow Memorandum, immediately it was\r\npublished, was put to precisely those base uses which any one with\r\nan elementary knowledge of China might have foreseen: it was\r\nsimply exploited in an unscrupulous way, its recommendations being\r\ncarried out in such a manner as to increase one's contempt for the\r\nmen who were pushing the monarchist plot with any means that they\r\ncould seize hold of, and who were not averse from making\r\nresponsible foreigners their tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE MONARCHY MOVEMENT IS OPPOSED\r\n\r\nTHE APPEAL OF THE SCHOLAR LIANG CH'I-CHAO\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already referred in several places to the extraordinary\r\nrole scholarship and the literary appeal play in the governance of\r\nChina. It is necessary to go back to the times of the birth of the\r\nRoman Empire, and to invoke the great figure of Cicero, to\r\nunderstand how greatly the voice of men of recognized intellectual\r\nqualities influences the nation. Liang Ch'i-chao, a man of some\r\nforty-five years, had long been distinguished for his literary\r\nattainments and for the skill with which, though unversed in any\r\nWestern language, he had expounded the European theory and\r\npractice of government to his fellow-countrymen. To his brain is\r\ndue the coining of many exact expressions necessary for\r\nparliamentary government, his mentality having grown with the\r\nmodern growth of China and adapted itself rather marvellously to\r\nthe requirements of the Twentieth Century. A reformer of 1898--\r\nthat is one of the small devoted band of men who under Kang Yu Wei\r\nalmost succeeded in winning over the ill-fated Emperor Kwang Hsu\r\nto carrying out a policy of modernizing the country in the teeth\r\nof fierce mandarin opposition, he possessed in his armoury every\r\npossible argument against the usurpation Yuan Shih-kai proposed to\r\npractise. He knew precisely where to strike--and with what\r\nstrength; and he delivered himself over to his task with whole-\r\nhearted fervour. It having become known that he was engaged in\r\npreparing this brief for the people of China, every influence was\r\nbrought to bear to prevent such a disastrous publication.\r\nInfluential deputations were sent to him to implore him to\r\nremember the parlous international situation China found herself\r\nin,--a situation which would result in open disaster if subjected\r\nto the strain of further discords. For a time he hesitated\r\nlaunching his counter-stroke. But at length the Republican Party\r\npersuaded him to deal the tyrant the needed blow; and his now\r\nfamous accusation of the Chief Executive was published.\r\n\r\nIts effect was immediate and very far-reaching. Men understood\r\nthat armed revolt was in the air. The almost Biblical fervour\r\nwhich pervades this extraordinary document shows an unusual sense\r\nof moral outrage. The masterly analysis of the Diaz regime in\r\nMexico coupled with the manner in which--always pretending to be\r\nexamining the conduct of the Mexican--he stabs at Yuan Shih-kai,\r\nwon the applause of a race that delights in oblique attacks and\r\nwas ample proof that great trouble was brewing. The document was\r\nread in every part of China and everywhere approved. Although it\r\nsuffers from translation, the text remains singularly interesting\r\nas a disclosure of the Chinese mentality; whilst the exhaustive\r\nexamination of political terms it contains shows that some day\r\nChinese will carry their inventive genius into fields they have\r\nhitherto never openly invaded. Especially interesting is it to\r\ncontrast the arguments of such a man with those of a decadent such\r\nas Yang Tu.\r\n\r\nFROM REPUBLIC TO MONARCHY\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed with my argument I wish to make plain two points.\r\nOne is that I am not one of those reformers whose ears are their\r\nbrains, and who are intoxicated with the doctrine of\r\nrepublicanism. I have, therefore, no partiality for the republican\r\nform of government nor any bias for or against other forms of\r\ngovernment. This can be proved by my literary work during the last\r\nten years. The second point is that I am not one of the veteran\r\nconservatives who lay so much stress on the importance of having a\r\ndynasty. For such are the thoughts of men who only seek to adjust\r\nthemselves to existing conditions. If one wishes to consider the\r\npresent situation of the country without bias or prejudice he must\r\ndisregard the rise or fall of any particular family. Only those\r\nwho bear in mind these two points can read my argument with real\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nI. THE QUESTION OF KUO-TI\r\n\r\nSome time ago I said that, as political students, we should only\r\ncare for Cheng-ti, i.e., the form of government and not for kuo-\r\nti, i.e., the form of state. Do not call this trifling with words,\r\nfor it is a principle which all critics of politics should follow\r\nand never depart from. The reason is that critics of politics\r\nshould not, because they cannot, influence the question of kuo-ti.\r\nThey should not influence the question of kuo-ti because so long\r\nas the question of kuo-ti remains unsettled the major portion of\r\nthe administration remains at a stand-still. Thus there will be no\r\npolitical situation properly so called and there will be no\r\npolitical questions to discuss (here the term political means\r\nreally administrative). If a critic of politics, therefore,\r\ninterfere with the question of Kuo-ti, he will be leading the\r\nnation into a condition of political instability, thus undermining\r\nthe ground on which the people stand. Such critics can be likened\r\nunto a man trying to enter a house without ascending the steps or\r\ncrossing a river without a boat.\r\n\r\nThey cannot influence the question of Kuo-ti. The force which\r\ndrives and steers the change of one form of State or vice versa is\r\ngenerally not derived from mere politics. If the time is not ripe,\r\nthen no amount of advocacy on the part of critics can hasten it.\r\nIf the time is ripe, nothing the critics say can prevent it. He\r\nwho indulges himself in the discussion of the problem of Kuo-ti--\r\ni.e., the form of States, as a political student, is ignorant of\r\nhis own limitations and capacity. This is as true of the active\r\npoliticians as of the critics; for the first duty of an active\r\npolitician is to seek for the improvement and progress of the\r\nadministration of the existing foundation of government. A step\r\nbeyond this line is revolution and intrigue, and such cannot be\r\nthe attitude of a right-minded active politician or statesman.\r\nThis is looking at it from the negative side.\r\n\r\nFrom the positive, that is, the progressive point of view, there\r\nis also a boundary. Such actions under one form of government are\r\npolitical activities, and under the opposite form of government\r\nare also political activities. But these are not questions of\r\npolitical principle. For only when a man sacrifices the ideals\r\nwhich he has advocated and cherished during the whole of his life\r\ndoes the question of principle arise. Therefore the great\r\nprinciple of looking to the actual state of administration of the\r\nform of government and leaving the mere form of state in the back-\r\nground is a principle that is applicable under all circumstances\r\nand should be followed by all critics of politics.\r\n\r\nII. THE ARGUMENT AGAINST CHANGE\r\n\r\nNo form of government is ideal. Its reason of existence can only\r\nbe judged by what it has achieved. It is the height of folly to\r\nrely on theoretical conclusions as a basis for artificial\r\narbitration as to what should be accepted and what discarded. Mere\r\nfolly, however, is not to be seriously condemned. But the danger\r\nand harm to the country will be unmeasurable if a person has\r\nprejudiced views respecting a certain form of government and in\r\norder to prove the correctness of his prejudiced views, creates\r\nartificially a situation all by himself. For this reason my view\r\nhas always been not to oppose any form of government. But I am\r\nalways opposed to any one who engages in a propaganda in favour of\r\na form of government other than the one under which we actually\r\nlive. In the past I opposed those who tried to spread the\r\nrepublican form of government while the country was under\r\nmonarchical government, and the arguments I advanced in support of\r\nmy views were written in no fewer than 200,000 words. Even so late\r\nas the ninth month after the outbreak of the Revolution I issued a\r\npamphlet entitled \"The Problem of the Building of the New China,\"\r\nwhich was my last attempt to express my views respecting the\r\nmaintenance of the old form of government.\r\n\r\nWhat obligations had I to the then Imperial House? Did it not heap\r\npersecution and humiliation on me to the utmost of its power and\r\nresources? I would have been an exile even to this day had it not\r\nbeen for the Revolution. Further, I was no child and I was fully\r\naware of the disappointment which the then Government caused in\r\nthe minds of the people. Yet I risked the opposition of the whole\r\ncountry and attempted to prolong the life of the dying dynasty. I\r\nhad no other view in mind except that there would be some\r\npossibility of our hope being realized if the whole nation would\r\nunite in efforts to improve the administration under the then\r\nexisting form of government. I believed that because the people\r\nwere not educated for a change. But if the status of the country\r\nshould be changed before the people are educated and accustomed to\r\nthe new order of things, the danger and hardship during the\r\ntransitional period of several years would be incalculable. In\r\ncertain circumstances this might lead to the destruction of the\r\nnation. Even if we are spared the tragedy of national extinction,\r\nthe losses sustained by the retarding of the progress of the\r\nadministration would be unredeemable. It is painful to recall past\r\nexperiences; but if my readers will read once more my articles in\r\nthe Hsin Mim Tung Pao during the years 1905 and 1906 they will see\r\nthat all the sufferings which the Republic has experienced bear\r\nout the predictions made then. The different stages of the\r\nsinister development have been unfolding themselves one by one\r\njust as I said they would. It was unfortunate that my words were\r\nnot heeded although I wept and pleaded. Such has been the\r\nconsequence of the change of the state of the country--a change of\r\nKuo-ti.\r\n\r\nYet before we have hardly ceased panting, this talk of a second\r\nchange is on us. I am not in a position to say exactly how this\r\ntalk had its beginning. Ostensibly it was started by the remarks\r\nof Dr. Goodnow. But I am unable to say whether Dr. Goodnow\r\nactually gave out such a view or for what purpose he expressed\r\nsuch a view. From what he told the representative of a Peking\r\nnewspaper he never expressed the views attributed to him. Be this\r\nas it may, I cannot help having my doubts. All Dr. Goodnow is\r\nalleged to have said bearing on the merits of the monarchical and\r\nrepublican system of government as an abstract subject of\r\ndiscussion, such as the necessity of the form of state (Kuo-ti)\r\nbeing suited to the general conditions of the country and the\r\nlessons we should learn from the Central and South American\r\nrepublics, are really points of a very simple nature and easily\r\ndeduced. How strange that among all this large number of\r\npoliticians and scholars, who are as numerous as the trees in the\r\nforest and the perch in the stream, should have failed for all\r\nthese years to notice these simple points; and now suddenly make a\r\nfetish of them because they have come out of the mouth of a\r\nforeigner. Is it because no one except a foreign doctor can\r\ndiscover such facts? Why even a humble learner like myself, though\r\nnot so learned even to the extent of one ten-thousandth part of\r\nhis knowledge, more than ten years ago anticipated what the good\r\ndoctor has said; and I said much more and in much more\r\ncomprehensive terms. I have no desire to talk about my work, but\r\nlet my readers glance through the copies of the Hsin Min Tsung\r\nPao, Yin Ping Shih Wen Chi, the \"Fight between Constitutional\r\nAdvocates\" and \"Revolutionary Advocates,\" the \"Question of the\r\nBuilding of the New China,\" etc., etc. My regret is that my eyes\r\nare not blue and my hair not brown, and hence my words were not\r\nacceptable to the nation!\r\n\r\nIII. RES JUDICATA\r\n\r\nI do not say that the merits or otherwise of the republican system\r\nshould not be discussed, but the time for such a discussion has\r\npassed. The most opportune time for such a discussion was in 1911\r\nwhen the Revolution had just begun; but since then further\r\ndiscussions should not be tolerated. There might have been some\r\nexcuse if this subject had been brought up for discussion when the\r\nsecond revolution broke out at Hukow on the Yangtsze river or\r\nbefore the President was formally inaugurated, or before the\r\nPowers formally recognized the Republic; but the excuse even then\r\nwould have been a weak one. Where were you then, advocates of\r\nmonarchy? Could you not at that time have brought out an essay by\r\none of the great scholars of the world as a subject for\r\ndiscussion? Could you not have cited the cases of American\r\nrepublics as a warning for us that these republic were by no means\r\npeaceful? Yet at that time when the heroes of discretion were\r\ndaily pushing the progress of the republican cause, stating that\r\nrepublicanism was the panacea for all the world's administrations\r\nand that republicanism was not a new factor in Chinese history, a\r\nhumble and ignorant man like myself, then a stranger in a foreign\r\nland, was burdened with the fear of the unsuitability of the\r\nrepublican system to China and wrote articles in support of his\r\nown views and wept till his eyes were dry.\r\n\r\nDo you not realize that the State is a thing of great importance\r\nand should not be disturbed carelessly? How can you then\r\nexperiment with it and treat it as if you were putting a chest\r\ninto a dead hole, saying \"Let me place it here for the moment and\r\nI will see to it later.\" The status of the State can be likened to\r\nmarriage between man and woman. The greatest care should be taken\r\nduring courtship. The lady should then exercise care to see that\r\nthe man whom she is taking to be a life companion is worthy of\r\nher. During this period it is the duty of her relatives and\r\nfriends to point out to her any danger or misunderstanding even to\r\nthe extent of offending her feelings. But if you leave her alone\r\nat this stage when there is plenty of time to change her course,\r\nand--what is more--urge her to tie the knot despite\r\nincompatibility, what right have you afterward to make the\r\nimpudent suggestion to the wife that her husband is not a man to\r\nwhom she should cling for life? Is such a course a charitable way\r\nof doing things?\r\n\r\nIf indeed the republican cause is enough to cause the destruction\r\nof the nation then you, the advocates of monarchy, have placed the\r\ncountry in a position from which she has no hope of ever coming\r\nout independent. You are the men, who--to the best of your\r\nability--inculcated and pressed the adoption of the republican\r\ncause. The proverb says, \"If now, why not then?\" How many days can\r\na person live that you, not satisfied with one great sin, are\r\nagain to commit another. It is not long since the Republic was\r\nfirst established; yet you, the veterans of republicanism, are the\r\nleaders today in advocating the overthrow of the Republic. Yes. It\r\nis indeed strange that I, a man who once opposed the republican\r\ncause, should now be opposing you. Nothing is stranger and nothing\r\nis so fateful.\r\n\r\nBut our modern critics say we prefer a constitutional monarchy to\r\nan autocratic republic. Now whether we are constitutional or not\r\nis a question concerning the administration, while the question\r\nwhether we are republican or not is a question concerning the form\r\nor status of the country. We have always held that the question of\r\nKuo-ti is above discussion and that what we should consider is the\r\nactual condition of administration. If the administration\r\n(government) is constitutional, then it matters not whether the\r\ncountry is a Republic or a Monarchy. If the government is not\r\nconstitutional then neither a republic nor a monarchy will avail.\r\nThere is no connexion, therefore, between the question of Kuo-ti\r\nand the question of Cheng-ti. It is an absurd idea to say that in\r\norder to improve the administration we must change the Kuo-ti--the\r\nstatus or form of the country--as a necessity. If this idea is to\r\nbe entertained for a single moment the changes even in\r\nconstitutional countries will be endless. But the curious paradox\r\nis that in former days the critics said that only a republic, not\r\na monarchy, could be constitutional; whereas, the critics now say\r\nthat a monarchy, not a republic, can alone be constitutional!\r\n\r\nIV. THE PRESIDENT AND THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\nLet me therefore lay down a simple definition of what a\r\nConstitution is before discussing whether the contentions of the\r\ncritics are reasonable. My opponents will agree with me that the\r\nmain principle of a constitutional government is that the\r\nlegislative organ should always balance the executive and that the\r\nexercising of the administrative power is always limited to a\r\ncertain extent. They will also agree that the most important point\r\nof a so-called constitutional monarchy is that the monarch should\r\nact as a figurehead, and that the establishment of a responsible\r\ncabinet is an indispensable accompaniment. If these simple\r\nprinciples are recognized then we must put up the theory for\r\ndiscussion. Let us then raise the question who shall be the\r\nmonarch. In plain words, is the person in our mind the President?\r\nor any other person? (In view of the repeated declarations of the\r\nPresident that he will never consent to become an Emperor, this\r\nsuggestion on my part is a gross insult to his character, but I\r\ncrave to excuse myself as this is only mere speculation and\r\nsupposition.) What shall we do with the President if we find\r\nanother man? The President, having so long borne the burdens of\r\nthe State, will certainly be only too willing to vacate his post\r\nto live in retirement as far as his own person is concerned, but\r\ncan we imagine that the country will allow the President to\r\nretire? If not, then are we going to ask the President to form a\r\nresponsible cabinet under a figurehead monarch? Even if we take it\r\nfor granted that the President, out of love for the country, would\r\nbe willing to sacrifice his own principles and yield to the wish\r\nof the country, it will be dangerous indeed if he--a person on\r\nwhom the whole nation depends--is placed in the path of\r\nparliament. Therefore the contention that a constitutional\r\nmonarchy will be attained if a person other than the President be\r\nmade a monarch is false and baseless.\r\n\r\nShall we then make the present President a monarch? Of course the\r\nPresident will not consent to this. But leaving this aside let us\r\nsuppose that the President, in consideration of the permanent\r\nwelfare of the country, is willing to sacrifice everything to\r\nsatisfy the wish of the people, do we expect that he will become a\r\nmere figurehead? A figurehead monarch is, to adapt the saying of\r\nthe west a fat porker, a guinea-pig, that is, good as an expensive\r\nornament. Will it be wise to place so valuable a personage in so\r\nidle a position at a time when the situation is so extremely\r\ncritical?\r\n\r\nEven if we are willing to suffer the President to become a\r\nfigurehead it will remain a question whether a responsible cabinet\r\ncan ever be formed. I do not say that the President will not allow\r\na responsible cabinet to exist under him. My contention is that\r\nthere is no one within my knowledge, who commands respect enough\r\nand is capable of taking over the responsibilities of President\r\nYuan. For who can replace the Great President in coping with our\r\nnumerous difficulties? If we select an ordinary man and make him\r\nbear the great burdens, we will find that in addition to his lack\r\nof ability rendering him unequal to the occasion, his lack of\r\ndominating influence will disqualify him from exercising\r\nauthority. It was for the purpose of meeting the requirements of\r\nthe existing conditions that the Cabinet system was changed into a\r\nPresidential system--an excellent substitution for a weakened\r\nadministration. Conditions in the next two or three years will not\r\nbe very much different from what they are now. Therefore, the\r\ncontention that the administration will be changed overnight for\r\nthe better after a change in the form of the State is, if not a\r\nwicked untruth to deceive the common people, the ridiculous\r\nabsurdity of a bookworm. Thus the theory that a constitutional\r\nmonarchy will immediately follow, if the President consents to\r\nbecome a monarch, is also fallacious.\r\n\r\nCan it be possible that those who are now holding up the\r\nconstitutional principle as a shield for their monarchical views\r\nhave a different definition for the term \"constitution\"? The Ching\r\n(Manchu) Dynasty considered itself as possessing a constitution in\r\nits last days. Did we recognize it as such? Let me also ask the\r\ncritics what guarantee they have to offer that the constitution\r\nwill be put into effect without hindrance as soon as the form of\r\nState is changed. If they cannot give any definite guarantee, then\r\nwhat they advocate is merely an absolute monarchy and not a\r\nconstitutional monarchy. As it is not likely to be a\r\nconstitutional monarchy, we may safely assume that it will be an\r\nimperial autocracy. I cannot regard it as a wise plan if, owing to\r\ndislike of its defects, the Republic should be transformed into an\r\nImperial autocracy. Owing to various unavoidable reasons, it is\r\nexcusable in spite of violent opposition to adopt temporarily\r\nautocratic methods in a republican country. But if the plan\r\nproposed by present-day critics be put into effect, that on the\r\npromise of a constitution we should agree to the adoption of a\r\nmonarchy, then the promise must be definitely made to the country\r\nat the time of transition that a constitutional government will\r\nbecome an actuality. But if, after the promise is made, existing\r\nconditions are alleged to justify the continuance of autocratic\r\nmethods, I am afraid the whole country will not be so tolerant\r\ntowards the Chief Executive. To assume outwardly the role of\r\nconstitutional government, but in reality to rule in an\r\nunconstitutional manner, was the cause of the downfall of the\r\nChing Dynasty. The object lesson is not obscure. Let us take\r\nwarning by it.\r\n\r\nV. FALLACIES OF THE MONARCHISTS\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the present day critics are really in\r\nearnest for a constitution, then I am unable to understand why\r\nthey believe that this cannot be secured under the Republic but\r\nmust be obtained in a roundabout way by means of a monarchy. In my\r\nview the real hindrances to the adoption of a constitution at the\r\npresent day in China are the existing conditions, viz. the\r\nattitude of the officials and the traditions and intellectual\r\nstandards of the people. But these hindrances have not resulted\r\nfrom the adoption of republicanism. Therefore they cannot be\r\nexpected to disappear with the disappearance of the Republic. For\r\ninstance, from the President downward to the minor official of\r\nevery official organ in the capital or in the provinces, every one\r\ninclines to be independent of the law, and considers it convenient\r\nto deal with affairs as he pleases. This is the greatest obstacle\r\nto constitutional government. Now has that anything to do with the\r\nchange or not of the form of State? Again, the absence, on the\r\npart of the people, of interest in political affairs, of knowledge\r\nof politics, of political morality and strength, and their\r\ninability to organize proper political parties to make use of an\r\ninviolable parliament, are also hindrances to the attainment of a\r\nconstitution. Now what have these things to do with a change in\r\nthe form of the States? If I were to go on naming such hindrances\r\none by one, I should count my fingers many times over and I should\r\nnot be through. Yet it is quite plain that not a single one of\r\nthese hindrances can be attributed to republicanism.\r\n\r\nTo say that what we cannot get under the republic can be secured\r\nimmediately upon accepting a monarchical regime, or to say that\r\nwhat can be secured under a monarchical regime can never be\r\nsecured in a republican period is beyond the understanding of a\r\nstupid man like myself, although I have searched my brain for a\r\nvalid reason.\r\n\r\nMy view is that if China is really in earnest for a constitution,\r\nthe President should set the example himself by treating the\r\nConstitutional Compact as sacredly inviolable and compel his\r\nsubordinates to do the same. Every letter of the compact should be\r\ncarried out and no attempt should be made to step beyond its\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nMeantime give the people as many opportunities as possible to\r\nacquaint themselves with political affairs, and do not stifle the\r\naspirations of the people or weaken their strength or damp their\r\ninterest or crush their self-respect. Then within a few years we\r\nshall be rewarded with results. If, instead of doing all these\r\nthings, we vainly blame the form of State, we are, as Chu Tse\r\nsays, like a boat that blames the creek for its curves.\r\n\r\nThe most powerful argument of those who advocate a change to a\r\nmonarchy is that there is every possibility of disturbance at the\r\ntime of a Presidential election. This is a real danger. It is for\r\nthis reason that ten years ago I did not dare to associate myself\r\nwith the advocates of republicanism. If the critics want to attack\r\nme on this point to support of their contentions, I advise them\r\nnot to write another article but to reprint my articles written\r\nsome time ago, which, I think, will be more effective.\r\nFortunately, however, we have discovered a comparatively effective\r\nremedy. For, according to the latest President Election Law the\r\nterm of the President is to all intents and purposes a term for\r\nlife. It is therefore impossible for such dangers to appear during\r\nthe life of the President. What concerns us is therefore what will\r\nhappen after the departure of the present President for another\r\nworld. This, of course, is a question that we do not wish to touch\r\nupon; but since every one, even the patriarchs must die some day,\r\nlet us face the matter openly. If Heaven blesses China and allows\r\nthe Great President to devote himself to the country for ten or\r\nmore years--during which he will be able to assert the authority\r\nof the government, cleanse officialdom, store-up strength,\r\nconsolidate the country, and banish all hidden dangers--then there\r\nwill be nothing to choose between a republic or a monarchy. If, on\r\nthe other hand, Heaven should not be pleased so to favour us and\r\ntakes away our Great President before he is half through with his\r\ngreat task, then the fate of China is sealed. No changes in the\r\nform of State will avail under any circumstances. Therefore the\r\nquestion whether China will be left in peace or not depends\r\nentirely on the length of years the Great President will live and\r\nwhat he will be able to accomplish in his lifetime. Whether the\r\ncountry is ruled as a republic or a monarchy, the consequences\r\nwill be the same.\r\n\r\nDo you still doubt my words? Let me go deeper into the analysis.\r\nThe difference between a republic and a monarchy lies only in the\r\nmethods of succession of the head of the nation. It is evident\r\nthat although a certain law of succession may be made during the\r\nlife-time of the Head, it cannot take effect until his death; and\r\nwhether or not the effect thus intended will come up to\r\nexpectations will depend on two factors: (1) whether or not the\r\nmerits and personal influence of the predecessor will continue\r\neffective after his death, and (2) whether or not there will be\r\nunscrupulous and insubordinate claimants at the death of the Head,\r\nand, if any, the number of such men and whether the point of\r\ndispute they raise be well-founded. If these are taken as the\r\nbasis for discerning the future we will arrive at the same\r\nconclusion whether the country be a republic or a monarchy.\r\n\r\nVI. THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION LAW\r\n\r\nThe Presidential Election Law, however, provides that the\r\nsuccessor should be nominated by his predecessor, and the name of\r\nthe successor so nominated is to be locked in the golden box in\r\nthe stone strong-room. The President may now, on the one hand,\r\nmultiply his merits and strengthen his personal influence so that\r\nthe whole country will gladly bow to his wishes to the extent that\r\neven after his death they will not want to disobey his last wish,\r\nand on the other hand, the President may quietly ascertain the\r\nlikely causes which would produce dissension, and take suitable\r\nsteps to prevent and be rid of them. If the seed of dissension is\r\nin the ordinances, then alter the ordinances so that they may not\r\nbe used as a tool by possible claimants. If the seed of dissension\r\nis in a person then cultivate that man, lead him to righteousness,\r\nplace him in a suitable position so that he may be protected from\r\ntemptation. Meanwhile let the President carefully select his\r\nsuccessor on whom he may eventually lay the responsibilities of\r\nState (according to the Presidential Election Law the President is\r\nat liberty to suggest any one he likes, his own son or some one\r\nelse). Let the nominee be placed in a responsible position so as\r\nto bring him to public notice. Give him real authority so that he\r\nmay establish his influence. Place his name at the head of other\r\nmen of little consequence in the golden box. Then there will be\r\nabsolutely no ground for dispute when the time comes to open the\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nIf every President will do likewise this system can be used\r\nwithout fear of a break for hundreds of years. Otherwise we will\r\nhave only the Imperial system on paper to rely on for assistance,\r\nwhich is not even to be thought of. A glance through the pages of\r\nChinese history will show the numerous cases in the reign of\r\nEmperors when princes fought in the very confines of the Emperor's\r\npalace while the corpse of their royal father lay unburied in the\r\nhall. Thus it is seen that the hidden cause of the safety or\r\notherwise of the country does not lie with the mere formality of a\r\nconstitution either in a republic or a monarchy.\r\n\r\nVII. THE CASE OF DIAZ, THE DICTATOR\r\n\r\nThe critics bring up the example of Mexico where live rivals have\r\nbeen struggling with each other for the presidency, and the\r\ninternal confusion of the Central and South American republics as\r\nwell as Portugal, as an unquestionable proof of their contention\r\nthat a republic is not so good as a monarchy. I imagine that the\r\nidea of these critics is that all these disturbances can be\r\navoided if all these republics were changed into monarchies. Let\r\nme tell them that Diaz ruled over Mexico for thirty years, and\r\nonly died as an exile in May last (I am not quite sure of the\r\nexact month). If indeed the struggle in Mexico was a fight for\r\nsuccession then the fight should not have begun until this year.\r\nAnd indeed if it were necessary to have a monarch to avoid the\r\ndisturbance, and supposing that Diaz, thirty years ago, had a man\r\nlike Dr. Goodnow to make the suggestion, and men like the Chou An\r\nHui to spread it, and suppose that Diaz boldly took the advice and\r\nset up an Imperial system for himself, would Mexico then have a\r\npeace that would last as long as the ages?\r\n\r\nIf Diaz had assumed the throne I am positive he would long ago\r\nhave been an exile in a foreign country before his imperial system\r\ncould have come into effect or he himself become the proud founder\r\nof a new dynasty. What he would have held as an imperial charter\r\nwould have become a mere scrap of paper. If he could not prevent\r\nrebellion even during his life-time how can we expect an empty\r\nImperial system to prevent it after his death. Even a child can\r\nsee this. The disturbances in Mexico were unavoidable no matter\r\nunder a republic or a monarchy. The reason? It is because Diaz,\r\nunder the mask of a republic, actually played the role of a\r\ndespot. During all the thirty years he held office he never\r\ndevoted himself to the strengthening of the fundamental things of\r\nState, but diligently strengthened his own position. He massed an\r\nenormous number of troops for his own protection so that he might\r\noverawe the people. For fear that the troops might become arrogant\r\nand insubordinate, he provoked disagreement among them in order\r\nthat he might play them round his fingers. He banished all those\r\nwho opposed him, relying on force alone. In dealing with those who\r\nwere really patriotic, he either corrupted their character by\r\nbuying them with silver or removed them by assassination. He was a\r\nvainglorious man and spent money like water. From the foreign\r\ncapitalists he borrowed in a most indiscriminate manner, while on\r\nthe Mexican people he levied all sorts of cruel taxes. Thus the\r\nstrength of the people was drained and the resources of the\r\ncountry were exhausted, creating a position over which he\r\neventually had no control whatever. Ten years ago I wrote an\r\narticle in the Hsin Mim Tsung Pao remarking that Diaz was a\r\nmatchless fraud. I said then that a nation-wide calamity would\r\nbefall Mexico after his death and that the Mexican nation would be\r\nreduced to a mere shadow. (My friend Mr. Tang Chio-tun also wrote\r\nan article, before the internal strife in Mexico broke out, on the\r\nsame subject and in an even more comprehensive way). Luckily for\r\nDiaz he ruled under the mask of republicanism, for only by so\r\ndoing did he manage to usurp and keep the presidential chair for\r\nthirty years. He would long ago have disappeared had he attempted\r\nto assume the role of an emperor. This is also true of the other\r\nrepublics of Central and South America. Their presidents almost\r\nwithout a single exception used military force as a stepping-stone\r\nto the presidential chair. We have yet to see the last military\r\naspirant. The unsuitability of the country to the republican\r\nsystem is of course one of the reasons but I cannot agree with\r\nthose who say that this is the only reason.\r\n\r\nAs to Portugal it is true that the change from the monarchy to\r\nrepublic has not stopped internal disturbance; but is it not a\r\nfact that Portugal became a republic as a result of internal\r\ndisturbance and was it not during the existence of the monarch\r\nthat the disturbance started? It is ridiculous to suppose that a\r\nrepublic will surely court disturbance while a monarchy will\r\nsurely ensure peace and order. Is not Persia a monarchy? Is not\r\nTurkey a monarchy? Is not Russia a monarchy?\r\n\r\nRead their history in recent decades and see how many years of\r\npeace they have had. There have been no election of presidents in\r\nthese countries. Why then such unrest?\r\n\r\nAgain, why was the state of affairs during the Sixteen States of\r\nthe Five Dynasty-Period and the Ten States of the Five Successions\r\nas deplorably miserable and disastrous as the state of affairs now\r\nprevailing in Mexico, although there was no election of Presidents\r\nthen? In quoting objective facts as illustrations the critic\r\nshould not allow his choice to be dictated by his personal like or\r\ndislike. Otherwise he will not be deceiving others than himself.\r\nSoberly speaking, any form of state is capable of either ensuring\r\na successful government or causing rebellion. And nine cases out\r\nof ten the cause of rebellion lies in the conditions of the\r\nadministration and not in the form of state. It cannot be denied,\r\nhowever, that the chances of rebellion and dissension are more\r\nfrequent and easier when the form of state does not suit the\r\nconditions of the people. That is why I did not advocate\r\nrepublicanism; and even now I am not a blind believer in\r\nrepublicanism. In this I agree with you, the Chou An Hui people.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I have not decided to advocate boldly a change in\r\nthe form of state is because for years my heart has been burdened\r\nwith an unspeakable sorrow and pain, believing that ever since the\r\nmistake made in 1911 the hope for China's future has dwindled to\r\nalmost nothing. On one hand I have been troubled with our\r\ninability to make the Republic a success, and on the other I have\r\nbeen worrying over the fact that it would be impossible to restore\r\nthe monarchy. The situation has so worked on my troubled mind that\r\nat times I seemed to be beside myself. But as the whole country\r\nseemed to be already in a state of desperation I have come to the\r\nconclusion that it would not do any good to add pain to sorrow.\r\nTherefore, instead of uttering pessimistic views I have been\r\nspeaking words of encouragement to raise our spirits. In this,\r\nhowever, I have exhausted my own strength. My friend, Mr. Hsu Fo-\r\nsu, told me some five or six years ago that it was impossible for\r\nChina to escape a revolution, and as a result of the revolution\r\ncould not escape from becoming a republic, and by becoming a\r\nrepublic China would be bound to disappear as a nation. I have\r\nbeen meditating on these words of ill omen and sought to help the\r\ncountry to escape from his prediction but I have not yet found the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIX. \"DIVINITY DOTH HEDGE A KING\"\r\n\r\nNow my friends, you have stated in a worthy manner the reasons why\r\nthe republican form of state cannot assist China to maintain her\r\nexistence; now let me state why it is impossible to restore the\r\nmonarchical system. The maintenance of the dignity of a monarch\r\ndepends on a sort of mystical, historical, traditional influence\r\nor belief. Such an influence was capable of producing\r\nunconsciously and spontaneously a kind of effect to assist\r\ndirectly or indirectly in maintaining order and imparting blessing\r\nto the country. In this lies the value of a monarchy. But dignity\r\nis a thing not to be trifled with. Once it is trodden down it can\r\nnever rise again. We carve wood or mould clay into the image of a\r\nperson and call it a god (idol). Place it in a beautiful temple,\r\nand seat it in a glorious shrine and the people will worship it\r\nand find it miraculously potent. But suppose some insane person\r\nshould pull it down, tread it under foot and throw it into a dirty\r\npond and suppose some one should discover it and carry it back to\r\nits original sacred abode, you will find the charm has gone from\r\nit. Ever since the days of monarchical government the people have\r\nlooked on the monarch with a sort of divine reverence, and never\r\ndared to question or criticize his position. After a period of\r\nrepublicanism, however, this attitude on the part of the common\r\npeople has been abruptly terminated with no possibility of\r\nresurrection. A survey of all the republics of the world will tell\r\nus that although a large number of them suffered under republican\r\nrule, not a single one succeeded in shaking itself free of the\r\nrepublican fetters. Among the world republics only France has had\r\nher monarchical system revived twice after the republic was first\r\ninaugurated. The monarchy, however, disappeared almost\r\nimmediately. Thus we may well understand how difficult it is for a\r\ncountry to return to its monarchical state after a republican\r\nregime. It may be said that China has had only a short experience\r\nof the republican regime; but it must also be remembered that the\r\nsituation has been developing for more than ten years and in\r\nactual existence for about four years. During the period of\r\ndevelopment the revolutionists denounced the monarch in most\r\nextravagant terms and compared him to the devil. Their aim was to\r\nkill the mystic belief of the people in the Emperor; for only by\r\ndiminishing the dignity of the monarch could the revolutionary\r\ncause make headway. And during and after the change all the\r\nofficial documents, school textbooks, press views and social\r\ngossip have always coupled the word monarch with reprobation. Thus\r\nfor a long while this glorious image has been lying in the dirty\r\npond! Leaving out the question that it is difficult to restore the\r\nmonarchy at the present day, let us suppose that by arbitrary\r\nmethod we do succeed in restoring it. You will then find that it\r\nwill be impossible for it to regain in former dignity and\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nTurning to another aspect, the most natural course would seem to\r\nbe a revival of the last dynasty. It might have been possible for\r\na Charles II and Louis XVIII of China to appear again, if not for\r\nthe hatred of racial domination. But since the last dynasty was\r\nManchu this is out of the question. If a new dynasty were set up\r\nit would require many years of hard labour and a great deal of\r\norganizing to succeed. Even then only a few have succeeded in this\r\nway in prolonging their dynasties by actually convincing the\r\npeople of their merits. Therefore for several years I have been\r\nsaying to myself that it would be easier to strengthen the country\r\nand place it on a sounder basis if it were possible for us to\r\nreturn to our monarchical state. And to revive the monarchical\r\ngovernment there are two ways.\r\n\r\nOne is that after thoroughly reforming the internal administration\r\nunder the leadership of the present Great President, that is, when\r\nall the neglected affairs of the country have been well attended\r\nto, every family in the land made happy and prosperous, the army\r\nwell-trained and all the necessary bitterness \"eaten,\" the\r\nPresident, when a suitable opportunity presented itself, should\r\nhave the rare fortune to gain a decisive victory over a foreign\r\nfoe; then his achievements would be such that the millions of\r\npeople would compel him to ascend the throne, and so he would hand\r\nhis sceptre on to his descendants for endless ages.\r\n\r\nThe second possibility is that after a second great internal\r\ndisturbance, resulting in the whole country being thrown into a\r\nstate of utter confusion and cut up into small independent states,\r\nthe President should suppress them and unite the country into one\r\nempire. We will, of course, not pray for the second possibility to\r\ncome about as then there will be little left of the Chinese\r\npeople. And no one can be certain whether the person who shall\r\nsucceed in suppressing the internal strife will be a man of our\r\nown race or not. Thus the result will not differ very much from\r\nnational extinction. As to the first possibility, we know that an\r\nexceedingly capable man is now in a most powerful position; let\r\nhim be given time and he will soon show himself to be a man of\r\nsuccess. Does not the last ray of hope for China depend on this?\r\n\r\nX. THE UNRIPE PEAR.\r\n\r\nThis is why I say we should not deliberately create trouble for\r\nthe Republic at this time to add to the worries of the Great\r\nPresident so that he might devote his puissant thoughts and\r\nenergies to the institution of great reforms. Then our final hope\r\nwill be satisfied some day. But what a year and what a day we are\r\nnow living in? The great crisis (Note: The reference is to the\r\nJapanese demands) has just passed and we have not yet had time for\r\na respite. By the pressure of a powerful neighbour we have been\r\ncompelled to sign a \"certain\" Treaty. Floods, drought, epidemics\r\nand locusts visit our country and the land is full of suffering\r\nwhile robbers plunder the people. In ancient times this would have\r\nbeen a day for the Imperial Court to remove their ornaments and\r\nlive in humiliation. What do the people of our day mean by\r\nadvising and urging the President to ascend the throne? To pluck\r\nthe fruit before it is ripe, injures the roots of the tree; and to\r\nforce the premature birth of a child kills the mother. If the last\r\n\"ray of hope\" for China should be extinguished by the failure of a\r\npremature attempt to force matters, how could the advocates of\r\nsuch a premature attempt excuse themselves before the whole\r\ncountry? Let the members of the Chou An Hui meditate on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe odes say, \"The people are tired. Let them have a respite.\" In\r\nless than four years' time from the 8th moon of the year Hsin Hai\r\nwe have had many changes. Like a bolt from the blue we had the\r\nManchu Constitution, then \"the Republic of Five Races,\" then the\r\nProvisional President, then the formal Presidency, then the\r\nProvisional Constitution was promulgated, then it was suddenly\r\namended, suddenly the National Assembly was convoked, suddenly it\r\nwas dissolved, suddenly we had a Cabinet System, suddenly it was\r\nchanged to a Presidential System, suddenly it was a short-term\r\nPresidency, suddenly it was a life-term Presidency, suddenly the\r\nProvisional Constitution was temporarily placed in a legal\r\nposition as a Permanent Constitution, suddenly the drafting of the\r\nPermanent Constitution was pressed. Generally speaking the average\r\nlife of each new system has been less than six months, after which\r\na new system quite contrary to the last succeeded it. Thus the\r\nwhole country has been at a loss to know where it stood and how to\r\nact; and thus the dignity and credit of the Government in the eyes\r\nof the people have been lowered down to the dust. There are many\r\nsubjects respecting internal and diplomatic affairs which we can\r\nprofitably discuss. If you wish to serve the country in a\r\npatriotic way you have many ways to do so. Why stir the peaceful\r\nwater and create a sea of troubles by your vain attempt to excite\r\nthe people and sow seeds of discord for the State?\r\n\r\nXI. THE ASSEVERATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nOne or two points more, and I am finished. These will be in the\r\nnature of a straight talk to the Chou An Hui. The question I would\r\nask in plain words is, who is the person you have in your mind as\r\nthe future Emperor? Do you wish to select a person other than the\r\nGreat President? You know only too well that the moment the\r\nPresident relieves his shoulder of the burdens of State the\r\ncountry will be thrown into confusion. If you entertain this plot\r\nwith the deliberation of a person bent upon the destruction of the\r\ncountry, then the four hundred million of people will not excuse\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nIs the man you have in mind the present President? Heaven and\r\nearth as well as all living creatures in China and other lands\r\nknow what the President swore to when he took the oath of office\r\nas President. Rumours have indeed been circulated, but whenever\r\nthey reached the ears of the President he has never hesitated to\r\nexpress his righteous mind, saying that no amount of pressure\r\ncould compel him to change his determination. All officials who\r\nhave come into close contact with the President have heard such\r\nsentiments from the lips of the President on not a few occasions.\r\nTo me his words are still ringing in my ears. General Feng Kuo-\r\nchang has conveyed to me what he was told by the President. He\r\nsays that the President has prepared a \"few rooms\" in England, and\r\nthat if the people would not spare him he would flee to the refuge\r\nhe has prepared. Thus we may clearly see how determined the\r\nPresident is. Can it be possible that you have never heard of this\r\nand thus raise this extraordinary subject without any cause. If\r\nthe situation should become such that the President should be\r\ncompelled to carry out his threat and desert the Palace, what\r\nwould you say and do then?\r\n\r\nOr, perhaps, you are measuring the lordly conduct of a gentleman\r\nwith the heart of a mean man, saying to yourself that what the\r\nPresident has been saying cannot be the truth, but, as Confucius\r\nhas said, \"say you are not but make a point to do it,\" and that,\r\nknowing that he would not condemn you, you have taken the risk. If\r\nso, then what do you take the President for? To go back on one's\r\nwords is an act despised by a vagabond. To suggest such an act as\r\nbeing capable of the President is an insult, the hideousness of\r\nwhich cannot be equalled by the number of hairs on one's head. Any\r\none guilty of such an insult should not be spared by the four\r\nhundred million of people.\r\n\r\nXII. THE CHOU AN HUI AND THE LAW\r\n\r\nNext let me ask if you have read the Provisional Constitution, the\r\nProvisional Code, the Meeting and Association Law, the Press\r\nRegulations, the various mandates bearing on the punishment of\r\npersons who dare conspire against the existing form of state? Do\r\nyou not know that you, as citizens of the Republic, must in duty\r\nbound observe the Constitution and obey the laws and mandates? Yet\r\nyou have dared openly to call together your partisans and incite a\r\nrevolution (the recognized definition in political science for\r\nrevolution is \"to change the existing form of state\"). As the\r\nJudiciary have not been courageous enough to deal with you since\r\nyou are all so closely in touch with the President, you have\r\nbecome bolder still and carry out your sinister scheme in broad\r\ndaylight. I do not wish to say what sort of peace you are planning\r\nfor China; but this much I know, that the law has been violated by\r\nyou to the last letter. I will be silent if you believe that a\r\nnation can be governed without law. Otherwise tell me what you\r\nhave got to say?\r\n\r\nIt is quite apparent that you will not be satisfied with mere\r\nshouting and what you aim at is the actual fulfilment of your\r\nexpectations. That is, you wish that once the expected monarchy is\r\nestablished it may continue for ever. Now by what principle can\r\nsuch a monarchy continue for ever, except that the laws and orders\r\nof that dynasty be obeyed, and obeyed implicitly by all, from the\r\nCourt down to the common people? For one to adopt methods that\r\nviolate the law while engaged in creating a new dynasty is like a\r\nman, who to secure a wife, induces the virtuous virgin to commit\r\nfornication with him, on the plea that as a marriage will be\r\narranged preservation of her virtue need not be insisted upon. Can\r\nsuch a man blame his wife for immorality after marriage? If, while\r\nstill citizens of a republican country, one may openly and boldly\r\ncall meetings and organize societies for the overthrow of the\r\nRepublic, who shall say that we may not in due time openly and\r\nboldly call meetings and organize societies for the overthrow of\r\nthe monarchy? What shall you say if in future there should be\r\nanother foreign doctor to suggest another theory and another\r\nsociety to engage in another form of activity? The Odes have it,\r\n\"To prevent the monkey from climbing a tree is like putting mud on\r\na man in the mire.\" For a person to adopt such methods while\r\nengaged in the making of a dynasty is the height of folly. Mencius\r\nsays, \"a Chuntse when creating a dynasty aims at things that can\r\nbe handed down as good examples.\" Is it not the greatest\r\nmisfortune to set up an example that cannot be handed down as a\r\nprecedent? The present state of affairs is causing me no small\r\namount of anxiety.\r\n\r\nXIII. A POSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\nA copy of Yang Tu's pamphlet, \"Constitutional Monarchy or the\r\nSalvation of China\" reached me after I had finished writing the\r\nabove discussion. On a casual glance through it I alighted upon\r\nthe following passage: \"What is known as a constitutional country\r\nis a country which has definite laws and in which no one, from the\r\nruler down to the common people, can take any action that is not\r\npermitted by law. Good men cannot do good outside of the bounds of\r\nlaw; neither can bad men do evil in violation of it.\" This is\r\nindeed a passage that breathes the very spirit of\r\nconstitutionalism. Let us ask Mr. Yang if the activities of the\r\nChou An Hui, of which he is the President, are acts within the\r\nbounds of law? Mr. Yang is a good man. It is therefore possible\r\nfor him to believe that he is not doing evil in violation of the\r\nlaw; but has he not at least been doing good outside of the bounds\r\nof law? If an advocate of constitutional monarchy is capable of\r\ndoing such unlawful acts, we may easily imagine what sort of a\r\nconstitutional monarchy he advocates; and we may also easily\r\nimagine what the fate of his constitutional monarchy will be.\r\n\r\nMencius says, \"Am I argumentative? I cannot help it.\" Who would\r\nhave thought that a man, who cares not for the question of the\r\nform of state like myself and who opposed you--Mr. Yang Tu--\r\nduring your first campaign for the change in the form of State--\r\nyou were a Republican then--would be opposing you again now that\r\nyou are engaged in advocating another change in the form of state?\r\nA change in the form of government is a manifestation of progress\r\nwhile a change in the status of the State is a sign of revolution.\r\nThe path of progress leads to further progress, but the path of\r\nrevolution leads to more revolution. This is a fact proved by\r\ntheory as well as actual experience. Therefore a man who has any\r\nlove for his country, is afraid to mention revolution; and as for\r\nmyself I am always opposed to revolution. I am now opposing your\r\ntheory of monarchical revolution, just as I once opposed your\r\ntheory of republican revolution, in the same spirit, and I am\r\ndoing the same duty. My belief is that since the country is now in\r\na most weakened state, we may yet fail even if we do all we can at\r\nall times to nurse its wound and gather up its scattered strength.\r\nHow can any one devote his time and energy to the discussion of a\r\nquestion of no importance such as the form of state, and so\r\nobstruct the progress of the administration? But this is not all.\r\nThe whole country is now stirred up to an excited state and is\r\nwondering how long this ever-changing situation is going to stop.\r\nThe loss caused by this state of affairs, though unnoticed, is\r\nincalculable. In the Odes, it is written \"Alas! my brethren.\r\nBefriended of the countrymen. No one wants rebellion. What has no\r\nparents?'\" Let the critics remember this--let them remember.\r\n\r\nSome will say to me that a revolution is an unavoidable thing. Of\r\nall things only the facts cannot be undone. Why then should I\r\nbother myself especially as my last effort fell on deaf ears. This\r\nI realize; but it is not my nature to abandon what is my\r\nconviction. Therefore, although aware of the futility of my words,\r\nI cannot refrain from uttering them all the same. Chu Yuan drowned\r\nhimself in the Pilo and Chia Sheng died from his horse. Ask them\r\nwhy they did these things, they will say they did not know. Once I\r\nwrote a piece of poetry containing the following lines:\r\n\r\n    \"Ten years after you will think of me,\r\n    The country is excited. To whom shall I speak?\"\r\n\r\nI have spoken much in my life, and all my words have become\r\nsubjects for meditation ten years after they were uttered. Never,\r\nhowever, have any of my words attracted the attention of my own\r\ncountrymen before a decade has spent itself. Is it a misfortune\r\nfor my words or a misfortune to the Country? My hope is that there\r\nwill be no occasion for the country to think of my present words\r\nten years hence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\"THE PEOPLE'S VOICE,\" AND THE ACTION OF THE POWERS (FROM SEPTEMBER\r\nTO DECEMBER, 1915)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of Liang Ch'i-chao's appeal was noticeable at once:\r\nthere were ominous mutterings among all the great class of\r\n\"intellectuals\" who form such a remarkable element throughout the\r\ncountry. Nevertheless there were no overt acts attempted against\r\nthe authority of Peking. Although literary and liberal China was\r\nnow thoroughly convinced that the usurpation which Yuan Shih-kai\r\nproposed to practise would be a national disgrace and lead to far-\r\nreaching complications, this force were too scattered and too much\r\nunder the power of the military to tender at once any active\r\nopposition as would have been the case in Western countries. Yuan\r\nShih-kai, measuring this situation very accurately, and aware that\r\nhe could easily become an object of popular detestation if the\r\npeople followed the lead of the scholars, decided to place himself\r\noutside and beyond the controversy by throwing the entire\r\nresponsibility on the Tsan Cheng Yuan, the puppet Senate he had\r\nerected in place of the parliament destroyed by his coup d'etat of\r\nthe 4th November, 1913. In a message issued to that body on the\r\n6th September, 1915, he declared that although in his opinion the\r\ntime was inappropriate for making any change in the form of State,\r\nthe matter demanded the most careful and serious consideration\r\nwhich he had no doubt would be given to it. If a change of so\r\nmomentous a character as was now being publicly advocated were\r\ndecided in too great a haste it might create grave complications:\r\ntherefore the opinion of the nation should be consulted by the\r\nmethod of the ballot. And with this nunc dimittis he officially\r\nwashed his hands of a plot in which he had been the prime mover.\r\n\r\nThe Senate now openly delivered itself over to the accomplishment\r\nof the scheme which had been broached by Yang Tu, the monarchist\r\npamphleteer. Although this individual still posed as the leader of\r\nthe movement, in reality he was nothing but the tool of a\r\nremarkable man, one Liang Shih-yi, famous throughout the country\r\nas the most unscrupulous and adroit politician the Revolution had\r\nthrown up. This person, who is known to have been gravely\r\nimplicated in many assassinations, and who was the instrument used\r\nin 1912 by Yuan Shih-kai to persuade the Manchu Imperial Family to\r\nabdicate, had in a brief four years accumulated a vast fortune by\r\nthe manipulations he had indulged in as Director-General of The\r\nBank of Communications, an institution which, because it disposed\r\nof all the railway receipts, was always in funds even when the\r\nCentral Treasury itself was empty. By making himself financially\r\nindispensable to Yuan Shih-kai he had become recognized as the\r\npower behind the Throne; for although, owing to foreign clamour,\r\nhe had been dismissed from his old office of Chief Secretary to\r\nthe President (which he had utilized to effect the sale of offices\r\nfar and wide) he was a daily visitor to the Presidential Palace\r\nand his creatures daily pulled all the numerous strings.\r\n\r\nThe scheme now adopted by the Senate was to cause the provinces to\r\nflood Peking with petitions, sent up through the agency of \"The\r\nSociety for the Preservation of Peace,\" demanding that the\r\nRepublic be replaced by that form of government which the people\r\nalone understood, the name Constitutional Monarchy being selected\r\nmerely as a piece of political window-dressing to please the\r\nforeign world. A vast amount of organizing had to be done behind\r\nthe scenes before the preliminaries were completed: but on the 6th\r\nOctober the scheme was so far advanced that in response to \"hosts\r\nof petitions\" the Senate, sitting in its capacity of Legislative\r\nChamber (Li Fa Yuan) passed a so-called King-making bill in which\r\nelaborate regulations were adopted for referring the question\r\nunder discussion to a provincial referendum. According to this\r\nnaive document the provinces were to be organized into electoral\r\ncolleges, and the votes of the electors, after being recorded,\r\nwere to be sent up to Peking for scrutiny. Some attempt was made\r\nto follow Dr. Goodnow's advice to secure as far as possible that\r\nthe various classes of the community should be specially\r\nrepresented: and provision was therefore made in the voting for\r\nthe inclusion of \"learned scholars,\" Chambers of Commerce, and\r\n\"oversea merchants,\" whose votes were to be directly recorded by\r\ntheir special delegates. To secure uniformly satisfactory results,\r\nthe whole election was placed absolutely and without restriction\r\nin the hands of the high provincial authorities, who were invited\r\nto bestow on the matter their most earnest attention.\r\n\r\nIn a Mandate, issued in response to this Bill, Yuan Shih-kai\r\nmerely limits himself to handing over the control of the elections\r\nand voting to the local authorities, safe in the knowledge that\r\nevery detail of the plot had been carefully worked out in advance.\r\nBy this time the fact that a serious and dangerous movement was\r\nbeing actively pushed had been well-impressed on the Peking\r\nLegations, and some anxiety was publicly manifested. It was known\r\nthat Japan, as the active enemy of Yuan Shih-kai, could not remain\r\npermanently silent: and on the 28th October in association with\r\nGreat Britain and Russia, she indeed made official inquiries at\r\nthe Chinese Foreign Office regarding the meaning of the movement.\r\nShe was careful, however, to declare that it was her solicitude\r\nfor the general peace that alone dictated her action. [Footnote: A\r\nvery remarkable illustration of the manner in which Yuan Shih-kai\r\nwas trapped by official Japan during the monarchist movement has\r\nrecently been extensively quoted in the Far Eastern press. Here is\r\nthe substance of a Japanese (vernacular) newspaper account showing\r\nthe uses to which Japanese politicians put the Press:\r\n\r\n\"... When that question was being hotly discussed in China Marquis\r\nOkuma, interviewed by the Press, stated that monarchy was the\r\nright form of government for China and that in case a monarchical\r\nregime was revived Yuan Shih-kai was the only suitable person to\r\nsit on the Throne. When this statement by Marquis Okuma was\r\npublished in the Japanese papers, Yuan Shih-kai naturally\r\nconcluded that the Japanese Government, at the head of which\r\nMarquis Okuma was, was favourably disposed towards him and the\r\nmonarchical movement. It can well be imagined, therefore, how\r\nintense was his surprise when he later received a warning from the\r\nJapanese Government against the resuscitation of the monarchy in\r\nChina. When this inconsistency in the Marquis's actions was called\r\nin question in the Japanese House of Representatives, the ex-\r\nPremier absolutely denied the truth of the statement attributed to\r\nhim by the Japanese papers, without any show of hesitancy, and\r\nthus boldly shirked the responsibility which, in reality, lay on\r\nhim ... \"] Nevertheless, her warning had an unmistakable note about\r\nit and occasioned grave anxiety, since the ultimatum of the\r\nprevious May in connection with the Twenty-one Demands had not\r\nbeen forgotten. At the beginning of November the Chinese Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs, replying verbally to these representations,\r\nalleged that the movement had gone too far for it to be stopped\r\nand insisted that no apprehensions need be felt by the Foreign\r\nPowers regarding the public safety. Dissatisfied by this reply all\r\nthe Entente Powers, now including France and Italy, renewed their\r\nrepresentations, receiving a few days later a formal Note in which\r\nabsolute guarantees were given that law and order would be\r\nsedulously preserved. Baffled by this firmness, and conscious that\r\nfurther intervention in such matter would be fraught with grave\r\ndifficulties, the Entente Powers decided to maintain a watchful\r\nattitude but to do no more publicly. Consequently events marched\r\nforward so rapidlly that by December the deed was done, and Yuan\r\nShih-kai had apparently been elected unanimously Emperor of China\r\nby the provincial ballot.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this extraordinary business was only made\r\npublic months later with the outbreak of the Yunnan rebellion and\r\nthe secession of the Southern provinces. In a remarkable\r\npublication, entitled satirically \"The People's Will,\" the\r\nSouthern Republican Party, which now possessed access to all the\r\nconfidential archives of the provinces, published in full the\r\nsecret instructions from Peking which had brought about this\r\nelaborate comedy. Though considerations of space prevent all\r\ndocuments being included in our analysis, the salient ones are\r\nhere textually quoted so as to exhibit in its proper historical\r\nlight the character of the chief actor, and the regime the Powers\r\nhad supported--until they were forced by Japan to be more honest.\r\nThese documents, consisting mainly of telegraphic despatches sent\r\nfrom Peking to the provinces, do more to explain the working of\r\nthe Government of China than a dozen treatises; for they drag into\r\nthe garish light of day the most secret Yamen machinery and show\r\nprecisely how it is worked.\r\n\r\nThe play was set in motion by a circular code telegram sent out on\r\nthe 30th August by Tuan Chih-kuei, Governor of Moukden and one of\r\nYuan Shih-kai's most trusted lieutenants, the device of utilizing\r\na centre other than the capital to propagate revolutionary ideas\r\nbeing a familiar one and looked upon as a very discreet procedure.\r\nThis initial telegram is a document that speaks for itself:\r\n\r\nCODE TELEGRAM DATED AUGUST 30, 1915, FROM TUAN CHI-KUEI, MILITARY\r\nGOVERNOR OF MOUKDEN, ET ALIA, CONTAINING INSTRUCTIONS FOR\r\nPRESENTING PETITIONS TO PEKING IN THE NAME OF THE CITIZENS OF THE\r\nPROVINCES\r\n\r\nTo the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces:--(To be\r\ndeciphered personally with the Council of State Code)\r\n\r\nThe proposal of changing the form of the State into a monarchy\r\nhaving been unanimously agreed to by the provinces, the first step\r\nto be taken has now to be decided. We propose that petitions be\r\nsent in the name of the citizens of the respective provinces to\r\nthe Senate acting in the capacity of Legislative Chamber, so as to\r\ndemonstrate the wish of the people to have a monarchy. The acting\r\nLegislative Chamber will then decide upon the course to be\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThe plan suggested is for each province to send in a separate\r\npetition, the draft of which will be made in Peking and wired to\r\nthe respective provinces in due course. If you approve, you will\r\ninsert your name as well as those of the gentry and merchants of\r\nthe province who agree to the draft. These petitions are to be\r\npresented one by one to the Legislative Chamber, as soon as it is\r\nconvoked. At all events, the change in the form of the State will\r\nhave to be effected under the colour of carrying out the people's\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nAs leading members of political and military bodies, we should\r\nwait till the opportune moment arrives when we will give\r\ncollateral support to the movement. Details of the plan will be\r\nmade known to you from time to time.\r\n\r\n This method of circular telegrams, which had been inherited from\r\nthe last days of the Manchus, and vastly extended during the POST-\r\nrevolutionary period, was now to be used to the very utmost in\r\nindoctrinating the provinces with the idea that not only was the\r\nRepublic doomed but that prompt steps must be taken to erect the\r\nConstitutional Monarchy by use of fictitious legal machinery so\r\nthat it should not be said that the whole enterprise was a mere\r\nplot. Accordingly, on the 10th September, as a sequel to the\r\ntelegram we have just quoted, an enormous circular message of\r\nseveral thousand words was sent in code from Peking to all the\r\nMilitary and Civil Governors in the provinces instructing them\r\nprecisely how to act in order to throw a cloak over the nefarious\r\ndeed. After explaining the so-called \"Law on the General\r\nConvention of the Citizens' Representatives\" (i. e. national\r\nreferendum) the following illuminating sentences occur which\r\nrequire no comment showing as they do what apt pupils reactionary\r\nChinese are in the matter of ballot-fraud.\r\n\r\n... (1) The fact that no fewer than one hundred petitions for a\r\nchange in the form of State have been received from people\r\nresiding in all parts of the country shows that the people are of\r\none mind concerning this matter. Hence the words in the \"General\r\nConvention Law\": \"to be decided by the General Convention of the\r\nCitizens' Representatives,\" refer to nothing more than the formal\r\napproval of the Convention and are by no means intended to give\r\nroom for discussion of any kind. Indeed, it was never intended\r\nthat the citizens should have any choice between a republic and a\r\nmonarchy. For this reason at the time of voting all the\r\nrepresentatives must be made unanimously to advocate a change of\r\nthe Republic into a Monarchy.\r\n\r\nIt behooves you, therefore, prior to the election and voting,\r\nprivately to search for such persons as are willing to express the\r\npeople's will in the sense above indicated. You will also make the\r\nnecessary arrangements beforehand, and devise every means to have\r\nsuch persons elected, so that there may be no divergence of\r\nopinion when the time arrives for putting the form of the State to\r\nthe vote.\r\n\r\n(2) Article 2 provides: \"The citizens' representatives shall be\r\nelected by separate ballot signed by the person voting. The person\r\nwho obtains the greatest number of votes cast shall be declared\r\nelected.\"\r\n\r\nThe citizens' representatives, though nominally elected by. the\r\nelectors, are really appointed beforehand by you acting in the\r\ncapacity of Superintendent of Election. The principle of separate\r\nsigned ballot is adopted in this article with the object of\r\npreventing the voters from casting their votes otherwise than as\r\ndirected, and of awakening in them a sense of responsibility for\r\ntheir votes ... .\r\n\r\nThese admirable principles having been officially laid down by\r\nPeking, it is not hard to understand that the Military and Civil\r\nGovernors in the provinces, being anxious to retain their posts\r\nand conciliate the great personage who would be king, gave the\r\nproblem their most earnest attention, and left no stone unturned\r\nto secure that there should be no awkward contretemps. On the 28th\r\nSeptember, the Peking Government, being now entirely surrendered\r\ninto the hands of the plotters, thought it advisable to give the\r\ncommon people a direct hint of what was coming, by sending\r\ncircular instructions regarding the non-observance of the\r\nRepublican anniversary (10th October). The message in question is\r\nso frankly ingenuous that it merits inclusion in this singular\r\nDOSSIER:\r\n\r\nCODE TELEGRAM DATED SEPTEMBER 26, 1915, FROM THE COUNCIL OF STATE\r\nTO THE MILITARY AND CIVIL GOVERNORS OF THE PROVINCES RESPECTING\r\nTHE NON-OBSERVANCE OF THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE REPUBLIC\r\n\r\nTo the Military and Civil Governors and the Military Commissioners\r\nof the Provinces and the Intendant of Shanghai:--\r\n\r\n(Code Telegram)\r\n\r\nNow that a monarchical form of government has been advocated, the\r\nNational Anniversary in commemoration of the Republic should, of\r\ncourse, be observed with least possible display, under the pretext\r\neither of the necessity for economy owing to the impoverished\r\ncondition of the people, or of the advisability of celebrating the\r\noccasion quietly so as to prevent disturbances arising in\r\nconsequence of the many rumours now afloat. In this way public\r\npeace and order may be maintained on the one hand, money and\r\ntrouble saved on the other. How to put this suggestion into\r\npractice will be left to your discretion.\r\n\r\n(Signed) COUNCIL OF STATE.\r\n\r\nBy October such progress had been made in Peking in the general\r\nwork of organizing this coup d'etat that as we have seen, the\r\nSenate had passed on the 6th of that month the so-called \"King-\r\nmaking Bill.\" The very next day, so that nothing should be left in\r\ndoubt, the following circular telegram was dispatched to all the\r\nprovinces:\r\n\r\nCODE TELEGRAM DATED OCTOBER 7, 1915, FROM CHU CHI-CHUN, MINISTER\r\nOF THE INTERIOR, ET ALIA, DEVISING PLANS FOR NOMINATING YUAN SHIH-\r\nKAI AS EMPEROR\r\n\r\nTo the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces:--\r\n\r\n(To be deciphered with the Hua Code)\r\n\r\nOur telegram of the 12th ult. must have reached you by this time.\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Council, at a meeting held on the 4th inst.,\r\npassed the Bill for a General Convention of the Citizens'\r\nRepresentatives. Article 12 of the Bill was amended so as to\r\ncontain the following clause:--\"The Superintendent of Election\r\nmay, in case of necessity, delegate his functions to the several\r\ndistrict magistrates.\" This will soon be communicated officially\r\nto the provinces. You are therefore requested to make the\r\nnecessary preparations beforehand in accordance with the\r\ninstructions contained in our telegram of the 29th September.\r\n\r\nWe propose that the following steps be taken after the votes have\r\nbeen duly polled:--\r\n\r\n(1) After the form of the state has been put to the vote, the\r\nresult should be reported to the sovereign (meaning Yuan-shihkai)\r\nand to the Administrative Council in the name of the General\r\nConvention of the Citizens' Representatives.\r\n\r\n(2) In the telegrams to be sent by the General Convention of the\r\nCitizens' Representatives for nominating the emperor, the\r\nfollowing words should be specifically used: \"We respectfully\r\nnominate the present President Yuan Shih-kai as Emperor of the\r\nChinese Empire.\"\r\n\r\n(3) The telegrams investing the Administrative Council with\r\ngeneral powers to act on behalf of the General Convention of the\r\nCitizens' Representatives should be dispatched in the name of the\r\nGeneral Convention of the Citizens of the Provinces.\r\n\r\nThe drafts of the dispatches under the above-mentioned three heads\r\nwill be wired to you beforehand. As soon as the votes are cast,\r\nthese are to be shown to the representatives, who will sign them\r\nafter perusal. Peking should be immediately informed by telegram.\r\n\r\nAs for the telegrams to be sent by the commercial, military, and\r\npolitical bodies, they should bear as many signatures as possible,\r\nand be wired to the Central Government within three days after the\r\nvoting.\r\n\r\nWhen the enthronement is promulgated by edict, letters of\r\ncongratulation from the General Convention of the Citizens'\r\nRepresentatives, as well as from the commercial, military, and\r\npolitical bodies, will also have to be sent in. You are therefore\r\nrequested to draw up these letters in advance.\r\n\r\nThis is specially wired for your information beforehand. The\r\ndetails will be communicated by letter.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary circumstances it would have been thought that\r\nsufficiently implicit instructions had already been given to\r\npermit leaving the matter in the hands of the provincial\r\nauthorities. Great anxiety, however, was beginning to reign in\r\nPeking owing to continual rumours that dangerous opposition, both\r\ninternal and external, was developing. It was therefore held\r\nnecessary to clinch the matter in such a way that no possible\r\nquestions should be raised later. Accordingly, before the end of\r\nOctober--and only two days before the \"advice\" was tendered by\r\nJapan and her Allies,--the following additional instructions were\r\ntelegraphed wholesale to the provinces, being purposely designed\r\nto make it absolutely impossible for any slip to occur between cup\r\nand lip. The careful student will not fail to notice in these\r\nremarkable messages that as the game develops, all disguise is\r\nthrown to the four winds, and the central and only important\r\npoint, namely the prompt election and enthronement of Yuan Shih-\r\nkai as Emperor, insisted on with almost indecent directness, every\r\npossible precaution being taken to secure that end:\r\n\r\nCODE TELEGRAM DATED OCTOBER 26, 1915, FROM CUU CHI-CUUN, MINISTER\r\nOF THE INTERIOR, ET ALIA, RESPECTING THE NOMINATION OF YUAN SHIH-\r\nKAI AS EMPEROR\r\n\r\nTo the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces:--\r\n\r\n(To be deciphered with the Hua Code)\r\n\r\nYour telegram of the 24th inst. came duly to hand. After the form\r\nof the state has been put to the vote, the nomination of Yuan\r\nShih-kai as emperor should be made forthwith without further\r\nvoting. You should address the representatives and tell them that\r\na monarchy having been decided on, not even a single day should\r\npass without an emperor; that the citizens' representatives\r\npresent should nominate Yuan Shih-kai as the Great Emperor of the\r\nChinese Empire; and that if they are in favour of the proposal,\r\nthey should signify their assent by standing up. This done, the\r\ntext of the proposed letter of nomination from the citizens should\r\nbe handed to the representatives for their signatures; after which\r\nyou should again address them to the effect that in all matters\r\nconcerning the nomination and the petition for immediate\r\nenthronement, they may, in the name of the citizens'\r\nrepresentatives, invest the acting Legislative Council with\r\ngeneral powers to act on their behalf and to do the necessary\r\nthings until their petition is granted. The text (already\r\nprepared) of the proposed telegram from the citizens'\r\nrepresentatives to the acting Legislative Council should then be\r\nshown to the representatives for approval. Whereupon three\r\nseparate telegrams are to be drawn up: one giving the number of\r\nvotes in favour of a change in the form of the state, one\r\ncontaining the original text of the letter of nomination, and the\r\nthird concerning the vesting of the acting Legislative Council\r\nwith general powers to act on behalf of the citizens'\r\nrepresentatives. These should be sent officially to the acting\r\nLegislative Council in the name of the citizens' representatives.\r\nYou should at the same time wire to the President all that has\r\ntaken place. The votes and the letter of nomination are to be\r\nforwarded to Peking in due course.\r\n\r\nAs for the exact words to be inserted in the letter of nomination,\r\nthey have been communicated to you in our telegram of the 23rd\r\ninst. These characters, forty-five in all, must on no account be\r\naltered. The rest of the text is left to your discretion.\r\n\r\nWe may add that since the letter of nomination and the vesting of\r\nthe acting Legislative Council with general powers to act on\r\nbehalf of the citizens' representatives are matters which\r\ntransgress the bounds of the law, you are earnestly requested not\r\nto send to the National Convention Bureau any telegraphic enquiry\r\nconcerning them, so that the latter may not find itself in the\r\nawkward position of having to reply.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this telegram had been dispatched the long-feared\r\naction on the part of Japan had been taken and a new situation had\r\nbeen created. The Japanese \"advice\" of the 28th October was in\r\nfact a veritable bombshell playing havoc with the house of cards\r\nwhich had been so carefully erected. But the intrigue had gone so\r\nfar, and the prizes to be won by the monarchical supporters were\r\nso great that nothing could induce them to retrace their\r\nfootsteps. For a week and more a desperate struggle went on behind\r\nthe scenes in the Presidential Palace, since Yuan Shih-kai was too\r\nastute a man not to understand that a most perilous situation was\r\nbeing rapidly created and that if things went wrong he would be\r\nthe chief victim. But family influences and the voice of the\r\nintriguers proved too strong for him, and in the end he gave his\r\nreluctant consent to a further step. The monarchists, boldly\r\nacting on the principle that possession is nine points of the law,\r\ncalled upon the provinces to anticipate the vote and to substitute\r\nthe title of Emperor for that of President in all government\r\ndocuments and petitions so that morally the question would be\r\nchose jugee.\r\n\r\nCODE TELEGRAM DATED NOVEMBER 7, 1915, FROM CHU CHI-CHUN, MINISTER.\r\nOF THE INTERIOR, ET ALIA, ENJOINING A STRONG ATTITUDE TOWARDS\r\nINTERFERENCE ON THE PART OF A CERTAIN FOREIGN POWER\r\n\r\nTo the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces:--\r\n\r\n(To be deciphered personally with the Council of State Code)\r\n\r\nA certain foreign power, under the pretext that the Chinese people\r\nare not of one mind and that troubles are to be apprehended, has\r\nlately forced England and Russia to take part in tendering advice\r\nto China. In truth, all foreign nations know perfectly well that\r\nthere will be no trouble, and they are obliged to follow the\r\nexample of that power. If we accept the advice of other Powers\r\nconcerning our domestic affairs and postpone the enthronement, we\r\nshould be recognizing their right to interfere. Hence action\r\nshould under no circumstance be deferred. When all the votes of\r\nthe provinces unanimously recommending the enthronement shall have\r\nreached Peking, the Government will, of course, ostensibly assume\r\na wavering and compromising attitude, so as to give due regard to\r\ninternational relations. The people, on the other hand, should\r\nshow their firm determination to proceed with the matter at all\r\ncosts, so as to let the foreign powers know that our people are of\r\none mind. If we can only make them believe that the change of the\r\nrepublic into a monarchy will not in the least give rise to\r\ntrouble of any kind, the effects of the advice tendered by Japan\r\nwill ipso facto come to nought.\r\n\r\nAt present the whole nation is determined to nominate Yuan Shih-\r\nkai Emperor. All civil and military officers, being the natural\r\nleaders of the people, should accordingly give effect to the\r\nnomination. If this can be done without friction, the confidence\r\nof both Chinese and foreigners in the Government will be greatly\r\nstrengthened. This is why we suggested to you in a previous\r\ntelegram the necessity of immediately substituting the title of\r\n\"Emperor\" for \"President.\" We trust you will concur in our\r\nsuggestion and carry it out without delay.\r\n\r\nWe may add that this matter should be treated as strictly\r\nconfidential.\r\n\r\nA reply is requested.\r\n\r\n(Signed)\r\n\r\nThe die now being cast all that was left to be done was to rush\r\nthrough the voting in the Provinces. Obsequious officials returned\r\nto the use of the old Imperial phraseology and Yuan Shih-kai, even\r\nbefore his \"election,\" was memorialized as though he were the\r\nlegitimate successor of the immense line of Chinese sovereigns who\r\nstretch back to the mythical days of Yao and Shun (2,800 B.C.).\r\nThe beginning of December saw the voting completed and the results\r\ntelegraphed to Peking; and on the 11th December, the Senate\r\nhastily meeting, and finding that \"the National Convention of\r\nCitizens\" had unanimously elected Yuan Shih-kai Emperor, formally\r\noffered him the Throne in a humble petition. Yuan Shih-kai\r\nmodestly refused: a second petition was promptly handed to him,\r\nwhich he was pleased to accept in the following historic document:\r\n\r\nYUAN SHIH-KAI's ACCEPTANCE OF THE IMPERIAL THRONE\r\n\r\nThe prosperity and decline of the country is a part of the\r\nresponsibility of every individual, and my love for the country is\r\ncertainly not less than that of others. But the task imposed on me\r\nby the designation of the millions of people is of extraordinary\r\nmagnitude. It is therefore impossible for one without merit and\r\nwithout virtue like myself to shoulder the burdens of State\r\ninvolved in the enhancing of the welfare of the people, the\r\nstrengthening of the standing of the country, the reformation of\r\nthe administration and the advancement of civilization. My former\r\ndeclaration was, therefore, the expression of a sincere heart and\r\nnot a mere expression of modesty. My fear was such that I could\r\nnot but utter the words which I have expressed. The people,\r\nhowever, have viewed with increasing impatience that declaration\r\nand their expectation of me is now more pressing than ever. Thus I\r\nfind myself unable to offer further argument just as I am unable\r\nto escape the position. The laying of a great foundation is,\r\nhowever, a thing of paramount importance and it must not be done\r\nin a hurry. I, therefore, order that the different Ministries and\r\nBureaux take concerted action in making the necessary preparations\r\nin the affairs in which they are concerned; and when that is done,\r\nlet the same be reported to me for promulgation. Meanwhile all our\r\ncitizens should go on peacefully in their daily vocations with the\r\nview to obtain mutual benefit. Let not your doubts and suspicions\r\nhinder you in your work. All the officials should on their part be\r\nfaithful at their posts and maintain to the best of their ability\r\npeace and order in their localities, so that the ambition of the\r\nGreat President to work for the welfare of the people may thus be\r\nrealized. Besides forwarding the memorial of the principal\r\nrepresentatives of the Convention of the Representatives of\r\nCitizens and that of the provinces and special administrative area\r\nto the Cheng Shih Tang and publishing the same by a mandate, I\r\nhave the honour to notify the acting Li Fan Yuan as the principal\r\nrepresentatives of the Convention of the Representatives of\r\nCitizens, to this effect.\r\n\r\nCautious to the end, it will be seen that Yuan Shih-kai's very\r\nacceptance is so worded as to convey the idea that he is being\r\nforced to a course of action which is against his better\r\ninstincts. There is no word of what came to be called the Grand\r\nCeremony i. e. the enthronement. That matter is carefully left in\r\nabeyance and the government departments simply told to make the\r\nnecessary preparations. The attitude of Peking officialdom is\r\nwell-illustrated in a circular telegram dispatched to the\r\nprovinces three days later, the analysis of Japan's relationship\r\nto the Entente Powers being particularly revealing. The obsequious\r\nnote which pervades this document is also particularly noticeable\r\nand shows how deeply the canker of sycophancy had now eaten in.\r\n\r\nCODE TELEGRAM DATED DECEMBER 14, 1915, FROM THE OFFICE OF\r\nCOMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE LAND AND NAVAL FORCES, RESPECTING\r\nCHINA'S ATTITUDE TOWARDS FOREIGN NATIONS\r\n\r\nTo the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces:--(To be\r\ndeciphered with the Hua Code)\r\n\r\nOn the 11th inst. the acting Legislature Council submitted a\r\nmemorial to the Emperor, reporting on the number of votes cast by\r\nthe people in favour of a monarchy and the letters of nomination\r\nof Yuan Shih-kai as Emperor received from all parts of the\r\ncountry, and begged that he would ascend the Throne at an early\r\ndate. His Majesty was, however, so modest as to decline. The\r\nCouncil presented a second memorial couched in the most entreating\r\nterms, and received an order to the effect that all the ministries\r\nand departments were to make the necessary preparations for the\r\nenthronement. The details of this decision appeared in the\r\nPresidential Orders of the past few days, so need not be repeated\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe people are unanimously of the opinion that in a republic the\r\nfoundation of the state is very apt to be shaken and the policy of\r\nthe government to be changed; and that consequently there is no\r\npossibility of enjoying everlasting peace and prosperity, nor any\r\nhope for the nation to become powerful. Now that the form of the\r\nstate has been decided in favour of a monarchy and the person who\r\nis to sit on the Throne agreed upon, the country is placed on a\r\nsecure basis, and the way to national prosperity and strength is\r\nthus paved.\r\n\r\nBeing the trustworthy ministers and, as it were, the hands and\r\nfeet of His Majesty, we are united to him by more ties than one.\r\nOn this account we should with one mind exert our utmost efforts\r\nin discharging our duty of loyalty to the country. This should be\r\nthe spirit which guides us in our action at the beginning of the\r\nnew dynasty. As for the enthronement, it is purely a matter of\r\nceremony. Whether it takes place earlier or later is of no moment.\r\nMoreover His Majesty has always been modest, and does everything\r\nwith circumspection. We should all appreciate his attitude.\r\n\r\nSo far as our external relations are concerned, a thorough\r\nunderstanding must be come to with the foreign nations, so that\r\nrecognition of the new regime may not be delayed and diplomatic\r\nintercourse interrupted. Japan, has, in conjunction with the\r\nEntente Powers, tendered advice to postpone the change of the\r\nRepublic into an empire. As a divergence of opinion exists between\r\nJapan and the Entente Powers, the advice is of no great effect.\r\nBesides, the Elders and the Military Party in Japan are all\r\nopposed to the action taken by their Government. Only the press in\r\nTokyo has spread all sorts of threatening rumours. This is\r\nobviously the upshot of ingenious plots on the part of\r\nirresponsible persons. If we postpone the change we shall be\r\nsubject to foreign interference, and the country will consequently\r\ncease to exist as an independent state. On the other hand, if we\r\nproclaim the enthronement forthwith, we shall then be flatly\r\nrejecting the advice,--an act which, we apprehend, will not be\r\ntolerated by Japan. As a result, she will place obstacles in the\r\nway of recognition of the new order of things.\r\n\r\nSince a monarchy has been decided to be the future form of the\r\nstate, and His Majesty has consented to accept the Throne, the\r\nchange may be said to be an accomplished fact. There is no\r\nquestion about it. All persons of whatever walk of life can\r\nhenceforth continue their pursuits without anxiety. In the\r\nmeantime we will proceed slowly and surely with the enthronement,\r\nas it involves many ceremonies and diplomatic etiquette. In this\r\nway both our domestic and our foreign policies will remain\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nWe hope you will comprehend our ideas and treat them as strictly\r\nconfidential.\r\n\r\n(Signed) Office of the Commander-in-Chief of the Land and Naval\r\nForce.\r\n\r\nAfter this one last step remained to be taken--it was necessary to\r\nburn all the incriminating evidence. On the 21st December, the\r\nlast circular telegram in connection with this extraordinary\r\nbusiness was dispatched from Peking, a delightful naivete being\r\ndisplayed regarding the possibility of certain letters and\r\ntelegrams having transgressed the bounds of the law. All such\r\ndelinquencies are to be mercifully wiped out by the simple and\r\nadmirable method of invoking the help of the kitchen-fires. And in\r\nthis appropriate way does the monster-play end.\r\n\r\nCODE TELEGRAM DATED DECEMBER 21, 1915, FROM THE NATIONAL\r\nCONVENTION BUREAU, ORDERING THE DESTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS CONNECTED\r\nWITH THE ELECTIONS\r\n\r\nTo the Military and Civil Governors of the Provinces, the Military\r\nCommissioners at Foochow and Kweiyang; the Military Commandants at\r\nChangteh, Kweihuating, and Kalgan; and the Commissioner of Defence\r\nat Tachienlu:--\r\n\r\n(To be deciphered with the Hua Code)\r\n\r\nThe change in the form of the state is now happily accomplished.\r\nThis is due not only to the unity of the people's minds, but more\r\nespecially to the skill with which, in realizing the object of\r\nsaving the country, you have carried out the propaganda from the\r\nbeginning, managed affairs according to the exigencies of the\r\noccasions, and adapted the law to suit the circumstances. The\r\npeople have, to be sure, become tired of the Republic; yet unless\r\nyou had taken the lead, they would not have dared to voice their\r\nsentiments. We all appreciate your noble efforts.\r\n\r\nEver since the monarchical movement was started, the people as\r\nwell as the high officials in the different localities have\r\nrepeatedly petitioned for the change, a fact which proves that the\r\npeople's will is in favour of it. In order to enable the people to\r\nexpress their will through a properly constituted organ, the\r\nGeneral Convention of the Citizens' Representatives has been\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nSince the promulgation of the Law on the Organization of the\r\nCitizens' Representatives, we, who are devoted to the welfare of\r\nthe state, desire to see that the decisions of that Convention do\r\nnot run counter to the wishes of the people. We are so anxious\r\nabout the matter that we have striven so to apply the law to meet\r\nthe circumstances as to carry out our designs. It is out of\r\npatriotic motives that we have adopted the policy of adhering to\r\nthe law, whenever possible, and, at the same time, of yielding to\r\nexpediency, whenever necessary. During the progress of this scheme\r\nthere may have been certain letters and telegrams, both official\r\nand private, which have transgressed the bounds of the law. They\r\nwill become absolutely useless after the affair is finished.\r\nMoreover, no matter how carefully their secrets may have been\r\nguarded, still they remain as permanent records which might\r\ncompromise us; and in the event of their becoming known to\r\nforeigners, we shall not escape severe criticism and bitter\r\nattacks, and, what is worse, should they be handed down as part of\r\nthe national records, they will stain the opening pages of the\r\nhistory of the new dynasty. The Central Government, after\r\ncarefully considering the matter, has concluded that it would be\r\nbetter to sort out and burn the document so as to remove all\r\nunnecessary records and prevent regrettable consequences. For\r\nthese reasons you are hereby requested to sift out all telegrams,\r\nletters, and dispatches concerning the change in the form of the\r\nstate, whether official or private, whether received from Peking\r\nor the provinces (excepting those required by law to be filed on\r\nrecord), and cause the same to be burnt in your presence. As for\r\nthose which have already been communicated to the local officials,\r\nyou are likewise requested to order them to be returned\r\nimmediately; to commit them to the flames; and to report to this\r\nBureau for future reference the total number of documents so\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe present change in the form of the state constitutes the most\r\nglorious episode of our national history. Not only is this far\r\nsuperior to the succession of dynasties by right of conquest or in\r\nvirtue of voluntary transfer (as in the days of Yao and Shun), but\r\nit compares favourably with all the peaceful changes that have\r\ntaken place in western politics. Everything will be perfect if\r\nwhatever mars it (meaning the documents) is done away with.\r\n\r\nAll of you have acquired greatness in founding the dynasty. You\r\nwill doubtless concur with us, and will, we earnestly hope, lose\r\nno time in cautiously and secretly carrying out our request.\r\n\r\nWe respectfully submit this to your consideration and wait for a\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n(Signed) NATIONAL CONVENTION BUREAU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\"THE THIRD REVOLUTION\"\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLT OF YUNNAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the circumstances it was only natural that the\r\nextraordinary chapter of history we have just narrated should have\r\nmarched to its appointed end in just as extraordinary a manner as\r\nit had commenced. Yuan Shih-kai, the uncrowned king, actually\r\nenjoyed in peace his empty title only for a bare fortnight, the\r\ncurious air of unreality becoming more and more noticeable after\r\nthe first burst of excitement occasioned by his acceptance of the\r\nThrone had subsided. Though the year 1915 ended with Peking\r\nbrightly illuminated in honour of the new regime, which had\r\nadopted in conformity with Eastern precedents a new calendar under\r\nthe style of Hung Hsien or \"glorious Constitutionalism,\" that\r\nofficial joy was just as false as the rest had been and awakened\r\nthe incredulity of the crowd.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Day ominous rumours had spread in the diplomatic\r\ncircle that dramatic developments in South China had come which\r\nnot only directly challenged the patient plotting of months but\r\nmade a debacle appear inevitable. Very few days afterwards it was\r\ngenerally known that the southernmost province of China, Yunnan--\r\non the borders of French-Indo-China--had telegraphed the Central\r\nGovernment a thinly veiled ultimatum, that either the monarchy\r\nmust be cancelled and the chief monarchists executed at once or\r\nthe province would take such steps as were deemed advisable. The\r\ntext of these telegrams which follows was published by the\r\ncourageous editor of the Peking Gazette on the 31st December and\r\nelectrified the capital. The reader will not fail to note how\r\nrichly allegorical they are in spite of their dramatic nature:\r\n\r\nFIRST TELEGRAM\r\n\r\nTo the Great President:\r\n\r\nSince the question of Kuo-ti (form of State) was raised\r\nconsternation has seized the public mind; and on account of the\r\ninterference of various Powers the spirit of the people has been\r\nmore and more aroused. They have asked the question:--\"Who has\r\ninvited the disaster, and brought upon us such great disgrace?\"\r\nSome one must be responsible for the alien insults heaped on us.\r\n\r\nWe have learned that each day is given to rapid preparations for\r\nthe Grand Ceremony; and it is now true that, internally, public\r\nopinion has been slighted, and, externally, occasions have been\r\noffered to foreigners to encroach on our rights. Our blood runs\r\ncold when we face the dangers at the door. Not once but twice hath\r\nthe President taken the oath to observe and obey the Constitution\r\nand protect and maintain the Republic. The oath was sworn before\r\nHeaven and Earth; and it is on record in the hearts of millions of\r\npeople and the words thereof still echo in the ears of the people\r\nof all nations. In the Classics it is said that \"in dealing with\r\nthe people of the country, faith is of the essence of great rule.\"\r\nAgain it is written that \"without faith a people cannot endure as\r\na nation.\" How then can one rule the people when he \"eats\" his own\r\nwords and tears his own oath? Principle has now been cast to the\r\nwinds and the Kuo-ti has been changed. We know not how the country\r\ncan be administered.\r\n\r\nSince the suspension of the National Assembly and the revision of\r\nthe Constitution, the powers of Government have been centred in\r\none person, with the implied freedom to do whatever seems meet\r\nwithout let or hindrance. If the Government were to use this power\r\nin order to reform the administration and consolidate the\r\nfoundations of the nation, there would be no fear of failure. For\r\nthe whole country would submit to the measures of the Central\r\nGovernment. Thus there is not the least necessity to commit\r\ntreason by changing the Kuo-ti.\r\n\r\nBut although the recent decision of the Citizens' Representatives\r\nin favour of a monarchy and the request of the high local\r\nofficials for the President's accession to the Throne have been\r\nrepresented as inspired by the unanimous will of the people, it is\r\nwell known that the same has been the work of ignoble men whose\r\nbribery and intimidation have been sanctioned by the authorities.\r\nAlthough inept efforts have been made to disguise the deceit, the\r\nsame is unhidden to the eyes of the world.\r\n\r\nFortunately it is said that the President has from the very\r\nbeginning maintained a calm attitude, speaking not his mind on the\r\nsubject. It is now as easy to turn the tide as the reversing of\r\nthe palm. It may be objected that if the \"face\" of the nation is\r\nnot preserved in view of the interference of Foreign Powers, there\r\nwill be great danger in future. But it must be observed that\r\nofficial declaration can only be made in accordance with the will\r\nof the people, the tendency of which can easily be ascertained by\r\nsearching for the facts. If the will of the people that the\r\ncountry should be the common property of the Nation be obeyed and\r\nthe idea of the President that a Dynasty is as cheap as a worn-out\r\nshoe is heeded, the latter has it in his power to loosen the\r\nstring that suspends the bell just as much as the person who has\r\nhung it. If the wrong path is not forsaken, it is feared that as\r\nsoon as the heart of the people is gone, the country will be\r\nbroken to pieces and the dismemberment of the Nation will take\r\nplace when alien pressure is applied to us. We who have hitherto\r\nreceived favours from the President and have received high\r\nappointments from him hereby offer our faithful advice in the\r\nspirit of men who are sailing in common in a boat that is in\r\ndanger; we speak as do those who love sincerity and cherish the\r\nunbroken word. We hope that the President will, with courage,\r\nrefuse to listen to the speech of evil counsellors and heed the\r\nvoice of conscience and of honour. We further hope that he will\r\nrenew his promise to protect the Republic; and will publicly swear\r\nthat a monarchical system will never again appear.\r\n\r\nThus the heart of the people will be settled and the foundations\r\nof the Nation will be consolidated. Then by enlisting the services\r\nof sagacious colleagues in order to surmount the difficulties of\r\nthe time and sweeping away all corruption and beginning anew with\r\nthe people, it may be that the welfare and interest of the Nation\r\nwill be furthered. In sending this telegram our eyes are wet with\r\ntears knowing not what more to say. We respectfully await the\r\norder of the President with our troops under arms.\r\n\r\n(Signed) THE GOVERNORS OF YUNNAN.\r\n\r\nSECOND TELEGRAM\r\n\r\nFor the Perusal of the Great President:--\r\n\r\nIn our humble opinion the reason why the people--Chinese and\r\nforeign--cannot excuse the President is because the movement for\r\nthe change of Kuo-ti has been inspired, and indeed actually\r\noriginated in Peking, and that the ringleaders of the plot against\r\nthe Min Kuo are all \"bosom-men\" of the President. The Chou An Hui,\r\norganized by Yang Tu and five other men, set the fire ablaze and\r\nthe circular telegram sent by Chu Chi-chien and six other persons\r\nprecipitated the destruction of the Republican structure. The\r\nPresident knew that the bad deed was being done and yet he did\r\nnothing to arrest the same or punish the evil-doers. The people\r\ntherefore, are suspicious. A mandate was issued on the 24th of the\r\n11th month of the 3rd year in which it is affirmed: \"Democracy and\r\nrepublicanism are laid down in the Constitutional Compact; and\r\nthere is also a law relating to the punishment of those who spread\r\nsedition in order to disturb the minds of the people. If any one\r\nshall hereafter dare to advance strange doctrines and misconstrue\r\nthe meaning of the Constitution, he will be punished severely in\r\naccordance with the law of sedition.\"\r\n\r\nYang Tu for having publicly organized the said Society and Chu\r\nChi-chien for having directly plotted by telegram are the\r\nprincipal offenders in the present flagrant case of sedition. As\r\ntheir crimes are obvious and the subject of abundant proof, we\r\nhereby ask the President to carry out at once the terms of the\r\nsaid mandate and publicly execute Yang Tu, Sun Yu-yun, Yen Fu, Liu\r\nShih-pei, Li Hsieh-ho, Hu Ying, Chu Chi-chien, Tuan Chih-kuei,\r\nChow Tze-chi, Liang Shih-yi, Chang Cheng-fang and Yuan Nai-kuan\r\nto the end that the whole nation may be pacified. Then, and not\r\ntill then, will the world believe in the sincerity of the\r\nPresident, in his love for the country and his intention to abide\r\nby the law. All the troops and people here are in anger; and\r\nunless a substantial proof from the Central Authorities is\r\nforthcoming, guaranteeing the maintenance of the Republic, it will\r\nbe impossible to suppress or pacify them. We await a reply within\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n(Signed) THE GOVERNORS OF YUNNAN PROVINCE.\r\n\r\nIt was evident from the beginning that pride prevented Yuan Shih-\r\nkai from retreating from the false position he had taken up. Under\r\nhis instructions the State Department sent a stream of powerful\r\ntelegraphic messages to Yunnan attempting to dissuade the\r\nRepublican leaders from revolt. But the die had been cast and very\r\ngravely the standard of rebellion was raised in the capital city\r\nof Yunnan and the people exhorted to shed their blood. Everything\r\npointed to the fact that this rising was to be very different from\r\nthe abortive July outbreak of 1913. There was a soberness and a\r\ndeliberation about it all which impressed close observers with a\r\nsense of the ominous end which was now in sight.\r\n\r\nStill Peking remained purblind. During the month of January the\r\nsplendour of the dream empire, which was already dissolving into\r\nthin air, filled the newspapers. It was reported that an Imperial\r\nEdict printed on Yellow Paper announcing the enthronement was\r\nready for universal distribution: that twelve new Imperial Seals\r\nin jade or gold were being manufactured: that a golden chair and a\r\nmagnificent State Coach in the style of Louis XV were almost\r\nready. Homage to the portrait of Yuan Shih-kai by all officials\r\nthroughout the country was soon to be ordered; sycophantic\r\nscholars were busily preparing a volume poetically entitled \"The\r\nGolden Mirror of the Empire,\" in which the virtues of the new\r\nsovereign were extolled in high-sounding language. A recondite\r\nsignificance, it was said, was to be given to the old ceremonial\r\ndress, which was to be revived, from the fact that every official\r\nwould carry a Hu or Ivory Tablet to be held against the breast.\r\nThe very mention of this was sufficient to make the local price of\r\nivory leap skywards! In the privacy of drawing-rooms the story\r\nwent the rounds that Yuan Shih-kai, now completely deluded into\r\nbelieving in the success of his great scheme, had held a full-\r\ndress rehearsal of a ceremony which would be the first one at his\r\nnew Court when he would invest the numerous ladies of his\r\nestablishment with royal rank. Seated on his Throne he had been\r\nengaged in instructing these interested females, already robed in\r\nmagnificent costumes, in the parts they were to play, when he had\r\nnoticed the absence of the Korean Lady--a consort he had won, it\r\nis said, in his Seoul days in competition against the Japanese\r\nEnvoy accredited to Korea, thereby precipitating the war of 1894-\r\n95. [Footnote: This story is firmly believed by many, namely that\r\na beautiful woman caused the loss of Korea.] The Korean Lady had\r\nrefused to enter the Throne-room, he was told, because she was\r\ndissatisfied with the rank he proposed to confer on her. Sternly\r\nhe sent for her and told her to take her place in the circle. But\r\nno sooner had she arrived than hysterically she screamed, \"You\r\ntold me when you wedded me that no wife would be my superior: now\r\nI am counted only a secondary consort.\" With that she hurled\r\nherself at the eldest wife who was occupying the post of honour\r\nand assailed her bitterly. Amidst the general confusion the would-\r\nbe-Emperor hastily descended from his Throne and vainly\r\nintervened, but the women were not to be parted until their robes\r\nwere in tatters.\r\n\r\nIn such childishnesses did Peking indulge when a great disaster\r\nwas preparing. To explain what had occurred in Yunnan it is\r\nnecessary to go back and tell the story of a remarkable young\r\nChinese-General Tsao-ao, the soul of the new revolt.\r\n\r\nIn the revolution of 1911 each province had acted on the\r\nassumption that it possessed inherent autonomous rights and could\r\nassume sovereignty as soon as local arrangements had allowed the\r\norganization of a complete provisional government. Yunnan had been\r\none of the earliest provinces to follow the lead of the Wu-chang\r\nrebels and had virtually erected itself into a separate republic,\r\nwhich attracted much attention because of the iron discipline\r\nwhich was preserved. Possessing a fairly well-organized military\r\nsystem, largely owing to the proximity of the French frontier and\r\nthe efforts which a succession of Viceroys had made to provide\r\nadequate frontier defence, it was amply able to guarantee its\r\nnewly won autonomy. General Tsao-ao, then in command of a division\r\nof troops had been elected Generalissimo of the province; and\r\nbending himself to his task in very few weeks he had driven into\r\nexile all officials who adhered to the Imperialist cause and made\r\nall local institutions completely self-supporting. Even in 1911 it\r\nhad been reported that this young man dreamed of founding a\r\ndynasty for himself in the mountains of South China--an ambition\r\nby no means impossible of realization since he had received a\r\nfirst-class military education in the Tokio Military Schools and\r\nwas thoroughly up-to-date and conversant with modern theories of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThese reports had at the time greatly concerned Yuan Shih-kai who\r\nheard it stated by all who knew him that the Yunnan leader was a\r\ngenius in his own way. In conformity with his policy of bringing\r\nto Peking all who might challenge his authority, he had induced\r\nGeneral Tsao-ao, since the latter had played no part in the\r\nrebellion of 1913, to lay down his office of Yunnan Governor-\r\nGeneral and join him in the capital at the beginning of 1914--\r\nanother high provincial appointment being held out to him as a\r\nbait.\r\n\r\nOnce in Peking, however, General Tsao-ao had been merely placed in\r\ncharge of an office concerned with the reorganization of the land-\r\ntax, nominally a very important piece of work long advocated by\r\nforeign critics. But as there were no funds available, and as the\r\npurpose was plainly merely to keep him under observation, he\r\nfretted at the restraint, and became engaged in secret political\r\ncorrespondence with men who had been exiled abroad. As he was soon\r\nan open suspect, in order to avoid arrest he had taken the bold\r\nstep at the very inception of the monarchy movement of heading the\r\nlist of Generals in residence in Peking who petitioned the Senate\r\nto institute a Monarchy, this act securing him against summary\r\ntreatment. But owing to his secret connection with the scholar\r\nLiang Chi-chao, who had thrown up his post of Minister of Justice\r\nand left the capital in order to oppose the new movement, he was\r\nwatched more and more carefully--his death being even hinted at.\r\n\r\nHe was clever enough to meet this ugly development with a masterly\r\npiece of trickery conceived in the Eastern vein. One day a\r\ncarefully arranged dispute took place between him and his wife,\r\nand the police were angrily called in to see that his family and\r\nall their belongings were taken away to Tientsin as he refused any\r\nlonger to share the same roof with them. Being now alone in the\r\ncapital, he apparently abandoned himself to a life of shameless\r\ndebauch, going nightly to the haunts of pleasure and becoming a\r\nnotorious figure in the great district in the Outer City of Peking\r\nwhich is filled with adventure and adventuresses and which is the\r\nlocality from which Haroun-Al Raschid obtained through the medium\r\nof Arab travellers his great story of \"Aladdin and the Wonderful\r\nLamp.\" When governmental suspicions were thoroughly lulled, he\r\narranged with a singing-girl to let him out by the backdoor of her\r\nhouse at dawn from whence he escaped to the railway-station,\r\nrapidly reaching Tientsin entirely unobserved.\r\n\r\nThe morning was well-advanced before the detectives who nightly\r\nwatched his movements became suspicious. Then finding that his\r\nwhereabouts were unknown to the coachman dozing on the box of his\r\ncarriage, they roughly entered the house where he had passed the\r\nnight only to find that the bird had flown. Hasty telegrams were\r\ndispatched in every direction, particularly to Tientsin--the great\r\ncentre for political refugees--and his summary arrest ordered.\r\nBut fortune favoured him. A bare quarter-of-an-hour before the\r\npolice began their search he had embarked with his family on a\r\nJapanese steamer lying in the Tientsin river and could snap his\r\nfingers at Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\nOnce in Japan he lost no time in assembling his revolutionary\r\nfriends and in a body they embarked for South China. As rapidly as\r\npossible he reached Yunnan province from Hongkong, travelling by\r\nway of the French Tonkin railway. Entering the province early in\r\nDecember he found everything fairly ready for revolt, though there\r\nwas a deficiency in arms and munitions which had to be made good.\r\nYuan Shih-kai, furious at this evasion, had telegraphed to\r\nconfidential agents in Yunnan to kill him at sight, but\r\nfortunately he was warned and spared to perform his important\r\nwork. Had a fortnight of grace been vouchsafed him, he would have\r\nprobably made the most brilliant modern campaign that has been\r\nwitnessed in China, for he was an excellent soldier. Acting from\r\nthe natural fortress of Yunnan it was his plan to descend suddenly\r\non the Yangtsze Valley by way of Chungking and to capture the\r\nupper river in one victorious march thus closing the vast province\r\nof Szechuan to the Northern troops. But circumstances had made it\r\nimperative for him and his friends to telegraph the Yunnan\r\nultimatum a fortnight sooner than it should have been dispatched,\r\nand the warning thus conveyed to the Central Government largely\r\ncrippled the Yunnan offensive.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which had made instant action necessary were as\r\nfollows. As we have seen from the record of the previous risings,\r\nthe region of the Yangtsze river has superlative value in Chinese\r\npolitics. Offering as it does an easy road into the heart of the\r\ncountry and touching more than half the Provinces, it is indeed a\r\npriceless means of communication, and for this reason Yuan Shih-\r\nkai had been careful after the crushing of the rebellion of 1913\r\nto load the river-towns with his troops under the command of\r\nGenerals he believed incorruptible. Chief of these was General\r\nFeng Kuo-chang at Nanking who held the balance of power on the\r\ngreat river, and whose politics, though not entirely above\r\nsuspicion, had been proof against all the tempting offers South\r\nChina made to him until the ill-fated monarchy movement had\r\ncommenced. But during this movement General Feng Kuo-chang had\r\nexpressed himself in such contemptuous terms of the would-be\r\nEmperor that orders had been given to another high official--\r\nAdmiral Tseng, Garrison Commissioner at Shanghai--to have him\r\nassassinated. Instead of obeying his instructions, Admiral Tseng\r\nhad conveyed a warning to his proposed victim, the consequence\r\nbeing that the unfortunate admiral was himself brutally murdered\r\non the streets of Shanghai by revolver-shots for betraying the\r\nconfidence of his master. After this denouement it was not very\r\nstrange that General Feng Kuo-chang should have intimated to the\r\nRepublican Party that as soon as they entered the Yangtsze Valley\r\nhe would throw his lot with them together with all his troops. Of\r\nthis Yuan Shih-kai became aware through his extraordinary system\r\nof intelligence; and following his usual practice he had ordered\r\nGeneral Feng Kuo-chang to Peking as Chief of the General Staff--an\r\nappointment which would place him under direct surveillance. First\r\non one excuse, then on another, General Feng Kuo-chang had managed\r\nto delay his departure from day to day without actually coming\r\nunder the grave charge of refusing to obey orders. But finally the\r\nposition was such that he telegraphed to General Tsao-ao that\r\nunless the Yunnan arrangements were hastened he would have to\r\nleave Nanking--and abandon this important centre to one of Yuan\r\nShih-kai's own henchmen--which meant the end of all hopes of the\r\nYangtsze Valley rising EN MASSE.\r\n\r\nIt was to save Feng Kuo-chang, then, that the young patriot Tsao-\r\nao caused the ultimatum to be dispatched fourteen days too soon\r\ni.e., before the Yunnan troops had marched over the mountain-\r\nbarrier into the neighbouring province of Szechuan and seized the\r\ncity of Chungking--which would have barred the advance of the\r\nNorthern troops permanently as the river defiles even when lightly\r\ndefended are impassable here to the strongest force. It was\r\nlargely due to the hardships of forced marches conducted over\r\nthese rugged mountains, which raise their precipitous peaks to the\r\nheavens, that Tsao-ao subsequently lost his life, his health being\r\nundermined by exposure, tuberculosis finally claiming him. But one\r\nthing at least did his resolute action secure. With Yunnan in open\r\nrevolt and several other provinces about to follow suit, General\r\nFeng Yuo-chang was able to telegraph Peking that it was impossible\r\nfor him to leave his post at Nanking without rebellion breaking\r\nout. This veiled threat was understood by Yuan Shih-kai. Grimly he\r\naccepted the checkmate.\r\n\r\nYet all the while he was acting with his customary energy. Troops\r\nwere dispatched towards Szechuan in great numbers, being tracked\r\nup the rapids of the upper river on board fleets of junks which\r\nwere ruthlessly commandeered. Now commenced an extraordinary race\r\nbetween the Yunnan mountaineers and the Northern plainsmen for the\r\nstrategic city of Chungking. For some weeks the result was in\r\ndoubt; for although Szechuan province was held by Northern\r\ngarrisons, they were relatively speaking weak and surrounded by\r\nhostile Szechuan troops whose politics were doubtful. In the end,\r\nhowever, Yuan Shih-kai's men reached their goal first and\r\nChungking was saved. Heavy and continuous mountain-fighting\r\nensued, in which the Southern troops were only partially\r\nsuccessful. Being less well-equipped in mountain artillery and\r\nless well-found in general supplies they were forced to rely\r\nlargely on guerilla warfare. There is little accurate record of\r\nthe desperate fighting which occurred in this wild region but it\r\nis known that the original Yunnan force was nearly annihilated,\r\nand that of the remnant numbers perished from disease and\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nOther events were, however, hastening the debacle. Kueichow\r\nprovince had almost at once followed the example of Yunnan. A\r\nthird province, Kwangsi, under a veteran who was much respected,\r\nGeneral Lu Yun Ting, was soon added; and gradually as in 1911 it\r\nbecame clear that the army was only one chessman in a complicated\r\nand very ingenious game.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\"THE THIRD REVOLUTION\" (Continued)\r\n\r\nTHE DOWNFALL AND DEATH OP YUAN SHIH-KAI\r\n\r\n\r\nAs had been the case during the previous revolts, it was not\r\npublicly or on the battlefield that the most crucial work was\r\nperformed: the decisive elements in this new and conclusive\r\nstruggle were marshalled behind the scenes and performed their\r\ntask unseen. Though the mandarinate, at the head of which stood\r\nYuan Shih-kai, left no stone unturned to save itself from its\r\nimpending fate, all was in vain. Slowly but inexorably it was\r\nshown that a final reckoning had to be faced.\r\n\r\nThe reasons are not far to seek. Too long had the moral sense of\r\neducated men been outraged by common fraud and deceit for any\r\ncontinuance of a regime which had disgraced China for four long\r\nyears to be humanly possible. Far and wide the word was rapidly\r\npassing that Yuan Shih-kai was not the man he had once been: he\r\nwas in reality feeble and choleric--prematurely old from too much\r\nhistory-making and too many hours spent in the harem. He had\r\nindeed become a mere Colossus with feet of clay,--a man who could\r\nbe hurled to the ground by precisely the same methods he had used\r\nto destroy the Manchus. Even his foreign supporters were becoming\r\ntired and suspicious of him, endless trouble being now associated\r\nwith his name, there being no promise that quieter times could\r\npossibly come so long as he lived. A very full comprehension of\r\nthe general position is given by perusing the valedictory letter\r\nof the leader of the Chinese intellectuals, that remarkable man--\r\nLiang Chi-ch'ao, who in December had silently and secretly fled\r\nfrom Tientsin on information reaching him that his assassination\r\nwas being planned. On the eve of his departure he had sent the\r\nfollowing brilliant document to the Emperor-elect as a reply to an\r\nattempt to entrap him to Peking, a document the meaning of which\r\nwas clear to every educated man. Its exquisite irony mixed with\r\nits bluntness told all that was necessary to tell--and forecasted\r\nthe inevitable fall. It runs:--\r\n\r\nFor the Kind Perusal of the Great President:--\r\n\r\nA respectful reading of your kind instructions reveals to me your\r\nmodesty and the brotherly love which you cherish for your humble\r\nservant, who is so moved by your heart-touching sympathy that he\r\ndoes not know how to return your kindness. A desire then seized\r\nhim to submit his humble views for your wise consideration; though\r\non the one hand he has thought that he might fail to express what\r\nhe wishes to say if he were to do so in a set of brief words,\r\nwhile on the other hand he has no desire to trouble the busy mind\r\nof one on whose shoulders fall myriads of affairs, with views\r\nexpressed in many words. Furthermore, what Ch'i-chao desires to\r\nsay relates to what can be likened to the anxiety of one who,\r\nfearing that the heavens may some day fall on him, strives to ward\r\noff the catastrophe. If his words should be misunderstood, it\r\nwould only increase his offence. Time and again he has essayed to\r\nwrite; but each time he has stopped short. Now he is going South\r\nto visit his parents; and looking at the Palace-Gate from afar, he\r\nrealizes that he is leaving the Capital indefinitely. The thought\r\nthat he has been a protege of the Great President and that dangers\r\nloom ahead before the nation as well as his sense of duty and\r\nfriendly obligations, charge him with the responsibility of saying\r\nsomething. He therefore begs to take the liberty of presenting his\r\nhumble but extravagant views for the kind consideration of the\r\nGreat President.\r\n\r\nThe problem of Kuo-ti (form of State) appears to have gone too far\r\nfor reconsideration: the position is like unto a man riding on the\r\nback of a wild tiger. ...Ch'i-chao therefore at one moment thought\r\nhe would say no more about it, since added comment thereon might\r\nmake him all the more open to suspicion. But a sober study of the\r\ngeneral situation and a quiet consideration of the possible future\r\nmake him tremble like an autumn leaf; for the more he meditates,\r\nthe more dangerous the situation appears. It is true that the\r\nminor trouble of \"foreign advice\" and rebel plotting can be\r\nsettled and guarded against; but what Ch'i-chao bitterly deplores\r\nis that the original intention of the Great President to devote\r\nhis life and energy to the interest of the country--an intention\r\nhe has fulfilled during the past four years--will be difficult to\r\nexplain to the world in future. The trust of the world in the\r\nGreat President would be shattered with the result that the\r\nfoundation of the country will be unsettled. Do not the Sages say:\r\n\"In dealing with the people aim at faithfulness?\" If faithfulness\r\nto promises be observed by those in authority, then the people\r\nwill naturally surrender themselves. Once, however, a promise is\r\nbroken, it will be as hard to win back the people's trust as to\r\nascend to the very Heavens. Several times have oaths of office\r\nbeen uttered; yet even before the lips are dry, action hath\r\nfalsified the words of promise. In these circumstances, how can\r\none hope to send forth his orders to the country in the future,\r\nand expect them to be obeyed? The people will say \"he started in\r\nrighteousness but ended in self-seeking: how can we trust our\r\nlives in his hands, if he should choose to pursue even further his\r\nlove of self-enrichment?\" It is possible for Ch'i-chao to believe\r\nthat the Great President has no desire to make profit for himself\r\nby the sacrifice of the country, but how can the mass of the\r\npeople--who believe only what they are told--understand what\r\nCh'i-chao may, perchance, believe?\r\n\r\nThe Great President sees no one but those who are always near him;\r\nand these are the people who have tried to win his favour and gain\r\nrewards by concocting the alleged unanimous petitions of the whole\r\ncountry urging his accession to the Throne. In reality, however,\r\nthe will of the people is precisely the opposite. Even the high\r\nofficials in the Capital talk about the matter in a jeering and\r\nsarcastic way. As for the tone of the newspapers outside Peking,\r\nthat is better left unmentioned. And as for the \"small people\" who\r\ncrowd the streets and the market-places, they go about as if\r\nsomething untoward might happen at any moment. If a kingdom can be\r\nmaintained by mere force, then the disturbance at the time of\r\nCh'in Chih-huang and Sui Yang Ti could not have been successful.\r\nIf, on the other hand, it is necessary to secure the co-operation\r\nand the willing submission of the hearts of the people, then is it\r\nnot time that our Great President bethinks himself and boldly\r\ntakes his own stand?\r\n\r\nSome argue that to hesitate in the middle of a course after\r\nindulging in much pomp and pageantry at the beginning will result\r\nin ridicule and derision and that the dignity of the Chief\r\nExecutive will be lowered. But do they even know whether the Great\r\nPresident has taken the least part in connection with the\r\nphantasies of the past four months? Do they know that the Great\r\nPresident has, on many occasions, sworn fidelity before high\r\nHeaven and the noon-day sun? Now if he carries out his sacrosanct\r\npromise and is deaf to the unrighteous advice of evil counsellors,\r\nhis high virtue will be made even more manifest than ever before.\r\nWherein then is there need of doubt or fear? Others may even\r\nsuggest that since the proposal was initiated by military men, the\r\ntie that has hitherto bound the latter to the Great President may\r\nbe snapped in case the pear fails to ripen. But in the humble\r\nopinion of Ch'i-chao, the troops are now all fully inspired with a\r\nsense of obedience to the Chief Executive. Who then can claim the\r\nright to drag our Great President into unrighteousness for the\r\nsake of vanity and vainglory? Who will dare disobey the behests of\r\nthe Great President if he should elect to open his heart and\r\nfollow the path of honour and unbroken vows? If today, as Head of\r\nthe nation, he is powerless to silence the riotous clamour of the\r\nsoldiery as happened at Chen-chiao in ancient time, then be sure\r\nin the capacity of an Emperor he will not be able to suppress an\r\noutbreak of troops even as it happened once at Yuyang in the Tang\r\ndynasty. [Footnote: The incident of Chen-chiao is very celebrated\r\nin Chinese annals. A yellow robe, the symbol of Imperial\r\nauthority, was thrown around General Chao Kuang-ying, at a place\r\ncalled Chen-chiao, by his soldiers and officers when he commanded\r\na force ordered to the front. Chao returned to the Capital\r\nimmediately to assume the Imperial Throne, and was thus\r\n\"compelled\" to become the founder of the famous Sung dynasty. The\r\n\"incident of Yuyang\" refers to the execution of Yang Kuei-fei, the\r\nfavourite concubine of Emperor Yuan Tsung of the Tang dynasty. The\r\nEmperor for a long time was under the alluring influence of Yang\r\nKuei-fei, who had a paramour named An Lo-hsan. The latter finally\r\nrebelled against the Emperor. The Emperor left the capital and\r\nproceeded to another place together with his favourite concubine,\r\nguarded by a large force of troops. Midway, however, the soldiers\r\nthreatened to rebel unless the concubine was killed on the spot.\r\nThe clamour was such that the Emperor was forced to sacrifice the\r\nfavourite of his harem, putting her to death in the presence of\r\nhis soldiers.] To give them the handle of the sword is simply\r\ncourting trouble for the future. But can we suspect the troops--\r\nso long trained under the Great President--of such unworthy\r\nconduct?\r\n\r\nThe ancients say \"However a thing is done, do not hurt the\r\nfeelings of those who love you, or let your enemy have a chance to\r\nrejoice.\" Recently calamities in the forms of drought and flood\r\nhave repeatedly visited China; and the ancients warn us that in\r\nsuch ways does Heaven manifest its Will regarding great movements\r\nin our country. In addition to these we must remember the\r\nprevailing evils of a corrupt officialdom, the incessant ravages\r\nof robbers, excesses in punishment, the unusually heavy burdens of\r\ntaxation, as well as the irregularity of weather and rain, which\r\nall go to increase the murmurs and complaints of the people.\r\nInternally, the rebels are accumulating strength against an\r\nopportune time to rise; externally, powerful neighbouring\r\ncountries are waiting for an opportunity to harass us. Why then\r\nshould our Great President risk his precious person and become a\r\ntarget of public criticism; or \"abandon the rock of peace in\r\nsearch of the tiger's tail\"; or discourage the loyalty of faithful\r\nones and encourage the sinister ambitions of the unscrupulous?\r\nCh'i-chao sincerely hopes that the Great President will devote\r\nhimself to the establishment of a new era which shall be an\r\ninspiration to heroism and thus escape the fate of those who are\r\nstigmatized in our annals with the name of Traitor. He hopes that\r\nthe renown of the Great President will long be remembered in the\r\nland of Chung Hua (China) and he prays that the fate of China may\r\nnot end with any abrupt ending that may befall the Great\r\nPresident. He therefore submits his views with a bleeding heart.\r\nHe realizes that his words may not win the approval of one who is\r\nwise and clever; but Ch'i-chao feels that unless he unburdens what\r\nis in his heart, he will be false to the duty which bids him speak\r\nand be true to the kindness that has been showered on him by the\r\nGreat President. Whether his loyalty to the Imperative Word will\r\nbe rewarded with approval or with reproof, the order of the Great\r\nPresident will say.\r\n\r\nThere are other words of which Ch'i-chao wishes to tender to the\r\nGreat President. To be an independent nation today, we must need\r\nfollow the ways of the present age. One who opposes the current of\r\nthe world and protects himself against the enriching influence of\r\nthe world-spirit must eventually share the fate of the unselected.\r\nIt is sincerely hoped that the Great President will refrain to\r\nsome extent from restoring the old and withal work for real\r\nreform. Law can only be made a living force by both the ruler and\r\nthe people obeying it with sincerity. When the law loses its\r\nstrength, the people will not know how to act; and then the\r\ndignity of Government will disappear. It is hoped that the Great\r\nPresident will keep himself within the bounds of law and not lead\r\nthe officials and the people to juggle with words. Participation\r\nin politics and patriotism are closely related. Bear well in mind\r\nthat it is impossible to expect the people to share the\r\nresponsibilities of the country, unless they are given a voice in\r\nthe transaction of public business. The hope is expressed that the\r\nGreat President will establish a real organ representing the true\r\nwill of the people and encourage the natural growth of the free\r\nexpression of public opinion. Let us not become so arrogant and\r\noppressive that the people will have no chance to express their\r\nviews, as this may inspire hatred on the part of the people. The\r\nrelation between the Central Government and the provincial centres\r\nis like that between the trunk and branches of a tree. If the\r\nbranches are all withered, how can the trunk continue to grow? It\r\nis hoped that the Great President, while giving due consideration\r\nto the maintenance of the dignity of the Central Government, will\r\nat the same time allow the local life of the provinces to develop.\r\nEthics, Righteousness, Purity and Conscientiousness are four great\r\nprinciples. When these four principles are neglected, a country\r\ndies. If the whole country should come in spirit to be like\r\n\"concubines and women,\" weak and open to be coerced and forced\r\nalong with whomsoever be on the stronger side, how can a State be\r\nestablished? May the Great President encourage principle, and\r\nvirtue, stimulate purity of character, reject men of covetous and\r\nmean character, and grant wise tolerance to those who know no fear\r\nin defending the right. Only then will the vitality of the country\r\nbe retained in some degree; and in time of emergency, there will\r\nbe a reserve of strength to be drawn upon in support of the State.\r\nAll these considerations are of the order of obvious truths and it\r\nmust be assumed that the Great President, who is greatly wise, is\r\nnot unaware of the same. The reason why Ch'i-chao ventures to\r\nrepeat them is this. He holds it true that a duty is laid on him\r\nto submit whatever humble thoughts are his, and at the same time\r\nhe believes that the Great President will not condemn a proper\r\nphysic even though it may be cheap and simple. How fortunate will\r\nCh'i-chao be if advice so tendered shall meet with approval. He is\r\nproceeding farther and farther away from the Palace every day and\r\nhe does not know how soon he will be able to seek an audience\r\nagain. He writes these words with tears dropping into the ink-slab\r\nand he trusts that his words may receive the attention of the\r\nGreat President.\r\n\r\nSo ends this remarkable missive which has become an historic\r\ndocument in the archives of the Republic. Once again it was\r\nwhispered that so great an impression did this fateful warning\r\nproduce on the Emperor-elect that he was within an ace of\r\ncancelling the disastrous scheme which now enmeshed him. But in\r\nthe end family influence won the day; and stubbornly and doggedly\r\nthe doomed man pushed on with his attempt to crush revolt and\r\nconsolidate his crumbling position.\r\n\r\nEvery possible effort was made to minimize the effect of\r\ninternational influence on the situation. As the sycophantic\r\nvernacular press of the capital, long drilled to blind\r\nsubservience, had begun to speak of his enthronement as a\r\ncertainty on the 9th February, a Circular Note was sent to the\r\nFive Allied Powers that no such date had been fixed, and that the\r\nnewspaper reports to that effect were inventions. In order\r\nspecially to conciliate Japan, a high official was appointed to\r\nproceed on an Embassy to Tokio to grant special industrial\r\nconcessions--a manoeuvre which was met with the official refusal\r\nof the Tokio Government to be so placated. Peking was coldly\r\ninformed that owing to \"court engagements\" it would be impossible\r\nfor the Emperor of Japan to receive any Chinese Mission. After\r\nthis open rebuff attention was concentrated on \"the punitive\r\nexpedition\" to chastise the disaffected South, 80,000 men being\r\nput in the field and a reserve of 80,000 mobilized behind them. An\r\nattempt was also made to win over waverers by an indiscriminate\r\ndistribution of patents of nobility. Princes, Dukes, Marquises,\r\nViscounts and Barons were created in great batches overnight only\r\nto be declined in very many cases, one of the most precious\r\npossessions of the Chinese race being its sense of humour. Every\r\none, or almost every one, knew that the new patents were not worth\r\nthe paper they were written on, and that in future years the\r\nmembers of this spurious nobility would be exposed to something\r\nworse than contempt. France was invited to close the Tonkin\r\nfrontier, but this request also met with a rebuff, and\r\nrevolutionists and arms were conveyed in an ever-more menacing\r\nmanner into the revolted province of Yunnan by the French\r\nrailways. A Princedom was at length conferred on Lung Chi Kwang,\r\nthe Military Governor of Canton, Canton being a pivotal point and\r\nLung Chi Kwang, one of the most cold-blooded murderers in China,\r\nin the hope that this would spur him to such an orgy of crime that\r\nthe South would be crushed. Precisely the opposite occurred, since\r\neven murderers are able to read the signs of the times. Attempts\r\nwere likewise made to enforce the use of the new Imperial\r\nCalendar, but little success crowned such efforts, no one outside\r\nthe metropolis believing for a moment that this innovation\r\npossessed any of the elements of permanence. Meanwhile the\r\nmonetary position steadily worsened, the lack of money becoming so\r\nmarked as to spread panic. Still, in spite of this, the leaders\r\nrefused to take warning, and although the political impasse was\r\nconstantly discussed, the utmost concession the monarchists were\r\nwilling to make was to turn China into a Federal Empire with the\r\nprovinces constituted into self-governing units. The over-issue of\r\npaper currency to make good the gaps in the National Finance, now\r\nslowly destroyed the credit of the Central Government and made the\r\nsuspension of specie payment a mere matter of time. By the end of\r\nFebruary the province of Kueichow was not only officially admitted\r\nby the Peking Government to be in open revolt as well as Yunnan,\r\nbut rebel troops were reported to be invading the neighbouring\r\nprovince of Hunan. Kwangsi was also reported to be preparing for\r\nsecession whilst in Szechuan local troops were revolting in\r\nincreasing numbers. Rumours of an attempted assassination of Yuan\r\nShih-kai by means of bombs now circulated,--and there were many\r\narrests and suicides in the capital. Though by a mandate issued on\r\nthe 23rd February, the enthronement ceremony was indefinitely\r\npostponed, that move came too late. The whole country was plainly\r\ntrembling on the edge of a huge outbreak when, less than four\r\nweeks later, Yuan Shih-kai reluctantly and publicly admitted that\r\nthe game was up. It is understood that a fateful interview he had\r\nwith the British Minister greatly influenced him, though the\r\nformal declaration of independence of Kwangsi on the 16th March,\r\nwhither the scholar Liang Ch'i-chao had gone, was also a powerful\r\nargument. On the 22nd March the Emperor-elect issued the mandate\r\ncategorically cancelling the entire monarchy scheme, it being\r\ndeclared that he would now form a Responsible Cabinet. Until that\r\ndate the Government Gazette had actually perpetrated the folly of\r\npublishing side by side Imperial Edicts and Presidential Mandates\r\n--the first for Chinese eyes, the second for foreign consumption.\r\nNever before even in China had such a farce been seen. A rapid\r\nperusal of the Mandate of Cancellation will show how lamely and\r\npoorly the retreat is made:\r\n\r\nDECREE CANCELLING THE EMPIRE (22D MARCH)\r\n\r\nAfter the establishment of the Min Kuo (i.e. the Republic),\r\ndisturbances rapidly followed one another; and a man of little\r\nvirtue like me was called to take up the vast burden of the State.\r\nFearing that disaster might befall us any day, all those who had\r\nthe welfare of the country at heart advocated the reinstitution of\r\nthe monarchical system of government to the end that a stop be put\r\nto all strife for power and a regime of peace be inaugurated.\r\nSuggestions in this sense have unceasingly been made to me since\r\nthe days of Kuei Chou (the year of the first Revolution, 1911) and\r\neach time a sharp rebuke has been administered to the one making\r\nthe suggestion. But the situation last year was indeed so\r\ndifferent from the circumstances of preceding years that it was\r\nimpossible to prevent the spread of such ideas.\r\n\r\nIt was said that China could never hope to continue as a nation\r\nunless the constitutional monarchical form of state were adopted;\r\nand if quarrels like those occurring in Mexico and Portugal were\r\nto take place in China, we would soon share the fate of Annam and\r\nBurmah. A large number of people then advocated the restoration of\r\na monarchy and advanced arguments which were reasonable. In this\r\nproposal all the military and civil officials, scholars and people\r\nconcurred; and prayers were addressed to me in most earnest tone\r\nby telegram and in petitions. Owing to the position I was at the\r\ntime holding, which laid on me the duty of maintaining the then\r\nexisting situation, I repeatedly made declarations resisting the\r\nadoption of the advice; but the people did not seem to realize my\r\nembarrassment. And so it was decided by the acting Li Fa Yuan\r\n(i.e. the Senate) that the question of Kuo-ti (form of State)\r\nshould be settled by the Convention of Citizens' Representatives.\r\nAs the result, the representatives of the Provinces and of the\r\nSpecial Administrative Areas unanimously decided in favour of a\r\nconstitutional monarchy, and in one united voice elected me as the\r\nEmperor. Since the sovereignty of the country has been vested in\r\nthe citizens of China and as the decision was made by the entire\r\nbody of the representatives, there was no room left to me for\r\nfurther discussion. Nevertheless, I continued to be of the\r\nconviction that my sudden elevation to the Great Seat would be a\r\nviolation of my oath and would compromise my good faith, leaving\r\nme unable to explain myself; I, therefore, declined in earnest\r\nwords in order to make clear the view which hath always been mine.\r\nThe said Senate however, stated with firmness that the oath of the\r\nChief Executive rested on a peculiar sanction and should be\r\nobserved or discarded according to the will of the people. Their\r\narguments were so irresistible that there was in truth no excuse\r\nfor me further to decline the offer.\r\n\r\nTherefore I took refuge behind the excuse of \"preparations\" in\r\norder that the desire of the people might be satisfied. But I took\r\nno steps actually to carry out the program. When the trouble in\r\nYunnan and Kueichow arose, a mandate was officially issued\r\nannouncing the decision to postpone the measure and forbidding\r\nfurther presentation of petitions praying for the enthronement. I\r\nthen hastened the convocation of the Li Fa Yuan (i.e., a new\r\nParliament) in order to secure the views of that body and hoping\r\nthus to turn back to the original state of affairs, I, being a man\r\nof bitter experiences, had at once given up all ideas of world\r\naffairs; and having retired into the obscurity of the river Yuan\r\n(in Honan), I had no appetite for the political affairs of the\r\ncountry. As the result of the revolution in Hsin Hai, I was by\r\nmistake elected by the people. Reluctantly I came out of my\r\nretirement and endeavoured to prop up the tottering structure. I\r\ncared for nothing, but the salvation of the country. A perusal of\r\nour history of several thousand years will reveal in vivid manner\r\nthe sad fate of the descendants of ancient kings and emperors.\r\nWhat then could have prompted me to aspire to the Throne? Yet\r\nwhile the representatives of the people were unwilling to believe\r\nin the sincerity of my refusal of the offer, a section of the\r\npeople appear to have suspected me of harbouring the desire of\r\ngaining more power and privileges. Such difference in thought has\r\nresulted in the creation of an exceedingly dangerous situation. As\r\nmy sincerity has not been such as to win the hearts of the people\r\nand my judgment has not been sound enough to appraise every man, I\r\nhave myself alone to blame for lack of virtue. Why then should I\r\nblame others? The people have been thrown into misery and my\r\nsoldiers have been made to bear hardships; and further the people\r\nhave been cast into panic and commerce has rapidly declined. When\r\nI search my own heart a measure of sorrow fills it. I shall,\r\ntherefore, not be unwilling to suppress myself in order to yield\r\nto others.\r\n\r\nI am still of the opinion that the \"designation petitions\"\r\nsubmitted through the Tsan Cheng Yuan are unsuited to the demands\r\nof the time; and the official acceptance of the Imperial Throne\r\nmade on the 11th day of the 12th month of last year (11th\r\nDecember, 1915) is hereby cancelled. The \"designation petitions\"\r\nof the Provinces and of the Special Administrative Areas are\r\nhereby all returned through the State Department to the Tsan Cheng\r\nYuan, i.e., the acting Li Fa Yuan (Parliament), to be forwarded to\r\nthe petitioners for destruction; and all the preparations\r\nconnected therewith are to cease at once. In this wise I hope to\r\nimitate the sincerity of the Ancients by taking on myself all the\r\nblame so that my action may fall in line with the spirit of\r\nhumanity which is the expression of the will of Heaven. I now\r\ncleanse my heart and wash my thoughts to the end that trouble may\r\nbe averted and the people may have peace. Those who advocated the\r\nmonarchical system were prompted by the desire to strengthen the\r\nfoundation of the country; but as their methods have proved\r\nunsuitable their patriotism might harm the country. Those who have\r\nopposed the monarchy have done so out of their desire to express\r\ntheir political views. It may be therefore presumed that they\r\nwould not go to the extreme and so endanger the country. They\r\nshould, therefore, all hearken to the voice of their own\r\nconscience and sacrifice their prejudices, and with one mind and\r\none purpose unite in the effort of saving the situation so that\r\nthe glorious descendants of the Sacred Continent may be spared the\r\nhorrors of internal warfare and the bad omens may be changed into\r\nlucky signs.\r\n\r\nIn brief I now confess that all the faults of the country are the\r\nresult of my own faults. Now that the acceptance of the Imperial\r\nThrone has been cancelled every man will be responsible for his\r\nown action if he further disturbs the peace of the locality and\r\nthus give an opportunity to others. I, the Great President, being\r\ncharged with the duty of ruling over the whole country, cannot\r\nremain idle while the country is racing to perdition. At the\r\npresent moment the homesteads are in misery, discipline has been\r\ndisregarded, administration is being neglected and real talents\r\nhave not been given a chance. When I think of such conditions I\r\nawake in the darkness of midnight. How can we stand as a nation if\r\nsuch a state of affairs is allowed to continue? Hereafter all\r\nofficials should thoroughly get rid of their corrupt habits and\r\nendeavour to achieve merits. They should work with might and main\r\nin their duties, whether in introducing reforms or in abolishing\r\nold corruptions. Let all be not satisfied with empty words and\r\nentertain no bias regarding any affair. They should hold up as\r\ntheir main principle of administration the policy that only\r\nreality will count and deal out reward or punishment with strict\r\npromptness. Let all our generals, officials, soldiers and people\r\nall, all, act in accordance with this ideal.\r\n\r\nThis attempt at an Amende honourable, so far from being well-\r\nreceived, was universally looked upon as an admission that Yuan\r\nShih-kai had almost been beaten and that a little more would\r\ncomplete his ruin. Though, as we have said, the Northern troops\r\nwere fighting well in his cause on the upper reaches of the great\r\nYangtsze, the movement against him was now spreading as though it\r\nhad been a dread contagious disease, the entire South uniting\r\nagainst Peking. His promise to open a proper Legislative Chamber\r\non 1st May was met with derision. By the middle of April five\r\nprovinces--Yunnan, Kueichow, Kwangsi, Kwangtung and Chekiang--had\r\ndeclared their independence, and eight others were preparing to\r\nfollow suit. A Southern Confederacy, with a Supreme Military\r\nCouncil sitting at Canton, was organized, the brutal Governor Lung\r\nChi Kwang having been won over against his master, and the scholar\r\nLiang Ch'i-chao flitting from place to place, inspiring move after\r\nmove. The old parliament of 1913 was reported to be assembling in\r\nShanghai, whilst terrorist methods against Peking officials were\r\nbruited abroad precipitating a panic in the capital and leading to\r\nan exodus of well-to-do families who feared a general massacre.\r\n\r\nAn open agitation to secure Yuan Shih-kai's complete retirement\r\nand exile now commenced. From every quarter notables began\r\ntelegraphing him that he must go,--including General Feng Kuo-\r\nchang who still held the balance of power on the Yangtsze. Every\r\nenemy Yuan Shih-kai had ever had was also racing back to China\r\nfrom exile. By the beginning of May the situation was so\r\nthreatening that the Foreign Legations became alarmed and talked\r\nof concerting measures to insure their safety. On the 6th May came\r\nthe coup de grace. The great province of Szechuan, which has a\r\npopulation greater than the population of France, declared its\r\nindependence; and the whole Northern army on the upper reaches of\r\nthe Yangtsze was caught in a trap. The story is still told with\r\nbated breath of the terrible manner in which Yuan Shih-kai sated\r\nhis rage when this news reached him--Szechuan being governed by a\r\nman he had hitherto thoroughly trusted--one General Chen Yi.\r\nArming himself with a sword and beside himself with rage he burst\r\ninto the room where his favourite concubine was lying with her\r\nnewly-delivered baby. With a few savage blows he butchered them\r\nboth, leaving them lying in their gore, thus relieving the\r\napoplectic stroke which threatened to overwhelm him. Nothing\r\nbetter illustrates the real nature of the man who had been so long\r\nthe selected bailiff of the Powers. On the 12th May it became\r\nnecessary to suspend specie payment in Peking, the government\r\nbanks having scarcely a dollar of silver left, a last attempt to\r\nnegotiate a loan in America having failed. Meanwhile under\r\ninspiration of General Feng Kuo-chang, a conference to deal with\r\nthe situation was assembling at Nanking; but on the 11th May, the\r\nCanton Military Government, representing the Southern Confederacy,\r\nhad already unanimously elected Vice-President Li Yuan Hung as\r\npresident of the Republic, it being held that legally Yuan Shih-\r\nkai had ceased to be President when he had accepted the Throne on\r\nthe previous 13th December. The Vice-President, who had managed to\r\nremove his residence outside the Palace, had already received\r\nfriendly offers of protection from certain Powers which he\r\ndeclined, showing courage to the end. Even the Nanking Conference,\r\nthough composed of trimmers and wobblers, decided that the\r\nretirement of Yuan Shih-kai was a political necessity, General\r\nFeng Kuo-chang as chairman of the Conference producing at the last\r\nmoment a telegram from the fallen Dictator declaring that he was\r\nwilling to go if his life and property were guaranteed.\r\n\r\nA more dramatic collapse was, however, in store. As May drew to an\r\nend it was plain that there was no government at all left in\r\nPeking. The last phase had been truly reached. Yuan Shih-kai's\r\nnervous collapse was known to all the Legations which were\r\nexceedingly anxious about the possibility of a soldiers' revolt in\r\nthe capital. The arrival of a first detachment of the savage\r\nhordes of General Chang Hsun added Byzantine touches to a picture\r\nalready lurid with a sickened ruler and the Mephistophelian figure\r\nof that ruler's ame damnee, the Secretary Liang Shih-yi, vainly\r\nstriving to transmute paper into silver, and find the wherewithal\r\nto prevent a sack of the capital. It was said at the time that\r\nLiang Shih-yi had won over his master to trying one last throw of\r\nthe dice. The troops of the remaining loyal Generals, such as Ni\r\nShih-chung of Anhui, were transported up the Yangtsze in an\r\nattempt to restore the situation by a savage display,--but that\r\neffort came to nought.\r\n\r\nThe situation had become truly appalling in Peking. It was even\r\nsaid that the neighbouring province of Shantung was to become a\r\nseparate state under Japanese protection. Although the Peking\r\nadministration was still nominally the Central Government of\r\nChina, it was amply clear to observers on the spot that by a\r\nprocess of successive collapses all that was left of government\r\nwas simply that pertaining to a city-state of the antique Greek\r\ntype--a mal-administration dominated by the enigmatic personality\r\nof Liang Shih-yi. The writ of the capital no longer ran more than\r\nten miles beyond the city walls. The very Government Departments,\r\ndisgusted with, and distrustful of, the many hidden influences at\r\nwork, had virtually declared their independence and went their own\r\nway, demanding foreign dollars and foreign banknotes from the\r\npublic, and refusing all Chinese money. The fine residium of\r\nundisputed power left in the hands of the Mal-administrator-in-\r\nChief, Liang Shih-yi, was the control of the copper cash market\r\nwhich he busily juggled with to the very end netting a few last\r\nthousands for his own purse, and showing that men like water\r\ninevitably find their true level. In all China's tribulations\r\nnothing similar had ever been seen. Even in 1900, after the Boxer\r\nbubble had been pricked and the Court had sought safety in flight,\r\nthere was a certain dignity and majesty left. Then an immense\r\nmisfortune had fallen across the capital; but that misfortune was\r\nlike a cloak which hid the nakedness of the victim; and there was\r\nat least no pretence at authority. In the Summer of 1916, had it\r\nnot been for the fact that an admirable police and gendarmerie\r\nsystem, comprising 16,000 men, secured the safety of the people,\r\nthere can be little doubt that firing and looting would have daily\r\ntaken place and no woman been safe. It was the last phase of\r\npolitical collapse with a vengeance: and small wonder if all\r\nChinese officials, including even high police officers, sent their\r\nvaluables either out of the city or into the Legation Quarter for\r\nsafe custody. Extraordinary rumours circulated endlessly among the\r\ncommon people that there would be great trouble on the occasion of\r\nthe Dragon Festival, the 5th June; and what actually took place\r\nwas perhaps more than a coincidence.\r\n\r\nEarly on the 6th June an electric thrill ran through Peking--Yuan\r\nShih-kai was dead! At first the news was not believed, but by\r\neleven o'clock it was definitely known in the Legation Quarter\r\nthat he had died a few minutes after ten o'clock that morning from\r\nuraemia of the blood--the surgeon of the French Legation being in\r\nattendance almost to the last. A certificate issued later by this\r\ngentleman immediately quieted the rumours of suicide, though many\r\nstill refused to believe that he was actually dead. \"I did not\r\nwish this end,\" he is reported to have whispered hoarsely a few\r\nminutes before he expired, \"I did not wish to be Emperor. Those\r\naround me said that the people wanted a king and named me for the\r\nThrone. I believed and was misled.\" And in this way did his light\r\nflicker out. If there are sermons in stones and books in the\r\nrunning brooks surely there is an eloquent lesson in this tragedy!\r\nBefore expiring the wretched man issued the following Death\r\nMandate in accordance with the ancient tradition, attempting as\r\nthe long night fell on him to make his peace with men:--\r\n\r\nLAST MANDATE OF YUAN SHIH-KAI\r\n\r\nThe Min Kuo has been established for five years. Unworthily have\r\nI, the Great President, been entrusted with the great task by the\r\ncitizens. Owing to my lack of virtue and ability I have not been\r\nable fully to transform into deeds what I have desired to\r\naccomplish; and I blush to say that I have not realized one ten-\r\nthousandth part of my original intention to save the country and\r\nthe people. I have, since my assumption of the office, worked in\r\nday and thought in the night, planning for the country. It is true\r\nthat the foundation of the country is not yet consolidated, the\r\nhardships of the people not yet relieved, and innumerable reforms\r\nare still unattended to. But by the valuable services of the civil\r\nofficials and militarymen, some semblance of peace and order has\r\nbeen maintained in the provinces and friendly relations with the\r\nPowers upheld till now.\r\n\r\nWhile on the one hand I comfort myself with such things\r\naccomplished, on the other hand I have much to blame myself for. I\r\nwas just thinking how I could retire into private life and rest\r\nmyself in the forest and near the springs in fulfilment of my\r\noriginal desire, when illness has suddenly overtaken me. As the\r\naffairs of the State are of gravest importance, the right man must\r\nbe secured to take over charge of the same. In accordance with\r\nArticle 29 of the Provisional Constitution, which states that in\r\ncase the office of the Great President should be vacated for\r\ncertain reasons or when the Great President is incapacitated from\r\ndoing his duties, the Vice-President shall exercise authority and\r\npower in his stead. I, the Great President, declare in accordance\r\nwith the Provisional Constitution that the Vice-President shall\r\nexercise in an acting capacity, the authority and power of the\r\nGreat President of the Chung Hua Min Kuo.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-President being a man of courtesy, good nature,\r\nbenevolence and wisdom, will certainly be capable of greatly\r\nlessening the difficulties of the day and place the country on the\r\nfoundation of peace, and so remedy the defects of me, the Great\r\nPresident, and satisfy the expectations of the people of the whole\r\ncountry. The civil and military officials outside of the Capital\r\nas well as the troops, police and scholars and people should\r\ndoubly keep in mind the difficulties and perils of the nation, and\r\nendeavour to maintain peace and order to the best of their\r\nability, placing before everything else the welfare of the\r\ncountry. The ancients once said: \"It is only when the living do\r\ntry to become strong that the dead are not dead.\" This is also the\r\nwish of me, the Great President.\r\n\r\n(Signed) TUAN CHI-JUI, Secretary of State and Minister of War,\r\nTSAO JU-LIN, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Communications.\r\n\r\nWANG YI-TANG, Minister of Interior.\r\n\r\nCHOW TZU-CHI, Minister of Finance.\r\n\r\nLIU-KUAN-HSIUNG, Minister of Navy.\r\n\r\nCHANG TSUNG-HSIANG, Minister of Justice and Agriculture and\r\nCommerce.\r\n\r\nCHANG KUO-KAN, Minister of Education.\r\n\r\n6th day of the 6th month of the 5th year of Chung Hua Min Kuo.\r\n\r\nThis tragic denouement did not fail to awaken within very few days\r\namong thinking minds a feeling of profound sympathy for the dead\r\nman coupled with sharp disgust for the part that foreigners had\r\nplayed--not all, of course--but a great number of them. Briefly,\r\nwhen all the facts are properly grouped it can be said that Yuan\r\nShih-kai was killed by his foreign friends--by the sort of advice\r\nhe has been consistently given in Constitutional Law, in Finance,\r\nin Politics, in Diplomacy. It is easy to trace step by step the\r\nbroad road he had been tempted to travel, and to see how at each\r\nturning-point the men who should have taught him how to be true\r\nand loyal to the Western things the country had nominally adhered\r\nto from the proclamation of the Republic, showed him how to be\r\ndisloyal and untrue. The tragedy is one which is bound to be\r\ndeeply studied throughout the whole world when the facts are\r\nproperly known and there is time to think about them, and if there\r\nis anything today left to poetic justice the West will know to\r\nwhom to apportion the blame.\r\n\r\nYuan Shih-kai, the man, when he came out of retirement in 1911,\r\nwas in many ways a wonderful Chinese: he was a fount of energy and\r\nof a physical sturdiness rare in a country whose governing classes\r\nhave hitherto been recruited from attenuated men, pale from study\r\nand the lotus life. He had a certain task to which to put his\r\nhand, a huge task, indeed, since the reformation of four hundred\r\nmillions was involved, yet one which was not beyond him if wisely\r\nadvised. He was an ignorant man in certain matters, but he had had\r\nmuch political experience and apparently possessed a marvellous\r\naptitude for learning. The people needed a leader to guide them\r\nthrough the great gateway of the West, to help them to acquire\r\nthose jewels of wisdom and experience which are a common heritage.\r\nAn almost Elizabethan eagerness rilled them, as if a New World\r\nthey had never dreamed of had been suddenly discovered for them\r\nand lay open to their endeavours. China, hitherto derided as a\r\ndecaying land, had been born anew; and in single massive gesture\r\nhad proclaimed that she, too, would belong to the elect and be\r\ngoverned accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhat was the foreign response--the official response? In every\r\ntransaction into which it was possible to import them, reaction\r\nand obscurantism were not only commonly employed but heartily\r\nrecommended. Not one trace of genuine statesmanship, not one flash\r\nof altruism, was ever seen save the American flash in the pan of\r\n1913, when President Wilson refused to allow American\r\nparticipation in the great Reorganization Loan because he held\r\nthat the terms on which it was to be granted infringed upon\r\nChina's sovereign rights. Otherwise there was nothing but a tacit\r\nendorsement of the very policy which has been tearing the entrails\r\nout of Europe--namely militarism. That was the fine fruit which\r\nwas offered to a hopeful nation--something that would wither on\r\nthe branch or poison the people as they plucked it. They were\r\ntaught to believe that political instinct was the ability to\r\nmisrepresent in a convincing way the actions and arguments of your\r\nopponents and to profit by their mistakes--not that it is a mighty\r\nimpulse which can re-make nations. The Republic was declared by\r\nthe actions of Western bureaucrats to be a Republic pour rire, not\r\na serious thing; and by this false and cruel assumption they\r\nkilled Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\nIf that epitaph is written on his political tombstone, it will be\r\nas full of blinding truth as is only possible with Last Things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE NEW REGIME,--FROM 1916 TO 1917\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin an hour of the death of Yuan Shih-kai, the veteran General\r\nTuan Chi-jui, in his capacity of Secretary of State, had called on\r\nVice-President Li Yuan-hung--the man whom years before he had\r\nbeen sent to the Yangtsze to bring captive to Peking--and welcomed\r\nhim as President of the Republic. At one o'clock on the same day\r\nthe Ministers of the Allied Powers who had hastily assembled at\r\nthe Waichiaopu (Foreign Office), were informed that General Li\r\nYuan-hung had duly assumed office and that the peace and security\r\nof the capital were fully guaranteed. No unrest of any sort need\r\nbe apprehended; for whilst rumours would no doubt circulate wildly\r\nas soon as the populace realized the tragic nature of the climax\r\nwhich had come, the Gendarmerie Corps and the Metropolitan Police\r\n--two forces that numbered 18,000 armed men--were taking every\r\npossible precaution.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these assurances great uneasiness was felt. The\r\nforeign Legations, which are very imperfectly informed regarding\r\nChinese affairs although living in the midst of them, could not be\r\nconvinced that internal peace could be so suddenly attained after\r\nfive years of such fierce rivalries. Among the many gloomy\r\npredictions made at the time, the most common to fall from the\r\nlips of Foreign Plenipotentiaries was the remark that the Japanese\r\nwould be in full occupation of the country within three months--\r\nthe one effective barrier to their advance having been removed. No\r\nbetter illustration could be given of the inadequate grasp of\r\npolitics possessed by those whose peculiar business it should be\r\nto become expert in the science of cause and effect. In China, as\r\nin the Balkans, professional diplomacy errs so constantly because\r\nit has in the main neither the desire nor the training to study\r\ndispassionately from day to day all those complex phenomena which\r\ngo to make up modern nationalism. Guided in its conduct almost\r\nentirely by a policy of personal predilections, which is fitfully\r\nreinforced by the recollection of precedents, it is small wonder\r\nif such mountains of mistakes choke every Legation dossier.\r\nDetermined to having nothing whatever to do, save in the last\r\nresort, with anything that savours of Radicalism, and inclining\r\nnaturally towards ideals which have long been abandoned in the\r\nworkaday world, diplomacy is the instinctive lover of obscurantism\r\nand the furtive enemy of progress. Distrusting all those generous\r\nmovements which spring from the popular desire to benefit by\r\nchange, it follows from this that the diplomatic brotherhood\r\ninclines towards those truly detestable things--secret compacts.\r\nIn the present instance, having been bitterly disappointed by the\r\ncomplete collapse of the strong man theory, it was only natural\r\nthat consolation should be sought by casting doubt on the future.\r\nNever have sensible men been so absurd. The life-story of Yuan\r\nShih-kai, and the part European and Japanese diplomacy played in\r\nthat story, form a chapter which should be taught as a warning to\r\nall who enter politics as a career, since there is exhibited in\r\nthis history a complete compendium of all the more vicious traits\r\nof Byzantinism.\r\n\r\nThe first acts of President Li Yuan-hung rapidly restored\r\nconfidence and advertised to the keen-eyed that the end of the\r\nlong drawn-out Revolution had come. Calling before him all the\r\ngenerals in the capital, he told them with sincerity and\r\nsimplicity that their country's fortunes rested in their hands;\r\nand he asked them to take such steps as would be in the nature of\r\na permanent insurance against foreign interference in the affairs\r\nof the Republic. He was at once given fervent support. A mass\r\nmeeting of the military was followed by the whole body of\r\ncommissioned men volunteering to hold themselves personally\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of peace and order in the capital.\r\nThe dreadful disorders which had ushered in the Yuan Shih-kai\r\nregime were thus made impossible; and almost at once men went\r\nabout their business as usual.\r\n\r\nThe financial wreckage left by the mad monarchy adventure was,\r\nhowever, appalling. Not only was there no money in the capital but\r\nhardly any food as well; for since the suspension of specie\r\npayments country supplies had ceased entering the city as farmers\r\nrefused to accept inconvertible paper in payment for their\r\nproduce. It became necessary for the government to sell at a\r\nnominal price the enormous quantities of grain which had been\r\naccumulated for the army and the punitive expedition against the\r\nSouth; and for many days a familiar sight was the endless blue-\r\ncoated queues waiting patiently to receive as in war-time their\r\nstipulated pittance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, although the troops remained loyal to the new regime,\r\nnot so the monarchist politicians. Seeing that their hour of\r\nobliteration had come, they spared no effort to sow secret\r\ndissensions and prevent the provinces from uniting again with\r\nPeking. It would be wearisome to give in full detail the\r\ninnumerable schemes which were now hourly formulated, to secure\r\nthat the control of the country should not be exercised in a\r\nlawful way. Finding that it was impossible to conquer the general\r\ndetestation felt for them, the monarchists, led by Liang Shih-yi,\r\nchanged their tactics and exhausted themselves in attempting to\r\nsecure the issue of a general annesty decree. But in spite of\r\nevery argument President Li Yuan-hung remained unmoved and refused\r\nabsolutely to consider their pardon. A just and merciful man, it\r\nwas his intention to allow the nation to speak its mind before\r\nissuing orders on the subject; but to show that he was no advocate\r\nof the terrorist methods practised by his predecessor, he now\r\nissued a Mandate summarily abolishing the infamous Chih Fa Chu, or\r\nMilitary Court, which Yuan Shih-kai had turned into an engine of\r\njudicial assassination, and within whose gloomy precincts many\r\nthousands of unfortunate men had perished practically untried in\r\nthe period 1911-1916.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the general situation throughout the country only slowly\r\nameliorated. The Northern Military party, determined to prevent\r\npolitical power from passing solely into the hands of the Southern\r\nRadicals, bitterly opposed the revival of the Nanking Provisional\r\nConstitution, and denounced the re-convocation of the old\r\nParliament of 1913, which had already assembled in Shanghai,\r\npreparatory to coming up to the capital. It needed a sharp\r\nmanoeuvre to bring them to their senses. The Chinese Navy,\r\nassembled in the waters near Shanghai, took action; and in an\r\nultimatum communicated to Peking by their Admiral, declared that\r\nso long as the government in the hands of General Tuan Chi-jui\r\nrefused to conform to popular wishes by reviving the Nanking\r\nProvisional Constitution and resummoning the old Parliament, so\r\nlong would the Navy refuse to recognize the authority of the\r\nCentral Government. With the fleet in the hands of the Southern\r\nConfederacy, which had not yet been formally dissolved, the Peking\r\nGovernment was powerless in the whole region of the Yangtsze;\r\nconsequently, after many vain manoeuvres to avoid this reasonable\r\nand proper solution, it was at last agreed that things should be\r\nbrought back precisely where they had been before the coup d'etat\r\nof the 4th November, 1913--the Peking Government being\r\nreconstituted by means of a coalition cabinet in which there would\r\nbe both nominees of the North and South--the premiership remaining\r\nin the hands of General Tuan Chi-jui.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th June a long funeral procession wended its way from the\r\nPresidential Palace to the railway station; it was the remains of\r\nthe great dictator being taken to their last resting-place in\r\nHonan. Conspicuous in this cortege was the magnificent stagecoach\r\nwhich had been designed to bear the founder of the new dynasty to\r\nhis throne but which only accompanied him to his grave. The\r\ndetached attitude of the crowds and the studied simplicity of the\r\nprocession, which was designed to be republican, proved more\r\nclearly than reams of arguments that China--despite herself\r\nperhaps--had become somewhat modernized, the oldest country in the\r\nworld being now the youngest republic and timidly trying to learn\r\nthe lessons of youth.\r\n\r\nOnce Yuan Shih-kai had been buried, a Mandate ordering the summary\r\narrest of all the chief monarchist plotters was issued; but the\r\ngang of corrupt men had already sought safety in ignominious\r\nflight; and it was understood that so long as they remained on\r\nsoil under foreign jurisdiction, no attempt would be made even to\r\nconfiscate their goods and chattels as would certainly have been\r\ndone under former governments. The days of treachery and double-\r\ndealing and cowardly revenge were indeed passing away and the new\r\nregime was committed to decency and fairplay. The task of the new\r\nPresident was no mean one, and in all the circumstances if he\r\nmanaged to steer a safe middle course and avoid both Caesarism and\r\ncomplete effacement, that is a tribute to his training. Born in\r\n1864 in Hupeh, one of the most important mid-Yangtsze provinces,\r\nPresident Li Yuan-hung was now fifty-two years old, and in the\r\nprime of life; but although he had been accustomed to a military\r\natmosphere from his earliest youth his policy had never been\r\nmilitaristic. His father having been in command of a force in\r\nNorth China for many years, rising from the ranks to the post of\r\ntsan chiang (Lieutenant-Colonel), had been constrained to give him\r\nthe advantage of a thoroughly modern training. At the age of 20 he\r\nhad entered the Naval School at Tientsin; whence six years later\r\nhe had graduated, seeing service in the navy as an engineer\r\nofficer during the Chino-Japanese war of 1894. After that campaign\r\nhe had been invited by Viceroy Chang Chih-tung, then one of the\r\nmost distinguished of the older viceroys, to join his staff at\r\nNanking, and had been entrusted with the supervision of the\r\nconstruction of the modern forts at the old Southern capital,\r\nwhich played such a notable part in the Revolution. When Chang\r\nChih-tung was transferred to the Wuchang viceroyalty, General Li\r\nYuan-hung had accompanied him, actively participating in the\r\ntraining of the new Hupeh army, and being assisted in that work by\r\nGerman instructors. In 1897 he had gone to Japan to study\r\neducational, military and administrative methods, returning to\r\nChina after a short stay, but again proceeding to Tokyo in 1897 as\r\nan officer attached to the Imperial Guards. In the autumn of the\r\nfollowing year he had returned to Wuchang and been appointed\r\nCommander of the Cavalry. Yet another visit was paid by him to\r\nJapan in 1902 to attend the grand military manoeuvres, these\r\njourneys giving him a good working knowledge of Japanese, in\r\naddition to the English which had been an important item in the\r\ncurriculum of the Naval School, and which he understands\r\nmoderately well. In 1903 he was promoted Brigadier General, being\r\nsubsequently gazetted as the Commander of the 2nd Division of\r\nRegulars (Chang Pei Chun) of Hupeh. He also constantly held\r\nvarious subsidiary posts, in addition to his substantive\r\nappointment, connected with educational and administrative work of\r\nvarious kinds, and has therefore a sound grasp of provincial\r\ngovernment. He was Commander-in-Chief of the 8th Division during\r\nthe famous military manoeuvres of 1906 at Changtehfu in Honan\r\nprovince, which are said to have been given birth to the idea of a\r\nuniversal revolt against the Manchus by using the army as the\r\nchief instrument.\r\n\r\nOn the memorable day of October 11, 1911, when the standard of\r\nrevolt was raised at Wuchang, somewhat against his will as he was\r\na loyal officer, he was elected military Governor, thus becoming\r\nthe first real leader of the Republic. Within the space of ten\r\ndays his leadership had secured the adhesion of fourteen provinces\r\nto the Republican cause; and though confronted by grave\r\ndifficulties owing to insufficiency of equipment and military\r\nsupplies, he fought the Northern soldiery for two months around\r\nWuchang with varying success. He it was, when the Republic had\r\nbeen formally established and the Manchu regime made a thing of\r\nthe past, who worked earnestly to bring about better relations\r\nbetween the armies of North and South China which had been arrayed\r\nagainst one another during many bitter weeks. It was he, also, who\r\nwas the first to advocate the complete separation of the civil and\r\nmilitary administration--the administrative powers in the early\r\ndays of the Republic being entirely in the hands of the military\r\ngovernors of the provinces who recruited soldiery in total\r\ndisregard to the wishes of the Central Government. Although this\r\nreform has even today only been partially successful, there is no\r\nreason to doubt that before the Republic is many years older the\r\nidea of the military dictating the policy and administration of\r\nthe country will pass away. The so-called Second Revolution of\r\n1913 awakened no sympathy in General Li Yuan-hung, because he was\r\nopposed to internal strife and held that all Chinese should work\r\nfor unity and concerted reform rather than indulge in fruitless\r\ndissensions. His disapproval of the monarchy movement had been\r\nequally emphatic in the face of an ugly outlook. He was repeatedly\r\napproached by the highest personages to give in his adhesion to\r\nYuan Shih-kai becoming emperor, but he persistently refused\r\nalthough grave fears were publicly expressed that he would be\r\nassassinated. Upon the formal acceptance of the Throne by Yuan\r\nShih-kai, he had had conferred on him a princedom which he\r\nsteadfastly refused to accept; and when the allowances of a prince\r\nwere brought to him from the Palace he returned them with the\r\nstatement that as he had not accepted the title the money was not\r\nhis. Every effort to break his will proved unavailing, his\r\npatience and calmness contributing very materially to the vast\r\nmoral opposition which finally destroyed Yuan Shih-kai.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man who was called upon to preside over the new\r\ngovernment and parliament which was now assembling in Peking; and\r\ncertainly it may be counted as an evidence of China's traditional\r\nluck which brought him to the helm. General Li Yuan Hung knew well\r\nthat the cool and singular plan which had been pursued to forge a\r\nnational mandate for a revival of the empire would take years\r\ncompletely to obliterate, and that the octopus-hold of the\r\nMilitary Party--the army being the one effective organization\r\nwhich had survived the Revolution--could not be loosened in a\r\nday,--in fact would have to be tolerated until the nation asserted\r\nitself and showed that it could and would be master. In the\r\ncircumstances his authority could not but be very limited,\r\ndisclosing itself in passive rather than in active ways. Wishing\r\nto be above all a constitutional President, he quickly saw that an\r\ninterregnum must be philosophically accepted during which the\r\nPermanent Constitution would be worked out and the various parties\r\nforced to a general agreement; and thanks to this decision the\r\nyear which has now elapsed since Yuan Shih-kai's death has been\r\nalmost entirely eventless, with the exception of the crisis which\r\narose over the war-issue, a matter which is fully discussed\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the closing months of 1916, the position was not a\r\nlittle singular. Two great political parties had arisen through\r\nthe Revolution--the Kuo Ming Tang or Nationalists, who included\r\nall the Radical elements, and the Chinputang or Progressives,\r\nwhose adherents were mainly men of the older official classes, and\r\ntherefore conservative. The Yunnan movement, which had led to the\r\noverthrow of Yuan Shih-kai, had been inspired and very largely\r\ndirected by the scholar Liang Ch'i-chao, a leader of the\r\nChinputang. To this party, then, though numerically inferior to\r\nthe Kuo Ming Tang, was due the honour and credit of re-\r\nestablishing the Republic, the Kuo Ming Tang being under a cloud\r\nowing to the failure of the Second Revolution of 1913 which it had\r\nengineered. Nevertheless, owing to the Kuo Ming Tang being more\r\ngenuinely republican, since it was mainly composed of younger and\r\nmore modern minds, it was from its ranks that the greatest check\r\nto militarism sprang; and therefore although its work was\r\nnecessarily confined to the Council-chamber, its moral influence\r\nwas very great and constantly representative of the civilian\r\nelement as opposed to the militarist. By staking everything on the\r\nnecessity of adhering to the Nanking Provisional Constitution\r\nuntil a permanent instrument was drawn up, the Kuo Ming Tang\r\nrapidly established an ascendancy; for although the Nanking\r\nConstitution had admittedly failed to bring representative\r\ngovernment because of the difficulty of defining powers in such a\r\nway as to make a practical autocracy impossible, it had at least\r\nestablished as a basic principle that China could no longer be\r\nruled as a family possession, which in itself marked a great\r\nadvance on all previous conceptions. President Li Yuan-hung's\r\npolicy, in the circumstances, was to play the part of a moderator\r\nand to seek to bring harmony to a mass of heterogeneous elements\r\nthat had to carry out the practical work of government over four\r\nhundred millions of people.\r\n\r\nHis success was at the outset hampered by the appeal the military\r\nwere quick in making to a new method--to offset the power of\r\nParliament in Peking. We have already dealt with the evils of the\r\ncircular telegram in China--surely one of the most unexpected\r\nresults of adapting foreign inventions to native life. By means of\r\nthese telegraphic campaigns a rapid exchange of views is made\r\npossible among the provincial governors; and consequently in the\r\nautumn of 1916, inspired by the Military Party, a wholly illegal\r\nConference of generals was organized by the redoubtable old\r\nGeneral Chang Hsun on the Pukow railway for the purpose of\r\noverawing parliament, and securing that the Military Party\r\nretained a controlling hand behind the scenes. It is perhaps\r\nunnecessary today to do more than note the fact that the peace of\r\nthe country was badly strained by this procedure; but thanks to\r\nmoderate counsels and the wisdom of the President no open breach\r\noccurred and there is reason to believe that this experiment will\r\nnot be repeated,--at least not in the same way. [Footnote:\r\nAlthough the events dealt with in Chapter XVI have brought China\r\nface to face with a new crisis the force of the arguments used\r\nhere is in no wise weakened.]\r\n\r\nThe difficulty to be solved is of an unique nature. It is not that\r\nthe generals and the Military Party are necessarily reactionary:\r\nit is that, not belonging to the intellectual-literary portion of\r\nthe ruling elements, they are less advanced and less accustomed to\r\nforeign ways, and therefore more in touch with the older China\r\nwhich lingers on in the vast agricultural districts, and in all\r\nthose myriad of townships which are dotted far and wide across the\r\nprovinces to the confines of Central Asia. Naturally it is hard\r\nfor a class of men who hold the balance of power and carry on much\r\nof the actual work of governing to submit to the paper decrees of\r\nan institution they do not accept as being responsible and\r\nrepresentative: but many indications are available that when a\r\nPermanent Constitution has been promulgated, and made an article\r\nof faith in all the schools, a change for the better will come and\r\nthe old antagonisms gradually disappear.\r\n\r\nIt is on this Constitution that Parliament has been at work ever\r\nsince it re-assembled in August, 1916, and which is now\r\npractically completed. Sitting together three times a week as a\r\nNational Convention, the two Houses have subjected the Draft\r\nConstitution (which was prepared by a Special Parliamentary\r\nDrafting Committee) to a very exhaustive examination and\r\ndiscussion. Many violent scenes have naturally marked the progress\r\nof this important work, the two great parties, the Kuo Ming Tang\r\nand the Chinputang, coming to loggerheads again and again. But in\r\nthe main the debates and the decisions arrived at have been\r\nsatisfactory and important, because they have tended to express in\r\na concrete and indisputable form the present state of the Chinese\r\nmind and its immense underlying commonsense. Remarkable\r\ndiscussions and fierce enmities, for instance, marked the final\r\ndecision not to make the Confucian cult the State Religion; but\r\nthere is not the slightest doubt that in formally registering this\r\nveritable revolution in the secret stronghold of Chinese political\r\nthought, a Bastille has been overthrown and the ground left clear\r\nfor the development of individualism and personal responsibility\r\nin a way which was impossible under the leaden formulae of the\r\ngreatest of the Chinese sages. In defining the relationship which\r\nmust exist between the Central Government and the provinces even\r\nmore formidable difficulties have been encountered, the apostles\r\nof decentralization and the advocates of centralization refusing\r\nfor many months to agree on the so-called Provincial system, and\r\nthen fighting a battle A OUTRANCE on the question of whether this\r\nbody of law should form a chapter in the Constitution or be simply\r\nan annexure to the main instrument. The agreement which was\r\nfinally arrived at--to make it part and parcel of the\r\nConstitution--was masterly in that it has secured that the\r\nsovereignty of the people will not tend to be expressed in the\r\nprovincial dietines which have now been re-erected (after having\r\nbeen summarily destroyed by Yuan Shih-kai) the Central Parliament\r\nbeing left the absolute master. This for a number of years will no\r\ndoubt be more of a theory than a practice; but there is every\r\nindication that parliamentary government will within a limited\r\nperiod be more successful in China than in some European\r\ncountries; and that the Chinese with their love of well-\r\nestablished procedure and cautious action, will select open debate\r\nas the best method of sifting the grain from the chaff and\r\ndeciding every important matter by the vote of the majority.\r\nAlready in the period of 1916-1917 Parliament has more than\r\njustified its re-convocation by becoming a National Watch\r\nCommittee. Interpellations on every conceivable subject have been\r\nconstant and frequent; fierce verbal assaults are delivered on\r\nCabinet Ministers; and slowly but inexorably a real sense of\r\nMinisterial responsibility is being created, the fear of having to\r\nrun the gauntlet of Parliament abating, if it has not yet entirely\r\ndestroyed, many malpractices. In the opinion of the writer in less\r\nthan ten years Parliament will have succeeded in coalescing the\r\ncountry into an organic whole, and will have placed the Cabinet in\r\nsuch close daily relations with it that something very similar to\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon theory of government will be impregnably\r\nentrenched in Peking. That such a miracle should be possible in\r\nextreme Eastern Asia is one more proof that there are no victories\r\nbeyond the capacity of the human mind.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, for the time being, in China as in countries ten\r\nthousand miles away, ministerial irresponsibility is the enemy;\r\nthat is to say that so-called Cabinet-rule, with the effacement of\r\nthe Chief Executive, has tended to make Cabinet Ministers removed\r\nfrom effective daily control. All sorts of things are done which\r\nshould not be done and men are still in charge of portfolios who\r\nshould be summarily expelled from the capital for malpractices.\r\n[Footnote: Since this was written two Cabinet Ministers have been\r\nsummarily arrested.] But although Chinese are slow to take action\r\nand prefer to delay all decisions until they have about them the\r\ninexorable quality which is associated with Fate, there is not the\r\nslightest doubt that in the long run the dishonest suffer, and an\r\nincreasingly efficient body of men take their place. From every\r\npoint of view then there is reason for congratulation in the\r\npresent position, and every hope that the future will unroll\r\npeacefully.\r\n\r\nA visit to Parliament under the new regime is a revelation to most\r\nmen: the candid come away with an impression which is never\r\neffaced from their minds. There is a peculiar suggestiveness even\r\nin the location of the Houses of the National Assembly. They are\r\ntucked away in the distant Western city immediately under the\r\nshadow of the vast Tartar Wall as if it had been fully expected\r\nwhen they were called into being that they would never justify\r\ntheir existence, and that the crushing weight of the great bastion\r\nof brick and stone surrounding the capital would soon prove to\r\nthem how futile it was for such palpable intruders to aspire to\r\nnational control. Under Yuan Shih-kai, as under the Manchus, they\r\nwere an exercise in the arm of government, something which was\r\nnever to be allowed to harden into a settled practice. They were\r\nfirst cousins to railways, to electrical power, to metalled\r\nroadways and all those other modern instances beginning to modify\r\nan ancient civilization entirely based on agriculture; and because\r\nthey were so distantly related to the real China of the farm-yard\r\nit was thought that they would always stand outside the national\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThat was what the fools believed. Yet in a copy of the rules of\r\nprocedure of the old Imperial Senate (Tzuchengyuan) the writer\r\nfinds this note written in 1910: \"The Debates of this body have\r\nbeen remarkable during the very first session. They make it seem\r\nclear that the first National Parliament of 1913 will seize\r\ncontrol of China and nullify the power of the Throne. Result,\r\nrevolution--\" Though the dating is a little confused, the prophecy\r\nis worthy of record.\r\n\r\nThe watchfulness of the special police surrounding the Parliament\r\nof 1916-1917 and the great number of these men also tells a story\r\nas eloquent as the location of the building. It is not so much\r\nthat any contemplated violence sets these guardians here as the\r\nnecessity to advertise that there has been unconstitutional\r\nviolence in the past which, if possible, will be rigidly defeated\r\nin the future. Probably no National Assembly in the world has been\r\nheld up to greater contempt than the Parliament of Peking and\r\nprobably no body deserves it less. An afternoon spent in the House\r\nof Representatives would certainly surprise most open-minded men\r\nwho have been content to believe that the Chinese experiment was\r\nwhat some critics have alleged it to be. The Chinese as a people,\r\nbeing used to guild-house proceedings, debates, in which the\r\nwelfare of the majority is decided after an examination of the\r\nprinciples at stake, are a very old and well-established custom;\r\nand though at present there are awkwardnesses and gaucheries to be\r\nnoted, when practice has become better fixed, the common sense of\r\nthe race will abundantly disclose itself and make a lasting mark\r\non contemporary history. There can be no doubt about this at all.\r\nTake your seat in the gallery and see for yourself. The first\r\nquestion which rises to the lips is--where are the young men,\r\nthose crude and callow youths masquerading as legislators which\r\nthe vernacular press has so excessively lampooned? The majority of\r\nthe members, so far from being young, are men of thirty or forty,\r\nor even fifty, with intelligent and tired faces that have lost the\r\nSpring of youth. Here and there you will even see venerable\r\ngreybeards suffering from rheumy coughs who ought to be at home;\r\nand though occasionally there is a lithe youngster in European\r\nclothes with the veneer he acquired abroad not yet completely\r\nrubbed off, the total impression is that of oldish men who have\r\nreached years of maturity and who are as representative of the\r\ncountry and as good as the country is in a position today to\r\nprovide. No one who knows the real China can deny that.\r\n\r\nThe Continental arrangement of the Members' desks and the raised\r\ntribune of the Speaker, with its rows of clerks and recorders,\r\nmake an impression of orderliness, tinged nevertheless with a\r\nfaint revolutionary flavour. Perhaps it is the straight black\r\nChinese hair and the rich silk clothing, set on a very plain and\r\nunadorned background, which recall the pictures of the French\r\nRevolution. It is somehow natural in such circumstances that there\r\nshould occasionally be dramatic outbursts with the blood of\r\noffenders bitterly demanded as though we were not living in the\r\nTwentieth Century when blood alone is admittedly no satisfaction.\r\nThe presence of armed House police at every door, and in the front\r\nrows of the strangers' gallery as well, contributes to this\r\nimpression which has certain qualities of the theatre about it and\r\nis oddly stimulating. China at work legislating has already\r\ncreated her first traditions: she is proceeding deliberately\r\narmed--with the lessons of the immediate past fully noted.\r\n\r\nThis being the home of a literary race, papers and notebooks are\r\non most Members' desks. As the electric bells ring sharply an\r\nunending procession of men file in to take their seats, for there\r\nhas been a recess and the House has been only half-filled. Nearly\r\nevery one is in Chinese dress (pien-yi) with the Member's badge\r\npinned conspicuously on the breast. The idea speedily becomes a\r\nconviction that this after all is not extraneous to the nation but\r\nactually of the living flesh, a vital and imperative thing. The\r\nvastness and audacity of it all cannot fail to strike the\r\nimaginative mind, for the four or five hundred men who are\r\ngathered here typify, if they do not yet represent, the four or\r\nfive hundred millions who make up the country. You see as it were\r\nthe nation in profile, a ponderous, slow-moving mass, quickly\r\nresponsive to curious subconscious influences--suddenly angry and\r\nsuddenly calm again because Reason has after all always been the\r\ngreat goddess which is perpetually worshipped. All are scholarly\r\nand deliberate in their movements. When the Speaker calls the\r\nHouse in order and the debate commences, deep silence comes save\r\nfor the movement of hundreds of nervous hands that touch papers or\r\nfidget to and fro. Every man uses his hands, particularly when he\r\nspeaks, not clenched as a European would do, but open, with the\r\nslim figures speaking a language of their own, twisting, turning,\r\ninsinuating, deriding, a little history of compromises. It would\r\nbe interesting to write the story of China from a study of the\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nEach man goes to the rostrum to speak, and each has much to say.\r\nSoon another impression deepens--that the Northerners with their\r\nclear-cut speech and their fuller voices have an advantage over\r\nthe Southerners of the kind that all public performers know. The\r\nmandarin language of Peking is after all the mother-language of\r\nofficialdom, the madre linqua, less nervous and more precise than\r\nany other dialect and invested with a certain air of authority\r\nwhich cannot be denied. The sharp-sounding, high-pitched Southern\r\nvoice, though it may argue very acutely and rapidly, appears at an\r\nincreasing disadvantage. There seems to be a tendency inherent in\r\nit to become querulous, to make its pleading sound specious\r\nbecause of over-much speech. These are curious little things which\r\nhave been not without influence in other regions of the world.\r\n\r\nThe applause when it comes proves the same thing as applause does\r\neverywhere; that if you want to drive home your points in a large\r\nassembly you must be condensed and simple, using broad, slashing\r\narguments. This is precisely what distinguishes melodrama from\r\ndrama, and which explains why excessive analysis is no argument in\r\nthe popular mind. Generally, however, there is not much applause\r\nand the voice of the speaker wanders through the hall\r\nuninterrupted by signs of content or discontent. Sometimes,\r\nalthough rather rarely, there is a gust of laughter as a point is\r\nscored against a hated rival. But it dies away as suddenly as it\r\narose--almost before you have noted it, as if it were superfluous\r\nand must make room for more serious things.\r\n\r\nWith the closing of a debate there is the vote. An electric bell\r\nrings again, and with a rough hand the House police close all the\r\nexits. The clerks come down into the aisles. They seem to move\r\nlistlessly and indifferently; yet very quickly they have checked\r\nthe membership to insure that the excessively large quorum\r\nrequisite is present. Now the Speaker calls for the vote.\r\nMassively and stiffly, as at a word of command the \"ayes\" rise in\r\ntheir seats. There is a round of applause; the bill has been\r\ncarried almost unanimously. That, however, is not always so. When\r\nthere is an obstreperous mood abroad, the House will decline to\r\nproceed with the agenda, and a dozen men will rise at a time and\r\nspeak from behind their desks, trying to talk each other down. The\r\nSpeaker stands patiently wrestling with the problem of procedure--\r\nand often failing since practice is still in process of being\r\nformed. Years must elapse before absolutely hard-and-fast rules\r\nare established. Still the progress already made since August,\r\n1916, is remarkable, and something is being learned every day. The\r\nbusiness of a Parliament is after all to debate--to give voice to\r\nthe uppermost thoughts in the nation's mind; and how those\r\nthoughts are expressed is a continual exposition of the real state\r\nof the nation's political beliefs. Parliament is--or should be--a\r\nmicrocosm of the race; parliament is never any better or any worse\r\nthan the mass of the people. The rule of the majority as expressed\r\nin the voting of the National Assembly must be taken as a\r\nfundamental thing; China is no exception to the rule--the rule of\r\nthe majority must be decisive.\r\n\r\nBut here another complexity of the new Chinese political life\r\nenters into the problem. The existence of a responsible Cabinet,\r\nwhich is not yet linked to the Legislative body in any well-\r\nunderstood way, and which furthermore has frequently acted in\r\nopposition to the President's office, makes for a daily struggle\r\nin the administration of the country which is strongly to be\r\ncondemned and which has already led to some ugly clashes. But\r\nnevertheless there are increasing indications that parliamentary\r\ngovernment is making steady headway and that when both the\r\nPermanent Constitution and the Local Government system have been\r\nenforced, a new note will be struck. No doubt it will need a\r\nyounger generation in office to secure a complete abandonment of\r\nall the old ways, but the writer has noted with astonishment\r\nduring the past twelve-month how eager even viceroys belonging to\r\nthe old Manchu regime have become to fall in with the new order\r\nand to lend their help, a sharp competition to obtain ministerial\r\nposts being evident in spite of the fact that the gauntlet of\r\nParliament has to be run and a majority vote recorded before any\r\nappointment is valid.\r\n\r\nOne last anomaly has, however, yet to be done away with in Peking.\r\nThe deposed boy Emperor still resides in the Winter Palace\r\nsurrounded by a miniature court,--a state of affairs which should\r\nnot be tolerated any longer as it no doubt tends to assist the\r\nrumours which every now and again are mysteriously spread by\r\ninterested parties that a Restoration is imminent. The time has\r\narrived when not only must the Manchu Imperial Family be removed\r\nfar from the capital but a scheme worked out for commuting the\r\npension-system of so-called Bannerman families who still draw\r\ntheir monthly allowances as under the Manchus, thanks to the\r\narticles of Favourable Treatment signed at the time of abdication\r\nof 1912. When these two important questions have been settled,\r\nimperialism in China will tend rapidly to fade into complete\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLIC IN COLLISION WITH REALITY: TWO TYPICAL INSTANCES OF\r\n\"FOREIGN AGGRESSION\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the internal conditions which the new\r\nadministration was called upon to face with the death of Yuan\r\nShih-kai. With very little money in the National Treasury and with\r\nthe provinces unable or unwilling to remit to the capital a single\r\ndollar, it was fortunate that at least one public service, erected\r\nunder foreign pressure, should be brilliantly justifying its\r\nexistence. The Salt Administration, efficiently reorganized in the\r\nspace of three years by the great Indian authority, Sir Richard\r\nDane, was now providing a monthly surplus of nearly five million\r\ndollars; and it was this revenue which kept China alive during a\r\ntroubled transitional period when every one was declaring that she\r\nmust die. By husbanding this hard cash and mixing it liberally\r\nwith paper money, the Central Government has been able since June,\r\n1916, to meet its current obligations and to keep the general\r\nmachinery from breaking down.\r\n\r\nBut in a country such as China new dangers have to be constantly\r\nfaced and smoothed away--the interests of the outer world pressing\r\non the country and conflicting with the native interest at a\r\nmyriad points. And in order to illustrate and make clear the sort\r\nof daily exacerbation which the nation must endure because of the\r\nvastness of its territory and the octopus-hold of the foreigner we\r\ngive two typical cases of international trouble which have\r\noccurred since Yuan Shih-kai's death. The first is the well-known\r\nChengchiatun incident which occurred in Manchuria in August, 1916:\r\nthe second is the Laohsikai affair which took place in Tientsin in\r\nNovember of the same year and created a storm of rage against\r\nFrance throughout North China which, at the moment of writing has\r\nnot yet abated.\r\n\r\nThe facts about the Chengchiatun incident are incredibly simple\r\nand merit being properly told. Chengchiatun is a small Mongol-\r\nManchurian market-down lying some sixty miles west of the South\r\nManchurian railway by the ordinary cart-roads, though as the crow\r\nflies the distance is much less. The country round about is \"new\r\ncountry,\" the prefecture in which Chengchiatun lies being\r\noriginally purely Mongol territory on which Chinese squatted in\r\nsuch numbers that it was necessary to erect the ordinary Chinese\r\ncivil administration. Thirty or forty miles due west of the town\r\ncultivation practically ceases; and then nothing meets the eye but\r\nthe rolling grasslands of Mongolia, with their sparse encampments\r\nof nomad horsemen and shepherds which stretch so monotonously into\r\nthe infinities of High Asia.\r\n\r\nThe region is strategically important because the trade-routes\r\nconverge there from the growing marts of the Taonanfu\r\nadministration, which is the extreme westernly limit of Chinese\r\nauthority in the Mongolian borderland. A rich exchange in hides,\r\nfurs, skins, cattle and foodstuffs has given this frontier-town\r\nfrom year to year an increasing importance in the eyes of the\r\nChinese who are fully aware of the dangers of a laissez aller\r\npolicy and are determined to protect the rights they have acquired\r\nby pre-emption. The fact that notorious Mongol brigand-chiefs,\r\nsuch as the famous Babachapu who was allied to the Manchu\r\nRestoration Party and who was said to have been subsidized by the\r\nJapanese Military Party, had been making Chengchiatun one of their\r\nobjectives, brought concern early in 1916 to the Moukden Governor,\r\nthe energetic General Chang Tso-lin, who in order to cope with the\r\ndanger promptly established a military cordon round the district,\r\nwith a relatively large reserve based on Chengchiatun, drawn from\r\nthe 28th Army Division. A certain amount of desultory fighting\r\nmonths before any one had heard of the town had given Chengchiatun\r\nthe odour of the camp; and when in the summer the Japanese began\r\nmilitary manoeuvres in the district with various scattered\r\ndetachments, on the excuse that the South Manchuria railway zone\r\nwhere they alone had the right under the Portsmouth Peace Treaty\r\nto be, was too cramped for field exercises, it became apparent\r\nthat dangerous developments might be expected--particularly as a\r\nbody of Japanese infantry was billeted right in the centre of the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th August a Japanese civilian at Chengchiatun--there is\r\na small Japanese trading community there--approached a Chinese boy\r\nwho was selling fish. On the boy refusing to sell at the price\r\noffered him, the Japanese caught hold of him and started beating\r\nhim. A Chinese soldier of the 28th Division who was passing\r\nintervened; and a scuffle commenced in which other Chinese\r\nsoldiers joined and which resulted in the Japanese being severely\r\nhandled. After the Chinese had left him, the man betook himself to\r\nthe nearest Japanese post and reported that he had been grievously\r\nassaulted by Chinese soldiers for no reason whatsoever. A Japanese\r\ngensdarme made a preliminary investigation in company with the\r\nman; then returning to the Japanese barracks, declared that he\r\ncould find no one in authority; that his attempts at discovering\r\nthe culprits had been resisted; and that he must have help. The\r\nJapanese officer in command, who was a captain, detailed a\r\nlieutenant and twenty men to proceed to the Chinese barracks to\r\nobtain satisfaction from the Chinese Commander--using force if\r\nnecessary. It was precisely in this way that the play was set in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThe detachment marched off to the headquarters of the offending\r\nChinese detachment, which was billeted in a pawnshop, and tried to\r\nforce their way past a sentry who stood his ground, into the inner\r\ncourtyards. A long parley ensued with lowered bayonets; and at\r\nlast on the Chinese soldier absolutely refusing to give way, the\r\nlieutenant gave orders to cut him down. There appears to be no\r\ndoubt about these important facts--that is to say, that the act\r\nof war was the deliberate attack by a Japanese armed detachment on\r\na Chinese sentry who was guarding the quarters of his Commander.\r\n\r\nA frightful scene followed. It appears that scattered groups of\r\nChinese soldiers, some with their arms, and some without, had\r\ncollected during this crisis and point-blank firing at once\r\ncommenced. The first shots appear to have been fired--though this\r\nwas never proved--by a Chinese regimental groom, who was standing\r\nwith some horses some distance away in the gateway of some\r\nstabling and who is said to have killed or wounded the largest\r\nnumber of Japanese. In any case seven Japanese soldiers were\r\nkilled outright, five more mortally wounded and four severely so,\r\nthe Chinese themselves losing four killed, besides a number of\r\nwounded. The remnant of the Japanese detachment after this rude\r\nreverse managed to retreat with their wounded officer to their own\r\nbarracks where the whole detachment barricaded themselves in,\r\nfiring for many hours at everything that moved on the roads though\r\nabsolutely no attempt was made by the Chinese soldiery to advance\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nThe sound of this heavy firing, and the wild report that many\r\nJapanese had been killed, had meanwhile spread panic throughout\r\nthe town, and there was a general sauve qui pent, a terrible\r\nretribution being feared. The local Magistrate finally restored\r\nsome semblance of order; and after dark proceeded in person with\r\nsome notables of the town to the Japanese barracks to tender his\r\nregrets and to arrange for the removal of the Japanese corpses\r\nwhich were lying just as they had fallen, and which Chinese custom\r\ndemanded should be decently cared for, though they constituted\r\nimportant and irrefragible evidence of the armed invasion which\r\nhad been practised. The Japanese Commander, instead of meeting\r\nthese conciliatory attempts half-way, thereupon illegally arrested\r\nthe Magistrate and locked him up, being impelled to this action by\r\nthe general fear among his men that a mass attack would be made in\r\nthe night by the Chinese troops in garrison and the whole command\r\nwiped out. Nothing, however, occurred and on the 14th instant the\r\nMagistrate was duly released on his sending for his son to take\r\nhis place as hostage. On the 16th the Magistrate had successfully\r\narranged the withdrawal of all Chinese troops five miles outside\r\nthe town to prevent further clashes. On the 15th Japanese cavalry\r\nand infantry began to arrive in large numbers from the South\r\nManchuria railway zone (where they alone have the Treaty right to\r\nbe) and the town of Chengchiatun was arbitrarily placed by them in\r\na state of siege.\r\n\r\nHere is the stuff of which the whole incident was made: there is\r\nnothing material beyond the facts stated which illustrate very\r\nglaringly the manner in which a strong Power acts towards a weak\r\none.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the effect in Tokyo of these happenings had been\r\nelectrical. Relying on the well-known Japanese police axiom, that\r\nthe man who gets in his story first is the prosecutor and the\r\naccused the guilty party, irrespective of what the evidence may\r\nbe, the newspapers all came out with the same account of a\r\ncalculated attack by \"ferocious Chinese soldiers\" on a Japanese\r\ndetachment and the general public were asked to believe that a\r\nnumber of their enlisted nationals had been deliberately and\r\nbrutally murdered. It was not, however, until more than a week\r\nafter the incident that an official report was published by the\r\nTokyo Foreign Office, when the following garbled account was\r\ndistributed far and wide as the Japanese case:--\r\n\r\n\"When one Kiyokishy Yoshimoto, aged 27, an employee of a Japanese\r\napothecary at Chengchiatun, was passing the headquarters of the\r\nChinese troops on the 13th instant, a Chinese soldier stopped him,\r\nand, with some remarks, which were unintelligible to the Japanese,\r\nsuddenly struck him on the head. Yoshimoto became enraged, but was\r\nsoon surrounded by a large number of Chinese soldiers and others,\r\nwho subjected him to all kind of humiliation. As a result of this\r\nlawlessness on the part of the Chinese, the Japanese sustained\r\ninjuries in seven or eight places, but somehow he managed to break\r\naway and reach a Japanese police box, where he applied for help.\r\nOn receipt of this news, a policeman, named Kowase, hastened to\r\nthe spot, but by the time he arrived there all the offenders had\r\nfled. He therefore repaired to the headquarters of the Chinese to\r\nlay a complaint, but the sentry stopped him, and presented a\r\npistol at him, and under these circumstances he was obliged to\r\napply to the Japanese Garrison headquarters, where Captain Inone\r\ninstructed Lieutenant Matsuo with twenty men to escort the\r\npoliceman to the Chinese headquarters. When the party approached\r\nthe Chinese headquarters, Chinese troops began to fire, and the\r\npolicemen and others were either killed or wounded. Despite the\r\nfact that the Japanese troops retired, the Chinese troops did not\r\ngive up firing, but besieged the Japanese garrison, delivering\r\nseveral severe attacks. Soon after the fighting ceased, the\r\nChinese authorities visited the Japanese barracks, and expressed\r\nthe desire that the affair be settled amicably. It was the\r\noriginal intention of the Japanese troops to fight it out, but\r\nthey were completely out-numbered, and lest the safety of the\r\nJapanese residents be endangered, they stopped fighting. On\r\nexamination of the dead bodies of seven Japanese soldiers, who\r\nwere attacked outside the barracks, it was discovered that they\r\nhad been all slain by the Chinese troops, the bodies bearing marks\r\nof violence.\"\r\n\r\nWithout entering again into the merits of the case, we would ask\r\nthose who are acquainted with recent history whether it is likely\r\nthat Chinese soldiers, knowing all the pains and penalties\r\nattaching to such action, would deliberately attack a body of\r\ntwenty armed Japanese under an officer as the Japanese official\r\naccount states? We believe that no impartial tribunal,\r\ninvestigating the matter on the spot, could fail to point out the\r\nreal aggressors and withal lay bare the web of a most amazing\r\nstate of affairs. For in order to understand what occurred, on the\r\n13th August, 1916, it is necessary to turn far away from\r\nChengchiatun and see what lies behind it all.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the brain of the Japanese Military Party, which by\r\nno means represents the Japanese nation or the Japanese Government\r\nalthough it exercises a powerful influence on both, is the fixed\r\nidea that South Manchuria and Inner Mongolia must be turned into a\r\nstrongly held and fortified Japanese ENCLAVE, if the balance of\r\npower in Eastern Asia is to be maintained. Pursuant to this idea,\r\nJapanese diplomacy was induced many months ago to concentrate its\r\nefforts on winning--if not wringing--from Russia the\r\nstrategically important strip of railway south of the Sungari\r\nRiver, because (and this should be carefully noted) with the\r\nSungari as the undisputed dividing-line between the Russian and\r\nJapanese spheres in Manchuria, and with Japanese shallow-draft\r\ngun-boats navigating that waterway and entering the Nonni river,\r\nit would be easily possible for Japan to complete a \"Continental\r\nquadrilateral\" which would include Korea, South Manchuria and\r\nInner Mongolia, the extreme western barrier of which would be the\r\nnew system of Inner Mongolian railways centring round Taonanfu and\r\nterminating at Jehol, for which Japan already holds the building\r\nrights. [Footnote: Russian diplomats now deny that the Japanese\r\nproposals regarding the cession of the railway south of the\r\nSungari river have ever been formally agreed to.] policing rights\r\n--in the outer zone of this enclave,--with a total exclusion of all\r\nChinese garrisons, is the preliminary goal towards which the\r\nJapanese Military Party has been long plainly marching; and long\r\nbefore anybody had heard of Chengchiatun, a scheme of\r\nreconnoitring detachments had been put in force to spy out the\r\nland and form working alliances with the Mongol bands in order to\r\nharass and drive away all the representatives of Chinese\r\nauthority. What occurred, then, at Chengchiatun might have taken\r\nplace at any one of half-a-dozen other places in this vast and\r\nlittle-known region whither Japanese detachments have silently\r\ngone; and if Chinese diplomacy in the month of August, 1916, was\r\nfaced with a rude surprise, it was only what political students\r\nhad long been expecting. For though Japan should be the real\r\ndefender of Chinese liberties, it is a fact that in Chinese\r\naffairs Japanese diplomacy has been too long dictated to by the\r\nMilitary Party in Tokio and attempts nothing save when violence\r\nallows it to tear from China some fresh portion of her\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nAnd here we reach the crux of the matter. One of the little known\r\npeculiarities of the day lies in the fact that Japan is the land\r\nof political inaction because there is no tradition of action save\r\nthat which has been built up by the military and naval chiefs\r\nsince the Chinese war of 1894-95. Having only visualized the world\r\nin international terms during two short decades, there has been no\r\ntime for a proper tradition to be created by the civil government\r\nof Japan; and because there is no such tradition, the island\r\nempire of the East has no true foreign policy and is at the mercy\r\nof manufactured crises, being too often committed to petty\r\nadventures which really range her on the side of those in Europe\r\nthe Allies have set themselves to destroy. It is for this reason\r\nthat the Chinese are consistently treated as though they were\r\nhewers of wood and drawers of water, helots who are occasionally\r\nflattered in the columns of the daily press and yet are secretly\r\nlooked upon as men who have been born merely to be cuffed and\r\nconquered. The Moukden Governor, General Chang Tso-ling,\r\ndiscussing the Chengchiatun affair with the writer, put the matter\r\nin a nutshell. Striking the table he exclaimed: \"After all we are\r\nnot made of wood like this, we too are flesh and blood and must\r\ndefend our own people. A dozen times I have said, 'Let them come\r\nand take Manchuria openly if they dare, but let them cease their\r\nchildish intrigues.' Why do they not do so? Because they are not\r\nsure they can swallow us--not at all sure. Do you understand? We\r\nare weak, we are stupid, we are divided, but we are innumerable,\r\nand in the end, if they persist, China will burst the Japanese\r\nstomach.\"\r\n\r\nSuch passionate periods are all very well, but when it comes to\r\nthe sober business of the council chamber it is a regrettable fact\r\nthat Chinese, although foreign friends implore them to do so, do\r\nnot properly use the many weapons in their armoury. Thus in this\r\nparticular case, instead of at once hurrying to Chengchiatun some\r\nof the many foreign advisers who sit kicking their heels in Peking\r\nfrom one end of the year to the other and who number competent\r\njurisconsults, China did next to nothing. No proper report was\r\ndrawn up on the spot; sworn statements were not gathered, nor were\r\nwitnesses brought to Peking; and it therefore happened that when\r\nJapan filed her demands for redress, China had not in her\r\npossession anything save an utterly inadequate defence. Mainly\r\nbecause of this she was forced to agree to foregoing any direct\r\ndiscussion of the rights and wrongs of the case, proceeding\r\ndirectly to negotiations based on the various claims which Japan\r\nfiled and which were as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. Punishment of the General commanding the 28th Division.\r\n\r\n2. The dismissal of officers at Chengchiatun responsible for the\r\noccurrence as well as the severe punishment of those who took\r\ndirect part in the fracas.\r\n\r\n3. Proclamations to be posted ordering all Chinese soldiers and\r\ncivilians in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia to refrain\r\nfrom any act calculated to provoke a breach of the peace with\r\nJapanese soldiers or civilians.\r\n\r\n4. China to agree to the stationing of Japanese police officers in\r\nplaces in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia where their\r\npresence was considered necessary for the protection of Japanese\r\nsubjects. China also to agree to the engagement by the officials\r\nof South Manchuria of Japanese police advisers.\r\n\r\nAnd in addition:--\r\n\r\n1. Chinese troops stationed in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner\r\nMongolia to employ a certain number of Japanese Military officers\r\nas advisers.\r\n\r\n2. Chinese Military Cadet schools to employ a certain number of\r\nJapanese Military officers as instructors.\r\n\r\n3. The Military Governor of Moukden to proceed personally to Port\r\nArthur to the Japanese Military Governor of Kwantung to apologize\r\nfor the occurrence and to tender similar personal apologies to the\r\nJapanese Consul General in Moukden.\r\n\r\n4. Adequate compensation to be paid by China to the Japanese\r\nsufferers and to the families of those killed.\r\n\r\nThe merest tyro will see at once that so far from caring very much\r\nabout the killing of her soldiery, Japan was bent on utilizing the\r\nopportunity to gain a certain number of new rights and privileges\r\nin the zone of Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia--\r\nnotably an extension of her police and military-supervision\r\nrights. In spite, however, of the faulty procedure to which she\r\nhad consented, China showed considerable tenacity in the course of\r\nnegotiations which lasted nearly half a year, and by the end of\r\nJanuary, 1917, had whittled down the question of Japanese\r\ncompensation to fairly meagre proportions. To be precise the two\r\ngovernments agreed to embody by the exchange of Notes the five\r\nfollowing stipulations:\r\n\r\n1. The General commanding the 28th Division to be reprimanded.\r\n\r\n2. Officers responsible to be punished according to law. If the\r\nlaw provides for severe punishment, such punishment will be\r\ninflicted.\r\n\r\n3. Proclamations to be issued enjoining Chinese soldiers and\r\ncivilians in the districts where there is mixed residence to\r\naccord considerate treatment to Japanese soldiers and civilians.\r\n\r\n4. The Military Governor of Moukden to send a representative to\r\nPort Arthur to convey his regret when the Military Governor of\r\nKwantung and Japanese Consul General at Moukden are there\r\ntogether,\r\n\r\n5. A solatium of $500 (Five Hundred Dollars) to be given to the\r\nJapanese merchant Yoshimoto.\r\n\r\nBut though the incident was thus nominally closed, and amicable\r\nrelations restored, the most important point--the question of\r\nJapanese police-rights in Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner\r\nMongolia--was left precisely where it had been before, the most\r\nvigorous Chinese protests not having induced Japan to abate in the\r\nslightest her pretensions. During previous years a number of\r\nJapanese police-stations and police-boxes had been established in\r\ndefiance of the local authorities in these regions, and although\r\nChina in these negotiations recorded her strongest possible\r\nobjection to their presence as being the principal cause of the\r\ncontinual friction between Chinese and Japanese, Japan refused to\r\nwithdraw from her contention that they did not constitute any\r\nextension of the principle of extraterritoriality, and that indeed\r\nJapanese police, distributed at such points as the Japanese\r\nconsular authorities considered necessary, must be permanently\r\naccepted. Here then is a matter which will require careful\r\nconsideration when the Powers meet to revise their Chinese\r\nTreaties as they must revise them after the world-war; for Japan\r\nin Manchuria is fundamentally in no different a position from\r\nEngland in the Yangtsze Valley and what applies to one must apply\r\nto the other. The new Chinese police which are being distributed\r\nin ever greater numbers throughout China form an admirable force\r\nand are superior to Japanese police in the performance of nearly\r\nall their duties. It is monstrous that Japan, as well as other\r\nPowers, should act in such a reprehensible manner when the Chinese\r\nadministration is doing all it can to provide efficient guardians\r\nof the peace.\r\n\r\nThe second case was one in which French officialdom by a curious\r\nact of folly gravely alienated Chinese sympathies and gave a\r\npowerful weapon to the German propaganda in China at the end of\r\n1916. The Lao-hsi-kai dispute, which involved a bare 333 acres of\r\nland in Tientsin, has now taken its place beside the Chengchiatun\r\naffair, and has become a leading case in that great dossier of\r\ngriefs which many Chinese declare make up the corpus of Euro-\r\nChinese relations. Here again the facts are absolutely simple and\r\nabsolutely undisputed. In 1902 the French consular authorities in\r\nTientsin filed a request to have their Concession extended on the\r\nground that they were becoming cramped. The Chinese authorities,\r\nalthough not wishing to grant the request and indeed ignoring it\r\nfor a long time, were finally induced to begin fitful\r\nnegotiations; and in October, 1916, after having passed through\r\nvarious processes of alteration, reduction, and re-statement\r\nduring the interval of fourteen years, the issue had been so fined\r\ndown that a virtual agreement regarding the administration of the\r\nnew area had been reached--an agreement which the Peking\r\nGovernment was prepared to put into force subject to one\r\nreasonable stipulation, that the local opposition to the new grant\r\nof territory which was very real, as Chinese feel passionately on\r\nthe subject of the police-control of their land-acreage, was first\r\novercome. The whole essence or soul of the disputes lay therein:\r\nthat the lords of the soil, the people of China, and in this case\r\nmore particularly the population of Tientsin, should accept the\r\ndecision arrived at which was that a joint Franco-Chinese\r\nadministration be established under a Chinese Chairman.\r\n\r\nWhen the terms of this proposed agreement were communicated to the\r\nTientsin Consulate by the French Legation the arrangement did not\r\nplease the French Consul-General, who was under transfer to\r\nShanghai and who proposed to settle the case to the satisfaction\r\nof his nationals before he left. There is absolutely no dispute\r\nabout this fact either--namely that the main pre-occupation of a\r\nconsular officer, charged primarily under the Treaties with the\r\nsimple preservation of law and order among his nationals, was the\r\nclosing-up of a vexatious outstanding case, by force if necessary,\r\nbefore he handed over his office to his successor. It was with\r\nthis idea that an ultimatum was drawn up by the French Consul\r\nGeneral and, having been weakly approved by the French Legation,\r\nwas handed to the Chinese local authorities. It gave them a time-\r\nlimit of twenty-four hours in which to effect the complete police\r\nevacuation of the coveted strip of territory on the ground that\r\nthe delay in the signature of a formal Protocol had been wilful\r\nand deliberate and had closed the door to further negotiations;\r\nand as no response came at the end of the time-limit, an open\r\ninvasion of Chinese territory was practised by an armed French\r\ndetachment; nine uniformed Chinese constables on duty being\r\nforcibly removed and locked up in French barracks and French\r\nsentries posted on the disputed boundary.\r\n\r\nThe result of this misguided action was an enormous Chinese outcry\r\nand the beginning of a boycott of the French in North China,--and\r\nthis in the middle of a war when France has acted with inspiring\r\nnobility. Some 2,000 native police, servants and employes promptly\r\ndeserted the French Concession en masse; popular unions were\r\nformed to keep alive resentment; and although in the end the\r\narrested police were set at liberty, the friendly intervention of\r\nthe Allies proved unable to effect a settlement of the case which\r\nat the moment of writing remains precisely where it was a year\r\nago. [Footnote: A further illustration of the action of French\r\ndiplomacy in China has just been provided (April, 1917) in the\r\nprotest lodged by France against the building of a railway in\r\nKwangsi Province by American engineers with American capital,--\r\nFrance claiming exclusive rights in Kwangsi by virtue of a letter\r\nsent by the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs to the French\r\nLegation in 1914 as settlement for a frontier dispute in that\r\nyear. The text of the letter is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The dispute that rose in consequence of the disturbance at the\r\nborder of Annam and Kwangsi has been examined into by the Joint\r\nCommittee detailed by both parties concerned, and a conclusion has\r\nbeen reached to the effect that all matters relating to the\r\nsolution of the case would be carried out in accordance with the\r\nrequest of Your Excellency.\r\n\r\n\"In order to demonstrate the especially good friendly relations\r\nexisting between the two countries, the Republican Government\r\nassures Your Excellency that in case a railway construction or a\r\nmining enterprise being undertaken in Kwangsi Province in the\r\nfuture, for which foreign capital is required, France would first\r\nbe consulted for a loan of the necessary capital. On such an\r\noccasion, the Governor of Kwangsi will directly negotiate with a\r\nFrench syndicate and report to the Government.\" It is high time\r\nthat the United States raises the whole question of the open door\r\nin China again, and refuses to tolerate any longer the old\r\ndisruptive and dog-in-the-manger policy of the Powers. America is\r\nnow happily in a position to inaugurate a new era in the Far East\r\nas in the Far West and to stop exploitation.]\r\n\r\nHere you have the matter of foreign interests in China explained\r\nin the sense that they appear to Chinese. It is not too much to\r\nsay that this illustration of the deliberate lawlessness, which\r\nhas too often been practised in the past by consuls who are simply\r\nJustices of the Peace, would be incredible elsewhere; and yet it\r\nis this lawlessness which has come to be accepted as part and\r\nparcel of what is called \"policy\" in China because in the fifty\r\nyears preceding the establishment of the Republic a weak and\r\neffeminate mandarinate consistently sought safety in surrenders.\r\nIt is this lawlessness which must at all costs be suppressed if we\r\nare to have a happy future. The Chinese people have so far\r\ncontented themselves by pacific retaliation and have not exploded\r\ninto rage; but those who see in the gospel of boycott an ugly\r\nmanifestation of what lies slumbering should give thanks nightly\r\nthat they live in a land where reason is so supreme. Think of what\r\nmight not happen in China if the people were not wholly\r\nreasonable! Throughout the length and breadth of the land you have\r\nsmall communities of foreigners, mere drops in a mighty ocean of\r\nfour hundred millions, living absolutely secure although\r\nabsolutely at the mercy of their huge swarms of neighbours. All\r\nsuch foreigners--or nearly all--have come to China for purposes of\r\nprofit; they depend for their livelihood on co-operation with the\r\nChinese; and once that co-operation ceases they might as well be\r\ndead and buried for all the good residence will do them. In such\r\ncircumstances it would be reasonable to suppose that a certain\r\ndecency would inspire their attitude, and that a policy of give-\r\nand-take would always be sedulously practised; and we are happy to\r\nsay that there is more of this than there used to be. It is only\r\nwhen incidents such as the Chengchiatun and Laihsikai affairs\r\noccur that the placid population is stirred to action. Even then,\r\ninstead of turning and rending the many little defenceless\r\ncommunities--as European mobs would certainly do--they simply\r\nconfine themselves to boycotting the offenders and hoping that\r\nthis evidence of their displeasure will finally induce the world\r\nto believe that they are determined to get reasonable treatment.\r\nThe Chinese as a people may be very irritating in the slowness\r\nwith which they do certain things--though they are as quick in\r\nbusiness as the quickest Anglo-Saxon--but that is no excuse why\r\nmen who call themselves superior should treat them with contempt.\r\nThe Chinese are the first to acknowledge that it will take them a\r\ngeneration at least to modernize effectively their country and\r\ntheir government; but they believe that having erected a Republic\r\nand having declared themselves as disciples of the West they are\r\njustified in expecting the same treatment and consideration which\r\nare to be given after the war even to the smallest and weakest\r\nnations of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCHINA AND THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of Chinese sentiments on the subject of the war, as\r\nwell as the precise relations between the Chinese Government and\r\nthe two groups of belligerents, are matters which have been\r\ntotally misunderstood. To those who have grasped the significance\r\nof the exhaustive preceding account of the Republic in travail,\r\nthis statement should not cause surprise; for China has been in no\r\ncondition to play anything but an insignificant and unsatisfactory\r\nrole in world-politics.\r\n\r\nWhen the world-war broke out China was still in the throes of her\r\ndomestic troubles and without any money at all in her Central\r\nTreasury; and although Yuan Shih-kai, on being suddenly confronted\r\nwith an unparalleled international situation, did initiate certain\r\nnegotiations with the German Legation with a view to securing a\r\ncancellation of the Kiaochow lease, the ultimatum which Japan\r\ndispatched to Germany on the 15th August, 1914, completely\r\nnullified his tentative proposals. Yuan Shih-kai had, indeed, not\r\nbeen in the slightest degree prepared for such a sensational\r\ndevelopment as war between Japan and Germany over the question of\r\na cruiser-base established on territory leased from China; and\r\nalthough he considered the possibility of sending a Chinese force\r\nto co-operate in the attack on the German stronghold, that project\r\nwas never matured, whilst his subsequent contrivances, notably the\r\nestablishment of a so-called war-zone in Shantung, were without\r\ninternational value, and attracted no attention save in Japan.\r\n\r\nChinese, however, did not remain blind to the trend of events.\r\nAfter the fall of Tsingtao and the subsequent complications with\r\nJapan, which so greatly served to increase the complexities of a\r\nnebulous situation, certain lines of thought insensibly developed.\r\nThat the influential classes in China should have desired that\r\nGermany should by some means rehabilitate herself in Europe and so\r\nbe placed in a position to chastise a nation that for twenty years\r\nhad brought nothing but sorrow to them was perhaps only natural;\r\nand it is primarily to this one cause that so-called sympathy with\r\nGermany during the first part of the war has been due. But it must\r\nalso be noticed that the immense German propaganda in China during\r\nthe first two years of the war, coupled with the successes won in\r\nRussia and elsewhere, powerfully impressed the population--not so\r\nmuch because they were attracted by the feats of a Power that had\r\nenthroned militarism, but because they wrongly supposed that\r\nsooner or later the effects of this military display would be not\r\nonly to secure the relaxation of the Japanese grip on the country\r\nbut would compel the Powers to re-cast their pre-war policies in\r\nChina and abandon their attempts at placing the country under\r\nfinancial supervision. Thus, by the irony of Fate, Germany in\r\nEastern Asia for the best part of 1914, 1915 and 1916, stood for\r\nthe aspirations of the oppressed--a moral which we may very\r\nreasonably hope will not escape the attention of the Foreign\r\nOffices of the world. Nor must it be forgotten that the modern\r\nChinese army, being like the Japanese, largely Germany-trained and\r\nGermany-armed, had a natural predilection for Teutonism; and since\r\nthe army, as we have shown, plays a powerful role in the politics\r\nof the Republic, public opinion was greatly swayed by what it\r\nproclaimed through its accredited organs.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, it was humanly impossible for such a vast\r\ncountry with such vast resources in men and raw materials to\r\nremain permanently quiescent during an universal conflagration\r\nwhen there was so much to be salvaged. Slowly the idea became\r\ngeneral in China that something had to be done; that is that a\r\nstate of technical neutrality would lead nowhere save possibly to\r\nAvernus.\r\n\r\nAs early as November, 1915, Yuan Shih-kai and his immediate\r\nhenchmen had indeed realized the internal advantages to be derived\r\nfrom a formal war-partnership with the signatories of the Pact of\r\nLondon, the impulse to the movement being given by certain\r\nimportant shipments of arms and ammunition from China which were\r\nthen made. A half-surreptitious attempt to discuss terms in Peking\r\ncaused no little excitement, the matter being, however, only\r\ndebated in very general terms. The principal item proposed by the\r\nPeking government was characteristically the stipulation that an\r\nimmediate loan of two million pounds should be made to China, in\r\nreturn for her technical belligerency. But when the proposal was\r\ntaken to Tokio, Japan rightly saw that its main purpose was simply\r\nto secure an indirect foreign endorsement of Yuan Shih-kai's\r\ncandidature as Emperor; and for that reason she threw cold-water\r\non the whole project. To subscribe to a formula, which besides\r\nenthroning Yuan Shih-kai would have been a grievous blow to her\r\nContinental ambitions, was an unthinkable thing; and therefore the\r\nmanoeuvre was foredoomed to failure.\r\n\r\nThe death of Yuan Shih-kai in the Summer of 1916 radically altered\r\nthe situation. Powerful influences were again set to work to stamp\r\nout the German cult and to incline the minority of educated men\r\nwho control the destinies of the country to see that their real\r\ninterests could only lie with the Allies, who were beginning to\r\nexport Chinese man-power as an auxiliary war-aid and who were very\r\nanxious to place the whole matter on a sounder footing. Little\r\nreal progress was, however, made in the face of the renewed German\r\nefforts to swamp the country with their propaganda. By means of\r\nwar-maps, printed in English and Chinese, and also by means of an\r\nexhaustive daily telegraphic service which hammered home every\r\npossible fact illustrative of German invincibility, the German\r\nposition in China, so far from being weakened, was actually\r\nstrengthened during the period when Rumania was being overrun. By\r\na singular destiny, any one advocating an alliance with the Allies\r\nwas bitterly attacked not only by the Germans but by the Japanese\r\nas well--this somewhat naive identification of Japan's political\r\ninterest with those of an enemy country being an unique feature of\r\nthe situation worthy of permanent record.\r\n\r\nIt was not until President Wilson sent out his Peace offering of\r\nthe 19th December, 1916, that a distant change came. On this\r\ndocument being formally communicated to the Chinese Government\r\ngreat interest was aroused, and the old hopes were revived that it\r\nwould be somehow possible for China to gain entry at the\r\ndefinitive Peace Congress which would settle beyond repeal the\r\nquestion of the disposal of Kiaochow and the whole of German\r\ninterests in Shantung Provinces,--a subject of burning interest to\r\nthe country not only because of the harsh treatment which had been\r\nexperienced at the hands of Japan, but because the precedent\r\nestablished in 1905 at the Portsmouth Treaty was one which it was\r\nfelt must be utterly shattered if China was not to abandon her\r\nclaim of being considered a sovereign international State. On that\r\noccasion Japan had simply negotiated direct with Russia concerning\r\nall matters affecting Manchuria, dispatching a Plenipotentiary to\r\nPeking, after the Treaty of Peace had been signed, to secure\r\nChina's adhesion to all clauses EN BLOC without discussion. True\r\nenough, by filing the Twenty-one Demands on China in 1915--when\r\nthe war was hardly half-a-year old--and by forcing China's assent\r\nto all Shantung questions under the threat of an Ultimatum, Japan\r\nhad reversed the Portsmouth Treaty procedure and apparently\r\nsettled the issues at stake for all time; nevertheless the Chinese\r\nhoped when the facts were properly known to the world that this\r\nspecies of diplomacy would not be endorsed, and that indeed the\r\nShantung question could be reopened.\r\n\r\nConsequently great pains were taken at the Chinese Foreign Office\r\nto draft a reply to the Wilson Note which would tell its own\r\nstory. The authorized translation of the document handed to the\r\nAmerican Legation on the 8th January has therefore a peculiar\r\npolitical interest. It runs as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I have examined with the care which the gravity of the question\r\ndemands the note concerning peace which President Wilson has\r\naddressed to the Governments of the Allies and the Central Powers\r\nnow at war and the text of which Your Excellency has been good\r\nenough to transmit to me under instructions of your Government.\r\n\r\n\"China, a nation traditionally pacific, has recently again\r\nmanifested her sentiments in concluding treaties concerning the\r\npacific settlement of international disputes, responding thus to\r\nthe voeux of the Peace Conference held at the Hague.\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, the present war, by its prolongation, has\r\nseriously affected the interests of China, more so perhaps than\r\nthose of other Powers which have remained neutral. She is at\r\npresent at a time of reorganization which demands economically and\r\nindustrially the co-operation of foreign countries, a co-operation\r\nwhich a large number of them are unable to accord on account of\r\nthe war in which they are engaged.\r\n\r\n\"In manifesting her sympathy for the spirit of the President's\r\nNote, having in view the ending as soon as possible of the\r\nhostilities, China is but acting in conformity not only with her\r\ninterests but also with her profound sentiments.\r\n\r\n\"On account of the extent which modern wars are apt to assume and\r\nthe repercussions which they bring about, their effects are no\r\nlonger limited to belligerent States. All countries are interested\r\nin seeing wars becoming as rare as possible. Consequently China\r\ncannot but show satisfaction with the views of the Government and\r\npeople of the United States of America who declare themselves\r\nready, and even eager, to co-operate when the war is over, by all\r\nproper means to assure the respect of the principle of the\r\nequality of nations, whatever their power may be, and to relieve\r\nthem of the peril of wrong and violence. China is ready to join\r\nher efforts with theirs for the attainment of such results which\r\ncan only be obtained through the help of all.\"\r\n\r\nAlready, then, before there had been any question of Germany's\r\nruthless submarine war necessitating a decisive move, China had\r\ncommenced to show that she could not remain passive during a\r\nworld-conflict which was indirectly endangering her interests.\r\nAmerica, by placing herself in direct communication with the\r\nPeking Government on the subject of a possible peace, had given a\r\ndirect hint that she was solicitous of China's future and\r\ndetermined to help her as far as possible. All this was in strict\r\naccordance with the traditional policy of the United States in\r\nChina, a policy which although too idealistic to have had much\r\npractical value--being too little supported by battleships and\r\nbayonets to be respected--has nevertheless for sixty years\r\ntempered the wind to the shorn lamb. The ground had consequently\r\nbeen well prepared for the remarkable denouement which came on the\r\n9th February, 1917, and which surprised all the world.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of that month the United States formally\r\ncommunicated with China on the subject of the threatened German\r\nsubmarine war against neutral shipping and invited her to\r\nassociate herself with America in breaking-off diplomatic\r\nrelations with Germany. China had meanwhile received a telegraphic\r\ncommunication from the Chinese Minister in Berlin transmitting a\r\nNote from the German Government making known the measures\r\nendangering all merchant vessels navigating the prescribed zones.\r\nThe effect of these two communications on the mind of the Chinese\r\nGovernment was at first admittedly stunning and very varied\r\nexpressions of opinion were heard in Peking. For the first time in\r\nthe history of the country the government had been invited to take\r\na step which meant the inauguration of a definite Foreign policy\r\nfrom which there could be no retreat. For four days a discussion\r\nraged which created the greatest uneasiness; but by the 8th\r\nFebruary, President Li Yuan-hung had made up his mind--the final\r\nproblem being simply the \"conversion\" of the Military Party to the\r\nidea that a decisive step, which would forever separate them from\r\nGermany, must at last be taken. It is known that the brilliant\r\nScholar Liang Ch'i-chao, who was hastily summoned to Peking,\r\nproved a decisive influence and performed the seemingly impossible\r\nin a few hours' discussion. Realizing at once the advantages which\r\nwould accrue from a single masculine decision he advised instant\r\naction in such a convincing way that the military leaders\r\nsurrendered. Accordingly on the 9th February the presence of the\r\nGerman Minister was requested at the Chinese Foreign Office when\r\nthe following Note was read to him and subsequently transmitted\r\ntelegraphically to Berlin.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency:\r\n\r\nA telegraphic communication has been received from the Chinese\r\nMinister at Berlin transmitting a note from the German Government\r\ndated February 1st, 1917, which makes known that the measures of\r\nblockade newly adopted by the Government of Germany will, from\r\nthat day, endanger neutral merchant vessels navigating in certain\r\nprescribed zones.\r\n\r\nThe new measures of submarine warfare, inaugurated by Germany,\r\nimperilling the lives and property of Chinese citizens to even a\r\ngreater extent than the measures previously taken which have\r\nalready cost so many human lives to China, constitute a violation\r\nof the principles of public international law at present in force;\r\nthe tolerance of their application would have as a result the\r\nintroduction into international law of arbitrary principles\r\nincompatible with even legitimate commercial intercourse between\r\nneutral states and between neutral states and belligerent powers.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government, therefore, protests energetically to the\r\nImperial German Government against the measures proclaimed on\r\nFebruary 1st, and sincerely hopes that with a view to respecting\r\nthe rights of neutral states and to maintaining the friendly\r\nrelations between these two countries, the said measures will not\r\nbe carried out.\r\n\r\nIn case, contrary to its expectations, its protest be ineffectual\r\nthe Government of the Chinese Republic will be constrained, to its\r\nprofound regret, to sever the diplomatic relations at present\r\nexisting between the two countries. It is unnecessary to add that\r\nthe attitude of the Chinese Government has been dictated purely by\r\nthe desire to further the cause of the world's peace and by the\r\nmaintenance of the sanctity of international law.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the\r\nassurance of my highest consideration.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the following reply was handed to the American\r\nMinister in Peking thus definitely clinching the matter:\r\n\r\nYour Excellency:\r\n\r\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's\r\nNote of the 4th February, 1917, informing me that the Government\r\nof the United States of America, in view of the adoption by the\r\nGerman Government of its new policy of submarine warfare on the\r\n1st of February, has decided to take certain action which it\r\njudges necessary as regards Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government, like the President of the United Slates of\r\nAmerica, is reluctant to believe that the German Government will\r\nactually carry into execution those measures which imperil the\r\nlives and property of citizens of neutral states and jeopardize\r\nthe commerce, even legitimate, between neutrals as well as between\r\nneutrals and belligerents and which tend, if allowed to be\r\nenforced without opposition, to introduce a new principle into\r\npublic international law.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government being in accord with the principles set\r\nforth in Your Excellency's note and firmly associating itself with\r\nthe Government of the United States, has taken similar action by\r\nprotesting energetically to the German Government against the new\r\nmeasures of blockade. The Chinese government also proposes to take\r\nsuch action in the future as will be deemed necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of the principles of international law.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the\r\nassurance of my highest consideration.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency Paul S. Reinsch, Envoy Extraordinary & Minister\r\nPlenipotentiary of The United States of America.\r\n\r\nWhen these facts became generally known an extraordinary ferment\r\nwas noticeable. What efforts had to be made to overcome the not\r\ninconsiderable opposition of the Military Party who were opposed\r\nto any departure from a policy of passive neutrality need not now\r\nbe set down; but it is sufficient to state that the decision\r\narrived at was in every sense a victory of the younger\r\nintellectual forces over the older mandarinate, whose traditions\r\nof laissez faire and spineless diplomacy had hitherto cost the\r\ncountry so dear. A definite and far-reaching Foreign Policy had at\r\nlast been inaugurated. By responding rapidly and firmly to the\r\ninvitation of the United States to associate herself with the\r\nstand taken against Germany's piratical submarine warfare, China\r\nhas undoubtedly won for herself a new place in the world's esteem.\r\nBoth in Europe and America the news of this development awakened\r\nwell-understandable enthusiasm, and convinced men that the\r\nRepublic at last stood for something vital and real. Until the 9th\r\nFebruary, 1917, what China had been doing was not really to\r\nmaintain her neutrality, since she had been unable to defend her\r\nterritory from being made a common battleground in 1914: she had\r\nbeen engaged in guarding and perpetuating her traditional\r\nimpotency. For whilst it may be accurate to declare--a fact which\r\nfew Westerners have realized--that to the mass of the Chinese\r\nnation the various members of the European Family are\r\nundistinguishable from one another, there being little to choose\r\nin China between a Russian or a German, an Englishman or an\r\nAustrian, a Frenchman or a Greek, the trade-contact of a century\r\nhad certainly taught to a great many that there was profit in\r\ncertain directions and none in certain others. It was perfectly\r\nwell-known, for instance, that England stood for a sea-empire;\r\nthat the sea was an universal road; that British ships, both\r\nmercantile and military, were the most numerous; and that other\r\nthings being equal it must primarily be Britain more than any\r\nother European country which would influence Chinese destinies.\r\nBut the British Alliance with Japan had greatly weakened the trust\r\nwhich originally existed; and this added to the fact that Germany,\r\nalthough completely isolated and imprisoned by the sea, still\r\nmaintained herself intact by reason of her marvellous war-machine,\r\nwhich had ploughed forward with such horrible results in a number\r\nof directions, had made inaction seem the best policy. And yet,\r\nalthough the Chinese may be pardoned for not forming clear\r\nconcepts regarding the rights and wrongs of the present conflict,\r\nthey had undoubtedly realized that it was absolutely essential for\r\nthem not to remain outside the circle of international friendships\r\nwhen a direct opportunity was offered them to step within.\r\n\r\nIt was a sudden inkling of these things which now dawned on the\r\npublic mind and slowly awakened enthusiasm. For the first time\r\nsince Treaty relations with the Powers had been established\r\nChinese diplomatic action had swept beyond the walls of Peking and\r\nembraced world-politics within its scope. The Confucianist\r\nconception of the State, as being simply a regional creation, a\r\nthing complete in itself and all sufficient because it was locked\r\nto the past and indifferent to the future, had hitherto been\r\nsupreme, foreign affairs being the result of unwilling contact at\r\nsea-ports or in the wastes of High Asia where rival empires meet.\r\nTo find Chinese--five years after the inauguration of their\r\nRepublic--ready to accept literally and loyally in the western way\r\nall the duties and obligations which their rights of eminent\r\ndomain confer was a great and fine discovery. It has been supposed\r\nby some that a powerful role was played in this business by the\r\ntemptation to benefit materially by an astute move: that is that\r\nChina was greatly influenced in her decision by the knowledge that\r\nthe denouncing of the German treaties would instantly suspend the\r\nGerman Boxer indemnity and pour into the depleted Central Treasury\r\na monthly surplus of nearly two million Mexican dollars.\r\nParadoxical as it may sound in a country notoriously hard-pressed\r\nfor cash, monetary considerations played no part whatever in\r\nconvincing the Peking Government that the hour for action had\r\narrived; nor again was there any question of real hostility to a\r\nnation which is so far removed from the East as to be meaningless\r\nto the masses. The deep, underlying, decisive influence was simply\r\nexpediency--the most subtle of all political reasons and the\r\nhardest to define. But just as Britain declared war because the\r\ninvasion of Belgium brought to a head all the vague grounds for\r\nopposition to German policy; and just as America broke off\r\nrelations because the scrapping of undertaking after undertaking\r\nregarding the sea-war made it imperative for her to act, so did\r\nChina choose the right moment to enunciate the doctrine of her\r\nindependence by voicing her determination to hold to the whole\r\ncorpus of international sanctions on which her independence\r\nfinally rests. In the last analysis, then, the Chinese note of the\r\n9th February to the German Government was a categorical and\r\nunmistakable reply to all the insidious attempts which had been\r\nmade since the beginning of the war to place her outside and\r\nbeyond the operation of the Public Law of Europe; and it is solely\r\nand entirely in that light that her future actions must be judged.\r\nThe leaders who direct the destinies of China became fully\r\nprepared for a state of belligerency from the moment they decided\r\nto speak; but they could not but be supremely anxious concerning\r\nthe expression of that belligerency, since their international\r\nposition had for years been such that a single false move might\r\ncripple them.\r\n\r\nLet us make this clear. Whilst China has been from the first fully\r\nprepared to co-operate with friendly Powers in the taking of war-\r\nmeasures which would ultimately improve her world-position, she\r\nhas not been prepared to surrender the initiative in these matters\r\ninto foreign hands. The argument that the mobilization of her\r\nresources could only be effectively dealt with by specially\r\ndesignated foreigners, for instance, has always been repellent to\r\nher because she knows from bitter experience that although Japan\r\nhas played little or no part in the war, and indeed classifies\r\nherself as a semi-belligerent, the Tokio Government would not\r\nhesitate to use any opportunity which presented itself in China\r\nfor selfish ends; and by insisting that as she is on the spot she\r\nis the most competent to insure the effectiveness of Chinese co-\r\noperation, attempt to tighten her hold on the country. It is a\r\nfact which is self-evident to observers on the spot that ever\r\nsince the coup of the Twenty-one Demands, many Japanese believe\r\nthat their country has succeeded in almost completely infeodating\r\nChina and has became the sovereign arbitrator of all quarrels, as\r\nwell as the pacificator of the Eastern World. Statements which\r\nwere incautiously allowed to appear in the Japanese Press a few\r\ndays prior to the Chinese Note of the 9th February disclose what\r\nJapan really thought on the subject of China identifying herself\r\nwith the Allies. For instance, the following, which bears the\r\nhall-mark of official inspiration, reads very curiously in the\r\nlight of after-events:\r\n\r\n... \"Dispatches from Peking say that England and France have\r\nalready started a flanking movement to induce China to join the\r\nanti-German coalition. The intention of the Chinese Government has\r\nnot yet been learned. But it is possible that China will agree, if\r\nconditions are favourable, thus gaining the right to voice her\r\nviews at the coming peace conference. Should the Entente Powers\r\ngive China a firm guarantee, it is feared here that China would\r\nnot hesitate to act.\r\n\r\n\"The policy of the Japanese Government toward this question cannot\r\nyet be learned. It appears, however, that the Japanese Government\r\nis not opposed to applying the resolutions of the Paris Economic\r\nConference, in so far as they concern purely economic questions,\r\nsince Japan desires that German influence in the commerce and\r\nfinance of the Orient should be altogether uprooted. But should\r\nthe Entente Powers of Europe try to induce China to join them,\r\nJapan may object on the ground that it will create more\r\ndisturbances in China and lead to a general disturbance of peace\r\nin the Orient.\"\r\n\r\nNow there is not the slightest doubt in the writer's mind--and he\r\ncan claim to speak as a student of twenty years' standing--that\r\nthis definition of Japanese aims and objects is a very true one;\r\nand that the subsequent invitation to China to join the Allies\r\nwhich came from Tokio after a meeting between the Japanese\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs and the Allied Ambassadors was simply\r\nmade when a new orientation of policy had been forced by stress of\r\ncircumstances. Japan has certainly always wished German influence\r\nin the Far East to be uprooted if she can take the place of\r\nGermany; but if she cannot take that place absolutely and entirely\r\nshe would vastly prefer the influence to remain, since it is in\r\nthe nature of counterweight to that of other European Powers and\r\nof America--foreign influence in China, as Mr. Hioki blandly told\r\nthe late President Yuan Shih-kai in his famous interview of the\r\n18th January, 1915, being a source of constant irritation to the\r\nJapanese people, and the greatest stumbling-block to a permanent\r\nunderstanding in the Far East.\r\n\r\nChinese suspicion of any invitation coming by way of Tokyo has\r\nbeen, therefore, in every way justified, if it is a reasonable and\r\nlegitimate thing for a nation of four hundred millions of people\r\nto be acutely concerned about their independence; for events have\r\nalready proved up to the hilt that so far from the expulsion of\r\nGermany from Shantung having resulted in the handing-back of\r\ninterests which were forcibly acquired from China in 1898, that\r\nexpulsion has merely resulted in Japan succeeding to such\r\ninterests and thereby obliterating all trace of her original\r\npromise to the world in 1914 that she would restore to China what\r\nwas originally taken from her. Here it is necessary to remark that\r\nnot only did Japan in her negotiations over the Twenty-one Demands\r\nforce China to hand over the twelve million pounds of German\r\nimprovements in Shantung province, but that Baron Hayashi, the\r\npresent Japanese Minister to China, \"has recently declared that\r\nJapan would demand from China a vast settlement or concession at\r\nTsingtao, thus making even the alleged handing-back of the leased\r\nterritory--which Japan is pledged to force from Germany at the\r\nPeace Conference--wholly illusory, the formula of a Settlement\r\nbeing adopted because twelve years' experience of Port Arthur has\r\nshown that territorial \"leases,\" with their military garrisons and\r\nadministrative offices, are expensive and antiquated things, and\r\nthat it is easier to push infiltration by means of a multitude of\r\nSettlements in which police-boxes and policemen form an important\r\nelement, than to cut off slices of territory under a nomenclature\r\nwhich is a clamant advertisement of disruptive aims.\r\n\r\nNow although these matters appear to be taking us far from the\r\nparticular theme we are discussing, it is not really so. Like a\r\ndark thunder-cloud on the horizon the menace of Japanese action\r\nhas rendered frank Chinese co-operation, even in such a simple\r\nmatter as war-measures against Germany, a thing of supreme\r\ndifficulty. The mere rumour that China might dispatch an\r\nExpeditionary Force to Mesopotamia was sufficient to send the host\r\nof unofficial Japanese agents in Peking scurrying in every\r\ndirection and insisting that if the Chinese did anything at all\r\nthey should limit themselves to sending troops to Russia where\r\nthey would be \"lost\"--a suggestion made because that was what\r\nJapan herself offered to do when she declined in 1915 the Allies'\r\nproposal to dispatch troops to Europe. Nor must the fact be lost\r\nsight of that as in other countries so in China, foreign affairs\r\nprovide an excellent opportunity for influencing the march of\r\ninternal events. Thus, as we have clearly shown, the Military\r\nParty, although originally averse to any action at all, saw that a\r\nstrong foreign policy would greatly enhance its reputation and\r\nallow it to influence the important elections for the Parliament\r\nof 1918 which, sitting as a National Convention, will elect the\r\nnext President. Thus, in the extraordinary way which happens\r\nthroughout the world, the whole of February was consumed in the\r\nrival political parties manoeuvring for position, the Vice-\r\nPresident, General Feng Kuo-chang, himself coming hastily to\r\nPeking from Nanking to take part in this elaborate game in which\r\nmany were now participating merely for what they could get out of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th March matters were brought to a climax by an open\r\nbreach between President Li Yuan-hung and the Premier, General\r\nTuan Chi-jui, at a Cabinet meeting regarding the procedure to be\r\nobserved in breaking off diplomatic relations with Germany.\r\nAlthough nearly a month had elapsed, no reply had been received\r\nfrom Berlin; and of the many plans of action proposed nothing had\r\nbeen formally decided. Owing to the pressure Japan was exerting\r\nfrom Tokio to get China to come to a definite arrangement, popular\r\nanxiety was growing. Over the question of certain telegrams to be\r\ncommunicated to the Japanese Government, of which he had been kept\r\nin ignorance, President Li Yuan-hung took a firm stand; with the\r\nresult that the Premier, deeply offended, abruptly left the\r\nCouncil Chamber, handed in his resignation and left the capital--a\r\ncourse of action which threatened to provoke a national crisis.\r\n\r\nFortunately in President Li Yuan-hung China had a cool and\r\ndispassionate statesman. At the first grave crisis in his\r\nadministration he wished at all costs to secure that the assent of\r\nParliament should be given to all steps taken, and that nothing so\r\nspeculative as a policy which had not been publicly debated should\r\nbe put into force. He held to this point doggedly; and after some\r\nnegotiations, the Premier was induced to return to the capital and\r\nresume office, on the understanding that nothing final was to be\r\ndone until a popular endorsement had been secured.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th March the question was sent to Parliament for\r\ndecision. After a stormy debate of several hours in the Lower\r\nHouse the policy of the Government was upheld by 330 votes to 87:\r\non the following day the Senate endorsed this decision by 158\r\nvotes to 37. By a coincidence which was too extraordinary not to\r\nhave been artificially contrived, the long-awaited Germany reply\r\narrived on the morning of this 10th March, copies of the document\r\nbeing circulated wholesale by German agents among the Members of\r\nParliament in a last effort to influence their decision. The\r\nactual text of the German reply was as follows, and it will be\r\nseen how transparently worded it is:\r\n\r\nTo the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China:\r\n\r\nYOUR EXCELLENCY: By the instructions of my home Government--which\r\nreached me on the 10th inst.--I beg to forward you the following\r\nreply to China's protest to the latest blockade policy of\r\nGermany:--\r\n\r\n\"The Imperial German Government expresses its great surprise at\r\nthe action threatened by the Government of the Republic of China\r\nin its Note of protest. Many other countries have also protested,\r\nbut China, which has been in friendly relations with Germany, is\r\nthe only State which has added a threat to its protest. The\r\nsurprise is doubly great, because of the fact that, as China has\r\nno shipping interests in the seas of the barred zones, she will\r\nnot suffer thereby.\r\n\r\n\"The Government of the Republic of China mentions that loss of\r\nlife of Chinese citizens has occurred as the results of the\r\npresent method of war. The Imperial German Government wishes to\r\npoint out that the Government of the Republic of China has never\r\ncommunicated with the Imperial Government regarding a single case\r\nof this kind nor has it protested in this connexion before.\r\nAccording to reports received by the Imperial Government, such\r\nlosses as have been actually sustained by Chinese subjects have\r\noccurred in the firing line while they were engaged in digging\r\ntrenches and in other war services. While thus engaged, they were\r\nexposed to the dangers inevitable to all forces engaged in war.\r\nThe fact that Germany has on several occasions protested against\r\nthe employment of Chinese citizens for warlike purpose is evident\r\nthat the Imperial Government has given excellent proof of its\r\nfriendly feelings toward China. In consideration of these friendly\r\nrelations the Imperial Government is willing to treat the matter\r\nas if the threat had never been uttered. It is reasonable for the\r\nImperial Government to expect that the Government of the Republic\r\nof China will revise its views respecting the question.\r\n\r\n\"Germany's enemies were the first to declare a blockade on Germany\r\nand the same is being persistently carried out. It is therefore\r\ndifficult for Germany to cancel her blockade policy. The Imperial\r\nGovernment is nevertheless willing to comply with the wishes of\r\nthe Government of the Republic of China by opening negotiations to\r\narrive at a plan for the protection of Chinese life and property,\r\nwith the view that the end may be achieved and thereby the utmost\r\nregard be given to the shipping rights of China. The reason which\r\nhas prompted the Imperial Government to adopt this conciliatory\r\npolicy is the knowledge that, once diplomatic relations are\r\nsevered with Germany, China will not only lose a truly good friend\r\nbut will also be entangled in unthinkable difficulties.\"\r\n\r\nIn forwarding to Your Excellency the above instructions from my\r\nhome Government, I beg also to state that--if the Government of\r\nChina be willing--I am empowered to open negotiations for the\r\nprotection of the shipping rights of China.\r\n\r\nI have the honour to be. ... (Signed by the German Minister.)\r\nMarch 10, 1917.\r\n\r\nWith a Parliamentary endorsement behind them there remained\r\nnothing for the Peking Government but to take the vital step of\r\nsevering diplomatic relations. Certain details remained to be\r\nsettled but these were expeditiously handled. Consequently,\r\nwithout any further discussion, at noon on the 14th March the\r\nGerman Minister was handed his passports, with the following\r\ncovering dispatch from the Chinese Foreign Office. It is worthy of\r\nrecord that in the interval between the Chinese Note of the 9th\r\nFebruary and the German reply of the 10th March the French mail-\r\nsteamer Athos had been torpedoed in the Mediterranean and five\r\nhundred Chinese labourers proceeding to France on board her\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\nYour Excellency:--\r\n\r\nWith reference to the new submarine policy of Germany, the\r\nGovernment of the Republic of China, dictated by the desire to\r\nfurther the cause of world's peace and to maintain the sanctity of\r\nInternational Law, addressed a protest to Your Excellency on\r\nFebruary 9th and declared that in case, contrary to its\r\nexpectations its protest be ineffectual, it would be constrained\r\nto sever the diplomatic relations at present existing between the\r\ntwo countries.\r\n\r\nDuring the lapse of a month no heed has been paid to the protest\r\nof the Government of the Republic in the activities of the German\r\nSubmarines, activities which have caused the loss of many Chinese\r\nlives. On March 10, a reply was received from Your Excellency.\r\nAlthough it states that the Imperial German Government is willing\r\nto open negotiations to arrive at a plan for the protection of\r\nChinese life and property, yet it declares that it is difficult\r\nfor Germany to cancel her blockade policy. It is therefore not in\r\naccord with the object of the protest and the Government of the\r\nChinese Republic, to its deep regret, considers its protest to be\r\nineffectual. The Government of the Republic is constrained to\r\nsever the diplomatic relations at present existing with the\r\nImperial German Government. I have the honour to send herewith to\r\nYour Excellency, the passport for Your Excellency, the members of\r\nthe German Legation and their families and retinue for protection\r\nwhile leaving Chinese territory. With regard to the Consular\r\nOfficers of Germany in China, this Ministry has instructed the\r\ndifferent Commissioners of Foreign Affairs to issue to them\r\nsimilarly passports for leaving the country.\r\n\r\nI avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the\r\nassurance of my highest consideration.\r\n\r\nMarch 14th, 1917.\r\n\r\nIt was not until eleven days later--on the 25th March--that the\r\nGerman Minister and his suite reluctantly left Peking for Germany\r\nvia America. Meanwhile the Chinese Government remained undecided\r\nregarding the taking of the final step as a number of important\r\nmatters had still to be settled. Not only had arrangements to be\r\nmade with the Allies but there was the question of adjusting\r\nChinese policy with American action. A special commission on\r\nDiplomatic affairs daily debated the procedure to be observed, but\r\nowing to the conflict of opinion in the provinces further action\r\nwas greatly delayed. As it is necessary to show the nature of this\r\nconflict we give two typical opinions submitted to the Government\r\non the question of a formal declaration of war against Germany\r\n(and Austria). The first Memorandum was written for the Diplomatic\r\nCommission by the scholar Liang Ch'i-chao and is singularly\r\nlucid:--\r\n\r\nTHE NECESSITY FOR WAR\r\n\r\n\"Those who question the necessity for war can only quote the\r\nattitude of America as example. The position of China is, however,\r\ndifferent from that of America in two points. First, actual\r\nwarfare will follow immediately after America's declaration of\r\nwar, so it is necessary for her to make the necessary preparations\r\nbefore taking the step. For this purpose, America has voted\r\nseveral hundred million dollars for an increase of her naval\r\nappropriations. America therefore cannot declare war until she has\r\ncompleted every preparation. With China it is different. Even\r\nafter the declaration of war, there will be no actual warfare. It\r\nis therefore unnecessary for us to wait.\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, America has no such things as foreign settlements,\r\nconsular jurisdiction or other un-equal treaties with Germany.\r\nUnder the existing conditions America has no difficulties in\r\nsafeguarding herself against the Germans residing in America after\r\nthe severance of diplomatic relations even though war has not yet\r\nbeen actually declared, and as to future welfare, America will\r\nhave nothing to suffer even though her old treaties with Germany\r\nshould continue to be operative. It is impossible for China to\r\ntake the necessary steps to safeguard the country against the\r\nGermans residing in China unless the old treaties be cancelled.\r\nFor unless war is declared it is impossible to cancel the consular\r\njurisdiction of the Germans, and so long as German consular\r\njurisdiction remains in China we will meet with difficulties\r\neverywhere whenever we wish to deal with the Germans. If our\r\nfuture is to be considered, unless war is declared, the old\r\ntreaties will again come into force upon the resumption of\r\ndiplomatic relations, in which case we shall be held responsible\r\nfor all the steps which we have taken in contravention of treaties\r\nduring the rupture. It will be advantageous to China if the old\r\ntreaties be cancelled by a declaration of war and new treaties be\r\nnegotiated after the conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\n\"In short by severing diplomatic relations with Germany China has\r\nalready incurred the ill-feelings of that country. We shall not be\r\nable to lessen the hostile feelings of the Germans even if we\r\nrefrain from declaring war on them. It is therefore our obligation\r\nto choose the course that will be advantageous to us. This is not\r\nreluctantly yielding to the request of the Entente Allies. It is\r\nthe course we must take in our present situation.\r\n\r\nTHE REASON FOR DECLARING WAR\r\n\r\n\"The presumptuous manner in which Germany has replied to our\r\ndemand is an open affront to our national integrity. Recently\r\nGermany has deliberately shown hostility to our advice by\r\nreiterating her determination to carry out the ruthless submarine\r\npolicy with increased vigour. All these are reasons for diplomatic\r\nrupture as well as for declaration of war. Furthermore, the peace\r\nof the Far East was broken by the occupation of Kiachow by\r\nGermany. This event marked the first step of the German disregard\r\nfor international law. In the interests of humanity and for the\r\nsake of what China has passed through, she should rise and punish\r\nsuch a country, that dared to disregard international law. Such a\r\nreason for war is certainly beyond criticism.\r\n\r\nTHE TIME TO DECLARE WAR\r\n\r\n\"War should be declared as soon as possible. The reason for the\r\ndiplomatic rupture is sufficient reason for declaring war. This\r\nhas already been explained. It would be impossible for us to find\r\nan excuse for declaring war if war be declared now. According to\r\nusual procedure war is declared when the forces of the two\r\ncountries come into actual conflict. Now such a possibility does\r\nnot exist between China and Germany. Since it is futile to expect\r\nGermany to declare war on us first, we should ask ourselves if war\r\nis necessary. If not, then let us go on as we are, otherwise we\r\nmust not hesitate any more.\r\n\r\n\"Some say that China should not declare war on Germany until we\r\nhave come to a definite understanding with the Entente Allies\r\nrespecting certain terms. This is indeed a wrong conception of\r\nthings. We declare war because we want to fight for humanity,\r\ninternational law and against a national enemy. It is not because\r\nwe are partial towards the Entente or against Germany or Austria.\r\nInternational relations are not commercial connexions. Why then\r\nshould we talk about exchange of privileges and rights? As to the\r\nrevision of Customs tariff, it has been our aspiration for more\r\nthan ten years and a foremost diplomatic question, for which we\r\nhave been looking for a suitable opportunity to negotiate with the\r\nforeign Powers. It is our view that the opportunity has come\r\nbecause foreign Powers are now on very friendly terms with China.\r\nIt is distinctly a separate thing from the declaration of war. Let\r\nno one try to confuse the two.\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF AUSTRIA\r\n\r\n\"If China decides to declare war on Germany the same attitude\r\nshould be taken towards Austria. We have severed diplomatic\r\nrelations with Germany but retain the status quo with Austria.\r\nThis is fraught with danger. German intrigue is to be dreaded.\r\nWhat they have done in America and Mexico is enough to shock us.\r\nThe danger can easily be imagined when we remember that they have\r\nin China the Austrian Legation, Austrian Consulates and Austrian\r\nconcessions as their bases of operation for intrigue and plotting.\r\nSome say we should follow America, which has not yet severed\r\ndiplomatic relations with Austria. This is a great mistake.\r\nAmerica can afford to ignore Austria because there are no Austrian\r\nconcessions and Austrian consular jurisdiction in America.\r\n\r\n\"The question is then what steps should be taken to sever\r\ndiplomatic relations with and declare war on Austria. The solution\r\nis that since Austria has also communicated to our Minister\r\nregarding her submarine policy we can serve her with an ultimatum\r\ndemanding that the submarine policy be cancelled within twenty-\r\nfour hours. If Austria refuses, China may sever diplomatic\r\nrelations and declare war at the same time immediately upon the\r\nexpiry of the twenty-four hour limit.\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion I wish to say that whenever a policy is adopted we\r\nshould carry out the complete scheme. If we should hesitate in the\r\nmiddle and become afraid to go ahead we will soon find ourselves\r\nin an embarrassing position. The Government and Parliament should\r\ntherefore stir up courage and boldly make the decision and take\r\nthe step.\r\n\r\nUnanswerable as seem these arguments to the Western mind, they\r\nwere by no means so to the mass of Chinese who are always fearful\r\nlest some sudden reshuffling in the relationships existing between\r\nforeign Powers exposes them to new and greater calamities. This\r\nChinese viewpoint, with its ignorance of basic considerations, is\r\nwell-illustrated by the Second Memorandum, which follows. Written\r\nby the famous reformer of 1898 Kang Yu-wei, it demonstrates how\r\ngreatly the revolutionists of 1911 are in advance of a school\r\nwhich was the vogue less than twenty years ago and which is\r\ncompletely out of touch with the thought which the war has made\r\nworld-wide. Nevertheless the line of argument which characterizes\r\nthis utterance is still a political factor in China and must be\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n... \"The breach between the United States and Germany is no\r\nconcern of ours. But the Government suddenly severed diplomatic\r\nrelations with Germany and is now contemplating entry into the\r\nwar. This is to advance beyond the action of the United States\r\nwhich continues to observe neutrality. And if we analyse the\r\npublic opinion of the country, we find that all peoples--high and\r\nlow, well-informed and ignorant--betray great alarm when informed\r\nof the rupture and the proposal to declare war on Germany, fearing\r\nthat such a development may cause grave peril to the country. This\r\nwar-policy is being urged by a handful of politicians, including a\r\nfew members of Parliament and several party men with the view of\r\ncreating a diplomatic situation to serve their political ends and\r\nto reap great profits.\r\n\r\n\"Their arguments are that China--by siding with the Entente--may\r\nobtain large loans, the revision of the Customs Tariff and the\r\nsuspension of the Boxer indemnity to Germany, as well as the\r\nrecovery of the German concessions, mining and railroad rights and\r\nthe seizure of German commerce. Pray, how large is Germany's share\r\nof the Boxer indemnity? Seeing that German commerce is protected\r\nby international law, will China be able to seize it; and does she\r\nnot know that the Kaiser may in the future exact restitution?\r\n\r\nPERILS OF WAR\r\n\r\n\"News from Holland tells of a rumoured secret understanding\r\nbetween Germany, Japan and Russia. The Japanese Government is\r\npursuing a policy of friendship toward Germany. This is very\r\ndisquieting news to us. As to foreign loans and the revision of\r\nthe Customs Tariff, we can raise these matters at any time. Why\r\nthen should we traffic for these things at the risk of grave\r\ndangers to the nation? My view is that what we are to obtain from\r\nthe transaction is far less than what we are to give. If it be\r\nargued that the policy aims at securing for China her right to\r\nlive as an unfettered nation, then we ought to ask for the\r\ncancellation of the entire Boxer Indemnities, the abolition of\r\nexterritoriality, the retrocession of the foreign concessions and\r\nthe repeal or amendment of all unjust treaties after the war. But\r\nnone of these have we demanded. If we ourselves cannot improve our\r\ninternal administration in order to become a strong country, it is\r\nabsurd to expect our admission to the ranks of the first-class\r\nPowers simply by being allowed a seat at the Peace Conference and\r\nby taking a side with the Entente!\r\n\r\n\"Which side will win the war? I shall not attempt to predict here.\r\nBut it is undoubted that all the arms of Europe--and the\r\nindustrial and financial strength of the United States and Japan--\r\nhave proved unavailing against Germany. On the other hand France\r\nhas lost her Northern provinces and Belgium, Serbia and Rumania\r\nare blotted off the map. Should Germany be victorious, the whole\r\nof Europe--not to speak of a weak country like China--would be in\r\ngreat peril of extinction. Should she be defeated, Germany still\r\ncan--after the conclusion of peace--send a fleet to war against\r\nus. And as the Powers will be afraid of a second world-war, who\r\nwill come to our aid? Have we not seen the example of Korea? There\r\nis no such thing as an army of righteousness which will come to\r\nthe assistance of weak nations. I cannot bear to think of hearing\r\nthe angry voice of German guns along our coasts!\r\n\r\n\"If we allow the Entente to recruit labour in our country without\r\nrestriction, thousands upon thousands of our fellow countrymen\r\nwill die for no worthy cause; and if we allow free exportation of\r\nfoodstuff, in a short time the price of daily necessaries will\r\nmount ten to a hundredfold. This is calculated to cause internal\r\ntroubles. Yea, all gains from this policy will go to the\r\npoliticians but the people will suffer the evil consequences\r\nthrough no fault of theirs.\r\n\r\nDIPLOMACY OF CONFUCIUS\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of diplomacy, we do not need to go to the West for\r\nthe apt learning on the point at issue. Confucius had said: 'Be\r\ntruthful and cultivate friendship--this is the foundation of human\r\nhappiness.' Our country being weak and undeveloped, if we strive\r\nto be truthful and cultivate friendship, we can still be a\r\ncivilized nation, albeit hoary with age. But we are now advised to\r\ntake advantage of the difficulties of Germany and abandon honesty\r\nin order that we may profit thereby. Discarding treaties is to be\r\nunfaithful, grasping for gains is not the way of a gentleman,\r\ntaking advantage of another's difficulties is to be mean and\r\njoining the larger in numbers is cowardice. How can we be a\r\nnation, if we throw away all these fundamental qualities.\r\n\r\n\"Even in the press of England and the United States, there is\r\nopposition to America entering the war. If we observe neutrality,\r\nwe are not bound to any side; and when the time comes for peace--\r\nas a friend to both sides--we may be able to bring about the ends\r\nof the war. Is this not a service to humanity and the true spirit\r\nof civilization?\r\n\r\n\"Now it is proposed to take the existence of this great nation of\r\nfive thousand years and four hundred million people in order to\r\nserve the interests of politicians in their party struggles. We\r\nare now to be bound to foreign nations, without freedom to act for\r\nourselves and running great risks of national destruction. Can you\r\ngentlemen bear to see this come to pass? China has severed\r\nrelations with Germany but the decision for war has not yet been\r\nreached. The whole country is telegraphing opposition to the\r\nGovernment's policy and wants to know whether Germany will not in\r\nthe future take revenge on account of our rupture with her; and if\r\nwe are not secured against this eventuality, what are the\r\npreparations to meet with a contingency? The Government must not\r\nstake the fate of the nation as if it be a child's toy, and the\r\npeople must not be cast into the whirlpool of slaughter. The\r\npeople are the backbone of a country, and if the people are all\r\nopposed to war on Germany, the Government--in spite of the support\r\nof Parliament--must call a great citizens' convention to decide\r\nthe question. We must persist in our neutrality. You gentlemen are\r\npatriotic sons of this country and must know that the existence of\r\nChina as a nation depends upon what she does now in this matter.\r\nIn tears, I appeal to you. KANG YU-WEI.\"\r\n\r\nMarch and April were consumed in this fruitless discussion in\r\nwhich everybody participated. The Premier, General Tuan Chi-jui,\r\nin view of the alleged provincial opposition, now summoned to\r\nPeking a Conference of Provincial Military Governors to endorse\r\nhis policy, but this action although crowned with success so far\r\nas the army chiefs were concerned--the conference voting solidly\r\nfor war--was responsible for greatly alarming Parliament which saw\r\nin this procedure a new attempt to undermine its power and control\r\nthe country by extra-legal means. Furthermore, publication in the\r\nMetropolitan press of what the Japanese were doing behind the\r\nscenes created a fear that extraordinary intrigues were being\r\nindulged in with the object of securing by means of secret\r\ndiplomacy certain guarantees of a personal nature. Apart from\r\nbeing associated with the semi-official negotiations of the\r\nEntente Powers in Peking, Japan was carrying on a second set of\r\nnegotiations partly by means of a confidential agent named Kameio\r\nNishihara dispatched from Tokio specially for that purpose by\r\nCount Terauchi, the Japanese Premier, a procedure which led to the\r\ncirculation of highly sensational stories regarding China's future\r\ncommitments. When the Premier, General Tuan Chi-jui, had made his\r\nstatement to Parliament on the 10th March, regarding the necessity\r\nof an immediate rupture with Germany, he had implied that China\r\nhad already received assurances from the Allies that there would\r\nbe a postponement of the Boxer Indemnities for a term of years, an\r\nimmediate increase in the Customs Tariff, and a modification of\r\nthe Peace Protocol of 1901 regarding the presence of Chinese\r\ntroops near Tientsin. Suddenly all these points were declared to\r\nbe in doubt. Round the question of the length of time the\r\nIndemnities might be postponed, and the actual amount of the\r\nincrease in the Customs Tariff, there appeared to be an\r\ninexplicable muddle largely owing to the intervention of so many\r\nagents and to the fact that the exchange of views had been almost\r\nentirely verbal, unofficial, and secret. It would be wearisome to\r\nanalyse a dispute which belongs to the peculiar atmosphere of\r\nPeking diplomacy; but the vast difficulties of making even a\r\nsimple decision in China were glaringly illustrated by this\r\nmatter. With a large section of the Metropolitan press daily\r\ninsisting that the future of democracy in China would be again\r\nimperilled should the Military Party have its own way, small\r\nwonder if the question of a formal declaration of war on Germany\r\n(and Austria) now assumed an entirely different complexion.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st May, in spite of all these trials and tribulations,\r\nbeing pressed by the Premier to do so, the Cabinet unanimously\r\ndecided that a declaration of war was imperative; and on the 7th\r\nMay, after an agreement with the President had been reached,\r\nParliament received the following dispatch--this method of\r\ncommunication being the usual one between the executive and\r\nlegislative branches of the Government:\r\n\r\nThe President has the honour to communicate to the House of\r\nRepresentatives the following proposal. Since the severance of\r\ndiplomatic relations with Germany, Germany has continued to\r\nviolate the rights of the neutral nations and to damage and cause\r\nlosses in life and property to our people as well as to trample on\r\ninternational law and disregard principles of humanity. For the\r\npurpose of hastening peace, upholding international law and\r\nprotecting the life and property of our people, the President is\r\nof the view that it is necessary to declare war on the German\r\nGovernment. In accordance with Article 35 of the Provisional\r\nConstitution, he now asks for the approval of the House, and\r\ndemands--in accordance with Article 21 of the Provisional\r\nConstitution--that the meeting in the House be held in secret.\r\n\r\nOn 8th May, after hearing a statement made in person by the\r\nPremier, the House of Representatives in secret session referred\r\nthe question for examination to the House sitting as a Committee\r\nin order to gain time to make up its mind. On the same day the\r\nSenate sat on the same question. A very heated and bitter\r\ndiscussion followed in the upper House, not because of any real\r\ndisagreement regarding the matter at issue, but because a large\r\nsection of Senators were extremely anxious regarding the internal\r\nconsequences. This is well-explained by the following written\r\ninterpellation which was addressed to the government by a large\r\nnumber of parliamentarians:\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, hereby address this interpellation to the\r\nGovernment. As a declaration of war on Germany has become an\r\nobject of the foreign policy of the Government, the latter has\r\nheld informal meetings to ascertain the views of parliament on the\r\nquestion; and efforts are being made by the Government to secure\r\nthe unanimous support of both Houses for its war policy. In\r\npursuing this course, the Government appears to believe that its\r\ncall for support will be readily complied with by the Houses. But\r\nin our view there are quite a number of members in both Houses who\r\nfail thoroughly to understand the war decision of the Government.\r\nThe reason for this is that, according to recent reports, both\r\nforeign and vernacular, the Government has entered into secret\r\ntreaties with a \"neighbouring country.\" It is also reported that\r\nsecret agents on both sides are active and are travelling between\r\nthe two countries. The matter seems to be very grave; and it has\r\nalready attracted the attention of Parliament, which in the near\r\nfuture will discuss the war-issue.\r\n\r\nBeing in doubt as to the truth of such a report, we hereby request\r\nthe Government for the necessary information in the matter. We\r\nalso beg to suggest that, if there is any secret diplomatic\r\nagreement, we consider it expedient for the Government to submit\r\nthe matter to Parliament for the latter's consideration. This will\r\nenable the members in Parliament to study the question with care\r\nand have a clear understanding of the matter. When this is done,\r\nParliament will be able to support the Government in the\r\nprosecution of its war policy according to the dictates of\r\nconscience. In this event both Parliament and Government will be\r\nable to co-operate with each other in the solution of the present\r\ndiplomatic problem. Troubled not a little with the present\r\ndiplomatic situation of the country, we hereby address this\r\ninterpellation to the Government in accordance with law. It is\r\nhoped that an answer from the Government will be dispatched to us\r\nwithin three days from date.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th May Parliament met in secret session and it was plain\r\nthat a crisis had come. Members of the House of Representatives\r\nexperienced great difficulties in forcing their way through a mob\r\nof several thousand roughs who surrounded the approaches to\r\nParliament, many members being hustled if not struck. The mob was\r\nso plainly in control of a secret organization that the House of\r\nRepresentatives refused to sit. Urgent messages were sent to the\r\nPolice and Gendarmerie headquarters for reinforcements of armed\r\nmen as a protection, whilst the presence of the Premier was also\r\ndemanded. Masses of police were soon on the ground, but whilst\r\nthey prevented the mob from entering Parliament and carrying out\r\ntheir threat of burning the buildings, and murdering the members,\r\nthey could not--or would not--disperse the crowds, it transpiring\r\nsubsequently that half-a-battalion of infantry in plain clothes\r\nunder their officers formed the backbone of the demonstrators.\r\n\r\nIt was not until nearly dark, after six or seven hours of these\r\ndisorderly scenes, that the Premier finally arrived. Cavalry had\r\nmeanwhile also been massed on the main street; but it was only\r\nwhen the report spread that a Japanese reporter had been killed\r\nthat the order was finally given to charge the mob and disperse it\r\nby force. This was very rapidly done, as apart from the soldiers\r\nin plain clothes the mass of people belonged to the lowest class,\r\nand had no stomach for a fight, having only been paid to shout. It\r\nwas nearly midnight, after twelve hours of isolation and a\r\nfoodless day, that the Representatives were able to disperse\r\nwithout having debated the war-question. The upshot was that with\r\nthe exception of the Minister of Education, the Premier found that\r\nhis entire Cabinet had resigned, the Ministers being unwilling to\r\nbe associated with what had been an attempted coercion of\r\nParliament carried out by the Military.\r\n\r\nThe Premier, General Tuan Chi-jui, however, remained determined to\r\ncarry his point, and within a week a second dispatch was sent to\r\nthe House of Representatives demanding, in spite of what had\r\nhappened, that the declaration of war be immediately brought up\r\nfor debate. Meanwhile publication in a leading Peking newspaper of\r\nfurther details covering Japan's subterranean activities greatly\r\ninflamed the public, and made the Liberal political elements more\r\ndetermined than ever to stand firm. It was alleged that Count\r\nTerauchi was reviving in a more subtle form Group V of the Twenty-\r\none Demands of 1915, the latest Japanese proposal taking the form\r\nof a secret Treaty of twenty articles of which the main\r\nstipulations were to be a loan of twenty million yen to China to\r\nreorganize the three main Chinese arsenals under Japanese\r\nguidance, and a further loan of eighty million yen to be expended\r\non the Japanization of the Chinese army. As a result of this\r\npublication, which rightly or wrongly was declared to be without\r\nfoundation, the editor of The Peking Gazette was seized in the\r\nmiddle of the night and thrown into goal; but Parliament so far\r\nfrom being intimidated passed the very next day (19th May) a\r\nresolution refusing to consider in any form the declaration of war\r\nagainst Germany until the Cabinet had been reorganized--which\r\nmeant the resignation of General Tuan Chi-jui. A last effort was\r\nmade by the reactionary element to jockey the President into\r\nsubmission by presenting to the Chief Executive a petition from\r\nthe Military Governors assembled in Peking demanding the immediate\r\ndissolution of Parliament. On this proposal being absolutely\r\nrejected by the President as wholly unconstitutional, and the\r\nMilitary Governors soundly rated for their interference, an\r\nominous calm followed.\r\n\r\nParliament, however, remained unmoved and continued its work.\r\nAlthough the draft of the Permanent Constitution had been\r\npractically completed, important additions to the text were now\r\nproposed, such additions being designed to increase parliamentary\r\ncontrol and provide every possible precaution against arbitrary\r\nacts in the future. Thus the new provision that a simple vote of\r\nwant of confidence in the Cabinet must be followed by the\r\nPresident either dismissing the Cabinet or dissolving the House of\r\nRepresentatives--but that the dissolution of the Lower House\r\ncould not be ordered without the approval of the Senate--was\r\ngenerally recognized as necessary to destroy the last vestiges of\r\nthe Yuan Shih-kai regime. Furthermore a new article, conferring on\r\nthe President the right to dismiss the Premier summarily by\r\nPresidential Mandate without the counter-signature of the other\r\nCabinet Ministers, completed the disarray of the conservatives who\r\nsaw in this provision the dashing of their last hopes. [Footnote:\r\nThe final text of the Permanent Constitution as it stood on the\r\n28th May, 1917, will be found in the appendix. Its accuracy has\r\nbeen guaranteed to the writer by the speakers of the two Houses.]\r\n\r\nBy the 21st May, the last remaining Cabinet Minister--the\r\nMinister of Education--had resigned and the Premier was left\r\ncompletely isolated. On the 23rd May the President, relying on the\r\ngeneral support of the nation, summarily dismissed General Tuan\r\nChi-jui from the Premiership and appointed the veteran diplomat\r\nDr. Wu Ting-fang to act during the interim period in his stead, at\r\nthe same time placing the metropolitan districts under four\r\ntrustworthy Generals who were vested with provost-marshals' powers\r\nunder a system which gave them command of all the so-called\r\n\"precautionary troops\" holding the approaches to the capital. The\r\nMilitary Governors, who a few hours before these events had left\r\nPeking precipitately in a body on the proclaimed mission of\r\nallying themselves with the redoubtable General Chang Hsun at\r\nHsuchowfu, and threatening the safety of the Republic were,\r\nhowever, coolly received in the provinces in spite of all their\r\nmost bitter attempts to stir up trouble. This, however, as will be\r\nshown, had no influence on their subsequent conduct. The quiet\r\ndisappearance of the ex-Premier in the midst of this upheaval\r\ncaused the report to spread that all the members of the corrupt\r\ncamarilla which had surrounded him were to be arrested, but the\r\nPresident soon publicly disclaimed any intention of doing so,--\r\nwhich appears to have been a fatal mistake. It is disheartening to\r\nhave to state that nearly all the Allied Legations in Peking had\r\nbeen in intimate relations with this gang--always excepting the\r\nAmerican Legation whose attitude is uniformly correct--the French\r\nMinister going so far as to entertain the Military Governors and\r\ndeclare, according to reports in the native press, that Parliament\r\nwas of no importance at all, the only important thing being for\r\nChina promptly to declare war. That some sort of public\r\ninvestigation into Peking diplomacy is necessary before there can\r\nbe any hope of decent relations between China and the Powers seems\r\nindisputable. [Footnote: Since this was written certain\r\ndiplomatists in Peking have been forced to resign.]\r\n\r\nBefore the end of May the militarists being now desperate,\r\nattempted the old game of inciting the provincial capitals \"to\r\ndeclare their independence,\" although the mass of the nation was\r\nplainly against them. Some measure of success attended this move,\r\nsince the soldiery of the northern provinces obediently followed\r\ntheir leaders and there was a sudden wild demand for a march on\r\nPeking. A large amount of rolling-stock on the main railways was\r\nseized with this object, the confusion being made worse confounded\r\nby the fierce denunciations which now came from the southernmost\r\nprovinces, coupled with their threats to attack the Northern\r\ntroops all along the line as soon as they could mobilize.\r\n\r\nThe month of June opened with the situation more threatening than\r\nit had been for years. Emissaries of the recalcitrant Military\r\nGovernors, together with all sorts of \"politicals\" and disgruntled\r\ngenerals, gathered in Tientsin--which is 80 miles from Peking--and\r\nopenly established a Military Headquarters which they declared\r\nwould be converted into a Provisional Government which would seek\r\nthe recognition of the Powers. Troops were moved and concentrated\r\nagainst Peking; fresh demands were made that the President should\r\ndissolve Parliament; whilst the Metropolitan press was suddenly\r\nfilled with seditious articles. The President, seeing that the\r\nsituation was becoming cataclysmic, was induced, through what\r\ninfluences is not known, to issue a mandate summoning General\r\nChang Hsun to Peking to act as a mediator, which was another fatal\r\nmove. He arrived in Tientsin with many troops on the 7th June\r\nwhere he halted and was speedily brought under subversive\r\ninfluences, sending at once up to Peking a sort of ultimatum which\r\nwas simply the old demand for the dissolution of Parliament.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile on the 5th June, the United States, which had been\r\nalarmed by these occurrences, had handed China the following Note\r\nhoping thereby to steady the situation:\r\n\r\nThe Government of the United States learns with the most profound\r\nregret of the dissension in China and desires to express the most\r\nsincere desire that tranquillity and political co-ordination may\r\nbe forthwith re-established.\r\n\r\nThe entry of China into war with Germany--or the continuance of\r\nthe status quo of her relations with that Government--are matters\r\nof secondary consideration.\r\n\r\nThe principal necessity for China is to resume and continue her\r\npolitical entity, to proceed along the road of national\r\ndevelopment on which she has made such marked progress.\r\n\r\nWith the form of Government in China or the personnel which\r\nadministers that Government, the United States has an interest\r\nonly in so far as its friendship impels it to be of service to\r\nChina. But in the maintenance by China of one Central United and\r\nalone responsible Government, the United States is deeply\r\ninterested, and now expresses the very sincere hope that China, in\r\nher own interest and in that of the world, will immediately set\r\naside her factional political disputes, and that all parties and\r\npersons will work for the re-establishment of a co-ordinate\r\nGovernment and the assumption of that place among the Powers of\r\nthe World to which China is so justly entitled, but the full\r\nattainment of which is impossible in the midst of internal\r\ndiscord.\r\n\r\nThe situation had, however, developed so far and so rapidly that\r\nthis expression of opinion had little weight. The Vice-President\r\nof the Republic, General Feng Kuo-chang, unwilling or unable to do\r\nanything, had already tendered his resignation from Nanking,\r\ndeclaring that he would maintain the \"neutrality\" of the important\r\narea of the lower Yangtsze during this extraordinary struggle; and\r\nhis action, strange as it may seem, typified the vast misgivings\r\nwhich filled every one's mind regarding the mad course of action\r\nwhich the rebellious camarilla had decided upon.\r\n\r\nUntil Saturday the 9th June, the President had seemed adamant. On\r\nthat day he personally saw foreign press correspondents and\r\nassured them that, in spite of every threat, he would in no\r\nconceivable circumstances attempt the unconstitutional step of\r\ndissolving Parliament,--unconstitutional because the Nanking\r\nProvisional Constitution under which the country was still\r\ngoverned pending the formal passage of the Permanent Constitution\r\nthrough Parliament, only provided for the creation of Parliament\r\nas a grand constitutional Drafting Committee but gave no power to\r\nthe Chief Executive to dissolve it during its \"life\" which was\r\nthree years. As we have already shown, the period between the coup\r\nd'etat of 4th November, 1913, and the re-convocation of Parliament\r\non 1st August, 1916, had been treated as a mere interregnum:\r\ntherefore until 1918, if the law were properly construed, no power\r\nin the land could interrupt the Parliamentary sessions except\r\nParliament itself. Parliament, in view of these threatening\r\ndevelopments, had already expressed its willingness (a) to re-\r\nconsider certain provisions of the draft constitution in such a\r\nconciliatory manner as to insure the passage of the whole\r\ninstrument through both houses within two weeks (b) to alter the\r\nElection Law in such fashion as to conciliate the more\r\nconservative elements in the country (c) to prorogue the second\r\nsession (1916-1917) immediately these things were done and after a\r\nvery short recess to open the third session (1917-1918) and close\r\nit within three months allowing new elections to be held in the\r\nearly months of 1918,--the new Parliament to be summoned in April,\r\n1918, to form itself into a National Convention and elect the\r\nPresident for the quinquennial period 1918-1923.\r\n\r\nAll these reasonable plans were knocked on the head on Sunday, the\r\n10th June, by the sudden report that the President having been\r\nperemptorily told that the dissolution of Parliament was the sole\r\nmeans of saving the Republic and preventing the sack of Peking, as\r\nwell as an open armed attempt to restore the boy-emperor Hsuan\r\nTung, had at last made up his mind to surrender to the inevitable.\r\nHe had sealed a Mandate decreeing the dissolution of Parliament\r\nwhich would be promulgated as soon as it had received the counter-\r\nsignature of the acting Premier, Dr. Wu Ting-fang, such counter-\r\nsignature being obligatory under Article 45 of the Provisional\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nAt once it became clear again, as happens a thousand times during\r\nevery year in the East, that what is not nipped in the bud grows\r\nwith such malignant swiftness as finally to blight all honest\r\nintentions. Had steps been taken on or about the 23rd May to\r\ndetain forcibly in Peking the ringleader of the recalcitrant\r\nMilitary Governors, one General Ni Shih-chung of Anhui, history\r\nwould have been very different and China spared much national and\r\ninternational humiliation. Six years of stormy happenings had\r\ncertainly bred in the nation a desire for constitutionalism and a\r\ndetestation of military domination. But this desire and\r\ndetestation required firm leadership. Without that leadership it\r\nwas inchoate and powerless, and indeed made furtive by the\r\nconstant fear of savage reprisals. A great opportunity had come\r\nand a great opportunity had been lost. President Li Yuan-hung's\r\npersonal argument, communicated to the writer, was that in sealing\r\nthe Mandate dissolving Parliament he had chosen the lesser of two\r\nevils, for although South China and the Chinese Navy declared they\r\nwould defend Parliament to the last, they were far away whilst\r\nlarge armies were echeloned along the railways leading into Peking\r\nand daily threatening action. The events of the next year or so\r\nmust prove conclusively, in spite of what has happened in this\r\nmonth of June, 1917, that the corrupt power of the sword can no\r\nlonger even nominally rule China.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the veteran Dr. Wu Ting-fang, true to his faith,\r\ndeclared that no power on earth would cause him to sign a Mandate\r\npossessing no legality behind it; and he indeed obstinately\r\nresisted every attempt to seduce him. Although his resignation was\r\nrefused he stood his ground manfully, and it became clear that\r\nsome other expedient would have to be resorted to. In the small\r\nhours of the 13th June what this was was made clear: by a rapid\r\nreshuffling of the cards Dr. Wu Ting-fang's resignation was\r\naccepted and the general officer commanding the Peking\r\nGendarmerie, a genial soul named General Chiang Chao-tsung, who\r\nhad survived unscathed the vicissitudes of six years of\r\nrevolution, was appointed to act in his stead and duly counter-\r\nsigned the fateful Mandate which was at once printed and\r\npromulgated at four o'clock in the morning. It has been stated to\r\nthe writer that had it not been so issued four battalions of Chang\r\nHsun's savage pigtailed soldiery, who had been bivouacked for some\r\ndays in the grounds of the Temple of Heaven, would have been let\r\nloose on the capital. The actual text of the Mandate proves\r\nconclusively that the President had no hand in its drafting--one\r\nargument being sufficient to prove that, namely the deliberate\r\nignoring of the fact that Parliament had been called into being by\r\nvirture of article 53 of the Nanking Provisional Constitution and\r\nthat under article 54 its specific duty was to act as a grand\r\nconstitutional conference to draft and adopt the Permanent\r\nConstitution, article 55 furthermore giving Parliament the right\r\nsummarily to amend the Provisional Constitution before the\r\nPromulgation of the permanent instrument, should that be\r\nnecessary. Provisions of this sort would naturally carry no weight\r\nwith generals of the type of Chang Hsun, of whom it is said that\r\nuntil recent years he possessed only the most elementary\r\neducation; but it is a dismal thing to have to record that the\r\nConservative Party in China should have adopted a platform of\r\nbrute force in the year of grace, 1917.\r\n\r\nMANDATE DISSOLVING PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\nIn the 6th month of last year I promulgated a Mandate stating that\r\nin order to make a Constitution it was imperative that Parliament\r\nshould be convened. The Republic was inaugurated five years ago\r\nand yet there was no Constitution, which should be the fundamental\r\nlaw of a nation, therefore it was ordered that Parliament be re-\r\nconvened to make the Constitution, etc., at once.\r\n\r\nTherefore the main object for the re-convocation of Parliament was\r\nto make a formal constitution for the country. Recently a petition\r\nwas received from Meng En-yuen, Tu-chun of Kirin, and others, to\r\nthe effect that \"in the articles passed by the Constitution\r\nConference there were several points as follows: 'when the House\r\nof Representatives passes a vote of want of confidence against the\r\nCabinet Ministers, the President may dismiss the Cabinet\r\nMinisters, or dissolve the said House, but the dissolution of the\r\nHouse shall have the approval of the Senate.' Again, 'When the\r\nPresident dismisses his Prime Minister, it is unnecessary for him\r\nto secure the counter-signature of the Cabinet Ministers.' Again\r\n'when a bill is passed by the Two Houses it shall have the force\r\nof the law.' We were surprised to read the above provisions.\r\n\r\n\"According to the precedents of other nations the Constitution has\r\nnever been made by Parliament. If we should desire a good and\r\nworkable Constitution, we should seek a fundamental solution.\r\nIndeed Parliament is more important than any other organ in the\r\ncountry; but when the national welfare is imperilled, we must take\r\naction. As the present Parliament does not care about the national\r\nwelfare, it is requested that in view of the critical condition of\r\nthe country, drastic measures be taken and both the House of\r\nRepresentatives and the Senate be dissolved so that they may be\r\nreorganized and the Constitution may be made without any further\r\ndelay. Thus the form of the Republican Government be preserved,\r\netc.\"\r\n\r\nOf late petitions and telegrams have been received from the\r\nmilitary and civil officials, merchants, scholars, etc.,\r\ncontaining similar demands. The Senate and the House of\r\nRepresentatives have held the Constitution Conference for about\r\none year, and the Constitution has not yet been completed.\r\nMoreover at this critical time most of the M.P's. of both Houses\r\nhave tendered their resignation. Hence it is impossible to secure\r\nquorums to discuss business. There is therefore no chance to\r\nrevise the articles already passed. Unless means be devised to\r\nhasten the making of the Constitution, the heart of the people\r\nwill never be satisfied.\r\n\r\nI, the President, who desire to comply with the will of the\r\npopulace and to consolidate the foundation of the nation, grant\r\nthe request of the Tuchuns and the people. It is hereby ordered\r\nthat the Senate and the House of Representatives be dissolved, and\r\nthat another election be held immediately. Thus a Constitutional\r\nGovernment can be maintained. It must be pointed out that the\r\nobject for the reorganization of Parliament is to hasten the\r\nmaking of the Constitution, and not to abolish the Legislative\r\nOrgan of the Republic. I hope all the citizens of the Republic\r\nwill understand my motives.\r\n\r\nA great agitation and much public uneasiness followed the\r\npublication of this document; and the parliamentarians, who had\r\nalready been leaving Peking in small numbers, now evacuated the\r\ncapital en masse for the South. The reasonable and wholly logical\r\nattitude of the Constitutionalists is well-exhibited in the last\r\nMemorandum they submitted to the President some days prior to his\r\ndecision to issue the Mandate above-quoted; and a perusal of this\r\ndocument will show what may be expected in the future. It will be\r\nnoted that the revolting Military Governors are boldly termed\r\nrebels and that the constitutional view of everything they may\r\ncontrive as from the 13th June, 1917, is that it will be bereft of\r\nall legality and simply mark a fresh interregnum. Furthermore, it\r\nis important to note that the situation is brought back by the\r\nMandate of the 13th June to where it was on the 6th June, 1916,\r\nwith the death of Yuan Shih-kai, and that a period of civil\r\ncommotion seems inevitable.\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nTo the President: Our previous memorandum to Your Excellency must\r\nhave received your attention. We now beg further to inform you\r\nthat the rebels are now practically in an embarrassing predicament\r\non account of internal differences, the warning of the friendly\r\nPowers, and the protest of the Southwestern provinces. Their\r\nposition is becoming daily more and more untenable. If Your\r\nExcellency strongly holds out for another ten days or so, their\r\nmovement will collapse.\r\n\r\nSome one, however, has the impudence to suggest that with the\r\nentry of Chang Hsun's troops into the Capital, and delay in the\r\nsettlement of the question will mean woe and disaster. But to us,\r\nthere need be no such fear. As the troops in the Capital have no\r\nmind to oppose the rebels, Tsao Kun and his troops alone will be\r\nadequate for their purposes in the Capital. But now the rebels\r\ntroops have been halting in the neighbourhood of the Capital for\r\nthe last ten days. This shows that they dare not open hostilities\r\nagainst the Government, which step will certainly bring about\r\nforeign intervention and incur the strong opposition of the\r\nSouthwestern provinces. Having refused to participate in the\r\nrebellion at the invitation of Ni Shih-chung and Chang Tso-lin,\r\nChang Hsun will certainly not do what Tsao Kun has not dared to\r\ndo. But the rebels have secret agents in the Capital to circulate\r\nrumours to frighten the public and we hope that the President will\r\nremain calm and unperturbed, lest it will give an opportunity for\r\nthe rebel agents to practise their evil tricks.\r\n\r\nRespecting Parliament, its re-assembly was one of the two most\r\nimportant conditions by means of which the political differences\r\nbetween the North and the South last year were healed. The\r\ndissolution of Parliament would mean the violation of the terms of\r\nsettlement entered into between the North and the South last year\r\nand an open challenge to the South. Would the South remain silent\r\nrespecting this outrageous measure? If the South rises in arms\r\nagainst this measure, what explanation can the Central Government\r\ngive? It will only serve to hasten the split between the North and\r\nthe South. From a legal point of view, the Power of Government is\r\nvested in the Provisional Constitution. When the Government\r\nexercises power which is not provided for by the Constitution, it\r\nsimply means high treason.\r\n\r\nSome one has suggested that it would not be an illegal act for the\r\nGovernment to dissolve Parliament, since it is not provided in the\r\nProvisional Constitution as to how Parliament should be dissolved,\r\nnor does that instrument specifically prohibit the Government from\r\ndissolving Parliament. But this is a misinterpretation. For\r\ninstance, the Provisional Constitution has not provided that the\r\nPresident shall not proclaim himself Emperor, nor does it prohibit\r\nhim from so doing. According to such interpretation, it would not\r\nbe illegal, if the President were to proclaim himself Emperor of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nIn short, the action taken by Ni Shih-chung and others is nothing\r\nshort of open rebellion. From the legal point of view, any\r\nsuggestion of compromise would be absurd. It has already been a\r\nfatal mistake for the President to have allowed them to do what\r\nthey like, and if he again yields to their pressure by dissolving\r\nParliament, he will be held responsible, when the righteous troops\r\nrise and punish the rebels. If the President, deceived by ignoble\r\npersons, take upon himself to dissolve the assembly, his name will\r\ngo down in history as one committing high treason against the\r\nGovernment, and the author of the break between the North and the\r\nSouth. The President has been known as the man by whose hands the\r\nRepublic was built. We have special regard for his benevolent\r\ncharacter and kind disposition. We are reluctant to see him\r\nintimidated and misled by evil counsels to take a step which will\r\nundo all his meritorious services to the country and shatter the\r\nunique reputation he has enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe unrolling of these dramatic events was the signal for the\r\ngreatest subterranean activity on the part of the Japanese, who\r\nwere now everywhere seen rubbing their hands and congratulating\r\nthemselves on the course history was taking. General Tanaka, Vice-\r\nChief of the Japanese General Staff, who had been on an extensive\r\ntour of inspection in China, SO PLANNED AS TO INCLUDE EVERY\r\nARSENAL NORTH OF THE YANGTSZE had arrived at the psychological\r\nmoment in Peking and was now deeply engaged through Japanese\r\nfield-officers in the employ of the Chinese Government, in pulling\r\nevery string and in trying to commit the leaders of this\r\nunedifying plot in such a way as to make them puppets of Japan.\r\nThe Japanese press, seizing on the American Note of the 5th June\r\nas an excuse, had been belabouring the United States for some days\r\nfor its \"interference\" in Chinese affairs, and also for having\r\nignored Japan's \"special position\" in China, which according to\r\nthese publicists demanded that no Power take any action in the Far\r\nEast, or give any advice, without first consulting Japan. That a\r\nstern correction will have to be offered to this presumption as\r\nsoon as the development of the war permits it is certain. But not\r\nonly Japanese military officers and journalists were endlessly\r\nbusy: so-called Japanese advisers to the Chinese Government had\r\ndone their utmost to assist the confusion. Thus Dr. Ariga, the\r\nConstitutional expert, when called in at the last moment for\r\nadvice by President Li Yuan-hung had flatly contradicted Dr.\r\nMorrison, who with an Englishman's love of justice and\r\nconstitutionalism had insisted that there was only one thing for\r\nthe President to do--to be bound by legality to the last no matter\r\nwhat it might cost him. Dr. Ariga had falsely stated that the\r\nissue was a question of expediency, thus deliberately assisting\r\nthe forces of disruption. This is perhaps only what was to be\r\nexpected of a man who had advised Yuan Shih-kai to make himself\r\nEmperor--knowing full well that he could never succeed and that\r\nindeed the whole enterprise from the point of view of Japan was an\r\nelaborate trap.\r\n\r\nThe provincial response to the action taken on the 13th June\r\nbecame what every one had expected: the Southwestern group of\r\nprovinces, with their military headquarters at Canton, began\r\nopenly concerting measures to resist not the authority of the\r\nPresident, who was recognized as a just man surrounded by evil-\r\nminded persons who never hesitated to betray him, but to destroy\r\nthe usurping generals and the corrupt camarilla behind them;\r\nwhilst the Yangtsze provinces, with their headquarters at Nanking,\r\nwhich had hitherto been pledged to \"neutrality,\" began secretly\r\nexchanging views with the genuinely Republican South. The group of\r\nTientsin generals and \"politicals,\" confused by these\r\ndevelopments, remained inactive; and this was no doubt responsible\r\nfor the mad coup attempted by the semi-illiterate General Chang\r\nHsun. In the small hours of July 1st General Chang Hsun, relying\r\non the disorganization in the capital which we have dealt with in\r\nour preceding account, entered the Imperial City with his troops\r\nby prearrangement with the Imperial Family and at 4 o'clock on the\r\nmorning of the 1st July the Manchu boy-emperor Hsuan Tung, who\r\nlost the Throne on the 12th February, 1912, was enthroned before a\r\nsmall assembly of Manchu nobles, courtiers and sycophantic\r\nChinese. The capital woke up to find military patrols everywhere\r\nand to hear incredulously that the old order had returned. The\r\npolice, obeying instructions, promptly visited all shops and\r\ndwelling-houses and ordered every one to fly the Dragon Flag. In\r\nthe afternoon of the same day the following Restoration Edict was\r\nissued, its statements being a tissue of falsehoods, the alleged\r\nmemorial from President Li Yuan Hung, which follows the principal\r\ndocument, being a bare-faced forgery, whilst no single name\r\ninserted in the text save that of Chang Hsun had any right to be\r\nthere. There is also every reason to believe that the Manchu court\r\nparty was itself coerced, terror being felt from the beginning\r\nregarding the consequences of this mad act which was largely\r\npossible because Peking is a Manchu city.\r\n\r\nIMPERIAL EDICT\r\n\r\nIssued the 13th day of the 5th Moon of the 9th year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\nWhile yet in our boyhood the inheritance of the great domain was\r\nunfortunately placed in our possession; and since we were then all\r\nalone, we were unable to weather the numerous difficulties. Upon\r\nthe outbreak of the uprising in the year of Hsin Hai, (1911) Our\r\nEmpress, Hsiao Ting Chin, owing to her Most High Virtue and Most\r\nDeep Benevolence was unwilling to allow the people to suffer, and\r\ncourageously placed in the hands of the late Imperial Councillor,\r\nYuan Shih-kai, the great dominion which our forefathers had built\r\nup, and with it the lives of the millions of Our People, with\r\norders to establish a provisional government.\r\n\r\nThe power of State was thus voluntarily given to the whole country\r\nwith the hope that disputes might disappear, disturbances might\r\nstop and the people enabled to live in peace. But ever since the\r\nform of State was changed into a Republic, continuous strife has\r\nprevailed and several wars have taken place. Forcible seizure,\r\nexcessive taxation and bribery have been of everyday occurrence.\r\nAlthough the annual revenue has increased to 400 millions this\r\namount is still insufficient to meet the needs. The total amount\r\nof foreign obligations has reached a figure of more than ten\r\nthousand millions yet more loans are being contracted. The people\r\nwithin the seas are shocked by this state of affairs and interest\r\nin life has forsaken them. The step reluctantly taken by Our\r\nEmpress Hsiao Ting Chin for the purpose of giving respite to the\r\npeople has resulted untowardly in increasing the burdens of Our\r\nPeople. This indeed Our Empress Hsiao Ting Chin was unable to\r\nforesee, and the result must have made her Spirit in Heaven to\r\nweep sorely. And it is owing to this that we have been praying to\r\nHeaven day and night in the close confines of the palace,\r\nmeditating and weeping in silent suffering.\r\n\r\nRecently party strife has resulted in war and the country has\r\nremained too long in an unsettled condition. The Republic has\r\nfallen to pieces and means of remedy have been exhausted.\r\n\r\nChang Hsun, Feng Kuo-chang and Lu Yung-ting have jointly\r\nmemorialized the Throne stating that the minds of people are\r\ndisturbed and they are longing to see the old regime restored, and\r\nasking that the throne be reoccupied in order to comfort the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nChu Hung-chi and others have also memorialized us stating that the\r\ncountry is in imminent danger and that the people have lost their\r\nfaith in the Republic, and asking that we ascend the Throne in\r\nobedience to the mandate of Heaven and man.\r\n\r\nLi Yuan Hung has also memorialized the throne, returning the great\r\npower of State to us in order to benefit the country and save the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nA persual of the said memorials, which are worded in earnest\r\nterms, has filled our heart with regret and fear. On the one hand\r\nWe, being yet in Our boyhood, are afraid to assume the great\r\nresponsibilities for the existence of the country but on the other\r\nhand We are unwilling to turn our head away from the welfare of\r\nthe millions simply because the step might affect Our own safety.\r\n\r\nAfter weighing the two sides and considering the mandates of\r\nHeaven and man, we have decided reluctantly to comply with the\r\nprayers, and have again occupied the Court to attend to the\r\naffairs of State after resuming possession of the great power on\r\nthe 13th day of the 5th moon of the 9th year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\nA new beginning will be made with our people. Hereafter the\r\nprinciples of morality and the sacred religion shall be our\r\nconstitution in spirit, and order, righteousness, honesty and\r\nconscience will be practised to rebind the minds of the people who\r\nare now without bonds. People high and low will be uniformly\r\ntreated with sincerity, and will not depend on obedience of law\r\nalone as the means of co-operation. Administration and orders will\r\nbe based on conscientious realization and no one will be allowed\r\nto treat the form of State as material for experiment. At this\r\ntime of exhaustion when its vitality is being wasted to the last\r\ndrop and the existence of the country is hanging in the balance,\r\nwe, as if treading on thin ice over deep waters, dare not in the\r\nslightest degree indulge in license on the principle that the\r\nSovereign is entitled to enjoyment. It is our wish therefore that\r\nall officials, be they high or low, should purify their hearts and\r\ncleanse themselves of all forms of old corruption, constantly\r\nkeeping in mind the real interests of the people. Every bit of\r\nvitality of the people they shall be able to preserve shall go to\r\nstrengthen the life of the country for whatever it is worth. Only\r\nby doing so can the danger be averted and Heaven moved by our\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\nTHE NINE ARTICLES\r\n\r\nHerewith we promulgate the following principal things, which we\r\nmust either introduce as reforms or abolish as undesirable in\r\nrestoration.\r\n\r\n1. We shall obey the edict of Emperor Teh Tsung Chin (Kuang Hsu),\r\nnamely, that the sovereign power shall be controlled by the Court\r\n(state) but the detailed administration shall be subject to public\r\nopinion. The country shall be called The Empire of Ta Ching; and\r\nthe methods of other constitutional monarchies shall be carefully\r\ncopied.\r\n\r\n2. The allowance for the Imperial House shall be the same as\r\nbefore, namely, $4,000,000 per year. The sum shall be paid\r\nannually and not a single cent is to be added.\r\n\r\n3. We shall strictly obey the instructions of our forefathers to\r\nthe extent that no member of the imperial family shall be allowed\r\nto interfere with administrative affairs.\r\n\r\n4. The line of demarcation between Man (Manchu) and Han (Chinese)\r\nshall be positively obliterated. All Manchurian and Mongolian\r\nposts which have already been abolished shall not be restored. As\r\nto intermarrige and change of customs the officials concerned are\r\nhereby commanded to submit their views on the points concerning\r\nthem respectively.\r\n\r\n5. All treaties and loan agreements, money for which has already\r\nbeen paid, formally concluded and signed with any eastern and\r\nwestern countries before this 13th day of the 5th Moon of the 9th\r\nyear of Hsuan Tung, shall continue to be valid.\r\n\r\n6. The stamp duty which was introduced by the Republic is hereby\r\nabolished so that the people may be relieved of their burdens. As\r\nto other petty taxes and contributions the Viceroys and Governors\r\nof the provinces are hereby commanded to make investigations and\r\nreport on the same for their abolition.\r\n\r\n7. The criminal code of the Republic is unsuited to this country.\r\nIt is hereby abolished. For the time being the provisional\r\ncriminal code as adopted in the first year of Hsuan Tung shall be\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n8. The evil custom of political parties is hereby forbidden. Old\r\npolitical offenders are all pardoned. We shall, however, not be\r\nable to pardon those who deliberately hold themselves aloof and\r\ndisturb peace and order.\r\n\r\n9. All of our people and officials shall be left to decide for\r\nthemselves the custom of wearing or cutting their queues as\r\ncommanded in the 9th moon of the 3rd year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\nWe swear that we and our people shall abide by these articles. The\r\nGreat Heaven and Earth bear witness to our words. Let this be made\r\nknown to all.\r\n\r\nCounter-signed by Chang Hsun, Member of the Imperial Privy\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nALLEGED MEMORIAL BY PRESIDENT LI YUAN HUNG\r\n\r\nIn a memorial submitted this day, offering to return the sovereign\r\npower of State and praying that we again ascend the throne to\r\ncontrol the great empire, Li Yuan Hung states that some time ago\r\nhe was forced by mutinous troops to steal the great throne and\r\nfalsely remained at the head of the administration but failed to\r\ndo good to the difficult situation. He enumerates the various\r\nevils in the establishment of a Republic and prays that we ascend\r\nthe throne to again control the Empire with a view that the people\r\nmay thereby be saved. As to himself he awaits punishment by the\r\nproperly instituted authorities, etc. As his words are so mournful\r\nand full of remorse they must have been uttered from a sincere\r\nheart. Since it was not his free choice to follow the rebellion,\r\nthe fact that he has returned the great power of administration to\r\nus shows that he knows the great principle of righteousness. At\r\nthis time of national danger and uncertainty, he has taken the\r\nlead of the people in obeying their sovereign, and decided before\r\nothers the plan to save the country from ruin. The merit is indeed\r\ngreat, and we are highly pleased with his achievement. Li Yuan-\r\nhung is hereby to have conferred on him the dignity of Duke of the\r\nfirst class so as to show our great appreciation. Let him accept\r\nour Edict and forever receive our blessings.\r\n\r\nCounter-signed by Chang Hsun, Member of the Privy Council.\r\n\r\nPRIVY COUNCIL\r\n\r\nAt this time of restoration a Privy Council is hereby established\r\nin order that we may be assisted in our duties and that\r\nresponsibility may be made definite. Two Under-secretaries of the\r\nCouncil are also created. Other officials serving outside of the\r\ncapital shall remain as under the system in force during the first\r\nyear of Hsuan Tung. All civil and military officials who are now\r\nserving at their various posts are hereby commanded to continue in\r\noffice as hitherto.\r\n\r\nCounter-signed by Chang Hsun.\r\n\r\n(Hereafter follow many appointments of reactionary Chinese\r\nofficials.)\r\n\r\nThe general stupefaction at the madness of this act and the\r\nmilitary occupation of all posts and telegraph-offices in Peking\r\nallowed 48 hours to go by before the reaction came. On the 2nd\r\nJuly Edicts still continued to appear attempting to galvanize to\r\nlife the corpse of Imperialism and the puzzled populace flew the\r\nDragon Flag. On the morning of the 3rd, however, the news suddenly\r\nspread that President Li Yuan-hung, who had virtually been made a\r\nprisoner in the Presidential Palace, had escaped at nine o'clock\r\nthe night before by motorcar accompanied by two aides-de-camp, and\r\nafter attempting to be received at the French Hospital in the\r\nLegation Quarter, had proceeded to the Japanese Legation where he\r\nwas offered a suitable residence. On the evening of the 3rd the\r\nJapanese Legation issued the following official communique (in\r\nFrench) defining its attitude:\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION\r\n\r\nPresident Li, accompanied by two members of his staff, came at\r\n9.30 on the evening of July 2 to the residence of General Saito,\r\nMilitary Attache of the Japanese Legation, and asked protection\r\nfrom him. He arrived in a spontaneous manner and without previous\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the Imperial Japanese Legation,\r\nfollowing international usage, has decided to accord him the\r\nnecessary protection and has placed at his disposal a part of the\r\nmilitary barracks.\r\n\r\nThe Legation further declares that as long as President Li remains\r\nthere, it will not permit any political action on his part.\r\n\r\nFollowing this sensational development it became known that\r\nPresident Li Yuan Hung had completely frustrated the efforts of\r\nthe Imperialists by sending away a number of important telegraphic\r\nMandates by courier to Tientsin as well as the Presidential Seal.\r\nBy a masterly move in one of these Mandates General Tuan Chi-jui\r\nwas reappointed Premier, whilst Vice-President Feng Kuo-chang was\r\nasked to officiate as President, the arrangements being so\r\ncomplete as at once to catch Chang Hsun in his own net.\r\n\r\nHere is the text of these four historically important messages:\r\n\r\n(1) Dated July 1. Today Inspector General Chang Hsun entered the\r\ncity with his troops and actually restored the monarchy. He\r\nstopped traffic and sent Liang Ting-fen and others to my place to\r\npersuade me. Yuan-hung refused in firm language and swore that he\r\nwould not recognize such a step. It is his hope that the Vice-\r\nPresident and others will take effective means to protect the\r\nRepublic. LI YUAN HUNG.\r\n\r\n(2) Dated July 1. As Heaven does not scorn calamity so has the\r\nmonarchy been restored. It is said that in an edict issued by the\r\nChing House it is stated that Yuan-hung had actually memorialized\r\nto return the power of State to the said House. This is an\r\nextraordinary announcement. China changed from autocracy to a\r\nRepublic by the unanimous wish of the five races of the country.\r\nSince Yuan-hung was entrusted by the people with the great\r\nresponsibilities it is his natural duty to maintain the Republic\r\nto the very end. Nothing more or less than this will he care to\r\nsay. He is sending this in order to avoid misunderstanding. LI\r\nYUAN HUNG.\r\n\r\n(3) The President to the Vice-President.\r\n\r\nTo the Vice-President Feng at Nanking--It is to be presumed that\r\nthe two telegrams sent on the 1st have safely reached you. I state\r\nwith deepest regret and greatest sorrow that as the result of my\r\nlack of ability to handle the situation the political crisis has\r\neventually affected the form of government. For this Yuan-hung\r\nrealizes that he owes the country apology. The situation in Peking\r\nis daily becoming more precarious. Since Yuan-hung is now unable\r\nto exercise his power the continuity of the Republic may be\r\nsuddenly interrupted. You are also entrusted by the citizens with\r\ngreat responsibilities; I ask you to temporarily exercise the\r\npower and functions of the President in your own office in\r\naccordance with the provisions of Article 42 of the Provisional\r\nConstitution and Article 5 of the Presidential Election Law. As\r\nthe means of communication is effectively blocked it is feared\r\nthat the sending of my seal will meet with difficulty and\r\nobstruction. Tuan Chih-chuan (Tuan Chi-jui) has been appointed\r\nPremier, and is also ordered to temporarily protect the seal, and\r\nlater to devise a means to forward it on to you. Hereafter every\r\nthing pertaining to the important question of saving the country\r\nshall be energetically pushed by you and Chih-chuan with utmost\r\nvigour. The situation is pressing and your duty is clear. In great\r\nanxiety and expectation I am sending you this telegram. LI YUAN\r\nHUNG.\r\n\r\n(4) Dated July 3. To Vice-President Feng, Tu Chuns and Governors\r\nof the Provinces, Provincial Assemblies, Inspector General Lu:--I\r\npresume that the two telegrams dated 1st and one dated 3rd inst.\r\nhave safely reached your place. With bitter remorse to myself I\r\nnow make the statement that the political crisis has resulted in\r\naffecting the form of government. Tuan Chih-chuan has been\r\nappointed on the 1st inst. as Premier; and the Vice-President has\r\nbeen asked to exercise the power and functions of the President in\r\naccordance of office by the Vice-President. Premier Tuan is\r\nauthorized to act at his discretion. All the seal and documents\r\nhave been sent to Tientsin, and Premier Tuan has been told to keep\r\nand guard the same for the time being. He has also been asked to\r\nforward the same to the Vice-President. The body guards of the\r\nPresident's Office have suddenly been replaced and I have been\r\npressed to give up the Three Lakes. Yuan-hung has therefore\r\nremoved to a sanctuary. As regards the means to save the country I\r\ntrust that you will consult and work unitedly with Vice-President\r\nFeng and Premier Tuan. In great expectation, and with much of my\r\nheart not poured out. LI YUAN HUNG.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, whilst these dramatic events were occurring in Peking,\r\nothers no less sensational were taking place in the provinces. The\r\nTientsin group, suddenly realizing that the country was in danger,\r\ntook action very swiftly, disclosing that in spite of all disputes\r\nRepublicanism had become very dear to every thinking man in the\r\ncountry, and that at last it was possible to think of an united\r\nChina. The Scholar Liang Chi Chao, spokesman of Chinese\r\nLiberalism, in an extraordinarily able message circularized the\r\nprovinces in terms summarizing everything of importance. Beginning\r\nwith the fine literary flight that \"heaven has refused to\r\nsympathize with our difficulties by allowing traitors to be born\"\r\nhe ends with the astounding phrase that although he had proposed\r\nto remain silent to the end of his days, \"at the sight of the\r\nfallen nest he has, however, spat the stopper out of his throat,\"\r\nand he calls upon all China to listen to his words which are\r\nsimply that the Republic must be upheld or dissolution will come.\r\n\r\nArms now united with Literature. General Tuan Chi-jui, immediately\r\naccepting the burden placed on him, proceeded to the main\r\nentrenched camp outside Tientsin and assumed command of the troops\r\nmassed there, issuing at the same time the following manifesto:\r\n\r\nTUAN CHI-JUI'S MANIFESTO\r\n\r\nTo Vice-President Feng Kuo-chang, Inspector General of Wumin, Tu\r\nChuns, Governors, Tu-tungs. ...\r\n\r\nHeaven is chastening this country by the series of disturbances\r\nthat have taken place. Chang Hsun, filled with sinister designs,\r\nhas occupied the capital by bringing up his troops under the\r\npretext of effecting a compromise with the astounding result that\r\nlast night the Republican form of government was overthrown. The\r\nquestion of the form of Government is the very fundamental\r\nprinciple on which the national existence depends. It requires\r\nassiduous efforts to settle the form of government and once a\r\ndecision has been reached on the subject, any attempt to change\r\nthe same is bound to bring on unspeakable disasters to the\r\ncountry. Today the people of China are much more enlightened and\r\ndemocratic in spirit than ever before. It is, therefore,\r\nabsolutely impossible to subjugate the millions by holding out to\r\nthe country the majesty of any one family.\r\n\r\nWhen the Republic of China was being founded, the Ching House,\r\nbeing well aware of the general inclinations of modern peoples,\r\nsincerely and modestly abdicated its power. Believing that such\r\nspirit deserved handsome recognition the people were willing to\r\nplace the Ching House under the protection of special treatment\r\nand actually recorded the covenant on paper, whereby contentment\r\nand honour were vouchsafed the Ching House. Of the end of more\r\nthan 20 dynasties of Chinese history, none can compare with the\r\nChing dynasty for peace and safety.\r\n\r\nPurely for sake of satisfying his ambitions of self-elevation\r\nChang Hsun and others have audaciously committed a crime of\r\ninconceivable magnitude and are guilty of high treason. Like Wang\r\nMang and Tung Tso he seeks to sway the whole nation by utilizing a\r\nyoung and helpless emperor. Moreover he has given the country to\r\nunderstand that Li Yuan-hung has memorialized the Ching House that\r\nmany evils have resulted from republicanism and that the ex-\r\nemperor should be restored to save the masses. That Chang Hsun has\r\nbeen guilty of usurpation and forging documents is plain and the\r\nscandal is one that shocks all the world.\r\n\r\nCan it be imagined that Chang Hsun is actuated by a patriotic\r\nmotive? Surely despotism is no longer tolerated in this stage of\r\nmodern civilization. Such a scheme can only provoke universal\r\nopposition. Five years have already passed since the friendly\r\nPowers accorded their recognition of the Chinese Republic and if\r\nwe think we could afford to amuse ourselves with changes in the\r\nnational fabric, we could not expect foreign powers to put up with\r\nsuch childishness. Internal strife is bound to invite foreign\r\nintervention and the end of the country will then be near.\r\n\r\nCan it be possible that Chang Hsun has acted in the interest of\r\nthe Ching House? The young boy-emperor lives in peace and\r\ncontentment and has not the slightest idea of ever ruling China\r\nagain. It is known that his tutors have been warning him of the\r\ndangers of intriguing for power. That the boy-emperor has been\r\ndragged on the throne entirely against his own wishes is\r\nundeniable. History tells us that no dynasty can live for ever. It\r\nis an unprecedented privilege for the Ching dynasty to be able to\r\nend with the gift of special treatment. How absurd to again place\r\nthe Tsing house on the top of a high wall so that it may fall once\r\nmore and disappear for ever.\r\n\r\nChi-jui, after his dismissal, resolved not to participate in\r\npolitical affairs, but as he has had a share, however\r\ninsignificant, in the formation of the Chinese Republic, and\r\nhaving served the Republic for so long he cannot bear to see its\r\ndestruction without stretching out a helping hand. Further, he has\r\nbeen a recipient of favours from the defunct dynasty, and he can\r\nnot bear to watch unmoved, the sight of the Ching House being made\r\nthe channel of brigandage with suicidal results. Wherever duty\r\ncalls, Chi-jui will go in spite of the danger of death. You,\r\ngentlemen, are the pillars of the Republic of China and therefore\r\nhave your own duties to perform. In face of this extraordinary\r\ncrisis, our indignation must be one. For the interest of the\r\ncountry we should abide by our oath of unstinted loyalty; and for\r\nthe sake of the Tsing House let us show our sympathy by sane and\r\nwise deeds. I feel sure you will put forth every ounce of your\r\nenergy and combine your efforts to combat the great disaster.\r\nThough I am a feeble old soldier, I will follow you on the back of\r\nmy steed. (Sgd) TUAN CHI-JUI.\r\n\r\nFollowing the publication of this manifesto a general movement of\r\ntroops began. On the 5th July the important Peking-Tientsin\r\nrailway was reported interrupted forty miles from the capital--at\r\nLangfang which is the station where Admiral Seymour's relief\r\nexpedition in 1900 was nearly surrounded and exterminated. Chang\r\nHsun, made desperate by the swift answer to his coup, had moved\r\nout of Peking in force stiffening his own troops with numbers of\r\nManchu soldiery, and announcing that he would fight it out to the\r\nbitter end, although this proved as false as the rest had been.\r\nThe first collision occurred on the evening of the 5th July and\r\nwas disastrous for the King-maker. The whole Northern army, with\r\nthe exception of a Manchu Division in Peking, was so rapidly\r\nconcentrated on the two main railways leading to the capital that\r\nChang Hsun's army, hopelessly outnumbered and outmanoeuvred, fell\r\nback after a brief resistance. Chang Hsun himself was plainly\r\nstupefied by the discovery that imperialism of the classic type\r\nwas as much out of date in the North as in the South; and within\r\none week of his coup he was prepared to surrender if his life and\r\nreputation were spared. By the 9th July the position was this: the\r\nRepublican forces had surrounded Peking: Chang Hsun had resigned\r\nevery appointment save the command of his own troops: the Manchu\r\nCourt party had drafted a fresh Edict of Renunciation, but being\r\nterrorized by the pigtailed troops surrounding the Palace did not\r\ndare to issue it.\r\n\r\nThe usual bargaining now commenced with the Legation Quarter\r\nacting as a species of middleman. No one was anxious to see\r\nwarfare carried into the streets of Peking, as not only might this\r\nlead to the massacres of innocent people, but to foreign\r\ncomplications as well. The novelty had already been seen of a\r\nminiature air-raid on the Imperial city, and the panic that\r\nexploding bombs had carried into the hearts of the Manchu Imperial\r\nFamily made them ready not only to capitulate but to run away. The\r\nchief point at issue was, however, not the fate of the monarchy,\r\nwhich was a dead thing, but simply what was going to happen to\r\nChang Hsun's head--a matter which was profoundly distressing Chang\r\nHsun. The Republican army had placed a price of 10,000 pounds on\r\nit, and the firebrands were advocating that the man must be\r\ncaptured, dead or alive, and suffer decapitation in front of the\r\nGreat Dynastic Gate of the Palace as a revenge for his perfidy.\r\nRound this issue a subtle battle raged which was not brought to a\r\nhead until the evening of the 11th July, when all attempts at\r\nforcing Chang Hsun to surrender unconditionally having failed, it\r\nwas announced that a general attack would be made on his forces at\r\ndaylight the next morning.\r\n\r\nPromptly at dawn on the 12th July a gun-signal heralded the\r\nassault. Large Republican contingents entered the city through\r\nvarious Gates, and a storm of firing aroused terror among the\r\npopulace. The main body of Chang Hsun's men, entrenched in the\r\ngreat walled enclosure of the Temple of Heaven, were soon\r\nsurrounded, and although it would have been possible for them to\r\nhold out for several days, after a few hours' firing a parley\r\nbegan and they quietly surrendered. Similarly in the Imperial\r\ncity, where Chang Hsun had taken up his residence, this leader, in\r\nspite of his fire-eating declarations, soon fled to the Legation\r\nQuarter and besought an asylum. His men held out until two in the\r\nafternoon, when their resistance collapsed and the cease-fire\r\nsounded. The number of casualties on both sides was infinitesimal,\r\nand thus after eleven days' farce the Manchu dynasty found itself\r\nworse off than ever before. It is necessary, however, not to lose\r\nsight of the main problem in China, which is the establishment of\r\na united government and a cessation of internecine warfare,--\r\nissues which have been somewhat simplified by Chang Hsun's\r\nescapade, but not solved. That a united government will ultimately\r\nbe established is the writer's belief, based on a knowledge of all\r\nthe facts. But to attain that further provincial struggles are\r\ninevitable, since China is too large a unit to find common ground\r\nwithout much suffering and bitterness. President Li Yuan Hung\r\nhaving declared that nothing would induce him to resume office,\r\nVice-President Feng Kuo-chang has become the legal successor and\r\nhas quietly assumed office. Chang Hsun's abortive coup has already\r\ncleared the air in North China to this extent: that the Manchu\r\nImperial Family is to be removed from Peking and the Imperial\r\nallowance greatly reduced, whilst the proscription of such out-\r\nand-out imperialists as Kang Yu-wei has destroyed the last\r\nvestiges of public support. Finally the completion of China's\r\nforeign policy, i. e. the declaration of war against Germany and\r\nAustria, has at last been made on the 14th August, 1917, and a\r\nconsistent course of action mapped out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL PROBLEM:--REMODELLING THE POLITICO-ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP\r\nBETWEEN CHINA AND THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe careful narrative we have made--supported as it is by\r\ndocuments--of the history of China since the inception of the\r\nRepublic six years ago should not fail to awaken profound\r\nastonishment among those who are interested in the spread of good\r\ngovernment throughout the world. Even casual readers will have no\r\ndifficulty in realizing how many lives have been lost and how\r\ngreatly the country has been crippled both owing to the blind\r\nforeign support given to Yuan Shih-kai during four long and weary\r\nyears and to the stupid adhesion to exploded ideas, when a little\r\nintelligence and a little generosity and sympathy would have\r\nguided the nation along very different paths. To have to go back,\r\nas China was forced to do in 1916, and begin over again the work\r\nwhich should have been performed in 1912 is a handicap which only\r\npersistent resolution can overcome; for the nation has been so\r\ngreatly impoverished that years must elapse before a complete\r\nrecovery from the disorders which have upset the internal balance\r\ncan be chronicled; and when we add that the events of the period\r\nMay-July, 1917, are likely still further to increase the burden\r\nthe nation carries, the complicated nature of the outlook will be\r\nreadily understood.\r\n\r\nHappily foreign opinion has lately taken turn for the better.\r\nWhilst the substitution of a new kind of rule in place of the Yuan\r\nShih-kai regime, with its thinly disguised Manchuism and its\r\nsecret worship of fallen gods, was at first looked upon as a\r\npolitical collapse tinged with tragedy--most foreigners refusing\r\nto believe in an Asiatic Republic--the masculine decision of the\r\n9th February, 1917, which diplomatically ranged China definitely\r\non the side of the Liberal Powers, has caused something of a volte\r\nface. Until this decision had been made it was the fashion to\r\ndeclare that China was not only not fit to be a Republic but that\r\nher final dissolution was only a matter of time. Though the empire\r\ndisappeared because it had become an impossible rule in the modern\r\nworld--being womanish, corrupt, and mediaeval--to the foreign mind\r\nthe empire remained the acme of Chinese civilization; and to kill\r\nit meant to lop off the head of the Chinese giant and to leave\r\nlying on the ground nothing but a corpse. It was in vain to insist\r\nthat this simile was wrong and that it was precisely because\r\nChinese civilization had exhausted itself that a new conception of\r\ngovernment had to be called in to renew the vitality of the\r\npeople. Men, and particularly diplomats, refused to understand\r\nthat this embodied the heart and soul of the controversy, and that\r\nthe sole mandate for the Republic, as well as the supreme reason\r\nwhy it had to be upheld if the country was not to dissolve, has\r\nalways lain in the fact that it postulates something which is the\r\nvery antithesis of the system it has replaced and which should be\r\nwholly successful in a single generation, if courage is shown and\r\nthe whip unflinchingly used.\r\n\r\nThe chief trouble, in the opinion of the writer, has been the\r\nsimplicity of the problem and not its complexity. By eliminating\r\nthe glamour which surrounded the Throne, and by kicking away all\r\nthe pomp and circumstance which formed the age-old ritual of\r\ngovernment, the glaring simplicity and barrenness of Chinese life\r\n--when contrasted with the complex West--has been made evident.\r\nBathed in the hard light of modern realities, the poetic China\r\nwhich Haroun-al-Raschid painted in his Aladdin, and which still\r\nlives in the beautiful art of the country, has vanished forever\r\nand its place has been taken by a China of prose. To those who\r\nhave always pictured Asia in terms of poetry this has no doubt\r\nbeen a very terrible thing--a thing synonymous with political\r\ndeath. And yet in point of fact the elementary things remain much\r\nas they have always been before, and if they appear to have\r\nacquired new meaning it is simply because they have been moved\r\ninto the foreground and are no longer masked by a gaudy\r\nsuperstructure.\r\n\r\nFor if you eliminate questions of money and suppose for a moment\r\nthat the national balance-sheet is entirely in order, China is the\r\nold China although she is stirred by new ideas. Here you have by\r\nfar the greatest agricultural community in the world, living just\r\nas it has always lived in the simplest possible manner, and\r\nremitting to the cities (of which there are not ten with half-a-\r\nmillion inhabitants) the increment which the harvests yield. These\r\ncities have made much municipal progress and developed an\r\nindependence which is confessedly new. Printing presses have\r\nspread a noisy assertiveness, as well as a very critical and\r\nlitigious spirit, which tends to resent and oppose authority.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The growth of the Chinese press is remarkable. Although\r\nno complete statistics are available there is reason to believe\r\nthat the number of peri-odicals in China now approximates 10,000,\r\nthe daily vernacular newspapers in Peking alone exceeding 60.\r\nAlthough no newspaper in China prints more than 20,000 copies a\r\nday, the reading public is growing at a phenomenal rate, it being\r\nestimated that at least 50 million people read the daily\r\npublications, or hear what they say,--a fact which is deemed so\r\npolitically important that all political parties and groups have\r\ntheir chains of organs throughout the country.]\r\n\r\nTrade, although constantly proclaimed to be in a bad way, is\r\nsteadily growing as new wants are created and fashions change. An\r\nimmense amount of new building has been done, particularly in\r\nthose regions which the Revolution of 1911 most devastated. The\r\narchaic fiscal system, having been tumbled into open ruin, has\r\nbeen partially replaced by European conceptions which are still\r\nonly half-understood, but which are not really opposed. The\r\ncountry, although boasting a population which is only some fifty\r\nmillions less than the population of the nineteen countries of\r\nEurope, has an army and a police-force so small as to allow one to\r\nsay that China is virtually disarmed since there are only 900,000\r\nmen with weapons in their hands. Casting about to discover what\r\nreally tinges the outlook, that must simply be held to be the long\r\ndelay the world has made in extending the same treatment to China\r\nas is now granted to the meanest community of Latin America. It\r\nhas been almost entirely this, coupled with the ever-present\r\nthreat of Japanese chauvinism, which has given China the\r\nappearance of a land that is hopelessly water-logged, although the\r\nNational Debt is relatively the smallest in the world and the\r\npeople the most industrious and law-abiding who have ever lived.\r\nIn such circumstances that ideas of collapse should have spread so\r\nfar is simply due to a faulty estimate of basic considerations.\r\n\r\nFor we have to remember that in a country in which the thoroughly\r\nEnglish doctrine of laissez faire has been so long practised that\r\nit has become second nature, and in which the philosophic spirit\r\nis so undisputed that the pillars of society are just as much the\r\nbeggars who beg as the rich men who support them, influences of a\r\npeculiar character play an immense role and can be only very\r\nslowly overcome. Passivity has been so long enthroned that of the\r\nChinese it may be truly said that they are not so much too proud\r\nto fight as too indifferent,--which is not a fruitful state of\r\naffairs. Looking on the world with callous detachment the masses\r\ngo their own way, only pausing in their work on their ancient\r\nFestival days which they still celebrate just as they have always\r\ncelebrated them since the beginning of their history. The petty\r\ndaily activities of a vast legion of people grouped together in\r\nthis extraordinary way, and actuated by impulses which seem\r\nsharply to conflict with the impulses of the other great races of\r\nthe world, appear incredible to Westerners who know what the outer\r\nperils really are, and who believe that China is not only at bay\r\nbut encircled--caught in a network of political agreements and\r\ncommitments which have permanently destroyed her power of\r\ninitiative and reduced her to inanition. To find her lumbering on\r\nundisturbed, ploughing the fields, marrying and giving in\r\nmarriage, buying, selling, cursing and laughing, carrying out\r\nrebellions and little plots as though the centuries that stretch\r\nahead were still her willing slaves, has in the end become to\r\nonlookers a veritable nightmare. Puzzled by a phenomenon which is\r\nso disconcerting as to be incapable of any clear definition, they\r\nhave ended by declaring that an empty Treasury is an empty rule,\r\nadding that as it is solely from this monetary viewpoint that the\r\nNew China ought to be judged, their opinion is the one which will\r\nfinally be accepted as authoritative. The situation is admittedly\r\ndangerous; and it is imperative that a speedy remedy be sought;\r\nfor the heirs and assigns of an estate which has been mismanaged\r\nto the brink of bankruptcy must secure at all costs that no public\r\nreceivership is made.\r\n\r\nWhat is the remedy? That must consist simply enough in attacking\r\nthe grand simplicities directly; in recognizing, as we have\r\nclearly shown that the bases of Chinese life having collapsed\r\nthrough Euro-Japanese pressure, the politico-economic relationship\r\nbetween the Republic and the world must be remodelled at the\r\nearliest possible opportunity, every agreement which has been made\r\nsince the Treaties of 1860 being carefully and completely revised.\r\n[Footnote: The mediaeval condition of Chinese trade taxation is\r\nwell illustrated by a Memorandum which the reader will find in the\r\nappendix. One example may be quoted. Timber shipped from the Yalu\r\nriver, i.e. from Chinese territory, to Peking, pays duties at five\r\ndifferent places, the total amount of which aggregates 20 per cent\r\nof its market value; whilst timber from America, with transit dues\r\nand Peking Octroi added, only pays 10 per cent! China is probably\r\nthe only country that has ever existed that discriminates against\r\nits own goods and gives preference to the foreigner,--through the\r\noperation of the Treaties.]\r\n\r\nTo say this is to give utterance to nothing very new or brilliant:\r\nit is the thought which has been present in every one's mind for a\r\nnumber of years. So far back as 1902, when Great Britain\r\nnegotiated with China the inoperative Mackay Commercial Treaty,\r\nprovision was not only made for a complete reform of the Tariff--\r\nimport duties to be made two and a half times as large in return\r\nfor a complete abolition of likin or inter-provincial trade-\r\ntaxation--but for the abolition of extraterritoriality when China\r\nshould have erected a modern and efficient judicial system. And\r\nalthough matters equally important, such as the funding of all\r\nChinese indemnities and loans into one Consolidated Debt, as well\r\nas the withdrawal of the right of foreign banks to make banknote\r\nissues in China, were not touched upon, the same principles would\r\nundoubtedly have been applied in these instances, as being\r\nconductive to the re-establishment of Chinese autonomy, had\r\nChinese negotiators been clever enough to urge them as being of\r\nequal importance to the older issues. For it is primarily debt,\r\nand the manipulation of debt, which is the great enemy.\r\n\r\nThree groups of indebtedness and three groups of restrictions,\r\ncorresponding with the three vital periods in Chinese history, lie\r\nto-day like three great weights on the body of the Chinese giant.\r\nFirst, there is the imbroglio of the Japanese war of 1894-5;\r\nsecond, the settlement following the Boxer explosion of 1900; and\r\nthird, the cost of the revolution of 1911-1912. We have already\r\ndiscussed so exhaustively the Boxer Settlement and the finance of\r\nthe Revolutionary period that it is necessary to deal with the\r\nfirst period only.\r\n\r\nIn that first period China, having been rudely handled by Japan,\r\nrecovered herself only by indulging in the sort of diplomacy which\r\nhad become traditional under the Manchus. Thankful for any help in\r\nher distress, she invited and welcomed the intervention of Russia,\r\nwhich gave her back the Liaotung Peninsula and preserved for her\r\nthe shadow of her power when the substance had already been so\r\nsensationally lost. Men are apt to forget to-day that the\r\nfinancial accommodation which allowed China to liquidate the\r\nJapanese war-debt was a remarkable transaction in which Russia\r\nformed the controlling element. In 1895 the Tsar's Government had\r\nintervened for precisely the same motives that animate every State\r\nat critical times in history, that is, for reasons of self-\r\ninterest. The rapid victory which Japan had won had revived in an\r\nacute form the whole question of the future of the vast block of\r\nterritory which lies south of the Amur regions and is bathed by\r\nthe Yellow Sea. Russian statesmen suddenly became conscious that\r\nthe policy of which Muravieff-Amurski in the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century had been the most brilliant exponent--the\r\npolicy of reaching \"warm water\"--was in danger of being crucified,\r\nand the work of many years thrown away. Action on Russia's part\r\nwas imperative; she was great enough to see that; and so that it\r\nshould not be said that she was merely depriving a gallant nation\r\nof the fruits of victory and thereby issuing to her a direct\r\nchallenge, she invited the chief Powers in Treaty relations with\r\nChina to co-operate with her in readjusting what she described as\r\nthe threatened balance. France and Germany responded to that\r\ninvitation; England demurred. France did so because she was\r\nalready the devoted Ally of a nation that was a guarantee for the\r\nsecurity of her European frontiers: Germany because she was\r\nanxious to see that Russia should be pushed into Asiatic\r\ncommitments and drawn away from the problems of the Near East.\r\nEngland on her part very prudently declined to be associated with\r\na transaction which, while not opposed to her interests, was\r\nfilled with many dubious elements.\r\n\r\nIt was in Petrograd that this account was liquidated. The\r\nextraordinary chapter which only closed with the disastrous Peace\r\nof Portsmouth opened for Russia in a very brilliant way. The\r\npresence in Moscow of the veteran statesman Li Hung-chang on the\r\noccasion of the Tsar's Coronation afforded an opportunity for\r\nexhaustively discussing the whole problem of the Far East. China\r\nrequired money: Russia required the acceptance of plans which\r\nultimately proved so disastrous to her. Under Article IV of the\r\nTreaty of Shimonoseki (April, 1895) China had agreed to pay Japan\r\nas a war-indemnity 200 million Treasury taels in eight\r\ninstalments: that is 50 million taels within six months, a further\r\n50 millions within twelve months, and the remaining 100 millions\r\nin six equal instalments spread over seven years, as well as an\r\nadditional sum of 50 millions for the retrocession of the Liaotung\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\nChina, therefore, needed at once 80 million taels. Russia\r\nundertook to lend her at the phenomenally low rate of 4 per cent\r\nthe sum of 16,000,000 pounds sterling--the interest and capital\r\nof which the Tsar's Government guaranteed to the French bankers\r\nundertaking the flotation. In return for this accommodation, the\r\nwell-known Russo-Chinese Declaration of the 24th June (6th July)\r\n1895 was made in which the vital article IX states that--\"In\r\nconsideration of this Loan the Chinese Government declares that it\r\nwill not grant to any foreign Power any right or privilege of no\r\nmatter what description touching the control or administration of\r\nthe revenues of the Chinese Empire. Should, however, the Chinese\r\nGovernment grant to any foreign Power rights of this nature, it is\r\nunderstood that the mere fact of having done so will extend those\r\nrights to the Russian Government.\"\r\n\r\nThis clause has a monumental significance: it started the scramble\r\nin China: and all the history of the past 22 years is piled like a\r\npyramid on top of it. Now that the Romanoff's have been hurled\r\nfrom the throne, Russia must prove eager to reverse the policy\r\nwhich brought Japan to her Siberian frontiers and which pinned a\r\nbrother democracy to the ground.\r\n\r\nFor China, instead of being nearly bankrupt as so many have\r\nasserted, has, thanks to the new scale of indebtedness which the\r\nwar has established, become one of the most debt-free countries in\r\nthe world, her entire national debt (exclusive of railway debt)\r\namounting to less than 150 millions sterling, or seven shillings\r\nper head of population, which is certainly not very terrible. No\r\nstudent who has given due attention to the question can deny that\r\nit is primarily on the proper handling of this nexus of financial\r\ninterests, and not by establishing any artificial balance of power\r\nbetween foreign nations, that the peace of the Far East really\r\nhinges. The method of securing national redemption is ready-made;\r\nWestern nations should use the Parliament of China as an\r\ninstrument of reform, and by limiting themselves to this one\r\nmethod secure that civil authority is reinforced to such a point\r\nthat its behests have behind them all the wealth of the West. In\r\nquestions of currency, taxation, railways and every other\r\nvexatious problem, it is solely by using this instrument that\r\nsatisfactory results can be attained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: We need only give a single example of what we mean. If,\r\nin the matter of the reform of the currency, instead of\r\nauthorizing trade-agencies, i.e. the foreign Exchange Banks, to\r\nmake a loan to China, which is necessarily hedged round with\r\nconditions favourable to such trade-agencies, the Powers took the\r\nmatter directly in their own hands; and selecting the Bank of\r\nChina--the national fiscal agent--as the instrument of reform\r\nagreed to advance all the sums necessary, PROVIDED a Banking Law\r\nwas passed by the Parliament of China of a satisfying nature, and\r\nthe necessary guarantees were forthcoming, it would soon be\r\npossible to have a uniform National Currency which would be\r\neverywhere accepted and lead to a phenomenal trade expansion. It\r\nshould be noted that China is still on a Copper Standard basis,--\r\nthe people's buying and selling being conducted in multiples of\r\ncopper cent-pieces of which there has been an immense over-issue,\r\nthe latest figures showing that there are no less than\r\n22,000,000,000 1-cent, ten cash pieces in circulation or 62 coins\r\nper head of population--roughly twenty-five millions sterling in\r\nvalue,--or 160,000 tons of copper! The number of silver dollars\r\nand subsidiary silver coins is not accurately known,--nor is the\r\nvalue of the silver bullion; but it certainly cannot greatly\r\nexceed this sum. In addition there is about 15,000,000 pounds of\r\npaper money. A comprehensive scheme of reform, placed in the hands\r\nof the Bank of China, would require at least 15,000,000 pounds;\r\nbut this sum would be sufficient to modernize the currency and\r\nestablish a universal silver dollar standard.\r\n\r\nThe Bank of China requires at least 600 branches throughout the\r\ncountry to become a true fiscal agent. It has today one-tenth of\r\nthis number.]\r\n\r\nFor once Chinese realize that parliamentary government is not\r\nmerely an experimental thing but the last chance the country is to\r\nbe given to govern itself, they will rally to the call and prove\r\nthat much of the trouble and turmoil of past years has been due to\r\nthe misunderstanding of the internal problem by Western minds,\r\nwhich has incited the population to intrigue against one another\r\nand remain disunited. And if we insist that there is urgent need\r\nfor a settlement of these matters in the terms we have indicated,\r\nit is because we know very prcisely what Japanese thought on this\r\nsubject really is.\r\n\r\nWhat is that thought--whither does it lead?\r\n\r\nIt may be broadly said that Japanese activities throughout the Far\r\nEast are based on a thorough and adequate appreciation of the fact\r\nthat apart from the winning of the hegemony of China, there is the\r\nfar more difficult and knotty problem of overshadowing and\r\nultimately dislodging the huge network of foreign interests--\r\nparticularly British interests--which seventy-five years of Treaty\r\nintercourse have entwined about the country. These interests,\r\ngrowing out of the seed planted in the early Canton Factory days,\r\nhad their origin in the termination by the act of the British\r\nGovernment of the trading monopoly enjoyed until the thirties of\r\nlast century by the East India Company. Left without proper\r\ndefinition until the Treaty of Nanking in 1842 had formally won\r\nthe principle of trading-rights at five open ports, and thus\r\nestablished a first basis of agreement between England and China\r\n(to which all the trading powers hastened to subscribe), these\r\ninterests expanded in a half-hearted way until 1860, when in order\r\nto terminate friction, the principle of extraterritoriality was\r\nboldly borrowed from the Turkish Capitulations, and made the rock\r\non which the entire fabric of international dealings in China was\r\nbased. These treaties, with their always-recurring \"most-favoured\r\nnation\" clause, and their implication of equal treatment for all\r\nPowers alike, constitute the Public Law of the Far East, just as\r\nmuch as the Treaties between the Nations constitute the Public Law\r\nof Europe; and any attempt to destroy, cripple, or limit their\r\nscope and function has been very generally deemed an assault on\r\nall the High Contracting Parties alike. By a thoroughly\r\nMachiavellian piece of reasoning, those who have been responsible\r\nfor the framing of recent Japanese policy, have held it essential\r\nto their plan to keep the world chained to the principle of\r\nextraterritoriality and Chinese Tariff and economic subjection\r\nbecause these things, imposing as they necessarily do restrictions\r\nand limitations in many fields, leave it free to the Japanese to\r\nplace themselves outside and beyond these restrictions and\r\nlimitations; and, by means of special zones and secret\r\nencroachments, to extend their influence so widely that ultimately\r\nforeign treaty-ports and foreign interests may be left isolated\r\nand at the mercy of the \"Higher machinery\" which their hegemony is\r\ninstalling. The Chinese themselves, it is hoped, will be gradually\r\ncajoled into acquiescing in this very extraordinary state of\r\naffairs, because being unorganized and split into suspicious\r\ngroups, they can be manipulated in such a way as to offer no\r\neffective mass resistance to the Japanese advance, and in the end\r\nmay be induced to accept it as inevitable.\r\n\r\nIf the reader keeps these great facts carefully in mind, a new\r\nlight will dawn on him and the urgency of the Chinese question\r\nwill be disclosed. The Japanese Demands of 1915, instead of being\r\nfantastic and far-fetched, as many have supposed, are shown to be\r\nvery intelligently drawn-up, the entire Treaty position in China\r\nhaving been most exhaustively studied, and every loophole into the\r\nvast region left untouched by the exterritorialized Powers marked\r\ndown for invasion. For Western nations, in spite of exorbitant\r\ndemands at certain periods in Chinese history, having mainly\r\nlimited themselves to acquiring coastal and communication\r\nprivileges, which were desired more for genuine purposes of trade\r\nthan for encompassing the destruction of Chinese autonomy, are to-\r\nday in a disadvantageous position which the Japanese have shown\r\nthey thoroughly understand by not only tightening their hold on\r\nManchuria and Shantung, but by going straight to the root of the\r\nmatter and declaring on every possible occasion that they alone\r\nare responsible for the peace and safety of the Far East,--and\r\nthis in spite of the fact that their plan of 1915 was exposed and\r\npartially frustrated. But the chief force behind the Japanese\r\nForeign Office, it should be noted, is militarist; and it is a\r\npoint of honour for the Military Party to return to the charge in\r\nChina again and again until there is definite success or definite\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nNow in view of the facts which have been so voluminously set forth\r\nin preceding chapters, it is imperative for men to realize that\r\nthe struggle in the Far East is like the Balkan Question a thing\r\nrooted in geography and peoples, and cannot be brushed aside or\r\nsettled by compromises. The whole future of Chinese civilization\r\nis intimately bound up with the questions involved, and the\r\nproblem instead of becoming easier to handle must become\r\nessentially more difficult from day to day. Japan's real objective\r\nbeing the termination of the implied trusteeship which Europe and\r\nAmerica still exercise in the Far East, the course of the European\r\nwar must intimately effect the ultimate outcome. If that end is\r\nsatisfactory for democracies, China may reasonably claim to share\r\nin the resulting benefits; if on the other hand, the Liberal\r\nPowers do not win an overwhelming victory which shall secure the\r\nsanctity of Treaties for all time, it will go hard for China.\r\nOutwardly, the immediate goal which Japan seeks to attain is\r\nmerely to become the accredited spokesman of Eastern Asia, the\r\nofficial representative; and, using this attorneyship as a cloak\r\nfor the advancement of objects which other Powers would pursue on\r\ndifferent principles, so impregnably to entrench herself where she\r\nwas no business to be that no one will dare to attempt to turn her\r\nout. For this reason we see revived in Manchuria on a modified\r\nscale the Eighteenth Century device, once so essential a feature\r\nof Dutch policy in the struggle against Louis XIV, namely the\r\ncreation of \"barrier-cities\" for closing and securing a frontier\r\nby giving them a special constitution which withdraws them from\r\nordinary jurisdiction and places foreign garrisons in them. This\r\nis precisely what is going on from the Yalu to Eastern Mongolia,\r\nand this procedure no doubt will be extended in time to other\r\nregions as opportunities arise. Already in Shantung the same\r\npolicy is being pursued and there are indications that it is being\r\nthought of in Fuhkien; whilst the infantry garrison which was\r\nquietly installed at Hankow--600 miles up the Yangtsze river--at\r\nthe time of the Revolution of 1911 is apparently to be made\r\npermanent. Allowing her policy to be swayed by men who know far\r\ntoo little of the sea, Japan stands in imminent danger of\r\nforgetting the great lesson which Mahan taught, that for island-\r\npeoples sea-power is everything and that land conquests which\r\ndiminish the efficacy of that power are merely a delusion and\r\nsnare. Plunging farther and farther into the vast regions of\r\nManchuria and Mongolia which have been the graves of a dozen\r\ndynasties, Japan is displaying increasing indifference for the one\r\ngreat lesson which the war has yielded--the overwhelming\r\nimportance of the sea. [Footnote: It should be carefully noted\r\nthat not only has Japan no unfriendly feelings for Germany but\r\nthat German Professors have been appointed to office during the\r\nwar. In the matter of enemy trading Japan's policy has been even\r\nmore extraordinary. Until there was a popular outcry among the\r\nEntente Allies, German merchants were allowed to trade more or\r\nless as usual. They were not denied the use of Japanese steamers,\r\nshipping companies being simply \"advised\" not to deal with them,\r\nthe two German banks in Yokohama and Kobe being closed only in the\r\nAutumn of 1916. It was not until April, 1917, that Enemy Trading\r\nRegulations were formally promulgated and enforced,--that is when\r\nthe war was very far advanced--the action of China against Germany\r\nbeing no doubt largely responsible for this step. That the\r\nJapanese nation greatly admires the German system of government\r\nand is in the main indifferent to the results of the war has long\r\nbeen evident to observers on the spot.] Necessarily guardian of\r\nthe principles on which intercourse in Asia is based, because she\r\nframed those principles and fought for them and has built up great\r\nedifices under their sanction, British sea-power--now allied\r\nforever, let us hope, with American power--nevertheless remains\r\nand will continue to remain, in spite of what may be half-\r\nsurreptitiously done to-day, the dominant factor in the Far East\r\nas it is in the Far West. Withdrawn from view for the time being,\r\nbecause of the exigencies of the hour, and because the Anglo-\r\nJapanese Alliance is still counted a binding agreement, Western\r\nsea-power nevertheless stands there, a heavy cloud in the offing,\r\nfull of questionings regarding what is going on in the Orient, and\r\nfully determined, let us pray, one day to receive frank answers.\r\nFor the right of every race, no matter how small or weak, to enjoy\r\nthe inestimable benefits of self-government and independence may\r\nbe held to have been so absolutely established that it is a mere\r\nquestion of time for the doctrine not only to be universally\r\naccepted but to be universally applied. In many cases, it is true,\r\nthe claims of certain races are as yet incapable of being\r\nexpressed in practical state-forms; but where nationalities have\r\nlong been well-defined, there can be no question whatsoever that a\r\nproperly articulated autonomy must be secured in such a way as to\r\npreclude the possibility of annexations.\r\n\r\nNow although in their consideration of Asia it is notorious that\r\nWestern statesmen have not cared to keep in mind political\r\nconcepts which have become enthroned in Europe, owing to the fact\r\nthat an active element of opposition to such concepts was to be\r\nfound in their own policies, a vast change has undoubtedly been\r\nrecently worked, making it certain that the claims of nationalism\r\nare soon to be given the same force and value in the East as in\r\nthe West. But before there can be any question of Asia for the\r\nAsiatics being adopted as a root principle by the whole world, it\r\nwill have to be established in some unmistakable form that the\r\nsurrender of the policy of conquest which Europe has pursued for\r\nfour centuries East of the Suez Canal will not lead to its\r\nadoption by an Asiatic Power under specious forms which hide the\r\nglittering sword. If that can be secured, then the present\r\nconflict will have truly been a War of Liberation for the East as\r\nwell as for the West. For although Japan has been engaged for some\r\nyears in declaring to all Asiatics under her breath that she holds\r\nout the hand of a brother to them, and dreams of the days when the\r\nage of European conquests will be nothing but a distant memory,\r\nher actions have consistently belied her words and shown that she\r\nhas not progressed in political thought much beyond the crude\r\nconceptions of the Eighteenth Century. Thus Korea, which fell\r\nunder her sway because the nominal independence of the country had\r\nlong made it the centre of disastrous international intrigues, is\r\ngoverned to-day as a conquered province by a military viceroy\r\nwithout a trace of autonomy remaining and without any promise that\r\nsuch a regime is only temporary. Although nothing in the\r\nundertakings made with the Powers has ever admitted that a nation\r\nwhich boasts of an ancient line of kings, and which gave Japan\r\nmuch of her own civilization, should be stamped under foot in such\r\nmanner, the course which politics have taken in Korea has been\r\ndisastrous in the extreme ever since Lord Lansdowne in 1905, as\r\nBritish Secretary for Foreign Affairs, pointed out in a careful\r\ndispatch to the Russian Government that Korea was a region which\r\nfell naturally under the sway of Japan. Not only has a tragic fate\r\novercome the sixteen million inhabitants of that country, but\r\nthere has been a covert extension of the principles applied to\r\nthem to the people of China. Now if as we say European concepts\r\nare to have universal meaning, and if Japan desires European\r\ntreatment, it is time that it is realized that the policy followed\r\nin Korea, combined with the attempt to extend that treatment to\r\nsoil where China rightly claims undisputed sovereignty, forms an\r\ninsuperable barrier to Japan being admitted to the inner council\r\nof the nations. [Footnote: A very remarkable confirmation of these\r\nstatements is afforded in the latest Japanese decision regarding\r\nManchuria which will be immediately enforced. The experience of\r\nthe past three years having proved conclusively that the Chinese,\r\nin spite of their internal strife, are united to a man in their\r\ndetermination to prevent Japan from tightening her hold on\r\nManchuria and instituting an open Protectorate, the Tokio\r\nGovernment has now drawn up a subtle scheme which it is believed\r\nwill be effective. A Bill for the unification of administration in\r\nSouth Manchuria has passed the Japanese Cabinet Conference and\r\nwill soon be formally promulgated. Under the provisions of this\r\nBill, the Manchuria Railway Company will become the actual organ\r\nof Japanese administration in South Manchuria; the Japanese\r\nConsular Service will be subordinate to the administration of the\r\nRailway; and all the powers hitherto vested in the Consular\r\nService, political, commercial, judicial and administrative, will\r\nbe made part of the organization of the South Manchuria Railway.\r\nThis is not all. From another Japanese source we learn that a law\r\nis about to take effect by which the administration of the South\r\nManchuria Railway will be transferred directly to the control of\r\nthe Government-General of Korea, thus making the Railway at once\r\nan apparently commercial but really political organization. In\r\nfuture the revenues of the South Manchuria Railway are to be paid\r\ndirect to the Government-General of Korea; and the yearly\r\nappropriation for the upkeep and administration of the Railway is\r\nto be fixed at Yen 19,000,000. These arrangements, especially the\r\namalgamation of the South Manchuria Railway, are to take effect\r\nfrom the 1st July, 1917, and are an attempt to do in the dark what\r\nJapan dares not yet attempt in the open.] No one wishes to deny to\r\nJapan her proper place in the world, in view of her marvellous\r\nindustrial progress, but that place must be one which fits in with\r\nmodern conceptions and is not one thing to the West and another to\r\nthe East. Even the saying which was made so much of during the\r\nRussian war of 1904, that Korea in foreign hands was a dagger\r\npointed at the heart of Japan--has been shown to be inherently\r\nfalse by the lessons of the present struggle, the Korean dagger-\r\npoint being 120 sea miles from the Japanese coast. Such arguments\r\nclearly show that if the truce which was hastily patched up in\r\n1905 is to give way to a permanent peace, that can be evolved only\r\nby locking on to the Far East the principles which are in process\r\nof being vindicated in Europe. In other words, precisely as Poland\r\nis to be given autonomy, so must Korea enjoy the same privileges,\r\nthe whole Japanese theory of suzerainty on the Eastern Asiatic\r\nContinent being abandoned. To re-establish a proper balance of\r\npower in the Far East, the Korean nation, which has had a known\r\nhistorical existence of 1,500 years, must be reinstated in\r\nsomething resembling its old position; for Korea has always been\r\nthe keystone of the Far Eastern arch, and it is the destruction of\r\nthat arch more than anything else which has brought the collapse\r\nof China so perilously near.\r\n\r\nOnce the legitimate aspirations of the Korean people have been\r\nsatisfied, the whole Manchurian-Mongolian question will assume a\r\ndifferent aspect, and a true peace between China and Japan will be\r\nmade possible. It is to no one's interest to have a Polish\r\nquestion in the Far East with all the bitterness and the crimes\r\nwhich such a question must inevitably lead to; and the time to\r\nobviate the creation of such a question is at the very beginning\r\nbefore it has become an obsession and a great international issue.\r\nAlthough the Japanese annexation may be held to have settled the\r\nquestion once and for all, we have but to point to Poland to show\r\nthat a race can pass through every possible humiliation and endure\r\nevery possible species of truncation without dying or abating by\r\none whit its determination to enjoy what happier races have won.\r\n\r\nThe issue is a vital one. China by her recent acts has given a\r\ncategorical and unmistakable reply to all the insidious attempts\r\nto place her outside and beyond the operation of international law\r\nand all those sanctions which make life worth living; and because\r\nof the formal birth of a Foreign Policy it can be definitely\r\nexpected that this nation, despite its internal troubles and\r\nstruggles, will never rest content until she has created a new\r\nnexus of world-relationships which shall affirm and apply every\r\none of the principles experience elsewhere has proved are the\r\nabsolute essentials to peace and happiness. China is already many\r\ndecades ahead of Japan in her theory of government, no matter what\r\nthe practice may be, the marvellous revolution of 1911 having\r\ngiven back to this ancient race its old position of leader in\r\nideas on the shores of the Yellow Sea. The whole dream Japan has\r\ncherished, and has sought to give form to during the war, is in\r\nthe last analysis antiquated and forlorn and must ultimately\r\ndissolve into thin air; for it is monstrous to suppose, in an age\r\nwhen European men have sacrificed everything to free themselves\r\nfrom the last vestiges of feudalism, that in the Far East the cult\r\nof Sparta should remain a hallowed and respected doctrine. Japan's\r\npolicy in the Far East during the period of the war has been\r\nuniformly mischievous and is largely responsible for the fierce\r\nhatreds which burst out in 1917 over the war issue; and China will\r\nbe forced to raise at the earliest possible moment the whole\r\nquestion of the validity of the undertakings extorted from her in\r\n1915 under the threat of an ultimatum. Although the precise nature\r\nof Anglo-Japanese diplomacy during the vital eleven days from the\r\n4th to the 15th August, 1914, [i. e. from the British declaration\r\nof war on Germany to the Japanese ultimatum regarding Kiaochow]\r\nremains a sealed book, China suspects that Japan from the very\r\nbeginning of the present war world-struggle has taken advantage of\r\nEngland's vast commitments and acted ultra vires. China hopes and\r\nbelieves that Britain will never again renew the Japanese\r\nalliance, which expires in 1921, in its present form, particularly\r\nnow that an Anglo-American agreement has been made possible. China\r\nknows that in spite of all coquetting with both the extreme\r\nradical and military parties which is going on daily in Peking and\r\nthe provinces, the secret object of Japanese diplomacy is either\r\nthe restoration of the Manchu dynasty, or the enthronement of some\r\npliant usurper, a puppet-Emperor being what is needed to repeat in\r\nChina the history of Korea. Japan would be willing to go to any\r\nlengths to secure the attainment of this reactionary object.\r\nFaithful to her \"divine mission,\" she is ceaselessly stirring up\r\ntrouble and hoping that time may still be left her to consolidate\r\nher position on the Asiatic mainland, one of her latest methods\r\nbeing to busy herself at distant points in the Pacific so that\r\nWestern men for the sake of peace may be ultimately willing to\r\nabandon the shores of the Yellow Seas to her unchallenged mastery.\r\n\r\nThe problem thus outlined becomes a great dramatic thing. The\r\nlines which trace the problem are immense, stretching from China\r\nto every shore bathed by the Pacific and then from there to the\r\ndistant west. Whenever there is a dull calm, that calm must be\r\ntreated solely as an intermission, an interval between the acts, a\r\npreparation for something more sensational than the last episode,\r\nbut not as a permanent settlement which can only come by the\r\nmethods we have indicated. For the Chinese question is no longer a\r\nlocal problem, but a great world-issue which statesmen must\r\nregulate by conferences in which universal principles will be\r\nvindicated if they wish permanently to eliminate what is almost\r\nthe last remaining international powder-magazine. A China that is\r\nhenceforth not only admitted to the family of nations on terms of\r\nequality but welcomed as a representative of Liberalism and a\r\nsubscriber to all those sanctions on which the civilization of\r\npeace rests, will directly tend to adjust every other Asiatic\r\nproblem and to prevent a recrudescence of those evil phenomena\r\nwhich are the enemies of progress and happiness. Is it too much to\r\ndream of such a consummation? We think not. It is to America and\r\nto England that China looks to rehabilitate herself and to make\r\nher Republic a reality. If they lend her their help, if they are\r\nconsistent, there is still no reason why this democracy on the\r\nshores of the Yellow Sea should not be reinstated in the proud\r\nposition it occupied twenty centuries ago, when it furnished the\r\nvery silks which clothed the daughters of the Caesars.\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n DOCUMENTS IN GROUP I\r\n\r\n(1) The so-called Nineteen Articles, being the grant made by the\r\nThrone after the outbreak of the Wuchang Rebellion in 1911 in a\r\nvain attempt to satisfy the nation.\r\n\r\n(2) The Abdication Edicts issued on the 12th February, 1912,\r\nendorsing the establishment of the Republic.\r\n\r\n(3) The terms of abdication, generally referred to as \"The\r\narticles of Favourable Treatment,\" in which special provision is\r\nmade for the \"rights\" of Manchus, Mongols, Mohammedans and\r\nTibetans, who are considered as being outside the Chinese nation.\r\n\r\n THE NINETEEN ARTICLES\r\n\r\n1.

Yuan Shih-kai was, therefore, especially commanded some\r\ntime ago to dispatch commissioners to confer with the\r\nrepresentatives of the Republican Army on the general situation\r\nand to discuss matters pertaining to the convening of a National\r\nAssembly for the decision of the suitable mode of settlement has\r\nbeen discovered. Separated as the South and the North are by great\r\ndistances, the unwillingness of either side to yield to the other\r\ncan result only in the continued interruption of trade and the\r\nprolongation of hostilities, for, so long as the form of\r\ngovernment is undecided, the Nation can have no peace. It is now\r\nevident that the hearts of the majority of the people are in\r\nfavour of a republican form of government: the provinces of the\r\nSouth were the first to espouse the cause, and the generals of the\r\nNorth have since pledged their support. From the preference of the\r\npeople's hearts, the Will of Heaven can be discerned. How could We\r\nthen bear to oppose the will of the millions for the glory of one\r\nFamily! Therefore, observing the tendencies of the age on the one\r\nhand and studying the opinions of the people on the other, We and\r\nHis Majesty the Emperor hereby vest the sovereignty in the People\r\nand decide in favour of a republican form of constitutional\r\ngovernment. Thus we would gratify on the one hand the desires of\r\nthe whole nation who, tired of anarchy, are desirous of peace, and\r\non the other hand would follow in the footsteps of the Ancient\r\nSages, who regarded the Throne as the sacred trust of the Nation.\r\n\r\nNow Yuan Shih-kai was elected by the Tucheng-yuan to be the\r\nPremier. During this period of transference of government from the\r\nold to the new, there should be some means of uniting the South\r\nand the North. Let Yuan Shih-kai organize with full powers a\r\nprovisional republican government and confer with the Republican\r\nArmy as to the methods of union, thus assuring peace to the people\r\nand tranquillity to the Empire, and forming the one Great Republic\r\nof China by the union as heretofore, of the five peoples, namely,\r\nManchus, Chinese, Mongols, Mohammedans, and Tibetans together with\r\ntheir territory in its integrity. We and His Majesty the Emperor,\r\nthus enabled to live in retirement, free from responsibilities,\r\nand cares and passing the time in ease and comfort, shall enjoy\r\nwithout interruption the courteous treatment of the Nation and see\r\nwith Our own eyes the consummation of an illustrious government.\r\nIs not this highly advisable?\r\n\r\nBearing the Imperial Seal and Signed by Yuan Shih-kai, the\r\nPremier;\r\n\r\nHoo Wei-teh, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs;\r\n\r\nChao Ping-chun, Minister of the Interior;\r\n\r\nTan Hsuch-heng, Acting Minister of Navy;\r\n\r\nHsi Yen, Acting Minister of Agriculture, Works and Commerce;\r\n\r\nLiang Shih-yi, Acting Minister of Communications;\r\n\r\nTa Shou, Acting Minister of the Dependencies. 25th day of the 12th\r\nmoon of the 3rd year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWe have respectfully received the following Imperial Edict from\r\nHer Imperial Majesty the Empress Dowager Lung Yu:--\r\n\r\nOn account of the perilous situation of the State and the intense\r\nsufferings of the people, We some time ago commanded the Cabinet\r\nto negotiate with the Republican Army the terms for the courteous\r\ntreatment of the Imperial House, with a view to a peaceful\r\nsettlement. According to the memorial now submitted to Us by the\r\nCabinet embodying the articles of courteous treatment proposed by\r\nthe Republican Army, they undertake to hold themselves responsible\r\nfor the perpetual offering of sacrifices before the Imperial\r\nAncestral Temples and the Imperial Mausolea and the completion as\r\nplanned of the Mausoleum of His Late Majesty the Emperor Kuang\r\nHsu. His Majesty the Emperor is understood to resign only his\r\npolitical power, while the Imperial Title is not abolished. There\r\nhave also been concluded eight articles for the courteous\r\ntreatment of the Imperial House, four articles for the favourable\r\ntreatment of Manchus, Mongols, Mohammedans, and Tibetans. We find\r\nthe terms of perusal to be fairly comprehensive. We hereby\r\nproclaim to the Imperial Kinsmen and the Manchus, Mongols,\r\nMohammedans, and Tibetans that they should endeavour in the future\r\nto fuse and remove all racial differences and prejudices and\r\nmaintain law and order with united efforts. It is our sincere hope\r\nthat peace will once more be seen in the country and all the\r\npeople will enjoy happiness under a republican government.\r\n\r\nBearing the Imperial Seal and Signed by Yuan Shih-kai, the\r\nPremier;\r\n\r\nHoo Wei-teh, Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs;\r\n\r\nChao Ping-chun, Minister of the Interior;\r\n\r\nTan Hsuen-heng, Acting Minister of the Navy;\r\n\r\nHsi Yen, Acting Minister of Agriculture, Works and Commerce;\r\n\r\nLiang Shih-yi, Acting Minister of Communications;\r\n\r\nTa Shou, Acting Minister of the Dependencies. 25th day of the 12th\r\nmoon of the 3rd year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nWe have respectfully received the following Edict from Her\r\nImperial Majesty the Empress Dowager Lung Yu:--\r\n\r\nIn ancient times the ruler of a country emphasized the important\r\nduty of protecting the lives of his people, and as their shepherd\r\ncould not have the heart to cause them injury. Now the newly\r\nestablished form of government has for its sole object the\r\nappeasement of the present disorder with a view to the restoration\r\nof peace. If, however, renewed warfare were to be indefinitely\r\nmaintained, by disregarding the opinion of the majority of the\r\npeople, the general condition of the country might be\r\nirretrievably ruined, and there might follow mutual slaughter\r\namong the people, resulting in the horrible effects of a racial\r\nwar. As a consequence, the spirits of Our Imperial Ancestors might\r\nbe greatly disturbed and millions of people might be terrorized.\r\nThe evil consequences cannot be described. Between the two evils,\r\nWe have adopted the lesser one. Such is the motive of the Throne\r\nin modelling its policy in accordance with the progress of time,\r\nthe change of circumstances, and the earnest desires of Our\r\nPeople. Our Ministers and subjects both in and out of the\r\nMetropolis should, in conformity with Our idea, consider most\r\ncarefully the public weal and should not cause the country and the\r\npeople to suffer from the evil consequences of a stubborn pride\r\nand of prejudiced opinions.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of the Interior, the General Commandant of the\r\nGendarmerie, Chiang Kuei-ti, and Feng Kuo-chang, are ordered to\r\ntake strict precautions, and to make explanations to the peoples\r\nso clearly and precisely as to enable every and all of them to\r\nunderstand the wish of the Throne to abide by the ordinance of\r\nheaven, to meet the public opinion of the people and to be just\r\nand unselfish.\r\n\r\nThe institution of the different offices by the State has been for\r\nthe welfare of the people, and the Cabinet, the various Ministries\r\nin the Capital, the Vice-royalties, Governorships,\r\nCommissionerships, and Taotaiships, have therefore been\r\nestablished for the safe protection of the people, and not for the\r\nbenefit of one man or of one family. Metropolitan and Provincial\r\nofficials of all grades should ponder over the present\r\ndifficulties and carefully perform their duties. We hereby hold it\r\nthe duty of the senior officials earnestly to advise and warn\r\ntheir subordinates not to shirk their responsibilities, in order\r\nto conform with Our original sincere intention to love and to take\r\ncare of Our people.\r\n\r\nBearing the Imperial Seal and Signed by Yuan Shih-kai, the\r\nPremier;\r\n\r\nHoo Wei-teh, Minister of Foreign Affairs;\r\n\r\nChao-ping-chun, Minister of the Interior;\r\n\r\nTan Hseuh-heng, Acting Minister of the Navy;\r\n\r\nHsi Yen, Acting Minister of Agriculture, Works and Commerce;\r\n\r\nLiang Shih-yi, Acting Minister of Communications;\r\n\r\nTa Shou, Acting Minister of the Dependencies.\r\n\r\n25th day of the 12th moon of the 3rd year of Hsuan Tung.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF ABDICATION\r\n\r\nN.B.

The organization for the legislative organ of the hsien\r\ndistrict shall be fixed by law.\r\n\r\nTARIFF REVISION IN CHINA\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of a memorandum prepared by the\r\nMinistry of Agriculture and Commerce regarding abolition of likin\r\nand an increase of the Customs duties:--\r\n\r\nTHE MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n\"Disproportionate taxation on commodities at inland towns and\r\ncities tends to cripple the productive power of a country. Acting\r\nupon this principle, France in the 17th, England, America, Germany\r\nand Austria in the 18th Century abolished such kind of taxation,\r\nthe Customs tariff remaining, which is a levy on imports at the\r\nfirst port of entry. Its purpose is to increase the cost of\r\nproduction of imported goods and to serve as a protection of\r\nnative products (sic). Raw materials from abroad are, however,\r\nexempt from Customs duty in order to provide cheap material for\r\nhome manufactures. An altogether different state of affairs,\r\nhowever, exists in this country. Likin stations are found\r\nthroughout the country, while raw materials are taxed. Take the\r\nHangchow silk for instance. When transported to the Capital for\r\nsale, it has to pay a tax on raw material of 18 per cent. Foreign\r\nimported goods on the other hand, are only taxed at the rate of\r\nfive per cent, ad valorem Customs duty at the first port of entry\r\nwith another 2.5 per cent, transit duty at one of the other ports\r\nthrough which the goods pass. Besides these only landing duty is\r\nimposed upon imported goods at the port of destination. Upon\r\ntimber being shipped from Fengtien and Antung to Peking, it has to\r\npay duties at five different places, the total amount of which\r\naggregates 20 per cent, of its market value, while timber from\r\nAmerican is taxed only ten per cent. Timber from Jueichow to\r\nHankow and Shanghai is taxed at six different places, the total\r\namount of duty paid aggregating 17.5 per cent., while timber\r\nimported from abroad to these ports is required to pay Customs\r\nduty only one-third thereof. The above-mentioned rates on native\r\ngoods are the minimum. Not every merchant can, however, obtain\r\nsuch special \"exemption,\" without a long negotiation and special\r\narrangements with the authorities. Otherwise, a merchant must pay\r\n25 per cent, of the market value of his goods as duty. For this\r\nreason the import of timber into this country has greatly\r\nincreased within the last few years, the total amount of which\r\nbeing valued at $13,000,000 a year. Is this not a great injustice\r\nto native merchants?\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE METHOD\r\n\r\n\"Respecting the improvement of the economic condition of the\r\npeople, a country can hardly attain this object without developing\r\nits foreign commerce. The United States of America, Germany and\r\nJapan have one by one abolished their export duty as well as made\r\nappropriations for subsidies to encourage the export of certain\r\nkinds of commodities. We, on the other hand, impose likin all\r\nalong the line upon native commodities destined for foreign market\r\nin addition to export duty. Goods for foreign market are more\r\nheavily taxed than for home consumption. Take the Chekiang silk\r\nfor instance. Silk for export is more heavily taxed than that for\r\nhome use. Different rates of taxation are imposed upon tea for\r\nforeign and home market. Other kinds of native products for export\r\nare also heavily taxed with the result that, within the last two\r\ndecades, the annual exports of this country are exceeded by\r\nimports by over Tls. 640,000,000,000. From the 32nd year of the\r\nreign of Kuang Hsu to the 4th year of the Republic, imports exceed\r\nexports on the average by Tls. 120,000,000. These figures speak\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nLIKIN\r\n\r\n\"Likin stations have been established at places where railway\r\ncommunication is available. This has done a good deal of harm to\r\ntransportation and the railway traffic. Lately a proposal has been\r\nmade in certain quarters that likin stations along the railways be\r\nabolished; and the measure has been adopted by the Peking-Tientsin\r\nand Tientsin-Pukow Railways at certain places. When the towns and\r\ncities throughout the country are connected by railways, there\r\nwill be no place for likin stations. With the increase in the\r\nnumber of treaty ports, the \"likin zone\" will be gradually\r\ndiminished. Thencefrom the proceeds from likin will be decreased\r\nyear by year.\r\n\r\n\"Owing to the collection of likin the development of both home and\r\nforeign trade has been arrested and the people are working under\r\ngreat disadvantages. Hence in order to develop foreign and home\r\ntrade, the Government must do away with likin, which will bring\r\nback business prosperity, and in time the same will enable the\r\nGovernment to obtain new sources of revenues.\r\n\r\n\"From the above-mentioned considerations, the Government can\r\nhardly develop and encourage trade without the abolition of likin.\r\nBy treaty with Great Britain, America and Japan, the Government\r\ncan increase the rate of Customs tariff to cover losses due to the\r\nabolition of likin. The question under consideration is not a new\r\none. But the cause which has prevented the Government from\r\nreaching a prompt decision upon this question is the fear that,\r\nafter the abolition of likin, the proceeds from the increased\r\nCustoms tariff would not be sufficient to cover the shortage\r\ncaused by the abolition of likin.\r\n\r\nCOST OF ABOLITION OF LIKIN\r\n\r\nBut such a fear should disappear when the Authorities remember the\r\nfollowing facts:--\r\n\r\n(a) The loss as the result of the abolition of likin: $38,900,000.\r\n\r\n(b) The loss as the result of the abolition of a part of duty\r\ncollected by the native Customs houses: $7,300,000.\r\n\r\n(c) Annual proceeds from different kinds of principal and\r\nmiscellaneous taxes which shall be done away with the abolition of\r\nlikin $11,800,000.\r\n\r\nThe above figures are determined by comparing the actual amount of\r\nproceeds collected by the Government in the 3rd and 4th years of\r\nthe Republic with the estimated amount in the Budget of the fifth\r\nyear. The total amount of loss caused by the abolition of likin\r\nwill be $58,000,000.\r\n\r\nINCREASE OF CUSTOMS TARIFF\r\n\r\nThe amount of increase in the Customs tariff which the Government\r\nexpects to collect is as follows:--\r\n\r\n(a) The increase in import duties $29,000,000.\r\n\r\n(b) The increase in export duties Tls. 6,560,000.\r\n\r\nThe above figures are determined according to the Customs returns\r\nof the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years of the Republic. By deducting Tls.\r\n2,200,000 of transit duty, the net increase will be Tls.\r\n33,600,000 taels, which is equal to $48,500,000. For the sake of\r\nprudence, allowance of five per cent, of the total amount is made\r\nagainst any incidental shortage. The net revenue thus increased\r\nwould amount to $46,100,000. Against the loss of $58,000,000,\r\nthere will be a shortage of some $11,900,000. This, however, will\r\nnot be difficult to make good by new sources of revenue as the\r\nresult of a tariff revision:--\r\n\r\n(a) Tax on goods at the time of manufacture $800,000.\r\n\r\n(b) Tax on goods at the time of sale $8,000,000.\r\n\r\n(c) Tax on cattle and slaughtering houses $2,000,000.\r\n\r\n(d) Tax on foodstuffs $4,000,000.\r\n\r\n\"Under (a) and (b) are the taxes to be collected on native made\r\nforeign imitation goods and various kinds of luxurious articles.\r\nUnder (c) and (d) are taxes which are already enforced in the\r\nprovinces but which can be increased to that much by reorganizing\r\nthe method of collection. The total sum of the proceeds set forth\r\nunder above items will amount to $14,800,000. These will be quite\r\nsufficient to cover the loss caused by the abolition of likin.\r\n\r\nA VITAL INTEREST\r\n\r\n\"As the abolition of likin concerns the vital interest of the\r\nmerchants and manufacturers, it should be carried out without\r\ndelay. The commercial and industrial enterprises of the country\r\ncan only thrive after likin is abolished and only then can new\r\nsources of revenue be obtained. This measure will form the\r\nfundamental factor of our industrial and economical development.\r\nBut one thing to which we should like to call the special\r\nattention of the Government is the procedure to be adopted to\r\nnegotiate with the Foreign countries respecting the adoption of\r\nthis measure. The first step in this connexion should be the\r\nincrease of the present Customs tariff to the actual five per\r\ncent, ad valorem rate. When this is done, proposal should be made\r\nto the Powers having treaty relations with us concerning the\r\nabolition of likin and revision of Customs tariff. The transit\r\ndestination duties on imported goods should at the same time be\r\ndone away with. This would not entail any disadvantage to the\r\nimporters of foreign goods and any diplomatic question would not\r\nbe difficult of solution. Meantime preparatory measures should be\r\ndevised for reorganizing the method of collecting duties set forth\r\nabove so that the abolition of likin can take place as soon as the\r\nGovernment obtains the consent of the foreign Powers respecting\r\nthe increase of Customs tariff.\"\r\n\r\nMEMORANDUM\r\n\r\nTHE LEADING OUTSTANDING CASES BETWEEN CHINA AND THE FOREIGN POWERS\r\n\r\n(Author's note. The following memorandum was drawn up by Dr. C. C.\r\nWu, Councillor at the Chinese Foreign Office and son of Dr. Wu\r\nTing-fang, the Foreign Minister, and is a most competent and\r\nprecise statement. It is a noteworthy fact that not only is Dr. C.\r\nC. Wu a British barrister but he distinguished himself above all\r\nhis fellows in the year he was called to the Bar. It is also\r\nnoteworthy that the Lao Hsi-kai case does not figure in this\r\nsummary, China taking the view that French action throughout was\r\nultra vires, and beyond discussion.)\r\n\r\nBY DR. C. C. WU\r\n\r\nRepublican China inherited from imperial China the vast and rich\r\nterritory of China Proper and its Dependencies, but the\r\ninheritance was by no means free from incumbrances as in the case\r\nof Outer Mongolia, Tibet and Manchuria, and other impediments in\r\nthe form of unfavourable treaty obligations and a long list of\r\noutstanding foreign cases affecting sovereign and territorial\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nI have been asked by the Editor of the North-China Daily News to\r\ncontribute an article on some of the outstanding questions between\r\nChina and foreign powers, instancing Tibet, Manchuria, Mongolia,\r\nand to give the Chinese point of view on these questions. Although\r\nthe subject is a delicate one to handle, particularly in the\r\npress, being as it is one in which international susceptibilities\r\nare apt to be aroused, I have yet accepted the invitation in the\r\nbelief that a calm and temperate statement of the Chinese case\r\nwill hurt no one whose case will bear public discussion but will\r\nperhaps do some good by bringing about a clear understanding of\r\nthe points at issue between China and the foreign Powers\r\nconcerned, and thus facilitating an early settlement which is so\r\nearnestly desired by China. I may say that I have appreciated the\r\nBritish sense of justice and fairplay displayed by the \"North-\r\nChina Daily News\" in inviting a statement of the Chinese case in\r\nits own columns on questions one of which concerns British\r\ninterests in no small degree, and the discussion cannot be\r\nconducted under a better spirit than that expressed in the motto\r\nof the senior British journal in the Far East: \"Impartial not\r\nNeutral.\"\r\n\r\n1 DEGREE MANCHURIA\r\n\r\nThe treaty between China and Japan of 1915 respecting South\r\nManchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia giving that power special\r\nrights and privileges in those regions has given rise to many\r\nknotty problems for the diplomatists of the two countries to\r\nsolve. Two of such problems are mentioned here.\r\n\r\nJAPANESE POLICE BOXES IN MANCHURIA AND MONGOLIA\r\n\r\nSince the last days of the Tsings, the Japanese have been\r\nestablishing police boxes in different parts of South Manchuria\r\nand Eastern Inner Mongolia always under protest of the local and\r\nPeking authorities. Since the treaty of 1915, a new reason has\r\nbecome available in the right of mixed residence given to Japanese\r\nin these regions. It is said that for the protection and control\r\nof their subjects, and indeed for the interest of the Chinese\r\nthemselves, it is best that this measure should be taken. It is\r\nfurther contended that the stationing of police officers is but a\r\ncorollary to the right of exterritoriality, and that it is in no\r\nway a derogation of Chinese sovereignty.\r\n\r\nIt is pointed out by the Chinese Government that in the treaty of\r\n1915, express provision is made for Japanese in South Manchuria\r\nand Eastern Inner Mongolia to submit to the police laws and\r\nordinances and taxation of China (Article 5). This leaves the\r\nmatter in no doubt. If the Japanese wish to facilitate the Chinese\r\npolice in their duty of protection and control of the Japanese,\r\nthey have many means at their command for so doing. It is\r\nunnecessary to point out that the establishment of foreign police\r\non Chinese soil (except in foreign settlements and concessions\r\nwhere it is by the permission of the Chinese Government) is, to\r\nour thinking, at any rate, a very grave derogation to China's\r\nsovereign rights. Furthermore, from actual experience, we know\r\nthat the activities of these foreign police will not be confined\r\nto their countrymen; in a dispute between a Chinese and a Japanese\r\nboth will be taken to the Japanese station by the Japanese\r\npoliceman. This existence of an imperium in imperio, so far from\r\naccomplishing its avowed object of \"improving the relations of the\r\ncountries and bringing about the development of economic interests\r\nto no small degree,\" will, it is feared, be the cause of continual\r\nfriction between the officials and people of the two countries.\r\n\r\nAs to the legal contention that the right of police control is a\r\nnatural corollary to the right of exterritoriality, it must be\r\nsaid that ever since the grant of consular jurisdiction to\r\nforeigners by China in her first treaties, this is the first time\r\nthat such a claim has been seriously put forward. We can only say\r\nthat if this interpretation of exterritoriality is correct the\r\nother nations enjoying exteriorality in China have been very\r\nneglectful in the assertion of their just rights.\r\n\r\nIn the Chengchiatun case, the claim of establishing police boxes\r\nwherever the Japanese think necessary was made one of the demands.\r\nThe Chinese Government in its final reply which settled the case\r\ntook the stand as above outlined.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned in passing that in Amoy the Japanese have also\r\nendeavoured to establish similar police rights. The people of that\r\ncity and province, and indeed of the whole country, as evidenced\r\nby the protests received from all over China, have been very much\r\nexercised over the matter. It is sincerely hoped that with the\r\nundoubted improvement of relations between the two countries\r\nwithin the last several months, the matter will be smoothly and\r\nequitably settled.\r\n\r\nLEGAL STATUS OF KOREANS IN CHIENTAO\r\n\r\nThe region which goes by the name of Chientao, a Japanese\r\ndenomination, comprises several districts in the Yenchi Circuit of\r\nKirin Province north of the Tumen Kiang (or the Tiumen River)\r\nwhich here forms the boundary between China and Korea. For over\r\nthirty years Koreans have been allowed here to cultivate the waste\r\nlands and acquire ownership therein, a privilege which has not\r\nbeen permitted to any other foreigners in China and which has been\r\ngranted to these Koreans on account of the peculiar local\r\nconditions. According to reliable sources, the Korean population\r\nnow amounts to over 200,000 which is more than the Chinese\r\npopulation itself. In 1909 an Agreement, known as the Tumen Kiang\r\nBoundary Agreement, was arrived at between China and Japan, who\r\nwas then the acknowledged suzerain of Korea, dealing, inter alia,\r\nwith the status of these Koreans. It was provided that while\r\nKoreans were to continue to enjoy protection of their landed\r\nproperty, they were to be subject to Chinese laws and to the\r\njurisdiction of Chinese courts. The subsequent annexation of Korea\r\ndid not affect this agreement in point of international law, and\r\nas a matter of practice Japan has adhered to it until September,\r\n1915. Then the Japanese Consul suddenly interfered in the\r\nadministration of justice by the local authorities over the\r\nKoreans and claimed that he should have jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese claim is based on the Treaty Respecting South\r\nManchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia signed in May, 1915, article\r\n5 of which provides that civil and criminal cases in which the\r\ndefendants are Japanese shall be tried and adjudicated by the\r\nJapanese consul.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese view is that this article is inapplicable to Koreans\r\nin this region and that the Tumen Kiang Agreement continues in\r\nforce. This view is based on a saving clause in article 8 of the\r\nTreaty of 1915 which says that \"all existing treaties between\r\nChina and Japan relating to Manchuria shall, except where\r\notherwise provided for by treaty, remain in force.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the origin of the Tumen Kiang Agreement\r\nsupports this view. When the Japanese assumed suzerainty over\r\nKorea they raised certain questions as to the boundary between\r\nChina and Korea. There were also outstanding several questions\r\nregarding railways and mines between China and Japan. Japan\r\ninsisted that the boundary question and the railway and mining\r\nquestions be settled at the same time. As a result, two agreements\r\nwere concluded in 1909 one respecting the boundary question, the\r\nTumen Kiang Agreement, and the other respecting railways and mines\r\nwhereby Japan obtained many new and valuable privileges and\r\nconcessions, such as the extension of the Kirin-Changchun Railway\r\nto the Korean frontier, the option on the Hsinminfu-Fakumen line,\r\nand the working of the Fushun and Yentai mines, while in return\r\nChina obtained a bare recognition of existing rights, namely the\r\nboundary between China and Korea and the jurisdiction over the\r\nKoreans in the Yenchi region. The two settlements were in the\r\nnature of quid pro quo though it is clear that the Japanese side\r\nof the scale heavily outweighed that of the Chinese. Now Japan\r\nendeavours to repudiate, for no apparent reason so far as we can\r\nsee, the agreement which formed the consideration whereby she\r\nobtained so many valuable concessions.\r\n\r\nSecondly, while Koreans are now Japanese subjects, it is contended\r\nby the Chinese that the particular Koreans inhabiting the Yenchi\r\nregion are, as regards China, in a different position from\r\nJapanese subjects elsewhere. These Koreans enjoy the rights of\r\nfree residence and of cultivating and owning land in the interior\r\nof China, rights denied to other foreigners, including Japanese\r\nwho, even by the new treaty, may only lease land in South\r\nManchuria. For this exceptional privilege, they are subject to the\r\njurisdiction of Chinese laws and Chinese courts, a duty not\r\nimposed on other foreigners. It would be \"blowing hot and cold at\r\nthe same time\" in the language of English lawyers if it is sought\r\nto enjoy the special privileges without performing the duties.\r\n\r\nThirdly, Japanese under the Treaty of 1915 are required to\r\nregister their passports with the local authorities. On the other\r\nhand, Koreans in Yenchi have never been nor are they now required\r\nto procure passports. This would seem to be conclusive proof that\r\nKoreans in that region are not within the provisions of the treaty\r\nof 1915 but are still governed by the Tumen Kiang Agreement.\r\n\r\nThe question is something more than one of academic or even merely\r\njudicial importance. As has been stated, the Koreans in Yenchi\r\noutnumber the Chinese and the only thing that has kept the region\r\nChinese territory in fact as well as in name is the possession by\r\nthe Chinese of jurisdiction over every inhabitant, whether Chinese\r\nor Korean. Were China to surrender that jurisdiction over a\r\nmajority of those inhabitants, it would be tantamount to a cession\r\nof territory.\r\n\r\n2 DEGREES MACAO\r\n\r\nThe dispute between China and Portugal over the Macao question has\r\nbeen one of long standing. The first treaty of commerce signed\r\nbetween them on August 13,1862, at Tientsin, was not ratified in\r\nconsequence of a dispute respecting the Sovereignty of Macao. By a\r\nProtocol signed at Lisbon on March 26, 1887, China formally\r\nrecognized the perpetual occupation and government of Macao and\r\nits dependencies by Portugal, as any other Portuguese possession;\r\nand in December of the same year, when the formal treaty was\r\nsigned, provision was made for the appointment of a Commission to\r\ndelimit the boundaries of Macao; \"but as long as the delimitation\r\nof the boundaries is not concluded, everything in respect to them\r\nshall continue as at present without addition, diminution, or\r\nalteration by either of the Parties.\"\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1908, a Japanese steamer, the Tatsu Maru,\r\nengaged in gun-running was captured by a Chinese customs cruiser\r\nnear the Kau-chau archipelago (Nove Ilhas). The Portuguese\r\nauthorities demanded her release on the ground that she was seized\r\nin Portuguese territorial waters thus raising the question of the\r\nstatus of the waters surrounding Macao.\r\n\r\nIn the same year the Portuguese authorities of Macao attempted the\r\nimposition of land tax in Maliaoho, and proposed to dredge the\r\nwaterways in the vicinity of Macao. The Chinese Government\r\nthereupon instructed its Minister in France, who was also\r\naccredited to Portugal, to make personal representations to the\r\nPortuguese Foreign Office in regard to the unwarrantable action of\r\nthe local Portuguese authorities. The Portuguese Government\r\nrequested the withdrawal of Chinese troops on the Island of Lappa\r\nas a quid pro quo for the appointment of a new Demarcation\r\nCommissioner, reserving to itself the right to refer to the Hague\r\nTribunal any dispute that may arise between the Commissioners\r\nappointed by the respective Governments.\r\n\r\nAfter protracted negotiations it was agreed between the Chinese\r\nMinister and the Portuguese Government by an exchange of notes\r\nthat the respective Governments should each appoint a Demarcation\r\nCommissioner to delimit the boundaries of Macao and its\r\ndependencies in pursuance of the Lisbon Protocol and Article 2 of\r\nthe Sino-Portuguese Treaty of 1887, subject to the decision of\r\ntheir respective Governments.\r\n\r\nTHE PORTUGUESE CLAIM\r\n\r\nIn February, 1909, Portugal appointed General Jaoquim Machado and\r\nChina Mr. Kao Erh-chien as their respective Commissioners and they\r\nmet at Hongkong in June of the same year.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese claim consisted of the whole of the Peninsula of\r\nMacao as far north as Portas do Cerco, the Island of Lappa, Green\r\nIsland (Ilha Yerde), Ilhas de Taipa, Ilha de Coloane, Ilha\r\nMacarira, Ilha da Tai-Vong-Cam, other small islands, and the\r\nwaters of Porto Interior. The Portuguese Commissioner also\r\ndemanded that the portion of Chinese territory between Portas do\r\nCerco and Peishanling be neutralized.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of evidence, documentary or otherwise, China could\r\nnot admit Portugal's title to half the territory claimed, but was\r\nprepared to concede all that part of the Peninsula of Macao south\r\nof Portas do Cerco which was already beyond the limits of the\r\noriginal Portuguese Possession of Macao, and also to grant the\r\ndeveloped parts of Ilhas de Coloane as Portuguese settlements. The\r\nownership of territorial waters was to remain vested in China.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations having proved fruitless were transferred to\r\nLisbon but on the outbreak of the Revolution in Portugal they were\r\nsuspended. No material progress has been made since.\r\n\r\n3 DEGREES TIBET\r\n\r\nIn November, 1911, the Chinese garrison in Lhassa, in sympathy\r\nwith the revolutionary cause in China, mutinied against Amban\r\nLien-yu, a Chinese Bannerman, and a few months later the Tibetans,\r\nby order of the Dalai Lama, revolted and besieged the Chinese\r\nforces in Lhassa till they were starved out and eventually\r\nevacuated Tibet. Chinese troops in Kham were also ejected. An\r\nexpedition was sent from Szechuan and Yunnan to Tibet, but Great\r\nBritain protested and caused its withdrawal.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1912, the British Minister in Peking presented a\r\nMemorandum to the Chinese Government outlining the attitude of\r\nGreat Britain towards the Tibetan question. China was asked to\r\nrefrain from dispatching a military expedition into Tibet, as the\r\nre-establishment of Chinese authority would, it is stated,\r\nconstitute a violation of the Anglo-Chinese Treaty of 1906.\r\nChinese suzerainty in regard to Tibet was recognized. But Great\r\nBritain could not consent to the assertion of Chinese sovereignty\r\nover a State enjoying independent treaty relations with her. In\r\nconclusion, China was invited to come to an agreement regarding\r\nTibet on the lines indicated in the Memorandum, such agreement to\r\nbe antecedent to Great Britain's recognition of the Republic.\r\nGreat Britain also imposed an embargo on the communications\r\nbetween China and Tibet via India.\r\n\r\nIn deference to the wishes of the British Government, China at\r\nonce issued orders that the expeditionary force should not proceed\r\nbeyond Giamda. In her reply she declared that the Chinese\r\nGovernment had no intention of converting Tibet into another\r\nprovince of China and that the preservation of the traditional\r\nsystem of Tibetan government was as much the desire of China as of\r\nGreat Britain. The dispatch of troops into Tibet was, however,\r\nnecessary for the fulfilment of the responsibilities attaching to\r\nChina's treaty obligations with Great Britain, which required her\r\nto preserve peace and order throughout that vast territory, but\r\nshe did not contemplate the idea of stationing an unlimited number\r\nof soldiers in Tibet. China considered that the existing treaties\r\ndefined the status of Tibet with sufficient clearness, and\r\ntherefore there was no need to negotiate a new treaty. She\r\nexpressed the regret that the Indian Government had placed an\r\nembargo on the communications between China and Tibet via India,\r\nas China was at peace with Great Britain and regretted that Great\r\nBritain should threaten to withhold recognition of the Republic,\r\nsuch recognition being of mutual advantage to both countries.\r\nFinally, the Chinese Government hoped that the British Government\r\nwould reconsider its attitude.\r\n\r\nTHE SIMLA CONFERENCE\r\n\r\nIn May, 1913, the British Minister renewed his suggestion of the\r\nprevious year that China should come to an agreement on the\r\nTibetan question, and ultimately a Tripartite Conference was\r\nopened on October 13, at Simla with Mr. Ivan Chen, Sir Henry\r\nMcMahon, and Lonchen Shatra as plemipotentiaries representing\r\nChina, Great Britain, and Tibet, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe following is the substance of the Tibetan proposals:--\r\n\r\n1. Tibet shall be an independent State, repudiating the Anglo-\r\nChinese Convention of 1906.\r\n\r\n2. The boundary of Tibet in regard to China includes that portion\r\nof Sinkiang south of Kuenlun Range and Altyn Tagh, the whole\r\nterritory of Chinghai, the western portion of Kansuh and Szechuan,\r\nincluding Tachienlu, and the northwestern portion of Yunnan,\r\nincluding Atuntzu.\r\n\r\n3. Great Britain and Tibet to negotiate, independent of China, new\r\ntrade regulations.\r\n\r\n4. No Chinese officials and troops to be stationed in Tibet.\r\n\r\n5. China to recognize Dalai Lama as the head of the Buddhist\r\nReligion and institutions in Mongolia and China.\r\n\r\n6. China to compensate Tibet for forcible exactions of money or\r\nproperty taken from the Tibetan Government.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Plenipotentiary made the following counter-proposals:--\r\n\r\n1. Tibet forms an integral part of Chinese territory and Chinese\r\nrights of every description which have existed in consequence of\r\nthis integrity shall be respected by Tibet and recognized by Great\r\nBritan. China engages not to convert Tibet into a province and\r\nGreat Britain not to annex Tibet or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n2. China to appoint a Resident at Lhassa with an escort of 3,600\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n3. Tibet undertakes to be guided by China in her foreign and\r\nmilitary affairs and not to enter into negotiations with any\r\nforeign Power except through the intermediary of China but this\r\nengagement does not exclude direct relations between British Trade\r\nAgents and Tibetan authorities as provided in the Anglo-Chinese\r\nConvention of 1906.\r\n\r\n4. Tibet to grant amnesty to those Tibetans known for their pro-\r\nChinese inclinations and to restore to them their property.\r\n\r\n5. Clause 5 of Tibetan claims can be discussed.\r\n\r\n6. Revision of Trade Regulations of 1893 and 1908, if found\r\nnecessary, must be made by all the parties concerned.\r\n\r\n7. In regard to the limits of Tibet China claims Giamda and all\r\nthe places east of it.\r\n\r\nTHE BOUNDARY DEADLOCK\r\n\r\nThe British plenipotentiary sustained in the main the Tibetan view\r\nconcerning the limits of Tibet. He suggested the creation of Inner\r\nand Outer Tibet by a line drawn along the Kuenlun Range to the\r\n9eth longitude, turning south reaching a point south of the 34th\r\nlatitude, then in south-easterly direction to Niarong, passing\r\nHokow, Litang, Batang in a western and then southern and\r\nsouthwestern direction to Rima, thus involving the inclusion of\r\nChiamdo in Outer Tibet and the withdrawal of the Chinese garrison\r\nstationed there. He proposed that recognition should be accorded\r\nto the autonomy of Outer Tibet whilst admitting the right of the\r\nChinese to re-establish such a measure of control in Inner Tibet\r\nas would restore and safeguard their historic position there,\r\nwithout in any way infringing the integrity of Tibet as a\r\ngeographical and political entity. Sir Henry McMahon also\r\nsubmitted to the Conference a draft proposal of the Convention to\r\nthe plenipotentiaries. After some modification this draft was\r\ninitialled by the British and Tibetan delegates but the Chinese\r\ndelegate did not consider himself authorized to do so. Thereupon\r\nthe British member after making slight concessions in regard to\r\nrepresentation in the Chinese Parliament and the boundary in the\r\nneighbourhood of Lake Kokonor threatened, in the event of his\r\npersisting in his refusal, to eliminate the clause recognizing the\r\nsuzerainty of China, and ipso facto the privileges appertaining\r\nthereto from the draft Convention already initialled by the\r\nBritish and Tibetan plenipotentiaries. In order to save the\r\nsituation, the Chinese delegate initialled the documents, but on\r\nthe clear understanding that to initial and to sign were two\r\ndifferent things and that to sign he must obtain instructions from\r\nhis Government.\r\n\r\nChina, dissatisfied with the suggested division into an Inner and\r\nOuter Tibet the boundaries of which would involve the evacuation\r\nof those districts actually in Chinese effective occupation and\r\nunder its administration, though otherwise in accord with the\r\ngeneral principles of the draft Convention, declared that the\r\ninitialled draft was in no way binding upon her and took up the\r\nmatter with the British Government in London and with its\r\nrepresentative in Peking. Protracted negotiations took place\r\nthereafter, but, in spite of repeated concessions from the Chinese\r\nside in regard to the Chinese side in regard to the boundary\r\nquestion, the British Government would not negotiate on any basis\r\nother than the initialled convention. On July 3 an Agreement based\r\non the terms of the draft Convention but providing special\r\nsafeguards for the interests of Great Britain and Tibet in the\r\nevent of China continuing to withhold her adherence, was signed\r\nbetween Great Britain and Tibet, not, however, before Mr. Ivan\r\nChen had declared that the Chinese Government would recognize any\r\ntreaty or similar document that might then or thereafter be signed\r\nbetween Great Britain and Tibet.\r\n\r\nCHINA'S STANDPOINT\r\n\r\nWith the same spirit of compromise and a readiness to meet the\r\nwishes of the British Government and even to the extent of making\r\nconsiderable sacrifices in so far as they were compatible with her\r\ndignity, China has more than once offered to renew negotiations\r\nwith the British Government but the latter has up to the present\r\ndeclined to do so. China wants nothing more than the re-\r\nestablishment of Chinese suzerainty over Tibet, with recognition\r\nof the autonomy of the territory immediately under the control of\r\nthe Lhassa Government; she is agreeable to the British idea of\r\nforming an effective buffer territory in so far as it is\r\nconsistent with equity and justice; she is anxious that her trade\r\ninterest should be looked after by her trade agents as do the\r\nBritish, a point which is agreeable even to the Tibetans though\r\napparently not to the British; in other words, she expects that\r\nGreat Britain would at least make with her an arrangement\r\nregarding Tibet which should not be any less disadvantageous to\r\nher than that made with Russia respecting Outer Mongolia.\r\n\r\nConsidering that China has claimed and exercised sovereign rights\r\nover Tibet, commanded the Tibetan army, supervised Tibetan\r\ninternal administration, and confirmed the appointments of Tibetan\r\nofficials, high and low, secular and even ecclesiastical, such\r\nexpectations are modest enough, surely. At the present moment,\r\nwith communication via India closed, with no official\r\nrepresentative or agent present, with relations unsettled and\r\nunregulated, the position of China vis-a-vis Tibet is far from\r\nsatisfactory and altogether anomalous, while as between China and\r\nGreat Britain there is always this important question outstanding.\r\nAn early settlement in a reciprocal spirit of give and take and\r\ngiving reasonable satisfaction to the legitimate aspirations and\r\nclaims of all parties is extremely desirable.\r\n\r\n4 DEGREES OUTER MONGOLIA\r\n\r\nThe world is more or less acquainted with the events in Urga in\r\nDecember, 1911, and the proclamation of independence of Outer\r\nMongolia with Jetsun Dampa Hutukhtu as its ruler. By the Russo-\r\nChinese Declaration of November 5, 1913, and the Tripartite\r\nConvention of Kiakhta of 1914 China has re-established her\r\nsuzerainty over Outer Mongolia and obtained the acknowledgement\r\nthat it forms a part of the Chinese territory. There remains the\r\ndemarcation of boundary between Inner and Outer Mongolia which\r\nwill take place shortly, and the outstanding question of the\r\nstatus of Tannu Uriankhai where Russia is lately reported to be\r\nsubjecting the inhabitants to Russian jurisdiction and expelling\r\nChinese traders.\r\n\r\nThe Tannu Uriankhai lands, according to the Imperial Institutes of\r\nthe Tsing Dynasty, were under the control of the Tartar General of\r\nUliasutai, the Sain Noin Aimak, the Jasaktu Khan Aimak and the\r\nJetsun Dampa Hutkhta, and divided into forty-eight somons\r\n(tsoling). Geographically, according to the same authority, Tannu\r\nUriankhai is bounded on the north by Russia, east by Tushetu Khan\r\nAimak, west by the various aimks of Kobdo, and south by Jasaktu\r\nKhan Aimak. By a Joint Demarcation Commission in 1868 the Russo\r\nChinese boundary in respect to Uriankhai was denmited and eight\r\nwooden boundary posts were erected to mark their respective\r\nfrontiers.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, however, a Russian officer removed and burnt the boundary\r\npost at Chapuchi Yalodapa. The matter was taken up by the then\r\nWaiwupu with the Russian Minister. He replied to the effect that\r\nthe limits of Uriankhai were an unsettled question and the Russian\r\nGovernment would not entertain the Chinese idea of taking\r\nindependent steps to remark the boundary or to replace the post\r\nand expressed dissatisfaction with the work of the Joint\r\nDemarcation Commission of 1868, a dissatisfaction which would seem\r\nto be somewhat tardily expressed, to say the least. The case was\r\ntemporarily dropped on account of the secession of Uliasutai from\r\nChina in the following year.\r\n\r\nWhile Uriankhai forms part of Autonomous Outer Mongolia, yet since\r\nOuter Mongolia is under China's suzerainty, and its territory is\r\nexpressly recognized to form part of that of China, China cannot\r\nlook on with indifference to any possible cession of territory by\r\nOuter Mongolia to Russia. Article 3 of the Kiakhta Agreement,\r\n1915, prohibiting Outer Mongolia from concluding treaties with\r\nforeign powers respecting political and territorial question\r\nacknowledges China's right to negotiate and make such treaties. It\r\nis the firm intention of the Chinese Government to maintain its\r\nterritorial integrity basing its case on historical records, on\r\ntreaty rights and finally on the principle of nationality. It is\r\nnotorious that the Mongols will be extremely unwilling to see\r\nUriankhai incorporated into the Russian Empire. While Russia is\r\nspending countless lives and incalculable treasure in fighting for\r\nthe sacred principle of nationality in Europe, we cannot believe",
