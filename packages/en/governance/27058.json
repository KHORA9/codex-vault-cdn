Heathen they were in the eyes of the good people of\r\nPlymouth Colony, but nations of heathen, without question, as truly as\r\nwere the Amalekites, the Jebusites, or the Hittites to the infant colony\r\nat Shiloh. It would have been deemed the tallest kind of \"tall talk,\" in\r\nthe councils of Jamestown, Providence, and Annapolis, to express\r\ndisdain for the proffered hand of Indian friendship, or even to object\r\nto payment of some small tribute, in beads or powder, to these native\r\nlords of the continent. In 1637, when Capt. John Mason marched against\r\nSassacus, at the head of ninety men, he had with him half the fighting\r\nforce of the Connecticut Colony. In 1653 a wall was built across\r\nManhattan Island to keep out the savages; though, when we say that the\r\nline of defence just covered the present course of Wall Street (which\r\nderives its name from that circumstance), our readers may not fail to\r\nwonder whether the savages were not the rather kept in by it. In 1675,\r\nwhen the New-England Colonies had grown comparatively strong, they\r\nmustered for their war against Philip one thousand men, of whom\r\nMassachusetts furnished five hundred and twenty-seven, Plymouth one\r\nhundred and fifty-eight, and Connecticut three hundred and fifteen.\r\n\r\nTo men peering out from block-houses, or crouching behind walls,\r\nawaiting the terrific yell of an Indian attack, it was not likely to\r\noccur that they might compromise their dignity by treating on equal\r\nterms with an enemy tenfold as numerous as themselves; nor were the\r\nstatesmen of that early heroic age likely to give themselves trouble\r\nabout the character and standing among the nations of the earth, of\r\nconfederacies that could bring five thousand warriors into the field.\r\nAnd so the feeble colonies struggled on through those days of gloom and\r\nfear, deprecating the anger of the savages as they might, and\r\ncircumventing their wiles when they could; played off one chieftain\r\nagainst another; made contribution of malice and powder to every\r\nintestine feud among the natives; bought off tribes, without much\r\nscruple as to the ultimate fulfilment of their bargains; postponed the\r\nevil day by every expedient, knowing that time was on their side: and\r\nwhen they had, in spite of all, to fight, fought as men who know that\r\nthey will not themselves be spared,--planned ambuscades and massacres;\r\nfired Indian camps, and shot the inmates as they leaped from their\r\nblazing wigwams; studied and mastered all the arts of forest warfare;\r\nand beat the savages with their own weapons, as men of the higher race\r\nwill always do when forced by circumstances to such a contest.\r\n\r\nNor during the early part of the eighteenth century, when all danger of\r\na war of extermination had passed from the apprehension of the most\r\ntimid, when the Colonies had become in a degree compacted, and the line\r\nof white occupation had been made continuous from Massachusetts to\r\nGeorgia; nor later still, when the Colonies had become States, and the\r\nrepresentatives of the new nation of the Western world were received in\r\nall the courts of Europe--was the policy abandoned of treating with the\r\nIndian tribes as parties having equal powers of initiative, and equal\r\nrights in negotiation. In nearly four hundred treaties, confirmed by the\r\nSenate as are treaties with foreign powers, our government recognized\r\nIndian tribes as nations with whom the United States might contract\r\nwithout derogating from its sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe treaties made with Indian tribes have, of course, been mainly\r\ntreaties of cession. Most of our readers will be surprised to learn the\r\nextent of lands east of the Mississippi which are embraced in sales to\r\nthe United States; being no less than the entire States of Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Illinois, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi, with\r\nconsiderable portions of Tennessee, Michigan, and Wisconsin. And these\r\ntreaties were not a mere form to amuse and quiet savages, a\r\nhalf-compassionate, half-contemptuous humoring of unruly children. The\r\nUnited States were not then grown so great that they could afford to\r\nvalue lightly the free relinquishment of the soil by the native owners\r\nof it. At the time most of the treaties with tribes east of the\r\nMississippi were concluded, not only did the right remain in the\r\nIndians, but enough of power, to make it as much a diplomatic triumph to\r\nobtain a cession on favorable terms, as it would be to negotiate a\r\nsuccessful treaty with one of the States of Central America to-day. The\r\nUnited States were clearly the stronger party in every such case; but\r\nthe Indians were, in the great body of instances, still so formidable,\r\nthat to wrest their lands from them by pure, brutal violence would have\r\nrequired an exertion of strength which the government was ill prepared\r\nto make. So that, while it is true that the Indians were generally made\r\nready to negotiate by the use of military force and by the pressure of\r\nwhite settlements, it is not true that the considerations and privileges\r\naccorded them in these treaties were a gift out of good-nature.\r\n\r\nSo much for the power of the Indians when they made these treaties.\r\nTheir right to their lands is quite as well established historically. In\r\nthe early history of the Western world, the principle was fully\r\nrecognized, that, while sovereignty rested, not with the Indians, but\r\nwith the civilized power claiming by virtue of discovery, the Indians\r\nwere the rightful occupants, with a just and perfect claim to retain\r\npossession and enjoy the use until they should be disposed voluntarily\r\nto part with it. Great Britain, Holland, France, and Spain, the four\r\npowers claiming sovereignty by virtue of discovery within the present\r\nterritory of the United States, conceded no less than this to the\r\nnatives; while France, in the cession of the province of Louisiana,\r\nexpressly reserved the rights allowed the Indians by its own treaties\r\nand articles, \"until, by mutual consent of the United States and the\r\nsaid tribes or nations, other suitable articles shall have been agreed\r\nupon.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Such being the right of the Indians to the soil, the United\r\n     States for more than eighty-five years pursued a uniform\r\n     course of extinguishing the Indian title only with the consent\r\n     of those Indian tribes which were recognized as having claim\r\n     by reason of occupancy: such consent being expressed in\r\n     treaties, to the formation of which both parties approached,\r\n     as having equal rights of initiative, and equal rights in\r\n     negotiation. These treaties were made from time to time (not\r\n     less than 372 being embraced in the general statutes of the\r\n     United States) as the pressure of white settlements, or the\r\n     fear or the experience of Indian hostilities, made the demand\r\n     for the removal of one tribe after another urgent or\r\n     imperative. _Except only in the case of the Indians in\r\n     Minnesota, after the outbreak of 1862, the United-States\r\n     Government has never extinguished an Indian title as by right\r\n     of conquest_; and in this latter case the government provided\r\n     the Indians another reservation, besides giving them the\r\n     proceeds of the sales of the lands vacated by them in\r\n     Minnesota; so scrupulously, up to that time, had the right of\r\n     the Indians to the soil been respected, at least in form. It\r\n     is not to be denied that wrong was often done in fact to\r\n     tribes in the negotiation of treaties of cession. The Indians\r\n     were not infrequently overborne or deceived by the agents of\r\n     the government in these transactions; sometimes\r\n     unquestionably, powerful tribes were permitted to cede lands\r\n     to which weaker tribes had a better claim: but, formally at\r\n     least, the United States accepted the cession successively of\r\n     all lands, to which Indian tribes could show color of title,\r\n     which are embraced in the limits of any of the present States\r\n     of the Union except California and Nevada.\"--_Report on Indian\r\n     Affairs_, 1872, pp. 83, 84.\r\n\r\nIn 1871, however, the insolence of conscious strength, and the growing\r\njealousy of the House of Representatives towards the prerogative--arrogated\r\nby the Senate--of determining, in connection with the executive, all\r\nquestions of Indian right and title, and of committing the United States\r\nincidentally to pecuniary obligations limited only by its own discretion,\r\nfor which the House should be bound to make provision without inquiry, led\r\nto the adoption, after several severe parliamentary struggles, of the\r\ndeclaration which stands at the head of this paper.\r\n\r\nIn abruptly terminating thus the long series of Indian treaties, and\r\nforever closing the only course of procedure known for the adjustment of\r\ndifficulties, and even for the administration of ordinary business, with\r\nIndian tribes, Congress provided no substitute, and up to the present\r\ntime has neglected to prescribe the methods by which, after the\r\nabrogation of the national character of the Indians, either their\r\ninternal matters or their relations with the general government are to\r\nbe regulated. The Indian-Intercourse Act of 1834, though still nominally\r\nin force, is so largely predicated upon the tribal constitution, and\r\nassumes so uniformly the national sufficiency of the tribe, that all the\r\nlife and virtue are taken out of it by the Act of 1871 just cited; and\r\nthe country is, in effect, left without rule or prescription for the\r\ngovernment of Indian affairs. It is sufferance, not law, which enables\r\nthe Indian Office to-day to administer its charge. While the Act of 1871\r\nstrikes down at a blow the hereditary authority of the chiefs, no\r\nlegislation has invested Indian agents with magisterial powers, or\r\nprovided for the assembling of the Indian _demos_. There is at this time\r\nno semblance of authority for the punishment of any crime which one\r\nIndian may commit against another, nor any mode of procedure, recognized\r\nby treaty or statute, for the regulation of matters between the\r\ngovernment and the several tribes. So far as the law is concerned,\r\ncomplete anarchy exists in Indian affairs; and nothing but the singular\r\nhomogeneity of Indian communities, and the almost unaccountable\r\nspontaneity and unanimity of public sentiment within them, has thus far\r\nprevented the attention of Congress and the country being called most\r\npainfully to the unpardonable negligence of the national legislature in\r\nfailing to provide a substitute for the time-honored policy which was\r\ndestroyed by the Act of 1871.\r\n\r\nIn treating the Indian question of the present day, the temptation is\r\nstrongly felt, to dwell upon the history of Indian tribes, and upon the\r\nphysical and moral characteristics of this singular race. Yet, if way be\r\nonce given to this inclination, not only will the time and space\r\nnecessary for a discussion of the present and the future of the Indian\r\ntribes be sacrificed, but the attention of the reader will be so\r\noverwhelmed with the multitude of names and incidents, that he will be\r\nembarrassed rather than assisted in his understanding of the subject to\r\nbe treated. The value, for our purpose, of facts and incidents in Indian\r\nhistory is not at all according to their value historically or\r\nromantically. Indeed, such has been the fatality to the aborigines of\r\ncontact with the whites, that it may almost be said, the importance\r\nto-day of tribes is inversely as their importance in the annals of the\r\ncountry. Among the greatest figures of the past are those of bands and\r\nconfederacies that have utterly disappeared from the continent, happy\r\nthat their long, savage independence, and their brief, fierce resistance\r\nto the encroachments of the pale-face, were not to be succeeded by a\r\ndreary period of submission, humiliation, and dependence. Other tribes,\r\nthat but a few generations ago shook the infant colonies with terror, or\r\neven dared to stand across the path of the Republic, and for a time\r\nflung a shadow as of eclipse over its destiny, are now represented upon\r\nthe annuity or feeding-lists of the United States by a few score of\r\ndiseased wretches, who hang about the settlements, begging and stealing\r\nwhere they can, and quarrelling like dogs over the entrails of the\r\nbeeves that are slaughtered for them. Still other tribes, once warlike\r\nand powerful, have, by a fortunate turn of character and circumstance,\r\nbecome so rich and respectable as not only to deprive them of all\r\nromantic interest, but practically to take them out of the scope of the\r\nIndian question. Other tribes, still having among them men whose\r\ngrandfathers besieged Detroit under Pontiac, are now resolved into\r\ncitizens of the United States, eligible for the chief-justiceship or the\r\npresidency.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations as we have here briefly sketched suffice to show the\r\ninexpediency of entering upon Indian history, _qua_ history, as an\r\nintroduction to the discussion of the Indian problems of to-day. Equally\r\nobdurate must one be to the seductions of Indian ethnology, except so\r\nfar only as it may simplify the classification of the present Indian\r\npopulation to refer tribes and bands to recognized groups or families,\r\nfor the better or briefer characterization of their qualities and\r\naffinities.\r\n\r\nEven stronger yet is the temptation to enter upon the analysis and\r\nportraiture of the original and native character of the North-American\r\nIndian. Voluptuary and stoic; swept by gusts of fury too terrible to be\r\nwitnessed, yet imperturbable beyond all men, under the ordinary\r\nexcitements and accidents of life; garrulous, yet impenetrable; curious,\r\nyet himself reserved, proud and mean alike beyond compare; superior to\r\ntorture and the presence of certain death, yet, by the standards of all\r\nother peoples, a coward in battle; capable of magnanimous actions which,\r\nwhen uncovered of all romance, are worthy of the best days of Roman\r\nvirtue, yet more cunning, false, and cruel than the Bengalee,--this\r\ncopper-colored sphinx, this riddle unread of men, equally fascinates and\r\nfoils the inquirer.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is the Indian of history. The Indian for whom the\r\ngovernment is called to provide subsistence and instruction presents no\r\nsuch psychological difficulties. Curious compound and strange\r\nself-contradiction as the red man is in his native character, in his\r\ntraditional pursuits, and amid the surroundings of his own wild life;\r\nyet when broken down by the military power of the whites, thrown out of\r\nhis familiar relations, his stupendous conceit with its glamour of\r\nsavage pomp and glory rudely dispelled, his occupation gone, himself a\r\nbeggar, the red man becomes the most commonplace person imaginable, of\r\nvery simple nature, limited aspirations, and enormous appetites.\r\n\r\nThe Indian question naturally divides itself into two: What shall be\r\ndone with the Indian as an obstacle to the national progress? What shall\r\nbe done with him when, and so far as, he ceases to oppose or obstruct\r\nthe extension of railways and settlements? It is because these two parts\r\nof the question have not been separately regarded that so much confusion\r\nhas been introduced into the discussion of Indian affairs. Widely\r\ndiverse, for example, as are the criticisms popularly expressed on what\r\nis known as the \"Indian policy\" of Pres. Grant's administration, the\r\nwriter can confidently affirm, as the result of hundreds of interviews,\r\nformal and informal, stated and casual, friendly and the reverse, with\r\nmen from every section of the country, of both parties, and of all\r\nprofessions, that he believes there is no political subject mooted\r\nto-day on which there are so slight differences of real opinion, or,\r\nindeed, such general consent when men will once come to terms with each\r\nother, and begin to talk about the same thing. He has never known a man,\r\neven from the Territories or the border States, make objection, on a\r\ncandid statement, to the intentions and purposes of that administration\r\ntowards the Indians, unless it were some man peculiarly vulgar and\r\nbrutal,--such a one, for instance, as, if a Southerner, would give his\r\ntime and breath to indiscriminate abuse of the negroes. Instead of there\r\nbeing two parties on this subject, there is, therefore, if the\r\nobservations of the writer have been well made, no reason to suppose\r\nthat any considerable division of opinion or feeling exists respecting\r\nthe duty of the government, at the present moment, by the aborigines of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nTake the public sentiment of Arizona, for example. It is the almost\r\nuniversal belief throughout the country, that the people of this\r\nTerritory have a deadly hostility to the Indians, and meditate nothing\r\nbut mischief towards them; and it certainly must be admitted that press\r\nand people alike indulge in expressions which fairly bear that\r\nconstruction, and are quite enough to create an impression that the\r\ncitizens of the Territory hate an Indian as an Indian, and have no\r\nhumane sentiments whatever towards the race. And yet the writer would as\r\nsoon leave the question, whether the government should render some\r\nkindly service to the Papagoes or to the Pimas and Maricopas, in the way\r\nof assisting them to self-maintenance, or of providing instruction in\r\nletters or in the mechanic arts, to the general voice of the people of\r\nArizona, as to any missionary association in New York or Boston the\r\ncoming May. When the press of Arizona cry out against the Indian policy\r\nof the government, and denounce Eastern philanthropy, they have in mind\r\nthe warlike and depredating bands; and they are exasperated by what they\r\ndeem, perhaps unreasonably but not unnaturally, the weakness and\r\nindecision of the executive in failing to properly protect the frontier.\r\nIndians to them mean Apaches; and their violence on the Indian question\r\narises from the belief that the administration of Indian affairs has\r\nbeen committed to sentimentalists, who have no appreciation of the\r\nterrible stress which these Indian outrages bring upon the remote\r\nsettlements. But were the question one of helping, in a practical\r\nfashion suited to the habits and views of life of a border community, a\r\ntribe of Indians who are peaceful, and in a poor way helpful, there is\r\nno reason to suppose that the inhabitants of Tucson or Prescott would be\r\nbehind an Eastern congregation in readiness for the work. And this\r\nimpression the writer derives, not alone from the amiable and cultivated\r\ngentleman who represents that Territory in Congress, but from contact\r\nand correspondence with many influential and representative citizens of\r\nArizona, and from a study of the very journals that so teem with\r\ndenunciations of the Indian policy of the government.[B]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in our prosperous and well-ordered communities at the\r\nEast, a gentleman of leisure and of native benevolence, whose ears have\r\nnever rung with the war-whoop, whose eyes have never witnessed the\r\nhorrid atrocities of Indian warfare, and who is only disturbed in his\r\npleasing reveries by the occasional tramp of the policeman about his\r\nhouse, is apt to dwell exclusively upon the other side of the Indian\r\nquestion. To such a man, as he recalls the undoubted wrongs done the\r\nIndian in the past, as he contemplates the fate of a race whose heroic\r\nand romantic qualities have been greatly exaggerated, or as he listens\r\nto the flattering tale of a missionary returned from some peaceful and\r\nhalf-civilized tribe, it is very pleasant to think that the original\r\nowners of the soil are to be protected by the government, saved to\r\nhumanity, educated in the useful arts, and elevated to a Christian\r\ncivilization. On such a man accounts of Indian outrages make little\r\nimpression. He regards them as the invention of pioneer malice, or\r\neasily disposes of them by a mental reference to the crimes perpetrated\r\nin his own town or city. He is, perhaps, so ignorant of Indian matters\r\nas to think that all the Indians of the country form one homogeneous\r\ncommunity, and cannot understand how it should be, that, while Cherokees\r\nare supporting churches and colleges and orphan asylums at home, and\r\nsending their sons to receive classical and professional education in\r\nthe best schools of the East, Kiowas should roast their prisoners alive,\r\nand brain the babe before the eyes of its mother. Is it a matter of\r\nwonder, that men who are contemplating things so different as are the\r\nEastern philanthropist and the Western settler, when Indians are spoken\r\nof, should imagine that they disagree as to the policy of the\r\ngovernment, and come to entertain contempt or repugnance for each other,\r\nwhile, in fact, on an honest statement of a given case, neither would\r\ndissent in the slightest degree from the views of the other? If there\r\nis, then, such a liability to confusion and misapprehension in the\r\ndiscussion of the Indian question, we may be allowed to insist strongly\r\nupon the necessity of the distinction indicated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe actually or potentially hostile tribes of the United States number,\r\non a rough computation suited to the rudeness of the definition,\r\nsixty-four thousand. It is these only which we have to treat under the\r\nfirst division of our question,--What shall be done with the Indian as\r\nan obstacle to the national progress? This number of sixty-four thousand\r\nis made up as follows: The actually depredating bands, North-west and\r\nSouth-west, probably have not exceeded, during the past year, seven\r\nthousand, mainly Kiowas, Comanches, and Apaches. The tribes with which\r\nthese bands are directly and intimately connected contain about twenty\r\nthousand, including the marauders. There are further included in this\r\ncalculation tribes and bands, numbering in the aggregate about\r\nforty-four thousand, which are now generally at peace.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the number which we have taken for the potentially\r\nhostile Indians is many times greater than the number of the actually\r\nhostile. Yet, on the other hand, we have not intended to embrace all\r\nthose tribes which might be exasperated to the point of resistance by a\r\nreckless disregard of treaties on the part of the government, or by a\r\nseries of wanton acts of abuse on the part of white settlers. There is a\r\nline beyond which no man or people may safely be pressed; and there are\r\nfew bands of Indians, East or West, however contemptible in numbers or\r\ncharacter, which, if wronged and trampled on, might not in their\r\nindignant despair teach their oppressors a lesson at which the world\r\nwould shudder. We are contemplating no such possibilities. We are\r\nassuming that the government will, as it has generally done in the\r\npast, respect treaty obligations, and that the intercourse of the\r\nIndians with their white neighbors will be marked by only such sporadic\r\nacts of individual wrong as are in the nature of the case.\r\n\r\nThe tribes to which we refer as potentially hostile are, first, those\r\nnow in immediate contact with the whites, whose claims to territory are\r\nso far disregarded, either by the action of the government or by the\r\nunauthorized intrusion of pioneers and prospectors; or whose means of\r\nsubsistence are so far impaired or threatened by the extension of\r\nrailways and settlements,--that hostilities are only prevented by the\r\nbounty of the government in feeding the members of such tribes in whole\r\nor in part, by liberal presents of trinkets and useful goods, by the\r\nexercise of especial watchfulness in avoiding occasions of dispute and\r\npoints of collision, and finally by a willingness on the part of the\r\ngovernment to overlook offences and even to tolerate a degree of\r\ninsolence, rather than allow a breach of the peace: second, those tribes\r\nnot now to any great extent in contact with the whites, and exhibiting\r\nno desire to go out of their way to make trouble, but of which the same\r\nmust, in the inevitable course of the national progress, in a few years\r\nbecome true as of the tribes embraced under the first class.\r\n\r\nBut these classes, as we have thus described them, are yet far too\r\nnumerous for the facts of the case. We must still further reduce them by\r\nexcluding all such tribes as, from location, from traditional friendship\r\nfor the whites, or from weakness of character, are unlikely, in any\r\nevent reasonably to be contemplated, to become involved in hostilities.\r\n\r\nAmong the Indians, who, by the force of their location and surroundings,\r\nare rendered powerless for armed resistance, are not a few of the\r\nIndians of Minnesota, and even some in Wisconsin, who have no love for\r\nthe whites, and would make exceedingly bad neighbors to frontier\r\nsettlements, but who, encircled as they are by powerful communities,\r\nsubmit sullenly to their condition. The same may be said of many bands\r\nin Kansas, Nebraska, and on the Pacific coast. These are Indians who\r\nhave been overtaken, surrounded, and disarmed by the progress of\r\npopulation, but, either through the neglect of the government or by the\r\nfailure of the usual agencies of instruction and industrial assistance,\r\nhave remained barbarous, and, as their natural means of subsistence grow\r\nscantier, are becoming every year more miserable.\r\n\r\nThere is another and much larger class of Indians from whom no organized\r\nviolence is to be expected in the course of the complete settlement of\r\nthe country, not because they are rendered helpless by the force of\r\ntheir location, nor because they have any traditional friendship for the\r\nwhites, nor because they do not experience suffering enough to impel a\r\nwarlike people to a struggle for life, but because they are not fighting\r\nIndians. Actual outrage might drive some of these tribes to resistance;\r\nbut, under the slow wasting-away of their means of subsistence, and the\r\ngradual pressure of the settlements, they are, and are likely to remain,\r\nwholly passive, accepting their fate, and sinking to the lowest point of\r\nhuman misery without a single heroic effort. Some of these tribes have\r\nbeen \"put upon\" by their more warlike neighbors through many\r\ngenerations, driven from their original hunting-grounds, and harassed\r\neven in the mountains where they have taken refuge, until their spirit\r\nhas been utterly crushed, and they have become as submissive as the\r\nSouthern negroes. This is true of large numbers of the Indians of\r\nColorado, Utah, Nevada, and Southern California. They have neither the\r\nindividual courage nor the instinct of confederation entitling them to\r\nbe reckoned among the potentially hostile tribes.\r\n\r\nStill, again, we count out several powerful tribes, able to bring five\r\nhundred or a thousand warriors each into the field, which, by reason of\r\ntraditional friendship and their frequent alliance with our troops in\r\ncampaigns against hostile Indians, are sure to remain the friends of the\r\ngovernment under any tolerable treatment. Indeed, neglect and abuse seem\r\ninsufficient to alienate these allies. Their faith once pledged, and\r\nfriendship cemented by sacrifices and sufferings, they cling to the\r\nfortunes of the whites with romantic fidelity. Such are the\r\nArickarees,[C] Mandans, and Gros Ventres of the Upper Missouri; such\r\nthe Pawnees of Kansas; such the Flatheads, Kootenays, and Pend\r\nd'Oreilles, whose boast is that their tribes never killed a white man;\r\nsuch, in a degree, the Crows of Montana. These tribes, and others of\r\nless consequence, are not only sure, in the event of kindly treatment by\r\nthe government, to remain its fast friends, but they may be relied upon\r\nin the future, as in the past, to do much to check the audacity of their\r\nhostile neighbors, and, in the last resort, to furnish re-enforcements\r\nof the most effective and economical sort to the troops operating\r\nagainst predatory bands.\r\n\r\nHaving excluded all tribes and bands of the character, or in the\r\nposition, indicated under the three heads above, we make up the list of\r\nthe potentially hostile Indians somewhat as follows: of the Sioux of\r\nDakota,--tribes, bands, and parties, to the number of fifteen thousand;\r\nof the Indians of Montana,--Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans, Assiniboines\r\nand roving Sioux, to the number of twenty thousand; of the Indians in\r\nthe extreme south-western part of the Indian Territory and on the\r\nborders of Texas,--Kiowas, Comanches, Cheyennes, and Arapahoes, to the\r\nnumber of seven thousand; of the Indians of Arizona,--Apaches of several\r\ntribes, to the number of nine thousand; of the mountain Indians of\r\nColorado, Utah, and Nevada, to the number of five thousand; of the\r\nIndians of New Mexico, to the number of two thousand; and of the Indians\r\nin Oregon and Washington Territory, to the number of six thousand. The\r\nsixty-four thousand Indians thus enumerated comprise substantially all\r\nthe tribes and bands with which the government is obliged to contemplate\r\nthe possibility of war. It is in the highest degree improbable, however,\r\nthat the United States would, even in the event of what might properly\r\nbe called a general Indian war, be called on to fight more than one-half\r\nof these Indians at any one time; while, with a reasonable policy of\r\nconcession, the number of actually hostile and depredating bands may be\r\nsteadily reduced, and the whole body of dangerous Indians held in check\r\nuntil the advance of population shall render them incapable of mischief.\r\nThe measures by which this is to be effected must be considered\r\ncandidly, in the light of the alternative presented, and not as if they\r\nwere proposed as measures wholly agreeable to the tastes or the temper\r\nof those who are called to administer Indian affairs.\r\n\r\nThat we may obtain a true impression of one of the conditions on which\r\npeace is maintained with certain Indian tribes, let us take a leaf out\r\nof the official record of the dealings of the government with the Sioux\r\nduring the past year. Early in 1872 an unusually large number of Indians\r\nwere assembled at the Red Cloud agency, near Fort Laramie in Wyoming. By\r\nfar the greater part were _habitues_ of this or some other Sioux agency;\r\nbut among them were many Northern Indians, who were for the first time\r\nthe guests of the government, and who, not having become accustomed to\r\neat the bread of dependence, were much more intractable and insolent\r\nthan the others. The presence of these Indians produced great turmoil at\r\nthe agency, and considerable apprehension on the part of the agent.\r\nNothing in the nature of an outbreak occurred, however: the strangers\r\ngradually went away to their summer hunt on the Powder River; and the\r\nagency was brought back to its usual condition. But, while this was\r\nbeing effected, a ranchman named Powell, who had a large drove of cattle\r\nnear Fort Laramie, was robbed and murdered. The bloody details were soon\r\nknown; for Indians are such inveterate gossips that they can keep no\r\nsecret, however dangerous disclosure may be to them. The murderers were\r\nNorthern Indians, who had instantly left for their own country. At two\r\nsuccessive councils, both the civil and the military authorities\r\ndemanded the surrender of the guilty parties and the return of the\r\nstolen stock. The chiefs present and the great body of their followers\r\nmost unmistakably disapproved and regretted the act, if for no better\r\nreason than because they apprehended the consequences; but they\r\ndisclaimed any responsibility therefor,--the murderers not being of\r\ntheir own proper number,--pleaded their inability to arrest the\r\nfugitives with their bloody spoils, and, for the rest, did nothing. The\r\ngovernment, for that matter, after much expostulation, did the same:\r\ntroops were not marched northward to seize the murderers; the rations of\r\nthe Sioux were not ordered to be stopped until satisfaction had been\r\ngiven; and the murder of Powell remains to-day unpunished by the\r\ngovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\nA second condition on which peace is maintained is the subsistence of\r\ncertain tribes at the expense of the government, without reference to\r\ntheir ability or disposition to work. Every five or seven days, twenty\r\nthousand Sioux, big and little, assemble around the agencies for the\r\ndistribution of food. Soldiers' rations are dealt out: flour by the\r\nhundred sacks is delivered to them; beeves by the score are turned loose\r\nto be shot down and eaten up in savage fashion. The expense of this\r\nservice is a million five hundred thousand dollars a year,--one-seventh\r\nthe total cost of poor-support in the United States. About one million\r\nmore is expended for the total or partial subsistence of other tribes,\r\nespecially in the South-west. Coincidently with this, occasions for\r\nincreased expenditure have arisen in connection with tribes not upon\r\nthe feeding-list; so that the average cost of the Indian service has\r\ngone up from four millions in 1866, 1867, and 1868, to seven millions at\r\nthe present time. It should be remarked, however, that it is only the\r\nincrease which measures the cost of the \"peace policy,\" so called, more\r\nthan one-half of the four millions of expenditure in the former period\r\nbeing the lawful due of the Indians under treaty stipulations, in\r\nconsideration for the cession of lands; and the remainder covering the\r\ngeneral expenses of the service. The following table exhibits the\r\nexpenditures of the government on account of the Indian service for the\r\ntwelve years 1861 to 1872:--\r\n\r\n  Year.  Expenditures on Indian Account.\r\n\r\n  1861   $2,865,481.17\r\n  1862    2,327,948.37\r\n  1863    3,152,032.70\r\n  1864    2,629,975.97\r\n  1865    5,059,360.71\r\n  1866    3,295,729.32\r\n  1867    4,642,531.77\r\n  1868    4,100,682.32\r\n  1869    7,042,923.06\r\n  1870    3,407,938.15\r\n  1871    7,426,997.44\r\n  1872    7,061,728.82\r\n\r\nNow, it must honestly be confessed, that the United-States Government,\r\nin such dealings with Indian tribes as have been recited, does not act a\r\nvery handsome part. To pay blackmail to insolent savages (for that is\r\nsimply what it amounts to); to feed forty or fifty thousand people who\r\nmake no pretence of doing any thing for themselves, and who appear to\r\nthink that they are conferring a distinguishing honor upon the\r\ngovernment by accepting its bounty; to allow the murder of an American\r\ncitizen, of whatever character or degree, to go unpunished,--these are\r\nnot things pleasant to contemplate. It may be a duty to administer\r\nIndian affairs in this way; but it must be a duty far more disagreeable\r\nto any man of spirit than would be a call to take part in the punishment\r\nof the savages, at no more than the personal risk usually incident to a\r\ncampaign. And yet, in the face of all this, we do not hesitate to say\r\nthat the general course of the government in such dealings as have been\r\ndescribed above is expedient and humane, just and honorable. This is a\r\nproposition, which, in the view of such admissions as have been made,\r\nmay seem to impose a formidable burden of proof; yet is it not only\r\nconsistent with the highest reason of the case, but susceptible of very\r\nsimple and direct demonstration.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it should be remarked that there can be no question\r\nof national dignity involved in the treatment of savages by a civilized\r\npower. The proudest Anglo-Saxon will climb a tree with a bear behind\r\nhim, and deem not his honor, but his safety, compromised by the\r\nsituation. With wild men, as with wild beasts, the question whether to\r\nfight, coax, or run, is a question merely of what is easiest or safest\r\nin the situation given. Points of dignity only arise between those who\r\nare, or assume to be, equals. Indeed, nothing is at times so\r\ncontemptuous as compliance. It indicates not merely a consciousness of\r\nstrength, but of strength so superior as to decline comparison or\r\ncontest.\r\n\r\nGrant that some petty Sioux chief believes that the government of the\r\nUnited States feeds him and his lazy followers out of fear, or out of\r\nrespect for his greatness: what then? It will not be long before the\r\nagent of the government will be pointing out the particular row of\r\npotatoes which his majesty must hoe before his majesty can dine. The\r\npeople of the United States surely are great enough, and sufficiently\r\nconscious of their greatness, to indulge a little longer the\r\nself-complacent fancies of those savage tribes, if by that means a\r\ndesolating war may be avoided.\r\n\r\nAnd in this we shall only do what other nations have done, and esteemed\r\nthemselves wise in doing. The Greeks and Romans, except in periods of\r\nambitious frenzy, recognized the fruitlessness and folly of fighting\r\nabsolute savages, and did not scruple, in the height of their conquering\r\npride, to keep the peace with Scythians and Parthians as best they\r\ncould. The English, the Dutch, the Spanish, the Portuguese, in their\r\nAmerican colonies, only fought the natives when for their purposes they\r\nmust, preserving the peace when they could by presents, and even by\r\ntribute. Statesmen who would have embroiled Europe on a question of\r\ndinner-etiquette have fully recognized the principle that there could be\r\nno issue of dignity between a civilized power and a band of\r\nirresponsible savages, and have submitted, without any feeling of\r\ndegradation, to demands the most unreasonable, urged in terms the most\r\ninsolent.\r\n\r\nNor is there any savor of treachery in the government thus biding its\r\ntime. In this the government simply, from a wise consideration of the\r\nexposed situation of the settlements, refrains from the full exercise of\r\nthe authority which it claims. It in no wise deceives the Indians, but\r\nonly indulges their illusion till the time comes when the illusion must\r\nbe broken. It watches the troubled sleep of the maniac, ready to\r\nrestrain his violence if he wakes, yet mercifully willing that he should\r\nremain unconscious. And this forbearance of the government is not less\r\nkind to the aborigines than to those of our citizens who are building\r\ntheir homes within reach of the red man's hand. If the savages--Sioux,\r\nKiowas, Cheyennes, Comanches, whom the United States are thus playing\r\nwith--realized in any adequate measure what the next few years have in\r\nstore for them, how completely they will be surrounded and disarmed, how\r\ncertainly they will be forced to labor like squaws for their bread, how\r\nstringently the government will enforce its requirements when their\r\npower of resistance shall have departed; it is inconceivable but that,\r\nin their present temper, ignorant as they are of the real resources of\r\nthe whites, and conscious that they can still bring eight thousand\r\nwarriors into the field, they would precipitate a contest which, though\r\nit would involve untold misery to our border population, must inevitably\r\nend in their own destruction.\r\n\r\nIf, then, there is nothing inconsistent with national dignity or honor\r\nin thus temporizing with hostile savages, it certainly can be shown to\r\nbe in a high degree compatible with the interests and the welfare of all\r\nthe white communities which are, by their advanced position, placed at\r\nthe mercy of the Indians. Thousands and even tens of thousands of our\r\ncitizens are now living within reach of the first murderous outbreak of\r\na general Indian war. Since 1868, when the trans-continental railroad\r\nwas completed, population has found its way into regions to which the\r\nrate of progress previously maintained would not in fifty years have\r\ncarried it,--into nooks and corners which five years ago were scarcely\r\nknown to trappers and guides. Instead of exposing to Indian contact, as\r\nheretofore, a clearly defined frontier line, upon two or three faces,\r\nour settlements have penetrated the Western country in every direction\r\nand from every direction, creeping along the course of every stream,\r\nseeking out every habitable valley, following up every indication of\r\ngold among the ravines and mountains, clinging around the reservations\r\nof the most formidable tribes, and even making lodgement at a hundred\r\npoints on lands secured by treaty to the Indians. Even where the limit\r\nof settlement in any direction has apparently, for the time, been\r\nreached, we learn of some solitary ranchman or miner who has made his\r\nhome still farther down the valley or up the mountain, far beyond sight\r\nor call.\r\n\r\nIt is upon men thus exposed, without hope of escape or chance of\r\nresistance, that the first wrath of a general Indian war would break. No\r\nnote of recall would avert their doom. Long before friendly runners\r\ncould reach them, the war-whoop would be in their ears; and alone,\r\nunfriended, undefended, unaided, they would perish, as hundreds and\r\nthousands of our countrymen have perished, at the hands of the\r\ninfuriated savages. But it is not alone the solitary ranchmen who would\r\nbe swept away on the first onset of Indian attack. Scores of valleys up\r\nwhich population has been steadily creeping would be instantly\r\nabandoned; streams that now, from source to mouth, resound the stroke of\r\nthe pioneer's axe, would be left desolate on the first rumor of war; a\r\nhundred outlying settlements would disappear in a night, as the tidings\r\nof outbreak and massacre were borne along by hurrying fugitives. As the\r\nblood retreats, on the signal of danger, from the extremities to the\r\nheart, so would population retire, terror-struck and precipitate, from\r\nthe frontier on the first shock of war. Towns, even, would be\r\nabandoned; and the frightened inhabitants, men, women, and children,\r\ncumbered with household stuff and overdriven stock, would crowd within\r\nthe shelter of garrisons hardly adequate for their defence.\r\n\r\nThere could be but one plea on which such considerations as these might\r\nbe disregarded; and that would be the plea that such forbearance and\r\nindulgence on the part of the United States towards the savages only\r\nencouraged them to increased insolence and incited them to fresh\r\noutrages, rendering the situation less and less tolerable, and in the\r\nend involving greater sacrifice of life than would a prompt vindication\r\nof the authority of the government, once for all, however disastrous in\r\nthe immediate result it might prove to existing settlements. If the\r\npolicy of temporizing which has been described does indeed only serve at\r\nthe last to aggravate the evil, and by a false appearance of peace to\r\ndraw within the reach of Indian massacre larger numbers of whites, then\r\nit is plainly the duty of the government to recall, as far as may be,\r\nits citizens from the exposed frontier, and, at whatever expense of\r\nblood and treasure, make issue with the savages, and forever close the\r\nquestion by the complete conquest and reduction of all the hostile or\r\ndangerous tribes. But no assumption could be farther from the facts of\r\nthe case than that the effect of lenity has been to increase the sum of\r\nIndian outrage. There is no _scintilla_ of evidence to show that any\r\nsavage tribe has been incited by the forbearance of the government to\r\nincreased depredations. On the contrary, the history of the past three\r\nyears has shown a steady decline in the number of robberies and murders\r\nreported on the frontier.\r\n\r\nIf a humane consideration of the exposed condition of our frontier\r\nsettlements requires the continuance of the policy of buying off the\r\nhostile and dangerous tribes, it is also true that the argument from\r\neconomy equally favors this action on the part of the government.\r\nExpensive as is the Indian service as at present conducted in the\r\ninterest of peace, it costs far less than fighting. What would be the\r\nexpense of a general Indian war, which should seek the complete\r\nsubjugation of the tribes which we have described as potentially\r\nhostile, it is impossible to compute within a hundred millions of\r\ndollars; but it would undoubtedly reach an aggregate not much short of\r\nthat of the year of largest preparations and largest operations during\r\nthe rebellion. Does this seem extravagant, impossible? Words of truth\r\nand soberness on such a subject surely might be expected from a\r\ncommission comprising such men as Gens. Sherman, Harney, Augur, and\r\nTerry of the regular army of the United States. Yet these officers\r\nunited in a report rendered to the President on the 7th of January,\r\n1868, in which they use the following language in reference to the\r\n\"Chivvington massacre\" and the Cheyenne war of 1864:--\r\n\r\n     \"No one will be astonished that a war ensued which cost the\r\n     government thirty million dollars, and carried conflagration\r\n     and death to the border settlements. During the spring and\r\n     summer of 1865, no less than eight thousand troops were\r\n     withdrawn from the effective force engaged in suppressing the\r\n     Rebellion, to meet this Indian war. The result of the year's\r\n     campaign satisfied all reasonable men that war with Indians\r\n     was useless and expensive. Fifteen or twenty Indians had been\r\n     killed at an expense of more than a million dollars apiece,\r\n     while hundreds of our soldiers had lost their lives, many of\r\n     our border settlers had been butchered, and their property\r\n     destroyed.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the experience of the United States in a contest with an Indian\r\ntribe numbering perhaps four thousand men, women, and children, and able\r\nto bring into the field not one-fifth as many warriors as the Sioux\r\nbands of to-day. Not to go back to wars waged with tribes now subjugated\r\nor extinct, were we to cast up the expenditures involved in the Sioux\r\nwar of 1852-1854, the Cheyenne war of 1864 just referred to, the Navajo\r\nwar, the second Sioux war in 1866, the second Cheyenne war in 1867, we\r\nshould undoubtedly reach a total greatly exceeding one hundred millions\r\nof dollars. Yet these wars sought only the submission of individual\r\ntribes to single demands of the government, and effected, generally,\r\nsomething less than that. It has been shown that the actual expense of\r\nthe so-called \"peace policy\" is measured by the increase of the average\r\nexpenditures of the period 1869 to 1872 over the average expenditures of\r\nthe period preceding, that increase being about three millions of\r\ndollars. This is the sum which is to be compared with the cost of a war\r\nwhich should seek to reduce all the Indian tribes of the continent to\r\ncomplete submission by force of arms, instead of awaiting their gradual,\r\nand in the main peaceful reduction through the advance of population and\r\nthe extension of railways.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far treated the policy of the government towards the\r\ndangerous tribes as one not requiring the use of the military arm in\r\nany emergency short of an actual outbreak. We have done so, first, that\r\nwe might encounter the full effect of the objections to the plan of\r\nconcession and conciliation; and, secondly, because we hold it true,\r\nthat, when the alternative is between allowing a considerable degree of\r\ninsolence and outrage to go unpunished, and entailing upon the\r\nTerritories a general Indian war, duty and interest require the\r\ngovernment to go to the last point of endurance and forbearance with the\r\nsavages. But this alternative is not always presented: it is often\r\npracticable to repress and punish violence, without exposing the\r\nsettlements to the horrors of massacre. Whenever this can be done, it is\r\nscarcely necessary to say it should be done, and done effectually. The\r\nfeature of the present Indian policy of the government which allows this\r\nto be done without incurring general Indian war is known as the\r\nreservation system,--a system shrewdly devised to meet the known\r\nweaknesses of the Indian character. By it extensive tracts have been set\r\napart for the warlike tribes, within which they may pursue all their\r\ncustoms and habits of life, and indulge themselves in savagery, being\r\nalso subsisted thereon to the extent of their actual necessities, but\r\noutside of which bands or parties are liable to be struck by the\r\nmilitary at any time, without warning, and without any implied hostility\r\nto those members of the tribe who remain on their reservation, and\r\ndeport themselves according to the conditions of the compact. The\r\nbrilliant campaign of Gen. Crook in Arizona during the past season has\r\nbeen prosecuted with the most scrupulous observance of the reservation\r\nsystem, as marked out by the government, and accepted by the Indians\r\nthemselves. Such a use of the military arm constitutes no abandonment of\r\nthe \"peace policy,\" and involves no disparagement of it. Military\r\noperations thus conducted are not in the nature of war, but of\r\ndiscipline, and are so recognized by the tribes whose marauding bands\r\nand parties are scourged back to the reservations by the troops. The\r\neffect of all this is something more than negative. It does not merely\r\nserve to chastise offending individuals and parties without a breach of\r\npeace with the tribe; but it is made the means of impressing the less\r\nenterprising Indians with an increasing sense of the power of the\r\ngovernment. It was not to be expected that the entire body of a warlike\r\ntribe would consent to be restrained in their Ishmaelitish proclivities\r\nwithout a struggle on the part of the more audacious to maintain their\r\ntraditional freedom. The reservation system allows this issue to be\r\nfought out between our troops and the more daring of the savages,\r\nwithout involving in the contest tribes with which our army in its\r\npresent numbers is wholly inadequate to cope.\r\n\r\nNor will the full effect of this consideration be appreciated if it be\r\nnot borne in mind that the Indian is intensely susceptible to severe\r\npunishment. His own wars are so bloodless, his skirmishing tactics so\r\ncowardly and resultless, that the savage fighting of the whites, their\r\neagerness for close quarters, and their deadly earnestness when engaged\r\nhand to hand, impress him with a strange terror. With him, as with all\r\npersons and peoples in whom the imagination is predominant, the effect\r\nof disaster is not measured by the actual loss and suffering entailed,\r\nbut by the source, the shape, the suddenness, of it. Indeed, it is\r\nastonishing how completely the spirit of an Indian tribe may be broken\r\nby a catastrophe which does not necessarily impair its fighting power.\r\n\r\nNor even is it necessary that the Indian's sense of justice should be\r\nmet by the chastisement received. Undiscriminating in his own revenge,\r\nhe does not look for nicely measured retribution on the part of his\r\nenemy. Hence it is that certain of the so-called--and sometimes properly\r\nso called--massacres perpetrated by the army, or by frontier militia,\r\nhave had very different results from what would have been predicted by\r\npersons familiar only with habits of thought and feeling among our own\r\npeople.[D] Injustice and cruelty exasperate men of our race; but the\r\nIndian is never other than cruel and unjust under resentment. Let him\r\nfeel that he has been injured by a white man, and he will tomahawk the\r\nfirst white man he meets, without a thought whether his victim be guilty\r\nor innocent. Let him suffer at the hand of a member of a neighboring\r\ntribe, and he will lie all day in wait for another member of that tribe\r\nwith just as much anticipation of gratified hate as if he awaited the\r\nfootsteps of the wrong-doer. Nay, let him have a feud with one of his\r\nown blood, and he will devote the speechless babes of his enemy to his\r\ninfernal malice. Here, undoubtedly, we find the explanation of the fact\r\nthat massacres, damnable in plot and circumstance, have struck such\r\ndeadly and lasting terror into tribes of savages; while, occurring\r\nbetween nations of whites, they would have kindled the flames of war to\r\ninextinguishable fury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have thus far treated the question, What shall be done with the\r\nIndian as an obstacle to the progress of railways and of\r\nsettlements?--to the exclusion of the inquiry, What shall be done to\r\npromote his advancement in industry and the arts of life?--not merely\r\nbecause, for all those tribes and bands to which the first question\r\napplies (i. e. those which are potentially hostile, and towards which\r\nthe government is, as we have attempted to show, bound in interest and\r\nhumanity to exercise great forbearance till they shall cease to be\r\nformidable to the settlements and to the pioneers of settlement), that\r\nquestion is, in logical order, precedent to any discussion of methods to\r\nbe taken to educate and civilize them; but also because it is in effect\r\nlikewise precedent to any deliberate, comprehensive, and permanent\r\nadjustment of the difficulties experienced in treating the Indian tribes\r\nwhich are neither hostile in disposition nor formidable by reason of\r\ntheir situation or their numbers. So long as the attention of the\r\nexecutive department is occupied by efforts to preserve the peace; so\r\nlong as Congress is asked yearly to appropriate three millions of\r\ndollars to feed and clothe insolent savages; so long as the public mind\r\nis exasperated by reports of Indian outrages occurring in any section of\r\nthe country,--so long will it be vain to expect an adequate treatment of\r\nthe question of Indian civilization.\r\n\r\nIt must not be understood that nothing is being done for the industrial\r\nand moral instruction of the peaceful and more advanced tribes[E]\r\npending the reduction of their turbulent brethren to terms; but the\r\nefforts, and expenditures of the present time fall far short of the\r\ncompleteness and consistency necessary to constitute a system. Much that\r\nis doing is in compliance with treaty stipulations, and hence is well\r\ndone, whether it have any practical result or not. Much, again, of what\r\nis doing, although so inadequate to the necessities of the situation as\r\nto yield no positive results, is preventing waste by keeping up\r\nestablished services and agencies, and, in a measure, preserving the\r\ncharacter and habits of the Indians from further deterioration. Much,\r\nstill, is in the way of experiment, from which may be derived many\r\nvaluable principles and suggestions for the treatment of the Indian\r\nquestion on the larger scale which will be necessary in the future.\r\nMuch, however, it must be confessed, is done out of an uneasy desire to\r\ndo something for this unfortunate people, or in generous response to\r\nappeals from persons in official or private station who have chanced to\r\nbecome particularly interested in the welfare of individual tribes and\r\nbands, and thereafter fail not (small blame to them) to beset Congress\r\nand the departments for special consideration and provision for their\r\n_proteges_. It can scarcely need to be remarked, that these are not the\r\nways to constitute a system.\r\n\r\nIt is a question not a little perplexing, What shall be done with the\r\nIndian when he shall be thrown helpless on our government and people?\r\nWhat _has_ been done with tribes and bands which have reached this\r\ncondition has been, as we have said, of every description; and the\r\nresults have been not less various. We have had guardianship of the\r\nstrictest sort. We have tried industrial experiments on more than one\r\nplan, and have attempted the thorough industrial education of Indian\r\ncommunities as a security for their social advancement. We have, on\r\nother occasions, let the Indian severely alone just so soon as it was\r\nascertained that his power for harm had ceased, and have left him to\r\nfind his place in the social and industrial scale; to become fisherman,\r\nlumberman, herdsman, menial, beggar, or thief, according to aptitude or\r\naccident, or the wants of the community at large. True it is that the\r\nmodes adopted, in fact, in dealing with particular tribes, have\r\ngenerally been due to chance or to the caprices of administration; true,\r\nalso, that the experiments which have been made do not reflect much\r\ncredit on the sagacity of the superior race to which have been intrusted\r\nthe destinies of the red man: but there has been a vast amount of\r\ngood-nature and benevolent intention exhibited; the experiments have\r\nbeen in many directions, and have covered a large field; and while the\r\nresults, in the manifest want of adaptation of means to ends, and of\r\noperations to material, cannot be deemed wholly conclusive of the\r\nphilosophy of the situation, yet very much can be learned from them that\r\nbears upon the questions of the present day. As has been stated, the\r\nissues of the experiments tried have been of every kind. To assertions\r\nthat the Indian cannot be civilized, can be opposed instances of Indian\r\ncommunities which have attained a very considerable degree of\r\nadvancement in all the arts of life. To the more cautious assertion,\r\nthat, while the tribes which subsist chiefly on a vegetable diet are\r\nsusceptible of being tamed and improved, the meat-eating Indians, the\r\nbuffalo and antelope hunters, are hopelessly intractable and savage, can\r\nbe opposed instances of such tribes which, in an astonishingly short\r\ntime, have been influenced to abandon the chase, to undertake\r\nagricultural pursuits, to labor with zeal and patience, to wear white\r\nman's clothes, send their children to school, attend church on Sunday,\r\nand choose their officers by ballot. To the assertion that the Indian,\r\nhowever seemingly reclaimed, and for a time regenerated, still retains\r\nhis savage propensities and animal appetites, and will sooner or later\r\nrelapse into barbarism, can be opposed instances of slow and steady\r\ngrowth in self-respect and self-control, extending over two generations,\r\nwithout an indication of the tendencies alleged. To assertions that the\r\nIndian cannot resist either physical or moral corruption by contact with\r\nthe whites, that he inevitably becomes subject to the baser elements of\r\ncivilized communities, that every form of infectious or contagious\r\ndisease becomes doubly fatal to him, and that he learns all the vices\r\nbut none of the virtues of society, can be opposed instances of tribes\r\nwhich have freely mingled with the whites without debasement, and have\r\nacquired the arts of civilized life with no undue proportion of its\r\nevils. To the assertion that the Indian must gradually decline in\r\nnumbers and decay in strength, his life fading out before the intenser\r\nlife which he encounters, can be offered instances of the steady\r\nincrease in population of no small number of tribes and bands in\r\nimmediate contact with settlements, and subject to the full force of\r\nwhite influence.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is undeniably true that many of the experiments have failed\r\nin a greater or less degree; that in some cases the Indians most\r\nneglected have done better for themselves than those who have received\r\nthe care and bounty of the government; that many tribes and bands which\r\nhad apparently emerged from their barbarous condition have miserably\r\nfallen back into sloth and vicious habits; that the meat-eaters, who\r\nconstitute the bulk of the tribes with which the latest advances of our\r\nsettlements and railways have brought us in contact, are exceptionally\r\nwild and fierce; that the experiment of Indian civilization has far more\r\nchances of success when it is tried under conditions that allow of\r\nfreedom from excitement, and thorough seclusion from foreign influences;\r\nand, finally, that Indian blood, thus far in the history of the country,\r\nhas tended decidedly towards extinction.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Indian Commissioners, in their Report for 1872, make the\r\nstatement that \"nearly five-sixths of all the Indians of the United\r\nStates and Territories are now either civilized or partially civilized.\"\r\n(Report, p. 3.) The Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in his report of the\r\nsame date, places the number of reclaimed savages somewhat lower,\r\ndividing the three hundred thousand Indians within the limits of the\r\nUnited States as follows: civilized, ninety-seven thousand;\r\nsemi-civilized, one hundred and twenty-five thousand; wholly barbarous,\r\nseventy-eight thousand. He is, however, careful to explain that the\r\ndivision is made \"according to a standard taken with reasonable\r\nreference to what might fairly be expected of a race with such\r\nantecedents and traditions.\" Perhaps, on a strict construction of the\r\nword \"semi-civilized,\" the Indian Office might assent to take off twenty\r\nor thirty thousand from the number stated.\r\n\r\nWe all know what a savage Indian is. What is a civilized Indian?--what a\r\nsemi-civilized Indian? To what degree of industry, frugality, and\r\nsobriety can the Indian be brought? How well does he repay efforts and\r\nexpenditures for his enlightenment and his advancement in the arts of\r\nlife? How far does he hold his own when once fairly started on his\r\ncourse by the bounty of the government or by philanthropic enterprise,\r\ninstructed and equipped, with no obstacles in his way, and with no\r\ninterruptions from without? What, in short, may we reasonably expect\r\nfrom this people? What have they done for themselves? or what has been\r\ndone with them in the past? It is doubtful whether zeal or ignorance is\r\nmore responsible for the confusion which exists in the public mind in\r\nrespect to this entire matter of Indian civilization. The truth will be\r\nbest shown by examples.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees, who originally owned and occupied portions of the States\r\nof Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee, have now a reservation of nearly\r\nfour million acres in the tract known as the Indian Territory. They\r\nnumber about fifteen thousand, and are increasing. They have their own\r\nwritten language, their national constitution and laws, their churches,\r\nschools, and academies, their judges and courts. Their dwellings consist\r\nof five hundred frame and three thousand five hundred log houses. During\r\nthe year 1872 they raised three million bushels of corn, besides large\r\nquantities of wheat, oats, and potatoes, their aggregate crops being\r\ngreater than those of New Mexico and Utah combined. Their stock consists\r\nof sixteen thousand horses, seventy-five thousand neat-cattle, one\r\nhundred and sixty thousand hogs, and nine thousand sheep. It is\r\nneedless, after such an enumeration of stock and crops, to say that they\r\nnot only support themselves, but sell largely to neighboring communities\r\nless disposed to agriculture. The Cherokees have sixty schools in\r\noperation, with an aggregate attendance of two thousand one hundred and\r\nthirty-three scholars. Three of these schools are maintained for the\r\ninstruction of their former negro slaves. All orphans of the tribe are\r\nsupported at the public expense. The Cherokees are the creditors of the\r\nUnited States in the sum of a million seven hundred and sixteen thousand\r\ndollars, on account of lands and claims ceded and relinquished by them.\r\nThe interest on this sum is annually paid by the treasurer of the United\r\nStates to \"the treasurer of the Cherokee nation,\" to be used under the\r\ndirection of the national council for objects prescribed by law or\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nFrom the statements made above, all upon the authority of official\r\nreports, it will doubtless appear to every candid reader that the\r\nCherokees are entitled to be ranked among civilized communities. Their\r\ncondition is far better than that of the agricultural classes of\r\nEngland; and they are not inferior in intelligence or in the ability to\r\nassert their rights.\r\n\r\nThere are in the Indian Territory several other important tribes, and a\r\nnumber of small and broken bands, aggregating forty or forty-five\r\nthousand persons, who are in the same general condition as the\r\nCherokees, and are equally--though not, perhaps, in every case, with\r\nquite as much emphasis--entitled to be called civilized. Nor are the\r\nIndians of this class confined to the Indian Territory so called. They\r\nare found in Kansas and Nebraska, in New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, and\r\nMinnesota, and upon the Pacific coast. The ninety or one hundred\r\nthousand Indians thus characterized will bear comparison, on the three\r\npoints of industry, frugality, and sobriety, with an equal population\r\ntaken bodily out of any agricultural district in the Southern or border\r\nStates. In general intelligence and political aptitude they are still\r\nnecessarily below the lowest level of American citizenship, if we\r\nexclude the newly-enfranchised element and the poor white population of\r\na few districts of the South.\r\n\r\nIt is just and proper to call an Indian semi-civilized, no matter how\r\nhumble his attainments, when he has taken one distinct, unmistakable\r\nstep from barbarism; since \"it is the first step that costs.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sioux of the Lake Traverse agency in Dakota number about fifteen\r\nhundred,--to be exact, fourteen hundred and ninety-six. These were of\r\nthe Indians of Minnesota, and escaped to the West after the massacre of\r\n1862, though claiming to have been innocent of participation in it.\r\nThey are genuine specimens of the Indian race in its pure form. They\r\nhave within three or four years made considerable progress in\r\nagriculture. Nearly all the men have of choice adopted the dress of the\r\nwhites. Great interest is manifested in the education of the children of\r\nthe tribe: four schools are in operation, with an attendance of one\r\nhundred and twenty-three scholars; and two more schoolhouses are in\r\ncourse of erection. By the provisions of the treaty of 1867, only the\r\nsick, the infirm, aged widows, and orphans of tender years, are to be\r\nsupported by the government. The number thus enrolled for subsistence\r\nduring the past year was six hundred and sixty, made up as follows:\r\nninety-two men, aged, infirm, blind, crippled, &c.; two hundred and\r\nsixty-four women of various conditions; one hundred and eighteen\r\nchildren under seven years; one hundred and eighty-six children between\r\nseven and sixteen years. The remainder of the tribe supported themselves\r\nfully by their own labor. The agent says, \"It is highly gratifying to be\r\nable to report commendable progress in agriculture by these Sisseton and\r\nWahpeton Sioux on this reservation, who, almost to a man, have become\r\nfully satisfied that they cannot any longer rely upon the chase, but\r\nmust of necessity turn their attention to the cultivation of the soil\r\nand stock-growing, for the future, as the only reliable source of\r\nsubsistence. Many of them have learned to work; and some of them have\r\nlearned to love to work as well; and they evidently enjoy the labor of\r\ntheir hands.\"\r\n\r\nTribes which show a higher actual attainment might have been taken for\r\nillustration out of the semi-civilized list; but these have been chosen,\r\nfirst, because they are meat-eating Indians, and secondly, because the\r\nplan of partial support adopted with them is the one most likely to be\r\napplied to all the Sioux bands, as fast as the government shall find\r\nitself in a position peremptorily to control their actions and\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nAgain: we select the Pawnees, numbering twenty-four hundred and\r\nforty-seven, for illustration, for the reason that they have been long\r\ndistinguished over all the plains for their warlike power and ferocity,\r\nyet, under the care and instruction of the government, have within three\r\nyears made a great degree of progress in three most important respects,\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nFirst, while the Pawnees, from their situation, are still enabled and\r\ndisposed to go upon the summer hunt, they are already engaged to a small\r\nextent, and with encouraging success, in the raising of vegetables and\r\ngarden products, and even of corn and wheat. Two hundred and ten acres\r\nwere planted by them last year in the several crops.\r\n\r\nSecond, while the chiefs and braves of the tribe still look to their\r\ntraditional resource of hunting, the children of the tribe generally are\r\nbeing carefully instructed in letters and in labor. The day-schools and\r\nthe manual-labor schools of the Pawnees have elicited the most\r\nenthusiastic praise from all persons, official or private, who have\r\nvisited the reservation.\r\n\r\nThird,--and this is a point to which we ask special attention, as\r\nindicating capabilities of higher things than are usually credited of\r\nIndians,--the inveterate and ferocious animosities of the Pawnees toward\r\nthe Brule Sioux have been so far sacrificed to the requirements of the\r\ngovernment and the personal entreaties of their agent, that the past\r\nsummer witnessed the phenomenon, astonishing to all who were cognizant\r\nof the deadly feuds existing for generations between these tribes, of\r\nPawnees and Brules hunting almost side by side, the camp-fires of both\r\nbeing distinctly visible upon the same plain, without a murder being\r\ncommitted, or so much as a horse stolen, by either party.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf, then, we may assume that Indian civilization is not altogether\r\nimpossible, let us inquire what should be the policy of the government\r\ntowards the Indian tribes when they cease to be dangerous to our\r\nfrontier population, and to oppose the progress of settlement, either by\r\nviolence or by menace. In such a discussion, we are bound to have a\r\nreasonable consideration for the interests of the white man as well as\r\nfor the rights of the red man, but above all to defer to whatever\r\nexperience declares in respect to the conditions most favorable to the\r\ngrowth of self-respect and self-restraint in minds so strangely and\r\nunfortunately constituted as is the mind of the North American Indian.\r\n\r\n_First._ The reservation system should be made the general and permanent\r\npolicy of the government. By this is meant something more than that the\r\nIndians should not be robbed of their lands in defiance of treaty\r\nstipulations, or that the Indian title should be respected, and the\r\nIndians maintained in possession until they can be made ready to cede\r\ntheir lands to the government, or to sell them, with the consent of the\r\ngovernment, to the whites. The proposition is that the United States, as\r\nthe only power competent to receive such lands by cession, or to\r\nauthorize their sale, should formally establish the principle of\r\nseparation and seclusion, without reference to the wishes either of the\r\nIndians or of encroaching whites; should designate by law an ample and\r\nsuitable reservation for each tribe and band not entitled by treaty; and\r\nshould, in any reductions thereafter requiring to be made, provide that\r\nsuch reductions shall be by cutting off distinct portions from the\r\noutside, and not in such a way as to allow veins of white settlement to\r\nbe injected, no matter whether along a stream or along a railway.\r\n\r\nThe principle of secluding Indians from whites for the good of both\r\nraces is established by an overwhelming preponderance of authority.\r\nThere are no mysterious reasons why this policy should be adopted: the\r\nconsiderations which favor it are plain and incontestable. The first is\r\nthe familiar one, that the Indian is unfortunately disposed to submit\r\nhimself to the lower and baser elements of civilized society, and to\r\nacquire the vices and not the virtues of the whites. This need not be\r\ndwelt upon; but there is still another consideration even more\r\nimportant, yet not generally apprehended. It is that an Indian tribe is\r\na singularly homogeneous body,[F] and, if not disturbed by the intrusion\r\nof alien and discordant elements, is susceptible of being governed and\r\ncontrolled with the greatest ease and effect. It is not necessary to\r\npoint out the ways in which this peculiarity of the Indian character\r\nassists the agent of the government in his administration of a tribe, or\r\nto show how much more complete it makes his success, as, little by\r\nlittle, he is able, through the authority of the government, and the\r\nmeans of moral education at his disposal, to effect a change for the\r\nbetter in the public sentiment of the people under his charge.\r\n\r\nThe number of Indians now having reservations secured to them by law or\r\ntreaty is approximately 180,000. The number of such reservations is 92,\r\nranging in extent from 288 acres to 40,750 square miles, and aggregating\r\n167,619 square miles. Of these reservations, 31, aggregating 2,693\r\nsquare miles, are east of the Mississippi River; 42, aggregating\r\n144,838 square miles, are between the Mississippi and the Rocky\r\nMountains; and 19, aggregating 20,068 square miles, are upon the Pacific\r\nslope. In addition to the above, 40,000 Indians, having no lands secured\r\nto them by treaty, have had reservations set apart for them by executive\r\norder, out of the public lands of the United States. The number of\r\nreservations thus set apart is 15, aggregating 59,544 square miles. The\r\nIndians thus located have, however, in the nature of the case, no\r\nassurance of their occupation of these lands beyond the pleasure of the\r\nexecutive.[G]\r\n\r\nIt must be evident to every one, on the simple statement of such facts\r\nas these, that the reservations, as at present constituted, do not\r\nconsist with the permanent interests of either the Indian or the\r\ngovernment. There are too many reservations: they occupy too much\r\nterritory in the aggregate; and, what is worse, some of them\r\nunnecessarily obstruct the natural access of population to portions of\r\nterritory not reserved, while others, by their neighborhood, render\r\nlarge tracts of otherwise available land undesirable for white\r\noccupation. Indeed, it may be said that the present arrangement of\r\nreservations would constitute an almost intolerable affliction, were it\r\nto be maintained without change. Nor are the interests of the Indians\r\nany better served by the existing order. Many tribes, even were they\r\ndisposed to agriculture, would not find suitable land within the limits\r\nassigned to them. Others are in a position to be incessantly disturbed\r\nand harassed by the whites. Others still, while they stand across the\r\npath of settlement, are themselves, by ill-considered treaty provisions,\r\ncut off from access to hunting-grounds, to fishing privileges, or to\r\nmountains abounding in natural roots and berries, which would be of the\r\ngreatest value to them. When it is considered that the present body of\r\nreservations is the result of hundreds of treaties, made, too often, on\r\nthe part of the government with ignorance and heedlessness, and on the\r\npart of the Indians with the childishness characteristic of the race,\r\nboth parties being not infrequently deceived and betrayed by the\r\ninterpreters employed; when it is considered, moreover, that many of\r\nthese treaties have been negotiated in emergencies requiring immediate\r\naction,--it would be wonderful indeed if the scheme as it stood were not\r\ncumbersome and ineffective.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest, therefore, that the next five or ten years must witness\r\na general recasting of the scheme of Indian reservations. This is not to\r\nbe accomplished by confiscating the Indian title, but by exchange, by\r\ncession, and by consolidation. Let Congress provide the necessary\r\nauthority, under the proper limitations, for the executive departments,\r\nand the adjustment desired can be reached easily and amicably.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Second._ It is further evident, that, in recasting the scheme of\r\nreservations, the principal object should be, while preserving distinct\r\nthe boundaries of every tribe, so to locate them that the territory\r\nassigned to the Indians west of the Mississippi shall constitute one or\r\ntwo grand reservations, with, perhaps, here and there a channel cut\r\nthrough, so to speak, by a railroad, so that the industries of the\r\nsurrounding communities may not be unduly impeded. Such a consolidation\r\nof the Indian tribes into one or two great bodies would leave all the\r\nremaining territory of the United States open to settlement, without\r\nobstruction or molestation.\r\n\r\nShall there be one general reservation east of the Rocky Mountains, or\r\ntwo? This is likely to be the most important Indian question of the\r\nimmediate future. On the one hand, the recommendations of the executive,\r\ncontained in both the Messages of the President and the Annual Reports\r\nof the Secretary of the Interior, for the past two or three years, have\r\nstrongly favored the plan of a single reservation for all the tribes,\r\nNorth and South, East and West, who are not in a condition to become at\r\nan early day citizens of the United States and take their land in\r\nseveralty. The reservation upon which it is proposed to thus collect the\r\nIndians of the United States is at present known as the \"Indian\r\nTerritory,\" although it actually contains but about one-quarter of the\r\nIndian population of the country. This tract covers all the territory\r\nlying between the States of Arkansas and Missouri on the east, and the\r\none-hundredth meridian on the west, and between the State of Kansas on\r\nthe north, and the Red River, the boundary of the State of Texas, on the\r\nsouth; comprising about seventy thousand square miles, and embracing a\r\nlarge body of the best agricultural lands west of the Mississippi. Upon\r\nthis tract, it is claimed, can be gathered and subsisted all the Indians\r\nwithin the administrative control of the government, except such as are\r\nmanifestly becoming ripe for citizenship in the States and Territories\r\nwhere they are now found. Computing the maximum number likely, on the\r\nsuccessful realization of this scheme to be thus concentrated, at two\r\nhundred and fifty thousand, and taking the available lands within the\r\ndistrict, exclusive of barren plains, of flint hills and sand hills, at\r\nan aggregate of thirty million acres, we should have one hundred and\r\ntwenty acres for each man, woman, and child to be provided for.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the original plan of Indian colonization, as\r\ncontained in the report of Secretary Calhoun, accompanying the message\r\nof President Monroe, Jan. 27, 1825, contemplated two general\r\nreservations,--one in the North-west for the Indians of Algonquin and\r\nIroquois stock, and another (being the present Indian Territory) in the\r\nSouth-west for the Appalachian Indians. The ethnographical symmetry of\r\nthat plan has been hopelessly violated by the introduction into the\r\nIndian Territory, and even the incorporation with the Southern tribes,\r\nof individuals, broken bands, and even entire tribes, originally from\r\nthe North and North-east. The bulk of the Shawnees, an Algonquin tribe,\r\nare actually incorporated with the Cherokees; two hundred of the\r\nSenecas, the very flower of the conquering Iroquois,[H] occupy a small\r\nreservation in the north-eastern part of the Territory; while the\r\nremnants of the Quapaws, Ottawas, Peorias, Kaskaskias, Weas,\r\nPiankeshaws, Pottawatomies, and of the Sacs and Foxes,--all Algonquin\r\ntribes,--are found injected at various points along the northern and\r\neastern frontier. At the same time, the south-western portion of the\r\nTerritory is given up to tribes which are neither Algonquin, Iroquois,\r\nnor Appalachian in their original, but are of the races living\r\nimmemorially beyond the Mississippi. It will thus appear that nothing\r\nlike an ethnographical distribution of tribes has been attempted; and,\r\nindeed, these distinctions have long ceased, with the Indians\r\nthemselves, to be of the slightest significance. But many of the\r\nphysiological and practical reasons urged by Secretary Calhoun for a\r\ndouble Indian reservation still remain in full force. Nor does this\r\nscheme rest upon his authority alone. The Peace Commission of 1867 and\r\n1868, consisting of Indian Commissioner Taylor, Senator Henderson, Gens.\r\nSherman, Harney, Terry, and Augur, of the army, and Messrs. Sanborn and\r\nTappan, concurred in the recommendation of two reservations for tribes\r\neast of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nWe are disposed to hold, not only that the reason of the case inclines\r\nto the plan of two general reservations, but that the matter will be\r\nsettled practically in that way by the aversion and horror which the\r\nNorthern Indians feel at the thought of moving to the South. Regarding\r\nthe Indian Territory, as they do, though with no sufficient reason, as\r\nthe graveyard of their race, there is ground for apprehension that, if\r\nthe project be too suddenly sprung upon them, or pressed too far, the\r\nrepugnance of some of these tribes may culminate in outbreaks like those\r\nwith which the Black Hawk and Seminole wars commenced. There can,\r\nhowever, be no objection to the experiment being tried in such a way as\r\nnot to endanger the peace. Certain of the Northern tribes, notably the\r\nconfederated Cheyennes and Arapahoes, and the confederated Arickarees\r\nand Mandans, manifest much less antipathy to removal than others, by\r\nreason of their relationship to Indians South, or of exceptional\r\ninconveniences sustained in their present location. If such tribes could\r\nbe amicably induced to go to the Indian Territory, their experiences, if\r\nfortunate, might serve in time to remove the prejudices existing among\r\nthe Northern Indians generally.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Third._ The intrusion of whites upon lands reserved to Indians should\r\nbe provided against by legislation suited to the necessities of the\r\ncase. By the Indian Intercourse Act of 1834 it was made a criminal\r\noffence to enter without authority the limits of any Indian reservation;\r\nand the prohibition was enforced by penalties adequate to the situation\r\nat that time. This provision, however, was aimed at individual\r\nintruders, rather than at organized expeditions completely equipped for\r\noffence or defence, and strong enough to maintain themselves against\r\nconsiderable bands of the savages, or the ordinary _posse comitatus_ of\r\na distant Territory. It is in the latter form that the invasion of\r\nIndian country now generally takes place;[I] and for the purpose of\r\nresisting such organized lawlessness, the Act of 1834 is far from\r\nsufficient. The executive may, it is true, in an extreme case, and by\r\nthe exercise of one of the highest acts of authority, make proclamation\r\nforbidding such combinations, and enforce the same by movements of\r\ntroops, as would be done in the case of a threatened invasion of the\r\nsoil of a neighboring friendly state. But this remedy is of such a\r\nviolent nature, the odium and inconvenience occasioned thereby are so\r\ngreat, and the lawful limits of official action in such a resort are so\r\nill-defined, that the executive is most unlikely to make use of it,\r\nexcept in rare and extreme cases. The eagerness of the average American\r\ncitizen of the Territories for getting upon Indian lands amounts to a\r\npassion. The ruggedest flint hill of the Cherokees or Sioux is sweeter\r\nto him than the greenest pasture which lies open to him under the\r\nhomestead laws of the United States. There is scarcely one of the\r\nninety-two reservations at present established on which white men have\r\nnot effected a lodgement: many swarm with squatters, who hold their\r\nplace by intimidating the rightful owners; while in more than one case\r\nthe Indians have been wholly dispossessed, and are wanderers upon the\r\nface of the earth. So far have these forms of usurpation been carried at\r\ntimes in Kansas, that an Indian reservation there might be defined as\r\nthat portion of the soil of the State on which the Indians have no\r\nrights whatsoever.\r\n\r\nNow, while it cannot be denied that there is something in all this\r\nsuggestive of the reckless daring and restless enterprise to which the\r\ncountry owes so much of its present greatness, it is yet certain that\r\nsuch intrusion upon Indian lands is in violation of the faith of the\r\nUnited States, endangers the peace (as it has more than once enkindled\r\nwar), and renders the civilization of tribes and bands thus encroached\r\nupon almost hopeless. The government is bound, therefore, in honor and\r\nin interest, to provide ample security for the integrity of Indian\r\nreservations; and this can only be done by additional and most stringent\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ The converse of the proposition contained under the preceding\r\nhead is equally true and equally important. Indians should not be\r\npermitted to abandon their tribal relations, and leave their\r\nreservations to mingle with the whites, except upon express authority of\r\nlaw. We mean by this something more than that a \"pass system\" should be\r\ncreated for every tribe under the control of the government, to prevent\r\nindividual Indians from straying away for an occasional debauch at the\r\nsettlements. It is essential that the right of the authorities to keep\r\nmembers of any tribe upon the reservation assigned to them, and to\r\narrest and return such as may from time to time wander away and seek to\r\nally themselves with the whites, should be definitely established, and\r\nthe proper forms and methods of procedure in such cases be fixed and\r\nprescribed by law. Without this, whenever these people become restive\r\nunder compulsion to labor, they will break away in their old roving\r\nspirit, and stray off in small bands to neighboring communities. No\r\npolicy of industrial education and restraint can be devised to meet the\r\nstrong hereditary disinclination of the Indian to labor and to frugality\r\nwhich will not, in its first courses, tend to make him dissatisfied and\r\nrebellious. Nothing but the knowledge that he must stay on his\r\nreservation, and do all that is there prescribed for him; that he will\r\nnot be permitted to throw off his connection with his people, and stray\r\naway to meet his own fate, unprovided, uninstructed, and\r\nunrestrained,--will, under any adequate system of moral and industrial\r\ncorrection and education, prevent a general breaking-up of Indian\r\ncommunities, and the formation of Indian gypsy-camps all over the\r\nfrontier States and Territories, to be sores upon the public body, and\r\nan intolerable affliction to the future society of those communities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Fifth._ A rigid reformatory control should be exercised by the\r\ngovernment over the lives and manners of the Indians of the several\r\ntribes, particularly in the direction of requiring them to learn and\r\npractise the arts of industry, at least until one generation shall have\r\nbeen fairly started on a course of self-improvement. Merely to disarm\r\nthe savages, and to surround them by forces which it is impossible for\r\nthem to resist, leaving it to their own choice how miserably they will\r\nlive, and how much they shall be allowed to escape work, is to render it\r\nhighly probable that the great majority of the now roving Indians will\r\nfall hopelessly into a condition of pauperism and petty crime.\r\n\r\n     \"Unused to manual labor, and physically disqualified for it by\r\n     the habits of the chase, unprovided with tools and implements,\r\n     without forethought and without self-control, singularly\r\n     susceptible to evil influences, with strong animal appetites,\r\n     and no intellectual tastes or aspirations to hold those\r\n     appetites in check, it would be to assume more than would be\r\n     taken for granted of any white race under the same conditions,\r\n     to expect that the wild Indians will become industrious and\r\n     frugal except through a severe course of industrial\r\n     instruction and exercise under restraint.\"--_Report on Indian\r\n     Affairs_, 1872, p. 11.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe right of the government to exact, in this particular, all that the\r\ngood of the Indian and the good of the general community may require is\r\nnot to be questioned. The same supreme law of the public safety which\r\nto-day governs the condition of eighty thousand paupers and forty\r\nthousand criminals, within the States of the Union, affords ample\r\nauthority and justification for the most extreme and decided measures\r\nwhich may be adjudged necessary to save this race from itself, and the\r\ncountry from the intolerable burden of pauperism and crime which the\r\nrace, if left to itself, will certainly inflict upon a score of future\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Sixth._ The provision made by the government for the partial\r\nsubsistence of Indian tribes through the long and painful transition\r\nfrom the hunter life to the agricultural state, for their instruction\r\nand equipment in industrial pursuits, and for starting them finally on a\r\ncourse of full self-support and economical independence, should be\r\nliberal and generous, even to an extreme. The experiment should not be\r\nallowed to encounter any chances of failure which may be avoided by\r\nexpenditure of money. The claim of the Indian in this respect is of the\r\nstrongest. He has no right to prevent the settling of this continent by\r\na race which has not only the power to conquer, but the disposition to\r\nimprove and adorn the land which he has suffered to remain a wilderness.\r\nYet to some royalty upon the product of the soil the Indian is\r\nincontestably entitled as the original occupant and possessor. The\r\nnecessities of civilization may justify a somewhat summary treatment of\r\nhis rights, but cannot justify a confiscation of them. The people of the\r\nUnited States can never without dishonor refuse to respect two\r\nconsiderations,--first, that the Indians were the original occupants and\r\nowners of substantially all the territory embraced within our limits;\r\nthat their title of occupancy has been recognized by all civilized\r\npowers having intercourse with them, and has been approved in nearly\r\nfour hundred treaties concluded by the United States with individual\r\ntribes and bands; and, therefore, every tribe and band that is deprived\r\nof its roaming privilege and confined to a \"diminished reservation\" is\r\nclearly entitled to compensation, either directly or in the form of\r\nexpenditures for its benefit: second, that, inasmuch as the progress of\r\nour industrial enterprise is fast cutting this people off from modes of\r\nlivelihood entirely sufficient for them, and suited to them, and is\r\nleaving them without resource, they have a claim, on this account again,\r\nto temporary support and to such assistance as may be necessary to place\r\nthem in a position to obtain a livelihood by means which shall be\r\ncompatible with civilization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"Had the settlements of the United States not been extended\r\n     beyond the frontier of 1867, all the Indians of the continent\r\n     would to the end of time have found upon the plains an\r\n     inexhaustible supply of food and clothing. Were the westward\r\n     course of population to be stayed at the barriers of to-day,\r\n     notwithstanding the tremendous inroads made upon their\r\n     hunting-grounds since 1867, the Indians would still have hope\r\n     of life. But another such five years will see the Indians of\r\n     Dakota and Montana as poor as the Indians of Nevada and\r\n     Southern California; that is, reduced to an habitual condition\r\n     of suffering from want of food. The freedom of expansion which\r\n     is working these results is to us of incalculable value: to\r\n     the Indian it is of incalculable cost.\"--_Report on Indian\r\n     Affairs_, 1872, p. 10.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Seventh._ It is, further, highly desirable, in order to avoid the\r\npossibility of an occasional failure in such provision for the immediate\r\nwants of the Indians, and for their advancement in the arts of life and\r\nindustry, and also to secure comprehensiveness and consistency in the\r\ngeneral scheme, that the endowments for the several tribes and bands\r\nshould be capitalized and placed in trust for their benefit, out of the\r\nreach of accident or caprice. Annual appropriations for such purposes,\r\naccording to the humor of Congress, will of necessity be far less\r\neffective for good than would an annual income of a much smaller amount,\r\narising from permanent investments.\r\n\r\nTo a considerable extent this has already been effected. For not a few\r\ntribes and bands provision has been made by law and treaty which places\r\nthem beyond the reach of serious suffering in the future, and which, if\r\ntheir income be judiciously administered, will afford them substantial\r\nassistance towards final self-support. Stocks to the value of\r\n$4,810,716.83-2/3 are held by the Secretary of the Interior in trust for\r\ncertain tribes; while credits to the aggregate amount of $5,905,474.59\r\nare inscribed on the books of the United States Treasury in favor of the\r\nsame or other tribes, on account of the sales of lands, or other\r\nconsideration received by the government,[J] making a permanent\r\nendowment of nearly ten millions of dollars, the Indians sharing in the\r\nbenefits thereof numbering in the aggregate nearly eighty thousand.\r\nComputing the average annual return from these funds at five and\r\none-half per cent, we should have an assured income of five hundred and\r\nfifty thousand dollars a year, or about seven dollars for each man,\r\nwoman, and child. Moreover, most of these tribes have still large bodies\r\nof lands which they can dispose of sooner or later, from which funds of\r\ntwice the amount already secured may by honest and judicious management\r\nbe realized; so that, taking these eighty thousand Indians as a body,\r\nthey may be regarded as having a reasonable assurance of funds yielding\r\nan annual income of twenty dollars a head. Their general character and\r\ncondition being considered, this may be accepted as an amply sufficient\r\nendowment, placing their future in their own hands, giving them all the\r\nopportunities and appliances that could reasonably be asked for them,\r\nand securing them against the calamities and reverses which inevitably\r\nbeset the first stages of industrial progress.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the same wise provision for the future has not been made\r\nin the case of other Indians who have ceded or surrendered to the\r\ngovernment the main body of their lands. There is a painfully long list\r\nof tribes that have to show for their inheritance only a guaranty on the\r\npart of the United States of certain expenditures, more or less\r\nbeneficial, for a series of years longer or shorter, as the case may be.\r\nThe Report on Indian Affairs for 1872 (pp. 418-430) states the aggregate\r\nof future appropriations that will be required during a limited number\r\nof years to pay limited annuities at $15,819,310.46. The annuities\r\ncovered by this computation have from one to twenty-seven years to run\r\n(the average term being about seven years), and embrace almost every\r\nvariety of goods and services which human ingenuity could suggest. Many\r\nof the things stipulated to be given to the Indians, or to be done for\r\nthem, are admirable in themselves, but far in advance of the present\r\nrequirements of the tribes; and the expenditures involved are therefore\r\nperfectly useless. Other things would be well enough if the Indians\r\ncould have every thing they wanted, but are absurd and mischievous as\r\ntaking the place of what is absolutely essential to their well-being.\r\nOf other things embraced in the schedule of annual appropriations, it\r\ncan only be said that the Indians need them no more than a toad needs a\r\npocket-book. For such waste of Indian moneys the responsibility rests in\r\nmany cases upon the commissioners, who, on the part of the United\r\nStates, negotiated the treaties under which these appropriations are\r\nannually made. Had they been half as solicitous for the future of the\r\nIndians as they were for the attainment of the immediate object of\r\nnegotiation, the government would have been left free to apply the\r\namounts, to be paid in consideration for cessions, in such manner as to\r\nmake them of substantial benefit; or, better still, the amounts would\r\nhave been capitalized, and a permanent income secured. As it is, many\r\ntribes now see approaching the termination of annuities which have for\r\nmany years been paid them with the very minimum of advantage, and have\r\nno prospect beyond but that of being thrown, uninstructed and\r\nunprovided, upon their own barbarous resources.\r\n\r\nLet us illustrate. A tribe makes a treaty with the United States, ceding\r\nthe great body of their lands, and accepting a diminished reservation\r\nsufficient for their actual occupation. In consideration, it is\r\nprovided that there shall be maintained upon the reservation, for the\r\nterm of fifteen years, at the expense of the United States, a\r\nsuperintendent of teaching and two teachers, a superintendent of farming\r\nand two farmers, two millers, two blacksmiths, a tinsmith, a gunsmith, a\r\ncarpenter, and a wagon and plough maker, with shops and material for all\r\nthese mechanical services. This \"little bill\" is presumably made up\r\nwithout much reference to the peculiarities in character and condition\r\nof the tribe to be benefited by the expenditures involved. As soon as\r\nthe treaty goes into effect, the United States in good faith fulfil\r\ntheir part of the bargain. The shops are built, the employees enlisted;\r\nand the government, through its agent, stands ready to civilize the\r\nIndians to almost any extent. But, unfortunately, the Indians are not\r\nready to be civilized. The glow of industrial enthusiasm, which was\r\ncreated by the metaphorical eloquence of the commissioners in council\r\ndies away under the first experiment of hard work: an hour at the plough\r\nnearly breaks the back of the wild man wholly unused to labor: his pony,\r\na little wilder still, jumps now on one side of the furrow and now on\r\nthe other, and finally settles the question by kicking itself free of\r\nthe galling harness, and disappears for the day. The Indian, a sadder\r\nand wiser man, betakes himself to the chase, and thereafter only visits\r\nthe shops, maintained at so much expense by the government, to have his\r\ngun repaired, or to get a strap or buckle for his riding-gear. But still\r\nthe treaty expenditures go on: the United States are every year loyally\r\nfurnishing what has been stipulated; and the Indian is every year one\r\ninstalment nearer the termination of all his claims upon the government.\r\nMeanwhile, population is closing around the reservation: the animals of\r\nthe chase are disappearing before the presence of the white man, and the\r\nsound of the pioneer's axe: scantier and scantier grow the natural means\r\nof subsistence, fainter and fainter the attractions of the chase; and\r\nwhen at last hunger drives the Indian in to the agency, made ready by\r\nsuffering to learn the white man's ways of life, the provisions of the\r\ntreaty are well-nigh expired. One, three, or five years pass. All the\r\ninstalments have been honorably paid: the appropriation committees of\r\nCongress, with sighs of relief, cross off the name of the tribe from the\r\nlist of beneficiaries; and another body of Indians, uninstructed and\r\nunprovided, are left to shift for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the subject will justify us in dwelling so long upon\r\nit. Of the expenditures made within the last twenty years under treaty\r\nstipulations, probably not one-half has been directed to uses which the\r\ngovernment would have chosen, had it been free to choose. It is most\r\nmelancholy thus to see the scanty patrimony of this people squandered on\r\nworthless objects, or dissipated in efforts necessarily fruitless. The\r\naction of Congress at its last session, in authorizing the diversion of\r\nsums appropriated under treaty stipulations to other specific uses, at\r\nthe discretion of the President and with the consent of the Indians, is\r\na step in the right direction. But the time has come for a complete and\r\ncomprehensive fiscal scheme, looking to the realization from Indian\r\nlands of the largest possible avails, and their capitalization and\r\ninvestment upon terms and conditions which will secure the future of the\r\nseveral tribes, so far as human wisdom may be able to feet this.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the lands held by the eighty thousand Indians who have\r\nalready been spoken of as amply endowed, there are one hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles of territory yet secured by treaty to Indian tribes\r\naggregating one hundred thousand persons. Besides these, forty thousand\r\nIndians enjoy, by executive order, the occupation of other sixty\r\nthousand square miles of territory, which, or the substantial equivalent\r\nof which, should be secured to them by law for their ultimate endowment.\r\nIt is to these lands that such a fiscal scheme as has been indicated\r\nshould be applied. The reservations assigned to tribes and bands are\r\ngenerally proportioned to the needs of the Indians in a roving state,\r\nwith hunting and fishing as their chief means of subsistence. As the\r\nIndians change to agriculture, the effect is to contract the limits of\r\nactual occupation, rendering portions available for cession or sale,\r\nwhich with proper management may be so disposed of, without impairing\r\nthe integrity of the reservation system, as to realize for nearly every\r\ntribe and band a fund equal, _per capita_, to that of many of the\r\ncivilized tribes of the Indian Territory. But this cannot be done by\r\nhelter-skelter or haphazard administration. The subject must be taken up\r\nas a whole, broadly considered, and intelligently treated, and the\r\nscheme which shall be adopted thereafter be regarded as not less sacred\r\nthan the compromises of the Constitution, or than existing treaty\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nFor the tribes and bands having no reservations secured to them,\r\nseparate provision should be made. These number about fifty thousand\r\npersons, deduction being made of such as already have their lands in\r\nseveralty, or as are hopelessly scattered among the settlements. Many of\r\nthese tribes and bands might, with the assistance of the government,\r\nadvantageously \"buy themselves in\" to the privileges of tribes already\r\nprovided for, without involving any further donation of lands.\r\n\r\nWhere it is found impracticable thus to place the unprovided bands, the\r\ngovernment should secure their location and endowment separately. Their\r\nright is no less clear than the right of other tribes which had the\r\nfortune to deal with the United States before Congress put an end to the\r\ntreaty system. We have received the soil from them; and we have\r\nextinguished their only means of subsistence. Either consideration would\r\nbe sufficient to require us, in simple justice, to find them a place and\r\nways to live.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing constitute what we regard as the essential features of an\r\nIndian policy which shall seek positively and actively the reformation\r\nof life and manners among the Indians under the control of the\r\ngovernment, as opposed to the policy of hastening the time when all\r\nthese tribes shall be resolved into the body of our citizenship, without\r\nseclusion and without restraint, letting such as will, go to the dogs,\r\nletting such as can, find a place for themselves in the social and\r\nindustrial order, the responsibility of the government or our people for\r\nthe choice of either or the fate of either being boldly denied;\r\nsuffering, meanwhile, without precaution and without fear, such\r\ndebasement in blood and manners to be wrought upon the general\r\npopulation of the country as shall be incident to the absorption of this\r\nrace, relying upon the inherent vigor of our stock to assimilate much\r\nand rid itself of more, until, in the course of a few human generations,\r\nthe native Indians, as a pure race or a distinct people, shall have\r\ndisappeared from the continent.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for maintaining that nothing less than a system of moral and\r\nindustrial education and correction can discharge the government of its\r\nobligations to the Indians, or save the white population from an\r\nintolerable burden of pauperism, profligacy, and petty crime, have been\r\npresented sufficiently at length in this paper. The details of\r\nmanagement and instruction need not be here discussed: most of them are\r\nwithin the administrative discretion of the department charged with\r\nIndian affairs; and, where power is wanting to the department, the good\r\nfeeling of Congress may be safely trusted to give the necessary\r\nauthority. But the points which have been presented are of vital\r\nconsequence, and must, if the evils we apprehend are to be prevented, at\r\nan early date be embodied in legislation which shall provide means and\r\npenalties ample for its own enforcement.\r\n\r\nAre the Indians destined to die out? Are we to make such provision as\r\nhas been indicated, or such other as the wisdom or unwisdom of the\r\ncountry shall determine, for a vanishing race? Or are the original\r\ninhabitants of the continent to be represented in the variously and\r\ncuriously composed population which a century hence will constitute the\r\npolitical body of the United States? If this is to be in any appreciable\r\ndegree one of the elements of our future population, will it be by\r\nmixture and incorporation? Or will the Indian remain a distinct type in\r\nour museum of humanity, submitting himself to the necessities of a new\r\ncondition, adapting himself, as he may be able to do, to the laws and\r\ncustoms of his conquerors, but preserving his own identity, and making\r\nhis separate contribution to the life and manners of the nation?\r\n\r\nThe answers to these questions will depend very much on the course to be\r\nfollowed in the immediate future with respect to the tribes not yet\r\nembraced within the limits of States of the Union. If, for the want of a\r\ndefinite and positive policy of instruction and restraint, they are left\r\nto scatter under the pressure of hunger, the intrusion of squatters and\r\nprospectors, or the seductions of the settlements, there is little doubt\r\nthat the number of Indians of full blood will rapidly diminish, and the\r\nrace, as a pure race, soon become extinct. But nothing could be more\r\ndisastrous than this method of ridding the country of an undesirable\r\nelement. Not only would it be more cruel to the natives than a war of\r\nextermination; but it would entail in the course of its accomplishment a\r\nburden of vice, disease, pauperism, and crime upon a score of new\r\nStates, more intolerable than perpetual alarms or unintermitted war.\r\n\r\nBut if, on the other hand, the policy of seclusion shall be definitely\r\nestablished by law and rigidly maintained, the Indians will meet their\r\nfate, whatever it may be, substantially as a whole and as a pure race.\r\nWhite men will still be found, so low in natural instincts, or so\r\nalienated by misfortunes and wrongs, as to be willing to abandon\r\ncivilization, and hide themselves in a condition of life where no\r\nartificial wants are known, and in communities where public sentiment\r\nmakes no demand upon any member for aught in the way of achievement or\r\nself-advancement. Here such men, even now to be found among the more\r\nremote and hostile tribes, will, unless the savage customs of adoption\r\nare severely discountenanced by law, find their revenge upon humanity,\r\nor escape the tyranny of social observance and requirement. Half-breeds,\r\nbearing the names of French, English, and American employees of fur and\r\ntrading companies, or of refugees from criminal justice \"in the\r\nsettlements,\" are to be found in almost every tribe and band, however\r\ndistant. Many of them, grown to man's estate, are among the most daring,\r\nadventurous, and influential members of the warlike tribes, seldom\r\nwholly free from suspicion on account of their relation on one side to\r\nthe whites, yet, by the versatility of their talents and the\r\nrecklessness of their courage, commanding the respect and the fear of\r\nthe purebloods, and, however incapable of leading the savages in better\r\ncourses, powerful in a high degree for mischief.\r\n\r\nThe white men, who, under the reservation system, are likely to become\r\naffiliated with Indian tribes as \"squaw men,\" are, however, probably\r\nfewer than the Indian women who will be enticed away from their tribes\r\nto become the cooks and concubines of ranchmen. One is surprised even\r\nnow, while travelling in the Territories, to note the number of cabins\r\naround which, in no small families, half-breed children are playing.\r\nHowever moralists or sentimentalists may look upon connections thus\r\nformed by men who are in effect beyond the pale of society and of law,\r\nthey constitute already a distinct feature of border life; nor is any\r\nstatute likely to prevent Indian women occasionally thus straying from\r\ntheir own people, or to compel their return so long as they are under\r\nthe protection of white men.\r\n\r\nBut, while the seclusion of the two races upon the frontier is certain\r\nto be thus broken in instances which will form no inconsiderable\r\nexception to the rule, the substantial purity of blood may be maintained\r\nby an early adjustment of reservations, the concentration of tribes, and\r\nthe exercise of disciplinary control by their agents over the movements\r\nof wandering parties. Whether, in such an event, the Indians, thus left\r\nto meet their fate by themselves, with reasonable provision by the\r\ngovernment for their instruction in the arts of life and industry, will\r\nwaste away in strength and numbers, is a question quite too large to be\r\nentered upon here. Popular beliefs and scientific opinion undoubtedly\r\ncontemplate the gradual if not the speedy decline of Indian tribes when\r\ndeprived of their traditional freedom of movement, pent up within limits\r\ncomparatively narrow, and compelled to uncongenial occupations. But\r\nthere is grave reason to doubt whether these causes are certain to\r\noperate in any such degree as to involve the practical extinction of the\r\nrace within that immediate future on which we are accustomed to\r\nspeculate, and for which we feel bound to make provision. On the\r\ncontrary, there are many considerations and not a few facts which fairly\r\nintimate a possibility that the Indian may bear restriction as well as\r\nthe negro has borne emancipation; and, like the negro, after a certain\r\ninevitable loss consequent upon a change so great and violent, adapt\r\nhimself with increased vitality to new conditions. It is true that the\r\ntransition, compulsory as to a great degree it must be, from a wholly\r\nbarbarous condition of life, which remains to be effected for the eighty\r\nto one hundred thousand Indians still outside the practical scope of the\r\nIndian service, is likely to further reduce, for some years to come, the\r\naggregate number of this race; but it is not improbable that this will\r\nbe coincident with a steady increase among the tribes known as\r\ncivilized.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing discussion of the policy to be pursued in dealing with\r\nthe Indians of the United States, there has been no disposition to mince\r\nmatters, or to pick expressions. The facts and considerations deemed\r\nessential have been presented bluntly. Some who cannot bear to hear\r\nIndians spoken of as savages, or to contemplate the chastisement of\r\nmarauding bands, may blame our frankness. But we hold fine sentiments to\r\nbe out of place in respect to a matter like this, which in the present\r\nis one of life and death to thousands of our own flesh and blood, and in\r\nthe future one of incalculable importance to a score of States yet to be\r\nformed out of the territory over which the wild tribes of to-day are\r\nroaming in fancied independence. The country has a right to the whole\r\nnaked truth,--to learn what security our fellow-citizens have for their\r\nlives, and also to learn what becomes of the seven millions of dollars\r\nannually collected in taxes and disbursed on Indian account.\r\n\r\nIf the case has been fairly presented, it will doubtless appear to our\r\nreaders, that, so far as the hostile and semi-hostile Indians are\r\nconcerned, the government is merely temporizing with a gigantic evil,\r\npocketing its dignity from considerations of humanity and economy, and\r\nawaiting the operation of causes both sure and swift, which must within\r\na few years reduce the evil to dimensions in which it can be dealt with\r\non principles more agreeable to the ideas and ways of our people.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, it will be seen that the United States have, without much\r\norder or comprehension, but with a vast amount of good-will, undertaken\r\nenterprises involving considerable annual expenditures for the\r\nadvancement of individual tribes and bands, but that the true permanent\r\nscheme for the management and instruction of the whole body of Indians\r\nwithin the control of the government is yet to be created. Let it not\r\nfor a moment be pretended that the prospect is an agreeable one.\r\nCongress and the country might well wish to be well rid of the matter.\r\nNo subject of legislation could be more perplexing and irritating; nor\r\ncan the outlay involved fail for many years to be a serious burden upon\r\nour industry. But the nation cannot escape its responsibility for the\r\nfuture of this race, soon to be thrown in entire helplessness upon our\r\nprotection. Honor and interest urge the same imperative claim. An\r\nunfaithful treatment will only make the evil worse, the burden heavier.\r\nIn good faith and good feeling we must take up this work of Indian\r\ncivilization, and, at whatever cost, do our whole duty by this most\r\nunhappy people. Better that we should entail a debt upon our posterity\r\non Indian account, were that necessary, than that we should leave them\r\nan inheritance of shame. We may have no fear that the dying curse of the\r\nred man, outcast and homeless by our fault, will bring barrenness upon\r\nthe soil that once was his, or dry the streams of the beautiful land\r\nthat, through so much of evil and of good, has become our patrimony; but\r\nsurely we shall be clearer in our lives, and freer to meet the glances\r\nof our sons and grandsons, if in our generation we do justice and show\r\nmercy to a race which has been impoverished that we might be made rich.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] From \"The North American Review,\" April, 1873.\r\n\r\n[B] The writer does not intend to say that the citizens of the border\r\nStates are always just or reasonable in their disposition towards the\r\nIndians. It cannot be denied, that, in the exasperation of conflict,\r\nthey often commit atrocities rivalling those of the savages; that,\r\nmoreover, under the smart of wrong, they are very often indiscriminating\r\nin their revenge, and do cruel injustice to peaceful bands; and that,\r\nwith the recklessness characteristic of border talk, they indulge to a\r\nvast extent in denunciations of horrible sound. To this is added, that\r\nin such communities are found more than the usual number of persons of a\r\nnatural malignity of disposition, often refugees from criminal justice,\r\nwho delight in committing outrages upon the exposed and helpless members\r\nof an inferior race. The opinion which the writer has given above is\r\nentirely consistent with the present admissions. The animosities felt\r\nand expressed are not towards the Indians as Indians, but arise out of\r\nthe sense of injuries suffered, and the apprehension of further\r\nsuffering. Were the Indians once rendered, by the extension and\r\nstrengthening of our settlements, powerless for harm, the easy\r\ntolerance, the rough good-nature, and the quick condonement of wrong,\r\nwhich characterize pioneer communities, would speedily reconcile the\r\nwhites to their presence, and establish relations not wholly unworthy of\r\nboth parties.\r\n\r\n[C] The relations of the Arickarees--or, as they are commonly called,\r\neven in official reports, the 'Rees--to the government, form one of the\r\nmost instructive chapters of Indian history. In 1838 the agent for the\r\nUpper Missouri Indian agency, in his annual report to the Department of\r\nIndian Affairs, used the following language in respect to this tribe:--\r\n\r\n\"The Riccaras have long been notorious for their treachery and\r\nbarbarity, and, within my own recollection, have murdered and pillaged\r\nmore of our citizens than all the other tribes between the western\r\nborders of Missouri and the heads of the Columbia River.\"--_Report on\r\nIndian Affairs_, 1838-9, p. 65.\r\n\r\nThis is language which one might expect from the agent of some\r\nexceptionally troublesome band of Sioux. But, to the contrary, in\r\nanother portion of his report (_Ib._ p. 64) the same agent says, \"No\r\nIndians ever manifested a greater degree of friendship for the whites in\r\ngeneral, or more respect for our government, than the Sioux.\" This\r\nreport was made thirty-four years ago, the limit of one human\r\ngeneration. To-day the Sioux are among the most dangerous and\r\ntroublesome Indians on the hands of the government, while the Arickarees\r\nare our fast friends and allies. Lieut.-Gen. Sheridan, in 1871, writing\r\nof these Indians, now located at Fort Berthold, says, \"They have always\r\nbeen civil and well disposed, and have been repaid by the government\r\nwith neglect and starvation. Of all Indians in the country, they were\r\nthe best entitled to be looked after, and made happy and contented.\"\r\nSomething, clearly, has made this difference; and an inquirer would\r\ndoubtless find here an explanation of no small part of the difficulties\r\nwhich the United-States Government has experienced in dealing with the\r\nIndian tribes.\r\n\r\n[D] To take one of the most recent examples: Col. Baker's attack upon a\r\nPiegan camp in 1869, even though it should be held to be justified on\r\nthe ground of necessity, must be admitted to be utterly revolting in its\r\nconception and execution. Yet no merited chastisement ever wrought more\r\ninstant and durable effects for good. The Piegans, who had been even\r\nmore wild and intractable than the Sioux, have since that affair been\r\norderly and peaceable. No complaints whatever are made of their conduct;\r\nand they are apparently as good Indians as can be found among the wholly\r\nuncivilized tribes.\r\n\r\n[E] The Report on Indian Affairs for 1872 shows that, in addition to\r\nphysicians, clerks, cooks, herders, teamsters, laborers, and interpreters,\r\nthere are employed at all the agencies eighty-two teachers, eighty\r\nfarmers, seventy-three blacksmiths, seventy-two carpenters, twenty-two\r\nmillwrights and millers, seventeen engineers, eleven matrons of\r\nmanual-labor schools, and three seamstresses.--_Report_, pp. 68-71.\r\n\r\n[F] We are speaking of the tribe socially, not politically. Factions and\r\nfaction wars are known to the Indian as well as to his betters.\r\n\r\n[G] Report on Indian Affairs, 1872, p. 84.\r\n\r\n[H] The popular and doubtless the correct use of the word \"Iroquois\"\r\nconfines it to the Five Nations (subsequently the Six Nations) of New\r\nYork, which during the third quarter of the seventeenth century\r\ndestroyed or dispersed successively the Hurons or Wyandots, the nation\r\ncalled (for the want of a more characteristic name) the Neutral Nation,\r\nthe Andastes of the Susquehanna, and the Eries. These four large and\r\nimportant peoples were closely kindred to the Five Nations; and the term\r\n\"Iroquois\" was long applied to this entire family of tribes. Later in\r\nthe history of the continent, it embraced only the Five (or Six) Nations\r\nfor the best of good reasons, as this formidable confederacy had\r\npractically annihilated all the other branches of the family. The career\r\nof the Iroquois was simply terrific. Between 1649 and 1672 they had, as\r\nstated, accomplished the ruin of the four tribes of their own blood,\r\ncontaining in the aggregate a population far more numerous than their\r\nown. A feeble remnant, a few score in number, of the Wyandots, now\r\nsurvive, and are represented at Washington by an exceptionally shabby\r\nwhite man, who has received the doubtful honor of adoption into the\r\ntribe. These are all the recognizable remains of a nation once estimated\r\nto contain thirty thousand. The names of the Eries, the Andastes, and\r\nthe Neutral Nation do not appear in any treaty with the United States.\r\nMany, doubtless, from all these tribes fled to Canada. Considerable\r\nnumbers were also, according to the custom of the Five Nations, adopted\r\nby the conquerors to make good the waste of war.\r\n\r\nNor did the Iroquois wait to complete the subjugation of their own\r\nkindred, before turning their arms against their Algonquin neighbors.\r\nThe Delawares (Lenni Lenape, or Original Men) were subjugated almost\r\ncoincidently with the Hurons; and the same year which brought the\r\ndownfall of the Andastes witnessed the expulsion of the Shawnees from\r\nthe valley of the Ohio. Re-enforced in 1712 by the Tuscaroras, a warlike\r\ntribe from the South, the Five Nations (now become the Six Nations)\r\ncarried their conquests east and west, north and south. The tribes\r\nconfronting the invaders in New England, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\r\nVirginia were continually disturbed and distracted by their incursions.\r\nTaking the part of the English in the wars against the French, they\r\nshook all Canada with the fear of their arms, while to the west they\r\nextended their sway to the Straits of Michilimackinac and the entrance\r\nto Lake Superior. The height of their fame was at the close of the Old\r\nFrench War in 1763. Their decline and downfall, as a power upon the\r\ncontinent, followed with the briefest interval. Reduced by incessant\r\nfighting to seventeen hundred warriors, they took the part of England\r\nagainst the Colonies in 1775. The glorious and the terrible incidents of\r\nthe Indian campaigns of the Revolution are familiar as household words.\r\nThe peace of 1783 found the Iroquois broken, humbled, homeless,\r\nhelpless, before the power of the United States, whose pensioners they\r\nthen became and have since remained. The bulk of these tribes still\r\nreside in New York, while fragments of them are found in the extreme\r\nWest, having removed under the treaty of 1838.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, is the history of the Iroquois. They were the scourge of\r\nGod upon the aborigines of the continent, and were themselves used up,\r\nstock, lash, and snapper, in the tremendous flagellation which was\r\nadministered through them to almost every branch, in turn, of the great\r\nAlgonquin family. It will not do to say, that, but for the Iroquois, the\r\nsettlement of the country by the whites would not have taken place; yet\r\nassuredly that settlement would have been longer delayed, and have been\r\nfinally accomplished with far greater expense of blood and treasure, had\r\nnot the Six Nations, not knowing what they did, gone before in savage\r\nblindness and fury, destroying or driving out tribe after tribe which\r\nwith them might, for more than one generation at least, have stayed the\r\nwestern course of European invasion.\r\n\r\n[I] The impudent character of these invasions will be best shown by a\r\nrecital of the facts in two cases occurring within the year. In 1870-71\r\nthe Osages living in Kansas sold their lands under authority of the\r\ngovernment, and accepted a reservation, in lieu thereof, in the Indian\r\nTerritory. Scarcely had they turned their faces towards their new home\r\nwhen a sort of race began between them and some hundreds of whites,\r\nwhich may be described, in the language of boys, as having for its\r\nobject \"to see which should get there first.\" In October, 1871, the\r\nagent reported that five hundred whites were on the Osage lands, and\r\nactually in possession of the Osage village, while the rightful owners\r\nwere encamped outside. Orders having been issued from the War Department\r\nfor the removal of these intruders, political pressure was brought to\r\nbear upon the executive to prevent the orders from being carried into\r\neffect. This effort failing, delay was asked, in view of the hardships\r\nto be anticipated from a removal so near winter. This indulgence having\r\nbeen granted, the number of the trespassers continued to increase\r\nthrough the winter, in spite of the notice publicly given of the\r\nintentions of the government: so that in the spring of 1872 the military\r\nauthorities found fifteen hundred persons on the Osage lands in defiance\r\nof law. On this occasion, however, the land-robbers had failed in their\r\ncalculations. The government was in earnest; and the squatters were\r\nextruded by the troops of the Department of the Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe other instance referred to is that of an expedition projected and\r\npartially organized in Dakota, in 1872, for the purpose of penetrating\r\nthe Black Hills, for mining and lumbering. Public meetings at which\r\nFederal officials attended were held, to create the necessary amount of\r\npublic enthusiasm; and an invasion of Indian territory was imminent,\r\nwhich would, beyond peradventure, have resulted in a general Sioux war.\r\nIn this case the emergency was such that the executive acted with great\r\npromptness. A proclamation was issued warning evil-disposed persons of\r\nthe determination of the government to prevent the outrage; and troops\r\nwere put in position to deal effectively with the marauders. This proved\r\nsufficient; and the Black Hills expedition was abandoned.\r\n\r\n[J] Report on Indian Affairs, 1872, p. 440.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN CITIZENSHIP.[K]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proper treatment of the Indian question requires that we deal with\r\nthe issues arising out of the peculiar relations of the aboriginal\r\ntribes of the continent to the now dominant race, in much the same\r\nspirit--profoundly philanthropic at bottom, but practical, sceptical,\r\nand severe in the discussion of methods and in the maintenance of\r\nadministrative discipline--with which all Christian nations, and\r\nespecially the English-speaking, nations, have learned to meet the\r\nkindred difficulties of pauperism. It is in no small degree the lack of\r\nsuch a spirit in the conduct of Indian affairs, which has rendered the\r\nefforts and expenditures of our government for the advancement of the\r\nrace so ineffectual in the past; and for this the blame attaches mainly\r\nto the want of correct information and of settled convictions respecting\r\nthis subject, among our people at large. So long as the country\r\nfluctuates in an alternation of sentimental and brutal impulses,\r\naccording as the wrongs done to the Indian or the wrongs done by him are\r\nat the moment more distinctly in mind, it cannot be wondered at that\r\nCongress should be reluctant to undertake the re-organization of the\r\nIndian service on any large and lasting plan, or that the Indian Office\r\nshould hesitate to cut out for itself more work than it can look to make\r\nup in the interval between sessions.\r\n\r\nWhat, to take a recent and memorable instance, would have been the fate\r\nof any scheme of Indian legislation which was at its parliamentary\r\ncrisis when the murder of Gen. Canby occurred? The work of years might\r\nwell have been undone under the popular excitement attendant upon that\r\natrocious deed. Yet it would be quite as rational to denounce the\r\nestablished systems for the care and control of the insane, and to turn\r\nall the inmates of our asylums loose upon the community because one\r\nmaniac had in an access of frenzy murdered his keeper, as it would have\r\nbeen to abandon the established Indian policy of the government, the\r\nonly fault of which is that it is incomplete, on account of any thing\r\nthat Capt. Jack and his companions might do in their furious despair.\r\nThe more atrocious their deed, the more conspicuous the justification of\r\nthe system of care and control from which this one small band of\r\ndesperadoes had for the moment broken free to work such horrid mischief.\r\nYet there is much reason to believe, that, had the Indian service at\r\nthat time depended, as every service must once a year come to depend, on\r\nthe votes of Congressmen, it would have failed, temporarily at least,\r\nfor the want of them. Nor is it only acts of exceptional ferocity on the\r\npart of marauding bands, which have sufficed to check all the gracious\r\nimpulses of the national compassion. The reasons which have existed in\r\nthe public mind in favor of the Indian policy of the government have not\r\nalways been found of a sufficiently robust and practical nature to\r\nwithstand the weariness of sustained effort, and the inevitable\r\ndisappointments of sanguine expectation; and thus the service has at\r\ntimes suffered from the general indifference scarcely less than from the\r\nsharpest revulsions of public feeling.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said within the past three years, of the Indian policy of\r\nthe administration; and, if by this is meant that the policy of the\r\ngovernment in dealing with the Indians has become more and more one of\r\nadministration, and less and less one of law, the phrase, with the\r\nexception of an article too many, is well enough. As matter of fact, the\r\nsole Indian policy of the United States deserving the name was adopted\r\nearly in the century; and it is only of late years that it has been\r\nseriously undermined by the current of events; while it is within the\r\nduration of the present administration that the blow has been struck by\r\nlegislation, at the already tottering structure, which has brought it\r\nnearly to its fall.\r\n\r\nTo throw upon a dozen religious and benevolent societies the\r\nresponsibility of advising the executive in the appointment of the\r\nagents of the Indian service is not a policy. To buy off a few bands,\r\nmore insolent than the rest, by a wholesale issue of subsistence and the\r\nlavish bestowal of presents, without reference to the disposition of the\r\nsavages to labor for their own support, and even without reference to\r\nthe good or ill desert of individuals,--this, though doubtless expedient\r\nin the critical situation of our frontier population, is the merest\r\nexpediency, not in any sense a policy. Yet the two features specified\r\nhave been the only ones that have been added to the scheme of Indian\r\ncontrol during the continuance of the present administration; while, on\r\nthe other side, an irreparable breach has been effected in that scheme\r\nby the action of powerful social forces, as well as by the direct\r\nlegislative contravention of its most vital principle.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest settlement of the country by the whites, down to 1817,\r\nthe Colonies, and afterwards the thirteen States, met the emergencies of\r\nIndian contact as they arose. The parties to negotiation were often\r\nill-defined, and the forms of procedure much as happened. Not only did\r\neach Colony, prior to 1774, conduct its own Indian relations, generally\r\nwith little or no reference to the engagements or the interests of its\r\nwhite neighbors; but isolated settlements and even enterprising\r\nindividuals made their own peace with the savages, or received the soil\r\nby deed from its native proprietors. Nor on the part of the Indians was\r\nthere much more regard for strict legitimacy. Local chieftains were not\r\ninfrequently ready to convey away lands that did not belong to them; and\r\nwhen a Colony grown powerful wished a pretext for usurpation, almost any\r\nIndian would do to make a treaty with or get a title from. It is\r\nscarcely necessary to say of negotiations thus conducted, that they\r\nembraced no general scheme of Indian relations; that they aimed\r\ninvariably at the accomplishment of immediate and more or less local\r\nobjects, and often attained these at the cost of much embarrassment in\r\nthe future, and even at the expense of neighboring settlements and\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nThroughout the history of Colonial transactions, we find few traces of\r\nany thing like impatience of the claims of the Indians to equality in\r\nnegotiation and in intercourse. Neither the power nor the character of\r\nthe aborigines was then despised as now. Strong in his native illusions,\r\nhis warlike prestige unbroken, the Indian still retained all that\r\nnatural dignity of bearing which has been found so impressive even in\r\nhis decline. The early literature of the country testifies to the\r\ndisposition of the people to hold the more romantic view of the Indian\r\ncharacter, even where the animosities of race were deadliest; nor does\r\nit seem that the general sentiment of the Colonies regarded the\r\nnecessity of treating on equal terms with the great confederacies of\r\nthat day as in any degree more derogatory than the civilized powers of\r\nEurope in the same period esteemed the necessity of maintaining\r\ndiplomatic relations with the great Cossack power of the North. Indeed,\r\nthe treaty with the Delawares in 1778 actually contemplated the\r\nformation of a league of friendly tribes under the hegemony of the\r\nDelawares, to constitute the fourteenth State of the confederation then\r\nin arms against Great Britain, with a proportional representation in\r\nCongress. And this was proposed, not by men accustomed to see negroes\r\nvoting at the polls, and even sitting in the Senate of the United\r\nStates, but by our conservative and somewhat aristocratic ancestors.\r\n\r\nBut after the establishment of our national independence, incidental to\r\nwhich had been the destruction of the warlike power of the \"Six\r\nNations,\" the nearest and most formidable of all the confederacies known\r\nto Colonial history, we note a louder tone taken--as was natural\r\nenough--with the aboriginal tribes, a greater readiness to act\r\naggressively, and an increasing confidence in the competency of the\r\nwhite race to populate the whole of this continent. Earlier Indian wars\r\nhad been in a high sense a struggle for life on the part of the infant\r\nsettlements: they had been engaged in reluctantly, after being postponed\r\nby every expedient and every artifice; but the conquest of the territory\r\nnorth-west of the Ohio appears to have been entered upon more from a\r\nstatesmanlike comprehension of the wants of the united and expanding\r\nrepublic, than from the pressure of immediate danger. It was but natural\r\nthat the concentration of the fighting power of the States, the\r\nconsciousness of a common destiny, and the cession of the western\r\nterritory to the general government, should create an impatience of\r\nIndian occupation which neither the separate Colonies nor the States,\r\nstruggling for independence, had felt. Yet even so we do not find that,\r\nfrom 1783 to 1817, the United States did much more than meet the\r\nexigency most nearly and clearly at hand.\r\n\r\nIn the latter year, however, the negotiations for a removal of the\r\nCherokees west of the Mississippi, although commenced under strong\r\npressure from the much-afflicted State of Georgia, and at the time\r\nwithout contemplation of an extension of the system to tribes less\r\nimmediately in the path of settlement, mark the beginnings of a distinct\r\nIndian policy. In 1825 the scheme for the general deportation of the\r\nIndians east of the Mississippi was fairly inaugurated in the presidency\r\nof Mr. Monroe; Mr. Calhoun, his secretary of war, proposing the details\r\nof the measure. In 1834 the policy thus inaugurated was completed by\r\nthe passage of the Indian Intercourse Act, though large numbers still\r\nremained to be transported West.\r\n\r\nThe features of this policy were first, the removal of the tribes beyond\r\nthe limits of settlement; second, the assignment to them in perpetuity,\r\nunder solemn treaty sanctions, of land sufficient to enable them to\r\nsubsist by fishing and hunting, by stock-raising, or by agriculture,\r\naccording to their habits and proclivities; third, their seclusion from\r\nthe whites by stringent laws forbidding intercourse; fourth, the\r\ngovernment of the Indians through their own tribal organizations, and\r\naccording to their own customs and laws.\r\n\r\nThis policy, the character and relations of the two races being taken\r\ninto account, we must pronounce one of sound and far-reaching\r\nstatesmanship, notwithstanding that an advance of population altogether\r\nunprecedented in history has already made much of it obsolete, and\r\nrendered necessary a general re-adjustment of its details.\r\n\r\nThe first event which impaired the integrity of the scheme of President\r\nMonroe was the flight of the Mormons, under the pressure of social\r\npersecution, across the Plains in 1847. The success of this people in\r\ntreating with the Indians has often been noted, and has been made the\r\noccasion of many unjust reflections upon the United States, as if a\r\npopular government, giving, both of necessity and of choice, the largest\r\nliberty to pioneer enterprise, could be reasonably expected to preserve\r\npeaceful relations with remote bands of savages as effectively as a\r\npolitical and religious despotism, keeping its membership compact and\r\nclose in hand. But, while the Mormons have certainly been successful in\r\nmaintaining good terms with the natives of the plains, it is not so\r\ncertain that their influence upon the Indians has been advantageous to\r\nthe government, or to the white settlers not of the church. It clearly\r\nhas been for their interest to attach the natives to themselves rather\r\nthan to the government; it clearly has been in their power to direct a\r\ngreat many agencies to that end; and it will probably require more faith\r\nin Mormon virtue than the majority of us possess to keep alive much of a\r\ndoubt that they have actually done so. We certainly have the opinion of\r\nmany persons well informed that it has been the constant policy of the\r\nLatter-Day Saints to teach the Indians to look to them rather than to\r\nthe government as their benefactors and their protectors; to represent,\r\nas far as possible through agents and interpreters in their interest,\r\nthe goods and supplies received from the United States as derived from\r\nthe bounty of the church; to stir up, for special purposes or for\r\ngeneral ends, troubles between the natives and the encroaching whites,\r\neast, west, and south; and, finally, so to alienate from the government\r\nand attach to themselves the Utes, Shoshones and Bannocks, as to assure\r\nthemselves of their aid in the not improbable event of a last desperate\r\nstruggle for life with the power of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe next event historically which tended to the disruption of the policy\r\nof seclusion was the discovery of gold upon the Pacific slope, which in\r\nthree years replaced the few insinuating priests and indolent\r\n_rancheros_, who had previously formed the white population of the\r\ncoast, with a hundred thousand eager gold-hunters. That the access of\r\nsuch a population--bold, adventurous, prompt to violence, reckless, and\r\ntoo often wantonly unjust and cruel--should stir up trouble and strife\r\nwith the sixty thousand natives, upon whom they pressed at every point\r\nin their eager search for the precious metals, was a thing of course.\r\nThe Oregon War followed, and occasional affairs like that at Ben\r\nWright's Cave, leaving a heritage of hate from which such fruits as the\r\nrecent Modoc War are not inaptly gathered.\r\n\r\nIn 1855-6 occurred the great movement, mainly under a political impulse,\r\nwhich carried population beyond the Missouri. In two or three years the\r\ntribes and bands which were native to Kansas and Nebraska, as well as\r\nthose which had been removed from States east of the Mississippi, were\r\nsuffering the worst effects of white intrusion. Of the Free-State party,\r\nnot a few zealous members seemed disposed to compensate themselves for\r\ntheir benevolent efforts on behalf of the negro by crowding the Indian\r\nto the wall; while the slavery propagandists steadily maintained their\r\nconsistency by impartially persecuting the members of both the inferior\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nThus far we have shown how, instead of the natural boundary between the\r\nraces which was contemplated in the establishment of the Indian policy\r\nof the government under Pres. Monroe, two lines of settlement had, prior\r\nto 1860, been pushed against the Indians,--one eastward from the\r\nPacific, one westward from the Missouri, driving the natives in many\r\ncases from the soil guaranteed to them by treaty, and otherwise leaving\r\nthem at a hundred points in dangerous contact with a border population\r\nnot apt to be nice in its sense of justice, or slow to retaliate real or\r\nfancied injuries; while, during the same period, a colony of religious\r\nfanatics, foreign to the faith, and very largely also to the blood, of\r\nour people, was planted in the very heart of the Indian country, with\r\npassions strongly aroused against the government, and with interests\r\nopposed to the peace and security of the frontier.\r\n\r\nBut it was not until after the Civil War that the progress of events\r\ndealt its heaviest blow at the policy of Indian seclusion. In 1867-8 the\r\ngreat plough of industrial civilization drew its deep furrow across the\r\ncontinent, from the Missouri to the Pacific, as a sign of dissolution to\r\nthe immemorial possessors of the soil. Already the Pacific Railroad has\r\nbrought changes which, without it, might have been delayed for half a\r\ncentury. Not only has the line of settlement been made continuous from\r\nOmaha to Sacramento, so far as the character of the soil will permit;\r\nbut from a score of points upon the railroad population has gone north\r\nand gone south, following up the courses of the streams, and searching\r\nout every trace of gold upon the mountains, till recesses have been\r\npenetrated which five years ago were scarcely known to trappers and\r\nguides, and lodgement has been effected upon many even of the more\r\nremote reservations. The natural effects of this introduction by the\r\nrailroad of white population into the Indian country have not yet been\r\nwholly wrought. There are still reservations where the seclusion of the\r\nIndians is practically maintained by the ill-repressed hostility of\r\ntribes; some, where the same result is secured by the barrenness or\r\ninaccessibility of the regions in which they are situated; but it is\r\nevident that the lapse of another such five years will find every\r\nreservation between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains\r\nsurrounded, and to a degree penetrated, by prospectors and pioneers,\r\nminers, ranchmen, or traders. Against the intrusion of these classes, in\r\nthe numbers in which they are now appearing in the Indian country, the\r\nIntercourse Act of 1834 is wholly ineffective. It was an admirable\r\nweapon against the single intruder: it avails nothing against the\r\nlawless combinations of squatter territories.\r\n\r\nWhile the movements of population have thus in great part destroyed, and\r\nthreaten soon utterly to destroy, at once the seclusion in which it was\r\nhoped the native tribes might find opportunity for the development of\r\ntheir better qualities, and the natural resources to which, in the long\r\ninterval that must precede the achievement of true industrial\r\nindependence by a people taught through centuries of barbarous\r\ntraditions to despise labor, the Indian might look for subsistence,\r\nCongress in 1871 struck the severest blow that remained to be given to\r\nthe Indian policy, in its fourth great feature,--that of the\r\nself-government of tribes according to their own laws and customs,--by\r\ndeclaring that \"Hereafter no Indian nation or tribe within the territory\r\nof the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an\r\nindependent nation, tribe, or power, with whom the United States may\r\ncontract by treaty.\"\r\n\r\nIn the face of three hundred and eighty-two treaties with Indian tribes,\r\nratified by the Senate as are treaties with foreign powers, this may\r\nperhaps be accepted as quite the most conspicuous illustration in\r\nhistory of the adage, \"Circumstances alter cases.\"[L] Since Anthony\r\nWayne received the cession of pretty much the whole State of Ohio from\r\nthe Wyandots, Delawares, and Shawnees, times have indeed changed; and it\r\nis fitting that we should change with them. The declaration of Congress\r\nis well enough on grounds of justice and national honor; but it none the\r\nless aims a deadly blow at the tribal autonomy which was made a vital\r\npart of the original scheme of Indian control. The declaration cited\r\ndoes not in terms deny the self-sufficiency of the tribe for the\r\npurposes of internal self-government; but the immediate necessary effect\r\nof it is further to weaken the already waning power of the chiefs, while\r\nCongress yet fails to furnish any substitute for their authority, either\r\nby providing for the organization of the tribes on more democratic\r\nprinciples, with direct responsibility to the government, or by arming\r\nthe Indian agents with magisterial powers adequate to the exigency.\r\n\r\nUnder the traditional policy of the United States, the Indian agent was\r\na minister resident to a \"domestic dependent nation.\" The Act of March\r\n3, 1871, destroys the nationality, and leaves the agent in the anomalous\r\nposition of finding no authority within the tribe to which he can\r\naddress himself, yet having in himself no legal authority over the tribe\r\nor the members of it. It is true, that, as matter of fact, agents, some\r\nin greater and some in less degree, continue to exercise control after a\r\nfashion over the movements of tribes and bands. This is partly due to\r\nthe force of habit, partly to superior intelligence, partly to the\r\ndiscretion which the agent exercises in the distribution of the\r\ngovernment's bounty; but every year the control becomes less effectual,\r\nand agents and chiefs complain more and more that they cannot hold the\r\nyoung braves in check.\r\n\r\nThe above recital, however tedious, has been necessary in order to set\r\nfairly forth the actual condition of the scheme of seclusion, which is\r\nstill, in profession and seeming, the policy of the government. It must\r\nbe evident from the recital, that the purposes of this policy are not\r\nbeing answered, and that the increasing difficulties of the situation in\r\nthe wider and closer contact of the two races will soon compel Congress\r\nto review the whole field of Indian affairs, and establish relations,\r\nwhich, if they cannot in the nature of things be permanent, will at\r\nleast have reference to the facts of the present, and the probabilities\r\nof the immediate future. Whenever Congress shall take up in earnest this\r\nquestion of the disposition to be made of the Indian tribes, its choice\r\nwill clearly be between two antagonistic schemes,--seclusion and\r\ncitizenship. Either the government must place the Indians upon narrower\r\nreservations, proportioned to their requirements for subsistence by\r\nagriculture, and no longer by the chase,--reservations which shall be\r\nlocated with the view of avoiding as much as possible the contact of the\r\nraces, and working as little hindrance as may be to the otherwise free\r\ndevelopment of population; and around these put up the barriers of forty\r\nyears ago, re-enforced as the changed circumstances seem to require: or\r\nthe government must prepare to receive the Indians into the body of the\r\npeople, freely accepting, for them and for the general community, all\r\nthe dangers and inconveniences of personal contact and legal equality.\r\nNo middle ground is tenable. If substantial seclusion is not to be\r\nmaintained, at any cost, by the sequestration of tribes and by the rigid\r\nprohibition of intercourse, it is worse than useless to keep up the\r\nforms of reservations and non-intercourse. Many tribes are already as\r\nfully subject to all the debasing influences of contact with the whites\r\nas they could be if dispersed among the body of citizens; while yet they\r\nare without any of the advantages popularly attributed to citizenship.\r\n\r\nIt requires no deep knowledge of human nature, and no very extensive\r\nreview of Congressional legislation, to assure us that many and powerful\r\ninterests will oppose themselves to a re-adjustment of the Indian tribes\r\nbetween the Missouri and the Pacific, under the policy of seclusion and\r\nnon-intercourse. Railroad enterprises, mining enterprises, and land\r\nenterprises of every name, will find any scheme that shall be seriously\r\nproposed to be quite the most objectionable of all that could be\r\noffered: every State, and every Territory that aspires to become a\r\nState, will strive to keep the Indians as far as possible from its own\r\nborders; while powerful combinations of speculators will make their\r\nfight for the last acre of Indian lands with just as much rapacity as if\r\nthey had not already, in Western phrase, \"gobbled\" a hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles of it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the political, industrial, and speculative interests\r\nwhich will thus oppose the restoration of the policy of Indian seclusion\r\nfrom the shattered condition to which the events just recited have\r\nreduced it, three classes of persons may be counted on to lend their\r\nsupport to the plan of introducing the Indians, who have thus far been\r\ntreated as \"the wards of the nation,\" directly into the body of our\r\ncitizenship. We have, first, those who have become impatient of the\r\ndemands made upon the time of Congress and the attention of the people\r\nin the name of the Indians, and who wish, once for all, to have done\r\nwith them. Such impatience is neither unnatural nor wholly unreasonable.\r\nIt must be confessed that no good work ever made heavier drafts upon the\r\nfaith and patience of the philanthropic. What with the triviality of the\r\nIndian character, the absurd punctilio with which, in his lowest estate,\r\nhe insists on embarrassing the most ordinary business, and his devotion\r\nto sentiments utterly repugnant to our social and industrial genius;\r\nwhat, again, with the endless variety of tribal relations and tribal\r\nclaims, and the complexity of tribal interests, aggravated by jealousy\r\nand suspicion where no previous intercourse has existed, and by feuds\r\nand traditions of hatred where intercourse has existed,--the conduct of\r\nIndian affairs, whether in legislation or in administration, is in no\r\nsmall degree perplexing and irritating. The Indian treaties prior to\r\n1842 make up one entire volume of the General Statutes, while the\r\ntreaties and Indian laws since that date would fill two volumes of equal\r\nsize. It cannot be denied that this is taking a good deal of trouble for\r\na very small and not very useful portion of the population of the\r\ncountry: and it is not to be wondered at that many citizens, and not a\r\nfew Congressmen, are much disposed to cut the knot instead of untying\r\nit, and summarily dismiss the Indian as the subject of peculiar\r\nconsideration, by enfranchising him, not for any good it may do to him,\r\nbut for the relief of our legislation.\r\n\r\nNext, we have that large and increasing class of Americans, who, either\r\nfrom natural bias, or from the severe political shocks of the last\r\ntwelve years, have accepted what we may call the politics of despair, by\r\nwhich is meant, not so much a belief in any definite ill fortune for the\r\nRepublic, as a conviction that the United States are being borne on to\r\nan end not seen, by a current which it is impossible to resist; that it\r\nis futile longer to seek to interpose restraints upon the rate of this\r\nprogress, or to change its direction; that the nation has already gone\r\nfar outside the traditional limits of safe political navigation, and is\r\ntaking its course, for weal or woe, across an unknown sea, not unlike\r\nthat little squadron which sailed out from the Straits of Saltez on the\r\n3d of August, 1492. Many of the persons now holding these views were\r\nformerly among the most conservative of our people; but emancipation,\r\nnegro suffrage, and the consolidation of power consequent upon the war,\r\nhave wholly unsettled their convictions, leaving them either hopeless of\r\nthe Republic, or, as temperament serves, eager to crowd on sail, and\r\nprove at once the worst and the best of fortune. In this despair of\r\nconservative methods, some of these men have acquired an oddly objective\r\nway of looking at their country, which to every man ought to be a part\r\nof himself, and have apparently as much of a curious as of a patriotic\r\ninterest in watching the development of the new forms and forces of\r\nnational life. Men of this class (and they are not few) are not likely\r\nto hesitate in extending to the Indians citizenship and the ballot. A\r\nlittle more or less, they think, can make no difference. After negro\r\nsuffrage, any thing.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have a class of persons, who, from no impatience of the\r\nsubject, and from no indifference to the welfare of the aborigines, will\r\noppose the policy of seclusion, as an anomaly not to be tolerated in our\r\nform of government. These are men who cannot bear, that, from any\r\nassumed necessity or for any supposed advantage, exception should be\r\nmade of any class of inhabitants, or in respect to any portion of\r\nterritory, to the rule of uniform rights and responsibilities, and of\r\nabsolute freedom of movement, contract, and intercourse, the whole\r\nnation and the whole land over. Were the Indians ten times as numerous,\r\nwere their claims to consideration stronger by no matter how much, and\r\nwere the importance to them of seclusion far more clear than it appears,\r\nthese political philosophers would steadily oppose the scheme. They\r\nmight regret the mischiefs which would result to the Indian from\r\nexposure to corrupting influences; they might be disposed to favor the\r\nmost liberal allowances from the public treasury, in compensation to him\r\nfor his lands, and for his industrial endowment: but they would none the\r\nless relentlessly insist that the red man should take his equal chance\r\nwith white and black, with all the privileges and all the\r\nresponsibilities of political manhood.\r\n\r\nIn view of the likelihood that the expediency of Indian citizenship will\r\nthus become at an early date a practical legislative question, it seems\r\ndesirable in the connection to state the constitutional relations of the\r\nsubject. The judicial decisions are somewhat confused, although, from\r\nthe date (1831) of the decision of Chief-Justice Marshall in the\r\nCherokee Nation vs. the State of Georgia (5 Peters, 1), to that (1870)\r\nof the decision in the Cherokee Tobacco (11 Wallace, 616), there has\r\nbeen a marked progress (note especially the decision of Chief-Justice\r\nTaney in the United States vs. Rogers, 4 Howard, 567) towards the\r\nstronger affirmation of the complete and sufficient sovereignty of the\r\nUnited States. Yet in December, 1870, the Judiciary Committee of the\r\nSenate, Carpenter presenting the Report, after an incomplete, and in\r\nsome respects an inaccurate and inconsequential[M] recital of judicial\r\nopinions, made the following startling announcement:--\r\n\r\n\"Inasmuch as the Constitution treats Indian tribes as belonging to the\r\nrank of nations capable of making treaties, it is evident that an act of\r\nCongress which should assume to treat the members of a tribe as subject\r\nto the municipal jurisdiction of the United States would be\r\nunconstitutional and void.\"\r\n\r\nThat this is not good law need not be argued, inasmuch as the decisions\r\npreviously cited in the United States _vs._ Rogers and in the Cherokee\r\nTobacco, assert the complete sovereignty of the United States in strong\r\nterms[N]; in the latter, the doctrine being explicitly affirmed, that\r\nnot only does the capability of making a treaty with the United States,\r\nwhich has been held to reside in an Indian tribe, not exempt that tribe\r\nfrom the legislative power of Congress, but that not even a treaty made\r\nand ratified, among the stipulations of which is such an exemption, even\r\nwere that exemption the consideration for cessions the benefit of which\r\nthe United States has enjoyed and continues to enjoy, can hinder\r\nCongress from at any time extending its complete legislative control\r\nover the tribe. Considerations of good faith may influence individual\r\nCongressmen in such a case; but the constitutional competence of\r\nCongress in the premises is declared to be beyond question.\r\n\r\nNor is the extraordinary proposition of the Committee's report better in\r\nreason than in law. The argument is in effect this: The United States\r\nmakes treaties with foreign nations; the United States cannot legislate\r\nfor foreign nations; the United States may make treaties with Indian\r\ntribes: ergo, the United States cannot legislate for Indian tribes.\r\nThis course of reasoning implies that the sole objection to the United\r\nStates legislating for foreign nations is, that they makes treaties with\r\nthem: whereas there are several other good and sufficient objections\r\nthereto. It also implies that the sole consideration for the United\r\nStates treating with Indian tribes, called by Chief-Justice Marshall\r\n\"domestic dependent nations,\" is, that they cannot legislate for them:\r\nwhereas the real consideration has been one of practical convenience,\r\nnot of legislative competence.\r\n\r\nWe shall best set forth the constitutional relations of this subject by\r\npresenting the premises, whether of fact or of law, upon which all the\r\njudicial decisions relative thereto have been founded.\r\n\r\n1. As matter of fact, the European powers engaged in the discovery and\r\nconquest of the New World left with the Indian tribes the regulation of\r\ntheir own domestic concerns, while claiming the sovereignty of the soil\r\noccupied by them. The Indian tribes thus continued to act as separate\r\npolitical communities.[O]\r\n\r\n2. The Constitution of the United States excludes from the basis of\r\nCongressional representation \"Indians not taxed,\" without further\r\ndefining the same.\r\n\r\n3. The Congress of the United States has, with a few recent exceptions,\r\ntreated Indians in tribal relations as without the municipal\r\njurisdiction of the United States.\r\n\r\n4. The Senate of the United States has confirmed nearly four hundred\r\ntreaties, negotiated by the executive, under the general treaty-making\r\npowers conferred by the Constitution, with tribes which embrace about\r\nthree-fifths of the present Indian population of the United States. The\r\nHouse of Representatives has, from the foundation of the government, as\r\noccasion required, originated bills for the appropriation of moneys to\r\ncarry out the provisions of such treaties.\r\n\r\nThis comprises all that is essential in this connection. The _indicia_\r\ngathered from particular acts of the government, or from the phraseology\r\nof individual treaties, really add nothing to the above.\r\n\r\nWe believe the following propositions to be consistent with the facts of\r\nhistory and with the latest judicial decisions.\r\n\r\n1. The exclusion by the Constitution of \"Indians not taxed\" from the\r\nbasis of representation was in no sense a guaranty to the Indian tribes\r\nof their political autonomy, but was a provision in the interest of an\r\nequitable apportionment of political power among the States, some States\r\nhaving many Indians within their limits, others few or none.\r\n\r\n2. The self-government enjoyed by the Indian tribes under the\r\nConstitution of the United States, as under the European powers, has\r\nalways been a government by sufferance, by toleration, by permission.\r\nThe United States, for their own convenience, have allowed this\r\nself-government, because to reduce the savages to the condition of\r\nsubmitting to civilized laws would have involved a great expense of\r\nblood and treasure; while through the tribal organization a much better\r\ngovernment, for the purposes of the civilized power if not for the\r\nwelfare of the Indians themselves, could be obtained, than through an\r\nadministration which should disregard that organization. But this\r\ntoleration of savage self-government worked no prejudice to the\r\nsovereignty of the United States.\r\n\r\n3. The decay of a tribe in numbers and in cohesion, no matter to what\r\nextent carried, does not bring the members of such tribe within the\r\nmunicipal jurisdiction of the State wherein they are found, so long as\r\nthe tribal organization continues to be recognized by the National\r\nGovernment. See the Kansas Indians, 5 Wallace, 737.\r\n\r\n4. Congress is constitutionally competent to extend the laws of the\r\nUnited States at once over every Indian tribe within the Territories, if\r\nnot within the States of the Union, even though treaties may guarantee\r\nto individual tribes complete and perpetual political independence; the\r\nbreach of faith involved in the latter case being matter for possible\r\nconscientious scruples on the part of legislators, not for judicial\r\ncognizance. See 11 Wallace, 616; 2 Curtis, 454; 1 Woolworth, 155.\r\n\r\nWe have thought it important thus to review the doctrine of the Report\r\nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, because, from the high standing of\r\nthe Committee, from the assumption which the Report[P] makes of\r\ncompleteness in the citation of \"treaties, laws, and judicial\r\ndecisions\" pertinent to the subject, on the express ground of a desire\r\nto enlighten, not only Congress, but the country, in respect to our\r\nIndian relations, and from the wide circulation given to the Report, as\r\ncompared with that obtained by an ordinary decision of the Circuit or\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, the Report has apparently come to be\r\naccepted by Congress and the country as an authoritative exposition of\r\nthe history and law of the subject although, in the very month in which\r\nit was submitted to Congress, the Supreme Court, in the Cherokee\r\nTobacco, pronounced a doctrine which cuts up that of the Report, root\r\nand branch.\r\n\r\nSuch being the constitutional competence of Congress to deal with the\r\nIndians, without restraint either from the self-government hitherto\r\npermitted them, or from treaties to which the United States are a party,\r\nit is for Congress to decide, firstly, what the good faith of the nation\r\nrequires, and, secondly, what course will best accomplish the social and\r\nindustrial elevation of the native tribes, with due consideration had\r\nfor the interests of the present body of citizens.\r\n\r\nHow, then, stands the matter with the faith of the nation? By the Report\r\non Indian Affairs for 1872, there appear (p. 16) to be in the\r\nneighborhood of 120,000 Indians with whom the United States have no\r\ntreaty relations. These certainly can have no claims to exemption from\r\ndirect control, whenever the United States shall see fit to extend its\r\nlaws over them, either to incorporate them in the body of its\r\ncitizenship, or to seclude them for their own good. There are, again, as\r\nnearly as we can determine by a comparison of treaties with the Reports\r\nof the Indian Office, about 125,000 Indians with whom the United States\r\nhave treaties unexpired, but to whom no distinct guaranty or promise of\r\nautonomy has been made. Examination of these treaties reveals nothing\r\nwhich should prevent the United States from establishing a magistracy\r\nand a code of laws for the government of these tribes, according to\r\nprinciples suited to their present condition, yet tending to raise them\r\nto a higher social and industrial condition. On the other hand, the\r\nperpetual interdiction of all white persons upon the reservations of\r\nthese tribes, except \"such officers, agents, and employees of the\r\ngovernment as may be authorized to enter upon Indian reservations in\r\ndischarge of duties enjoined by law,\" would seem to preclude the\r\npossibility of these regions ever being opened to settlement, and the\r\nIndians thereon resolved into the body of citizens on equal terms. But,\r\nas matter of fact, not even such treaty provisions need, with\r\nintelligent and firm but kindly management, greatly or long embarrass\r\nthe government in the adjustment of the Indian question according to\r\neither principle which may be adopted, seclusion or citizenship. Few of\r\nthese tribes but are obliged, even now, to seek from the United States\r\nmore aid than they are entitled to by treaty; while it is certain that\r\nin the near future most, if not all, will be thrown in comparative\r\nhelplessness upon our bounty. The United States being the sole party to\r\nwhich they can cede their lands (8 Wheaton, 543), and the sale of the\r\ngreat body of these lands being their only resource, the government\r\nwill have the opportunity, not only without fraud or wrong to this\r\npeople, but for their highest good, and indeed for their salvation from\r\nthe doom otherwise awaiting them, to cancel the whole of these\r\nill-considered treaties, leaving the natives where they ought to\r\nbe,--subject to direct control by Congress. We repeat, there need never\r\nbe any difficulty in securing, at the right time and in the right way,\r\nthe relinquishment of lands or privileges from the Indians. They are,\r\nunfortunately, only too ready to sacrifice the future to present\r\nindulgence; while the government on its part can always afford to pay\r\nthem far more for their lands than their lands are worth to them. Under\r\nthis relation of the parties in interest, and with the pressure of\r\nactual want, due to the inability of the natives properly to cultivate\r\nwhat they possess, the United States may at an early date, with good\r\nfaith and judicious management, easily secure the relinquishment of\r\nevery franchise that stands in the way of a satisfactory adjustment of\r\nthe difficulty.\r\n\r\nThere is still a third body of Indians, about 55,000 in number,\r\noccupying chiefly the regions known as the Indian Territory, and\r\nrepresenting the tribes which were the subjects of the colonization\r\npolicy of Pres. Monroe, to whom the United States have plighted their\r\nfaith that no foreign authority shall ever be extended over them without\r\ntheir consent. These are not beggarly and vagabond Indians, to whom the\r\noffer of subsistence would be sufficient to obtain the relinquishment of\r\ntheir franchises, or the cession of their lands. They are\r\nself-supporting, independent, and even wealthy. Their cereal crops\r\nexceed those of all the Territories of the United States combined. In\r\nthe number and value of horses and cattle, they are surpassed by the\r\npeople of but one Territory; in expenditures for education, by the\r\npeople of no Territory.[Q] If these people ever relinquish their\r\nautonomy, it will be because they desire the privileges of American\r\ncitizens. This may well be in the immediate future, and surely will be,\r\nsooner or later, unless they are made to fear the violence and greed of\r\ntheir white neighbors. Meanwhile, they should be honorably protected in\r\nthe enjoyment of their treaty rights. They have already advanced so far\r\nin civilization as to secure their own future, as against any thing but\r\nsquatter and railroad rapacity; and their fate does not properly form a\r\npart of the Indian problem of the present day.\r\n\r\nExcepting thus the present inhabitants of the so-called Indian\r\nTerritory, who ought to be excepted from any scheme that embraces the\r\nhalf-civilized and the wholly savage tribes, we have practically a clear\r\nfield for any policy which Congress shall determine to be best suited to\r\nthe serious exigency of the situation; for, however easy to dismiss the\r\nsubject for a time with ridicule, the task of so disposing a nomad\r\npopulation of 200,000 to 240,000, as to reduce to a minimum the\r\nobstruction it shall offer to the progress of settlement and of\r\nindustry, without leaving the germs of lasting evil to a score of future\r\nStates, and at the same time to secure the highest welfare of that\r\npopulation,--this task is a most serious one, to which the best\r\nstatesmanship of the nation may well address itself.\r\n\r\nIn characterizing the classes of persons who will naturally be found\r\namong the advocates of the policy of an immediate bestowal of\r\ncitizenship upon the Indian tribes, whether they be willing or\r\nunwilling, whether for good or evil, we have in effect stated all the\r\narguments in favor of that policy; for it is not probable, that, aside\r\nfrom those who would properly be placed under one or another of the\r\nclasses indicated, there are a score of persons reasonably well informed\r\nin Indian affairs, who would so much as affect to believe that such a\r\ncourse would have other than disastrous consequences to the natives.\r\n\r\nThe considerations which favor the policy of seclusion with more or less\r\nof industrial constraint are so direct and familiar, and are sustained\r\nby so general a concurrence of testimony and authority, that they will\r\nnot require us greatly to protract this paper in their exposition and\r\nenforcement. These considerations are four in number; three of them\r\nhaving especial reference to the interests of the Indians, the fourth\r\nbearing on the welfare of the States to be formed out of the territory\r\nnow roamed over by the native tribes.\r\n\r\nFirst: so long as an Indian tribe is left to its own proper forces and\r\ndispositions, free from all foreign attraction, it is not only easily\r\ngoverned, but the whole body obeys the recognized law of the community\r\nwith almost absolute unanimity. No expressions would be too strong to\r\ncharacterize the social homogeneity of an Indian tribe, and the complete\r\ndomination of the accepted ideas of right and wrong, of honor and\r\nbaseness. Public opinion is there conclusive upon every individual; and\r\nthe spectacle, seen in every town and village with us, of large numbers\r\nopenly practising that which public opinion reprobates, or refusing to\r\ndo that which public opinion prescribes, is wholly unknown. We do not\r\nsay that this is the most desirable as the ultimate form of society; but\r\nthis tyranny of sentiment may and should be made a most powerful\r\nauxiliary for good in the early stages of industrial and social progress\r\nfor this people.\r\n\r\nSecond: it is unfortunately true, that, when the Indian is, by the\r\npowerful attraction of a race which his savage breast never fails to\r\nrecognize as superior, released from the control of the public\r\nsentiment which he has been accustomed to obey, he submits himself by\r\nan almost irresistible tendency to the worst and not to the best\r\ninfluences of civilized society. While there are undeniably exceptions\r\nto this statement, it is supported by such a mass of melancholy evidence\r\nin the history of scores of tribes once renowned for all the native\r\nvirtues, that no one has the right to advocate the introduction to such\r\ninfluences of uninstructed and unprovided tribes, unless he is prepared\r\nto contemplate the ruin of nine-tenths of the subjects of his policy.\r\n\r\nNor is it the worst elements of the Indian which thus submit themselves\r\nto the worst elements of the white community. The very men who bear\r\nthemselves most loftily, according to the native standards of virtue,\r\nare quite as likely to fall, under exposure to white contact, as are the\r\nweakest of the tribe. Their familiar attractions all broken, their\r\nimmemorial traditions rudely dispelled, their natural leadership\r\ndestroyed, the members of a wild tribe, strong and weak together, become\r\nthe easy prey of the rascally influences of civilized society.\r\n\r\nThird: the experiment of citizenship, except with the more advanced\r\ntribes, is at the serious risk, amounting almost to a certainty, of the\r\nimmediate loss to the Indians of the whole of their scanty patrimony,\r\nthrough the improvident and wasteful alienation of the lands patented to\r\nthem, the Indians being left thus without resource for the future,\r\nexcept in the bounty of the general government or in local charity. On\r\nthis point a few facts will be more eloquent than many words.\r\n\r\nThe United States have by recent treaties or legislative enactments\r\nadmitted to citizenship the following Indians,--In Kansas, Kickapoos,\r\n12; Delawares, 20; Wyandots, 473; Pottawatomies, 1,604: in Dakota,\r\nSioux, 250: in Minnesota, Winnebagoes, 159: in Wisconsin, Stockbridges,\r\nto a number not yet officially ascertained: in Michigan, Ottawas and\r\nChippewas, 6,039: in the Indian Territory, Ottawas of Blanchard's Fork,\r\n150. Time has not yet been given for the full development of the\r\nconsequences of thus devolving responsibility upon these Indians; but we\r\nalready have information, official or semi-official, to the effect that\r\nthe majority of the Pottawatomie citizens, after selling their lands in\r\nKansas, have gone to the Indian Territory, and re-associated themselves\r\nas a tribe; that of the Wyandots, considerable numbers have attached\r\nthemselves to the re-organized tribe in the Indian Territory; that of\r\nthe citizen Ottawas of Blanchard's Fork, nearly all have disposed of\r\ntheir allotted lands, and are still cared for to some extent by the\r\ngovernment as Indians; that of the Ottawas and Chippewas of Michigan, a\r\nmajority certainly, and probably a large majority, have sold the lands\r\npatented to them in severalty,--in many cases the negotiation preceding\r\nthe issue of patents, two parties of white sharpers contesting for the\r\nfavor of the agent, in the way of early information as to the precise\r\nlands assigned, and the disappointed faction, in at least one instance,\r\nresorting to burglary and larceny for the needed documents.\r\n\r\nIt will be thus seen, that, of these Indians upon whom the experiment of\r\ncitizenship has been tried, more than half, probably at least\r\ntwo-thirds, are now homeless, and must be re-endowed by the government,\r\nor they will sink to a condition of hopeless poverty and misery.\r\n\r\nFourth: the dissolution of the tribal bonds, and the dispersing of two\r\nhundred thousand Indians among the settlements, will devolve upon the\r\npresent and future States beyond the Missouri an almost intolerable\r\nburden of vagabondage, pauperism, and crime. It is not even essential to\r\nthe result of a dispersion of these tribes that the law should pronounce\r\ntheir dissolution as political communities. Unless the system of\r\nreservations shall soon be recast, and the laws of non-intercourse\r\nthoroughly enforced, the next fifteen or twenty years will see the great\r\nmajority of the Indians on the plains mixed up with white settlements,\r\nwandering in small camps from place to place, shifting sores upon the\r\npublic body, the men resorting for a living to basket-making, beggary,\r\nand hog-stealing, the women to fortune-telling, beggary, and harlotry;\r\nwhile a remnant will seek to maintain a little longer, in the mountains,\r\ntheir savage independence, fleeing before the advance of settlement when\r\nthey can, fighting in sullen despair when they must. It is doubtless\r\ntrue that some tribes could still remain together as social, even after\r\nbeing dissolved as legal, communities; but the fate we have indicated\r\nwould certainly befall by far the greater part of the Indians of the\r\nplains, were the reservation system broken up in their present social\r\nand industrial condition. To believe that a pioneer population of two,\r\nthree, or four millions, such as is likely to occupy this region within\r\nthe next twenty years, can, in addition to its own proper elements of\r\ndisorder, safely absorb such a mass of corruption, requires no small\r\nfaith in the robust virtue of our people, and in the saving efficacy of\r\nrepublican institutions.\r\n\r\nThis last consideration we have urged, not on behalf of the Indians, but\r\nin the interest of the present white communities beyond the Missouri, to\r\nwhom such a dispersion of the tribes would be a far greater burden than\r\nthe maintenance of the reservation system in its integrity could\r\npossibly be, and in the interest of a score of States of the Union yet\r\nto be formed out of that territory. Surely it is not in such cement that\r\nwe wish to have the foundations of our future society laid.\r\n\r\nWe conclude, then, that Indian citizenship is to be regarded as an end,\r\nand not as a means; that it is the goal to which each tribe should in\r\nturn be conducted, through a course of industrial instruction and\r\nconstraint, maintained by the government with kindness but also with\r\nfirmness, under the shield of the reservation system. It is true that\r\nthis system can no longer be kept up without sacrifice on our part. In\r\nthe days of Pres. Monroe, the sequestration of the Indians involved\r\nonly the expense of transporting eighty or ninety thousand persons to a\r\nregion not settled, nor then desired for settlement. To-day there is no\r\nportion of our territory where citizens of the United States are not\r\npreparing to make their homes. To cut off a reservation sufficient for\r\nthe wants of this unfortunate people in their rude ways of life; to\r\nhedge it in with strict laws of non-intercourse, turning aside, for the\r\npurpose, railway and highway alike; and, upon the soil thus secluded, to\r\nwork patiently out the problem of Indian civilization,--is not to be\r\ndeemed a light sacrifice to national honor and duty. Yet that the\r\ngovernment and people of the United States cannot discharge their\r\nobligations to the aborigines without pains and care and expense,\r\naffords no reason for declining the task.\r\n\r\nThe claim of the Indian upon us is of no common character. The advance\r\nof railways and settlements is fast pushing him from his home, and, in\r\nthe steady extinction of game, is cutting him off from the only means of\r\nsubsistence of which he knows how to avail himself. He will soon be left\r\nhomeless and helpless in the midst of civilization, upon the soil that\r\nonce was his alone. The freedom of territorial and industrial expansion\r\nwhich is bringing imperial greatness to the nation, to the Indian\r\nbrings wretchedness, destitution, beggary. Surely there is obligation\r\nfound, in such considerations as these, to make good in some way to him\r\nthe loss by which we so largely gain. Nor is this obligation one that\r\ncan be discharged by lavish endowments, which it is of moral certainty\r\nhe will squander, or by merely placing him in situations where he might\r\nprosper, had he the industrial aptitudes of the white man, acquired\r\nthrough centuries of laborious training. Savage as he is by no fault of\r\nhis own, and stripped at once of savage independence and savage\r\ncompetence by our act, for our advantage, we have made ourselves\r\nresponsible before God and the world for his rescue from destruction,\r\nand his elevation to social and industrial manhood, at whatever expense\r\nand at whatever inconvenience. The corner-stone of our Indian policy\r\nshould be the recognition by government and by the people, that we owe\r\nthe Indian, not endowments and lands only, but also forbearance,\r\npatience, care, and instruction.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual to sneer at the sentimentality of \"the Quakers\" and\r\nother active friends of this race. But we may as well remember that\r\nposterity will grow much more sentimental over the fate of the Indian\r\nthan any Quaker or philanthropist of to-day. The United States will be\r\njudged at the bar of history according to what they shall have done in\r\ntwo respects,--by their disposition of negro slavery, and by their\r\ntreatment of the Indians. In the one matter, the result is fortunately\r\nsecure; nor will it be remembered against us, in diminution of our\r\nhonor, that we procrastinated and sought to evade the issue, and for a\r\ntime made terms and compromised with wrong. In that, when at last we\r\nwere brought face to face with the question, we did the one thing that\r\nwas right, and in tears and blood expiated our own and our fathers'\r\nerrors, the ages to come will give us no grudging and stinted praise.\r\nWould that we were equally sure that no stain will rest upon our fame\r\nfor what shall yet be done or left undone towards the original\r\npossessors of our soil! What is past cannot be recalled; nor has any\r\nthing yet gone into history that need deeply dishonor us as a nation.\r\nPosterity will judge very leniently of all that has been done in heat of\r\nblood, in the struggle for life and for the possession of the soil by\r\nthe early Colonists; it will not greatly attribute blame that, in our\r\nindustrial and territorial expansion, and a conquest of savage nature\r\nmore rapid than is recorded of any other people, savage man has suffered\r\nsomewhat at our hands; it will not attempt nicely to apportion the\r\nmutual injuries of the frontier, to decide which was first and which was\r\nworst in wrong, red man or white; it will have ample consideration for\r\nthe difficulties which the government has encountered in preserving the\r\npeace between the natives and the bold, rude pioneers of civilization.\r\nBut if, when the Indians shall have been thrown helpless upon our mercy,\r\nsurrounded and disarmed by the extension of settlement, and impoverished\r\nby the very causes which promote our wealth and greatness, we fail to\r\nmake ample provision out of our abundance, and to apply it in all\r\npatience and with all pains, to save alive these remnants of a once\r\npowerful people, and reconcile them to civilization, there is much\r\nreason to fear, that, however successfully we may excuse ourselves to\r\nourselves by pleading the manifest destiny of the Anglo-Saxon race,\r\nimpartial history will pronounce us recreant to a sacred duty.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[K] From The International Review, May, 1874.\r\n\r\n[L] The doctrine of a _vanishing_ Indian nationality was strongly\r\ninsisted on by Mr. Justice McLean in his opinion in Worcester vs. the\r\nState of Georgia:--\r\n\r\n\"If a tribe of Indians shall become so degraded or reduced in numbers as\r\nto lose the power of self-government, the protection of the local law,\r\nof necessity, must be extended over them. The point at which this\r\nexercise of power by a State would be proper need not now be considered,\r\nif, indeed, it be a judicial question.... But, if a contingency shall\r\noccur which shall render the Indians who reside in a State incapable of\r\nself-government, either by moral degradation or a reduction of their\r\nnumbers, it would undoubtedly be in the power of a State government to\r\nextend over them the aegis of its laws.\"--6 _Peters_, pp. 593-4.\r\n\r\nIf, as would appear, Mr. Justice McLean by this intends that a State may\r\nexercise such discretion so long as the United States continue to\r\nrecognize the tribal organization, however feeble or corrupt it may in\r\nfact be, the doctrine is flatly contradicted by that of the Supreme\r\nCourt in the Kansas Indians.--5 _Wallace_, 737.\r\n\r\n[M] We are aware that this is a heavy charge; but it is justified by the\r\nfacts. The recital is incomplete. The decision in the United States\r\n_vs._ Rogers is not referred to. This case is, as it was treated by the\r\nSupreme Court in the Cherokee Tobacco, of the highest importance.\r\n\r\nThe recital is inaccurate. An opinion is given at length as that of Kent\r\nin Jackson vs. Goodell, 20 Johnson, 193. This is a case in the Supreme\r\nCourt of New York, Chief-Justice Spencer delivering the opinion, Kent\r\nhaving been previously appointed chancellor. The expressions quoted by\r\nthe Committee are to be found in Goodell vs. Jackson, in error to the\r\nCourt of Appeals, 20 Johnson, 693. The recital is inconsequential, as\r\nwill appear by what is said further in the text.\r\n\r\n[N] \"We think it too firmly and clearly established to admit of dispute,\r\nthat the Indian tribes residing within the territorial limits of the\r\nUnited States are subject to their authority; and where the country\r\noccupied by them is not within the limit of one of the States, Congress\r\nmay by law punish any offence committed there, whether the offender be a\r\nwhite man or an Indian.\"--_Taney, Chief-Justice._\r\n\r\nIn the Cherokee Tobacco, the court, quoting from Chief-Justice Taney the\r\nsentence just preceding, and a similar utterance of Chief-Justice\r\nMarshall, remarks, \"Both these propositions are so well settled in our\r\njurisprudence, that it would be a waste of time to discuss them, or to\r\nrefer to further authorities in their support.\"\r\n\r\n[O] Throughout the whole course of this discussion on the constitutional\r\nrelations of the Indians, we should indicate as subject to possible\r\nexception the tribes found upon soil ceded by Mexico. It is claimed,\r\nthat, as Mexico never treated the Indians within its jurisdiction other\r\nthan as a peculiar class of citizens, all the members of those tribes\r\nbecame citizens of the United States by virtue of the provisions of the\r\nTreaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, 1848.\r\n\r\n[P] \"Although the Committee have not regarded the questions proposed for\r\ntheir consideration by this resolution as at all difficult to answer,\r\nyet respect for the Senate, which ordered the investigation, and the\r\nexistence of some loose popular notions of modern date in regard to the\r\npower of the President and Senate to exercise the treaty-making power in\r\ndealing with the Indian tribes, have induced your Committee to examine\r\nthe questions thus at length, and present extracts from treaties, laws,\r\nand judicial decisions; and your Committee indulge the hope that a\r\nreference to these sources of information may tend to fix more clearly\r\nin the minds of Congress and the people the true theory of our relations\r\nto these unfortunate tribes.\"--_Report_, p. 11. It would, perhaps, have\r\nbeen fortunate had the Committee found the questions difficult.\r\n\r\n[Q] See Annual Report, Board of Indian Commissioners, 1872, p. 12.\r\n\r\nConstant efforts are made to break the force of such comparisons as\r\nthese, by asserting that the progress of the Indian Territory in\r\nindustry and the arts of life is due to white men incorporated with the\r\nCreeks, Cherokees, and Choctaws. If this be true, it would seem that\r\nwhite men, when brought under Indian laws, and adopted into Indian\r\nfamilies, exhibit qualities superior to those which they develop when\r\ncontrolling themselves, and organizing their own forms of industry and\r\nof government. This suggests the inquiry, whether it might not be well\r\nto turn over two or three Territories that might be named, to the\r\nIndians, with liberty to pick out white men for adoption and for\r\ninstruction, in the hope that these communities might in time be brought\r\nup to the condition of that of which the Indians have had sole control\r\nfor forty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT\r\n\r\nOF THE NUMBERS, LOCATION, AND SOCIAL, AND\r\nINDUSTRIAL CONDITION OF EACH IMPORTANT\r\nTRIBE AND BAND OF INDIANS\r\nWITHIN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n[From the report of Francis A. Walker, U. S. Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs, for the year 1872.]\r\n\r\nThe Indians within the limits of the United States, exclusive of those\r\nin Alaska, number, approximately, 300,000.\r\n\r\n(_a_) They may be divided, according to their geographical location or\r\nrange, into five grand divisions, as follows: in Minnesota, and States\r\neast of the Mississippi River, about 32,500; in Nebraska, Kansas, and\r\nthe Indian Territory, 70,650; in the Territories of Dakota, Montana,\r\nWyoming, and Idaho, 65,000; in Nevada, and the Territories of Colorado,\r\nNew Mexico, Utah, and Arizona, 84,000; and on the Pacific slope,\r\n48,000.\r\n\r\n(_b_) In respect to the three lines of railroads--built or\r\nprojected--between the States and the Pacific Ocean, viz., the northern,\r\ncentral, and southern routes, they may be divided, excluding those\r\nresiding east of Minnesota and of the Missouri River south of Dakota, as\r\nfollows: between the proposed northern route and the British\r\nPossessions, about 36,000; between the northern and central routes,\r\n92,000; between the central and the proposed southern routes, 61,000;\r\nand between the southern route and Mexico, 85,000: making a total of\r\n274,000.\r\n\r\n(_c_) As regards their means of support and methods of subsistence, they\r\nmay be divided as follows: those who support themselves upon their own\r\nreservations, receiving nothing from the government except interest on\r\ntheir own moneys, or annuities granted them in consideration of the\r\ncession of their lands to the United States, number about 130,000; those\r\nwho are entirely subsisted by the government, about 31,000; those in\r\npart subsisted, 84,000,--together about 115,000; those who subsist by\r\nhunting and fishing, upon roots, nuts, berries, &c., or by begging and\r\nstealing, about 55,000.\r\n\r\n(_d_) They may be divided again, with respect to their connection with\r\nthe government, as follows: there are about 150,000 who may be said to\r\nremain constantly upon their reservations, and are under the complete\r\ncontrol of agents appointed by the government; 95,000 who at times visit\r\ntheir agencies either for food or for gossip, or for both, but are\r\ngenerally roaming either on or off their reservations, engaged in\r\nhunting or fishing; and 55,000 who never visit an agency, and over whom\r\nthe government as yet exercises practically no control, but most of whom\r\nare inoffensive, and commit no acts of hostility against the government.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Again: it may be said, that, of the 300,000 Indians of the\r\ncountry, about 180,000 have treaties with the government; 40,000 have no\r\ntreaties with the United States, but have reservations set apart by\r\nexecutive order or otherwise for their occupancy, and are in charge of\r\nagents appointed by the government; 25,000 have no reservations, but are\r\nmore or less under the control of agents appointed for them, and receive\r\nmore or less assistance from the government; the remainder consisting of\r\nthe same 55,000 already twice described, over whom the government\r\nexercises, practically, no control, and for whom there are no treaty or\r\nother provisions.\r\n\r\n(_f_) As to civilization, they may, though with no great degree of\r\nassurance, be divided, according to a standard taken with reasonable\r\nreference to what might fairly be expected of a race with such\r\nantecedents and traditions, as follows: civilized, 97,000;\r\nsemi-civilized, 125,000; wholly barbarous, 78,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA, AND EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of New York, remnants of the once powerful \"Six Nations,\"\r\nnumber five thousand and seventy. They occupy six reservations in the\r\nState, containing in the aggregate 68,668 acres. Two of these\r\nreservations, viz., the Alleghany and Cattaraugus, belonged originally\r\nto the Colony of Massachusetts, but by sale and assignment passed into\r\nthe hands of a company, the Indians holding a perpetual right of\r\noccupancy, and the company referred to, or the individual members\r\nthereof, owning the ultimate fee. The same state of facts formerly\r\nexisted in regard to the Tonawanda reserve; but the Indians who occupy\r\nit have purchased the ultimate fee of a portion of the reserve, which is\r\nnow held in trust for them by the Secretary of the Interior. The State\r\nof New York exercises sovereignty over these reservations. The\r\nreservations occupied by the Oneidas, Onondagas, and Tuscaroras, have\r\nbeen provided for by treaty stipulations between the Indians and the\r\nState of New York. All six reserves are held and occupied by the Indians\r\nin common. While the Indian tribes of the continent, with few\r\nexceptions, have been steadily decreasing in numbers, those of New York\r\nhave of late more than held their own, as is shown by an increase of one\r\nhundred in the present reports over the reported number in 1871, and of\r\nthirteen hundred over the number embraced in the United-States census of\r\n1860. On the New-York reservations are twenty-eight schools; the\r\nattendance during some portions of the past year exceeding eleven\r\nhundred, the daily average attendance being six hundred and eight. Of\r\nthe teachers employed, fifteen are Indians, as fully competent for this\r\nposition as their white associates. An indication of what is to be\r\naccomplished in the future, in an educational point of view, is found in\r\nthe successful effort made in August last to establish a teacher's\r\ninstitute on the Cattaraugus reservation for the education of teachers\r\nspecially for Indian schools. Thirty-eight applicants attended; and\r\ntwenty-six are now under training. The statistics of individual wealth\r\nand of the aggregate product of agricultural and other industry are, in\r\ngeneral, favorable; and a considerable increase in these regards is\r\nobserved from year to year. Twenty thousand acres are under cultivation:\r\nthe cereal crops are good; while noticeable success has been achieved in\r\nthe raising of fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMICHIGAN.\r\n\r\nThe bands or tribes residing in Michigan are the Chippewas of Saginaw,\r\nSwan Creek, and Black River; the Ottawas and Chippewas; the\r\nPottawatomies of Huron; and the L'Anse band of Chippewas.\r\n\r\n_The Chippewas_ of Saginaw, Swan Creek, and Black River, numbering\r\nsixteen hundred and thirty, and the Ottawas and Chippewas, six thousand\r\nand thirty-nine, are indigenous to the country. They are well advanced\r\nin civilization; have, with few exceptions, been allotted lands under\r\ntreaty provisions, for which they have received patents; and are now\r\nentitled to all the privileges and benefits of citizens of the United\r\nStates. Those to whom no allotments have been made can secure homesteads\r\nunder the provisions of the act of June 10, 1872. All treaty\r\nstipulations with these Indians have expired. They now have no money or\r\nother annuities paid to them by the United States Government. The three\r\ntribes first named have in all four schools, with one hundred and\r\nfifteen scholars; and the last, two schools, with one hundred and\r\nfifty-two scholars.\r\n\r\n_The Pottawatomies_ of Huron number about fifty.\r\n\r\n_The L'Anse_ band of Chippewas, numbering eleven hundred and\r\nninety-five, belong with the other bands of the Chippewas of Lake\r\nSuperior. They occupy a reservation of about forty-eight thousand three\r\nhundred acres, situated on Lake Superior, in the extreme northern part\r\nof the State. But few of them are engaged in agriculture, most of them\r\ndepending for their subsistence on hunting and fishing. They have two\r\nschools, with an attendance of fifty-six scholars.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Indians of Michigan in civilization and industry has\r\nbeen greatly hindered in the past by a feeling of uncertainty in regard\r\nto their permanent possession and enjoyment of their homes. Since the\r\nallotment of land, and the distribution of either patents or homestead\r\ncertificates to these Indians (the L'Anse or Lake Superior Chippewas, a\r\npeople of hunting and fishing habits, excepted), a marked improvement\r\nhas been manifested on their part in regard to breaking land and\r\nbuilding houses. The aggregate quantity of land cultivated by the\r\nseveral tribes is eleven thousand six hundred and twenty acres; corn,\r\noats, and wheat being the chief products. The dwellings occupied consist\r\nof two hundred and forty-four frame and eight hundred and thirty-five\r\nlog houses. The aggregate population of the several tribes named\r\n(including the confederated \"Chippewas, Ottawas, and Pottawatomies,\"\r\nabout two hundred and fifty souls, with whom the government made a final\r\nsettlement in 1866 of its treaty obligations) is, by the report of their\r\nagent for the current year, nine thousand one hundred and seventeen,--an\r\nincrease over the number reported for 1871 of four hundred and two, due,\r\nhowever, perhaps as much to the return of absent Indians as to the\r\nexcess of births over deaths. In educational matters these Indians have,\r\nof late, most unfortunately, fallen short of the results of former\r\nyears; for the reason mainly that, their treaties expiring, the\r\nprovisions previously existing for educational uses failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nThe bands or tribes in Wisconsin are the Chippewas of Lake Superior, the\r\nMenomonees, the Stockbridges and Munsees, the Oneidas, and certain stray\r\nbands (so called) of Winnebagoes, Pottawatomies, and Chippewas.\r\n\r\n_The Chippewas_ of Lake Superior (under which head are included the\r\nfollowing bands: Fond du Lac, Boise Forte, Grand Portage, Red Cliff, Bad\r\nRiver, Lac de Flambeau, and Lac Court D'Oreille) number about five\r\nthousand one hundred and fifty. They constitute a part of the Ojibways\r\n(anglicized in the term Chippewas), formerly one of the most powerful\r\nand warlike nations in the north-west, embracing many bands, and ranging\r\nover an immense territory, extending along the shores of Lakes Huron,\r\nMichigan, and Superior, to the steppes of the Upper Mississippi. Of this\r\ngreat nation large numbers are still found in Minnesota, many in\r\nMichigan, and a fragment in Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe bands above mentioned by name are at present located on several\r\nsmall reservations set apart for them by treaties of Sept. 30, 1854, and\r\nApril 7, 1866, in Wisconsin and Minnesota, comprising in all about six\r\nhundred and ninety-five thousand two hundred and ninety acres. By act of\r\nCongress of May 29, 1872, provision was made for the sale, with the\r\nconsent of the Indians, of three of these reservations, viz., the Lac de\r\nFlambeau and Lac Court D'Oreille in Wisconsin, and the Fond du Lac in\r\nMinnesota; and for the removal of the Indians located thereon to the Bad\r\nRiver reservation, where there is plenty of good, arable land, and where\r\nthey can be properly cared for, and instructed in agriculture and\r\nmechanics.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of these Indians at present lead a somewhat roving\r\nlife, finding their subsistence chiefly in game hunted by them, in the\r\nrice gathered in its wild state, and in the fish afforded by waters\r\nconveniently near. Comparatively little is done in the way of\r\ncultivating the soil. Certain bands have of late been greatly\r\ndemoralized by contact with persons employed in the construction of the\r\nNorthern Pacific Railroad, the line of which runs near one (the Fond du\r\nLac) of their reservations. Portions of this people, however, especially\r\nthose situated at the Bad River reservation, have begun to evince an\r\nearnest desire for self-improvement. Many live in houses of rude\r\nconstruction, and raise small crops of grain and vegetables; others\r\nlabor among the whites; and a number find employment in cutting rails,\r\nfence-posts, and saw-logs for the government. In regard to the efforts\r\nmade to instruct the children in letters, it may be said, that, without\r\nbeing altogether fruitless, the results have been thus far meagre and\r\nsomewhat discouraging. The majority of the parents profess to wish to\r\nhave their children educated, and ask for schools; but, when the means\r\nare provided and the work undertaken, the difficulties in the way of\r\nsuccess to any considerable extent appear in the undisciplined character\r\nof the scholars, which has to be overcome by the teacher without\r\nparental co-operation, and in the great irregularity of attendance at\r\nschool, especially on the part of those who are obliged to accompany\r\ntheir parents to the rice-fields, the sugar-camps, or the\r\nfishing-grounds.\r\n\r\n_The Menomonees_ number thirteen hundred and sixty-two, and are located\r\non a reservation of two hundred and thirty thousand four hundred acres\r\nin the north-eastern part of Wisconsin. They formerly owned most of the\r\neastern portion of the State, and, by treaty entered into with the\r\ngovernment on the 18th October, 1848, ceded the same for a home in\r\nMinnesota upon lands that had been obtained by the United States from\r\nthe Chippewas; but, becoming dissatisfied with the arrangement, as not\r\nhaving accorded them what they claimed to be rightfully due,\r\nsubsequently protested, and manifested great unwillingness to remove. In\r\nview of this condition of affairs, they were, by the President,\r\npermitted to remain in Wisconsin, and temporarily located upon the lands\r\nthey now occupy, which were secured to them by a subsequent treaty made\r\nwith the tribe on the 12th May, 1854. This reservation is well watered\r\nby lakes and streams, the latter affording excellent power and\r\nfacilities for moving logs and lumber to market; the most of their\r\ncountry abounding with valuable pine timber. A considerable portion of\r\nthe Menomonees have made real and substantial advancement in\r\ncivilization; numbers of them are engaged in agriculture; others find\r\nremunerative employment in the lumbering camp established upon their\r\nreservation, under the management of the government agent, while a few\r\nstill return, at times, to their old pursuits of hunting and fishing.\r\n\r\nUnder the plan adopted by the department in 1871, in regard to cutting\r\nand selling the pine timber belonging to these Indians, 2,000,000 feet\r\nhave been cut and driven, realizing $23,731, of which individual\r\nIndians received for their labor over $3,000, the treasury of the tribe\r\nderiving a net profit of $5 per thousand feet. The agent estimates,\r\nthat, for labor done by the Indians upon the reservation, at lumbering,\r\nand for work outside on railroads, during the past year, about twenty\r\nthousand dollars has been earned and received, exclusive of the labor\r\nrendered in building houses, raising crops, making sugar, gathering\r\nrice, and hunting for peltries. The work of education upon the\r\nreservations has been of late quite unsatisfactory, but one small school\r\nbeing now in operation, with seventy scholars, the average attendance\r\nbeing fifty.\r\n\r\n_The Stockbridges and Munsees_, numbering two hundred and fifty, occupy\r\na reservation of sixty thousand eight hundred acres adjoining the\r\nMenomonees. The Stockbridges came originally from Massachusetts and New\r\nYork. After several removals they, with the Munsees, finally located on\r\ntheir present reservation. Under the provisions of the act of Feb. 6,\r\n1871, steps are now being taken to dispose of all of their reservation,\r\nwith the exception of eighteen sections best adapted for agricultural\r\npurposes, which are reserved for their future use. They have no treaty\r\nstipulations with the United States at the present time; nor do they\r\nreceive any annuities of any kind from the government. These\r\ntribes--indeed, it may be said this tribe (the Stockbridges); for of the\r\nMunsees there probably remain not more than a half a dozen souls--were\r\nformerly an intelligent, prosperous people, not a whit behind the most\r\nadvanced of the race, possessed of good farms, well instructed, and\r\nindustrious. Unfortunately for them, though much to the advantage of the\r\ngovernment, which acquired thereby a valuable tract of country for white\r\nsettlement, they removed, in 1857, to their present place of abode. The\r\nchange has proved highly detrimental to their interests and prospects.\r\nTheir new reservation, the greater part poor in soil and seriously\r\naffected by wet seasons and frequent frosts, has never yielded them more\r\nthan a meagre subsistence. Many have for this reason left the tribe, and\r\nhave been for years endeavoring to obtain a livelihood among the whites,\r\nmaintaining but little intercourse with those remaining on the\r\nreservation, yet still holding their rights in the tribal property. The\r\nresult has been bickerings and faction quarrels, prejudicial to the\r\npeace and advancement of the community. More than one-half of the\r\npresent membership of the tribe, from both the \"citizen\" and the\r\n\"Indian\" parties, into which it has been long divided, are reported by\r\nthe agent as having decided to avail themselves of the enrollment\r\nprovisions in the act of Congress of February, 1871, before referred to,\r\nby which they will finally receive their share of the tribal property,\r\nand become citizens of the United States. Those who desire to retain\r\ntheir tribal relation under the protection of the United States may,\r\nunder the act adverted to, if they so elect by their council, procure a\r\nnew location for their future home. The school interests and religious\r\ncare of this people are under the superintendence of Mr. Jeremiah\r\nSlingerland, a Stockbridge of much repute for his intelligence, and his\r\nsuccess in the cause of the moral and educational improvement of his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n_The Oneidas_, numbering twelve hundred and fifty-nine, have a\r\nreservation of 60,800 acres near Green Bay. They constitute the greater\r\nportion of the tribe of that name (derived from Lake Oneida, where the\r\ntribe then resided), formerly one of the \"Six Nations.\" Two hundred and\r\nfifty of the Oneidas yet remain in New York on the reservations already\r\ndescribed. Those who are found in Michigan are progressing in the arts\r\nof civilized life, many of them being intelligent, industrious, and ripe\r\nfor citizenship. The progress of those best disposed and most advanced\r\nis, however, retarded by the fact of the tribal lands being held in\r\ncommon, by which the incentive to individual exertion is greatly\r\nimpaired, and habits of industry and frugality discouraged. There are\r\nalso some members who fail to keep pace with the progress of the tribe,\r\nin part, probably, from the same cause which hinders the improvement of\r\nthose better disposed, but principally from that fatal curse of the\r\nIndian, the passion for intoxicating liquor, which is especially\r\ndeveloped among those members of the tribe who are engaged in lumbering.\r\n\r\nIt is now believed that a large majority of the tribe favor the division\r\nof their lands, and the allotment of parcels to families and\r\nindividuals,--a measure deemed to be of the first importance to the\r\nfuture welfare of this people, and which, it is suggested, should be the\r\nsubject of legislative action with a view to its consummation at the\r\nearliest practicable date. There are two schools for this tribe, having\r\non the rolls two hundred and seventeen scholars, the average attendance\r\nbeing ninety.\r\n\r\nThe stray bands of Winnebagoes, Chippewas, and Pottawatomies number\r\nabout sixteen hundred. They are scattered in small parties over the\r\ncentral and northern portions of the State, and are those members of the\r\ntribes named who did not remove when their respective tribes went west\r\nof the Mississippi. They receive no assistance from the government, and\r\nsubsist by cultivating small patches of corn and vegetables, by hunting,\r\nfishing, and gathering berries, and by working for the whites at certain\r\nseasons of the year. A number own a few acres: others rent small patches\r\nfrom the whites. They are accused of causing considerable annoyance to\r\nthe farmers in some localities; and, on account of complaints having\r\nbeen made in this respect, Congress has appropriated funds to remove\r\nthem to the tribes to which they respectively belong, or to some place\r\nin the Indian Territory south of Kansas. For various reasons their\r\nremoval has not yet been undertaken. Indeed, while this may be found\r\npracticable, I doubt whether it can be thoroughly accomplished without\r\nadditional and severe legislation on the part of Congress, as the\r\nIndians are attached to the country, and express great repugnance to\r\ntheir contemplated removal from it. On this account, and for the reason\r\nthat they cannot be supposed to feel much interest in those from whom\r\nthey have been so long separated, and by whom they might not be heartily\r\nwelcomed, it is probable that those who should be removed against their\r\nwill would return to their old haunts, and do the same as often as they\r\nshould be removed therefrom.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA.\r\n\r\nThe Indians residing within the limits of Minnesota, as in the case of\r\nthose of the same name living in Wisconsin, heretofore noticed,\r\nconstitute a portion of the Ojibway or Chippewa nation, and comprise the\r\nfollowing bands: Mississippi, Pillager, Winnebagoshish, Pembina, Red\r\nLake, Boise Forte, Fond du Lac, and Grand Portage. The last three bands,\r\nbeing attached to the agency for the Chippewas of Lake Superior, have\r\nbeen treated of in connection with the Indians of Wisconsin. The five\r\nfirst-named bands number in the aggregate about six thousand four\r\nhundred and fifty-five souls, and occupy, or rather it is intended they\r\nshall ultimately occupy, ample reservations in the central and northern\r\nportion of the State, known as the White Earth, Leech Lake, and Red Lake\r\nreservations, containing altogether about 4,672,000 acres, a portion of\r\nwhich is very valuable for its pine timber.\r\n\r\nThe condition of these Indians, except those upon the White Earth\r\nreservation, has been but little changed during the past year from that\r\nof several years preceding. Great difficulty is still experienced in\r\ninducing the Indians to remain permanently upon their reservations. A\r\nroving life is still preferred by many, their old haunts presenting more\r\nattractions for them than new homes with the unavoidable necessity of\r\nlabor for subsistence. Yet no inconsiderable number are already\r\nevidencing by their efforts, as well as by their professions, a new\r\nspirit of industry and enterprise. The past year has been one of trouble\r\nand unusual excitement on the part of both whites and Indians, on\r\naccount of the ill behavior of the Pillager band; and apprehensions of a\r\nserious outbreak were for a time entertained. Nine murders of citizens\r\nare reported to have been committed by individual Chippewas, mainly if\r\nnot wholly of this band; and threats were made on the part of some of\r\nthe Pillagers, which, if carried out, would have involved nearly all of\r\nthe Indians of this section in hostilities. Happily, by the prompt\r\narrival of United States troops upon the White Earth reservation, and\r\nmore especially by the strong disapprobation of the conduct of the\r\nPillagers expressed in council by the general body of Leech Lake\r\nIndians, and their evident purpose to unite with the government in\r\nputting down any and all enemies of the peace, the crisis was passed;\r\nand comparative quiet has again been restored. In view of the atrocities\r\ncommitted by the Pillagers, and of the alarm occasioned thereby among\r\nthe citizens of Minnesota, Gov. Austin issued a proclamation requiring\r\nall Indians to remain upon their reservations under penalty of arrest,\r\nto be effected by the militia of the State, should it be found\r\nnecessary. In the present condition of things, however, a compliance by\r\nall with this requirement is simply impossible; and there is danger,\r\nthat, without the exercise of great prudence and forbearance on the part\r\nof the State authorities, further and greater difficulties may arise.\r\nThe \"Otter Tail\" Pillagers, to whom the difficulties referred to are\r\nprincipally due, have the right to a home on the White Earth\r\nreservation. They removed to it in 1871; but, as they were not provided\r\nwith the means of opening farms, nor with subsistence during the time\r\nnecessary to raise a crop, they returned to their former haunts. They\r\nare now warned off from their grounds at Otter Tail by the State\r\nauthorities. The larger portion of the Pillagers, together with the\r\nWinnebagoshish band, about fifteen hundred in number, live around Leech\r\nLake. Their general reputation for turbulence and worthlessness of\r\ncharacter is well known and of long standing: still there are those who\r\nseem willing and ready to work if assisted by the government.\r\n\r\nAgent Smith, in charge, says that their country is barren, with only\r\nhere and there patches susceptible of tillage, accessible only by canoe\r\nor steamboat. In this connection, and adverting to the murders committed\r\nby the Pillagers, it is but just to notice that all lawlessness in\r\nMinnesota, in the region of the Indian reservations, is not confined to\r\nIndians. The murder of two Indians of the Otter Tail Pillagers, for the\r\noffence of camping on a white man's ground, is reported; while two\r\nothers, who had been arrested at White Earth on suspicion of complicity\r\nin a murder, and lodged in jail for trial, were taken therefrom by a\r\nmob, and hung. Such conduct can but have a pernicious effect upon the\r\nIndian mind, and tend to arouse a spirit of revenge and retaliation.\r\n\r\n_Mississippi bands._--These Indians reside in different localities. Most\r\nof them are on their reservation at White Earth: others are at Mille\r\nLac, Gull Lake, and some at White Oak Point reservations. Upon the\r\nfirst-named reservation operations have been quite extensive in the\r\nerection of school-buildings, dwelling-houses, shops, and mills, and in\r\nbreaking ground. At one time during the past summer there was a prospect\r\nof an abundant yield from 300 acres sown in cereals; but, unfortunately,\r\nthe grasshoppers swept away the entire crop; and a second crop of\r\nbuckwheat and turnips proved a failure. The Indians on this reservation\r\nare well-behaved, and inclined to be industrious. Many of them are\r\nengaged in tilling the soil, while others are learning the mechanical\r\narts; and they may, as a body, be said to be making considerable\r\nprogress in the pursuits of civilized life. About one-half of the\r\nIndians at Gull Lake have been removed to White Earth: the remainder are\r\nopposed to removal, and will, in their present feeling, rather forfeit\r\ntheir annuities than change their location. The Mille Lac Chippewas,\r\nwho continue to occupy the lands ceded by them in 1863, with reservation\r\nof the right to live thereon during good behavior, are indisposed to\r\nleave their old home for the new one designed for them on the White\r\nEarth reservation. Only about twenty-five have thus far been induced to\r\nremove. Their present reservation is rich in pine lands, the envy of\r\nlumber dealers; and there is a strong pressure on all sides for their\r\nearly removal. They should have help from the government, whether they\r\nremain or remove; and this could be afforded to a sufficient extent by\r\nthe sale for their benefit of the timber upon the lands now occupied by\r\nthem. Probably the government could provide for them in no better way.\r\n\r\n_The White Oak Point Chippewas_ were formerly known as Sandy Lake\r\nIndians. They were removed in 1867 from Sandy Lake and Rabbit Lake to\r\nWhite Oak Point on the Mississippi, near the eastern part of the Leech\r\nLake reservation. This location is unfavorable to their moral\r\nimprovement and material progress, from its proximity to the\r\nlumber-camps of the whites. Thus far the effort made to better their\r\ncondition, by placing them on farming land, has proved a failure. The\r\nground broken for them has gone back into grass; and their log-houses\r\nare in ruin, the former occupants betaking themselves to their wonted\r\nhaunts. It would be well if these Indians could be induced to remove to\r\nthe White Earth reservation.\r\n\r\nAt Red Lake the Indians have had a prosperous year: good crops of corn\r\nand potatoes have been raised, and a number of houses built. This band\r\nwould be in much better circumstances were they possessed of a greater\r\nquantity of arable lands. That to which they are at present limited\r\nallows but five acres, suitable for that use, to each family. It is\r\nproposed to sell their timber, and with the proceeds clear lands,\r\npurchase stock, and establish a manual-labor school.\r\n\r\n_The Pembina_ bands reside in Dakota Territory, but are here noticed in\r\nconnection with the Minnesota Indians, because of their being attached\r\nto the same agency. They have no reservation, having ceded their lands\r\nby treaty made in 1863, but claim title to Turtle Mountain in Dakota, on\r\nwhich some of them resided at the time of the treaty, and which lies\r\nwest of the line of the cession then made. They number, the full-bloods\r\nabout three hundred and fifty, and the half-breeds about one hundred.\r\nThey lead a somewhat nomadic life, depending upon the chase for a\r\nprecarious subsistence, in connection with an annuity from the\r\ngovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\n_The Chippewas_ of Minnesota have had but few educational advantages;\r\nbut with the facilities now being afforded, and with the earnest\r\nendeavors that are now being put forth by their agent and the teachers\r\nemployed, especially at White Earth, it is expected that their interests\r\nin this regard will be greatly promoted. At White Earth school\r\noperations have been quite successful; so much so, that it will require\r\nadditional accommodations to meet the demands of the Indians for the\r\neducation of their children. The only other school in operation is that\r\nat Red Lake, under the auspices of the American Indian Mission\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIANA.\r\n\r\nThere are now in Indiana about three hundred and forty-five Miamies, who\r\ndid not go to Kansas when the tribe moved to that section under the\r\ntreaty of 1840. They are good citizens, many being thrifty farmers,\r\ngiving no trouble either to their white neighbors or to the government.\r\nThere is also a small band called the Eel River band of Miamies,\r\nresiding in this State and in Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA, TENNESSEE, AND GEORGIA.\r\n\r\n_Cherokees._--There are residing in these States probably about\r\nseventeen hundred Cherokees, who elected to remain, under the provisions\r\nrespecting Cherokees averse to removal, contained in the twelfth article\r\nof the treaty with the Cherokees of 1835. Under the act of July 29,\r\n1848, a _per capita_ transportation and subsistence fund of $53.33 was\r\ncreated and set apart for their benefit in accordance with a census-roll\r\nmade under the provisions of said act, the interest on which fund until\r\nsuch time as they shall individually remove to the Indian country is the\r\nonly money to which those named in said roll, who are living, or the\r\nheirs of those who have deceased, are entitled. This interest is too\r\nsmall to be of any benefit; and some action should be taken by Congress,\r\nwith a view of having all business matters between these Indians and the\r\ngovernment settled, by removing such of them west as now desire to go,\r\nand paying those who decline to remove, the _per capita_ fund referred\r\nto. The government has no agent residing with these Indians. In\r\naccordance with their earnestly expressed desire to be brought under the\r\nimmediate charge of the government, as its wards, Congress, by law\r\napproved July 27, 1868, directed that the Secretary of the Interior\r\nshould cause the Commissioner of Indian Affairs to take the same\r\nsupervisory charge of them as of other tribes of Indians; but this\r\npractically amounts to nothing, in the absence of means to carry out the\r\nintention of the law with any beneficial result to the Indians. The\r\ncondition of this people is represented to be deplorable. Before the\r\nlate rebellion they were living in good circumstances, engaged, with all\r\nthe success which could be expected, in farming, and in various minor\r\nindustrial pursuits. Like all other inhabitants of this section, they\r\nsuffered much during the war, and are now from this and other causes\r\nmuch impoverished.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORIDA.\r\n\r\n_Seminoles._--There are a few Seminoles--supposed to number about three\r\nhundred--still residing in Florida, being those, or the descendants of\r\nthose, who refused to accompany the tribe when it removed to the west\r\nmany years ago. But little is known of their condition and temper.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA, KANSAS, AND THE INDIAN TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Nebraska, Kansas, and the Indian Territory are\r\ndivided as follows: in Nebraska about 6,485; in Kansas, 1,500; in the\r\nIndian Territory, 62,465.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in Nebraska are the Santee Sioux, Winnebagoes, Omahas,\r\nPawnees, Sacs and Foxes of the Missouri, Iowas, and the Otoes and\r\nMissourias.\r\n\r\n_The Santee Sioux_, now numbering nine hundred and sixty-five, a\r\ndecrease from last year of twenty-two, are a portion of the Sisseton,\r\nWahpeton, Medawakanton, and Wahpakoota bands of Sioux of the\r\nMississippi, belonging thus to the great Sioux or Dakota nation. They\r\nformerly, with other members of the same bands,--now located on\r\nreservations in Dakota, one at Devil's Lake in the north-east corner of\r\nthe Territory, and another at Lake Traverse near their old home,--had an\r\nextensive and valuable reservation in Minnesota, stretching, with a\r\nwidth of ten miles, a long distance on the south side of the Minnesota\r\nRiver; and were comparatively wealthy and prosperous until the Sioux\r\noutbreak in 1862, in which, it will be remembered, nearly one thousand\r\nwhite citizens lost their lives. After the suppression of hostilities\r\nconsequent on this outbreak, most of the Santee Sioux were removed, in\r\n1863, to the Crow Creek reservation, and finally, in 1866, to their\r\npresent location near the mouth of the Niobrara River, at which point\r\ntheir numbers were increased, to the extent of about two hundred, by the\r\naccession of other Sioux, who had been held at Davenport, Io., as\r\nprisoners, charged with complicity in the outbreak, but were pardoned by\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nThe reservation of the Santee Sioux contains 83,200 acres; of which a\r\nsmall portion only is suitable for agricultural purposes, the country\r\ngenerally being broken with high bluffs and deep ravines. Lands have\r\nbeen allotted in severalty to over two hundred. These Indians are\r\npeaceable, industrious, and well advanced in the arts of life, and will\r\nsoon render themselves independent of the assistance now afforded by the\r\ngovernment. They have about five hundred acres in cultivation; upon\r\nwhich good crops of wheat, corn, oats, potatoes, &c., are raised, when\r\nnot destroyed by that scourge of the country, the grasshopper. The\r\nhouses of the Santee Sioux are generally of rude structure; those first\r\nbuilt being without windows, and having only dirt floors and roofs. The\r\nIndians are, however, improving of late in this regard, and building\r\nmuch more durable and comfortable dwellings. They are parties to the\r\ntreaty made in 1868 with the nine bands of the Sioux nation, ranging in\r\nthe region of the Upper Missouri River. In addition to the benefits\r\nderived by the Santee Sioux under this treaty, they have moneys\r\nresulting from the sale of their lands in Minnesota, which are being\r\nused for their benefit in improving their farms, and otherwise aiding\r\nthem in their efforts to become self-supporting. Three schools are in\r\nsuccessful operation on their reservation, having in attendance three\r\nhundred and twenty-three scholars.\r\n\r\n_Winnebagoes._--These Indians, numbering one thousand four hundred and\r\nforty, a gain of forty over last year, are located in the eastern part\r\nof Nebraska, on a reservation containing 128,000 acres, adjoining that\r\nof the Omahas, and lying about eighty miles north of the city of Omaha.\r\nThey are the remnant of a once powerful tribe which formerly inhabited\r\nWisconsin, from which State they removed to Minnesota under the treaty\r\nof 1837. At the outbreak of the Sioux in 1862, they were peaceably\r\nengaged in agriculture, in a beautiful and fertile country on the waters\r\nof the Blue Earth River, a majority being thriving and industrious\r\nfarmers, many of them possessing considerable intelligence. Although the\r\nWinnebagoes were wholly disconnected with that outbreak, yet the\r\ncitizens in their immediate vicinity, as well as in other portions of\r\nMinnesota, were so determined that all Indians should be removed beyond\r\nthe limits of the State, that Congress, in 1863, passed an act providing\r\nfor their removal. They were first removed in May, 1863, to Crow Creek,\r\nin Dakota; and after great suffering, and loss of many lives from\r\nexposure and starvation, they were finally established upon their\r\npresent reservation, which had been secured for them by the government\r\nunder treaty stipulations with the Omahas, and at which they arrived in\r\nsmall and straggling parties during the year 1864. They are now\r\ngradually regaining their former comfortable and prosperous condition.\r\nAllotments of lands have been made to them. Their agent reports that the\r\npast year has been marked by a steady improvement of the condition\r\ngenerally of the tribe. The men have nearly all adopted the dress of\r\nthe whites; and the agent anticipates that the women will do the same so\r\nsoon as they shall come to live in houses, a number of which (50), of a\r\nbetter class than is usually provided for Indian occupancy, are now\r\nbeing erected, to be given to those most industrious and making the\r\ngreatest progress toward civilization. Considerable interest is\r\nmanifested in education, there being three day-schools, efficiently\r\nmanaged, with an attendance of two hundred and fifty scholars; and there\r\nis probably in operation by this date also an industrial and boarding\r\nschool, capable of accommodating eighty scholars.\r\n\r\n_Omahas._--The Omahas, a peaceable and inoffensive people, numbering\r\nnine hundred and sixty-nine, a decrease since 1871 of fifteen, are\r\nnative to the country now occupied by them, and occupy a reservation of\r\n345,600 acres adjoining the Winnebagoes. They have lands allotted to\r\nthem in severalty, and have made considerable advancement in agriculture\r\nand civilization, though they still follow the chase to some extent.\r\nUnder the provisions of the act of June 10, 1872, steps are being taken\r\nto sell 50,000 acres of the western part of their reservation. The\r\nproceeds of the sale of these lands will enable them to improve and\r\nstock their farms, build houses, &c., and, with proper care and\r\nindustry, to become in a few years entirely self-sustaining. A few\r\ncottages are to be found upon this reservation.\r\n\r\nThere are at present three schools in operation on this reservation,\r\nwith an attendance of one hundred and twenty scholars.\r\n\r\n_Pawnees._--The Pawnees, a warlike people, number two thousand four\r\nhundred and forty-seven, an increase for the past year of eighty-three.\r\nThey are located on a reservation of 288,000 acres, in the central part\r\nof the State. They are native to the country now occupied by them, and\r\nhave for years been loyal to the government, having frequently furnished\r\nscouts for the army in operations against hostile tribes or marauding\r\nbands. Their location, so near the frontier, and almost in constant\r\ncontact with the Indians of the plains, with whom they have been always\r\nmore or less at war, has tended to retard their advancement in the arts\r\nof civilization. They are, however, gradually becoming more habituated\r\nto the customs of the whites, are giving some attention to agriculture,\r\nand, with the disappearance of the buffalo from their section of the\r\ncountry, will doubtless settle down to farming and to the practice of\r\nmechanical arts in earnest. The act of June 10, 1872, heretofore\r\nreferred to, provides also for the sale of 50,000 acres belonging to the\r\nPawnees, the same to be taken from that part of their reservation lying\r\nsouth of Loup Fork. These lands are now being surveyed; and it is\r\nbelieved, that, with the proceeds of this sale, such improvements, in\r\nthe way of building houses and opening and stocking farms, can be made\r\nfor the Pawnees as will at an early day induce them to give their entire\r\ntime and attention to industrial pursuits. There are two schools in\r\noperation on the reservation,--one a manual-labor boarding-school, the\r\nother a day-school, with an attendance at both of one hundred and\r\neighteen scholars. Provision was also made by Congress, at its last\r\nsession, for the erection of two additional schoolhouses for the use of\r\nthis tribe.\r\n\r\n_Sacs and Foxes of the Missouri._--These Indians, formerly a portion of\r\nthe same tribe with the Indians now known as the Sacs and Foxes of the\r\nMississippi, emigrated many years ago from Iowa, and settled near the\r\ntribe of Iowas, hereafter to be mentioned. They number at the present\r\ntime but eighty-eight, having been steadily diminishing for years. They\r\nhave a reservation of about 16,000 acres, lying in the south-eastern\r\npart of Nebraska and the north-eastern part of Kansas, purchased for\r\nthem from the Iowas. Most of it is excellent land; but they have never,\r\nto any considerable extent, made use of it for tillage, being almost\r\nhopelessly disinclined to engage in labor of any kind, and depending\r\nprincipally for their subsistence, a very poor one, upon their annuity,\r\nwhich is secured to them by the treaty of Oct. 31, 1837, and amounts to\r\n$7,870. By act of June 10, 1872, provision was made for the sale of a\r\nportion or all of their reservation, the proceeds of such sale to be\r\nexpended for their immediate use, or for their removal to the Indian\r\nTerritory or elsewhere. They have consented to the sale of their entire\r\nreservation; and, so soon as funds shall have been received from that\r\nsource, steps will be taken to have them removed to the Indian Territory\r\nsouth of Kansas.\r\n\r\n_Iowas._--These Indians, numbering at present two hundred and\r\ntwenty-five, emigrated years ago from Iowa and North-western Missouri,\r\nand now have a reservation adjoining the Sacs and Foxes of the Missouri,\r\ncontaining about 16,000 acres. They belong to a much better class of\r\nIndians than their neighbors the Sacs and Foxes, being temperate,\r\nfrugal, industrious, and interested in the education of their children.\r\nThey were thoroughly loyal during the late rebellion, and furnished a\r\nnumber of soldiers to the Union army. Many of them are good farmers; and\r\nas a tribe they are generally extending their agricultural operations,\r\nimproving their dwellings, and adding to their comforts. A large\r\nmajority of the tribe are anxious to have their reservation allotted in\r\nseveralty; and, inasmuch as they are not inclined to remove to another\r\nlocality, it would seem desirable that their wishes in this respect\r\nshould be complied with. One school is in operation on the reservation,\r\nwith an attendance of sixty-eight scholars, besides an industrial home\r\nfor orphans, supported by the Indians themselves.\r\n\r\n_Otoes and Missourias._--These Indians, numbering four hundred and\r\nsixty-four, an increase of fourteen over last year, were removed from\r\nIowa and Missouri to their present beautiful and fertile reservation,\r\ncomprising 160,000 acres, and situated in the southern part of Nebraska.\r\nUntil quite recently they have evinced but little disposition to labor\r\nfor a support or in any way to better their miserable condition; yet\r\ncut off from their wonted source of subsistence, the buffalo, by their\r\nfear of the wild tribes which have taken possession of their old\r\nhunting-grounds, they have gradually been more and more forced to work\r\nfor a living. Within the last three years many of them have opened farms\r\nand built themselves houses. A school has also been established, having\r\nan attendance of ninety-five scholars.\r\n\r\n\r\nKANSAS.\r\n\r\nThe Indians still remaining in Kansas are the Kickapoos, Pottawatomies\r\n(Prairie band), Chippewas and Munsees, Miamies, and the Kansas or Kaws.\r\n\r\n_Kickapoos._--The Kickapoos emigrated from Illinois, and are now\r\nlocated, to the number of two hundred and ninety, on a reservation of\r\n19,200 acres, in the north-eastern part of the State. During the late\r\nwar a party of about one hundred, dissatisfied with the treaty made with\r\nthe tribe in 1863, went to Mexico, upon representations made to them by\r\ncertain of their kinsmen living in that republic, that they would be\r\nwelcomed and protected by the Mexican government; but, finding\r\nthemselves deceived, attempted to return to the United States. Only a\r\nfew, however, succeeded in reaching the Kickapoo agency. The Kickapoos\r\nnow remaining in Mexico separated from the tribe more than twenty years\r\nago, and settled among the southern Indians in the Indian Territory, on\r\nor near the Washita River, whence they went to Mexico, where they still\r\nlive, notwithstanding the efforts of the government, of late, to arrange\r\nwith Mexico for their removal to the Indian Territory and location upon\r\nsome suitable reservation. Their raids across the border have been a\r\nsore affliction to the people of Texas; and it is important that the\r\nfirst promising occasion should be taken to secure their return to the\r\nUnited States, and their establishment where they may be carefully\r\nwatched, and restrained from their depredatory habits, or summarily\r\npunished if they persist in them. The Kickapoos remaining in Kansas are\r\npeaceable and industrious, continuing to make commendable progress in\r\nthe cultivation of their farms, and showing much interest in the\r\neducation of their children. Under the provisions of the treaty of June\r\n28, 1862, a few of these Indians have received lands in severalty, for\r\nwhich patents have been issued, and are now citizens of the United\r\nStates. Two schools are in operation among these Indians, with a daily\r\naverage attendance of thirty-nine scholars.\r\n\r\n_Pottawatomies._--The Prairie band is all of this tribe remaining in\r\nKansas, the rest having become citizens and removed, or most of them, to\r\nthe Indian Territory. The tribe, excepting those in Wisconsin heretofore\r\nnoticed, formerly resided in Michigan and Indiana, and removed to Kansas\r\nunder the provisions of the treaty of 1846. The Prairie band numbers, as\r\nnearly as ascertained, about four hundred, and is located on a reserve\r\nof 77,357 acres, fourteen miles north of Topeka. Notwithstanding many\r\nefforts to educate and civilize these Indians, most of them still cling\r\ntenaciously to the habits and customs of their fathers. Some, however,\r\nhave recently turned their attention to agricultural pursuits, and are\r\nnow raising stock and most of the varieties of grain produced by their\r\nwhite neighbors. They are also showing more interest in education than\r\nformerly; one school being in operation on the reservation, with an\r\nattendance of eighty-four scholars.\r\n\r\n_Chippewas and Munsees._--Certain of the Chippewas of Saginaw, Swan\r\nCreek, and Black River, removed from Michigan under the treaty of 1836;\r\nand certain Munsees, or Christian Indians, from Wisconsin under the\r\ntreaty of 1839. These were united by the terms of the treaty concluded\r\nwith them July 16, 1859. The united bands now number only fifty-six.\r\nThey own 4,760 acres of land in Franklin County, about forty miles south\r\nof the town of Lawrence, holding the same in severalty, are considerably\r\nadvanced in the arts of life, and earn a decent living, principally by\r\nagriculture. They have one school in operation, with an attendance of\r\nsixteen scholars. These Indians, at present, have no treaty with the\r\nUnited States; nor do they receive any assistance from the government.\r\n\r\n_Miamies._--The Miamies of Kansas formerly resided in Indiana, forming\r\none tribe with the Miamies still remaining in that State, but removed in\r\n1846 to their present location, under the provisions of the treaty of\r\n1840.\r\n\r\nOwing to the secession of a considerable number who have allied\r\nthemselves with the Peorias, in the Indian Territory, and also to the\r\nravages of disease consequent on vicious indulgences, especially in the\r\nuse of intoxicating drinks, this band, which, on its removal from\r\nIndiana, embraced about five hundred, at present numbers but\r\nninety-five. These have a reservation of 10,240 acres in Linn and Miami\r\nCounties, in the south-east part of Kansas, the larger part of which is\r\nheld in severalty by them.\r\n\r\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs, in immediate charge, in his report\r\nfor this year says the Miamies remaining in Kansas are greatly\r\ndemoralized, their school has been abandoned, and their youth left\r\ndestitute of educational advantages.\r\n\r\nConsiderable trouble has been for years caused by white settlers\r\nlocating aggressively on lands belonging to these Indians, no effort for\r\ntheir extrusion having been thus far successful.\r\n\r\n_Kansas or Kaws._--These Indians are native to the country they occupy.\r\nThey number at present five hundred and ninety-three: in 1860 they\r\nnumbered eight hundred and three. Although they have a reservation of\r\n80,640 acres of good land in the eastern part of the State, they are\r\npoor and improvident, and have in late years suffered much for want of\r\nthe actual necessaries of life. They never were much disposed to labor,\r\ndepending upon the chase for a living, in connection with the annuities\r\ndue from government. They have been growing steadily poorer; and even\r\nnow, in their straitened circumstances, and under the pressure of want,\r\nthey show but little inclination to engage in agricultural pursuits, all\r\nattempts to induce them to work having measurably proved failures. Until\r\nquite recently they could not even be prevailed upon to have their\r\nchildren educated. One school is now in operation, with an attendance of\r\nabout forty-five scholars. By the act of May 8, 1872, provision was made\r\nfor the sale of all the lands owned by these Indians in Kansas, and for\r\ntheir removal to the Indian Territory. Provision was also made, by the\r\nact of June 5, 1872, for their settlement within the limits of a tract\r\nof land therein provided to be set apart for the Osages. Their lands in\r\nKansas are now being appraised by commissioners appointed for the\r\npurpose, preparatory to their sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIAN TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nThe Indians at present located in the Indian Territory--an extensive\r\ndistrict, bounded north by Kansas, east by Missouri and Arkansas, south\r\nby Texas, and west by the one hundredth meridian, designated by the\r\ncommissioners appointed under act of Congress July 20, 1867, to\r\nestablish peace with certain hostile tribes, as one of two great\r\nTerritories (the other being, in the main, the present Territory of\r\nDakota, west of the Missouri) upon which might be concentrated the great\r\nbody of all the Indians east of the Rocky Mountains--are the Cherokees,\r\nChoctaws, Chickasaws, Creeks, Seminoles, Senecas, Shawnees, Quapaws,\r\nOttawas of Blanchard's Fork and Roche de Boeuf, Peorias, and\r\nconfederated Kaskaskias, Weas and Piankeshaws, Wyandots, Pottawatomies,\r\nSacs and Foxes of the Mississippi, Osages, Kiowas, Comanches, the\r\nArapahoes and Cheyennes of the south, the Wichitas and other affiliated\r\nbands, and a small band of Apaches long confederated with the Kiowas and\r\nComanches.\r\n\r\n_Cherokees._--The Cherokees number, according to the census for 1872,\r\nfurnished by their agent, 18,000. In the report for 1871 the agent\r\nestimated the number at 14,682, and stated that if the Cherokees\r\nremaining in North Carolina and other States were gathered into the\r\nnation, the population would then be 16,500. He does not now account for\r\nthe large increase over the enumeration for 1871, which must be due to a\r\ngross error in one report or the other. The Cherokees occupy a\r\nreservation of 3,844,712 acres in the north-eastern part of the\r\nTerritory, lying east of the 96 deg. west longitude. They also own a strip\r\nabout fifty miles wide adjoining Kansas on the south, and extending from\r\nthe Arkansas River west to the 100 deg. west longitude. By the treaty of\r\n1866, however, the United States may settle friendly Indians within the\r\nlimits of the latter tract; and when such settlements are made the\r\nrights of the Cherokees to the lands so occupied terminate, the lands\r\nthus disposed of to be paid for to the Cherokee nation at such price as\r\nmay be agreed upon by the parties in interest, or as may be fixed by the\r\nPresident. That portion of country lying between the 96 deg. west longitude\r\non the east, the Arkansas River on the west and south, and the State of\r\nKansas on the north, formerly owned by the Cherokees, has been sold to\r\nthe Osages.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees originally inhabited sections of country now embraced\r\nwithin the State of Georgia and portions of the States of Tennessee and\r\nNorth Carolina, and moved to their present location under the provisions\r\nof the treaties concluded with them in 1817 and 1835. They have their\r\nown written language, their national constitution and laws, their\r\nchurches, schools, and academies, their judges and courts. They are\r\nemphatically an agricultural and stock-raising people, and perhaps of\r\nall the Indian tribes, great and small, are first in general\r\nintelligence, in the acquisition of wealth, in the knowledge of the\r\nuseful arts, and in social and moral progress. The evidences of a real\r\nand substantial advancement in these respects are too clear to be\r\nquestioned; and it is the more remarkable from the fact, that, but a few\r\nyears since, they were, as a people, almost ruined by the ravages of\r\ncivil war. Their dwellings consist of 500 frame-houses, and 3,500\r\nlog-houses. Of the principal crops, they have raised during the year\r\n2,925,000 bushels of corn, 97,500 bushels of wheat, about the same\r\nquantity of oats, and 80,000 bushels of potatoes. Their stock consists\r\nof 16,000 horses, 75,000 cattle, 160,000 hogs, and 9,000 sheep. The\r\nindividual wealth is estimated at $4,995,000.\r\n\r\nBy the latest reports, they had sixty schools in successful operation,\r\nall, with the exception of one managed by the Moravians, maintained out\r\nof the national school-fund, and having in attendance 2,133 scholars.\r\nThree of these schools are for the education of the freedmen living in\r\nthe country. The orphans of the Cherokees have been heretofore provided\r\nfor in private families, by means of the interest derived from certain\r\nfunds invested for that purpose; but during the past year an orphan\r\nasylum has been established under an act of the National Council, where\r\nare now gathered fifty-four of this class. This school is designed\r\nultimately to embrace in its operations all the orphans of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees have no treaty-funds paid to them or expended for their\r\nbenefit. They have, however, United-States and State bonds held in trust\r\nfor them by the Secretary of the Interior, to the amount of\r\n$1,633,627.39; also a recognized claim on account of abstracted State\r\nbonds to the amount of $83,000, on which the interest is appropriated\r\nannually by Congress, making in all $1,716,627.39. This sum is divided\r\nunder the following heads, viz., national fund, $1,008,285.07; school\r\nfund, $532,407.01; orphan fund, $175,935.31. The interest on these\r\nseveral sums is paid to the treasurer of the Cherokee nation, to be used\r\nunder the direction of the National Council for the objects indicated by\r\nsaid heads.\r\n\r\n_Choctaws and Chickasaws._--These tribes are for certain national\r\npurposes confederated. The Choctaws, numbering 16,000, an increase of\r\n1,000 on the enumeration for 1871, have a reservation of 6,688,000\r\nacres in the south-eastern part of the Territory; and the Chickasaws,\r\nnumbering 6,000, own a tract containing 4,377,600 acres adjoining the\r\nChoctaws on the west. These tribes originally inhabited the section of\r\ncountry now embraced within the State of Mississippi, and were removed\r\nto their present location in accordance with the terms of the treaties\r\nconcluded with them, respectively, in 1820 and 1832. The remarks made\r\nrespecting the language, laws, educational advantages, industrial\r\npursuits, and advancement in the arts and customs of civilized life, of\r\nthe Cherokees, will apply in the main to the Choctaws and Chickasaws.\r\nThe Choctaws have 36 schools in operation, with an attendance of 819\r\nscholars; the Chickasaws 11, with 379 scholars. The Choctaws, under the\r\ntreaties of Nov. 16, 1805, Oct. 18, 1820, Jan. 20, 1825, and June 22,\r\n1855, receive permanent annuities as follows: in money, $3,000; for\r\nsupport of government, education, and other beneficial purposes,\r\n$25,512.89; for support of light-horsemen, $600; and for iron and steel,\r\n$320. They also have United-States and State stocks, held in trust for\r\nthem by the Secretary of the Interior, to the amount of $506,427.20,\r\ndivided as follows: on account of \"Choctaw general fund,\" $454,000; of\r\n\"Choctaw school-fund,\" $52,427.20. The interest on these funds, and the\r\nannuities, &c., are turned over to the treasurer of the nation, and\r\nexpended under the direction of the National Council in the manner and\r\nfor the objects indicated in each case. The Chickasaws, under act of\r\nFeb. 25, 1799, and treaty of April 28, 1866, have a permanent annuity of\r\n$3,000. They also have United-States and State stocks, held in trust for\r\nthem by the Secretary of the Interior, to the amount of\r\n$1,185,947.03-2/3; $183,947.03-2/3 thereof being a \"national fund,\" and\r\n$2,000 a fund for \"incompetents.\" The interest on these sums, and the\r\nitem of $3,000 first referred to, are paid over to the treasurer of the\r\nnation, and disbursed by him, under the direction of the National\r\nCouncil, and for such objects as that body may determine.\r\n\r\n_Creeks._--The Creeks came originally from Alabama and Georgia. They\r\nnumbered at the latest date of enumeration 12,295, and have a\r\nreservation of 3,215,495 acres in the eastern and central part of the\r\nTerritory. They are not generally so far advanced as the Cherokees,\r\nChoctaws, and Chickasaws, but are making rapid progress, and will\r\ndoubtless, in a few years, rank in all respects with their neighbors,\r\nthe three tribes just named. The Creeks, by the latest reports, have 33\r\nschools in operation; one of which is under the management of the\r\nMethodist Mission Society, and another supported by the Presbyterians.\r\nThe number of scholars in all the schools is 760. These Indians have,\r\nunder treaties of Aug. 7, 1790, June 16, 1802, Jan. 24, 1826, Aug. 7,\r\n1856, and June 14, 1866, permanent annuities and interest on moneys\r\nuninvested as follows: in money, $68,258.40; for pay of blacksmiths and\r\nassistants, wagon-maker, wheelwright, iron and steel, $3,250; for\r\nassistance in agricultural operations, $2,000; and for education,\r\n$1,000. The Secretary of the Interior holds in trust for certain members\r\nof the tribe, known as \"orphans,\" United-States and State bonds to the\r\namount of $76,999.66, the interest on which sum is paid to those of said\r\norphans who are alive, and to the representatives of those who have\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\n_Seminoles._--The Seminoles, numbering 2,398, an increase of 190 over\r\nthe census of 1871, have a reservation of 200,000 acres adjoining the\r\nCreeks on the west. This tribe formerly inhabited the section of country\r\nnow embraced in the State of Florida. Some of them removed to their\r\npresent location under the provisions of the treaties of 1832 and 1833.\r\nThe remainder of the tribe, instigated by the former chief, Osceola,\r\nrepudiated the treaties, refused to remove, and soon after commenced\r\ndepredating upon the whites. In 1835 these depredations resulted in war,\r\nwhich continued seven years, with immense cost of blood and treasure.\r\nThe Indians were at last rendered powerless to do further injury, and,\r\nafter efforts repeated through several years, were finally, with the\r\nexception of a few who fled to the everglades, removed to a reservation\r\nin the now Indian Territory. In 1866 they ceded to the United States, by\r\ntreaty, the reservation then owned by them, and purchased the tract they\r\nat present occupy. They are not so far advanced in the arts of civilized\r\nlife as the Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Creeks, but are making\r\nrapid progress in that direction, and will, it is confidently believed,\r\nsoon rank with the tribes named. They cultivate 7,600 acres; upon which\r\nthey raised during the past year 300,000 bushels of corn, and 6,000\r\nbushels of potatoes. They live in log-houses, and own large stocks of\r\ncattle, horses, and hogs. The schools of the Seminoles number 4, with an\r\nattendance of 169 scholars.\r\n\r\nThey receive, under treaties made with them Aug. 7, 1856, and March 21,\r\n1866, annuities, &c., as follows: interest on $500,000, amounting to\r\n$25,000 annually, which is paid to them as annuity; interest on $50,000,\r\namounting to $2,500 annually, for support of schools; and $1,000, the\r\ninterest on $20,000, for the support of their government.\r\n\r\n_Senecas and Shawnees._--The Senecas, numbering 214, and the Shawnees,\r\nnumbering 90, at the present time, removed, some thirty-five or forty\r\nyears ago, from Ohio to their present location in the north-eastern\r\ncorner of the Territory. They suffered severely during the rebellion,\r\nbeing obliged to leave their homes and fly to the North, their country\r\nbeing devastated by troops of both armies. Under the provisions of the\r\ntreaty of 1867, made with these and other tribes, the Senecas, who were\r\nthen confederated with the Shawnees, dissolved their connection with\r\nthat tribe, sold to the United States their half of the reservation\r\nowned by them in common with the Shawnees, and connected themselves with\r\nthose Senecas who then owned a separate reservation. The Shawnees now\r\nhave a reservation of 24,960 acres, and the united Senecas one of 44,000\r\nacres. These tribes are engaged in agriculture to a considerable\r\nextent. They are peaceable and industrious. Many are thrifty farmers,\r\nand in comfortable circumstances. They have one school in operation,\r\nwith an attendance of 36 scholars, which includes some children of the\r\nWyandots, which tribe has no schools.\r\n\r\n_Quapaws._--These Indians number at the present time about 240. They are\r\nnative to the country, and occupy a reservation of 104,000 acres in the\r\nextreme north-east corner of the Territory. They do not appear to have\r\nadvanced much within the past few years. In common with other tribes in\r\nthat section, they suffered greatly by the late war, and were rendered\r\nvery destitute. Their proximity to the border towns of Kansas, and the\r\nfacilities thereby afforded for obtaining whiskey, have tended to retard\r\ntheir progress; but there has recently been manifested a strong desire\r\nfor improvement; and with the funds derived from the sale of a part of\r\ntheir lands, and with the proposed opening of a school among them,\r\nbetter things are hoped for in the future.\r\n\r\n_Ottawas._--The Ottawas of Blanchard's Fork and Roche de Boeuf number,\r\nat the present time, 150. They were originally located in Western Ohio\r\nand Southern Michigan, and were removed, in accordance with the terms\r\nof the treaty concluded with them in 1831, to a reservation within the\r\npresent limits of Kansas. Under the treaty of 1867 they obtained a\r\nreservation of 24,960 acres, lying immediately north of the western\r\nportion of the Shawnee reservation. They have paid considerable\r\nattention to education, are well advanced in civilization, and many of\r\nthem are industrious and prosperous farmers. They have one school,\r\nattended by 52 scholars. The relation of this small band to the\r\ngovernment is somewhat anomalous, inasmuch as, agreeably to provisions\r\ncontained in the treaties of 1862 and 1867, they have become citizens of\r\nthe United States, and yet reside in the Indian Country, possess a\r\nreservation there, and maintain a purely tribal organization. They\r\nremoved from Franklin Co., Kan., in 1870.\r\n\r\n_Peorias, &c._--The Peorias, Kaskaskias, Weas, and Piankeshaws, who were\r\nconfederated in 1854, and at that time had a total population of 259,\r\nnow number 160. They occupy a reservation of 72,000 acres, adjoining the\r\nQuapaw reservation on the south and west. Under treaties made with these\r\ntribes in 1832, they removed to a tract within the present limits of\r\nKansas, where they remained until after the treaty of 1867 was\r\nconcluded with them, in which treaty provision was made whereby they\r\nobtained their present reservation. These Indians are generally\r\nintelligent, well advanced in civilization, and, to judge from the\r\nstatistical reports of their agent, are very successful in their\r\nagricultural operations, raising crops ample for their own support. With\r\nthe Peorias are about 40 Miamies from Kansas. They have one school in\r\noperation, with an attendance of 29 scholars.\r\n\r\n_Wyandots._--The Wyandots number at the present time 222 souls. Ten\r\nyears ago there were 435. They occupy a reservation of 20,000 acres,\r\nlying between the Seneca and Shawnee reservations. This tribe was\r\nlocated for many years in North-western Ohio, whence they removed,\r\npursuant to the terms of the treaty made with them in 1842, to a\r\nreservation within the present limits of Kansas. By the treaty made with\r\nthem in 1867, their present reservation was set apart for those members\r\nof the tribe who desired to maintain their tribal organization, instead\r\nof becoming citizens, as provided in the treaty of 1855. They are poor,\r\nand, having no annuities and but little force of character, are making\r\nslight progress in industry or civilization. They have been lately\r\njoined by members of the tribe, who, under the treaty, accepted\r\ncitizenship. These, desiring to resume their relations with their\r\npeople, have been again adopted into the tribe.\r\n\r\n_Pottawatomies._--These Indians, who formerly resided in Michigan and\r\nIndiana, whence they removed to Kansas, before going down into the\r\nIndian Territory numbered about 1,600. They have, under the provisions\r\nof the treaty of 1861 made with the tribe, then residing in Kansas,\r\nbecome citizens of the United States. By the terms of said treaty they\r\nreceived allotments of land, and their proportion of the tribal funds,\r\nwith the exception of their share of certain non-paying State stocks,\r\namounting to sixty-seven thousand dollars, held in trust by the\r\nSecretary of the Interior for the Pottawatomies. Having disposed of\r\ntheir lands, they removed to the Indian Territory, where a reservation\r\nthirty miles square, adjoining the Seminole reservation on the west, had\r\nbeen, by the treaty of 1867, provided for such as should elect to\r\nmaintain their tribal organization. It having been decided, however, by\r\nthe department, that, as they had all become citizens, there was\r\nconsequently no part of the tribe remaining which could lay claim, under\r\ntreaty stipulations, to the reservation in the Indian Territory,\r\nlegislation was had by Congress at its last session--act approved May\r\n23, 1872--by which these citizen Pottawatomies were allowed allotments\r\nof land within the tract originally assigned for their use as a tribe,\r\nto the extent of one hundred and sixty acres to each head of family and\r\nto each other person twenty-one years of age, and of eighty acres to\r\neach minor. Most if not all of them are capable of taking care of\r\nthemselves; and many of them are well-educated, intelligent, and thrifty\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n_Absentee Shawnees._--These Indians, numbering six hundred and\r\nsixty-three, separated about thirty years ago from the main tribe, then\r\nlocated in Kansas, and settled in the Indian Territory, principally\r\nwithin the limits of the thirty miles square tract heretofore referred\r\nto in the remarks relative to the Pottawatomies, where they engaged in\r\nfarming, and have since supported themselves without assistance from the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n_Sacs and Foxes._--The Sacs and Foxes of the Mississippi number at the\r\npresent time 463. In 1846 they numbered 2,478. They have a reservation\r\nof 483,840 acres, adjoining the Creeks on the west, and between the\r\nNorth Fork of the Canadian and the Red Fork of the Arkansas Rivers.\r\nThey formerly occupied large tracts of country in Wisconsin, Iowa, and\r\nMissouri, whence they removed, by virtue of treaty stipulations, to a\r\nreservation within the present limits of Kansas. By the terms of the\r\ntreaties of 1859 and 1868, all their lands in Kansas were ceded to the\r\nUnited States, and they were given in lieu thereof their present\r\nreservation. These Indians, once famous for their prowess in war, have\r\nnot, for some years, made any marked improvement upon their former\r\ncondition. Still they have accomplished a little, under highly adverse\r\ncircumstances and influences, in the way of opening small farms and in\r\nbuilding houses, and are beginning to show some regard for their women\r\nby relieving them of the burdens and labors heretofore required of them.\r\nThere is hope of their further improvement, although they are still but\r\none degree removed from the Blanket or Breech-Clout Indians. They have\r\none school in operation, with an attendance of only about twelve\r\nscholars. 317 members of these tribes, after their removal to Kansas,\r\nreturned to Iowa, where they were permitted to remain, and are now,\r\nunder the act of March 2, 1867, receiving their share of the tribal\r\nfunds. They have purchased 419 acres of land in Tama County, part of\r\nwhich they are cultivating. They are not much disposed to work, however,\r\non lands of their own, preferring to labor for the white farmers in\r\ntheir vicinity, and are still much given to roving and hunting.\r\n\r\n_Osages._--The Osages, numbering 3,956, are native to the general\r\nsections of country where they now live. Their reservation is bounded on\r\nthe north by the south line of Kansas, east by the ninety-sixth degree\r\nof west longitude, and south and west by the Arkansas River, and\r\ncontains approximately 1,760,000 acres. They still follow the chase, the\r\nbuffalo being their main dependence for food. Their wealth consists in\r\nhorses (of which they own not less than 12,000) and in cattle.\r\n\r\n_Kiowas, Comanches, and Apaches._--These tribes, confederated under\r\npresent treaty stipulations, formerly ranged over an extensive country\r\nlying between the Rio Grande and the Red River. As nearly as can be\r\nascertained, they number as follows: Kiowas, 1,930; Comanches, 3,180;\r\nand Apaches, 380. They are now located upon a reservation secured to\r\nthem by treaty made in 1867, comprising 3,549,440 acres in the\r\nsouth-western part of the Indian Territory, west of and adjoining the\r\nChickasaw country. Wild and intractable, these Indians, even the best of\r\nthem, have given small signs of improvement in the arts of life; and,\r\nsubstantially, the whole dealing of the government with them, thus far,\r\nhas been in the way of supplying their necessities for food and\r\nclothing, with a view to keeping them upon their reservation, and\r\npreventing their raiding into Texas, with the citizens of which State\r\nthey were for many years before their present establishment on terms of\r\nmutual hatred and injury. Some individuals and bands have remained quiet\r\nand peaceable upon their reservation, evincing a disposition to learn\r\nthe arts of life, to engage in agriculture, and to have their children\r\ninstructed in letters. To these every inducement is being held out to\r\ntake up land, and actively commence tilling it. Thus far they have under\r\ncultivation but 100 acres, which have produced the past year a good crop\r\nof corn and potatoes. The wealth of these tribes consists in horses and\r\nmules, of which they own to the number, as reported by their agent, of\r\n16,500, a great proportion of the animals notoriously having been stolen\r\nin Texas.\r\n\r\nHowever, it may be said, in a word, of these Indians, that their\r\ncivilization must follow their submission to the government, and that\r\nthe first necessity in respect to them is a wholesome example, which\r\nshall inspire fear and command obedience. So long as four-fifths of\r\nthese tribes take turns at raiding into Texas, openly and boastfully\r\nbringing back scalps and spoils to their reservation, efforts to inspire\r\nvery high ideas of social and industrial life among the communities of\r\nwhich the raiders form so large a part will presumably result in\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n_Arapahoes and Cheyennes of the South._--These tribes are native to the\r\nsection of country now inhabited by them. The Arapahoes number at the\r\npresent time 1,500, and the Cheyennes 2,000. By the treaty of 1867, made\r\nwith these Indians, a large reservation was provided for them, bounded\r\non the north by Kansas, on the east by the Arkansas River, and on the\r\nsouth and west by the Red Fork of the Arkansas. They have, however,\r\npersisted in a refusal to locate on this reservation; and another tract,\r\ncontaining 4,011,500 acres, north of and adjoining the Kiowa and\r\nComanche reservation, was set apart for them by Executive order of Aug.\r\n10, 1869. By act of May 29, 1872, the Secretary of the Interior was\r\nauthorized to negotiate with these Indians for the relinquishment of\r\ntheir claim to the lands ceded to them by the said treaty, and to give\r\nthem in lieu thereof a \"sufficient and permanent location\" upon lands\r\nceded to the United States by the Creeks and Seminoles in treaties made\r\nwith them in 1866. Negotiations to the end proposed were duly entered\r\ninto with these tribes unitedly; but, in the course of such\r\nnegotiations, it has become the view of this Office that the tribes\r\nshould no longer be associated in the occupation of a reservation. The\r\nArapahoes are manifesting an increasing disinclination to follow further\r\nthe fortunes of the Cheyennes, and crave a location of their own.\r\nInasmuch as the conduct of the Arapahoes is uniformly good, and their\r\ndisposition to make industrial improvement very decided, it is thought\r\nthat they should now be separated from the more turbulent Cheyennes, and\r\ngiven a place where they may carry out their better intentions without\r\ninterruption and without the access of influences tending to draw their\r\nyoung men away to folly and mischief. With this view a contract, made\r\nsubject to the action of Congress, was entered into between the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs and the delegation of the Arapaho tribe\r\nwhich visited Washington during the present season (the delegation being\r\nfully empowered thereto by the tribe), by which the Arapahoes relinquish\r\nall their interest in the reservation granted them by the treaty of\r\n1867, in consideration of the grant of a reservation between the North\r\nFork of the Canadian River and the Red Fork of the Arkansas River, and\r\nextending from a point ten miles east of the ninety-eighth to near the\r\nninety-ninth meridian of west longitude. Should this adjustment of the\r\nquestion, so far as the Arapahoes are concerned, meet the approval of\r\nCongress, separate negotiations will be entered into with the Cheyennes,\r\nwith a view to obtaining their relinquishment of the reservation of\r\n1867, and their location on some vacant tract within the same general\r\nsection of the Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of the Arapahoes are already engaged in\r\nagriculture, though at a disadvantage; and, when the question of their\r\nreservation shall have been settled, it is confidently believed that\r\nsubstantially the whole body of this tribe will turn their attention to\r\nthe cultivation of the soil. Two schools are conducted for their\r\nbenefit at the agency, having an attendance of thirty-five scholars. Of\r\nthe Cheyennes confederated with the Arapahoes, the reports are less\r\nfavorable as to progress made in industry, or disposition to improve\r\ntheir condition. Until 1867 both these tribes, in common with the Kiowas\r\nand Comanches, were engaged in hostilities against the white settlers in\r\nWestern Kansas; but since the treaty made with them in that year they\r\nhave, with the exception of one small band of the Cheyennes, remained\r\nfriendly, and have committed no depredations.\r\n\r\n_Wichitas, &c._--The Wichitas and other affiliated bands of Keechies,\r\nWacoes, Towoccaroes, Caddoes, Ionies, and Delawares, number 1,250,\r\ndivided approximately as follows: Wichitas, 299; Keechies, 126; Wacoes,\r\n140; Towoccaroes, 127; Caddoes, 392; Ionies, 85; Delawares, 81. These\r\nIndians, fragments of once important tribes originally belonging in\r\nLouisiana, Texas, Kansas, and the Indian Territory, were all, excepting\r\nthe Wichitas and Delawares, removed by the government from Texas, in\r\n1859, to the \"leased district,\" then belonging to the Choctaws and\r\nChickasaws, where they have since resided, at a point on the Washita\r\nRiver near old Fort Cobb. They have no treaty relations with the\r\ngovernment; nor have they any defined reservation. They have always, or\r\nat least for many years, been friendly to the whites, although in close\r\nand constant contact with the Kiowas and Comanches. A few of them,\r\nchiefly Caddoes and Delawares, are engaged in agriculture, and are\r\ndisposed to be industrious. Of the other Indians at this agency, some\r\ncultivate small patches in corn and vegetables, the work being done\r\nmainly by women; but the most are content to live upon the government.\r\nThe Caddoes rank among the best Indians of the continent, and set an\r\nexample to the other bands affiliated with them worthy of being more\r\ngenerally followed than it is. In physique, and in the virtues of\r\nchastity, temperance, and industry, they are the equals of many white\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nA permanent reservation should be set aside for the Indians of this\r\nagency; and, with proper assistance, they would doubtless in a few years\r\nbecome entirely self-sustaining. But one school is in operation, with an\r\nattendance of eighteen scholars. These Indians have no annuities; but an\r\nannual appropriation of $50,000 has for several years been made for\r\ntheir benefit. This money is expended for goods and agricultural\r\nimplements, and for assistance and instruction in farming, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAKOTA, MONTANA, WYOMING, AND IDAHO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho are divided\r\nas follows: in Dakota, about 28,000; Montana, 30,000; Wyoming, 2,000;\r\nand Idaho, 5,000. The present temporary location of the Red Cloud agency\r\nhas, however, drawn just within the limits of Wyoming a body of Indians\r\nvarying from 8,000 to 9,000, who are here, and usually, reckoned as\r\nbelonging in Dakota.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAKOTA.\r\n\r\nThe Indians within the limits of Dakota Territory are the Sioux, the\r\nPoncas, and the Arickarees, Gros Ventres, and Mandans.\r\n\r\n_Sioux._--There are probably, including those at the Red Cloud agency,\r\nat present temporarily located in Wyoming, about 25,000 Sioux under the\r\ncare of government at eight different agencies.\r\n\r\nThe Yankton Sioux, numbering about 2,000, are located in the extreme\r\nsouthern part of the Territory, on the east side of the Missouri, about\r\nfifty miles from the town of Yankton, upon a reservation of 400,000\r\nacres, nearly all rolling prairie, set apart for them by treaty of 1858,\r\nout of the tract then ceded by them to the United States. They have not\r\nbeen much inclined to work; and, although there is good land within\r\ntheir reservation, they are poor, having still to be subsisted in a\r\ngreat measure by the government. It is but due to say of the Yanktons,\r\nthat, while other bands of Sioux have been hostile to the government and\r\ncitizens, they have uniformly been friendly, even to the extent of\r\nassisting the government against their own kindred. They are now giving\r\nconsiderable attention to the education of their children, having six\r\nschools in operation, with an average attendance of three hundred and\r\nsixty-six scholars.\r\n\r\nThe Sisseton and Wahpeton bands have two reservations,--one in the\r\neastern part of the Territory, at Lake Traverse, containing 1,241,600\r\nacres, where are 1,496 Indians; and one in the north-eastern part of the\r\nTerritory, at Devil's Lake, containing 345,600 acres, where are 720\r\nIndians, including a few from the \"Cut-Head\" band of Sioux. These two\r\nreservations are provided for in a treaty made with the bands in 1867.\r\nThese Indians were a portion of the Sioux living in Minnesota at the\r\ntime of the outbreak in 1862. Many of them claim to have been, and\r\ndoubtless were, friendly to the whites during the troubles referred to;\r\nand when the removal of the Sioux took place in 1863, as noticed\r\nheretofore under the title of \"Santee Sioux,\" they went to the western\r\npart of Minnesota and to the eastern and northern parts of Dakota, near\r\ntheir present reservations. They are quite generally engaged in\r\nagricultural operations, under the system adopted while they were on\r\ntheir reservation in Minnesota, by which the individual Indians receive\r\npay in goods or supplies for all work performed, only the aged, infirm,\r\nor sick being supplied with clothing and subsistence gratuitously. So\r\nfar as these Indians are concerned, the scheme has been decidedly\r\nsuccessful; and it should be extended to all the tribes and bands now on\r\nthe \"feeding-list,\" so soon as practicable. There are four schools in\r\noperation for the bands at Lake Traverse, attended by one hundred and\r\ntwenty-three scholars. An unusual degree of interest is manifested of\r\nlate in having their children educated. By treaty made with them in\r\n1867, the amount of funds to be appropriated annually for their benefit\r\nis at the discretion of Congress. For the present year, the sum of\r\n$75,000 has been appropriated for the benefit of these Indians. They\r\nalso participate in the proceeds derived from the sales of the Sioux\r\nlands in Minnesota, which furnish a considerable revenue yearly.\r\n\r\nThe Oncpapa, Blackfeet, Lower Yanktonai, Upper Yanktonai, Sans Arc,\r\nUpper and Lower Brule, Two Kettle, Minneconjou, and Ogallala bands are\r\nlocated at five different agencies, viz.: the Upper Missouri, or Crow\r\nCreek agency, on the east side of the Missouri; the Grand River agency,\r\nat the mouth of the Grand River; the Cheyenne River agency, at the mouth\r\nof the Cheyenne River; the Whetstone agency (so called from its former\r\nlocation at the junction of the Whetstone with the Missouri Rivers), on\r\nthe White River, about two hundred and twenty-five miles west of the\r\nMissouri; and the Red Cloud agency, at present on the North Platte,\r\nabout thirty miles south-east from Fort Laramie. The Indians at these\r\nagencies number in the aggregate about 22,000. They have a reservation\r\nset apart for them by the treaty of 1868, containing about 25,000,000\r\nacres, lying west of the Missouri River and north of Nebraska. Prior to\r\nthis treaty, these Indians had for years been engaged in acts of\r\nhostility against the government and in depredations upon the white\r\nsettlers. Claiming to own most, if not all, of the Territory of Dakota,\r\nand portions of the Territories of Montana and Wyoming, as well as the\r\nwestern part of Nebraska, they used every effort to prevent the\r\nsettlement of the country so claimed, their hostility being especially\r\ndirected against the Union Pacific Railroad. The military operations of\r\n1867-68, however, convinced the Sioux of the hopelessness of opposing\r\nthe progress of the railroad, and the settlement of the immediate belt\r\nthrough which it was to pass, and disposed them to accept the provision\r\nmade for them by the treaty of 1868. With the exception of the main\r\nportion of the Ogallala band, at the Red Cloud agency, and a\r\nconsiderable body of disaffected Indians from all the bands, known as\r\nthe \"hostile Sioux,\" of whom \"Sitting Bull\" and \"Black Moon\" are the\r\nprincipal chiefs, these bands are all within the limits of the\r\nreservation set apart by said treaty of 1868. A few at each of the\r\nagencies on the Missouri River have shown a disposition to engage in\r\nagriculture; but by far the greater part of them remain \"breech-clout\"\r\nIndians, disinclined to labor for a living, and accepting subsistence\r\nfrom the government as the natural and proper consideration for the\r\nfavor done the government by their consenting to remain at the agencies\r\nassigned them. If they have any suspicion that this thing cannot last\r\nforever, and that the time will soon come for them to work or starve,\r\nthe great majority do not allow themselves to be influenced by it, but\r\nseem determined to put the evil day as far off as possible.\r\n\r\n_Poncas._--The Poncas, numbering 735, have a reservation of 576,000\r\nacres, near the confluence of the Niobrara and Missouri Rivers, in the\r\nsouth-eastern part of the Territory, provided for them in their treaty\r\nwith the United States, made in 1858. They are quiet and peaceable, are\r\ninclined to be industrious, and engage to some extent in farming; but\r\nfrom various causes, principally the destruction of their crops by\r\ngrasshoppers, have not succeeded in supporting themselves without\r\nassistance from the government. They are well advanced in civilized\r\nhabits of life, and have shown considerable interest in the education of\r\ntheir children, having three schools in operation, with an average\r\nattendance of seventy-seven scholars.\r\n\r\n_Arickarees, Gros Ventres, and Mandans._--These tribes number 2,200, and\r\nhave a reservation set apart for their occupancy by executive order of\r\nApril 12, 1870, comprising 8,640,000 acres, situated in the\r\nnorth-western part of Dakota and the eastern part of Montana, extending\r\nto the Yellowstone and Powder Rivers. They have no treaty with the\r\ngovernment, are now and have always been friendly to the whites, are\r\nexceptionally known to the officers of the army and to frontiersmen as\r\n\"good Indians,\" and are engaged to some extent in agriculture. Owing to\r\nthe shortness of the agricultural season, the rigor of the climate, and\r\nthe periodical ravages of grasshoppers, their efforts in this direction,\r\nthough made with a degree of patience and perseverance not usual in the\r\nIndian character, have met with frequent and distressing reverses; and\r\nit has from time to time been found necessary to furnish them with more\r\nor less subsistence to prevent starvation. They are traditional enemies\r\nof the Sioux; and the petty warfare maintained between them and the\r\nSioux of the Grand River and Cheyenne River agencies--while, like most\r\nwarfare confined to Indians alone, it causes wonderfully little loss of\r\nlife--serves to disturb the condition of these agencies, and to retard\r\nthe progress of all the parties concerned. These Indians should be moved\r\nto the Indian Territory, south of Kansas, where the mildness of the\r\nclimate and the fertility of the soil would repay their labors, and\r\nwhere, it is thought, from their willingness to labor and their docility\r\nunder the control of the government, they would in a few years become\r\nwholly self-supporting. The question of their removal has been submitted\r\nto them; and they seem inclined to favor the project, but have expressed\r\na desire to send a delegation of their chiefs to the Indian Territory,\r\nwith a view of satisfying themselves as to the desirableness of the\r\nlocation. Their wishes in this respect should be granted early next\r\nseason, that their removal and settlement may be effected during the\r\ncoming year. Notwithstanding their willingness to labor, they have shown\r\nbut little interest in education. Congress makes an appropriation of\r\n$75,000 annually for goods and provisions, for their instruction in\r\nagricultural and mechanical pursuits, for salaries of employes, and for\r\nthe education of their children, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTANA.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes residing within the limits of Montana are the\r\nBlackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans, the Gros Ventres of the Prairie, the\r\nAssinaboines, the Yanktonais, Santee and Teton (so called) Sioux, a\r\nportion of the northern Arapahoes and Cheyennes, the River Crows, the\r\nMountain Crows, the Flatheads, Pend d'Oreilles, and Kootenays, and a few\r\nShoshones, Bannocks, and Sheep-Eaters, numbering in the aggregate about\r\n32,412. They are all, or nearly all, native to the regions now occupied\r\nby them respectively.\r\n\r\nThe following table will exhibit the population of each of these tribes,\r\nas nearly as the same can be ascertained:--\r\n\r\n  Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans                        7,500\r\n\r\n  Assinaboines                                          4,790\r\n\r\n  Gros Ventres                                          1,100\r\n\r\n  Santee, Yanktonais, Uncpapa, and Cut-Head Sioux,\r\n    at Milk River agency                                2,625\r\n\r\n  River Crows                                           1,240\r\n\r\n  Mountain Crows                                        2,700\r\n\r\n  Flatheads                                               460\r\n\r\n  Pend d'Oreilles                                       1,000\r\n\r\n  Kootenays                                               320\r\n\r\n  Shoshones, Bannocks, and Sheep-Eaters                   677\r\n\r\n  Roving Sioux, commonly called Teton Sioux,\r\n    including those gathered during 1872, at\r\n    and near Fort Peck, (largely estimated)             8,000\r\n                                                      -------\r\n  Estimated total                                      30,412\r\n\r\nThe number of northern Cheyennes and Arapahoes roaming in Montana, who,\r\nit is believed, have co-operated with the Sioux under \"Sitting Bull,\"\r\nin their depredations, is not known: it is probably less than 1,000.\r\n\r\nThe Blackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans (located at the Blackfeet agency on\r\nthe Teton River, about seventy-five miles from Fort Benton), the Gros\r\nVentres, Assinaboines, the River Crows, about 1,000 of the Northern\r\nArapahoes and Cheyennes, and the Santee and Yankton Sioux (located at\r\nthe Milk River agency, on the Milk River, about one hundred miles from\r\nits mouth), occupy jointly a reservation in the extreme northern part of\r\nthe Territory, set apart by treaties (not ratified) made in 1868 with\r\nmost of the tribes named, and containing about 17,408,000 acres. The\r\nBlackfeet, Bloods, and Piegans, particularly the last-named band, have\r\nbeen, until within about two years, engaged in depredating upon the\r\nwhite settlers. The Indians at the Milk River agency, with the exception\r\nof the Sioux, are now, and have been for several years, quiet and\r\npeaceable. The Sioux at this agency, or most of them, were engaged in\r\nthe outbreak in Minnesota in 1862. On the suppression of hostilities\r\nthey fled to the northern part of Dakota, where they continued roaming\r\nuntil, in the fall of 1871, they went to their present location, with\r\nthe avowed intention of remaining there. Although they had been at war\r\nfor years with the Indians properly belonging to the Milk River agency,\r\nyet, by judicious management on the part of the agent of the government\r\nstationed there, and the influence of some of the most powerful chiefs,\r\nthe former feuds and difficulties were amicably arranged; and all\r\nparties have remained friendly to each other during the year past. The\r\nIndians at neither the Blackfeet nor the Milk River agency show any\r\ndisposition to engage in farming; nor have they thus far manifested any\r\ndesire for the education of their children. They rely entirely upon the\r\nchase and upon the bounty of the government for their support. They,\r\nhowever, quite scrupulously respect their obligation to preserve the\r\npeace; and no considerable difficulty has of late been experienced, or\r\nis anticipated, in keeping them in order. The Blackfeet, Bloods, and\r\nPiegans have an annual appropriation of $50,000 made for their benefit;\r\nthe Assinaboines, $30,000; the Gros Ventres of the Prairie, $35,000; the\r\nRiver Crows, $30,000. These funds are used in furnishing the respective\r\ntribes with goods and subsistence, and generally for such other objects\r\nas may be deemed necessary to keep the Indians quiet.\r\n\r\n_Mountain Crows._--These Indians have a reservation of 6,272,000 acres,\r\nlying in the southern part of the Territory, between the Yellowstone\r\nRiver and the north line of Wyoming Territory. They have always been\r\nfriendly to the whites, but are inveterate enemies of the Sioux, with\r\nwhom they have for years been at war. By the treaty of 1868--by the\r\nterms of which their present reservation was set apart for their\r\noccupancy--they are liberally supplied with goods, clothing, and\r\nsubsistence. But few of them are engaged in farming, the main body\r\nrelying upon their success in hunting, and upon the supplies furnished\r\nby the government, for their support. They have one school in operation,\r\nwith an attendance, however, of only nine scholars. By the treaty of May\r\n7, 1868, provision is made by which they are to receive for a limited\r\nnumber of years the following annuities, &c., viz.: in clothing and\r\ngoods, $22,723 (twenty-six instalments due); in beneficial objects,\r\n$25,000 (six instalments due); in subsistence, $131,400 (one instalment\r\ndue). Blacksmiths, teachers, physician, carpenter, miller, engineer, and\r\nfarmer are also furnished for their benefit, at an expense to the\r\ngovernment of $11,600.\r\n\r\n_Flatheads_, &c.--The Flatheads, Pend d'Oreilles, and Kootenays have a\r\nreservation of 1,433,600 acres in the Jocko Valley, situated in the\r\nnorth-western part of the Territory, and secured to them by treaty of\r\n1855. This treaty also provided for a reservation in the Bitter-Root\r\nValley, should the President of the United States deem it advisable to\r\nset apart another for their use. The Flatheads have remained in the\r\nlast-named valley; but under the provisions of the act of June 5, 1872,\r\nsteps are being taken for their removal to the Jocko reservation. Many\r\nof these Indians are engaged in agriculture; but, as they receive little\r\nassistance from the government, their progress in this direction is\r\nslow. They have one school in operation, with an attendance of 27\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\n_Shoshones_, &c.--The Shoshones, Bannocks, and Sheep-Eaters are at\r\npresent located about twenty miles above the mouth of the Lemhi Fork of\r\nthe Salmon River, near the western boundary of the Territory. They have\r\nshown considerable interest in agriculture; and many of them are quite\r\nsuccessful as farmers. They have no reservation set apart for them,\r\neither by treaty or by executive order. They are so few in number that\r\nit would probably be better to remove them, with their consent, to the\r\nFort Hall reservation in Idaho, where their brethren are located, than\r\nto provide them with a separate reservation. They have no schools in\r\noperation. An annual appropriation of $25,000 is made for these Indians,\r\nwhich sum is expended for their benefit in the purchase of clothing,\r\nsubsistence, agricultural implements, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWYOMING.\r\n\r\nThe Indians in this Territory, with the exception of the Sioux and\r\nNorthern Arapahoes and Cheyennes, mentioned under the heads of Dakota\r\nand Montana respectively, are the eastern band of Shoshones, numbering\r\nabout 1,000. The Shoshones are native to the country. Their reservation\r\nin the Wind River Valley, containing 2,688,000 acres, was set apart for\r\nthem by treaty of 1868.\r\n\r\nBut little advancement in civilization has been made by these Indians,\r\nowing to their indisposition to labor for a living, and to the incessant\r\nincursions into their country of the Sioux and the Northern Arapahoes\r\nand Cheyennes, with which tribes they have for many years been at war.\r\nThe losses sustained from these incursions, and the dread which they\r\ninspire, tend to make the Shoshones unsettled, and unwilling to remain\r\ncontinuously on the reservation. They therefore spend most of the year\r\nin roaming and hunting when they should be at work tilling the soil and\r\nimproving their lands. There is one school at the agency, having an\r\nattendance of ten scholars, in charge of an Episcopal missionary as\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDAHO.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes in Idaho are the Nez Perces, the Boise and Bruneau\r\nShoshones, and Bannocks, the Coeur d'Alenes, and Spokanes, with\r\nseveral other small bands, numbering in the aggregate about 5,800 souls.\r\n\r\n_Nez Perces._--The Nez Perces number 2,807, and have a reservation of\r\n1,344,000 acres in the northern part of the Territory. By treaties of\r\n1855 and 1863, they ceded to the United States a large body of land\r\nlying within the limits of the then Territories of Oregon and\r\nWashington, and accepted their present diminished reservation, with\r\ncertain annuities in consideration of the cession of the remainder. The\r\ntribe has long been divided into factions known as the \"treaty\" party\r\nand the \"non-treaty\" party, from disagreements arising out of the treaty\r\nmade with them in 1863. Though the ill feeling engendered has in a\r\nmeasure subsided, the \"non-treaty\" Indians, to the number of a few\r\nhundred, still stand apart and accept no favors from the government.\r\nThese, with few exceptions, reside outside the reservation, on Snake\r\nRiver and its tributaries, and cause more or less trouble in a petty way\r\nto the white settlers. The Nez Perces generally have for many years been\r\nfriendly to the whites, are quite extensively engaged in agriculture,\r\nand may be considered well advanced in civilization. They show\r\nconsiderable interest in the education of their children, and have two\r\nschools in operation, with an attendance of 124 scholars.\r\n\r\n_Shoshones and Bannocks._--These Indians, numbering 1,037, the former\r\n516 and the latter 521, occupy a reservation in the south-eastern part\r\nof the Territory, near Fort Hall, formerly a military post. This\r\nreservation was set apart by treaty of 1868, and executive order of July\r\n30, 1869, and contains 1,568,000 acres. The Shoshones on this\r\nreservation have no treaty with the government. Both bands are generally\r\nquiet and peaceable, and cause but little trouble; are not disposed to\r\nengage in agriculture, and, with some assistance from the government,\r\ndepend upon hunting and fishing for subsistence. There is no school in\r\noperation on the reservation.\r\n\r\n_Coeur d'Alenes_, &c.--The Coeur d'Alenes, Spokanes, Kootenays, and\r\nPend d'Oreilles, numbering about 2,000, have no treaty with the United\r\nStates, but have a reservation of 256,000 acres set apart for their\r\noccupancy by executive order of June 14, 1867, lying 30 or 40 miles\r\nnorth of the Nez Perces reservation. They are peaceable, have no\r\nannuities, receive no assistance from the government, and are wholly\r\nself-sustaining. These Indians have never been collected upon a\r\nreservation, nor brought under the immediate supervision of an agent. So\r\nlong as their country shall remain unoccupied, and not in demand for\r\nsettlement by the whites, it will scarcely be desirable to make a change\r\nin their location; but the construction of the Northern Pacific\r\nRailroad, which will probably pass through or near their range, may make\r\nit expedient to concentrate them. At present they are largely under the\r\ninfluence of Catholic missionaries of the Coeur d'Alene Mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORADO, NEW MEXICO, UTAH, ARIZONA, AND NEVADA.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada\r\nare divided as follows: in Colorado, about 3,800; New Mexico, 19,000;\r\nUtah, 10,000; Arizona, 25,000; and Nevada, 13,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORADO.\r\n\r\nThe Indians residing in Colorado Territory are the Tabequache band of\r\nUtes, at the Los Pinos agency, numbering 3,000, and the Yampa, Grand\r\nRiver, and Uintah bands of the White River agency, numbering 800. They\r\nare native to the section which they now inhabit, and have a reservation\r\nof 14,784,000 acres in the western part of the Territory, set apart for\r\ntheir occupancy by treaty made with them in 1868. The two agencies above\r\nnamed are established on this reservation, the White River agency being\r\nin the northern part, on the river of that name, and the other in the\r\nsouth-eastern part. This reservation is much larger than is necessary\r\nfor the number of Indians located within its limits; and as valuable\r\ngold and silver mines have been, or are alleged to have been, discovered\r\nin the southern part of it, the discoveries being followed by the\r\ninevitable prospecting parties and miners, Congress, by act of April 23,\r\n1872, authorized the Secretary of the Interior to enter into\r\nnegotiations with the Utes for the extinguishment of their right to the\r\nsouth part of it.\r\n\r\nA few of these Indians, who have declined to remove to and remain upon\r\nthe reservation, still roam in the eastern part of the Territory,\r\nfrequently visiting Denver and its vicinity, and causing some annoyance\r\nto the settlers by their presence, but committing no acts of violence or\r\nextensive depredations. The Indians of Colorado have thus far shown but\r\nlittle interest in the pursuits of civilized life or in the education of\r\ntheir children. A school is in operation at the Northern or White River\r\nagency, with an attendance of forty scholars. Steps are also being taken\r\nto open one at the Southern or Los Pinos agency.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MEXICO.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing and roaming within the limits of New Mexico are the\r\nNavajoes; the Mescalero, Gila, and Jicarilla bands of Apaches; the\r\nMuache, Capote, and Weeminuche bands of Utes; and the Pueblos.\r\n\r\n_Navajoes._--The Navajoes now number 9,114, an increase of 880 over last\r\nyear's enumeration. Superintendent Pope considers this increase to be\r\nmainly due to the return, during the year, of a number who had been\r\nheld in captivity by the Mexicans. They have a reservation of 3,328,000\r\nacres in the north-western part of New Mexico and north-eastern part of\r\nArizona, set apart for them by treaty of 1868. These Indians are natives\r\nof the section of the country where they are now located. Prior to 1864\r\nno less than seven treaties had been made with these tribes, which were\r\nsuccessively broken on their part, and that, with but one exception,\r\nbefore the Senate could take action on the question of their\r\nratification. In 1864 the Navajoes were made captives by the military,\r\nand taken to the Bosque Redondo reservation, which had been set apart\r\nfor the Mescalero Apaches, where they were for a time held as prisoners\r\nof war, and then turned over to this department. After the treaty of\r\n1868 had been concluded, they were removed to their present location,\r\nwhere they have, as a tribe, remained quiet and peaceable, many of them\r\nbeing engaged in agriculture, and in raising sheep and goats. Of these\r\nthey have large flocks, numbering 130,000 head, which supply them not\r\nonly with subsistence, but also with material from which they\r\nmanufacture the celebrated, and for warmth and durability unequalled,\r\nNavajo blanket. They also have a stock of 10,000 horses. These Indians\r\nare industrious, attend faithfully to their crops, and even put in a\r\nsecond crop when the first, as frequently happens, is destroyed by\r\ndrought or frost.\r\n\r\nOne school is in operation on the reservation, with an attendance of\r\nforty scholars.\r\n\r\n_Mescalero Apaches._--These Indians, numbering about 830, are at present\r\nlocated--not, however, upon a defined reservation secured to them--near\r\nFort Stanton, in the eastern part of the Territory, and range generally\r\nsouth of that point. Prior to 1864, they were located on the Bosque\r\nRedondo reservation, where they were quiet and peaceable until the\r\nNavajoes were removed to that place. Being unable to live in harmony\r\nwith the new-comers, they fled from the reservation, and until quite\r\nrecently have been more or less hostile. They are now living at peace\r\nwith the whites, and conducting themselves measurably well. They have no\r\nschools, care nothing apparently about the education of their children,\r\nand are not to any noticeable extent engaged in farming or in any\r\npursuit of an industrial character. These Indians have no treaty with\r\nthe United States; nor do they receive any annuities. They are,\r\nhowever, subsisted in part by the government, and are supplied with a\r\nlimited quantity of clothing when necessary. In addition to the\r\nMescaleros proper, Agent Curtis reports as being embraced in his agency\r\nother Indians, called by him Aguas Nuevos, 440; Lipans, 350 (probably\r\nfrom Texas); and Southern Apaches, 310, whose proper home is no doubt\r\nupon the Tularosa reservation. These Indians, the agent remarks, came\r\nfrom the Comanche country to his agency at various dates during the past\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n_Gila (sometimes called Southern) Apaches._--This tribe is composed of\r\ntwo bands, the Mimbres and Mogollons, and number about 1,200. They are\r\nwarlike, and have for years been generally unfriendly to the government.\r\nThe citizens of Southern New Mexico, having long suffered from their\r\ndepredatory acts, loudly demanded that they be removed; and to comply\r\nwith the wish of the people, as well as to prevent serious difficulties\r\nand possibly war, it was a year or two since decided to provide the\r\nIndians with a reservation distant from their old home, and there\r\nestablish them. With a view to that end a considerable number of them\r\nwere collected early last year at Canada Alamosa. Subsequently, by\r\nexecutive order dated Nov. 9, 1871, a reservation was set apart for them\r\nwith other roving bands of Apaches in the Tularosa Valley, to which\r\nplace four hundred and fifty of them are reported to have been removed\r\nduring the present year by United States troops. These Indians, although\r\nremoved against their will, were at first pleased with the change, but,\r\nafter a short experience of their new home, became dissatisfied; and no\r\nsmall portion left the reservation to roam outside, disregarding the\r\nsystem of passes established. They bitterly object to the location as\r\nunhealthy, the climate being severe and the water bad. There is\r\nundoubtedly much truth in these complaints. They ask to be taken back to\r\nCanada Alamosa, their old home, promising there to be peaceable and\r\nquiet. Of course nothing can be said of them favorable to the interests\r\nof education and labor. Such of these Indians as remain on the\r\nreservation are being fed by the government. They have no treaty with\r\nthe United States; nor do they receive annuities of any kind.\r\n\r\n_Jicarilla Apaches._--These Indians, numbering about 850, have for\r\nseveral years been located with the Muache Utes, about 650 in number, at\r\nthe Cimarron agency, upon what is called \"Maxwell's Grant,\" in\r\nNorth-eastern New Mexico. They have no treaty relations with the\r\ngovernment; nor have they any reservation set apart for them. Efforts\r\nwere made some years ago to have them, with the Utes referred to, remove\r\nto the large Ute reservation in Colorado, but without success. The\r\nCimarron agency, however, has lately been discontinued; and these\r\nApaches will, if it can be effected without actual conflict, be removed\r\nto the Mescalero agency at Fort Stanton. Four hundred Jicarilla Apaches\r\nare also reported as being at the Tierra Amarilla agency.\r\n\r\n_Muache, Weeminuche, and Capote Utes._--These bands--the Muache band,\r\nnumbering about 650, heretofore at the Cimarron agency, and the other\r\ntwo bands, numbering 870, at the Abiquiu agency--are all parties to the\r\ntreaty made with the several bands of Utes in 1868. It has been desired\r\nto have these Indians remove to their proper reservation in Colorado;\r\nbut all efforts to this end have thus far proved futile. The\r\ndiscontinuance of the Cimarron agency may have the effect to cause the\r\nMuaches to remove either to that reservation or to the Abiquiu agency,\r\nnow located at Tierra Amarilla, in the north-western part of the\r\nTerritory. These three bands have generally been peaceable, and\r\nfriendly to the whites. Recently, however, some of them have shown a\r\ndisposition to be troublesome; but no serious difficulty is apprehended.\r\nNone of them appear disposed to work for a subsistence, preferring to\r\nlive by the chase and on the bounty of the government; nor do they show\r\nany inclination or desire to have their children educated, and taught\r\nthe habits and customs of civilized life. Declining to remove to and\r\nlocate permanently upon the reservation set apart for the Utes in\r\nColorado, they receive no annuities, and participate in none of the\r\nbenefits provided in the treaties of 1863 and 1868 with the several\r\nbands of Ute Indians referred to under the head of \"Colorado.\"\r\n\r\n_Pueblos._--The Pueblos, so named because they live in villages, number\r\n7,683. They have 439,664 acres of land confirmed to them by act of\r\nCongress of Dec. 22, 1858, the same consisting of approved claims under\r\nold Spanish grants. They have no treaty with the United States, and\r\nreceive but little aid from the government. During the past two years\r\nefforts have been made, and are still being continued, to secure the\r\nestablishment of schools in all the villages of the Pueblos, for the\r\ninstruction of their children in the English language. Five such schools\r\nare now being conducted for their benefit.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Pueblos is an interesting one. They are the remains\r\nof a once powerful people, and in habits and modes of life are still\r\nclearly distinguished from all other aborigines of the continent. The\r\nSpanish invaders found them living generally in towns and cities. They\r\nare so described by Spanish historians as far back as 1540. They early\r\nrevolted, though without success, against Spanish rule; and in the\r\nstruggle many of their towns were burned, and much loss of life and\r\nproperty occasioned. It would seem, however, that, in addition to the\r\nvillagers, there were others at that time living dispersed, whose\r\nreduction to Pueblos was determined upon and made the subject of a\r\ndecree by Charles V. of Spain, in 1546, in order chiefly, as declared,\r\nto their being instructed in the Catholic faith. Under the Spanish\r\ngovernment, schools were established at the villages; the Christian\r\nreligion was introduced, and impressed upon the people, and the rights\r\nof property thoroughly protected. By all these means a high degree of\r\ncivilization was secured, which was maintained until after the\r\nestablishment of Mexican independence; when, from want of government\r\ncare and support, decay followed; and the Pueblos measurably\r\ndeteriorated, down to the time when the authority of the United States\r\nwas extended over that country: still they are a remarkable people,\r\nnoted for their sobriety, industry, and docility. They have few wants,\r\nand are simple in their habits, and moral in their lives. They are,\r\nindeed, scarcely to be considered Indians in the sense traditionally\r\nattached to that word, and, but for their residence upon reservations\r\npatented to these bands in confirmation of ancient Spanish grants, and\r\ntheir continued tribal organization, might be regarded as a part of the\r\nordinary population of the country. There are now nineteen villages of\r\nthese Indians in New Mexico. Each village has a distinct and organized\r\ngovernment, with its governor and other officers, all of whom are\r\nelected annually by the people, except the _cacique_, a sort of high\r\npriest, who holds his office during life. Though nominally Catholics in\r\nreligion, it is thought that their real beliefs are those of their\r\nancestors in the days of Montezuma.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTAH.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing wholly or in part within the limits of Utah are the\r\nNorth-western, Western, and Goship bands of Shoshones; the Weber, Yampa,\r\nElk Mountain, and Uintah bands of Utes; the Timpanagos, the San Pitches,\r\nthe Pah-Vents, the Piedes, and She-be-rechers,--all, with the exception\r\nof the Shoshones, speaking the Ute language, and being native to the\r\ncountry inhabited by them.\r\n\r\n_North-western, Western, and Goship Shoshones._--These three bands of\r\nShoshones, numbering together about 3,000, have treaties made with the\r\ngovernment in 1863. No reservations were provided to be set apart for\r\nthem by the terms of said treaties, the only provision for their benefit\r\nbeing the agreement on the part of the United States to furnish them\r\nwith articles, to a limited extent and for a limited term, suitable to\r\ntheir wants as hunters or herdsmen. Having no reservations, but little\r\ncan be done for their advancement. They live in North-western Utah and\r\nNorth-eastern Nevada, and are generally inclined to be industrious, many\r\nof them gaining a livelihood by working for the white settlers, while\r\nothers cultivate small tracts of land on their own account.\r\n\r\nThe Weber Utes, numbering about 300, live in the vicinity of Salt Lake\r\nCity, and subsist by hunting, fishing, and begging. The Timpanagos,\r\nnumbering about 500, live south of Salt Lake City, and live by hunting\r\nand fishing. The San Pitches, numbering about 300, live, with the\r\nexception of some who have gone to the Uintah Valley reservation, in the\r\ncountry south and east of the Timpanagos, and subsist by hunting and\r\nfishing. The Pah-Vents number about 1,200, and occupy the territory\r\nsouth of the Goships, cultivate small patches of ground, but live\r\nprincipally by hunting and fishing. The Yampa Utes, Piedes, Pi-Utes, Elk\r\nMountain Utes, and She-be-rechers live in the eastern and southern parts\r\nof the Territory. They number, as nearly as can be estimated, 5,200; do\r\nnot cultivate the soil, but subsist by hunting and fishing, and at times\r\nby depredating in a small way upon the white settlers. They are warlike\r\nand migratory in their habits, carrying on a petty warfare pretty much\r\nall the time with the southern Indians. These bands of Utes have no\r\ntreaties with the United States: they receive no annuities, and but very\r\nlittle assistance from the government.\r\n\r\nThe Uintah Utes, numbering 800, are now residing upon a reservation of\r\n2,039,040 acres in Uintah Valley, in the north-eastern corner of the\r\nTerritory, set apart for the occupancy of the Indians in Utah by\r\nexecutive order of Oct. 3, 1861, and by act of Congress of May 5, 1864.\r\nThis reservation comprises some of the best farming land in Utah, and is\r\nof sufficient extent to maintain all the Indians in the Territory. Some\r\nof the Indians located here show a disposition to engage in agriculture,\r\nthough most of them still prefer the chase to labor. No steps have yet\r\nbeen taken to open a school on the reservation. The Uintah Utes have no\r\ntreaty with the United States; but an appropriation averaging about\r\n$10,000 has been annually made for their civilization and improvement\r\nsince 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nARIZONA.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in the Territory of Arizona are the Pimas and\r\nMaricopas, Papagoes, Mohaves, Moquis, and Orivas Pueblos, Yumas,\r\nYavapais, Hualapais, and different bands of the Apaches. All are native\r\nto the districts occupied by them, respectively.\r\n\r\n_Pimas and Maricopas._--These, said to have been in former years\r\n\"Village\" or \"Pueblo\" Indians, number 4,342, and occupy a reservation of\r\n64,000 acres, set apart for them under the act of Feb. 28, 1859, and\r\nlocated in the central part of the Territory, on the Gila River. They\r\nare, and always have been peaceful, and loyal to the government; are\r\nconsiderably advanced, according to a rude form of civilization, and\r\nbeing industrious, and engaged quite successfully, whenever the\r\nconditions of soil and climate are favorable, in farming operations, are\r\nnearly self-sustaining. The relations of these bands with the\r\nneighboring whites are, however, very unfavorable to their interests;\r\nand the condition of affairs is fast growing worse. The difficulty\r\narises out of the fact of the use, and probably the improvident use, by\r\nthe whites above them, of the water of the Gila River, by which they are\r\ndeprived of all means of irrigating their lands. Much dissatisfaction is\r\nmanifested on this account; and the result is, so far, that many of the\r\nIndians have left the reservation, and gone to Salt River Valley, where\r\nthey are making a living by tilling the soil, not, however, without\r\ngetting into trouble at this point also with the settlers.\r\n\r\nThe Pimas and Maricopas are greatly interested in the education of\r\ntheir children. Two schools are in operation on the reservation, with an\r\nattendance of 105 scholars. These tribes have no treaty with the United\r\nStates, and receive but little assistance from the government.\r\n\r\n_Papagoes._--These Indians, numbering about 5,000, are of the same\r\nclass, in some respects, as the Pueblos in New Mexico, living in\r\nvillages, cultivating the soil, and raising stock for a support. They\r\nhave no reservation set apart for their occupancy, but inhabit the\r\nsouth-eastern part of the Territory. Many of them have embraced\r\nChristianity; and they are generally well behaved, quiet, and peaceable.\r\nThey manifest a strong desire to have their children educated; and steps\r\nto this end have been taken by the department. These Indians have no\r\ntreaty relations with the United States, and receive no assistance from\r\nthe government. The expediency of assigning to the Papagoes a\r\nreservation, and concentrating them where they can be brought within the\r\ndirect care and control of the government, is under consideration by the\r\ndepartment. There seems to be no reason to doubt that, if so\r\nestablished, and once supplied with implements and stock, they would\r\nbecome in a short time not only self-sustaining, but prosperous.\r\n\r\n_Mohaves._--These Indians have a reservation of 75,000 acres, located on\r\nthe Colorado River, and set apart for them and other tribes in the\r\nvicinity of said river, under the act of March 3, 1865. The Mohaves\r\nnumber about 4,000, of whom only 828 are on the reservation, the rest\r\neither roaming at large or being fed at other reservations in the\r\nTerritory. An irrigating canal has been built for them at great expense;\r\nbut farming operations have not as yet proved very successful. Over\r\n1,100 acres, however, are being cultivated by the Indians. The crops\r\nconsist of corn, melons, and pumpkins. These Indians show but little\r\nprogress in civilization. The parents objecting to the education of\r\ntheir children, no schools have been put in operation on the\r\nreservation, as they could be conducted only on a compulsory system. The\r\nMohaves have no treaty stipulations with the United States; but they are\r\npartly subsisted, and are largely assisted in their farming operations,\r\nfrom the general incidental fund of the territory.\r\n\r\n_Yumas._--These Indians number probably 2,000. They inhabit the country\r\nnear the mouth of the Colorado River, but belong to the reservation\r\noccupied by the Mohaves. They refuse, however, to remove to the\r\nreservation, and gain a scanty subsistence by planting, and by cutting\r\nwood for steamers plying on the river. Many of them remain about Arizona\r\nCity, performing menial services for the whites, and gratifying their\r\ninveterate passion for gambling. They have no treaty with the United\r\nStates, and receive but little assistance from the government.\r\n\r\n_Hualapais._--These Indians, numbering about 1,500, inhabit the country\r\nnear the Colorado River, north of the Mohaves, ranging a considerable\r\ndistance into the interior. They have been, and still are, more or less\r\nhostile. Those who are quiet and peaceable are, with members of other\r\nbands of Indians, being fed by the government at Camps McDowell, Beal's\r\nSpring, and Date Creek.\r\n\r\n_Yavapais and Apaches._--These Indians are estimated to number from\r\n8,000 to 12,000, the lower estimate being the more reasonable. Their\r\nranging grounds are in the central, northern, and eastern parts of the\r\nTerritory. Most of them have long been hostile to the government,\r\ncommitting numerous robberies and murders. Earnest efforts have been\r\nmade during the past year to settle them on reservations, three of\r\nwhich, viz., Camp Apache, Camp Grant, and Camp Verde, were set apart for\r\ntheir occupancy by executive order dated Nov. 9, 1871. These efforts,\r\nhowever, have not resulted very successfully; the Indians occasionally\r\ncoming upon the reservations in large numbers, but leaving without\r\npermission, and, indeed, defiantly, whenever so disposed, oftentimes\r\nrenewing their depredations before their supplies of government rations\r\nare exhausted. Many of the bands of this tribe (if it can be called a\r\ntribe; habits, physical structure, and language all pointing to a great\r\ndiversity in origin among the several bands) are seemingly incorrigible,\r\nand will hardly be brought to cease their depredations and massacres\r\nexcept by the application of military force.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEVADA.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Nevada are Pah-Utes, Pi-Utes, Washoes, Shoshones,\r\nand Bannocks, and are native to the districts inhabited by them\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n_Pah-Utes._--These Indians, numbering about 6,000, inhabit the western\r\npart of the State. Two reservations have been set apart for them,--one\r\nknown as the Walker River, the other as the Pyramid Lake reservation,\r\ncontaining each 320,000 acres. These Indians are quiet, and friendly to\r\nthe whites, are very poor, and live chiefly upon fish, game, seeds, and\r\nnuts, with such assistance as the government from time to time renders\r\nthem. They show considerable disposition to labor; and those on the\r\nreservations, especially the Walker River reservation, are cultivating\r\nsmall patches of ground. The Pyramid Lake reservation affords, in\r\naddition, excellent fishing, and the surrounding settlements a ready\r\nmarket for the catch over and above what the Indians require for their\r\nown consumption.\r\n\r\nNo schools have been established for these Indians. They have no treaty\r\nrelations with the government, and receive no annuities.\r\n\r\n_Pi-Utes._--The Pi-Utes, numbering probably 2,500, inhabit the\r\nsouth-eastern part of the State. They have no reservation set apart for\r\nthem; nor have they any treaty with the United States. They roam about\r\nat will, are very destitute, and obtain a living principally by\r\npilfering from the whites, although a few of them are engaged in a small\r\nway in farming. But very little can be done for these Indians by the\r\ngovernment in their present unsettled condition. They should be brought\r\nupon one of the reservations set apart for the Indians in Nevada, or\r\nupon the Uintah reservation in Utah, where they could receive suitable\r\ncare, and proper instruction in the arts of civilized life.\r\n\r\n_Washoes._--These Indians, numbering about 500, are a poor, miserable,\r\nand debauched people, and spend most of their time among the white\r\nsettlements, where they gain some supplies of food and clothing by\r\nmenial services. They have no reservation and no treaty, are not in\r\ncharge of any agent of the government; and vice and disease are rapidly\r\ncarrying them away.\r\n\r\n_Shoshones._--The Shoshones are a portion of the North-western, Western,\r\nand Goship bands, referred to under the head of \"Utah.\" Those roaming or\r\nresiding in the eastern part of Nevada number about 2,000. The remarks\r\nmade respecting their brethren in Utah will equally apply to them.\r\n\r\n_Bannocks._--The Bannocks, roaming in the north-eastern part of the\r\nState, number, probably, 1,500, and are doubtless a portion of the\r\npeople of that name ranging in Eastern Oregon and Southern Idaho. They\r\nhave no treaty with the government, nor any reservation set apart for\r\nthem, and are not in charge of any United States agent. They should, if\r\npossible, be located upon the Fort Hall reservation in Idaho, where\r\nsome steps could be taken to advance them in civilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PACIFIC SLOPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indians on the Pacific slope are divided as follows: in Washington\r\nTerritory, about 14,000; in Oregon, 12,000; in California, 22,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Washington Territory are the Nisqually, Puyallup,\r\nand other confederate tribes; the D'Wamish and other allied bands; the\r\nMakahs, the S'Klallams, the Qui-nai-elts and Qui-leh-utes, the Yakamas,\r\nthe Chehalis and other allied tribes, and the Colville, Spokanes,\r\nCoeur d'Alenes, Okanagans, and others.\r\n\r\n_Nisqually, Puyallup, and others._--These Indians, numbering about\r\n1,200, have three reservations, containing, as per treaty of 1854,\r\n26,776 acres, situated on the Nisqually and Puyallup Rivers, and on an\r\nisland in Puget Sound. Some of these Indians are engaged in farming, and\r\nraise considerable wheat, also potatoes and other vegetables. Many are\r\nemployed by the farmers in their vicinity; while others still are idle\r\nand shiftless, spending their time wandering from place to place. One\r\nschool is in operation on the Puyallup reservation, with an attendance\r\nof eleven scholars.\r\n\r\n_D'Wamish and others._--The D'Wamish and other allied tribes number\r\n3,600, and have five reservations, containing in all 41,716 acres, set\r\napart by treaty made with them in 1855, and located at as many points on\r\nPuget Sound. Many of these Indians, particularly those residing on the\r\nLummi reservation, are industrious farmers, raising all the produce\r\nnecessary for their support, and owning a large number of cattle,\r\nhorses, hogs, &c.; while others are either employed by the neighboring\r\nwhite farmers, or engaged in lumbering on their own account. They are\r\ngenerally Christianized, most of them members of the Catholic Church.\r\nOne school, with 57 scholars, is in operation on the Tulalip\r\nreservation, where all the government buildings are located. This school\r\nhas had a remarkable degree of success, as reported by the agent and by\r\ndisinterested visitors.\r\n\r\n_Makahs._--These Indians number 604, and have a reservation of 12,800\r\nacres, set apart by treaty made with them in 1855, and located at the\r\nextreme north-west corner of the Territory. They are a bold, hardy race,\r\nnot inclined to till the soil for a support, but depending principally\r\nupon fishing and the taking of fur-seal for their livelihood. One school\r\nis in operation among them, with an attendance of 16 scholars.\r\n\r\n_S'Klallams._--These Indians, numbering 919, have a reservation of 4,000\r\nacres, set apart by treaty made with them in 1855, and located on what\r\nis known as \"Hood's Canal.\" Some of them are engaged, in a small way, in\r\nfarming; and others are employed in logging for the neighboring\r\nsaw-mills. Their condition generally is such that their advancement in\r\ncivilization must necessarily be slow. A school has been established on\r\nthe reservation, and is attended by 22 scholars.\r\n\r\n_Qui-nai-elts, Qui-leh-utes, Hohs, and Quits._--These Indians number\r\n520, and have a reservation of 25,600 acres, in the extreme eastern part\r\nof the Territory, and almost wholly isolated from white settlements, set\r\napart under a treaty made with them July 1, 1855. But one of the four\r\ntribes mentioned, the Qui-nai-elts, live upon the reservation: the\r\nothers reside at different points along the coast, northward from the\r\nreservation. These declare that they never agreed to sell their country,\r\nand that they never knowingly signed any treaty disposing of their right\r\nto it. The bottom land on the reservation is heavily timbered, and a\r\ngreat deal of labor is required to clear it; but when cleared, it\r\nproduces good crops. Many of the Indians, though in the main fish-eaters\r\n(the Qui-nai-elt River furnishing them with salmon in great abundance),\r\nare cultivating small patches, and raise sufficient vegetables for their\r\nown use. One school is in operation on the reservation, with an\r\nattendance of 15 scholars.\r\n\r\n_Yakamas._--The Yakamas number 3,000, and have a reservation in the\r\nsouthern part of the Territory, containing 783,360 acres, set apart for\r\nthem by treaty of June 9, 1855. These Indians belong to numerous bands,\r\nconfederated under the title of Yakamas. Many of them, under the able\r\nmanagement of their present agent, have become noticeably advanced in\r\ncivilization, and are good farmers or skilled mechanics. The\r\nmanual-labor school at the Yakama agency has been a complete success,\r\nand of incalculable benefit in imparting to the children a practical\r\nknowledge of farming and of the different mechanical arts. Their\r\nprincipal wealth is in horses, of which they own 12,000. The fact that\r\nthe reservation for these Indians is located east of the Cascade\r\nMountains, away from all contact with the whites, has doubtless tended,\r\nin a great measure, to make this what it is,--the model agency on the\r\nPacific slope: though to this result the energy and devotion of Agent\r\nWilbur have greatly contributed. Churches have been built on the\r\nreservation, which are well attended, the services being conducted by\r\nnative preachers. There are at present two schools, with an attendance\r\nof 44 scholars.\r\n\r\n_Chehalis and others, remnants of tribes, and parties to no treaty with\r\nthe government._--These Indians number about 600, and have a reservation\r\nof 4,322 acres in the eastern part of the Territory, set apart for them\r\nby executive order of July 8, 1864. A considerable portion of the land\r\nin this reservation is excellent for agricultural purposes; and quite\r\nextensive crops are being raised by the Indians of the Chehalis tribe.\r\nNone of the other tribes for whom the reservation was intended reside\r\nupon it, declining to do so for the reason that they do not recognize it\r\nas their own, and fear to prejudice their claims to other lands by so\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nAll these Indians have horses and cattle in abundance. They are\r\nindustrious; and, being good field-hands, those of them who do not farm\r\non their own account find ready employment from the surrounding farmers,\r\ntheir services always commanding the highest wages. Having no treaty\r\nrelations with the government, no direct appropriations are made for\r\ntheir benefit. They, however, receive some assistance from the general\r\nincidental fund of the Territory. The Indians herein referred to as not\r\nliving upon the reservation are of the Cowlitz, Chinook, Shoalwater Bay,\r\nand Humboldt tribes. They profess to desire a home at the mouth of the\r\nHumboldt and Coinoose Rivers, where they originated.\r\n\r\n_Colville and other Tribes._--These Indians, numbering 3,349, occupy the\r\nnorth-eastern portion of the Territory. They have no treaty relations\r\nwith the government, and, until the present year, have had no\r\nreservation set apart for them. They are now, however, to be\r\nestablished, under an order of the President of July 2, 1872, in the\r\ngeneral section of the Territory where they now are, upon a tract which\r\nis bounded on the south and east by the Columbia River, on the west by\r\nthe Okinakane River, and on the north by British Columbia. The tribes\r\nfor whom this reservation is designed are known as Colvilles,\r\nOkinakanes, San Poels, Lake Spokanes, Coeur d'Alenes, Calispells, and\r\nMethows. Some of these Indians, however, have settled upon valuable\r\ntracts of land, and have made extensive improvements, while others, to\r\na considerable number, have begun farming in a small way at various\r\npoints within the district from which is proposed to remove their\r\nrespective tribes. It is doubtful whether these individuals will\r\nvoluntarily remove to the reservation referred to, which is some\r\ndistance west of their present location. It is proposed, therefore, to\r\nallow such as are engaged in farming to remain where they are, if they\r\nso desire. Owing to the influx of whites into the country thus claimed\r\nor occupied by these Indians, many of them have been crowded out; and\r\nsome of them have had their own unquestionable improvements forcibly\r\nwrested from them. This for a time during the past summer caused\r\nconsiderable trouble, and serious difficulties were apprehended; but\r\nthus far peace has been preserved by a liberal distribution among them\r\nof agricultural implements, seeds, blankets, &c. No funds are\r\nappropriated specially for these Indians, such supplies and presents as\r\nare given them being furnished from the general incidental fund of the\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n\r\nOREGON.\r\n\r\nThe tribes residing in Oregon are the Umatillas, Cayuses, Walla-Wallas,\r\nWascoes, Molels, Chasta Scotans, Coosas, Alseas, Klamath, Modocs, and\r\nWal-pah-pee Snakes, besides numerous other small bands. They are all\r\nnative to the country. On account of the great number of small tribes\r\nand bands in this State,--the number of tribes and bands parties to the\r\nsame treaty being in some cases as high as ten or fifteen,--these\r\nIndians will be treated of, and the remarks concerning them will be\r\nmade, under the heads of the agencies at which they are respectively\r\nlocated.\r\n\r\n_Umatilla Agency._--The tribes located at this agency are the Umatillas,\r\nCayuses, and a portion of the Walla-Wallas, and number 837. They have a\r\nreservation of 512,000 acres, situated in the north-eastern part of the\r\nState, set apart for them by treaty of June 9, 1855. This reservation is\r\nvery fertile, and, as usual in such cases, has attracted the cupidity of\r\nthe whites. A proposition was made last year, under the authority of\r\nCongress, to have the Indians take land in severalty, or sell and remove\r\nto some other reservation. The Indians, however, in the exercise of\r\ntheir treaty rights, refused to accede to this proposition. These\r\nIndians are successfully engaged in agricultural operations, are nearly\r\nself-supporting, and may be considered, comparatively speaking,\r\nwealthy. It is gratifying to state that the introduction of whiskey by\r\nwhites upon this reservation, and its sale to the Indians, has, during\r\nthe last year, received a decided check through the vigilance of Agent\r\nCornoyer in causing the arrest and trial of four citizens for a\r\nviolation of the law in this respect. All the parties charged were\r\nconvicted, and are now in prison. This is especially worthy of note,\r\nfrom the fact that it is always exceedingly difficult to obtain\r\nconvictions for such dealing with Indians in any section of the country.\r\nThere is one school in operation on the reservation, with an attendance\r\nof twenty-seven scholars.\r\n\r\n_Warm-Spring Agency._--The Indians at this agency, known as the\r\n\"Confederated Tribes and Bands of Indians in Middle Oregon,\" comprise\r\nseven bands of the Walla-Walla and Wasco tribes, numbering six hundred\r\nand twenty-six. They have a reservation of 1,024,000 acres, located in\r\nthe central part of the State, set apart for them by the treaty of June\r\n25, 1855. Though there is but little really good land in this\r\nreservation, many of the Indians, by reason of their industry, have\r\nsucceeded measurably in their farming operations, and may be considered\r\nas self-sustaining. In morals they have greatly improved; so that\r\npolygamy, the buying and selling of wives, gambling, and drunkenness\r\nhave ceased to be common among them, as in the past. There are some,\r\nhowever, who are disposed to wander off the reservation, and lead a\r\nvagabond life. But little advancement has been made in education among\r\nthese Indians. One school is in operation at the agency, with an\r\nattendance of fifty-one scholars.\r\n\r\n_Grand-Ronde Agency._--The Indians at this agency comprise the Molalla,\r\nClackama, Calapooia, Molel, Umpqua, Rogue River, and other bands,\r\nseventeen in all, with a total population of eight hundred and seventy.\r\nThe reservation upon which these bands are located is in the\r\nnorth-western part of the State. It contains 69,120 acres, and was set\r\napart for their occupation by treaty of Jan. 22, 1855, with the\r\nMolallas, Clackamas, &c., and by executive order of June 30, 1857. Some\r\nportions of this reservation are well adapted to grain-raising, though\r\nmuch of it is rough and heavily timbered. An allotment of land in\r\nseveralty has been directed to be made, much to the gratification and\r\nencouragement of the tribes. These Indians are inclined to industry,\r\nand show commendable zeal in cultivating their farms, growing crops\r\nwhich compare favorably with those of their white neighbors. Their\r\ncustoms and habits of life also exhibit a marked improvement. One school\r\nis in operation, with an attendance of fifty scholars.\r\n\r\n_Siletz Agency._--The Indians at this agency are the Chasta Scotons, and\r\nfragments of fourteen other bands, called, generally, Coast-tribes,\r\nnumbering altogether about 2,500. These Indians, including those at the\r\nAlsea sub-agency, have a reservation of 1,100,800 acres set apart for\r\nthem by treaty of Aug. 11, 1855; which treaty, however, has never been\r\nratified, although the reservation is occupied by the Indians. They were\r\nfor a long time much averse to labor for a support; but recently they\r\nhave shown more disposition to follow agriculture, although\r\ntraditionally accustomed to rely chiefly upon fish for food. Many\r\nalready have their farms well fenced and stocked, with good, comfortable\r\ndwellings and out-houses erected thereon. There is no reason why they\r\nshould not, in time, become a thoroughly prosperous people. The failure\r\nto make allotments of land in severalty, for which surveys were\r\ncommenced in 1871, has been a source of much uneasiness to the Indians,\r\nand has tended to weaken their confidence in the good intentions of the\r\ngovernment. One school is in operation on the reservation, with an\r\nattendance of twenty scholars. None of the tribes or bands at this\r\nagency have any treaty relations with the United States, unless it may\r\nbe a few members of the Rogue-River band, referred to under the head of\r\nthe Grand-Ronde agency.\r\n\r\n_Alsea Sub-agency._--The Indians at this sub-agency are the Alseas,\r\nCoosas, Sinselans, and a band of Umpquas, numbering in all three\r\nhundred, located within the limits of the reservation referred to under\r\nthe head of the Siletz agency. The remarks made about the Indians at the\r\nSiletz agency will generally apply to the Indians of this sub-agency.\r\nThe Coosas, Sinselans, and Umpquas are making considerable advancement\r\nin agriculture, and, had they advantages of instruction, would rapidly\r\nacquire a proficiency in the simpler mechanical branches of industry.\r\nThe Alseas are not so tractable, and exhibit but little desire for\r\nimprovement. All the assistance they receive from the government is\r\nsupplied out of the limited amount appropriated for the general\r\nincidental expenses of the service in Oregon.\r\n\r\n_Klamath Agency._--The Indians belonging to this agency are the Klamaths\r\nand Modocs, and the Yahooskin and Wal-pah-pee bands of Snakes, numbering\r\naltogether about 4,000, of whom only 1,018 are reported at the agency.\r\nThey have a reservation containing 768,000 acres, set apart for them by\r\nthe treaty of Oct. 14, 1864, and by executive order of March 14, 1871,\r\nsituated in the extreme southern portion of the State. This reservation\r\nis not well adapted to agriculture. The climate is cold and uncertain;\r\nand the crops are consequently liable to be destroyed by frosts. It is,\r\nhowever, a good grazing country. Although this reservation is,\r\ncomparatively speaking, a new one, the Indians located upon it are\r\nmaking commendable progress, both in farming operations and in\r\nlumbering. A part of the Modocs, who belong by treaty to this agency,\r\nand who were at one time located upon the reservation, have, on account\r\nof their troubles with the Klamaths,--due principally to the overbearing\r\ndisposition of the latter,--left the agency, and refuse to return to it.\r\nThey desire to locate upon a small reservation by themselves. Under the\r\ncircumstances, they should be permitted to do this, or else be allowed\r\nto select a tract on the Malheur reservation. There is no school at\r\npresent in operation for these Indians.\r\n\r\n_Malheur Reservation._--This reservation, set apart by executive order\r\nof Sept. 12, 1872, is situated in the south-eastern part of the State.\r\nUpon this it is the intention of the department eventually to locate all\r\nthe roving and straggling bands in Eastern and South-eastern Oregon,\r\nwhich can be induced to settle there. As no funds are at the disposal of\r\nthe department with which to make the necessary improvements, and to\r\nprovide temporary subsistence for Indians removed, the work has not yet\r\nbeen fairly commenced. The Indians who should be collected upon this\r\nreservation are now a constant source of annoyance to the white\r\nsettlers. They hang about the settlements and military posts, begging\r\nand stealing; and, unless some prompt measures be taken to bring them\r\nunder the care and control of an agent of the government, serious\r\ntrouble may result at any time. Congress should make the necessary\r\nappropriation during the coming session to maintain an agent for these\r\nIndians, to erect the agency buildings, and to provide subsistence for\r\nsuch as may be collected and may remain upon the reservation.\r\n\r\n_Indians not upon Reservations._--There are a number of Indians,\r\nprobably not less than 3,000, \"renegades,\" and others of roving habits,\r\nwho have no treaty relations with the government, and are not in charge\r\nof any agent. The tribal names of some of these are the Clatsops,\r\nNestucals, Tillamooks, Nehalims, Snakes, and Nez Perces. The\r\n\"renegades,\" such in fact and so called, roam on the Columbia River, and\r\nare of considerable annoyance to the agents at Warm Springs and\r\nUmatilla: others, the Snakes, two hundred in number, are upon the edge\r\nof the Grand-Ronde reservation. These live by hunting and fishing, and\r\nprofess to desire to have lands allotted to them, and a school provided\r\nfor their children. The Nez Perces, belonging in Idaho, to the estimated\r\nnumber of two hundred, are found in Wallowa Valley, in the eastern part\r\nof the State. They claim that they were not parties to the treaty with\r\nthe Nez Perce tribe years ago; that the valley in which they live has\r\nalways belonged to them; and they strenuously oppose its settlement by\r\nthe whites.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA.\r\n\r\nThe tribes in California are the Ukie, Pitt River, Wylackie, Concon,\r\nRedwood, Humboldt, Hoonsolton, Miscott, Siah, Tule, Tejon, Coahuila,\r\nKing's River, and various other bands and tribes, including the \"Mission\r\nIndians,\" all being native to the country.\r\n\r\n_Round-Valley Agency._--The Indians belonging to this agency are the\r\nUkies, Concons, Pitt Rivers, Wylackies, and Redwoods, numbering in all\r\n1,700. The number has been increased during the past year by bringing in\r\n1,040 Indians collected in Little Lake and other valleys. A reservation\r\ncontaining 31,683 acres has been set apart per act of April 8, 1864, and\r\nexecutive order of March 30, 1870, in the western and northern part of\r\nthe State, for these Indians, and for such others as may be induced to\r\nlocate thereon. The lands in the reservation are very fertile; and the\r\nclimate admits of a widely varied growth of crops. More produce being\r\nraised than is necessary for the subsistence of the Indians, the\r\nproceeds derived from the sale of the surplus are used in purchasing\r\nstock and work-animals, and for the further improvement of the\r\nreservation. Several of the Indians are engaged in cultivating gardens,\r\nwhile others work as many as twenty-five or thirty acres on their own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThe Indians on this reservation are uniformly quiet and peaceable,\r\nnotwithstanding that they are much disturbed by the white trespassers.\r\nSuits, by direction of the department, were commenced against such\r\ntrespassers, but without definite results as yet; the Attorney-General\r\nhaving directed the United States District Attorney to suspend\r\nproceedings. Of this reservation the Indian Department has in actual\r\npossession and under fence only about 4,000 acres; the remainder being\r\nin the possession of settlers, all clamorous for breaking up the\r\nreservation and driving the Indians out.\r\n\r\nThe Indians at this reservation have shown no especial disposition to\r\nhave their children educated; and no steps were taken to that end until\r\nin the summer of 1871, when a school was commenced. There is now one\r\nschool in operation, with an attendance of 110 scholars. These Indians\r\nhave no treaties with the government; and such assistance as is rendered\r\nthem in the shape of clothing, &c., is from the money appropriated for\r\nthe general incidental expenses of the Indian service in the State.\r\n\r\n_Hoopa-Valley Agency._--The Indians belonging to this agency are the\r\nHumboldts, Hoonsoltons, Miscotts, Siahs, and several other bands,\r\nnumbering seven hundred and twenty-five.\r\n\r\nA reservation was set apart per act of April 8, 1864, for these and such\r\nother Indians in the northern part of the State as might be induced to\r\nsettle thereon. This reservation is situated in the north-western part\r\nof the State, on both sides of the Trinity River, and contains 38,400\r\nacres. As a rule, sufficient is raised on the reservation to supply the\r\nwants of the Indians. These Indians are quiet and peaceable, and are not\r\ndisposed to labor on the reservation in common, but will work\r\nindustriously when allowed to do so on their own individual account. One\r\nschool is in operation on the reservation, with an attendance of\r\nseventy-four scholars. Having no treaty relations with the United\r\nStates, and, consequently, no regular annuities appropriated for their\r\nbenefit, the general incidental fund of the State is used so far as may\r\nbe necessary, and so far as the amount appropriated will admit, to\r\nfurnish assistance in the shape of clothing, agricultural implements,\r\nseeds, &c. Besides these, their agent has a general supervisory control\r\nof certain Klamath Indians, who live adjacent to the reservation and\r\nalong the banks of the Klamath River. These formerly belonged to a\r\nreservation bearing their name, which was, years ago, abandoned in\r\nconsequence of the total destruction by flood of agency buildings and\r\nimprovements. They now support themselves chiefly by hunting and\r\nfishing, and by cultivating small patches in grain and vegetables.\r\n\r\n_Tide-River Farm, or Agency._--The Indians located at this point are the\r\nTules and Manaches, numbering three hundred and seventy-four. These\r\nIndians are gradually improving, are quite proficient in all kinds of\r\nfarm-work, and show a good disposition to cultivate the soil on their\r\nown account. There is one school in operation at the Tule River farm,\r\nwith an attendance of thirty-seven scholars. About sixty miles from the\r\nagency reside several hundred King's-River Indians, who are in a\r\nwretched and destitute condition. They desire to be attached to the\r\nagency, and have in the past received occasional supplies of food from\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Indians not on Reservations._--In addition to the Indians located at\r\nthe three agencies named, there are probably not less than 20,000,\r\nincluding the Mission Indians (so called), the Coahuilas, Owen's River,\r\nand others, in the southern part of the State; and those on the Klamath,\r\nTrinity, Scott, and Salmon Rivers, in the northern part. The Mission\r\nIndians, having been for the past century under the Catholic missions\r\nestablished on the California coast, are tolerably well advanced in\r\nagriculture, and compare favorably with the most highly civilized tribes\r\nof the East. The Coahuilas and others inhabiting the south-eastern and\r\neastern portions of the State, and those in the north, support\r\nthemselves by working for white settlers, or by hunting, fishing,\r\nbegging, and stealing, except, it may be, a few of the northern Indians,\r\nwho go occasionally to the reservations and the military posts in that\r\nsection for assistance in the way of food.\r\n\r\nThere are also about 4,000 Owen's-River and Manache Indians east of the\r\nSierras, whom the settlers would gladly see removed to a reservation,\r\nand brought under the care of an agent. The department has under\r\nconsideration the propriety of establishing a new reservation, upon\r\nwhich shall be concentrated these and numerous other Indians, in which\r\nevent the Tule-River agency could advantageously be discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  +---------------------------------------------+\r\n  |           Transcriber's Note                |\r\n  |                                             |\r\n  | Some inconsistent spelling in the           |\r\n  | original document has been retained.        |\r\n  |                                             |\r\n  | Typographical errors corrected in the text: |\r\n  |                                             |\r\n  | Page  40 goverment changed to government    |\r\n  | Page 100 carcer changed to career           |\r\n  | Page 186 hererofore changed to heretofore   |\r\n  | Page 259 favororably changed to favorably   |\r\n  +---------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Indian Question (1874), by Francis A.
