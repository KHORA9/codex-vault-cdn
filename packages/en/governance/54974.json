But the\r\nAuthor begs leave to say--that in this instance, the Introduction is\r\nthe_ Key.\r\n\r\n_It will be found, that the_ minor _part of the Title indicates the_\r\nmajor _of the subject in respect to importance, though not perhaps in\r\nmatter for amusement_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should this book be written? To give information. But was it\r\nproper to come through such hands, and to be communicated in such\r\ncircumstances?\r\n\r\nAs to the first of these questions, the Author happened to have in\r\nhis possession a portfolio of incidents and observations, recorded by\r\nhis own hand, during a tour through the wild and romantic regions of\r\nthe American Lakes, and a visit among several tribes of Indians in\r\nthe North-West Territory, in 1830. It happened also, that this visit\r\nin the North-West gave him an opportunity of being present at a great\r\nand eventful Council, composed of representatives of the chiefs of\r\nseveral Indian nations and a Commission from the Government of the\r\nUnited States, the developements of which were somewhat extraordinary\r\nand extremely interesting. The second ACT of this Council and its\r\nconcluding scenes, viewed dramatically, were opened at the city of\r\nWashington, in the following winter; of which also the Author was a\r\nspectator, and in which were exhibited the entire scope of Indian\r\naffairs in America, displaying very conspicuously and impressively\r\ntheir more recent enactments. The interest of these events chained the\r\nAuthor’s attention, excited his sympathies for the ancient race of\r\nAmerican Aborigines, and induced him to avail himself of all possible\r\nmeans of becoming acquainted with the history of their wrongs. His\r\nopportunities were abundant. He had never meditated, however, any\r\npublic use of the observations he had made and of the information he\r\nhad been able to collect, until a year after his arrival in England;\r\nwhen it was suggested to him, in conversation with some friends,\r\nthat the materials in his possession were in many respects novel and\r\ninteresting; and some motives were presented for embodying them in a\r\nform to be submitted to the public eye.\r\n\r\nBut the difficult question was:--What the form should be? The maxim of\r\nByron: “Truth is strange, stranger than fiction”--was perhaps never\r\nmore applicable, than to the principal subject of these pages. The\r\nhistory of the American Indians is the _Romance of Fact_. It needs\r\nnot a single dash of the pencil--not a single ingredient of the\r\nsentimentality of poetry, to give it life and power over the feelings.\r\nThe naked truth has in it more of poetry and a more energetic challenge\r\non the affections, than any possible embellishment, or fictitious\r\ngarniture, that could be thrown around it--more than any creations of\r\nfancy, with which it could be charged. Show that race, as they _are_\r\nand _have_ been, and none of human kind can fail to be interested in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut there were many reasons, notwithstanding, why, if the Author\r\nconsented to make any public use of the facts in his possession, he\r\nshould embody them under a mixed garb of romance and history. And he\r\nactually proceeded so far, as to execute one volume under this plan.\r\nBut after submitting it to other minds, a grave discussion arose, and\r\nit was earnestly insisted:--that it should be _properly fiction_, or\r\n_sober history_;--and it was agreed, that the facts were abundantly\r\nsufficient to demand the last, and that no fictitious dress could equal\r\nthe interest of the exact truth.\r\n\r\nHaving resolved upon the historical course exclusively, the delicate\r\nsituation of the Author, as an American, came next to be considered.\r\nIt was impossible for him to do justice to this subject, as it stood\r\nbefore his mind and rested upon his own feelings, without entering\r\nsomewhat largely into the discussion of the recent policy of his own\r\nGovernment towards the Indians. To suppress the detail, would dilute\r\nthe whole into insipidity; to give it, would necessarily involve more\r\nor less of disclosure.\r\n\r\nThe principal considerations, which settled the Author’s purpose, in\r\nregard to the course he has pursued, are here submitted:--\r\n\r\n1. The fate of the American Indians, whether they shall exist or be\r\nannihilated, has come to a crisis.\r\n\r\n2. Their rights are properly the cause of humanity, and though well\r\ndefined in the conscience of _the world_, are yet undefined and\r\nunsettled in the _fact_ and operation of their social and political\r\nrelations; and these rights can only be fixed by a thorough public\r\ndiscussion before the world, which will claim to be arbiter in the\r\ncase, and which alone, as a community of nations, is likely to be a\r\nfair court of appeal. The question of their rights is so prominent and\r\ninteresting, that the world _will_ sit in judgment upon it; and the\r\nsooner their opinion is formed and expressed, the better. That judgment\r\ncan hardly be wrong; and it must also be respected and influential, if\r\nit comes in season. Indeed, the very anticipation of it, may possibly\r\nanswer all the purpose.\r\n\r\n3. The challenge of the attention of the British community to this\r\nsubject is especially proper, as they are involved in the same\r\nresponsibility with the United States, by having an equal number of\r\nIndians, more or less, upon their hands, in their North American\r\ncolonies; over whom their Colonial Governments are compelled to\r\nlegislate, and whose existence and future amelioration depend upon\r\nthe treatment they shall receive from those authorities. The Indians\r\nof the Canadas have no formal guarantee of their distinct rights,\r\nwhich they can assert against being removed at the pleasure of the\r\nColonial Governments; and whenever the white population crowds upon\r\nthem, they are subject to the same train of injuries, which have\r\nbeen suffered in the adjoining States. The Author ventures upon this\r\nstatement rather on the presumption afforded by the actual course of\r\nevents, than by his knowledge, that formal stipulations, defining\r\na different treatment, are actually wanting. If such stipulations\r\nexist, the course pursued is doubly aggravating, and no better, so\r\nfar as can be seen, than in the United States, except that the actual\r\nprogress of events has not attained so complete a developement. The\r\nAuthor has endeavoured to show, that the salvation of the Indians, as\r\na race, depends jointly upon Great Britain and the United States; and\r\ninasmuch as the crisis of their destiny has evidently arrived, it is\r\ndeemed proper and obligatory, that their case, with the history and\r\nnature of their wrongs, should be laid without disguise before the\r\ntwo communities--unless their doom must be considered as unavoidably\r\nforestalled, and themselves abandoned to annihilation.\r\n\r\nWhile the sympathies of the British nation are being roused--nay, are\r\nactually alive and thoroughly challenged in behalf of the _black_\r\nslave, it is perhaps the fittest moment to incorporate with the same\r\nfeelings the congenial sentiments of compassion for the _red_ man\r\nof America, whose unfortunate destiny hitherto has actually been\r\ncontrolled as much by British influence in former ages, as that of the\r\nAfrican slave. If Great Britain is responsible for the redemption of\r\n800,000 degraded and enslaved blacks, she is also responsible for a\r\nkind treatment and for the social and political elevation of perhaps\r\nhalf that number of a people, whose condition, though nominally more\r\nindependent, is scarcely less unfortunate; and whose misfortunes have\r\nbeen induced by the encroachments and political measures of their\r\nwhite neighbours. If the slaves of the British colonies have dwindled\r\nin numbers, and the increase of nature been stifled in the womb, by\r\ndirect and positive oppression, the American Indians have also dwindled\r\nmost fearfully by influences, more indirect perhaps, but scarcely less\r\ncruel and involving no less of responsibility; and a responsibility,\r\nwhich attaches alike and equally to the Government of Great Britain, as\r\nto that of America. As the original sin of African slavery in the west\r\nconfessedly fastens on the British crown, so the original institution\r\nof Indian relations to civilized society in North America was organized\r\nand fashioned by the same authority. And as for this reason, it was\r\nnot unbefitting, that the British crown should be first in the work of\r\nredeeming the slave, the door is equally open for British virtue to\r\nlend its sympathies and display its energies in behalf of the American\r\nAborigines. It is time at least that an expression of public sentiment\r\nshould be given on this great question of philanthropy. If it is true,\r\nthat _now_ is the time to redeem the slave; it is no less true, that\r\n_now_ is the time to save the American Indian. And inasmuch, as the\r\nBritish public have a duty incumbent upon them in this matter, in\r\ncommon with the Americans, it has been thought pertinent by the Author\r\nto lay this subject before them; although from the necessity of his\r\ntask, his strictures on the unjust treatment of the Indians have been\r\nprincipally confined to the Government of his own country.\r\n\r\n4. Inasmuch as the recent measures of the American Government, in\r\nrelation to the Indians, are before the world, and must necessarily\r\nmake their impression, the Author has considered that a substantial\r\nhistory of the case in its principal details, and an exposure of the\r\ngreat moral causes, which have induced this state of things, would\r\nrather be a relief, than a cloud over the reputation of his country\r\nin this particular. Nothing could possibly be more unfavourable,\r\nthan the impression of the GRAND FACT _unexplained_; and that could\r\nnever be repressed, or in any way concealed. The reader, who shall be\r\nsufficiently interested to go over these pages, will find here and\r\nthere the historical and moral _rationale_ of this great question and\r\nits results; by which it will appear, that the _denouement_ stands\r\nrelated to influences, most of them remote and controlling, which do\r\nnot at all affect the character of the institutions of the country, and\r\nwhich no more determine the disposition of the people.\r\n\r\nA sentiment is indeed expressed in a document of the Appendix from the\r\nGovernor of Georgia, that the recent election of the officers of the\r\nGeneral Government has not only approved the policy of removing the\r\nIndians, but sanctioned the course of Georgia towards the Cherokees.\r\nThat justification, however, is to be regarded merely as _convenient_\r\nin the circumstances, and not as containing valid reasons. It might be\r\nand no doubt is true, that in the recent election, the dominant party\r\nof the Union were blinded by their leaders on the _Indian question_;\r\nbut it is not true, that the sober voice of the nation, enlightened\r\nby the facts and merits of the case, has ever been expressed. There\r\nhas neither been opportunity for them to be informed, nor time for\r\nthem to act, upon it. The result of the election was owing entirely to\r\nother and great questions. If the Indian question were the only one\r\nto influence the public mind in a general election, and the people\r\ncould have opportunity to be fairly and fully enlightened, the Author\r\ndoes not believe that one voice in ten thousand would sustain the more\r\nviolent measures, which have recently been pursued, and which he in\r\nconscience has been obliged to disapprove.\r\n\r\nThe Author has considered it suitable and due to the cause of truth,\r\nthat the world should understand, that the American people, _as a\r\nbody_, would never sanction this course of treatment of the Indians,\r\nwhich is here assumed as injurious; that, being taken by surprise,\r\nit was impossible for a whole people, embarrassed by other and\r\nall-absorbing questions, to apply an immediate remedy; that so far as\r\nthey have been informed, they have already expressed their strongest\r\nsympathy; that nothing could remonstrate more loudly, or speak more\r\neloquently, than the demonstrations of public feeling, already\r\nmade; that the people have been compelled to wait for a decision of\r\nthe Supreme Judiciary of the nation, and for the operation of that\r\ndecision; and that the general election was controlled by other\r\nquestions, before the people could possibly be enlightened on this. And\r\nnow that that decision has been obtained, it is producing its proper\r\ninfluence, as the standard of public opinion.\r\n\r\nWhile the Author has wished and tried to declare himself prudently,\r\nhe has deemed it proper to do it decidedly. The injuries done to the\r\nIndians he has considered of a nature not to be parleyed with, and for\r\nwhich no apology can be made. He has considered, that a frank exposure\r\nand a full confession of the wrong would be more honourable to his\r\ncountry, than any attempts at concealment; that the wound inflicted on\r\nthe nation’s reputation cannot be aggravated by such a course; that\r\nthe proofs of the susceptibilities of the people to sympathize in\r\nthese wrongs and to repair them, so far as possible, are shewn partly\r\nin their readiness to confess them; that the public opinion of the\r\nworld, seasonably expressed, or anticipated, must necessarily be no\r\nunimportant ingredient in the measure of redeeming influences; and\r\nthat the best friends of the nation and of the Indians ought not to be\r\nidentified with the _few_, who have happened, in the course of events,\r\nto obtain a controlling influence, though it is believed transiently,\r\nover the whole affair. The decision of the Supreme Court may fairly\r\nbe taken, as an expression of the _will_ of the people, when it can\r\nbe legitimately developed. For these and such reasons the Author has\r\nconsidered it proper to exhibit enough of detail to lay open the\r\ngeneral subject historically, and to express his own opinion without\r\nreserve.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Author thinks it due to himself to observe, that he has never\r\nbeen connected, nor in any way personally interested, in either of\r\nthe great political parties of his country; nor is he conscious of\r\nbeing influenced by party feeling in the production of this work. He\r\nsympathizes generally with the principles, on which his own Government\r\nis administered, and cherishes a respect for the men at its head.\r\nBut on the _Indian question_ he is conscientiously and _toto cœlo_ at\r\nvariance with their views. And it is because he loves the institutions\r\nof his country and wishes to see the national constitution and public\r\ntreaties preserved inviolate; and because, from personal observation\r\nand knowledge, he has been obliged to feel a deep sympathy for the\r\nIndians, in view of what he esteems encroachment on their rights--that\r\nhe has undertaken the task embodied in these pages, and endeavoured\r\nto separate between Indian wrongs and the legitimate operation of the\r\nGovernment. And so long as he finds himself in company with the Supreme\r\nCourt of the nation, he will at least feel himself well sustained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, that the reader may feel, that too much of the\r\nsecond volume is occupied in discussion, and in the refutation of\r\ncertain doctrines and statements there encountered from the North\r\nAmerican Review. The Author, wishing to avoid personality as much as\r\npossible, has omitted to bring out the authority of that article.\r\nIt may be proper, however, here to mention, that it originated from\r\na high source in the Government--a source now at the head of Indian\r\naffairs--and may fairly be taken as the creed of principles, by which\r\nthose affairs are at present governed. This fact may perhaps be a\r\nsufficient apology for giving the argument so extended a consideration.\r\nAnd while the Author has felt obliged to treat some of the doctrines\r\nthere advanced with severity, he most cheerfully expresses his high\r\nconsideration for the personal character of his adversary, and for\r\nhis public official career, in all that does not respect the use and\r\napplication of the principles here contested. In that matter the\r\nAuthor must stand at variance, from a full conviction, not only of the\r\nIndian’s susceptibility of being raised, in intellectual, moral, and\r\ncivil improvements, to command an equal respect with any other race\r\nof men--but also from a no less decided conviction of the Indian’s\r\nunqualified and just demand to be admitted to an equality of social and\r\npolitical rights;--and more especially, that the Indian should realize\r\nthe full benefit of all the public engagements, that have been made in\r\nhis favour and for the attainment of these objects.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs one of the moral causes, which have operated in the United States\r\nto the detriment of Indian rights, the Author has felt obliged, from\r\nhis own convictions, to specify the paramount influence of slavery.\r\nIt is well known, that ancient impulses of a vicious tendency, in\r\nthe constitution of human society, will often continue to operate\r\ndisastrously, even after they have been checked by the incipient\r\nstages of reformation. Such is emphatically the case with slavery.\r\nIt is undoubtedly true, that the American Colonization Society has\r\nbegun to shed a most benign influence on the slavery of that country.\r\nIt has forced into public and universal discussion a question, which\r\nthe National Legislature, by the constitution of the Government,\r\ncould never touch--inasmuch as every several State is left by that\r\ninstrument, as sovereign and independent, in regard to all State\r\nprerogatives, not surrendered in the Federal compact, as any foreign\r\nnations are in relation to each other. But the Colonization Society\r\nhas commenced a career of extended and rapidly increasing influence,\r\nwhich has already affected essentially and radically the moral elements\r\nof society in the Southern and Slave States, in relation to slavery.\r\nAnd notwithstanding, that the influence of ancient impulses of this\r\nvicious character has doubtless operated to the violation of Indian\r\nrights--it is no less true, that a slavery reformation has already\r\ncommenced and extensively infused its leaven throughout the mass of the\r\nSlave States, by the instrumentality of the above-named institution.\r\nWhile, therefore, the one agency is stated, as the result of remote\r\ninfluences, for the time being uncontrolled in this, as well as in\r\nother directions, it is not to be considered as impossible with the\r\ncontemporaneous existence and increasing influence of the other. The\r\nformer may have and doubtless has produced the effect ascribed to it,\r\nwhile the latter is gaining an ascendency, which at a later period\r\nwould entirely have prevented this deplorable issue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Author has been aware, that these volumes will afford some\r\nadditional elements for those strictures and censures on the American\r\nRepublic, which have been so liberally and customarily rendered by\r\na portion of the British press. And while much has often been made\r\nof little and much out of nothing, these, it must be confessed, are\r\nnot altogether unsubstantial materials for the gratification of such\r\nfeelings. While the Author has undertaken in another place, as may\r\npossibly be known to some extent, to rebuke a disposition to find fault\r\nwhere there was no reason for it, he will perhaps have proved in this\r\ninstance, that he would not cover a real sin even in his own house,\r\nwhen the rights of communities and the cause of humanity demand a\r\ndevelopement. Those whom these disclosures may gratify, are freely\r\noffered all which they afford; while the discriminating and the fair\r\nwill doubtless view and present the case, as it is, if they shall be\r\ndisposed to notice it at all:--they will not tax the institutions of\r\nthe country, nor the disposition of the people, as a body, with the\r\niniquity--while it may still be fairly maintained, that the nation is\r\nresponsible and bound before the world and heaven to make atonement.\r\n\r\nIt does not well become one nation to be accusing another of\r\noppressions and violence, merely for the sake of elevating itself by\r\ncomparison, when both, in the present imperfect state and imperfect\r\noperation of their institutions, have their faults of this description.\r\nBetter, that the common cause of freedom and humanity should be made a\r\ncommon interest among the advocates of right throughout the world, that\r\nany case of the violation of right might be widely and freely exposed,\r\nand universally reprobated. Certainly, in the matter constituting a\r\nprominent subject of these pages, Great Britain and America are too\r\ndeeply involved to furnish a warrant for crimination on either side.\r\n\r\nThe community of nations is rapidly assuming a character like a\r\ncommunity of individuals; and for the same reasons, that the latter\r\nhave a common right in determining the social relations and defining\r\nthe modes of intercourse, the former should openly and freely\r\ndiscuss and socially determine _their_ relations. As every member\r\nof a community of individuals may rightfully have a voice in all\r\nthe regulations enacted for the common good--so every member of the\r\ncommunity of nations is interested in the code of international law,\r\nand may fairly claim its right in the discussion and settlement of\r\nfundamental principles;--and since, when any member of the minor\r\ncommunity is injured, it is a proper subject of public alarm and\r\ninvestigation, so when the rights of any nation, or tribe, are\r\nviolated, it makes a legitimate ground for a common adjudication, at\r\nleast for the interchange and expression of opinion, and the employment\r\nof influence. We have high authority for the saying: “When one member\r\nsuffers, all the members suffer with it;” they ought certainly to\r\nsympathize.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, that the scene of the first volume is laid on the\r\nAmerican Lakes and in the North-West Territory. The latter is a civil\r\ndivision of the American jurisdiction, lying on the upper waters of\r\nthe Mississippi river and the shores of Lakes Superior and Michigan,\r\nand not on the Pacific Ocean, as is sometimes, and in foreign parts\r\nperhaps more commonly, understood by this name.\r\n\r\nThe Author feels obliged to say, that, not having anticipated the\r\nexecution of this task, before he came to England, he has found\r\nhimself wanting in many important documents, which would have been a\r\nmaterial improvement of the work, and rendered it far more complete.\r\nThe Indian speeches delivered at the council of Green Bay, once in his\r\npossession and taken down by his own hand, were left behind. To supply\r\nthis defect, he has taken the liberty of constructing a few specimens,\r\nas nearly after the manner of the Indians, as his impressions and\r\nrecollections would enable him to do. And while it is due to historical\r\nverity to make this acknowledgment, the Author may perhaps be permitted\r\nto say, without a breach of modesty, that having once made a copy of\r\nall those transactions at the time and as they occurred, together with\r\nthe speeches that were delivered by the Indians, and having been long\r\nin habits of intimate intercourse with them, in public and private,\r\nhe ought to be qualified to do them something like justice in such a\r\ntrifling attempt. He may also add, that having on various occasions\r\ncomplied with the requests of the Indians to assist them in their\r\ncommunications with the official agents of Government, he necessarily\r\nbecame acquainted with their peculiarities of thought, and feeling,\r\nand modes of speech. One of their chiefs paid the Author the following\r\ncompliment to the point in question, at the city of Washington, on\r\nthe occasion of soliciting him to draw up an address to the Senate of\r\nthe United States in their behalf: “You talk our talk better than we\r\ncan talk it for ourselves.” This, however, merely to shew, that the\r\nauthor has had some custom in speaking for them. The examples given\r\nin the chapter above alluded to, are offered, as _things like_ what\r\nthey stand for; and the Author is confident, that the _likeness_ would\r\nbe acknowledged even by the Indians themselves. At the same time,\r\nthat they support the Indian _argument_, (the one ascribed to the\r\nWinnebago-Chief only excepted, which is a pure invention to exemplify\r\nthe wild incoherency, which sometimes characterizes savage oratory,)\r\nthey are also intended as specimens of that simplicity of thought\r\nand reasoning, which the Indians are accustomed to demonstrate. The\r\ncivilized Indians of the New York tribes at Green Bay reason quite as\r\nwell, as the Author has represented.\r\n\r\nThe other specimens of Indian speeches, the Author is not responsible\r\nfor. They are extracts from authorities, to which they are ascribed.\r\n\r\nAs the Rev. Mr. Williams, of the Oneida tribe, occupies a conspicuous\r\nplace in this work, the Author begs leave to say, that some very\r\ntrivial errors may possibly occur in the notices taken of him,--but\r\nnot material. The conversations and remarks ascribed to Mr. Williams,\r\nand in one place an extended part of a colloquy with the Author,\r\nin which he appears as the principal speaker, are a compressed and\r\ncomprehensive statement of the substance of numerous communications,\r\nreduced principally from recollection. The Author would not, therefore,\r\nmake Mr. Williams responsible for every expression, that may be found\r\nin these conversations, as coming from him. All the Author can pretend\r\nis, that he has endeavoured faithfully to transcribe the copy afforded\r\nby his memory, in the selections made. The exact original forms of\r\ncommunication could not of course be expected.\r\n\r\nIt is possible also, that some other of the historical and narrative\r\nportions of the first volume may not have made exactly the same\r\nimpressions on the minds of other witnesses, as are recorded by the\r\nAuthor. He does not think, however, that these differences could be\r\nnumerous, or in any degree important.\r\n\r\nIt will doubtless seem remarkable, that Indian wrongs in America could\r\nhave proceeded so far without more public remonstrance and without the\r\napplication of a remedy. But it may easily be seen, that a civilized\r\nand powerful government, having come in contact and formed permanent\r\nrelations with barbarous, or semi-barbarous, and consequently inferior,\r\nand in some respects, dependent tribes, may have practised, or suffered\r\nto be practised, long continued and petty oppressions, necessarily\r\nvexatious and destructive to the subjects, before they have come to\r\nthe notice of the world, so as to shock essentially the moral sense\r\nof mankind. Where have such relations existed without these results?\r\nSuppose the book of history, detailing things of this kind, that have\r\noccurred in the East Indies for ages past, were open to the world?\r\nThe _little_ that has transpired may be enough to _suggest_ what\r\nremains untold. It is only when acts of injustice, or of cruelty, more\r\natrocious, occur, that the attention and sympathies of mankind are\r\nroused.\r\n\r\nBesides, injustice is more apparent when the temper of the age is mild,\r\nand the state of the world comparatively quiet. The better part of\r\nmankind can see it more distinctly, and a better opportunity is given\r\nto expose it. Injustice, when estimated by the proper rule, is always\r\nthe same. But it is not always the same thing in men’s minds. That\r\nwhich would have been a trifle in one age, or in one part of the world,\r\nmay be an enormity in another.\r\n\r\nIt was not till recently, within four to six years--more especially\r\nwithin four--that the more flagrant acts of injustice toward the\r\nAmerican Indians, have challenged public attention. And, as has been\r\nbefore remarked, it has not been possible, within this period and in\r\nexisting circumstances, to bring in a remedy. The current of mischief\r\nwas too wide and deep and strong to be arrested, or turned in a day.\r\n\r\n    _London, June, 1833._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TOUR, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE FALLS OF NIAGARA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho has not heard of Niagara Falls? And he who has been there, if he\r\npossesses ought of a relish for the grand and awful, if he can admire\r\nthe way and love the voice of God, will never lose the impressions of\r\nthe scene. The mountain has its majestic forms. But its eloquence,\r\nthough impressive, is silent, except when the storm begins to move upon\r\nits head, and roar along its sides, and brush its everlasting crags,\r\nand bellow over the mouths of its caverns; or when the avalanche comes\r\nthundering from its brow to worship at its feet; and he who happens\r\nto be there perchance shall never come away. The wilderness has its\r\nromantic and unexplored solitudes, and the desert its interminable\r\nwastes, or its burning sirocco; but there is no comfort to exempt the\r\nmind from external annoyances. The ocean, tempest-tossed, prepares in\r\nthe deep a watery shroud for the body by the same hand, with which\r\nit proffers a festival of sublimity to the soul. With him who has\r\ngone safely through, the very contingencies of his passage may indeed\r\naugment the power and add intensity to the character of his emotions,\r\nwhile hanging in retrospect over the recollections of his peril. Still\r\nthere was peril--and with peril there is pain.\r\n\r\nBut not so in the peaceful retreat of Niagara’s eternal cataract. There\r\nthe mind may rest from anxiety. The spectator may sit, and see, and\r\nhear, and never grow weary of the scene. He may change his position. He\r\nmay walk along the banks of the majestic current, from the entrance of\r\nChippewa’s dark waters, following its course, and witnessing how the\r\nflood begins to make haste. He may see the glassy surface beginning\r\nto be disturbed by the increased rapidity; and now the vast volume\r\nleaping a shelf, and showing the form of an ocean wave; and now leaping\r\nanother shelf, and another, and yet another, until the mighty torrent,\r\ndescending a steep declivity, bounds over its broken and craggy bed,\r\nitself as yet unbroken, so deep and measureless the flood. Then he\r\nmarks the earnestness, the very passion of its career, as if it were\r\nglad to burst at once from its confinements above, and eager to plunge\r\ninto the abyss below. He who has seen the troubled ocean after a\r\nstorm, has only to imagine those heaving billows descending a mountain\r\nside, himself looking up from below on their downward course, and it\r\nis the very picture presented from the table rock of Niagara, as the\r\nspectator, turning his back on the chasm, with the cataract immediately\r\non his left, faces the descending torrent, and lifts his eye on the\r\nmountain declivity of waters, which comes leaping, and rolling, and\r\ntumbling, as if from the clouds, or the azure heavens which peer above\r\nthe tops of the waves. And this only a preparation for the fall--a\r\ncollection and multiplication of forces for the stupendous leap. Next\r\nthe enrapt beholder turns his eye upon the curvilinear margin of the\r\nawful shelf; he bends to look downward from his giddy elevation, and\r\nthere an ocean of waters, which he had just seen rushing with most\r\nalarming impetuosity from above, now plunges into the abyss, as if\r\nto drive asunder the base of the hills. The firm rock, on which he\r\nstands, shudders--himself shudders, while the roar, and tumult, and\r\ntempest of the chasm send up their thunders to his ear, and drive the\r\ncurrents of their watery mist like the whirlwind in their windings and\r\nfitful moods, and with all the force of the tornado.\r\n\r\nHe may descend, if he will, (and he must be alike wanting in courage\r\nand taste if he declines) to the level which these waters have formed\r\nby their daring leap. There, housed beneath the impending and lofty\r\ncrag, itself jutting far out over the bosom of the deep, as if curious\r\nto witness more and all of the scene, himself may look _up_ on that\r\nwhich just now, bending from above, he had looked down upon. And now he\r\nhas before him nought but the mighty cataract, like an ocean, spilling\r\nitself in one vast sheet from those regions of the heavens, where the\r\nhighest stars are seen at night, and where the summer’s sun walks in\r\nhis strength at mid-day. And let him not fear the whirling eddies of\r\nthe suspended waters, thrown out from the thickest of the tumult, and\r\ndashing upon him now their softer mists, and now their sheets of a\r\ndriving storm. He should brave all this, and more, if he would see\r\nwhat every brave man should see. He must take the hand of a competent\r\nguide, and make his circuit over the broken fragments of the rocks, far\r\nround and underneath the projecting and awful shelf, over which the\r\nmighty tide takes its final plunge. And when perchance an eddying blast\r\nshall burst upon him, he must hug the rock till its transient fury is\r\nexhausted, and then push on, still resorting to the same expedient on\r\nthe recurrence of a like exigency, until he has gone as far as man may\r\ndare to go, and turns and sits him down to face the inner face of this\r\nstrange vision. Then, indeed, he will find himself in the midst of an\r\nawful tempest, menaced and assaulted on all sides by whirlwind blasts,\r\nand enlightened only with the light which the whitened foam reflects on\r\nthat dark cavern; but still in safe condition, except the rare chance\r\nof the fall of some fragment of the rocks above, for ever oppressed and\r\nshaken as they are by the superincumbent and rushing flood. Of that,\r\nhowever, he must not think; in such predicament it were unpleasant. The\r\nlast fall of the kind, a few years since, which brought ten thousand\r\ntons, or more, in a single mass, happened in the night,--and so may\r\nthe next; and the next may be centuries to come. Let him rather make\r\nthe best of his daring; and not only be able to say that _he_ has been\r\nthere, but feel that it was a rare and enviable privilege. Who can\r\nwell imagine the wild commotion and deafening uproar of the scene?\r\nThe loudest piping of the ocean blast, and the fiercest march of its\r\nmountain wave, are a mere lullaby song to the thunder of this encounter.\r\n\r\nThe visitor will not fail to cross to the _American_ side, as it is\r\ncalled,--as though Canada were not in America. And this vice is well\r\nenough understood here, where it originated--or rather the compliment\r\ndone to the United States and her citizens, by making them the\r\nrepresentatives of the entire continent, and alluding to them, as\r\nif they were its sole lords and occupants. Are the United States so\r\nimportant, as to be entitled to this high distinction of standing for\r\n_America_, and that _Americans_ should every where be the _synonyme_ of\r\ncitizens of that republic? What accident has given so small a portion\r\nof that world such a prominence?\r\n\r\nThe notices we have already taken of Niagara Falls have been from the\r\nCanada side, which are altogether most interesting, and the views most\r\nsublime. For a relief of the almost painful emotions, by which the mind\r\nof the beholder has been exercised,--at one time excited in admiration,\r\nnow rapt in ecstacy, and now overwhelmed by the mingled effect of\r\ngrandeur and tumult and fury,--let him throw himself into a small boat\r\non the bosom of Niagara, directly under the Falls, where, conscious of\r\nsafety, though tossed like a feather in the fitful wind by the boilings\r\nof that unfathomable _linn_, or basin, where the waters, which a moment\r\nbefore sprung in such mighty volume from the brow of yonder precipice,\r\nnow heave and roll and break in eddies of fearful aspect, as if to\r\ngive expression to their pain and agony, or vent to the joy of their\r\nescape;--on such a sea of foam, where the last breath of the conflict\r\nis evidently spent, and the agitated element labouring to be composed,\r\nhe may rest and float secure, and look at the base, and look midway,\r\nand lift his eye to the summit of that unceasing, never-dying cataract.\r\nHe may estimate its superficial dimensions, he may imagine its depth,\r\nand wonder still at its roar and tumult. From the same position he may\r\nturn his eye to the left of _Goat Island_, on the _American_ side, and\r\nwitness a still more lofty cataract, but more modest, not yet presuming\r\nto assert such profound pretensions, descending in a silvery sheet, as\r\nif from an artificial shelf, connecting the island with the shore; and\r\ndashing on the rocks below, displays a vast bed of fleecy whiteness,\r\nlike a storm of the thickest and purest snow, reflected by the sun.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the rapids, about one mile from the Falls in direct\r\nline, but from two to three miles by the line of the Canada shore,\r\nthe river is divided by the island above named, turning, perhaps,\r\none-tenth of the current to the American side. This smaller portion\r\nwould be a great river by itself--and the channel through which it\r\ndescends, and the final plunge of its waters, are in many respects more\r\nromantic, though less grand and awful, than the course and fall of the\r\nprincipal torrent. The shelf of the cataract on the American side is\r\nto the eye and in fact higher than the point of the _Horse Shoe_, as\r\nit is called, where is the greatest depth and force of the river, as\r\nit leaps from the precipice. This single feature of superior elevation\r\ngives advantage to the American side, and in this particular it stands\r\ninvested in a more majestic form. But the deep, and comparatively\r\nunperturbed current descending from the Horse Shoe, suggests the\r\nvastness of its volume, imparts to it the highest consideration, and\r\nchains the mind with the intensest interest.\r\n\r\nBy the noble enterprise of a wealthy individual, Judge Porter, a bridge\r\nhas been thrown across from the American shore to Goat Island, directly\r\nover the most impetuous current of the rapids, and but a few rods\r\nabove the fall--an almost incredible achievement of human art, and\r\nof human power over natural obstacles. To facilitate the undertaking,\r\nthere happened to be the natural abutment of an islet midway the\r\nchannel, saving the necessity of more than two or three additional\r\nones, which were sunk and secured at great expense and difficulty. By\r\nthis means, this heretofore inaccessible island, covered with wood,\r\na most beautiful and romantic retreat, has been opened to free and\r\neasy access; and one of the most advantageous views of the Falls is\r\nto be gained from its brow, hanging between the two cataracts. The\r\npassage across this bridge is somewhat frightful, from the rapidity\r\nof the current, and the startling thought of hanging suspended over a\r\ntorrent, so fiercely dashing onward, to leap the next moment from such\r\na giddy height. The mind at once begins to calculate the chances of\r\nsome accident to the bridge. The bare possibility of the sudden slide\r\nof a pier, over which you stand, from the face of the rock, on which\r\nit rests, and the inevitable consequence, shocks the feelings with the\r\nshuddering sensation of horror; and the hastened step of the passenger\r\nwill sufficiently indicate the involuntary impulse by which he has been\r\novertaken. No one, however, should deny himself the gratification of\r\nvisiting the island. It is like as if a bridge had been made to the\r\nmoon, once as unexpected, and deemed alike impossible.\r\n\r\nThe views and aspects of this great wonder of nature are susceptible\r\nof almost infinite change by the change of position: and there it is,\r\nthe same great work of God for ever and for ever, in constant life\r\nand motion. There is no curtain to hide the exhibition--there is no\r\nmachinery in it, the wires of which are subject to human control. Its\r\nfountains are never dried, its torrents are never, like other floods,\r\nincreased or diminished. There it is, the same for ever and for ever.\r\nNotwithstanding a world of waters have fallen this hour, a world of\r\nwaters shall fall the next hour. To-morrow shall be as this day, and a\r\ncentury to come as a century past. The lover of nature’s magnificence\r\nand nature’s beauties may wander there without fear of satiety--with\r\never growing and yet a keener appetite. He may choose his bed on the\r\nbrow of the chasm, and near the fearful plunge, so that the walls of\r\nhis habitation, and the couch on which he reposes, shall sympathise\r\nwith the ceaseless vibrations of the earth and rocks, and himself\r\nliterally be rocked to sleep by the hand and music of the mighty\r\nwaters. In his half-waking moments he shall know, because he will\r\nfeel, that he is there. In the visions of his deepest slumbers, still\r\nshaken by the concussions of all nature around, he shall be admonished,\r\nthat he is there. Of that which he saw by day he shall dream by\r\nnight--and he shall see it even then in forms of as much greater\r\nmagnificence, and of as much more attractive beauties, or dressed in\r\na wildness as much more amazing, as dreams are more remarkable, than\r\nthe sober thoughts of a wakeful hour. He may rise in the morning, and\r\nvisit the scene with ever fresh delight; and at noon, and when the sun\r\ndeclines, and by the light of the moon, or under the stars alone, or\r\nwhen the tempest scowls at midnight hour, and mingles its thunders with\r\nthe thunders of the abyss in rival effort, and lays the broad sheets\r\nof its fire on the foam of the waters: and he will never say--it is\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE WHIRLPOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Niagara Falls, long familiar with their various features, as above\r\ndescribed, the author of these pages took it in his head to make a\r\ndistant excursion, in the summer of 1830, into the wild regions of the\r\n_North West_, tenanted principally by _savages_, as they are commonly\r\ncalled, but more reverently by the _aboriginal_ inhabitants of North\r\nAmerica. The method selected of getting there was by the Lakes, and the\r\npoint of embarkation, Buffalo.\r\n\r\nIt is proper, perhaps, for the information of the British reader, to\r\ndescribe, briefly, the map and geographical relations of this region.\r\nThere are probably few who have looked upon the map of North America,\r\nthat have not had the curiosity to ascertain the situation of Niagara\r\nFalls. And they have found them upon that current, which connects Lake\r\nOntario with Lake Erie, called Niagara river, and in length about\r\nthirty miles--it being one of the channels in connexion, by which\r\nthe waters of that vast and notorious chain of inland seas, in North\r\nAmerica, are disembogued into the gulf of St. Lawrence, and thence\r\ninto the Atlantic. The Falls are distant ten miles from the southern\r\nmargin of Lake Ontario, and twenty miles from the foot of Lake Erie,\r\nand four miles south of Queenston and Lewiston heights, the latter\r\nconstituting the elevation, or brow above Lake Ontario, down which the\r\nwaters of Lake Erie must plunge in their way to the ocean. And the\r\ndeep chasm between the falls and the heights, occupied by the river\r\nafter its fall, four miles in length, before the agitated current\r\nfinds a breathing place in the open plains below, and prepares itself\r\nto glide placidly into the lake, is supposed by geologists to have\r\nbeen formed by the wear and tear of this tremendous cataract, for a\r\nsuccession of ages not to be counted. For the geologist, especially if\r\nhe be a Frenchman, does not deem himself obliged to regard the world’s\r\nhistory, as suggested by the scriptural account of the Deluge, and of\r\nthe antediluvian periods. Doubtless, if the wear of this chasm is to be\r\nestimated by its progress since known to the present civilized world,\r\nand according to this theory, it will be quite necessary to resort to\r\nsome such authority as the Chinese historical records, or to the theory\r\nof a philosopher’s brain, to solve this geological problem.[2]\r\n\r\nIt may not be uninteresting, however, before we enter more extensively\r\ninto our geographical lesson, that a moment here should be occupied in\r\nallusion to a Whirlpool, which is to be found in this part of Niagara\r\nriver, a little more than half way from the Falls to Queenston, and\r\nwhich of its kind is not less remarkable than the Falls themselves.\r\nAt this point, the river, in its compressed, deep, and rapid career,\r\nmakes a sudden turn, or sharp angle, the effect of which has been to\r\nwear out and form a basin of considerable extent in a precipitous bank\r\ntwo hundred feet high, in which the waters of the river, as they come\r\nrushing from above, take a sweep before they can escape by the angle,\r\nwhich interrupts the channel, and find their passage in a downward\r\ncourse:--by which it will be seen, that a plural number of currents at\r\nthis point must necessarily cross each other between the surface and\r\nthe bed of the river, in the formation of this remarkable phenomenon.\r\nIt uniformly happens, in the great variety of floating materials,\r\ndescending the river, such as logs and lumber of various sorts, that\r\nportions of it are detained for days, and sometimes for weeks, sweeping\r\nthe circuit of this basin, and every few moments returning by the draft\r\nof the whirlpool, and as they approach the vortex, are drawn in with\r\ngreat rapidity, and submerged to descend no one knows how deep, until\r\nby-and-by, following the currents, they appear again on the surface of\r\nthe basin, to make the same circuit, and again to be drawn into the\r\nsame vortex. It has sometimes happened, that the bodies of persons who\r\nhave had the misfortune to get into the rapids above the Falls, and\r\nto be drawn down the awful cataract, or who have been drowned between\r\nthe two points, after the usual process of decomposition has lightened\r\ntheir specific gravity, and raised them to the surface, have been seen\r\nfor days floating around this whirlpool, and making the customary and\r\nsuccessive plunges, to which every thing, that comes within its reach,\r\nis doomed without the possibility of rescue.\r\n\r\nIt also happened, during the last war between the United States and\r\nGreat Britain, (may there never be another contest so unnatural) that\r\na British soldier upon a raft of palisades, which had been cut on the\r\nmargin of this basin for the fortifications at Queenston, was sent\r\nadrift into this whirlpool by the parting of a rope connected with\r\nthe shore, in the attempt to float the raft out of the basin into the\r\nriver below. The force of the currents not being duly estimated, as the\r\nraft approached the vortex, drawn by the hands of other soldiers on\r\nshore, and claiming a passage at what was deemed a prudent distance,\r\nthe too feeble cord snapped asunder to the amazement and horror, not\r\nonly of the unfortunate man afloat, but equally of his comrades, who\r\nwere compelled, without any means or hope of extending relief, to\r\nwitness the unhappy fate of the devoted victim. In a moment the raft\r\nwas seen careering with increased rapidity towards the visible and open\r\ncentre of the whirling waters, where its immediate and total wreck was\r\njustly deemed inevitable; and down it went, and the man upon it, with\r\n“convulsive splash,” and now nothing was seen. The spectators shrieked\r\nin sympathy. A soldier has his fellow feeling. For he is a man. Had\r\ntheir comrade fallen in battle, they might have trampled on his carcass\r\nin the onset of a charge, in disregard of his sufferings. And when\r\nthey should come to bury him, they might say: “Thou hast died nobly.”\r\nBut that he should be thus unexpectedly and fearfully swallowed up\r\nby the flood, their nerves were ill prepared for the shock. He was\r\ngone, and with his disappearance disappeared all hope. But what was\r\ntheir surprise, while, with vacant stare and every feeling astounded,\r\ntheir feet fixed immoveably to the earth, they gazed upon the scene,\r\nthe raft entire, and their comrade clinging to it, suddenly shot up\r\non the surface of the waters, and seemed to be floating back to their\r\nembrace. “Well done! bravo!” they cried, rending the pent up region\r\nwith their gratulations, and clapping their hands and leaping for joy.\r\nAlas! instead of making towards the shore, or coming within reach of\r\nthe throw of a line, (for every one was now in stretch of all his\r\npowers to afford relief, and the unfortunate man crying for help,) the\r\nraft was borne irresistibly along the current before described, and in\r\na few moments began again its rapid sweep towards the vortex. Again\r\nthe men on shore were thrilled with horror in expectancy of the fate\r\nof their companion--and he, smiting his breast in despair, fell upon\r\nhis knees, lifting his face towards heaven, and seemed to be making\r\nhis last commendations of himself to the mercy of God, and the next\r\nmoment down again he plunged, and was swallowed up in the deep. His\r\ncomrades stood still, and gazed upon the vacant waters, awaiting in\r\nbreathless anxiety the emergence of the severed fragments of the raft.\r\nFor, notwithstanding it had been firmly bound together to conflict with\r\nthe violent forces of the passage, there was little reason to expect\r\nthat it would sustain unbroken the second shock of such encounter, as\r\nthat to which it was now doomed; much less, that their luckless comrade\r\nwould appear again adhering to its parts. Nevertheless, to their\r\nunspeakable joy, the raft and the man emerged as before. The welcome\r\nof this second preservation for a moment rekindled hope, and suggested\r\nevery possible expedient to accomplish a connexion between the shore\r\nand the raft. But all in vain. The unfortunate man, in the agony of\r\nhis despair, supplicated their aid. But what could they do? Again,\r\nthe raft and its yet living tenant were on their wheeling and rapid\r\ncircuit towards the fearful vortex. Again he fell upon his knees--and\r\nagain plunged into the deep, and disappeared. Who now could hope in\r\nsuch a case?--Even if he should emerge again, it would only be to make\r\nthe same round, and fall again into the power of the same merciless\r\nand insatiate appetite. Yet he did emerge, and bade farewell to his\r\ncomrades, and they bade farewell to him: “God bless you!” said he.\r\n“God have mercy on you!” said they, in broken accents. “God have mercy\r\non me!” he cried--and again he disappeared in the whirl of the waters.\r\n\r\nThe story is too painful. How much more so--how indescribably\r\nagonizing, even to the soldier inured to the sight of death, to have\r\nwitnessed the scene! This was a new, an unknown form of death. It was\r\ndeath inflicted, and life brought back, only to die again, and again\r\nto live to face death again--and yet again. How dreadful to those who\r\nsaw! How much more dreadful to the sufferer! For them to see him, and\r\nnot to be able to help him--for him to approach and face the aspects of\r\nthat doom for _once_--we will not undertake to say what it was. To have\r\nonce _experienced_ all its horrors, and then to be brought again before\r\nit, and to be compelled to taste it in such quick and rapid succession,\r\nand each repetition being more horrible by the experimental knowledge\r\nof what it is--who can conceive of it! The Norwegian maelstrom is\r\nawful to think of. But the ship, that is drawn into it, returns no\r\nmore. Suppose the current of some boiling eddy should bring her to the\r\nsurface of the sea again, and her crew breathe again, only to face the\r\nsame horrors a second time--and a third! Would they not say: “O God,\r\nforbid the repetition, since we cannot live.” Such was the condition\r\nof our ill-fated victim of Niagara’s Whirlpool. Death took him into\r\nhis embrace, inflicted on him all its pangs, and then threw him back,\r\nas if in vengeance, only to draw one breath of life; and then grasped\r\nand tortured him again, then threw him back to life; and then stretched\r\nforth his hand, and seized him again. And at every approach, Death\r\nseemed to say: Behold, how terrible I am!\r\n\r\nDid he rise again?--Aye, he did. And if the story may be believed, the\r\nraft and the man continued this perpetual round, until the intelligence\r\nwas conveyed to Queenston, some three miles below, and a boat drawn out\r\nof the river, and transported on wheels, and launched from the lofty\r\nbank of two hundred feet, down through the trees upon the basin, and\r\nthe man was taken off to serve yet longer, and fight the battles of his\r\nking. And for aught that is known by us, he is still in his regiment.\r\nScores of times he faced the frowning terrors of the scene,--made the\r\ndeep plunge as many times,--took breath at every interval--and was\r\nsaved at last.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nGREAT LAKES OF NORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nLake Ontario, it should be understood, is the last in the chain of\r\nthose fresh water seas, on the bosoms of which the Author proposed\r\nto make his excursion into the North-West Territory. This lake lies\r\nbetween the British province of Upper Canada on the north, and the\r\nstate of New York on the south, being about two hundred miles in its\r\nlength, east and west, and some fifty or sixty in its greatest breadth.\r\nIt is a scene of active commerce; floats a great deal of shipping;\r\nsteam-packets of the largest burthen, and of the best accommodations,\r\nare constantly plying upon it; and the flags of hostile navies have\r\nwaved over its bosom, and challenged and sought the fierce encounter.\r\nThe keel of a ship of war, said at the time to be the largest in the\r\nworld, was laid at Sacket’s Harbour, in the state of New York, in the\r\nyear 1814, and some progress made in the building of it, before the\r\nnews of peace in February following. May it rot under the roof which\r\nnow covers it, before there shall ever be occasion for its launching!\r\nThe outlet of Lake Ontario is the beginning of the river St. Lawrence;\r\nand a little below are the famous rapids of that magnificent current,\r\nwhich make the scene of the Canadian Boat-song.\r\n\r\nLake Erie lies south-west of Lake Ontario, its eastern termination\r\nbeing at Buffalo, and running in a south-westerly course two hundred\r\nand fifty miles, in breadth seventy miles; having the most desirable\r\nagricultural regions of Upper Canada in the north, and parts of the\r\nstates of New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, on the south. This is also\r\na sea of busy commerce; and a memorable naval action has once been\r\ncontested on its waters: the result of which crowned the American\r\nCommodore Perry with distinguished honours. While Britannia claims\r\nthe pride of ruling the ocean, America may, perhaps, with modesty,\r\nassert supremacy on her own fresh-water seas. Better, however, that all\r\ncomparisons of this kind should be few and far between. The cultivation\r\nof the kinder feelings is as much more agreeable, as it is more\r\ndignified.\r\n\r\nThe next in the ascending chain is Lake St. Clair, thirty miles in\r\ndiameter, lying about half-way between Lake Erie on the south, and Lake\r\nHuron on the north, connected with the former by the river Detroit,\r\nand with the latter by the river bearing its own name, each current\r\nmeasuring a channel of some thirty miles in length. Lake Huron is\r\na great inland sea, of so many shapes, as to have no shape at all\r\ndefinable. From its outlet, into the river St. Clair on the south, to\r\nits head, into the Straits of Michilimackinack, in the north-west,\r\nis perhaps three hundred and fifty miles. Its greatest breadth is\r\nprobably about two hundred and fifty. It opens a vast sea for the safe\r\nnavigation of shipping of any burthen, besides affording a lodging\r\nplace for a world of islands in its northern regions, some larger and\r\nsome smaller--and most romantically situated in their relations to\r\neach other--amounting in all to the number of _thirty-two thousand_.\r\nThe innumerable bays and straits created by this cluster, most of them\r\nnavigable for almost any kind of craft, together with the islands\r\nthemselves, covered with forests, and shooting up the most perfect form\r\nof the pointed fir-tree, must present a rare vision to him who shall\r\never have the privilege of sailing over them in a baloon.\r\n\r\nLake Michigan is a beautiful sea, lying in the form of a calf’s tongue,\r\nexcept the single deformity of Green Bay, an arm of ninety miles in\r\nlength, and thirty to forty broad, running off from its west shoulder\r\nlike a lobster’s claw; the bay itself being of many and ugly shapes.\r\nAside from this, Lake Michigan is regular in its form, an open and\r\nnavigable sea, running from the straits of Michillimackinack on the\r\nnorth, (or, to save trouble, we will henceforth say _Mackinaw_, as the\r\nvulgar do), towards the south west about three hundred and fifty miles,\r\nits greatest and central breadth one hundred and fifty.[4]\r\n\r\nBut the Queen of fresh-water seas, all the world over, is Lake\r\nSuperior, most fitly named for its magnificent dimensions and relative\r\nimportance. Its length, from east to west, is seven hundred miles, and\r\nits greatest breadth, perhaps, three hundred. It is generally an open\r\nsea, and navigable to all its extremities, with a few important islands\r\nthrown upon its bosom, and some portions of the long circuit of its\r\nmargin studded, not unlike the northern shore of Lake Huron. This vast\r\ninland sea has its outlet into Lake Huron, by the Falls of St. Mary, at\r\nits eastern termination; or rather by a rapid of one mile in length,\r\nmaking a descent of twenty-two feet in that distance, and which might\r\neasily be overcome for the purposes of navigation, by a ship canal of\r\ntrifling expense. Apart from the occupation of these waters by the\r\nbark canoes of the aboriginal tribes, this lake, as yet, is used for\r\nlittle else than the fur trade, and has but a few vessels upon it. But\r\nthe masters of these vessels are familiar with all its regions. Lake\r\nSuperior, it will be seen, is the most remote of the seas we are now\r\ndescribing, as well as most magnificent. Its waters and its shores are\r\nthe least visited by civilized man. No law holds dominion there, but\r\nthe law of interest, or of passion. Its vast bosom, capable of floating\r\nnavies, and probably destined for such display, ordinarily bears only\r\nthe Indian bark upon its waves. The wild and romantic solitudes of its\r\nshores, and of the deep forests and unsurveyed territories, by which\r\nthey are bounded, as yet have been familiar only with the howl of the\r\nwild beasts, and little traced except by the devious track of the red\r\nman, who pursues his game to satiate his hunger; or by the sinuous\r\npaths of the warrior train, intent upon revenge, and thirsting for\r\nblood. The position of this lake, in relation to those of which mention\r\nhas been made, and to the occupied territories of the Canadas and of\r\nthe United States, is far off in the north-west.\r\n\r\nThe southern shore of Lake Superior is the northern boundary of a large\r\ncivil division of the United States, called the _North-West Territory_;\r\nwhere the events, which will occupy a large portion, and make the\r\nleading topic of these pages, transpired. The State of Illinois is on\r\nthe south of this territory; Lake Michigan on the east; and the river\r\nMississippi on the west; the whole region extending from north latitude\r\n42° 45’ to nearly 49° in its extreme border, around and beyond the\r\nwestern termination of Lake Superior; and comprehending in its longest\r\nline from east to west about nine degrees of longitude. The principal\r\nscene, however, of the events we are to notice, is laid on the eastern\r\nmargin of this territory, near the mouth of Fox River, at the head of\r\nGreen Bay.\r\n\r\nBut why this lesson in geography? That all concerned may know where\r\nthey are, and understand, as much as may be convenient, the relations\r\nof the events and things described, to other things and events. It may\r\nbe proper to say in addition, as will ultimately appear, that the\r\nwhole of this territory, till quite recently, has been exclusively\r\noccupied by the aboriginal tribes; except as the fur traders have\r\ntraversed those regions to traffic with the Indians. Even now there are\r\nbut few other tenants of the territory.\r\n\r\nIt may also be observed, that the northern shores of this long chain\r\nof Lakes, and their connecting channels, or straits, called rivers,\r\nfrom the outlet of Lake Ontario, nearly to the head of Lake Superior,\r\nappertain to the British possessions of North America, and lie within\r\nthe extensive province of Upper Canada. And the exact boundary between\r\nthe contiguous jurisdiction of the United States and the British\r\ndominions there, as settled a few years since by a joint Board of\r\nCommissioners from the two Governments, is for the most part an\r\nimaginary line, running from and to certain assumed and fixed points,\r\nintended to divide those immense inland waters equally between the\r\ntwo Powers. The Lakes themselves, for the purposes of commerce and\r\nnavigation, are necessarily subjected to regulations, not unlike those\r\nwhich govern the high seas; but more easily arranged and executed, as\r\nonly two nations are concerned in their maintenance. The trace of this\r\njurisdiction boundary is of course exceedingly devious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nMOTIVES FOR THE TOUR, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nNiagara Falls is yet the common boundary in the West of the pleasure\r\nexcursions for the summer, with European visitants of the New World,\r\nand with the travelling gentry of the United States. Few find motive\r\nenough, or feel sufficient ambition to endure the sea-sickness of\r\nthe Lakes, that they may penetrate farther, merely for pleasure.\r\nIt is true, that the rapid crowding of the West, by an emigrant\r\npopulation, settled all along the southern shore of Lake Erie, and\r\nthrough the states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and the Territory of\r\nMichigan, together with the grand communication now opened between\r\nthe city of New York and the great valley of the Mississippi over the\r\nbosom of Lake Erie, has made that lake a busy scene of commercial\r\nenterprise. Besides all the sailing craft employed, a Steam-packet\r\nleaves both the upper and lower extremities of this Lake every day\r\nfor a voyage of forty-eight hours, more or less, between Buffalo and\r\nDetroit, touching at the principal ports on the southern shore; and,\r\nin addition to these, several Steamers are employed in shorter trips.\r\nOne stretches for the most direct course through the entire of the\r\nLake, without touching at any of the intervening ports, for the sake\r\nof dispatch, and to accomplish the voyage in twenty-four hours. As\r\nmight be expected, a constant stream of genteel travellers, going to\r\nand from the Mississippi Valley, and to and from the city of Detroit,\r\nfor the various objects of business, of visiting friends, of scientific\r\nobservations, of gratifying curiosity, of executing public trusts, or\r\nof finding a home for themselves and families, in some one of those\r\nregions of promise, is seen to be always moving there, like a fairy\r\nvision. Once a month a Steam-packet leaves Buffalo for the far off\r\nregions of the north-west, beyond the city of Detroit, through the\r\nupper Lakes, to answer the purposes of government, in keeping up a\r\ncommunication with the garrisons of those frontiers, and to accommodate\r\nthe few travellers, who may have business in those quarters, or who are\r\nbold and romantic enough to push their excursions of pleasure so far.\r\n\r\nAs a Commission from the government of the United States had been\r\nordered to the North West Territory, for August, 1830, to kindle a\r\nCouncil-fire, as it is called, and to smoke the pipe, with a public\r\nassembly of the Chiefs of the numerous tribes of Indians, in that\r\nquarter, for the purpose of settling certain disputes existing\r\namong themselves, in their relations to each other, and also some\r\nmisunderstandings between sundry of their tribes and the general\r\nGovernment, the Author having leisure, and being a little curious to\r\nknow more of this race, than he had ever yet seen, conceived, that\r\nthis extraordinary occasion for the convention of the Chiefs and\r\nrepresentatives of the wilder and more remote tribes, would afford a\r\ngood opportunity for the knowledge and observation he so much coveted.\r\nHe had seen not a little of the Indians, in their semi-civilized\r\nconditions, as they are found insulated here and there, in the midst of\r\nthe white population of the States; and of course where their manners,\r\nhabits, character, and very nature have been much modified by their\r\nintercourse and intimacies with civilized society. The Indian of North\r\nAmerica, in such circumstances, is quite another being from the Indian\r\nin his wild and untutored condition; and as the advocates for the\r\nresolving of society into its original elements, would say:--he is\r\nthere in his unsophisticated nature.\r\n\r\nNo one can pretend to understand the character of the aboriginal\r\ntenants of America, who has seen them only as _vitiated_ by contact\r\nwith Europeans. I say _vitiated_. For, if they are not made better by\r\nproper protection and cultivation, they become much worse, as human\r\nnature, left to itself, is more susceptible of the contagion of vice,\r\nthan of improvement in virtue. The Indian, thrown into temptation,\r\neasily takes the vices of the white man; and his race in such exposures\r\nmelts away, like the snow before a summer’s sun. Such has been the\r\nunhappy fate of the aborigines of America, ever since the discovery of\r\nthat continent by Columbus. They have melted away--and they are still\r\nmelting away. They have been cut off by wars, which the provocations\r\nof the whites have driven them to wage,--and the remnants, depressed,\r\nunprotected--and in their own estimation humbled and degraded, their\r\nspirit broken within them,--have sunk down discouraged, and abandoned\r\nthemselves to the fate of those, who have lost all ambition for a\r\npolitical existence, and who covet death rather than life.\r\n\r\nThe _wild_ Indian, however, whose contact with the European\r\nrace has not been enough to vitiate his habits, or subdue his\r\nself-importance,--who still prowls the forest in the pride of his\r\nindependence,--who looks upon all nations and tribes, but his own,\r\nas unworthy of the contemptuous glance of his eye,--whose dreams of\r\nimportance become to him a constant reality, and actually have the same\r\ninfluence in the formation of his character, as if they were all that\r\nthey seem to him;--he regards himself as the centre of a world, made\r\nespecially for him. Such a being, and much more than this, who is not a\r\ncreature of the imagination, but a living actor in the scenes of earth,\r\nbecomes at least an interesting object, if he does not make a problem,\r\nyet to be solved, in moral philosophy, in politics, in the nature and\r\ncharacter of man, as a social being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF EXPECTATION, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the author indulged many romantic expectations, in the excursion\r\nthat was before him, was not only natural, but warranted. He could\r\nnot reasonably be disappointed, so long as imagination did not become\r\nabsolutely wild and ungovernable, and fly away from earth--or “call for\r\nspirits from the vasty deep”--or fancy things, of which heaven or earth\r\naffords no likeness. In constitutional temperament and in principle\r\nI was rather fond of the fascinating and ever changing hues, which\r\ngenuine poetry throws over the variegated phases of the natural world.\r\nThe universe I had been accustomed to regard, as one grand poetic\r\npanorama, laid out by the Creator’s hand, to entertain uncorrupt minds,\r\nwithout danger of satiety, and to “lead them up through nature’s\r\nworks to nature’s God.” Sermons I could find, or believed were to be\r\nfound, “in trees, and brooks, and stones; and good in every thing.”\r\n“The heavens declare the glory of God,” and “the earth is full of\r\nhis bounty”--and he who does not admire the former, to the praise of\r\nHim that made them, and partake of the rich gifts of the latter with\r\ngratitude to their author, it must be ascribed alike to his stupidity\r\nand depravity. I have thought, that he who cannot appreciate such\r\nsentiments, can never sympathise with the best feelings, and happiest\r\ncondition of man. The universe, in all its parts, suggests them;\r\nand heaven itself, we have reason to believe, is full of them. And\r\nthere is no place so natural to song, so full of music, so beautiful\r\nin its attractive forms, or so enchanting in the combination and\r\ndisplay of its glories to the eye, as heaven. All the most lively\r\nand glowing sentiments of true religion, of genuine piety, are of a\r\npoetic character. And the highest and sweetest inspirations of Divine\r\nRevelation, it need not be said, are all poetry.\r\n\r\nGreen Bay, in the North West Territory, where we were destined, is\r\ncommonly reckoned the end of the world. It is not even imagined, by\r\nthe vulgar, that there is any place, or any human being, or any thing\r\nwith which mortals may have to do, beyond it. Besides, the way is\r\nlong--the seas dangerous and ever liable to sudden and disastrous\r\nstorms--the shores uninhabited, or tenanted only here and there by the\r\ninhospitable savage. Latitude and longitude and clime were all to be\r\nchanged, and changed too by a long stretch--not long perhaps to such a\r\nvoyager as Captain Cook, or Captain Parry; but yet long and dubious,\r\nand in no small degree romantic, to one, who had never been accustomed\r\nto the wilder regions of the new world. To go up among the Indians, the\r\nsavages of the wilderness! and be their guest, far from the territories\r\nof civilized man! Who has not listened in the nursery to the tales\r\nof Indian wars, of the tomahawk and scalping knife, of the midnight\r\nmassacre and burning of villages and towns; of the mother butchered\r\nwith her infant in her arms; of the grey head, and man in full vigour\r\nof life, slaughtered together; and a train of tender captives, driven\r\naway to glut the vengeance of the savage, by the endurance of every\r\nimaginable torture;--until the story has thrilled his blood with\r\nhorror, and he refused to be left in his bed, till his nurse, who\r\nhad frightened him, had sung him to sleep? And although he may have\r\nstood corrected in his maturer years, and entertained less horrible\r\nnotions of the savage, still he can never altogether efface his first\r\nimpressions. The poetry of his feelings often overpowers his judgment,\r\nand he not only anticipates much from the sight of a savage in his\r\nnative regions and costume; but he involuntarily shrinks from the\r\npeculiar, rigid, and stern aspect of his countenance; shudders at the\r\nthought of what may possibly be working in his soul; and calculates a\r\nthousand imaginable results of an interview, which perchance has placed\r\nhim in the power of such an unsocial and awful being. There stands\r\nbefore him a naked man, with visage painted horrible, whose every\r\nmuscle demonstrates his custom to exertion and fatigue, who knows not\r\nhow to smile; who never sleeps, or wakes, but that a weapon of death is\r\ngirded to his side, or borne in his hand; who is a creature of passion,\r\nand inflexible in his purpose, when once resolved; who conceals his\r\nthoughts beneath his imperturbable countenance; who never betrays his\r\nemotions, however deep and strong they are;--who can be indifferent in\r\nsuch society? But we must not anticipate the scenes to come.\r\n\r\nHaving made the reader already so much acquainted with Lake Erie,\r\nwe will not detain him long upon a sea familiar to his thoughts. It\r\nmay be remarked, that the surface of this lake is five hundred and\r\nseventy-five feet above high water on the Hudson river at Albany, the\r\nEastern termination of the Erie canal. The rapids and Falls of Niagara,\r\nthe rapids of the St. Lawrence, and the general descent of these waters\r\nto the ocean, make the difference.\r\n\r\nAbout the 20th of July, 1830, we embarked at Buffalo in the\r\nsteam-packet, _Superior_, for Detroit, and made the passage in two\r\ndays, skirting the southern shore, and touching at the principal ports,\r\nwithout remarkable incident, except an unpleasant encounter with an\r\narmy of musquitoes in the bay of Sandusky, which were taken on board at\r\nthe port of the same name, in lieu of passengers left behind; and whose\r\naudaciousness, ferocity, and blood-thirstiness, were enough to make one\r\nout of temper with the place; and which, notwithstanding all attempts\r\nto ward off their assaults, inflicted upon us many deep and annoying\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\nLake Erie is unchequered by islands, till we begin to approach its\r\nwestern regions; where, instead of an open sea, the beautiful and\r\ncurving shores of the main land, and of the insular territories,\r\ncovered as they generally are with unbroken forests, and opening\r\nchannels and bays in every direction, lend a vision of enchantment,\r\nrarely equalled, to the eye of the passenger, borne along upon the\r\nbosom of the deep. It presents the aspects of nature, in all her\r\nchasteness, untouched, inviolate; and when the wind is lulled, and\r\nthe face of the waters becomes a sea of glass, it is nature’s holiest\r\nsabbath; and seems to forbid the approach and trespass of the dashing\r\nengine, which rushes forward in fury and envy of the scene; while the\r\npassenger, wrought to ecstacy in contemplation of the novel exhibition,\r\nshrinks back within himself involuntarily, as if in fear of some sudden\r\nretribution from above, for the daring violation of this sacred retreat\r\nof nature’s repose. In a mood like this, the stranger enters the river\r\nof Detroit, almost level with its banks, fancies he hears the thunders\r\nof old Maldon, (a British fort on the Canada side at the mouth of the\r\nriver), gazes at the mean and sordid huts of the unambitious French,\r\n(for however unexpected the announcement, there are no people in the\r\nworld more distant from ambition, than the French of Canada),--admires\r\nthe lightness and celerity, which characterize the movements of the\r\nIndian canoe, filled with copper-coloured faces and uncovered heads,\r\nand darting up and down and across the stream, in obedience to the\r\npaddles, which enter the water so still and with so little apparent\r\neffort, as scarcely to disturb the surface;--and soon finds himself\r\nlaid in the docks of a busy and flourishing port, presenting handsome\r\nstreets and handsome steeples, itself the ancient seat of Indian war\r\nand Indian romance, identified and connected with a history like\r\nromance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF DETROIT, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetroit has long been regarded as the limit of civilization towards\r\nthe north-west--and to tell truth, there is even yet but little of the\r\ncharacter of civilization beyond it. As may be seen from the map, it\r\nrests upon the west side of the strait, or river, which connects Lake\r\nHuron with Lake Erie; about ten miles below that small extension of the\r\nstrait, called Lake St. Clair; and twenty miles above the north shore\r\nof Lake Erie, towards its western extremity. This town, or commercial\r\nport, is dignified with the name, and enjoys the chartered rights,\r\nof a city; although its population at present does not exceed three\r\nthousand. The banks of the river above and below the city are lined\r\nwith a French population, descendants of the first European traders\r\namong the Indians, in that quarter; and extending from Lake Erie to\r\nLake St. Clair, increasing in density, as they approach the town, and\r\naveraging perhaps one hundred per mile.\r\n\r\nThe city of Detroit dates its history from July 1701. At that time M.\r\nde la Motte Cadillac, with one hundred men, and a Jesuit, carrying\r\nwith them every thing necessary for the commencement and support of\r\nthe establishment meditated, reached this place. “How numerous and\r\ndiversified,” says a public literary document, “are the incidents\r\ncompressed within the history of this settlement! No place in the\r\nUnited States presents such a series of events, interesting in\r\nthemselves, and permanently affecting, as they occurred, its progress\r\nand prosperity. Five times its flag has changed--three different\r\nsovereignties have claimed its allegiance, and since it has been held\r\nby the United States, its government has been thrice transferred. Twice\r\nit has been besieged by the Indians, once captured in war, and once\r\nburned to the ground.”\r\n\r\nIt should be observed, that the French trading ports, on the Upper\r\nLakes, preceded the settlement of Detroit by nearly fifty years; that\r\nas early as 1673 they had descended the Mississippi, as far as the\r\nArkanses; and that in 1679 Robert de la Sale penetrated through the\r\nDelta of the Mississippi, and saw its waters mingle with the Gulf\r\nof Mexico. Then was the interesting and vast conception formed and\r\nmatured, of establishing a cordon of posts from Quebec, by way of the\r\nUpper Lakes and the Mississippi, to the Mexican seas--an enterprise,\r\nwhich, considering the age and the obstacles, both physical and moral,\r\nmay proudly take rank with any thing done in later days.\r\n\r\nWhat child, whose vernacular tongue is English, has not listened to\r\nIndian story with an intensity of interest, which he can never cease\r\nto cherish; and with expectation of something new and newer still,\r\nfrom the wildness and fierceness of savage enterprise? Where is the\r\nman, however grave with philosophy and bowed with the weight of years,\r\nhowever accustomed to things prodigious, whose ear will not bend to\r\nthe promise of him, who announces an untold page of Indian warfare? He\r\nwho is read in the strifes of civilized nations, can easily anticipate\r\nthe modes and the results, even of Napoleon’s campaigns. But he who\r\nfollows the track of the savage, thirsting for blood, expects some new\r\ndevelopment of stratagem and cruelty, at every turn.\r\n\r\nLike _Tecumseh_, whose name signifies _a tiger crouching for his prey_,\r\na man great in council and in war; and who bore the commission of chief\r\nof the Indian forces, in the British army in the late war;--like\r\nhim, the _Ottawa_ chieftain, of the middle of the last century, gave\r\ndemonstration of a spirit, which in other circumstances, might have\r\nleft him a name, not inferior to Alexander, or Cesar, or Napoleon. It\r\nis sufficient to say, that in 1763, a time of profound peace, _Pontiac_\r\nhad attained such influence and supremacy over all the Indian tribes,\r\nspread over those extensive regions, as to have united them in a grand\r\nconfederacy for the instantaneous extinction of all the European posts\r\nalong a thousand miles of frontier; and that he actually succeeded, so\r\nfar as to cut off, almost simultaneously, _nine_ out of _twelve_ of\r\nthese military establishments. The surprise of Michillimackinack, one\r\nof these stations, is narrated in the following manner, by the document\r\nabove quoted:\r\n\r\n“The fort was then upon the main land, near the northern point of the\r\npeninsula. The Ottawas, to whom the assault was committed, prepared\r\nfor a great game of ball, to which the officers of the garrison were\r\ninvited. While engaged in play, one of the parties gradually inclined\r\ntowards the fort, and the other pressed after them. The ball was\r\nonce or twice thrown over the pickets, and the Indians were suffered\r\nto enter and procure it. Nearly all the garrison were present as\r\nspectators, and those on duty were alike unprepared, as unsuspicious.\r\nSuddenly the ball was again thrown into the fort, and all the Indians\r\nrushed after it. The rest of the tale is soon told. The troops were\r\nbutchered, and the fort destroyed.”\r\n\r\nBut no one stratagem of Indian warfare is like another. We only know,\r\nthat _eight_ of the other stations were annihilated nearly at the same\r\ninstant. Detroit was one of the three stations successfully defended,\r\nbut not without the shedding of much blood. _Pontiac_ himself appeared\r\nbefore it. And so unsuspected was his stratagem, that nothing would\r\nhave prevented its triumphant execution, but for the informations of\r\na friendly Indian woman. Pontiac had negotiated a great council to be\r\nheld in the fort, to which himself and warriors were to be admitted,\r\nwith rifles sawed off and hid under their blankets; by which, with\r\nthe tomahawk and knife, at a concerted signal from their chieftain,\r\nthey were to rise and massacre the garrison. But in consequence of the\r\nadvice from the woman, the garrison were prepared. Pontiac and his\r\nwarriors being rebuked, were too generously dismissed, and in return\r\nfor this kindness commenced and waged a most bloody war.\r\n\r\nPontiac, unsuccessful in his wars against these posts, notwithstanding\r\nthe great advantages he had gained, and after committing numberless\r\nand untold cruelties, (though he was not without his fits of\r\ngenerosity, and of what are called the noble traits of Indian\r\ncharacter),--implacable in his hatred and resentments; finally retired\r\nto the Illinois, in the south-west, and was there assassinated by the\r\nhand of an Indian. “The memory of this great Ottawa chief,” says the\r\ndocument used above, and from which this account is abridged, “is still\r\nheld in reverence among his countrymen. And whatever be the fate, which\r\nawaits _them_, _his_ name and deeds will live in their traditionary\r\nnarratives, increasing in interest, as they increase in years.”\r\n\r\nDetroit, originally, and for ages a post for trade, and a garrison\r\nfor its protection--having enjoyed and suffered alternately peace and\r\nwar, with the aborigines and between rival civilized powers, for such\r\na long series of years--has now become the beautiful and flourishing\r\nmetropolis of a wide and interesting territory--a territory destined\r\nsoon to make at least _two_ of the most important states of the\r\nAmerican Union. The city looks proudly across one of the noblest rivers\r\nof the continent, upon the territory of a great and rival power, and\r\nseems to say, though in such vicinity, in reference to her former\r\nexposure and painful vicissitudes:--“Henceforth I will sit in peace,\r\nand grow and flourish under the wing of this Confederate Republic.”\r\nAnd this place, but a little while ago so distant, is now brought\r\nwithin four days of the city of New York--the track pursued being seven\r\nhundred and fifty miles. Here, at Detroit, some of the finest steamers\r\nin North America, come and go every day, connecting it with the east,\r\nand have begun already to search out the distant west and north.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of Michigan, lying between the lake of the same name on\r\nthe west, and Huron on the east, is one of the greatest beauties of\r\nthe kind in America, if not in the world. Where can be found such a\r\ntongue of land, and of so great extent, skirted by a coast of eight\r\nhundred miles, of the purest fresh-water seas, navigable for ships of\r\nany burthen? The climate mild and healthful, the country ascertained\r\nto be the best of land--with streams and rivers sufficient for all\r\nuseful purposes--and the upland level, between the two great lakes,\r\nchequered with innumerable small lakes, or basins, of one, three, five,\r\nand ten miles in circumference, pure and clear as the fountains of\r\nEden, and abounding with fish, as do the rivers. There is something in\r\nthe character of these basins of water, and in the multitude of them,\r\nwhich imparts a charm to this region, altogether unrivalled. They\r\nare the sources of the rivers and smaller streams, which flow into\r\neither lake--themselves and their outlets pure as crystal. How many\r\ngentlemen of large estates, and noblemen of Europe, have undertaken to\r\ncreate artificial lakes, and fill them with fish--which after all their\r\npains are doomed to the constant deposits of filth and collections of\r\nmiasmata; and which maybe clouded by the plunge of a frog? But in the\r\nterritory of Michigan is a world of lakes, created by the hand of God,\r\nof all dimensions and shapes, just fitted for the sports of fancy, of\r\nchildhood, and of youth--for the relaxations of manly toil--for the\r\noccupation of leisure;--the shores of which are overhung with beautiful\r\nand wholesome shades--and the waters deep, and so clear, that the fish\r\ncannot play in their lowest beds, without betraying their motions\r\nto the observer, floating in his bark upon the surface. The common\r\nprocesses of nature maintain the everlasting and perfect purity of\r\nthese waters, independent of the care of man. The transparency of the\r\nwaters, in those upper regions, and in the great lakes, is a marvel--an\r\nincredible wonder to those, who have been accustomed only to turbid\r\nlakes and turbid rivers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE INSTANCE OF CAPITAL CRIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will not detain the reader any longer at Detroit, except to notice\r\na remarkable instance of capital crime. On the 26th of July, during\r\nour stay at Detroit, S. G. S. received the sentence of death, from\r\nthe proper tribunal, for the murder of his wife, under circumstances,\r\naggravated by brutality and savageness, too painful for recital; and\r\nin the contemplation of which humanity shudders. The wretched man’s\r\nown children were the principal witnesses, on whose testimony he had\r\nbeen convicted. In telling the story of their mother’s dreadful end,\r\nthey brought their father to the gallows. In the progress of the\r\ntrial, a history of savage violence was disclosed, such, we would fain\r\nbelieve, as rarely passes upon the records of crime. What demon of\r\nhell can be more fatal to human happiness, and to the souls of men,\r\nthan ardent spirits? The children, a son and two daughters, of adult\r\nyears, testified abundantly to the natural amiableness and affectionate\r\nkindness, in the conjugal and parental relations, not only of the\r\nmother, but also of their father, in his sober moments. But when\r\nintoxicated, he seemed possessed of the furies of a more abandoned\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAs the murderer entered the place of judgment, and was conducted to\r\nthe bar to receive the sentence of the law, I observed in him a noble\r\nhuman form, erect, manly, and dignified; of large but well proportioned\r\nstature; bearing a face and head not less expressive, than the most\r\nperfect _beau ideal_ of the Roman; with a countenance divinely fitted\r\nfor the play of virtue, of every parental and conjugal affection; and\r\nan eye beaming out a soul, which might well be imagined to have been\r\nonce susceptible of the love and worship of the Eternal One--all--all\r\nmarred and spoiled by the demon of intemperance; and now, alas! allied\r\nto murder of the most diabolical cast. Rarely is seen among the sons of\r\nmen a more commanding human form, or a countenance more fitly set to\r\nintelligence and virtue--made, all would say, to love and be honoured.\r\nBut now what change, by the debasements of brutal appetite, and the\r\nunprovoked indulgence and instigation of a fatal passion! By what a\r\nfearful career of vice and crime, had he come to this! “What a piece of\r\nwork is man! how noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in form\r\nand moving, how express and admirable! in action, how like an angel!\r\nin apprehension, how like a god! the beauty of the world, the paragon\r\nof animals!” But when debased and ruined by vice, how like a fiend,\r\nin shape so unbefitting such a spirit! And yet, who could see the\r\nfiendly stamp upon this poor and wretched man? For he wept--he sobbed!\r\nHis inmost soul heaved with anguish! he bore the marks of contrition.\r\nAs a man, and such a man--if we could forget his crime--he was to be\r\nrespected; as being in a condition of suffering, he was to be pitied;\r\nand as seeming the image of repentance, heaven might forgive what man\r\ncould not.\r\n\r\nIt was an awful hour, when he approached the bar even of this earthly\r\ntribunal, anticipating well his doom. For a jury of his country, as he\r\nknew, had set their seal upon it. As he entered this now awful chamber\r\nof justice, he cast his eye around upon the expecting throng, whose\r\npresence and gaze could only be a mockery of his condition;--and with\r\nthe greatest possible effort for self-possession, braced his muscular\r\nenergies to support his manly frame, while trembling under the tempest\r\nof passion, which agitated his soul. But the moment he was seated, all\r\nhis firmness dissolved into the weakness of a child;--and he wept;--he\r\nsobbed aloud. A silence reigned through the crowd, and a thrill of\r\nsympathy seemed to penetrate every heart.\r\n\r\nThe court, unaccustomed in that land to such an office, felt themselves\r\nin a new and an awful condition, with a fellow-being arraigned at\r\ntheir bar, charged and convicted of a most atrocious--and in its\r\ncircumstances, an unparalleled crime, and his doom suspended at that\r\nmoment on their lips. Their emotions were too evident to be mistaken,\r\nand in the highest degree honourable to their hearts. “S. G. S.”--the\r\nname in full being pronounced by the court, broke the awful silence of\r\nthe place,--“have you any thing to say, why the judgment of the court\r\nshould not now be pronounced?” The prisoner rose convulsed, and with\r\nfaltering voice, and in broken accents, replied: “Nothing, if it please\r\nthe court, except what I have already communicated”--and resumed his\r\nseat. Upon which a very appropriate, eloquent, and impressive address\r\nwas made by the court to the prisoner, setting forth the fact and\r\nnature of the crime, of which he stood convicted; appealing to his own\r\nknowledge for the fairness of his trial; and to his own consciousness\r\nof the justice of his doom; commending him to heaven for that clemency,\r\nwhich he could no longer ask of men;--and then the awful sentence was\r\npronounced. “And may God Almighty,” said the judge, with that subdued\r\nemphasis and touching pathos, which became the responsibility of his\r\noffice, and the nature of the occasion--“may God Almighty have mercy on\r\nyour soul.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner, by all the testimony, was in his nature kind. He had\r\nloved his wife excessively, and loved her, strange as it may seem, unto\r\nthe last. And for that very love he was the more cruel, and the greater\r\nmonster. He was jealous of her fidelity, without cause. Jealousy! “’tis\r\na monster begot upon itself--born on itself.” “That’s _he_--that _was_\r\nOthello!” And only when intoxicated with strong drink did this terrible\r\npassion gain its dominion over him. In the moments of his sobriety, he\r\nloved and confided, and could say in company of his wife,\r\n\r\n    “My soul hath her content so absolute,\r\n    That not another comfort like to thee,\r\n    Succeeds in unknown fate.”\r\n\r\nBut it would seem, that hell itself were scarcely more furious, or more\r\nterrible, than he, when the demon of ardent spirits assumed control of\r\nhis passions. If demoniacs were now-a-days about, the name of that\r\nman, in such predicament and mood, were worthy to be written, as prince\r\nof the host. But in prison, and before the tribunal of justice, this\r\nwretched being, once kind in nature, and made a fiend by the abuse of\r\nhis nature, stood _dispossessed_, the guilty and conscious murderer of\r\nher, whom he espoused in her youth and loveliness, and who was ever\r\nworthy of his love;--and whom he took to his bosom, and promised, by\r\nthe light and love of heaven, to be her husband and protector.\r\n\r\nHe was executed on the 24th of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nEMBARKATION FROM DETROIT, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of August the steam-packet, _Sheldon Thomson_, left Detroit\r\nfor the Upper Lakes, her ultimate destination being Green Bay, with\r\nthe United States’ Commissioners, bound on the errand heretofore\r\nalluded to, and which we shall notice again by-and-by;--three companies\r\nof troops for the frontier garrisons;--several parties of ladies\r\nand gentlemen; some in pursuit of pleasure, some of materials for\r\nscience and literature; some of business; some families returning, or\r\nemigrating to those new and remote settlements;--with pigs, poultry,\r\n&c. &c. As near as we recollect, the number of souls on board,\r\nincluding troops, commissioners and suite, ladies and gentlemen, and\r\nthe crew--was not far from _two hundred and fifty_.\r\n\r\nThe rarity of this expedition gave it some importance. The character\r\nof the company, but especially the objects of the mission from\r\nGovernment to the Indians of the North-West, magnified the interest\r\nnot inconsiderably. It is true there is some sailing craft habitually\r\nemployed in this line of navigation. It is also true, that one of the\r\nsteam-packets of Lake Erie, ordinarily makes a trip into those remote\r\nregions, some two or three times in a season; as encouragements offer.\r\nBut Detroit is reckoned the common limit of the crowd, who flock to the\r\nwest in the summer; and a trip beyond is quite notable, and esteemed\r\na great treat with the curious, and with all who have a taste for\r\nnovel, wild, and romantic scenery; or an ambition to see that which is\r\nseldom seen by the common herd of travellers. It is confessed, that an\r\nexpedition to the North Pole, is somewhat more important to the persons\r\nconcerned;--and if they have the good luck to get back again, it may be\r\nmore important to the world. If Captain Symmes had lived to accomplish\r\nhis expedition to the centre of the earth, that would at least have\r\nbeen more interesting. It is possible, it may not yet be understood,\r\nall the world over, that the earth is hollow, and to be entered by a\r\npassage towards the imaginary poles; the polar points being themselves\r\nof course in the celestial regions, and therefore unattainable to man.\r\nThis important discovery was made by the above-named Captain Symmes,\r\nof Ohio, United States.\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended, that the particular expedition, which makes the\r\nsubject of our story, can claim a paramount importance, with either of\r\nthose just alluded to. But still it attracted considerable attention.\r\nAll the newspapers of the country--at least very extensively--announced\r\nit long beforehand;--that is--the proprietors of the steam-packet took\r\ncare to put it in circulation, for the greater profit of the voyage,\r\nby attracting the attention of the curious, and offering motive to the\r\nenterprising. It was by this sort of newspaper puffing, that the author\r\nwas drawn into the train; as was the fact with a great portion of the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 4th of August, the city of Detroit was in no\r\nlittle bustle, and the wharf, along-side of which lay the _Sheldon\r\nThomson_, with her signals snapping in the wind, exhibited a most busy\r\nswarm of human beings, running to and fro, in the way of preparation.\r\nAt _eleven_ o’clock A. M. the gun was fired, and the packet bore away\r\nfor Lake St. Clair, under all the force of wind and steam, and with\r\nas fine a day, as the sun ever made upon the earth. Indeed the scene\r\nand the occasion were quite inspiriting; and the objects in view wore\r\nthe aspect of many powerful and romantic attractions. The beautiful\r\ncity of Detroit began to recede, while the packet, borne along between\r\nthe Canadian shore and Hog Island, (a name, it must be confessed, ill\r\ndeserved by a thing so beautiful) glided in fine style into the opening\r\nexpanse of Lake St. Clair.\r\n\r\nLake St. Clair, as before recognized, is an expansion of the strait,\r\nnearly in a circular form, with a diameter of thirty miles; and in\r\nconsequence of the depression of all its shores, and there being\r\nno hills in the immediate interior, the position of a vessel in\r\nany part of its border, opens from the deck a shoreless sea in the\r\ndistant prospect. The centre of the lake presents a beautiful and\r\nenchanting _looming up_ of the shores, as the sailors call it, in all\r\ndirections; and the marginal forests, broken every here and there, by\r\nthe indentations of the coast, seem to hang suspended in the horizon,\r\nbetween the sea and the heavens, and play and dance before the eye, in\r\na sort of fairy vision. The images of this kind, fore and aft, and on\r\neither side, were continually changing their forms, and showing the\r\nmost fantastic shapes, as the vessel wended her serpentine course,\r\nby the channel through the lake, from its southern to its northern\r\nborder. For Lake St. Clair is an exception to all the others, in this\r\nparticular: that its waters are generally shallow, except in the\r\nchannel; and that channel is perpetually changing by the effect of\r\nstorms, and requires a frequent survey for the direction of the pilot.\r\nIndeed this body of water is hardly worthy to be dignified with the\r\nname of a _Lake_, in comparison of the others, and might as well be\r\nconsidered, as a flooding of low lands--which seems to be the exact\r\ntruth. The main current of water through it, however, always maintains\r\na channel, sufficient for all the purposes of navigation, though it is\r\nsomewhat devious.\r\n\r\nThe passage over Lake St. Clair, in a day of such unrivalled physical\r\nglories, in such a company, on such an expedition, leaving the regions\r\nof civilization behind us, and just about to plunge into the regions\r\nof barbarism;--or rather, flying from a world, violated by the track\r\nand by the hand of man, into a world of virgin waters and into a virgin\r\nwilderness--all vast, and their proper character inconceivable, except\r\nby actual inspection; such a passage might well make an apology for the\r\nindulgence of some trifling ingredients of poetry and romance. Every\r\nheart seemed light and buoyant, as the clouds floating in the sky, and\r\nits affections active, as the elements by which the bark, which made\r\ntheir home, was wafted along;--and all prospects bright and cheering,\r\nas the sun, which shone upon the scene. The climate and aspects of the\r\nheavens seemed changed. The clouds, such, as a clear atmosphere and\r\nits brisk currents fold together in their fleecy robes, and toss along\r\nin sublime and majestic sport;--the shores and islets successively\r\nreceding in one direction, and coming into view from another;--a new\r\nand fine steamer, dashing through the waves, with all her sails set\r\nto the breeze, and crammed with a population, like bees upon the\r\nhive, in a summer’s day, all life and bustle;--the _toute ensemble_\r\npresented a scene, as picturesque, as could well be grouped, under a\r\ntraveller’s eye. And then again the variety of character on board:\r\nthree detachments of raw recruits, bidding adieu to the common world,\r\nand going to occupy the frontier posts, to keep the peace between the\r\ntraders and Indians, between the Indians themselves, and if needs be,\r\nbetween the querulous parties of Canadians and Americans, strolling\r\nin those regions;--a Commission from Government, on their way to\r\nsettle disputes and negotiate treaties with the aboriginal tribes of\r\nthe North-West;--traders, voyagers of pleasure and observation, and\r\nfriends going to visit friends, in those distant retreats;--a vicar\r\ngeneral from the pope of Rome, with plenipotentiary powers of remission\r\nand retention in things spiritual, and of supervising the interests\r\nof the Catholic church; together with two Protestant clergymen and a\r\nmissionary of Mackinaw;--men, women, and children of all grades, and\r\nall conditions--and withal the rare character of the excursion;--all\r\nthese things together, as might be supposed, contributed to lend an\r\ninterest and a charm to the expedition, so auspiciously commenced, not\r\neasily conceived by any one, who did not make one of the party.\r\n\r\nAbout four o’clock, P.M., we found ourselves; hard upon what may be\r\ncalled, with the greatest propriety, the _Delta_ of the river St.\r\nClair, which discharges itself by about _fifty_ mouths into the lake\r\nof the same name. The principal navigable channels are _five_. The\r\nextended marshes, challenging the utmost scope of the eye, lying\r\nonly a few inches higher than the water, and all waving with heavy\r\nburdens of high _prairie_ grass;--the meandering mouths of the river,\r\nshooting in every direction, and insulating the region in the most\r\nfantastic forms;--the thick and impenetrable copses of wood, of larger\r\nand smaller extent, springing up here and there, in all their various\r\nshapes, until after a few miles they are merged in one unbroken\r\nforest, and seeming to vie with the outlets of the river in creating\r\na variety of their own peculiar kind;--these several and combined\r\nfeatures, changing their forms continually, as we ascended the channel\r\nselected, like the coming and flitting visions of creative fancy,\r\nmight almost dispossess a sober man of his senses, and persuade him,\r\nby a world of reality, that he was in a world of illusions. And then\r\nto see the French huts--for the French are to be found, scattered\r\nalong the old line of trading posts, from Quebec to Detroit, from\r\nDetroit to Mackinaw, at the head of Lake Huron, from Mackinaw across\r\nthe North-West Territory to _Prairie du Chien_, on the Mississippi;\r\nand from the last point along the banks of that mighty river, to the\r\nGulf of Mexico--to look upon the habitations of that indolent race,\r\nso mean and sordid, as they are, resting upon the river’s brink, and\r\ndemonstrating by their every feature a dull and lazy existence, akin\r\nto that of the savage;--and now and then to see a group of Indians,\r\nold and young, male and female, some entirely naked, and others with\r\nthe rag of a shirt, or blanket never washed, pendant and ready to\r\ndrop by its rottenness from their shoulders--darting out of a thicket\r\nupon the bank, and running and jumping with frantic, or joyous signs\r\nand exclamations of amazement, to see such a great _canoe_, so full\r\nof people, and rushing up against the tide, drawn, as they imagine,\r\nby great sturgeons, harnessed under water;--we a wonder to them and\r\nthey a very piece of romance to us;--who, fresh from the centre of\r\ncivilization, and unaccustomed to these scenes, would not gaze with\r\ninterest, and imagine himself dreaming?--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nRIVER ST. CLAIR, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Lake St. Clair, we run in the evening about fifteen\r\nmiles up the river, having enjoyed one of the most brilliant sunsets\r\nthat Italy, or Greece could ever boast of,--and then stopped to take\r\nin a supply of fuel for Mackinaw. The rest of the night from nine in\r\nthe evening, till four in the morning, was industriously occupied in\r\nrunning twenty-five miles to Fort Gratiot, having the double obstacle\r\nof a stiff current to stem, equal to a rapid, and a schooner in tow,\r\nwhich with us, was bound for the Upper Lakes. If this vessel in _tow_\r\ncould not classically be called an _obsta_-cle, it was at least a grave\r\nSaxon _hold back_. But nevertheless, as the master of the steamer was\r\nsure of _our_ money, there seemed no objection in his mind to get a\r\nlittle more, for helping this weather-bound ship; although he had never\r\nstipulated with us for the privilege. And besides, if it was not an act\r\nof humanity, it was a kindness--it being understood, that vessels,\r\nupward bound, are often detained in this current, not only days, but\r\nweeks, before a south wind springs up, sufficiently strong to bear them\r\ninto Lake Huron.\r\n\r\nFort Gratiot has the honour of its name from its original projector,\r\nColonel Gratiot, now chief engineer of the United States at Washington.\r\nThe fort has a beautiful and commanding position, immediately at the\r\noutlet of Huron, and of course at the commencement of the strait,\r\ncalled the river St. Clair; which, opposite the fort, is so narrow and\r\nrapid, as to require nearly the full power of a steamer to force her\r\nup. With our schooner _hold back_, it seemed for a long time doubtful,\r\nwhether the packet would be able to run into the lake. She buffeted the\r\ncurrent “with lusty sinews,” springing to one side, then to the other,\r\nlike the draught-horse, pulling his burden up hill; but notwithstanding\r\noften went backward instead of forward, and gained nothing, until, by\r\nraising the steam, more perhaps, than what was prudent, she finally\r\ncarried her companion into the sea above, and then dismissed her to\r\nmake her own way. This current is deep, and a sublime object, not only\r\nin consideration of its own rapid career, but more especially, when we\r\nreflect, that here all the waters of Huron, Michigan, and Superior,\r\nare disemboguing through so narrow a channel, with a determination not\r\nto be resisted.\r\n\r\nThose of the passengers, who were disposed, had time at Gratiot to go\r\non shore, and view the fort. At that time it was surrounded only by\r\npickets, fit only to check an Indian assault. It was ordered, however,\r\nfrom the importance of its position on the Canada frontier, to be\r\nmade a strong place. It is understood, that the opposite side of the\r\nriver, within musket shot, is in the British dominions. Our reception\r\nat the fort was not only polite and cordial, but even in the forms of\r\ndrawing-room parade. They had been notified of the visit, and knew\r\nthe very hour to expect it. And as such a call rarely happens in that\r\nsecluded and wild retreat, they must needs take it when it comes, and\r\nmake the most of it. It was in all respects a grateful interview, and\r\nwell improved. An hour’s interchange of civilities on such an occasion,\r\nand in such a place, are moments of high enjoyment--they make an\r\nincident in the common monotony of life, and a subject of interesting\r\nrecollections.\r\n\r\nAmong my memoranda of this voyage, I find the following:--\r\n\r\nAugust 6:--Still in Lake Huron, and borne onward with great rapidity\r\nby wind and steam,--the latter of which we always have at command,\r\nand the former being most favourable;--our course laid for the river\r\nSt. Mary, or rather for the common passage, leading to Lake Superior.\r\nFor there is no such thing, as the river St. Mary, commonly marked\r\nas such, in the books and charts. That region is a world of islands,\r\nstraits, and bays. Lake Huron, as the map will show, is one of the\r\ngreat inland seas of the North-West. Our course from the river St.\r\nClair to St. Mary’s, is nearly a direct line, keeping the west shore\r\nordinarily in sight, when the weather will permit. The borders of this\r\nlake present a wild, uninhabited region--and the navigation beautiful\r\nin its stillness; but doomed to fitful and terrible agitations by the\r\nsudden waking of the tempest. The greatest fury of the wide Atlantic\r\nis mere mockery to Huron’s maddest moods and roughest shapes. The most\r\nexperienced mariner of the former has been filled with wonder, and\r\nstood aghast at the terrors of the latter.\r\n\r\n_Evening of the same day_:--At anchor in St. Mary’s Straits, five miles\r\nfrom the Falls. Our passage from Fort Gratiot to the west straits,\r\nplunging into an open and wide sea, we made in thirty-six hours, the\r\nwind all the way in favour, and for a good part of the time leaving the\r\nwestern shore, and of course all other land out of sight. To such a\r\nscene in good weather, as we have had, there is but one page. But those\r\nof us, who are strangers here, felt that we were entering a region\r\nremote from civilization, and but little marked with the traces of\r\nhuman enterprize. Since we approached the northern shores of this lake\r\nand entered the straits, no pictures of romance could divide us farther\r\nfrom accustomed scenes and associations. The great _Maniton_, or\r\n_Spirit_-island--in Indian tradition and belief the home and residence\r\nof spirits--lifted up a prominence in its centre, which might well\r\npass among heathen, as a sanctuary of the gods. And so is it esteemed.\r\nNext the little _Maniton_--and then the Drummond Isle--on the last of\r\nwhich and near the straits, as we approached, was distinctly brought\r\nunder our eye, through a beautiful harbour, and within one mile of our\r\ncourse, a fort and little village, erected by and formerly belonging\r\nto the British, apparently well built;--but now without a solitary\r\nhuman being, since, by the recent demarcation of the boundary line,\r\nthe island has fallen within the jurisdiction of the United States.\r\nA deserted village, in this uninhabited region, was a melancholy\r\nspectacle--and resting, as it does, in such a beautiful spot! It really\r\nlooked covetable--like a little paradise, peeping out upon the sea,\r\nby the point of land, which defends the harbour, skirted by a lovely\r\nforest-scene, and spreading its fair bosom to the heavens, seems to\r\ninvite those, who may be tired of the world, to its enchanting retreat.\r\nI cannot imagine, how it should be left unoccupied; and I can hardly\r\nyet persuade myself, that such is the fact. I strained my eyes through\r\nthe glass, as we passed, to see the busy population; but no human form\r\nappeared. And thus I thought it must be a fairy creation, in kindness\r\nlaid before our eye, to relieve us for a moment, from the monotony of\r\nthese desolate abodes;--for we had seen nothing like the feature of an\r\ninhabited world, since we left Fort Gratiot, except a solitary sail,\r\nfar off on the bosom of the lake;--but the melancholy effect upon my\r\nown feelings, when I was obliged to believe, that no man, or woman, or\r\nchild was there--none of human kind to enjoy the apparent desirableness\r\nof the place--will not allow me to appreciate the favour intended.\r\nAnd the _lusus naturæ_ of all the regions we have passed, within a\r\nfew hours, from that point, till we came to anchor this evening--the\r\nveriest sportings of nature, in her most fantastic creations of islets,\r\nand bays, and straits; the former springing up and the latter opening\r\nin every direction; accompanied with the thought, that nowhere among\r\nthem all rests the habitation of civilized man, or is often found the\r\ntrack of the savage;--these all made fancy more vivid, romance more\r\nromantic, and the very wildness of nature more wild. We also passed\r\nthe ruins of another fort, on the island of St. Joseph, a valuable and\r\nbeautiful territory, twenty miles by ten, lifting up a mountain in its\r\ncentre, and said to embosom a mine of silver, known only to an Indian,\r\nwhose guardian spirit will not permit either himself, or others, to\r\nreap the advantages of the disclosure. This island, formerly belonging\r\nto the United States, has, by the recent settlement of the boundary\r\nline, fallen to the British Government, in exchange, we may suppose,\r\nfor Drummond’s Isle.\r\n\r\nOn turning an island of some two or three miles in extent this\r\nafternoon--(for since we entered the straits, we have been penetrating\r\nthe vast cluster of islands, with which the northern parts of\r\nHuron are sprinkled, of such various dimensions, that some of the\r\nsmallest, crowned with trees and shrubbery, have reminded me of the\r\ntuft of feathers in the peacock’s head, and they are scarcely less\r\nbeautiful)--on turning this island, and running into a bay of some\r\nseveral miles in diameter, we suddenly met an Indian canoe, of great\r\nbeauty, its sides and many paddles glaring with various and rich\r\ncolours, propelled by eight Indians, dressed in a singularly gaudy,\r\nyet uniform costume;--who bore down upon us with apparent intent of\r\nspeaking. But _our_ canoe, not responding with a favourable disposition\r\nto their signs, but dashing forward with unbending course, the Indians\r\nsuddenly lifted their paddles from the water, and sat down. When lo! a\r\nwhite man, well dressed, stood up in the middle of the bark, uncovered,\r\nand made obeisance. We all responded. But the distance was too great\r\nto hold a conversation. Our captain, knowing his time was precious, to\r\naccomplish the object of the day--that is, to get to the Falls, which\r\nafter all we have not reached--and being more accustomed to such sights\r\nthan we, did not show himself inclined to gratify our curiosity, in\r\ncoming to an interview. Whereupon, as the gentleman in the canoe found\r\nhe could not speak us, he resumed his sitting out of our sight; and the\r\nIndians, rising to their paddles, gave one tremendous and frightful\r\nyell, resounding through all the bay, and sending back its echoes from\r\nthe hills;--and then to a time-keeping song, they sprung away, as if\r\nin challenge, for a trial of speed with us, and darted off for the\r\ngreat lake, with a celerity, for which we all agreed to award them the\r\nvictory;--and in a few moments they turned an island, and were out\r\nof sight. This unexpected and novel exhibition threw us all into an\r\necstacy of admiration. The singular costume of the Indians, with many\r\nand various coloured feathers, bending and waving on their heads; the\r\nexquisite beauty of their canoe; their paddles of the most glaring red,\r\nso far as they are immersed; the perfect time and admirable exactitude\r\nof their movements, as if they and their bark were only so many parts\r\nof a piece of mechanism; and the amazing celerity, with which they\r\nseemed to fly over the tops of the waves;--absolutely confounded all\r\nthe ideas I had ever indulged of the Indian’s skill and dexterity in\r\nthis exercise.\r\n\r\nI would here remark, that this canoe had been charted, as was\r\nafterwards learned, by the gentleman passenger before noticed, to take\r\nhim from the Falls of St. Mary to Mackinaw, a distance of an hundred\r\nmiles, the half of which is over the open sea of Huron. This mode of\r\ntravelling in the North-West, resorted to by necessity, is not only\r\na substitute for stage-coaches and steam-boats, but is scarcely less\r\nexpeditious, when the canoe is manned and propelled by a select corps\r\nof Indians.\r\n\r\nOur passage this afternoon has been picturesque and interesting,\r\nespecially when allied to its associations, beyond my powers to\r\ndescribe. The scenery in itself stands unrivalled, by anything I have\r\never seen, or conceived, for its variety, and wildness, and beauty.\r\nAnd then it is to be observed, that scarcely a trace of man is left\r\nimprinted here, except rarely, upon the shores, may be found the\r\nmarks of a transient Indian encampment;--that the forests are so dark\r\nand thick, that the wild buck, with his branching horns, cannot run\r\namong them;--that the trees and shrubbery are of a character peculiar\r\nto the climate;--and that innumerable firs may be seen shooting up\r\ntheir conical tops, over the rest of the forest, not inferior, in the\r\nexactitude and symmetry of their proportion, to the most beautiful\r\nspire of a church. And the frequent islands, together with the straits\r\nand bays, which they necessarily create, would utterly defy any but an\r\nexperienced pilot, with his compass, to make his way from Lake Huron\r\nto Lake Superior. Often we have seemed to be running directly on the\r\nshore; when in an instant some channel, darkened by the overhanging\r\nwood, opened and invited us to enter, as the only way of egress. And\r\nthen again a half-dozen channels offer themselves, each perhaps equally\r\nattractive, and confounding choice. And their serpentine course, and\r\nthe abruptness of their angles, after once the right one is selected,\r\nby dodging the islands and shooting across the bays;--the alternate\r\nexpansions and contractions, forming successively small basins and\r\nnarrows;--contribute equally to amaze and delight the unexpecting\r\nvoyager. Hills and mountains too, in every shape--not even the likeness\r\nof which presents itself on any shore of the lakes between this region\r\nand Buffalo--here lift themselves up in near and distant vision, one\r\nabove another, restoring the long-lost charm of such a scene, and\r\nmaking the accustomed tenant of the hills at home again.\r\n\r\nThe chapter of incidents also gave additional variety and interest to\r\nthis new and rapidly shifting scene. On turning one of those sharp\r\nangles, about twenty miles above the point, where we first entered\r\nthese straits, some _lodges_ of Indians, as they are called, perched\r\nin the bushes on the bank, opened upon us, being recognised by the\r\nreflection of white birch bark, with which they are covered. These\r\nlodges, are made as light, and are as soon taken down and removed, as\r\na soldier’s camp tent. And they are the only habitations of the wild\r\nIndians, in their migratory enterprises of war, hunting, and fishing.\r\nIn these regions, indeed, they have little else to shelter them, either\r\nin winter, or summer. The _wall_ of the lodge, is a sort of mat, or\r\nwoven texture of the wild rice stalk, found growing in shallow waters;\r\nand which, after being shaken of its fruits into a floating canoe, for\r\nfood, is pulled up and manufactured into this useful article, serving,\r\nlike the Turk’s rug, for bed and chair, to the more luxurious; and\r\nalso for a part of the lodge, or house, by being drawn, itself erect,\r\nin a circle of some ten, or fifteen feet in diameter, according to the\r\nextent of the household to be accommodated;--the whole being capped\r\nwith pieces of birch bark to turn the rain; in the apex of which,\r\nordinarily from six to ten feet in elevation, is left a small aperture\r\nfor the escape of the smoke. The Indians here, depending more upon\r\nfish, than upon the chase, make these slender encampments immediately\r\nupon the margin of the waters, each consisting generally, in times\r\nof peace, of a group of a few families, with one canoe, or two, for\r\neach household, according to its number. At a few minutes’ notice,\r\nwhether started by alarm, or actuated by motives of change, the whole\r\nencampment, with all their furniture, may be seen afloat, and darting\r\noff for some new retreat. The encampment is again established, with\r\nthe same dispatch, as that, which characterised its breaking up;--and\r\nthey are all at home again, with their canoes drawn ashore, and turned\r\nbottom upwards; and the smoke is seen, emitting its lazy currents from\r\ntheir newly-erected lodges.\r\n\r\nOne of these encampments suddenly burst upon us, as we made a turning\r\nthis afternoon. Immediately a canoe, filled with these sons of the\r\nforest--and it might be added, the lords of these wild waters--with\r\nrifles in hand, launched from the shore, in our advance, and bore\r\ndown upon us. And what was amusing, the American ensign floated over\r\nit, though somewhat smoked and rent by use, or abuse. This was an\r\nindication, that a chief was on board of the canoe, as men of this rank\r\nin the Tribes within the jurisdiction of the United States, are often\r\npresented with a government flag. On the Canadian frontier they are not\r\nunfrequently able to display the flag of either nation, Great Britain,\r\nor the States, as may suit their purposes. Instantly, as they shot from\r\nthe shore, a _feu de joie_ saluted us; and the channel, pent up by\r\nthe dark forests, echoed as briskly with the popping of their rifles,\r\nas if they had been engaged in a running fight. They seemed to paddle\r\nwith one hand, and load and fire with the other; and in such rapid\r\nsuccession, that no Yankee could equal them, even with both hands. But\r\nwith all their eagerness and noise, they could not bring our captain to\r\nspeak. Whether he doubted their intent, and was afraid of being shot, I\r\ncannot tell. Perceiving the captain’s incivility, and themselves fast\r\ndropping astern of us in consequence, down went their rifles into the\r\nbottom of the canoe, and both hands of every Indian being applied to\r\nthe paddles, they seemed resolved on overtaking us: and so indeed they\r\ndid, deciding the question at once, that the Indian paddle is swifter\r\nthan steam. As a reward for this extraordinary feat,--they seeming no\r\nwise unfriendly in their dispositions, but making all signs of good\r\nfeeling, laughing, and rattling off with indescribable volubility their\r\nunintelligible jargon--we threw them a tow-line, and having caught it,\r\nthey immediately dropped under our stern;--and in this relation we\r\nheld a long parley with them, by means of an interpreter on board our\r\nvessel, ascertaining them to be of the Chippewa tribe, and possessing\r\nourselves of sundry items of information, which they were able to\r\ncommunicate, and which we were curious and much gratified to know.\r\nSome of our passengers, delighted with such a visit, threw them some\r\npieces of money; and the scramble, which ensued in the canoe, plainly\r\nproved, that however perfect their unsophisticated society may be,\r\nthey had not yet arrived to the happy condition of holding all things\r\n_common_. The amusement, which this strife occasioned, turned out to\r\nthe no small profit of the Indians. For a shower of copper and silver\r\ncoin poured into the canoe, till they all had busy work in picking it\r\nup. And when, perchance, a white piece fell into the water--(as some\r\nof them did)--alas! what a grave countenance the poor Indians put on,\r\nand smote their hands in agony, and looked up, as if they were about\r\nto expire with regret. The rattling of another piece of coin in the\r\nbottom of their canoe would bring them to their senses again, and renew\r\nthe squabble. When, however, the purse was satisfied, in rendering its\r\ncontents, a bottle of whiskey, with a cord to its neck, was lowered to\r\nthe eager grasp of these tawney and simple folk. But not being inclined\r\nto drink it on the spot, how should they dispose of it, and return the\r\nbottle, which for some reason was not offered them. It was a decanter,\r\nI believe, belonging to the steward. Necessity being the mother of\r\ninvention, a smoked tin kettle, of some gallons’ capacity, used for\r\ncooking over their fires, yet having been well cleaned by the tongue\r\nof the dogs, the common way of performing this office--was snatched\r\nup from the bottom of the canoe for the occasion, and received the\r\ncontents. The bottle was returned, and filled, and sent down again, a\r\nplural number of times; till, I am sorry to say, they had got enough,\r\nin their capacious vessel, to make the whole camp drunk--and which\r\nwill probably occasion a famous _pow-wow_, or Indian carousal. After\r\nour guests had been kept in tow long enough to satisfy curiosity, and\r\nto enrich them by these bounteous gifts, we let them drop, and they\r\nreturned to their lodges.\r\n\r\nA few miles above at another turning, another Indian camp, and much\r\nlarger than the last, opened upon us, showing an extended cluster\r\nof lodges, on the shore; and numerous canoes drawn up in the usual\r\nstyle. As they were unapprised of our coming, they seemed utterly\r\namazed--and men, women, and children ran about, and the dogs barked,\r\nas if confusion and war had come upon them. Immediately the men darted\r\nfrom their lodges, with rifle in hand, while the women and children\r\nlaunched the canoes; and in the shortest imaginable space we were right\r\non the shore, within thirty feet of this strange assemblage of human\r\nbeings;--and pop--pop--pop--went their rifles, directly at us, in a\r\nquick and furious volley, as if they would shoot every one of us from\r\nthe deck. I am sure for one, I started back, contracted myself within\r\nthe smallest possible dimensions, and dodged a little. And I dare to\r\nsay, I was not alone in these sensations. To be thus saluted, by such\r\nuncertain beings, having nothing to defend us, was not altogether\r\nwelcome. Even if their rifles had nothing in them more solid, the very\r\nwadding might have come in our faces. No one, however, was killed;\r\nand it proved to be a mere _feu de joie_, to express how glad they\r\nwere to see us. Ours is only the third Steam-packet, that has ever\r\npenetrated this region; and this particular group of Indians probably\r\nnever saw one before. We soon ran by them; but had not passed out of\r\nsight, before we plunged upon a sand-bar. This accident gave them an\r\nopportunity to fill their canoes, and come along side, and offer their\r\nassistance and hospitality: the _manner_ of which was certainly very\r\ngrateful, although the things offered were not very valuable. While we\r\nwere engaged in working off the vessel, which occupied an hour, they\r\namused us greatly by their talk and manners, and received, like our\r\nother guests, no trifling donations from the passengers--not trifling\r\nto them. Through ignorance of these channels, we have run aground some\r\nhalf-dozen times, and being overtaken by night, in this wild and dark\r\nretreat, under the very boughs of the forest, we are compelled to lie\r\nat anchor, and wait for day-light--within five miles of our place of\r\ndestination:--_the Saut de St. Marie_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE SAUT DE ST. MARIE, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Saut de St. Marie_, it may be understood, is the name given by\r\nthe French traders to the Falls, or rapids, which let the waters of\r\nLake Superior down to the level of Lake Huron. Anglice: the Falls, or\r\njump, or bound of St. Mary--or by personification, St. Mary’s leap down\r\nfrom her dominion over the waters above to assert her empire over the\r\nwaters below. Whether I have got the exact clue to the imagination of\r\nthe French Catholics, in their application of this name, and am right\r\nin my interpretation, I am not quite sure. But this has seemed to me\r\nmost natural. The Falls themselves are as lovely and as gentle, (shall\r\nI say?) as the sudden rush of such a tremendous flood, down an equable\r\ndescent of twenty-two feet in a mile, can well be imagined; and if the\r\nSpirit of the Tempest and of the Furies might be supposed to preside\r\nover Niagara’s thundering Cataract, the imagination of a Catholic\r\nmight well be allowed to instal the Holy Virgin over the rapids, which\r\nare honoured by her name--especially, as taking up his own residence\r\nthere, he might more conveniently invoke and secure her protection and\r\nblessing. But he must needs have something for her to do--she must be\r\noccupied. Why, then, say: these Falls are St. Mary--and their roaring\r\nis her voice; and when he should stand in need of her assistance, he\r\nwas sure to find her there. Hence: the _Saut de St. Marie_.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the incident before narrated, of meeting the gallant\r\nIndian canoe, propelled by eight men, and in such display of their\r\ngrotesque and glittering paraphernalia, shooting over the tops of the\r\nwaves, and scarcely touching them, I happened to be in conversation,\r\non the deck of the steamer, with a young lady, a native of the _Saut\r\nde St. Marie_, whose father was a Scotchman, or Scotch-Irish, and her\r\nmother an Indian. She was well educated, and was on her return home\r\nfrom a visit at Detroit. She was even highly accomplished, and had\r\nbeen used to the best society. Any common reader of the emotions,\r\npassing in the mind, would have seen, that when this canoe first hove\r\nin sight, this young lady’s feelings were in a lively and agreeable\r\nexcitement. The hands and arms of an infant child would not have been\r\nopened and spread out with more expressive welcome, nor would his\r\neyes have sparkled with more vivacity, at the sudden appearance of a\r\nloved object, that had been too long out of sight for his happiness,\r\nthan hers, at the sight of this Indian canoe. It was the genuine,\r\nsimple eloquence of nature, which opened the heart; on the bright\r\npage of which, sparkling with satisfaction, might be read without\r\nthe possibility of mistake: ‘I am glad. This is home. That canoe\r\nwas launched from before my mother’s door this morning. I know what\r\nit is--and who they are. That has been the delight of my youth--the\r\nfamiliar object of my childhood--it was the wonder of my infancy--and\r\nI shall be where it came from to-night.’\r\n\r\nThe sudden betraying of these emotions was so artless, as to be\r\nunavoidable. She seemed conscious, that her feelings were partly\r\nbetrayed, and made a slight effort to check and conceal them. But I\r\nencouraged the developement--for nothing could have delighted me more,\r\nor given me a higher opinion of her character; and she in turn very\r\nfrankly confessed her partialities for these objects, which connected\r\nher with home. While the canoe approached; and while it rested over\r\nagainst us; and when it darted off and disappeared, as before\r\ndescribed; the whole scene gave new being to her affections, roused the\r\nlurking and dormant sensibilities, which are naturally challenged by\r\nsuch an incident; and they were played off without restraint, and in\r\nsuch a style, as no one could fail to admire.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the next day, at the romantic and wild retreat of the Saut\r\nde St. Marie, the humble cabin, where the infancy of this young lady\r\nhad been cradled, and where her earliest years had been spent--I\r\ncould but exclaim:--What is _home_? An accident; the creature of\r\nwonted circumstances--of early and habitual associations; it is not a\r\nplace, but a mysterious centre of the affections, produced by these\r\ncasualties. It may be any where--on any spot of earth; it may be\r\nfloating on the deep, and never at rest; it may be in heaven, and ought\r\nto be there.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. When the _other_ canoe came in our wake, and hung\r\nbehind us on the tow-line, this young lady being our interpreter--my\r\nattention was forcibly arrested during these interviews, at the moral\r\npower of the Indian language, and of the conversations of Indians with\r\neach other; which I have often had occasion since to remark in other\r\ncircumstances. The dependent condition of the American Aborigines on\r\neach other for comfort and happiness, and as they religiously suppose,\r\non the high Providence above, whom they call the Great Spirit, for the\r\nsupply of their necessities--(for themselves are always improvident\r\nand frequently in want)--has imparted to their language, or manner\r\nof speaking, an indescribable softness and tenderness. It is a sweet\r\nand perfect melody. As they never think, or talk abstrusely, nor\r\ntask their minds with concatenations of logic, but speak for present\r\nconvenience and gratification;--and as they need and love kindness,\r\ntheir language is the very expression of kindness. Their dependent,\r\nchild-like feelings, a moral cause, have produced a physical effect\r\nin the structure and use of the common medium of communication\r\nbetween man and man. The entire character of the Indian’s voice, in\r\nconversation, is altogether peculiar--and that character is always of\r\nan affectionate, tender, and dependent cast. It proceeds from tender\r\nfeeling--and challenges and awakens the like affections. It has that\r\npower, and will produce that effect, when not one word of the language\r\nis understood. And it is especially remarkable, that when Indians have\r\nacquired an European language, and while conversing in it, they use a\r\nvoice characteristically and entirely different from that, which they\r\nemploy in their own tongue. Neither are they themselves aware of the\r\nfact. I once called the attention of a circle of Indian chiefs to this\r\ncircumstance, most of whom could speak English. At the moment, we were\r\n_all_ speaking English. Soon after, for their own convenience, they\r\nbroke into their own language. “_There_,” said I--“do you see?”--they\r\nproceeded, with their attention thus challenged and directed--and the\r\nnext moment, all of them burst into a loud laugh, expressive of their\r\nown astonishment at the discovery. They never knew it before.\r\n\r\nSo when this canoe came under our stern, the first salutation between\r\nthis young lady and the crew, struck me with this remarkable fact; and\r\nthe protracted conversation between the parties, was very music itself.\r\nOn the announcement of every piece of news, or the starting of a new\r\nthought, the listener, in Indian dialogue, receives it with an--_Eh?_\r\n(Is it so?)--partly nasal, and partly ringing so mellifluously\r\nin the chambers of the mouth, by an ascending and circumflex\r\nintonation, falling at last into a sweet and expiring cadence--that\r\nthe stranger hangs upon it, as upon the dying notes of the sweetest\r\nmelodies--and holds his own breath in the suspense of regret, and\r\nalmost involuntarily sighs, when the last palpable sound has died\r\nupon the ear. It cannot be imitated--it cannot be described. One must\r\nhave heard it, to know it; and to have heard it with attention,\r\nis never to forget it. It is altogether of a moral character. It\r\nexpresses politeness, in all its scope; a thorough reciprocation of the\r\nsentiment; thankfulness for the news, or suggestion; entire confidence\r\nin the person speaking; and a complete and unreserved repose of all the\r\ntender feelings on the second person of the dialogue: “_Eh? Eh. Is it\r\nso? It is so. Indeed? Indeed._” And I have only been confirmed in these\r\npeculiar attributes of Indian languages, by subsequent observation.\r\nThe women, indeed, have softer and more melodious voices, than the\r\nmen, as among all nations--and they give far better effect to these\r\npeculiarities. But the voices of the men, in their own tongue, are no\r\nless characteristically diverse in this particular.\r\n\r\nAn Indian dialogue, (and among themselves there is no people more\r\nsociable) in connexion with the melody of their voice, and the\r\ntenderness of the intonations and inflexions of their speech, is one\r\nof the finest scenes of the kind in the world. And the specimens, now\r\nunder review, were peculiarly attractive and greatly eloquent, in\r\nconsideration of the circumstances, and of the _dramatis personæ_. The\r\ncanoes, which came along side of the steamer, while lying on sand bars\r\nand at anchor, before her arrival at the _Saut_, were numerous;--and\r\nthis young lady was the interpreter, and the only colloquist on one\r\nside. _She_, cultivated and accomplished, and well dressed,--bending\r\nover the side of the vessel, to welcome and receive the welcomes of\r\nthis simple and untaught people;--and _they_, manifesting the most\r\nevident satisfaction, on her return among them; and thus demonstrating,\r\nhow much she had made herself, by her winning condescensions, the\r\nidol of a people, whom she was not ashamed to call her own. They\r\nseemed delighted, and overjoyed to hear the sound of her voice. They\r\nliterally opened their mouths and swallowed her words; and the muscles\r\nof their countenance might be seen working with the workings of their\r\nthoughts, as they hung upon her lips. And she in turn listened to\r\ntheir communications with reciprocal satisfaction--each party, as\r\nthey were alternate listeners, responding to every thought, in the\r\nutterance of their own indescribable:--_Eh?_ And the effect of this\r\nexpression is not unlike the second to an air in a piece of music:--it\r\nis an exquisite and harmonious accompaniment. It sets and keeps the\r\naffections of all the parties in tune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE FROM THE SAUT DE ST. MARIE TO GREEN BAY, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was occupied in the disembarcation of a second[5]\r\ndetachment of the troops, at the garrison of the Saut, and in the\r\ntransaction of other business appertaining to the vessel; while a\r\nsmall party went up to take a peep at the opening bosom of Lake\r\nSuperior, a few miles above; and another was entertained at dinner\r\nin the hospitable mansion, which made the _home_ of the young lady\r\nabove-mentioned. To sit down at a table, spread with furniture, and\r\nburdened with viands and wines, not unbefitting the metropolis of a\r\ncivilized community, with a pure Indian woman, acting as mistress of\r\nceremonies, who did not venture to speak a word of the vernacular\r\ntongue of her guests, that office being supplied by her son-in-law, at\r\nthe other end, and by her children around her:--and the scene laid\r\nin that remote region--was an interesting occasion, as may well be\r\nsupposed. The dinner was necessarily early and hasty, as the vessel was\r\nto leave in the afternoon to retrace her path, as far as the northern\r\nborder of Huron, to clear the islands, if possible, before night,\r\non her way to Mackinaw;--which was accomplished, with no remarkable\r\nincident, except, that, while passing rapidly down a current, in the\r\nmidst of a granite region, and under the full power of steam, the\r\npacket rubbed fearfully on the point of a rock. If the vessel had\r\ndrawn six inches more, she must inevitably have been stove and lost,\r\nthough not probably with the peril of life, as the shore was within the\r\ntoss of a stone, and the packet furnished with boats. But it would at\r\nleast have been unpleasant for such a host of passengers to be left,\r\nshipwrecked, in such a wild region.\r\n\r\nIt was on the passage from the _Saut_ to Mackinaw, that the question of\r\nthe _thirty-two thousand_ islands, on the northern and eastern margin\r\nof Lake Huron, was agitated. It was stated by one of the passengers,\r\nthat Mr. ----, who ought to know, had affirmed it. Indeed several\r\nwitnesses testified to the fact. And if so, incredible as it might\r\nseem, the reputation of that gentleman for accurate knowledge, and his\r\nopportunities of information, were entitled to settle the question.\r\nI, however, observed, that, in my own opinion, thirty-two _hundred_\r\nwas quite enough; and that there must be a mistake. Indeed I observed,\r\nthat I could hardly believe there were _thirty-two thousand_ islands,\r\nin all the waters of the continent of America. From an independent and\r\nunquestionable source of evidence, however, I was afterwards obliged\r\nto admit the fact. The record, as was affirmed, was attested from the\r\nsurveys, made by the joint Board of Commissioners of Great Britain\r\nand the United States, appointed to settle the boundary line of their\r\ncontiguous jurisdictions.[6] And the region, through which the common\r\ncharts have drawn the channel of St. Mary’s river, forms a portion of\r\nthese islands--reducing that strait to twenty-five miles in length--ten\r\nmiles below and fifteen miles above the rapids, or falls. The falls, it\r\nmay be observed, are run with safety by canoes, and have been run by a\r\nsmall vessel.\r\n\r\nThe St. Mary’s river forms three channels a little below the falls,\r\nand consequently two considerable islands, besides many smaller ones,\r\nfor the distance of fifteen to twenty miles;--and thence to Lake\r\nHuron, especially towards the east, are parts of the immense group. It\r\nis impossible for any thing, but actual observation, to estimate the\r\nunnumbered beauties, created by these sports of nature. I regretted\r\nexceedingly not to have been indulged with a stay at the Saut, long\r\nenough to have made an excursion by a canoe into Lake Superior. Some\r\nhalf dozen of our passengers, by a bold and determined push, and at the\r\nhazard of being left behind, ran up and cast a _coup d’œil_ upon the\r\nface of those interesting waters. They saw the Queen of Lakes, which,\r\nindeed, was worth the effort. The rest of us contented ourselves with\r\nproving, that the Lake commences at the head of the rapids, and having\r\nbeen there, that we saw it too.\r\n\r\nAt break of day, on Sunday morning, the 8th of August, after sailing\r\nall night upon the bosom of Lake Huron, and from the entrance of the\r\nstraits of St. Mary, the island of Mackinaw, the snow-white fort\r\nupon its rocky summit, and the beautiful town below, adorned with a\r\nChristian church, lifting up its steeple, opened upon us with a fine\r\nand most welcome display;--and at sunrise we lay still in the clear\r\nwaters of its crescent harbour, directly under the guns of the fort.\r\n\r\nIf Quebec is the Gibraltar of North America, Mackinaw is only second\r\nin its physical character, and in its susceptibilities of improvement,\r\nas a military post. It is also a most important position for the\r\nfacilities it affords, in the fur-trade, between New York and the\r\nNorth-West. From this point, the bateaux of the traders, boats of\r\nfifteen tons, go annually in the autumn to the most distant shores\r\nof Lake Superior, in one direction; and to the upper regions of the\r\nMississippi in another, laden with provisions, blankets and ammunition,\r\nand other articles of merchandize, to give the Indians in exchange\r\nfor furs;--and return to Mackinaw in the spring, where these furs are\r\nshipped for New York, by way of Buffalo. Mackinaw is used merely, as\r\na frontier garrison, and a trading post; and has a population of 600\r\nto 700. It is a beautiful island, or great rock, planted in the strait\r\nof the same name, which forms the connexion between Lakes Huron and\r\nMichigan. The meaning of the Indian name--Michillimackinack--is a\r\n_great turtle_. The island is crowned with a cap 300 feet above the\r\nsurrounding waters, on the top of which is a fortification, but not in\r\nkeeping. The principal fort, and the one kept in order and garrisoned,\r\nrests upon the brow of the rocky summit, 150 feet below the crown, or\r\ncap, and the same number of feet above the water; and in such relation\r\nto the semicircular harbour, as to command it perfectly, together\r\nwith the opposite strait. The harbour forms an exact crescent, the\r\ntips of its horns being about one mile asunder. The town itself, for\r\nthe most part, lies immediately on the crescent, near the water’s\r\nedge, and under the towering rock, which sustains the fort above. The\r\nharbour, town, and fort look with open and cheerful aspect towards\r\nthe Huron waters, south-east, inviting or frowning, according as they\r\nare approached by friend or foe. The island of Mackinaw is nearly\r\nall covered with forests of slender growth. The shores and beach are\r\ncomposed of small pebbles and gravel, without a single particle of\r\npulverized substance to cloud the transparent waters, which dash upon\r\nthem. So clear are the waters of these Lakes, that a white napkin, tied\r\nto a lead, and sunk thirty fathoms beneath a smooth surface, may be\r\nseen as distinctly, as when immersed three feet. The fish may be seen,\r\nplaying in the waters, over the sides of the various craft, lying in\r\nthe harbours.\r\n\r\nThere are two objects of natural curiosity at Mackinaw, worthy of\r\nnotice: _the arched rock and sugar-loaf_. The latter is a cone of solid\r\nrock (and when seen from one direction, it has the exact form of the\r\nloaf, after which it is named) lifting itself about 100 feet above\r\nthe plain, in the heart, and on the summit of the island, with a base\r\nof fifty feet. Some trees and shrubbery shoot out from its sides and\r\ncrevices, in defiance of the lack of soil.\r\n\r\nAs to the _arched rock_: suppose a perpendicular shore of rock, 250\r\nfeet high, on the margin of the sea--from the brow of which, in\r\nretreat, lies a romantic broken ground, and an almost impervious\r\nthicket. Then suppose a notch were scolloped out of the edge, extending\r\nback about thirty feet, and down the precipice about one hundred,\r\nmeasuring across the supposed broken edge, fifty feet. Suppose,\r\nhowever, a string of the rocky edge, three feet in diameter, still to\r\nremain, stretching across this chasm, in the form of an arch, smallest\r\nin the centre, and increasing somewhat in its dimensions towards either\r\nof its natural abutments:--and this is the picture of the _Arched Rock_\r\nof Mackinaw. From the giddy summit above, the spectator looks down\r\nupon the Lake beneath the arch, which has the appearance of an immense\r\ngate-way, erected from the delineations of art. Or, from the bosom of\r\nthe waters below, he looks up, as to the gate of heaven, inviting him\r\nto the celestial regions; and it is even possible for him to _get\r\nup_;--and then to get down again, beneath the arch;--but it is a giddy\r\ntask. And it is a still more perilous piece of sport to walk across the\r\narch itself--and yet it has been done, not only by men of nerve, but\r\nby boys in their play. In descending near the base of this arch on the\r\nright, is a natural tunnel, six feet in diameter, running down some\r\nrods through the solid rock, letting out the passengers on the shore\r\nbelow, or by which they may ascend, if they prefer it, to the broad\r\nhighway under the arch. But in ascending or descending this grand and\r\nperilous steep, the adventurer must hug the pointed rocks with the most\r\ntenacious adherence, or be precipitated and dashed in pieces at the\r\nbottom. These two objects are interesting and magnificent specimens of\r\nnature’s masonry.\r\n\r\nFrom Mackinaw to the mouth of Fox river, in the North-West Territory,\r\nthe place of destination--and which is commonly called _Green Bay_,\r\nafter the body of water, at the head of which it stands--our course was\r\nsouth-west, across Lake Michigan, and up the Bay--the whole distance\r\nbeing about 200 miles. We cast anchor in Fox river, opposite the\r\nvillage, or settlement of Green Bay, on the morning of the 10th of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE INDIAN TRIBES, THEIR POLITICAL RELATIONS, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore we introduce the particular business, intrusted to the\r\nCommission, sent to Green Bay, in 1830; and in whose company I happened\r\nto be, in their voyage through the Lakes; it will be quite necessary\r\nto the reader’s clear understanding of the general and future current\r\nof our story--that I should summon his attention to a few remarks on\r\nthe present condition and political relations of the Indian Tribes,\r\ncomprehended within the jurisdiction of the United States; and to the\r\ntreatment they have generally received, since the occupation of North\r\nAmerica by the descendants of Europeans.\r\n\r\nJust at present, however, I have more especially in view the condition\r\nand relations of the Indian Tribes of the State of New York; although\r\nI shall hereafter have occasion to extend my views, by more particular\r\nobservations, not only of all the Indians within the territories of\r\nthe United States; but of those also, who fall under the jurisdiction\r\nof the government of Great Britain, in the Canadas.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient for the present, to remark:--that although there\r\nhas generally been an _ostensible_ respect paid by Europeans, in\r\ntheir occupancy and gradual encroachments on the territories of North\r\nAmerica, to the territorial rights of the aboriginal Tribes, by holding\r\npublic councils with them, and formally negotiating for such of their\r\nlands, as have not been acquired by force and conquest;--yet it is\r\na dishonourable truth, not difficult of being made out, that the\r\nsuperior capacity of Europeans, in bargaining and over-reaching, has\r\nalmost uniformly characterized their pretended and formal purchases.\r\nThe Indians have always been and are now childlike and simple, and\r\nfrom their habitual and total desuetude of the commercial arts, are\r\never open to commercial impositions. It is well known, that they have\r\nbeen accustomed to resign, by solemn compact, the most valuable and\r\nmost extensive territories, for mere toys--or for the most trifling\r\nconsiderations. I am aware it may be and is said, that an adequate and\r\nfair value rendered, would be of no use to them--that in many, perhaps,\r\nin most cases, when money is put to their disposal, it would ever be\r\nprejudicial to their moral, and thus to their political interests.\r\nAnd for this assumption there might be some apology, if the parental\r\nguardianship, at first arrogated, were well and conscientiously\r\nsustained throughout. But the misfortune and the crime--is--that a\r\nbargain is held as a bargain, with Indians, as with all other nations.\r\nThe rapid growth and rising prosperity of European colonies in America,\r\nand their political and social interests have operated to induce them\r\nto forget their parental and moral obligations to the Aborigines.\r\nThe fact has uniformly been:--that when they have failed to provoke\r\nhostilities, and thus to acquire the opportunity of conquest, they\r\nhave negotiated away the lands of the natives, for the most trifling\r\nconsiderations; until only a few and small patches are left, that they\r\ncan call their own, within the territories settled by the whites; and\r\nthe ultimate possession of those small tracts is already anticipated by\r\nthose who covet them.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed respecting the Indians, who fall within the\r\njurisdiction of the United States, that for the most part, the national\r\ngovernment asserts the sole right of negociating for their lands. It\r\nhas happened, however, that the lands belonging to the smaller tribes\r\nof the northern and eastern States, and consequently their political\r\nexistence and relations, have long since fallen under the control of\r\nthe State governments, within whose limits they are found. It had\r\nalso happened, before the rights of Indians had been so thoroughly\r\ndiscussed, that the _pre-emption right_ of the individual States thus\r\nconcerned, was transferred, or negotiated for valuable considerations\r\nto rich capitalists, now corporate companies, and thus converted into\r\na stock, the value of which in the market depends entirely upon the\r\nnearer or more remote prospects of the removal of the Indians--in other\r\nwords, of their ejectment. Of course it becomes the interest of these\r\nstock-holders, or pre-emption right companies, to use all possible\r\nmeans of accomplishing the end they have in view; and from the almost\r\nincalculable increase of the value of the stock, they can well afford\r\nto be at any expense, that may be necessary. And the actual expense,\r\nhaving been hitherto successful, still multiplies the value of the\r\ninvestments to an indefinite amount. I cannot venture to specify the\r\namount of increase in the value of this stock, having no certain\r\ndata, only that it has been immense on the original fund; which, in\r\nthe first instance, was a loan to the State, the history of which,\r\nin its successive changes, I am not able to trace. The Indian lands,\r\nthus subjected to the speculations of land-jobbers, have risen in\r\nvalue to an amount that cannot be told, by the increase of the white\r\npopulation with which they are surrounded. This peculiar condition\r\nof Indian rights is more particularly applicable to the State of New\r\nYork, although it is virtually the same thing, when the right of\r\npre-emption is in the government, only that the government, having a\r\nhigher responsibility, is likely to be more honourable in its course of\r\nnegotiation.\r\n\r\nIt is due to the State of New York to say, that in the original\r\nnegotiations, by which this exclusive right of purchasing Indian lands\r\nwas resigned to these capitalists, the present operation of it to the\r\ndisadvantage of the Indians was not anticipated.\r\n\r\nIt may be imagined, however, that the many causes operating upon these\r\nIndians to constrain their removal are accidentally thrown very much\r\nunder the control of those who are interested; and that, when they\r\nare obliged to go, as soon they must,--and many of them have already\r\ngone, as will yet be seen,--they have no power to bring their lands\r\ninto an open market, but are compelled to accept of a price, which may\r\nsatisfy the cupidity of the pre-emption right companies--which is a\r\nvery trifling fraction of their real value at the moment. It is said,\r\nindeed, that the Indians are not _forced_ away--that their removal\r\nis voluntary. So far as the technicalities of _legal_ compulsion are\r\nconcerned, this may be true; but they are _morally_ compelled; the\r\ncauses brought to act upon them to induce this decision, are in fact\r\nirresistible.\r\n\r\nAs to the more numerous tribes of Indians, immediately connected with\r\nthe national government of the United States, and who have larger and\r\nmore momentous interests at stake, we shall by and by have occasion to\r\nnotice more particularly their relations and prospects. It may in this\r\nplace be observed generally, that the original principles asserted and\r\nthe practice pursued by those European powers, who first laid their\r\nclaims and their hands upon the American continent, and parcelled it\r\nout among themselves, laid the foundation for all the misfortunes of\r\nthe American Aborigines. Their rights then were no more regarded, than\r\nthose of the brute creation; and the arrogance of those claims, and\r\nthe consequences resulting from them, will doubtless become more and\r\nmore the wonder of the world, as society advances, and the rights of\r\nall men shall be better defined. They actually formed the basis and\r\nprescribed the modes of a new constitution of society between emigrant\r\nEuropeans and the aboriginal Americans--a state of society which has\r\nbeen in operation for ages, and the unfortunate influence of which will\r\nextend for ages yet to come, if it does not thoroughly and for ever\r\nannihilate those numerous, interesting, and in many respects noble and\r\nmanly tribes, whose origin and early history time nor chance has yet\r\nunfolded. Society once constituted, on a large and momentous scale,\r\nis not easily changed; and we shall yet have occasion to see, that\r\neven the American republicans, in the face and in direct contradiction\r\nof their own declared principles, have entrenched themselves on this\r\noriginal ground to defend their treatment of the Indians. Like African\r\nslavery, entailed upon them by the sins of former generations, they\r\nhave presumed to hold, by the law of precedent and the right of\r\nprescription, the nobler race of the red men of America, in a condition\r\nof grievous disadvantage, and subjected them to an unrelieved doom\r\nof the greatest injustice. They plead the high authority of long\r\nestablished national law in relation to barbarians--an apology, indeed,\r\nfor want of a better reason, but no justification. It was natural, that\r\nthe treatment originally instituted should continue; the relations\r\nfirst formed, for reasons of State, gradually become subject to the\r\ninexorable laws of State necessity. What one generation had done,\r\nanother might think itself authorized, nay, in a manner, might deem\r\nitself compelled, to do. The injustice became incorporated with the\r\nessential economy and with the ordinary administration of society. Like\r\nslavery it could never find a remedy, except in the sacrifice of some\r\ngreat interests, which had long enjoyed the right of prescription; and\r\nreformation, in the practical application of political morality, it\r\nis too well known, is but gradually and slowly attained, even after\r\na distinct and public recognition of better principles has been long\r\nand universally made. We shall see, that the American Indians are even\r\nyet treated most unjustly, and most inconsistently with recognized\r\nprinciples; and while we boldly assert the rightful claims of the\r\noppressed, it will be no more than fair to keep constantly in view the\r\norigin and history of the wrong, and the manner in which it has passed\r\nfrom generation to generation.\r\n\r\nSome recent measures of the American government, in endeavouring to\r\neffect the removal of the Indian tribes on the east of the Mississippi\r\nto the west of it, have agitated the public mind in that country to\r\nan unprecedented degree, and occasioned the fullest and most public\r\ndiscussion of Indian rights in every possible form; and although\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States, the third and a co-ordinate\r\nbranch of the government, has finally settled the great principles\r\nof the question to their own honour and to the honour of the nation,\r\nand thus far made an atonement to the injured and to the world for a\r\npractical course of injury, which, having passed an important crisis,\r\ncannot be so easily arrested, even with all the advantages of such a\r\ndecision--that decision is notwithstanding an event of the greatest\r\nimportance.[7] It will have its weight in the nation, and its influence\r\nover the world. It is of the highest possible authority, and may fairly\r\nbe quoted, as an expression of the public opinion of the country,\r\nnotwithstanding that the accidental combination of certain political\r\ncauses has transiently sustained a course of administration opposed\r\nto it. And although it will be my duty in these pages to expose the\r\ninjuries done to the American Indians, and to speak with great freedom,\r\nas an impartial regard to the common rights of man demands, I am proud\r\nto find myself sustained by the decisions of that venerable tribunal.\r\nWhat would otherwise be to the dishonour of my country, and which can\r\nnever be concealed, I shall the less reluctantly handle, being in such\r\ncompany. The acknowledgment, and if possible, the confirmation of the\r\nrights of American Aborigines, is a cause which belongs to all nations;\r\nit is at least and practically a common cause between the people of\r\nGreat Britain and the United States, as each of these governments\r\nhas nearly an equal number of this race under its jurisdiction, and\r\nis necessarily obliged to legislate for their weal, or woe. I regard\r\nthe decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, as involving\r\nand settling principles, from which neither of these two nations can\r\nin sobriety and justice depart; and while I shall freely expose any\r\nviolation of these principles, that may come in my way, I consider,\r\nthat I am not only discharging a duty to a long oppressed and injured\r\npeople, but I am proud, in being able to appeal to the above-named\r\ndecision of the American Supreme Court, the authority and destined\r\ninfluence of which is at least as much a subject of national triumph,\r\nas the heretofore injurious treatment done to the Indians, is a subject\r\nof regret--and but for this atonement, an occasion of shame, nay, in\r\nany case, a shame.\r\n\r\nIt happens, as before suggested, that Great Britain is involved in\r\na like responsibility, in regard to American Aborigines, as the\r\ngovernment of the United States. Not, that the subject, in the hands\r\nof the British government, is in the same shape; but it is, at best,\r\nin a bad shape. These two nations, which ought to cherish the kindest\r\nfeelings towards each other, and which possess unrivalled powers\r\nto benefit mankind, are alike and simultaneously responsible for\r\nthe exercise of a direct ameliorating influence, by legislation and\r\ngovernment, over two unfortunate and depressed classes of the human\r\nrace: the Africans and American Indians. The condition of the former\r\nclass, and the duties which they may rightfully claim from these two\r\nGovernments, I do not at present undertake to discuss.\r\n\r\nIt is sufficient for my present purpose, and perhaps it may not be\r\ndeemed improper to state the fact: that, as the British territories,\r\nin North America, are very extensive, and all of them peopled by\r\nthese tribes, they must be numerous; and many of them so remote in\r\nthe western and northern regions, that even a tolerably accurate\r\ncensus has probably never yet been obtained. Whether their numbers\r\nare equal to those within the jurisdiction of the United States, is\r\nnot material. I would take liberty here to mention another thing,\r\nnot because I am solicitous to bring the British government into the\r\nsame condemnation;--but yet I am sufficiently informed--that the\r\ngovernment of the Canadas is in the habit of assuming and asserting\r\nthe right of removing the Indians, without their consent, from the\r\nlands they have occupied from time immemorial. It is true, that the\r\nBritish population of the Canadas has never crowded so hard upon the\r\nIndians, as the population of the United States; and consequently has\r\nnever brought their rights so urgently and so publicly in question.\r\nAnd farther: as the government of the Canadas is not accustomed even\r\nto _moot_ the question of the territorial rights of the Indians, but\r\nassumes the disposal of them, as parents assign a place for their\r\nchildren, in their own discretion, there has been no occasion of\r\ncontroversy--neither is controversy possible, until the Indians are\r\nadmitted in court, as a party,--unless they resort to the tomahawk.\r\nIn _principle_, therefore, and in practice, so far as there has been\r\noccasion for it, it is unnecessary to say, how much less the government\r\nof the Canadas is in fault, in regard to the acknowledgment of Indian\r\nrights, than the government of the United States;--except that, the\r\nformer has never promised, so far as I know, and then violated\r\npromise. The rapid extension of the population of the Union, and the\r\nold and public engagements of the government with the Indian tribes,\r\nguaranteeing their rights, have brought those rights into public and\r\nearnest discussion. And it must be confessed, that notwithstanding\r\nthe public registry of treaties, and notwithstanding the recent\r\nsolemn decision of the Supreme Judiciary of the nation, defining and\r\naffirming the rights of the Indians in all that they ask, those rights\r\nare yet in a train of actual violation. The decision of a Court is\r\nnot sufficiently active to arrest and turn such an immense tide of\r\ninjustice in a day.\r\n\r\nSo far, therefore, as there may be any disclosures in these pages\r\nof a dishonourable political character, it will be seen, that they\r\nare, in a great measure, equally applicable to the two governments\r\nof Great Britain and the United States;--except that, by accidental\r\ncircumstances, the great question has come earlier to its crisis, under\r\nthe administration of the latter, than of the former. It is a grave\r\ntruth, that neither community can say to the other: You are guilty of a\r\ngreat sin in this matter. The world and heaven have laid the charge at\r\nthe door of each: Ye are both alike responsible, and both guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nVINDICATION OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS FROM THE CHARGE OF BEING SAVAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the world have agreed in attaching a severe and savage character\r\nto the American Aborigines in war; and as I may yet have repeated\r\noccasions to develop and describe somewhat of these features in\r\nthe progress of this story; it is due to that people, that some\r\nexplanations should be made, and that they should realize the benefit\r\nof all the apology of the circumstances in history, which have\r\ncontributed to form that character. Otherwise they may be robbed\r\nof a portion of that sympathy, the full scope of which they have a\r\nright to claim. It is no more than fair--it is due to say, that they\r\nare not so bad, as these acts of cruelty would seem to indicate. Nay\r\nmore: they are generally kind--they are often heroically generous.\r\nTheir domestic character is tranquil and affectionate; and their\r\nhospitality is bounded only by their slender means of affording comfort\r\nto the stranger. Their fidelity and devotion, when once their faith\r\nis pledged, is unrivalled--it is romantic. They are not less true and\r\npersevering and heroic in their friendships, than terrible in war.\r\nSuch is the universal testimony of all, who have ever known them. So\r\nkind and amiable are they at home, and in peace, that they invariably\r\nsecure the tenderest regard of those, who have had opportunity to\r\nwitness these developments of their character. But for their extreme\r\ndeprivation of the common comforts of civilized communities, it\r\nwere almost a temptation to those, who have experienced the selfish\r\nfriendships and the hollow courtesies of a more refined condition of\r\nsociety, to go and take up their abode among them. And the well known\r\nfact, that the _savage_, as he is called, can never be contented to\r\nlive away from home, whatever munificent and dazzling offers are made\r\nto him--demonstrates most incontrovertibly, that there are charms\r\nin the state of society among the American Aborigines, which have\r\ntheir foundation and their secret in the amiable susceptibilities and\r\nkind offices of our nature. Habit has its moral power, indeed. But\r\nthis cannot be the mere force of habit. The indulgence of the bad\r\npassions can never make man happy. They will fly from the storm,\r\nas soon as they have an opportunity. But the Indian of America will\r\nnever be contented beyond the bosom of his own tribe--much less in\r\na civilized community. Plant him there, and he is vacant--his eye\r\nwanders unsatisfied. Treat him with all possible kindness, and he still\r\nremembers with undying regret the kindness of his home. Tempt him by\r\nthe most attractive offers--and he will turn from them, and say--“Let\r\nme go home.”\r\n\r\nI say, then, that there is a moral secret of an amiable character,\r\nthat has created these attachments. It is not the roughnesses of life,\r\nthat have thus won and chained under these unyielding and indissoluble\r\nbonds the domestic affections of the Indian; but it was the long and\r\nhabitual experience of inartificial kindness--a kindness, of which he\r\ncould not find even a type in the new condition, to which he had been\r\ntransferred; and therefore he sighed for his home.\r\n\r\nHow, then, shall we account for the cruelties of the American\r\nAborigines, as attributed to them in the records of their warfare?--How\r\ncan these amazing contrarieties of character be reconciled?--For myself\r\nI do not think the task insurmountable. Nay--it is easy. In the first\r\nplace, there have been, as always occurs in such narratives, egregious\r\nexaggerations. Imagination always invests the horrible with greater\r\nhorrors, than what legitimately belong to it. But with all the prunings\r\nof exact history, it must be confessed, that Indian warfare in America,\r\nis horrible enough. And I here undertake the task of explanation--and\r\nI will add, of some show of apology.\r\n\r\nThe American Indian, in his wild condition, it must be understood, is,\r\nin intellectual and moral culture, a _barbarian_. He is an improvident,\r\nuncultivated child of nature--prompted to action only by his present\r\nnecessities. Yet he is a man. He loves comfort and happiness, as much\r\nas he can get by the least possible pains; and while undisturbed by\r\nthe menaces of foes, his greatest happiness consists in loving and\r\nbeing loved. In all his domestic relations, therefore, he is kind. And\r\nin accordance with the same disposition, he is hospitable. Whatever\r\nof good, and of the best, that is reckoned such among themselves,\r\nbelongs to his guest. There is nothing in his power, which he will\r\nnot surrender. And all this while his native energies lie dormant. He\r\ndelights in a lazy, indolent existence. When roused by hunger, he will\r\npursue the chase with wakeful vigilance and intense exertion. And when\r\nhe returns with his game, he satiates his appetite, and lies down\r\nto sleep, not caring for the necessities of to-morrow, or the coming\r\nweek. His wife and daughters cultivate the corn, and gather the wild\r\nrice; while himself and sons, after intervals of repose, provide their\r\nslender larder with venison, and fish, and fowl.\r\n\r\nBut their humble and unenviable condition is yet liable to be annoyed\r\nby foes; and so defenceless are they, that surprise is fatal. If they\r\nsuspect hostilities, from another tribe, or are made aware of such\r\ndesign, they know well, that the annihilation of their enemies is their\r\nonly security;--and that their own extirpation will be as assiduously\r\nsought for. And thus, by the necessities of their condition, vigilance\r\nand vengeance become their watchword. The indolent savage starts\r\nup from his long repose, convokes a council of war, and lights\r\nthe fires of grave and solemn deliberation; and the purpose being\r\npublicly resolved, either in self-defence, or for the avengement of\r\nsupposed injury, the war-dance is immediately arranged, as the form of\r\nenlistment for the enterprise. The reasons of the war are announced to\r\nthe assembled tribe, with all the peculiar powers of Indian oratory,\r\nand by the most impassioned appeals to the excited feelings of the\r\nuntutored savage;--and their enemies are publicly and solemnly devoted\r\nto death and vengeance. The pride of their nation, their wives and\r\nlittle ones, their cabins, their hunting and fishing grounds, their\r\nterritories claimed by the prescriptive right of possession, the\r\ngraves and spirits of their fathers--their own lives, dear to all, and\r\nnow menaced by impending war;--every fact and circumstance, that is\r\nprecious in present possession, or dear to hope;--all, that belongs to\r\nlife, and all that is mysterious and awful in religion--are invoked,\r\nand brought in with all the power of their wild poetry and savage\r\nrhetoric, to shake off the lethargies of peace, and kindle the passions\r\nfor war. The softer feelings are quenched, and the tender ties of life\r\nabsolved. The tomahawk is thrown upon the ground, as a gauntlet--and\r\nthe dissonant sounds of their martial instruments, “grating harsh\r\nthunder,” mingled with the deep and hoarse murmur of the solemn chaunt\r\nof the war-song, raised by an awful choir of ventriloquists--and every\r\nnow and then suddenly broken by the sharp and piercing explosion of\r\nthe fiendly war-whoop;--all dancing and jumping, in utmost disorder,\r\naround the fire, naked, painted, and feathered, with tomahawk in hand,\r\neach of hideous aspect, and together making a hideous group;--these\r\nall, and numerous other characteristic concomitants of the scene,\r\nconstitute the challenge, which is made upon the assembled warriors, to\r\ntake up the gauntlet, and thus pledge themselves to the destruction of\r\ntheir enemies. Nothing can exceed the effect of these solemnities on\r\nthe passions of the Indian. His former tranquil spirit is thoroughly\r\nexorcised, and he is suddenly transformed into a fanatic and a madman.\r\nAnticipating well the doom, that awaits him, if he falls into the\r\nhand of his enemies, he works up all his passions to a fearlessness\r\nof death, and to a contempt of every imaginable cruelty. He turns his\r\nback, and steels his heart to all domestic endearments. He fasts--he\r\nlacerates his own flesh, and accustoms himself to the patient and\r\nunflinching endurance of pain and agony, by the inflictions of his own\r\nhand. And when the Indian is thus prepared for war, no torment, however\r\ningeniously devised, however cruelly inflicted, can cause a single\r\nmuscle of his frame to quiver. All his feelings and passions are too\r\nstout to be subdued by such inventions. He arms himself alike to endure\r\nthem, and to inflict them. Such are the necessities, and such is the\r\ncustom of Indian warfare. It knows no mercy. He becomes a war-stricken\r\nand blood-thirsty maniac, from the moment of his enlistment, till he\r\nfalls by the hand of his foe, or returns victorious to his home. He\r\nis elevated above the atmosphere, and thrown beyond the circumference\r\nof all ordinary human sympathies. For the time, he is not a man--he\r\nis more than a man. He has been excited to a condition of mental\r\nintoxication--of spiritual inebriety--and maintains it. The state of\r\nhis passions is a mere artificial product. It is not the nature of\r\nman--it is not the nature of the Indian--but the effect of an adopted,\r\na cherished, an inflexible principle, which, if not necessary, he at\r\nleast imagines to be so. And woe be to him--woe to the man, or the\r\nwoman, or the child, that bears the mark of his enemies, and falls in\r\nhis power. He has taken a solemn religious sacrament, that absolves\r\nhim from tenderness, that makes tenderness a crime, if it be shown to\r\na foe. In war the American Indian is indeed a _barbarian_. What else\r\ncould be expected from his untutored condition--from his uncultivated\r\nnature? Cunning, and stratagem, and cruelty are to him a necessary\r\npolicy--because such is the policy of his enemies. They know not--they\r\ncannot be expected to know the refinements of civilized warfare. And\r\nit is at least a question, whether the more magnanimous onset and\r\nthe softer clemency of a conqueror, among civilized nations, are to\r\nwash away the crime, by which, in his march to the attainment of his\r\nlaurels, he has desolated human happiness and life on the largest\r\nscale;--while the savage blow, which affords no time to anticipate\r\ncalamity, and leaves no widow or fatherless child to weep a long and\r\ntedious way to the grave, is alone to be damned in human opinion.\r\n\r\nAnd can it be expected of the Indian, when he makes war upon the\r\nwhite man--or rather, when the white man has _provoked_ him to war,\r\nthat he will conform to the usages of civilized nations? How can he\r\ndo it? If he fights, he must fight in his own way. In his creed,\r\nsurprise is his lawful advantage, and extirpation his necessity. And\r\nunder the same artificial and unnatural excitement, and with the same\r\ndetermination, and from the same coverts of the forest and the night,\r\nfrom which he pounces upon the foe of his own race, he springs also\r\nupon the unexpecting village of the white man, wraps it suddenly\r\nin flames, and if it be possible, leaves not a soul to tell the\r\nstory of their calamity. Although we cannot love this part of their\r\ncharacter--although we are shocked at the story of such warfare--yet\r\nmay we find a reason for it, in the habits and circumstances of these\r\nwild children of nature--a reason, which, if it does not approach to\r\nan apology, may yet leave them possessed of elements of character,\r\nwhich, in their tranquil moments are worthy of our esteem and our\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nIt remains yet to be told, that the American Aborigines have scarcely\r\never waged a wanton war upon the European colonists--and perhaps it\r\nought to be said--_never_. They received European settlers originally\r\nwith open arms--they generously parted with their lands, piece by\r\npiece, for the most trifling considerations--and always manifested\r\na friendly disposition, so long as no just occasion of suspicion\r\nand hostility was afforded. They regarded the white man as a\r\nsuperior being--as indeed he was. They reverenced him; and they were\r\nnever easily provoked to enter into strife. That the rapid growth\r\nand gradual encroachments of the European colonists were natural\r\noccasions of jealousy, may easily be imagined. The Aborigines saw\r\nthemselves deprived of one territory after another, their hunting\r\ngrounds destroyed, their fishing privileges monopolised, and their\r\nmeans of subsistence in consequence gradually failing. They retired\r\ninto the wilderness--and still the white men trode upon their heels.\r\nOccasionally private quarrels awakened resentment, and sowed the seeds\r\nof public contest. And is it a matter of wonder,--that the Indian\r\nwas provoked? that he began to assert his rights, and meditate their\r\nrecovery? The whole history of Indian warfare in America proves, that\r\nnot only in their ignorance, but in nature, and in reason, it was to be\r\nexpected. And no less was it to be expected, that they would conduct\r\ntheir wars in their own way. They have done many cruelties, and those\r\ncruelties have been made an apology for taking possession of their\r\ninheritance. After all that has been said of their savage nature,\r\nthey are uniformly found a meek, and patient, and long-suffering\r\nrace. I do conscientiously consider it a libel on their character to\r\ncall them _savages_;--and my only reason for conforming to this usage\r\noccasionally, is simply because it is usage;--for the same reason that\r\nwe call them American Aborigines.\r\n\r\nIt is moreover to be observed, that the character of all the Indian\r\ntribes, within the jurisdiction of the States _proper_, has long since\r\nbeen greatly modified by their intercourse and intimacies with the\r\nwhites--in some respects for the better, in others for the worse.\r\nSo far as they have caught the vices of the whites, and acquired\r\nthe use of ardent spirits, it has been worse, and even ruinous for\r\nthem. But despairing of success in war against these intruders on\r\nthe graves of their fathers, all those tribes, which have been more\r\nor less encircled and hemmed in by the white settlements, have not\r\nonly lost their original wildness, and intrepidity of character,\r\nbut such, as have not become debased by intemperance, have been\r\ngreatly softened;--and not a few of them exhibit the most exemplary\r\nspecimens of civilized manners--and some are even highly cultivated\r\nand refined. They have men and chiefs, who have been well educated\r\nat the colleges and universities of the United States, who would do\r\nhonour to any society, and who are capable of executing with great\r\nability a consistent and dignified current of political diplomacy with\r\nthe general Government, in defence of their own rights. Specimens\r\nof this character will be abundantly developed in the course of our\r\nnarrative. They are no longer objects of dread--and may fairly assert\r\ntheir claims to admission within the pale of civilized communities.\r\nWe of course speak of those, who have been surrounded and impaled\r\nby civilization itself. There are tribes, who are yet wild--some in\r\nthe North-West Territory, on the east of the Mississippi;--and many\r\nnations of this description, scattered over the vast regions between\r\nthe Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean. But all the tribes within the\r\nboundaries of the organized States--especially the older States--are\r\nmore or less civilized. They are an unoffending, tractable, and docile\r\npeople. And the efforts of the benevolent for their intellectual and\r\nmoral cultivation, as well as for their improvement in the useful arts\r\nof life, have been abundantly rewarded--as we shall have occasion to\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nGRADUAL EXTINCTION OF THE INDIAN TRIBES IN THE EASTERN STATES, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already recognised the fact--that the aboriginal tribes of\r\nNorth America have been compelled to retire before the encroachments\r\nof the European occupants of their ancient territories. The district\r\nof New England, comprehending all that part of the American Union,\r\nwhich lies east of Hudson river, except a narrow strip of territory,\r\nfalling within the state of New York, was originally found tenanted\r\nby these tribes. But where are they now? They were once numerous\r\nand formidable--they were even rivals in political importance,\r\nand in war. A few scores of the Mohecans, are yet to be found in\r\nMontville, Connecticut; and are seen wasting away, and will probably\r\nsoon disappear, like many other tribes of New England, whose names\r\nare almost forgotten. The Narragansetts, of Rhode Island, and some\r\nrelics of the Peguods, once the terror and scourge of the colonists\r\nunder their politic and famed chieftains, Sassacus and Philip,[8] are\r\nlingering out an expiring existence. Some little and insulated hordes\r\nare yet found in the State of Maine. Besides these, there are a few\r\nother remnants, scattered here and there, but scarcely known.--In all\r\nnow remaining in New England, there are only--2,573! Alas! they have\r\nhad their day--they had their importance--they were a proud race,\r\nand believed themselves the best. But where are they now? The high\r\nProvidence of heaven will justify himself--but will he not also require\r\ntheir blood at the hands of their extirpators? Could they not have been\r\nsaved? Undoubtedly they could.\r\n\r\nThe State of New York, which it should be recollected lies immediately\r\non the west and south borders of New England, still retains in its\r\nbosom some important relics of these ancient tribes: a few at Montauk\r\nPoint, on the east end of Long Island;--some considerable bodies in\r\nthe heart of the State, near Utica;--some on the line of Genessee\r\nRiver;--the Tonewantas, in Genessee County;--the Tuscaroras, at\r\nLewiston, near Niagara;--and the Senecas, a part of whom are near\r\nBuffalo, and others farther up the Lake;--in all throughout the\r\nState:--5,184! As I shall have occasion to notice the numerous tribes\r\nin other States, and in the Western Territories, in another place, I\r\npurposely overlook them here, for the sake of coming more directly to\r\nthe field, which is destined to occupy the remainder of this volume.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes of New York, like those of other States, retain what\r\nare called “_Reservations_” of territory, under an assumed guardianship\r\nof the commonwealth. These “Reservations” consist of certain lands,\r\nwhich have been found in the actual possession of the Indians, in\r\ntheir last retreats before the incursions of the white man. In the\r\nprogress of the white settlements, as they have gradually encircled\r\nthese tribes, it has been found necessary to make surveys and fix the\r\nexact boundaries, beyond which the citizens of the State should have\r\nno right to trespass--leaving the Indians in possession of territories\r\nand privileges, defined by special statutes. So far the parental\r\nguardianship of the State over the Indians, has been kind. But it\r\nhas also happened, in the progress of events, and by the indomitable\r\ncupidity of land-jobbers, anticipating the final and thorough ejectment\r\nof the Indians, that the _pre-emption right_ of their territories,\r\nunder a general supervision of the State, and in consideration of which\r\nthe State has realized a certain _bonus_, has fallen into the hands\r\nof corporate companies--as before recognised--which necessarily and\r\nfor ever excludes the Indians from a fair and open market of their\r\nlands. No private citizens can negotiate for their territories, as\r\ncitizens negotiate with one another. It has moreover happened, that the\r\nIndians, being good judges of land, have always been found upon the\r\nbest;--and consequently, that their reservations are most covetable.\r\nHence, from the cupidity of these pre-emption companies, no pains\r\nhave been spared to multiply the causes, and hasten the occasions of\r\ntheir removal. Inconveniences, restrictions, and annoyances, naturally\r\nresulting from their insulated condition, and aggravated by the\r\ndevices of these interested corporations, have been made to bear upon\r\nthe tribes so habitually, and so severely, that they have long since\r\nbegan to feel strong inducements to remove into regions, where they\r\nmight be exempt from these vexatious molestations; and where they\r\nmight enjoy privileges more congenial to their tempers and habits.\r\nThe attachments of the aboriginal Americans to the graves of their\r\nfathers is proverbial. “But a perpetual dropping weareth a stone.” It\r\nwas impossible, that even this strong and undying passion, an innate\r\nprinciple, a religious virtue in man, should not ultimately yield to\r\nthe almost innumerable and the aggravated discomforts of life, of which\r\nthey have found themselves the subjects in the State of New York, by\r\nthe causes already adduced. The time had not come, when they could\r\namalgamate with the citizens. The law allowed them no common rights of\r\ncitizenship. They are to this moment a proscribed race--liable indeed\r\nto the force of special statute, if they offend;--but for ever barred\r\nfrom the protection of common law, and excluded from the common rights\r\nof the community. Their certain doom, therefore, in remaining on their\r\nancient territories, thus surrounded and thus proscribed, must be a\r\nfinal and inevitable extinction of their tribes.\r\n\r\nIn these unpleasant and hopeless circumstances, the Rev. Dr. Morse,\r\nknown to the world, not only as a most respectable and useful divine\r\nof New England, and as a compiler of Universal Geography, in American\r\nLiterature--but more recently and still more publicly known, as the\r\nauthor of a Report to the American Congress, on the condition and\r\nstatistics of the Aborigines; having been commissioned by that body\r\nto travel and collect information on this subject--and returning from\r\nhis researches in the North-West Territory in 1820, suggested, in the\r\nbenevolence of his heart, to the chiefs and most influential men\r\nof the New York Indians--whose removal at that time both policy and\r\nbenevolence seemed to recommend--that the territory above mentioned\r\nwould be a suitable retreat for the Indians of that State; and\r\nrecommended to them to open negotiations with the general Government\r\nfor that purpose. “_That_,” said the Rev. Doctor, “is in all respects\r\na country to be desired by Indians. It is a mild climate--the land is\r\ngood, the forests full of game, and the lakes and rivers abounding\r\nwith fish. The region itself is not only remote from the territories\r\nclaimed by the individual States; but it is in the exclusive occupancy\r\nof Indian tribes, and destined in the plan of the national government\r\nfor that purpose. Besides, it is vast, and not only sufficient for the\r\ntribes already there, but more than sufficient for all your purposes\r\nand theirs. There you need not fear the encroachments of the white\r\nman. Go--and look. Hold a council-fire with the wild nations, which\r\nnow occupy the territory. Tell them, you are their brothers, come\r\nfrom the rising sun--and that you want a place among them; and when\r\nthey shall have agreed to receive you in peace, the government of the\r\nUnited States will for ever guarantee to yourselves and your children\r\nsuch possessions, as your brethren there may agree to award for your\r\ninheritance. You will never again be disturbed. The white man will\r\nnever go there. He will never desire those lands. They are too far\r\noff. And besides, there is a natural boundary, the great Lakes, to\r\ndefend you for ever from such incursions. Sell your lands here--take\r\nwhat is necessary of the money to satisfy the native tribes of those\r\nregions, for giving you a home, and put the rest in the hands of your\r\ngreat Father, at the city of Washington, who will keep it safely for\r\nyour use. Here you can no longer live in comfort. Go yonder, and\r\nprosper. The Government wish you to go there. As you have long been in\r\nfriendship with the President of the United States, and as you have\r\nacquired much of the manners and arts of civilized life, your father,\r\nthe president, knows, that you will help him keep the peace with those\r\nwild nations; and that you will there be a benefit to him, and he can\r\nbe a benefit to you. He will protect and defend you, and secure you\r\nfor ever in all your rights;--and you may be the means of raising\r\nthose nations, along with your own progressive improvement, under the\r\nfostering hand of the President, to civilization and happiness.”[9]\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Doctor was sincere in his advice--he was honest--he gave\r\nit out of the benevolence and fulness of his kind heart. He did not\r\neven imagine, that in less than _ten_ years, even after these solemn\r\nstipulations should have been consummated, and the parties entered upon\r\nthe possession of their inheritance, a plan would be laid to erect that\r\nvery territory into a member of the Federal Union, and to eject these\r\nemigrant Indians, together with the ancient and native tribes, into\r\nother and unknown regions!\r\n\r\nAnimated by these reports and representations from so venerable\r\nand worthy a man, the authorities of the New York tribes opened\r\na correspondence with the official organs of the Government at\r\nWashington; and Mr. Monroe, President of the United States, ordered the\r\nproper authorities to execute letters of approbation, and to afford all\r\nneedful facilities to the chiefs of the Indians of the State of New\r\nYork:--first--in accomplishing a visit of inspection to the North-West\r\nTerritory, and in holding a friendly council with the tribes of those\r\nregions, to open their designs, and to confer mutually on the great\r\npurpose;--and next, if they should succeed in negotiating with the\r\nnative tribes, to supervise and facilitate the arrangements, so that\r\nnothing on the part of Government should be wanting in the attainment\r\nof their object.\r\n\r\nIt is proper here to observe, that the government of the United States\r\nhave ever been accustomed to recognise in principle and in form the\r\nright of the Indian tribes over the territories, of which they are\r\nfound in actual possession and use. But as the Government asserts a\r\ngeneral jurisdiction within all the boundaries settled between itself\r\nand other civilized powers, it claims a supervision in all negotiations\r\nof territory between the Indian tribes themselves, and requires its own\r\napprobation and seal to ratify them. The Government also disallows of\r\nall negotiations of lands directly from Indians to private citizens,\r\nand asserts the pre-emption right. These rules are alike applicable to\r\nthe claims of the general Government, in relation to Indian territories\r\n_without_ the bounds of the several States, and to the claims of\r\nthe individual States, in relation to Indian territories _within_\r\ntheir bounds;--except in such cases, where the supervision of Indian\r\nterritories within the States, still vests in the general Government by\r\nthe force of original right and unaltered covenants.\r\n\r\nIn 1821 and 1822 successively, delegations of the New York tribes,\r\ncomposed of the Rev. Mr. Williams and other chiefs, visited the\r\nNorth-West Territory, and succeeded to their satisfaction in\r\nnegotiating with the native tribes, under the full authority and\r\napprobation of the President of the United States--accompanied by\r\nan agent of government to supervise the transactions. The New York\r\ntribes entered into solemn treaties with the tribes of the North-West,\r\npurchased of them specific territories for specific and valuable\r\nconsiderations; and laid the foundation, as was hoped, for a general\r\nand speedy removal of all the Indians of New York into that territory.\r\nThe President of the United States became a party to the engagements,\r\nand ratified all the transactions, and duly certified copies were\r\ndeposited in the proper office at Washington, and left in the hands\r\nof the parties. And it was officially and distinctly stated, as the\r\npurpose of Government, and a pledge to that effect given--that white\r\nmen should be excluded from that territory. This pledge was given, as\r\na motive to induce the New York Indians to emigrate--inasmuch as the\r\nGovernment had an interest in settling them there, that their good\r\nexample might have a happy influence on the native and more untutored\r\nIndians. There were also political reasons for getting them out of the\r\nState of New York--reasons, operating between the State and national\r\nGovernments--and reasons, such as the pre-emption companies, in the\r\nway of influence, were able to wield.\r\n\r\nThe Stockbridge tribe sold their lands, and removed almost immediately.\r\nThe Oneidas, with Mr. Williams at their head, did the same. The\r\nBrothertons began to make their arrangements to follow. And all proper\r\ninducements were gradually operating on the minds of the other tribes,\r\nwho had not at first taken so deep an interest in the enterprise, and\r\nwho were more reluctant to engage in it. They were not so immediately\r\nunder the influence of Mr. Williams, who had been the main-spring of\r\nthe movement, and whose enlarged mind and foresight had thoroughly\r\ncomprehended all the disadvantages of their condition, and the destiny\r\nto which they must be doomed in the State of New York. But under the\r\nauspices of these arrangements, their prospects were now brightened.\r\nA new and interesting field of Indian society and of Indian empire,\r\nremote from the encroachments and defended against the incursions of\r\nthe white man, and under all the improvements of civilization and\r\nthe advantages of Christianity, opened before them. The government\r\nof the United States was pledged to maintain the engagements between\r\nthe tribes themselves, to defend their rights against the cupidity of\r\ncitizens from the States, and to lend all convenient aid in promoting\r\ntheir general improvement. It was indeed an interesting and a hopeful\r\nvision. The day of their redemption seemed nigh at hand. A wide and\r\nbeautiful country, well suited to the nature and habits of the Indian,\r\nfar off beyond the inland seas, skirted on the east by the long and\r\nwide bosom of Michigan, a good natural boundary between the Indian\r\nand the white man; promised for ever by the faith, and for ever to\r\nbe defended by the arm, of a great nation, as the home and sanctuary\r\nof the hitherto abused and persecuted children of the forest; their\r\ngreat father, the President of this nation, engaging to keep the peace\r\namong themselves, if any of them should quarrel, as their fathers in\r\ntheir wild condition had been accustomed;--promising to send them\r\nimplements of agriculture and of all the useful arts of civilization,\r\nand teachers of their children, and ministers of the religion of the\r\nwhite man, to point them the way to the white man’s heaven;--and\r\npromising to watch with parental tenderness over all their interests,\r\npolitical and social, and to raise them as high in character and in\r\nhappiness, as their white brothers, who sit under the protection\r\nand enjoy the privileges of the same good Government. Such were the\r\npromises, and such the prospects held out to the chiefs and tribes\r\nof the New York Indians, a little more than ten years ago, when they\r\nconsented to resign the home of their fathers, and began to remove into\r\nthe territories of the North-West. They had already began to plant\r\ntheir villages and raise their cabins on the beautiful banks of the\r\nFox River;--they had formed interesting and friendly alliances with\r\nthe wilder and untutored tribes of their newly adopted country;--all\r\nwere agreed and resolved to cultivate the arts and manners of\r\ncivilization;--their confidence of future repose and exemption from\r\nthe incursions of white men was unbroken;--and all their prospects\r\nwere bright, as the sun which made their corn to grow, and refreshing\r\nas the showers which softened the rich soil, in which it was planted.\r\nThe aged chief, smiling out of his care-worn and anxious countenance,\r\nblessed his tribe for their goodly inheritance, and touched the harp of\r\njoyous prophecy over the hopeful future, and dying, said--“Now is my\r\nsoul satisfied.” The father told his children--“Now we have a home--we\r\nshall not again be driven away.” The mother smiled more sweetly on her\r\ninfant--and the stripling in sympathy caught the feeling of general\r\nsatisfaction, and went more joyously to his sports.\r\n\r\n_But_--where is the faith, that can bind the selfishness, or restrain\r\nthe reckless and unprincipled enterprise of man? A Government may give\r\ntheir pledges in all honesty, and their own citizens may undermine the\r\nsacred foundations, and violently dissolve the ties--or another king\r\nmay arise in the land, that shall have forgotten Joseph.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for any, who know not how by actual observation, to\r\nappreciate the rapidity, with which the western territories of the\r\nUnited States have been entered and possessed by emigrants from the\r\nEast. It is not twenty years, since the great value and importance of\r\nthe peninsula of Michigan, lying between the sea of the same name on\r\nthe west and Huron on the east, was generally unknown. And if we have\r\nbeen rightfully informed, a Committee of Congress, in less than that\r\ntime since, having been appointed for the express purpose of inquiring\r\ninto the value of that territory, and taking their evidence on common\r\nrumour, reported, that it was not worth giving away;--and that it\r\nwould be an imposition and a cruelty, to bestow upon the disbanded\r\nsoldiers of the army, as was proposed, a bounty of lands in such a\r\nworthless tract. And yet at this moment, that very peninsula is crowded\r\nwith a population sufficient to claim admission, as a separate and\r\nindependent member of the Federal Union;--and is destined doubtless\r\nsoon to make one of the most flourishing of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe _North-West Territory_, consecrated, as already recognised, to be\r\nthe home of the Indian, the sanctuary of his rights, and the place of\r\nexperiment for Indian society and Indian empire, is but one step beyond\r\nthe territory of Michigan. And that same spirit of enterprise, which\r\nfound out the latter to be a desirable country, has also discovered the\r\nformer to be such.\r\n\r\nAs I cannot imagine, that those, who have taken the lead, in disturbing\r\nthe condition and blighting the prospect of the Indians at Green\r\nBay, could be ignorant of the understanding that existed, or of the\r\narrangements, that had been made, with the general Government--I shall\r\ntake the liberty of supposing, that their reasonings and purposes were\r\nsubstantially as follows:--\r\n\r\n“What right had the President of the United States to award this\r\ncountry to the Indians--and thus shut up the door to this desirable and\r\nbeautiful region against the enterprise of our citizens? Is this wide\r\nand rich territory, which in twenty years might make one of the first\r\nof these Confederate Republics, to be doomed to the possession of\r\nthose indolent savages, who will never use it for the proper purposes\r\nof human society? There is no reason in it. God designed, that the\r\nearth should be cultivated, and that man should make the most of it;\r\nand those, who will not use it, as was intended by the Creator, must\r\ngive place to those, who have more virtue. And besides, there is no\r\ndifficulty in managing these Indians. They are a simple and credulous\r\npeople. We can sow dissensions among them. We can make the wild tribes\r\nquarrel with their adopted neighbours; and bring them all together\r\nbefore their great father--(as they call him)--the President--and make\r\nat least one party say: ‘We are dissatisfied. We wish the agreement\r\nto be broken up. We do not like our brothers from New York. And we\r\nwish our great father to send them back again.’ And moreover, there\r\nhave been some improprieties and informalities, committed in their\r\nengagements, which may be impeached, and render them null and void. We\r\ncan show, that the New York Indians have been guilty of overreaching,\r\nin their bargain with the natives, and have acquired more land, than\r\nthe value of the considerations rendered. The transactions will not\r\nbear investigation. We can use this, first, to awaken jealousy and\r\nirreconcileable feeling in the one party;--and next, to disturb and\r\ninvalidate the rights of the other. And having once reduced the\r\nquantity of land, claimed by the New York Indians to a small patch,\r\nsuch as they had before they removed, by threatening them with the\r\nloss of the whole;--and having brought our own settlements around them\r\nand hemmed them in--they will be reduced to their former necessity of\r\nremoving again for existence. And as for these wild tribes, there will\r\nbe no difficulty in getting rid of them. We can at any time persuade\r\nthem for a trifle to sign a _quit claim_ to their territories.”\r\n\r\nI have here summed up, in a few words, what I suppose to have been\r\nthe _substance_ of the reasons, which have operated to blast the\r\nprospects of the associated Indian tribes of the North-West Territory,\r\nwithin the last ten years; and which have opened and destined that\r\nregion of country shortly to make _another_ of the Independent States\r\nof the American Union. I do not pretend to say, that any number of\r\nparticular individuals can be named who have all the responsibility\r\nof this procedure. Who can find the conscience, that shall be held\r\nanswerable for a deed, which has been done by so many hands? And yet\r\nit has been done--and the responsibility must attach somewhere; and\r\nthere are many conspicuous individuals, who have had a large share in\r\nit. Heaven forefend, that the whole community of the United States\r\nshould be held answerable for this! The entire plan, comprehended in\r\nthe supposititious argument of the last paragraph, has been actually\r\nexecuted;--that is, so far as time and circumstance would allow. And\r\nthe rest may easily be anticipated. The New York Indians and the\r\nnative tribes have been brought to quarrel with each other, through\r\nthe influence of persons interested in the removal of both;--their\r\ncovenants have been impeached, and set aside, as unworthy of respect;\r\nthe pending controversy has been embarrassed in every possible\r\nform;--it has gone up to the city of Washington, again and again, and\r\nreceived judgments from _ex parte_ testimony;--advantage has been\r\ntaken of the ignorance of one president in respect of the doings of\r\nhis predecessor, and false informations carried to his ear and made to\r\ninfluence his decisions;--Commissions of investigation, and clothed\r\nwith authority to institute new and final arrangements, have been sent\r\nupon the ground, which have disregarded and trampled upon the rights\r\nof the Indians,--and their reports and recommendations have been\r\nrespected. And now another president, and a new administration have\r\ncome to power, whose avowed policy is to remove _all_ the Indian tribes\r\nwest of the Mississippi; and who are using all possible endeavours\r\nto accomplish it. And it was under this administration, that the\r\nCommissioners from the general Government, on board the _Sheldon\r\nThomson_, in August 1830, as before mentioned, were on their way\r\nwith instructions to investigate and with authority to settle these\r\ncontroversies;--in other words--to get rid of the Indians, and to\r\nsatisfy those, who wanted their lands. I do not mean by this to impeach\r\nthe Commissioners _personally_, as having such a design. But such was\r\nthe nature of their instructions, that whatever they should do in\r\nobedience to them, must tend to that result. Indeed the whole matter\r\nhad been previously settled on the premises, by other Commissions,\r\nand got into such a condition and such shapes, and so much regard was\r\npaid to the final object--that the Commission of 1830 was rather a\r\nmere pretence and mockery, than any thing else. It was keeping up the\r\nshow of justice, while no justice was intended by those, who moved the\r\nwires behind the scenes. Indeed, it was then too late to do justice.\r\nThe purpose had already been resolved, and the wound inflicted for\r\na plural number of years; and it was now well understood, that the\r\nNorth-West Territory must become a separate and organized Government,\r\nand a candidate for admission into the Union. It is not, therefore,\r\non account of the importance and eventfulness of the doings of this\r\nCommission, in themselves considered, that I have chosen to notice\r\nthe scene of their labours;--but inasmuch as it presents a very fit\r\noccasion for a general developement of this species of injustice done\r\nto the American Aborigines, and is equally good for that purpose, as\r\nany other;--and inasmuch as it offers a rare exhibition of Indian\r\ncharacter, cultivated and uncultivated, and discloses their habits,\r\nmanners, sympathies, and hopes, in ways and under modifications,\r\nuncommonly lively and picturesque;--and more especially because I\r\nhappened to be an eye-witness of the events;--I have selected it, as\r\nworthy of minute and circumstantial detail.[10]\r\n\r\nI quote this article merely to show, that a plan like Dr. Morse’s had,\r\nat so early a period, entered into the views of the Government.\r\n\r\n“Should the expectation raised,” says the Doctor, “in regard to this\r\nproject be realized in a good degree, I should think this the place\r\n(the North-West Territory) for the ultimate establishment of the Indian\r\nCollege, which, in time, might be provided with Indian officers and\r\ninstructors, as well as students, and have their own trustees to manage\r\nits concerns. And if our brethren in Canada shall be disposed to unite\r\nwith us in this grand and desirable object, and make the institution\r\ncommon for the benefit of the Indians on both sides of the line, which\r\nseparates us, as one College might be sufficient for both--large funds,\r\nI am informed by a letter received while I am writing this article,\r\nexist in England, designed expressly for an object of this kind.[12]\r\n\r\n“Should it be thought expedient, and be found practicable, to collect\r\nthe remnants of tribes now scattered and languishing and wasting away\r\namong our white population, and to colonize them for the purpose\r\nof preserving them from extinction, and of educating them to the\r\nbest advantage, and with the greater economy--some portions of this\r\nterritory (the North-West) will, I think, unquestionably be found\r\nbetter suited to these objects, than any other in our country--_and as\r\nsuch I deliberately recommend them to the attention of Government_.”\r\n\r\n“This,” says Mr. Sargeant, a missionary among those Indians, “was a\r\nplan of Dr. Morse’s.--(Their removal from the State of New York to\r\nthe North-West Territory.) We understand the general Government are\r\npleased, and have confirmed the title. Means will now be used to obtain\r\na law of Congress to exclude _spirituous liquors and white heathen_\r\nfrom Green Bay.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\nTHE DESIGN OF THE COMMISSION OF 1830 TO GREEN BAY, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Green Bay is to constitute an important scene of our observations,\r\nit may be proper to remark, that the name designates the settlement\r\nat the mouth of Fox River, at the head of the large bay, bearing\r\nthis name, and connected with Lake Michigan. It is also generally\r\nunderstood, as comprehending an indefinite amount of territory in\r\nthat region. It constitutes the port, or opening from the east to the\r\nnorth-west in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe two great sections of territory falling under the jurisdiction\r\nof the United States, known by the names of _Michigan_ and the\r\n_North-West_, and which for many years have been comprehended under one\r\nTerritorial Government, of which Detroit is the seat, have gradually\r\nassumed no inconsiderable political importance, actual and prospective,\r\nin the American Union; and since it has been foreseen and resolved,\r\nthat each of them will make a conspicuous and important member of the\r\nGeneral Union, they have respectively claimed and realized their share\r\nof influence at the City of Washington. In the management of those\r\nterritories, it has been a matter of necessity, in the first place,\r\nthat the Government should act upon the representations of their\r\ncommissioned agents in that quarter;--and next, those agents have been\r\ncompelled to yield to the influence of the interested individuals,\r\nwho have been tempted to lay the foundations of their future wealth\r\nand importance in those distant regions. Notwithstanding, that\r\nPresident Monroe had pledged Green Bay, as the home and sanctuary of\r\nthe Indians, which was not only the key of the North-West Territory,\r\nbut comprehended all its importance;--yet it was well known, that an\r\nAct of Congress was necessary to secure that object. In the meantime\r\nthe Government has gone into other hands, and become wiser--at least\r\nhas blindly acted in obedience to the suggestions of the interest of\r\nindividuals. Men from the North-West have instructed the Government\r\nhow to instruct their agents, in the management of these Indian\r\naffairs. It was hardly possible that men, sitting in their offices\r\nat Washington, should understand the merits of these Indian claims;\r\nespecially if they did not take the trouble to look into the file of\r\npublic documents, which recorded and sealed them. As every government\r\nhas its numerous ramifications and distant props of dependency, they\r\nmight be more interested in gratifying citizens in that quarter,\r\nthan maintaining the rights of Indians, who are not citizens. And\r\nbesides, the Indians, simple and confiding in their nature, rested in\r\nconfidence on the public compacts, which had been executed in their\r\nfavour; while the citizens around them were alert and assiduous in\r\naccomplishing their objects. The Indians never imagined, that there\r\nwas any thing lame, or informal, or improper in the instruments, on\r\nwhich they relied, until they found themselves undermined by a train of\r\ninterested and political manœuvering. And by this time, it is vain to\r\nsue for the redemption of the pledge of President Monroe, who is not\r\nonly out of power, but out of the world;--and which, it is asserted,\r\nwas only the pledge of an individual, that he had no warrant to give.\r\nThe North-West Territory must be a _State_, and these Indians, who had\r\npossessed themselves, as they supposed, and as all concerned supposed\r\nat the time, in a regular and rightful course, of the key and heart of\r\nthe country, must be got out of the way.\r\n\r\nTo consummate this object, the previous steps of which had been before\r\narranged, the Commission of 1830 was sent to Green Bay. It is due,\r\nhowever, to the members of that Commission to say:--that their conduct\r\non the occasion sufficiently proved, that they had never understood\r\nthe real nature of the errand, before they entered upon it;--and that\r\nthey never manifested personally, or as a court, any willingness to\r\ndo injustice to the Indians. They found, indeed, on their arrival,\r\nthat they had got an unpleasant business upon their hands--a business\r\ninvolved, and complicated, and embarrassed, beyond the possibility of\r\ndisentanglement--and yet claiming their efforts to try to do something.\r\nThey were not only embarrassed by the case itself, even if they had\r\nbeen invested with a full and unlimited discretion; but they were\r\ngreatly embarrassed by their instructions, the forms and scope of\r\nwhich had evidently received their shape in accordance with the plan\r\nof an ultimate ejectment of the Indians. Nor is it to be inferred,\r\nthat the Government, _as such_, was privy to such a design. We do not\r\nbelieve it was so, in moral intent. We cannot think it capable. It was\r\nsufficiently apparent, that during the whole course of John Quincy\r\nAdams’s administration, the Government at Washington did not understand\r\nthe case. But things in relation to this affair, were permitted to go\r\non, as recommended by the government agents in that quarter. And it was\r\nhardly possible to do otherwise, so long as the Indians did not know\r\nhow to manage their own case, and were incapable of prosecuting it, so\r\nas to thwart the purposes of their adversaries; or else were uninformed\r\nof what was doing. Neither is it to be supposed, that the present\r\nadministration, notwithstanding their general policy is unfavourable\r\nto Indian rights, understood the merits of this question. It was too\r\ncomplicated, and too far beyond the field of their observation, to\r\nmake it possible. They had other, and to them more important concerns,\r\nto occupy them. The instructions had evidently been dictated and\r\ndrawn up by a hand, which had previously had something to do with the\r\nmatter; and which was capable and disposed to give them a shape to\r\nsuit the purposes of those who are opposed to the Indians’ claims.\r\nNor was there any thing on the face of the instructions, calculated\r\nto startle the moral sense of those unacquainted with the history of\r\nthe previous transactions. They even had the appearance of kindness,\r\nand of impartiality. The Government of the United States, therefore,\r\nmay and ought to be acquitted of knowingly consenting to this injury,\r\neven down to the time of the Commission of 1830. That they have not\r\nhad _opportunity_ since that time to know, can hardly be said--as\r\nwill appear in the sequel. We do not say, they were released from all\r\nresponsibility. That could not be. But it cannot be supposed, that they\r\nwould ever consent to such flagrant injustice, with their eyes upon it.\r\nSuch things are never done openly. It is easy to conceive, and there\r\nis no doubt, that the faith pledged by President Monroe to the New\r\nYork Indians, when they agreed to remove to Green Bay, was carefully\r\nkept out of sight, in the correspondence between the subsequent\r\nadministrations and their agents in the North-West; and that the public\r\ndocuments, attesting it, were suffered to lie undisturbed upon the\r\nfiles, to which they had been consigned.\r\n\r\nThe history of the whole affair is briefly this:--\r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of President Monroe and the Governor of Michigan\r\nin the years 1821-22, the chiefs of the New York tribes entered\r\ninto friendly alliances with the tribes of the North-West, and made\r\npurchases of territory, as agreed upon and defined by themselves in\r\nmutual council, for certain valuable considerations, specified in the\r\narticles of covenant, and in due time discharged. The real value and\r\nthe propriety of the considerations promised and rendered to bind\r\nthe sale and secure the purchase, cannot be estimated by the rules,\r\nwhich govern a similar contract among the whites;--inasmuch as the\r\nwhites have one object and the Indians another in the use of land. The\r\nvalue of land in the market of the whites is graduated by the probable\r\nproceeds of its future occupation and culture, in their own way of\r\nmanaging it. The same rule, applied to the habits of Indians, would\r\nof course reduce the value, as represented by money, indefinitely and\r\nvery greatly. Indians make little money, and need little; and as it\r\nwas never expected, nor designed by the parties, that this land should\r\ncome into the market of the white man, the only fair rule of estimating\r\nit in this contract, was its value among Indians. According to this\r\nrule, there is nothing to show, that the New York Indians have not paid\r\nthe full value of the lands, which they claim to have purchased. They\r\nsatisfied the second party in the stipulation. It was all they asked;\r\nand it was doubtless as much as it was worth, under the prospects,\r\nand according to the policy of the contracting parties. Since the\r\nterritory has been _seized_ by the whites, and acquired the accidental\r\nvalue, present and prospective, which all such property has in their\r\nhands--the price stipulated and rendered by the New York Indians has\r\nbeen adduced by their adversaries to invalidate the purchase, and prove\r\nit a fraud;--than which nothing could be more unfair.\r\n\r\nBesides--as it was an avowed policy of the newly associated tribes to\r\nkeep away the white man;--as the letters of Government had specifically\r\nrecommended, that the contemplated negotiations should have this\r\nobject in view;--and as the New York Indians were better acquainted\r\nwith the ways of white men, by having lived among them;--it was judged\r\nexpedient, that their deeds of purchase should include a much larger\r\nterritory, than what they wanted for themselves, or pretended to pay\r\nfor;--and that they should hold this additional quantity of land, not\r\nas their own, but in _trust_ for common occupancy and use, and to\r\ndefend it from the whites. The wild tribes were liable to be imposed\r\nupon. The New York Indians, having had a long school of experience, and\r\nhaving become civilized, were more wary and competent. Nothing could\r\nhave been wiser than this arrangement. Those, who know any thing of\r\nIndian character, know also, that the New York Indians were utterly\r\nincapable of the dishonesty, which has been attributed to them in this\r\naffair. Their faith was as sound and as pure, as the faith of angels.\r\nYet has this very measure, adopted at the suggestion of Government\r\nauthority, been employed to dissolve their covenants, and annihilate\r\ntheir rights. Not only has it been employed, as a presumption of\r\ndishonesty before the world, but, in conjunction with all other\r\npossible and false occasions, it has been assiduously applied to awaken\r\njealousy, dissatisfaction, and bitter animosity, in the bosoms of\r\nthose tribes, who had wisely agreed to this expedient. ‘The New York\r\nIndians have got your lands, and they’ll drive you away’--it was said\r\nto them: ‘Demand a restoration, and we’ll give you a fair price for\r\nwhat we want, and which is of little value to you--and you will still\r\nhave enough left for all your purposes of hunting and fishing. We are\r\nyour friends. The New York Indians are your enemies.’ And they were\r\npersuaded; and the sequel is in a rapid progress of fulfilment. The\r\nwild tribes of the North-West Territory will soon be thrown beyond the\r\nMississippi--and what will become of them there, remains to be proved.\r\nThe New York Indians, who had but just resigned their homes in the east\r\nfor a secure abode in the west, already reduced to a little patch of\r\nterritory, will soon be entirely surrounded and hemmed in, and vexed\r\nand annoyed, as they were before they removed. And what will they do\r\nthen? Prophecy itself cannot divine--except, that their prospects are\r\nby no means enviable.\r\n\r\nAnd why, it is asked, does not Government prevent this? I have already\r\nsupposed, what I believe to be the fact: that Government has never yet\r\nseen it in its true light. All governments of weighty cares are slow\r\nto discern and redress the thousand petty, yet grievous oppressions,\r\nthat are done within their jurisdictions. The poor and simple cannot\r\nfind ways and means for a hearing; and they are always anticipated\r\nby their oppressors--so that when their cause is admitted, there is\r\nlittle chance of redress. And has this matter never gone to the ear\r\nof Government? It has been attempted; and I have already intimated,\r\nhow uniformly the aggrieved have been foiled. Besides, a new and\r\ngeneral plan of removing all the Indians farther west, is in the way.\r\nIt is impossible in the present order of things--and probably in any\r\nsupposable order--that this injustice should be arrested. There may\r\npossibly come in enactments of indemnification;--but the question is\r\ndecided--that the Indians can never inherit the North-West Territory.\r\nIt is too late. It is decreed to rise and stand an independent member\r\nof the Federal Union.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nBURNING OF DEERFIELD IN MASSACHUSETTS, AND MASSACRE OF ITS INHABITANTS,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The history of the world,” said one, “is a history of crime and\r\ncalamity.” And if we may put a commentary on this, it doubtless means,\r\nthat its most notable features are of this description. The peaceful\r\nand even tenor of a particular community, or of the grand community of\r\nnations, makes brief chapters of history;--and for this reason:--that\r\nthe interest of the record is in the inverse proportion to the\r\ncomfort, which the facts narrated have brought to mankind. However\r\nlibellous the charge, the human mind loves excitement, and delights\r\nmore in the review of deeds of blood and of the disasters occasioned\r\nby the conflict of the physical elements of the universe, than of the\r\nachievements of benevolence and the security and happiness of society.\r\nThe detail of the actual misery, inflicted by the strifes of nations,\r\nis always private; and imposes itself upon public observation, only by\r\nthe swelling of its frightful aggregate. The most remarkable incidents\r\nof private life, and the most affecting features of private calamity,\r\nare almost entirely excluded from the notice of the general historian,\r\nby the very design and necessities of his task. These make the wide\r\nand various field, and constitute the exhaustless materials of the\r\ndramatist, the tragedian, and the writer of romance. This is, indeed,\r\nthe grand monopoly of this class of writers--the province of authentic\r\nbiography excepted.\r\n\r\nIn the old French war, as it is called in America, (for every country\r\nhas its own annals, the common allusions of which are best understood\r\nat home) the town of Deerfield in Massachusetts, which was then a\r\nfrontier settlement, became a prey to Indian pillage and massacre. It\r\nis understood, that this event happened in the early history of what\r\nwere then called the British colonies of North America. The awful\r\nnight, when the Indian war-whoop broke the repose of the peaceful\r\ninhabitants of that village, consigned its humble tenements to the\r\nblaze of the firebrand, and its fathers and mothers, and brothers\r\nand sisters, and helpless infancy, to indiscriminate massacre, or to\r\npainful captivity, is still fresh in the recollections of traditionary\r\nnarrative, and stands recorded on the authentic pages of the early\r\nhistory of New England. The place itself is indeed at present one of\r\nthe most secure abodes, and one of the pleasantest and sweetest towns\r\nin the Vale of the Connecticut, the long line of the grateful territory\r\nof which, has been celebrated by a native poet, whose verse offers to\r\nmy recollection the following couplet:--\r\n\r\n    “No rays of sun on happier vallies shine,\r\n    Nor drinks the sea a lovelier wave than thine.”\r\n\r\nBut the burning and massacre of Deerfield will never be forgotten. An\r\nIndian assault, when victorious, and Indian vengeance, are terrible\r\nbeyond imagination to conceive. In war mercy is no attribute of\r\nthe Indian’s breast. One of the solemn and sacramental acts of his\r\nenlistment, is publicly to absolve himself from all clemency towards\r\nhis enemies; and the more merciless the inflictions of his cruelty on\r\nman, woman, and child, the greater his glory, and the more sure his\r\nreward. The implorings of helpless age, the cries of the tender female,\r\nthe beseechings of the mother, and the sudden terror of her wakened\r\ninfant, are music to his ear;--and all the scene, of his burning and\r\ncarnage, a provocation to his appetite for blood. The captive he leads\r\naway he doats upon, as the future and more public victim of his dire\r\nrevenge; and if perchance the tender object of his future sacrifice\r\nsinks under the fatigues of the way, he lifts his hatchet, and brings\r\nthe victim to the earth, and snatches and bears away the scalp, as his\r\ntrophy.\r\n\r\nAmong the families, which fell victims to the massacre of Deerfield,\r\nwas that of the Rev. Mr. Williams, the pious and exemplary pastor\r\nof the flock, consigned to his spiritual charge, in that frontier\r\nsettlement. His youngest child, an infant daughter, was snatched from\r\nthe cradle, and borne away a captive; and by accident falling in\r\ncharge of an Indian woman, the child became the favourite of her new\r\nprotectress--was cherished and brought up in the St. Regis Tribe, of\r\nLower Canada; and in process of time, was married to an Indian chief.\r\nAlthough no knowledge of her preservation and history could be obtained\r\nfor many years, she was at last discovered in a time of peace, and\r\npersuaded with her husband to visit the surviving family-connexions\r\nin Massachusetts. But being entirely Indian in all her feelings, her\r\nlanguage, and manners, she could never be persuaded to desert the\r\nhome and the tribe, to which she had become attached. She was even\r\ndiscontented and manifestly uneasy, under all the tender cares and\r\nanxious attentions, which were in vain exhausted upon her, to induce\r\nher to return, with her family, and take up her abode with the relics\r\nand descendants of her father’s house, and in the bosom of civilized\r\nsociety. Every possible motive and tempting offer were set before them;\r\nbut without success. She and her husband occasionally visited their\r\nfamily connexions in Massachusetts, and were themselves visited in\r\nturn; and the kindest reciprocities of feeling were exchanged in this\r\nway, from one generation to another. And it may be observed, that the\r\nIndian family, to which she was allied, took the name of _Williams_,\r\nand have borne it to this day;--as is often the case, when connexions\r\nof this sort have been formed. As is quite natural among barbarous\r\ntribes, the natives of America, when on friendly terms, are proud of\r\nEuropean alliances, and are not unwilling to make this change of name,\r\nin honour of the family, from which they have made the acquisitions of\r\na maternal head among themselves.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the succeeding generations of this Anglo-Indian family, (I\r\nam unable to specify, whether it was the fourth, fifth, or sixth) two\r\nbrothers, Eleazer and John, the former perhaps ten years old and the\r\nlatter eight, by persuasions used with their parents in Canada, were\r\nbrought to Long Meadow, Massachusetts, about fifty miles south of\r\nDeerfield, on Connecticut River, to be educated among the collateral\r\ndescendants of their remote ancestor, the Rev. Mr. Williams. The\r\ntranslation of these boys occurred about the year 1800--perhaps a\r\nlittle subsequent. Their father, an Indian chief of the tribe before\r\nnamed, came with them, and stayed long enough to induct his sons into\r\nsome acquaintance and custom with their new condition, and then left\r\nthem in charge of their solicitous and benevolent relations.\r\n\r\nIt was in the winter, while the earth was covered with a deep and heavy\r\nfleece of immaculate snow. The father and his boys were dressed in the\r\nIndian costume throughout, but richly ornamented, according to Indian\r\ntaste, and in a style befitting the rank and dignity of the family,\r\nas among the chiefs of the tribe. Their blanket was worked into the\r\nforms of a loose great coat with sleeves, and girded about the loins\r\nby a belt of beaded wampum, with a knife pendant in a scabbard. Their\r\nfeet were shod with moccasins, and their ancles and legs to the knees,\r\nbuttoned up by a species of scarlet gaiters;--the hair of their heads\r\ncarelessly stuck with feathers--and the whole person exhibiting a\r\nvery grotesque and attractive appearance. In the country retreat of\r\nLong-meadow, where an Indian had rarely shown himself for generations,\r\nand where every novelty is a town talk, this exhibition excited a\r\nwondrous and wondering attention. The whole congregation on Sunday,\r\ninstead of looking at the minister and hearing him, as was their duty,\r\ncould talk of nothing, and think of little, but the Indians. Their\r\neyes followed these strange-looking beings into the church, and into\r\ntheir seats, and scarcely turned away from them, till the services were\r\nclosed, and the lions had been withdrawn from public gaze. Except for\r\nthe conscientious scruples of their pious host, they might as well,\r\nor better, perhaps, have been kept at home. But although there was a\r\nmanifest distraction of the public mind, and although the Indians could\r\nnot understand a word of the services, yet there was no knowing what a\r\nblessing there might be in it. The path of duty is the path of safety;\r\nand to the praise of New England be it spoken, that in olden time, the\r\npublic conscience would have been greatly disturbed at any unnecessary\r\nneglect of public worship. Every man was the guardian of his neighbour\r\nin this particular, and held a conventional and vested right to call\r\nhim to account for delinquencies. Although it must be confessed, that\r\nthey have, in some places, and in some degree, fallen off from this\r\nexcellent custom of their forefathers. The author of these pages was\r\nfor years a school-fellow with these boys, and is well acquainted with\r\ntheir history; and because of the conspicuous part, which the eldest\r\nof them, Eleazer, is destined to occupy in our story, it is thought\r\nsuitable to insert some traces of his biography.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to remark, that every town in New England (called\r\n_town_ in the act of incorporation, of which a parish in _Old_ England\r\nis the proper type, whether in the _country_, or otherwise) is divided\r\ninto a number of small geographical districts, to perfect the economy\r\nof common education;--that the schools of these districts are supported\r\nby assessments on the real estate within their limits, according to\r\nthe valuations of the civil list;--that the children of the poor\r\nhave the same advantages, as those of their more wealthy neighbours,\r\nso far as the provisions of these schools are concerned; which are\r\nalways sufficient for the purposes of what is called a good _common_\r\neducation;--that is, instruction in the reading and grammar of the\r\nEnglish language, chirography, arithmetic, geography, history, and such\r\nother things, as are deemed important for the common business of life.\r\nAnd this is always the first stage of education, with the children of\r\nthe rich as of the poor. Those, who are able, and who choose to extend\r\nthe education of their children, having passed them through this common\r\ncourse--the privileges of which are always near their own doors--send\r\nthem abroad to _select_ schools, and to the university, if they are\r\ndestined for the learned professions, or the higher conditions of life.\r\n\r\nIt happened, that the author, in his school-boy days, fell into the\r\nsame _district_ with these Anglo-Indian lads, Eleazer Williams and\r\nhis brother John. On the first few days of their appearance in the\r\nschool-room, they were as much the objects of curiosity with the\r\nother children, as they and their father were with the congregation\r\nat church. From the wildness of their nature and habits, it was\r\nnecessary for the master to humour their eccentricities, until they\r\nmight gradually accommodate themselves to discipline; and but for the\r\nbenevolent object in view, and the good anticipated, it was no small\r\nsacrifice to endure the disorder, which their manners at first created.\r\nUnused to restraint, and amazed at the orderly scene around them, they\r\nwould suddenly jump up, and cry, _Umph!_ or some other characteristic\r\nand guttural exclamation, and then perhaps spring across the room, and\r\nmake a true Indian assault upon a child, on whom they had fixed their\r\neyes, to his no small affright and consternation;--or else dart out of\r\nthe house, and take to their heels in such a direction, as their whims\r\nmight incline them. Confinement they could ill endure at first; and so\r\nlong as they did nothing but create disorder, (and that they did very\r\neffectually) they were indulged--until by degrees, they became used to\r\ndiscipline, and began to learn. Their first attempts by imitation to\r\nenunciate the names of the letters of the Roman alphabet, were quite\r\namusing--so difficult was it for them to form their tongue and other\r\norgans to the proper shapes. If the children of the school laughed,\r\n(as there was some apology for doing) these boys would sometimes cast\r\na contemptuous roll of the eye over the little assembly, and then\r\nleaving an “_Umph!_” behind them, would dart out of the house, in\r\nresentment;--all which was patiently endured by the master. For he\r\nwas particularly instructed not to use compulsion. They ultimately\r\nbecame attentive and good boys, both in school and in the family, where\r\nthey were cherished;--the eldest, however, always manifesting more\r\ntractableness and docility of the two. They gradually dropped their\r\nIndian dress and manners, and adopted those of their new society. The\r\neldest, as he grew up, became a universal favourite, was extensively\r\nintroduced into the best society of New England;--was cherished by\r\nevery body, as a most promising youth;--and all began to predict that\r\nhe would ultimately be of great service to his own nation, and to\r\nthe Indian tribes. For this purpose, his love of his own people was\r\ncarefully cherished by all his patrons, who were very numerous, and\r\namong the best and most influential men of the country. No pains or\r\nexpense were spared to enlarge his mind, cultivate his best feelings,\r\nand fit him for a high destiny. And the gradual and rapid developements\r\nof his intellect and moral virtues, and the improvement of his manners,\r\nabundantly satisfied and rewarded the hopes and pains exhausted upon\r\nhim. In addition to all the rest, and as the highest finish of his\r\ncharacter, he was observed to embrace and cherish with great sincerity\r\nand earnestness, the radical and practical principles of Christian\r\npiety. He grew up a gentleman and a Christian.\r\n\r\nFor a time, during the last war between the United States and Great\r\nBritain, his original and benevolent patrons in New England, were\r\nsomewhat disappointed and grieved, in consequence of his having\r\nattached himself, by temptations held out to him, to the staff of the\r\nAmerican army in the north. In consideration of his known abilities\r\nand of his connexion with the Indian tribes in Canada, which were the\r\nauxiliaries and more or less employed in the British army, his services\r\nwere deemed important, by the Americans, to counteract the hostile\r\ninfluence of these tribes on the northern frontier. In the battle of\r\nPlattsburg, himself and his brother John sustained conspicuous and\r\nuseful parts--although the engagement did not amount to much besides\r\nskirmishing, in consequence of the decisive action on Lake Champlain,\r\nin the face of Plattsburg, which caused the sudden retreat of the\r\nBritish forces from before the town into Canada.\r\n\r\nPeace being concluded, and the natural excitements of a campaign\r\nsubsiding in his mind, Mr. Williams’s feelings settled down again into\r\ntheir former condition of repose and benevolent regard for the race,\r\nfrom which he sprung, and to which he was allied, not only by the ties\r\nof nature, but by a long cherished and ever wakeful regard for their\r\nhighest and best interests. He felt, that Providence had called him to\r\nconsecrate his energies, his influence, and superior advantages, to\r\ntheir welfare;--and he fondly indulged the hope, that he was destined\r\nto elevate their condition. It was not long before he was introduced\r\nand commended to Bishop Hobart, of New York, and received orders in the\r\nChristian ministry from under his hand, to be employed in that capacity\r\namong the Indian tribes. He commenced his labours in 1815, with the\r\n_Oneidas_, at Oneida Castle, near Utica, in the State of New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nREV. MR. WILLIAMS AT GREEN BAY; IMPORTANCE OF HIS RELATIONS THERE, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened, that the Rev. Mr. Williams, the subject of the foregoing\r\nChapter, was at the head of all the movements of the New York Indians,\r\nwhich induced them to emigrate, and finally planted them in the\r\nNorth-West Territory. Being himself a chief, and more accustomed to the\r\nworld than his brethren, and well qualified for business, he always\r\ntook the lead in all the negotiations with the general Government.\r\nLike Moses of old, he was captain of the tribes, religiously and\r\npolitically. Like Joshua, he went into the promised land with his own\r\npeople, and settled them there; and stationed himself in the midst of\r\nthem, still their pastor and leader. He had succeeded in introducing\r\ninto the North-West Territory, and settling on the banks and near the\r\nmouth of Fox River, two of the most cultivated and most important\r\nof the New York tribes:--the Oneidas and Stockbridges--with every\r\nprospect, if things had gone on well, of bringing all the rest after\r\nthem. Mr. Williams had indulged the pleasing hope of instituting, under\r\nthe protection and patronage, pledged by the Government of the United\r\nStates, a new and bright era in the history of American Aborigines. His\r\npublic character and private worth had not only given him a well-earned\r\nand merited ascendancy among the Indians; but a high and commanding\r\ninfluence with the Government. He was widely known, well esteemed,\r\nand universally respected. And his appearance and manners, from\r\nchildhood accustomed to the world in all its various shapes, portly in\r\nperson, dignified in mien, condescending, courteous, and affable--and\r\nwithal developing equally the European and Indian character, in all\r\nthe expressions of his countenance, and in the exhibitions of his\r\ntemper--showed him at once a man made for respect and influence.\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Williams’s removal to Green Bay, he married a daughter\r\nof a Mr. Jordon of that settlement, himself a Frenchman, and his wife a\r\npure Indian, of the Menomenie tribe in that region. In this particular,\r\nviz. of having an equal share of European blood, Mr. Williams and his\r\nwife were alike. And in all the excellencies, which adorn the female\r\ncharacter, Mrs. Williams was not inferior to her husband, as a man.\r\n\r\nAlthough myself and Mr. Williams had been a long time separate, and\r\nhad not met more than once, and that only for a few moments, from 1806\r\nto 1830, we yet had all the reasons, characteristic of the romantic\r\nattachments of our earliest years, to cherish the kindest affections\r\ntowards each other. We had kept the traces of each other’s history in\r\nthe meantime, and each had rejoiced in the other’s welfare; and it was\r\nas great mutual pleasure, as it was unexpected, to meet once more on\r\nsuch interesting ground; and on an occasion so interesting, as that,\r\nwhich had brought me to Green Bay, in August 1830.\r\n\r\nThe next day after our arrival at Green Bay, I found myself in an\r\nIndian canoe, for the first time in my life, paddled by two wild\r\nIndians, ascending the Fox River, in company with Mr. Williams to his\r\nresidence, eight miles above the settlement at the river’s mouth. This\r\nunwonted and novel condition, in such a bark (_literally_ a bark) and\r\nin such society, was associated with many interesting recollections.\r\nAnd as may be imagined, we talked over and lived again the scenes of\r\nchildhood. We talked and lived again the years we had spent apart.\r\nWe blessed and adored that Providence, which had kept and guided us\r\nthrough so many eventful scenes. We wondered at the concurrence of\r\nevents, which had thus thrown us together, and rather dreamt over it as\r\na vision, than realized it as sober fact.\r\n\r\nOur first snug adjustment, however, in the canoe, is worthy of a\r\npassing remark. He who has never stepped foot in this floating thing,\r\nmust take good heed, that he do not venture to _stand_ upon his\r\nfeet, and that he get himself, as soon as convenient, “squat like a\r\ntoad” (_alias_, like an Indian) in the bottom of the canoe;--else he\r\nwill find the light and fickle bark quickly rolling and pitching him\r\nhead-foremost into the watery element. Nothing is more deceptive and\r\ntreacherous, than an Indian canoe, to him who is unaccustomed to its\r\nwhims. It is scarcely possible for such a person to get seated in it\r\nwithout upsetting. And yet the Indian, who understands its temper, will\r\nso adjust himself and so work his muscular powers, as to anticipate\r\nand feel all its sudden and fitful movements, and defy its instinctive\r\nand mischievous attempts to dislodge him into the deep. He will\r\nstand, or walk, or sit, as suits himself;--or mount with either foot\r\non either rim;--and compel the vicious and wayward thing to a quick\r\nobedience of his will. It is itself as light as an airy nothing, and\r\nbounds over the tops of the waves, like the skipping steps of a fairy\r\nsprite, darting forward to gratify its own humour. My own awkward\r\nattempts to adjust myself in this whimsical thing, even after all the\r\nbenefit of advice, was the occasion of no little merriment to the two\r\nwild Menomenies, who were to be the paddlers, and to others of the\r\ntribe, who witnessed the embarkation. Even Mr. Williams, with all his\r\npoliteness, could not keep his gravity, but was forced to join heartily\r\nin the merry peal, which showered upon me from these simple children of\r\nnature. Side by side, however, and at last, Mr. Williams and myself sat\r\nin the bottom of the canoe, on a mat woven from the stock of wild rice,\r\nand began to ascend the Fox River, smooth and swift, as the Indians\r\ndipped their paddles, and awakened the instinctive life of their airy\r\nbark.\r\n\r\nOne of our paddlers was a man of forty, the other a youth of\r\neighteen--both painted, with little covering, except a blanket\r\ncarelessly pendant from the shoulder, or belted round the waist; and a\r\nfeather or two stuck in the hair, on the crown of the head. The elder\r\nhad his whiskey bottle, and the younger his rifle lying at his feet.\r\n\r\n“And here we are, Mr. Williams. How strange! What a scene is this!”--\r\n\r\n“Indeed, Sir, and did we dream of it, when we run around the brick\r\nschool-house in the street of Long Meadow, and played our boyish pranks\r\nin that never-to-be-forgotten and delightful retreat?”\r\n\r\n“And do you remember the dress you wore, when first your father brought\r\nyou from Canada--and what infinite sport you and your brother John made\r\nfor the children of the school, by the strangeness of your manners, and\r\nyour Indian whims, before you had learned to accommodate yourselves to\r\nsuch a state of discipline?”\r\n\r\n“My memory,” said Mr. Williams, tapping his forehead with his finger,\r\nas much like a Frenchman, as an Indian, and winking a smile of great\r\nsignificance--“my memory records those scenes, as if they were the\r\nrecurrence of yesterday; and I remember, too, that we did not take\r\nyour ridicule in very good part. And do you not think that you, little\r\nfellows, were rather impolite?--And did we not give you a rap, or two,\r\nfor such disrespect?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, you made yourselves quite the terror of the school, for a\r\nlittle. For nothing, you know, is more frightful in story, to a white\r\nman’s child, than the thought of an Indian. He would run from an Indian\r\nbefore he were hatched.”\r\n\r\n“And what have you heard lately of my good and venerable father Ely’s\r\nfamily? Blessed be their memory! And what do I not owe them! Some are\r\nin heaven; and where are the rest? And all my old friends and patrons\r\nin New England--I cannot name them, they are so many?”\r\n\r\n“The Elys, all, as you may well believe, who are not saints in heaven,\r\nare on their way.”\r\n\r\n“I should be base, indeed--I could never respect myself, to forget even\r\nfor a day the family, who took and cherished my childhood;--and to\r\nwhom, under God, I owe all that I am more than my brethren of the St.\r\nRegis Tribe, in Lower Canada.”\r\n\r\nAnd much and various talk of early and later days, of trifling and more\r\nimportant events, occupied the hour or two, while the canoe was made\r\nto stem the current, and bore us along between the wild and romantic\r\nshores of Fox River, towards the humble and solitary log-cabin of the\r\nRev. Mr. Williams, perched upon the right bank, ascending; and skirted\r\nby what is called an _oak-opening_, or more properly, an _orchard_ of\r\noaks, scattered here and there, near enough for a shady grove, but too\r\ndistant to make a forest proper. The beauty of Fox River and of its\r\nwooded banks, is hardly to be exceeded by any thing of the kind. Every\r\nthing is soft and picturesque to the full satisfaction of the soul. The\r\nmind, in contemplating the shifting scene, drinks in pleasure, as if\r\nfrom the current of the river of life.\r\n\r\nA little incident in this excursion is perhaps worthy of notice. As the\r\ncanoe was gliding smoothly along near the shore, a sudden agitation\r\nof the bark summoned my attention to the young man forward, who had\r\ndropped his paddle, and grasped and fired his rifle at an object in\r\nthe high grass, under the bank, but invisible to any eye, but that\r\nof an Indian;--and all so quick, that one could hardly say, it had\r\noccupied time. The rifle was discharged, before I could even look up;\r\nand the Indian’s fiery glance, and cry of--“Umph!” followed a deer, as\r\nhe leaped up the bank, and bounded into the wood. The rifle, as I have\r\ncalled it by mistake, was a shot-gun;--and having been loaded only for\r\nwater-fowl, could effect no more, than to pepper the poor animal, and\r\nmake him feel uncomfortable; and perhaps extinguish the light of an\r\neye. The young man seemed greatly vexed to have lost his game.\r\n\r\nAfter being made acquainted with Mrs. Williams, who set us\r\nrefreshments, a walk was proposed and taken, along the elevated brow of\r\na sort of amphitheatre, overlooking the river, and enclosing a spacious\r\nand rich plain, a little above the highest floods. It was indeed a\r\nbeautiful and commanding eminence--itself the margin of another plain,\r\nstretching backwards, under the sombre and apparently boundless orchard\r\nof oaks.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said Mr. Williams, “on this spot and along this line, I _had_\r\nfondly indulged the dream, would one day, not far distant, be founded\r\nand erected a literary and scientific seminary, for the education of\r\nIndian youth. Next to the removal and establishment of our eastern\r\ntribes, in these delightful abodes of the North-West, and along Fox\r\nRiver, and such a confirmation of our privileges, as to afford a\r\nsecurity for future exemption from the incursions of the white man, I\r\n_had_ conceived and fondly cherished the project of this institution.\r\nThis wide and beautiful country _was_ to be our inheritance,--in common\r\nwith the tribes, of whom we purchased, and with whom we had entered\r\ninto firm and friendly alliances, under the guidance and auspices\r\nof the President and Government of the United States. For the first\r\ntime in the history of our public injuries, and of the successive\r\nejectments of our tribes from the east to the west, in the progress of\r\ntwo centuries, and of the gradual wasting away of whole nations, as\r\nwell as the constant diminution of these small remnants, which still\r\nretain a name and existence--a fixed and permanent position was here\r\npledged to us, and seemed to be gained, without fear of disturbance.\r\nHere opened to our imagination and to our hope--and I might add to our\r\nsober judgment--a theatre for the regeneration of our race. Here, as\r\nyou see, we were naturally divided by the great waters from the States,\r\nand from all danger of collision with the whites; at the same time,\r\nthat the American Government had promised to spread over us the wings\r\nof its protection, to secure us from those fatal dissensions among\r\nourselves, which had formerly characterised our history, and to extend\r\nunto us its parental and fostering care. It had promised all convenient\r\naid to secure the civilization of the wilder tribes, to amalgamate our\r\nfeelings and our interests, and make us one; and ultimately to raise us\r\nto a dignity and importance, which might claim, either an independent\r\nand equal place in the Federal Union, or a separate Government in\r\nfriendly alliance with the nation, which had first depressed us, but\r\nafterwards atoned their fault by restoring our rights, and making us\r\nbetter than they found us. And you see, there is no dreaming in all\r\nthis. It was natural, it was suitable, it was feasible. There was no\r\nobstacle in the way, but the want of _faith_ in existing and solemn\r\ncovenants. Where is the nation on earth, whose remote ancestors, at\r\nsome former period, have not been even lower, than we now are? There is\r\nnothing wanting, but peace and public faith, the means of intellectual\r\nand moral culture, and the arts of civilization, brought perpetually to\r\nbear on any people, however degraded, to elevate them to the highest\r\nimaginable condition.\r\n\r\n“Here, on this spot, I _had_ designed to found an Institution, which\r\nmight ultimately grow into importance, and become the _great centre_\r\nof education for the Aboriginal Tribes of North America. All this land\r\nwhich you see, and more, comprehending some thousands of acres, _was_\r\nmine, ceded by the tribes, as the reward of my services, and vesting\r\nin my wife, in consideration of claims through her father’s family.\r\nI had expended the last penny of my earthly substance, and involved\r\nmyself in debt, by the personal sacrifices, indispensably incurred,\r\nin accomplishing the great object of our removal and settlement in\r\nthis territory. And it was deemed fair, not only for the claims of my\r\nwife, but for my own, that I should receive this indemnification. And\r\nby the increasing value of these lands, as the state of society among\r\nour tribes should advance, I _had_ hoped, not only to provide for my\r\nfamily; but still to be able to make other and continued sacrifices,\r\nfor the good of the race, to which I belong;--and more especially to\r\npush the project of this my favourite institution.\r\n\r\n“I am a Canadian by birth, you know;--and by the same right, if I\r\nchoose to assert it, a subject of the British Empire. Although I am\r\nsorry to say, that the British Government of the Canadas is even\r\nbehind that of the United States, in the proper, or at least, in the\r\n_formal_ acknowledgment of Indian rights. They have never acknowledged\r\ntheir original _territorial_ rights, nor their separate rights, as a\r\ndistinct community; and of course have had no controversy, in these\r\nparticulars;--as the growth and extension of population in the Canadas\r\nhave never yet brought the parties into serious collision. But in _two_\r\nthings the British are far more noble:--_First_, They never look with\r\ncontempt, nor even with disrespect, on the colour of a man’s skin,\r\nmerely because it is of a deeper shade than their own. This is almost\r\nthe _peculiar_ vice of the Americans; and I need not say, that it is\r\nunbecoming. Nay--I am almost provoked to add, what perhaps ill becomes\r\n_me_--that it is contemptible. And _next_,--The door is completely\r\nopen in the Canadas for the incorporation of the Indians in all the\r\nrights and immunities of citizenship;--whereas in the States they\r\nare proscribed by law--at least by custom, which amounts to the same\r\nthing. In the Canadas an Indian may rise to any office, and to any\r\ncivil dignity, according to his merit and his influence. And in the\r\nrecords of their parliaments may be found at least the name of _one_\r\nIndian, admitted to their deliberations, and to the supreme rights of\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\n“But I was going to say that, as we are here upon the borders of\r\nthe Canadas, and as these provinces comprehend many and important\r\nIndian tribes, within their jurisdiction, and myself being a Canadian\r\nby birth, I had not confined my views of Indian amelioration and\r\ncultivation to those tribes alone, that are to be found within the\r\ncircle and in the territories of the States; but I have all along had\r\nmy eye upon the Canadian tribes. I love my father’s house, and my\r\nfather’s nation; and I know the generosity of the British public--to\r\nwhom I have meditated a future appeal, in behalf of the interests of\r\nthis seminary, and of the tribes falling under the jurisdiction of\r\ntheir Colonial Government, in North America. I have had reasons to be\r\npersuaded, that they never would refuse their patronage;--that their\r\nsympathies of benevolence would kindle into a holy fervour, under the\r\nprospects of such a hopeful field of generous enterprise. And what,\r\nwith the patronage of the Government and people of the United States,\r\nand what, with the favour of the people of Great Britain, I have not\r\ndoubted--on condition of the maintenance of good faith, in regard to\r\nthe pledges we had received, and which induced us to leave our homes in\r\nNew York, and come to this region--I _could_ not doubt, that my project\r\nwas rational, and that my hopes were likely to be realized.\r\n\r\n“But--what of all those bright and cheering hopes now remains? It\r\nis already decided, as you know, or will have occasion to know, in\r\nthe progress of the labours of this Commission from Washington, who\r\nlanded here yesterday, in company with you--that this territory is now\r\na candidate for admission to the rank and privileges of one of the\r\nFederal States. Public offices of Government have already been planted\r\nat the mouth of the river, in the settlement of Green Bay, which we\r\nleft this morning, filled by men, who are anticipating the opportunity\r\nof wielding the destinies of this future commonwealth. Citizens from\r\nthe States are flocking in, occupying the posts of trade, speculating\r\nin the purchase of lands, and selling whiskey to the wild Indians, who\r\nfill this region;--and thus corrupting their morals and manners, and\r\nfast plunging them into deeper degradation, and to final ruin. Did\r\nyou not see those naked and drunken Winnebagoes, who left the door of\r\nmy cabin a few minutes ago, brandishing their knives in a quarrel,\r\nactually bleeding under the infliction of violence on each other,\r\nand obliged to roll one of their number, dead drunk, into the canoe,\r\nbefore they could proceed up the river? In the bottom of that canoe\r\nyou saw also a keg of whiskey, the occasion of this mischief; and it\r\nis that cause which is destined to be the ruin of these tribes. Those\r\nIndians came all the way from thirty miles up this river, to the white\r\nsettlement below, merely to purchase that whiskey;--for which, you may\r\nbe assured, they have paid dearly enough. For the shopkeepers here do\r\nnot trade with the Indians, but for an enormous, an exorbitant profit.\r\n\r\n“This very land along the banks, and on either side of this river,\r\ncomprehending the Falls, a few miles above, and which make an infinite\r\npower for machinery, down to the mouth of the river, and far around on\r\nboth sides of the head of the bay;--comprehending, in short, the key\r\nof the territory;--and which we ourselves had purchased of the native\r\ntribes in 1821-22--was formally purchased again of the same tribes,\r\nin 1827, by a commission from the General Government, in contempt of\r\nour title. We are aware, that it is pretended _not_ to be in contempt\r\nof us--that it was not intended to disregard, or disturb _our_\r\ncontract--but only to purchase the claim, which those tribes still held\r\nover this territory, in relation to the United States; But we cannot\r\nunderstand this. As our contract was made under the supervision of the\r\nPresident of the United States, and received the official sanction of\r\nhis own hand and seal;--and as the contract conveyed to us entire, and\r\nwithout reserve, for ever, all the right and title of those tribes in\r\nthe premises;--we cannot comprehend, either the reason, or propriety,\r\nthat the Government should negotiate with _them_ for the land, and\r\nnot with _us_;--unless the reason be simply this:--that they knew we\r\n_would_ not sell, and that it is resolved to impeach and disturb our\r\nclaim. And although there has been no official announcement of such\r\nintention, yet have we long time heard, and are constantly hearing from\r\nprivate and irresponsible sources, and sources which are not far from\r\nbeing intimate with the public authorities--that our purchases are\r\ninvalid. Indeed, it is on this ground alone, that all the noise and\r\ncontroversy have arisen. So long as our title were allowed to be good,\r\nthere could be no controversy. It is on this ground, that the native\r\ntribes have been made dissatisfied, and alienated from us;--and on this\r\nground, that the present Commission has been sent up to force us to a\r\ncompromise, and reduce us to limits, which will entirely defeat all\r\nour objects in removing to this territory. It is on this presumption,\r\nthat you see the public offices, and the active and flourishing white\r\nsettlement at the mouth of the river--none of which have a right to\r\nbe there, on the basis of the faith, which has been solemnly pledged\r\nto us. We are invaded--we are soon to be surrounded--and there is no\r\nhope for us. We have no longer any influence over the native tribes.\r\nThey have been turned against us; and they know not that they have been\r\nturned against themselves. The white citizens, at the mouth of the\r\nriver, are our enemies. They are employing every possible endeavour to\r\nthrow us into the narrowest limits, and finally to root us out.\r\n\r\n“And besides all this, there are white men here, who enjoy the credit\r\nof hunting up and purchasing the pretended land claims of the old\r\nFrench settlers, for trifling considerations; and rendering them\r\ncertain and valuable, by forcing them through the District Court of the\r\nUnited States, established here, in a manner and by means, which make\r\nus unhappy. And the very ground on which you now stand, is liable to be\r\ninvaded for my ejectment, by such a process. It was dear to me once,\r\nbut I cannot now hold it to the value of a song.\r\n\r\n“And is there any hope, think you? The lamp of hope has long since\r\nexpired. We can never move again. We have no courage. Our tribes have\r\nno courage. For where is the faith, on which we can rely?\r\n\r\n“You shall see the state of things in the developements of the sittings\r\nof this Commission.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE STOCKBRIDGE SETTLEMENT ON FOX RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Williams’s, and in his company, I proceeded the next day up\r\nFox River, about ten miles farther, to the settlement occupied by the\r\nStockbridge tribe, last from the State of New York;--but originally\r\nfrom Stockbridge, Massachusetts, from which place they take their name.\r\nThis, of course, will be seen to be the second removal they have made,\r\nto be freed from the white men.\r\n\r\nHaving, for some reasons, found their situation uncomfortable in\r\nMassachusetts, or being otherwise tempted, the Stockbridge tribe had,\r\nat an early period, sold their original possessions, and removed to\r\nthe west, into a region, which is now the heart of the State of New\r\nYork;--but which, at that time, afforded them the same hopes of a\r\nretired seclusion, as those which they indulged, when, less than ten\r\nyears ago, they came to Green Bay. The place of their first retreat,\r\nwas in the neighbourhood of other tribes, where they hoped to enjoy, in\r\nperpetuity and without disturbance, their own rights and their peculiar\r\nways of living. But after a generation or two, they found themselves\r\nagain surrounded and invaded by the whites; and as before narrated, and\r\nfor similar reasons, they removed again to the banks of the Fox River,\r\nin the North-West Territory.\r\n\r\nAs the most convenient way of developing the present condition and\r\ncharacter of this tribe, I will here introduce a passage from my\r\nmemoranda;--observing, that the term _Kawkawlin_, the name of the\r\nplace, from which the date was made, means _Falls_, or rapids; and\r\nthat the French epithet attached to it, which needs no explanation,\r\nis employed to express the comparative importance of these _Falls_,\r\nover another smaller rapid a few miles below;--both of which, by the\r\napplication of special forces, may be ascended with the bateaux, used\r\nin navigating these waters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Grande Kawkawlin, Aug. 16, 1830._\r\n\r\nI am now writing from the Mission-house of the American Board, on Fox\r\nRiver, twenty miles from its mouth, planted among the Stockbridge\r\nIndians--who have been encouraged to settle themselves here by the\r\nGeneral Government, after having been disappointed of their claims on\r\nWhite River, Indiana. They number about 350 souls, and have probably\r\nmade greater attainments in the English language and manners, and in\r\nthe useful arts of civilized life, and also in the Christian religion,\r\nthan any other tribe of the Aborigines on the continent;--except only,\r\nthat the Brotherton Indians have so long used English, as to have\r\nlost their mother tongue. The probable reason, that the Brothertons\r\nhave dropped the language of their tribe, is, that nearly all of them\r\nare highly charged with English blood. But in the moral state of\r\nsociety, and in general improvement, the Brothertons are far behind the\r\nStockbridges. The Brothertons have not enjoyed the same uninterrupted\r\nsuccession of teachers of the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nThe Stockbridge Indians have heard the preaching of Brainard and\r\nEdwards; and have enjoyed Christian privileges and cultivation, with\r\nlittle interruption, for nearly ninety years. I saw a Bible yesterday,\r\nsafely kept in a sort of ark, at their place of worship, (a remarkable\r\nrelic of Hebrew custom), printed at Oxford, England, in 1717, of the\r\nlargest and finest type I have ever seen; except one shown to me two\r\nyears ago in the English Church at Montreal, the last of which was said\r\nto be the largest and fairest type of a Bible ever done in English.\r\nFrom the resemblance of the two, I have reason to believe, they are\r\nboth of the same impression. The Bible here is in two volumes, the\r\nlargest folio, two feet by eighteen inches, both together weighing I\r\nshould judge forty to fifty pounds, with a superb frontispiece, and\r\nnumerous plates, equally elegant and splendid. On the external of each\r\nvolume is imprinted in large gilt capitals, with the ancient mode of\r\npunctuation, the following inscription:--\r\n\r\n  THE. GIFT. OF.\r\n\r\n  THE. REV. DR. FRANCIS. AYSCOUTH.\r\n\r\n  TO. THE.\r\n\r\n  INDIAN. CONGREGATION. AT. HOUSATONNAC.\r\n\r\n  IN. NEW. ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n  MDCCXLV.\r\n\r\nOn the first blank page is the following certificate, I suppose in the\r\nhand-writing of the person whose name is subscribed:--\r\n\r\n“This, with another volume, containing the Holy Bible, is the pious\r\ngift of the Rev. Dr. Francis Ayscouth (Clerk of the Closet to His Royal\r\nHighness, Frederick, Prince of Wales) to the use of the congregation of\r\nIndians, at or near Housatonnac, in the vast wilderness of New England,\r\nwho are at present under the voluntary care and instruction of the\r\nlearned and religious Mr. John Sergeant, and is to remain to the use\r\nof the successors of those Indians, from generation to generation,\r\nas a testimony of the said Doctor’s great regard for the salvation\r\nof their souls. And is over and above other benefits, which he most\r\ncheerfully obtained for the encouragement of the said Mr. Sergeant, and\r\nin favour of the said Indians, at the request of their hearty friend\r\nand well-wisher,\r\n\r\n  “THOMAS CORAN.”\r\n\r\n  “_London, the 31st of Dec. 1795._”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have conjectured, that the last date should be 1745, in order to\r\ncorrespond with the inscription on the outside. But perhaps the\r\nsolution may otherwise be obtained. I have not felt at liberty to\r\nrestore the correspondence, as the characters, though in manuscript,\r\nare quite distinct and legible.\r\n\r\n--“And is to remain to the use of those Indians _from generation to\r\ngeneration_, &c.” And here it is, as bright and as perfect, as when\r\nfirst it came from the hands of the pious donor;--and that not to\r\nprove, that it has not been used--for it has been constantly used\r\nin public worship. But it has been _carefully_ used, and carefully\r\nkept in the _ark of the covenant_! It came from _Old_ England to\r\nthe “Housatonnec, in the vast wilderness of _New_ England.” It was\r\ntransported with the tribe to the State of New York;--and for aught\r\nI know, with all the sacerdotal solemnities of their Hebrew fathers,\r\nin ancient days. And it was again transported by the same religious\r\ncare to _this_ vast wilderness, of the North-West. And here it is, a\r\nperpetual monument of their fear of God, and of their love of his word\r\nand ordinances. Their reverence for this volume and for the _ark_,\r\nwhich contains it, is almost superstitious. Nay, I had almost said--it\r\nis idolatrous. But that would be unjust. While the white Christians\r\n(_Christians?_? of Europe have fallen into the most egregious and\r\nstupid idolatry, these descendants of the ancient Hebrews, and all\r\ntheir brethren of the wildest tribes, in all their wanderings, have\r\nnever laid their hands upon an idol--have never worshipped an idol.\r\nThey have never worshipped the sun, nor the moon, nor the stars, nor\r\nany image of things in heaven, or earth. They have never worshipped\r\ngods _many_;--but One invisible, unchangeable, eternal Spirit! “The\r\n_Great_ Spirit!”--as they always call him. But where else is the people\r\nto be found, _not_ Christian, except among the scattered remnants of\r\nJudah and Benjamin, who have not worshipped idols?\r\n\r\nLet the pious descendants of the English race, both in Great Britain\r\nand America, be encouraged to imitate the _faith_ of the “Reverend\r\nDoctor Francis Ayscouth,”--and of “the learned and pious Mr. John\r\nSergeant.” For here, in the Stockbridge tribe, is their reward. “From\r\ngeneration to generation,” even under all the disadvantages of their\r\ncondition, these Indians have been growing better and better, ever\r\nsince they were first blessed by the prayers and labours of those\r\nvenerable men of God.\r\n\r\nYesterday was the Sabbath--and a good day it was. I had never expected\r\nto come into this wilderness, so called, and among these savages,\r\n_so esteemed_, to enjoy a Christian Sabbath, without witnessing a\r\nsingle impropriety, among a whole people of this description;--to see\r\nthe congregation, the parents with their children, “and the stranger\r\nwithin their gates,” going up to the house of God in company; seating\r\nthemselves with a reverence and decorum, that might shame many\r\ncommunities, calling themselves civilized, and professing Christianity;\r\nlistening with fixed and unrelaxed attention to all the public\r\nservices, many of them demonstrating a thorough religious abstraction\r\nand absorption; and when their hearts and conscience were appealed to,\r\nin the application of the subject of discourse, showing a depth and\r\nquickness of feeling, which agitated their bosoms, and forced a passage\r\nthrough the watery channels of the eye. And then to attend the Sabbath\r\nschool, reduced to all the order and discipline, which characterise the\r\nbest schools of this sort in the white settlements;--superintended,\r\nindeed, by the Missionaries, but employing the adult natives, as\r\ninstructors, who engaged in their work with a ready aptitude and\r\napparent satisfaction:--this, too, was a scene unexpected and grateful\r\nbeyond my power to express. And all was done in the English language,\r\nso pure, that if my eyes had been shut, and I could have forgotten\r\nwhere I was, my ears would have assured me, that I was listening to the\r\ncommon exercises of a Sabbath school among the whites.\r\n\r\nThe building consecrated and employed for these purposes, is made\r\nof unhewn logs, resting upon each other from the foundation to the\r\nroof, and dove-tailed at the angles; forming not only heavy and\r\nsubstantial walls, but strongly “compacted together.” The interstices\r\nare filled up with a species of clay, or mud, mingled with straw\r\nto secure its tenacity, and to exclude the wind and storm. This,\r\nit may be understood, is the ordinary mode of constructing houses\r\nin the new settlements, until the inhabitants are able to erect\r\nsaw-mills, and produce boards and other lumber, essential to more\r\ncomely edifices. I have been gratified to remark, that this Indian\r\nsettlement has all the conveniences, and is equally well done, as\r\nsettlements of the same age, and in similar circumstances, in the\r\nStates. This church, or meeting-house, is planted in the midst and\r\nunder the overhanging trees of a wood, because it happens to be the\r\ngeographical centre of the tribe;--and is also employed, as a common\r\nschool-house, on the week days. It will admit a congregation, closely\r\npacked, of 300, or more--quite sufficient for their purposes. It is\r\ndelightful to see them thus assembled, and for such a purpose, all\r\nneatly dressed in a costume, about half-way between the European\r\n_habit_ and that of the wild tribes; measuring not inaptly the degree\r\nof their civilization:--the women, for the most part, especially the\r\nmatrons, wearing the old fashioned English short gown and petticoat,\r\nwith scarlet gaiters, and buckskin moccasins, tastefully in-wrought\r\nwith beads, with the white man’s beaver hat, and some gaudy ribband\r\nfor a band, which often hangs pendant down the back, nearly to the\r\nground. Some of the younger females may be seen, dressed nearly to\r\nthe top of the English fashion--always exhibiting, however, some\r\nlaughable incongruities. The men seldom wear hats--and their dress\r\nalso is ordinarily _midway_ between the European and Indian modes. The\r\nflaps of their frock hang out to meet the trowsers, or high gaiters,\r\nwhich terminate half way from the knee to the hip bone, and which are\r\nsupported by strings attached to the upper garments. They are generally\r\nclosely girded by a sash of _wampum_ or beaded mantle, the ends of\r\nwhich are pendant, like the sash of a military officer. The children\r\nare set off in a show of slight variations from the appearances of\r\nadults. As among civilized people, the standing in society, the degrees\r\nof respectability and domestic wealth, are marked in dress, by varying\r\ndegrees of richness and taste. Some of the men, as well as women, are\r\ndressed in all respects after the European plainer modes.\r\n\r\nIn the second, or afternoon service of yesterday, the sermon of the\r\npreacher was interpreted, as is always the practice in one half of\r\nthe day, for the benefit of a small portion of the tribe, who do not\r\nunderstand English. This is a slow, and a somewhat tedious mode of\r\nintercommunication. The process is simply this: as the preacher did\r\nnot understand Indian, he delivered himself successively in short\r\nsentences, and waited at the end of each for the interpreter to present\r\nthe thoughts, in his own tongue, to the congregation. Or rather I might\r\nsay: the preacher rested where the current of thought more naturally\r\nallowed a pause.\r\n\r\nI had always understood, that the Indians are good singers. It is an\r\nexercise, for which they have great fondness. But the half had not\r\nbeen told me. They seem _all_ to be singers; and the mellowness and\r\nsweetness of their voices, together with the accuracy of their ear,\r\nand their horror of discord, ensure the sweetest harmonies in their\r\nchorus. This tribe have been so long practised in the art of sacred\r\nmusic, and their taste is so good in the selection of common tunes and\r\nanthems, that they are surprisingly familiar with the most extensive\r\nrange of Christian psalmody. I heard about thirty of them last evening,\r\nmale and female, sing an hour and a half without interruption, passing\r\nfrom one piece to another without repetition, except as requested;--all\r\ndone in good style of performance, (when we compare the ordinary choirs\r\nof church singers, one with another) and in pure English;--except\r\noccasionally, by particular desire expressed, they sung in their own\r\ntongue. They have many psalms and hymns translated into the same\r\nmetre, so that a part of the congregation in public worship, for whom\r\nit is more convenient, sing in their own language, simultaneously\r\nwith those, who sing in English;--and all without confusion. You may\r\nrecognise those, who sing in English, or Indian, by the movement of\r\ntheir lips. It seems impossible for Indians, when they sing in chorus,\r\nto avoid a simultaneous movement--which is never executed in churches\r\nof white people, where all the congregation unite;--and not always in\r\nchoirs, that have had the best opportunities of being trained. This\r\nunerring exactitude of movement must be owing, I think, to a natural\r\nsuperiority in the quickness and nicety of their musical perceptions.\r\nI was compelled to award these Indians the palm over the ordinary\r\nperformances of Christian psalmody, among the whites.\r\n\r\nI noticed yesterday two interesting features, appertaining to the order\r\nof their public worship:--one was the staff and office of the parish\r\nbeadle, introduced, no doubt, by Mr. John Sergeant, nearly a hundred\r\nyears ago. The staff, in the present instance, was a green switch,\r\nabout ten feet long, which the functionary had cut from the wood, as\r\nhe came to church;--and woe to the boy, that should play, or the man,\r\nor woman, that should sleep, under his watchful eye. The former was\r\nswitched over the ears with a briskness, which I should judge, from the\r\nsound of its whizzing, must have made them tingle and burn for the\r\nrest of the day. And when a man or woman was seen nodding, the big end\r\nof the switch was turned up, and made to thump violently against the\r\nstove-pipe over head, till it rang like a bell, accompanied with the\r\nstartling cry from the beadle, in Indian: “_Wake up, there!_”--all to\r\nthe no small annoyance of the preacher;--for it happened in the middle\r\nof his sermon. But the preacher gained at least the advantage of being\r\nheard by the sleeper, as may well be imagined, after such a summons.\r\nNow, although this may excite a smile among the whites, who in these\r\ntimes, have generally abandoned this good sort of discipline, yet it\r\nall passes off here by the power of custom, with the utmost gravity,\r\nand produces a very quickening and salutary effect. The prerogatives\r\nof this functionary, as I perceived, also extend to the keeping of\r\norder out of doors, during the interval of public worship, and while\r\nthe congregation are assembling and retiring; so that no boy, or youth,\r\ndares offend in his presence. And I am told there is no partiality\r\nshown by this officer, even to his father, or mother, or wife, or\r\nchildren; and that it is prudent even for the stranger, not to fall\r\nasleep. Certain it is: I discovered no disposition to levity among the\r\nyoungsters, either within or without the house. But all was decency\r\nand gravity, comporting with the solemnities of the day and the place.\r\n\r\nThe _other_ interesting feature which I noticed was: that when the\r\nbenediction was pronounced, the congregation all resumed their\r\nsittings, and waited for those nearest the door to retire gradually\r\nwithout crowding and bustle, the moral effect of which was very\r\npleasant. And this, too, not unlikely was a lesson taught them by Mr.\r\nJohn Sergeant, ninety years ago.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, a prayer-meeting was held at the mission-house; at\r\nwhich I had the pleasure of hearing two Indians pray in their native\r\ntongue, with a ready fluency, and with great apparent fervour and\r\nimportunity. There were about fifty present:--and all kneeled during\r\nthe prayers. At the request of the missionaries, I had addressed the\r\nIndians at their place of public worship in the day, on some of the\r\ncommon topics of religion. In the evening, I spoke to them again, and\r\ntold them of their own interests, as a people; especially to watch and\r\ndefend themselves and their people against the evils of intemperance.\r\nThey were very attentive; and to my no small surprise, when I had done,\r\none of the chiefs rose to reply to me, apologized for not speaking\r\nin English, and called upon an interpreter. It may be observed, that\r\nhe could speak English, as well as the man whom he selected and put\r\nforward for that purpose. But whenever Indians hold a public conference\r\nwith strangers, they seem to like a little of the pomp and circumstance\r\nof formality. And it does in fact give weight and importance to the\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nThe venerable chief thanked God, that I had come so far to visit them;\r\nand for all the good words I had spoken to them that day and evening.\r\nHe thanked all the well-wishers and benefactors of the Indians among\r\nthe white people. He reflected, with great feeling, upon the goodness\r\nof God, in having put it in the hearts of his own people far over the\r\ngreat and salt lake (the Atlantic) to send them a Bible, (alluding to\r\nthe Bible presented by Dr. Ayscouth) and a learned and good man (Mr.\r\nSergeant) to tell the Indians all that was in it, and teach their\r\nchildren how to read it;--and for turning the hearts of Christian white\r\npeople so long time to their spiritual welfare. The wickedness of\r\nman, he said, was very great, and they (the Indians) had abused their\r\nprivileges, and God had not taken them away. [Here I thought he might\r\nwell have indulged in reproaches for the injuries done them by white\r\nmen. But no--he was too noble--too grateful.] He said his heart was\r\n_penetrated_, (laying his hand upon his heart) when I spoke to them of\r\nthe evils and dangers of intemperance;--and declared, they were ready\r\nto do all in their power to keep their people from the use of ardent\r\nspirits;--and concluded in the usual manner of an Indian oration: “I\r\nhave no more to say”--and then approached and gave me his hand.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to recite his speech, but have merely indicated some\r\nof its leading thoughts. I found myself unexpectedly listening to an\r\neloquent _impromptu_ of an Indian chief, formally and most respectfully\r\naddressed to myself, in presence of an assembly of Indians;--an event\r\nI had never anticipated;--and with a manner and tone of voice, which\r\nspoke directly from the heart. All that I had heard in report, or\r\nimagined of Indian speeches and of their wild oratory, instantaneously\r\nrushed upon my mind; and I saw the living reality before me, not to\r\ndetract from, but only to confirm, the vividness of the romantic ideal.\r\nI have been constrained to feel, that the deference and respect,\r\nwhich the Indian pays to a guest, when put upon the interchange of\r\ngood feeling, is unrivalled. No art of civilized life and manners can\r\npretend to keep company with his politeness. The white man feels his\r\nlittleness, and bows in reverence of such moral greatness and dignity\r\nof character.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the Sabbath I have spent at the _Grande Kawkawlin_,\r\nis one I can never forget. While listening to the songs of\r\nZion, so sweetly attuned by these children of the forest, last\r\nevening, accompanied with the suggestions of the occasion, and its\r\ncircumstances, I found myself involuntarily and repeatedly exclaiming\r\nwithin:--Have I lived so long and enjoyed so many privileges, to come\r\nhere where it is supposed no such privileges are had, to enjoy a higher\r\nzest and nobler interchange of religious sympathy, than I can remember\r\nto have felt even in the most favoured gardens of Christian culture?\r\nMany times did I think, in the midst of the scenes brought before me\r\nyesterday: could the whole Christian world see and hear _this_, they\r\nwould forget all else they were doing, and run, and come bending over\r\nthese guileless children of the wilderness, like the angels of heaven,\r\nwho delight in errands of mercy, and never leave them, till they were\r\nall raised to that dignity and to those hopes of man, which the light\r\nand ordinances of Christianity are designed and calculated to confer.\r\nSuch a sight would open their hearts and all their treasures, and\r\nnothing methinks would be wanting to advance and consummate a design\r\nso benevolent and glorious. With what expressions of good feeling and\r\ngratitude do these Indians, old and young, male and female, crowd\r\nforward, without waiting for the forms of introduction, to shake hands\r\nwith a stranger, whom they believe to be kind towards them! What a\r\nrebuke to the reserved and distant etiquette of that, which is claimed\r\nto be a more refined condition! And never did a Christian people\r\ncherish their pastor with kinder affections, or kinder offices, than\r\nthese do their missionaries.\r\n\r\nAnd are these the people, who, as the white men say, can never be\r\ncultivated?--these the people to be driven from one place to another,\r\n“till they have no rest for the sole of their foot?”--till they are\r\ncompelled “in the morning to say--would God it were evening--and in the\r\nevening, would God it were morning?”--whom it is right to rob, a virtue\r\nto abuse, and pardonable to have annihilated?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE ONEIDA SETTLEMENT AT DUCK CREEK, UNDER THE CARE OF THE REV. MR.\r\nWILLIAMS, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Stockbridges had planted their tribe at the _Grande\r\nKawkawlin_, on the east bank of Fox River, and in the course of some\r\nhalf-dozen years, reared a flourishing settle settlement; built houses\r\nand barns in the usual style of the white settlements in similar\r\ncircumstances; cleared away portions of the forest, and reduced their\r\nfarms to an interesting state of improvement; organized and brought\r\ninto salutary operation a political and civil economy; established\r\nschools and the ordinances of Christianity; began to improve the\r\nwater-power opposite their village by the erection of mills and\r\nmachinery;--exhibiting, in a word, a most interesting _phasis_ of\r\ncivilization, along with the purest morals, under the simplest\r\nmanners;--their state of society being rather of the patriarchal\r\nform, and governed by hereditary chiefs, according to the immemorial\r\ncustom of Indian tribes;--contemporaneously with the establishment of\r\nthis settlement, the _Oneidas_, under the auspices of the Rev. Mr.\r\nWilliams and his associate chiefs, had planted themselves at _Duck\r\nCreek_, on the west of the river, eight miles from its mouth, and\r\ntwenty in a northerly direction from the Stockbridges. The Duck Creek\r\nsettlement is five miles in retreat from the line of Fox River, situate\r\non a small stream, from which it is named. The Oneida tribe, if my\r\nnotes are correct, is somewhat more numerous than the Stockbridge,\r\namounting perhaps to _seven_ or _eight_ hundred. The English language\r\nis not in common use among them, although it is being cultivated\r\nin their schools, along with their own. The Rev. Mr. Williams,\r\ntheir Christian pastor, preaches to them uniformly in their native\r\ntongue. Their improvements are equally interesting, and of the same\r\ngeneral character, with those of the Stockbridges. They have farms,\r\ndwelling-houses, school-houses, barns, and in 1830 were building a very\r\ndecent Christian Church, which is doubtless finished before this, and\r\nappropriated to its holy uses. The traveller, as he passes their former\r\nsettlement, in Oneida County, State of New York, discovers a little\r\ndistance from the main road on the south, a beautiful white church,\r\nwith its spire pointing to the heavens. It was built by these Oneidas,\r\nand there they worshipped the white man’s God, and adored the white\r\nman’s Saviour, before they were compelled to leave it behind them, and\r\nbuild another in this distant region.\r\n\r\nMr. Williams’s house, as before noticed, stands alone, on the margin\r\nof Fox River, in the midst of the lands, the title of which would have\r\nvested in his wife, but for the unrighteous suits at law, which are\r\nlikely to eject him, and leave him destitute;--lands, which would not\r\nonly provide well for his family, if suffered to be retained by him,\r\nbut a portion of them was marked out and consecrated in his purpose,\r\nas the site of a future and most important literary and scientific\r\nInstitution, for the education of Indian youth. And when we reflect\r\nupon the nobleness of this purpose, its enlarged scope, and the\r\napparent feasibility of the plan, with the prospects under which it\r\nwas conceived; when we regard the character of the man, who formed the\r\ndesign, and his means of influence to carry it into execution, had the\r\nterritory remained undisturbed; when we think, that he is probably the\r\nonly man of the age, who could lead in such an enterprise, with promise\r\nof its ultimate and full consummation; and that with the blasting\r\nof his hopes, and the breaking down of his courage, are likely to\r\ncome the blighting of _all_ hope and the prostration of all courage\r\namong those tribes, for their future elevation and importance;--we\r\ncannot look upon the untoward events, which have befallen the New York\r\nIndians, since their removal to that quarter, but with feelings of deep\r\nand unutterable regret. The historian of the rise and fall of empires\r\nordinarily points out to us the nice and critical events, on which\r\nwas suspended their weal, or woe. And I am almost enough inclined to\r\ntake up the burden and lamentations of a prophet, over the events now\r\nunder consideration, and say:--I know not how the Indian tribes of\r\nthat region can rise above this wreck of their hopes. There is a way,\r\nindeed, hereafter to be considered, which leaves a glimmering of hope\r\nbehind--but involving at the same time numerous contingencies of deep\r\nanxiety;--a way, which must necessarily transfer the theatre, and defer\r\nthe consummation of the object. Here, in the North-West Territory,\r\nthe door is for ever closed. These once hopeful instruments, and this\r\nindividual man, will have laboured in vain--except, as the disclosure\r\nand ascertainment of their injuries shall awaken a repentance and a\r\nsympathy in the bosom of that community, which ought, long ago, to have\r\nthrown in the shield of its protection, and saved the Indians from\r\nthese disasters. And even then, such a man, as Mr. Williams, cannot be\r\nraised from the grave. Or, if he should be among the living, (which\r\nis not very probable) a state of health worn out, and a constitution\r\nbroken down, by these cares;--a mind, originally vigorous and\r\nheroic, but the courage of which has been well nigh subdued by this\r\nirresistible accumulation of calamity over the heads of his race--would\r\nrequire little less than a miracle to fit him to cherish again the\r\nhopes, and again to wield the burden of such an enterprise, as he must\r\nhave the credit of having once conceived. May a Phœnix yet arise from\r\nthe ashes of his hopes consumed, and wing its way to a brighter destiny.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the information of the reader, it is suitable to acquaint him yet\r\nfarther with the relations of the New York Indians to their wilder\r\nbrethren of the North-West, in consequence of their purchase and\r\nremoval--and also with the unexpected encroachments they suffered from\r\nthe whites--before we enter upon the doings of the Commissioners.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are several nations (as the Indian tribes are often\r\ncalled) in the North-West, yet as _two_ only occupied and claimed\r\nthe territory, where the New York Indians chose to settle, their\r\nnegotiations were principally confined to those tribes--viz. the\r\n_Menomenies_ and _Winnebagoes_. It was of these nations they\r\npurchased, and with them, that they entered into friendly alliances\r\nand solemn covenants, under the auspices of Government in 1821-22.\r\nThey had succeeded in cultivating friendship, and in persuading\r\nthe native tribes to abandon their wild habits, and adopt the arts\r\nand customs of civilized life;--so far, as to gain their consent,\r\nand the manifestation of an earnest purpose;-although it is well\r\nunderstood, that a transition from barbarism to civilization, is never\r\ninstantaneous, but the process of time, and pains, and slow degrees.\r\nSuch was a prominent object of this alliance, both with the Government\r\noriginally, and with the New York Indians; and such was the agreement\r\nand understanding of the parties. Such was the prospect in the outset,\r\nand in the first stages of the operation of this alliance; and there\r\nis no reason to suppose, that it would have been interrupted, but for\r\nthe interference of white men, who were interested in breaking up\r\nthese relations, and in leading on the parties to open rupture and\r\nirreconcileable hostility. And they have succeeded but too well. The\r\nMenomenies and Winnebagoes, once friendly, are now the implacable\r\nenemies of their brethren from the East. They have been persuaded,\r\nthat the New York Indians came there, not to help the North-West\r\nTribes, and improve their condition, as professed;--but to overreach\r\nand root them out. The old French settlers have been brought into\r\nthe league, not only by their influence, but by being encouraged to\r\nassert vexatious claims over Indian lands, and bring actions for\r\nejectment;--or to sell their claims to those, who know better how to\r\nmanage them. White citizens from the States have flocked in, to fill\r\nthe public offices, to occupy the posts of trade, and to anticipate the\r\nmeans of future wealth, which an organized and independent Government\r\nwill afford them;--all alike interested in the ejectment of their\r\nimmediate predecessors;--and all this in violation of the original\r\nunderstanding between the New York Indians and the General Government.\r\nAnd as white men are always superior to Indians, in all matters of\r\nbusiness, in political management, and in commercial transactions; so\r\nin the present instance have they thoroughly established themselves\r\nby converting all possible influences in their own favour, and\r\nagainst their opponents. The Menomenies and Winnebagoes have been put\r\nforward to contest with the tribes from New York--to express their\r\ndissatisfactions to their great Father, the President--to impeach the\r\nCovenants, under which they had sold their lands--to ask for special\r\nCommissions to investigate and settle the disputes;--and the result,\r\nthe meanwhile, being anticipated, the territory has been occupied,\r\nand the white settlements commenced, as if no question, as to right,\r\nwere pending, and no doubt entertained of the future removal of the\r\nIndians. And while I am writing these pages I have learned, that\r\nthree of the most considerable tribes of the North-West Territory,\r\nviz. the Winnebagoes, the Saukes, and the Foxes, have already been\r\npersuaded to sell their lands to the United States, and agreed to go\r\nbeyond the Mississippi. The other wild tribes, no doubt, will soon\r\nfollow them;--and the New York Indians will find themselves in the\r\nsame situation, as they were before they removed. That is:-surrounded\r\nby the whites, and permitted to retain such reservations of land, as\r\nwill not materially interfere with the political designs of those, who\r\nhave thrown them within such narrow limits. It will be understood,\r\nthen, that the tribes more immediately brought into controversy with\r\nthe New York Indians, were the Winnebagoes and Menomenies; who in\r\nthe whole affair have obeyed the instructions of those interested\r\nwhite people, that had gained an ascendency over them, for their own\r\npurposes. “These poor Menomenies and Winnebagoes,” it was said, “have\r\nbeen overreached, and robbed of their hunting and fishing grounds, by\r\ntheir more crafty brethren from New York. We wish to see their lands\r\nrestored.” For what? The honest answer would have been:--“That we may\r\nget them ourselves.” These men felt a great deal of sympathy for the\r\nwild tribes, so long as their lands were under the control of Indians,\r\nwho had learned, by experience, how to keep them from the white man.\r\nThat is:--They had learned how, so far as any dependence was to be put\r\nin covenants. But the moment this country is wrested from the New York\r\nIndians, all their tender scruples vanish; and they are ready to enter\r\nimmediately into negotiations, that shall place the same lands in their\r\nown power, and compel the former possessors to retire into an unknown\r\nwilderness! “But, they say, we give them a fair and honourable price.”\r\nWhat? The value in the market of the white man? The price negotiated\r\nfor some millions of acres in this very territory, in 1832, was less\r\nthan the half of a farthing per acre!!! “But, we give them another\r\ncountry.” Where is it? And what is it? And, if it be good for any\r\nthing, how long will they be permitted to stay there?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMANNER OF CALLING THE COUNCIL AND THE PREPARATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had occupied from twelve to fifteen days, after the arrival of the\r\nCommissioners at Green Bay, to convene the public Council ordered and\r\ncontemplated. The day fixed for organizing its sessions was the 24th\r\nof August. In the mean time _runners_ they are called among Indians,\r\nand as in fact they are, (couriers) were despatched to all the tribes\r\ninterested in the public deliberations about to be opened, to notify\r\nthem of the time, place, and object of the Convention. They were\r\nformally served with copies of letters from their great Father, the\r\nPresident of the United States, assuring them of his good wishes,\r\nand of his desire to bring all their disputes to an amicable and\r\nsatisfactory adjustment; and that for this purpose he had sent Erastus\r\nRoot, John T. Mason, and James M’Call, good and true men, to hold a\r\n_talk_[13] with his children in the North-West, who had quarrelled\r\namong themselves, and asked their great Father’s mediations;--to hear\r\nall they might have to say on either side;--to recommend peace and a\r\njust settlement of their disputes;--to remove all occasions of the\r\nimproper interference of their great Father’s white children;--and then\r\nto come back to the Council-house of the great nation at Washington,\r\nand say: “All the sores are healed.” And this would give their great\r\nFather much happiness.\r\n\r\nSuch was the _substance_ of the notices sent to the chiefs of the\r\ntribes, as in a plural number of instances I heard them delivered\r\nand interpreted;--kind enough certainly, and very promising. And\r\nthese notices were accompanied by a certified copy of the particular\r\ninstructions, given to the Commissioners, and investing them with their\r\npowers;--setting forth the understanding of the case in that department\r\nof Government at Washington, whose duty it is to superintend this sort\r\nof business;--prescribing the course of procedure, and controlling the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nAs a question afterwards arose, whether it was proper thus to have\r\nmade these instructions public, and some regret was manifested by the\r\nCommissioners, that they had done so, instead of keeping them in their\r\nown power, I shall take no advantage of an official inadvertence, which\r\nwas afterwards regretted by the board of Commissioners. I have already\r\nrecognized the bearings of these instructions in another place. As\r\nI have sufficient reasons to believe, that notwithstanding they had\r\nthe formal sanction of the Government, the construction of them was\r\nyet resigned to a private discretion, which was previously inclined\r\nto what I esteem to be the wrong side, I am not ambitious to expose\r\nthem. This supposed history of the instructions may, perhaps, save\r\nthe conscience of the highest authorities, in this particular item.\r\nThey did not understand the case; and it was _convenient_ to leave the\r\nmatter in hands, where it ought not to have been left. But, whatever\r\nresults might come, the President of the United States would of course\r\nbe compromitted, and must sanction them.\r\n\r\nNor would I insinuate, that there was any thing in these instructions,\r\nmore or less, than, that, in the first place:--they were based\r\nupon incorrect information, and assumed facts, which had had no\r\nexistence;--and _next_, that they left no power with the Commissioners\r\nto do right, and obliged them to do wrong, if they did any thing.\r\n\r\nEven if the Commissioners had been left to their own unrestricted\r\ndiscretion, it was no easy matter for them to come at the right of\r\nthe case. There were moral obstacles in their way: they were in the\r\nconfidence of an administration, the general policy of which, in\r\nregard to the Indians, was known to be:--to throw them all west of the\r\nMississippi. They must have some respect, therefore, to the trust,\r\nwhich had been reposed in them by supreme authority. And next:--the\r\ninfluence of the North-West, in support of the administration, to\r\nwhich the Commissioners were devoted, was worth something. _They_\r\nmust not be _astounded_ by the manifestation of a determination in\r\nthe Commissioners to restore the original rights of the Indians;--or\r\nto assume, as a basis of their deliberations, the first covenants\r\nbetween the New York Indians and the wild tribes of the North-West\r\nTerritory. That would never do. The Green Bay settlement of whites had\r\nalready been commenced. Men, too important to the party in power, to\r\nbe despised, were already planted there; and had a great interest at\r\nstake in the organization of the North-West Territory into a separate\r\ngovernment. To think, therefore, of throwing a _bar_ in their way, and\r\ncircumventing their designs, would be running a risk, which could not\r\nconveniently be hazarded. It was prudent, therefore, to _assume_, that\r\nthis territory _must_ become a separate State;--and that nothing must\r\nbe done by this Commission, that would interfere with such a purpose.\r\n\r\nBesides:--the confusion and contradiction of testimony, while opening\r\ntheir ears to all parties, would naturally afford abundant materials\r\nof an apology for pursuing a middle course--and of swerving even\r\ntowards that side, which it might be deemed most important to please.\r\nAnd although their decisions, controlled by such considerations,\r\nmight not be a final settlement of the dispute; yet they would afford\r\nsome plausibility of defence against the complaints of either party,\r\nand leave open the door for the consummation of the designs of _only\r\none_;--and which that _one_ might be, it is unnecessary to say.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was curious, and in no small degree interesting, to observe the\r\narrangements making among the Indians for the public Convocation of the\r\n24th of August. Some several days beforehand, Indian canoes were seen\r\nfloating and gliding along on the placid bosom of Fox River, part of\r\nthem coming down the current from the south and west, and part coming\r\nup from the shores of the Bay, towards the place of rendezvous, near\r\nFort Howard, on the north bank and some four or five miles from the\r\nmouth of the river, in the heart of what is called the settlement of\r\nGreen Bay:--all filled with men, women, and children, and with tackle,\r\nnot for war, but to build _lodges_. In other words, they brought their\r\nfamilies, their houses, and all their furniture of life, with them. For\r\nthe last two or three days previous, the number flocking in greatly\r\naugmented;--and the very last day before the 24th was a time of great\r\nbustle and activity. The river literally swarmed with canoes. And all\r\nalong its banks on either side, within a mile of the point fixed upon\r\nto hold the Council, lodges of Indians might be seen, single or in\r\nclusters, teeming with their peculiar and various population of men,\r\nwomen, children, dogs, pet bears, pet foxes, &c. &c. It is understood,\r\nof course, that I am now speaking of _wild_ Indians. Those belonging to\r\nthe same tribe manifested a disposition to concentrate at one point,\r\nand maintain the exclusive occupancy of the position.\r\n\r\nThe Menomenians took up their position on the plain behind the fort, on\r\nthe north bank of the river;--and there in the course of two or three\r\ndays built a town. For so it seemed--and so it was--a town of Indian\r\nlodges, grouped and thrown together without any order, every new comer\r\nsetting up his tent, as near to those already established, as possible;\r\nuntil many acres of the plain were completely covered, and exhibited\r\na rare spectacle to the eye. An Indian lodge is neither larger, nor\r\nhigher, than a soldier’s tent--it is itself properly a tent; and is as\r\nsoon taken down and as soon set up. The fashion and show of it are as\r\nunsightly as can well be imagined--covered with large sheets of birch\r\nbark, and encircled by a wall composed perhaps of a yard-wide matting,\r\nwoven from some coarse vegetable substance, not unlike the bulrush.\r\nSome of the lodges are entirely open to the weather. The ground is\r\ntheir floor and their bed, except as some of them can afford a piece\r\nof matting;--a blanket the ordinary and principal article of clothing,\r\nexcept as parts of the person are concealed by some slight and loose\r\narticles of undress. Females, that can afford it, are fond of gaudy and\r\nglaring calicoes, for a short gown; and will tie around them a yard\r\nsquare of blue woollen, for a petticoat, without a stitch bestowed upon\r\nit; the list, or border, running around the bottom, being regarded\r\nas ornamental. The addition of a pair of scarlet gaiters, buck-skin\r\nmoccasins, a string of beads, and beaver hat, would make a perfect\r\nlady. But few are seen making such an extravagant show. Displays of\r\nthis sort belong to the privileged orders.\r\n\r\nBut I was speaking of this town of the Menomenies, which so suddenly,\r\nand so much like enchantment sprung into being before our eyes, on the\r\nnorth bank of Fox River. I rose one morning a little after the sun,\r\nhaving lodged on the opposite bank; and as the clouds of fog, resting\r\nupon the river, began to break and float away, my eye caught, through\r\nthe shifting openings of the mist, a glance or two of what seemed a\r\ngreat city, reflecting the rays of the morning sun; and of the lazy\r\ncolumns of smoke, issuing from countless chimnies:--all for the moment\r\na perfect illusion. The fog was soon gone--and lo! it was the Menomenie\r\ncity of lodges! To visit them, and go among them, and see how they\r\nlive, does not present their condition as at all enviable. Wild Indians\r\nare generally an indolent, sordid, and filthy race--sunk into some of\r\nthe lowest conditions of barbarism.\r\n\r\nThe Winnebagoes, for the most part, made their encampment on the\r\nsouth side of the river, not differing materially from those of the\r\nMenomenies, except in not being so extensive. The whole number of\r\nIndians collected on this occasion was perhaps a little less than\r\n_three thousand_;--it being intended only as a convocation of the\r\nchiefs. But curiosity, and the hope of participating in the gratuitous\r\ndistributions of some food, and whiskey, and trifling articles, which\r\nare commonly made by the Government on such occasions, had brought\r\nthem together. It is humiliating and painful to be obliged to witness\r\nthe sordid passion of the wild Indian, which not only allows him to\r\nreceive a gift from the hand of a white man; but which, like the hungry\r\nspaniel, causes him to jump at the veriest and vilest crumb, which the\r\nwhite man throws at his feet. It shows but too well, how much and how\r\naltogether the Indian is in the white man’s power.\r\n\r\nI have been painfully struck and often deeply affected, at the proofs\r\nI had at Green Bay, of the extreme and unguarded susceptibility of\r\nthe Indians, of being injured in morals and manners, and of being\r\nprecipitated to irretrievable ruin, by intercourse with vicious and\r\nunprincipled white men. To make a gain of their simplicity, is by no\r\nmeans the greatest offence. The dishonour sometimes done to the fairest\r\nof their women, is frightful. If the Government had any suitable\r\nparental care over the Indians, whom it calls children; and calls them\r\nso, I think, more in mockery, than in propriety; and whose filial\r\nconfidence it inspires only to gain advantage over their credulity;\r\n(I declare it as a _consequence_, rather than an _intent_) it would\r\ncertainly never authorise these public occasions. They are demoralising\r\nbeyond all estimation--fearfully so. It is not simply a season of\r\ndissipation--it is a time of absolute and uninterrupted riot--a riot of\r\ndrunkenness and debauchery.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, that the Indian is constitutionally adapted to\r\ndrunkenness, when he can get the means, and to its consequent vices\r\nand ruin; and that there is no use in trying to save him. They are a\r\nrace devoted to the doom of annihilation. In other words:--the sooner\r\nthere is an end of them, the better;--as they occupy ground, which\r\ncan be more usefully appropriated. I would not ascribe this shocking\r\nmorality--this inhumanity--this sentiment, which proves the man, who\r\nutters it, more a savage and ruthless barbarian, than the race which he\r\nproscribes;--no, I would not ascribe it to any considerable portion of\r\na community. But yet--it has been said. And more: it is a leaven of no\r\ninconsiderable influence. I would be glad to believe, that it has no\r\ninfluence with men, who are to be found in high places.\r\n\r\nIs it necessary to say, that this charge is as egregiously\r\nunphilosophical, as it is atrociously cruel and libellous? I have\r\ncalled it inhuman; it is all that; it is barbarous. The Indian, in his\r\nwild condition, is an uncultivated and simple child of nature; and in\r\naddition to this, and to account for the whole, it is only necessary\r\nto say:--that the Indian is a _man_. It is not essential to bring in\r\na doctrine of the Christian religion;--common experience is enough,\r\nto prove, that human nature, unprotected, will catch vice. The Indian\r\nloves excitement, without regard to consequence;--because he is too\r\nsimple to reckon upon consequences. Ardent spirits produce at once\r\nthat delightful and romantic delirium, in which he likes to revel; and\r\nhaving once tasted the sweets of the intoxicating draught, and being\r\nwithout education and without the influences of a cultivated society\r\nto protect him, and without character to lose, (for intemperance among\r\nIndians is not dishonourable) is it strange, that he should seek that\r\nexemption, which it affords, from a sense of the hardships, and from\r\nthe cares of his destitute condition? Is it strange, that he should fly\r\nto the arms of that delicious enjoyment, which it yields to the grosser\r\naffections of his uncultivated nature? If, with all the protections\r\nof a refined education, and under all the checks and remonstrances\r\nof civilized society, with the loss of character impending, and the\r\nforesight of certain ruin, temporal and eternal, so many thousands of\r\nthe best and the highest are daily falling victims to this insinuating\r\nfoe of human happiness--shall it be said, that the untutored Indian\r\nalone is constitutionally disposed;--that he is born a drunkard;--and\r\nthat there is no salvation for him?--It is disgraceful--it is\r\nabominable--it is as cruel as it is unchristian.\r\n\r\nI protest, therefore, on the ground of humanity--and if it were\r\npossible, I would make the notes of my remonstrance ring in the\r\nconscience-chamber of the highest authorities, at the city of\r\nWashington, until they might blush, and be made afraid of the wrath\r\nof heaven, so long as they are accustomed to appoint and hold these\r\npublic negotiations with the Indian tribes, under circumstances so\r\ndemoralizing and so ruinous. The Indian comes to such a place with his\r\nfamily, comparatively uncorrupt. They come from their remote and quiet\r\nabodes, and from an even tenor of life. Neither he, nor they can resist\r\ntemptation. They receive presents; and what is worst of all, whisky is\r\ndealt out to them, at the order of the Commissioners; they buy it at\r\nthe shops of the white man; and then all is wildness and tumult. The\r\nIndian is no longer himself. They riot together in intemperance, and\r\nthe worst of vices. They lie drunk in heaps. You cannot walk abroad,\r\nbut you must dodge to keep out of the way of the staggering and\r\nfurious Indian. The grey-headed chief and the well-formed and athletic\r\nyouth reel along the way together. The mother and her daughter and her\r\nlittle child are often seen in the same condition.\r\n\r\nAs we dropped anchor in the river on our first arrival, attracted by\r\ncuriosity, several Indian canoes came along-side, in which I observed\r\na number of the natives of a more respectable condition,--and for\r\nthem, well-dressed. Some of them displayed silver ornaments of no\r\ninconsiderable value, (for which they are very partial) lying upon\r\ntheir shoulders and neck, and suspended from their ears and nose. Among\r\nthe rest I saw a beautiful young woman, richly dressed, full of smiles,\r\nand really charming. She stood, and moved, and shone in all her maiden\r\npride and loveliness. The next day, as I was walking along the banks of\r\nthe river, with company, I met this same young woman, but thoroughly\r\ntransformed. Her beaver-hat was laid aside--her hair dishevelled--her\r\ncostly dress and ornaments, if still retained, were all hidden by a\r\nblanket, thrown over her shoulders, and covering the whole person--and\r\nwith a countenance dejected and disconsolate, and her eye fixed upon\r\nthe ground, she moaned piteously along the way, regarding none, and\r\nwith a voice, which though sweetly musical, yet fell upon the ear in\r\nsuch plaintive and thrilling intonations, as to reveal at once all her\r\nconscious wretchedness, and challenge the deepest sympathy. “What is\r\nthe matter with that girl?” I asked. “She has, doubtless, been tempted\r\nto drink, and then dishonoured, and is now deserted by a white man;\r\nand she sees and feels her irretrievable ruin, and is too simple a\r\nchild of nature not to betray it!” “But may it not be supposed, that\r\nshe has been injured by one of her own tribe?” “Never--never.” The\r\nsecond person of this brief dialogue was a man, whose opinion, in such\r\na matter, may be respected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION AND OPENING OF THE COUNCIL; FORMALITIES, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners and suite had taken lodgings at an inn on the south\r\nbank of Fox River, about half a mile from Fort Howard, which is on the\r\nopposite side, and down the stream. A number of strangers also were\r\nin lodgings at the same house;--that being the only establishment of\r\nthe kind in the settlement. As a consequence it was the natural centre\r\nof the Indians, the French, and the citizens of the States, who were\r\nhovering about, either from interest or curiosity, to witness the\r\nexhibitions of the occasion and the doings of the Convention. Directly\r\nopposite this inn, on the north bank, the Commissioners had caused to\r\nbe erected what is vulgarly called, in the back woods of America, a\r\n_shanty_; and which signifies a temporary shelter, got up to answer a\r\npresent necessity. This shanty, or shantee, was merely a roof of rough\r\nboards, covering perhaps a space of thirty by sixty feet, with a long\r\nand rough table crossing one end, to accommodate the court and their\r\nsecretaries; and the rest of the ground under cover was filled up with\r\nranges of forms, or planks, resting on blocks of wood, for the chiefs,\r\nand for other Indians, who might choose to be spectators. There being\r\nno sides, or walls to the shanty, an indefinite multitude of persons,\r\nwho could not get under the roof, might stand without. This temporary\r\nstructure, it is to be understood, was set upon an open plain, not\r\nonly because there was no public hall, or building, in the settlement,\r\nadapted to the purpose; but more especially to afford a freedom of\r\naccess and retreat to the natives, who could not comfortably endure\r\nconfinement. Here they might come near, or stand a little way off, or\r\nsquat down, or lie down, as suited themselves;--and smoke their pipes,\r\nand indulge in any and all of their odd freaks and whimsical manners.\r\n\r\nAll things being arranged on the morning of the 24th, the chiefs of\r\nthe tribes, who were interested in the deliberations to be opened,\r\nbeing assembled, in pursuance of the notices, which had been served\r\nupon them, at the order of the Commissioners; and the flat-bottomed\r\nferry boat, being put in requisition for the occasion, and drawn to\r\nthe shore, the Honourable the Commissioners, their secretaries,\r\ninterpreters, some of the chiefs, and strangers--as many as the\r\nboat could conveniently receive--began to make demonstration of a\r\ngrave and solemn movement towards the place of grave and solemn\r\ndeliberation;--accompanied, as they crossed the stream, by numerous\r\nskiffs and canoes, filled with all sorts, whites and Indians, old\r\nand young, male and female, ragged or otherwise;--not indeed a very\r\nsplendid cortège.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Commissioners, having landed on the other shore, with\r\nall due solemnity and decorum, took their seats, supported by their\r\nsecretaries;--and the motley crew of spectators began to crowd around.\r\nDirectly in front of the Commissioners, and face to face, the chiefs of\r\nthe Indian tribes arranged themselves, with such formalities, as might\r\nbe peculiar to each nation, rather comical, and not a little amusing.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of the Menomenies, however, were wanting in the group. A\r\nmessage was sent to their camp, at the distance of a quarter of a mile,\r\nthat their Fathers, the Commissioners, were waiting their attendance.\r\nBut their immobility of temper suffered no shock. They were not ready.\r\nAnother messenger was despatched. But still their movements were in no\r\nwise hurried. They could not understand, but that all the world, if\r\nneeds be, must wait their convenience. The Court grew impatient, and\r\nbegan to feel annoyed at the disrespect. The crowd of spectators also\r\nmanifested symptoms of uneasiness, and began to apprehend some little\r\nstorm of collision; and perhaps a failure of the amusing transactions\r\nanticipated. By and by, however, were seen in the distance, and\r\nslowly approaching, a solemn procession, halting occasionally, making\r\nstrange evolutions, apparently performing certain mysterious rites,\r\nand holding converse with invisible agencies. They came near, they\r\nretreated, they traced circles and other more irregular figures, and\r\npleased themselves, in the time they occupied in getting to the place\r\nof assembling. At last they stood without the booth, halting, still\r\nmultiplying and varying their mysterious rites. They faced, and looked\r\nupon the Court with imperturbable gravity, seeming to say:--“You\r\nwill wait our pleasure.” Their manners, indeed, and the delay they\r\noccasioned, were not a little provoking to our patience. With the\r\nsame grave and solemn mien the chiefs entered the pavilion, with\r\npipe and tomahawk in hand, and occupied the vacant seats assigned to\r\nthem;--imposing an awe, alike upon the Commissioners and spectators, by\r\ntheir strange and unaccountable demonstrations. Not a feature of their\r\ncountenance was seen to move.\r\n\r\nIndians always enter upon public and important deliberations with great\r\nformality. And the Menomenies, being by far more numerous than the\r\nWinnebagoes on the present occasion, making three-fourths of the entire\r\nassemblage,--and to whom all the country about Green Bay originally\r\nbelonged,--that is, before it was assumed by the whites,--seemed\r\ndisposed to make more of the pending solemnities;--or at least, were\r\nmore tardy in the completion of their preliminary forms. In the present\r\ninstance, the formality of a council-fire was dispensed with; for what\r\nreason I know not, unless that it was not considered purely an Indian\r\nCouncil. The _pipe of friendship_, however, the bowl being silver and\r\nstuck to a tube of four feet long, was solemnly filled with tobacco,\r\nand solemnly lighted, and solemnly presented to the President of the\r\nCourt, who solemnly took one solemn whiff;--and then with the same\r\nsolemnity it was passed to the second and third members of the Court,\r\nwho solemnly puffed in their turn;--but all with a grace and dignity,\r\ninfinitely inferior to the manner of the chiefs. The latter understood\r\nit. But the Court, alas! were extremely awkward and embarrassed. But\r\nwhen it came to the chiefs successively, it was a sublime sight! I\r\nwill not attempt to describe it. But of this I am quite sure:--that,\r\nif the Commissioners had allowed the Indians to smoke first, they\r\nwould have profited greatly by the example; or been scared out of it\r\nin despair;--and thus, perhaps, the object of their mission to Green\r\nBay, would have been circumvented; in which case, no great loss to the\r\nworld. For nothing could be done, without smoking the pipe. And by this\r\nsolemnity the Council was organized and opened--with this addition,\r\nhowever: that the chiefs exceeding the Court in politeness and in the\r\nmanifestation of good feeling, each in turn, and all in train, rose\r\nand gave the right hand to each of the Commissioners, in succession.\r\nIndeed the members of the Court, who had never before had to do in such\r\nmatters, nor witnessed such a scene, were evidently ill at home, and\r\nhad well nigh lost their self-possession.\r\n\r\nThe scene of the organization was indeed highly picturesque. I dare\r\nto say, that such another congregation of human beings was scarcely\r\never assembled, as the commonalty of the Indians, and the various\r\ndegrees of mixed blood, that crowded around, as spectators. There was\r\nevery shade and feature of French and Indian, under the same skin;\r\nand every incongruous combination of dress upon them, from the first\r\ncorruption of European fashion, down to the purest Indian. And there\r\nwas the naked savage; (_all_ naked, except two small aprons of twelve\r\ninches square, one before and one behind) some covered only with a\r\nblanket, thrown over the shoulders, or else carelessly tucked around\r\nthe waist, leaving the upper part of the body and the arms exposed;\r\nmany of them looking, as if they had neither been washed, nor combed,\r\nsince they were born; not a few bedaubed in paints of all colours,\r\nfrom the most glaring red, down to shades, as black as Erebus; and\r\ntheir eyes sparkling and flashing like the startled snake, from\r\nunder a countenance so awfully disfigured; the whole being a fair\r\nrepresentation of the worst pictures, that imagination has drawn, of\r\nthe _Evil One_; some with one side of the face red, and the other\r\nblack; others showing a great variety of colours, most fantastically\r\nthrown together; one with one feather in the hair, another with two,\r\nor more, and some with twenty, or less; part of them sitting under the\r\npavilion, part standing without, and part lying down in the open plain\r\nupon their breasts, with their heads sticking up, like snakes, from\r\nthe grass; all furnished with pipes, of their own manufacture, varying\r\nin length from four feet to four inches, and a tobacco-pouch made of\r\nthe skin of some animal, in which is also carried an apparatus for\r\nstriking fire; every one girt with a cincture about his loins, to which\r\nwas suspended a knife in its scabbard, devoted to all the imaginable\r\npurposes of a knife;--that is--to cut his tobacco, to whittle a stick,\r\nto dress his game, to eat with, to scalp his enemy, &c. &c. In the hand\r\nof each Indian is always to be seen, besides his pipe, a bow and arrow,\r\nor tomahawk, or rifle, or weapon of some description;--more generally\r\nhis tomahawk is his pipe, the head serving as the bowl, and the\r\nhandle for the stem, it being bored into a tube;--and nameless other\r\nappearances did this assemblage exhibit, which language is inadequate\r\nto describe:--all waiting to see and hear.\r\n\r\nBut there was another group, called Indians, sitting by themselves,\r\nwhose dress, countenance, manners, and every appearance exhibited\r\nall the decencies of civilized life. They looked and acted like men,\r\nwho respected themselves, and would be respected by others. Their\r\npresence and entire demeanour would not have lowered the dignity of any\r\nparliamentary assembly. These were the New York Indians. I had often\r\nseen them at their own villages, in the State of New York;--but I never\r\nknew how to respect them before. I never thought it was possible for\r\nother human beings to be sunk so far below them, as to raise them by\r\ncomparison to such a proud pre-eminence. All wore the same natural\r\ncomplexion, and all were evidently of the same stock. But _here_ was\r\na class _elevated_--distinguished by such marks of superiority, as to\r\nmake the difference between them and their wild untutored brethren,\r\ngreater than would appear, by bringing together the highest and the\r\nlowest, the very extremes of society, that can be found in all Europe.\r\nAnd during the whole session of the Council, for a period of eight\r\ndays, the New York Indians rose higher and higher, by their pure and\r\nexemplary conduct, in their claims to respect and confidence. Indeed,\r\nthe extraordinary occurrences and scenes of Green Bay, after we\r\narrived, had been so absorbing, that I seemed to forget the rest of the\r\nworld, while I was there. They were interesting for their novelty, but\r\nsickening and revolting for the unpleasant exhibitions of human nature,\r\nwith which they were accompanied. It was exactly that state of things,\r\nwhere the virtue of barbarism has been confounded, and the order of\r\ncivilized society is not yet established. For my own part, I found it\r\na refuge to fall into the society of the chiefs and principal men of\r\nthe New York Indians. Among them I could be sure of exemption from any\r\nthing vulgar, profane, indecent, or intemperate. For moral worth and\r\ngood manners, they rose and towered above every thing around them, not\r\nexcepting the white population, during that long and protracted public\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of chiefs admitted into the Council, to represent\r\nthe tribes interested, were, I believe, about _thirty_:--representing\r\nthe Stockbridges, the Oneidas, and Brothertons, of the State of\r\nNew York;--and the Menomenies, Winnebagoes, and Chippeways, of the\r\nNorth-West Territory. The Brothertons were interested, as purchasers\r\nof land, although they had not yet removed. The Chippeways were also\r\nallowed to be interested in some of the discussions pending. And\r\nall these tribes speak so many different languages; the Brothertons\r\nexcepted, who speak only English. Of course all the doings of the\r\nCouncil, and all deliberations were required to be brought, by\r\ninterpretation, into each of the tongues. For example: when the\r\nCommissioners spoke, their addresses and remarks passed _directly_ into\r\nthe languages of the New York Indians, which are two; but _mediately_\r\nthrough French into Menomenie and Winnebago. The necessity of employing\r\nthe French language arose from the want of an interpreter _immediately_\r\nbetween English and the languages spoken by the Winnebagoes and\r\nMenomenies. But there were many _half-bloods_, as they are called,\r\nthat could speak French, and one or the other of these languages, with\r\nequal fluency; having been brought up in families, where both tongues\r\nare in use. When a Menomenie chief spoke--for the Commissioners, it\r\npassed through French into English; for the Winnebagoes, through French\r\ninto their language; and for the New York Indians, through French and\r\nEnglish, into theirs respectively; and _vice versâ_. The Chippeway\r\nlanguage would have made the communication more direct, as it is more\r\nor less common, in all those regions, and with the different tribes.\r\nBut in matters deemed important, they did not like to trust to any\r\nuncertainty. Interpretation was generally done at the end of every\r\nshort sentence;--and after the utterance of every simple thought;--a\r\nslow and tedious process. And by the time a thought had passed,\r\n_mediately_, into a third, and sometimes into a fourth language,\r\nit may easily be imagined, that without the most scrupulous and\r\naccurate interpretation, it was likely to have undergone some little\r\ntransformations.\r\n\r\nTo a spectator and stranger to Indian Councils, the most interesting\r\npart was the extemporaneous speeches of the chiefs; which were\r\ndelivered longer, or shorter, by more or less, on every day of the\r\npublic deliberations. The principal speakers were _four_ of the\r\nMenomenie chiefs; _two_ of the Winnebagoes; and _two_, and sometimes a\r\nthird and fourth, of the New York Indians.\r\n\r\nThe elocution of the New York Indians was unadorned in style, and mild\r\nin manner. Resting principally upon their written communications, they\r\nhad not much to say. Their education and long intercourse with the\r\nwhites had entirely disrobed them of the native wildness of Indian\r\neloquence. John Metoxen, however, an aged and venerable chief, of\r\nthe Stockbridges--(than whom a man of more exalted worth cannot be\r\nfound on earth)--on the last day of the Council, as all attempts at\r\nreconciliation and adjustment of differences had failed, addressed\r\nhimself _sentimentally_ to his brethren of the Menomenies and\r\nWinnebagoes; and also to the Commissioners, in a strain most sublime\r\nand touching; and with a respect and delicacy, towards the feelings of\r\nall concerned, unrivalled. Metoxen is about sixty years old, and head\r\nchief of his tribe. By his language and manner he first brought us into\r\nthe presence of God, so that we felt ourselves to be there. Even the\r\nwild Indians are a most religious people, and a pattern of piety to\r\nmany, who are called Christians. That is: they always acknowledge a\r\nsuperintending Providence. They never begin, nor end a speech, without\r\na reference to the Great Spirit. But John Metoxen is a Christian;--and\r\nhe has enlightened and practical views of the Christian’s God;--and on\r\nthe occasion now under consideration he made us feel his superiority,\r\nnot only as a Christian, but as a man. He appealed to the solemn\r\nengagements of the New York Indians on one hand, and of the Menomenies\r\nand Winnebagoes on the other, as the original contracting parties, now\r\nat variance; he called on the Commissioners to witness the repeated\r\nand solemn pledges of Government, to secure the fulfilment of these\r\nengagements; he depicted the anxious progress and unfortunate result of\r\nthe present Council; with inimitable delicacy and becoming manliness he\r\nfreely confessed his diffidence in the present measures of Government,\r\nrelating to this affair; he solemnly declared, that his only confidence\r\nnow rested in the God of nations, who had propounded himself the\r\nguardian of the oppressed, and the avenger of their wrongs;--and\r\nwhatever might become of himself, of his family, or of his people,\r\nhe felt, that it was now his last and only prerogative, to surrender\r\ntheir cause into the hands of their God. “_God is witness_,” said he,\r\nlifting up his eyes to heaven. “Brothers, I have no more to say.”[14]\r\n\r\nIt is due, that I should say something of the speeches of the wild\r\nMenomenies and Winnebagoes. No conception of romance, in my own mind,\r\nhad ever reached the wildness and extravagance of their thoughts, or of\r\ntheir manner of expressing them. And besides this, they are not wanting\r\nin shrewdness, and what perhaps, in more dignified bodies, would be\r\ncalled parliamentary device. For instance: it had happened, that the\r\nCommissioners, in their summonses sent to these tribes, had not served\r\nupon them a copy of their letter of instructions from the President, as\r\nthey had done to the New York tribes;--judging, not unwisely, that the\r\nWinnebagoes and Menomenies would have little occasion for the _litera\r\nscripta_. But before they would consent to proceed in the business of\r\nthe Council, they demanded to be made equal to the New York Indians\r\nin this particular; and as there seemed to be so much propriety and\r\nargument in the requisition, the Court rubbed their faces in confusion,\r\npromised them a copy, and adjourned.\r\n\r\nThe next day, the Winnebagoes and Menomenies still refused to go on\r\nfor want of an _interpreter_. It had happened, the day previous, that\r\nthe Commissioners had promised to provide for these tribes, in this\r\nparticular, and to submit to their own nomination, notwithstanding\r\nthat they had brought along the public interpreter from Detroit. But\r\nthe young man, a half-blood, named by these Indians, to discharge this\r\noffice, thinking himself equal to a Member of Congress, demanded _eight\r\ndollars_ (1_l._ 12_s._) per day. Whereupon the Commissioners demurred,\r\nand sent the Indians word, that they might get their own interpreter,\r\nif they did not like the one employed by the Commissioners. The\r\nIndians, however, thought better; and concluded to hold the\r\nCommissioners to their engagement. Council being assembled, the new\r\ninterpreter was not at his post. “What is the matter?”--said the Court.\r\nOne of the chiefs rose and said: “Our Fathers told us yesterday, they\r\nwould provide us an interpreter; and our Fathers are _true_ men”--and\r\nthen sat down. The crowd of barbarians roared out their applause, in\r\nthe most wild and tumultuous manner; the whites joined with them--and\r\nthe Commissioners, confounded, ordered an adjournment again; and\r\nhaving grown wiser by this schooling, engaged the interpreter, as was\r\nunderstood, on his own terms.\r\n\r\nThe wild Indians are not bad in managing the few facts, which\r\nthey have in their possession; and they are certainly possessed of\r\nunrivalled skill in magnifying trifles and dignifying nothings. They\r\nwill deliver themselves of the following sentence, (which by the by is\r\nonly one word:)--“Yerensotavakarangetakowa”--in a manner to astound all\r\none’s senses, and raise the highest expectation. And lo! when it comes\r\nto be interpreted, it reads:--“_the greatest fiddle possible_”--alias,\r\n_a church organ_, which he had seen in the white man’s council-house;\r\nand which he wished to describe to his own people. The Menomenie and\r\nWinnebago chiefs uniformly commenced their addresses, or speeches,\r\nand almost every sentence--(after waiting for the interpreter to\r\nperform his office)--with a strong, monosyllabic exclamation,\r\ninvolving very emphatically the guttural and aspirate elements, and\r\nsignifying:--“_Attention--hear--I am about to speak_.” It would be\r\nmockery for any but an Indian to attempt to exemplify it. The chiefs\r\nwould always address themselves directly to the Commissioners, and with\r\nthe greatest possible vehemence, as if they understood; and when they\r\nhad finished a sentence, they would wait for the interpreter. I do not\r\nremember to have heard a single sentence from a Winnebago, or Menomenie\r\nchief, in Council, whether the subject were important, or trifling,\r\nor in whatever degree it might have either of these characters, when\r\nit was not superlatively marked with a loud and vehement elocution,\r\nand an impassioned and violent manner; as if the fate of the world, or\r\nof the universe, were pending on the question, or the thought. If the\r\nsentiment uttered met with the approbation of their people, a deep and\r\nloud guttural, or ventral _grunt_, and sometimes a boisterous uproar,\r\nwould express their applause. This single, _ventral_ expression of\r\napprobation, if it might be called so, was apt to be heard, at the end\r\nof every sentence, when they were gratified. And I question, whether\r\nany orators of a civilized people, ancient or modern, were ever better\r\nsupported by the generous applause and loud acclamations of their\r\nauditors. It was impossible not to observe the increased animation of\r\nthe speakers, from this cause; as also the quick sympathy, between\r\nthemselves and their people. If the thought, when interpreted, seemed\r\ntrifling to us, it was not always so to them. Indians, like children,\r\nare often amused with trifles; and not unfrequently exhaust their\r\ngravest meditations on trifles: like children they can be pleased,\r\nand even delighted with a toy. But sometimes they stand up, and show\r\nthemselves like men; and men of the highest order. They are not great\r\nby education, but on the instant, for the particular occasion. “There\r\nis a spirit in man, and God hath given him understanding.” _Nature_ is\r\nin the Indians;--and when a high demand, an imperative call challenges\r\nits proof, it comes like the lightning, and astounds like the thunder;\r\nwhether it be in the council-house, or from the battle ambush. And now\r\nand then, during the deliberations of this Council, we had these proofs\r\nof Indian sagacity and power, not to be despised. For a sentimental\r\nappeal, a delicate allusion, or a sublime flight, when occasion puts\r\nhim to it, the Indian is unrivalled; and for the keenness of wit, and\r\nthe severity of sarcasm, he is not wanting. For the generosity of his\r\nnature, it is without bounds. I have already spoken of some of these\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nOf power over _sentiment_, I would quote the following: It was\r\nintimated to the Indians, by the Commissioners, towards the close of\r\nthe deliberations, that the usual presents from Government, at the\r\nbreaking up of such occasions, would be withheld, because they had\r\nrefused to come to an adjustment of differences. One of the Menomenie\r\nchiefs saw at a glance the desolateness of their prospects, and rose\r\ninstantly from his seat, and made the following speech: “Fathers,”\r\nsaid he, “when you sent to call us to this Council, we were building\r\ncanoes to gather the wild rice, that our families might have bread to\r\neat in the winter. But, as soon as we heard your voice, we left our\r\ncanoes unfinished, and came directly to this place. Fathers--the rice\r\nharvest is now come, our canoes are not built--and we shall have no\r\nbread for our families.” And when it is understood, that the first\r\nwind that blows, after the wild rice is ready for harvest, will waste\r\nit all, the force of this appeal can better be appreciated. It was, in\r\nthe circumstances and manner, altogether overpowering, and moved the\r\nCommissioners to grant the usual presents.\r\n\r\nIndian speeches, in public council, always abound in religious\r\nsentiments, or in a grateful recognition of Divine Providence; and\r\nin friendly congratulations. This sort of religion may be accounted\r\nfor, perhaps, from their own child-like improvidence, and their more\r\nimmediate dependence on the providence of God. Their other affections\r\nare also so child-like, that friendship and kindness are dear to them,\r\nas they are to children. I may say in one word: that the speeches\r\nof the Indian chiefs, on these occasions, demonstrated almost every\r\nattribute of greatness and littleness--much to admire and much to laugh\r\nat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHARGE OF INDIAN AFFAIRS IN THE WAR DEPARTMENT, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might perhaps be expected, that I should give more of the\r\n_political_ character of this Council, and make the Court itself as\r\nconspicuous, as the place they occupied; that I should report their\r\nprogress in order, and develope their transactions in detail, from\r\nbeginning to end. But the execution of the _entire_ of such a plan, I\r\nam disposed to think, would not be very edifying. I have wished all\r\nalong to keep, as near as possible, to that course, which might throw\r\nthe most light on these two questions:--What are the American Indians?\r\nAnd what is to become of them? And this is the course I still mean to\r\npursue, under my best endeavours, to the end. There are circumstances\r\nand features of this Council, yet untouched, that are worthy of notice\r\nfor such an object.\r\n\r\nIt is proper to observe, that all the affairs of the Indians, in\r\ntheir connexion and intercourse and official transactions with the\r\nGovernment of the United States, are in charge of the War Department.\r\nWith what propriety and for what reasons, I am unable to say. Neither\r\ncan I say confidently, that there is any impropriety, except that\r\nthe _name_ wears somewhat of a belligerent character, and would not\r\nnaturally lead one to expect so much _kindness_ from such a quarter,\r\nas the Indians have an undoubted right to claim. We may hope, indeed,\r\nthat this is not the reason, that such a perpetual _war_ has been\r\nwaged upon Indian rights, and threatens still to be carried on. I am\r\nquite sure, that this business was not originally committed to that\r\ndepartment of government for such an object; and if we are to look\r\nto the _temperament_ of the War Department, for the secret of these\r\ntroubles, the sooner a motion is made and carried, that this charge be\r\ntransferred to another office, or that a new department be created for\r\nthis specific object, the better.\r\n\r\nIt is in truth to the War Department of the United States, to which we\r\nmust look for all the immediate Government movements and transactions\r\nin relation to the Indians. There every plan in the treatment of\r\nIndians is conceived and organized;--and thence issue all the\r\nauthorities to hold agencies and commissions among them, for whatever\r\npurpose, of an official nature. The destiny of whole tribes is settled\r\nthere, and often by a single mind, without consultation. There were\r\nconceived, and as we have reason to believe, at the discretion of one\r\nindividual, the instructions of the Commissioners to Green Bay, for\r\n1830; which, if they had been permitted to go into effect, would have\r\nannihilated all the rights of the Indians concerned, at a single blow.\r\nWhen I say this, I of course speak of the _principles_, on which the\r\ninstructions were based. And it was no doubt the confident expectation\r\nof the War Department, that the Commissioners, on the present occasion,\r\nwould execute these instructions in full, and bring the plan to\r\nimmediate consummation.\r\n\r\nBut unforeseen obstacles interposed; the effect of which, however,\r\nwas only to suspend the result. The New York Indians had caused to be\r\nprepared a vindication of their rights, on the basis of the covenants\r\nbetween themselves and the North-West tribes; and of the understanding\r\nbetween themselves and the General Government;--the whole of which,\r\nit was the design of the instructions from the War Department to set\r\naside. In the considerations, specified in the instructions, as a basis\r\nand guide of the contemplated arrangement, there was no reference\r\nwhatever to these covenants. It is possible, and not improbable, that\r\nthe Commissioners had caused the New York tribes to be served with a\r\ncopy of these instructions, for the very purpose of notifying them\r\nof the course of procedure to be adopted. They improved the advice,\r\nhowever, in a different way from that, which we have here supposed\r\nwas intended:--they employed the mean time, in the preparation of an\r\nargument to establish their rights, and to show before this Court,\r\nbefore Congress, if needs be, and before the world, why they could not\r\nlegally, and why they ought not to be disturbed. It was a document\r\nof the greatest interest, as being done by Indians, allowing for the\r\nlittle assistance they received. Themselves furnished the materials,\r\ncollected the facts;--the final copy of the document was made by their\r\nown hand;--it was read before the Commissioners by one of their own\r\nnumber;--and laid upon their table, as the only basis, on which they\r\ncould act;--and it is now on file in the public office, at Washington,\r\nnot only as an unanswerable demonstration of the rights, which it\r\nvindicates, in this particular instance;--but as a proof equally\r\nunanswerable, that an Indian may be a statesman, not to suffer by a\r\ncomparison with any other. The New York Indians had among them, on\r\nthe present occasion, a plural number of men, of a liberal education.\r\nHaving right on their side, they were more than equal to the Court.\r\nThey were dignified in all their deportment; and when called upon, they\r\nentered their solemn protest against the course of procedure, of which\r\nthey had been notified, as determined on; laid the defence of their\r\nrights upon the table; and pointed to the _Bond_.\r\n\r\nWhat could the Commissioners do? Could they refuse to hear? and having\r\nheard, could they decently throw out the document?--and retaining it,\r\ncould they act upon it? The ground of discussion, which it opened,\r\nwas entirely beyond the scope of their instructions. Yet the course\r\npursued by the New York Indians seemed reasonable--all the world\r\nwould deem it reasonable. The moment this document was heard by the\r\nCommissioners, their good sense taught them at once, that the object of\r\ntheir mission to Green Bay was entirely defeated, under the limitations\r\nof their instructions. They could do nothing definitively, under\r\nthat instrument, without disgracing themselves, and disgracing the\r\nGovernment. The course pointed out, was a course of violence;--and\r\nhowever the end contemplated, was evidently resolved, and must finally\r\nbe attained--the Commissioners, suddenly opening their eyes to some\r\nrays of the truth and merits of the case, had not come to this duty\r\nsufficiently conscience-hardened, to jump at once to the conclusion, in\r\ndefiance of these covenants. The ground taken by the New York Indians,\r\nand the noble and intrepid vindication of their rights, was unexpected.\r\nIt had not been anticipated at the War Department;--nor by the prime\r\nmovers of the mischief on the premises;--it was not dreamt of any\r\nwhere. It was taken for granted, that they would yield to the menace\r\nheld over their heads, and take what was offered, rather than risk all.\r\n\r\nBut the Commissioners being there, they might as well do something.\r\nNotwithstanding the aspects of the case were entirely changed, by the\r\ndeclaration and vindication of the rights of the New York Indians,\r\nand an insuperable bar thrown in the way of their errand;--yet they\r\nmight as well hear what the Indians had to say on both sides; they\r\nmight collect information, and report thereon to the authority, under\r\nwhich they acted. They might also, perhaps, in existing circumstances,\r\nsafely hazard the use of some discretion. And so, it seems, they\r\ndid;--although within very prudent limits. They ventured to specify and\r\nrecommend terms of compromise, between the parties in controversy; and\r\nnot succeeding in this, they drew up a plan of settling the disputes,\r\nwhich they proposed to recommend to Government.\r\n\r\nBut it was impossible for _such_ men to settle this matter. It was\r\nimpossible, because they had come with wrong views of the case, and on\r\nthe general subject--themselves pledged to a policy ruinous to Indian\r\nrights; impossible, because they had no authority to do it, on proper\r\ngrounds; impossible, because of the conflicting testimony they were\r\nobliged to receive on the spot; and _impossible, because they could not\r\nagree among themselves_.\r\n\r\nThe Council was held eight days successively--Sunday excepted--without\r\nresult, except, that it furnished an admirable occasion for the\r\ndevelopement of Indian character and Indian wrongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XXIII.\r\n\r\nSPECIMENS OF INDIAN SPEECHES.\r\n\r\n_By_ JOHN METOXEN, _head Chief of the Stockbridge Tribe, on the\r\noccasion of laying on the table of the Commissioners, the Document,\r\nwhich contained at large the declaration and vindication of their\r\nrights_.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Brothers: hear what I have to say. Thanks to the great Spirit, who has\r\nbrought your faces to our faces in health and peace. We shake hands\r\nwith our great father, the President, in our hearts. We are glad to\r\ntake you, his children and our brothers, by the hand. May the chain of\r\nfriendship, which has so long bound us together, still bind us, while\r\nthe sun comes up in the Great Lake, and goes down in our forest.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, you know we have always been friends of our great father,\r\nthe President, who has promised to keep off our enemies, if we will\r\nhelp him keep off his enemies. We lived under his shadow first in the\r\neast country, (Massachusetts) next with our brothers in the State of\r\nNew York; and because our great father said, it would be better for\r\nus to come out here, we obeyed his voice, and came. Our great father\r\nsaid, he would not let the white man trouble us any more. He wished\r\nus to come here, and buy land of our brothers, the Menomenies and\r\nWinnebagoes, and settle down among them, and make them learn the good\r\nways of the white man--how to raise corn, and build houses, and make\r\ntheir own blankets, and other good things. Our father said, we should\r\nkeep the peace between him and the wild people of the North-West--that\r\nhe would give us and our children this land for ever--that he would\r\nnever let his white children come among us to sell our people strong\r\nwater, and cheat them, and get away their land--that the great lakes\r\nshould be a wall between us and them--that he would send good men to\r\ncome and see us, and ask what we want--that he would send us ploughs\r\nand all things good to raise corn--that he would send our women things\r\nto make cloth--that if any of the tribes should rise up against us, or\r\nquarrel among themselves, our father would reach out his long arm, and\r\nspeak with his mouth, and tell them to be still--and that here, under\r\nhis shadow, we should all live in peace, and grow up together, and\r\nbecome a great nation, like the white men,--and build good houses, and\r\nat last have one great father of our own, who should be in peace with\r\nour great father, the President.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, as we knew our great father was a true man and honourable,\r\nand as we believed he would never break his word, and that he had a\r\nstrong arm to make it good, we trusted to all he said. We were glad\r\nat his words. We let his white children take our lands and our homes\r\nin the State of New York, and we took our wives, and our children in\r\nour arms, and came across the great lakes to live here on Fox River.\r\nWe lighted the council-fire, and made peace with our brethren, the\r\nWinnebagoes and Menomenies. We gave them money for lands. They said,\r\nthey were glad to see us, and to have us come and live among them--and\r\nthat we would all be one people. They promised to leave hunting and\r\nfishing, and raise corn like us, and that their women should spin like\r\nour women--and that we would become as good and as great as white men.\r\nWe were all agreed--and we were all very glad.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, we did not think our great father, President Monroe, would\r\ndie so soon--or that another would come in his place to forget what\r\nhe had promised. We did not think, that our great father had so many\r\npapers in his table-drawer, that he could not find the one, on which\r\nhis agreement with us was written.\r\n\r\n“You see, brothers, the white man is here--he has brought strong water\r\nto sell to our people, to the Menomenies, to the Winnebagoes, and to\r\nthe Chippeways, to get them drunk, and make them quarrel. The Indian is\r\ngood for nothing, when he can get strong water. It makes him mad. He\r\nwill not work--he will whip his wife, and his child,--and perhaps kill\r\none, to be sorry for it the next day, when he cannot help it. Strong\r\nwater makes him quarrel with his neighbour, and they kill one another.\r\nThere is no peace, when the Indian can get strong water--but all things\r\ngo badly. Our great father the President, said--that the white man\r\nshould never come here, and sell our people strong water.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, you see the white people have come here to live--a great\r\nmany. And they tell us, that they will stay--and that more will\r\ncome--and that they will have our lands--and that we must go beyond the\r\nMississippi. All this makes us very sorry.\r\n\r\n“We lived in peace with the Winnebagoes and Menomenies, and with all\r\nthe tribes of the North-West. Our council-fire burnt well, and did not\r\ngo out. But, while we sat in peace around it, and smoked the pipe of\r\nfriendship with our brethren--the white man came in, and threw a big\r\nstone against the fire, and scattered the brands among our feet, and\r\nknocked them upon our blankets--and cried out: It is no peace--it is\r\nwar;--so that we could not stay. We run home, and our hearts were very\r\nsorry; and there has been no peace since. The white man will not let us\r\nspeak peace to our brethren. He tells our brethren, that we are their\r\nenemies--that we came here only to get away their country--and to drive\r\nthem off; and that if they will get back the lands, which they sold\r\nto us, they can sell them again to the whites, and get pay for them a\r\nsecond time; and that the whites will give a great deal more money,\r\nthan we gave. Three years ago (1827) they received a great bag of money\r\nfrom the city of Washington to buy these very lands on Fox River, which\r\nthey once sold to us. We do not know for what _good_ reason this money\r\nwas given them. We are afraid.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, I need not say much. We have put in writing what we think.\r\nIt has just been read to you, and is now in your hand. We wish you\r\nto think on what is written in that paper. We wish you to carry that\r\npaper to our great father, the President--and shake hands with him for\r\nus, and ask him to read and think of it. We wish it to be read before\r\nthe chiefs of the great nation, who stand around the fire of the great\r\ncouncil-house, at the city of Washington--that they may think of it.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, there is no longer peace between us and our brethren here.\r\nWe cannot speak with them. They do not come and see us--and we cannot\r\ngo and see them. The white man stands between us and keeps us apart. We\r\nsay one thing, and they say another thing. We no longer smoke the pipe\r\ntogether. We desire you to ask our great father to take away his white\r\nchildren, and when they are gone, we shall do well enough.\r\n\r\n“We need not tell you, brothers, to shut your ears against the words of\r\nthe white men, who have come up here, and who want our lands. We have\r\nbeen made very sorry to hear what they say.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, we look to you--we look to our great father, the\r\nPresident--we look to the chiefs of the great nation: we ask only for\r\nthe performance of their agreement. While you have that paper, you\r\nknow our mind. We shall wait with great desire to know the answer of\r\nour great father and of the chiefs at Washington.\r\n\r\n“I have no more to say.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is proper perhaps to say, that the paper referred to in this speech,\r\nis the document noticed in the last chapter, as having had such an\r\nimportant influence on the doings of the Commissioners, arresting\r\nthe current in which they were directed by their instructions, and\r\ndefeating the object which those instructions contemplated. The New\r\nYork Indians relied entirely upon this, as principal; and upon other\r\nminor written communications, which were afterwards sent to the Court,\r\nas occasion demanded--in consequence of which the speeches of their\r\nchiefs were few, and generally short--delivered for the purpose of\r\nexplanation, or in answer to inquiries.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Speech of the Menomenie chief, called_ “THE BRAVE,” _in answer to_\r\nMETOXEN.\r\n\r\n“Brothers: hear me. We give you this hand, to say, we are glad to see\r\nyou. You came from the rising sun. We thank the Great Spirit, who\r\nhas carried you safely over the big waters, and set you down in our\r\ncountry, the centre of the world. This hand is our welcome. Peace be\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, we wish you to say to our great father, that we love him,\r\nand that we will always do as he tells us. Does he live in a big house?\r\nWe shall be glad to go and see him. Tell him, if he will send us some\r\nmoney, and ask us, we will come. We should like him to send us some\r\ntobacco also. Tell him, we shake hands with him in our hearts.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, we are glad you are come to settle our disputes. We,\r\nMenomenies and Winnebagoes, have no learning, like our brothers here\r\nfrom the rising sun, (the New York Indians.) We cannot put our thoughts\r\non paper, like them. We ask, that you will let us have a man of\r\nlearning, and a friend to us, that he may read that paper, (the defence\r\nhanded in by the New York Indians) and tell us what it means--and that\r\nhe may give us advice how to act; for our brothers from the rising sun\r\nknow more than we do--they have deceived us. They have got more land,\r\nthan they ought to have--more than we ever sold them. We wish you\r\nto tell them how much they may have. Tell them what to give back to\r\nus--and we will sell it to our great father, and to our white brothers\r\nhere, who are our friends--and they will give us a fair price, and\r\nblankets, and tobacco. We like our white brothers here, and are willing\r\nto have them stay. They sell us what we want, and take our skins.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, may the Great Spirit keep you.\r\n\r\n“This is all.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe request made by this chief for learned counsel was granted by the\r\nCourt; and a gentleman, residing at Green Bay, who filled the office of\r\njudge in the District Court of the United States for that territory,\r\nwas the adviser of the Menomenies and Winnebagoes, through all the\r\nsessions of the Council and of the Commission;--and he prepared written\r\nanswers to all the written communications of the New York Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Speech of_ DANIEL BREAD, _a chief of the Oneidas, about thirty years\r\nold_.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, I have not much to say. I am glad, that your people and my\r\npeople have one religion. We worship the same Great Spirit--we love\r\nthe same Lord Jesus Christ, the Saviour of sinners. It was the white\r\nman, who brought us to know the true God--and how we may be saved. We\r\nare thankful. We thank the Great Spirit, who has kindly brought us\r\ntogether at this time. May he keep us in the right way, make us love\r\none another, and not let us do any thing wrong.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, what has been said by our brother, the Stockbridge chief,\r\nis true. I was glad to hear what he spoke. We have moreover told you\r\nall our thoughts in that paper. We wish you to consider what we have\r\nwritten--and to take it up to our great father, and to the chiefs of\r\nhis nation--that they may consider it, and restore our rights.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, I did not wish to speak. But it was desired, that one of\r\nmy tribe should say something. We are all made sorry--we are in great\r\ntrouble--we know not what to do. The white man is come upon us, and is\r\ntaking up our lands. We came here to be free from the white man. But he\r\nfollows us wherever we go. We are discouraged. The white man has broken\r\npeace between us and our brethren here in the North-West, and will not\r\nlet us come together again. We cannot do what we had wished to do--what\r\nour father, the President, promised us we might do. The white people\r\nare surrounding us again--they are getting our lands--they will not\r\nlet us have any influence over the native tribes--they fill the ears of\r\nour great father with wrong stories--and they have already threatened\r\nto drive us away.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, we were well off in the State of New York--as well as we\r\ncould be, while surrounded by whites. There we had good land, we raised\r\ncorn, learned the good ways of our white neighbours, had houses for\r\nour families, and a house of God. There we enjoyed the protection of\r\nthe laws. If the white man injured us, we told it to our great father,\r\n(the civil magistrate) who was near at hand, and could see and right\r\nthe wrong. But here the white man can do us any wrong, and there is\r\nno help for us. We came here, because we wished to be by ourselves,\r\nand to make a separate people of the Indians. Our father, President\r\nMonroe, promised, that his white children should never come after us.\r\nHe said, he had a desire to see us living by ourselves, in peace and\r\nprosperity--that it would be better for us to come out here, than to\r\nlive in the State of New York--and that he would always remember and\r\nprotect us by his great and strong arm. But, brothers, we remember it\r\nis written in your Bible, which is our Bible: ‘And there arose another\r\nking in the land, which knew not Joseph.’ We remember also, that Ahab\r\nwanted Naboth’s vineyard, and Naboth said: ‘The Lord forbid, that I\r\nshould resign the inheritance of my fathers.’ But _we_ did give up\r\nthe inheritance of _our_ fathers, for the sake of peace--because our\r\ngreat father said he wanted it for his white children. ‘Ahab said to\r\nNaboth: I will give thee for it a better vineyard.’ So said our father,\r\nthe President, to us--and he promised to defend it for us and for our\r\nchildren for ever. Now, we do not complain of the vineyard. It is\r\ngood enough. But Ahab wants this also; and we are more exposed to the\r\ncruelties and depredations of his people, than before we removed.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, we cannot move any more. Tell our great father, that our\r\nhearts are made very sorry by the conduct of his white children--and\r\nthat we have no peace.\r\n\r\n“This is all I have to say.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    _Speech of_ FOUR-LEGS, _head chief of the Winnebagoes_.--N.B. It\r\n    is not to be understood, that this man actually had as many legs,\r\n    as his name indicates. The fancy of the American Aborigines, in\r\n    the invention and application of names, especially to their\r\n    chiefs, is well known to be greatly exuberant, and not a little\r\n    removed from what the Europeans would call classical purity. All\r\n    that _Four-legs_ exhibited to the eye, to entitle him to this\r\n    name, was the suspension of a fox’s tail, from being attached to\r\n    the external of each of his knees; which played and dangled, as\r\n    he walked, making a show at least equal to, and altogether more\r\n    attractive than, the calf and ankle of his own leg. But to his\r\n    speech:--\r\n\r\n“Brothers, attend to my words. Thanks to the Great Spirit, who has\r\nkept us all till now. We are glad to shake hands with you. May we\r\nlong smoke the pipe of friendship. Before our chiefs went to see our\r\ngreat father, where is built the great council-house, we did not know\r\nthe great nation. And we once drew our short knives against the long\r\nknives--(long swords of the whites) we took the tomahawk and rifle--and\r\nwe said: We will have every scalp of them. But they were too many for\r\nus. And when our chiefs came back, and told us what they had seen, we\r\nsaid: we shall never dare to lift up our short knives against the long\r\nknives again. And so, we wish to live in peace.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, I have counted the trees of the forests all around the\r\nlake of my fathers; (Winnebago Lake, thirty miles long and fifteen\r\nbroad)--when the sun was asleep in the woods, I have looked up from\r\nthe door of my cabin, and counted the stars--but our chiefs told us,\r\nwhen they returned: You cannot count the white men! Brothers, we do not\r\nwish to fight the white men; we wish for peace. Our chiefs told us of\r\nyour big cabins, all put together in a great heap, so great, that one\r\nmust walk a whole journey to get round it. They told us of your big\r\ncanoes, with great wings, and how they let out the smoke and thunder\r\nfrom their sides. We were afraid at their story--and we wish for peace.\r\nOur chiefs told us of your warriors, how many they are, and how they\r\nall push together straight forward, and do not run and dodge like an\r\nIndian behind a tree. They told us of rifles, so big, that an Indian\r\ncould not put his arms around one--and that four horses must draw it on\r\nrollers--and that when it fires, it makes a great noise like thunder.\r\nIt makes the ground shake, and the clouds too. Brothers, we wish for\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n“I have no more to say.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is true, _Four-legs_ does not seem to speak much to the point under\r\ndiscussion. Nor is it to be inferred, that he was not a brave man,\r\nfrom the singular turn, which he happened to take in his speech. He is\r\nnotwithstanding (_was_--for he is dead now) a warrior of great fame.\r\nHe no doubt really desired peace, and was sufficiently convinced,\r\nfrom all he had heard, that his nation could never beat the whites.\r\nIt is but a few years since, however, that the Winnebagoes supposed\r\nthemselves the greatest and mightiest nation on earth; and their pride\r\nwas equal to their estimation of their own relative importance. But\r\n_Four-legs_, just at this time, seems to have been in the humour of\r\ncompliments;--and besides, he has been reckoned an arch politician, for\r\nan Indian. He might say one thing, and mean another.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _By_ JOHN METOXEN, _at the breaking up of the deliberations of\r\n    the Council_.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, I speak now both to my white and red brothers--to all who\r\nare here. I am an old man--and my spirit will soon be with the spirits\r\nof my fathers. I have been at the head of my people for many years.\r\nI have been anxious for them. When I came before them from New York\r\nto Green Bay, and told them to build their cabins at the _Grande\r\nKawkawlin_, I thought they would have peace, and that I should die in\r\npeace. But I see, that I must go down to the grave without comfort. It\r\nis not peace. All the doings of this Council show, that there is no\r\nrest for my people, who came here for rest.\r\n\r\n“I wish to say a word to the Winnebagoes and Menomenies. Brothers.\r\nIt is not good, that the white man has stood between us, and kept us\r\napart. Once we smoked in peace. We came from the rising sun, and asked\r\nyou to give us a home. We told you, there was no more home for us among\r\nthe graves of our fathers--because the white man had come there. You\r\ntook us by the hand, and said: We are glad to see you. Here is our\r\ncountry. Come and live among us. We said to you: Give us land that we\r\ncan call our own, and we will pay you for it. You did so. And we made a\r\ncovenant. We said: The white man shall never come here. And our great\r\nfather, the President, said: My white children shall never trouble you.\r\nWe lived in peace, till the white man came. He, brothers, has told you\r\nwrong stories. He has made you believe, what is not true. It is he that\r\nwants your land, and not we. We agreed, that we would keep him off. But\r\nhe has divided us; and now there is no more peace. He will get your\r\nland and ours, and then what will our children do?--Brothers, come back\r\nto us. Let us smoke the pipe again. We told you the ways of the white\r\nman, that he is a snake in the grass--that he will bite and destroy,\r\nwhen we don’t see--that he has great power--and that he will drive away\r\nthe Indians, and give their land to his own children. You now see, that\r\nour words are come to pass. The white man has come and set his foot and\r\nhis cabin on Fox River--and is getting more of our land every year.\r\nFirst, he spoke smooth words. Now he speaks rough words--because he has\r\ngot the power. Brothers, come back to us. We will be one people. We\r\nwill unite together against the white man, and pray our great father\r\nto take him away. And then we shall have peace, and no more trouble. I\r\ngive you the faith and love of our tribes. It is not rotten. It is good.\r\n\r\n“I speak again to my white brothers. You will not blame me, that I have\r\nspoken the truth. You have seen, brothers, since you came to Green Bay,\r\nthat what I have just told the Menomenies and Winnebagoes, is truth.\r\nWe have shewn you what promises were made to us by your great father\r\nand ours. You know it is truth. We make you witnesses this day--you\r\nshall witness to our great father and to his chiefs--you shall witness\r\nto God--that all we have said, is truth. We have been sorry, brothers,\r\nthat it was not in your power to do us justice. We thank you for your\r\ngood intentions. You say your instructions do not allow you to make the\r\ntreaties a rule of settlement. We left our lands in the East country,\r\nand came here on the understanding of those treaties. We have trusted\r\nentirely to the faith they have pledged to us. If _they_ cannot be\r\ndepended on, we know not what to trust. You offer to make a _new_\r\ntreaty in the name of our great father. Make the _old_ treaty good,\r\nbrothers, and then if there be any need, we shall have some reason to\r\ntrust in a _new_ one. Till then, we do not wish to make another. It is\r\nbetter to have none, brothers, if both parties will not keep them. We\r\nhave been deceived. It is not good. We do not wish to be deceived again.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, we have learnt one good thing from the white man: to trust\r\nin the white man’s God. We believe him to be the only God--and that\r\nhe is the God of all the tribes of men. We feel, that we have need to\r\ntrust in him now. We are injured; and I know not what new injuries\r\nawait the destiny of my people. I shall go down to the grave thinking\r\nonly of the words of King David’s son, which I have read in the book\r\npresented to my father’s father by your father’s father, from over the\r\nbig salt lake: ‘So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that\r\nare done under the sun. And behold the tears of such as were oppressed,\r\nand they had no comforter. And on the side of their oppressors there\r\nwas power--but _they_ had no comforter.’ God is witness of our old\r\nengagements--God is witness how they have been kept--and God will\r\nreward us, according to our deeds.\r\n\r\n“Brothers, I have done.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nFREE MASONRY AMONG THE INDIANS; MEDICINE DANCE; AND WAR DANCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I was walking one day in the camp of the Winnebagoes, I observed a\r\ngroup of Indians collected around one of the lodges, deeply absorbed\r\nin the performance of some strange and mysterious rites, apparently\r\nof a symbolical and religious nature. The _women_ were engaged in\r\nthem, as well as the men--and all in public. At one moment they would\r\nseem to be occupied in a sort of _hocus-pocus_ incantation, with the\r\ngreatest imaginable solemnity. In spite of my philosophy, I could\r\nbut sympathise with them. I verily stood waiting, from the degree of\r\nfaith and expectation which they manifested, to see some strange and\r\nmiraculous phenomena; spirits perhaps, coming up from the caldron\r\nthey appeared to be stirring. True, there was no caldron visible to\r\nthe vulgar--to us--no kettle of any fashion--no _material_ vessel\r\nof capacity;--but they were evidently and earnestly stirring up\r\nsomething over a fire. They formed a circle, men and women, with a\r\nsort of pudding-stick--_alias_ a witch’s or wizard’s rod;--and round\r\nand round they walked, with a gravity, at sight of which few would not\r\nhave felt solemn, each one stirring the caldron in turn, as he or she\r\ncame where it was--or _should_ be;--reciting at the same time some\r\nmysterious words. There was manifestly an expectation of some wondrous\r\nresult. They grew excited--they danced--they raved--and seemed to be\r\nthe subjects of involuntary and violent muscular spasms. They would\r\nstop suddenly, and lift up the head, like the dog that bays the moon;\r\nand mutter with a most inconceivable volubility a long prayer--or some\r\nother piece of religious exercise, I know not what, apparently of a\r\ndevotional character. This baying of the heavens, however, appeared to\r\nbe the exclusive office of certain distinguished individuals--priests\r\nmost likely. There was no miracle, after all. The ceremonies were\r\ndiversified, and pompous, and solemn.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” said I to a companion, who knew something of Indian\r\ncustoms. “Why,” said he, “it is _Free-masonry_;--and if you could stay\r\nlong enough to see the whole, you would be greatly amused.” “But do\r\nthe _women_ take a part?” “O yes--the Indians are farther advanced in\r\nFree-masonry, than civilized nations:--they have taken higher degrees.\r\nThe white masons, you know, are just _beginning_ to confer degrees upon\r\nwomen. But Indians have done it from time immemorial.” “But the society\r\nhere is open.” “Certainly. Secresy is all nonsense. There is no mystery\r\nin masonry, except in the higher degrees, in relation to the lower; and\r\nin all the degrees, in relation to the world. The white Free-masons\r\nhave found it convenient for _other_ purposes, to hold their meetings\r\nin conclave;--not for secresy. There is no secresy, except what results\r\nfrom physical necessity:--that a man cannot know what he has never\r\nlearned. Pretended secresy lends importance to that, which is supposed\r\nto be kept out of sight--awakens curiosity, and gives amazing advantage\r\nto nothing.” “Indeed? This is information.” “I am glad, if you are\r\nwiser for it.”\r\n\r\nOne cannot have been long among the Indians, and not have had his\r\nattention challenged by a DRUMMING in some quarter, from morning to\r\nnight, and from night to morning;--and sometimes for several successive\r\ndays, without intermission, except by very short intervals of repose.\r\nThe Indian drum is made exactly according to the philosophy of the\r\nmartial instrument of music, which bears this name in Europe. But if\r\nthe _beauty_ be brought into comparison--that is another thing. An\r\nold hollow trunk of a tree, cut into a section of two or three feet,\r\nwithout any other work, except what was first done by the hand of\r\nnature, and next by time, will answer all the purpose. One end may be\r\nplanted in the ground, if it is not convenient to put a head in it;\r\nthe other must be covered by a buck-skin, stretched over it, when wet,\r\nwith great pains and force, and fastened by strings and withes to pegs,\r\ndriven into the longitudinal parts of the trunk. By this description\r\nevery one will see, that the instrument combines all the philosophical\r\nprinciples of a drum. Whether the American Aborigines borrowed the\r\nsuggestion from Europeans, or the latter from the former; or whether\r\neach came by the discovery independent of the other--is of no\r\nimportance to our present purpose to settle. The American Indians have\r\nthe drum--that is certain; and if they wish to make it portable, they\r\ncontrive to fasten a hollow sounding cover of some sort on the other\r\nend;--perhaps nail on a thin board, when their arts, or trade will\r\nfurnish them with iron for nails. An empty keg, when the strong water\r\nhas all been drawn, (which does not take long) is often appropriated\r\nto this purpose. In which case one of the heads is permitted to remain,\r\nas a matter of economy, while the other is overdrawn, as aforesaid,\r\nby a buck-skin, in the highest degree of tension. But the use, that\r\nis more commonly made of the drum among the Indians, is by no means\r\nso pleasant, as this account of its construction. It is even sad and\r\nmelancholy in the highest degree.\r\n\r\nAnd is not the white man’s use of the same instrument sad? _He_ employs\r\nit to challenge the fiercest passions, to rouse and provoke the spirit\r\nof man to deeds of blood, to drown the cries of the wounded and dying,\r\nto sustain and urge on the heaviest encounter of brute force.\r\n\r\nNot so the Indian. He employs it to soothe and relieve the suffering,\r\nand to rescue the dying from the grave. He makes it a medicine of the\r\nsoul, and of the body. When all the other powers of the healing art\r\nhave failed, and the patient still declines, the Indian last resort\r\nis to the magic influence of the drum and dance. All the family and\r\nnear relatives gather in a crowd around the suffering victim; the\r\nnearest relative, a mother, or father, a husband or wife, or the\r\neldest child--more commonly a female, when it is convenient--as the\r\ntender sex are more susceptible of grief--begins to weep, and sob,\r\nand moan aloud, often howling, with expressions of heart-appealing\r\nanguish;--the drum sets up its melancholy beat to a dancing gig;--the\r\nentire circle parade and move round in solemn order, time-keeping to\r\nthe summons;--the chief mourner sobs and howls;--and round they dance,\r\nmuttering prayers hour after hour, and day after day, till they have\r\ndrummed and danced and howled the wretched victim into the arms of\r\ndeath. In this extremity all other means, all other medicine, and\r\nthe common sustenance of nature are perhaps scrupulously withholden.\r\nEvery thing now depends on the miraculous influence of the charm. The\r\nrelatives must have faith;--the patient must have faith;--all depends\r\non faith. If the patient be an infant, the anxious and agonized mother\r\nwill every now and then catch it up in her arms, and dance around the\r\ncircle, weeping and sadly moaning. If the patient be an adult, and have\r\nsufficient strength, it is deemed of great importance, that he or she\r\nshould rise, as often as they are able, and join the dance; and when\r\nstrength fails, the patient is supported by the arms of relatives.\r\nWhen he is entirely exhausted, he is borne along the dance perfectly\r\npassive; and gradually as he languishes, the enthusiasm and anxiety\r\nrise to a higher pitch; the drum sounds with more earnest beat;\r\nthe contagion of sobbing and moaning spreads and becomes universal;\r\nthe circle is enlarged by an accession of friends and neighbours,\r\nwho soon catch the sad spirit of the occasion; the noise and tumult\r\naggravate to a storm; and as might be expected, the patient sinks and\r\nexpires, under the overwhelming weight of this furious tempest of\r\nlugubrious passion. And this is called the _Medicine-dance_. Rarely,\r\nthe strength of the patient’s constitution braves the assault, and he\r\nrises and lives notwithstanding. And these instances of recovery prove\r\nto a demonstration, in the philosophy of the Indians, the miraculous\r\nefficacy of the means.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet a use of the drum among the Indians, of a truly\r\n_martial_ character--and that is in the _War-dance_. Whenever a tribe\r\nhas reasons for waging war, either in self-defence, or to avenge\r\ninjuries, having deliberated and resolved upon the enterprise, in\r\na grave and solemn public council, the occasion and ceremonies of\r\nenlisting and mustering their warriors, are of a character most\r\nfearfully interesting and barbarous. For the entertainment of the\r\nCommissioners and strangers, and other spectators of the Council, which\r\nhad been engaged in its deliberations at Green Bay, and while the\r\nsittings of the Council were open, we had two specimens of the Indian\r\n_war_-dance, at the intervals of recess from public business:--one by\r\nthe Winnebagoes, and the second by the rival efforts of the two tribes.\r\nAs the night is the most appropriate and most awful, by the imposing\r\ncharacter of its own natural solemnity; and as according best with the\r\ndark designs of savage vengeance; the exhibitions were made to begin\r\nat the approach of the evening shades, and obtained their height of\r\ninterest, when all that is most grand and awful in midnight scenery\r\noverspread the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe Menomenies and Winnebagoes are two powerful and rival nations,\r\namong the tribes of the North-West, and extremely jealous of each\r\nother. The Convention necessarily brought their chiefs and warriors and\r\ncommon people into near and intimate contact. They very prudently and\r\nnaturally, however, made the river a division line between them, in\r\nsetting up their encampments:--the Menomenies occupying the north bank,\r\nand the Winnebagoes the south. But every day, by the constant passing\r\nand repassing of such a public and promiscuous assemblage, the people\r\nof the two tribes were brought side by side, and without interruption\r\ncrossed each other’s tracks. The mutual animosities and jealousies,\r\nwhich a few years ago were manifested between the English and French;\r\nwhich barred the common courtesies of life in their relations to each\r\nother, and disposed them to construe the slightest inadvertence into\r\nan insult--were not unlike the state of feeling, which characterised\r\nthe intercourse of the Winnebagoes and Menomenies. This uncomfortable\r\ntemper was very much awakened into active energy by the precedence,\r\nwhich the Winnebagoes obtained in attracting the attention of the\r\nCommissioners and other visitors, in the way of affording them\r\namusement;--partly, because the encampment of the Winnebagoes happened\r\nto be on the same side of the river with the public lodgings for\r\nstrangers; and partly because the Winnebagoes themselves were strangers\r\nat the Bay, and were in many respects of their history and manners\r\nmore remarkable. The Winnebagoes by themselves got up a war-dance\r\nfor the amusement of the whites;--and the sport went off so well,\r\nthat the Menomenies resolved they would not be outdone in a feat of\r\nthis kind. Accordingly on the next day after the first exhibition,\r\ngreat preparations were observed to be making on both sides for a\r\n_rival_ war-dance. And the motives of emulation were so powerful,\r\nthe excitement of national pride so great, there could be no doubt,\r\nthat an acting off of this terrific scene was about to be displayed,\r\nin the highest style, and under the most striking and impressive\r\nrepresentations.\r\n\r\nThe Winnebagoes are a proud, high-bearing race, exhibiting more of the\r\nnative wildness and savage independence of the Indian character, than\r\nany nation around them;--looking down with perfect contempt on all\r\nother tribes, especially upon their neighbours, the Menomenies. While\r\nthe Menomenies on the present occasion were by far the most numerous,\r\nand exhibiting themselves under the special excitement of the fresh\r\nreturn of a war-party from the Mississippi, who, in alliance with the\r\nSioux, had that summer been waging war with the Saukes and Foxes, and\r\nbrought into the camp of their tribe at Green Bay some scalps of their\r\nenemies, as the trophies of their recent victories.\r\n\r\nOne of the accompaniments of the war-dance is music--or what the\r\nIndians _call_ music--instrumental and vocal. And although Indians,\r\nwhen civilized and cultivated, are found to have the most melodious\r\nvoices, of all human kind, and to be the most passionate lovers of\r\nharmony; yet in their savage condition, the character of their music is\r\nin perfect keeping with their hearts: wild, discordant, and harsh. I,\r\nhowever, noticed one instrument among them, the structure and tones of\r\nwhich are not unlike the flagelet, adapted to the softer passions, and\r\ndesigned no doubt for quiet, domestic scenes;--the music of which is\r\nequally plaintive and touching, as any thing I remember to have heard.\r\nAs I saw it only in the hands of young men, I am disposed to believe,\r\nthat it is appropriated by the lover to move and subdue the heart of\r\nthe maid, the return of whose tender regard he desires and solicits.\r\nA nice observation, however, soon detects the total want of regular\r\nintervals in this instrument. It is better fitted for the melody of\r\ndistinct notes, than for scientific performances. And this, doubtless,\r\nis quite sufficient for his purpose. A wild melody, in such a state of\r\nsociety, may be supposed more effectual, than scientific harmonies.\r\n\r\nBut the war-dance would seem to demand a kind of music, making the\r\nstrongest appeals to the ruder passions of so rude a race. The most\r\nprominent instrument is the _drum_, the construction of which, out of\r\nan old cast-by-keg, or hollow trunk of a tree, I have already noticed.\r\nFor the present occasion the Winnebagoes, as I had occasion to observe,\r\ntook the keg, knocked out one of the heads, stopped the bung-hole, put\r\na little water in the bottom, (the philosophical use of the water\r\nI am ignorant of) and stretched a wet-deer skin over the other end,\r\nattached to pegs rudely drove into the sides, and as rudely twisted by\r\nthe rudest sticks;--the sticks making so many levers, the fulcrum of\r\nwhich was the attachment to the skin, and the power of tension resting\r\nin the forementioned pegs; under which one extremity of each was\r\nforcibly brought. I stood for a long time to witness the progress of\r\nthe simple art, by which this instrument was constructed. And verily,\r\nto see half a dozen men, gravely and passionately employed in such a\r\npiece of work, and stretching their wits to make it perfect, showing\r\nall the simplicity of so many children of two and three years old, and\r\nequally absorbed, as such children in their simplest inventions--was\r\nhumiliating and affecting. But to see those very men in a war-dance\r\nin the evening, was a far different spectacle. When the instrument,\r\nafter so much pains, was supposed to be perfect, one drew his knife\r\nfrom its scabbard by his side, and from a knotty-green stick, which\r\nhappened to lie under his hand, in two or three minutes, whittled out\r\nthe only drum-stick, about eight inches long, which was necessary for\r\nthe service; and then applying it to the drum, struck up the customary\r\nbeat. Instantly every countenance of the anxious and expectant group\r\nlighted up with joy, and a sudden and clamorous shout of applause,\r\nmingled with the sounds of the drum, told most emphatically, that\r\ntheir whole heart was satisfied, and that the instrument was perfect.\r\nThe sound of it is very like the common bass drum, and is constructed\r\nupon the same principles. It is the beating of this, which regulates\r\nin time all the movements of the dance. The quickness of the movement\r\nis perhaps somewhat more brisk, than that commonly displayed in the\r\ndancing assemblies of the whites. As for the gracefulness of the actors\r\nin the scene, I will say nothing. Their motions are so peculiar, that\r\nI must despair of describing them. It is rather a jump, than a trip.\r\nIt is not like the light, and sprightly, and joyous dance of buoyant\r\nspirits, half the time ’twixt heaven and earth;--the feet are scarcely\r\nseen to rise above the ground--yet the body, by rising a little from\r\na stooping posture, seems to perform a sort of leap; while both feet\r\nmove almost simultaneously, pressing the earth again with such power\r\nof the superincumbent weight and muscular exertion of the whole frame,\r\nas to make the ground tremble at every step. A single Indian will make\r\nthe ground vibrate--;a troop of them will produce an effect like the\r\nearthquake. It is the determination and tremendous character of their\r\nmovements, which develope the passion of their souls.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the band of a war-dance is a stentorian vociferator, who\r\nseems to take his key-note, by rubbing a long notched wood pole, with\r\nanother piece of wood;--that is, by this most unharmonious grating, not\r\nof sounding metals, but of _un_-sounding wood, he strikes up a most\r\nunharmonious effort of his lungs. Then by great muscular exertion of\r\nhis whole system, inflating his lungs by a kind of convulsive gasp, he\r\ngives a token; and the band and dancers all begin--drumming, singing,\r\nshouting, yelling, dingling of metallic rods, and what not;--at one\r\ntime all running together a sort of chant, in a low bass monotony; then\r\nsuddenly passing a wide discreet interval, into a sharp falsette, or\r\nscream, which makes the Indian yell; or what is more commonly called\r\nthe _war-whoop_. No one could believe, did not his eye and ear together\r\ncertify him, that the two kinds of voice proceed from the same beings.\r\nThe Indian war-whoop is a sharp, piercing falsette, as elevated as\r\nthe sharpest scream of a woman in a fright, broken and trilled, or\r\nmade tremulous, by the mechanical play of the finger on the lips. This\r\n_whoop_ is repeated by all the dancers every two, or three minutes,\r\nand seems to be a kind of letting off, or explosion of the highest\r\npossible degree of excitement. It is startling and frightful beyond\r\ndescription, breaking, as it does, unexpectedly from a multitude of\r\nvoices. Even when one has heard it a thousand times in succession, and\r\nin the same dance, it always comes unexpected. The transition of voice\r\nis so sudden and violent, so characteristically diverse from the low\r\nand monotonous movement, which precedes and follows; so _unearthly_; so\r\nlike the ideal conception of the sudden breaking loose of hell itself\r\nin triumph--that one involuntarily trembles with fear and shudders with\r\nhorror.\r\n\r\nAnd the other accompaniments of this scene: the naked savage, painted\r\nin the most horrible forms, with a crown of feathers bristling from\r\nhis head; his eye and every feature mad with rage, and dark as hell;\r\nwielding and brandishing in his hand the weapons of death; his body in\r\nperpetual and simultaneous movement, with the music of the band and\r\nof his own voice, together “grating harsh thunder;”--himself at the\r\nsame time inclined, half-bent, like a man oppressed by a heavy burden,\r\ndarting with his naked and uplifted weapons in closest contact with\r\na multitude of others, all accoutred like himself, and like himself\r\nperforming the same wild and indescribable evolutions; sometimes like\r\nlightning, and then more circumspectly. A spectator of such a scene\r\nfears every moment, that in their apparent and wild intoxication, they\r\nwill wound, or kill each other, by running against the naked weapons,\r\nto which they are exposed in their sudden turnings and violent leaps;\r\nand while absorbed in this anxiety, or some other feeling they have\r\nexcited, they suddenly break into their horrid yell, resembling what\r\none would imagine to be the laughing triumph of fiends, mingled with\r\nthe screams of the agonized sufferers they have got in their power.\r\nThen again immediately resuming their low and monotonous chant, and the\r\nwild fierce dance, they work up their own passions, and the interest\r\nof spectators to the highest possible pitch, till, with a surprise as\r\ngreat as ever, their horrid yell bursts again upon the ear, and all for\r\na moment is still as death. And so with the introduction of a thousand\r\nsuccessive novelties of a like startling character, and often inspiring\r\nthe beholder with absolute horror, they continue for hours, and for a\r\nwhole night. And if such are the exhibitions of mere sport, what must\r\nthey be, when the scene is enacted in earnest, and in preparation for\r\nactual war!\r\n\r\nOne part of the war-dance, which may properly be called _beating\r\nfor recruits_, (and such indeed is its whole character and grand\r\nintention) is peculiarly significant and impressive. A small group,\r\nor band of _challengers_, as they might be termed, who are also the\r\nprincipal musicians for the occasion, take their seats, squatted in\r\nclose contact on the margin of an open space, left vacant for the\r\ndance;--or for those who may successively obey the call of their tribe\r\nto arms. A rifle, tomahawk, or some other weapon of war, is laid upon\r\nthe ground, in this open space, as a gauntlet, itself challenging the\r\nsurrounding warriors to come and take it up; and the act of grasping\r\nand lifting this weapon, is the act of enlistment. All things being\r\nprepared, and the warriors in attendance, the group upon the ground,\r\nhaving received the token from the leader, standing by, strike up the\r\nwar-song with their voice and instruments, the language and appeal of\r\nwhich is: ‘Do you see that weapon? Do you understand it, warriors?--Who\r\nwill take it up?’--And the challengers grow more and more impassioned\r\nand violent, if there is any hesitation, until some warrior from\r\nthe crowd, steps out into the vacant space, and begins to dance,\r\ntime-keeping with the drum, with his eye fixed upon the gauntlet, but\r\nreluctant, refusing to take it up. The band aggravate their din and\r\nclamour, to urge him to the decisive action. Still he looks upon the\r\nweapon, dances round it, points to it with his finger, and performs\r\ninnumerable and most extravagant feats of jumping and significant\r\ngesticulations; and still the challengers urge him on. He seems to be\r\nrevolving the possible results of the war to himself, to his family\r\nand friends, and counts the cost in every shape;--and then imagines\r\nhe hears the call of his nation to arms. He comes yet nearer to the\r\nweapon, and then springs back, as if frightened at the consequences\r\nof taking it up. The challengers rebuke him for his indecision. Again\r\nhe approaches the weapon, and dances round it, and round it, extends\r\nhis hand as if to take it up, and then starts back at some sudden and\r\nforbidding thought. Louder still, and still more earnest, the beating\r\nrolls; and the voices of the band and all their instruments grow more\r\nclamorous and deafening; every few moments raising the war-whoop.\r\nLike as the bird, spell-bound and charmed by a serpent, flutters and\r\ncircles in the air, struggling in vain to escape, and drawing nearer\r\nand nearer to the object of her dread--at last makes a sudden and\r\ndesperate plunge;--so he springs upon the weapon of death, grasps it\r\nfirmly in his hand, and lifts himself erect. Then in an instant shouts\r\nof exultation rend the air, from all the assembled multitude--and\r\nhis name and hand are now pledged. Next, with the weapon in hand, and\r\nstill dancing to the music, he performs successively, and with all his\r\ncharacteristic cunning, the various feats of discovering, shooting, and\r\nscalping an enemy. This done, he replaces the weapon where he took it\r\nup, takes his seat with the challenging group, till the same round has\r\nadded another to their number, and another;--and so they fill the ranks\r\nfor war.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these sports of the Winnebagoes, and while at the\r\nhighest pitch of their interest; the scene of which was laid on the\r\nsouth bank of the river, and directly before the door of the inn,\r\nwhere the Commissioners and strangers lodged;--sports, which to us\r\nhad already grown sufficiently grave, not to say frightful;--while\r\nthe shades of the evening began to impart to them a character still\r\nmore impressive, and no small crowd of white men and the natives were\r\nhanging over the exhibition, wrapped in the intensest interest;--in\r\nan instant, and with a suddenness as startling, as the explosion of\r\nheaven’s artillery, a tremendous _war-whoop_ rent the air from behind\r\nus;--and as soon as the thunder follows the flash which wakens it,\r\na horde of savage warriors, in their most hideous forms, and all\r\naccoutred in their weapons of death, pounced into the midst of the\r\nthrong, driving the Winnebagoes from their dancing arena, and occupied\r\nit themselves. Did ye ever see a flock of sheep scatter and fly before\r\nthe sudden rush of a merciless crew of dogs upon them? That is the\r\npicture of the scampering of this gazing and motley throng. Even the\r\nCommissioners lost their dignity and self-possession, and were no less\r\nanxious to save their lives, than the meanest fellow in the crowd. All\r\nrun--as well they might--for nothing could have been more astounding.\r\nAs nobody, however, found himself tomahawked, in the first onset, a\r\ngreater portion of the flying herd turned to look again, and see what\r\nthis might be. Among the rest I turned;--and a strange and ominous\r\nspectacle presented. The Winnebagoes looked in sullen silence on these\r\nintruders, far outnumbering themselves, and presenting altogether a\r\nmore hideous aspect; the intruders looked on them; and never did two\r\narmies of wild beasts, of diverse, but ferocious character, meet and\r\nlook each other in the face, with more dubious intent.\r\n\r\n_Four-legs_, the chief of the Winnebagoes, who had made a rare figure\r\na day or two before, as an orator, in the Council; and who seemed\r\non that occasion to be for peace, was destined to act a different\r\npart in the present juncture. With all the pride and dignity of the\r\nhead man of his nation, he had stood wrapped in his blanket, looking\r\nwith infinite satisfaction on the feats of his warriors, as they\r\nenlisted one after another, obeying the challenge, and taking up the\r\ngauntlet, to show the white man, how the Indians do such things. His\r\nsquaw (wife) stood by his side, enjoying the scene. A long spear, or\r\njavelin, rested on the ground at his feet, running up under his folded\r\narms, and lifting its burnished blade above his head; while one hand\r\ngrasped the hilt of a broad-sword;--both of which weapons had been\r\nsent him by his great father from Washington;--and which he always\r\ncarried, and was proud to show. It was not deemed consistent with his\r\nimportance to join his warriors in the exercises of this occasion. He\r\nonly presided, and smiled his approbation at their excellent doings.\r\nBut when this outrageous insult was offered to himself and his tribe,\r\nhis brow gathered darkness, he threw his blanket from his shoulders,\r\nand stepping before this ferocious band of intruders, with an aspect\r\nand determination, not to be mistaken, he delivered a short, but far\r\ndifferent oration from that which he uttered before the Commissioners.\r\nI understood it to be, in substance, as follows:--\r\n\r\n“Miscreants! I am chief of the Winnebagoes. If my warriors had done\r\nthis deed, I would have pierced their hearts with this javelin, and cut\r\nthem in pieces with this sword, and given their flesh to the dogs! Your\r\ntribe know the strength of this arm, and the courage of my warriors. Be\r\ngone!--and await the vengeance I shall give you!”\r\n\r\nAnd as he pointed the way with his spear, the Menomenies sullenly\r\nretired, just without the circle, which had been occupied by the\r\nWinnebagoes, and commenced _their_ war-dance, in defiance of the\r\nthreats of the Winnebago chief. The Menomenie warriors had been engaged\r\nin the same ceremonies on the opposite side of the river;--but not\r\nhaving being able to attract a satisfactory amount of attention, and\r\nperceiving that the Winnebagoes were getting all the praise, they had\r\nresolved upon the stratagem of crossing the stream below, under cover\r\nof the evening, and making this surprise; and a most effectual surprise\r\nindeed it was. Nor did it end here.\r\n\r\nThe war-dance of the Menomenies proceeded simultaneously with that of\r\nthe Winnebagoes, so near, that one group almost interfered with the\r\nmovements of the other. It was verily a rival exhibition of a grave\r\nand portentous character. As the Menomenies were more numerous, and\r\nhad taken special pains in their preparations, they really made the\r\ngreatest and most attractive show. The wrath of _Four-legs_ was kindled\r\nwithin him. He threw his javelin upon the ground, and stepped forth\r\nupon the arena, as was well understood, for this particular juncture.\r\nHe fixed his eye upon his weapon; then looked round upon his warriors;\r\nthen pointed to the Menomenies, who had dared to insult them; then\r\ndisplayed the symbols of his chieftainship about his person, and shook\r\nthe fox-tails, which hung from his knees, by putting his right hand to\r\none and his left to the other. And this done, to prove his importance,\r\nhe commenced a wild and frantic dance with a muscular energy, which\r\nmade the ground tremble beneath his feet; approached his javelin and\r\nretreated in the usual forms, and with many others peculiar to himself;\r\nkeeping time with the beat of the drum, and animated by the clamorous\r\nappeals of his warriors, as they shouted and _whooped_. By and by, as\r\nhis passions were wrought to the highest pitch, he plunged and seized\r\nthe javelin with a mad and convulsive grasp, darted like lightning\r\ninto the midst of the Menomenies, and instantly returned, leading\r\ntwo of their warrior chiefs captive, and presented them in triumph\r\nbefore his own. It was an unexpected and resistless feat, and big\r\nwith portentous meaning. The Menomenies were compelled to one of two\r\nalternatives:--either to suffer it as an atonement for their insult,\r\nor quarrel on the instant. And for a few moments there was an awful\r\npause;--and by the significant and angry murmurs, which passed between\r\nthe parties, it seemed doubtful which way it would turn. The prisoners\r\nhowever, at last affected to take it in sport, submitted to a brief\r\ndetention, and were then dismissed. I was told, that more trifling\r\nincidents than this have bred Indian wars.\r\n\r\nTruly I and many others were glad, when this affair was over. It gave\r\nto the sports of the evening a most grave and serious aspect; and all\r\nexpected a quarrel during the night. Till morning came again, the whole\r\nregion rung with the most frightful savage yells;--yells, which, begun\r\nfor amusement, threatened to end in blood. So untamed, fierce, and\r\nungovernable are the passions of these wild children of the forest.\r\nBut especially was it a perilous night, in consequence of the previous\r\nand generous distribution of strong drink, dealt out by those, who\r\nhad instigated the exhibition. An Indian, mad with liquor and passion\r\ncombined, is of all beings the most uncertain and dangerous. I do not\r\nfor myself desire to witness the renewal of such a scene.\r\n\r\nThe amazing power of _pantomime_ was most wonderfully displayed in all\r\nthese exhibitions of the war-dance. For all the interpretations here\r\ngiven, I am indebted alone to the intelligible and indubitable language\r\nof this art. To satisfy myself of their correctness, I made particular\r\ninquiry of those who understood the meaning of these customs.\r\n\r\nThe following poetic description of a war-dance may be pertinent here:--\r\n\r\n        “A hundred warriors now advance,\r\n        All dress’d and painted for the dance,\r\n        And sounding club and hollow skin\r\n        A slow and measur’d time begin;\r\n        With rigid limb and sliding foot,\r\n        And murmurs low the time to suit;\r\n        For ever varying with the sound,\r\n        The circling band moves round and round.\r\n        Now slowly rise the swelling notes,\r\n        When every crest more lively floats;\r\n        Now toss’d on high with gesture proud,\r\n        Then lowly ’mid the circle bow’d;\r\n        While clanging arms grow louder still,\r\n        And ev’ry voice becomes more shrill,\r\n        Till fierce and strong the clamour grows,\r\n        And the wild _war-whoop_ bids it close.\r\n        Then starts Skunktonga forth, whose band\r\n        Came far from Huron’s storm-beat strand,\r\n        And thus recounts his battle feats,\r\n        While his dark club the measure beats.”\r\n\r\n        _Poem of Ontwa._\r\n\r\nWhile writing these pages I have received the following account of\r\na war dance among the Osages in the Arkansas Territory, west of\r\nthe Mississippi, and some 1500 or 2000 miles distant from the scene\r\nalready presented; communicated by a gentleman, who witnessed what he\r\ndescribes, and long known to me by reputation, though not personally.\r\nIt is especially interesting, as it was an earnest preparation for\r\nactual war, and not an exhibition for amusement. The likeness will be\r\nsufficiently apparent, as having the common characteristics of the\r\nAmerican war-dance; although the Osages and the North-West tribes are\r\ntoo distant, to be in habits of communication with each other. The\r\nletter is dated the 25th of July, 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRACT:\r\n\r\n“In our late tour through the Osage villages, we fell on the Little\r\nOsage town, when it was all alive with a _war-dance_. The warriors, or\r\nbraves, fitted out in their wild, fantastic style, were all assembled.\r\nAs we approached, a runner met us, and asked of our interpreter\r\nour business, but did not offer us his hand. This was not owing to\r\nill-will, but to custom. Their war-dances are their most sacred\r\nseasons. During the ceremony, they separate themselves from the touch\r\nof the vulgar and the profane. Being told our business, he run back\r\nand reported; and our approach seemed to cause neither derangement,\r\nnor suspension. We eagerly rode up to the scene of action; getting our\r\nhorses as near as we could, although they were frightened by the music,\r\nthe feathers, shields, and the star-spangled banner of the United\r\nStates, fluttering in the wind.[15]\r\n\r\n“The position in which we found these warriors, was that of a large\r\nring, one circle standing, and another squatting, and all facing\r\ntowards the centre of the circle. Well, what does this mean? What next?\r\nSooner than thought could fancy an answer, one of the circle partly\r\nrises with his shield in one hand and tomahawk in the other, and dances\r\ntowards the centre--first facing this, and then that way, holding his\r\nshield first on this, then on that side, and then occasionally making\r\na brandish with his tomahawk--as though he were saying: ‘See, my\r\ncomrades in arms--see how I will defend myself with this hand and this\r\nshield, while with _this_ I will level my foe.’ Having proceeded to the\r\ncentre, he returned and squatted in his place. Another then performed\r\na similar feat, and then another, till all had given a specimen, by way\r\nof anticipation and sample of their approaching conflict and expected\r\nvictory. Meantime the hoarse hollow sounding criers, who appeared to be\r\nalready exhausted by constantly overstraining their voices, in their\r\nzeal to make those hear, who stood only a very short distance--stood\r\nyelling, with their hands bracing their empty stomachs, and exciting\r\nthe warriors to bloody deeds. One, perhaps, had lost a wife, another a\r\nchild, or they represented those who had lost them, and now they were\r\ninspiring these pledged warriors to be courageous, and bring home a\r\nscalp, and so avenge their loss.\r\n\r\n“There was much variety in the costume of these Indians. Some wore\r\nthe skins of white wolves, a large species found at the west in their\r\nhunting excursions--which hang down behind, with the face, eyes, and\r\nnose of the animal shooting above the head of the wearer. Others wore\r\nravens’ beaks, or eagles’ claws--and all exhibited from their persons\r\nsome terrific emblem. One wore a snake’s skin, suspended from his\r\nneck, and reaching to the ground. I said to him: ‘What a serpent!’ He\r\nanswered by snapping at me so sharply, as to startle me. This proved\r\nquite amusing to his comrades. All were entirely naked, except the\r\nusual flap, and their bodies were painted black--black as the sooty\r\nAfrican. Of all the human beings I ever saw, none approached so near my\r\nidea of devils.\r\n\r\n“Much of the ceremony consisted in a sort of dancing march round the\r\nstreets of the village, between their lodges. Their dancing has nothing\r\nto do with the light trip of the foot. It is properly a pounding of\r\nthe earth with both feet at once. As they passed us, it seemed as if a\r\nlittle _earthquake_ was passing by. The Osages, and I think all other\r\nIndians whom I have seen, in their dances, strike the earth with both\r\nfeet simultaneously, jumping along with their bodies bent, their faces\r\nfirst turned this way and then that, first looking askance under one\r\narm, and then turning a wild vacant look over the other shoulder: and\r\nall the while brandishing shields, tomahawks, &c.\r\n\r\n“In their marching round the settlement, the warriors were followed by\r\na band of musicians, some rattling the gourd shell, some drumming on\r\na piece of deer skin, _stretched over the head of a keg_, and others\r\nsinging their wild songs. Among the retinue I observed a great many\r\nyouths, who appeared to be young disciples, catching the spirit of\r\ntheir seniors and fathers. Another group followed, who appeared to be\r\nmourners, crying for vengeance on their enemies, to reward them for the\r\ndeath of some relative.\r\n\r\n“So busily employed were these warriors, that the ceremony ceased only\r\nfor a small part of the night. Early the next morning, before it was\r\nyet day, we heard their music and singing, and their stamping up and\r\ndown the streets. Our stay among them was about twenty-four hours.\r\nWhen we arrived we found them engaged in the ceremony, and when we\r\nleft they had not finished. It is attended with extreme fasting--for\r\ntheir custom forbids them to eat before the sun sets. And I believe\r\nthey often fast, eating only once a day, till the war is concluded, and\r\nthey return home with their scalps victorious. They are not allowed\r\nmoreover to eat with their families; they must sleep separately, must\r\ngo naked, the flap excepted; offer many prayers, and as the climax of\r\nall, _sacrifice a dog_. In this last ceremony they were engaged, as we\r\nleft the village,--for we saw two or three warriors most ceremoniously\r\nwashing the parts of the victim at a stream, which we had to pass.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nSPECIMENS OF INDIAN SPEECHES OF FORMER TIMES, WITH ANECDOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe speeches and anecdotes of this chapter are introduced, not so much\r\nbecause they have an immediate connexion with the main design of this\r\nwork, as because they are interesting relics of Indian oratory of\r\nearlier times, and specimens of their primitive heroism and nobleness\r\nof character. They are inserted, as nearly as I can ascertain, in the\r\norder of time, decreasing in interest, and seeming to prove, in some\r\nrespects, a degeneracy of the race in consequence of their contact with\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\nThe following is the harangue of a sachem, or chief, who wished to\r\nexcite his warriors to revenge the spoliations of the grave of his\r\nmother, when he pretended, that the first settlers of the Plymouth\r\ncolony had stolen the skins and defaced the monuments, piously\r\ndeposited and set round his parent’s tomb. I do not remember at this\r\nmoment from what authority I made the extract. It must be allowed to be\r\na masterly appeal to a savage race:--\r\n\r\n“When last the glorious light of the sky was underneath this globe, and\r\nbirds grew silent, I began to settle, as my custom is, to take repose.\r\nBefore mine eyes were fast closed, methought I saw a vision, at which\r\nmy spirit was much troubled, and, trembling at that doleful sight, a\r\nspirit cried aloud:--‘Behold, my son, whom I have cherished; see the\r\nbreasts, that gave thee suck--the hand that wrapped thee warm, and\r\nfed thee oft! Canst thou forget to take revenge of those wild people,\r\nwho have defaced my monument in a despiteful manner, disdaining our\r\nantiquities and honourable customs? See now, the sachem’s mother’s\r\ngrave lies like the common people, defaced by an ignoble race! Thy\r\nmother doth complain, and implores thy aid against this thievish\r\npeople, who have newly intruded in our land. If this be suffered, I\r\nshall not rest quiet in my everlasting habitation.’ This said, the\r\nspirit vanished, and I all in a sweat not able scarce to speak, began\r\nto get some strength, and recollect my spirits, that were fled; and\r\ndetermined to demand your counsel, and solicit your assistance.”\r\n\r\nThe two following brief speeches I cannot date. The first is affecting;\r\nthe second, from _Adair_, is highly rhetorical;--and so indeed is the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“We are driven back,” said an old warrior, “until we can retreat no\r\nfurther. Our hatchets are broken; our bows are snapped; our fires are\r\nnearly extinguished; a little longer, and the white man will cease to\r\npersecute us:--for we shall cease to exist.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Speech of an Indian Captain to his Warriors, by_ ADAIR.\r\n\r\n“Your chief knew, that your guns were burning in your hands; that your\r\ntomahawks were thirsting for the blood of your enemies; that your\r\ntrusty arrows were impatient to be on the wing; and lest delay should\r\nburn your hearts any longer, I say: _Join the holy ark_; and away to\r\ncut off your devoted enemies.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“In the spring of 1774,” says Thatcher’s Indian Biography, referring\r\nto Jefferson’s Notes on Virginia, “a robbery and murder occurred in\r\nsome of the white settlements on the Ohio, which were charged to the\r\nIndians, though perhaps not justly; for it is well known, that a large\r\nnumber of civilized (?) adventurers were traversing the frontiers at\r\nthis time, who sometimes disguised themselves as Indians, and who\r\nthought little more of killing one of that people (the Indians) than\r\nshooting a buffalo. A party of these men, land-jobbers and others,\r\nundertook to punish the outrage in this case, according to their\r\ncustom, as Mr. Jefferson expresses it, ‘in a summary way.’\r\n\r\n“Colonel Cresap, a man infamous for the many murders he had committed\r\non that much-injured people, collected a party, and proceeded down\r\nthe Kanawa in quest of vengeance. Unfortunately a canoe of women and\r\nchildren, with one man only, was seen coming from the opposite shore,\r\nunarmed, and not at all suspecting an attack from the whites. Cresap\r\nand his party concealed themselves on the bank of the river, and the\r\nmoment the canoe reached the shore, singled out their objects, and at\r\none fire killed every person in it. This happened to be the family of\r\n_Logan_.\r\n\r\n“It was not long after this, that another massacre took place, under\r\nstill more aggravated circumstances, not far from the present site\r\nof Wheeling, Virginia--a large party of Indians being decoyed by the\r\nwhites, and all murdered with the exception of a little girl. Among\r\nthese too were a brother and sister of Logan; and the delicate\r\nsituation of the latter increased a thousand-fold both the barbarity of\r\nthe crime and the rage of the survivors of the family.\r\n\r\n“The vengeance of the chieftain was indeed provoked beyond endurance;\r\nand he accordingly distinguished himself in the daring and bloody war\r\nthat ensued.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen peace was made, in 1775, Logan sent the following speech to Lord\r\nDunmore, by the hand of a messenger, but would not condescend to appear\r\nin person:--\r\n\r\n\r\n_Speech of_ LOGAN, _to_ LORD DUNMORE, _in 1775_.\r\n\r\n“I appeal to any white man to say, if he ever entered Logan’s cabin\r\nhungry, and he gave him no meat; if he ever came cold and naked, and\r\nLogan clothed him not. During the course of the last long and bloody\r\nwar, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace. Such was\r\nmy love for the white man, that my countrymen pointed, as they passed,\r\nand said: _Logan is the friend of white men_. I had thought to have\r\nlived with you, but for the injuries of one man. Colonel _Cresap_,\r\nthe last spring, in cold blood, and _unprovoked_, murdered all the\r\nrelations of _Logan_, not sparing even my women and children. There\r\nruns not a drop of his blood in the veins of any living creature. This\r\ncalled on me for revenge. I have sought it. I have killed many. I have\r\nfully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of\r\npeace. But do not harbour a thought, that mine is the joy of fear.\r\n_Logan_ never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel, to save his\r\nlife. Who is there to mourn for Logan? _Not one._”\r\n\r\n                  ----“They left of all my tribe\r\n        Nor man, nor child, nor things of living birth:\r\n        No, not the dog, that watch’d my household hearth\r\n        Escap’d their thirst of blood upon our plains!\r\n        _All_ perished! I alone am left of earth!\r\n        To whom, nor relative, nor blood remains,\r\n        No, not a kindred drop, that runs in human veins!”\r\n\r\n        _Campbell._\r\n\r\nGeneral Knox said to a chief, in New York, 1789, “You look sorry,\r\nbrother. What is the matter?”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHIEF’S ANSWER:\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you, brother. I have been looking at your beautiful\r\ncity--the great water--your fine country--and see how happy you all\r\nare. And then I thought:--this was ours. My ancestors lived here. They\r\nenjoyed this ground in peace, as their own. It was the gift of the\r\nGreat Spirit to them and their children. At last the white people came\r\nhere in a great canoe. They asked only, that we would let them tie it\r\nto a tree, lest the waters should carry it away. We said:--Yes. They\r\nthen said, that some of their people were sick, and asked, if they\r\nmight bring them ashore, and put them under the shade of the trees?\r\nWe said:--Yes. Then the winter and ice came; and they asked leave to\r\nbuild wigwams, and live in them, for the winter. We said:--Yes. Then\r\nthey asked for corn to keep them from starving; and we gave it them.\r\nBut we said: You must go away, when the winter is gone. And they\r\nsaid:--Yes. But when the spring came, and we told them: “You must\r\ngo;”--they pointed us to their big guns, which were planted round\r\ntheir wigwams, and said:--“_No_--we will stay.” And we could not drive\r\nthem away. Afterwards more came. They brought strong water, and gave\r\nit to the Indians for land. At last they drove us back, far from the\r\nwater, and the fish, and the oysters, into the woods. They destroyed\r\nour game;--and our people have wasted away. And see! how you grow\r\nup in their place! This makes me sorry, brother; and I cannot help\r\nit.”--_Star in the West._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Speech of_ CORNPLANTER _to General_ WASHINGTON, _in 1790_.\r\n\r\n“Father, When your army entered the country of the six nations, we\r\ncalled you the _town-destroyer_; and to this day, when your name is\r\nheard, our women look behind them, and turn pale; and our children\r\ncling close to the necks of their mothers. But our counsellors and\r\nwarriors, being men, cannot be afraid. But their hearts are grieved\r\nby the fears of our women and children; and desire, that the tomahawk\r\nmay be buried so deep, as to be heard of no more. Father, we will\r\nnot conceal from you, that the Great Spirit, and not man, has\r\npreserved _Cornplanter_ from the hands of his own nation. For they\r\nask continually, where is the land, on which our children and their\r\nchildren are to lie down upon? You told us, say they, that a line,\r\ndrawn from Pennsylvania to Lake Ontario, would mark it for ever on the\r\neast; and a line, running from Beaver Creek to Pennsylvania, would\r\nmark it on the west. But we see, that it is not so. For first one,\r\nthen another comes and takes it away by order of that people; who,\r\nyou told us, promised to secure it to us for ever. _Cornplanter_ is\r\nsilent (to them), for he has nothing to answer. When the sun goes down,\r\n_Cornplanter_ opens his heart before the Great Spirit; and earlier\r\nthan the sun appears again upon the hills, he gives thanks for his\r\nprotection during the night; for he feels, that while in the midst of\r\nmen, who have become desperate by the injuries they have sustained,\r\nit is God only that can preserve him. _Cornplanter_ loves peace. All\r\nhe had in store, he has given to those, who have been robbed by your\r\npeople; lest they should plunder the innocent to repay themselves.\r\n\r\n“The whole season, which others have employed in providing for their\r\nfamilies, _Cornplanter_ has spent in endeavours to preserve peace. And\r\nat this moment his wife and children are lying on the ground, and in\r\nwant of food. His heart is in pain for them. But he perceives, that the\r\nGreat Spirit will try his firmness in doing what is right.\r\n\r\n“Father! Innocent men of our nation are killed, one after another,\r\nthough of the best families; but none of your people, who have\r\ncommitted these murders, have been punished. We recollect, that you did\r\npromise to punish those who should kill our people. And we ask:--was it\r\nthe intention, that your people should kill the Senecas, and not only\r\nremain unpunished, _but be protected from the next of kin_? Father;\r\nthese, to us, are great things. We know, that you are very strong. We\r\nhave heard, that you are wise. But we shall wait to hear your answer\r\nto this, that we may know, that you are just.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Speech of a Pawnee Chief to_ MR. MONROE, _President of the United\r\nStates, delivered at Washington_.\r\n\r\n“_My great Father._ I have travelled a great distance to see you. I\r\nhave seen you, and my heart rejoices. I have heard your words. They\r\nhave entered one ear, and shall not go out at the other. And I will\r\ncarry them to my people, as pure as they came from your mouth.\r\n\r\n“_My great Father._ I am going to speak the truth. The Great Spirit\r\nlooks down upon us, and I call him to witness all that may pass between\r\nus on this occasion. If I am here now, and have seen your people, your\r\nhouses, your vessels on the big lake, and a great many wonderful things\r\nfar beyond my comprehension, which appear to have been made by the\r\nGreat Spirit, and placed in your hands;--I am indebted to my father\r\nhere,[16] who invited me from home, under whose wings I have been\r\nprotected. Yes, my great Father, I have travelled with your chief. I\r\nhave followed him; and trod in his tracks. But there is still another\r\ngreat Father, to whom I am much indebted--the Father of us all:--He,\r\nwho made us, and placed us on this earth. I feel grateful to the Great\r\nSpirit, for strengthening my heart for such an undertaking, and for\r\npreserving the life, which he gave me. The Great Spirit made us all.\r\nHe made my skin red, and yours white. He placed us on this earth, and\r\nintended, that we should live differently from each other. He made the\r\nwhites to cultivate the earth, and feed on tame animals; but he made\r\nus red skins to rove through the wild woods and plains, to feed on\r\nwild animals, and to dress in their skins. He also intended, that we\r\nshould go to war to take scalps, steal horses, and triumph over our\r\nenemies;--to cultivate peace at home, and promote the happiness of each\r\nother. I believe there are no people of any colour, on this earth, who\r\ndo not believe in the Great Spirit--and in rewards and punishments. We\r\nworship him; but not as you do. We differ from you in appearance and\r\nin manners, as well as in our customs; and we differ from you in our\r\nreligion. We have no large houses, as you have, to worship the Great\r\nSpirit in. If we had them to-day, we should want them to-morrow; for\r\nwe have not, like you, a fixed habitation. We have no settled home,\r\nexcept our villages, where we remain but two moons in twelve. We, like\r\nbrutes, rove through the country; while you, whites, reside between\r\nus and heaven. But still, my great Father, we love the Great Spirit;\r\nwe acknowledge his supreme power; our peace, our health, and our\r\nhappiness depend upon him; and our lives belong to him. He made us, and\r\nhe can destroy us.\r\n\r\n“_My great Father._ I will not tell a lie. I am going to tell the\r\ntruth. You love your country; you love your people; you love the\r\nmanner, in which they live; and you think your people brave. I am like\r\nyou, my great Father:--I love my country; I love my people; I love the\r\nmanner, in which they live; and think myself and warriors brave. Spare\r\nme, then, my Father. Let me enjoy my country, pursue the buffalo, and\r\nthe beaver, and the other wild animals of our wilderness; and I will\r\ntrade the skins with your people. I have grown up and lived thus long\r\nwithout work. I am in hopes you will suffer me to die without it. We\r\nhave yet plenty of buffalo, beaver, deer, and other wild animals; we\r\nhave also an abundance of horses. We have every thing we want. We\r\nhave plenty of land--_if you will keep your people off of it_. Let me\r\ncontinue to live, as I have done--until I shall have passed to the\r\nGood, or Evil Spirit, from the wilderness of my present life.\r\n\r\n“There was a time, when we did not know the whites. Our wants were\r\nfewer then, than they are now. They were always within control. We had\r\nthen seen nothing, which we could not get. But since our intercourse\r\nwith the _whites_, who have caused such a destruction of our game, our\r\nsituation is changed. We could lie down to sleep, and when we awoke, we\r\ncould find the buffalo, feeding around our camp. But now we are killing\r\nthem for their skins, and feeding the wolves with their flesh, to make\r\nour children cry over their bones.\r\n\r\n“Here, my great Father, is a pipe, which I present you, (handing it to\r\nthe president) as I am accustomed to present pipes to all red skins\r\nin peace with us. It is filled with such tobacco, as we smoked before\r\nwe knew the white people. I know, that the buffalo robes, leggins,\r\n(gaiters) moccasins, bears’ claws, &c. are of little value to you;--but\r\nwe wish to have them deposited and preserved in some conspicuous place\r\nin your lodge; so that when we are gone, and the sod turned over our\r\nbones, if our children should visit this place, as we do now, they may\r\nsee and recognize with pleasure the deposits of their fathers, and\r\nreflect on the times that are past.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anecdote of a Pawnee Brave._[17]\r\n\r\n“The facts in the following anecdote of a Pawnee Brave, son of _Old\r\nKnife_, one of the delegation, who visited Washington in 1821-22,\r\nhighly creditable to his courage, his generosity, and his humanity,\r\nwere taken, by permission, from a very interesting manuscript Journal\r\nof Captain Bell, of his expedition with Major Long, to the foot of the\r\nRocky Mountains, in 1821, and are sanctioned by Major O’Fallon, Indian\r\nagent, near the scene of the transaction here related; and also by the\r\ninterpreter, who witnessed the scene.\r\n\r\n“This _Brave_, or warrior, of fine size, figure, and countenance, is\r\nnow (1822) about twenty-five years old. At the age of twenty-one, his\r\nheroic deeds had acquired for him in his nation, the rank of “_the\r\nbravest of the Braves_.” The savage practice of torturing and burning\r\nto death their prisoners, existed in this nation. An unfortunate\r\nfemale, taken in war, of the Paduca nation, was destined to this\r\nhorrible death. The fatal hour had arrived. The trembling victim, far\r\nfrom her home and her friends, was fastened to the stake. The whole\r\ntribe was assembled on the surrounding plain to witness the awful\r\nscene. Just when the funeral pile was to be kindled, and the whole\r\nmultitude of spectators were on the tiptoe of expectation, this young\r\nwarrior, having unnoticed prepared two fleet horses, with the necessary\r\nprovisions, sprang from his seat, rushed through the crowd, liberated\r\nthe victim, seized her in his arms, placed her on one of the horses,\r\nand mounting the other himself, he made the utmost speed towards the\r\nnation and friends of the captive. The multitude, dumb and nerveless\r\nwith amazement at the daring deed, made no effort to rescue their\r\nvictim from her deliverer. They viewed it as the immediate act of the\r\nGreat Spirit, submitted to it without a murmur, and quietly retired\r\nto their village. The released captive was accompanied three days\r\nthrough the wilderness towards her home. He then gave her the horse,\r\non which she rode, with the necessary provisions for the remainder of\r\ntheir journey, and they parted. On his return to the village, such was\r\nhis popularity, no inquiry was made into his conduct, no censure was\r\npassed upon it. And since this transaction, no human sacrifice has been\r\noffered in this, or in any other of the Pawnee tribes. The practice is\r\nabandoned. Of what influence is one bold act in a good cause!\r\n\r\n“The publication of this anecdote at Washington, led the young ladies\r\nof Miss White’s seminary in that city, in a manner highly creditable to\r\ntheir good sense and good feeling, to present this _Brave_ and humane\r\nIndian, with a handsome _silver medal_, with appropriate inscriptions,\r\nas a token of their commendation of the noble act of rescuing one of\r\ntheir sex, an innocent victim, from a cruel death. Their address to\r\nthe chief closes, as follows:--\r\n\r\n“_Brother_, Accept this token of our esteem;--always wear it for our\r\nsakes;--and when again you have the power to save a poor woman from\r\ndeath and torture, think of this, and of us, and fly to her relief and\r\nrescue.”\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY.\r\n\r\n“_Brothers_ and _Sisters_:--_This_ (the medal) will give me ease,\r\nmore than I ever had; and I will listen more than I ever did to white\r\nmen. I am glad, that my brothers and sisters have heard of the good\r\nact that I have done. My brothers and sisters think, that I did it in\r\nignorance; but I now know what I have done. I did do it in ignorance,\r\nand did not know, that I did good. But by giving me _this_ medal, I\r\nknow it.”--_Morse’s Report, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nR. CLAY, PRINTER, BREAD-STREET-HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] As the Author has frequently been obliged to employ the distinctive\r\nphrase of _wild Indians_ in this work, and has inadvertently omitted to\r\nexplain it--he would take this opportunity to say, that it indicates\r\nthose Indians, who have not been cultivated and modified by the\r\ninfluence of civilization.\r\n\r\n[2] It is interesting to remark, that M. Cuvier, before he died, had\r\nconsented to take the chair at the next anniversary of the Paris Bible\r\nSociety, and to exhibit the proofs of agreement between geological\r\nobservations and the Mosaic account of the Creation and Deluge.\r\n\r\n[3] This story is constructed from information obtained upon the spot,\r\nand is in substance true.\r\n\r\n[4] Not having the exact dimensions of these lakes from authority,\r\nunder hand, these statements are made from recollection, and a glance\r\nview of the map. It is thought they are within the actual limits, and\r\nsufficiently accurate for the present purpose.\r\n\r\n[5] One detachment had been left at Fort Gratiot.\r\n\r\n[6] After all I confess it seems to me an incredible statement. That\r\na vast group of islands have long time been observed to lie in that\r\nquarter, is evident from the fact, that the ordinary charts are densely\r\nspotted to represent them, where the following inscription stands:\r\n“_The Thousand Islands_.”\r\n\r\n[7] This decision may be found in the Appendix to the second volume,\r\nand the subject treated at large in the text of that volume.\r\n\r\n[8] Sassacus was chief of the Pequots; Philip of the Pokanokets--but\r\nsometimes headed the Narragansetts, as allies.\r\n\r\n[9] Of course I do not pretend to quote literally, but merely to give\r\nthe substance of what was said in these interviews, as narrated to\r\nme by the chiefs. The advice was taken and acted upon, and led to\r\nmomentous results--as will appear.\r\n\r\n[10] To show how little the disturbance of these Indians, in their new\r\nabode, North-West Territory, was anticipated, and the benevolent wishes\r\nof those, who desired to confirm them in this retreat, I would here\r\nintroduce some of the remarks of Dr. Morse in his Report to Congress.\r\nIt may be observed, that the Doctor had been appointed an agent of\r\nGovernment, with instructions to visit remote tribes, and collect all\r\npossible information respecting them--to report the result of his\r\nobservations, and to recommend any measures, which might seem to him\r\ndesirable to be adopted for the welfare of the Indians.\r\n\r\n“The expectation is,” says the Doctor, when preparing his Report, “that\r\na great part of the Stockbridge Indians, with numbers of the St. Regis\r\ntribe, of the six nations, of the Munsees, Nanticokes, Delawares, and\r\nothers, in the course of the next season, 1822, will emigrate and plant\r\nthemselves on this purchase (in the North-West Territory, which had\r\nbeen made pursuant to the Doctor’s recommendation.) Should this take\r\nplace, a colony will be formed at once, and a current to it created;\r\nand should its foundations be _broad_ and laid with wisdom, there is\r\nlittle doubt of its gradual increase. Should the plan be popular with\r\nthe Indians, (and the prospect is, that it will be) a _large_ colony,\r\nenough perhaps to form a territory,[11] or a _State_, may be ultimately\r\ncollected here, educated together, and received into the Union, and to\r\nthe enjoyment of the privileges of citizens.\r\n\r\n“Let regulations be made to _prohibit the introduction of white\r\nsettlers_ within the limits of this territory--that is: _within limits\r\nbounded south by Illinois, east by Michigan, north by Superior, and\r\nwest by the Mississippi. Let this territory be reserved exclusively for\r\nIndians_, in which to make the proposed experiment of gathering into\r\none body, as many of the scattered and other Indians, as may choose to\r\nsettle there--to be educated, become citizens, and in due time, to be\r\nadmitted to all the privileges common to other territories and States\r\nof the Union. Such a course would probably save the Indians.”\r\n\r\nThe following is an article of a treaty made between the Government of\r\nthe United States and the Delaware tribe in 1788:--\r\n\r\nArt. 6. “Whereas the enemies of the United States have endeavoured by\r\nevery artifice in their power, to possess the Indians in general with\r\nan opinion, that it is the design of the States aforesaid to extirpate\r\nthe Indians, and take possession of their territories:--to obviate such\r\nfalse suggestions, the United States do engage to guarantee to the\r\naforesaid nation of Delawares and their heirs, all their territorial\r\nrights in the fullest and most ample manner, as they have been bounded\r\nby former treaties, as long as the said Delaware nation shall abide\r\nby and hold fast the chain of friendship now entered into. And it is\r\nfurther agreed between the contracting parties,--should it for the\r\nfuture be found conducive to the mutual interests of both parties,--to\r\ninvite any other tribes who have been friends of the United States,\r\nto join the present confederation and to form a _State_, whereof\r\nthe Delaware nation shall be the head and have a representation in\r\nCongress, &c.”\r\n\r\n[11] A Territorial Government in America, is substantially _Colonial_.\r\n\r\n[12] This letter asserts, that the annual interest of a fund, granted\r\nin the reign of George II. for “Civilizing and Christianizing the\r\nIndians of New England,” amounts to about 40,000_l._--and that it is\r\nnot appropriated. It might be interesting to inquire after it.\r\n\r\n[13] Indian name of _conference_.\r\n\r\n[14] I present this merely as the _substance_ of the impressions left\r\non my own mind.\r\n\r\n[15] It has been before observed in this volume, that the Indian chiefs\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the United States, are accustomed to receive\r\nthe flag of the Union, a present from Government, in token of their\r\nalliance, which they are generally proud to display.\r\n\r\n[16] Major O’Fallon.\r\n\r\n[17] The _Braves_ are warriors, who have distinguished themselves in\r\nbattle, and stand highest in the estimation of the tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber’s Note:\r\n\r\nInconsistent spelling and hyphenation are as in the original.]",
