C. SESSIONS & SONS\r\nSIOUX FALLS S. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIOUX INDIAN COURTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their primitive life the Sioux Indians of North America had an\r\nintelligent system of jurisprudence, varying somewhat in the different\r\nbands, as our court practice varies in the several states, but\r\nnevertheless recognizing the same general principles throughout the\r\nconfederacy.[1]\r\n\r\n      [1] Most writers upon Indian life have noted the existence of\r\n      these courts. Since undertaking this paper, I have consulted\r\n      Hump, One Bull, Wakutemani and Simon Kirk, all intelligent Sioux\r\n      and, save as otherwise noted, they are my authorities for the\r\n      statements herein contained.\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy thing to determine the laws or the practices of an\r\nunlettered people, who have abandoned the wild and primitive life to\r\nlive under regulations prescribed by their conquerors, and who must\r\ndepend upon tradition and recollection for the practices of the old\r\nlife; but fortunately intelligent observers have from time to time,\r\nduring the past two and one half centuries, noted their observations,\r\nand these, supplemented by the recollections of the older men now\r\nliving, give to us a fairly clear understanding of the courts and the\r\nlegal practices of these people.\r\n\r\nPrimarily the Sioux government was by clans,--patriarchal; but within\r\nthe clan it very nearly approached the representative republican form.\r\nThe council was the representative body which gave expression to the\r\nwill of the people. True the council was selected by the chief of the\r\nclan, but his very tenure of office depended upon his using the nicest\r\ndiscretion in inviting into his cabinet the men of character, valor and\r\ninfluence, so that the body was almost invariably entirely\r\nrepresentative of popular views and interests. Caste cut a considerable\r\nfigure; indeed it has been said by those most intimate with Sioux life\r\nthat there is as much caste among the Dakotas as among the Hindus.[2]\r\nOnly high caste men of course would be permitted to sit in the\r\ndeliberations, but when a council was to be convened the ordinary\r\npractice was for the chief's crier to go out and announce to the camp\r\nthat a matter was to be considered in council, and the head men at once\r\nassembled and seated themselves in the council circle as a matter of\r\ncourse and of right.[3] The chief, unquestionably a man of courage and\r\nphysical power, was an executive officer who rarely asserted arbitrary\r\nrule, particularly in civil affairs, for the Sioux were too high\r\nspirited a people to tolerate anything savoring of despotism. Usually\r\nhe was suave, diplomatic and tolerant, and enjoyed the affection and\r\nveneration of his people. Most public affairs were determined in the\r\ngeneral council, including many subjects naturally falling within the\r\njurisdiction of courts of justice, but aside from the council were two\r\ndistinct courts, one exercising jurisdiction in matters civil and\r\ncriminal in times of peace; the other taking the broadest and most\r\ncomprehensive jurisdiction of all things military, and in time of war\r\nassuming jurisdiction in all of the affairs of the people, arbitrarily\r\nplacing the camp under martial law.\r\n\r\n      [2] Miss Mary C. Collins, for thirty-three years missionary among\r\n      the Tetons, especially the Hunkpapa and Blackfoot bands.\r\n\r\n      [3] Letter of Dr. Thomas L. Riggs, to writer, June, 1903.\r\n\r\nThe judges of these courts were usually twelve in number and held their\r\nplaces by hereditary right, though occasionally some low caste man,\r\nthrough some brilliant exploit would break into this exclusive and\r\naristocratic circle and sometimes even exercised dominating influence\r\nwhich the aristocrats dared not oppose, though he was still regarded as\r\na plebian upstart, and was despised by the upper ten, and his rank died\r\nwith him. Ordinarily from seven to twelve judges sat for the trial of\r\ncauses, but sometimes even a greater number were permitted. The civil\r\ncourt in time of peace took cognizance of civil and criminal matters\r\narising in the band. Civil actions usually grew out of disputes about\r\nthe ownership of property and the court patiently heard the testimony\r\nof the parties and witnesses and at once determined the ownership of\r\nthe article, delivered it to the successful litigant and the decision\r\nwas never reviewed or questioned. A majority of the court determined\r\nthe judgment.\r\n\r\nCriminal matters of which the court took cognizance were assaults,\r\nrapes, larceny and murder; all crimes against persons; and if committed\r\nagainst a member of the tribe were severely dealt with. Sometimes it\r\nwas necessary to prove the crime by competent witnesses, and the court\r\nwas the judge of the credibility of these who testified, but rarely,\r\nhowever, was it necessary to summon witnesses, for if the accused was\r\nreally guilty it was a point of honor to admit the offense and take the\r\nconsequences. Thus the real responsibility resting upon the court in\r\nmost cases was to determine the penalty. Usually a severe penalty was\r\nimposed which could be satisfied by the payment of a certain number of\r\nhorses or other specific property to the injured party, or his family,\r\nbut if the offense was peculiarly repellent to the better sentiment of\r\nthe camp the court might insist upon the summary infliction of the\r\nsentence imposed. This might be the death penalty, exile or whipping;\r\nor it might be the destruction of the teepee and other property of the\r\nconvict. These latter penalties were, however, usually reserved for\r\nanother class of offenses; crimes which were against the community\r\nrather than against an individual. These offenses were generally\r\nviolations of the game laws and the offender could expect little mercy.\r\nHow reasonable this policy was will be readily understood when we\r\nrecall that the subsistence of the entire nation depended almost\r\nentirely upon the preservation of the wild game. The individual, who\r\nwould wantonly kill game fit for food, or frighten it away needlessly\r\nfrom the vicinity of the camps was a public enemy and was treated\r\naccordingly. He was fined, his property destroyed, he was whipped, or\r\nif a persistent offender, he was reduced from his position as a hunter\r\nand made to do the menial duties of a squaw; the latter being the most\r\nhumiliating and terrible sentence which could be imposed, deemed much\r\nworse than death and if the convict was a man of ordinary spirit he\r\nusually chose to commit suicide in preference.[4]\r\n\r\n      [4] Interview with Joseph LaFramboise of Veblen, a Sisseton, at\r\n      Sioux Falls, in October, 1900.\r\n\r\nFor some offenses a convict was exiled from the camp, given an old\r\nteepee and a blanket, but no arms, and was allowed to make a living if\r\nhe could. Sometimes he would go off and join some other band, but such\r\nconduct was not considered good form and he usually set up his\r\nestablishment on some small hill near the home camp and made the best\r\nof the situation. If he conducted himself properly he was usually soon\r\nforgiven and restored to his rights in the community. If he went off to\r\nanother people he lost all standing among the Sioux and was thereafter\r\ntreated as an outlaw and a renegade. The entire band of Inkpaduta, once\r\nthe terror of the Dakota frontier, was composed of these outlaws.[5]\r\n\r\n      [5] Flandreau's Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThe camp policeman was a most important officer of the court and he\r\nfrequently took upon himself the adjudication of petty quarrels and the\r\nsummary punishment of small offenses committed within his view. He was\r\nappointed by the chief for one or more days' service and he made the\r\nmost of his brief span of authority. In addition to executing the\r\norders of the court he was always on watch to preserve the tranquility\r\nof the camp during the day and he stood upon guard at night. When\r\nordered to do a thing it was a point of honor to accomplish it or die\r\nin the attempt. He was a peace officer, delighting to fight for peace'\r\nsake at any time.[6]\r\n\r\n      [6] Journal of Lewis and Clark September 26th and 27th, 1804.\r\n\r\nWhile the civil court was composed of the \"elder statesmen\" the\r\nmilitary court was composed of the war chief and his most distinguished\r\nbraves, and, as has been before suggested herein, exercised unlimited\r\npower in time of war and was implicitly obeyed. It took jurisdiction of\r\nall matters growing out of infractions of the \"Articles of War\" and of\r\nall the civil and criminal affairs of the tribe as well. There was no\r\nappeal from its judgments and its sentences were summarily executed. An\r\nanecdote will illustrate something of its practice: In the campaign of\r\n1876, after the affair at Little Big Horn, Grey Eagle, a Hunkpapa\r\nheadman of good family and with a good military record, was charged\r\nwith stealing a horse from another warrior of the Sioux forces. He\r\ndenied the charge but the property was in his possession and he could\r\nnot satisfactorily explain his connection with it. He was placed upon\r\ntrial, witnesses summoned and he was convicted of the theft and\r\nsentenced to be whipped, a punishment most befitting the mean estate of\r\na squaw. The sentence was executed in full view of the entire camp.\r\nGrey Eagle continued in the campaign, fighting valiantly at every\r\nopportunity, but he was filled with an intense desire for revenge\r\nagainst the court and particularly against Sitting Bull, a plebian who\r\nhad compelled recognition from the aristocrats, and whom the convict\r\nbelieved to be especially responsible for his humiliation. Though not\r\napropos to this discussion it may be of interest if I shall add that\r\nafter the lapse of fourteen years, one December morning in 1890 when a\r\nparty of native policemen, inspired very largely by the aristocratic\r\nhatred for the presumptuous plebian, came down upon the home of Sitting\r\nBull and effected his arrest and were taking him away through an\r\nexcited throng of his friends, the voice of Grey Eagle, from out in the\r\ndarkness shouted: \"Sitting Bull is escaping, shoot him, shoot him!\"\r\nwhereupon began the outbreak which within the moment resulted in the\r\ndeath of the old medicine man and seventeen of the police and\r\nIndians.[7] It, too, may be of further interest to relate that at the\r\npresent time Grey Eagle is the Chief Justice of the native court at\r\nBullhead Station, South Dakota.\r\n\r\n      [7] Related by Miss Mary C. Collins, April, 1908.\r\n\r\nAmong the duties of this court was to determine the limits of each\r\nday's march when out upon a campaign, and to regulate the camping\r\nplaces. This was an important function, for the army subsisted off the\r\ncountry and unless the utmost care was exercised \"the base of supplies\"\r\nwould be frightened away and the band subjected to starvation.\r\n\r\nA court very similar to the military court was likewise organized for\r\neach great hunting expedition and given absolute control of the general\r\nmovement, but this hunting court did not interfere with the ordinary\r\njurisdiction of the civil court in matters of personal disputes,\r\npersonal injuries and the like. In 1841, General Henry H. Sibley, of\r\nMinnesota, proposed to the Indians residing about his home at Mendota\r\nthat they go down to the \"Neutral Strip\" in Northern Iowa for a long\r\nhunt. The Sioux were agreeable, and to get the matter in form Sibley\r\nmade a feast to which all of the natives were invited. After eating and\r\nsmoking several hundred painted sticks were produced and were offered\r\nfor the acceptance of each grown warrior. It was understood that\r\nwhoever voluntarily accepted one of these sticks was solemnly bound to\r\nbe of the hunting party under penalty of punishment by the soldiers if\r\nhe failed. About one hundred and fifty men accepted. These men then\r\ndetached themselves from the main body and after consultation selected\r\nten of the bravest and most influential of the young men to act as\r\nmembers of the hunting court. These justices were called soldiers.\r\nEvery member bound himself to obey all rules made by the court. A time\r\nwas then fixed for the start. At the appointed time and place every one\r\nappeared but one man who lived twelve miles distant. Five of the court\r\nat once started out to round him up. In a few hours they returned with\r\nthe recalcitrant and his family, and with his belongings packed upon\r\nhis horses. He was duly penitent and not subjected to punishment,\r\nthough he was severely threatened in case he again failed. General\r\nSibley thus tells the story.[8] \"We,\" Sibley and his white friends,\r\n\"became subject to the control of the soldiers. At the close of each\r\nday the limits of the following day's hunt were announced by the\r\nsoldiers, designated by a stream, grove, or other natural object. This\r\nlimit was ordinarily about ten miles ahead of the proposed camping\r\nplace and the soldiers each morning went forward and stationed\r\nthemselves along the line to detect and punish any who attempted to\r\npass it. The penalty attached to any violation of the rules of the camp\r\nwas discretionary with the soldiers. In aggravated cases they would\r\nthresh the offender unmercifully. Sometimes they would cut the clothing\r\nof the man or woman entirely to pieces, slit down the lodge with their\r\nknives, break kettles and do other damage. I was made the victim on one\r\noccasion by venturing near the prohibited boundary. A soldier hid\r\nhimself in the long grass until I approached sufficiently near when he\r\nsprang from his concealment and giving the soldiers' whoop rushed upon\r\nme. He seized my fine double barreled gun and raised it in the air as\r\nif with the intention of dashing it to the ground. I reminded him that\r\nguns were not to be broken, because they could be neither repaired or\r\nreplaced. He handed me back the gun and then snatched my fur cap from\r\nmy head, ordering me back to camp, where he said he would cut up my\r\nlodge in the evening. I had to ride ten miles bareheaded on a cold\r\nwinter day, but to resist a soldier while in the discharge of duty is\r\nconsidered disgraceful in the extreme. When I reached the lodge I told\r\nFaribault of the predicament in which I was placed. We concluded the\r\nbest policy, would be to prepare a feast to mollify them. We got\r\ntogether all the best things we could muster and when the soldiers\r\narrived in the evening we went out and invited them to a feast in our\r\nlodge. The temptation was too strong to be resisted.\" They responded,\r\nate their fill, smoked and forgave the \"contempt of court,\" which\r\nindicates that the judiciary, even in that primitive time, was not\r\nwholly incorruptible.\r\n\r\n      [8] Minnesota Historical Collections, Vol. III.\r\n\r\n                    *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThe modern Sioux Courts, organized under the authority of federal law\r\nand in accordance with the rules of the Indian Department, are perhaps\r\nof more interest to lawyers than the courts of the primitive tribes.\r\nThe modern courts were first proposed by General William S. Harney, in\r\n1856 and were provided for in the treaty made at Port Pierre in March\r\nof that year, which unfortunately was not ratified by the senate.[9] It\r\ncan scarcely be doubted that had Harney's scheme for making the Sioux\r\nresponsible to the government for the conduct of their own people been\r\nadopted, much bloodshed and treasure would have been saved.\r\n\r\n      [9] This treaty was not ratified because of the large expenditure\r\n      which would be demanded to uniform and subsist the police force.\r\n      Afterwards we spent in a single year for the subjugation of the\r\n      Sioux sufficient money to subsist the police for a century.\r\n\r\nIt was not until after the Red Cloud war ended in 1868 that the courts\r\nfor Indian offenses, equipped by the Indian themselves, began to be\r\ntried at some of the agencies in a small way. The Sissetons and Santees\r\nwere first to give them a trial and eventually they were supplied to\r\nall the Reservations except the Rosebud, which, for some reason of\r\nwhich I have been unable to secure information, has never had them.\r\n\r\nThe following general rules governing courts of Indian Offenses\r\npursuant to the statute have been adopted by the Indian Department:[10]\r\n\r\n      [10] Rules and Regulations of the Indian Office governing Indian\r\n      Reservations. Letter of Hon. John R. Brennan, agent at Pine\r\n      Ridge, April, 1908.\r\n\r\n    First: When authorized by the Department there shall be established\r\n    at each agency a tribunal consisting ordinarily of three Indians,\r\n    to be known as \"the Court of Indian Offenses,\" and the members of\r\n    said court shall each be styled \"judge of the Court of Indian\r\n    Offenses.\"\r\n\r\n    Agents may select from among the members of the tribe persons of\r\n    intelligence and good moral character and integrity and recommend\r\n    them to the Indian Office for appointment as judges; provided,\r\n    however, that no person shall be eligible to such an appointment\r\n    who is a polygamist.\r\n\r\n    Second: The court of Indian Offenses shall hold at least two\r\n    regular sessions in each and every month, the time and place for\r\n    holding said sessions to be agreed upon by the judges, or a\r\n    majority of them, and approved by the agent; and special sessions\r\n    of the court may be held when requested by three reputable members\r\n    of the tribe and approved by the agent.\r\n\r\n    Third: The court shall hear and pass judgment upon all such\r\n    questions as may be presented to it for consideration by the agent,\r\n    or by his approval, and shall have original jurisdiction over all\r\n    \"Indian offenses\" designated as such by rules 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 of\r\n    these rules. The judgment of the court may be by two judges; and\r\n    that the several orders of the court may be carried into full\r\n    effect, the agent is hereby authorized and empowered to compel the\r\n    attendance of witnesses at any session of the court, and to\r\n    enforce, with the aid of the police, if necessary, all orders that\r\n    may be passed by the court or a majority thereof; but all orders,\r\n    decrees, or judgments of the court shall be subject to approval or\r\n    disapproval by the agent, and an appeal to and final revision by\r\n    the Indian Office; _Provided_, that when an appeal is taken to the\r\n    Indian Office, the appellant shall furnish security satisfactory to\r\n    the court, and approved by the agent, for good and peaceful\r\n    behavior pending final decision.\r\n\r\n    Fourth: The \"sun dance,\" and all other similar dances and so-called\r\n    religious ceremonies, shall be considered \"Indian offenses\" and any\r\n    Indian found guilty of being a participant in one or more of these\r\n    offenses shall, for the first offense committed, be punished by\r\n    withholding from him his rations for a period not exceeding ten\r\n    days; and if found guilty of any subsequent offense under this\r\n    rule, shall be punished by withholding his rations for a period of\r\n    not less than fifteen days nor more than thirty days, or by\r\n    incarceration in the agency prison for a period not exceeding\r\n    thirty days.\r\n\r\n    Fifth: Any plural marriage hereafter contracted or entered into by\r\n    any member of an Indian tribe under the supervision of a United\r\n    States Indian Agent shall be considered an \"Indian offense\"\r\n    cognizable by the court of Indian offenses; and upon trial and\r\n    conviction thereof by said court the offender shall pay a fine of\r\n    not less than twenty dollars, or work at hard labor for a period of\r\n    twenty days, or both, at the discretion of the court, the proceeds\r\n    thereof to be devoted to the benefit of the tribe to which the\r\n    offender may at the time belong; and so long as the Indian shall\r\n    continue in this unlawful relation he shall forfeit all right to\r\n    receive rations from the government. And whenever it shall be\r\n    proven to the satisfaction of the court that any member of the\r\n    tribe fails, without proper cause, to support his wife and\r\n    children, no rations shall be issued to him until such time as\r\n    satisfactory assurance is given to the court, approved by the\r\n    agent, that the offender will provide his family to the best of his\r\n    ability.\r\n\r\n    Sixth: The usual practices of so-called \"medicine men\" shall be\r\n    considered an \"Indian offense\" cognizable by the court of Indian\r\n    offenses, and whenever it shall be proven to the satisfaction of\r\n    the court that the influence of a so-called \"medicine man\" operates\r\n    as a hindrance to civilization of a tribe, or that said \"medicine\r\n    man\" resorts to any artifice or device to keep the Indians under\r\n    his influence, or shall adopt any means to prevent the attendance\r\n    of children at the agency schools, or shall use any of the arts of\r\n    the conjurer to prevent the Indians from abandoning their\r\n    heathenish rites and customs, he shall be adjudged guilty of an\r\n    \"Indian offense,\" and upon conviction of any one or more of these\r\n    specified practices, or any other, in the opinion of the court, of\r\n    an equally anti-progressive nature shall be confined in the agency\r\n    guardhouse for a term not less than ten days, or until such time as\r\n    he shall produce evidence satisfactory to the court, and approved\r\n    by the agent, that he will forever abandon all practices styled\r\n    \"Indian offenses\" under this rule.\r\n\r\n    Seventh: Any Indian who shall wilfully destroy, or with intent to\r\n    steal or destroy, shall take and carry away any property of any\r\n    value or description, being the property free from tribal\r\n    interference, of any other Indian or Indians, shall, without\r\n    reference to the value thereof, be deemed guilty of an \"Indian\r\n    offense,\" and, upon trial and conviction thereof, by the court of\r\n    \"Indian offenses,\" shall be compelled to return the stolen property\r\n    to the proper owner, or, in case the property shall have been lost\r\n    or destroyed, the estimated full value thereof, and in any event\r\n    the party or parties so found guilty shall be confined in the\r\n    agency guardhouse for a term not exceeding thirty days; and it\r\n    shall not be considered a sufficient or satisfactory answer to any\r\n    of the offenses set forth in this rule that the party charged was\r\n    at the time a \"mourner,\" and thereby justified in taking or\r\n    destroying the property in accordance with the customs or rites of\r\n    the tribe.\r\n\r\n    Eighth: Any Indian or mixed blood who shall pay or offer to pay any\r\n    money or other valuable consideration to the friends or relatives\r\n    of any Indian girl or woman, for the purpose of living or\r\n    cohabiting with said girl or woman, shall be deemed guilty of an\r\n    \"Indian offense,\" and upon conviction thereof shall forfeit all\r\n    right to government rations for a period at the discretion of the\r\n    agent, or be imprisoned in the agency guardhouse for a period not\r\n    exceeding sixty days; and any Indian or mixed blood who shall\r\n    receive or offer to receive any consideration for the purposes\r\n    hereinbefore specified shall be punished in a similar manner as\r\n    provided for the party paying or offering to pay the said\r\n    consideration; and if any white man shall be found guilty of any of\r\n    the offenses herein mentioned he shall be immediately removed from\r\n    the reservation and not allowed to return thereto.\r\n\r\n    Ninth: In addition to the \"offenses\" hereinbefore enumerated, the\r\n    court of \"Indian offenses\" shall also have jurisdiction (subject to\r\n    the provisions of rule 3) of misdemeanors committed by Indians\r\n    belonging to the reservation, and of civil suits where Indians are\r\n    parties thereto; and any Indian who shall be found intoxicated, or\r\n    who shall sell, exchange, give, barter or dispose of any\r\n    spirituous, vinous, or fermented liquors to any other Indian, or\r\n    who shall introduce or attempt to introduce under any pretense\r\n    whatever any spirituous, vinous, or fermented liquors on the\r\n    reservation, shall be punishable by imprisonment for not less than\r\n    thirty days nor more than ninety days or by withholding of\r\n    government rations, therefrom, at the discretion of the court and\r\n    approval of the agent.\r\n\r\nThe civil jurisdiction of such court shall be the same as that of a\r\njustice of the peace in the State or Territory where such court is\r\nlocated, and the practice in such civil cases shall conform as nearly\r\nas practicable to the rules governing the practice of justices of the\r\npeace in such State or Territory, and it shall also be the duty of the\r\ncourt to instruct, advise and inform either or both parties to any\r\nsuit in regard to the requirements of these rules.\r\n\r\nUnder these rules the courts are organized and hold their sittings at\r\nsuch times and places as will be most convenient for the people, as for\r\nillustration, upon the Cheyenne River Reservation one judge sits at\r\neach substation at each semi-monthly ration issue, and if for any\r\nreason a party is dissatisfied with his decision, he has a right to\r\nappeal his case to the entire bench which sits for the purpose at the\r\nagency at regular intervals[11].\r\n\r\n      [11] Letter of Prof. C. W. Rastall, Superintendent at Cheyenne\r\n      River, April, 1908.\r\n\r\nPersons convicted of such offenses as come within the jurisdiction of\r\nthe court are committed to the guard-house for a stated period, and are\r\nrequired to work in keeping up the grounds about the agency or\r\nsubstation, as the case may be. They make very little trouble and\r\nrarely does one attempt to escape, though they work without guard.[12]\r\n\r\n      [12] Letter of T. W. Lane, agent at Crow Creek, April, 1908.\r\n\r\nThe Indian people generally have great respect for the judges of their\r\ncourts and the latter show much wisdom and discretion in their\r\ndecisions, though they do not always place the white man's estimate\r\nupon the relative enormity of offenses. I was present at a session of\r\nthe Cheyenne river court in 1892, when two parties accused with crime\r\nwere brought before it. One was charged with stealing a picket pin of\r\nthe value of thirteen cents and he got thirty days in the guard-house,\r\nwhile the other, convicted of a rape, got ten days.\r\n\r\nFormerly the judges were not compensated, but now they receive a\r\nnominal salary,--from five to ten dollars per month,--and their board\r\nwhile sitting. It is regarded as a great distinction to be chosen\r\nto the bench and the courts administer the law, as they understand\r\nit, with dignity and firmness.[13] There are no lawyers upon the\r\nreservations but a friend may appear for a party to an action, or one\r\naccused of an offense and the trials are conducted with much formality\r\nand the pleas are frequently shrewd and eloquent. Every Indian is an\r\norator by nature, and the courts afford the best modern opportunities\r\nto display their gifts.\r\n\r\n      [13] Letter of Major Brennan.\r\n\r\nThe police force upon all of the reservations is composed of the\r\nnatives and they are highly efficient and render great assistance to\r\nthe courts in preserving the peace and in bringing offenders to\r\njustice. It is a point of honor for a Sioux policeman to do his whole\r\nduty regardless of obstacle and neither kin nor friend can expect\r\nleniency if he stands in the way of duty, and this is equally true of\r\nthe courts. It is not an infrequent thing for the judge to try his son\r\nor near relative and in such cases the accused is sure to get the limit\r\nof the law.[14]\r\n\r\n      [14] Interview with Solomon Two Stars, hereditary chief of\r\n      Sissetons, August, 1901.
