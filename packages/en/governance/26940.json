The circumstances\r\nwhich surrounded this election were produced by the outcome of the\r\nprevious month's General Election--a landslide for the Tories--and, to\r\nunderstand these circumstances, the impact of that Tory victory must be\r\nseen within the context of the political events of 1710.\r\n\r\nBy early in 1710 it had become obvious that the Whig Ministry of Sidney\r\nGodolphin was unable or unwilling to negotiate an end to the long,\r\nexpensive, and consequently, unpopular war with France. The quarrel\r\nbetween Queen Anne and her confidante, the Duchess of Marlborough,\r\nsmouldered until, on 6 April 1710, the breach between them became\r\nfinal. The Queen's confidence in the Duke of Marlborough began to erode\r\nas early as May 1709 when he sought to be appointed \"Captain-General\r\nfor Life.\" Godolphin's decision to impeach the popular Rev. Dr. Henry\r\nSacheverell for preaching \"a sermon which reasserted the doctrine of\r\nnon-resistance to the will of the monarch\" was ill-advised, for not\r\nonly did it give the High-Church Tories a martyr, it also gave the\r\nAdministration the appearance of being against the Church. In securing\r\nthe impeachment of Sacheverell on 20 March 1710, the Whigs discovered\r\nthat they had lost the support and the confidence of both the\r\nParliament and the country.\r\n\r\nDissention within and intrigue from without further hastened the fall\r\nof the Administration. Godolphin, a moderate, had, after the General\r\nElection of 1708, found himself allied with the \"Junto\" of five\r\npowerful Whig Lords--Wharton, Sommers, Halifax, Orford, and\r\nSunderland--but it was, at best, an uneasy alliance. Throughout 1709\r\nand into the early months of 1710, personal jealousies drove the\r\nGodolphin-Marlborough interest farther and farther away from the Junto.\r\nRobert Harley and the Dukes of Somerset and Shrewsbury, in their\r\ndetermination to overthrow the Administration, exploited every chance\r\nto widen the rifts between Anne and her Ministers and between the two\r\nministerial factions. Abigail Hill Masham, who soon became an agent of\r\nHarley, replaced the Duchess of Marlborough as Anne's confidante.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ministry fell, it fell like a house of cards. On 14 April 1710\r\nShrewsbury was made Lord Chamberlain over the unavailing protests of\r\nGodolphin. Two months later, at the instigation of Somerset, the Queen\r\nreplaced Sunderland with the Tory Lord Dartmouth as Secretary of State.\r\nFinally, on 8 August, Godolphin was ordered to break the White Staff of\r\nhis office and Harley was appointed Treasurer. One by one the remaining\r\nJunto Ministers were replaced by Tories. By September the work was\r\ncomplete. The Duke of Marlborough alone remained, in command of the\r\narmy, but this was only to be until the new Ministry could negotiate a\r\npeace and his services would no longer be required.\r\n\r\nIt had been Harley's intention to govern by means of a \"moderate\"\r\nAdministration, a \"Queen's Ministery above party,\" but he had not\r\nreckoned on the outcome of the General Election called in October. \"On\r\nthe day Godolphin fell, Harley expounded his 'moderate' programme in a\r\nletter to the Duke of Newcastle: 'The Queen is assured you will approve\r\nher proceedings, which are directed to the sole aim of making an\r\nhonourable and safe peace, securing her allies, reserving the liberty\r\nand property of the subject, and the indulgence to Dissenters in\r\nparticular, and to perpetuate this by really securing the succession of\r\nthe House of Hanover.'\"[1]\r\n\r\nAlone, either the antagonism to the war or the intensity of feeling for\r\nthe High-Church cause which the Sacheverell affair engendered, would\r\nhave been sufficient to sweep the Whigs from power. Together, and\r\ncombined as they were with the prestige of the Queen's public support\r\nof Harley and the newly appointed Tory Ministers, these issues were\r\nirresistible. Harley found himself with an \"immoderate\" House of\r\nCommons. The Tories held 320 seats, the Whigs only 150, and there were\r\n40 seats whose votes were \"doubtful.\"[2] Many of the new\r\nParliamentarians were High-Church zealots, and most were anxious to\r\nturn the nation away from the policies of the Whig Administration of\r\nGodolphin.\r\n\r\nThe House of Lords, however, remained a bastion of Whig strength. As an\r\nhereditary body the House of Lords was simply not subject to the same\r\nopportunity for change as the elected House of Commons. Consequently,\r\nin 1710, as a result of the Glorious Revolution, the long reign of\r\nWilliam III, and the Godolphin Ministry, the majority of the members of\r\nthe House of Lords were of Whig or Revolution Settlement policies.\r\nTherein lay Harley's problem in late October of 1710: to obtain a Lords\r\nto match the Commons he had been given.\r\n\r\nAny early eighteenth-century Ministry--Whig or Tory--could count on\r\nhaving the support of those peers whose poverty made them dependent on\r\ngovernmental subsidies, but this number would not have given Harley\r\neven a bare majority in the strongly Whig House of Lords. And there\r\nHarley needed at least enough strength to ensure success for some of\r\nthe measures designed to satisfy the demands of the newly Tory House of\r\nCommons, particularly if his Ministry was to be able to negotiate a\r\nsatisfactory treaty of peace with France.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a Tory majority in the House of Lords commensurate with the\r\none in Commons, Harley could have seen to the creation of a sufficient\r\nnumber of new peerages; but this would have alienated too many factions\r\nand the recently completed Union with Scotland (1707) offered what\r\nappeared to be a far simpler expedient. The Act of Union provided for\r\nthe election of sixteen Scottish peers who would represent all of the\r\nScottish nobility in the House of Lords.[3] If he could ensure that all\r\nsixteen of these peers were Tory, Harley would be certain of a large\r\nblock of loyal votes in the upper house, or, at worst, he would have to\r\narrange for the creation of only a few new peers to neutralize the\r\nWhigs' strength. To John Campbell, the second Duke of Argyll, Harley\r\nassigned the task of orchestrating a Tory sweep in this election.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll sat in the House of Lords as the Earl of Greenwich\r\n(an English title), not as one of the elected peers, and, as such, he\r\nwas not elegible to stand as a candidate or to vote in this election.\r\nArgyll had supported the Whig Junto and held the rank of Lieutenant\r\nGeneral under Marlborough in France, but in 1710 (seeing the direction\r\nthe political tide was taking) he abandoned his support of Godolphin's\r\nMinistry. So that, \"by the time the [Sacheverell] Trial was finished,\r\nit was known that the great chief of the Campbells and of the Scottish\r\nWhigs had gone into opposition to the Government [of Godolphin] in\r\nleague with Harley, although he voted for the Doctor's condemnation....\"[4]\r\n\r\nArgyll and the sixteen representative peers (if they were all Tories),\r\ntogether with the votes of those peers who were dependant upon\r\nGovernment subsidies would give the new Ministry of Harley enough votes\r\nin the upper house for almost any eventuality--even the impeachment of\r\nMarlborough. It is possible to speculate that this was the\r\nplum--command of the British armies in Europe--that induced Argyll's\r\nchange from Whig to Tory in 1710. Argyll's jealousy and resentment of\r\nhis commander had been a well known bit of gossip for some time, and it\r\nis very possible that Argyll saw a new Government as his chance to\r\nsteal a march on Marlborough. Although Harley's Ministry did give the\r\nOrder of the Garter to Argyll on 20 December 1710, he was never\r\npromoted over Marlborough, but that was not due to any lack of success\r\nin assuring a Tory victory in the election of the peers. Argyll's\r\nheavy-handed management of that election is the subject of Defoe's\r\n_Atalantis Major_.\r\n\r\nBy birth and education Daniel Defoe was a member of the mercantile\r\nmiddle class. He was a Dissenter and his political and economic\r\nsympathies generally coincided with those of the moderate Whigs. A\r\nlimited monarchy, the destruction of France's commercial empire,\r\nliberty of conscience for Dissenters and Nonconformists, and a\r\nProtestant (that is, Hanover) Succession were the imperatives which lay\r\nbehind much of his political and economic thinking and writing. From as\r\nearly as 1694 he had served William III as a pamphleteer-propagandist\r\nfor the vigorous prosecution of the war with France. After his\r\nfive-month imprisonment in 1703 for writing _The Shortest Way with\r\nDissenters_, Defoe was employed as an agent and pamphleteer of the\r\nGovernment. First, in the service of Robert Harley, Godolphin's\r\nSecretary of State during the early moderate years of the Godolphin\r\nAdministration (1704-08), and thereafter working for Godolphin himself,\r\nDefoe's _Review_ preached the gospel of national unity above party\r\nfaction. When Harley replaced Godolphin as Treasurer in 1710, Defoe\r\nreturned to his service.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may appear from this that Defoe's pen was for hire by\r\nwhichever party was in power, in point of fact, Defoe's political views\r\nwere remarkably congruent with those of both Harley and Godolphin. All\r\nthree were staunch supporters of England's commercial interests, the\r\nHanoverian Succession, liberty of conscience for Dissenters and\r\nNonconformists, and the terms of the Revolution Settlement. It must be\r\nremembered that Godolphin and Harley were both moderates, each trying\r\nto chart his course between the extremes of the parties. They, like\r\nDaniel Defoe, saw their loyalty being to England and to the Queen, not\r\nto a party. Like Defoe, they both discovered that politics often make\r\nstrange bedfellows. Godolphin, faced with a large Whig majority in the\r\nHouse of Commons after the General Election of 1708, found that his\r\nfortunes were bound to those of the Junto. Harley, after the General\r\nElection of 1710, discovered the necessity of courting the High-Church\r\nTories far more than he would have liked.\r\n\r\nArgyll's slate of Scottish peers for the November election included men\r\nwho were even more extreme in their Toryism than the majority of\r\nHigh-Church English Tories. Most of the sixteen were High-Church, many\r\nhad strong Catholic leanings; all of them were against increasing the\r\nreligious liberties of the Scottish Presbyterians (and thus those of\r\nthe English Dissenters and Nonconformists). Several of these peers had\r\nbeen openly professed Jacobites and all were, in some degree,\r\nsympathetic to France. To have men with such beliefs in Parliament\r\nmeant, to Defoe, the chance that Marlborough's victories in France\r\nwould be negotiated away, the loss of what the Toleration Act of 1689\r\nhad gained, and finally, the spector of the Pretender on the throne. In\r\nshort, such men could mean the loss of all that the Revolution and the\r\nwar with France had won. Yet, in the late autumn of 1710, Defoe found\r\nhimself in Edinburgh, the agent and propagandist of the man on whose\r\nbehalf Argyll had engineered the election of men of such politics.\r\n\r\nDefoe's mission in Edinburgh that autumn was to allay the fears of the\r\nPresbyterian clergy and Whig merchants about the new Tory Ministry. His\r\nmessage to them was, in Professor Sutherland's words, that\r\n\r\n    What the country needed ... was steady, moderate men, whether they\r\n    called themselves Whig or Tory, men who would uphold the Protestant\r\n    succession and avoid extreme measures; and that on the whole was\r\n    what it had now got [appearances to the contrary notwithstanding].\r\n    The Ministry was not going to give way to the clamours of the High\r\n    Tory rank and file; and the Queen would certainly not countenance\r\n    any form of persecution.[5]\r\n\r\nIn short, Defoe was charged with convincing his Scottish friends and\r\nassociates (and, by means of the _Review_, the nation at large) the\r\nopposite of all that Argyll's actions and words bespoke of Harley's\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\nDefoe wrote Harley from Edinburgh on 18 November (eight days after the\r\nelection of the peers) to voice his dismay at the tactics that had been\r\nused by Argyll. By them his own mission on Harley's behalf had been\r\nimpaired:\r\n\r\n    I hint this Sir to Confirm my Censure of the Conduct aforesaid as\r\n    Imprudent and as what has rendred [sic] the quieting these people,\r\n    which was Easy before, Very Difficult now.[6]\r\n\r\nFurther, he suggests that Harley's heretofore moderate allies, the\r\nSquadrone, have been pushed by Argyll into league with the old Court\r\nParty that had supported the Godolphin Ministry. This letter also\r\ncontains a brief summary of the main events which were to form the plot\r\nof _Atalantis Major_, but it does not attack Argyll with the same\r\nbitterness that the longer work does. Defoe writes:\r\n\r\n    In the late Election, the Conduct of the D of 60 [Argyll], the E of\r\n    163 [Islay], and the Earle of 194 [Mar] is Very Perticular....\r\n    [They] Declared Openly [that] the Quallification of those to be\r\n    Chosen ... [was] their agreeing to Impeach 140 [Godolphin] and 193\r\n    [Marlborough], Nor did the Impudence End there, but On all\r\n    Occasions to Say in So Many Words They had her Majties Orders to\r\n    Choose Such and Such and it must be don: This was So abandonning\r\n    all Reserves, that it has disgusted the Generallity, and has Put\r\n    them Upon Measures of Uniteing, which may shut the door upon all\r\n    future Measures, what Ever the Occasion may be....\r\n\r\n    Now they have Returnd their Number, it were to be Wished they Could\r\n    have Avoided a few who are Declar'd profest Jacobites, Such as 197\r\n    [Marischal], Kilsyth, Blantire, Hume &c. who are known to aim in\r\n    all they do at the Pretender, and whose being Now Chosen has many\r\n    ill Effects here What Ever may be as to Over-ruleing them in\r\n    England, I mean as to Encreasing the Insolence of Jacobitisme in\r\n    the North, where its Strength is far from being Contemptible.[7]\r\n\r\nWhat Defoe hoped to obtain from Harley by this and succeeding letters\r\non this subject is not clear. He may have been seeking Harley's public\r\nrepudiation of the Jacobite peers, or at least some private assurances\r\nthat what Argyll had told the peers did not represent the new\r\nMinistry's policies. Whatever it was he sought, by late December it was\r\nobviously not forthcoming from Harley or his Ministry. And on 20\r\nDecember Argyll was made a Knight of the Garter. It was during this\r\nDecember that the bulk of _Atalantis Major_ was written, most probably\r\nbetween 30 November and 26 December. On 26 December 1710 Defoe wrote\r\nHarley of the existence of \"Two Vile Ill Natur'd Pamphlets ... both of\r\nwhich have fallen into My hands in Manuscript, and I think I have\r\nprevented both their Printing. The first Was advertised in the Gazette\r\nhere and Called the Scots atalantis[8] ... The Other Pamphlet is called\r\n_Atalantis Major_.\" The letter concludes with a short description of\r\nthe work, a disavowal of any knowledge of its authorship, and the hope\r\nthat he can suppress its publication:\r\n\r\n    The Other Pamphlet is called _Atalantis Major_; and is a Bitter\r\n    Invective against the D of Argyle, the E of Mar, and the Election\r\n    of the Peers. It is Certainly Written by Some English man, and I\r\n    have Some Guess at the Man, but dare not be positive. I have\r\n    hitherto kept this also from the Press, and believe it will be\r\n    Impossible for them to get it printed here after the Measures I\r\n    have Taken. The Party I Got it of pretends the Coppy Came from\r\n    England, But I am of Another Opinion. I shall Trouble you no\r\n    farther about it because if possible I can get it Coppyed, I will\r\n    Transmit the Coppy by Next post, for I have the Originall in My\r\n    hand. They Expect I shall Encourage and assist them in the\r\n    Mannageing it, and Till I can Take a Coppy I shall not Undeciev\r\n    them.[9]\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Harley doubted Defoe's disclaimer\r\nor that Defoe sent the copy to Harley.\r\n\r\nSince Defoe was back in London on 13 February 1711, _Atalantis Major_\r\nmust have been seen through the press sometime between 26 December and\r\nthe end of January, not, as Moore lists it, \"before 26 December\r\n1710.\"[10] Internal evidence suggests an even narrower range of\r\nprobable dates of publication. The last four pages of _Atalantis Major_\r\ndeal with the Duke of Argyll being given command of the English forces\r\nin Spain and the singular lack of grace with which he undertook this\r\ncommand. Since Argyll was not given command of the Peninsula campaign\r\nuntil 11 January 1711, it could not be until after this date that the\r\nmanuscript could have been finished and printed.\r\n\r\nThe work bears few signs of being hastily printed. There are only nine\r\ntypographical errors,[11] and four of these are catchwords. There is no\r\nevidence to suggest that there was more than one printing of the\r\npamphlet,[12] and the use of several Scotticisms[13] seems to offer\r\nsupport for the contention that the pamphlet was intended for a\r\nprimarily Scottish audience.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lee was the first to ascribe the work to Defoe, and this\r\nascription has been accepted by both Dottin and Moore.[14] The evidence\r\nfor assigning this work to Defoe seems to rest on the two letters to\r\nHarley quoted above. Another proof of Defoe's authorship of _Atalantis\r\nMajor_ is to be found in the remark it contains, \"That the Southern\r\nPart of the Island [that is, England] was the most remarkable of any,\r\nas to the Policy of their Government, and the Character of the People;\r\nand excepting _Englishmen_ and _Polanders_, there is not such another\r\nNation in the World\" (p. 12). In 1704 Defoe had written _The Dyet of\r\nPoland_, a poem in which he had made a similar unflattering comparison\r\nbetween England and Poland. A far more substantial case for Defoe's\r\nauthorship can be made from the existence of the anecdote of John\r\nWhite, Edinburgh's hangman, in both a letter to Harley (18 November\r\n1710) and the _Review_ (for 30 November 1710), as well as in _Atalantis\r\nMajor_ (pp. 22-3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKey to Names and Characters in _Atalantis Major_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the thinly disguised allegory of _Atalantis Major_, _Atalantis_ is,\r\nof course, Britain. _Olreeky_, or _Old Reeky_, or simply _Reeky_, is\r\nstill used as an affectionate local term for the city of Edinburgh,\r\nprone as it is to be enshrouded in mists and smoke in the early\r\nmorning. _Tartary_ is France, and the French are referred to as either\r\nthe _Tartarians_ or the _Barbarians_. Jacobites are also indicated by\r\nthe name _Tartarians_, since the Pretender's cause was actively\r\nsupported by Louis XIV. _Japan_ is Spain and _China_ stands for\r\nHolland. The characters who appear in _Atalantis Major_ are (in the\r\norder that they are mentioned):\r\n\r\n    _The Duke de Sanquarius_ (p. 14) is James Douglas, second Duke of\r\n    Queensberry and Duke of Dover (1662-1711);\r\n\r\n    _The Earl of Stairdale_ (p. 15) is John Dalrymple, second Earl of\r\n    Stair (1673-1747);\r\n\r\n    _The Earl of Crawlinfordsay_ (p. 16) is John Lindsay, nineteenth\r\n    Earl of Crawford (d. 1713);\r\n\r\n    _The Prince of Greeniccio of the ancient Blood of Argyllius_ (p.\r\n    17) is John Campbell, second Duke of Argyll, Baron Chatham and Earl\r\n    of Greenwich (1678-1742);\r\n\r\n    _The Earl of Marereskine_ (p. 18) is John Erskine, eleventh Earl of\r\n    Mar of the Erskine line (1675-1732);\r\n\r\n    _The Prince de Heymuthius_ (p. 18) is John Churchill, first Duke of\r\n    Marlborough and Baron Churchill of Aymouth (1650-1722);\r\n\r\n    _The Earl of Dolphinus_ (p. 18) is Sidney Godolphin (1645-1712);\r\n\r\n    _Bellcampo, Lord of the Isles_ (p. 19) is Archibald Campbell, first\r\n    and only Earl of Islay (pronounced \"Isle-ah\") and brother and heir\r\n    of the second Duke of Argyll (1682-1761);\r\n\r\n    _One of the Ministers_ (p. 22) is Thomas Miller of Kirkliston;\r\n\r\n    _John ----, his Majesty's Hangman_ (p. 22) is John White;\r\n\r\n    _Bradalbino_ (p. 24) is John Campbell, first Earl of Breadalbane\r\n    (1635-1716);\r\n\r\n    _Leslynus_ (p. 24) is David Leslie, third Earl of Leven\r\n    (1660-1728);\r\n\r\n    _One of the family of Boiilio_ (p. 24) is David Boyle, first Earl\r\n    of Glasgow (1666-1733);\r\n\r\n    _The Prince de Rosymonte_ (p. 34) is James Graham, fourth Marquis\r\n    and first Duke of Montrose (d. 1742).\r\n\r\nThe fact that, in several cases, the names used by Defoe are developed\r\nfrom family names and not the title seems to offer support for the\r\ncontention that _Atalantis Major_ was intended primarily for a Scottish\r\naudience. Further, Defoe's name for Marlborough--_Heymuthius_--comes\r\nfrom his one Scottish title, Baron Aymouth (now Eyemouth, a fishing\r\ntown on the southeast coast of Scotland), and not from his better-known\r\nEnglish title, the Duke of Marlborough.\r\n\r\nState University College\r\nBrockport, New York\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES TO THE INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n 1.

In point of fact, Harley's concern for the loyalty of the\r\nrepresentative peers is unique in the history of these elections. In\r\nsubsequent Parliaments, the Scottish peers seldom, if ever, voted\r\nagainst the Government--even at the trial of Lord Lovat in 1745-6. For\r\none thing, almost without exception, the representative peers were\r\ndependent on governmental subsidies and this dependence increased\r\nduring the course of the eighteenth century (see J. H. Plumb, _The\r\nGrowth of Political Stability in England_ [London: Penguin, 1973], p.\r\n180; and Geoffrey Holmes, _British Politics in the Age of Anne_\r\n[London: Macmillan, 1967], p. 393). The practice of electing a\r\nrepresentative peerage for Scotland was discontinued after 1782 (see\r\nTrevelyan, _op. cit._, 235).\r\n\r\n 4. Trevelyan, _op. cit._, 58.\r\n\r\n 5. James R.

Hence, Gratitude is not the\r\nnational Virtue, nor is encouraging Virtue any Branch of the\r\nManufacture of the Place; long Services often meet here with unjust\r\nCensures; overgrown Merit with necessary Contempt: He must be a bold\r\nMan that dares oblige them; he is sure to provoke them by it to use him\r\nvery severely.\r\n\r\nIf they are reduc'd to any extreme Distress, he must be weary of his\r\nLife that Attempts to rescue them from the Danger; he is as sure to Die\r\nfor it as they are sure to be Unjust: It is Natural to the Blood of the\r\nRace, if they are obliged beyond the Power of Payment, they presently\r\nhate, because they scorn to be in Debt. Hence also Benefactors are the\r\nmost abhorr'd People in the World, they Walk always alone, for every\r\nMan keeps at a distance from them.\r\n\r\nIf a Man happens to be bound Apprentice to his own generous Spirit, and\r\nresolves to do them good, he must do it to God, to do it to them is to\r\nwork to the Devil; he must be sure to run the Gauntlet, and bear the\r\nLashes of Ten thousand Tongues, the Reproach of all those he serves,\r\nand will Die unpitied.\r\n\r\nIf ever they do relent, if ever they acknowledge Services, 'tis always\r\nafter the Man is dead, that he may not upbraid them with it. An eminent\r\ngreat Man among them, and rich to a Prodigy, had been almost drowned,\r\nbut was taken up in the Interval by a poor Man; when he came to\r\nhimself, he gave the poor Man Six-pence, but could never abide the\r\nsight of him after: The poor Man afterwards had the Dissaster of being\r\ndrowned himself, and then the rich Man bewail'd that he had not made\r\nhim a better Return, wherefore, in abundant Gratitude, he settled upon\r\nthe Widow and her Six Children, a noble Pension of 20 _s. per Annum_.\r\n\r\nIt was a saying of One of their great and wise Men, of a poor Servant\r\nthat had saved his Life; he saved my Life, _said he_, and therefore I\r\nhate to see him, for it is an intolerable Life to have always a\r\nCreditor in my Sight that I cannot ballance Accounts with.\r\n\r\nBut all this is by the By. The Inhabitants of this Great Island are,\r\nthose things excepted, a Noble, Gallant, Ancient, Wealthy People; and a\r\nStranger may very well winter among them. I could say more in their\r\nPraise but the ensuing History calls me off from that Subject.\r\n\r\nThere happen'd in that famous Island, when I was last there, an\r\nOccasion upon some State Affairs to assemble an extraordinary Council\r\nof the Nobility, to consult together with the Sovereign; whole\r\nHereditary Councellors they were by the Constitution of the Place:\r\nThese were not chosen by the Inhabitants, as in such Cases among us our\r\nParliament Men are chosen; but were by Birth and Blood, or by\r\nDignities, High-Offices, _&c._ entitled to sit in the aforesaid\r\nCouncil, except one Part of the Island, who had by some former\r\nConstitution been a several distinct Government, and had a certain\r\nNumber of Nobility of their own. This Part having by some ancient\r\nTreaty been join'd to the other, their whole Nobility were not\r\nintituled to the Right of sitting in Council as above; but they usually\r\nmet by themselves upon such Occasions, and chose a certain Number to\r\nrepresent the whole Body. This Number was, as near as I can remember,\r\nSixteen or thereabouts, not reckoning some who were singled out by the\r\nSovereign to be advanc'd by new Titles, to be Members of the Great Body\r\nof the Hereditary Nobility; a Favour, which by the Stipulations of the\r\nsaid Agreement, was reserv'd to the Sovereign of that whole Island.\r\n\r\nNow there happening, as I have noted, an Occasion to assemble this\r\nGreat Council; the Nobility of that Part of the Island which were thus\r\nparticularly constituted, behoved to meet, _as said is_, to elect the\r\nNumber that were to represent them in the great Assembly; and the\r\nHistory of that Meeting having so many strange Circumstances in it, and\r\nmaking so much Noise in that Country, it cannot but be useful for us to\r\nbe inform'd of it.\r\n\r\nThe Nobility of that Island, as I find it too much the Fate of all the\r\nNobility in the World, were unhappily divided into Factions and\r\nseparate Interests, and therefore before I proceed to the Relation, it\r\nwill be necessary to give you a brief Account of these several\r\nDivisions, and as to the Characters of the Persons, it will necessarily\r\nfall into the Course of the Story.\r\n\r\nThe Divisions and Animosities which, as I say, were among the Nobility,\r\nwere very unhappily occasion'd upon two several Foundations, and\r\ntherefore consisted of two several Kinds.\r\n\r\nThis Island, it seems, was govern'd by a very glorious Queen, who\r\nhowever she was of the ancient Royal Blood of that Country, was yet for\r\nReasons more especially respecting the Safety of the Country, plac'd\r\nupon the Throne by the Suffrage of the Nobility and People, without\r\nRegard to her Father or his Male Children, who for like Reasons of\r\nSafety they had Depos'd and render'd incapable: There being, it seems a\r\nPower reserv'd by the Constitution of that Place, to the said Nobility\r\nand People so to do a thing so like what we call in _England_\r\nParliamentary Limitation, that it gives me great Reason to think the\r\nPower of Parliaments limiting the Crown is a natural Principle, and\r\nfounded upon meer Original Light, since it should be so exactly\r\nestablish'd in a Country so remote and so entirely excluded from\r\nCorrespondence with _Europe_, as this of the Island of _Atalantis_.\r\n\r\nThe Queen of this Island, by the Assistance of exquisite Councellors,\r\nPunctual Management, and a mild merciful Administration, had obtain'd\r\nthe entire Affection of Her Subjects at Home, and as long as she\r\ncontinued the Administration in those Hands she preserv'd that\r\nAffection very entire to herself; She had also, by the Conduct of\r\neminent and most glorious Commanders, rendered her self Victorious\r\nabroad, in a long, terrible and expensive War, against the barbarous\r\n_Tartarian_ Emperor, whose growing Greatness, had forced her\r\nPredecessor, in Conjunction with several neighbouring Nations, to have\r\nrecourse to Arms, to keep up a Ballance of Power in that Part of the\r\nWorld, as long as those fortunate Generals commanded, her Affairs were\r\nblest by Sea and Land; till the _Barbarians_ began to stoop their\r\nPride, to be humbled, and they sought Peace, made great Offers of\r\nrestoring the Kingdoms they had usurped, and of establishing a lasting\r\nTranquillity in those Parts of the World.\r\n\r\nHow the Face of Affairs there altered, how some Factions prevailing at\r\nHome, made a Breach in all this blessed Harmony, how the faithful\r\nCouncellors at Home were dismiss'd and disgrac'd, the victorious\r\nGenerals Abroad ill used and ungratefully treated, by which the Publick\r\nCredit sunk at Home, the great Confederates of this glorious Queen were\r\ndiscouraged and allarmed, the _Barbarians_ encouraged to hold out,\r\ncarry on the War, and reject the Terms of Peace, they would before have\r\ncomplied with: These are Things perhaps my stay in that Place not\r\npermitting me to get a full Account of, much less see the Issue of, I\r\nshall for the present omit, perhaps my next Voyage may more fully\r\nquallifie me to inform you.\r\n\r\nMy present Relation refers more especially to the Affair of the\r\nElection of those representing Nobles, which, as before, the Northern\r\nPart of the Island, by a late Treaty of Coalition, were obliged to send\r\nup as often as the Soveraign of the Country thought fit to Summon her\r\nHereditary Council to meet, which Summons was generally once in Three\r\nYears.\r\n\r\nTo let you into the Nature of the unhappy Strife which is the Subject\r\nof my present Relation, it may be necessary to descend to a Historical\r\nRelation of some Facts for a few Years past, and to give the Characters\r\nof some Persons who have the principal Conduct in the present Affairs.\r\n\r\nThere had been a Contention in the last Election in the same Place, (we\r\nshall go no further back) of something of the like Nature with this;\r\nwherein the same Heat was unhappily breaking out against the Friends\r\nand Favourites of the great Queen of the Island, as had now come to a\r\nfull height; it is too true, That the Factions which then agitated the\r\nNobility being between the Court-Party then so called, and a flying\r\nSquadron of Noblemen, who were of the same general Denomination with\r\nthemselves, that Breach tended so much to the dividing their Interest,\r\nthat they could never effectually joyn it again, they made that\r\nSeperation of Affection then which they could never unite, let in those\r\nEnemies then which they could never get removed again, brought those\r\nCharges and Accusations against one another then which their Enemies\r\nhave since made use off, and which they cannot now deny but are fatal\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThe Parties are so naturally resembling our unhappy Divisions in\r\n_Britain_, have been so exactly pursued by our Methods, are so properly\r\nadapted to Persons as well as Things, so alike in Temper, Manners,\r\nManagement and Design, to our Parties, of _Tory_, _Whig_, _High\r\nChurch_, _Low Church_, _Old Whig_, _New Whig_, _High Flyer_,\r\n_Dissenter_, _Jacobite_, _Court_, _Country_, _Revolution_, _Union_, and\r\nthe like. That to give the more lively Representation of them to your\r\nMinds, and to avoid the barbarous Words used in the Country, where the\r\nLanguage is altogether unknown to us, and unlike ours, I shall even\r\ncall them by the same Names, giving a brief Description as I go on, and\r\nalways desiring you to add a Subintelligitur for the word _Atalantick_\r\nto them all; as the _Atalantick Whigs_, _Atalantick Tories_,\r\n_Atalantick High Church_, and so of all the rest: And whenever you meet\r\nwith the Names or Distinctions of _Whig_, _Tory_, _High Church_, _Low\r\nChurch_, _&c._ in this Discourse, the Author provides against any other\r\nSuggestion or Meaning, than that of the _Whigs_, _Tories_, _High\r\nChurch_, _Low Church_, _Old Whig_, _New Whig_, _High Flyers_,\r\n_Dissenters_, _Jacobites_, _&c._ who are Inhabitants of the famous\r\nIsland of _Atalantis Major_, situate beyond the North Cape, between the\r\nDegrees of 42 and 80 of Northern Latitude, as you sail from _China_\r\ninto _Europe_, by the Streights of _Nassau_, the Island of _Nova\r\nZembla_, (if it be an Island) and the like, being what we call the\r\nNorth-East Passages: And you cannot blame me for being thus Particular\r\nin this early Protestation, if you consider how ready the Men of this\r\nAge are to Censure, Condemn and Reproach, the Meaning of Authors,\r\nwhether they themseves have any meaning or no. If any Man shall presume\r\nto say, there is no such Place, I may as readily answer their\r\nPresumption, by another less Criminal, _viz._ That they never have past\r\nthat Way to _China_, and consequently cannot demonstrate the Truth of\r\nwhat they say.\r\n\r\nHaving thus premised what I think necessary, to fence this Work against\r\nthe Malice of the Times, I am next to tell you, That I shall confine\r\nthis Part of my Account to the Transactions of the Northern Part of\r\nthis great Island, and therein to what happened in this Case of the\r\nElection of their Noble Councellors only; yet I must Hint a little at\r\nwhat had been transacting in the Southern Parts of the Island; and this\r\nis absolutely necessary, in order to make the other Accounts\r\nintelligible.\r\n\r\nIn order to this, you are to understand, That the Southern Part of the\r\nIsland was the most remarkable of any, as to the Policy of their\r\nGovernment, and the Character of the People; and excepting _Englishmen_\r\nand _Polanders_, there is not such another Nation in the World: Here\r\nthey reckoned about Fifty three several Sects, Divisions, and espoused\r\nOpinions in Religion, upon most of the Heads whereof the People\r\nactually seperated from one another; such as, (1.) _Churchmen_, and\r\namong them _High Church_, _Low Church_, _Non Jurors_, _Prelatists_,\r\n_Socinians_, _Arians_, _Arminians_, _Deists_, _Atheists_,\r\n_Immoralists_, _Flyers_, _Soul-Sleepers_, _Prophets_, _&c._ (2.)\r\n_Presbyterians_, and under that head all kind of Dissenters,\r\n_Cameronians_, _Independants_, _Anabaptists_, _Baptists_,\r\n_Seventh-Day-Men_, _Sabatarians_, _Donatists_, _Gnosticks_,\r\n_Antiprelatists_, _Muggletonians_, and various undistinguishable\r\n_Quakers_ both wet and dry, _Sweet Singers_, _Family of Love_,\r\n_Christian Jews_, _Jewish Christians_, and the like. In the State, the\r\nDivisions were no less Fatal, or the variety greater in Proportion,\r\nthese we may, as I said before, call by the Names which the like\r\nFactions are distinguish'd by here; such as _Tory_, _Whig_, _Low\r\nChurch_, _Hot_ _Whig_, _Old Whig_, _Modern Whig_, _High Flyer_, _High\r\nChurch_, _High Tory_, a _Gillicranky_, a _Tantivy_, _Tackers_, _Non\r\nJurors_, _Assassinators_, _Junto's_, _Squadroni_, _Court_, _Country_,\r\n_Revolutionists_, _Non Resisters_, _Passive Obedience Men_, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nYou may understand, that the Queen of the Island had thought fit to\r\nchange Hands in the Administration just before I came there, and tho'\r\nit was given out that the change would not be from what we call here a\r\nWhig to a Tory Ministry, in effect it past for no other, especially for\r\nthat the Whigs were generally laid by in every publick Matter, and the\r\nTories, or at least such as had appear'd with them were all taken in.\r\n\r\nAmong the Persons turn'd out of Employ, or very much envy'd in it, we\r\nfind two great Personages, Men of the greatest Eminency in their\r\nStation that the Age had produc'd in that Island, their Country had no\r\nError to find in their Conduct except it were that it was so much in\r\ndebt to their Services, that they could not be capable of rewarding it,\r\ntherefore like the corrupted Nature of the whole Race of Man, they hate\r\nthe Men, as a late Author says, because they hate to be in debt beyond\r\nthe Power of Payment.\r\n\r\nOne of these presided over the Treasure, the other over the Army, and\r\nexcept what may have happen'd since those days, their very Enemies had\r\nnot been able to assign any Reason from their own Behaviour, why they\r\ndismist them. Of these more in the Process of the Story.\r\n\r\nFor the present it shall suffice to tell you, without other Preamble,\r\nboth these were by the Artifice of their Enemies, dispossess'd of the\r\nQueen of the Island's Favour, and that with them fell the Juncto's and\r\nSquadrons of their Friends in most Part of the Southern _Atalantis_.\r\n\r\nIn the North Part of the Island the Divisions of the Court had not\r\nextended so far, at least they had not been push'd so vigorously, the\r\ngreat Officers kept their Posts, whether Civil or Military, not the\r\nleast Alteration was made, except of a few inferiour Officers, and\r\nthose but casually; all seem'd to stand at a Stay till the Election of\r\nthe noble Councellors aforesaid, and till the sitting of the great\r\nCouncil, as above.\r\n\r\nThere were some of the Nobility of these Northern Parts that had very\r\nmuch the Favour of their Prince, and by whom she had always been\r\ndirected in those things that related to that Part of Her Dominions,\r\nThese were,\r\n\r\n1. The Duke _de Sanquarius_, a Northern Prince of great Reputation who\r\nhad the principal Trust in the Management of the late Coalition, which,\r\nas is noted already, had formerly been made between this Northern Part\r\nof the Island and the Southern. This Prince was a Person of great\r\nPrudence and Policy, perfect Master of the Interest, Temper and\r\nConstitution of the Country and People; great and as a Master of his\r\nown Passions, that had an Insight into Persons as well as things, and\r\nwas, without Dispute, the best qualify'd to manage that uneasy People,\r\nof any Man in that Part of the Island: He had a leading Interest among\r\nthem, and us'd it with such Temper and such Clearness of Judgment, as\r\nseldom failed to bring to pass whatever he undertook. He was Viceroy in\r\nthe great Meeting of the States of that Country, several times; in\r\nwhich he behav'd to the Satisfaction of his Sovereign and the general\r\nGood, even to the Confession of his Enemies, after the separate\r\nGovernment of that Part of the Island ceas'd he was receiv'd very\r\ngraciously by the Queen, and made principal Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n2. The Earl of _Stairdale_ was another, a Nobleman of extraordinary\r\nMerit, distinguish'd for a thousand good Qualities; affable, generous,\r\nexceeding curteous, steddy in a sound Principle, wise above his Age,\r\nbrave above his Neighbours. His Family had been famous for the Gown, he\r\nwas like to make it more so by the Sword: He had at this time a very\r\nhonourable Command in the Armies of _Atalantis Major_, and being the\r\nsame thing as we call a Lieutenant General, was employed against the\r\n_Tartarians_.\r\n\r\n3. The Earl of _Crawlinfordsay_ a Nobleman of a most ancient Race,\r\nbeing the first of his Degree in the whole _Atalantis Major_, an\r\nhonest, bold, gallant Person; he had so much Goodness in his Temper,\r\nCourage in his Heart, and Honesty in his Face, that made all Men love\r\nhim; he was true to his Sovereign, and tho' his Fortunes too depended\r\nupon the _Court_, being Captain of the Queen's Guards, yet so true to\r\nhis Honour, that he scorn'd to sacrifice his Principle to his Interest;\r\nhad too much Courage to be bully'd, and too much Honesty to be brib'd;\r\ntoo much Wit to be wheedl'd and too much Warmth to forbear telling it\r\nin the Teeth of those that try'd all those ways to bring him into their\r\nParty.\r\n\r\n4. The Prince of _Greeniccio_ of the ancient Blood of _Agyllius_. This\r\nwas a young Nobleman of great Hopes, and from whom great things were\r\nexpected, an account of the very Race he was descended from. Had he\r\ninherited the Principles of his Family as he did the Honour and Estate,\r\nhe must have been the Head of that very Party he now acted against,\r\nbeing the same for whose Cause two of his greatest Ancestors at least\r\nhad both ventured and lost their Lives, but Grace not going by\r\nGeneration, nor Vertue by Inheritance any more in that Country than in\r\nours. He neither own'd their Cause or imitated their Vertue, but gave\r\nhimself up first to all Manner of Vice, and then with his Morals\r\nabandoned his Principles, flew in the Face of his Grandfathers injured\r\n_Grave_, join'd with his Murtherers, and the abhorr'd Betrayers of his\r\nCountry, and plac'd himself at the Head of that very Party who had\r\ntrampled on the Blood of his Family as well as Nation. He was in Temper\r\nbrave but rash, had more Courage than Generosity, more Passion than\r\nPrudence, and more Regard to his Resentment than to his Honour; he was\r\nproud without Merit, ambitious without Prospect, revengeful without\r\nInjury; he would resent without Affront, and quarrel without Cause,\r\nwould embroil himself without Reason, and come out of it without\r\nHonour: His Courage was rather in his Blood than in his Head, and as\r\nhis Actions run often before his Thoughts, so his Thoughts often run\r\nbefore his Reason; yet he was pushing and that supply'd very much his\r\nWant of Policy; but he discover'd the Errors of his Judgment by the\r\nWarmth of his Behaviour in every thing he did he sought no Disguise,\r\nevery Man knew him better than himself, and he never could be in a Plot\r\nbecause he conceal'd nothing.\r\n\r\nHe was a General in the Armys of _Atalantis Major_ and excepting the\r\nchief Command of an Army, was very well fitted for the Field: He had\r\nbehav'd himself very well on several Occasions against the\r\n_Tartarians_, and unless his ill Fate should place him above being\r\ncommanded, he might in time be a great Man; at present, having all the\r\nFire of a General without the Flegm, his great Misfortune and the only\r\nThing that can ruin him is, That he thinks himself qualifyed to\r\nCommand, and cannot bear the Lustre of their Merit that excel him.\r\n\r\n5. The E. of _Marereskine_: This was a Nobleman whose Character is not\r\nso easy to describe; he appear'd in the Service of the Queen of the\r\nIsland, but was suspected to lean to the _Tartars_, whose Interest he\r\nwas known formerly to espouse; He was proud, peevish, subtle and\r\ndiligent, affected more the Statesman than the Soldier, and therefore\r\naim'd at the Place the Duke _de Sanquharius_ enjoy'd of Secretary of\r\nState, but had not yet had his Ambition gratifyed.\r\n\r\nYou are to note also that the Queen of the Island had for several Years\r\ncommitted the Administration of her Affairs to two extraordinary\r\nPersons, Natives of the South Parts of the Island. The Prince _de\r\nHeymuthius_ and the E. of _Dolphinus_, their Characters may be confin'd\r\nto this: In short, the first commanded all the Armies of _Atalantis\r\nMajor_, and was Captain General and Commander in Chief; the other, High\r\nKeeper of the Treasury of the Island, the greatest General and the\r\ngreatest Minister of State the Island ever knew, who had raised the\r\nGlory of their Mistress, and the Honour of their Country, to the\r\ngreatest Pitch the Age has ever seen; whose Merit I can no more\r\ndescribe than the Nation can requite.\r\n\r\nTho' these Characters seem to take up too much room in this Tract, yet\r\nit could not be avoided, it being impossible to let you into a true\r\nNotion of the Farce that was acted afterwards if the Actors had not\r\nbeen thus described.\r\n\r\n_Greeniccio_ was a Peer of the whole Island, and therefore had no Vote\r\nin the Northern Election, being one of the Hereditary Council\r\naforesaid; but taking upon him the absolute Direction of the Affair,\r\ntho' he had really, as above, nothing to do with it, he rendred himself\r\nat the City Reeky, the Capital of that Part of the Kingdom a few Days\r\nbefore the Election.\r\n\r\n_Marereskine_, who had really a Voice in the Election, was there before\r\nhim, and had busily embark'd _Bellcampo_, Lord of the Isles, and\r\nBrother to _Greeniccio_, to make Parties, and prepare Parties,\r\nsollicite Votes, get Proxies, and the like, about the Countries.\r\n\r\nThis _Bellcampo_, Lord of the Isles, was an insinuating self-interested\r\nMan, had little Fortune of his own, but resolved to raise himself which\r\nside soever got upmost: He run with every Stream, kept fair with every\r\nSide, spoke smoothly to all, meant Service to none, his dear Self\r\nexcepted. By this means he got up from one Step to another to some good\r\nEmployments, which his Interest and Diligence procured for him rather\r\nthan his Sincerity; for he was first made a Peer on the Side he now\r\nacted against, and now a Judge acting against the Side made him a Peer,\r\nand the like.\r\n\r\nThese were the Instruments of the Fate of North _Atalantis_;\r\n_Marereskine_ acted one Part, _Greeniccio_ another: And here it is, as\r\nI said before, that the differing Parties, appeared so like our _Whig_\r\nand _Tory_, _Episcopal_ and _Presbyterian_, that I cannot better\r\ndescribe them to you than by the same Names, only with this Difference,\r\nThat all the _Tories_ and _Episcopal_ People in North _Atalantis_ were\r\n_Tartarians_ profestly, and boldly owned themselves for the _Tartarian_\r\nEmperor.\r\n\r\nAnd now the two last mentioned Engines, having acted covertly for some\r\ntime, which they had the better opportunity to do, because they had\r\nboth appeared among the other Party, _which now I'll call Whigs_;\r\nbefore, the first of these carried it stiff and forward when he talked\r\nwith the great Officers, or such Lords as had some Dependance upon the\r\nCourt: He told them of what the Queen expected from them, what was\r\ntheir Duty to do, that they would find it their Interest to do so and\r\nso, that they might consider in Time what they had to do, and the like:\r\nWhen he talk'd with any of the _Whig_ Lords, for there was a Squadron\r\nof them left, that had a great sway yet in the Country, then he would\r\ntalk of him, and Party and Queen, as one Knot, in the plural Number,\r\nmost haughtily, thus: We are resolved to do so and so, and we must have\r\nnone but such or such.\r\n\r\nThe _Lord of the Isles_, at the same time acted his usual Flattery on\r\nboth Sides, insinuating to the _Whigs_, that they were in No Danger;\r\nthat there was not the least Design against them or their Liberties;\r\nthat the Queen was resolved to change Hands, but would not change\r\nPrinciples; that their Church should not be touched, that their\r\nPriviledges should not in the least be infringed, and that they need\r\nnot fear. One time, this Politick Peer, as he would be thought, was\r\nvery handsomely met with, the Story is this, whether designedly or no\r\nit matters not. He was one Day in Company with some of the North\r\n_Atalantis_ Ministers, for there just as here, they have one Church\r\nestablished in the North, and another in the South of the Island; He\r\nused all his Art in persuading the Ministers that they should be easie,\r\nthat they should fear nothing, that there was no Design to give them\r\nthe least Disturbance; that this was a Politick Turn, not a Religious,\r\nand that they should do well to be satisfied, and to satisfie their\r\nPeople that they were in no Danger, and should fear nothing. One of the\r\nMinisters, who had heard him very patiently, but saw easily through all\r\nhis cunning; returns, Thus my Lord, shall I tell your Lordship a Story,\r\nand then he goes on with it. We had in former times, one _John_ ----\r\nwho had the Honour to be his Majesty's Hangman in this City. This good\r\nMan had a most gentle easie Way of executing his Office; for when the\r\npoor People came into his Hands, and were to Die by his Operations, as\r\nmany honest Men did in those cruel Days, (this by the way was home to\r\nhis Lordship, for that this very _John_ cut off his Lordships\r\nGrandfather's Head) all the while he was a fitting Things for the\r\nExecution of his Office, he would smile upon them, talk kindly to them,\r\nbid them not be afraid, Come, come, fear nothing, trust God, and the\r\nlike: Then bringing them to the foot of the Ladder, he would still say,\r\nBe not afraid, come, come, fear nothing, step up one step, do not fear,\r\ntrust in God, and so to another step and another; and just thus he\r\ncarried 'em on, till at last, with the very Words in his Mouth, Fear\r\nnothing, he turn'd them off.\r\n\r\nThe honest Minister made no Application of the Story, much less took\r\nNotice, how his Lordship's own Grandfather not only fell by the same\r\nHangman, but by the same Party that he then espoused: But he had too\r\nmuch Sense, and was too closely touch'd with the Story, not to make the\r\nApplication himself; so he left the Ministers, giving no Reply at all\r\nto the Story.\r\n\r\nThis Story grew so popular, especially being printed by the Reviewer of\r\nthat Country, that the Lord of the Isles could make nothing of his\r\nDesign whenever he talk'd of the good Design of the Party; he was only\r\nlaugh'd at, and bid remember his Grandfathers Hangman; so he became\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nThe Prince _Greeniccio_ and the Earl of _Marereskine_ then took upon\r\nthem the Manegement of the whole Affair. They took publick Apartments\r\nin the Town, kept an affected State, called themselves the Queen's\r\nManagers, and had a Court as great as if they had been really so; they\r\nreceived the Visits of the Nobility with an Air of Majesty, and\r\naffected Gravity; and under this assumed Authority they took upon them\r\nto Closet the Noblemen when they came to pay their Respects to them;\r\nnot to ask who they would give their Votes for, or to sollicit them to\r\nVote for this or that, but in a Style haughty and insolent, especially\r\nto the Men of the greatest Character and Merit.\r\n\r\n_Greeniccio_ had several Ruffles with some of the Nobility, of which it\r\nmay not be amiss to give some Account, because it may be for the\r\nAdvantage of our Nobility to know, how Persons of like Quality in that\r\nCountry can submit to be treated.\r\n\r\n_Bradalbino_, a Nobleman of great Age and Authority in that Island,\r\nexpected to be One of the Sixteen, and was told he was in the List;\r\nwhen he comes to Discourse with the Prince _de Greeniccio_, he tells\r\nhim, Very plainly, That he thought it would be much for the Publick\r\nGood to put in Two or Three Lords, such as _Leslynus_, and one of the\r\nFamily of _Boiilio_, being Men he thought could not properly be left\r\nout, and that if they were in, he would come into all the rest: The\r\nPrince, in a kind of Passion swore, By G--d, not of them; and but for\r\nnaming them, laid aside _Bradalbino_ himself.\r\n\r\nAnother Lord being an Officer in the Army, having the Court List\r\nproposed to him, answered, My Lord you kno' _Leslynus_ is my General\r\nand Commander in Chief, and he could not as he commanded under him but\r\nVote for his General, _&c._ _Greeniccio_ in a fury returns, God d----n\r\nyour General, what do you tell us of Commander in Chief? If that be\r\nall, we shall soon get you another Commander in Chief; you shall Vote\r\nfor none such as he.\r\n\r\nAnother Lord expostulated with him a little to admit such and such with\r\nthe Men he proposed; he answers, My Lord, I am no Hypocrite, I am\r\nabove-board; this is the List we will have; the Q....n approves of it,\r\nand I will have no other; and swearing again, By-G--d, says he, 'Tis\r\nindifferent to me, keep out but the Men we are against; but I will have\r\nno _Go....phin_ Men, no _Ma....bro'_ Men, no Squadron Men, in short, no\r\n_Whigs_ of any Denomination; as for the rest, it is indifferent, any\r\nbut them. How, my Lord, says this Nobleman, What will you take\r\n_Tartarians_, (that is, as our _Jacobites_) rather than the honest\r\nGentlemen that have been so true to the _Atalantic_ Interest: I care\r\nnot what they are, says the Prince, so they be none of these.\r\n\r\nAmong the Noblemen that he used with the most rudeness, was the Earl of\r\n_Crawlindford_: Whether he thought to Insult this faithful Nobleman,\r\nbecause he knew his Fortunes were low, and that he depended on the\r\nCourt; or whether he took this Advantage to use him Ill on Account of\r\nan old Ruffle, in which he having challenged the Earl to Fight; and the\r\nEarl appearing ready to defend his Honour with his Sword; the Prince\r\nashamed of the needless Quarrel, had declin'd it again, and came off\r\nbut, so, so; choosing to risk his Honour rather than his Life; what was\r\nthe Reason, Authors do not agree about; But the Prince used him most\r\nscandalously. The Earl prest him hard, and told him, How he had on all\r\nOccasions shewn himself faithful to the Queen, and to the _Atalantic_\r\nInterest, that he had gone into all such Measures as were for the\r\nService of both, that he thought he had some Claim to be trusted in the\r\nService of his Country.\r\n\r\nThe Prince told him plainly, He might set his Heart at rest, for he\r\nshould not be one. He ask'd him, What Reason was assigned, what\r\nObjections were against him. The Prince, with much more Plainness than\r\nPrudence replies, They knew he was under Obligations to the President\r\nof the Treasure, and the great Commander of the Army; and he did not\r\nknow but they might come to bring a Charge or Impeachment against them\r\nin the great _Atalantic_ Council; and he would have no Body chosen but\r\nsuch as would give their Words they would come into such Measures. The\r\nEarl told him, If any thing could be offered to prove them Guilty, or\r\nany Crimes were made appear, he scorned to be so much obliged to any\r\nMan as not to dare to do Justice; and that he would readily join in an\r\nImpeachment, if there was Reason sufficient to Charge them; and to\r\nrefuse him otherwise, implied, they wanted Crime and just Ground to\r\nform the Impeachment upon, and therefore must choose such a Set of Men\r\nas would Impeach innocent Men blindfold, to please a Party. The Prince\r\ntold him, That the Resolution was to Impeach them, and he would have\r\nnone chosen that would not agree to it. What, right or wrong, my Lord!\r\nsays the Earl; to which the Prince, not suddenly replying, the Earl\r\nwent on, Let what will come of it, and tho' I should lose all, nay,\r\ntho' I were to beg my Bread, I'll never submit to such base Terms, and\r\nso defied him. The Prince told him, It should be the worse for him; and\r\nthere they parted.\r\n\r\nThere was a short Dispute between the Prince and the Earl of\r\n_Stairdale_; but the Earl had so much more Honesty than the Party, and\r\nso much more Sense and Wit than the Prince, that indeed he cared not\r\nmuch to talk to him, but left him to _Mareskine_. He was too hard for\r\nthem both, and having baffled them in Discourse, he was no more to be\r\nBullied by them, than he was to be Wheedled; he told 'em plainly, They\r\nwere betraying their Country, selling and sacrificing the Priviledges\r\nof the Nobility, making themselves Tools to a Party, and giving\r\nthemselves up in a base Manner to the Pleasure of a few Men, who, when\r\nthey had got their Will would contemn them, would love the Folly, but\r\nP....s upon the Fools; and as to their List, he scorn'd to come into\r\nit, or into any of their menacing Measures. This put a short end to\r\ntheir Attempts upon him; and indeed, had the other Lords been advised\r\nby this gallant Gentleman, they had broke all their Schemes; but they\r\nwere not all united in their Resolutions, or equally determined in\r\ntheir Measures.\r\n\r\nThus they went on, _Mareskine_ mannag'd the most mildly; yet he told\r\nthe Nobility of his Acquaintance: That the List was determined, that\r\nthe Q....n expected they should Vote them all: that they would have no\r\nMixtures: that her Majesty would have nothing to do with the _Whig_\r\nLords, but there was other Work to do now than usual: Discoursing with\r\nsome of the Lords, who were G----als in the Army, he told them plainly,\r\nThey had resolved to Impeach the great Commander; and that it could not\r\nbe expected, those who had Commands under him, and were Awed by him,\r\nshould do Justice in that Case. They had often the Question put to\r\nthem, What it was the great Commander, or the Keeper of the Treasure,\r\nhad done, that they were to be Impeach'd for: But they could never be\r\nbrought to offer the least tollerable Reason, except that the Prince\r\n_Greeniccio_ let fall in his Passion sometimes, of which he had no\r\nmanner of Government, That he had used him ill abroad.\r\n\r\nSome, who had more nicely enquired into the Particulars of the ill\r\nUsage which was the Cause of this Resentment, have given the oddest\r\ncontradicting Accounts of it that any History can Parallel: As first,\r\nThat the great Commander had restrained the rashness of this young\r\nHotspur General, who being but a Boy in Experience, compared to the\r\nCommander, was always for pushing into the Heart of _Tartary_ with the\r\nArmy; not considering, That to run up a Hundred Mile into the Country,\r\nand leave the Enemies Towns untaken, and their Armies in a Condition to\r\nRecruit, cut off their Convoys and Communication, and make their\r\nSubsistence impracticable, was the ready way to destroy them, as has\r\nbeen seen by a woful Example in _Spain_. But the General was wiser, and\r\nregarded more the Safety of the Army, and the Honour of his Mistress;\r\nand therefore, by the unanimous Approbation of all the allied Generals,\r\n(for it was not his own single Opinion) and according to the just Rules\r\nof War, went on gradually to take their fortified Towns, and ruin their\r\nDefences on the Frontiers, that at last, he might have a sure and easie\r\nConquest of the rest: This was one Pretence. The second was just the\r\nReverse of this: For at a great Battle with the _Tartarians_, the\r\nCommander having resolved to attack the Enemy in their advantageous\r\nCamp, and having drawn up in Battalia his whole Army, he gives the Post\r\nof Honour to the Prince, appointing him, with a select Body of the best\r\nTroops in the Army, to fall on upon the Right, and Charge the Enemy,\r\nwhile other Generals did the like, and with equal Hazard and more real\r\nDanger, on the Left. There was not a Gentleman in the Enemies Army but\r\nwould have taken this as the greatest Testimony of his General's\r\nEsteem, and would have thought any Man in the Army his mortal Enemy\r\nthat should have gone about to have deprived him of it. Nor was there\r\nany Man in the _Attalantick_ Army, who did not take it as an Evidence\r\nof the great Opinion the Commander had of the Prince's Courage; and all\r\nthe World talked of it as the greatest Honour could possibly be done\r\nthe Prince.\r\n\r\nHad not the Commander taken all needful Care to have him well back'd,\r\nhad he not given him the best Troops in the Army to act under him, had\r\nhe not plac'd a great Body of Horse to support him, had he not equally\r\nprest the Enemy in other Places, to prevent their doubling their\r\nStrength in that Part; had he done any Thing but what a Man of Honour\r\nwould have thought himself obliged by, there might have been some\r\nReason to Object: But to call giving a General a Post of Honour\r\nsacrificing him, because it was attended with Danger, is referr'd to\r\nthe Determination of the Soldierly Part of Mankind. And as it would be\r\nlaught at in _Tartary_, in _France_, and in _Britain_, where such\r\nThings are very seldom heard of; so I can assure the Reader, it was\r\nsufficiently laugh'd at in _Attalantis Major_, and the Prince of\r\n_Greeniccio_ is become most intollerably ridiculous by the taking\r\nNotice of it.\r\n\r\nHence all Men in the Island of _Atalantick Major_ conclude, he has\r\nRashness without Courage, Fury without Honour, Passion without\r\nJudgment, and less regard to his Character than to his Resentment.\r\n\r\nNor has the Vanity of this Prince appeared less in his not sticking\r\nopenly to discover, That he aims at the Command in general; that he\r\nthinks himself equally qualified for a Post of so great Trust, and that\r\nregard is not had to his Merit that he is so long suffered to Serve\r\nunder another; at the same time not enquiring, whether the Allies of\r\nthe Queen would have equal Confidence in him, as in the great\r\nCommander, on whose Judgment, all the Princes and States of the North\r\nhave so much Dependance, to whom they have so chearfully committed\r\ntheir Troops, and under whose Conduct they have had such wonderful\r\nSuccess against the _Tartarian_ Emperor: But it never was this Prince's\r\nTalent to think too much, his Heat was always too volatile, and his\r\nHead too light for his Hands.\r\n\r\nWe have brought him now to the Conclusion of the Affair: Having gone\r\nthrough his Catechizing of the Nobility, in which indeed they of his\r\nown Party appeared of a Temper patient and debased, below the true\r\nSpirit of Noblemen; (at least, God be praised, below the ancient Temper\r\nand Gallantry of the Nobility of _Great Britain_) Having come now to\r\nthe Day for the Choice, which was the 10th Day of their Sixth Month,\r\nbut as I suppose _November_: There appeared at the Place 33 Noblemen,\r\nbesides the 16 which were chosen, and who every one Voted for\r\nthemselves and for one another; so that of about 130 Noblemen, which\r\nthey say are in the North Part of _Attalantis Major_, only 49 appeared.\r\n\r\nThere was a great Meeting of the honest Part of the Nobility, at\r\nanother Place, to consult what was proper to be done in this\r\nnew-fashion'd Way of Proceeding: Some proposed to go down in a Body to\r\nthe Place where the rest were met, and protest against the Illegality\r\nof the Choice; that to impose a List upon the Nobility was not\r\nagreeable to the Nature of a free Choice; and that therefore they\r\nshould protest, That whoever were returned by Virtue of that Meeting,\r\nwere not legally Chosen, and had no right to Sit in the great Council\r\nof the Nobility.\r\n\r\nThis was sound Advice: But unhappily it was not resolved upon; and some\r\nthey say slipt out of the Meeting for fear of Resentment, and went down\r\nand voted, and came up again _incognito_.\r\n\r\nThe rest resolved to send Two of their Number down to the Meeting, and\r\noffer their Service to Vote with them, provided they would declare\r\ntheir Measures: and that those that might be chosen would declare\r\nthemselves for the true _Atalantick_ Succession, against a pretending\r\nClaimant, who was then sheltred among the _Tartarians_: But they could\r\nreceive no Satisfaction even to this so reasonable Request. But the\r\nPrince of _Greeniccio_, who had no right to Vote himself, yet run up\r\nand down, as a Broker, or a Party-Sollicitor, whispering and prompting,\r\nfrom one to another, to Influence and Settle them, (for some began to\r\nwaver.) This Prince, I say, giving an answer, insolent and haughty,\r\n_like himself_. The Noble Persons that went, came away, and contented\r\nthemselves, with telling them, they would having nothing to do with\r\nthem. Thus, being but a Rump of the Nobility, they gave up their\r\nLiberties, Voted as they were commanded to do, signed a Roll of Names,\r\nand this they called a Choice.\r\n\r\nThe Number of the dissenting Nobility were about Twenty six, whereof\r\nFive did at last comply with their List, as they thought, being in\r\npublick Commands, supposing it might give a Handle to their Enemies, to\r\nmisrepresent them to their Soveraign; but they nevertheless, upon all\r\nOccasions, testified their Dislike and Abhorrence of the Method, and of\r\nthe Conduct of those concern'd in it.\r\n\r\nAmong those said Dissenters, were Two Dukes, One Marquis, Sixteen\r\nEarls, and Six Lords, besides many others, who were Absent.\r\n\r\nWe might be large in describing, and giving Characters of these\r\ndissenting Nobility. Among them we could not escape the Prince _de\r\nRosymonte_, a Person, for Blood and Birth, eminent in that Country,\r\nmore for his own excellent and inimitable Virtues, Grave, Sober,\r\nJudicious, even from his Youth, of whom one of the _Atalantick_ Poets\r\ngave this bright Character.\r\n\r\n    _Grave without Age, without Experience wise._\r\n\r\nHe was President of the Royal Council of that Country even while he was\r\nvery young, an Honour the greatest of the Nobility were well pleased to\r\nsee him adorned with, and made no Scruple to sit below him: His\r\ndistinguish'd Modesty and Humility in all his publick Appearances,\r\nrecommends him to the Affections of the whole Country; and tho' the\r\nFortunes of his Family have suffered by the Disasters of the Times, yet\r\nhe supports a handsome Figure suitable to the Dignity of his Character,\r\nRich without Gaiety, Great without Affectation, Plentiful without\r\nProfusion, letting the World see he knows how and when, and to what\r\nPitch to appear that when he pleases to be at Large, he can do it like\r\na wise Man, or Retrench, he can do it like a Prince. It might be said,\r\nas a finishing stroke to his Character, he is just the Reverse of\r\n_Greeniccio_, for he is Fire without Thunder, Brave without Fury, Great\r\nwithout Pride, Gay without Vanity, Wise without Affectation, knows how\r\nto Obey and how to Command; he knows great Things enough to manage\r\nthem, and is so Master of himself, as not to let them manage him; he\r\nknows how to be a Courtier without Ambition, and to Merit Favour rather\r\nthan to seek it; he scorns to push his Fortunes over the Belly of his\r\nPrinciples, ever Faithful to himself, and by consequence to all that\r\nTrust him; he has too great a Value for Merit to envy it even in his\r\nEnemy, and too low Thoughts of the Pride and Conceit of Men without\r\nMerit, to approve of it even in his Friends.\r\n\r\nThis Noble Person appears at the Head of the dissenting Nobility: Nor\r\ndoes it lessen his Zeal for the Principles of Liberty, or the present\r\nEstablishment of Religion in his Country; that some of his Ancestors,\r\notherwise Noble, Brave and Great, appear'd on the other side; since the\r\nLiberties of his Country are the Center of his Actions, and the\r\nProsperity of all Men the mark he aims at.\r\n\r\nIt may be a Character to the rest of the dissenting Lords, to say of\r\nthem in general, That they were such as took a particular Pleasure in\r\nbeing Patrons of Virtue as well as Patrons of Liberty: That they were\r\nMen generally speaking distinguish'd for their constant Loyalty to\r\ntheir Prince, but ever with a view to the Fundamental Laws: That they\r\nhad always Wisdom enough to know their Countries Rights, and Courage\r\nenough to defend them; Men of Honour, Men of Prudence, Men of\r\nResolution: In short, They were Men admirably suited to the Character\r\nof their Leader; as he on the other hand, thought it his Honour to be\r\nat the Head of so illustrious a Body of Men, equally valuable for their\r\nVirtue, Capacities, Wisdom and Integrity.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be forgotten; That as these Noble Persons were Zealous for\r\nthe Liberties of their Country, so truly they were Men that had the\r\ngreatest Interest in it, having separately considered the best Estates\r\nof the whole Nobility, of that Country and joined together, were able\r\nto Buy twice their Number in the whole Assembly. It is true, that\r\nEstate is not any just Addition to the Character of a Person; but it\r\nwill for ever remain a Truth; And all Nations will shew a regard to it,\r\n_viz._ that those may be supposed to be the most proper Persons to be\r\ntrusted with the Conservation of the Liberties of their Country, who\r\nhave by their Birth and Inheritance the largest Shares in the\r\nPossession of it.\r\n\r\nThis is illustrated by the Practice of that happy Country we live in,\r\nwhere this Story may perhaps be read, and where very lately, a Law has\r\nbeen made, to unquallifie all such to represent their Country in the\r\nLegislation and Power of raising Taxes, who are not possessed of such\r\nor such a Porportion in the Lands of their Country, as may suppose them\r\nPersons made naturally anxious for the Welfare of the whole, in regard\r\nto the Preservation of their Property. Unhappy _Atalantis_! Had such a\r\nLaw pass'd for the Qualification of those Noblemen, who should be\r\nelected to the great Royal Council of thy Country; and should the\r\nNobility so to be chosen have been limited to but one hundred\r\n_Perialo's_ (a Gold Coin in that Country amounting by Estimation to\r\nabout 2000 _l._ a Year Sterling) of yearly Estate in Lands, how few of\r\nthe Sixteen now chosen could have shewn themselves in that august\r\nMeeting.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, several of those now sent up, were not able to put\r\nthemselves into a Posture to undertake the Journey, till they had sold\r\nthe Magazines of Corn which they had laid up for the Year's Subsistance\r\nof their Families, or mortgaged their small Estates to borrow Money for\r\nthe Expence.\r\n\r\nNor is it doubted in the least, but when those poor Noblemen come to\r\nfind some of their _Tartarian_ Expectations frustrated, with which it\r\nis manifest they were very Big when they went up; they will sorely\r\nregret the Misfortune of their Election; since they must be thereby so\r\nreduced, as almost to want Subsistance for their Families; and as for\r\nthe Debts contracted, it is impossible some of them should ever Pay\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt has been a too unhappy Truth in other Places as well as in\r\n_Atalantis Major_, That in such popular Elections, whether of Noblemen\r\nor others, Men are deluded with the Notion, that to be chosen by their\r\nCountry to these great Councils of the Nation, must so recommend them,\r\nor make them so necessary to the State, to the Government, or the\r\nMinisters of State, that they cannot fail to make their Fortunes and\r\nraise Estates by their very Appearance: But this is so constantly found\r\nto fail, and so many have been almost ruin'd by the Expences they have\r\nbeen at to make a Figure as they call it, and to appear at Court like\r\nthemselves on such Occasions, that it seems wonderful that Persons of\r\nQuality, who know their own Circumstances, and whose Fortunes, through\r\nthe Disasters of their Families, may not be equal to their Dignity,\r\nshould on so vain a Presumption push themselves upon the necessity of\r\ncompleating their own Ruin, beggering their Families, and leaving their\r\nPosterity an Estate in Titles and Coronets, Things without the Support\r\nof competent Estates the most despicable in the World.\r\n\r\nIt might be very useful to our Readers, and perhaps something\r\ninstructing might be gathered from it, with respect to the Affairs of\r\n_Europe_ at this Time, to give some Account here of the Success of\r\nthese strange Proceedings; what Figure these People made, when they\r\ncame to Court, how they behav'd themselves when they came into the\r\ngreat Council, how they were made Tools there to the Politicians of\r\nthose Times, even to act against their Interest, their Country, their\r\nown Designs.\r\n\r\nIn doing this, it would appear, How some of the Sixteen, more\r\nparticularly known to be in the _Tartarian_ Interest, and who had all\r\nalong declared themselves for the Person and Title of the pretending\r\nPrince, who, as is noted before, put in a Claim to the Succession of\r\nthe Throne: How these, I say, went up to the great Council, wheedled by\r\nthe Subtilties of _Greeniccio_, and his Agents, to believe seriously\r\nthat they went up directly to declare his Title; that they should be\r\nthe Men that should have the Honour to declare his Right in the great\r\nCouncil of the Nobility; and that he should for the future own his\r\nRestoration, his Glory, and his Crown, to their Loyalty and steddy\r\nacting for him. This, they did not doubt, should tend not to their\r\nHonour only, but to the raising their decay'd Fortunes, for they were\r\nmiserably Poor; since he could do no less than confer the greatest\r\nTrusts upon Persons who had with so much Fidelity acted for his Glory\r\nand Interest.\r\n\r\nIt would also to the eternal Shame and Disappointment of the _Atalantic\r\nJacobites_, (if I may so call them) necessarily follow, that the\r\nHistory of their Conduct should come in at the same time to be\r\nconsidered, _viz._ How just the contrary to all this, and against the\r\nvery Nature of the Thing they were obliged, even among the very first\r\nof their Transactings in their Publick Station, as Members of the great\r\nCouncil aforesaid, to appear in a Publick Address to the Soveraign of\r\nthe Country, in which they were brought in recognizing Her just Title\r\nto Reign, (which they in their Hearts abhorr'd) promising to Stand by\r\nand Defend that Title with all their Might, (which they had hoped to\r\nsee overthrown) engaging to assist Her to the utmost, against that very\r\npretending Claimant as above, (who they Reverence as their lawful\r\nPrince) and to carry on the War with Vigour against the _Tartarian_\r\nEmperor (that very Prince on whose Power they depended for the carrying\r\non their Designs).\r\n\r\nHad any _British_-Man of Sense, that understands the Language of the\r\nCountenance, but seen the Astonishment, the Chagrin, the Vexation and\r\nAnguish of Soul, that appear'd on the Faces of these _Atalantic_\r\nNoblemen, at this surprizing Event; how they gnashed their Teeth for\r\nAnger, and curst the Hour that ever they were Members of this grand\r\nCouncil; how they Bann'd, (an _Atalantis_ Word used there, for what we\r\ncall Swearing and Damning in our Country;) how they raged at\r\n_Greenwiccio_, and the _Lord of the Isles_, who they said had Betray'd\r\nthem; and how strangely they look'd, upon the solemn Occasion of\r\npresenting this Address to their Soveraign: I say, could their\r\nCountenances but have been read by any in our Country, they would have\r\ntaken them for Furies rather than Men, or for Men under some Frenzy,\r\nridden with the Night-Mare, or scared with some Apparition.\r\n\r\nIt was not less odd, to see the Conduct of _Greeniccio_; for tho' he\r\nhad not less Mischief in his Heart, yet it was of another Kind; and\r\ntho' he had not the same View of the Succession, nor perhaps was\r\ndirectly in the _Tartarian_ Interest, and therefore shew'd no Pity,\r\nor Sympathy with the Mortifications of the other, yet he met with\r\nDisappointments equally perplexing, and which made him heartily repent\r\nthe length he had gone; but as it was in his Nature to be rash, it was\r\nimpossible to prevent his being disappointed almost in every Thing he\r\nwent about: For it is in _Atalantis Major_ just as it is in other Parts\r\nof the World, _viz._ That rash headstrong unthinking Tempers, generally\r\nprecipitate themselves into innumerable Mischiefs, which Prudence and\r\nPatience would evite and prevent; and also, that these furious rash\r\nPeople, as they are hot and impatient under those Mischiefs when they\r\nare surprised with them, so they are not always the best able to\r\nextricate and deliver themselves.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThis will necessarily lead us to a long History of the Disappointments\r\nhe met with:\r\n\r\n1. In his Project of charging and impeaching his General, and the great\r\nTestador, or ---- of the Nations Treasure, which he could never, either\r\nbring Crime enough to justifie, or Friends enough to joyn in, and make\r\nit terrible.\r\n\r\n2. How he was disappointed in his ambitious Views of being made General\r\nagainst the _Tartarians_; whereas, he had on the contrary, the\r\nMortification, to see the great Commander continu'd, with an addition\r\nof Generallissimo to his Titles of Command; and himself, like what we\r\nused to call in _England_, being _Kick'd up Stairs_, sent out of the\r\nWay with a Feather in his Cap, and the Title of General, to carry on a\r\nremote Unfortunate, and never-to-be Successful War in _Japan_, and the\r\nLord knows where, among Barbarians and Savages.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nThis was not all; When upon his embracing this Title, which his Temper\r\n(naturally Ambitious) jumpt at, and eagerly closed with, he began to\r\nchoose Officers, name Regiments, and draw out Forces to form the Army\r\nhe was to Command, he found the new Generalissimo had supplanted him\r\nthere too; for he had not only prevailed with the Queen of the Country,\r\nnot to draw away any of the old Troops then establish'd for the\r\n_Tartarian_ War, of which this _Gew-Gaw-General_ fancied to himself he\r\nshould form his Army: But the Generalissimo obtain'd, That the best\r\nTroops which were remaining in _Atalantis Major_, should be sent over\r\nto strengthen the Army against the _Tartars_: So that this new General\r\nwas likely to go away to _Japan_ without any Army, but such Troops as\r\nher _Atalantic_ Majesty and Her Allies had hired from the _Emperor of\r\nChina_, and such other People; and he had none but Strangers,\r\nBarbarians and Mercenaries to Command.\r\n\r\nIt is true, That his Design of drawing off the Troops from the\r\n_Tartarian_ War, to carry on a _Wild-Goose War_ in the remotest Parts\r\nof _Japan_, was like the rest of his Schemes, so inconsistent, so\r\ndestructive to the general Design of the War, and would in all its\r\nprobable Circumstances be so dangerous to the true Interest of\r\n_Atalantis Major_, That notwithstanding some had persuaded the\r\nGovernment to a _New Scheme_, and that the War was to be pushed on\r\n_ESPECIALLY_ in _Japan_ (a Thing which perhaps some encouraged at\r\nfirst, on purpose to draw him in to accept of that Command, which many\r\nof inferiour Rank to him had declin'd) yet when they came to look\r\nnearer into the Thing, and to see the fatal Prospect of weakning the\r\nForces on the _Tartarian_ side, while the _Emperor of Tartary_ at the\r\nsame Time was vigilant and forward in encreasing his Preparations, they\r\nsoon found the Representations of the Generalissimo had such Weight in\r\nthem, and were founded so much upon their general Good, that they\r\nthought fit to alter their Measures.\r\n\r\nHow _Greeniccio_ was thus disappointed; how he resented it; how to\r\nPacifie him, an Appearance of drawing some Troops together was made;\r\nhow he was at last sent away with a whole Ship load of fine Promises;\r\nas he on the contrary loaded the same Ship back with a full Freight of\r\nSchemes, Projects and Rhodomontadoes; how he went; what he did, and\r\nwhat he did not; how _Tinker_ like, he mended the Work of those that\r\nwent before, and left it for others to mend after him; these are Things\r\nI may give you a farther Account of when I return from my next Progress\r\nto that glorious Country of _Atalantis Major_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_FINIS._",
