I have\r\nventured to think that the opinions of a veteran inquirer into Irish\r\naffairs, with respect to 'Present Irish Questions' just now of much\r\nimportance, and certain to be ere long fully discussed in Parliament and\r\nelsewhere, may be of some use to a younger generation, that will have to\r\nexamine and must be affected by them. I am not unaware of the cynical\r\nremarks of Swift on the disregard shown to authors who may be said to have\r\nhad their day; and I do not pretend that, in the instance of myself, 'old\r\nexperience' has given something of a 'prophetic strain' to what is\r\ncontained in this volume. But I can say, with truth, that few living men\r\nhave had such opportunities as have fallen to my lot, during a long series\r\nof years, to understand Ireland in its different parts, and the feelings\r\nand sentiments of the Irish community; to form sound and moderate views on\r\nthe many and perplexing phenomena called 'Irish Questions;' to deal\r\nreasonably with Irish political and social problems, free from the\r\ninfluences of party prejudice and passion; in short, to do my subject\r\ncomplete and impartial justice. How the accidents and associations of a\r\nlife already protracted beyond the ordinary span, have, as I hope, given\r\nme these qualifications, I have explained at some length in my 'Ireland,\r\n1798-1898;' I shall not repeat what I have already written. But Ireland\r\nhas constantly been uppermost in my thoughts; and as regards the\r\nconclusions I have come to in these pages, I may say, with the Roman\r\nhistorian, 'haec senectuti seposui.'\r\n\r\nThe examination of 'Present Irish Questions,' in this work, shows the\r\nviews I entertain with regard to the actual condition of Ireland in its\r\nvarious aspects, and to her probable future destinies. These views may be\r\ncensured as too gloomy, and even paradoxical; but Ireland remains, as she\r\nwas when Macaulay wrote of her, 'A member indeed of the Empire, but a\r\nwithered and distorted member;' the revolution which has passed, nay, is\r\nstill passing, over her, has destroyed a great deal that ought to have\r\nbeen preserved, and has put little that is solid and stable in its place;\r\nthere is much that is threatening and even dangerous in her political and\r\nsocial order, and in the sentiments of the mass of her community. In the\r\ncase of Ireland, indeed, as in that of any other people, I have faith in\r\nthe effect of salutary legislation on wise and just principles, and of\r\nconsistent good government steadily carried out, of both of which there\r\nhas been but too little evidence, during the last twenty years, in Irish\r\naffairs; above all, my trust is large in the healing influences of Time.\r\nBut I have not forgotten that the vision of 'Pacata Hibernia,' which\r\nflitted even before the majestic understanding of Bacon, three centuries\r\nago, has not been realised; the thoughtless optimism, which, during the\r\nlast two generations, has represented Ireland to be in a state of\r\ncontinual 'progress,' nay, as 'contented and happy,' whenever she has not\r\nbeen convulsed by disorder and trouble, or racked by poverty and distress,\r\nhas been completely falsified; and with nations, as with individuals, the\r\nprofound remark of Butler is true; a life of repentance often fails to\r\nredeem the errors of the past. I proceed to indicate some at least of the\r\nauthorities which relate to the different parts of my subject. The\r\nmaterial condition of Ireland of late years may, perhaps, be best\r\nascertained by studying, over some length of time, the large body of\r\nstatistics compiled by the Government, and contained in that valuable\r\npublication, 'Thom's Directory,' and by a perusal of the Irish debates in\r\nHansard. Reference, too, should be made to the important papers of Mr.\r\nChilders, of Lord Farrer, and of Mr. Sexton in the Report of the Childers\r\nCommission, and especially to the evidence of Sir Robert Giffen, and even\r\nof Sir Edward Hamilton, in the Blue Books appended to that inquiry.\r\n'England's Wealth, Ireland's Poverty,' by Thomas Lough, M.P., though a\r\none-sided book, also deserves attention; and useful information may be\r\nobtained from 'The Five Years in Ireland, 1895-1900,' of Mr. Michael J. F.\r\nMcCarthy, too much a eulogy, however, of things as they are, and marked by\r\na spirit of aversion to, and distrust of, the Irish priesthood, which are\r\na characteristic of a small section of the Irish Catholics.\r\n\r\nThe sources of our knowledge respecting the moral, social, and political\r\nstate of Ireland are numerous and ample; I shall confine myself, as much\r\nas I can, to those which relate to what may be called her recent\r\nrevolutionary period, though Irish history in the past, even in the\r\ndistant past, is anything but an 'old almanack.' This mass of evidence\r\nfaithfully represents the disturbances and the troubles that have\r\nprevailed in Ireland, with intervals of time between, during the last\r\ntwenty years and upwards, and the fierce animosities and conflicts which\r\nhave been the consequence. Here a reader should again consult Hansard,\r\nnotably the debates on Ireland, during the agitated period from 1880 to\r\n1889; of course he should only study the great speeches. The publications\r\non this subject are very many, and some of real importance; as regards\r\nthe policy and conduct of the Land, and even of the National Leagues, and\r\nthe frightful outbreak of disorder and crime which was the result, nothing\r\nis equal in value to the Report of the Judges of the 'Special Commission,'\r\nand to the immense body of evidence brought before them; 'The Verdict,' by\r\nProfessor Dicey, sums up well the conclusions at which they arrived. The\r\nutterances of the so-called Irish 'Nationalist' Press, throughout these\r\nyears, fully verify the facts disclosed in the Report, and its findings;\r\nthey have, indeed, been continued in a less ferocious and violent, but in\r\na significant, strain ever since; a collection of them will be found in\r\nthe volumes published by the Irish Unionist Alliance. On this subject, and\r\nalso on the state of opinion existing among a large majority, probably, of\r\nthe Irish people, see 'The Continuity of the Irish Revolutionary\r\nMovement,' by Professor Brougham Leech; 'The Truth about the Land League,'\r\nby Mr. Arnold Foster, M.P.; 'Parnellism and Crime,' republished from the\r\n_Times_; 'Incipient Irish Revolution,' anonymous but able; some valuable\r\narticles on Ireland by the late Lord Grey that appeared in the _Nineteenth\r\nCentury_; 'Disturbed Ireland,' by Mr. T. W. Russell, M.P.; 'The Plan of\r\nCampaign Illustrated;' and 'About Ireland,' by Mrs. E. Lynn Lynton. The\r\nrecent revolutionary and agrarian movements in Ireland have not found many\r\nto vindicate them, or even fully to explain their causes; but reference\r\nmay be made to 'The Parnell Movement,' by T. P. O'Connor, M.P.; to the\r\n'New Ireland' of Mr. A. M. Sullivan; to Mr. Barry O'Brien's 'Irish Wrongs\r\nand English Remedies;' and to a series of articles called 'Ungrateful\r\nIreland,' in the _Nineteenth Century_, from the pen of Sir G. Duffy. A\r\nhost of papers in quarterly, monthly, and other reviews and magazines on\r\nthe political and social condition of Ireland of late years has, also,\r\nbeen published from time to time. Attempts have been made, quite recently,\r\nto show that the troubles of Ireland have become things of the past, and\r\nthat she is a prosperous and happy land; but though real improvement has\r\ncertainly taken place, these are mere repetitions of the optimistic\r\nfancies that have so often proved delusions.\r\n\r\nThe great question of Home Rule, 'present' if for a time postponed, was\r\nfirst put forward formally by the late Isaac Butt. His 'Irish Federalism'\r\nis a thoughtful and able treatise that ought to be studied. The speeches\r\nin Parliament, from 1874 to 1885, on this subject, collected in Hansard,\r\ndeserve attention; notably the violent attacks on this policy made during\r\nmany years by Mr. Gladstone. Hansard, too, should be perused, after that\r\nstatesman became a convert to Home Rule, for the speeches on both sides,\r\non the Home Rule Bills of 1886 and 1893; some are of marked power and\r\ninsight, though few rise to the heights of great constitutional\r\nprinciples. Mr. Gladstone's defence of his sudden change of front will be\r\nfound in his 'History of an Idea,' a tract published soon after his defeat\r\nat the polls in 1886; he has endeavoured to vindicate his later Irish\r\npolicy, in many pamphlets and speeches, in volumes collected by himself.\r\nFor a masterly examination of his public conduct on matters relating to\r\nIreland, and in some other passages in his career, I would especially\r\ndirect the reader to the 'Memoirs of the late Lord Selborne,' part ii.\r\nvol. ii. pp. 339-360; Mr. Lecky's brilliant sketch in his 'Democracy and\r\nLiberty,' Cabinet Edition, Introduction, pp. 19-56, is a composition of\r\nrare excellence. Nothing is to be compared to Professor Dicey's 'England's\r\nCase against Home Rule,' and his 'Leap in the Dark,' for a thorough\r\ninvestigation, from the Unionist point of view, of the natural and the\r\nprobable consequences of the Gladstonian Irish policy, and for an analysis\r\nof the two Home Rule Bills; few political works have attracted equal\r\nattention. There have also been many publications, on the side of the\r\nUnion, of more or less merit; see 'Home Rule,' reprinted from the _Times_,\r\ncontaining several very able letters and papers; 'The Truth about Home\r\nRule;' 'A Sketch of Unionist Policy;' and a number of articles in the\r\n_Edinburgh_ and the _Quarterly Review_, and in other reviews and\r\nmagazines. The publications which advocate Home Rule have not been\r\nnumerous; a reader may consult the 'Hand Book of Home Rule,' edited by Mr.\r\nBryce, M.P.; 'Irish Members and English Gaolers,' and 'Combination and\r\nCoercion,' by Mr. Shaw-Lefevre; and some contributions to a few reviews\r\nand other serials.\r\n\r\nThe 'Present Question' of the Irish land, and of Irish landed relations,\r\ngoes back to even remote antiquity, and is connected with the whole course\r\nof Irish history. The characteristics and peculiarities of tribal land\r\ntenure in Ireland, before the Anglo-Norman Conquest, have been admirably\r\nexplained in Sir Henry Maine's 'Early History of Institutions,' a very\r\nvaluable work. I may refer to an article on this book, from my pen, in the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_ of July, 1875. See, also, the 'Senchus Mor,' and the\r\n'Book of Aicile,' fragments of the Brehon Laws, well annotated by the late\r\nProfessor Richey. The state of the Irish land, from the Anglo-Norman\r\nConquest to the beginning of the Tudor period, has been fully illustrated\r\nin the 'Statute of Kilkenny,' edited by James Hardiman, whose learned\r\ncommentary is useful and important; in the 'Discovery' of Sir John Davies;\r\nin Spenser's 'View of the State of Ireland;' in the 'O'Conors of\r\nConnaught,' by the O'Conor Don; in Hallam's 'Constitutional History,' vol.\r\niii. chapter on Ireland; and in Professor Richey's 'Lectures.' I have\r\nglanced at the state of Irish land tenure during the tribal and the feudal\r\nages, in the introductory chapters to my 'Ireland, 1494-1868,' in the\r\n'Cambridge Historical Series.' The most complete account, perhaps, of the\r\nconfiscations of the Irish land, from the reign of Henry VIII. to that of\r\nCharles I., will be found in the 'Carew Papers,' edited by J. S. Brewer\r\nand William Bullen; valuable information abounds in the 'State Papers\r\nrelating to the reign of Henry VIII.,' edited by Hans Claude Hamilton; in\r\n'The Life of Sir John Perrott and his Letters;' in the 'Earls of Kildare,'\r\nedited by the Marquis of Kildare; in the 'State Papers,' edited by\r\nHamilton, _ante_, 'relating to the reigns of Edward VI., Mary, and\r\nElizabeth;' in the 'Annals of the Four Masters;' and see Davies and\r\nSpenser, _ante_. Several modern writers have treated this subject in their\r\nnarratives of Irish history; Froude's 'History of England,' vol. ii. ch.\r\nviii.; vol. iv. ch. xix.; vol. v. ch. xxviii.; vol. viii. chs. vii.-xi.;\r\nvol. x. ch. xxiv.; vol. xi. ch. xxvii., may be consulted; but a reader\r\nshould be put on his guard against the brilliant but partisan historian.\r\nThere is a valuable chapter also, in a very different work, Mr. Lecky's\r\n'History of England in the Eighteenth Century,' vol. ii. ch. vi. pp. 92\r\n_seqq._; and a great deal may be learned from the 'O'Conors of Connaught,'\r\nand Richey's 'Lectures,' _ante_; and especially from an 'Historical\r\nAccount of the Plantation of Ulster,' by the Rev. George Hill, and from\r\nSigerson's 'History of Irish Land Tenure.' In the momentous period of\r\nconfiscation, from the beginning of the reign of Charles I. to that of\r\nWilliam III., a reader should study 'Strafford's Letters;' Carte's 'Life\r\nof Ormond;' Lord Clanricarde's 'Memoirs;' the 'Letters of Cromwell,'\r\nedited by Carlyle; the 'Acts of Settlement and Explanation;' the 'Articles\r\nof the Treaty of Limerick;' Sir William Petty's 'Political Anatomy of\r\nIreland;' 'Macariae Excidium;' and the Abbe MacGeoghegan's 'History of\r\nIreland.' The modern authorities on this period are numerous and some of\r\ngreat value; see Gardiner's 'History of the Commonwealth and Protectorate'\r\n(the Irish chapters), notably vol. iii. ch. xliv.; 'The Cromwellian\r\nSettlement of Ireland,' by John P. Prendergast; 'The Life of Sir William\r\nPetty,' by Lord Edmund Fitzmaurice, with an article by me in the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_ of July, 1895; 'The Patriot Parliament,' by Thomas\r\nDavis; Macaulay's 'History of England' (the Irish chapters), vol. iv. ch.\r\nxxii.; vol. v. ch. xiv.-xvi.; vol. vi. ch. xvii.; and Mr. Lecky's\r\n'History,' _ante_, vol. ii. ch. ix. Many instructive and philosophic\r\npassages on all these confiscations and their results, will be found\r\nscattered among the writings of Burke; they are admirable.\r\n\r\nThe era of violent confiscation closed with the reign of William III.; the\r\nmodern history of the Irish land system begins from this period. For an\r\naccount of the penal code, as it affected Irish landed relations,\r\nreference may be made to Vincent Scully, 'On the Penal Laws;' to Howard's\r\n'Popery Cases;' and especially to Burke's 'Tracts on the Popery Laws.'\r\nMuch, too, can be gathered from Curry's 'State of the Irish Catholics;'\r\nfrom Primate Boulter's and Archbishop Synge's 'Letters;' from the writings\r\non Ireland of Swift and Berkeley; and from various passages in the 'Works\r\nand Correspondence of Burke.' For the state of the Irish land from the\r\nbeginning of the reign of George III. to the Rebellion of 1798, study the\r\ncelebrated 'Tour' of Arthur Young, written in 1776-78; Crumpe's 'Essay;'\r\nan admirable sketch by Mr. Lecky in his 'History,' _ante_, vol. vii. ch.\r\nxxvii.; and Sir George Lewis on 'Irish Disturbances,' a book which gives\r\nan account of the rise and progress of the Whiteboy movement, and carries\r\nthe narrative down to 1836. Froude has illustrated this subject very\r\nskilfully in his 'Two Chiefs of Dunboy;' but his account, in his 'The\r\nEnglish in Ireland,' is very inaccurate and one-sided. The nature of Irish\r\nlanded relations during the troubled period before the Union is fully\r\nexplained in many passages of Mr. Lecky's 'History,' _ante_, vols. vii.\r\nand viii.; and the reader should peruse Lord Clare's speech in the Irish\r\nHouse of Lords during the debates on the Union. From the Union to the\r\npresent time, the authorities on the Irish land system are very numerous;\r\nit is not easy to make compendious selection. For the period of the Great\r\nWar, Edward Wakefield's 'Account of Ireland' is valuable, and so is, for\r\nthe immediately subsequent period, the evidence on the state of Ireland\r\ntaken by a Committee of the House of Commons in 1825. The nature and the\r\ncharacteristics of the Irish land system, in 1843-44, are fully explained\r\nand commented upon in the well-known Report of the Devon Commission, and\r\nthe voluminous evidence; and for the revolution wrought in the Irish land\r\nby the Famine of 1845-47, see the 'Irish Crisis,' by Sir Charles\r\nTrevelyan, republished from the _Edinburgh Review_; and a 'History of the\r\nGreat Irish Famine,' by the Rev. John O'Rorke. Much information, too, on\r\nthe subject, as a whole, may be obtained from 'L'Irlande, Sociale,\r\nPolitique, et Religieuse,' of Gustave de Beaumont; from 'Ireland from the\r\nTreaty of Limerick to 1851,' by John Mitchell; from parts of 'Two\r\nCenturies of Irish History,' edited by James Bryce, M.P.; from several\r\n'Reports' of the Loyal National Repeal Association; and from parts of Mr.\r\nBarry O'Brien's 'Fifty Years of Concessions to Ireland,' and 'Irish Wrongs\r\nand English Remedies.'\r\n\r\nThe Irish land question has given birth to a literature of its own in the\r\nlast half-century; legislation on the Irish land system has been\r\nextraordinarily active. With respect to the first, reference may be made\r\nto 'Two Centuries of Irish History,' _ante_, and to Mr. Barry O'Brien's\r\nworks, _ante_; to 'Emigration and the Tenure of Irish Land,' by Lord\r\nDufferin; to John Stuart Mill's 'The Irish Land Question;' to 'The Irish\r\nPeople and the Irish Land,' by Butt; to Sir George Campbell's 'The Irish\r\nLand,' a very good little book; to Judge Longfield's essay on the Irish\r\nland in 'Systems of Land Tenure;' and to my own 'Letters on the Land\r\nQuestion of Ireland,' republished from the _Times_. I am happy to think\r\nthat, on this subject, I have always 'pitched my Whiggery low;' my first\r\nessay was on the Encumbered Estates Act; when fresh from Oxford I\r\ncondemned that scheme of confiscation as unequivocally as, in the present\r\nand other works, I have condemned Irish agrarian legislation since\r\n1880-81. Other books contain passages on the Irish land system that may be\r\nread with profit; see the 'Recollections and Suggestions' of Earl Russell;\r\n'Ireland in 1868,' by Gerald Fitzgibbon; 'Ireland,' by Lord Grey;\r\n'Journals, Conversations, and Essays relating to Ireland,' by Nassau\r\nSenior; and 'New Views on Ireland,' by Lord Russell of Killowen. As\r\nregards recent legislation on the Irish Land, from 1870 to 1896, the Acts\r\npassed by Parliament must of course be studied, and also the important\r\ndebates reported in Hansard. Butt wrote a very able volume on the Land Act\r\nof 1870; I contributed a short treatise; an exhaustive and technical work\r\nof great value, on all the Irish Land Acts, has been produced by Messrs.\r\nCherry and Wakely; this, with the Irish Reports, supplies ample\r\nprofessional, and even general, information. With respect to the\r\nadministration of the Irish Land Acts, see the Report of the Committee of\r\nthe House of Lords, and the evidence published in 1872; the Report of, and\r\nthe evidence collected by, the Bessborough Commission of 1880-81; the\r\nReport of a Committee of the House of Lords on the working of the Land Act\r\nof 1881, published, with the evidence, in 1882; the Report, with the\r\nevidence, of the Cowper Commission, 1888-89; the Report, with the\r\nevidence, of the Morley Commission, 1894-1895; and, especially, the Report\r\nof Sir Edward Fry's Commission of 1897, with the important evidence it has\r\nput together. Mr. Lecky, in his 'Democracy and Liberty,' vol. i. ch. ii.,\r\nhas criticised, almost as severely as I have done, recent Irish agrarian\r\nlegislation; no serious defence of it has ever been made or attempted.\r\n\r\nTo understand the real state of the financial relations between Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, it is necessary to go back to the times of the Union;\r\nthose who resist the Irish demand avoid an appeal to history. The debates\r\nin the Irish Parliament in 1800 should be carefully studied, especially\r\nthe speeches of Castlereagh, Grattan, and Foster. The Seventh Article of\r\nthe Treaty of Union, set forth in this work, should also be diligently\r\nscanned and perused. See, too, the debates in the Imperial Parliament in\r\n1816; the resolutions passed by the House of Commons in that year; and the\r\nAct abolishing the separate Exchequer of Ireland. Reference, moreover,\r\nshould be made to the evidence taken before General Dunne's Committee in\r\n1864, in which sophistry triumphed for the moment over truth. All these\r\nsources of information, however, are scanty and imperfect compared to the\r\ncelebrated Report of the Childers Commission, with the valuable evidence\r\nannexed to it; this for the first time completely brings out the whole\r\nfacts on the subject. The debates in Hansard on the financial claims of\r\nIreland may also be looked at; but they are not of peculiar importance;\r\nthe same remark applies to nearly all the articles in reviews, magazines,\r\nand journals, in which endeavours have been made to answer the Report. I\r\nmay be allowed to say that I have some claim to have a distinct opinion in\r\nthis matter; when still quite a boy I often heard my grand-uncle, the late\r\nSir John Newport, one of the ablest and last of the Chancellors of the\r\nIrish Exchequer, condemn the financial treatment of Ireland from 1800\r\nonwards; many years afterwards I was intimately acquainted with several of\r\nthe independent Irish gentlemen, survivors of the great school of Grattan,\r\nwho protested against Mr. Gladstone's fiscal Irish measures from 1853 to a\r\nlater date; Butt and Judge Longfield, both very able economists, fully\r\nconcurred. With respect to local government and administration in Ireland,\r\nsee Mr. Barry O'Brien's 'Fifty Years of Concessions to Ireland,' vol. i.\r\nbooks iv. and v.; the Report of the Commissioners on Irish Corporate\r\nReform issued in 1833-34, and the Irish Municipal Corporation Reform Act\r\nof 1840; the Irish Towns Commissioners Acts; a report made by Mr. W. P.\r\nO'Brien in 1878; a good treatise by Mr. Bailey published in 1888; and the\r\nrecent Irish Local Government Act of 1898, with the debates in Hansard on\r\nthis measure, should be perused. The authorities on Irish education of all\r\nkinds are numerous, and some valuable. Froude has glanced at the subject,\r\nwith characteristic unfairness, in his 'The English in Ireland;' the\r\nrefutation of Mr. Lecky, in his 'England in the Eighteenth Century,' is\r\ncomplete. A good description of education in Ireland, in all its branches,\r\nas it existed in 1812, will be found in Edward Wakefield's 'Account of\r\nIreland,' vol. ii. ch. xxiv.; another in Mr. Barry O'Brien's 'Fifty Years\r\nof Concessions to Ireland,' vol. i. book i.; vol ii. book x.; the author\r\nbrings the narrative down to 1881. As regards high education in Ireland,\r\nreference may be made to 'The History of the University of Dublin,' by the\r\nRev. W. Stubbs; to 'The Constitutional History of the University of\r\nDublin,' by D. C. Heron; to the Report of Archbishop Whateley's\r\nCommission, in 1853, on the University of Dublin; to Mr. Gladstone's Irish\r\nUniversity Bill of 1873, and the able debates on the subject in Trinity\r\nCollege and the House of Commons; to Mr. Fawcett's Act of 1873; to a\r\nmasterly pamphlet by Butt, on the whole question, published in 1875; and\r\nto the 'Irish University Question,' by Archbishop Walsh, with recent\r\ndebates in Parliament on Irish University reform. For the nature,\r\nconstitution, and working of the Queen's Colleges and the Queen's\r\nUniversity, see the debates in Parliament when Peel introduced this\r\npolicy; many Reports; the work of Archbishop Walsh, _ante_; and the Act\r\ncreating the Royal University in Ireland may be examined. As regards\r\nprimary and secondary education in Ireland, see the Reports of the\r\nEducation Commissioners from 1810 to 1825; the Reports of the National\r\nEducation Board; the Reports of the Kildare, Rosse, and Powis\r\nCommissions, noticed in this work; and Mr. Godkin's 'Education in\r\nIreland.' An excellent synopsis of the subject, as a whole, will be found\r\nin 'The Educational Systems of Great Britain and Ireland,' by Mr. Graham\r\nBalfour.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM O'CONNOR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n

thoroughly the Ireland of the present day, it is necessary\r\nto have studied her history in the past. Nevertheless, if we go back to a\r\ncomparatively recent period, say to the beginning of the reign of\r\nVictoria, we can obtain a reasonably clear idea of her existing\r\ncondition. A revolution has passed over her in this space of time almost\r\nas complete as the revolution which has transformed France; the results\r\nhave not yet been fully developed, but in nearly all respects they have\r\nbeen immense. The community has, for the most part, made material\r\nprogress; but this has been far from great or decisive; it has been\r\ninterrupted by seasons of distress, one culminating in a dire catastrophe,\r\nand has been retarded by many causes of trouble. Taking the external\r\naspect of Ireland first, Dublin has certainly advanced in the last sixty\r\nyears; the capital has been surrounded by fine and increasing suburbs; the\r\nsquares, the streets, the shops have improved; above all, though much\r\nremains yet to be done, the contrast between the dwellings of the rich and\r\nthe poor is much less painful than it was within living memory. No city,\r\nhowever, has made such progress as Belfast: its population, which, in\r\n1841, was not more than 75,000 souls, was, in 1891, upwards of 255,000;[1]\r\nits opulence has probably grown tenfold; it is the centre of the great\r\nmanufacture of Ulster; its building-yards are renowned for its magnificent\r\nships; its estuary is crowded with the thronging fleets of commerce. The\r\ntowns dependent on it, too, and the whole adjoining region, are\r\nflourishing from the great trade in linen, which has been aggregated\r\nwithin a comparatively small space; indeed, this prosperity has extended\r\nover all the north-east of Ireland, and Londonderry has long been a\r\nthriving seaport. Few of the towns of the rest of Ulster and of the\r\nsouthern provinces have improved; but signs of augmented wealth appear in\r\nother directions; in this respect they are striking in the extreme. The\r\nplaces of worship and the religious houses of the Catholic Church of\r\nIreland have been transformed; the mean 'chapels' of the past have largely\r\ndisappeared; most parishes have a suitable church; fine cathedrals\r\ndominate many towns; we often admire monasteries and convents in\r\narchitectural splendour. The most remarkable phenomenon, however, of this\r\ndescription is the great and fortunate change which has taken place in the\r\nhabitations of the community throughout the country. The dense and\r\nwretched hovels which, sixty years ago, barely sheltered the millions of\r\nIrish indigence, if still too frequent, have been, for the most part,\r\neffaced; the houses of the better class have greatly increased in numbers,\r\nthough the population has enormously declined.[2] And the face of the\r\nlandscape in most counties bears witness, on the whole, to a still\r\nperceptible progress. The chief industry of Ireland, indeed, as I shall\r\nshow afterwards, has certainly retrograded within the last twenty years;\r\nher agricultural area and resources have much diminished. The advance,\r\ntoo, which, from about 1853 to 1876, was manifest and rapid in most of her\r\nrural districts, has been, to a considerable extent, checked; capital has,\r\nfor some time, been avoiding her soil. But if the process was stern, nay,\r\nappalling, the land has, within the last half century, been thrown open to\r\nhusbandry, infinitely better and more fruitful than had existed before;\r\nthe exertions which were made, for a long space of time, to improve\r\ncultivation have left far-spreading traces; we still behold the beneficent\r\nresults. The land over the greater part of its surface is not 'puckered\r\nup' in thousands of squalid patches, the holdings of masses of cottar\r\npaupers; it has been made more available for real farming; and it has been\r\nlargely drained, enclosed, and covered with woodland--at least, up to a\r\nrecent period.\r\n\r\nThe material condition of the Irish community has, also, improved since\r\nthe late Queen ascended the throne. This, no doubt, is to be largely\r\nascribed to the effects of the great Famine of 1845-47, and of the immense\r\nemigration that followed in its train. The resources of Ireland, before\r\nthat calamity, were unable to support, in anything like comfort, the\r\nteeming multitudes crowded on her soil; an official report, made in 1838,\r\nproved that two millions and a half of the poor in Ireland were for months\r\nin the year on the brink of starvation; this huge mass of indigence, which\r\nforced up rent, beat down wages, and was most injurious to good husbandry,\r\nwas almost incompatible with real social progress. The great and\r\ncontinuing exodus of the Irish race, which has gone on for more than half\r\na century, has not been without untoward results; but it has relieved the\r\ncountry from a destructive incubus; and this has certainly wrought a\r\nbeneficent change, though the population has declined from about eight\r\nmillions in 1837 to about four and a half millions in 1895.[3] Ireland,\r\nindeed, is still, mainly, a poor country--in some districts she is\r\nexceedingly poor; but the disappearance of overwhelmingly redundant\r\nmillions has enabled her to maintain the millions that have remained much\r\nbetter than of old, and has distinctly raised the standard of living among\r\nall the humbler classes. The wages of agricultural labour, seldom more\r\nthan six or seven shillings a week before the Famine, and then paid in\r\npotatoes by a vile truck system, have risen to ten and even twelve\r\nshillings, usually paid in cash; and they have not fallen, though Irish\r\nagriculture is very far from prosperous. The wages of the higher kinds of\r\nlabour have also greatly increased; this is apparent in nearly all trades,\r\nand is especially apparent in the trades of Ulster. At the same time, the\r\npotato has long ceased to be the sole food of the poor; their dwellings,\r\nthough still too often mean and bad, are infinitely better than they once\r\nwere; their attire, and even their appearance, has greatly improved. I do\r\nnot think, indeed, that O'Connell's description of the peasantry of\r\nMunster in 1825 could now be fairly applied to even the worst parts of\r\nIreland, the impoverished tracts on the seacoast of Connaught: 'They have\r\nno clothes to change, they have none but what they wear at the moment....\r\nTheir food consists of potatoes and water during the greater part of the\r\nyear; potatoes and sour milk during another portion; they use some salt\r\nwith their potatoes when they have nothing but water.'[4] There is\r\nevidence, also, that, even of late years, the wealth of Ireland has, in\r\nsome measure, increased, especially in the middle and lower middle\r\nclasses. The landed gentry, indeed, owing partly to the effects of Free\r\nTrade, and partly to those of legislation I shall describe afterwards,\r\nhave been impoverished in many instances, and in many ruined; and the\r\nIrish tenant farmer, if gorged by the spoil of his landlord, has not\r\ngained all that an agrarian revolution was expected to give him. But the\r\ncommerce of Ireland has made progress, within the last two decades, if\r\nthis has not been by any means great; and though the capital she holds in\r\nthe best securities has perceptibly diminished of late years, there has\r\nbeen a very large increase in most kinds of other investments.[5]\r\n\r\nThis picture of Ireland, however, has dark features; her welfare has been,\r\nat best, partial; considerable deductions must be made from it. The\r\nprogress of the capital, as has been the case in London, is largely to be\r\nascribed to the depletion of many country districts, a change that has\r\nbeen going on for a long period, and has been accelerated by the decline\r\nof the landed gentry in wealth. The enormous advance of Belfast, and of\r\nthe adjoining neighbourhood, has been, to a great extent, caused by the\r\nconcentration of the linen manufacture within a small area; the hand-loom\r\nhas disappeared from Ireland; this has been injurious to many petty towns\r\nand villages. The population and the trade of nearly all the chief towns\r\nin the southern provinces have diminished; Cork, with its immense natural\r\nadvantages, has not prospered; Limerick and, notably, Galway are in decay;\r\nmost of the inland towns show few signs of improvement; the outskirts of\r\nalmost all are defaced by lines of ruined hovels, the wrecks of abodes a\r\ndwindling tale of indwellers has left. Many of these urban centres were,\r\nsixty years ago, seats of manufactures and of other industries, which, to\r\na certain extent, were flourishing; but these sources of wealth have, for\r\nthe most part, been dried up; they have been blotted out by the gigantic\r\nmanufactures of England and Scotland poured into Ireland, everywhere,\r\nwithin a few hours, by steam. The collapse, indeed, of Irish manufactures\r\nin the last half century has been striking and mournful; 696,000 persons\r\nwere employed in textile and dyeing industries in 1841; in 1881 there were\r\nonly 130,000; and though the growth of machinery may in part account for\r\nthis difference, it assuredly cannot fully explain it.[6] The same remark\r\napplies to Irish fishing industry; the small craft which once swarmed\r\nalong the coast, and, rearing a breed of hardy mariners, gathered in the\r\nprolific harvests of the sea, have been vanishing year after year; in\r\n1867, 9332 boats, and 38,444 men and boys were engaged in this calling;\r\nthe numbers were 5646 and 21,940 in 1891.[7] Turning to the face of the\r\ncountry, agriculture, we have seen, has improved, if we look back to the\r\nperiod before the Famine; but it is still centuries behind that of England\r\nand Scotland, and of late years it has markedly declined. It is not only\r\nthat the prices of agricultural produce are much less than they were, in\r\nthe last generation, and that its total value has fallen from L97,885,000\r\nin 1851-55, to L88,955,000 in 1889-93.[8] The agricultural area of Ireland\r\nhas diminished from 1879 to 1899 by rather more than 400,000 acres;[9] and\r\nit is absolutely certain that within these decreasing limits, as I shall\r\npoint out in subsequent chapters, agriculture has made little or no\r\nprogress, and in some districts has distinctly become worse; we see the\r\nresults of the vicious legislation of the last twenty years in\r\ndeteriorated farms, in hundreds of cases, in a most injurious neglect of\r\narterial drainage, and in the destruction of thousands of acres of\r\nwoodland. And the ruin which has overtaken many of the landed gentry has\r\nbeen made only too manifest in the desolate aspect of scores of country\r\nseats, once happy homes, that now know their owners no more.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind, too, as we examine the present state of Ireland,\r\nthat if, on the whole, she has made some progress, she is still, as I have\r\nsaid, a poor country, and that a considerable part of Connaught, her\r\nwestern province, has, for years, been in so poor a condition, that the\r\nGovernment of late has laudably made a great effort to raise it out of the\r\ndepths of indigence. Other considerations, moreover, must be taken into\r\naccount, if we would form a just conclusion as to the material position\r\nof Ireland, and, especially, as to her material prospects. The reduction\r\nof her population, up to a certain point, was an essential condition of\r\nher social progress; but that limit appears to have been far surpassed;\r\nthis continuous decline, during more than half a century, has become an\r\nominous symptom. More than 3,700,000 of souls have emigrated from Ireland\r\nsince 1851;[10] and this number does not include the masses which fled\r\nfrom the catastrophe of 1845-47. This immense drain on the life of a\r\nnation has, for years, had a pernicious effect; in large parts of the\r\ncountry labourers have become so scarce that it is often difficult to save\r\nthe harvest, which should be quickly gathered in, in a wet climate; and\r\nhands are wanting to industry in many places. Emigration, too, has taken\r\naway the best part of the people, men and women in the flower of\r\nexistence; the reproductive power of the community has, accordingly,\r\ndeclined; the birth-rate of Ireland is less than it was; infirmity,\r\ndisease, and, notably, insanity have increased; the population of the\r\ntowns is seldom active and thriving.[11] At the same time, the taxation of\r\nIreland has become many degrees more excessive in the last sixty years;\r\nthe local rates have advanced from about L1,000,000 to nearly L4,000,000;\r\nthe general taxation has been well-nigh doubled; and a tribunal of the\r\nvery highest authority has recently declared that Ireland is immensely\r\novertaxed, and has been for upwards of forty years. Nor can there be a\r\nreal question but that large interests connected with the land have\r\nsuffered greatly in the period that has now extended from 1878-79. It is\r\nunnecessary to refer to the condition of the landed gentry; I shall notice\r\nit at some length afterwards; but, much as the Irish people dislike the\r\nPoor-law, pauperism has distinctly increased during the last ten years,\r\nthough the population has fallen off in numbers, and the charge of\r\npauperism shows a corresponding increase.[12] The Income Tax returns, too,\r\nas regards the land, are of sinister omen; those under Schedule A have\r\ngreatly diminished since 1890; and there is a considerable decline of\r\nproperty in the Funds.[13] As to the argument that the Tenant Right of the\r\nIrish farmer has risen in value, and that this proves Irish agriculture to\r\nbe in a prosperous state, this is a complete, nay, a grotesque, fallacy.\r\nThe rise in the value of Tenant Right is simply one of the many signs that\r\na huge confiscation has taken place in the Irish land.\r\n\r\nIf Ireland, therefore, has made material progress, this has been slow,\r\npartial, and with large drawbacks; such as it is, it must be mainly\r\nascribed to the results of the Famine, which liberated the soil from a\r\ndestructive burden. The whole country, it has truly been said, has still\r\ntoo much the look of a 'great neglected estate,' requiring development in\r\nmost of its parts; large sections of the population are poor, feeble in\r\nhealth, and backward. Any advance, moreover, which Ireland has made in\r\nwell being, since 1837-38, is as nothing compared with the extraordinary\r\ngrowth of the prosperity of England and Scotland, within the same period.\r\nTrue-hearted Irishmen grieve as they pass from the lesser to the greater\r\nisland, and contrast the husbandry of Galway and Mayo with that of the\r\nLothians and Kent; as they gaze on the Shannon, with scarcely a sail on\r\nits waters, and the Clyde teeming with its fleets of commerce; above all,\r\nas they turn from the decaying towns of their own country to such centres\r\nof wealth and of gigantic trade, as some even of the provincial cities of\r\nBritain, not to speak of the mighty world of London. The causes, indeed,\r\nof this contrast may be easily found; the mineral resources of Ireland are\r\nscanty; her commerce and manufactures are small; she is essentially an\r\nagricultural land, which has lost much from the effects of Free Trade; she\r\nhas suffered greatly from misgovernment, agitation, and social disorder;\r\nall this has kept her back in the national race. The mineral products, on\r\nthe other hand, of England and Scotland are immense, and of the first\r\nimportance in an age of invention; they have decisively contributed to the\r\nhuge development of the opulence and the trade of Great Britain; the\r\npolicy of Free Trade, carried out for years, has had marvellous results in\r\nthe same direction; if British agriculture is not progressing, British\r\ncommerce and manufactures are still supreme; and Great Britain has been\r\nfor ages a law-abiding land, in which order has been happily combined with\r\nliberty. These considerations fully explain the wide and ever-increasing\r\ndistinction between Ireland and England and Scotland, only too manifest;\r\nthey have been amply verified by unerring statistics. Two figures may\r\nsuffice for a general reader; the resources of Ireland were estimated, a\r\nfew years ago, at a sum of about four hundred millions sterling, that of\r\nGreat Britain at not less than ten thousand millions.[14]\r\n\r\nThe social structure of Ireland springs from the soil; it is most apparent\r\nin the relations that have been formed in the land. I shall dwell, at some\r\nlength, in other chapters of this work, on the history and the\r\ncharacteristics of the Irish land system, and on the revolution through\r\nwhich it has passed; I can here only briefly glance at the subject. That\r\nsystem, at the beginning of the late reign, still represented, in many\r\nrespects, the features it had borne in the eighteenth century, though\r\nthese had been, in a great degree, modified. The land, over four-fifths of\r\nits surface, was still in the ownership of a small class of men, divided\r\nin race and faith from its occupants; the conquests and confiscations\r\nwhich had drawn deep lines of distinction between the Anglo-Protestant\r\nlandlord and the Catholic and even the Presbyterian peasant, had still\r\nleft their indelible traces, if these had been, to a considerable extent,\r\neffaced. Absenteeism had increased since the Union, though absentee\r\nestates were showing signs of improvement; middleman tenures, with their\r\nmanifold and complex mischiefs, were disappearing, but were still\r\nnumerous; various causes, to operate for many years, were diminishing the\r\nsecurity of the peasants' tenure. The power of the dominant landlord class\r\nwas declining; it was being weakened by the Castle bureaucracy, and by the\r\nemancipation of Catholic Ireland; but it was still nearly supreme in\r\nlanded relations; this class was all but the absolute lords of the tillers\r\nof the soil. It is untrue that it was oppressive and unjust as a rule; but\r\nsome of its members abused their excessive power; it had too much in\r\ncommon with an exclusive caste; and a whole train of economic causes were\r\naggravating the evils of a land system from its origin placed on unsound\r\nfoundations. Agriculture was advancing in not a few counties; many of the\r\nlanded gentry were improving men, who were making a beginning in the\r\nscientific farming, which, before long, was to be more fully developed.\r\nBut the population, we have seen, had increased by millions Ireland could\r\nnot support; over whole districts, especially in Munster and Connaught,\r\nthe land had been split up into petty holdings, the seats of a huge\r\nmultitude of human misery. Rents, therefore, were being unnaturally forced\r\nup, and the wages of labour unnaturally cut down; the land system was\r\ndisorganised, and filled with dangerous elements. The worst vice of the\r\nsystem, however, has yet to be noticed; from different causes which I\r\nshall point out afterwards, the occupiers of the soil in Ireland had, as a\r\ngeneral rule, made even the permanent improvements on their farms, and\r\nlarge sums had repeatedly been paid on the transfer of these; they had\r\nthus gradually acquired concurrent rights in the land, in tens of\r\nthousands of instances; and yet these were outside the pale of the law,\r\nand could be annihilated by eviction, or even the raising of rent. These\r\nrights had the support, in parts of Ulster, of a long-established custom,\r\nand were usually respected in the southern provinces; but they ought long\r\nbefore to have had full legal protection; and they were sometimes violated\r\nor disregarded by unscrupulous landlords. The results were seen in the\r\nWhite Boy and the agrarian disorders which had disturbed Ireland for more\r\nthan a century, and even ran back to the confiscations of the past.\r\n\r\nThis land system, essentially bad as it was, marked by evil distinctions\r\nand pregnant with wrong, scarcely attracted the attention of British\r\nstatesmen, until nearly the middle of the nineteenth century. Peel was the\r\nfirst minister who, even dimly, perceived its vices; he appointed a\r\nCommission to report on the subject. The labours of this body were, in\r\npart, laudable; but the Commissioners, filled with prejudice as to the\r\nexcellence of British land tenure, and without experience of that of\r\nIreland, made a capital mistake in the suggestions they offered. Instead\r\nof recommending that the concurrent rights of the Irish tenant in the\r\nland, often equivalent to a real joint ownership, should receive, as was\r\nbut just, the sanction of law, they proposed to restrict these in many\r\nways; they put forward a plan of 'compensation,' as they called it, that\r\nwas worse than useless. Legislation to this effect was withdrawn from\r\nParliament; the terrible visitation of 1845-47 had ere long shattered the\r\nIrish land system, bringing ruin on hundreds of the landed gentry, making\r\nthousands of farmers of the better classes bankrupt, forcing the petty\r\nholders of the land--the cottar population, as it was named--to fly from\r\nthe country in despairing multitudes. The land was largely set free from a\r\ndense mass of wretchedness; it was the general belief of the public men of\r\nthe day, that what was most required, at this conjuncture, was to attract\r\nmen of capital to it to do it justice, and to get rid, as quickly as\r\npossible, of the large body of Irish landlords, who, even before deeply\r\ninvolved in debt, had been made hopelessly insolvent by recent events. The\r\nEncumbered Estates Act became law, with scarcely an opposing protest; it\r\nwas to 'regenerate Ireland,' its authors proclaimed; its results were to\r\ndevelop a bad class of landlords, to annihilate the rights of the Irish\r\npeasant wholesale, and to cause an iniquitous confiscation on an enormous\r\nscale. The Irish Land Question, as was the phrase, was now raised once\r\nmore; in 1852 the occupiers of the Irish soil set on foot an agitation to\r\nvindicate their rights, destroyed or endangered by what had lately\r\noccurred; the Government of Lord Derby lent a favourable ear; but it was\r\ndefeated in the House of Commons by intrigue; the land system remained in\r\nthe state in which it had been left; no real attempt to improve it was\r\nmade. A series of years followed in which Ireland made distinct progress,\r\nand her agriculture advanced; it became a fixed idea with British\r\nstatesmen, that there was nothing radically bad in Irish land tenure, and\r\nthat its defects would gradually disappear; the grievances of the Irish\r\npeasant were ignored; his claims to what was now known as his Tenant\r\nRight, urged feebly by his advocates, were voted down in Parliament; and a\r\ngeneral belief prevailed that what Ireland most needed was a still further\r\nand steady removal of what was deemed 'her surplus population' from her\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nAs has so often happened in the affairs of Ireland, her real condition at\r\nthis period was not understood; and the reform in her land system, which\r\nhad become essential, was indefinitely delayed with disastrous results.\r\nMeanwhile, though things were serene on the surface, the inherent vices in\r\nIrish landed relations were not really changed, and, in some respects,\r\nwere made worse. The Fenian troubles and outbreak of 1865-67 showed how\r\nmuch there was still peccant in the state of Ireland; Mr. Gladstone\r\naddressed himself, in 1870, to the task of effecting a reform in her land\r\nsystem. The measure he carried through Parliament was bold, and, in the\r\nmain, statesmanlike; but it was injured by the predilection for English\r\nland tenure its author avowed, a general misconception of British\r\nstatesmen; it was not without marked and even grave defects; and though\r\nunquestionably it did real good, it did not satisfy the tenant class--at\r\nleast, the men who had become its leaders. In a few years the frightful\r\nperiod of the Land League had begun; a Reign of Terror prevailed in about\r\na third part of Ireland, accompanied by far-spreading and atrocious crime.\r\nThe movement was really a huge conspiracy, formed in America to overthrow\r\nBritish rule in Ireland; but Mr. Gladstone, now minister for the second\r\ntime, resolved to deal with it only on its agrarian side; he wrought a\r\ncomplete revolution in the Irish land system, on principles wholly\r\ndifferent from those of his measure of 1870. This legislation was prepared\r\nwithout reflection; it passed through Parliament when that assembly was\r\nalmost in a state of panic; its author professed that his only object was\r\nto secure the occupier of the Irish soil in his legitimate rights; but the\r\nmethods he adopted to attain this end have never been heard of in modern\r\ntimes, and have never been employed before in civilised lands. The\r\nprinciple of the mediaeval statutes, which endeavoured to fix the price of\r\nbread, and the rate of wages, was extended to the Irish land system; rents\r\nwere to be adjusted through the agency of the State, by tribunals to which\r\nno parallel can be found; tenants' improvements were declared exempted\r\nfrom rent; and a mode of land tenure, hitherto condemned by Mr. Gladstone,\r\nand known as the 'theory of the Three F's,' was applied to the great\r\nmajority of Irish tenancies, in an exaggerated, crude, and dangerous form.\r\nThis legislation, revolutionary and socialistic alike, has been given more\r\nample scope in the last twenty years; it probably affects four-fifths of\r\nthe rented lands in Ireland; it has fashioned the type of land tenure over\r\nnearly all the country. The successors of Mr. Gladstone, who, indeed, had\r\nboasted that it set the doctrines of Adam Smith at nought, were not blind\r\nto the evils it soon developed; but it is questionable if their attempts\r\nto mitigate these, and to place the Irish land system on a better basis,\r\nhave not been at least as open to censure. With the ignorance of Irish\r\nland tenure common in British statesmen, they proclaimed, what assuredly\r\nwas not the fact, that Mr. Gladstone had 'created a dual ownership' in the\r\nIrish land, and that, in order to get rid of this intolerable thing, it\r\nwas necessary, in accord with English ideas, to bring Ireland, as far as\r\npossible, under 'single ownership,' and to make the occupiers of the Irish\r\nsoil, to a large extent, its owners. The system of 'Land Purchase' in\r\nIreland, begun in 1870, was freed from the limitations which made it safe\r\nand just, and widely enlarged under new conditions; Irish tenants were\r\nencouraged to acquire the fee in their holdings, by a process never\r\ncontemplated before; instead of having to pay any part of the price, the\r\nState advanced them the whole purchase moneys, repayable by an annual\r\ncharge much less than any true rent. About a tenth part of the tenant\r\nclass of Ireland have become owners of their farms by these means; the\r\ntransaction has been in no sense a 'purchase;' though given the name, it\r\nis really the exact opposite.\r\n\r\nI shall describe all this legislation, in detail, afterwards, and shall\r\nindicate its far-reaching effects; here I can only take a cursory survey.\r\nThe attempts that have been made to reform the Irish land system, in the\r\nlast sixty years, have been, with scarcely an exception, failures; the\r\nIrish land, it has truly been said, is strewn with the wrecks of repeated\r\nerrors. The Land Act of 1870 was, on the whole, a well-conceived measure;\r\nbut the recommendations made by the Devon Commission, the iniquitous and\r\ndestructive Encumbered Estates Act, the agrarian revolution wrought by Mr.\r\nGladstone, and the 'Land Purchase' Acts, as they are falsely called, have\r\nbeen monuments of want of insight and knowledge. And, what is even worse,\r\nlegislation on the Irish land has, over and over again, been too long\r\ndelayed, and has been inconsistent, fitful, founded on no principle; the\r\nresults have been in a high degree disastrous. Reforms that would have\r\nbeen gladly welcomed if made years before, have been treated with contempt\r\nwhen made too late; and reforms have more than once been hasty\r\nexperiments, carried out under the stress of menacing troubles. The fable\r\nof the Sibylline books has been realised in this matter; and not a few of\r\nthe efforts to improve Irish land tenures have been little better than\r\nsudden leaps in the dark. As to recent legislation in this province, its\r\nconsequences and tendencies have become manifest. That it has effected\r\nsome good may be admitted; it has removed grievances that no doubt\r\nexisted; it has made the government of Ireland more easy for the time; it\r\nhas allayed discontent for a moment; but the good is far outweighed by\r\nthe evil. It is not only that the nostrum of the 'Three F's,' and the\r\nadjustment of rent by the intervention of the State, have cut down the\r\nrental of Ireland to an extent that cannot be justified, and have\r\ntransferred to the occupier of the Irish soil a large part of what was the\r\nowner's property by a process of confiscation concealed, but certain. It\r\nis not only that the status of the Irish landlord has been iniquitously\r\ntransformed to his extreme injury, and that the status of the Irish tenant\r\nhas been changed to his extreme advantage, in both instances without a\r\npretence to right. The Irish land system has been reduced to an almost\r\nhopeless state; it presents some of the worst features of the past; its\r\nconditions discourage the improvement of the land, promote its\r\ndeterioration in many ways, and banish capital away from it; and its plain\r\ntendency has been to make agriculture decline. And the revolution, which\r\nhas been thus accomplished, has aggravated the divisions of classes in\r\nIreland, and has been attended with ruinous litigation on a huge scale;\r\nand it has produced demoralisation far-reaching and profound, a sense of\r\ninsecurity in all landed relations, and a far too general disregard of the\r\nrespect due to contract. The policy, too, of so-called 'Land Purchase' has\r\nbeen accompanied with a train of evils on the increase. It is not\r\ncreating, as its authors fondly hoped, a class of loyal and thriving\r\nfreeholders; it is not even creating a body of industrious and improving\r\nfarmers. It is, on the contrary, developing, in some of its parts, the bad\r\nland system of the eighteenth century; it has proved injurious to\r\nagriculture in one important respect. Above all, from the very nature of\r\nthe case, it has drawn harsh, nay, unjust, distinctions between the landed\r\nclasses, which necessarily have been a cause of much discontent; and it\r\nhas inevitably provoked a demand for a universal confiscation of the Irish\r\nland even worse than any of those which have been the curse of Ireland.\r\n\r\nI pass from the material and general state of Ireland to that of the Irish\r\ncommunity, in its different parts. That community is still divided, as it\r\nhas been for ages, into three separate and distinct peoples, marked off\r\nfrom each other in race and faith; whatever 'Nationalist' leaders may\r\nassert, it is not, and has never been, in a real sense, a nation. The\r\nlines of demarcation between Catholic, Presbyterian, and Protestant\r\nIreland are at least as clearly defined as they have always been; they\r\nhave probably been widened by the troubles of late years, and by the\r\nlegislation which has been a consequence. Catholic Ireland has a\r\npopulation of some three millions and a half of souls; it is in the main a\r\nCeltic race, but with a considerable admixture of other elements; it has\r\npassed through a revolution remarkable and immense. Sixty years ago, the\r\nworst parts of the Penal Code had long been things of the past; but the\r\nIrish Catholics had only recently thrown off the last remains of that\r\nthraldom, under O'Connell's guidance; and their emancipation had only been\r\neffected by a great and very threatening movement. They were still\r\ncomparatively an alien and a subject people; they had not many owners of\r\nland; they were not numerous in the upper trading and the professional\r\nclasses; education was greatly wanting among them; they were for the most\r\npart a backward and poor peasantry, almost serfs of landlords distinct in\r\ncreed and in blood; and they formed the bulk of the teeming millions that\r\nvegetated on the soil in indigent misery. The Irish Catholics, too, had\r\nstill many and real grievances; the tithe of the Established Church had\r\nlong been an unjust burden on the petty husbandman; it had recently given\r\nrise to a frightful war of classes, and had only been commuted a short\r\ntime; the Established Church itself was a moral wrong, felt acutely by the\r\nIrish priesthood at least. Catholic Ireland, besides, was deeply sunk in\r\nignorance; the system of national education had only begun to flourish;\r\nand the Irish Catholic was still all but wholly excluded from county\r\nadministration and municipal government. The worst of these grievances,\r\nhowever, was the state of the tenure of the land; this was especially\r\nharsh on the Catholic peasant; if oppression was not general or even\r\ncommon, he was too often subjected to excessive rent and unfair eviction.\r\nThis order of things has all but completely passed away; the position of\r\nCatholic Ireland in the State has almost wholly been changed. Catholic\r\nemancipation has long been an accomplished fact; Irish Catholics and\r\nProtestants are equal before the law; and have really equal chances in\r\nfighting the battle of life. Though still not numerous, the Catholic\r\nowners of land have multiplied; the Irish Catholic middle classes have\r\nmade a marked advance; they have grown in knowledge and increased in\r\nwealth; they have risen to a higher plane of existence. At the same time,\r\nthe grievances of the past have nearly all been removed by law, often\r\nindeed very late, and by questionable means; but the Established Church\r\nhas fallen from its high estate; education has been diffused through the\r\nCatholic masses; the Irish Catholics have obtained more than a just share\r\nin local government and administration of all kinds; their ascendency in\r\nthis province is well-nigh assured. The most important, however, of these\r\nchanges is that which has taken place in the state of the Irish Catholic\r\npeasantry. The process which lifted up millions of these from the land and\r\nsent them into exile was, no doubt, terrible; but it was the condition of\r\nthe welfare and the progress of the population which remained. A great\r\ndeal of the legislation, besides, which has revolutionised the tenure of\r\nland in Ireland, and has had a special effect on the Catholic occupiers of\r\nthe soil, has been essentially ill designed and unjust; above all, it has\r\nbeen much too long delayed. But the Irish Catholic peasantry have long ago\r\nceased to be serfs; they are more the owners of their own holdings than\r\ntheir former landlords; their rights in the land have been more than\r\nprotected; they have acquired the fee in their farms in thousands of\r\ninstances; the days of rack rents and harsh evictions have passed away for\r\never. If the lines of the old Irish land system may still be traced, they\r\nrather resemble, it has truly been said, the lineaments of a phantom than\r\nof a living being.\r\n\r\nThe attitude, however, of Catholic Ireland, and the sentiments of the\r\nimmense majority of the Irish Catholics, must cause painful misgivings in\r\nreflecting minds. Their aristocracy, indeed, and their landed gentry have\r\nalways been loyal and true subjects; they can scarcely be distinguished\r\nfrom their Protestant fellows. The Irish Catholics, too, of the upper\r\nmiddle classes are generally attached to the institutions under which they\r\nlive; and Catholic Ireland has produced many eminent public servants, and\r\nhas given splendid ornaments to the Bench and the Bar. But the spirit that\r\nprevails among the Irish Catholic lower middle classes, and notably among\r\nthe masses of the peasantry, and the opinions and feelings they\r\nostentatiously avow, are deeply to be regretted in many respects.\r\nNotwithstanding all that has been done for it, and the immense reforms\r\nmade in its interest, this part of Catholic Ireland is, beyond question,\r\nmore disaffected and disloyal to the State than it was when O'Connell was\r\nits master spirit; it is more hostile to government, law, and the existing\r\norder of things. The teaching of the Land and the National Leagues, and of\r\nthe successor which has taken their place, has penetrated into the\r\nCorporations and Local Boards, in which the Catholic Irish are supreme;\r\nthese assemblies echo with revolutionary and socialistic cries, and\r\ndenounce the whole system of British rule in Ireland, aiming especially at\r\nthe Sovereign and those in the highest places. The Irish Catholics, too,\r\nin the three provinces of the south, have gained a complete ascendency in\r\ncounty and municipal affairs; their first object has been to exclude the\r\nlanded gentry from them, and to destroy the influence which belongs to\r\nproperty; and they have exhibited tendencies absolutely opposed to the\r\nConstitution to which they owe their authority. The worst symptoms,\r\nhowever, appear in the state of the peasantry; they have obtained\r\nadvantages of which their fathers never even dreamed; the land system has\r\nbeen turned upside down for their behoof; they have no grievance in landed\r\nrelations; and yet they remain unfriendly to the State, and show no sign\r\nof gratitude. This class contains the multitudes, who for more than twenty\r\nyears, have allied themselves with a conspiracy against our power in\r\nIreland, and who, at the bidding of designing men, shout treasonable\r\nutterances at mob gatherings, and denounce the 'Saxon' and 'landlordism'\r\nwith one voice; and though they are a timid and somewhat inert mass, and\r\nthey would not rise like their fathers in 1798, they would not lift a hand\r\nto support our rule were foreign invaders to descend on our shores. This\r\nstate of opinion, no doubt, is intelligible to the real student of Irish\r\nhistory; the Irish Catholics are a people who have been cruelly wronged;\r\nthey have only slowly risen out of serf-like thraldom; above all, they\r\nhave only attained the position they hold in the State after long years of\r\ntrials, and by giving trouble; they treasure the Celtic traditions of the\r\npast; we may regret that they are what they are, but can hardly feel\r\nsurprise. In other respects, the Irish Catholic masses, especially in a\r\ndemocratic age, must arouse the solicitude of thinkers worthy of the name.\r\nMany thousands of them are still illiterate; they are too generally the\r\nmere followers of priests and demagogues, tossed hither and thither as\r\ntheir masters direct; they are animated by crude and wild ideas, like the\r\npeasantry of France before the Revolution; they have scarcely anything in\r\ncommon with the corresponding class in England, trained for centuries in\r\nhabits of well-ordered liberty. They form, in a word, a dangerous and\r\neasily led democracy; and yet, owing to recent legislation, ever to be\r\ndeplored, they possess almost a monopoly of political power in Ireland,\r\nand have sent representatives to Parliament whose acts are a byword.\r\n\r\nConciliation, therefore, as the phrase is, has failed in the case of the\r\ngreatest part of Catholic Ireland; this remains an alien, even a perilous,\r\nelement in the State; it is worse than useless to shut our eyes to the\r\ntruth; the time is still apparently distant when it will become contented\r\nand loyal. Presbyterian Ireland is a people of rather more than half a\r\nmillion of souls, almost concentrated within a nook of Ulster; it was\r\nrebellious in sentiment a hundred years ago; it is now devotedly attached\r\nto the British connection, and has firmly supported the Union during a\r\nperiod of trouble. This community, nevertheless, of artisans and farmers\r\nis rather widely separated from the aristocracy in their midst, for the\r\nmost part English in blood, and of the Anglican faith; and though the\r\nPresbyterian farmer has obtained the benefit of the late reforms of land\r\ntenure, and has received advantages far in excess of justice, he declares\r\nhimself to be discontented with his lot, and is clamouring for a vast\r\nconfiscation of the Irish land in his selfish interest. The Irish\r\nProtestants are a population rather larger than the Presbyterians; but\r\nthey are scattered over all parts of the country; they do not possess the\r\npolitical influence of their distant kinsmen in Ulster. They comprise at\r\nleast three-fourths of the leading landed gentry, and a considerable\r\nnumber of the better class of farmers; they predominate in the learned\r\nprofessions, and in the higher walks of commerce. But their lower orders\r\nfeel the loss of the ascendency which was once their birthright; they have\r\nbeen thrust out from corporate and local government; they are isolated\r\namidst a population not in sympathy with them; as a people they can hardly\r\nbe described as prosperous. As to the Protestant landed gentry, they have\r\nfor centuries been the most loyal of subjects; it is significant that they\r\nhave been called the British garrison by the conspirators who seek to\r\noverthrow our rule in Ireland; they have given many eminent worthies to\r\nthe State, and proved their devotion to it at the gravest crises; what\r\nthey are has been shown in the war in South Africa. At present, however,\r\nprofound and just discontent has sunk deep into the hearts of this order\r\nof men. They are the heirs of conquest and confiscation, it is said; but\r\nthey were placed in the position they hold by English kings and\r\nParliaments; is that any reason that, within the last half-century, the\r\nNemesis of conquest and confiscation should have been invoked against\r\nthem, in the Encumbered Estates Act and predatory agrarian laws? They were\r\ntoo much of an exclusive caste, separated from their dependents, and\r\npossessing powers over the occupiers of the soil, which were sometimes\r\nabused; is that any reason that they should have been deprived of\r\npolitical influence, supplanted by the bureaucratic Castle, changed from\r\nowners of their estates into mere pensioners, shut out by the force of law\r\nfrom local and county government? What, however, the Irish landed gentry\r\nmost deeply feel is that, in the course of the last sixty years, they have\r\nbeen deceived, nay, betrayed, by British statesmen, who, having repeatedly\r\nassured them that their position was secure, have sacrificed them when it\r\nseemed to suit their purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial Parliament has, during the last century, had absolute control\r\nover the affairs of Ireland. No impartial student of history will deny\r\nthat it has governed Ireland very much better than her old Parliament\r\ncould possibly have done, after the dreadful rising of 1798 had literally\r\ntorn the country to pieces. The large majority of thinking persons have\r\nlong ago been convinced that the policy of Home Rule, that is, the\r\nsubstitution for the Houses at Westminster of a statutory legislature\r\nseated in Dublin, would be disastrous to the Empire and Ireland alike; and\r\nthat the evils attendant on the present system would be aggravated a\r\nhundred-fold by the revolution Mr. Gladstone tried to effect. Nor can it\r\nbe questioned that the Imperial Parliament has, for a long period,\r\nsincerely desired to legislate and rule for the good of Ireland, and has\r\naccomplished important Irish reforms, whatever legitimate exceptions may\r\nbe taken to them. Protestant ascendency and the Established Church have\r\nfallen; the law has long been indifferent to Irishmen of all classes;\r\neducation has been brought home to the mass of the people; the tenure of\r\nland has been transformed, unwisely no doubt, but wholly in the interest\r\nof the occupiers of the soil. Nevertheless, much that the Imperial\r\nParliament has done, and left undone, in the Victorian era, remains matter\r\nof censure and regret; and its Irish administration has been in many\r\nrespects unfortunate. The neglect to make a provision for the Irish\r\nCatholic priesthood, a main object of Pitt and of our best statesmen, when\r\nthe Anglican Church was disestablished in 1869, was a grave and a\r\ncalamitous mistake; the attempts that have been made to reform the Irish\r\nland system have, with scarcely an exception, been sorry failures; the\r\nresults have been, in no doubtful sense, deplorable. Few, too, will\r\njustify such measures as the establishment in Ireland of household\r\nsuffrage, that is, giving a monopoly of political power to an ignorant and\r\npriest-ridden democracy,[15] and depriving property and intelligence of\r\nall influence, or as the handing over county and city government, in\r\nthree-fourths of Ireland, to much the same classes. Nor are even positive\r\nerrors such as these the worst, perhaps, that can be laid to the charge of\r\nthe Imperial Parliament in the conduct of Irish affairs. With rare\r\nexceptions, the reforms it has made have been, unhappily, too late, and\r\nhave been obtained only through menacing popular movements; it has over\r\nand over again made Irish questions the mere subjects of the selfish\r\nstrife of party, with evil consequences for Irish interests; it has\r\noccasionally, and even for large spaces of time, shown a marked\r\nindifference to reasonable Irish demands; and its administration of\r\nIreland has repeatedly been inconsistent, even contradictory,\r\nshortsighted, and feeble. It must be acknowledged, indeed, that the rule\r\nof the Imperial Parliament, in the circumstances in which Ireland has been\r\nplaced, is, from the nature of the case, faulty in many respects; it is\r\nthat of a dominant assembly practically controlling a subject dependency;\r\nand, as we see in the striking instances of Athens and Rome, this kind of\r\ngovernment has never been free from great and real objections. This, no\r\ndoubt, is no reason that we should fly from less to unbearable evils, and\r\nadopt the fatal scheme of Home Rule; and the causes that have made our\r\nParliamentary _regime_ in Ireland as defective as it is are evident, and,\r\nas I shall point out afterwards, may probably be removed, to some extent\r\nat least, without subverting the constitution of these realms. But the\r\nbroad fact remains, and cannot be concealed; the Imperial Parliament, much\r\nas it has done, has not reached the hearts or gained, in any degree, the\r\nsympathy of an immense majority of the Irish people.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion, indeed, has been made only too manifest, if we look back\r\nat the history of Ireland within living memory. The Catholic Association\r\ndefied the Imperial Parliament, and was supreme in four-fifths of Ireland,\r\nfrom 1824 to 1829; O'Connell, in 1843, rallied the Irish Catholic millions\r\nto the cause of the Repeal of the Union, that is, to the subversion of\r\nBritish rule from the Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear. Home Rule became a\r\npopular cry when proclaimed by Butt; Parnell soon rose to the head of an\r\nIrish faction, which deliberately tried to paralyse and cross Parliament,\r\nand to make its sway in Ireland of no avail and contemptible. The Land\r\nLeague and the National League were essentially conspiracies of foreign\r\norigin, and they appealed to socialistic greed in a season of distress;\r\nbut their chief object was to annihilate British power in Ireland; they\r\nhad the support of huge Catholic masses; they returned to Parliament a\r\nband of more than eighty men, one of whose purposes was to checkmate its\r\nauthority. Too much is not to be made of these movements; three-fourths at\r\nleast of the Irish community have repeatedly been led away by able but\r\nunscrupulous leaders, and rush into courses to which they are not\r\nearnestly inclined; but these unquestionable facts assuredly prove that\r\nthe institutions under which they exist are not acceptable to the great\r\nbody of the people of Ireland. This attitude has been displayed with\r\nmarked and too plain significance, within a period, as it were, of\r\nyesterday. The United Irish League fills the place of the Land and the\r\nNational Leagues; it is a conspiracy against the State, like its\r\nforerunners; it aims ultimately at the same objects; its organisation and\r\nmachinery are the same; it seeks to establish its domination by similar\r\nmethods. It is, no doubt, less formidable than the Land and the National\r\nLeagues; it has received little support from America, and has no one to\r\ncompare with Parnell at its head; but it has sent more than three-fourths\r\nof the representatives of Ireland into the House of Commons; and these\r\nhave combined to put in force the arts of obstruction with an audacity, a\r\nperseverance, and a measure of success, perhaps never so conspicuous\r\nbefore. Its authority is less far-reaching than that of its predecessors;\r\nbut it has established a reign of tyranny in not a few counties; it is\r\nlargely backed by the Irish priesthood and by much the greatest part of\r\nCatholic Ireland; and its leaders boast, not without truth, that, disloyal\r\nas many of their utterances are, they are completely in accord with\r\npopular sympathies. The acts and the speeches, indeed, of these men have\r\nnever been more unequivocal than within the last two or three years;[16]\r\nyet almost everywhere they obtain the applause and the support of the\r\nmultitude. An Irish contingent was sent to fight for the Boers; the war in\r\nSouth Africa was yelled at, at huge public meetings, as an odious instance\r\nof English tyranny and crime; every reverse that befell our arms was\r\nwelcomed; the Irish masses, especially of late, have made a display of\r\ntheir antipathy to, and hatred of, the State. There was an outbreak of\r\ndisloyal rioting in Dublin at the Diamond Jubilee; but for the accident of\r\nthe Spanish War there would have been a great commemoration of the\r\nrebellion of 1798; even the visit of the late Queen to Ireland was made an\r\noccasion for seditious speeches; if her death was very generally mourned,\r\npublic bodies were found to refuse an expression of regret.\r\n\r\nIrish administration, I have remarked, is in many respects faulty; this is\r\nmainly because it is dependent on British parties; it fluctuates as one or\r\nthe other prevails in Parliament. It sometimes represents completely\r\nopposite principles; besides, as Lord-Lieutenants and Chief Secretaries\r\nusually hold office for a short time only, they are tempted to adopt a\r\nhand-to-mouth policy, and to govern with little thought of the morrow. A\r\nmarked change, however, has, in the course of time, passed over the\r\nordinary system of administration carried on at the Castle. The\r\naristocracy and the leading Irish gentry had still, even at the beginning\r\nof the Victorian age, much influence in directing local affairs; their\r\nauthority was not nearly as great as it had been; but they were still\r\nlooked up to and consulted by the central government. This state of things\r\nhas long ago ceased to exist; this order of men has long ago lost all\r\npolitical, and nearly all social, power; it has been superseded by a\r\nbureaucratic _regime_, depending mainly on paid officials and police,\r\nwhich rules Ireland from the Castle, with little external support. This\r\nmode of government is imposing and apparently strong; but it is\r\nessentially weak, and has little real hold on the country; the\r\ninformation, with which it is amply supplied, is often false, and\r\noccasionally causes grave mistakes; it forms an administrative system\r\nresembling that of the old centralised monarchy of France, of which\r\nTocqueville has exposed the defects and the vices. Under this _regime_,\r\nhowever, the law of the land has certainly been vindicated more\r\nsuccessfully than had been the case before; the Government has acquired\r\ndecidedly increased power in dealing with disorders dangerous to the\r\nState, and perhaps in holding the scales of justice even between divided\r\nclasses; it has not diminished the strife of hostile Irish factions, but\r\nit has maintained order more completely than of old; and this\r\nunquestionably is a great advantage, and a real set-off against some\r\nmischiefs and failures. It would be untrue to assert that this system of\r\nrule has been the paramount and even a main cause of the great decline in\r\nagrarian crime and trouble which Ireland has happily witnessed of late\r\nyears; other and far more potent causes have concurred; but it may fairly\r\nbe said that it has contributed to it. It would, however, be a complete\r\nmistake to suppose that agrarian disorder, even in its worst aspects, has\r\nbecome permanently a thing of the past in Ireland, or that this\r\ndestructive curse of Irish social life has not immense influence even at\r\nthis moment, though its outward manifestations have been greatly changed.\r\nIt was, so to speak, only yesterday that, under the auspices of the Land\r\nand the National Leagues, there was the most frightful outbreak of\r\nagrarian crime that had been seen since the great tithe conflict; it\r\nassumed the proportions, in fact, of a horrible servile war; and shallow,\r\nindeed, the understanding must be which imagines that this state of things\r\ncan never recur. If open agrarian disorder, too, has been largely\r\ndiminished, the spirit of agrarian disorder is still strong; and it is\r\ndoing infinite mischief in many parts of Ireland. Steadily adhering to the\r\nprecepts laid down by Parnell, the United Irish League has brought the\r\ndetestable system of 'boycotting' to a hideous perfection in several\r\ncounties; whole districts are subject to this secret but villainous\r\ntyranny; the results are seen in numbers of derelict farms, in hundreds of\r\nvictims writhing under ever-present terror, in an infamous interference\r\nwith trade and industry. This malignant influence is more or less felt\r\nthrough nearly the whole of the southern provinces, and even to a\r\nconsiderable extent in Ulster; it should be added that the United Irish\r\nLeague, for the present, discourages active agrarian crime, though its\r\nagents hold this force in reserve; it believes it can compass its ends\r\nwithout making use of this weapon.[17]\r\n\r\nA few words must be said, in this short survey, on the organisations that\r\nuphold the Christian faith in Ireland. The disestablished Anglican Church\r\nhas certainly made progress in spiritual life; it has more moral and even,\r\nperhaps, social influence than when it was an appurtenance of the Erastian\r\nCastle. It has been admirably administered and ruled; the uses of\r\nadversity have been sweet to it, and it has been successfully launched on\r\nits new career; this is a strong proof of the inherent energy and capacity\r\nof the Anglo-Protestant Irish people. Very different, too, from what had\r\nbeen expected, moderation and wisdom prevail in its councils; its clergy\r\nare sincerely pious, but not given to extreme doctrines; its members are\r\nfor the most part free from the narrow sectarian views which had formerly,\r\nnot without reason, been laid to their charge. Its funds, amassed by good\r\nmanagement, are, for the present, ample; but the rapid impoverishment of\r\nthe landed gentry, the class from which it chiefly obtains support, and\r\nthe confiscation with which they are threatened, no doubt expose it to\r\nfuture dangers; and it must always be the Church of a small minority,\r\nsurrounded by influences hostile to it, but a Church which the State is\r\nbound to protect. The Presbyterian Church of Ireland has but little\r\nchanged; it has felt the effect of the great religious movement, which has\r\nstirred the Three Kingdoms in the last half-century, and it is less\r\nrationalistic than it once was; but it is still what it always was, a\r\npowerful centre of the faith of John Knox, with a communion of strong\r\ndemocratic sympathies. The Catholic Church of Ireland still rests on the\r\nold foundations; but it is hardly the unshaken structure it was in the\r\nlast generation. Its material resources have enormously increased; its\r\nfine edifices spread over the land; it still exercises immense influence\r\nover probably nine-tenths of Catholic Ireland. But a party has been\r\ngrowing up within it which resents, and has even defied, its pretensions;\r\nand though the power it possesses is, in the main, beneficent in the\r\nextreme, this has too often been abused in the domain of politics, and\r\nespecially of late in Irish landed relations. The priesthood still largely\r\ndirect their flocks, but they are more dependent on them than they once\r\nwere; had it been otherwise, they would have hardly conformed to the\r\nbidding of the Land and the National Leagues, as unhappily they did in too\r\nmany instances. Their leading men perceived from the first that these\r\nconspiracies were destructive of their moral influence; and had the whole\r\nbody of the clergy received a just provision from the State, it would all\r\nbut certainly have condemned the methods of the Leagues as these were\r\ndecisively condemned by Rome. For the rest, the Catholic Church of Ireland\r\nis no friend of Protestant England, and of many of the institutions that\r\nexist in Ireland; but this has been inevitable from the events of Irish\r\nhistory; and whatever may be said, it has been essentially an ally of the\r\nState, by reason of its great religious authority. And if properly\r\nunderstood, it is a mighty conservative power, which ought if possible to\r\nbe won over to the side of order and law; this is an ample, if there were\r\nno other, reason that statesmen should comply with its most reasonable\r\ndemand, and remove the grievance, in high Catholic education, that only\r\nblind bigotry can deny.\r\n\r\nThe administration of justice in Ireland is better, on the whole, than it\r\nwas in the early Victorian era. It is not only that the law's delay has\r\nbeen to a considerable extent, remedied, as it has been, in England, by an\r\nimproved procedure. Traces of Protestant ascendency were to be seen on\r\nthe Irish Bench sixty years ago, though these were evanescent and few;\r\nsuch a trial as that of O'Connell in 1844, marked by partiality and even\r\nby wrong, would be simply impossible at the present time. Trial by jury,\r\nhowever, in Ireland too often reflects the animosities and prejudices of\r\nclass, and is liable to grave perversion and errors; it is sometimes\r\nnecessary, in causes where religious or political feeling is engaged, to\r\nmake a careful selection in forming juries, in order that common right\r\nshould be done; this inevitable, but invidious, process, held up to\r\nexecration by the name of 'packing,' is certainly a matter that causes\r\nregret. The fairness seen in the administration of the law in Ireland has\r\nbeen strikingly illustrated of late years; leaders and agents of the Land\r\nand the National Leagues have had to answer for their offences in the\r\ninferior courts; but despite rabid clamour against what is called\r\n'coercion,' the conduct of these inquiries has not been really impugned. A\r\nlaudable attempt, however, to make the magisterial bench more popular, has\r\nlately placed on it an order of men, of whom some have abused their power;\r\nthese instances, nevertheless, have not been frequent; the experiment\r\ncannot be pronounced a failure. The intellect of Ireland is not so\r\nfruitful as it was in the generation before the union; she has no\r\npolitical thinkers to be named with Burke, no writer of fiction equal to\r\nMaria Edgeworth, no dramatist to be compared to Sheridan, no orators who\r\nhave reached the heights of eloquence reached by Grattan, Curran, Plunket,\r\nand other glories of her defunct Parliament. But there has been progress\r\nin this respect within the last sixty years; Ireland cannot boast of such\r\npublic men as O'Connell, Sheil, and even Spring Rice; but she possesses\r\nDufferin in the diplomatic sphere, and Lecky, and one or two others of\r\nrepute in that of letters; she has only recently lost Lord Cairns and Lord\r\nRussell. The improvement of primary education in Ireland has been\r\nimmense; the land is full of elementary schools, which, in the last\r\ngeneration, were, comparatively, very few, and though a considerable part\r\nof the population is still illiterate, the greater part, whose fathers\r\nwere sunk in ignorance, has felt the good influence of the light of\r\nknowledge. High education, too, has advanced in Ireland; Trinity College\r\nis greater than before as a place of learning; if two of the Queen's\r\nColleges have certainly failed, the Royal University has been, in a sense,\r\nsuccessful. But, as I shall point out, in subsequent pages, University\r\neducation in Ireland remains defective; a University for the Irish\r\nCatholic upper middle class is a requirement rightly demanded from\r\nParliament. As for Irish secondary education, it is still backward, but\r\nthere is hope of improvement in this respect; the general standard of\r\nIrish education, it should be added, is, except at Trinity College, low,\r\nthough this has been inevitable if we look back at the events of history.\r\nIrish opinion generally still embodies the deep-seated animosities and\r\nstrife of race and faith, at least as fully as it ever did; with few\r\nexceptions this appears in the tone of the newspaper press. The utterances\r\nof many of the self-styled 'Nationalist' journals have been far more\r\nhostile to the State, and are conceived in a much worse spirit, than those\r\nof the same class of journals in O'Connell's day.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the condition of Ireland, as a whole, we see that there has\r\nbeen some material progress, but with retrogression in important respects;\r\nand if a certain measure of good has been done, great wrong and evil have\r\nbeen accomplished, in the principal and the most far-reaching of her\r\nsocial relations. Her moral and political progress has been at least\r\ndoubtful; notwithstanding immense and searching reforms, the mass of the\r\npopulation is more disaffected than of old; discontent largely pervades\r\nthe classes most loyal to the State; if the mere power of government has\r\nincreased, its beneficent influence is but little recognised; the great\r\nbody of the community maintains a hostile attitude. The crooked has not\r\nbeen made straight in Ireland, nor the rough places plain; a state of\r\nsociety exists, in which, as the Greek poet said, 'the fountains flow\r\nbackwards, and things are out of joint.' An old order has nearly passed\r\naway; but the new order that is replacing it is but of little promise; a\r\ntype of society has been well-nigh broken up, but a strong and solid type\r\nis not being formed in its stead; at all events, in the phrase of Bacon,\r\nthe time is still distant 'when the strings of the Irish harp will all be\r\nin tune;' many respond to the player's hand in discord. 'The Constitution\r\nin Ireland,' Peel once exclaimed, 'is not the British Constitution, but\r\nits ghastly image;' let us see what it is in Ireland at the present time.\r\nThe Sovereign is, in England, a main pillar of the State; he is a great\r\npolitical and social force; the Monarchy is enthroned in the heart of the\r\nnation. In Ireland he is almost an unknown name, associated with not a few\r\nevil memories; his influence, which ought to be immense over a Celtic\r\nrace, has never made itself sensibly felt. In England Parliament responds\r\nto the national will, and has gathered the reverence of ages around it; in\r\nIreland it is a foreign and alien assembly, with which the mass of the\r\npeople has no sympathy. In England the aristocracy is at the head of\r\npublic affairs, leads society, commands universal respect; in Ireland it\r\nhas lost all authority; has no weight in the National Councils; has no\r\npopular support, is even disliked at the Castle. In England the middle\r\nclass is enormously strong, and is the best bulwark of order and law; in\r\nEngland the democracy is almost wholly free from revolutionary ideas, as\r\nregards property, and seeks reforms by constitutional methods. In Ireland,\r\nit is unhappily quite otherwise; the middle class is comparatively weak,\r\nand, in its lower strata, is opposed to the existing order of things; the\r\ndemocracy is an easily led multitude, ready at its leaders' bidding to\r\nrush into socialistic courses. In England, too, the Commonwealth is\r\ncompletely secure; in Ireland there is literally no Commonwealth; and such\r\norganisations as the Land, the National, and the United Irish Leagues, are\r\ndangerous symptoms of a kind of Jacobin antipathy to the State. The words\r\nof Peel are still unhappily true; but painful as the contrast he pointed\r\nout is, even this is not the worst circumstance in the present condition\r\nof Irish affairs. What, I think, most alarms a reflecting mind, is the\r\nrestlessness that pervades the mass of the people, an eagerness for some\r\nundefined change, a demand for the universal spoliation of a class, a\r\nsense of insecurity spreading far and wide, a neglect of the pursuits of\r\ncalm industry in the hope of what a revolution may effect, an instability\r\nin the social fabric from top to bottom. The agitation, the disorder, and,\r\nI will add, the vicious legislation of late years, will, however, largely\r\nexplain these phenomena.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury's Ministry came into office, six years ago, at the head of\r\nthe most powerful majority that had been returned to the House of Commons\r\nsince the great Reform era. The time was singularly opportune to consider\r\nthe state of Ireland, and to deal with the Irish questions that required\r\nsound and wise treatment. The Opposition was paralysed by a rout at the\r\npolls; the National League conspiracy showed few signs of life; the\r\n'Nationalist' party was rent asunder; the community was more quiescent\r\nthan it had been for years. It would be unfair to deny that, since it\r\nacquired power, the Government has been beset by many and grave obstacles\r\nin legislating on domestic subjects; it has been encompassed by a sea of\r\nforeign troubles; it has had to conduct the protracted war in South\r\nAfrica. It would be absurd, too, to expect that it could, once for all,\r\nhave placed Irish affairs permanently on a secure basis; this can only be\r\nthe result of the wisdom of years aided by the healing influence of time.\r\nBut it has disappointed enlightened Irish opinion; it has not done, or\r\neven tried to do, what it might have accomplished. Undoubtedly parts of\r\nits policy have been good; it has effected something, if not much, in\r\ndeveloping the material resources of the west of Ireland, and in\r\nmitigating the danger and the stress of Irish poverty; it has carried on\r\nthe excellent work of Mr. Arthur Balfour in this respect; the Department\r\nof Agriculture it has lately formed will, not improbably, be of real use\r\nin promoting industry and self-reliance among the peasantry, on the\r\nprinciples advocated, a century and a half ago, by Berkeley. But\r\ncommendation, I think, must here end; the Government, I believe, has made\r\ngrave mistakes; it has assuredly not successfully dealt with the great\r\n'Case of Ireland,' greater now than in the days of Molyneux and Swift. It\r\nhas not reduced the excessive representation of Ireland in the House of\r\nCommons; until this is done the Union will not be secure. It has\r\ndisregarded the verdict of the important Commission which has declared\r\nthat Ireland has been immensely overtaxed for years; here it defies\r\nuniversal Irish opinion; and having pledged itself to make a further\r\ninquiry, it has not hitherto taken a step to redeem its pledge. It is\r\ndivided on the question of high education in Ireland, and professes that\r\nthis must be an 'open question,' as if this was not unwise and perilous;\r\nand though it has appointed a Commission to report on the subject,\r\nCatholic Ireland very possibly may not obtain the place of learning which\r\nit is entitled to demand. Above all, on the capital question of the Irish\r\nland, the Government has certainly all but ignored the recommendations of\r\na Commission chosen by itself, and has refused to lessen the injustice\r\nproved to have been done wholesale; like its predecessors, in the case of\r\nthe Encumbered Estates Act, it is still bent on agrarian legislation that\r\nhas done infinite mischief. Its administration, too, up to this has not\r\nbeen successful; it has allowed the United Irish League to grow up and to\r\ngain strength, with far-spreading evil results; its conduct of Irish\r\naffairs has been weak and empirical, and notably marked by false\r\noptimistic fancies. Of late there has been improvement in this respect; we\r\ncan only hope it will not be abortive.\r\n\r\n'In this gigantic body,' Macaulay exclaimed fifty-seven years ago, 'there\r\nis one vulnerable part near the heart.'[18] The Empire has expanded into\r\nampler proportions than those described by the orator; its subject kings,\r\ndominations, princedoms, powers, above all, its myriads of many races and\r\ntongues, are united by far more durable ties than those which held it\r\ntogether in a generation that has passed away. Four years ago, Canada sent\r\nmessengers from her great lakes, Hindustan representatives of her ancient\r\ndynasties, the great island continent envoys from her free nations, to do\r\nhomage to Queen Victoria; the pageant, gathered 'within London's streaming\r\nroar,' was a magnificent spectacle of world-wide loyalty. England has seen\r\nanother and a still more wonderful sight; the martial sons of our great\r\nself-governing colonies have flocked in thousands to do battle in her\r\ncause, in the distant and ill-known wastes of South Africa; in a long,\r\nbloody, and sometimes disastrous conflict, they have proved themselves to\r\nbe worthy companions in arms of the offspring of the soldiery of Blenheim\r\nand Waterloo; they have fought and bled for England as if she was their\r\ncommon country. But Ireland, as regards the mass of the people, has, on\r\nboth occasions, stood sullenly aloof; her heart has gone out in sympathy\r\nwith the Boers; she remains, for the most part, hostile to our rule and\r\ndisloyal. It is mere foolishness to shut our eyes to plain facts; still\r\nmore so to join in the false paeans of interested partisans, and ignorant\r\nscribblers, who announce that because Ireland is, on the surface,\r\ncomparatively at peace, she is in every sense a contented or a happy land,\r\nfree from grave elements of political and social danger. She is still the\r\n'vulnerable part at the heart of the Empire;' the spectre at the great\r\nnational festival; the warning token, as in the case of the Oriental\r\ndespot, that human grandeur and power are, in the nature of things,\r\nmortal. She is still, as she was in the day of Spenser, a malign influence\r\nacross the path of our greatness, a riddle difficult to understand and\r\ninterpret; the many problems she still presents to the statesman are\r\nperplexing in the extreme, and await solution. That any policy will\r\nsuddenly remove the many evils apparent in her organic structure is a\r\ndelusion a rational mind rejects; the deep-seated ills in that distempered\r\nframe may never be completely and finally cured. Something effectual,\r\nnevertheless, may, I think, be done; I proceed to examine, in the\r\nfollowing chapters, the 'Present Irish Questions' that confront our\r\nrulers; and to consider what the amending hand may accomplish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF HOME RULE\r\n\r\n    The question of Home Rule not extinct--The reasons--Butt's scheme of\r\n    Home Rule--It is denounced and ridiculed by Mr. Gladstone, and\r\n    defeated in the House of Commons--Death of Butt--The Home Rule\r\n    movement becomes allied with a foreign conspiracy--Davitt and\r\n    Parnell--The Land League--Mr. Gladstone's surrender to it--The\r\n    movement makes no progress in the Parliament of 1880-85--The General\r\n    Election of 1885--Mr. Gladstone suddenly adopts the policy of Home\r\n    Rule--The probable reasons--The Home Rule Bill of 1886--Its nature and\r\n    tendencies--Decisive objections to the measure--It is rejected at the\r\n    General Election of 1886, having been previously rejected in the House\r\n    of Commons--Policy and conduct of Mr. Gladstone--The Home Rule\r\n    movement makes some progress in England, and why--The Home Rule Bill\r\n    of 1893--It is much worse than that of 1886--The reasons--It is\r\n    rejected by the House of Lords--Home Rule under different forms--The\r\n    Union must be maintained--Proposal that Parliament should occasionally\r\n    sit in Dublin--The over-representation of Ireland should be redressed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHome Rule, it is very generally assumed, has vanished into the domain of\r\nextinct politics. Unlike what had been the case from 1886 to 1895, when\r\nthis was the main of our domestic questions, Home Rule was scarcely\r\nreferred to at the late election; it will receive little countenance at\r\nthe hands of the present House of Commons, however Irish Nationalists may\r\npersist in urging their demand. It would, nevertheless, be imprudent to\r\nbelieve that this policy, as has been said, 'is as dead as Queen Anne,' as\r\nimpossible as a return to Protection or to an unreformed Parliament.\r\nIsaac Butt's scheme of Home Rule was treated with scorn and ridicule by\r\nMr. Gladstone during many years; Mr. Gladstone was the author of the Bills\r\nof 1886 and 1893, embodying Home Rule in forms few will now approve of;\r\nand he left nothing undone to convert them into law. At the General\r\nElection of 1880, Home Rule was regarded as a mere Irish craze, and hardly\r\na candidate could be found, in England and Scotland, to consent to an\r\ninquiry upon the subject; within six years Home Rule was a Ministerial\r\nmeasure; and though the House of Commons pronounced against it, and its\r\ndecision was emphatically ratified at the General Election of 1886, still,\r\non this occasion, the votes in favour of Home Rule were not much less\r\nnumerous than those cast against it.[19] In 1892 England condemned Home\r\nRule, if not as decisively as six years before; but Ireland, Scotland, and\r\nWales declared for it; and a Home Rule Bill received the sanction of the\r\nHouse of Commons, which, but for the resistance made by the House of\r\nLords, would now be a fundamental law of these realms. It deserves notice,\r\ntoo, that not one of the Liberal leaders, although, as a rule, they\r\navoided the subject, repudiated this policy at the late election; two or\r\nthree, indeed, gave it a qualified support; and it is evident that they\r\nkeep the question in reserve, in the hope of turning it to account at a\r\nmore convenient season. Nor can it be denied, as long as Ireland can send\r\nmore than eighty Nationalists into the House of Commons, pledged to insist\r\non Home Rule as their country's right, that the subject must command more\r\nor less attention; for many reasons it is impossible to ignore the claims\r\nof a representation so large in numbers. It must be added that, under our\r\nsystem of party government, especially as this has existed of late years,\r\na considerable group of politicians, with a fixed purpose, can effect much\r\nby throwing its weight indifferently into the Ministerial or the\r\nOpposition scale, and giving its support to either side, in order to\r\ncompass its own ends; it has, sometimes with successful results, swayed\r\nmajorities by these means, and not in vain. This is the hope of the Irish\r\nNationalist leaders; 'let parties in the House of Commons,' they cynically\r\nargue, 'be equally divided, as must at some time happen,' and 'we shall\r\ngain Home Rule from either Tories or Whigs, if we assist either by our\r\nvotes to keep them in office.' It cannot be said, if we look back at some\r\npolitical events within the last twenty years, that this expectation is\r\nwholly groundless; and though I am convinced it will not be realised, its\r\nexistence alone suffices to prove that Home Rule cannot yet be dismissed\r\nas outside the sphere of practical politics.\r\n\r\nHome Rule, therefore, is a 'Present Irish Question,' and if not at this\r\nmoment urgent, it remains the most important of Irish questions, for it\r\ndirectly affects the fortunes of the Three Kingdoms. It is necessary,\r\naccordingly, to examine it, in its principles at least; and an inquiry is\r\nopportune, at this juncture, for the subject can be fairly discussed in\r\nits different bearings, apart from the obscuring influences of national\r\nand party prejudice, and especially of political passion. Isaac Butt was\r\nthe true author of the conception of Home Rule; for though a movement in\r\nfavour of a Repeal of the Union had become dangerously active in 1843-44,\r\nand had been feebly intermittent since that period, this peculiar\r\nmodification of the arrangements made at the Union, in fixing the\r\nrelations between Great Britain and Ireland, was wholly an idea of that\r\ndistinguished lawyer. The occasion, on which this scheme was put forward,\r\nwas not a little remarkable for various reasons. Mr. Gladstone had just\r\ndisestablished the Anglican Church in Ireland, and had disendowed it, to a\r\nconsiderable extent; this policy was angrily resented by a party of Irish\r\nProtestants; for the maintenance of the Established Irish Church had been\r\nmade an essential condition of the Treaty of Union. These men, who were\r\nnot without energy and parts, declared that a great international compact\r\nhad been broken; and they gradually obtained the support of leaders of the\r\n'Young Ireland' following, of survivors of the 'Tail' of O'Connell, and\r\neven of adherents of the Fenian cause, all, in different degrees, opposed\r\nto the Union. Butt became the head and spokesman of this curiously\r\nassorted band, composed of essentially discordant elements; but he\r\nendeavoured to combine it into a strong Parliamentary force, by\r\npropounding a plan of Home Rule for Ireland, which he had thought out with\r\npatience and care, his hope being that this would unite his followers, and\r\nthat his project would at least be entertained in Parliament, and would\r\nnot be as hopeless as an attempt to repeal the Union. His views are set\r\nforth in his 'Irish Federalism,' a long-forgotten work, but which, even\r\nnow, may be read with profit. Butt professed, and I have no doubt\r\nsincerely, that he did not seek to disturb the Union, and that the\r\nImperial Parliament was to remain as it was; but he proposed to give\r\nIreland a Parliament of her own, with full powers of legislation on Irish\r\naffairs, and an Executive practically appointed by this, which would have\r\nthe government of Ireland in its hands. Having thus called into existence\r\nan Irish State, possessing State rights of supreme importance, he sought\r\nto connect Ireland with Great Britain by a Federal tie; representatives\r\nfrom Ireland were to repair to the Imperial Parliament, and to vote in\r\nthat assembly on Imperial questions, but not, as I believe Butt meant, on\r\nthose which belonged to England and Scotland.[20]\r\n\r\nThe cry of Home Rule was welcomed in Ireland by her Catholic masses; at\r\nthe General Election of 1874, sixty men were returned to the House of\r\nCommons to support this policy, a party formidable in numbers, if not in\r\nessential strength. Butt brought forward his plan, in outline, on three or\r\nfour occasions; but the question was not discussed with the fulness of\r\nknowledge and the breadth of view it certainly required; on the whole, it\r\nwas superficially treated. Neither Butt nor his opponents thoroughly\r\nperceived that his proposals virtually repealed the Union, for if the\r\nImperial Parliament was, nominally, to be left intact, a real Parliament\r\nwas to be placed in its stead, in Ireland, which would practically annul\r\nits effective authority, from the Giant's Causeway to Cape Clear; and they\r\nseem not to have understood that 'Irish Federalism' implied Federalism for\r\nGreat Britain to a great extent, and introduced into the Constitution the\r\nFederal principle with its far-reaching and dangerous effects. Butt's\r\nscheme, however, was powerfully attacked in its details; by no one so\r\npowerfully as by Mr. Gladstone, who had lately announced, to an approving\r\nmultitude, that Home Rule was sheer folly or worse, and had exultingly\r\nasked, 'Can any sensible man, can any rational man, suppose that, at this\r\ntime of day, in this condition of the world, we are going to disintegrate\r\nthe great capital institutions of the country for the purpose of making\r\nourselves ridiculous in the sight of all mankind, and crippling any power\r\nwe possess for bestowing benefits, through legislation, on the country to\r\nwhich we belong?'[21] Little knowing what the future was to bring forth,\r\nMr. Gladstone declared that Home Rule was not to be even thought of, until\r\nit could be proved that the Irish affairs, to which the Irish Parliament\r\nwas to be confined, could be separated from Imperial and British affairs,\r\na partition he evidently deemed impossible; and he insisted that the\r\nintroduction of Irish members into the Imperial Parliament, which,\r\naccording to this plan, was to have nothing to do with Ireland, was not\r\nonly essentially unjust, but involved the absurdity that these men 'were\r\nto judge as they might think fit of the general affairs of the Empire, and\r\nalso of exclusively English and Scotch questions,' an interpretation not,\r\nI believe, correct. Home Rule was rejected by overwhelming majorities in\r\nthe Parliament of 1874-80; and at the General Election of the last-named\r\nyear, it found no countenance, I have said, in England or Scotland. The\r\nsubject was scarcely referred to by Mr. Gladstone, wholly preoccupied by\r\nhis Midlothian campaign, and by his persistent efforts to deprive Lord\r\nBeaconsfield of power.\r\n\r\nButt had sincere reverence for the Constitution and the Law; the Home Rule\r\nmovement, as long as he was at its head, was a constitutional and a lawful\r\nmovement. But this eminent man had been supplanted, by degrees, by a\r\npolitician of a very different nature; and when he had passed away in the\r\nspring of 1879, Parnell, and what was called the 'active Irish party,'\r\nwhich had baffled and incensed the House of Commons, became the directors\r\nof the Home Rule policy. The character of the movement was almost wholly\r\nchanged; it became associated with a conspiracy hatched in the Far West,\r\nwhich aimed at the separation of Ireland from Great Britain; Butt's\r\nmoderate followers fell away from it, especially the band of Protestants\r\nwho had first set it on foot. Meanwhile, American Fenianism, which had in\r\nvain attempted open rebellion in Ireland in 1865-67, had, at the\r\ninstigation perhaps of Michael Davitt, made another effort to compass its\r\nends; the 'New Departure' in treason was made; the Land League was formed\r\nwith the avowed purpose of overthrowing 'Irish Landlordism,' as it was\r\ncalled, as being the mainstay of British power in Ireland, and then of\r\nwresting Ireland by force from her British rulers. But Davitt was not well\r\nfitted for his work; Parnell became the leader of the Home Rule and the\r\nLand League movements; and during a short visit to the United States, he\r\nopenly professed that his ultimate aim was 'to break the last link between\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland,' though he was still the chief of an apparently\r\nconstitutional cause. Ere long the Land League, availing itself of a\r\nseason of distress, and subsidised by Fenians across the Atlantic, had\r\ntaken root in different parts of Ireland; and gradually a reign of terror,\r\nmarked by detestable crime, and essentially of the Jacobin type, had\r\nacquired a frightful ascendency in ten or eleven counties. By this time,\r\nMr. Gladstone had become Minister: how he denounced the League in\r\npassionate language; endeavoured, for a few months, to hold it in check;\r\nsuccumbed to it, when he made the 'Kilmainham Treaty;' and, finally, how,\r\nafter declaring that Parnell and his adherents were 'aiming at\r\ndismemberment through rapine,' he became the author of the Land Act of\r\n1881, and threw the Irish landed gentry as a sop to Cerberus,--is\r\nsufficiently known, but I shall recur to the subject. During these years,\r\nParnell, artfully playing the double game, which this born conspirator\r\nespecially made his boast, and linking what he called 'a constitutional\r\nwith an illegal movement,' had more than once spoken on behalf of Home\r\nRule in the House of Commons, his moderate and even statesmanlike language\r\nbeing in marked contrast with his treasonable harangues in Ireland. But\r\nParliament had been otherwise engaged with Irish affairs; it had become\r\nmore averse to Home Rule than ever; it had learned what the movement had\r\nbegun to involve, veiled, if not open, rebellion against the State, and it\r\nvoted down the question by immense majorities. Statesmen of all parties,\r\nTory, Whig, and Radical, without exception, concurred in this view; Lord\r\nSalisbury, Lord Spencer, and John Bright alike condemned the very idea of\r\nHome Rule. Mr. Gladstone indeed asserted afterwards that he had a policy\r\nof this kind in his thoughts; but if he had, he kept it to himself; it\r\ncannot be gathered from his speeches of the time; he never breathed to\r\nhis colleagues a word about it; he allowed them to pronounce against Home\r\nRule with his full apparent sanction.[22]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's Ministry fell in 1885; Majuba, Gordon, and his Irish\r\npolicy had set the best sense of the country against him. Lord Salisbury's\r\nGovernment came in his place; for a short time the tendency, too often\r\nseen in British parties, to temporise with sedition and even crime in\r\nIreland was exhibited with untoward results; the negotiations between\r\nParnell and Lord Carnarvon have not yet been explained. At the General\r\nElection of 1885, Parnell openly took the Conservative side, denounced the\r\nLiberals in the bitterest language, and perhaps, through the influence of\r\nthe Irish vote, deprived them of a few seats in England. His principal\r\nobject certainly was to increase his own power and that of his band by\r\nweakening the strongest of British parties; but this association with the\r\nConservatives probably lessened the antipathy of their opponents to Home\r\nRule, and was not without effect on the events that followed. Ireland,\r\nhowever, was by no means a prominent question in this electoral contest;\r\nthe Tory, Whig, and Radical leaders dealt, for the most part, with\r\ndifferent topics; and though Mr. Gladstone dropped ambiguous phrases,\r\nwhich, he ere long contended, indicated his conversion to Home Rule, his\r\nlieutenants continued to declare against this policy, their chief\r\nremaining openly in accord with them; indeed, all that could be collected,\r\nfrom what he wrote and said, was that he called upon the country to give\r\nhim such decisive support as would make him independent of all Irish\r\nfactions. The result of this General Election, taken as a whole, was to\r\ngain for the Liberals a majority of some eighty seats in Great Britain;\r\nbut in Ireland it effected a notable change in politics. By a recent,\r\nand, for Ireland, a most unwise statute, the electoral franchise had been\r\nassimilated in the Three Kingdoms; political ascendency had, for the first\r\ntime, been secured for the masses of Catholic Ireland, largely an ignorant\r\nand superstitious multitude; property and intelligence were overwhelmed at\r\nthe polls; and Parnell and his satellites, now called Nationalists, won\r\nmore than eighty seats out of a total of one hundred and three. The\r\nLiberal majority, therefore, would be effaced should the Irish leader and\r\nhis men give the Conservatives their votes; a weak Government would be the\r\ninevitable result; Mr. Gladstone, now in his seventy-sixth year, could\r\nhardly expect to return to office. In these circumstances, it became\r\ngradually known that Mr. Gladstone had accepted Home Rule in principle,\r\nand was even prepared to legislate upon the subject. It would be unfair to\r\nassert that personal motives alone determined this sudden resolve; though\r\nobviously should the Liberal chief retain the allegiance of his party, and\r\ndraw Parnell and the Nationalists to his side, by inaugurating Home Rule\r\nas a practical measure, he would inevitably be restored to power with a\r\ngreat majority. Mr. Gladstone, ever ready to yield to a popular cry, may\r\nhave believed that five-sixths of Ireland were passionately eager for Home\r\nRule; he may have been convinced himself that, as affairs now stood,\r\nParliament would well-nigh be reduced to a deadlock should nothing be done\r\nto redress the balanced state of parties, and that Home Rule was the\r\ncondition of a stable Government; he may have thought that since the\r\nConservative dalliance with Parnell, it had become impossible permanently\r\nto resist this policy; yet these considerations form no apology for the\r\nconduct of the aged, but most impulsive, statesman. Only a few years\r\nbefore large parts of Ireland had been in a state of frightful anarchy; a\r\nrebellious and socialistic movement against British rule and Irish landed\r\nproperty had acquired great force; even at the present time, the National\r\nLeague, replacing the Land League, kept disorder prevalent in many\r\ncounties. Was this the moment to effect a revolution in Ireland, to tamper\r\nwith, and to impair, the Union, to hand over the loyalty, the property,\r\nand the worth of the island to the classes and the men against whom but,\r\nas yesterday, it had been necessary to put the severest coercion in force?\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury resigned office in the first months of 1886; Mr. Gladstone\r\nbecame Prime Minister in his stead. Had parties in the House of Commons\r\nremained unchanged, the prospect for the old statesman would have been\r\nauspicious; the Liberals and Nationalists combined would have been\r\nsupreme; Home Rule would have been the fruit of the new alliance. But the\r\nmost distinguished men of the Liberal party, resenting a coalition far\r\nworse than that of Fox and North, and convinced that Home Rule would be\r\nruinous to the State, fell off from their leader in large numbers; the\r\npowerful Press of Great Britain, with few exceptions, emphatically\r\ncondemned the Minister's conduct. Mr. Gladstone, however, did not pause in\r\nhis violent course; he introduced his first Home Rule Bill in April, 1886.\r\nI can only glance at the main features of this famous measure, and devote\r\nto it a passing comment.[23] A Parliament was to be established in the\r\nIrish capital; this, subject to the limitations set forth in the Bill, was\r\npractically to exercise supreme power in Ireland. This Parliament was to\r\nbe composed of two Orders, the first containing one hundred and three\r\nmembers, and formed of a few Irish peers and of men of some substance; the\r\nsecond comprising two hundred and four or two hundred and six members\r\nelected on the existing democratic franchise. The two Orders were\r\nordinarily to sit together; but should differences in legislative\r\nmeasures arise, the first Order was, for a short time, to have a\r\nsuspensive veto on the decisions of the second Order, which, however,\r\npossessing an immense majority, would almost necessarily in the long run\r\ncompletely prevail. The Irish Parliament was precluded from legislating on\r\nmany subjects, for the most part Imperial, but partly domestic; it was\r\nnotably to have no control over the Customs and Excise of Ireland, which\r\nwere to be kept in the hands of the Imperial Parliament; and though it was\r\npermitted to impose any other taxes, the whole revenue of Ireland was to\r\npass through the hands of a British official, who was to pay into the\r\nImperial Treasury a sum of about four millions sterling, as a contribution\r\nfrom Ireland, for Imperial purposes, before the Irish Treasury could\r\nreceive a farthing. Bills voted by the Irish Parliament might be annulled\r\nby the veto of the Lord-Lieutenant and perhaps of the British Ministry;\r\nand the Judicial Committee of the English Privy Council, reinforced by a\r\nsmall body of Irish judges, was to have the power to pronounce Acts of the\r\nIrish Parliament void, if inconsistent with its constitutional rights.\r\nSubject, however, to these restrictions and checks, the Irish Parliament\r\nwas to be a sovereign power in Ireland; it could practically appoint or\r\ndisplace the Irish Executive Government; it could enact, change, or repeal\r\nany laws it should think fit; it could pass any resolutions it pleased; if\r\nan assembly partly subordinate, it would be largely supreme. Ireland was\r\nto have no representatives in the Imperial Parliament, though this could\r\ndispose of the Irish Customs and Excise; no Irish protest could be made at\r\nWestminster against unjust fiscal exaction, by no means impossible. For\r\nthe rest, the Union was nominally not disturbed, and the Imperial\r\nParliament was nominally left intact; but it was declared that the Irish\r\nParliament was to possess the rights secured to it, unless these were\r\nannulled by an Act of the Imperial Parliament, to which the Irish had\r\ngiven its consent, or by an Act of the Imperial Parliament, in which\r\nrepresentatives from Ireland should have a voice.\r\n\r\nThe Bill was debated with great force of argument, but hardly in its high\r\nconstitutional aspects. Like the plan of Butt, and every plan of the kind,\r\nit impliedly, if not expressly, repealed the Union, for the very creation\r\nof an Irish Parliament destroyed the real authority of the Imperial\r\nParliament, the symbol and guarantee of the Union, in one of the main\r\nparts of the Three Kingdoms. It effected a radical change in our polity as\r\na whole, for practically it gave birth to three Parliaments, the Irish\r\nsitting in College Green in Dublin, the British at Westminster without\r\nIrish members, and the Imperial, properly to be only so-called, when\r\nassembled upon one great occasion; and, even more distinctly than the\r\nscheme of Butt, it let the principle of Federation into the constitution\r\nof the State. And it did all this obscurely, indirectly, and, so to speak,\r\nwith reserve; the hand of a veiled prophet appeared in his work; this must\r\nhave led to endless controversies dangerous in the extreme. Nor did the\r\nBill even attempt to mark out the distinction between Irish, British, and\r\nImperial affairs, which its author had declared was a _sine qua non_; this\r\ndistinction, in fact, cannot be drawn, as Mr. Gladstone acknowledged\r\nafterwards; Irish, British, and Imperial affairs so run into each other,\r\nthat they cannot be divided into separate heads, to be under the\r\njurisdiction of different Parliaments. The conditions, too, which Mr.\r\nGladstone described, as essential to a measure of Home Rule, were, in no\r\nsense, fulfilled. 'The Unity of the Empire,' that is, of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, as Mr. Gladstone no doubt had in his mind, was not secured, or,\r\neven in name, preserved; the subordinate Irish Parliament and its superior\r\nmight, and probably would, come in serious conflict; this was absolutely\r\ninconsistent with the unity to be maintained. The 'political equality of\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland' was not assured; the Bill placed Ireland\r\nin a degraded position, especially in all that dealt with taxation, and\r\nthrough the exclusion of Irish members from the British House of Commons.\r\nIt did not 'produce an equitable distribution of Imperial burdens,' for\r\nthe financial arrangements were thoroughly unjust, and subjected Ireland\r\narbitrarily to a most galling tribute, without giving her the means of\r\nmaking a complaint. It did not 'provide safeguards for the minority,' that\r\nis, for the loyal classes of Protestant and Catholic Ireland; it handed\r\nthem over to an Irish Parliament, certain to be for years an instrument of\r\ntheir avowed enemies; and its supplement, a Land Purchase Bill, did not\r\nfurnish a third part of the funds required to buy out the Irish landlords,\r\na class which, Mr. Gladstone declared, it was 'an obligation of duty and\r\nhonour' to save harmless, and which he admitted an Irish Parliament would,\r\nprobably, plunder and destroy. Lastly, the Bill did not secure 'finality;'\r\nit was in no sense in the nature of a 'permanent settlement,' as\r\nsubsequent events have conclusively proved.[24]\r\n\r\nIt may be urged, however, that even if this measure made a fundamental\r\nchange in the constitution of these realms, and did not satisfy the\r\nconditions its author laid down, still the real question was, would it\r\nbring peace to Ireland, and improve the relations in which she stood\r\ntowards Great Britain? Mr. Gladstone and his followers assumed that this\r\nwould be the case; the 'Union of Hearts' was to accomplish marvels; but\r\nthis assumption was without the slightest warrant. The most favourable way\r\nto consider the subject, from the point of view of the Home Rule party, is\r\nto suppose that Great Britain and Ireland were two communities, in no\r\nsense estranged from each other, and that Ireland was not a widely divided\r\npeople; and that both were not unwilling to accept the Bill, as a kind of\r\nmodification of the partnership made by the Treaty of Union. This\r\nsupposition would be obviously contrary to the facts; but, even on this\r\nsupposition, the proposed measure would have completely failed to attain\r\nits objects, and, on any ordinary view of human nature, would have\r\nexasperated Great Britain and Ireland alike, and could not have been a\r\n'message of peace' to Ireland. The Parliament at Westminster would soon\r\nhave found out that its real sovereignty in Ireland had been practically\r\ndestroyed; that the Irish Parliament could, in many ways, interfere with\r\nBritish and Imperial affairs; that most of the checks on its powers were\r\nof little avail; this would certainly deeply offend the deceived British\r\nnation. The Irish Parliament, on the other hand, would necessarily resent\r\nthe harsh limitations by which it had been bound; yet as it had most of\r\nthe powers of a real Parliament, it could very effectually evade or impair\r\nthese; could, through its Executive, largely annul them; could, at least,\r\nmake continual and powerful protests. Discord, and perhaps conflict,\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland, from the nature of the case, would be\r\nthe result; and, besides, there were special provisions in the Bill which\r\nwould be deemed intolerable by five-sixths of Irishmen. Even loyal Ireland\r\nwould not endure the banishment of Irish representatives from the British\r\nHouse of Commons, which would have power to impose the Irish Customs and\r\nExcise; this would be taxation without representation, in the very worst\r\nsense. It was monstrous that Ireland was to contribute a large sum for the\r\ncharge of the Empire and yet was to have no voice in the Empire's affairs;\r\nit was humiliating that a British official was to have absolute control\r\nover the whole Irish revenue. All this was subjecting Ireland to a\r\ndegrading tribute; it should be added that the prerogative of the English\r\nPrivy Council, to set aside practically Acts of the Irish Parliament,\r\nwould have provoked the deepest and most widespread discontent. The Bill,\r\nin a word, revealed strange ignorance of the feelings of mankind; it would\r\nhave worked on the assumption only that human beings in Great Britain and\r\nIreland were without passions and wills of their own; it would have been\r\nblown to the winds, when put to the test.\r\n\r\nBut 'the circumstances,' to adopt the words of Burke, 'are what render\r\nevery civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to mankind;'[25]\r\nwhat were the circumstances in the present instance? England and Catholic\r\nIreland had been long opposed; the Land and the National Leagues formed a\r\nconspiracy against our rule in Ireland; England had interests in Ireland\r\nof the first importance; she had a large community of her own blood and\r\nfaith in Ireland, attached to the Union and the old mother country.\r\nIreland had been distracted for ages by feuds of race and religion;\r\nProtestant and Catholic Ireland stood apart from each other; the Irish\r\nParliament, created by the Bill, would certainly be an instrument of the\r\nheads of the Catholic masses, supported by Parnell and his band, and by\r\nFenians across the Atlantic. Under these conditions, Home Rule would have\r\nbeen a fatal gift, ruinous to Great Britain and Ireland alike. Suppose,\r\nfor example, that an Irish Parliament, established in College Green, since\r\n1886, had ruled Ireland during the war in South Africa. It would\r\nunquestionably have taken the side of the Boers, as the Nationalist\r\nleaders have openly done; and it would have possessed the means of doing\r\ninfinite mischief. It could have passed resolutions condemning the war;\r\nhave called on Irishmen to keep aloof from the British army; have\r\ndiscouraged recruiting throughout Ireland; have sent messages of good will\r\nto the Boer Government. But probably it would have gone far beyond these,\r\nits constitutional, rights; it could have winked at the preparation of an\r\narmed force in Ireland to be despatched to the aid of the Boers; it\r\ncould have invited Foreign Powers to put a stop to the conflict; nay, it\r\ncould have laid hands on the Irish taxes, and refused to 'pay tribute to\r\nan alien Government;' and what, in these cases, would have been England's\r\nmeans of obtaining redress, save by the power of the sword? In the\r\ninstance of other wars, the same course would be followed; we cannot\r\nforget that at Nationalist meetings, the Mahdi, the Dervishes, nay, all\r\nour enemies, were the objects of the applause of shouting Irish\r\nmultitudes. And as the Irish Parliament could injure England in war, so it\r\ncould embarrass and annoy her, in a hundred ways, in peace. There was\r\nnothing in the Bill to prevent Protection in Ireland, for the Irish\r\nParliament could vote bounties on Irish exports; there was nothing to\r\nprevent the issue of Irish assignats, to mask confiscation of different\r\nkinds; and recourse would not improbably be had to these very expedients.\r\nIt is unnecessary to dwell on what would be the legislation of the Irish\r\nParliament at home, and the administration of the Executive it would have\r\na right to set up. Composed as it would be, it would abolish 'landlordism'\r\nby a stroke of the pen, or by merely preventing the recovery of rent; it\r\nwould simply turn society upside down, and establish a Catholic ascendency\r\nby many degrees worse than Protestant ascendency ever was; it would, in a\r\nword, let revolution loose in the island. Protestant Ireland would, as a\r\nmatter of course, resist; a savage war of race and creed would certainly\r\nfollow; the scenes of 1690 and 1798 might well be repeated; and the\r\nstruggle would end in general bankruptcy. England, in her own interest,\r\nand in that of her friends in Ireland, would assuredly intervene, under\r\nconditions like these; and the concession of Home Rule would probably lead\r\nto reconquest.\r\n\r\nThe Home Rule Bill of 1886--apart from the fatal evils it must have\r\ncaused--placed Ireland in such an inferior position, that every Irishman\r\nof spirit ought to have treated it with contempt; it was so dangerous to\r\nGreat Britain, and, indeed, to the Empire, that John Bright declared that\r\nnot twenty English members approved of it at heart. Mr. Gladstone himself,\r\nit should be remarked, regarded it with no doubtful misgivings; he\r\npresented it to the House of Commons as 'but a choice of evils;' his\r\nmeasure itself, in many passages, revealed the profoundest distrust of the\r\nParliament he proposed to create. Parnell, imposing his imperious will on\r\nhis followers, accepted the Bill with professions of delight; this was\r\neffusively welcomed by the emotional statesman, deceived by an\r\nunscrupulous plotter, over and over again; it is now known this was a mere\r\npretence; Home Rule, under the conditions of the scheme, would have been\r\nmade a stepping-stone only for larger demands; and this, indeed, might\r\nhave been easily foreseen. The Bill was rejected by a majority which did\r\nnot express the true sense of the House of Commons, and showed how strong\r\nmay be the ties of party; the great body of the Liberals, as, doubtless,\r\nthey now bitterly regret, threw in their lot with Mr. Gladstone in his\r\nmost reckless venture. It is of more importance to observe what the views\r\non the subject were of the conspirators in America, who had set the Land\r\nand National Leagues on foot, and had supplied almost the whole of their\r\nfunds; without their assistance the movement led by Parnell would probably\r\nhave never struggled into life. The prospect opened by the Home Rule Bill\r\nwas thus welcomed by the Clan na Gael, the most energetic and daring of\r\nthe Fenian parties; it will be noted that it was to be a means only to a\r\nvery decisive end. 'The achievement of a National Parliament gives us a\r\nfooting on Irish soil; it gives us the agencies and instrumentalities of a\r\ngovernment _de facto_, at the very commencement of the Irish struggle. It\r\nplaces the government of the land in the hands of our friends and\r\nbrothers. It removes the Castle's rings, and gives us what we may well\r\nexpress as the plant of an armed revolution.'[26] And at a great Fenian\r\nmeeting held after the rejection of the Bill, one of the leading speakers\r\ndropped these significant words: 'We have no desire to force the hand of\r\nParnell, or to drive the Irish people into war unprepared. All that we\r\ndemand is this, and we will be satisfied with nothing less--that no leader\r\nof the Irish people, who is supposed to speak for them, shall commit\r\nhimself, or them, to accepting as a final settlement, bills of relief\r\nunworthy of the dignity of Ireland's national demand. We are perfectly\r\nwilling to see them accept such bills as that of Gladstone, as a\r\nsettlement on account, but that must not be accepted as closing the\r\ntransaction. We see no wisdom in it. It lowers the tone of the national\r\ncause. It lowers the spirit of the true people. To ask them to subside to\r\na species of mere provincialism is an outrage on their struggle of seven\r\nhundred years for liberty. We admit that it may be good policy on the part\r\nof Mr. Parnell and Mr. Davitt to be what is called moderate in tone; but\r\nfor us, who represent the national idea of the Irish people, it would be\r\nworse than folly to conceal our sentiments. We recognise that Ireland is\r\nincapable of fighting at present.'[27]\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone dissolved Parliament when it had thrown the Bill out; he\r\nappears really to have believed that the nation would give its sanction to\r\nHome Rule. At the General Election of 1886, he exerted himself 'in the\r\nsacred cause of Ireland,' with the energy he had shown in his Midlothian\r\nCampaign; he associated his new Irish policy with appeals to the\r\nmultitude; the opposition to him was that 'of the classes against the\r\nmasses;' in a word, the enthusiastic, and perhaps sincere, convert played,\r\nwith little scruple, the part of a mere demagogue. But England pronounced\r\nagainst him, with no uncertain voice; 'men of education and property,' as\r\nhe sadly acknowledged, resisted him with the steadfastness of the English\r\nnature; a great majority was sent into the House of Commons pledged\r\nagainst Home Rule; Lord Salisbury's Government came again into office. It\r\ndeserves special notice that the rejection of the Bill did not, as was\r\npredicted would be the case, arouse anything like real discontent in\r\nIreland, or cause her Catholic community to stir; this spectacle, which\r\nhas been seen over and over again, proves how little the main body of the\r\nIrish people care for a political revolution of the kind; and how Home\r\nRule, as Parnell and his band conceived it, was the work of a conspiracy\r\nof foreign origin, seeking, through it, to subvert British rule in\r\nIreland. The real purpose of these men was very clearly shown at a\r\nConvention assembled at Chicago, in the summer of 1886; speeches of the\r\nmost incendiary nature were made; and two of Parnell's envoys, despatched\r\nto collect funds 'for the cause,' announced that, after the failure of Mr.\r\nGladstone's measure, their 'duty was to make the government of Ireland by\r\nEngland impossible.' Two or three years of trouble in Ireland followed; it\r\nis unnecessary to refer to these at any length. A season of agricultural\r\ndistress and of a fall in prices made the payment of Irish rents\r\ndifficult; the occasion was seized by the heads of the National League,\r\nwhich had gradually been acquiring formidable strength; the 'Plan of\r\nCampaign' was set afoot; and another attack was made on the Irish landed\r\ngentry, with the ultimate object of paralysing the Irish Government, as\r\nhad been solemnly proclaimed at Chicago. The social disorder of this\r\nperiod was not so deeply marked with horrible deeds of blood, as the\r\nSaturnalia of the Land League were; but the movement was, perhaps, not\r\nless dangerous; the cruel practice of 'boycotting' was reduced to a\r\nsystem, and caused widespread misery and distress; an agrarian war was\r\ncarried on in a few counties; judges, magistrates, and juries were\r\nterrorised in the administration of the law; and there were too numerous\r\ninstances of atrocious crimes. But a firm hand was at the helm of the\r\nIrish Government; Mr. Balfour did not palter with sedition and treason;\r\nthe conspiracy was before long put down; and it should be added that\r\n'boycotting' and 'the Plan of Campaign' were unequivocally condemned at\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nIn this struggle between the forces of disorder and law, the Rump of the\r\nLiberal party, which had accepted Home Rule, freely declared itself on the\r\nside of the National League and of anarchy. Mr. Gladstone, however,\r\ntowered over his fellows; his vehement and, when aroused, unscrupulous\r\nnature, has never been more unfortunately displayed. He had been three\r\ntimes at the head of the State, charged with the administration of Irish\r\naffairs; the Government in office was engaged in a conflict with a\r\nconspiracy of no contemptible strength; yet Mr. Gladstone did not shrink\r\nfrom throwing his full weight into the scale against it, and giving his\r\nsanction to the movement led by Parnell and his creatures. His conduct was\r\nso flagrantly at odds with his former self, that, but for the gravity of\r\nthe situation, it would have been ludicrous; it consisted in adoring what\r\nhe had burned, and burning what he had adored; nothing like it had been\r\nseen since Fox, breaking away from the traditions of British statesmen,\r\nflung himself into the arms of Jacobin France, and rejoiced at every\r\nreverse that befell England.[28] A remarkable episode in the politics of\r\nthe day was not without real effect on events that followed. The acts of\r\nthe Land and, in part, of the National Leagues, and of the leaders of the\r\nrevolutionary movements which had convulsed Ireland, were investigated by\r\nthe judges of the Special Commission appointed by Parliament for the\r\npurpose; the inquiry, which lasted many months, was of supreme importance;\r\nsuch a damning sentence was never pronounced on a body of public men, as\r\nthat pronounced on Parnell and his followers, though the accusation of\r\ntreason was not brought into question.[29] This decision was sufficient\r\nfor well-informed and sensible men; but Parnell was acquitted on a\r\npersonal, but minor, charge, that of having been the author of the\r\nwell-known forged letters all but approving of the assassinations in the\r\nPhoenix Park; Mr. Gladstone and his adherents welcomed him as an injured\r\nmartyr; the House of Commons rang with their plaudits when he re-entered\r\nits walls. For a few months Parnell became a popular personage in\r\ndemocratic England; he had negotiations with Mr. Gladstone with respect to\r\nHome Rule, the tenor of which has not transpired; his satellites appeared\r\nat many public meetings, and split the ears of the groundlings with\r\nplausible talk about 'self-government' for Ireland and the 'Union of\r\nHearts.' This mystification and falsehood were not without effect; the\r\ncause of Home Rule made a kind of progress in England; and, strange to\r\nsay, the fall of Parnell which ere long followed--I shall not dwell on its\r\nsqualid and grotesque incidents--had an influence in the same direction.\r\nIreland had been brought into a state of comparative repose; the power of\r\nthe National League appeared broken; the formidable leader of the\r\nconspiracy had left the stage; his adherents were scattered sheep, which\r\nhad not a shepherd. With the ignorance of Irish affairs so common to\r\nEnglishmen, and the desire, partly selfish, but partly generous, to 'get\r\nrid of the Irish difficulty,' by any tolerable means, thousands in the\r\nconstituencies, even in England, lately bitterly hostile to it, were\r\ngradually won over to the idea of Home Rule.\r\n\r\nThe General Election of 1892 followed; a number of causes, in addition to\r\nthat I have set forth, contributed to favour the Home Rule movement. The\r\n'swing of the pendulum,' seen in British politics, since Democracy has\r\ngained the ascendant, very distinctly appeared; the 'idea that each side\r\nought to have its innings' was widely spread; many Unionist seats were\r\nlost by these means. The extraordinary energy shown by Mr. Gladstone, at\r\nan age far beyond the ordinary span, had considerable influence on the\r\nmasses; and though his real authority had been long on the wane, he was\r\nstill the popular figure in England and, above all, in Scotland. He had,\r\nalso, carefully kept his Home Rule scheme to himself; it was announced by\r\nhis followers that his next measure for securing 'self-government,' as it\r\nwas called, for Ireland, would be free from the manifest faults of that of\r\n1886, and would finally, and happily, settle the question. A large part of\r\nthe electorate was gained in this way; but the influence that most\r\neffectually assisted Mr. Gladstone was, essentially, of a very different\r\nkind. The Anti-Unionist Liberals had been out of power for many years;\r\nthough they had long been split into separate groups, they resolved to\r\ncombine against the common enemy, and to drive the Unionist Government\r\nfrom its seat, by appeals to the ideas they assumed were dominant in\r\ndemocratic England and Scotland. The Newcastle programme was\r\nostentatiously published; the question of Home Rule was mixed up with\r\nprojects for disestablishing the Church in England and Wales, for the\r\ndestruction or the emasculation of the House of Lords, for enforcing\r\ntemperance by the tyranny of the Local Veto, for extending the suffrage\r\nand raising the labourer's status; in this way they satisfied themselves\r\nthey 'would sweep the country.' They knew, indeed, that Mr. Gladstone had\r\nno heart for much of their policy; but his passionate eagerness to\r\naccomplish Home Rule was notorious; they believed that by giving him a\r\ncordial support on this question, they would secure his powerful aid for\r\nthe others, and that by the process known as 'log-rolling,' they would\r\nattain their objects. The Unionist party was weakened at the election; but\r\nthe sanguine hopes of its opponents were not fulfilled. Many of the\r\nRadical cries were far from popular; they nearly all combined large\r\nclasses against them; England returned a large majority to the House of\r\nCommons pledged against Home Rule, if not so considerable as six years\r\nbefore; and though Scotland and Wales were, in the main, favourable to Mr.\r\nGladstone's policy, still the electorate of Great Britain, as a whole,\r\npronounced against it. The election in Ireland presented features which,\r\nwith respect to Home Rule, were of marked significance. In 1886, as in\r\n1885, the educated and upper classes were swamped at the polls, by the\r\nflood of illiterate and indigent multitudes; the Irish Catholic Church\r\nused, nay, abused, its immense authority, to secure votes for Mr.\r\nGladstone's coming measure. The same spectacle was beheld in 1892; but an\r\nelement of confusion and disorder came in; the leaders of the factions,\r\ndivided by the fall of Parnell, though Nationalists, ferociously flew at\r\neach other's throats; the election was marked by disgraceful scenes of\r\nlawlessness. These certainly prefigured what would be the character of a\r\nfuture Irish Parliament sitting in College Green.\r\n\r\nThis election gave Mr. Gladstone a majority of some forty seats in the\r\nHouse of Commons, but a majority composed of not well-united elements; and\r\nthe best opinion of England was strongly averse to his policy. But the\r\nveteran statesman--he was in his eighty-third year--did not pause for a\r\nmoment in his headlong venture, though ominous sounds were being already\r\nheard; after the resignation of Lord Salisbury, through a weak adverse\r\nvote, his rival became Prime Minister for the fourth time. He had staked\r\neverything to obtain the success of the cause to which he had passionately\r\ndevoted his declining years; he brought in his second Home Rule Bill in\r\nthe first months of 1893. The measure had much in common with that of\r\n1886; but in some respects it was very different, especially in one\r\nfeature of supreme importance. An Irish Parliament was again to be set up\r\nin Dublin; but it was to be a much smaller body than that proposed by the\r\nprevious Bill; it was to be composed of a Legislative Council of\r\nforty-eight members only, and of a Legislative Assembly of only a hundred\r\nand three; these were analogous to the First and Second Orders of 1886,\r\nbut were not to be even half in numbers; and no Irish peers were to have a\r\nplace in the new Parliament. The Legislative Council and Assembly,\r\ndiffering here from the original scheme, were to sit, not together, but\r\napart; but the Legislative Council, like the First Order, was to have a\r\ntemporary suspensive veto on the Assembly's acts; the Assembly, too, like\r\nthe Second Order, possessing a majority which would place real power in\r\nits hands; and both bodies, it should be added, being more democratic than\r\nthe two which were to have been created in 1886. The new Irish Parliament,\r\nlike that to be formed seven years before, was restricted by\r\nlimitations--these much the same as those contained in the former Bill--in\r\na number of Imperial and domestic matters; it was, like its predecessor,\r\nto be subjected to the same kind of veto, and to nearly the same authority\r\nof the English Privy Council. In finance, the 'tribute,' which had been\r\nloudly condemned by all parties in Ireland, was given up; there was to be\r\nno British official to lay his hands on Irish revenue, and to divert it\r\nfrom its legitimate uses; but the Irish Customs were to be appropriated to\r\nthe Imperial charge, which Ireland was declared to be justly liable to\r\npay; and this was a sum of about two millions and a half, with an addition\r\nfor a time of one million, a sum less than the estimate made in 1886. The\r\nIrish Parliament, however, if thus made largely subordinate, was like the\r\nParliament of the preceding Bill, to be in many, and most important,\r\nrespects supreme. It was to rule Ireland as a sovereign power, subject to\r\nthe limitations by which it was to be bound; it could make, change, and\r\nrepeal laws, as regards the Irish community, almost as it pleased; it\r\ncould, in a word, do nearly everything within the province of a real\r\nParliament. Above all, it could appoint and control the Irish Executive\r\nGovernment, to which the administration of Irish affairs would belong; and\r\nit would thus have complete power over the most important machinery of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe Bills of 1886 and of 1893 so far resembled each other, with some\r\ndistinctions; but, in other respects, they markedly differed. The\r\nsupremacy of the Imperial Parliament, implied but not expressed in the\r\nfirst scheme, was unequivocally asserted in the second, though this\r\nsupremacy could not be effective, as respects Ireland. The Imperial\r\nParliament was nominally left untouched by both Bills, though this was a\r\nplay on words only; but it was to hold a position in the second it was not\r\nto hold in the first; the Union was not in terms repealed by either\r\nmeasure, though virtually it was repealed by both, through the mere\r\ncreation of an Irish Parliament. The Bill of 1886 had, as its complement,\r\na Land Purchase Bill; in fact, both were made parts of the same policy; a\r\nsum of L50,000,000 was to be an indemnity for Irish landlords who should\r\nthink fit to part with their estates; for Mr. Gladstone, we have seen, had\r\ndeclared that it was 'an obligation of duty and honour' to protect this\r\norder of men; and he asserted that Parliament would, doubtless, vote any\r\nfurther sums required, a singular exhibition of credulous hope, for these\r\nwould have amounted to L150,000,000 at least; and he had himself, in a\r\nspeech addressed to Lord George Hamilton, valued the lands of Ireland at\r\nL300,000,000. But what was to be deemed sacred, in 1886, had a very\r\ndifferent aspect in 1893; the settlement of the Irish land was, indeed,\r\nwithheld for three years from the Irish Parliament, but, after this brief\r\nspace of time, this was to be certainly left to a body, which Mr.\r\nGladstone had evidently thought would make short work of the Irish landed\r\ngentry, and would drive them, in beggary, out of their own country. These\r\ndifferences, however, between the two Bills, sank into insignificance\r\ncompared to a vital distinction which made them essentially unlike each\r\nother, and made their projects of Home Rule completely dissimilar. The\r\nexclusion of Irish representatives from the House of Commons at\r\nWestminster, under the measure of 1886, was palpably unjust, and had been\r\ncondemned with much force of argument. Mr. Gladstone proposed to redress\r\nthis wrong by summoning eighty Irish members into the Imperial House of\r\nCommons; these were to have no cognisance of British questions, but were\r\nto have a right to vote on Imperial and even Irish questions, though the\r\nImperial Parliament was to have little or no power in Ireland, and an\r\nIrish Parliament was practically to fill its place, and to have all but\r\nsupreme authority over Irish affairs. This strange expedient obviously\r\nmade the Home Rule schemes of 1886 and 1893 altogether different; but Mr.\r\nGladstone never saw the essential distinction; he maintained that the\r\ninclusion of the Irish members was little more than a detail of the\r\nmeasure. It would be perhaps unfair to insist that he introduced this\r\nimmense change in order only to strengthen his already enfeebled party,\r\nwhich would be greatly in want of Irish votes at Westminster; more\r\nprobably his intellect, yielding to old age, did not thoroughly grasp all\r\nthat was involved in his project.[30]\r\n\r\nThe Bill of 1893, from a purely constitutional point of view, was\r\ninfinitely more objectionable than that of 1886. It not only, I have said,\r\nvirtually repealed the Union; it created a kind of Federalism in these\r\nrealms to which there has never been a parallel. The Irish Parliament was\r\npractically to rule Ireland; no British members were to show their faces\r\nin it; it was to be all but the sovereign of the Irish State. The British\r\nParliament was nominally to be sovereign of the British State;\r\nrepresentatives from Ireland were not to appear in it, and, in theory,\r\nthey were not to deal with British questions. The Imperial Parliament was\r\nto be analogous to a supreme Federal Council; this ought to have\r\njurisdiction over Imperial affairs alone; but eighty Irish members were to\r\nhave seats in it, and they were to have a right to vote on Imperial and\r\nIrish questions, though Ireland was to have a separate Parliament of her\r\nown. This arrangement, in conception, was simply monstrous; it gave\r\nIreland powers to which she had no pretence to a claim; it really\r\nsubjected Great Britain to her; it formed a Federation in which a weak and\r\nsmall State was to have immense authority over another tenfold as strong;\r\nit might be described as one-sided Federalism run mad. Passing from the\r\nmain principles to the details of the Bill, this, like its predecessor,\r\ndid not satisfy the conditions Mr. Gladstone had deemed to be essential.\r\nIt did not separate British, Irish, and Imperial affairs; its author\r\nadmitted at last that this was not possible. It asserted the supremacy of\r\nthe Imperial Parliament, and gave it a more imposing position than it had\r\nunder the Bill of 1886; but it did not maintain the Unity of the Three\r\nKingdoms; the mere creation of an Irish Parliament placed this in\r\njeopardy. It did not provide for the 'political equality' of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland, for, in contradiction to the measure of seven years before,\r\nit practically gave Ireland a kind of ascendency; her representatives were\r\nto possess rights in no sense to be justified. It did not provide an\r\n'equitable distribution of Imperial burdens;' in this province it would\r\nhave done wrong to Great Britain; for, while it abandoned the odious Irish\r\ntribute of 1886, and an effective control over Irish revenue, its\r\nexpedient of allocating the Irish Customs, and nothing else, as the only\r\nsource for the payment of Imperial charges, would, in all probability,\r\nhave caused the Imperial Treasury a great loss; the Customs would have\r\nbeen enormously reduced by smuggling, to which Irishmen have always been\r\nmuch addicted, which the Irish Parliament would have no interest to\r\nprevent, and which, very likely, it would directly encourage. Again, it\r\ndid not create 'safeguards for the minority;' as we have seen, it threw\r\nthe Irish landed gentry, after a brief respite, to the wolves, that is, to\r\nthe tender mercies of the Irish Parliament; and, like the measure of 1886,\r\nit took no heed of Protestant and loyal Catholic Ireland, as a whole,\r\nthough this assuredly was 'a minority' that required protection. Finally,\r\nit could not have effected a 'permanent settlement' of the affairs of\r\nIreland; a 'lopsided' and iniquitous arrangement like this would certainly\r\nhave had a very short existence.\r\n\r\nThe measure of 1893, in short, would have effected a complete revolution\r\nin the polity of these realms; it would have given the least important of\r\nthe Three Kingdoms an iniquitous authority over the most important; it\r\nwould unnaturally have placed weakness in superiority to power; it would\r\nhave subjected the dominant to the lesser partner; all this, it will be\r\nobserved, followed from the inclusion of Irish representatives in the\r\nImperial Parliament, who, though a Parliament in Dublin was to rule\r\nIreland, were to have a right to deal with Imperial and Irish questions.\r\nMr. Gladstone, I repeat, seems never to have understood the strange and\r\nruinous consequences this would involve; but this can be made manifest by\r\none or two examples. The Irish members would be excluded from the British\r\nParliament, and would have no right to vote on purely British questions,\r\nsay upon the extension of the British railway system, or the\r\ndisfranchisement of an English or Scottish borough. But they would have\r\neighty seats in the Imperial Parliament; and as it was impossible to\r\nseparate a number of British questions from those of an Imperial or Irish\r\ncharacter, they would have a most potent influence over British affairs;\r\nfor example, they could legitimately vote upon such subjects as the\r\nconfidence to be placed in a British Ministry, the financial relations\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland, or the validity of British incumbrances\r\naffecting Irish estates. The exclusion, however, of Irish members from the\r\nBritish Parliament, and their introduction into the Imperial Parliament,\r\nwould have led to even more disastrous results; it must, in many\r\ninstances, have caused a complete paralysis of the State. This in-and-out\r\nplan, as it was derisively called, must have made Parliamentary government\r\nwell-nigh impossible; if Irish members were to have a right to vote in the\r\nsame House of Commons on Imperial and Irish questions, but were not to\r\nhave a right to vote on British questions, to vote, say, upon a war with a\r\nForeign Power, and upon the domicile and status of Irish subjects, but not\r\nto vote on matters of purely British commerce, there might, and very often\r\nwould be, two conflicting majorities in the leading House of Parliament;\r\nParliamentary affairs would be brought to a stand; the tenure of even the\r\nstrongest Ministry would be utterly insecure. It is needless to point out\r\nthat the relations between Great Britain and Ireland would almost\r\ncertainly have been more strained, under the Bill of 1893, than they would\r\nhave been under that of 1886; and that the government of Ireland by the\r\nIrish Parliament, would, under both, have been much of the same character.\r\nThe British nation would have been indignant at the humiliation of their\r\nancient Parliament, which would be sometimes placed at the mercy of Irish\r\nmembers; it would have condemned the weakening in Ireland of its\r\nauthority, through the mere establishment of an Irish Parliament; it would\r\nhave been sorely vexed that Irish smuggling would filch away a large part\r\nof British revenue. It should be borne in mind, too, that the Irish\r\nmembers, who would have been let into the Imperial Parliament, would have\r\nbeen more difficult to deal with, by many degrees, more openly disloyal,\r\nmore obstructive, than Irish Nationalists could be, as affairs stand at\r\npresent; they would have the support of the Irish Parliament; the Imperial\r\nParliament could hardly impose a check on them. As for the rule of the\r\nIrish Parliament, within its proper domain, it would have been the same,\r\nor much the same, under either measure; that is, it would have been a\r\nsuccession of angry wranglings with England and oppression in Ireland,\r\nleading to anarchy and general ruin.\r\n\r\nThe Home Rule Bill of 1886, in a word, bad measure as it was, was\r\ninnoxious compared to the Home Rule Bill of 1893. The fatal tendency of\r\nthe scheme was quickly perceived; the sound mind of England was profoundly\r\nstirred; the Bill was publicly burned in the City of London; innumerable\r\npetitions against it flowed in; an immense assembly, representing loyal\r\nCatholic and Protestant Ireland, met in the capital, and denounced this\r\nwhole policy in most determined language. As had happened, too, seven\r\nyears before, the Press of Great Britain, all but universally, condemned\r\nthe new measure as hopelessly bad; it was significant that the Liberal\r\nPress was well-nigh silent, and that Mr. Gladstone was supported by very\r\nfew petitions. The Opposition simply tore the Bill to shreds in the House\r\nof Commons; but the self-deluded Minister desperately held his course; the\r\nRadical groups servilely gave him their votes; the process of\r\n'log-rolling,' never before so recklessly displayed, kept his petty\r\nmajority almost intact, a crying disgrace to any party in the State. At\r\nlast, whether afraid of the country rising against him or yielding to the\r\ninstigation of his Irish allies--his subserviency to their truculence had\r\nbeen most painful--Mr. Gladstone forced the measure through the House of\r\nCommons by a method never employed before; 'closure by compartments,'\r\nrightly compared to the 'guillotine,' put an end to resistance by\r\niniquitous means. The Bill passed the Lower House by thirty-four votes\r\nonly; not half of it had been examined or discussed; the part that had,\r\nhad been so completely transformed, that its parent could hardly have\r\nknown his own offspring. The most notable of these changes was that the\r\nin-and-out plan was given up; its ruinous effects had been fully dragged\r\ninto the light, but an arrangement, perhaps even worse, had been placed in\r\nits stead. Ireland was to retain her Parliament in College Green; but the\r\neighty Irish members were to have a right to sit in the Imperial\r\nParliament, and to vote on all questions, not only Imperial and Irish, but\r\nstrictly British alike. A philosophic and calm-minded writer has indicated\r\nwhat this would involve: 'Irish members may disestablish the Church of\r\nEngland, though England is to have no voice in the pettiest of Irish\r\naffairs. Irish members are to be allowed to impose taxes on England, say,\r\nto double the income tax, though of these taxes no inhabitant of Ireland\r\nwill pay a penny; the Irish delegation, and this is the worst grievance of\r\nall, is to be enabled, in combination with a British minority, to detach\r\nWales from England, or to vote Home Rule for Scotland, or to federalise\r\nstill further the United Kingdom by voting that Man, Jersey, and Guernsey\r\nshall send members to the Imperial Parliament.'[31] To say that this\r\nproposal would be unconstitutional would be to do it too much honour; it\r\nwas scandalous in the existing situation of affairs; it implied that heads\r\nof the National League, leaders of a rebellious and socialistic movement,\r\nwould have the power, without restriction or check, to rule the Imperial\r\nParliament, in many instances, with reference to exclusively English and\r\nScottish questions; it practically bound Great Britain hand and foot in\r\nfetters to Ireland; it was rightly called 'an absurd piece of infamy.' It\r\nis unnecessary to say that the system it would have established could not\r\nhave stood a trial of even three months; England, whenever crossed, would\r\nhave indignantly swept it away. But Nemesis had commended the poisoned\r\nchalice to Mr. Gladstone's lips; the project, on which he had staked his\r\nfortunes, was that which he had incorrectly ascribed to Butt, and had\r\ndeclared to be impossible and worse.\r\n\r\nThe Bill, it was notorious, could not have passed the House of Commons had\r\nnot its rejection by the House of Lords been assured beforehand. It\r\nreceived its quietus, in that assembly, by a majority of about ten to one;\r\nthe mind of England felt unquestionable relief; a great national peril had\r\nbeen averted. Exactly as had happened in 1886, scarcely a sound of\r\ndiscontent was heard in Ireland; the demand for Home Rule, in fact, is\r\nlargely a fictitious cry, with which the great body of Irishmen has little\r\nor no sympathy; the evidence of this can be no longer doubtful. Mr.\r\nGladstone retired, within a few months, from public life; one of his last\r\nacts was to shoot a Parthian arrow at the House of Lords, which, happily\r\nfor these realms, had wrecked his policy; since that time he has\r\ndisappeared from the scene; few eminent statesmen have been so soon\r\nforgotten. Home Rule was scattered to the winds at the General Election of\r\n1895; it has not been a prominent question at that of 1900; but if Ireland\r\nhas sent more than eighty of its supporters into the House of Commons, the\r\nbest elements in her community remain angrily hostile; and the opinion of\r\nGreat Britain is distinctly adverse. For many reasons, however, as I have\r\nremarked, it is impossible to ignore the subject; in the strange chances\r\nand changes of British politics, and under our system of party government,\r\na minister may again become an advocate of Home Rule, though certainly\r\nnot in the present Parliament. Mr. Gladstone's Bills, it is likely, will\r\nnot be heard of again; but Home Rule may be embodied in other forms; I may\r\nbriefly refer to, and comment, on these. The project of restoring the\r\nParliament of 1782-1800, an ideal of O'Connell during many years of his\r\nlife, will hardly be revived in these times; the conditions in Great\r\nBritain and Ireland have so completely changed. The centripetal forces\r\nwhich, a hundred years ago, held the British and Irish Parliaments, in the\r\nmain, together--they differed, however, on important questions--have long\r\nago been all but completely destroyed; the present Irish Parliament could\r\nnot be an assembly identified in race and faith with England; its House of\r\nCommons could not be elected by a small body of Protestants, and latterly\r\nby masses of Catholic peasants, the serfs of their landlords. The\r\ncentrifugal forces, on the other hand, those which would keep the two\r\nParliaments utterly apart, would probably be overwhelmingly strong; the\r\nIrish House of Commons would practically, at least for years, be ruled by\r\nthe nominees of the National League and of the Irish Catholic priesthood;\r\nits electorate would, for the most part, be subject to these dominant\r\npowers; and Protestant Ireland would alike be swamped and incensed.\r\nNevertheless, the restoration of what has been called Grattan's\r\nParliament, would, in my judgment, be a much better project than either of\r\nMr. Gladstone's schemes of Home Rule. The Irish Parliament would be bound\r\nby known and fixed precedents, which it would be difficult wholly to\r\ndisregard; an Irish House of Lords would exist as a check on the House of\r\nCommons; above all--and this is of the very first importance--the Irish\r\nExecutive would not be subject to the Irish Parliament; it would be\r\nappointed from Westminster by British statesmen. A Parliament of this type\r\ncould hardly effect the ruinous mischiefs which Mr. Gladstone's Irish\r\nParliaments could certainly effect.\r\n\r\nIreland, it has been urged, would obtain Home Rule, if she were\r\nassimilated to one of our self-governing colonies. These nations, as they\r\nmay fitly be called, are by no means, as is commonly supposed, wholly\r\nindependent of the Crown and the Imperial Parliament; they have\r\nParliaments and Executives of their own; but these in theory, and partly\r\nin fact, are subordinate. No Act passed by the Parliament of a\r\nself-governing colony can in any way contravene an Imperial statute; the\r\ngovernor of a self-governing colony is a real governor; appeals run to the\r\nEnglish Privy Council from colonial Courts of Justice. Nevertheless,\r\nself-governing colonies are practically all but independent; they pay no\r\ncontribution to Imperial charges; they maintain their own garrisons,\r\nwithout a British army in their midst--at least, in a great many cases;\r\nthey are hardly ever interfered with by the Imperial Parliament, or by the\r\nmen in power at Westminster. Why, it may be argued, should not the same\r\nliberties belong to Ireland, for centuries the peccant part of these\r\nkingdoms; would not the concession make her as loyal as most of our\r\nself-governing colonies? The answer is short, but amply sufficient; the\r\ncircumstances of our self-governing colonies and of Ireland are altogether\r\ndifferent. In none of these settlements is there the profound estrangement\r\nwhich has long divided Great Britain from Ireland; in none is there a\r\ncommunity in which a loyal minority is separated from a disaffected\r\nmajority by long-standing discords of race and faith; Ireland is at our\r\ndoors, our self-governing colonies distant. Give Ireland a Parliament like\r\nthat of Victoria, and Ireland would break off from the British connection;\r\nthe Irish Parliament would possess ample power to trample on and oppress\r\nhundreds of thousands of law-abiding men, of whom the protection was\r\nEngland's duty; the Irish Parliament and Executive, within a few leagues\r\nof our coasts, could, in innumerable ways, do infinite mischief. The\r\nsupposed analogy, therefore, completely fails; it would be treason to the\r\nState, and to loyal Irishmen, to make Ireland a self-governing colony; and\r\nno British politician has as yet countenanced this mode of Home Rule. It\r\nhas been hinted again, but with bated breath and humbleness, that the\r\nrelations of Great Britain and Ireland have been so long unfortunate, such\r\na dreary record of disputes and miseries, that we should say to our\r\nintractable partner, 'Depart in peace;' in a word, separation is a\r\nconceivable Home Rule policy. This proposal has never been discussed in\r\nParliament; the interest, the self-respect, the pride of Englishmen almost\r\nforbid the thought. Yet separation, strange as it may appear, would be a\r\nbetter and more safe expedient than either of Mr. Gladstone's schemes of\r\nHome Rule. The Imperial Parliament would have complete liberty to exercise\r\nits sovereign power in Great Britain; it would have a free hand to prevent\r\ninjustice in Ireland, either by the strong arm, or by fiscal and other\r\nexpedients, say, by laying an embargo on Irish products; it would not be\r\nsubject to the exasperating but often effective checks which Home Rule\r\nwould in any form involve; and the Imperial Executive would possess ample\r\nmeans to protect the interests of England and of her friends in Ireland.\r\nLet it not be forgotten that in perhaps the ablest speech ever made, in\r\nthe House of Commons, on this subject, Peel declared that he would\r\ninfinitely prefer separation to a repeal of the Union, by no means so evil\r\na policy as Home Rule.\r\n\r\nA few politicians, however, have put the theory forward that 'Home Rule\r\nall round' will meet the 'national demand' of Ireland, and give her what\r\nthey are pleased to call 'self-government.' England, Scotland, Ireland,\r\nand perhaps Wales are to have local Parliaments to deal with their own\r\naffairs; Imperial affairs are to be directed by an Imperial Council. I am\r\nwilling to admit that a scheme of this kind would be better than Mr.\r\nGladstone's Home Rule Bill of 1893; it would be less illogical, possibly\r\nnot more disastrous. But I must be permitted to doubt whether these sages\r\nunderstand what their project certainly involves; this, indeed, seems to\r\nbe rather in the nature of a device to angle for Nationalist votes,\r\nwithout scruple, and then to propose a plan which England, Scotland,\r\nIreland, and Wales have never asked for, and which England and Scotland,\r\nat least, would indignantly reject. This scheme is pure Federalism, in the\r\nproper sense of the word; let us briefly consider what this means from the\r\nvery nature of the case. England, Scotland, Ireland, and, I assume, Wales\r\nwould form separate States; they would have separate Legislatures and\r\nExecutives to manage their local affairs, separate local forces, separate\r\nCourts of Justice; they would be, essentially, separate countries. The\r\nImperial Parliament and its Executive would be the only link between them;\r\nthere would be an Imperial army, and navy, and Imperial tribunals; but the\r\nImperial Parliament and its Executive would only have jurisdiction over\r\nImperial affairs, and would be only the head of the separate States as\r\nrespects Foreign Powers. But as it would be difficult in the extreme,\r\nunder these conditions, to distinguish local from Imperial affairs, an\r\narbiter of some kind, armed with sufficient powers, would be necessary to\r\nsay what affairs were local and what Imperial, and decisively to pronounce\r\non the subject, on the innumerable occasions when the question would\r\narise; and it would be necessary, too, that there should be some means,\r\nperhaps a Referendum to a popular vote, to effect any constitutional\r\nchange, to reform or to abolish the Constitution itself. This scheme\r\nobviously would be complex, intricate, and difficult to carry into effect;\r\nit would be a huge system of divided, and probably conflicting, powers,\r\nnot easy to reconcile with each other; for this, and other reasons, it\r\nwould require a formal Constitution reduced to writing, and setting forth,\r\nunder distinct heads or articles, the conditions of the Federation that\r\nhad been established, the spheres of the authority of the separate\r\nStates, and the sphere of the authority of the Imperial Council. Is it\r\npossible to suppose that the Parliament of the United Kingdom would ever\r\nbreak up this ancient and undivided Monarchy; would tamely surrender its\r\nsovereign rights, and would substitute a new-fangled fabric of this kind\r\nfor the venerable and unwritten constitution of these realms--a majestic\r\ntemple that has grown up in silence; and that the British people, at all\r\nevents, would not rise up in wrath at the very thought of such a change?\r\nFor Federalism 'amounts to a proposal for changing the whole constitution\r\nof the United Kingdom. It is, in fact, the most \"revolutionary\" proposal,\r\nif the word \"revolutionary\" be used in its strict sense, which has ever\r\nbeen submitted to an English Parliament. The abolition of the House of\r\nLords, the disestablishment of the Church, the abolition of the Monarchy,\r\nmight leave the English Constitution far less essentially changed than\r\nwould the adoption of Federalism.'[32]\r\n\r\nIt should be observed, too, with respect to this subject, that the\r\nconditions, under which Federalism would have a chance of success, would\r\nbe absolutely wanting in the present instance. England, Scotland, Ireland,\r\nand Wales have long been moulded into a single sovereign State, and united\r\nunder a supreme Monarchy; no Federation, I venture to assert, has been\r\nformed out of communities that have had a government of this kind.\r\nFederations, in fact, have almost always grown out of an association of\r\nexisting States, which desire to remain separate, and yet to be a nation\r\nfor some purposes; they have not been evolved out of the fragments of one\r\nState artificially rent asunder. Again, Federalism requires that no single\r\nState should be enormously more powerful than the other partners; there\r\nmust be something like equality between the different States;[33] it is\r\nunnecessary to remark that England has tenfold the resources and strength\r\nof Scotland, Ireland, and Wales; and, in truth, would annihilate the\r\nFederation were her will really crossed, and break through the arbitrary\r\nlimitations imposed on her. Suppose, for example, that England had set her\r\nheart on a great foreign war, and had the support of her own Parliament;\r\ndoes any one suppose that, if she were outvoted, by deputies from\r\nScotland, Ireland, and Wales, in the Imperial Council, even though backed\r\nby their own Parliaments, the people of England would submit to be\r\nthwarted in this way; was Samson bound by the withs of the Philistines?\r\nSomething like this, indeed, was seen in the great Civil War; the result\r\nwas the subjugation of Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, and the complete\r\nascendency of England, under Cromwell; an attempt to federalise the Three\r\nKingdoms might lead to a similar issue. Let us assume, however, that,\r\nthrough some evil stroke of destiny, Federalism were made the constitution\r\nof these realms, and that this strange arrangement could be made to work\r\neven for a few years; the inevitable consequences, from the nature of the\r\ncase, would follow. The omnipotence of the Imperial Parliament, the\r\nmainstay of the Empire, would be gone; so would the omnipotence of the\r\nImperial Executive Government, the best security for justice and for equal\r\nliberties. Their powers would be parcelled out and subdivided; they would\r\nnot survive anywhere in their complete fulness; they would be distributed\r\nin fractions between separate States, and would be transformed and\r\nimpaired in the process; real Imperial unity and sovereignty could have no\r\nexistence. General national weakness would be the probable result,\r\nleading, perhaps, to despotism within a short time; for Federalism is\r\nessentially weak; I have no sympathy with Jacobin France, but the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety rightly put Federalism down, when they were\r\nengaged in their death-struggle with Europe; and Napoleon--perhaps the\r\nablest ruler of the nineteenth century--approved of their conduct. But\r\nweakness would not be the only consequence; the dissemination of different\r\npowers would certainly produce disputes and conflicts between the Federal\r\nand the State authorities; above all, the very existence of separate\r\nStates and of a Federal Government would divide allegiance, and powerfully\r\ntend to disruption, as was seen in the great Civil War in America. As\r\nregards Ireland, the establishment of 'Home Rule all round' would\r\nnecessarily be attended by all the evils inseparable from Mr. Gladstone's\r\nschemes; but Federalism, having been thus made manifest, would probably\r\nincrease, and in some sense justify, the alienation of Ireland from the\r\nother parts of these kingdoms.\r\n\r\nHome Rule, therefore, whatever the form it may assume, would be, it is my\r\nfirm conviction, incompatible with the welfare of the Three Kingdoms,\r\ninjurious to Great Britain, a curse to Ireland. In the peculiar\r\ncircumstances which exist in Ireland, and to which I have adverted before,\r\nseparation, I believe, would be an expedient less disastrous than Home\r\nRule of any description, this involving the creation of an Irish\r\nParliament, and of an Irish Executive, which would be its instrument. Home\r\nRule, in fact, gloss it over as you please, has been forced to the front\r\nby an Irish faction, hostile to a man to the existence of British rule in\r\nIreland, and depending on Fenianism in the United States; this party would\r\nbe all-powerful in an Irish Parliament; and Home Rule would be made the\r\nmeans to a ruinous and disgraceful end. Thousands of Irishmen, indeed,\r\nhonestly think Home Rule would do their country good, and have little or\r\nnothing to do with this bad conspiracy; this too, doubtless, is the case\r\nwith the followers of Mr. Gladstone; but Home Rule is an Irish Nationalist\r\nmovement, and Irish Nationalist movements are dangerous to the safety of\r\nthe State. The Union, therefore, must be maintained in the interest of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland alike; and the Union is an international\r\nsettlement that has endured for a century. But no candid student of Irish\r\nhistory, no impartial observer of Irish affairs, from 1800 to the present\r\ntime, can deny that the Union has been in many respects a failure. It has\r\nbeen an incident, perhaps a result, of the Union, that Presbyterian\r\nIreland, rebellious from 1795 to 1798, has, we have seen, become attached\r\nto the British connection, and is now devotedly attached to England. The\r\npower of the Imperial Parliament and of its Executive have kept\r\nlawlessness and disorder down in Ireland, and has restrained the evil\r\npassions of Irish factions more than was ever the case under the rule of\r\nthe Irish Parliament. The Imperial Parliament, too, has accomplished\r\nreforms in Ireland, if often unwise, in the main beneficent; and, under\r\nthe Imperial Executive, justice in Ireland has been administered, for many\r\nyears, in a very different way from that which was seen a century ago; its\r\ntribunals are perfectly free and impartial. But the Union was, in itself,\r\na bad half measure, tainted with iniquity and false promises; it did gross\r\nwrong to Catholic Ireland; the evil consequences are felt to this hour.\r\nThe Union has not fulfilled the sanguine hopes of Pitt; Ireland, as I have\r\npointed out, is far more behind Great Britain in wealth than she was sixty\r\nyears ago; she is perhaps the poorest country in Europe at the door of the\r\nrichest. The Union, too, has not reconciled the feuds of religion and race\r\nin Ireland; they are as marked as they were a century ago, if not attended\r\nwith such deeds of violence; above all, the Union has not made the chief\r\npart of the Irish community attached to England, as Pitt confidently\r\npredicted would certainly happen. Nor can it be denied that the Irish\r\nreforms of the Imperial Parliament have too often been ill-designed and\r\nfaulty, especially, as we shall see, as regards the land; and they have\r\nunfortunately, in many instances, been concessions to agitation and\r\ndangerous social movements, and have been effected too late to do real\r\ngood. The administration of Ireland reveals the same defects; it has been\r\nmarked by good intentions, which, sometimes, have proved gross mistakes;\r\nand notably it has, over and over again, been shifty, vacillating, without\r\nprinciple, and showing a curious disregard of sound Irish opinion.\r\nUnquestionably, too, Ireland has, on many occasions, to the indignation of\r\ntrue-hearted Irishmen, been made the mere plaything of British faction,\r\nwith the worst results to her best interests; this has been perhaps the\r\nmost pernicious incident that has followed the Union; and in the immense\r\nrevolution which has transformed Ireland, within the last hundred years,\r\nthe effects that may be traced to the Union have by no means been wholly\r\non the side of good.\r\n\r\nThese evil consequences cannot be really questioned; it is very advisable\r\nto consider their causes, and if possible to see how they can be removed\r\nor lessened. They are partly to be ascribed to the fact that Great Britain\r\nand Ireland are countries differing from each other in most important\r\nrespects, and standing, so to speak, on different planes of existence;\r\nthis alone makes British rule in Ireland difficult, and perplexes and\r\nembarrasses British statesmen. They are partly due to defects in the\r\nEnglish national character, essentially just in intention, and even\r\ngenerous, but with no sympathy with races of a character unlike its own,\r\nself-asserting, obstinate, sometimes rude and offensive; this has had\r\nmarked and evil effects in the affairs of Ireland. They are largely to be\r\nattributed to the nature of Irish administration, seldom consistent, and\r\nchanging with party changes: British statesmen appear at the Castle; rule\r\nfor a few years; and then depart and give place to successors, who\r\nprobably carry out a very different policy. They are largely due to the\r\nnature of the representation of Ireland, notably of late years; the\r\nNationalist party--and the same remark applies, in some degree, to the\r\n'Tail' of O'Connell--have shown such an aversion to England, have used\r\nsuch seditious and even criminal language, have been so extravagant and\r\nwild in their demands, and have been such a dangerous element in the House\r\nof Commons, that Englishmen and Scotchmen turn away from Irish questions\r\nwith disgust, and Ireland unfortunately has often been the sufferer. But\r\nthe most important of these causes, one which may be traced throughout\r\nIrish history, and has been scarcely less evident since the Union, has\r\nbeen the strange but signal ignorance of Irish affairs--of all, in a word,\r\nthat relates to Ireland--which has been but too characteristic of the\r\nBritish people, and, in a lesser degree, of many British statesmen. This\r\ncapital fault aroused the _saeva indignatio_, of Swift; it was exposed by\r\nGrattan, O'Connell, even by Lord Clare; it was condemned in severe but\r\nthoughtful language by Burke; it has been conspicuous during the events of\r\nthe last twenty years.[34] The resulting mischiefs have been numerous and\r\ngrave in the extreme; can nothing be done to mitigate these and to make\r\nthem less, consistently with maintaining the Union in its full\r\ncompleteness? I, for one, have long thought that much could be effected\r\nwere the Imperial Parliament occasionally to hold its sessions in Dublin,\r\nand to govern Ireland directly, so to speak, on the spot. This very\r\nmeasure was proposed by many distinguished Irishmen, during the agitation\r\nfor Repeal in 1843-44; it was made the subject of an eloquent eulogy by\r\nSheil at O'Connell's trial; it was seriously entertained by the Whig\r\nopposition of the day, as we know from a remarkable letter of Lord\r\nWaveney. This policy unfortunately passed out of sight; but even now, I\r\nbelieve, it would do the greatest good in Ireland. It would be something\r\nthat the proposed change would cause the wealth of England and Scotland\r\nlargely to flow into a poor country; that Irish absenteeism would be\r\ndiminished; that Ireland would become, more than she is now, an attractive\r\nplace of resort to the traveller. But it would be far more that the\r\npresence of the Imperial Parliament in College Green would necessarily\r\nlargely remove the ignorance of Irish affairs I have just referred to; it\r\nwould make English and Scotch members familiar with the requirements, the\r\nfeelings, the wishes of Irishmen; as has happily been said, it would\r\nrender our Irish legislation and administration 'racy of the Irish soil.'\r\nAnd probably more than any other expedient, it would exorcise the weak\r\nphantom of Home Rule by bringing Irishmen in contact with the majesty of\r\nthe Sovereign Assembly of the British Empire. I shall not comment on the\r\npetty inconveniences the scheme might cause; really they are not worthy of\r\nserious attention.\r\n\r\nThe occasional presence of Royalty, too, in Ireland, as was made manifest\r\nduring the late Queen's visit, unquestionably would have beneficent\r\nresults. It would gratify a sentiment of Celtic nature, always attached to\r\npersons rather than to institutions and laws, and especially attached to\r\nrulers and chiefs, which, in Ireland, has been scarcely gratified before;\r\nit would spread far and wide a happy and good influence; it would\r\ncertainly improve the social life of Ireland, and add something to her\r\nscanty material wealth. The maintenance of the Union, however, is the\r\nfirst requirement of a sound Irish and Imperial policy; one means of\r\nstrengthening that fundamental law of these realms, consistently with\r\nstrict constitutional justice, nay, if constitutional wrong is not to\r\ncontinue, has long been apparent to impartial minds. The\r\nover-representation of Ireland, in the House of Commons, is a flagrant\r\nanomaly, acknowledged for years; as I have remarked, it was largely\r\nexpected that this important subject would have been taken up before this\r\nby Lord Salisbury's Government, and have been settled in the Parliament of\r\n1895-1900. Taking the test of population alone, Ireland has, compared to\r\nEngland, Wales, and Scotland, an excess of twenty-three members; taking\r\nthe test of population and property combined, she has an excess probably\r\nof from thirty to forty. I am willing to allow that, in this matter, we\r\nought not to follow arithmetic only; Ireland, a poor country, far away\r\nfrom Westminster, may have a claim to a representation somewhat more\r\nnumerous than mere figures would give her. But can anything be more\r\nunjust, nay, absurd, than that Ireland should have one hundred and three\r\nmembers, and that the world of London, with a population about the same as\r\nthat of Ireland, and probably possessing tenfold wealth, should have\r\nlittle more than half that number? This excessive representation must be\r\nreduced, and Irish Nationalists cannot here appeal to the Union; the Union\r\ndid not save the Established Church of Ireland, secured by the Treaty in\r\nemphatic terms; and the Union must not be wrested to work gross injustice.\r\nThe anomaly can be only removed by a large scheme for the redistribution\r\nof seats, founded on sound constitutional principles; and should this\r\nbecome law, as I confidently hope will be one of the achievements of the\r\nexisting Parliament, the Union will acquire a new security, for the\r\nNationalist vote in the House of Commons would be greatly reduced, and the\r\nIrish Unionist vote would be greatly increased. A very few figures will\r\nprove this: the rural populations of the Unionist counties of Antrim and\r\nDown are upwards of four hundred and thirty thousand souls; the rural\r\npopulations of the Home Rule counties of Kildare, Kilkenny, King's,\r\nLongford, Wicklow, and Louth have a population less than three hundred and\r\nninety-eight thousand;[35] yet Antrim and Down have only eight members,\r\nthe other six counties have no less than twelve. The same disparity runs\r\nthrough all the Irish counties; in the boroughs of Ireland it is even more\r\nvisible. Protestant and Unionist Ireland, in a word, has probably fifteen\r\nor sixteen members too few; Catholic and anti-Unionist Ireland fifteen or\r\nsixteen too many; it is high time this plain wrong should be redressed; it\r\nis unnecessary to point out how this would strengthen the Union. And what\r\nprobably is not less important, it would make the representation of\r\nIreland, not, what it is now, an utterly false index of Irish opinion, but\r\na reasonably fair and trustworthy index; were the Irish representation cut\r\ndown to eighty members, the Nationalists would probably command not more\r\nthan fifty seats; the Unionists would command about thirty; and this,\r\ntaking all things into account, would be a proportion approaching what is\r\njust. The 'doing' of right, in this matter, has been too long deferred;\r\nloyal Ireland feels strongly upon the subject; the reform would be\r\naltogether in the interest of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE IRISH LAND--SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE LAND SYSTEM\r\nOF IRELAND TO THE YEAR 1870\r\n\r\n    Great importance in the history of Ireland of the conditions of land\r\n    tenure--The ancient Celtic land system and its characteristics--The\r\n    Norman conquest of Ireland--Norman feudalism in the Irish land--The\r\n    policy of Henry VII., and especially of Henry VIII.--The era of the\r\n    conquest and confiscation of the Irish land--The possessions of the\r\n    O'Connors of Offaly wrested from them--Forfeiture of the domains of\r\n    Shane O'Neill, and of the Earl of Desmond--Attempts at\r\n    colonisation--All Ireland made shire land--The extinction of the old\r\n    Celtic land system--The Plantation of Ulster--Progress of confiscation\r\n    during the reigns of the two first Stuarts--The Civil War--Immense\r\n    confiscations made by Cromwell--His scheme of colonisation a\r\n    failure--The era of confiscation closes after the battle of the Boyne\r\n    and the fall of Limerick--The Penal Code of Ireland--Its fatal effects\r\n    on the Irish land--Dismal period in Irish landed relations--Gradual\r\n    improvement--The period described by Arthur Young--Evil traces of the\r\n    past remain--Whiteboyism and agrarian disorder--State of Irish landed\r\n    relations up to the rebellion of 1798, and after the\r\n    Union--Over-population and the results--Distress after the\r\n    Peace--State of Irish landed relations up to 1844--The Report of the\r\n    Devon Commission--The Famine and its effects on the Irish land--The\r\n    Encumbered Estates Acts--State of Irish landed relations from 1848 to\r\n    1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of many communities, it has truly been said, have been\r\ndecisively affected by the conditions of the ownership and the occupation\r\nof the soil. The social, even the political, life of modern Europe has\r\nbeen, in a great measure, moulded by the land tenures that have grown out\r\nof the feudal system; I need only refer to the history of England, of\r\nFrance, and of Germany. This remark, however, especially applies to the\r\nevents that make up the annals of Ireland; that long and unhappy tale of\r\nmisfortunes and errors is intimately associated, all through, with the\r\nland, and with the relations connected with it. Modern research has shown\r\nhow grotesque and mischievous was the ignorance of the Tudor lawyers and\r\nstatesmen, who described the ancient organisation of the Irish land as a\r\nmedley of barbarian and pernicious usages; it was an archaic and imperfect\r\nspecimen of the feudal system, with differences indeed, but marked with\r\nits essential features. Norman feudalism, lawless and ill-ordered, was for\r\ncenturies, after the first Conquest, placed beside this primitive form of\r\nsociety, in parts of a country not half subdued; the results were seen in\r\nincessant strife and discord, and in social anarchy, which prevented\r\ncivilisation growing up. The Irishry had well-nigh driven the Englishry\r\ninto the sea, when Henry VII. tried to make his authority felt in Ireland;\r\nhis successor, partly a Celt in blood, and a real statesman, devised a\r\nnoble scheme for bringing an ill-governed dependency within the domain of\r\norder and law, by planting an Anglo-Norman and native aristocracy in the\r\nsoil, subject to a strong monarchy that would have protected the community\r\nas a whole. Most unfortunately the policy of Henry VIII. was not carried\r\nout; in the great conflict of the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries,\r\nIreland was drawn into a long struggle with England, and was repeatedly\r\nmade a place of arms for her foes; an era of savage conquest, accomplished\r\npiecemeal, with ruthless confiscation following in its train, was\r\nprotracted during nearly a century and a half; and at the close of the\r\nreign of William III., nine-tenths probably of the land of Ireland had\r\nbeen wrested from its former possessors, and the old Celtic land system\r\nhad been destroyed by the sword and by law. Race and religion made this\r\nposition of affairs much worse; the age of Protestant ascendency in\r\nIreland began; in infinitely the greatest part of the island the land was\r\nparcelled out among a caste of owners distinct in blood and faith from the\r\nchildren of the soil, and lording it over an oppressed peasantry; and the\r\nsystem was propped up by a code of cruel laws, which maintained and, so to\r\nspeak, stereotyped these evil divisions. The lines of the land system of\r\nIreland were thus finally laid down; a variety of economic and social\r\ncauses increased and deepened their extreme harshness; and though they\r\nhave gradually been softened, and are now all but effaced, their traces\r\nand the results are still to be seen. The last thirty years have witnessed\r\nrepeated attempts to effect radical changes in the modes of the ownership\r\nand the occupation of the land in Ireland; they have wrought a revolution\r\nin Irish landed relations, and have well-nigh turned them upside down; but\r\nthe consequences have assuredly not been fortunate. The land system of\r\nIreland has been made a chaos of economic disorder, of dissensions of\r\nclass, of legalised wrong, absolutely incompatible with social progress\r\nand the general welfare.\r\n\r\nI must glance, for an instant, at the distinctive features of the land\r\nsystem of Ireland in the Celtic age, for despite the effects of\r\nconfiscation and conquest, faint traces of it may still be seen, and have\r\na kind of influence.[36] As was the case in all communities of the Aryan\r\nstem, the land originally was largely held in collective ownership; but\r\nagriculture developed individual ownership by degrees, though less so in\r\nIreland than in more progressive countries. The people were settled on the\r\nsoil in tribes, clans, and septs, these being the larger and the smaller\r\nunits; the modes of the tenure of the land, misinterpreted by Elizabethan\r\nsages, differed widely from each other, but revealed the traditions of old\r\npatriarchal usage and power, especially in their canons of descent and\r\nsuccession. The feudalisation of the land, as it has been significantly\r\ncalled, a process which took place in nearly the whole of Europe, was also\r\nwitnessed in Ireland, to a certain extent; but this was not so complete\r\nand strongly marked as in France and England. The land, nevertheless, was,\r\nthroughout the island, held ultimately from a supreme monarch; it was\r\ndivided, under him, among families of princely chiefs, who ruled vast\r\ntracts with scarcely controlled authority; inferior chiefs were subject to\r\nthese; the organisation of the land had much in common with the\r\norganisation of the Anglo-Norman manor, and with the position of the Lord\r\nParamount of every manor, the head of the English State. The Irish kings\r\nand chiefs had lands in demesne; they had a landed and a personal\r\n_noblesse_; the territories they ruled were held by classes strongly\r\nresembling the free tenants, the villeins, and the serfs of the feudal\r\nsystem. All this, however, was not as perfectly defined as it was in lands\r\nfeudalised to a higher degree; and though the Davieses and Spensers were\r\nwholly in error in representing the dependents of the Irish kings and\r\nchiefs as little better than a horde of fighting men and slaves, Ireland\r\nnever fully possessed the liberties feudalism secured. The Ceile of\r\nsubstance, who had lands of his own, seems to have been in an inferior\r\nposition to the English freeholder; the Saer stock and Daer stock tenants\r\nheld their lands by a tenure like that of the metayers of France; the\r\nFuidhirs were kept in complete subjection, and had not even the rights of\r\nthe villein. The land, too, was still largely held in collective\r\nownership; in its occupation this is even now seen in backward and poor\r\ndistricts; and, curiously enough, distinctions were drawn between what was\r\na 'fair' and a 'rack rent,' words still common in the mouth of the Irish\r\npeasant, and to which recent legislation has given its sanction.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of most lands where anything resembling feudalism\r\nprevailed, with the single exception of England, under her strong\r\nMonarchy, Ireland in these circumstances was torn by continual discord,\r\nincreased by the recurring struggles with the Dane. The Celtic kings and\r\nchiefs, nevertheless, were beloved by their people; the land system fell\r\nin with Celtic tribal ideas and sentiments. I pass over the incidents of\r\nthe first Norman Conquest; in the course of time, an Anglo-Norman colony\r\nwas established, within a Pale ever-varying in extent, and held parts of\r\nthe country under feudal conditions, the remaining, and by far the\r\ngreatest, parts being left in the possession of the Celtic kings and\r\nprinces. Anglo-Norman feudalism, however, was completely different, in\r\nIreland, from what it was in England; it was not subject to vigorous\r\nkingly rule; it was confined within comparatively small limits. In these\r\ncircumstances the Pale fell into the hands of a few leading and great\r\nfamilies; these, as had been largely the case in Scotland, formed a\r\ndomineering and oppressive _noblesse_, continually engaged in quarrels\r\nbetween themselves, and in petty wars with the Celtic chiefs, and\r\ncompletely superior to the royal power in England. The Geraldines, the\r\nButlers, the De Burghs, and other great houses, had no law but their own\r\nwills in their vast lordships; their exactions and tyranny became a\r\nbyword; their lives were spent in savage feudal strife, and in 'hostings\r\nagainst the Irish enemy.' Strange to say, too, these scions of a mighty\r\nconquering race fell under the spell of the Celtic genius, and, as it was\r\nsaid, 'became more Irish than the Irish themselves; they were at least\r\nlargely assimilated to a Celtic model, and they adopted many of the usages\r\nof the Celt. It was not much otherwise in the Celtic region outside the\r\nPale; the Irish chiefs often blended in marriage with the Anglo-Norman\r\nsettlers; but they were continually at war with them, and with each\r\nother. Under these conditions, feudalism, in its best aspects, could take\r\nno root, in the land, in Ireland; and there is much reason to believe that\r\nthe archaic Irish land system was gradually changed and almost broken up,\r\nthe power of the kings and chiefs being greatly increased, and the\r\nposition of their dependents being made essentially worse. It is obvious\r\nthat in a land, a scene of such disorder and misrule, civilisation and all\r\nthat the word implies could not exist; Ireland was probably more barbarous\r\nat the close of the fifteenth century than she had been when she first saw\r\nHenry of Anjou. The Pale had been restricted within ever-narrowing bounds;\r\ngenerations of colonising 'Englishry' had entered the country, and had\r\nleft it in angry despair; the 'Irishry' had encroached on their\r\nconqueror's domain; the work of Strongbow and Fitzstephen appeared to be\r\nundone. Especially it was observed that nothing like a middle class, even\r\nthen the best element in the social life of England, had been able to\r\ndevelop itself in Ireland, and that the humbler classes were always in a\r\nstate of wretchedness, ground down by exaction, and exposed to incessant\r\nwrongs of all kinds. 'What common folk of all the world'--these were the\r\nwords of a State paper of the age--'is so poor, so feeble, so evil be seen\r\nin town and field, so greatly oppressed and trodden underfoot, fares so\r\nevil, with so great misery, and with so wretched a life, as the common\r\nfolk of Ireland?'\r\n\r\nHenry VII. strengthened the authority of the Crown in Ireland; the\r\nViceroyalty of Poynings marks an epoch in her chequered annals; but the\r\nconduct of the king was shifting and weak; the land fell under the control\r\nof the great House of Kildare; the Irishry were driven back, but in no\r\nsense subdued. Surrey, the victor of Flodden, intreated Henry VIII. to\r\nmake the country his own by sheer force of arms; but his master refused in\r\nstriking language; and proposed a scheme for bringing Ireland under the\r\ncontrol of the Monarchy, for encouraging civilisation and promoting order,\r\nthe wisest that has ever suggested itself to a British statesman. He made\r\nseveral of 'the degenerate' Norman _noblesse_ peers; he extended the same\r\ndignity to several Irish chiefs; he assembled representatives of Ireland\r\nin a Parliament composed of both races; he appointed commissioners to go\r\nthrough the country and to punish crime; above all--and this deserves\r\nspecial notice--he tried to conciliate the Celtic community by bringing\r\ntheir usages within the cognisance of the law, and giving them effectual\r\nlegal sanction; and he condemned the attempts being already made to force\r\nlaws on them peculiar to England. Had this enlightened policy been\r\nsteadily pursued, the history of Ireland would have run a wholly different\r\ncourse; but destiny, that has played so sinister a part in Irish affairs,\r\ninterfered to thwart the admirable designs of the king. The great\r\nGeraldine rebellion broke out, supported by irregular Celtic risings; from\r\nthis time forward, during five generations of man, the era of cruel but\r\nintermittent conquest, accompanied by wholesale confiscation, set in. The\r\npowerful tribe of the O'Connors of Offaly, closely associated with the\r\nfallen House of Kildare, was the first to feel the weight of the arm of\r\nEngland; its territories were forcibly overrun and annexed, given the name\r\nof the King's and the Queen's Counties, and peopled with a colony of\r\nsettlers from England. Celtic Ireland ere long was brought into the\r\nconflict between Elizabeth and Philip II., the representatives of the\r\nfaiths that were dividing Christendom; the princely chief, Shane O'Neill,\r\nfell a victim to the English conquerors, though their quarrel with him was\r\nnot wholly one of seeking the assistance of a foreign enemy; his vast\r\ndomains were, also, in part forfeited, in part handed over to a puppet of\r\nEnglish power. The frightful Desmond rebellion followed; it was directly\r\nencouraged by the Pope and by Spain; after a protracted struggle\r\napproaching a real civil war, the immense lordships of the great Geraldine\r\nHouse were confiscated, and granted to a colony of English blood. Tyrone,\r\nthe real successor of his kinsman, Shane O'Neill, a soldier and statesman\r\nof no ordinary parts, seeing, as he bitterly said, that his 'lands were\r\nmarked down by the spoiler,' endeavoured, not without partial success, to\r\ncombine a great Irish League against England; he entered into an alliance\r\nwith Spain; a Spanish army landed on the southern coast of Munster; after\r\na long and sanguinary contest, Tyrone yielded, but his resistance had been\r\nso formidable that he was allowed to retain his possessions.\r\n\r\nThe subjugation of a large part of Ireland, in the Elizabethan wars, was\r\nmarked by incidents of a most atrocious character. The Government had no\r\nregular army to act in the field; it was compelled largely to rely on\r\narmed levies of the Englishry, and on bodies of the Irishry attached to\r\nthe conqueror's standards; for in this, as in nearly all instances\r\nthroughout their history, the Irish Celts were at feud with each other;\r\nCeltic Ireland was a house divided against itself. The queen, it has been\r\nwritten, 'ruled over blood and ashes,' when Mountjoy sheathed his\r\nvictorious sword; the memory of this period still lives in Irish\r\ntradition. A season of exhaustion and repose ensued after James I. had\r\nascended the throne; but the time, in the phrase of Tacitus, had an evil\r\naspect in peace itself. The Pale had long before this been effaced;\r\nconquest and confiscation had spread over nearly the whole island; the\r\ndomination of England was felt almost everywhere. As the result, the whole\r\nof Ireland was made shire land; the old Celtic land system, which still\r\nwidely prevailed, was swept away by decisions of the Anglican Courts of\r\nJustice; it was declared to be 'a lewd and not law-worthy thing;' all the\r\nIrish land was subjected to English modes of tenure; they were imposed on\r\na people which detested these gifts of the stranger; innumerable tribal\r\nrights were destroyed. Ere long the work of confiscation began again; the\r\ndomains of Tyrone and of his kinsman O'Donnell were pronounced forfeited\r\nfor reasons that have never been ascertained; the Crown was placed in\r\npossession of nearly six counties of Ulster. Up to this time the\r\nsettlements of English colonists, which had been made in Ireland by Tudor\r\nconquest, had failed; the colonists had been almost lost in the midst of\r\nthe Irishry, who hemmed them around. This immense confiscation was,\r\nhowever, in part successful; it was carried out on comparatively\r\nenlightened principles; it has produced the famous Plantation of Ulster;\r\nand this, with other settlements in the counties of Antrim and Down, has\r\nestablished, in a large part of the northern province of Ireland, a hardy\r\nand thriving community, in the main, of Scottish blood. Confiscation,\r\nnevertheless, did not stop here; 'the ravages of war,' in Burke's\r\nlanguage, were 'carried on amidst seeming peace;' enormous tracts were\r\ntorn from their former owners on pretexts usually of the flimsiest kind,\r\nand were flung to Court favourites, to jobbing speculators, to greedy\r\nadventurers of the baser sort. By this time three-fourths probably of the\r\nsoil of Ireland had passed into the hands of a new race of possessors; the\r\ndescendants of Anglo-Norman nobles and of the Celtic princes had been\r\nsufferers well-nigh in the same proportion. At last Strafford marked out\r\nthe whole province of Connaught, for what has been called 'his majestic\r\nrapine;' this and other innumerable acts of spoliation and wrong\r\nunquestionably were the paramount cause of the great Celtic rising of\r\n1641. Another and soon to be a most potent element of evils and troubles\r\nhad already begun to make its sinister presence felt in Ireland. In the\r\ngreat religious schism of the sixteenth century, England had become\r\nProtestant, Ireland had remained Catholic, and each had taken opposite\r\nsides in the conflict that followed; though the Elizabethan wars were\r\nrather struggles of race than of faith. But as conquest and confiscation\r\nprogressed in Ireland, the Anglican Church, a scion of the Norman Church\r\nof the Pale, was erected on the ruins of its Celtic Catholic rival; the\r\nland more and more became possessed by settlers alien in creed from the\r\nold owners, and from the vanquished children of the soil; and harsh laws\r\nhad begun to deepen the distinctions between them. Nevertheless, though\r\nits signs had in some measure appeared, the era of Protestant ascendency\r\nand Catholic subjection had not been developed in Ireland, as yet, in its\r\nworst aspects.\r\n\r\nThe wild Celtic rising of 1641 was followed by a rising of the old\r\nEnglishry of the Pale--the descendants of the first Anglo-Norman settlers;\r\nboth movements were probably encouraged from France; though widely\r\ndifferent, they ran into each other. The great Civil War was now running\r\nits course in England; Ireland, for the most part, took the side of the\r\nking; the majority of Englishmen were certainly on the side of the\r\nParliament. I cannot retrace the scenes of the contest in Ireland; after a\r\nfierce and protracted struggle, in which an envoy of the Pope became the\r\nrepresentative of an ill-united Irish League; in which Preston and Ormond\r\nled the forces of the Pale, and Owen Roe O'Neill was at the head of the\r\nIrish Celts,--the whole island was subjugated by the sword of Cromwell, as\r\nit never had been subjugated before. Drogheda and Wexford are names of woe\r\nin the annals of Ireland; but the conquest of the Protector, ruthless as\r\nit was, was not so cruel as that of the Elizabethan soldiers; if deeply\r\nstained with blood, it was rapid and completely decisive. The colony in\r\nUlster had begun to flourish; Cromwell designed a scheme for the\r\ncolonisation of the vanquished country more thorough and extensive than\r\nany which had been designed before. Three-fourths of Ireland had been in\r\narms against the Parliament; that assembly had made grants by\r\nanticipation of Irish forfeited lands to 'adventurers' who had advanced it\r\nmoneys; an opportunity for immense confiscations had arisen; the Protector\r\nwas not slow to take advantage of it; his Puritan fanaticism, his hatred\r\nof the Irish people, especially of its 'idolatrous Papists,' his strong\r\nEnglish and religious sympathies, united to confirm him in his purpose.\r\nThe forfeited lands in four of the Irish counties were appropriated to the\r\nCommonwealth and its uses; those in eighteen were to be granted to the\r\n'adventurers' and the soldiery of the late conquest; those in seven were\r\nto be allotted to the army in England. The grants were to be either free,\r\nor to be purchased at nominal prices; the owners, who had lost their\r\nlands, were to be deported to Connaught--'Hell' was the alternative, the\r\ntradition runs--and 'Courts of Claims,' as they were called, were to be\r\nset up, to adjudicate on the conduct of those who were to be\r\ndispossessed--they were to be subjected to a test which scarcely one could\r\nsatisfy--and practically to measure confiscation out under the pretence of\r\nlaw. By these means Cromwell calculated that some forty thousand\r\ncolonists, of English blood and of the Puritan faith, would be poured into\r\nthe millions of acres which the sword had placed in the hands of his\r\nGovernment; these would form a prosperous settlement loyal to England;\r\nwould keep rebellion in Ireland for ever down; and would regenerate a land\r\ntaken from a race akin to the Amalekites of old. As a foretaste of the new\r\nand glorious order of things, Sir William Petty, a very able man,\r\nremarkably skilful in feathering his own nest, made a cadastral survey of\r\nIreland, which still remains.\r\n\r\nCromwell's scheme of confiscation was thoroughly carried out, spite of\r\nmuch angry wrangling between the Puritan warriors. The remains of the\r\ndefeated Irish armies went, in thousands, into exile in foreign lands;\r\nthey were the heralds of the renowned soldiery who, for a century and a\r\nhalf, were deadly, but honourable foes of the British name. The rule of\r\nthe Protector in Ireland was stern but enforced peace; Ireland was\r\nprostrate in the exhaustion of despair; there is much proof that, under\r\nthe Cromwellian settlement, the country made a kind of material progress.\r\nBut Cromwell's great scheme of colonisation failed, as such schemes had\r\nfailed in many instances before; a large majority of the 'adventurers' and\r\nthe soldiers sold their possessions, usually for a mere nothing: many\r\n'degenerated' like the old Norman families, and, won over by the spells\r\n'of the daughters of Heth,' had, in one or two generations, become 'mere\r\nIrish.' The ultimate result of the Cromwellian conquest was to establish\r\nin Ireland three or four thousand owners of the soil, of English blood and\r\nPuritan leanings, without the support of inferior dependents, in the midst\r\nof a vanquished population hostile in race and faith; the sentiments thus\r\nengendered have never died out; to this day 'a Cromwellian landlord' is a\r\nname of reproach in Catholic Ireland. At the Restoration hope for a moment\r\nrevived in the hearts of the ruined owners, who had been dispossessed by\r\nCromwell, and of whom hundreds had fought for the Crown; but this was\r\ndashed by the perfidy of Charles II. and his courtiers; the Cromwellian\r\nforfeitures were, in the main, confirmed; large tracts were given back to\r\nfavourites of the Stuarts, but thousands of beggared families lost their\r\nestates for ever through a policy of cruel baseness and wrong. Ireland\r\nremained quiescent for nearly thirty years; she even prospered under the\r\nwise rule of Ormond--one of the noblest figures in her unhappy history;\r\nbut the bitter memories of the past lived in the conquered people, though,\r\nas has repeatedly been seen in a Celtic race, they were treasured in\r\nsilence, and caused little apparent trouble. James II. ascended the throne\r\nin 1685; he had a great opportunity to mitigate many of the wrongs of\r\nIreland; he might have removed some of the evils of the Cromwellian\r\nconquest, and have effected changes in the settlement of the land, which,\r\nat least, would have done partial justice. But the unfortunate king was a\r\nbigot, and, in no sense, a statesman; like his father he tried the\r\ndesperate policy of making use of Ireland in his designs against English\r\nliberties; he sent Tyrconnell to Dublin, and, in a few months, revolution\r\nhad broken out through the country; English and Protestant Ireland was\r\nwell-nigh trampled underfoot; Catholic and Celtic Ireland rose up in a\r\nwild hope of revenge. I cannot even glance at the stirring events that\r\nfollowed; the descendants of ruined barons of the Pale and of Celtic\r\nprinces driven from their lands and their homes, joined in a great effort\r\nto raise a large armed force; the rising almost assumed a national aspect;\r\nbut after the Boyne and the fall of Limerick, it was finally quelled by\r\nWilliam III. The process of confiscation was once more renewed; thousands\r\nof acres were taken forcibly from those who had resisted in the field, and\r\nwere handed over to a new race of colonists belonging to the blood and the\r\ncreed of the victors; and the shameful violation of a solemn Treaty made\r\nall that was cruel in spoliation worse.\r\n\r\nThe era of conquest in Ireland and of confiscation by force--an agony\r\nprolonged for a century and a half--was brought to an end in the reign of\r\nWilliam III. This is not the place to examine the question on which side,\r\nas between England and Ireland, the balance of the wrongs that were done\r\ninclines; but if much that is cruel and shameful is to be laid to the\r\ncharge of England, Ireland, it cannot be forgotten, crossed her path\r\nrepeatedly in an age of grave national perils and troubles, and, moreover,\r\nwrecked her own cause by her wretched dissensions. The Irish land had now\r\nnearly all fallen into the hands of a caste of owners, of English and\r\nScottish descent, and in faith Protestant, divided from a people of\r\nCatholic occupiers for the most part of the Irish race; wide lines of\r\ndemarcation had been drawn between them; and there was no middle class to\r\nbridge over the gulf. In a part of Ulster alone where the proprietors and\r\nthe holders of the soil were largely of the same religion and blood, was\r\nthere the promise of a more auspicious order of things; even here causes\r\nof disunion were not wanting. Nor were these the only vices and dangers of\r\na land system which has scarcely had a parallel. Enormous tracts had been\r\nbestowed on owners who never saw their estates; absenteeism existed to an\r\nimmense extent; their lands, too, had, in thousands of instances, been\r\nunderlet to a class of intermediate owners, who were to form a body of\r\nmost oppressive landlords. In addition, the representatives of numbers of\r\nruined families still vegetated on the domains which had been their own;\r\nthe few families which had escaped from the spoilers, were held in\r\nreverence by the peasantry around; elements of disorder and trouble\r\ncontinued to fester. The destruction, too, of the old Celtic modes of land\r\ntenure, and the substitution of the English system, had unjustly\r\nannihilated tribal rights wholesale; the free, and other dependents of the\r\nIrish chiefs, had sunk into the position of mere tenants at will, that is,\r\nat the mercy of foreign and often unknown masters. One of the worst, if\r\nnot the most apparent evil, of the gigantic confiscations which had taken\r\nplace, and on which the land system had, so to speak, been founded, was\r\nthat the respect which attaches to the ancient ownership of land, and\r\nwhich forms, perhaps, its surest support, could hardly exist in any part\r\nof Ireland; the disastrous consequences may be traced to the present hour.\r\nLandlords, with titles of yesterday, won by the sword, could not feel the\r\ninterest in their estates and in the inhabitants on them, naturally felt\r\nby owners of gentle and ancient descent; the land which, as has been said,\r\nhad been flung like a fox to ravening hounds, could not attract to it\r\nhappy and peaceful memories; the very Government had learned to think it\r\ncould deal with the land as it pleased, and treated the rights gained by\r\nconfiscation with contempt. Prescription, the strongest cement of\r\nproperty, had no place in this ill-compacted land system.[37]\r\n\r\nThe era of Protestant ascendency bringing Catholic subjection with it, had\r\nnow set in for many years in Ireland; its evils were aggravated by harsh\r\ndivisions of race, and by more than a century of bitter memories; its\r\neffects were more conspicuous in the land than in other social relations.\r\nThis unnatural and calamitous position of affairs might, however, have\r\nbeen replaced ere long by a better order of things, had it not been\r\nartificially maintained and made enduring by legislation unexampled for\r\nits far-reaching cruelty. I cannot attempt to describe the Penal Code of\r\nIreland; in the emphatic words of Burke, 'it was a complete system, full\r\nof coherence and consistency; well digested and well composed in all its\r\nparts; it was a machine of wise and elaborate contrivance; and as well\r\nfitted for the oppression, impoverishment, and degradation of a people,\r\nand the debasement in them of human nature itself, as ever proceeded from\r\nthe perverted ingenuity of man.'[38] The objects of these execrable laws\r\nwere threefold: to exclude the Irish Catholic whether of Anglo-Irish or\r\nCeltic descent--misfortune had well-nigh effaced the distinction--from\r\nevery office of trust in the State, from every profession, almost from\r\nevery walk of life; to persecute and proscribe the Catholic Church of\r\nIreland, and to place its priesthood under a humiliating ban, and finally\r\nto ruin and degrade the few remaining Catholic owners of the soil; to\r\nprevent the Irish Catholic from acquiring any real interest in it; and,\r\nabove all, to keep the Catholic peasantry in a condition of thraldom.[39]\r\nThe Code was only too successful in compassing its ends; I pass from its\r\noperation as regards the two first, to point out how it sought to attain\r\nthe third, and how its provisions affected the Irish land and the manifold\r\nrelations connected with it. The estate of the Irish Catholic owner was\r\nnot to follow the ordinary courses of descent; it was 'to gavel,' and to\r\nbe divided among many persons; this was for the avowed purpose of making\r\n'the landed property of Papists crumble away, and disappear.' The Irish\r\nCatholic owner was subjected to cruel enactments that literally set his\r\nhousehold against him; his wife and children were bribed to become his\r\nfoes; law sate at his hearth to make his existence wretched. The Irish\r\nCatholic, too, was forbidden to acquire land by purchase or even to\r\npossess an incumbrance on it; as far as possible the ownership of land was\r\nstrictly confined to the Protestant caste. But the wrong that, in its\r\nconsequences at least, was perhaps the worst, was that the Catholic\r\noccupier of the Irish soil could not obtain anything like an advantageous\r\ntenure; he could not have a lease for a period beyond thirty-one years,\r\nand this, too, at an excessive rent; and, in the great mass of instances,\r\nhe was a serf holding merely at will.\r\n\r\nThe forty years that succeeded the death of William III. are certainly the\r\nmost mournful period in Irish history. The memories of conquest and\r\nconfiscation were still fresh; the Penal Code kept Catholic Ireland in its\r\nchains; society was fashioned on the type of the domination of a class,\r\nseparated from a whole community in race and faith. Nothing was left\r\nundone to perpetuate this evil order of things; the Irish Parliament was a\r\nmere oligarchy of the sons of the colonists of Elizabeth, Cromwell, and\r\nWilliam, apart from a few leading men in Ulster; its legislation for the\r\nvanquished race was barbarous; Lords-Lieutenant spoke of the Irish\r\nCatholics as of 'the common enemy;' a 'Papist was presumed not to exist'\r\nin the Irish Courts of Justice. Meanwhile the penal laws were relentlessly\r\ncarried out for years; the Irish Catholic was placed under a universal\r\nban; the Catholic Church of Ireland lay, as it were, in the valley of the\r\nshadow of death. But the direst consequences appeared in the land, and in\r\nthe social life of the landed classes; these were most calamitous and have\r\nstill left their traces. Many of the few Catholic owners abandoned their\r\nestates, and carried their swords into foreign lands, where some rose to\r\nwell-deserved eminence; a small number conformed to the dominant faith in\r\norder to exist in comparative peace at home; the majority clung to their\r\nlands and bowed their heads to oppression. The Protestant lords of the\r\nsoil were what their antecedents and the law had made them; they were long\r\na harsh and exacting order of men, filled with bigotry and the pride of a\r\nconquering race; they regarded the inferiors they ruled as pariahs and\r\nhelots. But, as usually happens, when society is in an unnatural state,\r\nthey did not prosper amidst the ruins around them; their lands were kept\r\non a kind of pernicious mortmain, as they could not mortgage or sell them\r\nfreely; absenteeism with all its mischiefs greatly increased; and\r\nmiddleman tenures largely multiplied, subjecting the peasantry to a\r\ndetestable breed of landlords, Protestants and of English descent, like\r\ntheir superiors, but much worse tyrants. As for the mass of the Catholic\r\noccupiers of the soil, they were kept down in the lowest state of serfdom;\r\nbut multitudes found their way into foreign armies; 'the wild geese,' as\r\nthey were pathetically called, flew to Austria and, above all, to France,\r\nwhere, in the ranks of the celebrated Irish Brigade--'ever and everywhere'\r\ntrue to the Bourbon lilies--they won renown at Dettingen, Fontenoy, and\r\nother fields of fame. The aspect of Ireland bore too faithful witness to\r\nthe misery engendered in this evil order of things. The country was still\r\ncovered with the wrecks of the late wars; the habitations, even of the\r\nProtestant gentry, were squalid and mean; the towns were, in many\r\ninstances, sinking into decay; the peasantry were huddled together into\r\nvillages of huts; the traveller roamed through vast wastes of unfenced\r\npasturage, evidences of a land almost left in a state of nature. Hideous\r\nfamines were of repeated occurrence; one, that of 1739-41, swept the\r\npopulation away in tens of thousands; the Irish Parliament\r\ncharacteristically did nothing to help the sufferers; it met the emergency\r\nby strengthening the means to enforce the payment of rent. The miserable\r\ncondition of Ireland was made worse by the legislation of the British\r\nParliament, which treated the country as a conquered colony; and, true to\r\nthe principles of the mercantile system, impeded or prevented the growth\r\nof several Irish industries. This was, of course, most injurious to the\r\nProtestant settlers; but these were held down by the ruling power; as was\r\nfinely said, 'they knelt to England on the necks of their countrymen.' The\r\nstate of things in the colonised parts of Ulster was somewhat better; but\r\nthe Scottish and Presbyterian population of this corner of Ireland had not\r\na few causes of serious complaint.[40]\r\n\r\nIn the next generation a great but gradual change passed over the state of\r\nthe Irish community. The Penal Code was not in letter relaxed; but the\r\nevil spirit which had conceived it lost much of its force. The men who had\r\nfought at the Boyne and at Aghrim had passed away; the human conscience,\r\nmoved by the influences of the eighteenth century, revolted from the\r\nbarbarous legislation of a half-fanatical age. The Irish Catholics slowly\r\nbegan to make themselves felt in the State; many amassed large fortunes in\r\nforeign commerce; shut out as they still were by law from almost every\r\nprofession and office, they made their way into the medical calling, and\r\nespecially at the Bar, where their disabilities were evaded or ignored.\r\nThe Catholic Church was no longer proscribed; its worship, indeed, was\r\nstill carried on under degrading conditions; but its priesthood were\r\npermitted to perform their sacred functions in peace; its dignitaries were\r\neven countenanced by the men in power at the Castle. This great social\r\nchange was conspicuously seen in the land; landed relations were markedly\r\nimproved, and partly transformed. The Catholic owners were permitted to\r\nhold their estates free from the cruel vexations of the past; they began\r\nto live on terms of friendship with the Protestant caste; legal fictions\r\nannulled the laws which had made their lives wretched; their lands were,\r\nin many instances, held by the Protestant gentry on secret trusts; and\r\nthese, though contrary to law, were, as a rule, most honourably fulfilled.\r\nThe principal, however, and most decisive change appeared in the position\r\nand the sentiments of the Protestant lords of the soil. As time rolled on,\r\nand threw its kindly growths over the settlement of confiscation and the\r\nsword, these men began to feel that Ireland was their country and home;\r\nthey became, to a certain extent, Irishmen; they felt sympathy, by\r\ndegrees, with the conquered serfs in their midst. This feeling was\r\nstrengthened by the tyrannous selfishness of the British Parliament, which\r\ntreated Ireland as if she were its footstool, and of the official class,\r\nnearly all Englishmen, who lorded it over the land they despised; an\r\n'Irish interest' grew up in the Parliament at College Green, composed very\r\nlargely of the Protestant landlords; this became patriotic, in a certain\r\nsense, and a protector of the scanty rights of Ireland. As social order,\r\ntoo, was seldom disturbed, the wealth of the country had considerably\r\nincreased; the gentry acquired a greater interest in their estates, and\r\nbecame more and more attached to them; absenteeism, as the result,\r\nperceptibly lessened; and middleman tenures, though still prevalent,\r\ndiminished remarkably in the more progressive counties. The deep lines of\r\ndemarcation which kept apart the owners and the occupiers of the soil were\r\nthus to a certain extent bridged over; the Irish landlord, especially if\r\nresident, became a kindlier superior than his fathers had been; the Irish\r\npeasant became less a stranger to him.\r\n\r\nThe evidences of this better order of things became manifest on the face\r\nof the country. Agriculture, though still backward, made real progress;\r\nthe breeds of farming animals greatly improved; the huge breadths of\r\npasturage had a less deserted aspect. The country towns had generally\r\nadvanced; the land had been opened by good roads; the means of locomotion\r\nhad been largely multiplied. The rental of Ireland had doubled within\r\nliving memory; in some counties, indeed, it was nearly as high as it is\r\nnow; the land was at a price of more years' purchase than it is at the\r\nclose of the nineteenth century. It was at this period that the great\r\ncountry houses of Ireland were built, and their vast demesnes laid out;\r\nthe wages of labour were low, but had distinctly risen; the peasant hind,\r\nArthur Young tells us, in point of food and clothing, was as well off as\r\nhis fellow in England. The land was largely parcelled out into\r\nconsiderable farms; but small holdings were on the increase; and the\r\ncottar system, in the course of time to become a source of manifold evils,\r\nwas not yet a cause of much mischief; the pressure of population on the\r\nsoil was not severely felt. Many of the great landlords, too, were\r\nexcellent men; they ruled the country well, and greatly improved their\r\nestates; in numberless instances they had won the hearts of dependents,\r\nwho regarded them as kind masters. Yet the picture was not without a dark\r\nside; this land system still had evil, nay, repulsive, features. Except in\r\nthe best part of Ulster the deep divisions of race and faith continued to\r\nbe profoundly marked; the Penal Code had made these, to a great extent,\r\nindelible. There was still much oppression and exaction in landed\r\nrelations; the class of small landlords and the class of middlemen were\r\ntoo generally tyrannical and harsh; complaints of over-renting were not\r\ninfrequent; and if the great landlords, as a rule, were not severe\r\nsuperiors, many were extravagant, addicted to excess, and reckless\r\nduellists; they bore a strong resemblance to the seigneurie of the old\r\nFrench Monarchy. The peasantry, too, remained serfs, illiterate,\r\nignorant, and superstitious; the good feelings they often had for their\r\nlords had too much of the submissiveness of the slave; and virtuous as\r\ntheir women ordinarily were, they too generally yielded to the lusts of\r\ntheir masters. The habitations, besides, of this population were still\r\nwretched; if their lot had assuredly become better, it was often hard,\r\nabove all, degraded. They had begun to feel more acutely the ills they\r\nsuffered; in many counties they had banded themselves together into\r\nlawless leagues, to protect themselves and to resist authority. These\r\nassociations, known by the general name of Whiteboys--perhaps taken from\r\nthe Camisards of the Cevennes--had as their objects the preservation of\r\nrights of commonage, the extinction of tithes, and the reduction of rents;\r\nthey may be traced back to the great confiscations of the past; they were\r\nheld together by secret leaders and passwords; and they often kept whole\r\ndistricts in a state of terror. A Draconic Code was directed against them;\r\nthough often put down they have risen to life again; Ireland has never\r\nsince been completely free from them; their influence still is distinctly\r\napparent. Associations of somewhat a similar kind, known as Steelboys and\r\nOakboys, were formed even in the good parts of Ulster; but they were much\r\nless dangerous and were not permanent. It is a characteristic of\r\nWhiteboyism, as it has ever since been called, that it has always had a\r\npolitical side, and lends itself to revolutionary movements against\r\ngovernment itself.[41]\r\n\r\nThough Protestant ascendency was still supreme at this period, the\r\nconfiscations of the past had not been forgotten; they were treasured in\r\nthe minds of the descendants of the old Catholic families, and of the\r\npopulation among which they lived. The extinction, too, of the tribal\r\nIrish tenures, had, we have seen, been a cause of grievous wrongs; this\r\nwas a tradition, also, handed down from father to son, and was still fresh\r\nin the remembrance of a whole race. The land system, though to outward\r\nseeming secure, nevertheless rested on unstable foundations, as was to\r\nappear in the course of time; another element of disturbance was being\r\nformed, which ultimately was to have immense force. Under the modes of\r\nland tenure, which prevailed in England, since the system of small\r\nholdings had been broken up, the land had generally been laid out in large\r\nfarms; partly from this circumstance, and partly owing to custom, the\r\ncharge of making permanent improvements of the land had almost everywhere\r\ndevolved on the owner of the soil; a tenant, who rented a farm, took it,\r\nso to speak, equipped with the buildings and other things of the kind that\r\nwere suitable to it. But in Ireland, partly because small farms were\r\nnumerous, and partly because the custom had never grown up--the history of\r\nthe past fully accounts for this--the permanent improvements were very\r\nseldom made by the landlord; the tenant, who held land, had to add, as it\r\nwere, its plant to it; he had to do much that gave it any real value. As\r\nthe inevitable result, the Irish occupier of the soil felt that he had\r\nacquired a concurrent right in it; this, if the improvements were solid\r\nand lasting, might almost amount to a partial joint-ownership, at least\r\ngive him, in equity, a real hold on the land. But a right of this kind was\r\nnot recognised by the law, founded as this was upon notions of English\r\ntenure; it was liable to be destroyed should the tenant be dispossessed;\r\nand as the tenure of the immense majority of the occupiers of the soil in\r\nIreland was either at will, or for a short term at a high rent, this\r\nright, essentially of a quasi-proprietary kind, was made precarious, and\r\nhad no legal protection. With the prescience of genius, Burke perceived\r\nthe evils that might grow out of this state of things, though, as yet,\r\nthese were not much felt; he saw that it discouraged improvement of almost\r\nevery kind; especially he saw that the denial of legal sanction to the\r\nrights in the land a tenant might have, and the fact that his tenure was\r\nshort and uncertain, might become a source of grave wrong, and of\r\nfar-reaching discontent. In a word, he detected an economic vice in the\r\nland system of Ireland which, in the long run, was to do great mischief;\r\nand curiously enough he indicated the remedies that ought to be applied,\r\nand pointed out the true principles of a reform of Irish land tenure. It\r\nwould have been well had British statesmen adopted these; his simple,\r\njust, and statesmanlike plan puts to shame the ill-designed and\r\nunsuccessful attempts that have been made to recast the Irish land system\r\nof late years, and the false, reckless, and socialistic theories at\r\npresent current on this important subject.[42]\r\n\r\nI must pass over even the main events of the history of Ireland, after\r\nthis period, up to the close of the eighteenth century. The 'Irish\r\ninterest,' mainly composed of the great landed gentry, and turning to\r\naccount the American War, compelled the Parliament at Westminster to relax\r\nmany of the commercial restraints on Ireland, and to concede her a partial\r\nfree trade; under the guidance of the illustrious Grattan it obtained\r\nlegislative independence for the Irish Parliament. At the same time the\r\nPenal Code was largely repealed; the Irish Catholic was permitted to\r\nacquire the ownership of the soil; before long he received the electoral\r\nfranchise, though he was still excluded from the Irish Houses of Lords and\r\nCommons. In these circumstances, Ireland made real material and social\r\nprogress; the wealth of the country rapidly increased; the Protestant and\r\nCatholic upper classes began to unite in marriage; a commercial middle\r\nclass, if still very weak, grew up. Ireland seemed about to enter a\r\nhappier era; yet there were drawbacks to this partial welfare, especially\r\nas regards the land system. Middleman tenures were becoming much less\r\nfrequent; absenteeism was markedly on the decline; but partly owing to\r\ntheir contact with the Parliament in College Green, and to the brilliant\r\nsocial life it created in Dublin, the landed gentry became more\r\nextravagant than their fathers had been; they began to raise their rents\r\nand to encumber their estates; over-renting became more common than\r\nbefore; Whiteboy movements and agrarian disorder prevailed in many\r\ndistricts. Ireland, however, probably would have made a great advance but\r\nfor the evil passions which the French Revolution engendered in the frame\r\nof a society still deeply diseased. I cannot dwell on the unhappy years\r\nthat followed, leading to the Rebellion of 1798; I must confine myself to\r\ntheir influence on the Irish land system. The object of Tone and of the\r\nUnited Irish leaders was to combine Scottish and Presbyterian Ulster, and\r\nthe great mass of the Irish Catholics, into a league against British rule\r\nand for 'Irish freedom;' unhappily, they were but too successful. They\r\nappealed, not in vain, to thousands of farmers and traders in the Northern\r\nProvince, who had long had solid grounds of discontent, and had been\r\ndeeply stirred by the Revolution in France; they laid hold on the elements\r\nof disorder and of division of race and faith, abounding in Catholic\r\nIreland, but largely concealed, and called on the peasantry to overthrow\r\ntheir Protestant tyrants, and to strike a decisive blow in 'the cause of\r\nIreland.' Evil incentives were recklessly employed to arouse popular\r\npassions; maps of the old confiscated lands were made; and active\r\nemissaries went through the country, reviving dangerous traditions of the\r\npast, and stimulating the worst sentiments of hatred, greed, and revenge.\r\nAs the result, sedition ran riot in Ulster; in the Southern Provinces\r\nthere was a great outburst of Whiteboy crime, and a widespread rising\r\nagainst the payment of rent; and thousands of the occupiers of the soil\r\nwere swept into the United Irish ranks, scarcely conscious of the perils\r\nto which they were exposed. How the movement led to the bloody rebellion\r\nof 1798, and how this was put down after a desperate struggle, it is\r\nunnecessary to consider here; the consequences in Irish landed relations\r\nwere most unfortunate. It is untrue that the large majority of the owners\r\nof the Irish soil were guilty of the crimes that have been laid to their\r\ncharge; but they bitterly resented the allusions to the confiscations of a\r\nbygone past; they became more estranged from their inferiors than they had\r\nbeen for years.[43]\r\n\r\nThis terrible outbreak shook society in Ireland to its base, revived the\r\nold divisions of race and faith which had been disappearing to a\r\nconsiderable extent, and left memories behind which have not been\r\nforgotten. Its inevitable result was to lead to the Union, a measure long\r\nin the contemplation of British statesmen, and especially of Pitt, and\r\nperhaps necessary in the most critical circumstances of the time. I cannot\r\neven refer to the events attending this great constitutional change; a\r\nlarge majority of the leading Irish landlords disliked it at heart; but a\r\nminority, alarmed for their possessions, gave it support; how strong this\r\nfeeling was may be seen in a famous speech of Lord Clare, who described\r\nthe whole order of men as 'the heirs of confiscation hemmed in by enemies\r\nbrooding on their wrongs.' The Union greatly weakened the influence of\r\nthe Irish landed gentry, which had been very powerful in the defunct\r\nParliament; the 'Irish interest,' for many years a real force, was almost\r\nsubverted; English officials became again supreme at the Castle; a\r\nbureaucracy gradually began to supplant the aristocracy of landlords in\r\nevery sphere of government. As respects the land and landed relations, the\r\nclass of Catholic owners slowly augmented; but the consequences were\r\ntrivial and not marked; middleman tenures continued steadily to disappear;\r\nbut absenteeism certainly increased, though absentee estates were usually\r\nbetter managed than before. Meanwhile causes of grave importance, tending\r\nto momentous social results, were profoundly affecting the whole land\r\nsystem, and the position of the classes dependent on it. Partly owing to\r\nthe corn laws of the Irish Parliament, partly to the extension of the\r\nParliamentary franchise, in 1793, to the great mass of the Catholic\r\npeasantry, but principally to the effects of the long war with France,\r\nIreland, it may be said, was well-nigh changed from a pastoral to an\r\nagricultural country; large farms were generally replaced by small; the\r\nland in most districts was divided into little tillage holdings; the\r\ncottar system multiplied apace; the population, about three millions of\r\nsouls in the day of Arthur Young, increased to more than six millions at\r\nthe Peace of 1815; and this population becoming every year more dense, for\r\nthe most part eked existence out on a precarious root. The economic and\r\nsocial consequences were very great, and continued in operation during a\r\nlong series of years. The competition for the possession of land became\r\nintensely keen; rents were unnaturally forced up in thousands of cases;\r\nthe value of landed property enormously rose; all this encouraged\r\nextravagance among the landed gentry, and especially induced them largely\r\nto encumber their estates. At the same time the wages of labour distinctly\r\ndeclined; the condition of the Irish labouring peasant, when Edward\r\nWakefield, a very industrious and able observer, wrote on the state of\r\nIreland in 1812, was markedly worse than it had been in the time of Arthur\r\nYoung. Yet these were not the most serious, at least, the most lasting,\r\neffects of the revolution taking place in landed relations. As the large\r\nfarm system was being broken up, as the small farm system had come in its\r\nstead, and as population had rapidly grown, the occupiers of the soil had\r\nmore and more made the permanent additions to their holdings; they had\r\nbuilt, fenced, and reclaimed land, more and more; and in the general\r\neagerness to obtain the possession of land, considerable sums were often\r\npaid for farms on their transfer. The concurrent rights of the tenant\r\nclasses in Ireland had thus become enormously increased; they often\r\namounted, equitably, to a real joint-ownership; yet these rights were\r\nwithout the support of law, and were liable to be extinguished often at\r\nthe mere will of the landlord. In Ulster alone, in its Presbyterian and\r\nScottish parts, where the landed classes had been less disunited than in\r\nthe South, a custom, now of considerable strength, had for a long time\r\nmade the tenure of the peasant comparatively secure; yet even this was not\r\nunder the aegis of law.[44]\r\n\r\nMade wise, after the event, we now clearly perceive what ought to have\r\nbeen done for Ireland in this position of affairs. There never had been an\r\nIrish poor law; Protestant property was not to be charged for Catholic\r\nwant; but the population was fast increasing; a mass of wretched poverty\r\nwas being formed; this should have been supported, and yet checked, by a\r\npoor law. At the same time legislation, as Burke had contended, should\r\nhave vindicated the moral rights of the occupier of the soil, should have\r\nmade what really was his property his own, should have rendered his tenure\r\nprofitable and secure. Nothing of the kind, however, came into the minds\r\nof British statesmen, or even, it must be said, of the best Irishmen of\r\nthe day--the age was one of Toryism harsh and unfeeling; the abuses of the\r\npoor law in England were great; it was not contemplated to apply it to\r\nIreland; above all, the equitable claims of the Irish tenant were not\r\nunderstood or deemed worthy of notice; English tenure, utterly unfitted to\r\nhis true position, was good enough for him. The land system, nevertheless,\r\nwas not much disturbed while the high prices of the war prevailed; there\r\nwas a good deal indeed of disorder connected with the land, but society\r\nwas not deeply affected. And it is only just to observe that the\r\nlandlords, as a class, did respect the concurrent rights of their tenants\r\nin the soil; the conclusive proof is that these could not have grown up\r\nhad they been generally, or even largely, set at nought. But a great and\r\ncalamitous change passed over Ireland when the comparative wealth caused\r\nby the war collapsed, and when the return to cash payments made the\r\neffects worse. Rents suddenly fell greatly, and even disappeared; the\r\nwages of labour, which had usually been paid through what may be called a\r\nwretched truck system, were reduced to a remarkable degree; hundreds of\r\nthousands of the cottar peasantry sank to the lowest depths of indigence.\r\nA great social convulsion, in a word, took place; this culminated in\r\nfamine in several counties; a miserable population was deprived of the\r\nmeans of subsistence. In these circumstances the owners of the soil acted\r\nas a class would ordinarily act; many, impoverished themselves, let things\r\ndrift; many made themselves conspicuous for good works of charity; a\r\nminority had recourse to severe measures, like the English landlords of\r\nthe sixteenth century, to get rid of a mass of poverty clinging in despair\r\nto the land. The old divisions of race and faith unquestionably\r\naggravated this state of things; but the Government of the day showed\r\nlittle forethought, and, in fact, was infinitely the most to blame; it met\r\nthe emergency, not by wise and healing measures, but by legislation, which\r\nmade the eviction of the peasant from his holding easy and cheap, and by\r\nhaving recourse to repression unjust and severe in the extreme. In too\r\nmany instances, 'clearances' of estates, an evil word, were witnessed;\r\nhundreds of families were driven from their homes and cast on the world;\r\nas the necessary result, in numberless cases, the equitable rights of the\r\nIrish tenant were ruthlessly destroyed. As a matter of course,\r\nWhiteboyism, never completely suppressed, broke out in formidable agrarian\r\ndisorder; the peasantry, deprived of the protection of law, leagued\r\nthemselves together to enforce a law of their own; crime multiplied to an\r\nimmense extent; all the machinery of coercion could not wholly keep it\r\nunder.[45]\r\n\r\nI must pass rapidly over the next twenty years, though a very important\r\nperiod in Irish history. Catholic emancipation was wrung by O'Connell,\r\nfrom a reluctant Ministry, through violent agitation, which distracted\r\nIreland for years; the Irish Catholic was admitted into Parliament at\r\nlast. This great event was followed by the savage Tithe War, a movement\r\nagainst the Anglican Church in Ireland stained with detestable deeds of\r\nblood; the representation of Ireland passed largely into O'Connell's\r\nhands, the head of what was called 'his Catholic Tail.' Protestant\r\nascendency in Ireland received a mortal blow; the influence of the Irish\r\nlanded gentry still further declined; that of the bureaucracy at the\r\nCastle increased. From this time forward the Irish landlord began to feel\r\nhis position really insecure; it is remarkable how few large mansions and\r\ndemesnes have ever since been designed or completed by this order of men.\r\nAfter the disastrous period which came to an end about 1826, the wealth of\r\nIreland perceptibly grew; a kind of prosperity existed in many parts of\r\nthe country. The age, too, had become more liberal and humane; the\r\nmiddleman was got rid of in not a few districts; the absentee landlords\r\ndevoted more attention to their estates than they had ever devoted before.\r\nThe process of eviction, moreover, became much less frequent, though too\r\nfrequent for social order and peace; a considerable number of Irish\r\nlandlords expended large sums in improving their lands; farms were\r\nconsolidated, with good results, in many parts of the country. But the\r\nessential features of the land system were not much changed; its economic\r\nconditions became, in important respects, worse. The landed gentry, if\r\nmuch less extravagant than their fathers had been, were, nevertheless, as\r\na class, much involved in debt; and, as usually has been seen in cases of\r\nthe kind, they became less really prosperous, as their authority declined.\r\nMeanwhile, the population had continued rapidly to increase; by the close\r\nof this period it exceeded eight millions of souls, a total far too great\r\nfor the resources of the land. The phenomena, already critical, became\r\nmore sinister; rents were again forced up as the wealth of the country\r\naugmented, and reached the highest level they have ever attained; the\r\nwages of labour did not fall, indeed, they could hardly fall lower; but\r\nthe cottar population had become more than ever dense; the competition for\r\nthe possession of the soil grew fierce; as necessarily followed, the\r\nquasi-proprietary rights of the tenant in his holding had been enlarged,\r\nand yet these were still outside the pale of the law. A Report, made in\r\n1837-38, disclosed the appalling fact that two millions and a half of the\r\nIrish community were for months in every year on the verge of starvation,\r\nand always in a condition of extreme misery. Though Ireland had made, in a\r\nsense, progress, her economic state had thus become dangerous, and very\r\nbad; and a poor law, enacted at last in 1838, was utterly unable to cope\r\nwith the evil. Whiteboy crime and disorders continued to abound; in 1844,\r\nan average year, there were more than a thousand instances of offences in\r\nlanded relations.\r\n\r\nThe year 1843 was that of the great Repeal movement, of which O'Connell\r\nwas the master spirit. Peel had been Prime Minister for two years; his\r\nattention had been already turned to the vices and the perils of the Irish\r\nland system. He had been Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1812 to 1818;\r\nbut he had been identified with the Tory misrule of that time; and though,\r\nlike Chesterfield in another age, he had been too sagacious not to see\r\nthat poverty made the social ills of Ireland more acute and worse, he had\r\nbeen the ablest opponent of the Catholic cause, had supported Protestant\r\nascendency in many ways; and had not been in any sense an Irish reformer.\r\nA strong Conservative of the great middle class in England, he looked on\r\nIreland as an almost foreign land, and had scarcely any knowledge of her\r\nreal needs; and though his severe administration at the Castle had been\r\nwise and just, he carried out coercion with a steady hand, and is supposed\r\nto have been the author of the code of cheap ejectment, a cause of a great\r\ndeal of evil and wrong. But his mind, if slow in moving, was moved at\r\nlast; he saw that Ireland largely required the amending hand; the conduct\r\nof O'Connell, no doubt, had quickened his purpose. I cannot dwell on\r\nPeel's other Irish measures; at the close of 1843 he appointed a\r\nCommission charged to inquire into the state of Irish landed relations;\r\nhad he continued long at the head of the State, he would probably have\r\ndone much to improve the Irish land system. The Commission had, as\r\nPresident, the chief of the great House of Courtenay; it was almost wholly\r\ncomposed of Englishmen, more or less associated with land in England; it\r\nwas, therefore, ill constituted to deal with what may be called the Irish\r\nLand Question. But it investigated the subject it treated with most\r\npraiseworthy care; entering into every detail of Irish landed relations,\r\ntheir history in the past, the state of land tenure, the condition of the\r\ndifferent classes seated on the land, the working of the law with respect\r\nto tenant's improvements, the means of diminishing the wretched millions\r\nsquatting on the soil, agrarian crime and all that it involved; the mass\r\nof evidence it collected is still of the greatest value. The Report it\r\nmade, if somewhat over-cautious and timid, was very instructive in many\r\nrespects; especially it showed how the Irish land system grew out of the\r\nconquests and confiscations of the past, and still bore the marks of its\r\nill-omened origin, notably in the lines drawn between the owners and the\r\noccupiers of the soil marked by a profound division of race and faith; and\r\nmany of the suggestions it made were wise, nay, excellent. But on the\r\ncapital subject of land tenure, by many degrees the most important, the\r\nReport only too clearly revealed the ignorance of Englishmen as regards\r\nIreland, and, above all, as regards her landed relations. The Commission\r\nought to have fully recognised the concurrent rights in the soil, which\r\nthe Irish occupier had acquired in tens of thousands of instances, rights\r\noften equivalent to more or less joint-ownership; it ought to have\r\ninsisted that the Tenant Right, as it was now called, of the Ulster\r\nCustom, and the claims arising from improvements, the work of the tenant,\r\nand from sums paid on the transfer of farms, should be made law-worthy,\r\nand effectually secured. With a want of insight which would have made\r\nBurke gnash his teeth, it took exactly an opposite course; it warned the\r\nIrish landlord that these concurrent rights were creating against him 'an\r\nembryo copyhold,' and eating away his freehold ownership; it plainly\r\nhinted that he would do well to get rid of them. It even refused to\r\nacknowledge that the tenant had a claim to any improvements if made in the\r\npast; but it proposed a scheme for compensating him for improvements made\r\nin the future, so limited and fenced round with restrictions, that it was\r\nquite illusory, and indeed deceptive. The Report caused intense\r\nindignation in Ulster, and was not well received in any part of\r\nIreland.[46]\r\n\r\nBills, founded on the Report of the Devon Commission, as it was called,\r\nwere brought into Parliament, but never became law. Within a few months\r\nIreland was in the throes of an agony, the most terrible, perhaps, that\r\nhas befallen any land in the nineteenth century. In the autumn of 1845,\r\nthe potato, which formed the only food of the indigent multitudes fastened\r\non the land, failed, to a considerable extent, in many districts; in the\r\nfollowing year the crop was all but completely destroyed. Famine, far more\r\ngeneral and appalling than that of twenty-five years before, had soon held\r\na wretched population in its grasp; the results may almost be compared to\r\nthose of the Black Death, and of the famines of the Middle Ages. The land\r\nsystem went to wreck in whole counties, especially in the west and along\r\nthe seaboard; hundreds of the landed gentry were involved in ruin;\r\nthousands of farmers of the better class became bankrupt; the dense cottar\r\nmultitudes were literally lifted up from the soil, and cast adrift, the\r\nwaifs and strays of a far-reaching tempest. This is not the place to\r\nreview the measures adopted to meet the dread visitation; if not free from\r\nerrors, inevitable in a situation of the kind, they were, essentially,\r\nand, in the main, successful. Peel was still in office in 1845; well\r\nknowing what poverty in Ireland was, he introduced supplies of food into\r\nthe remote and backward districts, which the energies of commerce could\r\nhardly reach; this wise policy saved tens of thousands of lives; as is\r\nnotorious, he repealed the corn laws in the interest of the afflicted\r\ncountry. The Government of Lord John Russell had succeeded him in 1846; it\r\nhad to confront an emergency infinitely worse; it followed, in many\r\nrespects, the example of Peel, who had established 'relief works' in many\r\ncounties; but it did not assist the most impoverished parts of Ireland\r\nwith food through the agency of the State; this possibly was a real\r\nmistake. Nevertheless, it manfully and humanely met the tremendous crisis;\r\nit is easy to censure some of its acts, for instance, the wasteful and\r\nuseless public works it set on foot, and the gigantic outdoor relief it\r\nwas compelled to lavish; but millions in starvation were thrown on its\r\nhands; and the poor law, only lately in operation, could not cope with\r\nuniversal distress. On the whole, the statesmen in power did their duty\r\nwisely and well; thousands of unhappy victims succumbed, indeed, to\r\nfamine, and to dire diseases following in its train; but Ireland as a\r\npeople was saved; assuredly she could not have saved herself. A word, too,\r\nmust be said on the magnificent charity which flowed in from many lands\r\ninto the community in its woe. England had turned in sympathy towards\r\nIreland in the season of distress which had followed the Peace; she\r\nbestowed great sums on her, in 1845-46, through private subscription. The\r\nUnited States, France, Germany, and Italy joined in the good work; even\r\nthe Ottoman Empire was not behindhand.\r\n\r\nI must dwell for a moment on the conduct and the position of the classes\r\nconnected with the land during this appalling trial. The attitude of the\r\nlanded gentry was much the same as it had been at an infinitely less\r\ndisastrous crisis; but, on the whole, it was marked by nobler and more\r\nattractive features. The charity of the great landlords of Ireland was\r\nmost praiseworthy; many devoted large sums for the support of the poor on\r\ntheir lands by instituting fine works of enclosure and drainage; some, I\r\nknow, even mortgaged their estates for this very purpose. Hundreds of the\r\nlesser gentry, stricken down as they were, imitated their superiors as\r\nwell as they could; old divisions were forgotten in the common misfortune;\r\nspite of the interested lies of a calumnious faction, as an order of men\r\nthey acted extremely well. One of their bitterest enemies, who wrote at\r\nthe time, has placed it on record, 'that the resident landlords and their\r\nfamilies did, in many cases, devote themselves to the task of saving these\r\npoor people alive. Many remitted their rents or half their rents; and\r\nladies kept their servants busy and their kitchens smoking with continual\r\npreparation of food for the poor.'[47] Many, however, of the Irish\r\nlandlords, as was to be expected, looked hopelessly on at the misery\r\naround them; this was the case with feeble and incapable men, and the\r\nsight has always been seen in grave social crises; it was but in\r\nconformity with our frail and imperfect nature. A certain number,\r\nmoreover, of the class had recourse to severe measures to remove from\r\ntheir lands the masses of wretchedness crowded upon them; the process of\r\neviction became too frequent; hundreds of families were in this way\r\ndispossessed of their holdings. These acts of harshness were certainly to\r\nbe deplored; but it was almost universally believed that the cottar in\r\nIreland could not live from the land after the failure of almost his only\r\nmeans of subsistence; it must be added that, in this very matter, the\r\nconduct of Parliament and the Government was by many degrees more severe.\r\nA strict test of destitution had to be applied; a law was passed that, as\r\na condition of obtaining relief, no person possessing more than a quarter\r\nof an acre of land should be entitled to support from the State; thousands\r\nof families abandoned their homes, through the effects of this measure;\r\nfor one evicted by a landlord, fifty perhaps were practically evicted by\r\nthis stern policy. The law was possibly required in the terrible\r\ncircumstances of the time; but it was condemned by the Lord-Lieutenant,\r\nLord Bessborough, a great Irish peer, and an able man; at all events, it\r\njustified, to a considerable extent, all that could be laid to the charge\r\nof a few Irish landlords whose acts were most unfairly denounced by many\r\nwriters, and were falsely described as common to the great body of the\r\nclass. For the rest, as I have said, the land system was broken up in many\r\ndistricts; and not only the owners but the occupiers of the soil suffered\r\ncruelly from the highest to the lowest grade.\r\n\r\nAfter the first months of the famine, the immense exodus of the Irish\r\nrace, as it has fitly been called, began. The population fled from the\r\ncountry in hundreds of thousands; some found a home in England and in our\r\nAustralian colonies; nine-tenths, probably, in the great Republic of the\r\nWest. The sufferings of numbers of the emigrants were terribly severe;\r\nhuddled together in the ill-found vessels of the time, hundreds perished\r\nbefore they beheld the lands they were seeking; that some check was not\r\nplaced on the greed of the merchants, who subjected these victims to\r\nhorrors like those of the Middle Passage, was certainly the worst mistake\r\nof the Government of the day. During the agony of the famine there was\r\ncomparatively little crime; the minds of men were engrossed by a dire\r\ncalamity; but in a few months Whiteboyism had been again aroused; there\r\nwas a widespread outbreak of agrarian disorder followed by the abortive\r\nrising of 1848. The time was now ripe, in the judgment of even leading\r\nstatesmen, for making another of the great experiments on the Irish land,\r\nwhich had been their policy since the age of the Tudors. Many of the Irish\r\nlanded gentry had been ruined; the estates of many were heavily charged\r\nwith debt, in part caused by extravagance in the past, but chiefly by\r\nlarge provisions made for their families in more prosperous times,\r\nespecially during the period of the high prices of the war.[48] The\r\nobject of the Government--and Peel concurred--was to make a clean sweep of\r\nthe embarrassed owners, and to transfer their lands to a new order of men;\r\n'English and Scottish capital was to be attracted to the Irish soil;' the\r\nIrish landlord was to be 'sold out cheap;' his successor was to be a\r\nperson fit 'to discharge the duties of property;' the 'regeneration of\r\nIreland' was to be the magnificent result.[49] The sale of encumbered\r\nestates in Ireland had from various causes been a slow and a costly\r\nprocess, an Act was run through Parliament with scarcely an expression of\r\ndissent,[50] making the process as rapid and inexpensive as the wit of man\r\ncould devise; a Commission was appointed to carry the law into effect; and\r\nintending purchasers were to be given an indefeasible title to any lands\r\nthey might acquire. This was a strong measure, but it was not nearly all;\r\nthe concurrent rights of the tenants in the estates to be sold were\r\nabsolutely ignored, and left without protection; the new possessors were\r\nempowered to destroy them if they pleased. The results were such as might\r\nhave been looked for when lands were forced into the market wholesale,\r\nwhen Ireland was still reeling from the strokes of a terrible famine, and\r\nagricultural ruin was seen everywhere. The Commission acted as such\r\ntribunals invariably act when skilfully selected to carry out a policy; it\r\naddressed itself to its task of 'selling land cheap;' it was egged on by\r\nthe Lord-Lieutenant of the day; and it sacrificed estates, in scores of\r\ninstances, at less than half their value. This iniquitous proceeding went\r\non for years, until the market for land in Ireland righted itself at last;\r\nbut the Encumbered Estates Act was often renewed; about a sixth part of\r\nthe lands of Ireland has been transferred by these means. As the result\r\nmany of the Irish gentry, who might have tided over the crisis, were\r\nbeggared and cast on the world penniless; and confiscation from above had\r\nits counterpart in confiscation from below; the partial joint-ownership of\r\nthousands of the occupiers of the soil was ruthlessly annihilated in\r\nnumbers of cases. And what were the consequences of this scheme of\r\nspoliation and wrong, which English politicians would never have thought\r\nof but for their traditional contempt of the rights of property in land in\r\nIreland? English and Scottish capital, indeed, reached the Irish soil; but\r\nit reached it in the form of large mortgages, a heavy drain on the\r\ncountry's resources; the English and Scottish purchasers of the Irish land\r\nwere a mere handful of men. The estates, in fact, transferred under the\r\nEncumbered Estates Acts, as a rule, passed into the ownership of jobbers,\r\nspeculators, and mortgagees, people without the associations old\r\npossession ensures; they have formed, as a class, harsh and exacting\r\nlandlords, the true successors of the almost defunct middleman; they are\r\nresponsible for much that is bad in Irish landed relations of late years.\r\nA huge confiscation, in a word, failed, as those of Elizabeth and Cromwell\r\nfailed before; the fact ought to be a warning to public men, who have been\r\nparading theories about the Irish land--strewn as this has been with\r\nmonuments of misdeeds and errors--as false and more dangerous than those\r\nwhich produced the Encumbered Estates Acts.[51]\r\n\r\nThe exodus had, by 1851, reduced the population of Ireland by nearly two\r\nmillions of souls; this decline has continued ever since; the population\r\nwhich, in 1846, was considerably more than eight millions, is now, we\r\nhave seen, only about four and a half millions. In 1852 an agitation\r\nsprang up, which might have wrought a great change in Irish landed\r\nrelations, had it not been brought by mere accident to an untimely end.\r\nThe Report of the Devon Commission, I have said, had troubled Ulster; the\r\nFamine had driven peasants, in tens of thousands, from their homes; the\r\noperation of the Encumbered Estates Act was destroying their concurrent\r\nrights in their holdings. At the General Election of 1852 Ireland returned\r\na large party of representatives to the House of Commons pledged to\r\nvindicate the claims of the tenant farmers; these were expressed in a\r\ndemand that has been called the 'Three F's,' 'Fair Rent,' 'Fixity of\r\nTenure,' and 'Free Sale,' a mode of occupation which had been largely\r\nsecured by the Custom of Ulster, and to which O'Connell had given his\r\nsanction. The Government of Lord Derby was now in office; it had brought\r\nin measures which, in some degree, would have legalised the rights of the\r\nIrish tenant; but the Ministry was defeated, partly through an\r\nintrigue;[52] the cause of the Irish farmer was baffled and kept in\r\nsuspense for years, largely owing to dissensions and treachery on the part\r\nof some of the Irish members. By this time the country had begun to\r\nrevive, and to throw off the worst effects of the Famine; vast depopulated\r\ntracts had been opened to new husbandry; the land had been set free, over\r\nan immense area, from the incubus of a mass of wretchedness which had\r\npreyed on it, and had completely disorganised the land system, unnaturally\r\nforcing up rent and cutting down wages. Under these conditions the\r\nstatesmen in power, already expecting great things from the Encumbered\r\nEstates Act, believed that the Irish land system would right itself, and\r\nthat it was unnecessary to consider or to protect the rights of the\r\ntenant classes; these would either disappear, or would be fairly adjusted\r\nin the improved landed relations that were being formed. At all events,\r\nthere was no legislation to secure these claims; the scanty legislation,\r\nthat dealt with the Irish land, was unfavourable, in many ways, to these,\r\nand endeavoured to assimilate Irish to English tenures, as Tudor lawyers\r\nhad done three centuries before; and Lord Palmerston, for a long time the\r\nhead of the State, discouraged Irish tenant right, in more than one\r\nspeech, and declared that it only meant landlord wrong, unwise utterances\r\nthat showed he did not understand the subject. At the same time, the\r\npolicy of clearing the land for cultivators of a capitalist class, able to\r\noccupy and do justice to large farms, was generally advocated in high\r\nplaces; more than one Lord-Lieutenant announced that nature had made\r\nIreland a great grazing tract, and that her petty occupiers were little\r\nbetter than a social nuisance.[53]\r\n\r\nFor some time it seemed as though the forecasts made by the great majority\r\nof our statesmen would prove correct. The immense emigration from Ireland\r\nto the United States had important results, unfortunate in many respects;\r\nbut the uplifting of redundant millions from the soil greatly contributed\r\nto the country's welfare. Holdings were consolidated over very large\r\nareas, a beneficent process, if humanely carried out; a certain number of\r\nEnglishmen and Scotsmen rented large farms; the progress of husbandry of\r\nall kinds was distinct; a vast field for agriculture, really worthy of the\r\nname, was opened. A new standard for the management of land was, in fact,\r\nset up; at the same time a few purchasers, under the Encumbered Estates\r\nActs, laid out considerable sums in improving their estates; the Treasury\r\nmade large advances to many Irish landlords; these did much in works of\r\nenclosure, draining, planting, and the like. Ireland began to wear a new\r\naspect in several counties, especially in the more thriving parts of the\r\nsouthern provinces; the ruins made by the Famine, indeed, caused hideous\r\neyesores, in wrecks of villages and the remains of peasant dwellings; but\r\nthe mud hovels of the cottar population had largely disappeared, and the\r\nhabitations of farmers of the better class very markedly improved. The\r\neconomic conditions of landed relations became more conducive to\r\nprosperity than they had ever been before; rents fell considerably during\r\na series of years, as the intense competition for land diminished; though\r\nthey gradually rose in the course of time, they never reached the\r\nexcessive rates of 1840-45; and the wages of labour greatly increased, and\r\nattained a level that, happily, has since been preserved. Many\r\ncircumstances concurred to quicken and augment this unquestionable social\r\nand material progress. Agricultural prices were high from about 1852\r\nonward; Free Trade was as yet adding to the wealth of Ireland; and there\r\nwas a long succession of good harvests, the most important element in her\r\ngeneral welfare. The railway system, too, introduced of late years, opened\r\na number of new markets to her products, and greatly facilitated their\r\naccess to British markets. At the same time the turnip replaced the potato\r\nover hundreds of thousands of acres; farm machinery greatly improved in\r\nIreland; the importation of the best stock from England and Scotland had\r\nexcellent results, and almost transformed the old breeds of Irish farming\r\nanimals. An era of prosperity, in a word, had seemed to dawn on Ireland;\r\nand though agrarian disorder had not disappeared, the Whiteboy secret\r\nsocieties were greatly broken up, and political agitation well-nigh\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, it was a common belief in England that 'the Irish\r\ndifficulty,' as it was called, was passing away, and that the 'Hibernia\r\nPacata' had at last become a happy reality. Yet the progress and\r\ntranquillity of this brief period were largely superficial and even\r\ndeceptive; fires were still alive beneath the smouldering ashes. The\r\npartial prosperity of Ireland mainly depended on good harvests and high\r\nprices; it was interrupted, even in these years, by two or three seasons\r\nof distress. Notwithstanding the widespread consolidation of farms, and\r\nthe removal from the soil of indigent millions, the land still, for the\r\nmost part, remained in the possession of a mere peasantry; very few of the\r\nEnglish and Scottish capitalist farmers settled in Ireland, and really\r\nthrove; the great majority left the country, like the 'Englishry' of a\r\nbygone age. And though things wore a serene aspect, the inherent vices of\r\nthe land system continued to exist; in some respects they increased, or\r\nwere more painfully felt. The old divisions of race and faith between the\r\nowners and the occupiers of the soil remained; they had but little changed\r\nand even had perhaps widened; much had happened to keep the landed classes\r\nmore apart than before. The new purchasers, under the Encumbered Estates\r\nActs, were, we have seen, often hard-fisted and grasping landlords; they\r\nraised their rents, without scruple, in too many instances; standing on\r\nthe letter of the law, they too often ignored the partial joint-ownership\r\nin their farms of their tenants; they had sometimes recourse to unjust and\r\nsevere evictions. The old landlords, too, never recovered from the effects\r\nof the Famine; they were overshadowed by the bureaucracy of the Castle,\r\nwhich, for many years, had been growing in power; they thus became an\r\norder of men with privileges, but without authority, in the midst of\r\ninferiors, who had little sympathy with them, a dangerous position like\r\nthat of the French seigneurie in the later years of the eighteenth\r\ncentury--a position described by Tocqueville in very striking language. At\r\nthe same time the peasantry stood aloof from them more than in the days of\r\ntheir fathers; and though they remained quiescent for years, as has often\r\nhappened in Irish history, there were causes for this increasing\r\nestrangement. They were no longer the grossly ignorant multitude of fifty\r\nyears before; education had made some way among them, though in this\r\nrespect they were still backward; they felt more acutely all that was hard\r\nin their lot, like the French peasantry before the great Revolution of\r\n1789-94. This sentiment, however, owed its principal force to sentiments\r\nengendered in far distant lands. The thousands of the exodus had left\r\ntheir country with memories embittered against some Irish landlords, and,\r\nnotably, against the British Government; a new Ireland was rising across\r\nthe Atlantic; the emigrants and their sons were in constant communication\r\nwith the old Ireland once their home; socialistic ideas as regards the\r\nland, blending with dislike of the superiors and the rulers, under whom\r\nthey lived, were gradually diffused among the Irish peasantry. The\r\neconomic conditions, too, of landed relations by degrees made these\r\nfeelings more general and intense. Rents were rising as the wealth of the\r\ncountry increased, though, except in the cases of the new landlords, and\r\nof a very few surviving middlemen, they were, as a rule, by no means\r\nexcessive. Simultaneously a concurrence of causes had extinguished\r\nleasehold tenures in most parts of Ireland, and had reduced the status of\r\nthe Irish farmer to that of a mere tenant at will, liable to be\r\ndispossessed by a notice to quit, at the mercy, in fact, of the lord of\r\nthe soil. And, meanwhile, the equitable rights of the occupiers as a\r\nclass, due to improvements, and to sums paid for the goodwill of farms,\r\nhad been increasing to an immense extent; and yet a grievous wrong--they\r\nwere not even recognised by law. Law and fact had long been sharply\r\nclashing in landed relations; there was much that was essentially bad in\r\nthe land system; and agrarian trouble and crime was on the increase.\r\n\r\nThe mind of England had turned away from Ireland after the petty outbreak\r\nof 1848; it charged the Irish community with ungrateful folly, as it\r\nrecollected the charity lavished during the Famine. This sentiment was\r\nreplaced by what was worse, indifference; throughout this period--from\r\n1850 to 1868--Parliament gave little attention to the affairs of Ireland.\r\nBritish statesmen continued to pin their faith to their policy; they\r\ndisregarded ominous symptoms on the increase; Ireland was rapidly becoming\r\nmore prosperous; the claims of the Irish tenant farmer were a delusion, or\r\nworse. This apathy was augmented by the state of the representation of\r\nIreland in these years; this was in a feeble, even a degraded condition;\r\nand largely owing to the authority of Cardinal Cullen, who prohibited the\r\nIrish priesthood from taking any part in politics, agitation, I have said,\r\nhad become a mere tradition of the past. Yet the causes I have glanced at\r\nwere silently at work, which ultimately were to lead to grave social\r\ntroubles. The first sign of disturbance was seen in a little outbreak, the\r\nresult of a conspiracy hatched by one of the rebels of 1848, and supported\r\nto some extent from America: but the 'Phoenix plot,' as it was called,\r\nalmost at once collapsed; the Government thought it hardly worthy of\r\nnotice. Another and much more formidable conspiracy was matured in\r\n1864-65; and though it was put down with little difficulty in time, it\r\nshowed that there was much that was peccant in the state of Ireland; and\r\nit deeply affected the minds of Englishmen, aroused as it were out of a\r\nfool's paradise. The millions of the Irish race in the Far West were\r\npassionately appealed to by leaders, not without parts, to assist in a\r\ncrusade against 'landlordism,' and British rule in Ireland; they gave the\r\nmovement very general support; they found numerous allies in thousands of\r\nIrishmen disbanded after the great conflict between the North and the\r\nSouth. The Fenian conspiracy was launched on its course; its directors\r\nmade skilful attempts to debauch whole regiments, and to stir up the\r\npassions of the mob in many of the towns of Ireland; and they especially\r\nturned their attention to the mass of the peasantry. Here, however, their\r\npolicy was injudicious and ill-conceived; they promised the Irish land as\r\na spoil to those who would join the ranks of the 'patriot Irish army;' but\r\nall this alarmed the occupiers of the soil, whose only object was to\r\nacquire a better mode of tenure for their farms, and who rightly thought\r\nthe Fenian movement made their possessions insecure, a belief generally\r\nencouraged by the Catholic priesthood. A short-lived rising, conducted by\r\na few American soldiers, and backed by the rabble of a few villages and\r\ntowns, found no real support in Ireland, and was finally quelled in 1867;\r\nbut in England there was a spurt of Fenian disorder, and this, though\r\neasily quenched, made a profound impression. It was generally felt in\r\nEngland and Scotland that, notwithstanding the optimism of a generation of\r\npublic men, there was still much that was rotten in the state of Ireland,\r\nand that this should be removed by large and searching reforms. The chief\r\nsign of this change in British opinion was seen in the result of the\r\nGeneral Election of 1868; Mr. Gladstone, who, hitherto, had taken\r\ncomparatively little part in Irish affairs, but who, with his keen\r\ninstinct of every turn in the public mind, had been vehemently enlarging\r\non the wrongs of Ireland, was placed in power with a great majority, and\r\nat once addressed himself to the task of Irish reform.[54]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE IRISH LAND (_continued_)--THE IRISH LAND ACT OF\r\n1870--THE LAND LEAGUE AND THE NATIONAL LEAGUE--THE LAND OF\r\n1881--SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION AS REGARDS THE LAND SYSTEM OF IRELAND\r\n\r\n    State of landed relations in Ireland in 1869-70--Mr. Gladstone Prime\r\n    Minister--The Land Act of 1870--Its merits and defects--A short period\r\n    of prosperity in Ireland--Ominous symptoms--Michael Davitt--The\r\n    teaching of John Finton Lalor in 1848--The 'New Departure' in\r\n    Fenianism arranged in America--Foundation of the Land League--It was a\r\n    foreign rebellious conspiracy, with an agrarian side, under a\r\n    constitutional mask--Parnell the master spirit of the League--His\r\n    visit to America and the results--A short period of distress in\r\n    Ireland--Conduct of the Irish landlords--Progress of the Land\r\n    League--Mr. Gladstone again Prime Minister in 1880--The Compensation\r\n    for Disturbance Bill rejected by the House of Lords--Outburst of\r\n    agrarian crime, as the Land League increases in power--Rents at\r\n    Griffith's valuation--Boycotting--Frightful state of Ireland in\r\n    1881--After a short attempt to repress it, Mr. Gladstone surrenders to\r\n    the Land League--The Land Act of 1881--Mr. Gladstone breaks the\r\n    pledges he had made in 1870--His promise of compensating the Irish\r\n    landlords--The Land Act of 1881 a bad and unjust measure directly\r\n    inconsistent with that of 1870--The 'No Rent Manifesto'--The\r\n    Kilmainham Treaty--The Phoenix Park tragedy--Coercion--Parnell\r\n    founds the National League, the successor of the Land League--Renewal\r\n    of agitation in 1886--Struggle with law and the Government--Subsequent\r\n    agrarian legislation for Ireland--This is really a concession to\r\n    agitation, for the benefit of Irish tenants, and to the injury of\r\n    Irish landlords.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, after his conversion to Home Rule, more than once declared\r\nthat, almost from early manhood he had given special attention to\r\nIreland; either his memory was at fault, or he had kept the fact to\r\nhimself. He had been a conspicuous figure in politics, for many years\r\nbefore 1868; but until he had been placed at the helm of the State, he had\r\nshown little acquaintance with Irish questions, and, indeed, had expressed\r\nfew opinions on them. In 1866 he had said in the House of Commons, that\r\nthe existence of the Anglican Irish Church would be probably long; he had\r\nbeen in high office almost since 1853, and, as a colleague of Lord\r\nPalmerston, had acquiesced in the philippics of that statesman against\r\nIrish tenant right, conduct that revealed ignorance of the land system of\r\nIreland. But, in 1868, when the Fenian outbreak had caused the nation to\r\ndemand large reforms in Ireland, he suddenly abandoned his attitude of\r\nreserve; he threw himself into Irish affairs; his zeal, it may be\r\nremarked, as often happened, fell in with his interests, and with those of\r\nthe Liberal party, and gave him a leverage to drive Disraeli from office.\r\nDuring months before the General Election that ensued, the orator\r\nthundered on Irish grievances, and on the manifold ills of Ireland; in\r\nfigurative and impassioned language, he said that the island was blighted\r\nby a huge upas tree, the Church, the land, and education being the three\r\nmain branches. These harangues, addressed to the new democracy,\r\ncontributed powerfully to the fall of the Conservative Ministry; it was\r\nlittle noticed, at the time, that one of the results was ere long to\r\ncompel Mr. Gladstone himself to subject Ireland to severe repressive\r\nmeasures, for Whiteboy and agrarian outrages became frequent In 1869, the\r\nMinister addressed himself to the task of hewing down the first branch of\r\nthe poisonous upas; he disestablished and disendowed the Protestant Church\r\nof Ireland. This is not the place to comment upon that great measure; it\r\nwas well designed upon its professed principles; it dealt liberally, nay,\r\ngenerously, with the voluntary Church, which replaced the Church of the\r\nState it overthrew. But essentially it was a scheme of destruction, formed\r\nin Nonconformist not in Irish interests, and opposed to the views of\r\ngenerations of statesmen; it made no provision for the clergy of the Irish\r\nCatholic Church, a policy which Pitt, Castlereagh, and Lord John Russell\r\nhad had at heart, which had been all but a condition of the Union, and\r\nwhich, if carried into effect, would have done much to strengthen and\r\nmaintain that fundamental law, and to promote tranquillity in Ireland and\r\nher general welfare.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone now turned to the second branch of the upas, the land system\r\nof Ireland and her landed relations. His whole career, especially in its\r\nHome Rule phase, proves that his knowledge of Ireland was not exact or\r\nprofound; at this time he had had little experience of the Irish land\r\nquestion. But the mind of England was still attracted to Irish affairs; a\r\nnumber of distinguished Englishmen and Scotchmen went to Ireland, to\r\ninvestigate the state of the country on the spot; the British Press sent\r\nsome of its best contributors; the time was singularly opportune for a\r\nfair and complete inquiry; no Minister has had, before or since, such\r\nassistance in dealing with Irish problems. I must glance at the state of\r\nthe Irish land system in 1869-70, as this was fully explored and made\r\nmanifest.[55] The material progress being made, since about 1854, had\r\nbeen largely developed in by far the greatest part of the island. The\r\npopulation was being still diminished by emigration and other causes; the\r\narea for real husbandry had been greatly extended; the rural community, at\r\nleast in its lower grades, was infinitely better off than it had been\r\nbefore the Famine. The look of the country, in most places, bore witness\r\nto a change beneficent in the main; it had been almost transformed since\r\n1844-45. The cottar system, no doubt, was to be found in backward\r\ncounties; but even in these it had been largely effaced; it was all but\r\npassing away in the more thriving counties; masses of indigence were to be\r\nseen only in tracts west of the Shannon; and these were aggregated on an\r\narea comparatively small. The general consolidation of farms had,\r\nmeanwhile, gone on; and though Ireland remained, on the whole, a land of\r\nsmall farms, her land system had, from top to bottom, ceased to depend for\r\nits support on a perishable root. In every conceivable respect a marked\r\nimprovement was visible in the state of the peasantry; they were by many\r\ndegrees better clothed and fed than their fathers had been; the wages of\r\nagricultural labour were still rising, and were now paid in money, and not\r\nin plots of potatoes; and though the habitations of this whole class were,\r\nas a rule, still mean, the dwellings of the class of substantial farmers\r\nhad shown signs of distinct social progress. At the same time agriculture\r\nhad made a marked advance, owing to the influences I have referred to\r\nbefore; fine specimens of extensive farming were very commonly to be seen;\r\nthousands of acres had been reclaimed and enclosed of late years; at no\r\nperiod certainly had the landed gentry, in a great measure through moneys\r\nborrowed from the State, expended such large sums in improving their\r\nestates, especially in arterial drainage, and the introduction of the\r\nbest breeds of stock of all kinds. The wealth of Ireland, too, was\r\nincreasing, if not rapidly; and a change for the better might be traced in\r\nwhat we may describe as her general social life. Her middle class was\r\nstill weak and small compared to that of England and Scotland; but it had\r\nbeen growing in wealth and power; and this, to some extent, had had a good\r\neffect on a community still mainly dependent on the land.\r\n\r\nThe material and even the social progress of Ireland, since the Famine,\r\nhad thus been marked; it had been more decided than it has been, at any\r\nperiod, except, possibly, that from 1782 to 1800. Her land system, too,\r\nhad become better in important parts; but in many respects it remained\r\nvicious; some of its vices had been aggravated, or were more sensibly\r\nfelt. The hope that the land would pass generally into the hands of large\r\nfarmers, able to develop its resources, had not been realised, or had been\r\nrealised only to a relatively trivial extent; it was still held in the\r\nmain by a peasantry of small occupiers of the soil, though the\r\nconsolidation of farms had gone on over extensive areas, especially over\r\nwide tracts of pasturage, in the eastern, midland, and western counties,\r\nand this, in some instances, through a process of harsh eviction. The\r\nprofound divisions of race and faith, the distinctive feature in the\r\norganic structure of the whole community, were at least as visible as ever\r\nin the land system; from causes I have pointed out before, they had, not\r\nimprobably, been widened; this tended to increase the old dissension in\r\nlanded relations, and the long-standing separation between the landed\r\nclasses. Middleman tenures, with their mischievous effects, had, since the\r\nFamine, well-nigh disappeared; but the new landlord had largely replaced\r\nthe middleman; absenteeism remained what it had been; and though absentee\r\nestates, as a rule, were under good agents, there was too much of that\r\n'absenteeism of the heart,' condemned by Tocqueville as a grave social\r\ndanger. The purchasers under the Encumbered Estates Acts, with some\r\nhonourable exceptions, no doubt, were too often oppressive landlords; the\r\nold landlords, as a class, had, certainly, done much for their estates,\r\nbut they had lost their political and largely their social influence;\r\npartly owing to apprehensions as regards tenant right, partly to the\r\nassurances of statesmen that their position was safe, they had become\r\nperhaps more exacting in their dealings with their dependents; in the\r\nexisting situation, they more and more resembled a weak caste, controlled\r\nby the central Government, and isolated amidst a community, to a great\r\nextent, not friendly. All this tended to produce a want of stability and\r\ninsecurity in the land system, which was ominous of social strife and\r\ntrouble; but the most active element of disturbance was to be certainly\r\nfound in the contact with the rebellious movement which Ireland had lately\r\nwitnessed. Fenianism had been scotched, but by no means slain; and though\r\nthe peasantry had held aloof from it, Fenian emissaries were going through\r\nthe country, appealing to the passions and the greed of the occupiers of\r\nthe soil, for different reasons not contented with their lot, hostile, in\r\na great degree, to the order of things around them, and more alive to\r\ntheir grievances than in the past generation; at this very time a cry\r\nagainst the payment of rent, and against 'landlordism,' as it was called,\r\nwas being heard in a few counties. It was significant that agrarian\r\ncrimes--some of the worst type--and agrarian disorder were distinctly\r\nincreasing; and it should be added, that, in spite of Cardinal Cullen, the\r\nyounger Catholic priests, in some districts, were beginning to play the\r\npart of agitators again.\r\n\r\nPassing from the general state of landed relations, the conditions of land\r\ntenure, briefly noticed before, had not improved of late years, and were,\r\nin some respects, worse. Rents had been rising for a considerable time:\r\nbut except in comparatively few instances, they were not excessive, as\r\naffairs stood; whatever mendacious calumny has since maintained, Ireland,\r\non the whole, was in no sense an over-rented land.[56] But the modes of\r\noccupation were essentially bad; they were open to the gravest objections;\r\ntheir vices had become more than ever apparent. The tenant right, under\r\nthe Ulster custom, had, I have remarked, largely secured the tenant\r\nfarmer, in parts of the province, what was generally known as the 'Three\r\nF's,' Fair Rent, Fixity of Tenure, the power of a Free Sale of the\r\nholding;[57] though it should be especially borne in mind that the fair\r\nrent was never adjusted by an external agency, but was settled by what\r\nAdam Smith would have called 'higgling' between the owner and occupier of\r\nthe soil. The custom, however, had been very powerful; its violation, on\r\nanything like a great scale, would have certainly caused a fierce war of\r\nclasses; and it gave the Ulster tenant, in tens of thousands of cases, a\r\nreal proprietary right in the land, whatever might be the terms of his\r\ncontract; a right equivalent to more or less joint-ownership, and that\r\nmight be described as a precious _peculium_, subject to conditions that\r\nlong had made it practically secure. But this most important right,\r\ninvolving property worth many millions, still remained wholly unprotected\r\nby law; and though its value had enormously increased, as the wealth of\r\nUlster had been developed, of late years, it was being 'nibbled away' on\r\nnot a few estates, and restricted by limitations of many kinds that had\r\ngreatly impaired it. An analogous right, like seed scattered by the\r\nwinds, had partially spread into the southern provinces, as the natural\r\nresult of the equitable claims, the occupiers of farms had repeatedly\r\nacquired, though this had not been recognised on many estates, and its\r\nefficacy was not as yet great; but this right, such as it was, like its\r\nfellow, was not law-worthy, and depended wholly on the will of the lord of\r\nthe soil. In addition to the tenant right in the north and the south, the\r\nconcurrent claims of the tenant farmers, throughout the country, in\r\nrespect of improvements and of sums paid on the transfer of farms, for\r\n'good-will,' had been greatly increasing of late years, especially as\r\nprosperity was advancing; and yet tenures had continued to become more\r\nprecarious; leaseholds were being almost everywhere replaced by tenancies\r\nat will. These claims were never so extensive before; often equivalent to\r\njoint-ownership, in no doubtful sense, and, in almost all cases, of some\r\nvalue, they were, nevertheless, still outside the aegis of the law, a fact\r\nthat must ever be borne in mind; they could be destroyed or greatly\r\nreduced by the raising of rent, they could be annihilated by a notice to\r\nquit, if eviction followed. Unquestionably in the great mass of instances,\r\nthese rights, whatever their nature, were not invaded; but they certainly\r\nhad been in a certain number; a single case of invasion created alarm and\r\ndistrust, and had a bad effect on landed relations; throw a stone into a\r\npond, and it makes a ripple; it has a disturbing influence far beyond the\r\nsurface it strikes. No wonder, then, that complaints of these modes of\r\ntenure had become very general, and were loudly expressed, not only by\r\nthose who might suffer from them, but by intelligent minds which had\r\nmastered the subject. It was an exaggeration to assert, as was said at the\r\ntime, that the peasant in Ireland lived under a sword of Damocles; but he\r\nlived under a system in which law and right were very plainly opposed.\r\n\r\nOnly a revolution, which Parliament would not have sanctioned, could have\r\neffaced the inveterate ills of the Irish land system, running up to the\r\nconquests and the confiscations of the past, and the divisions of race and\r\nfaith in the Irish land; the remark is as true now as it was thirty years\r\nago; and a revolution of the kind, I am firmly convinced, would, even\r\nunder the best conditions, make infinitely worse whatever was already bad.\r\nBut it was possible for legislation to remove or mitigate the essential\r\nvices in the modes of Irish land tenure; Mr. Gladstone rightly confined\r\nhimself to this object. He brought in his first Irish Land Bill in the\r\nearly spring of 1870; he had to address a House of Commons not much in\r\nsympathy with a project of the kind. Many of the members were ignorant of\r\nthe subject; many thought English land tenure perfect, and could not\r\nunderstand why it would not do for Ireland, a prejudice at least three\r\ncenturies old; some believed Irish tenant right to be a violation of Free\r\nTrade, then in the ascendant in every phase of commerce. The Minister's\r\nspeech was adapted to those who heard it; it was tentative, moderate, not\r\nstriking; he drew, indeed, very plain distinctions between British and\r\nIrish land tenure, and showed how the first could be no rule of right for\r\nthe second; but if he enlarged on the just claims of the occupier of the\r\nIrish soil, he did not venture to maintain, what he probably felt, that\r\nthese were often equivalent to a joint-ownership more or less developed.\r\nHe was, in short, dexterous, but not profound; very inferior to Burke,\r\nwho, a century before, had grasped the essential facts in this province,\r\nthough the question was still in the remote future. The most important\r\nparts of Mr. Gladstone's speech, and indeed, of those of his leading\r\nfollowers, regard being had to events by no means distant, were those in\r\nwhich he repudiated, with no doubtful censure, the whole theory of the\r\n'Three F's,' the extreme demand, at this time, of the tenant class in\r\nIreland. 'Fair Rent' he argued, especially if adjusted by the State,\r\ndeprives a landlord of his first proprietary right, and involves his\r\nexpropriation in the long run; 'Fixity of Tenure' means a perpetuity for\r\nthe tenant, to which he has no just claim, and involves confiscation\r\nhardly disguised; 'Free Sale' was but a corollary to legislation on these\r\nprinciples.[58] At the same time, Mr. Gladstone protested, with marked\r\nemphasis, that the Bill he was introducing was to be absolutely a final\r\nmeasure; it was to effect a permanent settlement of the Irish land; Irish\r\nlandlords would have nothing more to apprehend, Irish tenants to expect.\r\nIn this instance, as in that of Home Rule, the orator was to belie\r\nhimself, and to be a curious example of the irony of Fate; within a few\r\nyears he was to legislate on the lines he had denounced as dangerous and\r\nfalse; to carry into effect a scheme for dealing with the Irish land,\r\ninfinitely worse than that of the 'Three F's;' to scatter the 'finality,'\r\nto which he had pledged his word, to the winds.\r\n\r\nThe Bill thus launched was a comprehensive and wise measure, if not free\r\nfrom real, even grave, defects; it remains the only statesmanlike scheme\r\nfor the settlement of Irish landed relations that hitherto has received\r\nthe assent of Parliament.[59] It made the tenant right of Ulster, in its\r\nvarious forms, as these existed in different estates, law-worthy, and\r\nprotected to the fullest extent; it gave the same sanction to the inchoate\r\ntenant right of the southern provinces. This was, in itself, an immense\r\nreform; but the Bill properly had a far wider sweep; it extended, with the\r\nexception of certain kinds of lands, such as demesnes, town parks,\r\nholdings of a residential type, and, in most cases, large pastoral\r\nholdings, to nearly all the occupiers of the Irish soil; even the excepted\r\nlands were partially within its scope. The first great object of the\r\nmeasure was to secure to the Irish tenant the rights he had acquired to\r\nimprovements he may have made on his farm, a right hitherto not within the\r\npale of the law; its provisions, in this respect, were, I think,\r\nexcellent. With a true perception of the unquestionable fact that, though\r\nthe Irish landlords, especially of late years, had expended considerable\r\nsums on their estates, still, as is inevitable under the small-farm\r\nsystem, the Irish tenant, as a general rule, had made the greatest part of\r\nthe additions to the land, Mr. Gladstone provided that, subject to\r\nlimitations by no means severe, in order that the law should not run wild,\r\nimprovements made on farms, in the absence of proof to the contrary,\r\nshould be deemed to be the tenant's property, thus reversing the\r\npresumption of English law, iniquitous when applied to Irish tenures, that\r\nwhat is annexed to the soil belongs to the owner, and not to its occupant.\r\nThe ground being, so to speak, cleared, the Bill declared that, in almost\r\nall cases, a tenant should have a right, when leaving his farm, even\r\nthough dispossessed for the failure to pay his rent, to claim\r\ncompensation, from his landlord, for his improvements; and facilities were\r\noffered to landlords to discharge these claims through loans from the\r\nState. In order, however, reasonably to secure right being done, in a\r\ncomplex and very difficult matter, the Bill proceeded to define\r\nimprovements, and to impose restrictions on claims, to which objection\r\ncould fairly be made. Apart from unexhausted tillages and manures, an\r\nimprovement was to be a work 'suitable to a holding, and adding to its\r\nletting value,' a description as equitable and precise as could well be\r\ndesired. And, speaking generally, claims in respect of improvements were\r\nnot to be preferred were the improvement twenty years old, except in the\r\ncase of buildings and the reclamation of waste land; nor if the\r\nimprovement were prohibited by the landlord, under the conditions laid\r\ndown; nor if it were made under a contract for value; nor if it were\r\nforbidden by a special contract; nor if, in certain cases, the landlord\r\nhad agreed to make it; nor if the claim was barred by express written\r\ncontract, in the case of improvements made before the Bill became law;\r\nnor, in the case, with some exceptions, of certain classes of leases; nor\r\nif the landlord, under certain conditions, permitted a tenant to dispose\r\nof his interest in his farm.\r\n\r\nThis measure, therefore, gave the Irish tenant farmer complete property in\r\nhis improvements, within reasonable bounds, and yet did not here invade\r\nthe just rights of the landlord; it was only to be regretted that it had\r\nnot been proposed many years before. It proceeded, however, a great deal\r\nfurther, and asserted a principle, for the behoof of the tenant, which has\r\nsince been very generally condemned,[60] though in my judgment, it was\r\nessentially right, if carried somewhat beyond proper and safe limits.\r\nExcept in the case of leases granted before the Bill, and of a class of\r\nleases granted when it was to become law, Mr. Gladstone engrafted on the\r\ngreat mass of Irish tenancies what really was a new tenant right; he was\r\nprobably convinced, though he did not say so, that this was to be an\r\nequivalent for the joint-ownership, more or less manifest, which, in\r\ninnumerable instances, the Irish occupier had acquired in the soil. This\r\ntenant right was given the rather ambiguous name of 'Compensation,' in the\r\nevent of 'Disturbance;' a sum varying in amount from seven to one year's\r\nrent, according to the size of the holding, but in no case to exceed L250,\r\nwas to be paid to a tenant when dispossessed by a notice to quit, and, in\r\nsome circumstances, by other means; this was to be over and above any sum\r\ndue in respect of improvements; but this, too, as in the case of the\r\nlast-named sum, was to be paid only when the tenant was 'quitting' the\r\nland. Obviously this was a potential tenant right, if to be realised only\r\nin one way; it practically gave a quasi-proprietary right in the fee, as,\r\nwhen commenting on the Bill, I pointed out at the time; and I certainly\r\nthought that the compensation was very large, and introduced a principle\r\ninto the Bill which might be abused. Two other provisions of the measure,\r\nwith respect to the position of the Irish tenant, may be briefly noticed.\r\nNo attempt was made to adjust rents, through the agency of the State, Mr.\r\nGladstone having expressly denounced the idea; but in the case of petty\r\noccupiers, subjected to 'exorbitant rents,' compensation for disturbance\r\nmight be adjudged to them, even if evicted for not paying the rent, that\r\nis, the landlord might be mulcted in very heavy penalties. In nearly all\r\ninstances, too, the tenant was declared to be entitled to 'his away-going\r\ncrops,' another privilege, sometimes of no little value, and analogous to\r\nthat secured by usage in many parts of England. So far the Bill dealt with\r\nthe Irish land on the side of occupation; but it dealt with it, also, on\r\nthe side of ownership. John Bright had urged the expediency, during\r\nseveral years, of facilitating the transfer of the fee simple, in his\r\nholding, to the Irish tenant; this policy had been carried out, to some\r\nextent, by the Act disestablishing the Anglican Church in Ireland. The\r\nBill of 1870 extended the principle; it provided that the State might\r\nadvance moneys to Irish tenants, to enable them to become owners of their\r\nfarms; but--and this should especially be kept in mind--the tenant was to\r\nsupply a third part of the purchase money at least; and the transaction\r\nwas to be effected by free contract, that is, by the voluntary act of the\r\nlandlord disposing of his land. It remains to add, that the administration\r\nof the measure, was, for the most part--subject to an appeal to the\r\nSuperior Courts--entrusted to the County Courts of Ireland, that is, to\r\nlong-established tribunals of repute.\r\n\r\nThe Bill passed through both Houses with little change; it has long been\r\nknown as the Irish Land Act of 1870. It was, in the main, I repeat, a\r\ngreat reforming measure; it effected a far-reaching improvement in the\r\ntenure of land in Ireland, and that without any marked infringement of the\r\njust rights of property. No impartial mind can fairly object to the\r\nprotection given to the tenant right of the north and the south, or to the\r\ncompensation secured for tenants' improvements; if 'Compensation for\r\nDisturbance' was a bold experiment, still this Parliamentary tenant right,\r\nas it may be called, was in harmony with fact in nearly all instances.\r\nNevertheless, the Act had three marked defects; these largely detracted\r\nfrom its practical value. It bristled with such exceptions and limitations\r\nthat it was difficult even for the learned to understand; it seemed to the\r\nunlettered peasant a dangerous puzzle, involving him, perhaps, in lawsuits\r\nand costs; it did not strike his imagination as a substantial boon.\r\nThough, too, it annexed a real tenant right to nearly all farms, and thus\r\nsecured to the Irish tenant, in almost all cases, any joint-ownership he\r\nmay have acquired in the land, still this was intelligible only to\r\neducated men; 'Compensation for Disturbance' was to be given only when an\r\noccupier was about to leave his holding; but this was exactly what he\r\ncould not bear to do; he was, therefore, ready to accept almost any terms,\r\nrather than face consequences he dreaded to think of. Mr. Gladstone,\r\nagain, had, in this measure, shown that he wished to assimilate Irish to\r\nEnglish land tenure in the long run; he sought to vindicate the just\r\nclaims of the Irish tenant; but he desired ultimately to give him the\r\nstatus of his fellow in England, a long-standing, false conception of\r\nBritish statesmen. The Land Act, therefore, provided that most of the\r\nrights it conferred on the tenant might be commuted by the grant of a\r\nlease for thirty-one years or upwards; and it further enacted that tenants\r\nof the larger kind might 'contract themselves out' of the privileges it\r\ngave, by voluntary agreements made with their landlords. The object of\r\nthis was to place the Irish land, by degrees, no doubt, under rather long\r\nleases, discharged from the tenant right and other claims; but in the\r\ncircumstances of Ireland this was a mistake. This part of the Act was a\r\ntemptation to landlords, to persuade or even to force tenants to accept\r\nleases under conditions which might be too severe, with respect to rent\r\nand many other things, and to forego rights they would otherwise have\r\nenjoyed, by a process which might not be a free contract; it encouraged,\r\nin a word, unfair evasion of the law. This flaw in the measure was pointed\r\nout from the first; Mr. Gladstone, however, denied its existence, and\r\ncharacteristically shut his ears to other schemes of reform, notably to an\r\ningenious proposal of the late Judge Longfield to extend the Ulster tenant\r\nright to all Irish tenancies by a very simple and self-acting process, and\r\nto a proposal of Butt to convert tenancies at will into long leaseholds,\r\nat the rents then current. These projects certainly deserved attention;\r\nand, whatever their shortcomings, were easy to understand.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1870, like the Act dealing with the Protestant Church, was\r\nfollowed by a short-lived outbreak of agrarian crime put down only by\r\nsevere coercive measures. This phenomenon has been common in Irish\r\nhistory, from the days of Tyrconnell to the present time; disorder has\r\nbeen the immediate result of concessions; peccant humours discharge\r\nthemselves if you touch the head of an ulcer. There is some reason, too,\r\nto believe that in a few instances--and they were very few--wrongheaded\r\nlandlords, alarmed at the prospect before them, began to harass and even\r\nto dispossess tenants; they aimed at 'clearing' their estates, in order to\r\nevade the law; conduct of this kind naturally provoked indignation in some\r\nplaces.[61] Nevertheless, the Land Act of 1870 was generally well received\r\nin Ireland, though it fell short of the popular demand, and it was ill\r\nunderstood by the tenant classes;[62] many farmers availed themselves of\r\nits benefits, especially those holding under the Ulster custom. Five or\r\nsix years of prosperity followed, the brightest perhaps ever seen in\r\nIreland; agricultural prices were high, harvests extremely good; the\r\nmaterial progress of the country was decided; the peasantry seemed, as a\r\nrule, contented; agitation abandoned, as it were, the land, and\r\nconcentrated itself on the Home Rule movement. Mr. Gladstone, always\r\noptimistic, and proud of his own offspring, boasted, towards the close of\r\nhis first Ministry, that his recent legislation had done wonders; the Land\r\nAct had reconciled Irish landlords and tenants, and had greatly increased\r\nthe selling price of land; he refused to see how much of all this was due\r\nto a cause wholly independent of himself, the comparative well-being of\r\nnearly all Ireland. As had happened in the period from 1854 to 1870, this\r\ntranquillity was not deeply founded or complete; as then, it was, in a\r\ngreat degree, deceptive. The peasantry were living fast in a good time;\r\nbanks and traders had made large advances to them on the security of\r\ntenure the law had created; their position became such, in some districts,\r\nthat a season of distress might reduce many to sudden poverty, and be\r\nproductive of the necessarily resulting evils. Rents, again, were rising\r\nas the country grew in wealth, though except in comparatively few cases--a\r\nfact that should be steadily kept in view--they were still, as a rule, by\r\nno means excessive; they were far below the rents of thirty years before;\r\nbut this gradual rise was of course not popular. In some instances,\r\ntoo--but these were very rare, as was conclusively proved at a subsequent\r\ntime--tenants, under more or less pressure on the part of their landlords,\r\nhad accepted leases excluding them from the advantages of the law, and not\r\nequitable in some respects, or had wholly 'contracted themselves out' of\r\nthe Act; this naturally caused alarm and distrust in many peasant\r\ndwellings. But the principal reasons that content was really less than it\r\nseemed to be in landed relations were altogether of a different nature.\r\nLike too many even excellent reforms in Ireland, the Land Act of 1870\r\nbecame law too late; twenty years before it would have been hailed as an\r\nextraordinary boon; it was now regarded as almost a half measure, in view\r\nof the socialistic ideas about the land afloat. At the same time,\r\nFenianism continued to make its influence felt; Irish-Americans continued\r\nto flit through the country denouncing British rule and Irish landlords,\r\nand calling upon the peasantry, as in 1798, to rise. Even in these years\r\nof prosperity, though rents were well paid, there was a secret movement\r\nagainst rent beneath the surface of things, so well concealed that it was\r\nabsolutely unknown by the Government.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the midst of apparent peace, the elements of trouble in\r\nIreland still quiescent were to come to a head and to give rise to a\r\nmovement. The most formidable to British rule though skilfully masked,\r\nwhich had been seen since the rebellion of 1798. Revolutionary schemes in\r\nIreland have always fastened on the land as the chief source from which\r\nthey could derive strength; the United Irish movement as I have pointed\r\nout, was connected with a peasant movement against the payment of rent.\r\nThis idea had been brought into marked prominence by John Finton Lalor,\r\none of the rebels of 1848, a comparatively unknown but a sagacious man;\r\n'You must associate' he wrote, 'the cause of Irish liberty, for which the\r\npeople really care little with a cause for which they care a great deal;\r\nan inert mass must be yoked to a powerful engine; the Irish landlord must\r\nbe driven from the land and the peasant masses be made its owners; and the\r\nfall of English power will follow that of its landlord garrison.' These\r\nwords fell for the moment on unheeding ears; but the tradition has\r\ncontinued from that day to this the destruction of Irish 'landlordism' was\r\none of the objects of the Fenian leaders of 1865-67, and they denounced\r\nthe Irish gentry in atrocious language, though they did not know how to\r\ncarry out their policy. This teaching was eagerly adopted by Michael\r\nDavitt, a Fenian, who had been convicted of a crime against the State;\r\nduring a long imprisonment at Dartmoor, he brooded 'on his country's\r\nwrongs,' but satisfied himself that if the independence of Ireland was a\r\npatriot's first object, this could be attained only by uprooting the\r\nexisting land system, by hounding on the occupiers of the soil against its\r\nowners, and by handing it over as spoil to the peasantry. Davitt was\r\nreleased from Dartmoor at the close of 1877; he attended a meeting in\r\nDublin at which Parnell was present, and two of the assassins of the\r\nPhoenix Park tragedy; and he became supreme in the ranks of the Fenian\r\nsocieties, known as 'the Irish Republican Brotherhood,' which still\r\nretained a feeble life in Ireland, and even in England and Scotland. A\r\nshort time afterwards he made his way to the United States, where he found\r\nthe Fenians divided into two parties, known under the general name of the\r\nClan na Gael, but having different objects, though with a common purpose.\r\nBoth parties were for liberating Ireland 'from the Saxon yoke;' but the\r\nmost violent and the most active sought to attain this end by expedients\r\nof desperate force; a 'skirmishing fund' had been established; 'England\r\nwas to be invaded' by small bodies of 'resolute men;' her capital and\r\nchief towns were to be destroyed by dynamite. The other party, more\r\nprudent, but with similar aims, had been struck by Parnell's attitude in\r\nthe House of Commons, and by the success of his unscrupulous tactics; its\r\nleaders began to think that something might be done by 'constitutional\r\nmeans;' they gradually came to an agreement with Davitt, that 'the\r\noverthrow of English domination' was to be their ultimate end; but that\r\nefforts in this direction were to be linked with energetic efforts to\r\nsubvert 'the landlord system, a disgrace to humanity and to the\r\ncivilisation of the present century;' to banish the Irish landed gentry\r\nfrom their country, and to secure their estates for their tenantry. This\r\nmovement, though rebellious in no doubtful sense, was nevertheless to have\r\na legal disguise; the wolf was to wear sheep's clothing; the 'formation of\r\na peasant proprietary, and the abolition of arbitrary evictions,' were to\r\nbe its proposed objects.[63]\r\n\r\nTreason, seeking support from socialistic greed, was thus the origin of\r\nthe Land League conspiracy, for this was its only legitimate name. I have\r\nglanced at this movement, on its political side, as it was associated with\r\nthe cause of Home Rule; I must here consider it on its agrarian side, the\r\nmost prominent, if not the most dangerous, to the State.[64] The compact\r\nbetween Davitt and the moderates of the Clan na Gael was called the 'New\r\nDeparture;' Davitt returned to Ireland to stir up what became known as the\r\n'Land War;' Fenian emissaries went to Ireland, about the same time, in\r\norder to collect arms and to drill peasants, with a view to a possible\r\nrising should the occasion be found. Meanwhile, Davitt had addressed\r\nhimself to what was more immediately at hand; in the spring of 1879 he got\r\na meeting together, in his native county, Mayo, at which 'landlordism' and\r\nall its works were savagely denounced; during the following months other\r\nmeetings of the same sort were held, but as yet only in the western\r\nprovince of Connaught. At these gatherings the crusade against the landed\r\ngentry went on; rebellious utterances were blended with ferocious\r\ndiatribes against[65] landlords sometimes marked out for vengeance by\r\nname; and the peasantry were called on to keep 'a firm grip on their\r\nlands;' these would become their own should they only be steadfast. The\r\nLand League movement was now launched on its course; but it was known to\r\nbe an essentially Fenian movement; it was subsidised from Clan na Gael\r\nfunds; it was supported by a murderous Clan na Gael print; it was\r\ncondemned in the severest language by an aged Catholic prelate, one of the\r\nfew of O'Connell's surviving friends. The movement, however, as yet was\r\nnot of much strength; Davitt had opinions about the 'nationalisation of\r\nthe land,' which, like those of the Fenian leaders of 1865-67, were not to\r\nthe mind of the peasantry; his efforts, hitherto, had not had much\r\nsuccess. In this position of affairs he addressed himself to Parnell, who\r\nhad had Fenian sympathies and associations for years, and had, we have\r\nseen, attracted Fenian admiration abroad; what passed between the two men\r\nhas not transpired; but Parnell, if with reluctance, consented at last to\r\nbecome the head of the Land League and to direct the movement. The\r\nmeasures he adopted were skilfully designed, in harmony with the 'New\r\nDeparture,' and with the double-dealing nature of a true conspirator. A\r\nCentral Land League was established in Dublin; it was to have 'branches'\r\nextending through the country; it was to make a steady attack on the land\r\nsystem. Its professed objects, however, were constitutional, nay, fair; it\r\nwas 'to agitate against rack-rents and unjust evictions,' and to\r\n'facilitate the ownership of the soil by its occupants.' The ultimate\r\npurpose of the League, nevertheless, was that of the Fenian chiefs; of its\r\nseven high officers four were Fenians; it was wholly supported by Fenian\r\nmoneys; its most prominent members made a boast of their Fenian\r\nsentiments.[66] It was, in a word, a rebellious organisation in a\r\nconstitutional garb; it was the embodiment of what Parnell avowed\r\nafterwards: 'A true revolutionary movement in Ireland should, in my\r\nopinion, partake both of a constitutional and an illegal character. It\r\nshould be both an open and a secret organisation, using the Constitution\r\nfor its own purposes, but also taking advantage of its secret\r\ncombination.'[67]\r\n\r\nThe Land League established, under these auspices, gradually made some\r\nprogress in the western parts of Ireland, always centres of poverty more\r\nor less developed. It had not, however, as yet, become a power in the\r\nland; Parnell went to the United States, as I have mentioned before, in\r\norder to obtain support for the 'New Departure.' He was the grandson of a\r\ndistinguished American; the elections for a President were near; it was\r\nnecessary to bid for the Irish vote; the chief of the League was invited\r\nto say what his Irish policy was in the Representative House of the\r\npeople; and this he did in moderate and carefully chosen language. His\r\nreal attitude, however, was very different; he associated with well-known\r\nFenian leaders, became acquainted with a contributor to the _Irish World_,\r\nthe worst journal of the Clan na Gael press; and more than once gave\r\nutterance to what was plain treason, notably to the 'last-link' speech\r\nalready referred to. He obtained considerable funds for the League in\r\nIreland, and before long founded a similar League in America, which became\r\na Fenian organisation of the very worst type. Meanwhile a season of\r\ndistress had visited Ireland; this quickened the elements of disorder\r\nbeing already let loose. The harvest of 1878 was not good; that of 1879\r\nwas the worst known since the Great Famine; the prosperity of the country\r\nsuddenly came to an end. There was a universal calling in of demands,\r\nespecially from tenant farmers, who, I have said, had been rather\r\nextravagant, and had become involved in debt;[68] the whole class suffered\r\nmore or less, though there was very little extreme indigence, and Lord\r\nBeaconsfield's Government was not slow in providing relief, which private\r\ncharity largely increased. In these circumstances the landed gentry acted\r\nas any class would naturally act; a considerable number made remissions of\r\nrent; if a large majority, as certainly was the case, insisted upon their\r\nlegal rights--conduct which must be pronounced unfortunate--it must be\r\nrecollected that an agitation of extreme violence had been directed\r\nagainst the whole order; and that Mr. Gladstone had declared that, after\r\nthe Land Act, there were to be no more concessions. The League now\r\nacquired new power; its branches spread over large parts of the west; its\r\ndirectors, from members in the House of Commons, to its avowed agents, and\r\nto the 'village ruffians,' who carried out its bidding in many places,\r\nrioted in atrocious threats against landlords whether good or bad; and a\r\nmovement against the payment of rent began. The teaching which had been\r\nspread abroad during many months, bore the fruits which were to be\r\nexpected from it; there was a sudden outbreak of agrarian crime, and of\r\nWhiteboyism in its worst aspect; it deserves special notice that this was\r\nconfined to the counties where the League was in real force. The\r\nlandlords, under these conditions, were often driven to enforce their\r\nclaims; attempts were made to show that the evictions that followed were\r\nthe sole causes of this social disorder. But it is absolutely certain that\r\nthis was not the case; it was the Land League which provoked the\r\nevictions, and was responsible for the incidental crime.[69]\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1880 had come; Lord Beaconsfield had been driven from\r\noffice, in an evil day for the renown of England; Mr. Gladstone had been\r\nreturned again to power, on the flood of a tide of democratic sympathy.\r\nLord Beaconsfield was not an author of any very large Irish reform, but he\r\nunderstood Ireland much better than his impetuous rival; he had seen from\r\nthe first the real nature of the Land League movement; in his address to\r\nthe nation, when he dissolved Parliament, he declared that an 'attempt\r\nscarcely less dangerous than famine and pestilence' was being made to\r\nseparate Ireland from Great Britain, words treated by Mr. Gladstone with\r\nscornful ridicule, but words of real truth. The incoming Minister had of\r\nlate taken little heed of Irish affairs; he had been engaged in his\r\ncrusade in Midlothian, and in stirring up the multitude on the Eastern\r\nquestion; but he had clung to his optimistic Irish faith; he had solemnly\r\nannounced that Ireland was 'contented and happy,' when the country was\r\nsuffering from unquestionable distress; he had even refused to renew a\r\nmeasure for the repression of agrarian crime, when agrarian crime was\r\nformidably on the increase, and the Land League was rapidly growing in\r\nstrength. At last, however, partly opening his eyes to the facts, he\r\nappointed a Commission charged to report on Irish land tenure; and he\r\nintroduced a Bill slightly to amend the Land Act of 1870, showing thus\r\nfrom the outset that he choose to regard a conspiracy against the State on\r\nits economic side mainly, and not in its far more grave political aspect.\r\nA word must be said on this measure, which had its origin, to a great\r\nextent, in sheer and audacious falsehood. By this time Parnell was at the\r\nhead of some sixty adherents in the House of Commons; he had linked the\r\nHome Rule and the Land League movements; his followers were, in many\r\ninstances, chiefs of the League; they induced Mr. Gladstone to listen to\r\nthem, on representations characteristically untrue. Evictions were on the\r\nincrease in Ireland, owing to the onslaught made by the League on the\r\nlanded gentry; Parnell and his band unscrupulously exaggerated the number,\r\nperhaps twenty-fold, by confounding ejectment decrees of the Courts with\r\nevictions actually carried out; Mr. Gladstone appears to have accepted\r\nthis shameful statement. The new 'Compensation for Disturbance' Bill, as\r\nit was called, provided that in the case of certain classes of tenants,\r\nalthough they had failed to pay their rents, compensation, withheld, we\r\nhave seen, under the Act of 1870, might be afforded them, under rather\r\nstrict conditions; this was certainly an innovation of a startling kind,\r\nbut something was to be said for it, in the existing position of affairs.\r\nThe House of Commons, however, disliked a measure nicknamed 'payment by\r\nreason of non-payment,' and limited its application in many ways; and the\r\nHouse of Lords, unfortunately, I think, threw it out.\r\n\r\nThis Bill, closely circumscribed as it was, would not have extended,\r\nperhaps, to many tenants; it was condemned by Parnell and his satellites\r\nas a sham. Its rejection, however, gave an opportunity to the League; its\r\nleaders proclaimed at meetings, never so frequent before, that Ireland\r\nhad nothing to expect from a foreign Parliament; the attack on\r\n'landlordism' became more intense; treasonable and predatory harangues\r\nincreased in vehemence. The influence of the conspiracy spread beyond\r\nConnaught, over nearly all Munster, and parts of Leinster; wherever it was\r\nfelt it was attended with agrarian crime; 'crime,' as Mr. Gladstone\r\nexclaimed, 'always dogged its footsteps.' Offences of this kind\r\nportentously multiplied; they had been eight hundred and sixty-three at\r\nthe close of 1879; they were two thousand five hundred and eighty-nine at\r\nthe close of 1880;[70] and these included a number of barbarous murders,\r\nand of other atrocious deeds of outrage and blood, especially of the\r\nmutilation of the cattle of those opposed to the League. A kind of servile\r\nwar springing from the land had set in; and during this whole period the\r\nspokesmen of the League, whether in the highest or the lowest grades,\r\ncontinued to denounce the landed gentry, though they knew that their\r\nutterances were the direct incentive to far-spreading crime. Parnell,\r\nhowever, infinitely the ablest of the conspirators, perceived that this\r\nbrutal disorder would incense Parliament, and, besides, could not have\r\ndecisive results; the cool, calculating schemer laid down a plan of\r\noperations for the League, which he hoped would be less openly detestable,\r\nand much more effective. Orders were issued that tenants should, in every\r\npart of Ireland, repudiate the rents they had agreed to pay, and should\r\npay only such sums as had been assessed on land by a valuation made by the\r\nState for rates, a standard long acknowledged to be much too low; every\r\nlandlord who should reject these terms was to incur the vengeance of the\r\nLeague. By these means Parnell expected, and not without reason, that a\r\ngreat combination for the forcible reduction of rent would be formed, and\r\nthat numbers of farmers would flock in to the League, but he knew that\r\nhis proposal was simply a defiance of the law, and that it would be\r\nresisted by many of the landed gentry; he hit on an expedient through\r\nwhich he believed he would attain his end. Should any landlord refuse to\r\naccept the sum offered instead of the proper rent, and should proceed to\r\ndispossess the defaulting tenant--and practically he could have no other\r\nremedy--the evicted farm was to be left derelict; it was to be smitten, as\r\nit were, by the interdict of the League; and any wretch who should dare to\r\ntake it was to be banned by the whole neighbourhood; he and his, and those\r\nwho dealt with him, 'were to be shunned as lepers,' and 'treated as\r\ntraitors to the cause.'[71] In this way, the crime of 'boycotting,' as it\r\nhas ever since been called--its origin may be traced to the great Tithe\r\nWar in Ireland--was made part of 'the unwritten law' of the League; and\r\nParnell professed, whether sincerely or not, that through this device the\r\nLeague would baffle the law, and the landlords, as a class, as unhappily\r\nit did, in too many instances. Having thus armed the conspiracy with\r\nincreased power, he cynically began to deprecate crimes of violence: the\r\ndevice of 'boycotting' was a more excellent way; it would before long\r\n'bring landlords to their knees,' and would ultimately 'plant the tenant\r\nin his farm to be held at a nominal rent,' should he only be true to the\r\nLeague. At the same time the astute plotter found other means to extend\r\nhis authority and that of the conspiracy he ruled. He appealed to the\r\nelective Local Boards in each county, composed for the most part of tenant\r\nfarmers, to join the League, and to carry out his policy; and continuously\r\nbut steadily he brought the force of the League to bear upon the\r\nadministration of the law, by the intimidation of juries, magistrates, and\r\neven judicial persons.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of Parnell was disseminated by the League and its agencies,\r\nespecially at gatherings of peasant mobs; it was largely followed wherever\r\nthe League prevailed. In hundreds of instances tenant farmers were\r\ncompelled or induced to tender sums, 'at Griffith's valuation,' as it was\r\ncalled, in lieu of the rents they were bound to pay; and on the rejection\r\nof the offer, refused to pay anything. A widespread combination against\r\nrent was thus set on foot, sustained by a principle of greed which held it\r\ntogether; the League was more completely organised than it had been\r\nbefore; it made its way into ten or eleven counties, the only centres in\r\nwhich it was formidably strong. In these circumstances the landed gentry\r\nacted, as an order of men so assailed would act; not a few accepted the\r\nterms imposed on them, and took their rents at the reduced scale, the\r\nmajority resisted the mandates of the League, and appealed to the law to\r\nenforce their rights. The terrors of the League were at once directed\r\nagainst those who had dared to defy it; in a certain number of instances\r\nlandlords and agents were brutally murdered, for popular passions had been\r\nlet loose for years; in many more 'boycotting' was carried out with such\r\nfatal effect that scores of families were driven out of Ireland, banned,\r\npersecuted, deprived even of the necessaries of life; in many others the\r\ndemesnes of gentlemen were ravaged by 'Land League hunts,' overrun and\r\nhalf destroyed by savage mob gatherings. Evictions of course increased as\r\nthe law was being trampled under foot; it is hardly necessary to say that\r\nParnell's doctrine was here ruthlessly applied; evicted farms were left\r\ndeserted and waste over thousands of acres; the fears caused by\r\n'boycotting' had become so intense, that no 'land-grabber,' as the name\r\nwas, would dare to take them; the success of the League was in this\r\nrespect remarkable. The vengeance of the conspiracy, too, was extended\r\nuniversally to another class of persons. Tenants in numbers of instances\r\npaid their rents, either from an honest motive, or through dread of\r\neviction; the payment was often made at night, and under a pledge of\r\nsecrecy; but wherever they were discovered the League marked 'the\r\ntraitor's doom;' they were sometimes 'boycotted' almost to death;\r\nsometimes murdered, often visited by gangs of ruffians--significantly\r\nknown as Parnell's police; the victims were shot in the legs, or the hair\r\nof their women was cut off, or their cattle were cruelly mutilated and\r\nmaimed. It deserves special notice that, as was to be expected, Parnell's\r\nwarning against open crime was but little heeded; 'boycotting,' as Mr.\r\nGladstone said, truly 'was but a passive thing;' it 'required\r\nassassination as its sanction;' the peasantry had been stirred up, in\r\nplaces, to frenzy; although Parnell made few violent speeches at the time,\r\nhis satellites still gave a free rein to their wicked licence. Agrarian\r\ncrime increased to an appalling extent; it had reached in 1881 a total of\r\nfour thousand four hundred and thirty-nine cases, nearly two thousand more\r\nthan those of the preceding year.[72]\r\n\r\nIn the spring and summer of 1881, the power of the League was at its\r\nheight; in its organisation and working it bore a strong resemblance to\r\nthe Jacobin societies of the Revolution in France. It was directed by a\r\ncouncil from a central office in Dublin; its orders were sent thence to\r\nthe bodies connected with it; these, scattered over many parts of the\r\ncountry, enforced its decrees through 'boycotting' crime, and terror.\r\n'Obnoxious' persons, landlords, agents, 'land-grabbers,' and tenants who\r\nhad paid their rents, were denounced and exposed to the League's\r\nvengeance; officers of the law and of justice were especially banned; even\r\nthose thought to be 'luke-warm' in the cause were declared 'suspected.' In\r\nsome districts the regular government was practically superseded by the\r\ngovernment of the league, described by Mr. Gladstone as 'a scheme of\r\nanarchic oppression;' in these a Reign of Terror was really supreme. It\r\nwill never be known to what extent the League made use of Whiteboyism and\r\nits secret conclaves in order to carry out its purposes; the central body,\r\ncontrolled by Parnell, probably did not, but the affiliated bodies\r\ncertainly did; it is impossible to account otherwise for the enormous\r\nincrease of agrarian crime; the branches of the League, it is generally\r\nsupposed, overshadowed, so to speak, the Whiteboy societies; these were\r\nactive agents in the atrocious deeds that were done. It is scarcely\r\nnecessary to refer to what the condition of social life was wherever the\r\ninfluence of the League was great; despair settled on the hearts of\r\nthousands, who felt themselves exposed to unseen perils, and existed, as\r\nit were, in an atmosphere of crime; and it must be borne in mind that for\r\none member of the better class, fifty probably of the humbler, who had\r\ntransgressed the law of the League, were kept in a state of moral dread\r\nand torture. By this time the Fenian League in the United States, formed\r\nby Parnell, but ruled by the Clan na Gael, had completely joined hands\r\nwith the League at home; its emissaries were found in many parts of\r\nIreland; its organ, the _Irish World_, 'spread what it called the light,'\r\nthe teaching of treason, murder, and dynamite; and it supplied the parent\r\nLeague with, probably, nine-tenths of its funds, for it is a significant\r\nfact, deserving special notice, that the contributions of the peasantry to\r\nthe League were, from first to last, small. Large parts of Ireland were\r\nthus in a deplorable state; but it is a complete mistake to suppose, as\r\nhas been asserted, that the authority of the League was general throughout\r\nthe whole island. Protestant Ulster, with a true instinct of what the\r\nconspiracy was, a movement against British rule in Ireland, kept aloof\r\nfrom the League, in angry contempt; and though its influence was more\r\nwidely diffused, it was confined, I have said, to comparatively few\r\ncounties if regarded as a dangerous and formidable power. It is also\r\nabsolutely untrue that the movement was the uprising of an injured\r\npeasantry against oppressive landlords. There was little distress in 1880\r\nand 1881, when the League was rapidly growing in strength, for the\r\nharvests of those years were above the average; and the Commission lately\r\nappointed by Mr. Gladstone had reported that over-renting in Ireland was\r\nnot common, though instances of over-renting were of course to be\r\nfound.[73]\r\n\r\nThe centre of disturbance formed by the Land League was, I have said,\r\ncomparatively small; and it was, for the most part, limited to backward\r\nand poor districts; its wicked and sordid teaching did not command the\r\nsympathies of the more intelligent and better parts of Ireland. Its\r\ninfluence, however, spread, in different degrees of strength, over nearly\r\nthe whole of Catholic Ireland, and it was more or less supported by the\r\nCatholic priesthood, in many instances yielding to the pressure of their\r\nflocks. Within the bounds where it did not create a Reign of Terror, it\r\nwas joined by thousands who thought it a constitutional movement,\r\nespecially by peasants only seeking an improved tenure; and it is not\r\npretended that even a majority of those who took part in it had\r\ntreasonable or rebellious objects in view. But it was not the less a\r\nconspiracy hatched abroad, and aiming at the subversion of British power\r\nin Ireland; this was the policy its leaders avowed; and a conspiracy must\r\nbe judged by the acts and words of those who direct it. The state of\r\nanarchy in Ireland had become such, in the spring of 1881, that the\r\nGovernment was compelled to try to put it down; a prosecution against\r\nParnell and his chief lieutenants had failed; a Bill, resisted by\r\nobstruction, more persistent than had been ever known before, passed\r\nthrough Parliament with the object of repressing the Land League. The\r\nmeasure, however, was not well designed; minor agents of the League,\r\n'village ruffians,' 'Parnell's police,' and the like, were imprisoned in\r\nlarge numbers, no real punishment; but the chiefs of the conspiracy were\r\nnot brought within the law; the funds of the League were removed to Paris;\r\nthe movement went on in its destructive course. 'Coercion,' nevertheless,\r\nwas beginning to produce its effects, as it has always done in Irish\r\ndisorders, when Mr. Gladstone made a sudden change in his policy, never\r\nmade before by a Minister at the head of the State. He had denounced the\r\nconspiracy in passionate language; he had partly at least seen what its\r\nobjects were; 'it aimed at dismemberment through rapine;' but always a man\r\nof phrases and not of action, he had shrunk in every passage of his career\r\nfrom facing difficulties where popular feelings were involved; and while\r\nIreland was still in a terrible state, he resolved to make a great\r\nconcession to the League, and to effect a complete revolution in the Irish\r\nland. It was a surrender akin to that of Majuba, made with little\r\ninformation, and without mature reflection; whether its author believed,\r\nas I have remarked, that the conspiracy was most dangerous on its agrarian\r\nside, or was willing to propitiate Parnell, at the expense of the Irish\r\nlanded gentry, he inaugurated the legislation, ever since pursued, which\r\nhas resulted in destroying the property of the Irish landlord, without\r\ngaining the sympathy of the occupier of the Irish soil, has reduced the\r\nland system of Ireland to a ruinous chaos, and has, in essential respects,\r\nbeen an absolute failure.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone's position was difficult when he introduced his new Irish\r\nLand Bill; his speech in the House of Commons, lucid as regards details,\r\nwas apologetic, ambiguous, often beside the subject. He went out of his\r\nway to praise Irish landlords, 'acquitted,' he declared, by the late\r\nCommission; he deeply regretted a new experiment on the Irish land. He\r\nretained his admiration for the Act of 1870, but insinuated that it had\r\nbeen injured in the House of Lords; had this not been the case, it would\r\nhave settled the Irish land question. He passed over his solemn pledges,\r\non the faith of which millions had been lent on Irish estates, that the\r\nlegislation of eleven years before was final; here he took refuge in\r\nappeals to 'Divine Justice,' in the 'light of which' a statesman must\r\nwalk, as if Divine Justice was an excuse for a gross breach of faith. He\r\nthen unfolded his plan of reform; he endeavoured, with an ingenuity all\r\nhis own, to distinguish it from the schemes he had emphatically condemned\r\nin 1870; but in this respect mystification was at fault; the measure was a\r\nclumsy imitation of the 'Three F's,' and where it differed, it differed\r\ngreatly for the worse. Anticipating objections certain to be made, the\r\norator dismissed 'political economy to Saturn' with a confident gesture;\r\nfor some untold reason the philosophy of Adam Smith could not possibly\r\napply to the order of things in Ireland. But by many degrees the most\r\nimportant part of the speech, in view of events which have since happened,\r\nwas that in which Mr. Gladstone announced that should the measure really\r\ninjure the Irish landlord, the State was bound to provide an indemnity. He\r\ndenied, indeed, that the Bill could have any such effect; it would be a\r\nboon, he gravely said, to the Irish landed gentry; but should the contrary\r\nbe the case, 'compensation' would be clearly their right. 'I do not\r\nhesitate to say'--these were his very words spoken after the Bill had made\r\nmuch progress--'that if it can be shown, on clear and definite experience,\r\nat the present time, that there is a probability, or if after experience\r\nshall prove that, in fact, ruin and heavy loss has been brought on any\r\nclass in Ireland by the direct effect of this legislation, that is a\r\nquestion which we ought to look very directly in the face.' The same\r\nmeaning was even more clearly expressed: 'I should certainly be very slow\r\nto deny that where confiscation could be proved, compensation ought to\r\nfollow,' and several of Mr. Gladstone's lieutenants spoke in the same\r\nsense.[74]\r\n\r\nThe Bill, I have said, applied the principle of the 'Three F's' to the\r\nrelation of landlord and tenant in by far the greatest part of Ireland. As\r\nin the case of the Land Act of 1870, it excluded certain classes of lands\r\nfrom its scope, demesnes, residential holdings, town parks, and large\r\npastoral farms; it extended also only to tenants at will, that is, subject\r\nto a notice to quit; it left tenants under leases outside its purview. It\r\nwas confined, too, to 'present tenants in occupation,' at or near the\r\nexisting time; it had no reference to 'future tenants,' that is, to\r\ntenants holding by contracts made after the Bill should pass, or a few\r\nmonths afterwards. Subject, however, to these exceptions, on the whole not\r\nlarge, the measure placed tenancies in Ireland under the 'Three F's,' but\r\nwith conditions of tenure peculiar to itself, and hitherto unknown in\r\nIreland, or in any part of Europe. 'Fair Rent,' which, under the Ulster\r\nCustom, was settled by a bargain between landlord and tenant, was to be\r\nadjusted through the intervention of the State, legislation akin to the\r\nmediaeval statutes regulating the price of bread, and the wages of labour.\r\n'Fixity of Tenure' was not to be a perpetuity in name; Mr. Gladstone\r\nfeared that the speeches would be thrown in his teeth, in which he had\r\ndeclaimed against the idea; it was to be a lease for fifteen years, but\r\ncapable of being renewed for ever, as a rule, through a periodical and\r\ncostly lawsuit. 'Free Sale' was to be conceded under somewhat strict\r\nconditions; and the landlord was to be afforded a right of pre-emption in\r\nthe case of such sales, in accordance with the analogy of the Ulster\r\nCustom. An estate virtually perpetual, at a State-settled rent, was thus\r\nto be carved out of the landlord's fee, and given to tenants actually in\r\npossession of the land; it was created in absolute derogation from the\r\nlandlord's rights; it was a large if partial expropriation, in no doubtful\r\nsense. As to the interest of landlords in what was left of their property,\r\nthey were to retain what are usually known as 'royalties'--timber,\r\nminerals, mines, and privileges of sport; they were to have the ordinary\r\nremedies for enforcing payment of rent; and the statutory leases were to\r\nbe subject to certain conditions, taken, for the most part, from the\r\nUlster Custom, the violation of which might lead to their forfeiture. A\r\ntribunal, called the Land Commission, was to be set up to carry the law\r\ninto effect, that is, to 'fix fair rents,' and to make tenures 'fixed;' it\r\nwas to be assisted by dependent agencies, known as Sub-Commissions, which,\r\nMr. Gladstone intimated, were to be quite subordinate, and from which\r\nappeals to the Land Commission were to run; but a sinister feature of an\r\nuntried revolutionary scheme--the decision of the Land Commission as\r\nrespects 'fair rent'--was to be final. Subject to an appeal to the Land\r\nCommission, the Irish County Courts were empowered to administer the law;\r\nbut it was foreseen that they would not do much in this province. The new\r\nmodes of tenure might be applied to lands, by agreements between landlords\r\nand tenants carefully guarded; and Mr. Gladstone believed that this would\r\nbe the ordinary course of dealing. The Bill, he thought, would not cause\r\nlitigation to any great extent; it would operate as a self-acting force to\r\nlead to friendly contracts.[75]\r\n\r\nSo much for the scope of the Bill and the classes of tenants to which its\r\nbenefits were to extend. A most important change was made in the measure,\r\nwhich contained, originally, nothing of the kind; this has been attended\r\nwith far-reaching results. As we have seen, tenants were to be compensated\r\nfor their improvements, under the Act of 1870; but the compensation was\r\nto be paid only when they were leaving the land; Mr. Healy, one of the\r\nablest of Parnell's lieutenants, induced Parliament to accept a provision\r\nexempting tenants' improvements from rent, when the adjustment of 'fair\r\nrent' was to be made. However equitable in principle this might appear to\r\nbe, it was, in the peculiar state of Irish land tenure, unjust in the\r\nextreme to landlords, as I shall endeavour to point out afterwards; and it\r\nhas been a source of litigation, as mischievous and demoralising as can\r\nwell be conceived. The Bill, like the Act of 1870, prohibited the\r\nsubdivision and subletting of farms--an inveterate evil practice of the\r\nIrish peasant--under conditions possibly rather too strict; and it made\r\nchanges, in that statute, which require attention. It added weight, so to\r\nspeak, to the law, in the tenant's interest; it increased the amount of\r\ncompensation in respect of disturbance; it limited the power of\r\n'contracting out,' to a smaller class of tenants than had been the case\r\nbefore, in fact, to large capitalist farmers; and it provided that\r\ntenants, who had accepted leases excluding them from the benefits of the\r\nAct of 1870, through illegitimate conduct on the part of their landlords,\r\nshould be exonerated from such unfair contracts. It thus greatly amended\r\nthe original Land Act; but it left many of its defects untouched; it is\r\nonly right here to add that despite the lying clamour raised by the\r\nsubsidised Press of Parnell--lying has ever since been part of its\r\nstock-in-trade--the instances were exceedingly few in which 'forced\r\nleases,' as they were called, were set aside by the Courts. A remarkable\r\nfeature of the Bill has yet to be noticed: Mr. Gladstone, as was the case\r\neleven years before, had still the wish, so characteristic of British\r\nstatesmen, to assimilate Irish to English land tenure; for this reason, as\r\nI said, he deprived 'future tenants' of the advantages of the Bill; these\r\nwere to hold their farms on the footing of pure contract. This was a\r\nshortsighted and bad arrangement; it tempted directly ill-conditioned\r\nlandlords to dispossess tenants, whenever a chance offered, and to create\r\n'future' tenants so as to discharge their estates from a burden; it\r\nrevealed marked ignorance of the affairs of Ireland. The Bill dealt, also,\r\nwith the land on the side of ownership; it gave additional facilities to\r\ntenants to purchase their holdings; the State was empowered to advance\r\nthree-fourths of the moneys; but the tenants were to find the remaining\r\nfourth; the transaction was to be still a purchase, and not in the nature\r\nof a gift.[76]\r\n\r\nThe Bill became law, with very little change; the House of Lords, though\r\nfully alive to its evils, did not amend it in any important respect; the\r\nPeers had in mind, perhaps too much, what had followed the rejection of\r\nthe Bill of the year before. Mr. Gladstone and his followers maintained at\r\nthe time, and the statement has been ever since repeated, that the Land\r\nAct of 1881, its popular title, was but a natural development of the\r\noriginal Act of 1870; but this assertion is not only untrue, but\r\nabsolutely contrary to the truth. The Act of 1870, no doubt, considered as\r\na whole, annexed a large tenant right to the estate of the landlord, and\r\nto that extent placed a burden on it; but it preserved for the landlord\r\nthe ownership of the land; it did not interfere with his rent, his first\r\nproprietary right; above all, it was, in the main, in accord with fact,\r\nand just. The Act of 1881 was almost the exact opposite; it deprived the\r\nlandlord of the ownership of his land, and nearly converted him into a\r\nmere rent-charger; it created against him a perpetuity at a State-settled\r\nrent; it really all but made the tenant the owner of the land; it was, in\r\nshort, inconsistent with fact, and essentially unjust. The Act of 1881,\r\ntoo, established a principle, never heard of before in civilised\r\ncountries, that tribunals of the State were to fix the rate of rent; this\r\nnot only annihilated the most important of landed contracts, entirely to\r\nthe landlord's detriment, it inevitably tended to cut down rents\r\nwholesale, as Judge Longfield had predicted would be the case. 'It is\r\nprobable,' wrote that great authority, 'that the value of land, as fixed\r\nby any tenant-right measure, would be less than half the rent, which a\r\nsolvent tenant would be willing to pay;'[77] the prediction has been too\r\nwell verified. The Act of 1870, in a word, was a remedial law, fairly\r\nadjusting the rights of landlord and tenant; the Act of 1881 was a\r\nsocialistic law, despoiling the landlord of his property wholesale, and\r\nhanding it over to a dependent who had no claim to it; it was sheer\r\nconfiscation hardly disguised; and it should be added that the exemption\r\nof tenants' improvements from rent, as affairs stood in Ireland, was a\r\ngrave wrong to the landlord. The Act of 1881, to speak plainly,\r\ntransformed the Irish land system iniquitously for the benefit of a single\r\nclass; and it directly promoted litigation of the very worst kind, on an\r\nenormous scale, embittering, and still further dividing, the classes\r\nconnected with the land. The evils of this legislation, a monument of\r\nreckless unwisdom, were at once manifest to well-informed persons; the\r\nDuke of Argyll and Lord Lansdowne resigned office rather than take part in\r\na measure of the kind; Lord Ashbourne, the present holder of the Great\r\nSeal in Ireland, caustically remarked that Parliament would do much better\r\nshould it deprive Irish landlords of a fourth part of their rents on the\r\nspot. The verdict of enlightened and impartial opinion in Ireland was very\r\nmuch the same.\r\n\r\nI shall comment on the administration of this law in another chapter;\r\nenough to say here that what was bad was made, by many degrees, worse. The\r\nconduct of Parnell, as regards the measure, was characteristic; he assumed\r\nan attitude of moderation, and proposed to make 'a trial of the Act by\r\ntest cases;' he wrote to his Fenian friends in the Far West that the Act\r\nwas a mockery; he allowed the Land League to riot in lawlessness as\r\nbefore. Mr. Gladstone, always incensed when his will was crossed, shut him\r\nup in prison under the recent statute, with several prominent leaders of\r\nthe League; the reply was a manifesto against the payment of any rent,\r\nunhappily obeyed in some districts, though every symptom of exceptional\r\ndistress had passed away. A brief but violent struggle was the result; the\r\npeasantry refused to pay a shilling in several counties; and as the\r\nprincipal agents of the League were within four walls, flights of\r\nviragoes, like those of the French Revolution, were let loose to preach,\r\nfar and near, the evangel of 'no rent.' This conflict, however, was not\r\nlasting; agrarian crime and disorder, indeed, still continued frequent;\r\nbut the Government was too strong for the 'Ladies' Land League;' by the\r\nspring of 1882 its triumph appeared to be certain. But Mr. Gladstone,\r\n'unstable as water' in view of what he deemed popular movements, would not\r\nsteadily persist in vindicating the law; the imprisonment of the chiefs of\r\nthe conspiracy and their subordinates, in large numbers, seems to have\r\nmade him feel sore if unworthy misgivings; he surrendered to the enemies\r\nof the State, for the second time, and entered with Parnell into the\r\nfamous 'Kilmainham Treaty,' as shameful as the Glamorgan Treaty which cost\r\nCharles I. his head. The 'Suspects,' as they were called, were set free in\r\nscores; the Lord-Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary indignantly left their\r\nposts; a new Government for Ireland was formed, charged to carry\r\n'conciliation,' as the phrase was, out, that is, to make fresh concessions\r\nto Parnell and his creatures. But the auspicious prospect was suddenly\r\ndarkened by the frightful assassinations of the Phoenix Park; these\r\ncannot be justly laid to the charge of the League, indeed were against\r\nParnell's interest, for it was generally expected he would obtain high\r\noffice; but two agents of the League were implicated in the crime; and the\r\nPress of the League began soon to plead for the murderers. The mind of\r\nEngland was now thoroughly roused; Mr. Gladstone, bowing at once to\r\nEngland's will, carried through Parliament the severest repressive measure\r\nthat has ever, perhaps, been applied to Ireland. The battle with the\r\nLeague was soon brought to a close; the conspiracy indeed resisted for a\r\ntime, and crime, as always, was attendant on it; and the Clan na Gael gave\r\nit all the assistance it could, in large subsidies which had never ceased,\r\nin the dissemination in Ireland of its incendiary journals, and especially\r\nby 'carrying the war into England,' and fulfilling its threats to attack\r\nher chief towns by fire and dynamite, outrages, however, that really came\r\nto nothing. But 'coercion,' as has been invariably the case in Ireland,\r\nproduced its effects; agrarian crimes, which, in 1882, if less than those\r\nof the year before, were, nevertheless, three thousand four hundred and\r\nthirty-two in number, had fallen to eight hundred and seventy in 1883.[78]\r\n\r\nThe Land League was paralysed, if not destroyed; its organisation was, in\r\nname, suppressed by its framers. It reappeared, however, at once, in a new\r\nform; the skill of Parnell in masking a conspiracy was never more fully\r\ndisplayed. He felt that the Land League could not cope with the law; that\r\nthe crimes of violence and blood, which attended its course, gave the\r\nGovernment opportunities to put it down; that its openly avowed purposes\r\nwere a danger to it. He set up, therefore, the 'National League' in its\r\nstead; the professed object of the association was to promote 'Home Rule,'\r\nwhile it upheld the rights of the occupiers of the Irish soil, and kept\r\nthe Irish land, so to speak, in view; it was thus apparently a mere centre\r\nof a constitutional movement. Through these means, and under these\r\npretences, the astute and able plotter swept into his net thousands who\r\nhad held aloof from the Land League; many of the middle classes joined the\r\nNational League, notably hundreds of the clergy of the Catholic Church in\r\nIreland; the peasantry gave it increased support; its influence spread\r\nbeyond its predecessor's limits. The National League, however, was only\r\nthe Land League under another name;[79] its leaders and officials were the\r\nsame men; its 'branches' were those of the League it replaced; its real\r\nobjects were exactly the same, the overthrow of British rule in Ireland,\r\nand the annihilation of the Irish landed gentry. But the methods it\r\nemployed to work out its ends were, to a great extent, different; open\r\nagitation was kept down; public meetings, likely to be violent, were not\r\nheld; the perpetration of agrarian crime was not encouraged. The movement,\r\nin a word, was comparatively secret and below the surface; but it was\r\nessentially the successor of the Land League in its aims; we may say of\r\nit, with a slight change, in the words of the poet--\r\n\r\n          'Facies non una sororum,\r\n  Nec diversa tamen.'\r\n\r\n'Boycotting' was now made the chief weapon of the reformed conspiracy;\r\n'National League Courts' were held regularly in many districts, at which\r\nthis barbarous interdict was systematically pronounced on persons\r\nviolating 'the unwritten law' of the old League; the persecution against\r\nlandlords, agents, 'land-grabbing' peasants who were 'disloyal and\r\ntraitors,' and traders suspected of dealing with 'rotten sheep,' was\r\ncarried on with a pertinacity and ingenuity hardly known before; the\r\nnumber of derelict farms augmented; and the Government found it far from\r\neasy to deal with these crimes. At the same time, 'the Nationalist Press,'\r\nas it had been named, fully revealed the purpose of the conspirators;\r\ntrusting to impunity, under the law of libel, which depended upon the will\r\nof juries, it was even more treasonable and seditious than before; and it\r\ngave infamous license to defamation of personages in high places, worthy\r\nof the abominations of the Pere Duchesne.[80] Ireland, however, remained\r\nin comparative peace while the recent measure of repression continued in\r\nforce; but this was injudiciously allowed to expire in 1885--a strange act\r\non the part of a Conservative Ministry; and in a short time agrarian\r\ndisorder broke out afresh. Crimes of this class had fallen, in 1884, to\r\nseven hundred and sixty-two in number; they were one thousand and\r\nfifty-six in 1886; and 'boycotting' had increased fourfold.[81]\r\n\r\nThe National League remained quiescent, while Mr. Gladstone was making\r\nanother surrender, and endeavouring to carry Home Rule through Parliament.\r\nUpon the rejection of the measure of 1886, its activity was renewed; and\r\nit found considerable support from the American Fenians, who, from first\r\nto last, had been its chief paymasters. I have referred to the Convention\r\nat Chicago graced by Parnell's envoys, and to the wild boast that the\r\nEnglish 'government of Ireland was to be made impossible;' the treasonable\r\naspect of the conspiracy became at once manifest. The League was assisted\r\nby another season of distress, from 1886 to 1888; the number of its\r\nadherents greatly increased; it began, like its predecessor, to defy the\r\nauthority of the State. I have already dealt with this movement on its\r\npolitical side; I shall not repeat what I have already written: how the\r\nLeague endeavoured to stir up disorder in Ireland; how it declared open\r\nwar against the Castle; how it tried to terrorise the ministers of the\r\nlaw; how it made 'boycotting' more effective than it had ever been; how,\r\nif responsible for many grave deeds of blood, it mainly relied on this\r\nmalign influence, which tortured hundreds of victims in many districts,\r\nand was fitly compared to 'the pestilence that walks in darkness;' how Mr.\r\nGladstone and the Opposition, to the disgrace of both, gave the conspiracy\r\ntheir support and excused its crimes; and how it was ere long put down by\r\nMr. Balfour strongly seconded by Rome. But I must say a word on the\r\nagrarian side of the movement; for this illustrated the increased\r\ningenuity of the League. Some of its leaders issued a mandate against the\r\npayment of rent, except upon reductions to an enormous extent; should the\r\nlandlords refuse, the tenants, on every estate, were to lodge their rents\r\ninto what was called the 'War chest,' a common fund to be held in trust;\r\nthe object of this being to prevent the secret payment of rent, which had\r\nrepeatedly, we have seen, taken place, and to put a stop to 'defection\r\nfrom the cause.' The 'Plan of Campaign' as was its name, was thus ushered\r\non; it was a criminal plot of the very basest kind; but though it proved\r\nsuccessful in some instances, and it caused much agrarian disorder and\r\ncrime, it was, on the whole, a comparative failure. The peasantry,\r\nclose-fisted and shrewd, distrusted the so-called 'trustees of the War\r\nchest;' they generally declined to put their money in it; the 'Plan' was\r\nonly carried out on few estates, though it compelled many landlords to\r\nmake reductions of rent; it is remarkable that Parnell did not approve of\r\nthe swindle. Long, however, before the defeat of the League, there had\r\nbeen a thousand instances of agrarian crime: five thousand miserable\r\nbeings had been 'boycotted,' in many cases with frightful results; a\r\nthousand had been placed under the protection of the police. As had\r\nhappened during the _regime_ of the Land League, these victims were nearly\r\nall of the humble classes.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 another change was made in the Irish land system, essentially a\r\ndevelopment of the Land Act of 1881. That measure, I have said, applied to\r\ntenants at will only, that is, liable to be dispossessed by a notice to\r\nquit; it did not apply to tenants under leasehold tenures. A sharp\r\ndistinction, therefore, was drawn between the two classes; a farmer, with\r\nland on one side of a ditch, could secure the advantages of the 'Three\r\nF's;' his neighbour, on the other side, could not; the distinction was so\r\npalpably harsh, that many landlords in Ireland saw its injustice, and\r\nenabled leasehold tenants to obtain the benefits of the law. An Act,\r\nprepared by Lord Salisbury's Government, brought ordinary Irish\r\nleaseholders within the Land Act of 1881; these were given a right to have\r\n'fair rents' fixed, and 'fixity of tenure' and 'free sale' under certain\r\nconditions. The Act of 1887, also, empowered the Courts to set aside\r\nperpetual leases unfairly obtained; and it relaxed the restrictions of the\r\nAct of 1881 with respect to subletting and subdivision, and the exclusion\r\nof 'town parks.' It improved, moreover, the law of ejectment,\r\nfacilitating the vindication of the rights of the landlord; and--a strange\r\nprovision--it enabled a middleman, in certain events, to creep out of his\r\ncontract, and to free himself from the rent due to his superior landlord.\r\nIn consequence of the fall of prices that had lately occurred, and the\r\ndepression of agriculture that had been the result, the Act, too, reduced,\r\nfor a short period of time, 'fair rents' that had been already fixed; and\r\nit contained other enactments wholly in the interest of the occupier of\r\nthe Irish soil. Regarded as a whole, something was to be said for the\r\nmeasure, on the principles of the legislation of 1881; but the liberation\r\nof the middleman from the payment of a debt has been attended with grave\r\nwrong, and was an ominous precedent leading to others of the kind. The new\r\nlaw was, of course, another inroad on the rights of the Irish landlord,\r\nanother innovation made against his interests; it has certainly\r\nstrengthened his claim to compensation for the loss of his property,\r\nacknowledged by Mr. Gladstone to be unquestionable, should it be\r\nreasonably made out. For the rest, the National League made a boast that\r\nthe Act had been wrung by its efforts from a foreign Parliament; the Act\r\ncertainly, like that of 1881, was a concession, derogating from the rights\r\nof a powerless class, in the hope of weakening a conspiracy against the\r\nState, by detaching from it large classes supported by it, and handing\r\nover to these what had belonged to the Irish landed gentry.[82]\r\n\r\nThe Land Act of 1887, it has been alleged, was the principal cause that\r\ndisorder in Ireland was suppressed, and that comparative peace was\r\nrestored. The measure may have had effects in this direction; but these\r\nassuredly were not great; the number of leaseholders was not large; the\r\nreductions made in 'fair rents' were temporary and small. In truth, as\r\nagrarian war, stirred up by the Land League, did not diminish when the Act\r\nof 1881 was passed, but was brought to an end by what is called coercion,\r\nthe agrarian war, stirred up by the National League, was quelled, not by\r\nthe Act of 1887, but by resolute government, assisted by a repressive\r\nmeasure infinitely less stringent than that of 1882, and, in some degree,\r\nI have said, by Rome. It is worse than unwise to ignore plain facts; grave\r\noutbreaks of disorder and crime in Ireland can only be put down by severe\r\nmeans, and invariably have been put down by these; that 'force is no\r\nremedy' is mere false sentiment. The violence, nay, the power, of the\r\nNational League decreased rapidly and greatly after about 1889; the\r\nconspiracy seemed well-nigh to have dwindled away. This was partly because\r\nParnell, negotiating with Mr. Gladstone, in the hope of obtaining Home\r\nRule, discouraged agitation of every kind in Ireland, and in order to\r\nhoodwink the English people, and to bring about the 'Union of Hearts,'\r\nrepresented, with his followers, that Ireland was at perfect peace, and\r\nonly awaited 'self-government' to be completely happy. But infinitely the\r\nmost potent reason was that the fall of Parnell almost broke up the\r\nLeague; his creatures split into angry factions, exasperated against each\r\nother by furious discord; as the result the organisation of the League was\r\nshattered; the peasantry and the Catholic priesthood fell away from it. At\r\nthe same time the Fenians in the United States, much its best supporters,\r\nwithdrew the subsidies they had hitherto lavished; the League became\r\npenniless and almost powerless. By 1895 the conspiracy showed scarcely a\r\nsign of life; agrarian crime had sunk to a very low ebb; there was no sign\r\nof a movement against the payment of rent; order prevailed, it may be\r\nsaid, throughout the community. The conspiracy, nevertheless, was not\r\ndead; its leaders, if quiescent, had not disappeared; well-informed\r\nobservers knew that the end had not come. I have described in another\r\nchapter, by what means, and through what conditions, it revived gradually\r\nunder Lord Salisbury's third Government, and acquired strength that may be\r\non the increase; it is not yet formidable, in any real sense, and its\r\nleaders are not to be named with Parnell; it is not receiving funds as yet\r\nfrom America; but the United Irish League is its true successor; and this\r\ncommands eighty votes in the House of Commons. Time only can show if a\r\nperiod of agrarian strife and crime may not be about to open again for\r\nIreland; it is foolish optimism to assert that this is impossible, or to\r\ncontend that the agrarian legislation of the last twenty years, as regards\r\nthe Irish land, will necessarily, or even probably, produce this fortunate\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 another change was effected in Irish landed relations, as usual in\r\nthe interest of the tenant, and against his landlord. Middleman tenures\r\nhad well-nigh been extinguished; but some hundreds, probably, were still\r\nto be found; and as a middleman, through the legislation of 1887, was\r\nenabled to repudiate his contract, in certain cases, and to escape the\r\npayment of rent to his superior landlord, he was now to obtain an\r\nadvantage in other instances. The large majority of this class of\r\nintermediate owners, originally created in the eighteenth century, held,\r\nat least, in present times, by perpetual leases, which had long ago, as a\r\nrule, been converted into estates in fee farm, that is, estates in fee,\r\nsubject to a perpetual rent; Parliament passed an Act in 1891, enlarged\r\nand amended five years afterwards, declaring that, in cases in which\r\ntenants of this kind were 'in _bona fide_ occupation' of lands, under\r\nrents which, in the judgment of the Land Commission, should be 'a full\r\nagricultural rent,' they might either agree with their landlords to redeem\r\nthe rent at a price to be determined by that tribunal, or, should the\r\nlandlords refuse their consent, might have 'fair rents' fixed as in the\r\ninstance of common farming tenants.[83] The application of this law could\r\nnot extend far, for tenants of this description were very few; but it\r\nasserted a strange, and, I think, a most vicious principle. The Act\r\npractically forced a superior landlord, often a poor man, either to accept\r\na price assessed by a Court over which he had no control, in lieu of a\r\nrent, in all probability reasonably well secured, or, as an alternative,\r\nto submit to have a 'fair rent' fixed on the land, the rent to be\r\ndischarged from improvements made by the tenant. If, therefore, a tenant\r\nof this kind had built, say, a valuable house, on his holding, which would\r\nthus largely add to the security for the rent, this--at least, so it is\r\ngenerally believed--was not to be taken into account in fixing 'the fair\r\nrent;' and this principle, it may confidently be predicted, will be\r\nextended further. Should a tenant, at a 'fair rent,' in this predicament,\r\nbe evicted for the failure to pay the rent, a law, in all human\r\nprobability, will be made, to obtain for him compensation, under the Act\r\nof 1870, from the benefits of which he would be, as affairs stand,\r\nexcluded. The result might be that if, as would often happen, the\r\nimprovements he had made were of great value--his interest, in the land,\r\nbeing a perpetual interest--the sum the landlord would be adjudged to pay,\r\nmight swallow up the whole value of the rent, and practically confiscate\r\nhis whole property.[84]\r\n\r\nIn 1896 another inroad was made on the rights of Irish landlords, and\r\nanother dole given to the tenant class in Ireland; the descent to Avernus\r\nhad proved easy; a Conservative Government had followed it since 1887.\r\nThis fresh legislation was mainly in the interest of the Presbyterian\r\nfarmers of Ulster, who had supported the Union almost to a man, and\r\npossessed no little political weight; but who, always separated more or\r\nless from their landlords, had shown dissatisfaction with the fixing of\r\n'fair rents,' and had begun to cry out for what is called 'the compulsory\r\npurchase' of the estates of their landlords, a policy on which I shall\r\ncomment afterwards. The Bill contained just and well-devised provisions;\r\nit improved the procedure for fixing 'fair rents,' if not nearly as\r\nthoroughly as it ought to have done; it protected the leases creating\r\n'fixity,' under the new tenure--Mr. Gladstone, flying in the face of the\r\nablest lawyers, had passionately declared that these were sacrosanct--in\r\ninstances in which these might have been annulled; it proposed, what I had\r\nalways considered right, that old arrears of rent ought not to be allowed\r\nto hang over the heads of tenants, and that rent could not be recovered on\r\neviction, if due for upward of two years.[85] But the Bill abounded in\r\nprinciples dangerous and false; it was, taken as a whole, a mischievous\r\nmeasure; it was another mine sprung upon the Irish landed gentry. Lands\r\nhitherto excluded from the benefits of the 'Three F's,' under the Acts of\r\n1881 and 1887--that is, demesnes, town parks, residential, and pastoral\r\nholdings--were largely brought within the scope of the Bill, that is, they\r\nwere made subject to 'fair rents,' and, if held by tenants, were\r\npractically taken away from the landlords; the provisions of the Bill, as\r\nto demesnes, were especially harsh; many a mansion and demesne, which\r\nmight happen to be let, would really become the property of the tenant,\r\nthe owner being put off with a rent-charge. The worst proposals of this\r\nmeasure, however, were those relating to improvements made by tenants,\r\nexempted from rent, we have seen, by the Act of 1881. The Courts of\r\nJustice in Ireland had rightly declared with one voice, that improvements\r\nof this kind were not to be discharged from rent, unless they were the\r\nimprovements treated by the Act of 1870, that is, rents might be charged\r\non tenants' improvements, if these did not fall within the definition laid\r\ndown by that law, or if they were outside the limitations it had imposed,\r\nin order to shut out obsolete and unjust claims, which might harass and do\r\ngrievous wrong to landlords. All this was completely changed by the new\r\nmeasure; the definition of improvements was wholly altered, in order to\r\nsecure their being exempted from rent; the restrictions in point of time,\r\nand many other matters, as regards claims for improvements, were largely\r\nswept away, and the power of 'contracting out' of such claims was still\r\nfurther abridged. The whole law, in a word, as to tenants' improvements,\r\nas these were to create exemption from rent, was placed on altogether a\r\nnew basis; this was detrimental in every respect to the landlord, and gave\r\nadvantages to the tenant, in my judgment, utterly unjust.[86]\r\n\r\nThe Bill contained other provisions, all in the same direction, that is,\r\nfor the advantage of the Irish tenant, and to his landlord's loss,\r\nespecially one relaxing the law as to the subdivision and subletting of\r\nfarms, an inveterate and very pernicious practice. It introduced, also, a\r\nnew principle, on which I shall say some words afterwards, with respect to\r\nanother experiment on the Irish land, that is, what is called Land\r\nPurchase, under conditions, not thought of before, until they were laid\r\ndown by a Conservative Government. The measure was hustled through the\r\nHouse of Commons with such indecorous haste, that Sir Edward Carson, now a\r\nlaw-officer of the Crown, walked out of that Assembly to express his\r\ndisgust; it narrowly escaped defeat in the House of Lords, loyal as the\r\nPeers to Lord Salisbury are; indeed, though hardly debated, its vices were\r\nsoon made manifest. It is unnecessary to point out what the general\r\ncharacter of the Act is; it enlarged very considerably the sphere of the\r\n'Three F's,' greatly increasing the wrong done to the Irish landlord, by\r\ndoing away with the restrictions, placed by Mr. Gladstone, in 1870, on\r\nillegitimate claims in respect of improvements; its direct tendency was to\r\nreduce rents wholesale, and to promote more litigation between landlord\r\nand tenant; and if it encouraged tenants to make improvements on their\r\nfarms, its plain effect, I will not say its purpose, was to 'improve the\r\nIrish landlords out of their estates,' the contemptuous phrase of a great\r\nmaster of Equity. Its mischief, however, went a great deal further;\r\ntenants making improvements are only exempted from rent, in respect of\r\nthese, by this Act; they are not within the protection of the Act of 1870,\r\nif improvements of any kind are excluded by it; if a tenant, therefore,\r\nmakes an improvement on his farm, which is not 'suitable' to it in a real\r\nsense, say, builds a mansion upon a petty holding, he will not be entitled\r\nto compensation, should he quit it, even though dispossessed for\r\nnon-payment of his rent. But tenants, in these circumstances, like those I\r\nhave referred to before, would assuredly proclaim that they had here a\r\ngreat and real grievance; and they would be relieved from it, doubtless,\r\nby another law, giving them compensation, perhaps, to their landlord's\r\nruin. A dangerous principle is thus hidden within the Act; this will\r\nprobably be asserted against the owners of ground rents, not only in\r\nIreland, but in England and Scotland; and the law, taken as a whole, has\r\nstrengthened the claim of the Irish landed gentry to be indemnified, as\r\nwas solemnly promised, for what they have suffered from the legislation\r\nbegun in 1881.\r\n\r\nWhile the Irish land system was thus being dealt with, on the side of\r\noccupation, during many years, experiments were made on it, likewise on\r\nthe side of ownership. Resenting the legislation that had produced the\r\n'Three F's,' Conservative politicians took it into their heads that Mr.\r\nGladstone had 'created' 'dual ownership,' as they gave it the name, in\r\nIreland; they insisted that this was simply an intolerable thing.\r\nUnfortunately Mr. Gladstone had no more 'created dual ownership' than he\r\nhad created the mountains and lakes of Ireland; he had only developed the\r\njoint ownership, which the Irish tenant possessed in his holding, in\r\nthousands of instances, if he had developed it under the very worst\r\nconditions. This theory, however, at which Burke would have laughed with\r\ncontempt, and which revealed the incapacity to understand Irish land\r\ntenure, ingrained, it would appear, in the English mind, was eagerly taken\r\nup and found much support; it was resolved to extend the process of\r\nconverting tenants in Ireland into owners of their farms, by a method\r\nhitherto untried, and unknown in any part of Europe. Under the Church\r\nDisestablishment Act, and the Land Acts of 1870 and 1881, the State had\r\nadvanced money to the occupier of the Irish soil, in order to enable him\r\nto acquire his farm; but it had made it incumbent on him to contribute\r\npart of the price; the transaction, therefore, was, in a real sense, a\r\npurchase. This, the only security for honesty and thrift, was taken away\r\nin 1885; Parliament passed an Act enabling the Irish tenant to become\r\nowner of his holding without paying down a shilling; the State was to\r\nadvance the whole price; and the State was to be repaid by a terminable\r\nannuity, charged on the land, and extinguished at the end of less than\r\nhalf a century. This terminable annuity was to be much less than a true\r\nrent, or even than a 'fair rent' adjusted by the State; the transaction,\r\ntherefore, was not a purchase, but a gift, akin to a bribe, another\r\nlargess bestowed on the tenant class in Ireland, and another injury, as I\r\nshall prove, inflicted on the Irish landed gentry. This 'Land Purchase,'\r\nas it was falsely called, was to be voluntary on the part of landlord and\r\ntenant; it was to be conducted on the footing of free contract, as had\r\nbeen the case under the preceding statutes; the State was to obtain a\r\nguarantee from the landlord; and Parliament voted L5,000,000 to carry out\r\nthis policy.\r\n\r\nExactly as had happened in the case of the Encumbered Estates Act, this\r\nscheme of 'Land Purchase' was pronounced successful; some scores of\r\nlandlords sold land, some hundreds of tenants bought it; the real nature\r\nof the proceeding and its inevitable results were ignored; it was even\r\nboasted that 'dual ownership' would be got rid of, nay, that the Irish\r\nLand Question was being finally 'settled.' But when the first sum of\r\nL5,000,000 had been expended, and Parliament was asked to vote a second\r\nsum, it began to hesitate as to this dealing with the Irish land; the\r\nBritish taxpayer demurred and growled; with a true instinct he disliked\r\nthe security; it was found very difficult to procure the funds required,\r\nlarge as the majority was of Lord Salisbury's Government. His Ministry,\r\nhowever, adhered to the new policy; and Parliament enacted a measure in\r\n1891, which I have always thought unconstitutional in the highest degree,\r\nnot to speak of the evils it was certain to produce. By this Act a sum of\r\nabout L30,000,000 was made forthcoming to facilitate 'Land Purchase,' to\r\nabolish 'dual ownership,' and to change Irish tenants into owners of land;\r\nthis sum was to be secured by the methods before referred to, that is, by\r\nterminable annuities less than any equitable rent, and by guarantees on\r\nthe part of selling landlords; but, furthermore, a whole series of funds,\r\ndevoted to Ireland, for Irish purposes, and absolutely essential to her\r\nmost important needs, were appropriated to make good any default on the\r\npart of 'purchasing' tenants, in the payment of annuities charged on their\r\nfarms; and even the Irish counties were rendered liable in the last\r\nresort. Should, therefore, tenants in Ireland, who had acquired the\r\nownership of their farms, refuse to pay those annuities on any pretence,\r\nsay, through an appeal made by a Land League conspiracy--the manifesto\r\nagainst all rent cannot be forgotten--this extraordinary spectacle would\r\nthen be seen: the State would have a right to seize upon the grants made\r\nfor National schools and lunatic asylums throughout Ireland; these\r\ninstitutions would be shut up; children and madmen would be let loose\r\nthrough the country; and the owner of an Irish estate would have to pay\r\nfor the dishonesty perhaps of his former tenants. The late Lord Randolph\r\nChurchill severely condemned this scheme; I agree with him it was utterly\r\nunjust, and but too characteristic of the contempt of the rights of\r\nIreland, unhappily often displayed by British statesmen.\r\n\r\nOnly a sum, it will be observed, of about L40,000,000, that is, two of\r\nL5,000,000, and some L30,000,000 more, has thus been made available for\r\n'Land Purchase;' this obviously could not transfer even a fourth part of\r\nthe Irish land, valued, we have seen, by Mr. Gladstone at L300,000,000--in\r\na remarkable speech in reply to Lord George Hamilton--and almost certainly\r\nworth from L150,000,000 to L200,000,000. The process of doing away with\r\n'dual ownership' and making tenants in Ireland owners of their farms,\r\nhaving been pronounced by its authors slow, the Act of 1896, referred to\r\nbefore, enabled the landlord's guarantee to be dispensed with, and\r\nprovided that, in the case of hopelessly embarrassed landlords, whose\r\nestates were being offered for sale in the Courts, the tenants should\r\nvirtually have a right of pre-emption, thus asserting a principle, on\r\nwhich I shall dwell afterwards, and known as the 'Compulsory Purchase' of\r\nthe Irish land. I shall point out, in another chapter, the present and the\r\ninevitable future results of this policy of so-styled 'Land Purchase;'\r\nsuffice it to say here, that, in my judgment, it betrays utter ignorance\r\nof the Irish land system, and of the customs and inclinations of the Irish\r\npeasant; that it proceeds on an essentially immoral principle, the bribery\r\nof a class to promote its welfare; that, from the very nature of the case,\r\nit cannot abolish 'dual ownership;' that, human creatures being what they\r\nare, it cannot, as is being already proved, establish a thriving body of\r\noccupying owners on the Irish soil; that it must create sharp and unjust\r\ndistinctions in Irish land tenure, iniquitous to the landlord and to every\r\ntenant, who may be excluded from its benefits; that it must directly tend,\r\nas it is even now tending, to arouse a cry for a wholesale confiscation of\r\nIrish estates, the most shameful and wrongful Ireland has yet witnessed;\r\nand that so far from settling the Irish Land Question, it must necessarily\r\nunsettle it from top to bottom. As respects the legislation I have briefly\r\ndescribed, on the side of the occupation of the Irish land--by many\r\ndegrees the most important--I shall also comment upon its results in a\r\nsubsequent chapter, after examining its administration by the tribunal it\r\nhas set up. But a word may be said, in this place, on its essential\r\ncharacter: from 1881 to the present time, it is absolutely without a\r\nprecedent in civilised lands; it has trampled on economic science and the\r\ntruths it teaches, as, indeed, its chief author made his boast; it has\r\ncreated a mode of land tenure in Ireland not in accord with fact, which\r\nhas virtually deprived the Irish landlord of real ownership in his estate,\r\nhas turned him into a kind of annuitant, and has virtually changed the\r\nIrish tenant into a kind of owner, but under conditions absolutely bad;\r\nits inevitable tendency was to cut down rents wholesale, without regard to\r\nthe simplest justice; it established a system of mischievous litigation\r\nbetween landlord and tenant, demoralising and increasing the division of\r\nclasses; it exhibited, on an enormous scale, characteristic contempt of\r\nIrish rights of property; and finally, if Parliamentary pledges are to be\r\nfulfilled, and gross wrong is not to be consecrated by law, it has given\r\nthe Irish landlord a great and legitimate claim to compensation from the\r\nState. As we survey this unwise and destructive medley of law, we are\r\nforcibly reminded of the words of Burke:--'I am unalterably persuaded that\r\nthe attempt to oppress, degrade, impoverish, confiscate, and extinguish\r\nthe original gentlemen, and landed property of a whole nation, cannot be\r\njustified under any form it may assume.'[87]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE IRISH LAND (_continued_)--THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE\r\nIRISH LAND ACTS\r\n\r\n    The administration of the Land Act of 1870 in the main\r\n    good--Difficulty about claims for tenants' improvements--The\r\n    administration of the Land Act of 1881, and of its supplements--The\r\n    Land Commission and its Sub-Commissions--Allowances to be made for\r\n    these tribunals--Principles which the Land Commission should have\r\n    adopted in fixing 'fair rents'--The procedure and practice it ought to\r\n    have established--It made mistakes as to both--The nature of the\r\n    Sub-Commission Courts--This was objectionable in the highest\r\n    degree--These Courts have, however unconsciously, done grave wrong to\r\n    Irish landlords--Causes of this--Characteristics of their\r\n    proceedings--They disregarded the principles they ought to have\r\n    followed, and adopted faulty and erroneous methods--Different\r\n    illustrations of these grave mistakes--The Land Commission and appeals\r\n    as to 'fair rent'--Importance of this subject--Faulty procedure of the\r\n    Land Commission in appeals--Valuers--The second Land Commission--Its\r\n    procedure worse than that of the first--Theory of occupation\r\n    right--This another wrong done to landlords--The Fry Commission and\r\n    its report--Confiscation of the property of Irish landlords--The\r\n    proofs of this--Apologies made for the Land Commission--The\r\n    administration of the Land Purchase Acts.\r\n\r\n\r\nI turn to the administration of the new Irish Land Code, of which I have\r\ndescribed the distinctive features. The County Courts of Ireland, I have\r\nsaid, were entrusted with the task of carrying out the Land Act of 1870;\r\nthe principal duty of the judges was to determine rights, under the Ulster\r\nand analogous Customs in the south, and to declare the sums to be paid to\r\ntenants, when leaving their holdings, for compensation for improvements,\r\nand in respect of disturbance. As evictions were by no means frequent, in\r\nthe period between 1870 and 1879, the litigation before these tribunals,\r\nunder these different heads, though by no means trivial, was not\r\nexcessive; the applications on the part of tenants were not very numerous;\r\nthere was ample time to consider the law, whether in the subordinate or\r\nthe appellate Courts; and though there was much difference of opinion as\r\nto the amount of compensation to be given to suitors, the administration\r\nof the Act was not seriously impugned,[88] and, on the whole, was\r\nreasonable and just. The most remarkable circumstance in the inquiries\r\nheld before the Courts was, certainly, the extravagance of the claims put\r\nforward, on account of tenants' improvements, circumscribed as these were\r\nby the limitations of the law; everything in the nature of an agricultural\r\nwork was called an improvement, from repairing an old fence to cleaning an\r\nold drain; hours and days were lost in endeavours to disentangle the\r\ntruth, and to arrive at sound and legal conclusions. I could fill scores\r\nof pages with descriptions of demands of this kind, usually pressed with\r\nreckless and hard swearing; they ought to have been a warning, as\r\nunhappily they were not, not to break down the restrictions contained in\r\nthe Act of 1870, and not to extend legislation, in this direction, against\r\nthe rights of the landlord. I confine myself to a single example: I tried\r\na case, in 1895, in which a tenant's claims, under the Act of 1870, were\r\nL1130; I cut these down to L164; after deducting L155 found due to the\r\nlandlord, I adjudged to the tenant a sum of less than L10; and there was\r\nno appeal from the decision I pronounced.[89]\r\n\r\nThe Land Act of 1870 has been well-nigh superseded by the great measure\r\nof 1881, and by the legislation which has been its supplement. The\r\nadministration of this part of the new Land Code, by many degrees the most\r\nimportant, was given, as I have pointed out before, to a wholly new\r\ntribunal, the Land Commission, and to Sub-Commissions dependent on it; a\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction was given to the Irish County Courts; but they\r\nhave had very little to do in this province. The principal work of the\r\nLand Commission has been to fix 'fair rents,' and to make statutory\r\nleases, 'fixity of tenure,' in a word, in a kind of disguise, and thus to\r\ngive effect to the policy adopted by Mr. Gladstone in 1881. The three\r\noriginal members of the Land Commission, in all respects its directors,\r\nwere the late Mr. Justice O'Hagan, the late Mr. E. F. Litton, and the late\r\nMr. John E. Vernon; Lord Salisbury denounced these appointments in\r\nemphatic language, as being against the just rights of Irish\r\nlandlords;[90] the charge was not without plausible grounds at least, for\r\nMr. Justice O'Hagan had been one of the 'Young Ireland' party, and Mr.\r\nLitton had been a strong tenant-right advocate. These two gentlemen,\r\nnevertheless, were most honourable men, and capable, if not very\r\ndistinguished, lawyers; Mr. Vernon was an excellent and experienced\r\ncountry gentleman, if, in politics, of the Liberal faith; and as all three\r\nhave long ago passed away, it would be unjust to make charges of\r\nillegitimate conduct, even if they may not have been wholly free from\r\nunconscious bias. Great allowance ought to be made, in common justice, for\r\nthe Commissioners in the situation that had been made for them, and regard\r\nbeing had to their most arduous duties. To fix 'fair rent,' even\r\napproximately, was difficult in the extreme; as Judge Longfield predicted\r\nmany years before, and every well-informed Irishman knew, the adjustment\r\nof rent, through the agency of the State, would inevitably cause a general\r\nlowering of rents. Again, the Commissioners were, from the outset,\r\nharassed by a rush of applications to fix 'fair rents;' these came in,\r\nwithin a few weeks, in thousands; they were tempted, therefore, to set\r\nabout their work at once, without taking the careful precautions, or\r\nentering into all the considerations, the nature of their duty required.\r\nTwo circumstances, also, no doubt, had effect on their minds; the Land\r\nLeague was creating a Reign of Terror, and destroying the property of the\r\nIrish landlords; the Commissioners probably hoped that they would weaken\r\nthe power of the League, by, so to speak, bidding against it, and cutting\r\nrents down. Above all, the Land Commission, like the Encumbered Estates\r\nCommission, was a tribunal set up to carry out a policy, that is, in word,\r\nto abate rents; and all experience, Irish experience notably, proves that\r\nsuch a body of men usually fulfils its mission.\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, we have seen, had expressed a belief that 'fair rents,' as\r\na rule, would be fixed by contract; that the Act of 1881 would produce\r\nthis result; and that this part of the work of the Land Commission,\r\naccordingly, would not be very great. Unquestionably, too, with his\r\nleading followers, he was convinced that rents in Ireland would not be\r\nlargely reduced;[91] it is important to bear this distinctly in mind,\r\nregard being had to subsequent events. These anticipations were to prove\r\nvain; but the Land Commissioners possibly may have shared his views, and\r\nmay have resolved to act upon them, before they first addressed themselves\r\nto the task of 'fixing fair rents.' After experience, it is easy to be\r\nwise; but we can now clearly discern what they ought to have done,\r\nconsidering the heavy work they were soon to find imposed on them. Their\r\nfirst duty should have been to establish some standard, which would make a\r\nreasonable criterion of rent; the means to accomplish this end were not\r\nwanting. Mr. Law, the Irish Attorney-General of Mr. Gladstone, one of the\r\nmost distinguished lawyers of his day, and afterwards a holder of the\r\nGreat Seal of Ireland, had made a definition of 'fair rent' in the House\r\nof Commons; 'a fair rent was to be a competition rent minus the yearly\r\nvalue of the tenant's interest in the holding; that was what was intended,\r\nand anything else would be monstrously unjust.'[92] For some reason that\r\nhas not transpired, this definition did not find a place in the Act; but\r\nthe authority of its framer was great; it must have been known to the Land\r\nCommissioners; had they adopted it, and based their decisions upon it,\r\nthings would have been very different from what they are at the present\r\ntime. But there were other tests to indicate a standard of rent, to be\r\nregarded at least, if not conclusive. The valuation of the lands of\r\nIreland made for the assessment of rates, Griffith's valuation, as it was\r\ncommonly called, which Parnell had made a measure of 'fair rent,' would\r\ncertainly have been of real use, though it varied greatly in different\r\ncounties; and the Commission appointed by Mr. Gladstone, only a few months\r\nbefore, had, I have said, reported, that Ireland, as a whole, was in no\r\nsense an over-rented land. There was another consideration, as regards\r\nIrish rents, which the Land Commissioners ought to have borne in mind. The\r\nrents on the estates of the great landlords, and of the gentry of old\r\ndescent, were, as a rule, low; the rents of the purchasers under the\r\nEncumbered Estates Acts were high, nay, excessive, in not a few instances.\r\n\r\nOther circumstances, moreover, of great importance, ought to have been\r\ntaken into account, with respect to this subject. The rental of Ireland\r\nwas not as high as it had been before the Great Famine; where rents,\r\ntherefore, had not been increased, and had been regularly paid for a long\r\nseries of years, there was the strongest possible presumption that these\r\nwould be 'fair.' Again, the material progress of Ireland had been great\r\nduring the forty preceding years: the wages of labour had, indeed, risen;\r\nbut owing to the introduction of good farm machinery, the cost of\r\nproduction, in agriculture, had diminished; the extension of the railway\r\nsystem had opened new markets, and had brought even Connaught within a few\r\nhours of Great Britain; steam navigation had multiplied and improved; the\r\nmodes of husbandry and the breeds of stock of all kinds had become\r\ninfinitely better than they had been; and prices of late had been very\r\nhigh. These were all elements to be regarded in the determination of 'fair\r\nrent;' they ought to have been examined with care; and inquiries on these\r\nmatters should have extended over a long space of time. Moreover, as the\r\nLand Act of 1881 discharged improvements made by tenants from rent, as\r\nthese were defined and limited by the Act of 1870, the greatest pains\r\nought to have been taken that claims for exemption should be strictly\r\ndealt with, and not permitted to run riot, especially as it was notorious\r\nthat demands of this kind, made under the law already in force, were\r\nusually excessive, supported by untrue statements, and by no means easy to\r\nresist and disprove. Another fact, also, of the gravest moment, ought to\r\nhave been thoroughly considered, as regards this question. As improvements\r\nmade by tenants were not to be charged with rent, it was but equitable\r\nthat the lands they might hold should be valued as if in their normal\r\nstate; that if these had been deteriorated, either through wilful\r\nmisconduct, or gross neglect, their occupiers were not to make profit of\r\ntheir own wrong; that deterioration, in a word, was not to be allowed to\r\nwork rent down, and was to be taken into account, in adjudicating upon\r\n'fair rent.' This was the more necessary because it was well known that\r\nnumbers of farms in Ireland had been more or less run out; and especially\r\nbecause, as in the case of the ryot of Bengal, under the Permanent\r\nSettlement of Lord Cornwallis, an Irish tenant would be strongly tempted\r\nto injure his lands, if he believed that, when 'a fair rent' should be\r\nfixed on them, he would be permitted to take advantage of his own default.\r\nIt should be added that, in the fixing of 'fair rents,' the large sums\r\nwhich, in many instances, Irish landlords had laid out in improving their\r\nestates, notably since the years that succeeded the Famine, ought, as a\r\nmatter of course, to have been kept in mind.\r\n\r\nThese were the general principles which should have guided the Land\r\nCommission in approaching the question of fixing 'fair rent.' There was\r\nnothing in the Act of 1881 to prevent the Land Commissioners, as a Court\r\nof first instance, adjudicating directly in cases of this kind, or to\r\ncompel them to refer these to their Sub-Commissions; indeed the plain\r\nintention of the law was in a contrary sense. Had the Land Commissioners\r\nadopted this course--and this, I venture to say, was their obvious\r\nduty--they would, no doubt, have considered the questions before them at\r\nlength, and with close attention; have made their inquiries go back many\r\nyears, and have laid down, in elaborate judgments, the maxims and rules to\r\nbe applied in the fixing of 'fair rent.' The evidence that would have\r\ncome before them would have been of two kinds: that which depended upon\r\nthe statements of valuers, on the side of landlords and tenants alike;\r\nthis, of course, would be of great importance; but it should have been\r\nborne in mind that it would be biassed evidence; and that, in the existing\r\nstate of Ireland, and of Irish opinion, the statements of tenants' valuers\r\nwould require to be strictly watched. The other head of evidence was of a\r\nmuch more trustworthy kind; it was indicated by the circumstances of the\r\ncases being heard, and was necessarily suggested by the inquiries\r\nthemselves. This class of evidence would be desired from a consideration\r\nof the rate of rent in the neighbourhood or even of adjoining lands, in a\r\nword, of what may be called the market price of rent; from an examination\r\nof what a reasonable rent would be, payable by a solvent tenant to a\r\nfair-minded landlord; and even from a review of rent fixed by the\r\ncompetition of bidders for land, these circumstances, in every given case,\r\nbeing, of course, controlled by a due regard being had, in the words of\r\nthe law, for the 'tenant's interest.' There was another and very important\r\ntest; the sums paid in Ulster and elsewhere on the transfer of farms were\r\nusually large, sometimes not less than a third or even a half of the value\r\nof the fee simple; and as these sums were always subject to the existing\r\nrents, the first charges on the lands being sold, this would afford a\r\nstrong presumption that such rents would be 'fair.' No doubt the Act of\r\n1881 declared that such payments were not to be taken into account, _per\r\nse_, and apart from other considerations in the actual fixing of rent, so\r\nfar as regards a given farm; but the law certainly allowed--and it has\r\nalways been so held--that payments of this kind might be kept in view in\r\nforming, generally, an estimate of what a 'fair rent' should be.[93]\r\n\r\nThe Land Commissioners, but from a different point of view, might have\r\nlearned something from Parnell in this matter. They were, no doubt,\r\nharassed by the prospect of the task before them; but had they taken a\r\ncertain number of 'test cases,' and investigated them as a Court of first\r\ninstance, they would have laid down principles to be followed in the\r\nfixing of 'fair rent;' have explained these in well-considered judgments,\r\ngoing over the whole field of inquiry; and, so far as in them lay, have\r\ntried to do justice. Even if they had not adopted this course, one of\r\ntheir members, as the Act of 1881 provided, might have taken part for some\r\ntime with their subordinates in the adjustment of rent; this would have\r\nbeen in accord with Mr. Gladstone's assertions that the Land Commission\r\nwas to be the real arbiter of rent. Unfortunately the Commissioners acted\r\nquite otherwise; their conduct, palliate as you may, was an abdication of\r\na plain duty, on the plea that they were overwhelmed by the work before\r\nthem. Not one of them ever sat in a Court of first instance to fix 'fair\r\nrents;' they delegated this the most important of all their functions to\r\ntheir Sub-Commissions, to which they thus committed the charge of\r\nadjusting rent throughout the whole of Ireland. These Sub-Commissions\r\nformed Courts, each composed of three members, one a legal Commissioner\r\nand two laymen; the Sub-Commissioners were nominees of the Government,\r\nwhether appointed on the recommendation of the Land Commission or not is\r\nnot certain; the only qualifications for the legal Commissioners were that\r\nthey should be barristers or solicitors of six years' standing, and for\r\nthe lay Commissioners that they should have some knowledge of land. These\r\nwere strange tribunals to deal with property worth hundreds of millions;\r\nbut this was only a part of what must be called a scandal most\r\ndiscreditable to those responsible for it. The Sub-Commissioners, one and\r\nall, were much underpaid; their salaries were inadequate to secure fitting\r\nmen; and, one and all, they were at the sufferance of the men at the\r\nCastle, liable to be dismissed at a moment's notice, and without the\r\nindependence which is the best guarantee of justice. Some of the\r\nSub-Commissioners, indeed, were only paid for the job, by the day; they\r\nhad, therefore, a direct personal interest to reduce rents, in order to\r\nmake work for themselves and to retain their places. Even in Ireland such\r\ntribunals were never set on foot, since Cromwell assembled his Courts of\r\nClaims to give their sanction to his huge forfeitures; that they were ever\r\nthought of is one of the many proofs of the disregard shown to property in\r\nland in Ireland. No wonder that it was significantly remarked: 'The whole\r\nspirit of our judicial institutions suggests that officers with such\r\nextensive powers should be selected with the greatest care and with\r\nreference to their possession of high qualifications, and that they should\r\nbe placed in a position of independence, and should, so far as possible,\r\nbe lifted above the suspicions that surround them.'[94]\r\n\r\nSixty or seventy officials of this type--the number was afterwards largely\r\nincreased--were thus, in the significant words of one, 'let loose over\r\nIreland' to deal with estates; it is very remarkable that they have never\r\nreceived instructions from the Land Commission how to perform their\r\nduties. The procedure of the Courts of the Sub-Commissions was, under\r\nexisting conditions, as well devised as could be fairly expected. The\r\nthree Commissioners, who formed a Court, nearly always sate together, and\r\nheard the evidence brought before them as to what were 'fair rents;' the\r\nlegal Commissioner decided questions of law; and, this evidence having\r\nbeen taken, the two lay Commissioners inspected the farms, the subjects of\r\nthe previous inquiries, and having conferred with their legal colleague,\r\ndetermined with him what should be their 'fair rents.' This was the\r\nordinary if not the universal practice; if some deviations have been made\r\nfrom it, these cannot be deemed of very great importance. Grave complaints\r\nhave been made, in not a few instances, of the lay Commissioners, when\r\nengaged in examining lands; it has been said that they often neglected and\r\n'scamped' their work; but these charges have been hardly, if at all,\r\nsustained; my own experience--and it is tolerably large--is that the\r\nCommissioners performed their functions with diligence and care, and\r\nsometimes gave proof of real knowledge of husbandry.[95] But it was\r\nutterly impossible that tribunals of this kind, not composed of experts of\r\na high order, dependent upon the breath of the Castle, without regulations\r\nto direct their conduct, and acting, without concert, in many districts,\r\ncould adjust rent in a satisfactory way, and in conformity with true\r\nmethods, especially as the work they had to do was excessive; indeed, they\r\nsometimes fixed 'fair rents' by dozens in a day. It was equally impossible\r\nthat the Sub-Commissions--and to do their members justice they never made\r\nthe attempt--could take into account all the manifold and far-reaching\r\nelements which enter into the question of 'fair rent,' and could set\r\nforth, in exhaustive judgments, the principles applicable to a most\r\nintricate problem. On the contrary, as a rule, and no doubt wisely, they\r\navoided topics which might have tasked the highest judicial powers; they\r\ndecided the cases before them summarily, and with little reflection,\r\ncertainly without the protracted examination required to establish settled\r\nrules and doctrines. And the result has been that they disregarded, and\r\neven set at nought, a whole series of considerations, of supreme\r\nimportance, with reference to the fixing of 'fair rent;' and, however\r\nunconsciously and innocently, they have been the authors, in the first\r\ninstance at least, of the gravest injustice, and of wrong, done wholesale,\r\nto the landed gentry of Ireland.\r\n\r\nTo make this plain, let us glance back at the principles which assuredly\r\nought to have been kept in view, in coming to sound conclusions on the\r\nsubject of 'fair rent.' It will be seen that the Sub-Commissioners either\r\ngave little or no attention to these, or directly violated them in,\r\nperhaps, tens of thousands of cases. They have never attempted to\r\nestablish some kind of standard, which would form a general measure of\r\n'fair rent;' they have completely ignored the definition of Mr. Law,\r\nprecise and most valuable as it was; they have treated 'Griffith's\r\nvaluation' as though it did not exist; they have regarded the Report of\r\nMr. Gladstone's Commission, declaring that Ireland was not excessively\r\nrented, as mere waste paper; they have apparently taken hardly any account\r\nof the well-known distinction between the low rentals of the great and old\r\nlandlords, and the rack-rents too often exacted by purchasers under the\r\nEncumbered Estates Acts. So, too, it would seem, they have refused to\r\nconsider the strong presumption that rents would be 'fair' if not raised\r\nduring a long series of years, and if reasonably well paid, within that\r\nperiod; and they certainly have given no real weight, as an element in\r\nadjusting rent, to the agricultural progress made by Ireland since the\r\nGreat Famine. Innumerable complaints have been made against their\r\ndecisions as to the exemption of tenants' improvements from rent; but my\r\nbelief is that they gave great attention to this subject; the wrong that\r\nhas been done was owing to the difficulty of the law, and of its\r\napplication to given cases; and the law, besides, was not, I think, just.\r\nOn the correlative and most important question of the deterioration of\r\nfarms through the default of tenants, they have hardly ever inquired into\r\nthis; they have repeatedly done the landlords wrong; they have made grave\r\nand palpable mistakes; and in many instances they have made no allowances\r\nfor the expenditure of landlords upon their estates. Having thus refused\r\nto follow the principles which ought to have been their guide, they have\r\nwidely deviated in the actual fixing of 'fair rents' from rules and\r\nmethods they should have observed and made effective. They have given too\r\nmuch weight to the class of evidence that was least important and most\r\nopen to question; they have attached little and sometimes no value to the\r\nclass of evidence by far the most trustworthy, and that ought to possess\r\nthe greatest influence. This has especially been the case, as we shall\r\nsee, with respect to the sums paid on the transfer of farms, the strongest\r\npossible indication that their rents must be 'fair,' on the ordinary\r\nprinciples of human nature, and giving the purchasers credit for the\r\nsimplest common sense.\r\n\r\nThese are grave charges against quasi-judicial bodies; let us see if they\r\nare not completely justified. The Sub-Commissioners, I have said, have\r\ntaken no heed of Mr. Law's definition of 'fair rent;' but they have acted\r\nas though they set it at defiance; they have ignored the principle of\r\ncompetition in fixing 'fair' rents. Unquestionably, as Mr. Law pointed\r\nout, a deduction should be made from a competition rent, regard being had\r\nto 'the tenant's interest,' that is, to his rights in respect of\r\nimprovements, and perhaps to his rights on account of his tenure, a lease\r\nrenewable every fifteen years, when a 'fair rent' is being fixed on his\r\nfarm; but why the very idea of competition, that is, of market value, was\r\nto be excluded as an element in estimating 'fair rent,' is what men of\r\ncommon sense have never understood. This, in fact, was a portentous\r\nmistake, with consequences of a far-reaching kind; you might as well argue\r\nthat because two partners had an interest in a fee simple estate, or two\r\npeasants had each a share in a cow, the price of the land or the cow was\r\nnot to depend on what would be given for it at an auction mart or a county\r\nfair. Yet this was a position the Sub-Commissions have always taken; they\r\nhave always insisted that competition had nothing to do with 'fair rent.'\r\nThe evidence on this subject is conclusive; I can only take a few samples\r\nfrom the statements of a cloud of witnesses, who really seem to make a\r\nboast of their faith. Colonel Bayley, a Sub-Commissioner of large\r\nexperience, has laid it down that the 'difference between a competition\r\nrent and the fair rent would be more than 20 per cent.; it would, I\r\nthink, be more than that; there would be between 30 and 75 per cent.\r\ndifference between the fair rent and the competition rent.'[96] Mr.\r\nRoberts, another Sub-Commissioner, has deposed to much the same effect:\r\n'Decidedly, I believe that if the land was put in the market it would\r\nbring 25 per cent. more than the rent I put on.'[97] So, too, Mr. Bailey,\r\na legal Sub-Commissioner, very much respected, has alleged: 'It would be\r\nmost misleading to take the evidence of letting value in the\r\nneighbourhood, thus bringing in competition value, which we rigorously\r\nexclude in fair-rent cases.'[98] Mr. Bomford, a well-known\r\nSub-Commissioner, has said, in much the same sense: 'We do not take the\r\ncompetition rent, and cannot take it into consideration, when fixing what\r\nthe fair rent should be. Then you utterly exclude, when you come to the\r\nfixing of the fair rent, the element of competition?--Yes, except in one\r\nmatter, when we have town parks.'[99]\r\n\r\nLet us now see what distinctions, in fixing 'fair rents,' the\r\nSub-Commissioners have drawn between landlords whose rentals were low and\r\nlandlords whose rentals were really high; and how they have dealt with\r\nrents, paid for a long space of time, without having been raised; this is\r\na fair index of the equity of their proceedings. It should be remarked, at\r\nthe outset, that it soon appeared that rents had only been increased in\r\ncomparatively few instances, going back over a series of years; yet, as a\r\nrule, nearly all rents were indiscriminately reduced. No attempt has been\r\nmade, by any official of the Land Commission, to answer this damaging\r\ncharge made, in 1897, at a judicial inquiry held upon the subject: 'The\r\nresult of that calculation, the accuracy of which cannot be challenged,\r\nshows that, as the result of all the cases that were heard, in only 8 per\r\ncent. of them was any increase of rent for many years prior to 1881\r\nproved. But whether the Sub-Commissioners are dealing with an estate on\r\nwhich for centuries the rents had remained unchanged, and on which the\r\ntenants had been fairly treated, or whether they were dealing with estates\r\nthat had come into the hands of speculators by purchase in the Landed\r\nEstates Court, in all cases the average result was the same. They deducted\r\nsomething between 15 and 20 per cent. from the existing rent, no matter\r\nhow long it had existed, and no matter upon what estate it was being\r\npaid.'[100] This significant evidence, too, points to the same conclusion:\r\n'There is nothing to justify the reductions that have been made in the\r\nrents of good landlords, who did not raise their rents in the good years.\r\nIn fact, the landlords who did raise their rents got off a great deal\r\nbetter, at the hands of the Sub-Commissioners, than the good landlords who\r\ndid not raise them.'[101] And Mr. Lecky, a calm-minded observer, if there\r\never was one, has added these striking and pregnant remarks: 'The\r\nlandlords who have suffered least have probably been those who simplified\r\ntheir properties by the wholesale evictions, the harsh clearances, that\r\ntoo often followed the Famine. Next in the scale come those who exacted\r\nextreme rack-rents from their tenants. These rents had been received for\r\nmany years, and though they were ultimately reduced more than rents which\r\nhad been always low, they still, in innumerable instances, remained higher\r\nthan the others. The large class who regarded land simply as a source of\r\nrevenue, and, without doing anything harsh, or extortionate, or unjust,\r\ntook no part in its management, have suffered very moderately. It is the\r\nimproving landlord, who took a real interest in his estate, who sank large\r\nsums in draining and other purposes of improvement, who exercised a\r\nconstant and beneficent influence over his tenants, who has suffered most\r\nfrom the legislation that reduced him to a mere powerless rent-charger,\r\nand, in most cases, rendered the sums he had expended an absolute\r\nloss.'[102]\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Commissions dealt with the subject of the exemption of tenants'\r\nimprovements from rent, on the whole, as fairly, I think, as could be\r\nexpected; and on the different questions of law that arose, appeals ran\r\nfrom them to the Land Commission, which usually investigated these cases\r\nat length. But this part of the law, really an excrescence on the Act of\r\n1881, was unfair to the landlords, in the circumstances in which they were\r\nplaced; they were confronted by innumerable and often obsolete and\r\nworthless claims, which they had only seldom the means of refuting; and if\r\nthe demoralisation and false swearing under the Act of 1870 was bad, they\r\nwere infinitely worse under the Act of 1881. A witty Irishman, indeed,\r\nonce said that he could wish no severer punishment for Mr. Gladstone than\r\nto see him in a Sub-Commission Court listening to those wrongful\r\nstatements; the mischief has, of course, been aggravated since the Act of\r\n1896 has made the basis for the exemption larger and more ill-defined. The\r\nSub-Commissions, I have said, were gravely in error, almost, as a rule,\r\nwith respect to the deterioration of land, as an element to be considered\r\nin fixing rent; in this respect gross injustice has been done to\r\nlandlords. There is scarcely any proof that, even in a single instance,\r\nthe Sub-Commissioners valued land 'for fair rent,' as in its normal state;\r\nand yet, assuredly, this was what ought to have been done, if a premium\r\nwas not to be put on misconduct, and because farms had been injured and\r\nexhausted in hundreds, throughout Ireland. The deterioration was usually\r\nof two kinds--wilful waste committed in order to work down rent, and\r\npassive waste caused by negligence and bad farming. Out of many\r\ninstances, under the first head, I shall refer to one; the\r\nSub-Commissioners usually gave little or no attention to wrongs of this\r\nkind; in this instance they enabled the tenant to make money by his own\r\nmisdeeds; they reduced the rent nearly 30 per cent.: 'The dykes were full\r\nof stuff and choked, and the sluice-gate, which we had repaired at our own\r\nexpense, was all choked up, and the water had been left on the land as\r\nlong as it could stay on it. I complained and remonstrated with the\r\ntenant. I sent for Madden, and in Mr. Lyle's presence I stated this to\r\nhim. His answer to me was that he was not such a damned fool as to have\r\nhis land looking well when the Commissioners came to look at it.\r\n\r\n'SIR E. FRY: Did that case come before the Sub-commissioner Court?--It\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n'Did you give evidence of what the tenant said?--Yes, sir....\r\n\r\n'MR. CAMPBELL: I will tell you, sir, what they did.\r\n\r\n'How much did they reduce the first judicial rent?--They reduced the first\r\njudicial rent; they cut it down from L70 10_s._ to L51.'[103]\r\n\r\nAs for passive waste, that is, the bad cultivation of farms, the proof is\r\nconclusive that it has been seldom, if ever, considered by the\r\nSub-Commissions in fixing 'fair rents.' If we bear in mind that many\r\nthousands of acres in Ireland have been well-nigh destroyed by the burning\r\ndone by tenants, and that hundreds of thousands have been run out by\r\nslovenly farming, the injury thus done to landlords has been enormous,\r\nespecially as tenants' improvements have been exempted from rent against\r\nthem; the 'candle,' it has been justly said, 'has been melted down at\r\nboth ends.' I cite two instances, out of hundreds, of the injustice thus\r\ndone; it has been proved over and over again that, in the case of two\r\nadjoining farms, in all respects of the same natural quality, the rent on\r\nthat which was deteriorated was fixed at a much lower rate than the rent\r\non that which was in good heart; in other words, the landlord was\r\ndespoiled of the difference, and the tenant had the benefit of his bad\r\nhusbandry. I take, almost at random, a case in Ulster: 'The Commissioners\r\nalways value the land as they see it. I have two cases on my property in\r\none townland. One tenant was an industrious, hard-working man, who had his\r\nfarm in very good order. The second tenant, his wife had died, he was in\r\npoverty, with a lot of young children, and he himself was not quite \"all\r\nthere.\" These two holdings came at the same time before the\r\nSub-Commissioners, and the rents were cut down in each case. When the\r\nthing was over, I said to Quinn, who was one of the tenants, \"Are you\r\nsatisfied with your reduction?\" \"How can I be satisfied,\" he said, \"when\r\nmy rent is at the same rate as Hurson's rent?\" I looked at the return and\r\nsaw he was quite right.... The deteriorated farm was cut down considerably\r\nmore than the cultivated farm.' Another remarkable case occurred in the\r\nwest: 'I had a case, I think decided this year; a farm that was divided\r\nbetween two sons fifteen or twenty years ago; the father divided the land\r\nbefore I came into the management of the property.\r\n\r\n'Did they get an equal portion? was it divided into halves?--Into halves,\r\nand paid an equal rent.\r\n\r\n'Before the Act of 1881?--Before the Act of 1881.\r\n\r\n'And was the land of uniform quality?--Yes.\r\n\r\n'Had one of these men, before he went into Court, greatly deteriorated the\r\nland?--Yes.\r\n\r\n'Had the other attended to it?--He had attended to it; he looked after the\r\nland very well indeed.\r\n\r\n'What reduction did the man who had deteriorated his half get?--The man\r\nwho had deteriorated his half got 17-1/2 per cent, reduction.\r\n\r\n'What did the other get?--The other got 7-1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\n'The industrious tenant got 7-1/2?--He got 7-1/2.'[104]\r\n\r\nThis was obviously gross and crying injustice; but two apologies have been\r\nmade for acts of this kind. It is said that were a deteriorated farm\r\nrented as if it were in a normal state, the tenant could not afford to pay\r\nthe 'fair rent,' in other words, the landlord is to be despoiled for the\r\ntenant's neglect. It is said again that the Sub-Commissioners are bound to\r\nvalue the land as they find it, and cannot estimate it at its intrinsic\r\nworth, that is, they are under no obligation to ascertain the truth, and\r\ndo their duty. Yet this sophistry has been gravely put forward as a\r\njustification for palpable wrong, through which the property of landlords\r\nhas been filched away wholesale: 'The land to this day has suffered a very\r\nserious deterioration in value; but we did not deal with that as against\r\nthe present tenant ...'[105] 'Have you frequently asked the\r\nSub-Commissioners why they do not attach sufficient importance to\r\ndeterioration?--No, but I heard them saying one reason was that if they\r\nput the rent of the farm as if it had been fairly treated, the tenant\r\nwould not be able to pay that rent now in the deteriorated state.'[106]\r\nThe general result of these proceedings as regards exhausted farms has\r\nbeen thus described: 'My view with reference to deterioration is this. Bad\r\ntenants, who had ill-treated and worn out their land, undoubtedly, in my\r\nopinion, have obtained larger reductions than they would have got had they\r\nfarmed well. Probably the reason is that were the Land Commissioners to\r\nput a rent on the land according to its natural capacity, before a\r\ndeterioration, it would be an impossible rent for a broken-down bad\r\ntenant to pay. This stereotypes the rent in such cases at a figure\r\nunfairly low to the landlord; tends to lower the standard of fair rent\r\ngenerally; is a premium on bad farming; and places tenants under a serious\r\ntemptation to ill-treat their land, so as to secure a larger reduction\r\nfrom the Land Court than otherwise could be obtainable.'[107]\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Commissions appear to have disregarded the just rights of\r\nlandlords in another important respect. Unquestionably, in the great mass\r\nof instances, as is inevitable when the land is held in small farms, the\r\nIrish tenant had made the improvements on his holding; but the landed\r\ngentry, as I have pointed out, had done a good deal since the Great\r\nFamine. There is nevertheless cogent evidence that, in 'fixing fair\r\nrents,' the Sub-Commissions took hardly any account of the expenditure of\r\nlandlords under this head. In the case of the estate of the late Mr.\r\nTalbot Crosbie, one of the best breeders of prize stock in the Three\r\nKingdoms, and a country gentleman of parts and intelligence, these\r\nsignificant facts were conclusively proved: 'Table E gives the cases of\r\neight holdings upon which there was an expenditure by the landlord of\r\nL1936?--Yes.\r\n\r\n'The old rent was L688?--Yes.\r\n\r\n'That was reduced by the Sub-Commissioners to L493?--Yes. A reduction of\r\nabout 30 per cent.\r\n\r\n'Notwithstanding the outlay by the landlord in the interval of nearly\r\nL2000?--Yes, that is it.\r\n\r\n'Table F is a list of eleven farms, on which there was practically no\r\nexpenditure by the landlord?--Quite so, no recent expenditure. That is,\r\nbetween 1863 and 1887?--There was a good deal done in the famine time, but\r\nI did not take account of that.\r\n\r\n'You had no evidence in these eleven cases of expenditure for many years\r\nprior to the fixing of the rent?--No. In these cases the old rents tot up\r\nto L361?--Yes. And the reductions only brought them to L280?--A reduction\r\nof 18 per cent.\r\n\r\n'In other words, on the unimproved farms the reductions only average 18,\r\nwhile on the improved farms they went as high as 30 per cent.?--Quite so.\r\n\r\n'SIR E. FRY: Were these two sets of farms different classes of\r\nfarms?--They were practically of the same class.'[108] In the same way, in\r\nthe case of the estate of Lord Leconfield, a great and excellent landlord\r\nin the County Clare, the Sub-Commission made no real allowance for a sum\r\nof L20,500 expended on twenty-seven farms. 'Am I right in saying that from\r\n1852 to 1881 there was spent by Lord Leconfield L20,500 in these\r\ntwenty-seven cases?--The return speaks for itself. That is the result of\r\nit.' 'No. 4: As an example of the reductions of the Sub-Commissioners were\r\nthe rents put back to what they had been in 1852?--Very nearly. There is a\r\ndifference, I think, of about 1/2 per cent.?--About 1/2 per cent. The rent\r\nin 1852 was L2524, and the judicial rents on these farms was L2632.'[109]\r\n\r\nI pass on to the methods pursued by the Sub-Commissioners in actually\r\nfixing 'fair rents.' As I have said, they usually heard the cases at\r\nlength in Court; they usually devoted attention to them. I do not think\r\nthey set much store on the reports of valuers, on the part either of\r\nlandlords or tenants; they formed their decisions, as a general rule, on\r\nthe inspections made by the lay Commissioners of the lands they visited.\r\nThis was a much better method, as I shall point out afterwards, than that\r\nadopted by their superiors; but obviously inspections of this kind made by\r\nofficials without local knowledge of the farms, which they examined and\r\nvalued, could not be a sufficient, or a satisfactory, way to fix 'fair\r\nrents.' The great error, however, made, in this matter, by the\r\nSub-Commissions--and in this respect they had the countenance of the\r\nhigher tribunal--was that they had little or no regard for the evidence\r\nwhich in adjusting rent was assuredly of the greatest importance. They\r\nrejected, we have seen, the principle of competition in adjudicating on\r\nrent; in fixing the 'fair rents' of holdings before them, they refused to\r\nconsider the rents of the neighbourhood and of adjoining lands, that is,\r\nto consider the price of the market. Yet this was but a trifling compared\r\nto their capital mistake, one that, indeed, can hardly be explained: in\r\ninvestigating the subject of 'fair rent,' they would not take into account\r\nsums paid on the transfer of farms, that is, their tenant right, in other\r\nwords, as an indication of what ought to be their 'fair rents.' If we bear\r\nin mind, as I have said before, that these sums were given subject to the\r\nexisting rents, which always formed the first charge on the lands, it is\r\nmost difficult to understand, as we have seen, how this circumstance did\r\nnot create a very strong presumption that the rents in question must be\r\n'fair' from the very nature of the case, assuming the Irish tenant to be a\r\nrational being. The sums paid for this tenant right were sometimes\r\nenormous, not uncommonly equal to one-third or one-half of the value of\r\nthe fee; I illustrate my meaning from the evidence, taken with reference\r\nto the estate of Lord Downshire, one of the largest and best managed in\r\nUlster: 'What would you say the tenants' interest would be worth on the\r\nDownshire estate?--Well, judging from the average prices obtained by\r\ntenants on transfers, my opinion is that the tenants' interest would be\r\nworth L1,000,000.\r\n\r\n'On the Downshire estate alone?--Yes.\r\n\r\n'Now, could that value in the tenants, or that interest in the tenants,\r\nexist, unless the rents at which they were holding were low rents?--No,\r\nthe prices of tenant right are incompatible with high rents. Does it in\r\nyour opinion point to their being lower than the commercial rents?--Yes,\r\nthey are lower.'[110] And will it be believed that on this very estate, in\r\nthe case of thirteen farms, held at the rents fixed by the landlords, the\r\ntenant right realised L7296, and yet the Sub-Commission reduced the rents\r\nmore than 20 per cent.? In other words, they declared that the old rents\r\nwere not fair, though these lands, when transferred, fetched L7296 paid by\r\ntheir purchasers, subject to the rents in question![111]\r\n\r\nThe Downshire was only one of many scores of estates in which the tenant\r\nright was exceedingly high, that is, the sums paid, at existing rents, on\r\nthe transfer of farms, were very great, yet in all these instances this\r\nstriking fact was not taken into account. It cannot cause surprise that,\r\nat a judicial inquiry held afterwards to review the subject, tenants'\r\nadvocates endeavoured to exclude the evidence which, in the judgment of\r\nplain men of sense, affords almost a decisive indication as to whether\r\ngiven rents are 'fair.' It has been argued, however, that the price of\r\ntenant right, that is, the sums paid by incoming to outgoing tenants, on\r\nthe sale of farms, at the current rents, ought to form no element in the\r\nfixing of 'fair rent;' it is only just to set forth the reasons. Mr.\r\nBailey, the able legal Sub-Commissioner, referred to before, has explained\r\nthem in this passage: 'Do you attend to tenant right in considering the\r\nfair rent?--No, we do not. The view we take of it is this. The tenant\r\nright paid for land is paid for something of an altogether different\r\ncharacter from the rent of the land.... When a tenant sells his interest\r\nin his holding, he sells two things, first, the improvements on the\r\nholding, and secondly, his goodwill or share of the gross product of the\r\nholding.... When you put these two items together, viz. improvements and\r\ngoodwill, it seems to me that the prices paid for tenant right are not at\r\nall remarkable. Then your view is that the price paid for tenant right\r\nthrows no light on what the fair rent ought to be?--No, no light at all.'\r\nMr. Bailey has added these significant words: 'The tenant does not buy at\r\nthe rent which the tenement at present stands at, but he buys with a\r\npossible increase or reduction of the rent?--Quite so. And in latter years\r\nwith the fall of prices he was buying with the expectation of a very\r\nconsiderable reduction?--Undoubtedly.'[112]\r\n\r\nThe first of these arguments appears to me to be wholly irrelevant to the\r\nreal question. Undoubtedly the tenant right of a farm represents the\r\ntenant's improvements and his interest in the land, and is completely\r\ndistinct from the rent; and this is acquired on a sale by an incoming\r\ntenant. But the purchaser buys the tenant right, subject to the first\r\ncharge, the rent; if the rent were excessive, or even high, either he\r\nwould not buy at all, or he would pay a low price; when, therefore, we\r\nfind the tenant right commanding very large sums, the conclusion is\r\ninevitable, that, taking human nature as it is, the rent must be in the\r\nnature of a 'fair rent.' The Sub-Commissions rejected a plain inference\r\nthey ought to have drawn; that they refused to give weight to an\r\nall-important fact cannot be justified in any sense; and the result has\r\nbeen that in hundreds of cases they have done grave wrong to landlords. As\r\nfor the second argument, it is very probable that in many instances\r\ntenants purchased farms in the anticipation of a reduction of rent; they\r\nspeculated--a significant fact--that the Sub-Commissions would 'bear' the\r\nmarket; but even, on that supposition, this can hardly explain the huge\r\nsums paid for tenant right while the existing rents were current. For the\r\nrest, I refer to part of my own evidence given on this subject at the same\r\ninquiry; readers of ordinary intelligence may judge for themselves: 'The\r\nfirst question I ask the tenant is, \"How much will you take for the land,\r\nL100, L200, L300; ten, fifteen, twenty, or forty years' rent?\" But I never\r\ncan get an answer. They say, \"Oh, your honour, I am here to look after a\r\n'fair rent,' and I am not going to tell your honour what I am going to ask\r\nfor the land.\" However, I have a very shrewd notion.... You take into\r\nconsideration in fixing the fair rent the price paid by the tenants?--Yes,\r\nthe price which an incoming tenant would give, because I am not one of\r\nthose who think that the Irish tenant is a fool; and when I find an\r\nincoming tenant giving ten, fifteen, twenty, and thirty years' purchase\r\nfor a farm, I have a very shrewd suspicion that the rent is right.'[113]\r\n\r\nIt was under these conditions, and by proceedings of this kind, that the\r\nSub-Commissions, bodies of ill-paid men, dependent upon the will of the\r\nGovernment, and constituted to give effect to a policy, were sent\r\nthroughout Ireland to 'fix fair rents.' They had no assistance, we have\r\nseen, from the Land Commission; they often entertained very different\r\nviews; but their uniform course was in the same direction; they\r\nindiscriminately abated rents, as they would abate a nuisance. In fact,\r\nthey might have joined in the chorus of the doctors of Moliere: 'Et\r\nsaignare, et purgare, et clysteriasaire;' they applied the same remedies\r\nto all their victims, and brought them nearly all into the same weak and\r\nlow condition. But there was a right of appeal from the Sub-Commissions to\r\nthe Land Commission; and this tribunal, certainly designed to have\r\nabsolute power in the determination of rent, ought surely to have been\r\nexpected to redress injustice. I approach a part of the subject on which\r\nthe plain truth must be told, without making personal imputations of any\r\nkind. Appeals from the Sub-Commissions were numbered by many thousands;\r\nand, as I have said--an iniquitous provision of the Act of 1881--the\r\ndecisions of the Land Commission on the subject of 'fair rent' was made\r\nfinal, at least as regards the rate of rent; there was to be no further\r\nappeal to a higher tribunal. I quote these significant remarks on this\r\nrestriction: 'In an ordinary case, I need not tell you, sir, who are\r\nconversant with the procedure of Courts of Justice, a litigant, in a civil\r\ncase, no matter how much the issue may be involved, has the right, if he\r\nthinks fit, of taking the case from one Court to another, until he reaches\r\nthe highest tribunal of the land, the House of Lords. And as you know,\r\nthere is a well-known case, which the House of Lords had to decide, in\r\nwhich the amount involved was one penny, an alleged overcharge on a\r\nrailway ticket; but in these land cases, where there may be, and often is,\r\na sum of L200, L300, or L400 a year involved, because in some of the large\r\nfarms in this country there have been reductions of L300 and even of L400\r\nin the rent, under the Act of Parliament they cannot go beyond the Head\r\nLand Commission, upon any question of value. That is the Act of Parliament\r\nwhether it be right or wrong. There it is, and I am not here to discuss\r\nthe policy of the Act. But when a rehearing is given by the Act of\r\nParliament to the Land Commission, and when the Land Commission are\r\nconstituted the final judges in such large and important matters, it is\r\nobviously of great importance that the final rehearing should be full, and\r\nin every respect what the Act of Parliament says it is to be, namely, a\r\nrehearing.'[114]\r\n\r\nThe Land Commission sometimes heard these appeals at length, though\r\nusually their proceedings were summary in the extreme. The Commissioners\r\noccasionally pronounced well-considered judgments, on the difficult\r\nquestions of law that came before them, especially as regards the\r\nexemption of tenants' improvements from rent; in several instances the\r\nresults were curious. The lay Commissioner now and then dissented from his\r\nlegal colleagues; his plain common sense rejected theories in tenants'\r\ninterests; his decisions were more than once confirmed, on these points of\r\nlaw, by the highest Court of Appeal in Ireland, a circumstance of no\r\nslight significance. Nineteen-twentieths, however, of these appeals were\r\nconversant only with the amount of 'fair rent,' as to which the\r\nconclusions of the Land Commission could not be challenged. The Land\r\nCommissioners undoubtedly heard these cases, and sometimes had much\r\nevidence brought before them; in tolerably many instances they varied the\r\n'fair rents' fixed by the Sub-Commissions, if these variations were seldom\r\nimportant. But the Land Commission practically adopted, with scarcely a\r\nsingle exception, the errors of principle and the faulty methods which had\r\nmarked the practice and the proceedings of the Sub-Commissions.[115] They\r\nexcluded the element of competition from the subject of 'fair rent;' they\r\nnever attempted to define 'fair rent,' or to establish a standard by which\r\nto gauge it; they disregarded, to a considerable extent at least, the\r\ndistinction between the rentals of the old and the new landlords; they\r\npaid little or no attention to the fact that rents had been paid for many\r\nyears without an increase; they hardly ever took deterioration into\r\naccount, or the expenditure made on their estates by landlords. And in the\r\nactual fixing of 'fair rents' they virtually followed in the wake of their\r\ninferiors; they rejected, as a rule, the evidence that was most relevant;\r\nthey refused to consider the rents of adjoining or neighbouring lands, in\r\na word, the price of the market, in determining rent; above all, they gave\r\nscarcely any heed to the enormous sums paid for the tenant right of lands,\r\nas an indication that their rents were 'fair.' On all these particulars,\r\nin a word, supremely important as they were, they almost said ditto to the\r\nSub-Commissions; in these respects the appeals were well-nigh useless. It\r\nshould be added that the animus of the head of the Land Commission was\r\nsignificantly exhibited on one striking occasion. When opening the\r\nproceedings of the Land Commission, Mr. Justice O'Hagan pointedly laid it\r\ndown, that the object of the Act of 1881 was 'to make tenants live and\r\nthrive;' in other words, as Lord Salisbury indignantly remarked, to compel\r\nrent to gravitate to the level of the most indolent and worthless Irish\r\npeasant, and practically to discourage industry.\r\n\r\nThese considerations indicate, to some extent at least, the nature and\r\nespecially the value of these appeals. But this was not all, or nearly\r\nall; there was a grave miscarriage of the simplest justice in this\r\nimportant province. Appeals, I have said, came in, in thousands; the work\r\nthrown on the Land Commissioners was immense; as one of their present\r\nsuccessors remarked, 'If proper consideration' (had been) 'given to all\r\nthe appeals you would' (have) 'wanted ten Appeal Courts to do it;'[116] as\r\nwas said again substantially, 'Appeals would have crushed the Land\r\nCommissioners, had they not been crushed by them.'[117] In this position\r\nof affairs, the Land Commissioners, no doubt with no bad or sinister\r\npurpose, adopted what must be called a device, to enable them quickly to\r\ndispose of appeals, nay, almost in a summary way. They were empowered,\r\nunder the Act of 1881, to appoint 'independent valuers' to examine lands,\r\nand to report on the subject of their 'fair rents;' it was never\r\ncontemplated that statements of this kind were to dispense with the duty\r\nof hearing appeals in detail, and pronouncing solemn judgments upon them;\r\nbut, practically, the Land Commissioners, in the great mass of instances,\r\nwhen adjudicating on appeals, as regards 'fair rents,' almost wholly\r\nrelied on the reports of these valuers, who, be it observed, were in no\r\nsense witnesses, and were not subject to examination on the part of the\r\nsuitors before the Court. In a word, the Land Commissioners did not\r\nexclude other kinds of evidence; but unquestionably the dicta of the\r\nvaluers, as a rule, determined the decisions they made on 'fair rent.'\r\nThis expedient greatly accelerated appeals; but it reduced the right of\r\nappeal well-nigh to a sham; and this procedure was by many degrees more\r\nrepugnant to justice than that of the Sub-Commissions. In an inquiry held\r\nbefore the House of Lords in 1882, an eminent member of the Irish bar\r\nremarked, 'It was the most unsatisfactory tribunal that I ever was before.\r\nWhat occurred was this: they took up the figures of the old rent, which we\r\nwill say was L100, and the valuation L70, and the new rent L80. Then they\r\ntook up the valuer's report, which was a document concealed from the\r\nparties. It was entirely for the information of the Court, and they turned\r\nround to me, as the landlord's counsel, the landlord being the appellant,\r\nand said, \"Can you go on with this appeal in the face of this document?\"\r\nand they would show me the document.'[118] And in the inquiry I have often\r\nreferred to before, another distinguished lawyer has said, 'I have been in\r\ncases where, in order to overcome the difficulty, I marshalled a perfect\r\nphalanx of witnesses, for the landlord, but it was all no use. They\r\nlistened to them, I admit,--they suggested that I was wasting time, but I\r\nam not stating they did not hear them,--but in the end, in the morning,\r\nthe announcement was made that the judicial rent was confirmed.'[119]\r\n\r\nAs the general result these appeals, as it has been said, 'were\r\nstrangled;' in thousands of instances they were withdrawn, the decisions\r\nof the Land Commission being final; expedition was attained; but it was\r\nonly attained at the cost of gross wrong done to the landlords, a singular\r\nexhibition in a Court of Justice. I quote the following--and it should be\r\nborne in mind that the Land Commissioners have never attempted to explain\r\nthis conduct, though the amplest opportunity was afforded, a few years\r\nago: 'The extraordinary and anomalous state of things is that the valuers,\r\nnot being assessors, do not sit with the Commissioners, and do not hear\r\nthe evidence, and yet they are not witnesses in the proper sense of the\r\nterm, because they are neither examined nor cross-examined. Common sense\r\nand justice revolt at the idea, when it is the duty of the Land\r\nCommissioners, upon the rehearing of a case, to sit and go through the\r\nproceedings _de novo_, that they should receive the evidence of valuers,\r\nwhich is not laid before the parties, and that those valuers should not be\r\nexamined and cross-examined in the regular way. There is another matter to\r\nwhich I would refer. You will find, what is, indeed, what you might\r\nexpect, that when the Commissioners go to Dublin, or Cork, or elsewhere,\r\nwith a list of two or three hundred cases to be heard by them, involving,\r\nit may be, thousands of pounds a year of rent, that list is gone through\r\nin two or three days, and why? Because all the parties present know that\r\nthey are taking part in what really is a solemn farce, and that what will\r\nhappen in the morning after the hearing of their case is just this: John\r\nBrown, landlord, James Fogarty, tenant; judicial rent affirmed; John\r\nRobinson, landlord, James McNorth, tenant; judicial rent affirmed.'[120]\r\n\r\nThe first set of Land Commissioners passed away; they were succeeded by a\r\nsecond Land Commission, the president of which was Mr. Justice Bewley, an\r\naccomplished, if not a very eminent, lawyer. This Commission, like the\r\nother, was composed of honourable men; it is only just to remark that it\r\nwas bound by the bad precedents made by the tribunal which it had\r\nreplaced. The procedure of the Sub-Commissions was, in some degree,\r\nimproved; but the methods of the second Land Commission differed for the\r\nworse where they differed from the methods of its predecessor. The Land\r\nCommissioners appear to have not at all regarded the general principles in\r\nfixing 'fair rent,' which ought to have had effect on their judgments;\r\nthey gave less weight, than Mr. Justice O'Hagan, and his colleagues did,\r\nto the most important evidence, in this province, to which I have adverted\r\nbefore, and laid too much stress on the least important evidence. As has\r\nbeen truly remarked, 'We believe that much more attention was paid in the\r\nearly days of the Land Commission to the remaining kinds of popular\r\nevidence than has been the case of late years; and we are assured by one\r\nof the head Commissioners that the Act of 1896 has made a great change in\r\nthe fixing of fair rents by placing an emphasis on the technical evidence,\r\nand throwing the popular evidence into the background.'[121] The\r\nCommissioners, too, followed the bad example of the first Land Commission,\r\nin the province of appeals; they practically disregarded almost everything\r\nbut the reports of their valuers, unchecked statements made by men who\r\nwere not even witnesses, were not sworn, and were not examined--a\r\nprocedure worthy of the Council of Ten at Venice; as before, the result\r\nwas that appeals were made all but fruitless, in the Court of which the\r\ndecisions were, in this respect, final.\r\n\r\nThere was, too, another grave miscarriage of justice caused, perhaps, by a\r\nmistake made by the head of the second Land Commission. The Act of 1881\r\nprovided that 'fair rent' should be fixed, having due regard to the\r\n'interest' of the tenant on the land, that is, to his improvements, and\r\nperhaps to the mode of his tenure. Mr. Justice Bewley seems to have\r\ndecided that another element ought to be taken into account, and should\r\neffect a reduction of rent; the tenant had 'an occupation right' in his\r\nfavour, over and above the 'interest' the law gave him; by reason of this\r\nhe had a right to have his rent cut down. The only plausible ground\r\nalleged for this doctrine was that landlords would usually accept a lower\r\nrent from a 'sitting' tenant in possession than from an incoming tenant;\r\nin other words, their good nature was turned against them, and was to be\r\nmade a pretext for their being despoiled. It is just to observe that Mr.\r\nJustice Bewley's colleagues dissented from this curious view of the law;\r\nand the claim for 'occupation right' has since been blown to the winds in\r\nthe superior Courts of Ireland. But though many faint denials were made,\r\nsome of the Sub-Commissioners acted upon Mr. Justice Bewley's doctrine;\r\nthe evidence is conclusive that this imaginary right was made the means of\r\nconsiderably reducing rent. Mr. Justice Bewley candidly admitted: 'From\r\nthe commencement, apparently, a number of the Sub-Commissioners have acted\r\non the principle that there is a certain occupation interest, which every\r\ntenant has, varying according to circumstances, not any fixed amount, but\r\nvarying, and that that is to be taken into account in fixing the fair\r\nrent.'[122] This statement has been confirmed by a host of witnesses by no\r\nmeans willing in not a few instances. 'Would you make a difference between\r\nthe assessment of the fair rent in the case of a sitting tenant, and in\r\nthe case of an incoming tenant--a stranger? Certainly. Can you give us any\r\nidea what that difference is, expressed in percentage?--I could not very\r\nwell answer that question. It is a mental calculation, and a good deal\r\nwould depend upon the length of the tenure of the tenant.'[123] And again:\r\n'In your experience of the Land Commission Court, do you find the\r\n\"occupation interest\" has been taken into account in fixing the fair\r\nrent?--Yes, I cannot account for the reductions that have been made,\r\nexcept on that supposition.'[124] And again: 'As far as your experience\r\ngoes, do they invariably value the holdings on the principle of giving an\r\noccupation interest to the sitting tenant?--Yes, the tenants' valuers, as\r\na rule, give 40 or 50 per cent. as the interest of the sitting tenant....\r\nDo you find that the Sub-Commissioners fix the rent on what the valuers\r\nstate?--Well, no; that would be going too much out of the way.'[125] And\r\nagain: 'Have you any doubt that the rents are fixed on the basis of the\r\noccupation interest in the sitting tenant?--I have none. I do not know how\r\nelse the rents could have been arrived at.'[126] And once more: 'Did the\r\nSub-Commissioners invariably take the occupation interest of the sitting\r\ntenant into account?--I think so.' I conclude with these remarks of Mr.\r\nBarnes, one of the best and most impartial of Irish valuers: 'When I came\r\nto give evidence in Court I found that nothing else would be accepted as\r\nevidence unless based on occupation interest. It was almost the first\r\nquestion.... Whenever there was an answer made that the valuation was\r\nbased on what the landlord would get for the land in his own hands, it was\r\ndiscounted at once.'[127] No wonder that it has been alleged by the\r\nhighest authority with respect to this claim, since proved to have been\r\nunfounded, guarded and cautious as the language is: 'There is, however,\r\nreason to believe that this notion of an occupation interest existed in\r\nthe minds of some of the early valuers, and did, in fact, influence them,\r\nand it is very possible that some cases in which the reductions there made\r\nappear startling, may be, in part, attributable to this doctrine.'[128]\r\n\r\nWhat amount of the rental of Ireland was unlawfully cut down owing to the\r\ntheory of 'occupation right,' it is, of course, impossible to ascertain.\r\nReductions of rent, too, were probably unjustly made through the\r\nignorance of the Land Commission as to agricultural matters. I refer to a\r\ngrotesque instance of this: 'You have marked a passage there in the\r\njudgment, which, according to you, shows that owing to their ignorance as\r\nexperts they entirely mistook what six-course rotation meant?--Yes. The\r\nfact is they took it to be the same crop in the whole seventy acres, that\r\ninstead of having so many different crops in this portion of the ground,\r\nit was to be put into one crop for the year, and that is what they call\r\n\"rotation\" in the Court of Rehearing.... It is plain enough, from the\r\nauthorised report of the judgment, that they made that mistake?--It is\r\nclear as possible, and it was upon that that they threw me out. The tenant\r\nhimself knew that it was all absurdity and mistake.'[129]\r\n\r\nA remarkable incident occurred in 1897 which threw a strong, if not a\r\ncomplete, light on the proceedings of the Land Commission and its\r\nSub-Commissions in the adjustment of rent. In 1896 the time had come for\r\nrenewing the first statutory leases, under the Act of 1881; the\r\nCommissioners suddenly made such enormous reductions of rent that persons\r\nwho knew Ireland were simply astounded. The Irish landlords naturally were\r\nindignant; after some hesitation, and with plain reluctance, the\r\nGovernment gave its consent to a very imperfect inquiry. A Commission,\r\npresided over by Sir Edward Fry, a judge of the highest eminence, retired\r\nfrom office, and composed of four additional colleagues, two being\r\nwell-known agricultural experts, was appointed to investigate the subject\r\non the spot; but the scope of the inquiry was limited in the extreme; it\r\nwas confined, in this respect, to examining the procedure and practice\r\nadopted in fixing 'fair rents;' it did not extend to the conduct generally\r\nof the Land Commission and its dependent tribunals. The Commission was\r\nengaged nearly three months in its task; it held its sittings in different\r\nparts of Ireland; it had before it 183 witnesses; and restricted as it\r\nwas in this province, it pronounced, in grave and judicial language, a\r\nmarked censure on the methods that had been followed in fixing 'fair\r\nrents' in Ireland. In fact, Sir Edward Fry and his colleagues confirmed,\r\nin many respects, the charges which I have made with regard to this whole\r\nsystem. No doubt they reported, in very guarded words, 'that they were\r\nunable to conclude that the machinery of the Land Statutes has been\r\nuniformly worked with injustice towards landlords;'[130] but as they\r\npointedly refused to rehear a single case, in which the Land Commission\r\nand the Sub-Commissions had fixed a 'fair rent,' this statement, ambiguous\r\nas it is, is of no real importance. In other particulars the expression of\r\nthese opinions cannot be mistaken; to impartial minds it will appear\r\ndecisive. They evidently thought that such wrong had been done to\r\nlandlords owing to the want of a definition of 'fair rent,' that they\r\nactually framed a definition of their own, in order to establish some kind\r\nof standard; this did not widely differ from that of Mr. Law, which, I\r\nhave said, would have made things very different had it been adopted.[131]\r\nThey pointed out that the Land Commissioners should have assisted the\r\nSub-Commissions in fixing 'fair rents,' and should not have left them\r\n'like ships without a rudder or a compass on a stormy sea;' it is 'a\r\nsubject of regret,' they reported, 'that in the early days of the system\r\nthe Land Commissioners were unable to take a part in the tribunals of\r\nfirst instance; and that the whole original business was left to\r\nSub-Commissions.'[132] They strongly condemned the nature of the\r\nSub-Commission Courts, as being composed of members inadequately paid and\r\nmere tenants at sufferance; and they put forward an elaborate scheme to\r\nmake the administration of justice in these tribunals more above\r\nsuspicion.[133] They evidently believed that the Land Commission and the\r\nSub-Commissions did not give due weight to the class of evidence that was\r\nmost important, and gave too much weight to that which was the least; and\r\nthey made significant observations on this subject.[134] On the whole,\r\nthey arrived at the conclusion that the fixing of 'fair rents' 'gives\r\nopportunity for dissatisfaction, and leaves much more for improvement; ...\r\nand that the settlement of fair rents has been effected in an\r\nunsatisfactory manner, with diversity of opinion and practice, sometimes\r\nwith carelessness, and sometimes with that bias towards one side or the\r\nother which exists in many honest minds.'[135] But their strongest\r\nanimadversion was found in the system, through which, I have said, the\r\nLand Commission really 'strangled' appeals, though in this province its\r\ndecisions were final: 'An almost universal dissatisfaction is expressed\r\nwith regard to these appeals, a dissatisfaction felt by some at least of\r\nthe Commissioners themselves. No witness, with, perhaps, a single\r\nexception, spoke in favour of the existing system.'[136]\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Bewley has retired from office, and has been replaced by Mr.\r\nJustice Meredith, a capable and experienced lawyer. He has done, probably\r\nas much as in him lay, to alleviate some of the wrong done to Irish\r\nlandlords; and for this he has been subjected to violent abuse, especially\r\non the part of an advocate of Ulster farmers, whose tongue is at odds with\r\nhis trade in temperance. But he is bound by the precedents set by those\r\nwho have gone before him; and though the work of the Land Commission is\r\nnow better done than it was before the Report of the Fry Commission\r\nappeared, and its general procedure has improved, little change has been\r\neffected in the reduction of rent in Ireland. The Government, as I have\r\npointed out in a preceding chapter, has made a few administrative reforms\r\nin the composition and the arrangement of the Sub-Commissions; but it has\r\nnot taken a single step to give effect to the recommendations made by the\r\nFry Commission, so far as these are of real importance; it has refused to\r\nlegislate on the subject, and to bring in the measure that was required;\r\nit has even refused to set a further inquiry on foot. The general results\r\nof the labours of the Land Commission and of its subordinate tribunals in\r\nfixing 'fair rents' may be summed up in a very few sentences. According to\r\nthe Report of the Fry Commission, the tenants of rural holdings in Ireland\r\nare about 486,000 in number; 328,720 of these have had 'fair rents' fixed,\r\nbetween August, 1881, and the end of March, 1900.[137] The tenants, who\r\nhave not had 'fair rents' fixed, are probably either tenants of lands not\r\nwithin the Land Acts, or 'future tenants' since 1881-82, or tenants too\r\npoor to pay law costs; but these, perhaps in nine cases out of ten, have\r\nindirectly had the benefit of the law, and have had their rents reduced\r\nlike those of the large majority, by voluntary concessions on the part of\r\nlandlords. The great mass of 'fair rents' has been fixed by the Land\r\nCommission and its dependents, and the proceedings of these tribunals\r\nhave, beyond question, formed a standard for the adjustment of rent;\r\nwhether 'fair rents' have been fixed by the County Courts,[138] or by\r\nagreements between landlord and tenant, they have, in the main, conformed\r\nto the measure established by the Courts set up in 1881. The reductions of\r\nrent made, in every way, in the first statutory leases, were, on an\r\naverage, rather more than 20 per cent. on the old rental;[139] but those\r\non the second statutory leases have been 22 per cent. more,[140] that is,\r\nthe fixing of 'fair rents,' so far as it has gone, has reduced rents\r\nrather more than 42 per cent. It may be asserted, with some confidence,\r\nthat through the operation of the new Irish land code, taking in tenancies\r\nof all kinds, Irish rents have been cut down nearly 40 per cent.; little\r\ndoubt can exist that they are now lower than they were in the day of\r\nWakefield, and in some instances in the day of Arthur Young, when the\r\nprice of Irish agricultural produce was less than half what it is at the\r\npresent time.[141]\r\n\r\nThe agricultural rental of Ireland, therefore, in all probability, has\r\nbeen reduced almost 40 per cent., or will be in a short space of time; and\r\nas long as the present system of fixing 'fair rent' continues, however it\r\nmay be lowered, it will certainly not be raised. The Act of 1881, I have\r\nalready said, would, by itself, necessarily reduce rents; but the faulty\r\nadministration of it, on which I have dwelt, has reduced them far more\r\nthan ought to have been the case. In fact, disguise it as you may, an\r\nimmense confiscation, gradual, indeed, and veiled, but not the less real,\r\nhas been made of the property of Irish landlords, even on the principles\r\nof a bad law; the evidence of this is, I believe, conclusive. Rents have\r\nbeen cut down indiscriminately in the great mass of instances; for\r\nexample, rents in country districts only opened to good markets of late\r\nyears, have been reduced quite as much as rents around Dublin, which had\r\nalmost a monopoly of the best market until about 1855-60. But the proof of\r\nthis spoliation is made most apparent by taking into account a single\r\nfact, and drawing the natural inference from it. The value of the\r\nlandlords' interest in the land, before 1881, was from 20 to 25 years'\r\npurchase; it is now between 15 and 18; at the same time the value of the\r\ntenants' interest has, in thousands of cases, enormously increased. I\r\nrefer to a few examples out of scores to be found in the evidence given to\r\nthe Fry Commission. I take first an estate in Ulster: 'I only remember one\r\ncase of a holding before 1881 that went up (in a sale of the farm) to\r\nanything like 20 years' purchase of the rent, and I have several cases\r\nsince then that have gone beyond it. I remember one case that struck me\r\nvery forcibly because of the great amount the man got--20 years' purchase.\r\nSince then I have known, 29, 35, 36, 34 years' purchase to be given.' I\r\nturn now to two estates in the south of Ireland: 'Charles Bolster, 112\r\nacres; rent L79 5_s._; sold for L570 in 1889. Daniel Buckley, 9 acres, at\r\nrent of L3 3_s._; sold in 1889 for L45. Christopher Crofts, 131 acres; old\r\nrent, L86; judicial rent fixed in 1893, L80; sold in 1889 for L120.\r\nTimothy Reefe, 5 acres; rent, 29_s._; sold in 1891 for L47.' I pass on to\r\nthe second estate: 'Next case, 65 acres; old rent, L60; judicial rent, L56\r\n14_s._, fixed in 1883 by agreement; sold in 1883 for L330. Next, 76\r\nstatute acres; old rent, L115; judicial rent fixed in 1885 at L108; sold\r\nin December, 1885, for L1600.'[142]\r\n\r\nThis great fall in the value of the fee simple in the Irish land, and this\r\ngreat rise in the value of the tenant right, coinciding with the general\r\nfixing of 'fair rents,' distinctly point to a plain conclusion: the\r\ninterest of the Irish landlord has been enormously reduced, a result never\r\ncontemplated by the author of the Act of 1881. In truth, there has been\r\nlittle or no decline in the market price of land in Ireland; but property\r\nthat ought to belong to the landlord has been improperly taken from him,\r\nand has been transferred to the tenant who had no right to it. Excuses,\r\nhowever, have been made for this wholesale abolition of rent; they are\r\nworthless, but may be briefly noticed. Ireland, it is said, is suffering,\r\nlike England, from the agricultural depression of late years; and rents\r\nin Ireland have not been cut down more by the act of the State than they\r\nhave been reduced in England by the voluntary acts of landlords. But\r\nagricultural depression in Ireland, a land of small holdings, and of\r\npasturage, to a considerable extent, is not, by many degrees, as severe as\r\nin England, a land of large farms and largely of cereal culture; a signal\r\nproof of this is that, while in England, tenants have, in hundreds of\r\ninstances, thrown up their farms, there has hardly been a case of the kind\r\nin Ireland, as appears from the Report of the Fry Commission. Besides, if\r\nagricultural prices have fallen in Ireland, compared to what they were,\r\nsay, twenty-five years ago, they are higher than they were in the years,\r\nsay, 1850-55, not to take into account the progress made by Ireland, in\r\nthe last half-century, in crops, farm machinery, and the breeds of farming\r\nanimals. As to the reduction of rents in England and Ireland, the supposed\r\nanalogy completely fails. The rental of England rose greatly from 1850 to\r\n1880; there was no corresponding increase in Ireland; there was thus a\r\nmargin for reduction, in the greater island, which in the lesser did not\r\nexist. Again, no comparison can be made between State-settled Irish rents\r\nand English rents lowered by the voluntary acts of landlords. 'Fair rents'\r\nhave practically been reduced for all time; the reduction of English rents\r\nis temporary, and can be at once annulled; this difference makes a\r\nsupposed resemblance a very striking contrast. As to the argument that the\r\nCourts which have fixed 'fair rents' have been composed of honourable men,\r\nand that it is extremely invidious to make charges against them, mere\r\nleather and prunella may be brushed aside. No one disputes the honour of\r\nthe Land and the Sub-Commissioners, but it does not follow that they have\r\nnot done injustice; no one has disputed the honour of the Commission which\r\ncarried out the Encumbered Estates Act, and yet it repeatedly sold\r\nestates at less than half their value.\r\n\r\nThe Irish landlords, I repeat, have been iniquitously despoiled; a huge\r\nconfiscation has been made of their property. If the simplest right is to\r\nbe done in this province, their claim to compensation has been rendered\r\ncomplete--apart from the utterances of Mr. Gladstone; should this be\r\ndisregarded, Parliament will have been chargeable with a grave breach of\r\nfaith, and a precedent will have been set from trampling on the just\r\nrights of property in the Three Kingdoms, which will be dangerous in the\r\nextreme. I pass on to consider the Irish land on the side of ownership,\r\nand the administration of the system of so-called 'land purchase.' Of the\r\ntotal of L40,000,000 alone available, some L20,000,000 appear to have been\r\nexpended; some 50,000 tenants have been made owners of their farms,\r\nwithout having paid a shilling of their own, that is, rather more than one\r\nin ten of the whole tenant class in Ireland. The politicians who declared\r\nagainst 'dual ownership,' that bugbear of self-sufficient ignorance, can\r\nfind little consolation in these figures; I shall comment afterwards on\r\nwhat this state of things has produced. The Government of Lord Salisbury\r\nstill proposes to seek to accelerate 'land purchase' of this kind; and\r\nloud complaints have been made of the law's delay in not having made the\r\nprocess more speedy. I have had no experience in this matter, and shall,\r\ntherefore, give no opinion on it; but it appears to me that there has been\r\nsome want of care in making advances to these so-styled 'purchasers;' not\r\na few were insolvent when they acquired their farms, and many are now on\r\nthe verge of bankruptcy. This, however, was perhaps inseparable from the\r\nsystem that has been pursued; it is only an additional proof of its\r\nessential vices.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE IRISH LAND (_continued_)--PROPOSED REFORM OF THE IRISH\r\nLAND SYSTEM\r\n\r\n    Retrospect of the present Irish land system--Position of the Irish\r\n    landlords--Position of the Irish tenant class--This not as\r\n    advantageous as might be supposed--The effects of the land code on\r\n    Irish agriculture injurious--The effects on the general Irish\r\n    community--Confiscation, violation of contracts, shock given to\r\n    credit, increased alienation of classes, and demoralisation--The land\r\n    system considered on the side of ownership--'Voluntary\r\n    purchase'--Mischief of this policy--It sets up a false standard\r\n    against rent, and creates unjust distinctions between different\r\n    classes of tenants--The results it has produced already--An instance\r\n    of the system--The demand for the compulsory purchase of the Irish\r\n    land caused by 'voluntary purchase'--Compulsory purchase has some hold\r\n    on opinion, but is an impossible, and would be a disgraceful and\r\n    ruinous policy--It would ruin Irish landlords as a\r\n    class--Instances--It would ultimately bring Ireland into the state in\r\n    which she was before the Great Famine--Proposed plan for the reform of\r\n    Irish land tenure--Questions as to the means of compensating Irish\r\n    landlords, a deeply wronged order of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving traced the attempts that have been made to reform Irish land\r\ntenure, in the last thirty years, and noticed the administration of the\r\nnew Irish land code, I must, for the sake of clearness, take a short\r\nretrospect, and consider the Irish land system as it exists at this day; I\r\nshall review it on the side of occupation first, that is, in the relations\r\nof landlord and tenant. The agricultural rental of Ireland, we have seen,\r\nhas been, or is being, reduced about 40 per cent. since 1881, through the\r\noperation of laws carried out by tribunals of the State; this proceeding,\r\nunexampled in civilised lands, has been the means, I have proved, of doing\r\ngross wrong to the Irish landed gentry. But this, if a signal, is only one\r\nof the many acts of injustice perpetrated on a cruelly injured body of\r\nmen. The fee simple has been wrested from the Irish landlord, where he has\r\nbeen subjected to the legislation of late years; he has been deprived of\r\nthe ownership which had been his birthright. An estate, nominally for\r\nfifteen years, but really capable of being renewed for ever, has been\r\ncreated against him by an unjust law; and this has been vested in his\r\nformer tenants, subject to the mode of land tenure known as the 'Three\r\nF's,' the chief of these being 'fair,' that is, State-settled rents, in\r\nthe adjustment of which he has no voice. He may, no doubt, retain\r\nfragments of his old proprietary rights; parts of his estate may be\r\nexcluded from the provisions of the law; he may be the lord of 'future\r\ntenants;' he is left 'royalties,' such as minerals, mines, and timber; he\r\npossesses most of his former legal remedies; and should the holders of the\r\nlands, which had been his own, who have obtained the benefits of the\r\n'Three F's,' infringe the statutory conditions imposed on them, they may\r\nbe dispossessed, and he may enter upon their farms again. But,\r\nnotwithstanding exceptions and possibilities like these, the Irish\r\nlandlord has, for practical purposes, been well-nigh assimilated to a\r\nrent-charger, and his tenants have been nearly converted into owners of\r\nthe soil, an utter revolution in the whole land system, in truth, turning\r\nit upside down. The status, indeed, of the Irish landed gentry now bears a\r\nstrong resemblance to that of the chief landlords of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, who, separating themselves altogether from their lands, let them\r\nin perpetuity at low rents, and, as a necessary consequence, produced the\r\nmiddleman, the pest, as he has rightly been called, of Irish land tenure.\r\n\r\nThe enormous and, as I believe, the unjust benefits secured by recent\r\nlegislation to the Irish tenant, are not, however, so complete as they\r\nappear to be, and are not without disadvantages attendant on them. Tenants\r\nof holdings, to which the law does not apply, such as tenants of demesnes\r\nand large pastoral lands, if rightly excluded, nevertheless complain; and\r\n'future tenants,' and petty occupants, who cannot afford to seek 'fair\r\nrents' from the Courts, have, from their point of view, solid grounds of\r\ncomplaint. The scope of the new land code is, therefore, to some extent,\r\nrestricted; and if the law has actually caused a general reduction of\r\nrents, it has not secured the 'Three F's' for a considerable body of\r\nfarmers, not improbably a fourth or fifth part of the class as a whole.\r\nAnd even the occupiers of the Irish soil, who have obtained the advantages\r\nof the new mode of tenure, have not obtained these without a certain kind\r\nof drawback. Completely separated as they now are from their former\r\nlandlords, they cannot expect indulgences from a class which considers\r\nitself to have been shamefully wronged; the allowances, which, whatever\r\nmay be said, had been made to them, in thousands of cases, have, as a\r\nrule, been altogether withdrawn; they get no help in making improvements;\r\nthey are usually obliged regularly to pay their 'fair rents;' above all,\r\nlandlords, of a strict or harsh nature, are sometimes on the look-out to\r\nsee if they do not violate the statutory conditions to which they are\r\nsubject, in order to convert them into 'future tenants,' outside of the\r\nprotection of the law, and even to reacquire their lands. These\r\ncircumstances are not without adverse effects; though unquestionably they\r\nare far more than countervailed by the change which has been wrought in\r\nIrish land tenure, and has given the Irish tenant the benefits already\r\ndescribed. Yet, even from this point of view, the law does not operate as\r\nunreservedly in his favour as might be supposed. He has his 'fair rent,'\r\nprobably much too low; his 'fixity of tenure,' a perpetuity in all but\r\nname; his right to 'free sale,' sometimes worth thousands of pounds. But,\r\nas a rule, he can only gain these advantages at the cost of a lawsuit\r\nrecurring at short intervals of time, with the vexation and mischief this\r\nbrings with it, a lawsuit, too, of which the results may be more or less\r\ndoubtful. If, too, he is a saving and thrifty man he will hardly be able\r\nto acquire lands for himself, as, in consequence of the right of 'free\r\nsale,' the tenant right of these will have become immensely high; he will\r\nbe confined, in most instances, to the farm he holds. On the other hand,\r\nif he be dishonest or imprudent, he will be tempted to run out and even to\r\ninjure his land, in order to effect a reduction of rent, or to sublet or\r\nmortgage it should an opportunity be found.\r\n\r\nThe new Irish land code has thus had this special feature: it has done\r\ninfinite harm to the despoiled landlord, but the tenant has not gained the\r\nexpected benefits. Let us now see what effect it has had on the great\r\nindustry on which the Irish landed classes depend, the main source of the\r\nwealth of their country. Unquestionably, as I have remarked, over and over\r\nagain, the tenant in Ireland makes, for the most part, the plant of his\r\nfarm a necessary incident of the small-farm system; but the Irish landed\r\ngentry, in the last half century, have done a great deal in the work of\r\nimprovement. Whatever interested calumny may falsely assert, they have\r\nexpended millions, as unerring statistics show, in planting, enclosure,\r\nand, especially, in arterial drainage, this last beyond the reach of the\r\ncommon peasant; they have, in thousands of instances, made the breeds of\r\nstock better; they have made large allowances as regards farm buildings.\r\nAll this is now a thing of the past; the sometime landowner, in a real\r\nsense, has been divorced from his former estate; law has prohibited him\r\nfrom doing anything for it; his only interest is to collect the\r\nrent-charge called, in mockery, 'fair rent.' On the other hand, tenants in\r\nIreland have, in a great many cases--I have briefly glanced at the\r\nconclusive evidence--positively wasted or neglected their holdings, for\r\nthe express purpose of working rent down; this shameful expedient has been\r\nhardly checked; the deterioration of a large area of land has been thus\r\naccomplished. And, at the same time, as 'fair rent' is much lower than the\r\nrent of the market, a considerable minority of this class have sublet or\r\nmortgaged their lands, in order to get advances of which they stand in\r\nneed; this, no doubt, is a violation of the law; but it is a violation\r\ndifficult to prove, and they run the risk. In this way, as I have shown,\r\nin a preceding chapter, the husbandry of Ireland has declined of late\r\nyears; woodland has been cut down recklessly to a great extent; main\r\ndrainage has been largely neglected, a ruinous thing in a wet climate; in\r\nthousands of cases the farming of tenants at 'fair rents' is wretched. The\r\nface of the country reveals these facts: Ireland is worse cultivated than\r\nit was twenty years ago; indeed, the best farming, in the island, by many\r\ndegrees, is that conducted by a small number of men of substance, who\r\nstill hold on the footing of free contract, having settled with their\r\nlandlords, and taken out leases, a significant commentary on Irish\r\nlegislation since 1881.\r\n\r\nThis subject, however, must be considered from a broader point of view,\r\nand with reference to the community of Ireland, as a whole. A great\r\nconfiscation, I have said, has been wrought in the Irish land; the immense\r\nfall in the value of the landlord's estate, and the immense rise in the\r\nvalue of the tenant right, prove that property belonging to one class has\r\nbeen transferred, wholesale, by law, to another, a result never\r\ncontemplated by responsible statesmen. And confiscation has produced its\r\ninevitable effects; free dealing in land has been prevented; except to his\r\nformer tenants an Irish country gentleman cannot sell what remains to him\r\nof his former estate, and that through the system of 'land purchase;'\r\ncapital shuns the Irish soil as if it were a quicksand; trustees and\r\nmortgagees will not invest in it; in a word, as respects the class which\r\nhad been its owners, the Irish land has been bound in a kind of pernicious\r\nmortmain. It is unnecessary to dwell on the resulting evils; one of the\r\nsources of the wealth of Ireland has been made barren; a paralysis has\r\nfallen on a member of Irish industry; what is, perhaps, even worse, a\r\nsense of insecurity, of instability, of fear of unknown change, so widely\r\nprevails in Irish landed relations, that they have become completely\r\nunsettled, and are a mere chaos. And as vicious legislation has cut the\r\nold landlord off from his estate, has assimilated him to the chief lord of\r\nthe eighteenth century, and is evolving, by degrees, the middleman, so the\r\neffects of confiscation, by keeping land out of commerce, have unnaturally\r\nlimited and restricted its nominal ownership; in fact, many of the\r\nfeatures of the detestable penal laws of Ireland are reappearing in the\r\nIrish land system, and are being reproduced by the modern Irish land code.\r\nAnother mischievous effect of this code, in another direction, requires\r\nattention. The value of tenant right, we have seen, has enormously\r\nincreased; the sums paid by incoming to outgoing tenants, on the transfer\r\nof farms, have, accordingly, become enormous; these purchasers, therefore,\r\nare being subjected to heavy outlays, practically in the nature of\r\nrack-rents, which hamper their industry, starve their capital, and most\r\ninjuriously affect good husbandry. One class of the community is thus\r\nwronged for the behoof of another; and agriculture must, more or less,\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\nNot the least, however, of the manifold evils caused by this legislation\r\nhave to be yet noticed. The ancient divisions of race and faith in the\r\nIrish land system still continue; what was most harsh and oppressive in\r\nthem has been effaced; but they have become wider and more marked in the\r\nlast twenty years; and this is largely to be ascribed to the present land\r\ncode. A mode of land tenure, which produces harassing litigation at short\r\nintervals of time, and makes landed relations cockpits for legal\r\nconflicts, necessarily sets the landed classes against each other; it has\r\naggravated the old differences deep-rooted in the Irish soil. The\r\nProtestant gentleman and the Catholic peasant are more estranged from each\r\nother, in the southern provinces, than they have been, I believe, within\r\nliving memory; the same remark, too, applies to Presbyterian Ulster, where\r\nthe gentry belong, for the most part, to the late Established Church, and\r\nthe tenant classes are of the faith of John Knox; the lines of distinction\r\nbetween these orders of men have deepened; and this alienation, concurring\r\nwith another cause, has contributed to the cry for the confiscation of the\r\nIrish land, which is now being very generally raised, and to which I shall\r\nrefer afterwards. Another mischief of this legislation, at which I have\r\nalready glanced, is the widespread demoralisation it has caused, from the\r\nnature of the case. The litigation in the Courts where 'fair rents' are\r\nbeing fixed, is often a miserable spectacle of hard and mendacious\r\nswearing productive of the worst effects on the human character. Peasants,\r\nas a rule, do not scruple to pledge their oaths that their rents ought to\r\nbe at most a fourth of the rents they had paid for perhaps half a century;\r\nthe witnesses they call as valuers usually repeat these statements. The\r\nclaims, too, for exemption from rent, on account of improvements, are\r\noften ridiculous, often shameful; I have seen sums paid for manures twenty\r\nyears old, gravely put forward as creating a claim for exemption; and the\r\nsubject of the deterioration of farms is another fruitful source of\r\nfalsehood. It is hardly necessary to comment on the results, as regards\r\nself-respect and the moral sense of men, which must follow proceedings of\r\nthis kind, carried on, over whole counties, in thousands of cases; they\r\nare, inevitably, in a very high degree, unfortunate; but, when law\r\nencourages dishonesty, they were to be only expected.\r\n\r\nSuch have been the fruits of the new Irish land code, on the side of the\r\noccupation of the Irish land. Legislation, essentially faulty and unwise,\r\nin conflict with economic science and the facts of the case, has taken\r\nfrom the Irish landlords their chief proprietary rights, and forcibly\r\ntransferred these to their tenants; it has not conferred the benefits it\r\nintended on an unfairly favoured class; it has wrought a revolution in the\r\nIrish land system, in contravention to plain justice, and given it an\r\nunnatural and evil aspect; it has caused iniquitous confiscation on a vast\r\nscale and demoralisation profound and widespread, with the far-reaching\r\ninherent mischiefs; and bad administration has made bad laws worse.\r\nPolitical economy, spite of Mr. Gladstone, has not fled from this world at\r\nhis bidding; she looks on, so to speak, at the ruins in Ireland produced\r\nby the violation of her most certain principles; I will add, she affirms\r\nthe claim to compensation of the Irish landlord, if the simplest equity is\r\nnot to be set at nought. As to the general situation evolved by the\r\npresent Irish land code, I may refer to these pregnant words of Mr. Lecky:\r\n'It cannot be denied that this legislation has redressed some hard cases\r\nand benefited a large number of tenants; and as few men look beyond\r\nimmediate consequences, or rightly estimate those which are indirect and\r\nremote, this fact is accepted by many as its justification. For my own\r\npart, I believe that it will one day be found that the evils resulting\r\nfrom this policy have greatly outweighed its benefits, and that they will\r\nfall far more heavily on another class than on the small class which was\r\ndirectly injured. In a poor country, where increased capital, improved\r\ncredit, and secure industry are the greatest needs, it has shaken to the\r\nvery basis the idea of the sanctity and obligation of contract; made it\r\nalmost impossible to borrow any considerable sum on Irish land;\r\neffectually stopped the influx of English gold; paralysed or prevented\r\nnearly all industrial undertakings stretching into a distant future. It\r\nhas reacted powerfully upon trade, and thus contributed to impoverish the\r\nIrish towns, while it has withdrawn the whole rental of Ireland from the\r\nimprovement of the soil, as the landlord can have no further inducement or\r\nobligation to spend money on his estate. In combination, also, with the\r\nHome Rule movement, it has driven much capital out of the land.'[143]\r\n\r\nI pass on to the legislation of late years, with respect to the Irish\r\nland, on the side of ownership. I have briefly described what that\r\nlegislation is: a Conservative Ministry, impressed with the wrong idea\r\nthat Mr. Gladstone had 'created dual ownership,' by the ill-conceived\r\nmeasure of 1881, resolved to abolish this evil thing if they could, though\r\nit is the natural mould of Irish land tenure; and Parliament has allotted\r\nL40,000,000 to attain this object, through the operation of what is\r\nfalsely called 'land purchase.' The mode of proceeding has been explained:\r\nan Irish landlord, who desires to sell his estate to his tenants, can\r\nobtain an advance for this purpose from the State, through the agency of\r\nthe Land Commission; the tenants are then made owners of their farms,\r\nwithout contributing any moneys of their own, and hold at terminable\r\nannuities much lower than even 'fair rents.' The transaction, therefore,\r\nwe have seen, is, in no sense, a purchase; it is a gift, in the nature of\r\na bribe; it is completely different from the policy of John Bright and the\r\nsales of land made to tenants before 1885, in which these men paid part of\r\nthe price at least, the only real security for thrift and honesty. Of the\r\nL40,000,000, nearly half, I have said, has been spent; and out of the\r\n486,000 agricultural Irish tenants, some 50,000 have acquired their\r\nholdings, in fee, under these conditions. The law thus applies to a mere\r\nfraction of the class; it is idle to assert that this can do much to\r\nextinguish 'dual ownership' in all Ireland; the sum required would be many\r\ntimes more than that which alone has been made available; and the\r\nprocess, at the present rate of 'purchases,' would not be accomplished\r\nwithin a century. We may, therefore, pass away from this part of the\r\nsubject; but let us see how 'land purchase,' effected in this way, bears\r\non the position of the Irish landed gentry. The immense majority of this\r\norder of men still cling to their native country and their homes; they\r\nhate the idea of parting with the rights they retain in the land, trampled\r\ndown and injured as they have been; this is especially the case with the\r\nbest and most solvent landlords. But as the terminable annuities payable\r\non 'land purchase' are not nearly so high as even very low rents, not to\r\nspeak of the other conditions of this mode of tenure, it follows that\r\ntenants who have thus been made owners are infinitely better off than\r\ntenants still subject to rent; one class has great advantages, of which\r\nthe other is deprived; as a necessary consequence an artificial standard\r\nis set up against rent, which does wrong to the landlord, from the nature\r\nof the case; gives every tenant on his estate a grievance; and not\r\nimprobably may expose him to a determined refusal to pay any rent\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n'Land purchase,' therefore--the name is a mere untruth--has been a failure\r\nas regards 'dual ownership;' and it is establishing against the Irish\r\nlandlord a false measure of rent, analogous to a base coinage, a strange\r\nachievement of a Conservative Government. Let us next consider what has\r\nbeen the working of this economic nostrum, with respect to the class, for\r\nthe benefit of which it was first prescribed, and which has reaped the\r\nadvantages it gives. The tenants, who have been made owners of their\r\nfarms, have, as a rule, discharged their obligations to the State very\r\nwell, though I could point to not a few exceptions; and there have been\r\nstrikes against the payment of the terminable annuities in some instances.\r\nThis may be sufficient for official bureaucrats; it is not sufficient for\r\nthose who know Ireland, and can impartially watch the course of events.\r\nIt was fondly expected that 'land purchase,' that is, bribing tenants in\r\nIreland to become owners of their farms, would create a powerful body of\r\nfreeholders loyal to the State; but this has already been seen to be a\r\nmere delusion. As Parnell predicted would be the case, these 'purchasers'\r\nare 'patriotic' in the highest degree; they fill the ranks of the United\r\nIrish League, that is, of a conspiracy against our rule in Ireland, and\r\nare numbered among its most efficient agents; human nature being what it\r\nactually is, this is precisely what was to be expected. It was confidently\r\nforetold, again, that these 'purchasers' would form a thriving class of\r\nmodel farmers; and that their lands would be patterns of admirable and\r\nimproved peasant husbandry, but this forecast is being, in a great degree,\r\nfalsified. These men, 'rocked and dandled into their possessions,' in the\r\nwords of Burke, without a single guarantee for common prudence, and\r\nespecially without an effort of their own, have, in hundreds of instances,\r\nturned out sorry failures; and it has been the almost universal practice\r\nof the whole class to cut down every tree that grows on their lands, an\r\nact of ruinous waste in a rain-drenched climate. Besides, as freehold\r\nownership is not an Irish idea--indeed, is opposed to Irish ideas--these\r\n'purchasers' have, in many cases, following the example of tenants 'at\r\nfair rents,' subdivided, sublet, or mortgaged their holdings; instead of\r\nremaining owners in a true sense, they are becoming middlemen lording it\r\nover rack-rented serfs. The agriculture, too, of hundreds of these farms\r\nis slovenly in the extreme, for bribery does not promote industry; what is\r\n'easy got, easy goes' is a true proverb; and, in addition, a number of\r\nthese men were really insolvent when they were made 'purchasers.' That\r\nIreland will blossom like a rose, under these conditions, is seen even now\r\nto be a chimera; and there is much reason to believe that many of these\r\n'purchasers' have become the prey of the race of local usurers, a\r\nconsummation that might have been predicted. 'I shall sell my estate,' a\r\nwitty Irishman once remarked, 'but I will keep two loan offices and four\r\npublic-houses; and in two generations my \"purchasing\" tenants will be too\r\nhappy to resell their lands to my grandsons.'\r\n\r\nA singular instance of 'land purchase,' and, indeed, of the working of\r\nanother part of the land code, has come under my notice of late; I can\r\nanswer for the accuracy of what I write; scores of similar cases could be,\r\nprobably, found. In 1852, an industrious Scottish tradesman invested the\r\nsavings of years of his life in buying a chief rent under the Encumbered\r\nEstates Act; he gave L5000 for a perpetual rent-charge of L192, that is,\r\nnot quite 4 per cent. on his capital. The tenant of the lands subject to\r\nthe rent was a middleman, with an estate of about L3000 a year; he had\r\nsublet the lands to a tenant in occupation of them, a slovenly,\r\nill-conditioned, and indolent farmer. The Land Act of 1887 passed; the\r\nwealthy middleman, an excellent 'mark' for the chief rent, who, therefore,\r\nhad been obliged to pay the L192 a year, was empowered by the new law to\r\nevade his contract, and practically to get rid of his interest; the owner\r\nof the chief rent, therefore, had only the tenant in occupation to look to\r\nfor the discharge of his claim. This person was succeeded by his son, a\r\ngood-for-nothing and drunken man, who soon became head over ears in debt;\r\nbut he was declared 'a purchaser' by the Land Commission, and, subject to\r\na terminable annuity, was made owner of the lands. But the advance made\r\nwas not more than L2300; the representative of the hardworking Scotchman,\r\nwho had bought property, as secure, at the time, as Consols, was a loser\r\nof more than half of his capital; he was simply cheated out of L2700,\r\nthrough the operation of an iniquitous law; his indignant protests may\r\nwell be conceived. The subsequent history of this so-styled 'purchase' is\r\nsignificant, and not without interest. The worthless owner took possession\r\nof the lands; his first step was to cut down the woodland, until he was\r\nstopped by a creditor to whom he owed a mortgage. Since that time he has\r\nbecome insolvent in all but name, and cannot pay the annuity due to the\r\nState; the Land Commission has been trying to sell the lands; but the\r\nattempt has, hitherto, been a failure; the lands have been 'boycotted,'\r\nand the market has been closed against a sale. These proceedings do not\r\nrequire a word of comment; they strikingly illustrate how the agrarian\r\ncode of Ireland makes havoc of capital, annuls contracts, and confiscates\r\nproperty for the behoof of dishonest thriftlessness. Meanwhile the happy\r\nmiddleman enjoys his L3000 a year; I dare say he licks his lips as he\r\nthinks of the Land Act of 1887, which scattered a just liability to the\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable and the worst effect--with a revolutionary tendency in\r\nno doubtful sense--of this mischievous system has, however, to be still\r\nnoticed. About one out of ten of the agricultural tenants of Ireland have\r\n'purchased' their farms in the way described; the fund available for 'land\r\npurchase' cannot include more than one in five; and the process is and\r\nmust be slow, owing to the law's delay. Legislation, therefore, with a\r\nsingular want of insight, has drawn, and is drawing, an unjust distinction\r\nbetween 'purchasing' and rent-paying tenants; it is dividing them into a\r\nsmall favoured class, and a multitude harshly left out in the cold--fat\r\nsheep in one fold, lean goats in another; as the inevitable result, the\r\nrent-paying tenant resents the benefits obtained by 'the purchaser;' and\r\nthe immense majority of the farmers of Ireland are made discontented with\r\ntheir lot, from their point of view not without reason. It is idle to say\r\nto this great body of men that they have already gained advantages from\r\nthe State, on which they never reckoned thirty years ago, and that they\r\nhave the 'Three F's,' and all that the phrase implies; those who have\r\nsecured much are eager to secure more; the unfair distinction arbitrarily\r\nmade against them is unintelligible and exasperating, man being what he\r\nis. The policy of 'voluntary purchase,' as it is called, has, accordingly,\r\nfrom the very nature of the case, provoked and called into being the cry\r\nfor the 'compulsory purchase' of the Irish land, now being heard far and\r\nwide in Ireland--that is, for the forcible expropriation of all Irish\r\nlandlords, and for placing all their tenants, in their stead, as owners of\r\ntheir estates. This demand has as yet been rejected by statesmen, and is,\r\nI believe, both hopeless and shameful; but it has, nevertheless, some\r\nlogic on its side; it is a corollary from legislation essentially bad;\r\nand, backed as it is by a large force of Irish opinion, it cannot be\r\nignored or treated with contempt. It is simply extraordinary that many\r\nIrish landlords have been encouraging, and still encourage, 'voluntary\r\npurchase,' on its existing lines, and will not perceive that it leads to\r\n'compulsory purchase;' either from a desire to dispose of parts of their\r\nestates, or from motives not easy to understand, they are promoting a\r\nrevolution, which, if accomplished, would assure their ruin, as I shall\r\nconclusively prove afterwards. But the well-informed and most thoughtful\r\nmembers of their class are not flies lured into a bottle by a bit of\r\nsugar; they are alive to all that is involved in what is called 'land\r\npurchase.' Many years ago, when Parliament was voting funds for 'voluntary\r\npurchase,' on the present system, I indicated what would be the results; I\r\nonly claim credit for some share of common sense: 'Law will have been\r\nsevering the occupiers of the soil by an arbitrary process into a pampered\r\ncaste, marked off from a disfavoured multitude; and, as a necessary\r\nconsequence, the mass of tenants, kept in an inferior position, will be\r\nfilled with discontent--and from their point of view with perfect\r\njustice--when, as the advances from the State run short, their prospects\r\nof \"land purchase\" shall wane and diminish. An \"ugly rush\" will be made\r\nthroughout the country to force landlords, as a class, to sell, in order\r\nto get a chance of buying; in Ulster the cry for \"compulsory purchase,\"\r\nalready heard, will swell high and fierce.'[144]\r\n\r\nThese, therefore, have been the fruits of the system called 'land\r\npurchase' with euphemistic falsehood. 'Compulsory purchase,' a demand\r\ncaused by an unwise policy, is a question that must be fairly discussed;\r\nit is nothing to the purpose that it has as yet made little way in\r\nParliament. This claim would have been regarded as sheer insanity thirty\r\nyears ago; it was scouted by John Bright as in the highest degree\r\nmischievous, though John Bright was the first statesman who proposed\r\nmaking tenants in Ireland owners of their farms, but through a real, not a\r\nsham, mode of purchase. The compulsory purchase of the rented land of\r\nIreland is a policy that has advocates even in England and Scotland; and\r\nit is lamentable to observe how British opinion seems to take little heed\r\nhow a measure of this kind would affect the position of the Irish\r\nlandlord, another of the many instances of its habitual disregard of the\r\nplainest rights of property in land in Ireland. A set of doctrinaires,\r\nignorant of Irish nature and of the Irish land, imagine that 'the creation\r\nof a peasant proprietary,' in all parts of Ireland, as the cant phrase is,\r\nwould, in any case, make the Union secure, and would promote tranquillity,\r\nindustry, and content. Some politicians still cherish the fond belief,\r\nthat thrusting Irish tenants, wholesale, into the place of their\r\nlandlords, by an act of violence without a parallel, would make Irish\r\ngovernment and administration more easy; and shut their eyes to the nature\r\nof this policy. English and Scottish capitalists, who have made advances\r\non Irish estates, see in compulsory purchase the best probable means of\r\nrealising securities now in danger; a few great absentee landlords, eager\r\nto part with their possessions in Ireland, at almost any price, are\r\npossibly not opposed to this scheme; and so maybe a few bankrupt Irish\r\nlandlords, hoping to get a trifle out of a general shipwreck. The demand,\r\nhowever, for compulsory purchase has its only real strength in Ireland;\r\nand unquestionably it is widespread and far-reaching. The conspiracy\r\nagainst British rule in Ireland, which has made the annihilation of Irish\r\n'landlordism' one of its main objects, calls for compulsory purchase, as a\r\nmatter of course; it finds no difficulty in banding together the peasantry\r\nof the southern provinces in support of a cry which means for this class\r\nan improvement in their lot, and appeals to deep-rooted sentiments of\r\nhuman nature. The Irish Catholic priesthood, too, back the movement to a\r\nman, and so do the local Nationalist boards; for obvious reasons, both\r\nthese orders of men seek to drive the Irish landed gentry from their\r\nhomes, and to replace them by dependents in sympathy with them. The demand\r\nhas also extended to Ulster, chiefly on account of the harsh distinction\r\ndrawn between 'purchasing' and 'non-purchasing' tenants; it is economic\r\nrather than social or political; but the cry for compulsory purchase is\r\nperhaps loudest in parts of the northern province. Its principal champion,\r\nat present, is an enthusiast, sincere, indeed, if without judgment and\r\ninsight; but he is sustained by bodies of farmers formidable in numbers at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nThe sharp and, as I think, the unfair distinction drawn by the present law\r\nbetween tenant 'purchasers' and tenants still subject to the payment of\r\nrent, has created, it cannot be said too often, the demand for the\r\ncompulsory purchase of the Irish land, and for this Lord Salisbury's\r\nGovernment is largely responsible. But because an Irish peasant, on one\r\nside of a fence, cannot obtain the benefits of land tenure, which his\r\nneighbour, on the other side, has obtained, and may even have a right to\r\ncomplain, it does not follow that compulsory purchase is a possible, or\r\naught but a disgraceful policy; other interests and considerations must be\r\ntaken into account. Let us first see how compulsory purchase would affect\r\nthe financial position of the Three Kingdoms. Great as the prosperity of\r\nthe Empire is, the strain on its resources is immense; the expenditure of\r\nthe State at home is vast, and on the increase; the war in South Africa,\r\nand the settlement of that huge region, will cost unknown millions; the\r\nreform of our military and even of our naval system, necessary to our\r\nsafety, will be a weighty burden for years; every Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer has declared that fiscal economy, as far as possible, is his\r\nfirst duty. But what does the compulsory purchase of the Irish land\r\ninvolve, and what, confessedly, are its essential conditions? Mr.\r\nGladstone, I have said, asserted, long ago, that the value of the\r\nagricultural area of Ireland was L300,000,000; this estimate, I believe,\r\nis too high; but, in the opinion of competent judges, it cannot be deemed\r\nless than L150,000,000. But the forcible expropriation of the Irish landed\r\ngentry on every principle of civilised law, as, indeed, Sir Michael Hicks\r\nBeach has already insisted, would imply giving them a large additional\r\nbonus; this probably would not be less than L50,000,000; the sum,\r\ntherefore, required for compulsory purchase, would, it may be assumed, be\r\nnot less than L200,000,000. Now, can any one imagine that the general\r\ntaxpayer, in the financial situation in which we are, and shall be for\r\nyears, will make himself liable for this colossal charge, equal to the\r\nransom Germany extorted from France, in order to bribe Irish peasants into\r\nthe ownership of their farms, and to effect an agrarian revolution, in\r\nwhich he has no interest? I should like to see the Minister who would go\r\nto the country on such an insane policy, and who would call on the hardly\r\ntaxed millions of England, Scotland, and Ireland, to burn huge holes in\r\ntheir pockets for such an object, for simply robbing Peter to pay Paul,\r\nand that without a pretence of right, or any conceivable good. And what\r\nsecurity would the Irish land afford for the payment of this enormous\r\nimpost? The terminable annuities due from the 'purchasing' tenants would,\r\nit has pleasantly been said, be a sufficient guarantee; but men of common\r\nsense are not to be caught by chaff; the idea is a vain and worthless\r\ndelusion. The 'No Rent Manifesto' and the 'Plan of Campaign' were\r\nmovements of Irish peasants, so to speak, of yesterday; what if another\r\nParnell were to arise and to issue a ukase that 'a foreign and alien\r\nGovernment had no right to an unjust tribute;' and how could this be\r\ncollected by a Department of an absentee State?\r\n\r\nThe general taxpayer, therefore, who, thirteen years ago, grumbled at a\r\ndemand of L5,000,000 only, will assuredly not fling L200,000,000, or half\r\nthat sum, into the Serbonian bog of the Irish land. It is hardly necessary\r\nto dwell on so small a fact, 'that compulsory purchase would reduce the\r\nincome tax of Ireland about one-half, for nine-tenths of the tenant\r\n'purchasers' would be below its level;' but even this cannot be left out\r\nof sight. Conservative statesmen, it should be added, are especially bound\r\nto reject this scheme; in 1886 they denounced, in emphatic language, Mr.\r\nGladstone's far less dangerous plan of making the State liable for\r\nL50,000,000, to buy out Irish landlords; flagrant inconsistency in\r\npolitics should be eschewed. The probably fixed purpose of the general\r\ntaxpayer not to mulct himself heavily to fling the Irish soil to a mass of\r\npeasants, is doubtless, and I say it with regret, the best security\r\nagainst the destruction of the Irish landlords; this despoiled and\r\nmaltreated body of men just now fill the place in Irish affairs of the\r\n'Injured Lady' of Swift's satire, gravely told by her lover across the\r\nChannel that 'I had cost him ten times more than I was worth to maintain\r\nme, and that it had been much better for him if I had been damned, or\r\nburnt, or thrown to the bottom of the sea.'[145] Nevertheless, I have\r\nfaith in right-minded Englishmen, however prejudiced or ill-informed about\r\nan unpopular class, if plain facts and figures are set before them; let us\r\nsee how it would fare with the Irish landlord were he forcibly\r\nexpropriated under compulsory purchase. I will take the case of an Irish\r\ncountry gentleman, who, in the period between 1868 and 1878, had an income\r\nfrom his estate of L1500 a year, subject to a family charge of L10,000 at\r\n4 per cent., that is, had a net annual income of L1100. Owing to the\r\ndepression of agriculture since 1879, his rents would have naturally\r\nfallen about L300 a year; but let us suppose that, through the operation\r\nof the new Irish land code, they have been cut down to 'fair rents' of\r\nL900 a year only. His annual income, therefore, would be L900 less by\r\nL400, that is, he would still have L500 a year he could call his own; how\r\nwould it be with him were he forcibly sold out? Admit that his estate\r\nwould fetch eighteen years' purchase--the present average rate is\r\nseventeen--that is, would realise L16,200; deducting, say, L200 for law\r\ncosts, this would be a net residue of L16,000. But the family charge would\r\nabsorb L10,000; the surplus would be L6000 only, producing, let us\r\ncalculate, L4 per cent.; this ruined man, therefore, who, little more than\r\ntwenty years ago, possessed an income of L1100 a year, would be left L240\r\nat the very utmost. I have taken care to understate the case; I challenge\r\nattention to my figures; I ask honest Englishmen would not this be sheer\r\nrobbery, accomplished, to the disgrace of the State, in its name?\r\n\r\nIt has been urged, however--and to those who know the facts, the statement\r\nis cruel and shameful mockery--that the Irish landlord would only lose his\r\nrented lands, and that 'he could live happily on the demesne land, which\r\nhe would still retain.' This would be simply impossible in the case of\r\nnineteen-twentieths of the class; they would not have the means to keep\r\ntheir demesnes up; they would be compelled to part with them at almost any\r\nprice; and the few, who would have the means, would, all but certainly,\r\nwith their beggared fellows, leave a country in which they had been foully\r\nbetrayed. It is notorious, indeed, that Irish Nationalist leaders, knowing\r\nwhat compulsory purchase means, have marked down the demesnes of the Irish\r\nlanded gentry as their prey; associates of American Fenians and of the\r\nClan na Gael are to revel in the mansions of the Geraldines, the Butlers,\r\nthe O'Connors, the O'Neills, as Jacobins revelled in the mansions of the\r\nLa Tremouilles and the De Noailles. But man does not live by bread alone;\r\nthe material ruin of the Irish landlord would be bad enough; but the moral\r\nconsequences of his expropriation must not be left out of sight. Few of\r\nthe purchasers under the Encumbered Estates Acts care probably much about\r\nthe lands they have bought; the same remark probably applies to most Irish\r\nabsentees. But an immense majority of the Irish landed gentry are deeply\r\nattached to their hearths and their homes; they are bound to their lands\r\nby innumerable ties; they have been brought up with the sentiments which\r\nproperty in land creates; in the pathetic words of an old chronicler,\r\n'They do not wish to pray in foreign churches, or to lie in foreign\r\ngraves;' their hope has been to live and die amidst their ancestral\r\nsurroundings. The State has, in a special manner, encouraged this belief;\r\nit rooted the Irish landlord in the soil to be its supporter; is it to\r\nexpel him from the position it has made for him, without a thought of the\r\nshock to his best feelings this must produce? Would not such an act be\r\ndishonourable, nay, infamous? Let us hear what the deepest of our\r\npolitical thinkers, Burke, has written upon a somewhat parallel case:\r\n'When men are encouraged to go into a certain mode of life by the\r\nexisting laws, and protected in that mode as in a lawful occupation--when\r\nthey have accommodated all their ideas, and all their habits to it, ... I\r\nam sure it is unjust in legislature, by an arbitrary act, to offer a\r\nsudden violence to their minds and their feelings; forcibly to degrade\r\nthem from their state and condition, and to stigmatise with shame and\r\ninfamy that character and those customs, which before had been made the\r\nmeasure of their happiness and honour. If to this be added an expulsion\r\nfrom their habitations, and a confiscation of all their goods, I am not\r\nsagacious enough to discover how this despotick sport, made of the\r\nfeelings, consciences, prejudices, and properties of men, can be\r\ndiscriminated from the rankest tyranny.'[146]\r\n\r\nI have referred to an instance, within my knowledge, of the operation of\r\nthe new Irish land code, in the case of a middleman, his under-tenant, and\r\na despoiled owner of a rent. I now refer to an instance, also within my\r\nknowledge, of what compulsory purchase would do in the case of an Irish\r\nlandlord. This person is a scion of one of the princely Irish-Milesian\r\nhouses; his forefathers were lords of a tract extending from the Boyne to\r\nthe Shannon. They belonged to one of the famous 'five bloods of Ireland,'\r\nacknowledged to be half-royal by Henry of Anjou; they intermarried with\r\nthe great Norman-Irish _noblesse_; one of their matronage was half-sister\r\nof Surrey's fair Geraldine; the ruins of the abbeys they founded are still\r\nto be seen. Their domains were torn from them in the reign of Mary Tudor;\r\nbut they fought stubbornly with their tribe in the great Desmond war; they\r\nretained, though proscribed, the rank of princes, until the close of the\r\nsixteenth century; leaders of the house then carried their swords into\r\nforeign armies, and have given a field marshal to Austria and grandees to\r\nSpain. The direct line of the chiefs, however, remained in Ireland; it\r\nvegetated in obscurity until the Irish rising of 1689-90; one of its\r\nmembers then appeared in the Parliament of James II. in Dublin, and\r\nperished, at the head of his regiment, it is said, at Aughrim. The\r\nfortunes of his descendants are not without interest; one is believed to\r\nhave been a companion-in-arms of Villars at Malplaquet and Denain; two of\r\nhis remote offspring, the tradition exists, perished in the ranks of\r\nNapoleon's armies. But the heir of the family bowed under the yoke of the\r\nIrish penal laws, and became a Protestant, at least in name; his near\r\nkindred gave Ireland Anthony Malone, one of the most illustrious Irishmen\r\nof the eighteenth century, and gave England the best commentator on her\r\nmost immortal poet. One of his representatives, the person of whom I\r\nwrite, still possesses a fragment of the immense possessions his fathers\r\nruled; of more than thirty of their castles he has the wreck of one; a\r\nscroll on the roof of his house bears the touching legend that he has\r\nsprung from the loins of the old Milesian princes. He is not wholly\r\nunknown as an Irish landlord of this day; curiously, too, his rental has\r\nbeen hardly reduced by the visitations of the Land and the\r\nSub-Commissions. Is this scion of the best and the most ancient _noblesse_\r\nof Ireland to be banished in his old age from his home, and to be replaced\r\nin it by ornaments of the Land, the National, and the United Irish\r\nLeagues, for this would be one result of compulsory purchase?\r\n\r\nLet us imagine, however, that, owing to the malign influence which,\r\nSpenser said, attends England in Irish affairs, the Irish landed gentry\r\nwere removed from the land, and their former tenants were put in their\r\nplace as owners. What would be the consequences, economic, social,\r\npolitical, of this sudden agrarian revolution in one of the Three\r\nKingdoms? The distribution of the Irish soil between the classes which\r\nwould possess it, would be unfavourable, in the highest degree, to the\r\nestablishment of a 'peasant proprietary,' the common name in use on this\r\nsubject. Of the 486,000 tenant farmers in Ireland, some 132,000 hold\r\npatches of from less than one to five acres in extent; are these to be\r\nstereotyped as real land owners? More than 90,000 occupy from fifty to\r\nfive hundred acres and upwards; these include the great graziers of the\r\nrich tracts of pasturage; do these supply elements of a 'peasant\r\nproprietary' in any rational sense? The only class which even on\r\nplausible, _a priori_ grounds could be made occupying owners of the land\r\nwould contain much less than 300,000 families; and probably it occupies\r\nless than two-thirds of the island as a whole. Are all these bodies of men\r\nto be lumped, so to speak, together, and universally to receive the\r\nownership of the soil; would not compulsory purchase, even on these\r\nconditions, be the sheerest folly? Furthermore, the configuration of\r\nIreland and her climate make it next to impossible that a 'peasant\r\nproprietary' could generally thrive within her borders; Nature herself\r\nforbids an attempt to carry out, on a large scale, a settlement of the\r\nkind. The central area of the island is a low watershed of wide extent,\r\nfrom which a succession of streams descends through vast tracts of morass\r\nand bog; in other parts of the country there are large and deep rivers,\r\ncurving as they approach the sea, and flowing through mountain spaces; the\r\nlands they traverse are swampy, and require main drainage; a large part of\r\nIreland is composed of wild hill ranges only fit for the rearing of young\r\nand coarse breeds of cattle; she possesses a fine area of the best\r\npasturage, confined, however, to a few counties; her true agricultural\r\narea is comparatively small. Her climate, moreover, is wet to a proverb;\r\ntorrents of rain from the Atlantic fall on her plains for months; above\r\nall, her inland towns are far from each other, and petty; scarcely one is\r\npeopled by more than 10,000 souls. Any well-informed and right-judging\r\nperson who knows the conditions under which a 'peasant proprietary' can\r\nalone flourish, must know that, from the nature of the case, it would be\r\na failure, in the circumstances in which it would be necessarily placed,\r\nwere it forcibly established in every part of Ireland. Ireland has little\r\nin common with Belgium, with Northern Italy, with France; this settlement\r\nof confiscation would go the way of the Englishry of the Middle Ages and\r\nthe Cromwellian colonists.\r\n\r\nThe most conclusive argument against compulsory purchase has,\r\nnevertheless, to be yet put forward. The state of things 'voluntary\r\npurchase' is evolving would assuredly be aggravated a hundred-fold were\r\nevery tenant in Ireland made the owner of his farm by a revolutionary act\r\non the part of the State. It is significant, in the highest degree, that\r\nfrom the time of the 'New Departure' to this hour, the conspiracy against\r\nour rule in Ireland has clamoured for the expropriation of the Irish\r\nlanded gentry by force, and for the conversion of their tenants into\r\npossessors of these estates; far better informed than British statesmen,\r\nit has rightly calculated that this violent change would increase the\r\n'Nationalist' sympathies of the Irish peasant; and this opinion is being\r\nconfirmed, to a great extent, by the results of 'voluntary purchase' being\r\nnow developed. The coarse materialist view that bribery will make a class\r\nlaw-abiding and loyal, is opposed to human nature and fact; bribery will\r\nnot efface ideas, feelings, and tendencies, deep-rooted in history and\r\nancient tradition; above all, if it is a concession to agitation and a\r\nrebellious movement, it will only quicken the animosity to the State and\r\nthe greed of the favoured class. Parnell, I have said, had his mind made\r\nup on this subject; he always insisted that the Irish tenant, wherever his\r\nholding had been made his own, would be 'more true to the cause than\r\never;' it is curious that the confident prediction of a most able man\r\nappears to have been persistently ignored. For the rest, the mischief\r\n'voluntary purchase' is already doing would be enormously aggravated by\r\nthe effects of compulsory purchase. The Irish tenant farmers, made owners\r\nof the land everywhere, would, like the present 'purchasers,' cut down\r\nwoodland wholesale; the country would be disafforested over an immense\r\narea; the consequences to agriculture would be as bad as possible.\r\nArterial and main drainage too would, as a rule, be neglected; but these\r\nwould, comparatively, be trifling results; the compulsory purchaser would\r\ndeal with the land as their 'voluntary' fellows are now largely dealing,\r\nbut, in all probability, more generally, and in much a greater proportion.\r\nHolding as they would nine-tenths of the Irish soil at terminable\r\nannuities much lower than any rent, they would inevitably subdivide,\r\nsublet, and mortgage their farms in tens of thousands of cases; they would\r\nbecome middlemen, over whole counties, the harsh oppressors of a multitude\r\nground down by rack-rents; the worst kind of 'landlordism' would be\r\nreproduced in the worst aspect. The tendency of events is even now\r\nconfirming what I wrote a long time ago on this subject: 'Freehold\r\nownership, therefore, would disappear more or less quickly over extensive\r\ntracts, the \"yeomen\" would become a diminishing quantity, and these would\r\nbe replaced by a new class of landlords with tenants at competition rents,\r\nthat is, determined by the land hunger of the Celt. The transformation\r\nwould inevitably go on, for its causes would operate with intense force;\r\nand before many years probably two-thirds of Ireland would have become a\r\nland of mere peasant landlords placed over a mass of rack-rented\r\ntenants.'[147] The creation of a universal 'peasant proprietary,' by\r\nforce, would, in fact, bring the Irish land system back by degrees into\r\nthe state in which it was before the Great Famine, when millions of\r\nserfdom squatted on the soil, disorganising agriculture and preventing\r\nsocial progress.\r\n\r\nThese considerations, however, by no means exhaust the case against the\r\ncompulsory purchase of the rented land of Ireland. Irish landlords have\r\nbeen decried, for an evil purpose, during many years; their position is\r\ndifficult and open to attack; but if they are an unpopular class, they\r\nhave been a civilising influence in Ireland of real value, the most\r\ncivilising influence, perhaps, in her three southern provinces. Their\r\nannihilation, despoiled and impoverished as they are, would still withdraw\r\na large fund from Irish rural labour; and it would be most injurious to\r\nagriculture in many ways, especially as regards main and arterial\r\ndrainage, an absolute necessity for the Irish soil, and scarcely possible\r\nexcept under a system of large estates. Their extinction, too, Englishmen\r\nought not to forget, would deprive the State of one of its mainstays in\r\nIreland; the idea to the contrary growing up is a mere delusion; it was\r\nnot for nothing that Parnell and Davitt described this order of men as\r\n'the British garrison' and insisted that were it once out of the fortress\r\nthe power of England in Ireland would certainly perish. The conversion of\r\nIrish farmers universally into landowners would also have a ruinous effect\r\non many Irish industries. It would do infinite harm to many branches of\r\ncommerce, especially to trades of the higher type; it would be disastrous\r\nto such towns as Dublin and Belfast, already beginning to protest against\r\nit; and, whatever may be said, the prospect of it is dreaded by\r\nagricultural Irish labourers as a class, which has always been ill-treated\r\nby their masters, the farmers, though, owing to the influence of priests\r\nand demagogues, they are unwilling to express the sentiments they really\r\nfeel. Compulsory purchase, in fact, is by no means so generally asked for\r\nin Ireland as is supposed; her representation demands it by a great\r\nmajority of votes; but this representation, as I have pointed out before,\r\nis not a true index of Irish opinion. Another consideration, too, should\r\nbe taken into account in coming to a reasonable conclusion on this\r\nsubject. The land system of England and Scotland, from a variety of causes\r\nsufficiently known, is essentially different from that of Ireland;\r\npolitically, socially, economically, it has little in common with it. But\r\nwere Parliament to declare that the whole tenant class of Ireland were to\r\nbe transformed into fee simple owners, subject only to renders, much less\r\nthan true rents, and payable for a short space of time, I much doubt if\r\nEnglish and Scottish tenants would acquiesce, and would not agitate for\r\nlegislation of a similar kind, especially as British agriculture is still\r\nheavily depressed. Leaseholders of large houses in towns, for long terms\r\nof years, at ground rents, and a whole class of builders, assuredly would\r\njoin in such a demand; the contagion of revolution and socialism is always\r\nperilous. English and Scottish landlords have usually played the part of\r\nthe Jew to the Samaritan as regards their Irish fellows; but 'proximus\r\nardet Ucalegon' might be borne in mind.[148]\r\n\r\nThe Irish land system, therefore, from every point of view, is simply in a\r\ndeplorable state; it is an economic and social chaos, pregnant with\r\nmischiefs and dangers of many kinds. Confiscation has wrought its work on\r\nthe Irish landlord; has shaken the structure of Irish society; and has\r\nproduced its inevitable results in banishing capital from the land, and in\r\ndealing a weighty blow to Irish credit. The legislation of 1881, and of\r\nsubsequent years, has conferred immense advantages on the tenant class in\r\nIreland; but these have fallen short of what might be supposed; this class\r\ndeclares itself to be dissatisfied with its lot; it is clamouring for the\r\nwholesale transfer to itself of the rented lands of Ireland, through what\r\nis known as compulsory purchase, that is, corruption and spoliation\r\ncombined in an act of the State. And these efforts of legislation,\r\nessentially unwise, in direct conflict with fact and economic science, a\r\nmere makeshift to stave off agitation and trouble, are, in all\r\nprobability, by no means the worst. Demoralisation has spread throughout\r\nIrish landed relations, affecting them, unfortunately, in many ways;\r\ndivisions of class have been made worse, as well as the old divisions of\r\nrace and faith; respect for contracts and obligations has been destroyed;\r\ndishonesty and thriftlessness have been favoured, and industry and honesty\r\nnot encouraged; an evil spirit of discontent and desire for change is\r\nabroad; agriculture is plainly on the decline; there is nothing secure or\r\nsettled in the land. Vicious as the Irish land system unquestionably was\r\nbefore Mr. Gladstone first took it in hand, I believe that, having regard\r\nto the general interests of the State, it is still more vicious at the\r\npresent time; it has been transformed, but, on the whole, transformed for\r\nthe worse. As I wrote before, when commenting on the position of affairs\r\nin Ireland, before the Land Act of 1870, a revolution only could have\r\nremoved the deep-rooted ills in all that related to the land; a revolution\r\nalone could remove them now. But in the one instance, as in the other, the\r\nevil caused by a revolution would be infinitely greater than the good; a\r\nnew agrarian revolution in Ireland would be a curse to her; it is better,\r\nas Burke has remarked, to try to repair even ruins than to blot out every\r\ntrace of the edifice. Still, taking it as we find it, can nothing be done\r\nto amend, in some measure, at least, the existing land system? Much of it,\r\nI admit, must be left untouched; the principle of settling rent, through\r\nthe agency of the State, false as it is, must continue to work; the\r\nprinciple of so-called 'land purchase' must, within reasonable limits, be\r\nstill given free scope. But something in the nature of reform is, I think,\r\npossible; the discussion of the subject may be of use; I contribute my\r\nmite to it, if with unfeigned diffidence.\r\n\r\nIn order to find out the truth, and thoroughly to clear the ground, a\r\nCommission, I suggest, ought to be appointed, as important as the Devon\r\nCommission of nearly sixty years ago; it should investigate the Irish Land\r\nQuestion in all its branches. Its President should be a great English\r\nnobleman--the nation would have confidence in the Duke of Bedford, a\r\nprincely and most liberal English landlord; but the judicial element\r\nshould be strong in it; English and Irish judges should be among its\r\nmembers; it should include trained agricultural experts: it should have\r\nrepresentatives of Irish landlords and tenants. It should examine the\r\nIrish land system as this existed before 1870; should review the whole\r\nseries of Irish Land Acts, from 1870 to the present time, and inquire into\r\ntheir results and tendencies; should carefully consider the operation of\r\nthe tribunals selected to carry out the new Irish land code, especially as\r\nregards the fixing of 'fair rents,' and that not with respect to their\r\nprocedure only, an unjust limit imposed on the Fry Commission, but with\r\nrespect to the principles that have been adopted and the methods pursued;\r\nit should deal exhaustively with the subject of so-called 'land purchase,'\r\nand see whether it has not directly led to the demand for compulsory\r\npurchase; it should take evidence as to 'peasant proprietary' and its\r\ncreation; and it should make a complete and searching report, with a view\r\nto the legislation it might recommend. And if I am not altogether\r\nmistaken, such a Commission would state, in emphatic language, that the\r\npresent Irish land code was ill designed, even if it cannot be now much\r\nchanged; that its administration has been attended with grave errors; that\r\ncruel wrong has been done to Irish landlords, while Irish tenants have not\r\nobtained what was hoped for; that the economic and social results have\r\nbeen deplorable; that if 'land purchase' cannot be stopped, it is a bad\r\nexpedient on its present lines, and that the cry for compulsory purchase\r\nhas been its evident effect; and that extensive, still more universal\r\npeasant ownership, is an impossible and would be a pernicious policy.\r\nFinally, if I am not much mistaken again, such a Commission would report\r\nthat a reform of the Irish land system, if very difficult, should be\r\nattempted; and that, in its main scope and operation at least, it should\r\nbe carried out on the side of land tenure, that is, in the relations of\r\nlandlord and tenant, as has been the opinion of every thinker from Burke\r\nonwards, who has not been swayed by the exigencies of agitation, or of\r\nparty politics.\r\n\r\nI proceed briefly to put my scheme forward, assuming that I have made a\r\nreasonably correct forecast. I may say it has been a subject of reflection\r\nduring many years, indeed, since the legislation of 1881; Mr. Gladstone,\r\nin his place in the House of Commons, pointedly approved of a tract in\r\nwhich I set forth my views; and so, curiously enough, did Parnell. It is\r\nimpossible, I have said, to transform the existing system of Irish land\r\ntenure; a wide departure from it cannot be made; but improvement is really\r\nfeasible within certain limits. My object would be to get rid of palpable\r\nevils, inseparable from the present state of things; to make the positions\r\nof both Irish landlords and tenants in some degree better than they now\r\nare; to place the Irish land system on a somewhat less precarious basis.\r\nIn the first place, the law as to the exemption of tenants' improvements\r\nfrom rent, an excrescence on the Land Act of 1881, and made extravagant by\r\nthe Land Act of 1896, should be restricted in its application to some\r\nextent; as it stands, it is a fruitful cause of injustice, of\r\ndemoralisation, and of hard swearing, producing endless litigation to very\r\nlittle purpose; claims in respect of improvements ought to be more\r\nlimited, in point of time, than they are; a check should be placed on\r\nobsolete and illusory claims; this would be advantageous, I think, to all\r\ninterests involved. Again, it would be impracticable to exclude from the\r\noperation of the present land code lands that have been already brought\r\nwithin its scope; but a more precise definition should be made of the\r\nlands that are intended to be now excluded--demesnes, town parks,\r\nresidential holdings, and large pastoral farms; the decisions of the\r\nCourts, in this province, are very perplexing; a good definition would\r\nmake litigation very considerably less. These changes, I am convinced,\r\nwould do much appreciable good; but I would go a long way farther in\r\nattempting to make the status of both landlord and tenant in Ireland less\r\ninsecure and vexatious than it now is. In the first place, leaving lands\r\nnow excluded out, I would make all agricultural and pastoral Irish tenants\r\nentitled to the tenure of the 'Three F's,' removing the prohibition as to\r\n'future tenants,' a distinction that never ought to have been made, and,\r\nas far as possible, securing this mode of tenure to the poorest tenants,\r\nby means to which I shall advert afterwards. In the next place, I would\r\nmake an earnest effort to lessen the ruinous litigation and the\r\ninstability caused by the statutory leases renewable at short intervals of\r\ntime. The tenant should have 'fixity of tenure' in a real sense; the\r\nestate created in his favour against the landlord ought not to be one of\r\nfifteen years only, however indefinitely it may be extended; I would\r\nprefer to see it an estate for ever; but, as in the present state of\r\nagriculture, there would be objections to this, on account of the\r\nuncertainty of the rate of rent, it might be an estate for a limited term.\r\nBut the term ought not to be less than thirty years at least, renewable,\r\nof course, like the shorter term of fifteen; this would quiet possession\r\nand get rid of lawsuits for the period of a generation of men. The tenant\r\nshould retain his right of 'free sale;' but I would make the conditions\r\nless stringent than they are under the existing law.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Irish tenant would thus be greatly improved; the\r\nsphere of the 'Three F's' would be largely extended; he would have 'fixity\r\nof tenure,' for a long time, at least, without the hazard and loss of\r\nlitigation every fifteen years; his right of 'free sale' would be less\r\nrestricted; and he would have distinct advantages, as respects 'fair\r\nrent,' under the part of my plan I am about to explain. I turn to the\r\nposition of the Irish 'landlord'--I still use this expression and that of\r\n'tenant,' though both words are hardly applicable to existing facts; this,\r\ntoo, in my judgment, would be made much better. The estate that is now\r\ncreated against him would still be preserved; I wish it were a perpetual\r\nestate, but it would be one for thirty years at least; he would,\r\ntherefore, remain assimilated to a rent-charger, as he is at present. But\r\nlike his tenant he would be comparatively free from lawsuits; he would be\r\nless harassed by claims in respect of improvements; he would have, in many\r\nparticulars, a more stable tenure. He should, of course, retain the\r\n'royalties' still reserved to him--mines, minerals, timber, and such\r\nthings; and he should have the title to the statutory conditions he now\r\nhas; but as his reversionary rights would be somewhat lessened, he should\r\nbe compensated for these by a small money payment. With one great\r\nexception he should have the legal remedies to enforce the rights he now\r\npossesses; and that exception would be of great importance. I have always\r\nthought the law of ejectment for non-payment of rent harsh; it is an\r\ninnovation on the ancient Common Law; it sometimes causes forfeitures far\r\nfrom just; it is not properly applicable to tenancies of long duration. I\r\nwould certainly abolish this mode of procedure; I would instead of it give\r\nthe landlord a power to sell the tenant's lands, by a procedure analogous\r\nto that of bankruptcy, should default be made in the payment of the rent,\r\nor rather the rent-charge that might be due. The advantage to both\r\nlandlord and tenant would be great: the first would have a remedy more\r\nexpeditious and just than he has; the second, should the land be sold and\r\nlost to him, would, as a rule, have a surplus over and above his debts;\r\nunlike what is sometimes the case in evictions, he would realise for\r\nhimself his whole legitimate interest in the land. This single reform\r\nwould do much to make 'fair rent' a less onerous charge than it now is.\r\n\r\nBy these means the status of the Irish landlord would be made by many\r\ndegrees more secure; the Irish tenant would acquire an interest in the\r\nland much more durable and stable than he has now, in fact, nearly\r\nequivalent to full ownership, subject to a rent-charge; and if his\r\ninterest were made a perpetuity, as I hope would be the case at last, he\r\nwould be assimilated to an owner subject to a perpetual rent, or to an\r\nEnglish copyholder subject to a similar render. This is the position Burke\r\nproposed he should have, considerably more than a century ago;[149] it is\r\nthat which has been advocated by John Stuart Mill, and, I am happy to add,\r\nby Mr. John Morley; it is the only position, compatible with common sense\r\nand justice, which the new Irish land code has left possible, for I put\r\nthe quackery of compulsory purchase out of sight, and voluntary purchase\r\nis a bad half-measure. The great subject of fixing rent by the State would\r\nremain; for, unjustifiable as this expedient is, it is impossible, after\r\nwhat has happened, to dispense with it. Without imputing personal motives\r\nor moral blame to any one, the Land Commission and its Sub-Commissions\r\nought, I am convinced, to cease to be the agency to fix 'fair rents;'\r\nhowever unconsciously, in my judgment, they have often proceeded on false\r\nprinciples, and have done immense, if not wilful wrong; they are decried\r\nby landlords and tenants alike in Ireland. Besides, there is a\r\nconstitutional objection to their adjusting rent; the Land Commission is\r\nentrusted with the task of carrying out 'land purchase;' it has a direct\r\ninducement to whittle rents away, in order to facilitate the sale of land;\r\nits interest and its duty are thus placed in conflict. Be this as it may,\r\nmy plan for fixing 'fair rents' in Ireland by the State would be\r\naltogether different. In the first place, a definition of 'fair rent'\r\nshould be made by statute, and should dominate, so to speak, the subject;\r\nthe omission of this criterion has caused grave injustice. This having\r\nbeen made, I would adjust Irish rents by a method much better, I believe,\r\nthan that now in existence. A body of competent and well-paid valuers of\r\nland should be formed--there would be no difficulty about this in\r\nIreland; these men should visit, when required, estates; and having heard\r\nwhat landlords and tenants had to say on the spot, should declare what\r\nthey consider the 'fair rents' of farms, making a deduction for\r\nimprovements as arranged by a reformed law, and taking waste and\r\ndeterioration into account. The reports made by the valuers should be\r\ncomplete and explicit; they would probably satisfy landlords and tenants\r\nin most instances; but dissatisfied persons should have a right to an\r\nappeal, which should be a full rehearing of all the facts in issue; but\r\nthe appeal should be at the peril of costs against unsuccessful suitors.\r\nThe tribunals to decide the appeals should, I suggest, be composed of two\r\neminent judges, for each of the four provinces, assisted by trained\r\nagricultural experts; but the authority of the judges should prevail on\r\nall questions. From these Courts a further appeal should run to the Court\r\nof Appeal in Ireland, on all matters of law and fact, and ultimately\r\nshould run to the House of Lords; the present restricted appeal to the\r\nLand Commission has been little better than a sorry mockery of right.\r\n\r\nThe scheme I propose has obvious defects; it sanctions the vicious\r\nprinciple of State-settled rents, a thing unknown in lands outside of\r\nIreland, a defiance of the simplest axioms of economic science. But it\r\nendeavours at least to improve a bad system of tenure dealing with\r\naccomplished facts now beyond recall; I certainly think it would make the\r\nrelations of Irish landlords and tenants better than they are, and would\r\ntend to place both classes in the positions which, as affairs now stand,\r\nthey will probably, in the long run, occupy. As regards 'alternative\r\npolicies,' as they have been called, I have set forth the reasons that the\r\ncompulsory purchase of the Irish land would be, I believe, impossible,\r\nand, were it possible, would be a confiscation of the foullest kind,\r\nruinous to Great Britain and Ireland alike. I have also shown how the\r\npresent system of so-styled 'voluntary purchase' is, in my judgment,\r\nessentially immoral, and pregnant with dangers; and I have indicated the\r\nresults being already produced. That system, however, must go on; for the\r\npresent it cannot be arrested; a Conservative Government still pins its\r\nfaith on it, as a Whig Government, half a century ago, pinned its faith on\r\nthe Encumbered Estates Act; but a 'peasant proprietary' rooted in\r\ncorruption will hardly succeed, and 'voluntary purchase' draws the worst\r\nkind of distinctions in Irish land tenure. The acceleration, indeed, of\r\nthis 'remedy' has been deemed advisable; and as long as the sum voted by\r\nParliament is not expended, the system evidently must continue in force.\r\nSome of its evils, however, would be lessened were the State to reserve to\r\nitself the woodland, which tenant 'purchasers,' as a rule, cut down and\r\nsell; and if tenants proved to be solvent were compelled to advance part\r\nof the money required to transfer their lands to themselves. It is\r\nrevolting to my mind to see a wealthy Irish farmer bribed into the\r\nownership of his farm by an Act of the State, without having paid a\r\nshilling of the price. I commend this spectacle to the hard-pressed\r\ngeneral taxpayer.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that, under the scheme I propose, existing interests of\r\ntenants should remain intact, and statutory leases should be allowed to\r\ncome to an end, before a change should be made by law in the position they\r\nhold. The question of compensating the Irish landlords would remain; a\r\nvery few words on this will suffice. I must remind the reader, as I have\r\nalready shown, that the Land Act of 1881 was passed on the condition that,\r\nshould experience prove that real injury had been done to this order of\r\nmen, their right to indemnity would be plain; Mr. Gladstone's language was\r\nunequivocal; the House of Commons approved. Nor can any reasonable doubt\r\nexist that the course of legislation from 1881 to 1896 has confiscated the\r\nproperty of the class to an immense extent; the simple fact that the\r\nvalue in Ireland of the fee simple in land has been reduced by a third at\r\nleast, and that the value of the tenant right has been increased in about\r\nthe same proportion, points to a conclusion evident to impartial minds. I\r\nam satisfied as to what would be the report on this subject of the\r\nCommission I should wish to see appointed; it could not avoid drawing an\r\ninference that cannot be resisted. The question, therefore, will have to\r\nbe faced; the good faith of Parliament is virtually at stake; and if a\r\npledge made in the name of the State is not to be broken, the right of the\r\nIrish landlords to compensation is complete. Independently, too, of\r\nconsiderations of this kind, it is a recognised principle that should a\r\npolicy have caused loss to a class, the State is morally bound to make the\r\nloss up; a violation of this principle is unjust and dangerous alike. I\r\nquote from John Stuart Mill on this very question: 'The principle of\r\nproperty gives the landowners no right to the land, but only a right to\r\ncompensation for whatever portion of their interest in the land it may be\r\nthe policy of the State to deprive them of. To that their claim is\r\nindefeasible. It is due to landowners and to owners of any property\r\nwhatever, recognised as such by the State, that they should not be\r\ndispossessed of it without receiving its pecuniary value, or an annual\r\nincome equal to what they have derived from it. If the land was bought\r\nwith the produce of the labour of themselves or their ancestors,\r\ncompensation is due to them on that ground; even if otherwise, it is still\r\ndue on the ground of prescription. Nor can it ever be necessary for\r\naccomplishing an object by which the community altogether will gain, that\r\na particular portion of the community should be immolated. When the\r\nproperty is of a kind to which peculiar affections attach themselves, the\r\ncompensation ought to exceed a bare pecuniary equivalent.... The\r\nlegislature, which, if it pleased, might convert the whole body of\r\nlandlords into fundholders or pensioners, might, _a fortiori_, commute\r\nthe average receipts of Irish landowners into a fixed rent-charge, and\r\nraise the tenants into proprietors; supposing always that the full market\r\nvalue of the land was tendered to the landlords, in case they preferred\r\nthat to accepting the conditions proposed.'[150]\r\n\r\nAssuming, then, the case for compensating the Irish landlords to have been\r\nmade out, compensation can be afforded without the loss of a shilling to\r\nthe State. The _bona fide_ encumbrances on their estates, that is, those\r\nwhich represent advances in cash, are now at an interest of from 4 to 5\r\nper cent.; the State could pay off those which were perfectly secure at an\r\ninterest of 2-1/4 per cent., and could make the landlords chargeable with\r\ninterest at 3 per cent., in order to provide against possible loss. As for\r\nencumbrances that were not perfectly secure, the State should only pay off\r\nwhat was well charged; but it should do this on the same conditions; and\r\nit should declare hopeless encumbrances extinct. This would be a\r\nconsiderable and just boon to the Irish landlords; the securities taken\r\nby the State should be in the form of debentures, which would pass from\r\nhand to hand in the market; and many owners of encumbrances would no doubt\r\naccept sums less than their full demands, for these, they well know, are\r\nat present in danger. I would go, however, farther in relieving the Irish\r\nlandlords; their estates are subject to a mass of family charges created\r\nunder a different order of things; if the State has arbitrarily cut down\r\nthe fund set apart for these, by a wholesale reduction of rents, I cannot\r\nunderstand how it is not the simplest justice to cut the charges down in\r\nsome fair proportion. At all events, I make these suggestions for what\r\nthey may be worth; if right is to be done to the Irish landed gentry, and\r\na gross breach of public faith is not to be made, some relief of this kind\r\nshould be extended to them. Very possibly this will not be afforded; but I\r\nventure to remind politicians that even an unpopular class cannot be\r\ncruelly wronged and sacrificed, without doing injury to all classes, and\r\nshaking to their foundations the clear rights of property. And I openly\r\navow that, in my judgment, it would be in the highest degree against the\r\nnational interest to annihilate this body of men, as must probably happen,\r\nshould things in Ireland be left as they are. What if they are the heirs\r\nof conquest and confiscation in the past? Is that a reason for destroying\r\nthem after the lapse of centuries, and when England planted them in the\r\nland to be her mainstay? What if, in instances, comparatively few in the\r\nextreme, they have abused the social trust imposed on them? Was not this\r\nbecause the opportunity was given by law, and was not the law the work of\r\nsuccessive Parliaments? Is it not a fact that British ministers, so to\r\nspeak, of yesterday, declared that they were secure in their proprietary\r\nrights; and that Mr. Gladstone solemnly acquitted them of what had been\r\nlaid to their charge? On the other hand, have they not been for ages the\r\nstaunchest friends of England in Irish affairs, especially in troubled\r\nand perilous times? Is it for nothing that they have been called the\r\nBritish garrison by her foes, the strongest obstacle to rebellion and\r\ntreason? And is a class, which has, on the whole, been a civilising\r\ninfluence, for many years, in Ireland, and which has given the State far\r\nmore than a due proportion of worthies--warriors, orators, statesmen,\r\nthinkers, men of eminence in all the arts of life--to be sacrificed at the\r\nbidding of a conspiracy bent on subverting British rule in Ireland, or in\r\ndeference to false and perilous theories?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTION OF THE FINANCIAL RELATIONS BETWEEN GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND\r\n\r\n    The subject briefly considered--Financial position of Ireland before\r\n    1782, and under Grattan's Parliament--Her taxation and debt small\r\n    before 1798--Ireland financially a distinct country--At the Union,\r\n    Pitt wished to 'assimilate her in finance' with Great Britain, but\r\n    this impossible, and why--Ireland's contribution after the Union--This\r\n    was unjust, but it left her financially a distinct country--Ireland\r\n    made nearly bankrupt--The compromise of 1816--The Irish Exchequer\r\n    closed, and the Irish and British debts consolidated--The object of\r\n    the compromise was rather to relieve Ireland from her burdens than to\r\n    assimilate her in finance with Great Britain--She still remained for\r\n    many years financially distinct from Great Britain, and is so still to\r\n    some extent--The conduct of Peel a striking proof of this--Mr.\r\n    Gladstone imposes the income tax on Ireland, and her spirit duties are\r\n    largely raised--Injustice of this policy--The Committee of\r\n    1863-64--Ireland does not obtain financial justice--The Report of the\r\n    Childers Commission made upon a reference by Mr. Gladstone following\r\n    Mr. Goschen--The Commission declares that Ireland has been greatly\r\n    overtaxed for many years--Evidence on which it has founded this\r\n    conclusion--Examination of arguments to the contrary--Another\r\n    Commission promised, but the promise not fulfilled--Importance of\r\n    settling this question.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe financial relations between Great Britain and Ireland have been a\r\nsubject, at intervals of time, no doubt, of strong controversy during a\r\nwhole century. I shall not harp on the saying of Johnson to an Irish\r\nfriend, 'Avoid a Union with England, she will only rob you;' but, in the\r\nopinion of well-informed Irishmen, the fiscal treatment of Ireland, since\r\n1800-01, strikingly illustrates the significant remark of Burke, 'When any\r\ncommunity is subordinately connected with another, the great danger of the\r\nconnection is, the extreme pride and self-complacency of the superior,\r\nwhich, in all matters of controversy, will probably decide in its own\r\nfavour.' There is no reason to impeach the good faith of Pitt and\r\nCastlereagh; but the financial arrangements they made for Ireland, when\r\nthe Union became law, were denounced by the most distinguished Irishmen of\r\nthe day; these imposed on Ireland an overwhelming burden, and, in fact,\r\nreduced her to the very edge of bankruptcy. A compromise was effected in\r\n1816-17; this has been described as a generous boon to Ireland; but it was\r\nat best a slight relief from injustice; and it weakened securities she had\r\nagainst fiscal exaction, while it involved her in liabilities which, if\r\nremote, were not the less possible. It is a most significant fact that\r\nPeel, who, as Chief Secretary from 1812 to 1818, was familiar with the\r\neconomic state of Ireland, refused, though under the strongest\r\ninducements, to apply to Ireland the fiscal charges extended to her by one\r\nof his brilliant successors; the most sagacious financier of the\r\nnineteenth century played, in this matter, a very different part from the\r\nmost impulsive and not the least unscrupulous. In 1853, and from thence in\r\nother years, Mr. Gladstone, in order to carry out a policy distinctly\r\nopposed to many Irish interests, subjected Ireland to a sudden and heavy\r\nload of taxation, exactly at the time when, for the plainest reasons, she\r\nought to have been exempted from it; from that day to this, Irishmen, who\r\nunderstand the question, are agreed that this was gross, nay, cruel,\r\ninjustice. The whole subject of British and Irish financial relations was\r\nsent by Mr. Gladstone to a Commission in 1893, here following the example\r\nof Mr. Goschen; a careful inquiry was held during many months; the Report\r\nof the Commission was startling and important in the extreme. This\r\ntribunal, mainly composed of eminent English experts, announced, and that\r\nalmost with one voice, that Ireland was being enormously overtaxed, and\r\nhad been for upwards of forty years; and it plainly intimated that a\r\nremedy for this wrong should be found. No real answer has been made to\r\nthis remarkable judgment; the attempts at answers that have been made are\r\nnearly all mere trifling; Lord Salisbury's Government evidently believes\r\nthat an answer is not possible; it promised to appoint another Commission\r\nto investigate certain parts of the subject; years have passed, and it has\r\nnot performed its promise. Meanwhile, even amidst the hurly-burly of Irish\r\npolitics, Irishmen of all parties have united in a demand for redress; and\r\nif the demand is not pressed with extreme vehemence, it is sustained by\r\nall that is best in Irish opinion. It is obviously unwise, and it may\r\nbecome dangerous, to continue to ignore such a claim; in any event the\r\nfinancial relations of the Three Kingdoms are not the least important of\r\n'Present Irish Questions;' I shall briefly examine it in this chapter.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to dwell on the financial relations of Great Britain and\r\nIreland before 1782 and the Union. England held the position of an\r\nabsolutely dominant State before 1782, Ireland that of a conquered and\r\ndespised colony; Ireland was under the control of the British Parliament,\r\nand was governed by English officials supreme at the Castle. Ireland was\r\nexcluded from the foreign and colonial trade of Great Britain; her\r\nagriculture and manufactures were half destroyed by the selfish jealousy\r\nand greed of her imperious neighbour. She contributed, on the other hand,\r\nnothing to the treasury of the ruling power; she had little or no part in\r\nBritish wars, or in building up the edifice of the Empire, except through\r\nher soldiers in the British army; she was free from British debt and from\r\nBritish taxation. In these circumstances, grievous as was the incubus of\r\nProtestant ascendency upon the land, it is remarkable what material\r\nprogress she made; her Parliament, though little more than a local vestry,\r\nunquestionably promoted her material welfare; she was very lightly taxed,\r\nand was free from debt for many years. She was still so completely\r\ndistinct from Great Britain, that it was not until 1769 that her\r\nParliament agreed that 15,000 men, of whom 12,000 were to remain in\r\nIreland, should be enrolled for the defence of the State; before that\r\ntime, she was only obliged to maintain a small British force within her\r\nborders. After a partial relaxation of the restraints on her commerce\r\ncaused by the stress of the American War, and by the famous volunteer\r\nmovement, Ireland obtained legislative independence in 1782; she ceased to\r\nbe subject to the British Parliament, and to fill the position of a\r\ndegraded colony; she became, in theory at least, an independent State in\r\nmany respects. Her Parliament was all but sovereign in name; Ireland was\r\nnow united to Great Britain only by the link of the Crown; by an executive\r\nalways despatched from Downing Street; and, it must be added, by the\r\ncorruption of her Houses of Lords and Commons. She was thus more than ever\r\na distinct country; in fact, most British statesmen had soon perceived\r\nthat the celebrated settlement of 1782 greatly weakened her old connection\r\nwith England. She advanced, however, markedly in prosperity for many\r\nyears, until the French Revolution arrested this; her debt was little more\r\nthan L2,000,000 for a long time, her taxation only about L1,000,000. But\r\nby the close of the eighteenth century these figures had been disastrously\r\nchanged; her debt had risen to upwards of L28,000,000, her taxation to\r\nabout L2,500,000. This great increase had been partly caused by the costly\r\nexpenditure of her transformed Parliament, which had spent considerable\r\nsums on public works, and on economic experiments of different kinds; but\r\nfive-sixths of it was probably caused by the enormous charge incurred by\r\nthe Rebellion of 1798--one of the most woeful tragedies of Irish\r\nhistory--and by the suppression of that ill-starred movement.[151]\r\n\r\nThe Rebellion led at once to the Union; it precipitated what had perhaps\r\nbecome a necessity of State. The great measure of Pitt was badly designed,\r\nand was, moreover, tainted by a grave breach of faith; it was only what\r\nwas called a 'Protestant Union,' that is, it rested upon false and narrow\r\nfoundations; it deceived Catholic Ireland, and did her gross wrong; above\r\nall, it did not effect its main object, and incorporate the lesser with\r\nthe more powerful country. It left Ireland, hitherto completely distinct,\r\nstill, to a very considerable extent, a distinct State; she retained a\r\nseparate Government and Administration, separate Courts of Justice, a\r\nseparate Exchequer for many years; this shadow of separation, as Foster,\r\none of her ablest worthies, foretold, would give a demand for separation\r\nsubstance.[152] The financial arrangements between Great Britain and\r\nIreland were practically altogether the work of Pitt. A disciple of Adam\r\nSmith, the minister's wish was to 'assimilate the two countries in\r\nfinance;' to place both under the same fiscal system, to make taxation in\r\nboth uniform. But in 1800, the National Debt of Great Britain was more\r\nthan L446,000,000, and her taxation was about L3 a head; the National\r\nDebt of Ireland, we have seen, was some L28,000,000, and her taxation by\r\nthe head not more than 10_s._; this immense inequality made 'assimilation\r\nin finance' impossible. Besides, Pitt, as a matter of course, knew that\r\nGreat Britain was a very rich country, and Ireland perhaps the poorest in\r\nEurope; he was too great a financier to accept the false and shallow\r\ntheory that, as between two communities wholly unequal in wealth, equal\r\ntaxes were really equal burdens, and could be just; he had emphatically\r\nremarked in 1785, when his celebrated 'Commercial Propositions' were\r\nopposed by the selfish monopolies of British commerce, 'If one country\r\nexceeded another in wealth, population, and established commerce in a\r\nproportion of two to one, he was nearly convinced that that country would\r\nbe able to bear near ten times the burden that the other would be equal\r\nto.'[153] It had become necessary, therefore, at the time of the Union, to\r\nplace the financial relations between Great Britain and Ireland on a basis\r\nthat had nothing in common with uniformity of taxation, and a common\r\nfiscal system; 'assimilation in finance' was for the present to be\r\nindefinitely postponed.\r\n\r\nThe financial settlement made at the Union distinctly embodied these\r\nprinciples, and was carried by Castlereagh through the Irish Parliament,\r\nby what methods history records with shame. Like Pitt, the Chief Secretary\r\nlooked forward to a time when Great Britain and Ireland might be under the\r\nsame fiscal system; but at this juncture, this consummation was, he\r\nacknowledged, hopeless. Ireland was, financially, to remain a separate\r\ncountry; she was to have a separate exchequer and separate taxes; her\r\nNational Debt was to be kept distinct from that of Great Britain. She was\r\nto furnish only a contribution to the State; and Castlereagh declared,\r\nover and over again, that this contribution was to be only in proportion\r\nto her means, and that in no event was she to be unduly taxed. 'The great\r\npoint to be ascertained is the best criterion that can be found of the\r\nrelative means of the two countries, in order to fix the relative\r\nproportions of their contributions.... As to the future, it is expected\r\nthat the two countries will move forward together, and unite with regard\r\nto their expenses in the measure of their relative abilities.' By a\r\ncomparison made between British and Irish imports and exports, and between\r\nthe values of certain commodities, Castlereagh came to the conclusion that\r\nthe contributions which Great Britain and Ireland ought to be expected to\r\nmake for the general support and administration of the State, should be,\r\nrespectively, fifteen- and two-seventeenths, that is, Great Britain was to\r\npay about 88 per cent., and Ireland about 12 per cent. of the sum total.\r\nThis proportion was to be made liable to revision at the end of twenty\r\nyears; for this provision, Castlereagh remarked, gave 'Ireland the utmost\r\npossible security that she cannot be taxed beyond the measure of her\r\ncomparative ability, and that the ratio of her contributions must ever\r\ncorrespond with her relative wealth and prosperity;' and then followed\r\narrangements which undoubtedly had the 'assimilation of Great Britain and\r\nIreland in finance' remotely in view; but subject to limitations that\r\nwould preserve for Ireland her fiscal rights, and would secure her from\r\ntaxation beyond her means, and unjust. It was proposed that if, at some\r\nfuture time, the debts of both countries should be discharged, or if their\r\ndebts and their contributions were in the same proportion, Great Britain\r\nand Ireland might be 'assimilated in finance,' and placed under the same\r\nfiscal system; but this was to be on two express conditions, that the\r\ncircumstances of the two countries should admit of this change, and that,\r\nin any case, should the change be made, Ireland--as was the case of\r\nScotland when her Union took place-should have the benefit of such\r\n'exemptions and abatements' of taxation as might be deemed proper, and\r\nthe circumstances of the situation might allow. The meaning of the\r\ntechnical words, 'exemptions and abatements,' interpreted of late years in\r\na pettifogging sense, was fully recognised at the time, and for a long\r\nsubsequent period, indeed, has been recognised to this day by most of our\r\nleading statesmen, namely, that Ireland was not to be taxed unfairly or\r\nbeyond her resources, as Castlereagh had repeatedly promised.[154]\r\n\r\nThe Opposition in the Irish Parliament had many able lawyers--the names of\r\nSaurin, of Plunket, of Bushe are still known to fame; it is to be\r\nregretted, perhaps, that these powerful minds did not examine with more\r\njealousy the conditions under which Great Britain and Ireland might be\r\n'assimilated in finance,' distant as the contingency appeared to be; did\r\nnot criticise more sharply words that might be wrested from their accepted\r\nsense; and trusted too much to Castlereagh's phrases. But the attention of\r\nthe Opposition was rather directed to the Union in its political than in\r\nits financial aspect; it rather denounced the attempt to destroy the\r\nsettlement of 1782 than scrutinised the terms of the fiscal system to be\r\nimposed on Ireland, at least, as these were concerned with the future. The\r\narrangements, nevertheless, by which Ireland was to make the contribution\r\nof the two-seventeenths were fiercely assailed in both the Houses in\r\nCollege Green; Foster described the calculations of Pitt and Castlereagh\r\nas utterly false, and declared that the charge to be borne by Ireland was\r\nmuch too large; Grattan echoed this opinion in characteristic language:\r\n'Though I do not think the means of this country are unequal to any\r\nnecessary expense, yet I do think they are inadequate to that contributory\r\nexpense which the Union stipulates.... The attempt will exhaust the\r\ncountry, at the same time that it enslaves her. Colour it as you please,\r\nIreland will pay more than she is able. Considering these the terms of the\r\nUnion so far as they relate to revenue, they amount to a continuation of\r\nthe double establishment, an increase of the separate establishment, and a\r\nmilitary government, with a prospect of soon succeeding to the full taxes\r\nof England.'[155] The Opposition, too, in the Irish House of Commons\r\nloudly protested: 'Your Majesty's faithful Commons are satisfied that this\r\ncalculation is extremely erroneous; and that on a just and fair inquiry\r\ninto the comparative means of each country, the Kingdom ought not, and is\r\nnot able to contribute anything like that proportion.'[156] And twenty\r\nIrish peers placed this emphatic protest on record; I have space for a few\r\nsentences only: 'Under such circumstances, it appears to us that if this\r\nKingdom should take upon herself irrevocably the payment of\r\ntwo-seventeenths of these expenses, she will not have means to perform her\r\nengagements unless by charging her landed property with 12_s._ or 13_s._\r\nin the pound; it must end in the draining from her her last guinea, in\r\ntotally annihilating her trade for want of capital, in rendering the taxes\r\nunproductive, and consequently in finally putting her in a state of\r\nbankruptcy. We think ourselves called upon to protest against a measure so\r\nruinous to our country, and to place the responsibility of its\r\nconsequences upon such persons as have brought it forward and supported\r\nit.'[157]\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Union left Ireland, financially, still a separate country,\r\npaying a fixed contribution for the uses of the State. The great war with\r\nFrance soon broke out again; England was involved with Napoleon in a\r\nlife-and-death struggle; her fiscal resources were strained to the utmost;\r\nher expenditure became prodigious for a series of years. In these\r\ncircumstances, the debt of Ireland rose from L28,000,000 to upwards of\r\nL112,000,000; and her taxation from about L2,500,000 to about L4,500,000;\r\nwhile the debt of Great Britain advanced from some L446,000,000 to some\r\nL737,000,000, and her taxation from some L24,000,000 to L54,000,000; the\r\ntaxation of Ireland being by the head about L1 in 1816, that of Great\r\nBritain being about L5, the figures sixteen years before being 10_s._ and\r\nL3. The immense increase in the debt of Ireland, much greater in\r\nproportion than that of Great Britain, was certainly due to a large extent\r\nto the fact--and this was frankly admitted by Grattan--that the poorer\r\ncountry could not keep pace with the richer in the gigantic charges of the\r\nwar; the case, it has justly been remarked, may be compared to a case of\r\nthis kind: 'If one man, A, who has been living at the rate of L100 per\r\nannum, arranges to keep house with another man, B, who has for some time\r\nbeen living at the rate of L700 per annum, and to spend L1 for every L7\r\nwhich B spends, then so long as B continues to live at the same rate as\r\nbefore, the expenses of A will not be increased. But if B begins to live\r\nat the rate of L2100 a year, A will have to spend L300 a year, and if his\r\nmeans are not sufficient for this, he must become bankrupt.'[158]\r\nAllowing, nevertheless, for all this, it is not the less certain that the\r\ncalculations of Pitt and Castlereagh were utterly falsified by the event,\r\nand that the warnings of Foster, Grattan, and other well-informed\r\nIrishmen, besides the protests made in the Irish Parliament, were verified\r\nto the fullest extent; as has been remarked by a distinguished English\r\nexpert, 'The calculations of Mr. Pitt and Lord Castlereagh, the ministers\r\nwho promoted the Union, and who declared that Ireland would be able to\r\npay, and ought to pay, two-seventeenths of the joint expenses of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, turned out to be mistaken, and the opinions of Mr.\r\nGrattan, Mr. Foster, and other Irish members, who denied that she would be\r\nable to contribute so large a proportion, are proved by the event to have\r\nbeen well founded.'[159]\r\n\r\nThis contrast, it is hardly necessary to say, to persons acquainted with\r\nIrish history, is only one of the innumerable proofs of the ignorance of\r\nIreland too common to British statesmen, and of their too common disregard\r\nof the best Irish opinion. In 1815-16, at the close of the war, Ireland\r\nwas financially in a bankrupt condition; she could not pay the interest on\r\nher debt; she could not bear the weight of further taxation; she was\r\nexhausted and sucked dry by fiscal injustice. Her social state, too, had\r\nbecome very alarming; her population had rapidly increased, and, mainly\r\ndepending on the frail potato, was already becoming an incubus on the\r\nland; the collapse of the high war prices had caused a sudden fall in\r\nrents and the wages of labour; there was general distress in several\r\ncounties, and Whiteboy and agrarian disorder widely prevailed. The\r\nfinancial position of Ireland was necessarily taken up by Parliament; a\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons was selected to report upon it. By this\r\ntime one of the contingencies had taken place for the possible\r\n'assimilation in finance' with Great Britain of the much weaker country;\r\nthe contribution of Ireland, compared with her debt, was even in less\r\nproportion than the contribution of Great Britain to her own; she had been\r\nleft far behind in the effort to pay her way. In this position of affairs\r\nthe Committee made its report, after a long and careful examination of the\r\ncase; the House of Commons passed these resolutions in May, 1816: 'That it\r\nis the opinion of this Committee that the values of the respective debts\r\nof Great Britain and Ireland, estimated according to the provisions of the\r\nActs of Union, have been, at a period subsequent to these Acts, in the\r\nsame proportion to each other (within one-hundredth part of the said\r\nvalue), with the respective contributions of each country respectively,\r\ntowards the annual expenditure of the United Kingdom; and that the\r\nrespective circumstances of the two countries will henceforth admit of\r\ntheir contributing indiscriminately by equal taxes imposed upon the same\r\narticles upon each, to the future expenditure of the United Kingdom;\r\nsubject only to such particular exemptions and abatements in Ireland and\r\nin Scotland as circumstances may appear from time to time to demand; and\r\nthat it is no longer necessary to regulate the contribution of the two\r\ncountries according to any specific proportion, or according to the rules\r\nprescribed by the Acts of Union, with respect to such proportions. That it\r\nis the opinion of this Committee, that it is expedient that all expenses\r\nhenceforth to be incurred, together with the interest and charges of all\r\ndebts hitherto contracted, shall be so defrayed indiscriminately by equal\r\ntaxes to be imposed on the same articles in each country; and that from\r\ntime to time, as circumstances may require, such taxes should be imposed\r\nand applied accordingly, subject only to such exemptions and abatements in\r\nIreland and Scotland as circumstances may appear to demand. That it is\r\nthe opinion of this Committee that such legislative measures should be\r\nadopted as may be necessary to carry into further effect the purposes of\r\nthe said Acts of Union, by consolidating the public revenues of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland into one fund, and applying the same to the general\r\nservices of the United Kingdom.'[160]\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were partly embodied in an Act which received the Royal\r\nassent in June, 1816. By this law the separate exchequer of Ireland was\r\nshut up; there was to be but one exchequer for the Three Kingdoms; all the\r\nrevenues of Great Britain and Ireland were thrown into a general fund to\r\nbe applied to the requirements of the State; the separate debt of Ireland\r\nwas fused into that of Great Britain, the two making a common National\r\nDebt. By these means Ireland was relieved from an intolerable load of\r\ndebt; but those who contend that an immense boon was thus conferred on\r\nher, only illustrate the aphorism of Burke referred to before; the matter\r\nwas decided by the opinion of the dominant power. Ireland, no doubt, was\r\nset free from an overwhelming burden; but the burden was one improperly\r\ncast on her by the Union; the relief was only a small redress of\r\ninjustice.[161] On the other hand, the arrangements of 1816 abolished the\r\ncontribution of the two-seventeenths, and made Ireland less a separate\r\ncountry, financially, than she had been before; the resolutions of the\r\nHouse of Commons did not all become law, but they at least declared that\r\nshe might become 'assimilated in finance' to Great Britain at a convenient\r\ntime, and thus diminished her security against undue taxation; and the\r\namalgamation of her debt with that of Great Britain made her subject, at\r\nleast conceivably, to a gigantic charge, for which she was not in any way\r\nliable. The compromise, however, effected at this time, rather\r\ncontemplated the relief of Ireland from existing debt than her ultimate\r\n'assimilation in finance to Great Britain,' and the extension to both\r\ncountries of the same fiscal system. For many years after 1816 Ireland\r\nremained, financially, completely distinct from Great Britain, and under a\r\nscheme of taxation altogether different. Nor is the reason difficult to\r\nseek; she was declared entitled, by the resolutions before mentioned, to\r\nthe 'exemptions and abatements' secured to her by the Treaty of Union; and\r\nthe Parliament of that day respected the treaty, interpreting these terms\r\nin their true sense, that Ireland was not to be taxed beyond her means.\r\nHer fiscal wrongs, besides, from 1800 to 1816, were still fresh in the\r\nminds of statesmen; these did not wish to repeat injustice; above all, she\r\nhad many representatives of real weight at Westminster--Grattan was a\r\ntower of strength in himself, and he had very able followers; these men\r\nwould certainly have fiercely resented attempts to impair the financial\r\nrights of their country.\r\n\r\nThe fiscal systems of Great Britain and Ireland, still altogether\r\ndistinct, continued nearly on this footing for a series of years. Great\r\nBritain was gradually relieved from taxation peculiar to herself,\r\namounting to very considerable sums; Ireland was not relieved in the same\r\nproportion; but this was hardly a real grievance; the taxation of Great\r\nBritain during the war had been enormously higher than that of Ireland. In\r\n1819-20 the charge on Great Britain, which had been about L5 per head, had\r\nbeen reduced to L3 13_s._; that on Ireland, which had been about L1 a\r\nhead, had been reduced to 15_s._ 5_d._ There seems to have been little to\r\ncomplain of in these figures. Some steps, however, but tentative only,\r\nwere made by degrees in 'assimilating the two countries in finance,'\r\naccording to the resolutions of 1816; the duties on tea were made equal\r\nfor the Three Kingdoms, and the duties on tobacco, as early as 1819; but\r\nit deserves special notice that this policy was angrily opposed by many\r\nIrishmen in the House of Commons, the most conspicuous of these being Sir\r\nJohn Newport, a real master of Irish finance, who had been Chancellor of\r\nthe Irish Exchequer in 1806-07. Still, notwithstanding innovations like\r\nthese, the fiscal systems of Great Britain and Ireland remained\r\nsubstantially distinct for a long period; this was notably made manifest\r\nas late as 1842. At this time the population of England was in an alarming\r\nstate; the Chartist agitation was in full swing; British commerce was half\r\nstrangled by heavy duties on foreign imports; the corn laws crippled and\r\nburdened industry. Peel was at the head of his great Ministry; he began to\r\ncarry into effect the policy of free trade, inaugurated by Pitt, but\r\nunhappily delayed; in order to accomplish this he had to diminish or get\r\nrid of the charges on foreign imports, and generally to substitute direct\r\nfor indirect taxation. He was under a strong temptation to 'assimilate\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland in finance;' but he had been a friend and\r\ncolleague of Castlereagh; he understood the true import of the Treaty of\r\nUnion; above all, he knew Ireland well for an Englishman; he had\r\npractically been her ruler for nearly six years. In these circumstances he\r\nimposed the income tax on Great Britain as an equivalent for many indirect\r\ntaxes; but he pointedly abstained from extending the tax to Ireland; he\r\nfelt that this would be an act of financial wrong; and though he increased\r\nfor a short time the duty on Irish spirits, he took off the increase\r\nwithin a few months. The only 'assimilation in finance' he effected was to\r\nmake the stamp duties in Great Britain and Ireland equal, and this was\r\nrather a legal than an economic reform.\r\n\r\nThe life of the great minister was prematurely cut short; time brought\r\nwith it its changes on its wings. The statesman who had living traditions\r\nof the Union and its finance had passed away; O'Connell had disappeared\r\nfrom the scene; the representation of Ireland had fallen into a\r\ndeplorable state. Meanwhile the free trade policy of Peel had achieved\r\ngreat results in England and Scotland; free trade had given an immense\r\nimpulse to our manufactures and our foreign commerce; the repeal of the\r\ncorn laws had wonderfully quickened industry, and had been a magnificent\r\nboon to the mass of the people; the prosperity of Great Britain was\r\nadvancing by leaps and bounds. The development of free trade was the\r\nobject of nearly all our statesmen; to accomplish this it was essential\r\nstill further to lessen or to abolish the duties on foreign imports, and\r\nto let in the raw materials of manufactures free; indirect taxation was\r\nstill further to give place to direct. In 1853, and during part of the\r\nsubsequent period, our finances were in the hands of a minister whose\r\nimpulsive nature was upheld by a most imperious will, and who, whatever\r\nwas his policy, seldom stuck at trifles. Apparently without mature\r\nreflection, and, it is to be hoped, with little knowledge of the facts of\r\nthe case, Mr. Gladstone, setting the example of Peel at nought, suddenly\r\nsubjected Ireland to the income tax, and began to raise the duties on\r\nIrish spirits; by 1860 these duties had been more than trebled; and the\r\ntaxation of Ireland had been increased by upwards of two millions\r\nsterling. And what were the circumstances, during a large part of this\r\nperiod, of the country on which this enormous burden had been laid?\r\nIreland, no doubt, had begun to revive from the effects of the catastrophe\r\nof 1845-47; but, compared with Great Britain, she was miserably poor; and\r\nthe Great Famine had shaken her social structure to its base. Two millions\r\nof her population had fled from their homes into exile; a large part of\r\nthe upper and of the middle classes had been involved in ruin; whole\r\ntracts of her lands were derelict wastes; her local taxation was\r\nexceedingly high. The imposition of this load of taxation on a country in\r\nsuch a condition, unjustifiable in the abstract, and from every point of\r\nview, was, in the existing position of affairs, an act of cruel wrong; no\r\nwonder even one of Mr. Gladstone's colleagues has remarked, measured as is\r\nhis language, 'We think that if the House of Commons, in the period 1853\r\nto 1860, when the great enhancement of taxation took place, had fully\r\nconsidered the circumstances of Ireland, they would not have felt\r\nthemselves justified in increasing the taxation of that country by means\r\nof the income tax and the equalisation of the spirit duties.'[162] At this\r\ntime, in a word, the future Solon of Home Rule proved himself to be the\r\nmerciless Draco of Irish finance.\r\n\r\nThis great increase of taxation, to a considerable extent, 'assimilated\r\nIreland to Great Britain in finance;' placed the two countries under\r\nnearly the same fiscal system; made the taxes of each not far from equal.\r\nThis assimilation, however, was still by no means complete--indeed, is not\r\ncomplete to the present day; Ireland has still fiscal privileges under the\r\nTreaty of Union; and this should be carefully borne in mind. Mr.\r\nGladstone, moreover, when he made this increase, acknowledged that Ireland\r\nremained a distinct country, entitled to immunities of her own; when he\r\nmade her liable to the income tax, he cancelled a debt of L4,000,000 which\r\nhe professed she owed; and if this was an illusory pretence, for her\r\nliability for this reason was more than doubtful, and the income tax she\r\nhas since paid has exceeded L23,000,000, still he distinctly admitted the\r\nprinciple--indeed, it has always been admitted by statesmen worthy of the\r\nname. The enormous new burdens imposed on Ireland, from 1853 to 1860,\r\nprovoked widespread and profound discontent; a Parliamentary inquiry was\r\nconceded; a Committee of the House of Commons went into the subject in\r\n1863-64. But the representation of Ireland, I have said, was feeble; her\r\ncomplaints were stifled by the arts of the treasury; the arguments of her\r\nmembers were overborne by specious but utterly false sophistry; the\r\ninquiry came to nothing as regards her interests. The question remained in\r\nabeyance for years; the Irish reforms of Mr. Gladstone, from 1869 to 1873,\r\nthe troubles caused by the Land and the National Leagues, and the Home\r\nRule agitation that followed, turned public attention away from the\r\nsubject; but it was not forgotten by well-informed Irishmen; two real\r\neconomists, Butt and Judge Longfield, insisted that Ireland had here a\r\ngrievance; and this was the opinion of several independent gentlemen,\r\nsurvivors of the illustrious school of Grattan. At last Mr. Goschen,\r\nperhaps moved by remonstrances from Ireland being urged again, appointed a\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons to examine into, and to report upon,\r\n'the equity of the financial relations in regard to the resources and the\r\npopulation of the Three Kingdoms;' Mr. Gladstone, in 1893, recurred to the\r\nsubject, which, rather unaccountably, had been let drop. He directed a\r\nCommission of great authority, composed for the most part of expert\r\nEnglishmen, and presided over by the late Mr. Childers, a Chancellor of\r\nthe Exchequer of Mr. Gladstone, to inquire thoroughly into the whole\r\nquestion of the financial relations of Great Britain and Ireland, and\r\nfully to set forth the conclusions they should form. The scope of the\r\ninvestigation was to include the history of the subject since the Union; a\r\nconsideration of the financial resources of Great Britain and Ireland\r\nregarded as distinct countries, and the principles to be kept in mind in\r\nforming a correct judgment; and, finally, the charge of Ireland with\r\nrespect to the State, and the contribution which Ireland should make to\r\nit.[163]\r\n\r\nThis inquiry, set on foot by a British statesman who had made himself\r\nnotorious for 'assimilating Great Britain and Ireland in finance,'\r\nproceeded, nevertheless, upon an admission that, financially, the two\r\ncountries were still distinct, and that the resources of each--their\r\n'taxable capacity,' in other words, a phrase turned into absurd\r\nridicule--afforded the true and the only test, as to the equity of Irish\r\ncompared to British taxation. The Commissioners were engaged in their\r\narduous task for months; they explained, with a fulness and clearness\r\nnever before so complete, the history of the financial relations between\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland. They brought distinctly out the fiscal position\r\nof the two countries before the Union; they set forth at length the\r\nfinancial arrangements made in 1800-01; they described the compromise\r\neffected in 1816; they dwelt on the fiscal policy of Peel to Ireland, and\r\nplaced it in significant contrast with that of Mr. Gladstone; and they\r\nconclusively proved that, from the Union to the present time, Great\r\nBritain and Ireland had been treated financially as separate countries,\r\ndespite the 'assimilation' of 1853-60, and that the right of Ireland,\r\nunder the Treaty of Union, to the 'exemptions and abatements' secured to\r\nher, these being interpreted as the case requires, still give her\r\nimmunities from taxation especially her own, which must be recognised if\r\nshe is to obtain justice. Turning, then, to the resources of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland, regarded as apart, as being the true criterion of the\r\ntaxation which Ireland ought to bear, the Commissioners reviewed a great\r\nmass of evidence, which, as far as was perhaps possible, made the truth\r\nmanifest, and arrived at conclusions which appear to be decisive.\r\nComparing the death duties of Ireland and of Great Britain, the proportion\r\nis about 1 to 18; comparing the income tax, it is about 1 to 22; taking a\r\ngreat variety of other tests, receipts of railways, savings banks\r\ndeposits, money and postal orders, and letters and telegrams, it varies\r\nfrom 1 to 24 and 16; and an estimate of the income of the two countries,\r\nan estimate certainly not fair to Ireland, gives a proportion of about 1\r\nto 18. There are many reasons that these figures exaggerate the true\r\nresources of Ireland, but, assuming them to be approximately correct, the\r\nCommission has reported that Great Britain exceeds Ireland in resources by\r\n20 to 1; in other words, that the 'taxable capacity of Ireland, as\r\ncontrasted with that of Great Britain, cannot now be more than as 1 to\r\n20.'[164] Applying this inference to the taxation of the two countries,\r\nthe conclusions formed by this tribunal can hardly admit of question. The\r\nrevenue and taxation of Ireland compared with that of Great Britain from\r\n1889 to 1894 has been L7,300,000 and L7,800,000 against from L85,000,000\r\nto L89,000,000, that is, Ireland contributed from 8 to 9 per cent. of the\r\nsum total. But if the resources of Ireland are only one-twentieth of those\r\nof Great Britain, her taxation ought to be one-twentieth only, that is, it\r\nought not to be from L7,300,000 to L7,800,000; it ought to be less than\r\nL5,000,000; not 8 or 9 per cent., but less than 5 per cent. It follows\r\nfrom this that Ireland has been overtaxed at the rate of between two and\r\nthree millions a year, and that for a very considerable space of\r\ntime.[165]\r\n\r\nEnormous against Ireland as is this excess of taxation, it may amount to a\r\nvery much larger sum, if the national account be taken on another,\r\nperhaps a sounder, basis. There is the highest authority to show that\r\ntaxation ought only to fall, in the instance of any given country, on the\r\nsurplus remaining over and above the cost of the necessaries of life; and\r\nas regards the populations of Great Britain and Ireland, this cost may be\r\nassumed to be L12 a head. But if we take the income of Great Britain to be\r\n1400 millions sterling, the cost of the necessaries of life at the above\r\nrate would for Great Britain be a sum of 324 millions; and the surplus\r\navailable for taxation would be 1076 millions. On the other hand, if we\r\nturn to Ireland, the poor country, and suppose her income to be 76\r\nmillions sterling, the cost of the necessaries of life for Ireland would\r\nbe a sum of 46 millions; and the surplus available for taxation would be\r\n30 millions only. On this hypothesis, the resources of Ireland which might\r\nbe fairly taxed--her taxable capacity, in a word--would, compared with the\r\nresources of Great Britain, be, not as 1 to 20, but as 1 to 36 only; and\r\nher taxation ought to be less than L3,000,000, not, as before mentioned,\r\nless than L5,000,000. The Childers Commission, no doubt, with the\r\nexception of one of its members, did not give its sanction to this\r\nconclusion; but it was that formed by Sir Robert Giffen, a master of the\r\nsubject on all its bearings, and it cannot, in common fairness, be left\r\nout of sight. Sir Robert Giffen's view is expressed in these words; it\r\nwill be observed that his figures do not correspond with those just cited;\r\nbut the only point to consider is the principle on which he takes his\r\nstand: 'If you deduct a minimum sum, so much per head from each of the\r\ncommunity, as a sort of minimum sum, though you would not wish to take\r\nanything from a man who had no more than that, then the taxable income\r\nwould be the whole income in each country above that sum. That was the\r\nsort of general idea. If you apply that to Ireland, and take a minimum sum\r\nof, say, L12 a head, you would get upon the basis of an Irish income of\r\nL76,000,000 a taxable surplus, I think, now of about L22,000,000, and in\r\nGreat Britain your taxable surplus would come to over L900,000,000.'[166]\r\n\r\nSetting, however, these last considerations aside, the Childers Commission\r\nhas conclusively shown that Ireland is very largely overtaxed, and has\r\nbeen so for a long series of years; and the figures that represent this\r\ngreat overcharge by no means represent the real difference of the burdens\r\nimposed on the two countries. It does not require the authority of Pitt to\r\ntell us that even equal taxation, equally applied, is felt much more\r\nacutely by a poor community than by one that is rich and prosperous; let\r\nus assume, what is by no means the fact, that this equality exists as\r\nbetween Great Britain and Ireland, still Ireland suffers much more than\r\nGreat Britain. As Mill remarked a long time ago, 'It is not the same thing\r\nto take L2 from a man who has L40 a year, as to take L4 from a man who has\r\nL80, or L40 from a man who has L800; the sacrifice imposed on the taxpayer\r\nis greater upon the man from whom you take L2 out of L40 than it is on the\r\nman from whom you take L40 out of L800, although the proportion is the\r\nsame.' A few examples, taken from the case of Great Britain and Ireland,\r\nwill make the truth of this proposition perfectly clear. The wages of an\r\nagricultural labourer in Great Britain are, say, L40 a year; the wages of\r\nan agricultural labourer in Ireland are, say, L26; the first pays L3 taxes\r\non his tea and tobacco; the second pays only L2; but the L2 are obviously\r\nmuch the heavier charge. Or suppose that a British artisan has L100 a\r\nyear, and an Irish artisan no more than L80; is not the first more lightly\r\ntaxed than the second, if he contributes L5 to the revenue against L4? And\r\nthe same thing happens if we ascend the social scale; the L150 income tax\r\npaid by a British landlord of L3000 a year is not felt by him to be such\r\na charge as the L50 paid by an Irish landlord of L1000 a year; the same\r\nprinciple would extend to the profits of trade were there small sums in\r\nIreland and large sums in Great Britain. Make taxes, therefore, as equal\r\nas possible, and make their incidence completely equal, still, in the case\r\nof a poor compared to a wealthy country, the real burden on the taxpayer\r\nwill be very different; it was for this reason that the late Mr. Nassau\r\nSenior, an economist of no ordinary parts, pointedly remarked, as regards\r\nBritish and Irish taxation, 'England is the most lightly taxed and Ireland\r\nthe most heavily taxed country in Europe, although both are nominally\r\nliable to equal taxation: I do not believe that Ireland is a poor country\r\nbecause she is overtaxed, but I think she is overtaxed because she is\r\npoor.'[167]\r\n\r\nIreland, therefore, on a full review of the argument, has been overtaxed\r\nat least between two and three millions sterling a year for certainly more\r\nthan forty years; and this excess, as she is a very poor country, is, in\r\nher case especially severe. The trend of taxation, if the phrase may be\r\nemployed, as we follow its course, during a long period, clearly indicates\r\nthat she has suffered from grave financial wrong. In 1819-20, we have\r\nseen, the taxation of Great Britain was at the rate of L3 13_s._ a head,\r\nthat of Ireland being 15_s._ 5_d._; the proportion was L2 13_s._ 1_d._ and\r\nL1 6_s._ 7_d._ in 1859-60; in 1893 it was L2 4_s._ and L1 8_s._; in other\r\nwords, the imposts of the wealthy country were progressively decreased,\r\nwhile the imposts of the poor country were progressively raised. This\r\ndistinction, no doubt, has been partly due to the fact that the population\r\nof Great Britain has been largely augmented, and the population of Ireland\r\nhas been enormously reduced in numbers; the charge in Great Britain has\r\nbeen distributed among ever growing millions, the charge in Ireland has\r\nbeen concentrated upon ever lessening thousands; but this will not nearly\r\naccount for the difference; 'the wealthier country' it has been\r\ncaustically said, 'was taxed less and less as it became more wealthy; the\r\npoorer country was burdened more and more as its poverty increased.'[168]\r\nAnd the overcharge on Ireland is all the more grievous because it owed its\r\norigin to the policy of free trade; and this policy has been a\r\nquestionable boon to Ireland, while to Great Britain it has been an\r\nimmense benefit. No doubt the cheapening of the price of the necessaries\r\nand of some of the conveniences of life, which has been one of the results\r\nof free trade, has been a great advantage to the Irish labourer, artisan,\r\nand mere cottar peasant; but free trade has been injurious to the real\r\nIrish farmer and the Irish landlord, and to most of the classes connected\r\nwith the land; and the land is the main source of the scanty wealth of\r\nIreland. Free trade, on the other hand, has been a principal cause of the\r\nextraordinary development of the material welfare of England which has\r\nbeen witnessed during the last fifty years; it has doubled and trebled her\r\ngigantic manufactures and trade, if her agriculture is by no means\r\nflourishing. This striking contrast gives pain to right-minded Irishmen;\r\nthey feel, as Grattan predicted would be the case, that their country's\r\ninterests have been sacrificed to British commerce; and the following\r\nobservations are essentially true and just: 'The change' (from protection\r\nto free trade) 'has not been so advantageous to Ireland, a country in\r\nwhich there is but little trade or manufacturing industry, as it has been\r\nto England; although, as consumers, the Irish population may have gained\r\nin some cases by the abolition of the duties on foodstuffs, yet, on the\r\nother hand, as producers, chiefly dependent on agriculture, they have lost\r\nin a far greater degree by the cheap prices in the British markets,\r\nproduced, in part at least, by the free and untaxed supply of foreign\r\ncorn, live stock, dead meat, butter, cheese, eggs, and other articles of\r\nfood.... It may even perhaps be said that just as Ireland suffered in the\r\nlast century from the protective and exclusive commercial policy of Great\r\nBritain, so she has been at a disadvantage in this century from the\r\nadoption of an almost unqualified free trade policy for the United\r\nKingdom.'[169]\r\n\r\nMany attempts, I have said, have been made to answer the conclusive Report\r\nof the Childers Commission, to carp at its proceedings, to challenge its\r\nstatements, to deny that Ireland has been largely overtaxed; but, with\r\nscarcely an exception, they have been grotesque failures. I need hardly\r\nnotice an audacious sally, which has been turned to account in the House\r\nof Commons, and has split the ears of the groundlings in different parts\r\nof England. England, the argument runs, has been too kind to Ireland;\r\nIreland pays no land tax and sundry other duties; in other respects she is\r\nequally taxed with Great Britain; she has not even a semblance of a real\r\ncomplaint; and--exactly in the manner of Swift's satire--'let her hold her\r\ntongue, or it may be the worse for her.' Ireland, no doubt, 'assimilated\r\nas she has been in finance,' is free from some charges imposed on England;\r\nshe has still 'exemptions and abatements' which, to some extent, preserve\r\nher rights under the Treaty of Union, and show that she is still\r\nfinancially a distinct country, as has been recognised by every leading\r\nBritish statesman, from the day of Pitt to the day of Mr. Gladstone. But\r\nthe English land tax, properly speaking, is not a tax at all; it is a\r\nrent-charge for centuries payable by the land; at all events, the Irish\r\nCrown and quit rents may be set off against it; and, as to the other taxes\r\nreferred to, the cost of collection in Ireland would exceed the returns;\r\nit would be a case of _in Thesauro nihil_, as in Plantagenet times.\r\nAnother argument, of which the late Mr. Lowe was the author, is more\r\nplausible, and has done better service; but it is not the less shallow\r\nand false sophistry, when brought to the test. Taxation, it is said, falls\r\non populations only; it is sheer nonsense to say that it falls on\r\ncountries; it is not levied from Great Britain and Ireland; it is levied\r\nfrom the inhabitants within their borders. But the Englishman, the\r\nScotsman, and the Irishman are equally taxed; the Irishman, indeed, has a\r\nsmall advantage; equality of taxation is the rule in this matter; and\r\nobviously equality is the same thing as equity. An English landlord in\r\nKent, a Scotch landlord in Perthshire, an Irish landlord in Kildare, pay\r\nthe same income tax on the same rentals; so does a merchant in London, a\r\nmerchant in Edinburgh, a merchant in Belfast, on the same profits; and the\r\nsame principle extends to all other classes. A farmer in Surrey, a crofter\r\nin Argyleshire, a shopkeeper in Galway, pay exactly the same tax on a\r\ngallon of rum, a gallon of whiskey, a hogshead of beer; the charge is the\r\nsame for each commodity in the three households. This Irish grievance,\r\ntherefore, is a mere delusion; it is a sickly phantom that vanishes in the\r\nlight of the day.\r\n\r\nThat taxation falls on populations and not on areas of land is a truism\r\nreally never disputed; the use of the word 'countries,' in this sense, is\r\na mere popular phrase. This argument keeps out of sight the fact that\r\nequal taxes, however equally imposed, are much heavier in the case of a\r\npoor than of a rich community; but, waiving this objection, it is a sheer\r\nfallacy. If two populations had exactly the same tastes, used the same\r\ncommodities in the same proportions, and were in the possession of the\r\nsame resources; equality of taxation, if equally applied, would probably\r\nbe essentially just. But if two populations have different tastes, if they\r\ndiffer in the use of even the same commodities, and if their resources are\r\nvery different, and especially if equal taxation be not equally applied,\r\nthis apparent equality, far from being equity, may become plain, nay, very\r\ngrave iniquity. This may be made intelligible, at a glance, by the\r\nconsideration of a few instances easily conceived. Impose an equal tax on\r\ncoals in England and Ireland: would the charge fall equally on Englishmen\r\nin a land of coal and on Irishmen in a land of peat mosses? Tax Londoners\r\nand Parisians at the same rate on coffee: would the Londoner, who drinks\r\ncomparatively little coffee, be as heavily mulcted as the Parisian, who\r\ndrinks a great deal? Or suppose that light taxes were laid on articles\r\nthat suit Englishmen, and enter into the consumption of the millions of\r\nEngland, and that heavy taxes were laid on articles that suit Irishmen,\r\nand are consumed by the Irish millions: would not this system favour\r\nEnglishmen, and injure Irishmen, though the taxes on all these articles\r\nwere the same in both countries? Examples by the hundred might be brought\r\nforward; these suffice to prove that equality of taxation, as between\r\ncommunities, differing from each other in the conditions and circumstances\r\nof life, and notably if the incidence of this taxation is not the same,\r\nmay be made to effect the grossest injustice. And this financial wrong has\r\nbeen done, to a very great extent, if we compare the taxation of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland. The consumption of tea and tobacco by the head is\r\nnearly the same in both countries; the taxes on these commodities are the\r\nsame; admit that this is equitable in a certain sense, though the impost\r\nis relatively more burdensome on the poor community. The consumption of\r\nspirits by the head, also, is much the same for the Three Kingdoms; the\r\ntaxation is precisely the same; this, for the sake of argument, I will\r\ncall justice. But the consumption of beer by the head in Great Britain is\r\nabout double what it is in Ireland; probably ten Englishmen drink beer\r\ncompared to one Irishman; whiskey is the ordinary spirituous drink of\r\nIrishmen. Now, the taxes on beer and on whiskey are the same in Great\r\nBritain and Ireland; but the tax on beer, measured by the alcoholic\r\nstandard, is about six times lower than the tax on whiskey;[170] beer,\r\ntherefore, compared with whiskey is greatly undertaxed; whiskey compared\r\nwith beer is greatly overtaxed; the ordinary drink of Englishmen is\r\ntreated differently from the ordinary drink of Irishmen, one being\r\nencouraged, the other discouraged; though the taxes on each commodity may\r\nbe everywhere the same, the equality of taxation manifestly results in\r\nwrong. The difference amounts to a very large sum; it is one of the causes\r\nthat Ireland is overtaxed.[171]\r\n\r\nEquality of taxation may, therefore, be not equity; it may, as I have\r\nsaid, be sheer iniquity; and this is emphatically the case with respect to\r\nIreland. This system is productive of gross injustice as regards what may\r\nbe deemed the popular Irish drink; but arguments to support it have not\r\nbeen wanting; they have been complacently gulped down at several public\r\nmeetings, it is unnecessary to add within the borders of England. The\r\n'mere Irish,' it is said, have shocking bad tastes; let them take beer\r\ninstead of whiskey and they can have no grievance; besides, whiskey is a\r\nnasty and unwholesome thing; it is in mercy to them that it is excessively\r\ntaxed. Is it possible that people who utter this stuff do not see that\r\nsumptuary legislation of extreme harshness, nay, persecution of the worst\r\nkind, may be justified on the same class of premises? Suppose that\r\nNapoleon, in the plenitude of his power, had declared that the Parisians\r\ndid not know what was good for them, and had heavily taxed their coffee to\r\nmake them drink tea, even Austerlitz would not have saved the Empire.\r\nMarie Antoinette actually made an attempt to banish from her Court the\r\nvelvets and silks of Lyons, and to make it adopt the cambrics and muslins\r\nof Belgium; she would have been too glad to see the first taxed and the\r\nsecond duty free, for she thought the French taste for heavy and gorgeous\r\napparel bad; she only aroused the indignation of Versailles. Or say that\r\nthe priests of the Jove of the Capitol had argued in this way: 'Really\r\nthese detestable Christians are fools for worshipping a crucified Jew;\r\nthey have only to bow down to Caesar to escape the lions; otherwise they\r\nhave themselves alone to blame.' Nay, coming nearer home, might not a holy\r\nprelate of the Irish Established Church in the eighteenth century have\r\nreconciled the penal code to his conscience, by whispering to himself that\r\nthe deluded Papists had but to give up their vain superstitions, and to\r\nconform to the pure well of faith that had its source in the Castle, and\r\nthat then they would be no longer outlaws; but let them take the\r\nconsequences if they were blind to their best interests on earth and in\r\nheaven. In fact, any act of despotism on the part of the State might be\r\nvindicated on these very laudable principles; but on this matter of the\r\ntaxation of Irish whiskey I shall confine myself to a single remark.\r\nReverse the cases of England and Ireland with respect to the imposts on\r\nbeer and on whiskey; tax beer very heavily and whiskey very lightly; and\r\nwhat would Englishmen say of an argument that has been thought good enough\r\nfor Irishmen; how long would a Government exist that would try to carry\r\nout such a policy? In truth, this reasoning, if it can be so called, is\r\nthe worst kind of sophistry: the frank brutality of the Roman proconsul,\r\nwho told the population of a subject province that they must endure their\r\nburdens as they would endure the rain and the tempest, is less censurable,\r\nto my mind at least, than this compound of absurd and offensive insolence.\r\n\r\nAnother argument, really of no greater value, has had many supporters in\r\nthe House of Commons. True it is, it is admitted, that, compared with\r\nGreat Britain, Ireland has been hardly treated in finance; but this is\r\nbecause she is a poor country, and a poor country must suffer from\r\ntaxation, fair as it may be, more than a wealthy country. But the same\r\ninequality is seen in England: Dorset and Wiltshire are more heavily\r\nburdened than Yorkshire and Lancashire, yet Dorset and Wiltshire make no\r\ncomplaints as Ireland does. This argument, however, ignores history, and\r\nsets the Treaty of Union at nought; Dorset and Wiltshire are mere\r\nfractions of England; Ireland has always been financially a distinct\r\ncountry, entitled to separate financial rights; and this has been\r\nrecognised by the ablest British statesmen, notably, of late years, by Mr.\r\nGoschen, and by Mr. Gladstone. This reasoning, in a word, assumes that\r\nIreland is merely an aggregate of British counties; but this has never\r\nbeen her true financial position; it is easy to sneer at the phrase\r\n'separate entity' by which she has been called, that is, a land,\r\nfinancially, apart from Great Britain, but sneers cannot get the better of\r\nfacts. These statements of distinguished English experts are\r\nunquestionable in view of the record of history. Lord Farrer has remarked:\r\n'It is abundantly clear that of the two conflicting theories--viz. the one\r\nwhich regards Great Britain and Ireland as one country for the purpose of\r\ntaxation and expenditure, and the other which regards Great Britain and\r\nIreland as separate partners--the second is the one upon which our\r\ninstructions are founded; the one which has the greatest support in\r\nhistory, and the one upon which all parties in Parliament have recently\r\nacted.'[172] And Mr. Childers completely concurs: 'If apart from the\r\nreference, it is asked why a distinction should be taken between Great\r\nBritain and Ireland any more than between Kent and Yorkshire, the answer\r\nis that Ireland entered into a partnership with Great Britain under a\r\nformal Treaty of Union, which did, to a certain extent, by the recognition\r\nof the claim of Ireland to abatements and exemptions, if circumstances\r\nshould require, maintain the position of Ireland as entitled to separate\r\ntreatment as a whole, so far as relates to taxation. It must also be\r\nrecollected that, as a matter of fact, Ireland has, at all times since the\r\nUnion, in various degrees received such separate treatment. Ireland,\r\ntherefore, cannot be regarded as merely a group of counties of the United\r\nKingdom.'[173]\r\n\r\nTwo other arguments may be ascribed to the ingenuity, if this is the true\r\nword, of the Treasury; but the first rests on a gross misrepresentation of\r\nfact, the other upon a false theory; both, with a slight reservation, may\r\nbe dismissed as hopeless. Ireland, it is said, may possibly be\r\novertaxed--admit this for the sake of argument--but she has had more than\r\nher fair share of loans from the State; a considerable part of these has\r\nbeen freely remitted; this has not been the case in England and Scotland;\r\na large counterclaim, therefore, may be made against her. 'Out of a total\r\nsum of about one hundred and nineteen millions and a half advanced in the\r\nUnited Kingdom, a little over fifty-two millions, or 43.7 per cent., has\r\nbeen advanced to Ireland, and of this, so large a proportion as one-fifth,\r\nor over ten millions, had to be remitted, or treated as a free grant,\r\nwhilst only one fifty-eighth part of the advances made to Great Britain\r\nwere so treated.'[174] So far as these loans have been advances for the\r\nreal good of Ireland, for example, for the promotion of reproductive\r\nworks-these may fairly be taken into account; but millions have been\r\nmisapplied and wasted or spent in the unproductive relief of\r\ndistress;[175] these sums probably are greater than the excess made out by\r\nthe Treasury. As regards the remission of the L10,000,000, the assertion\r\nrelied on is simply deceptive. Not less than L4,000,000 of this sum\r\nrepresent the fund the extinction of which was the consideration of\r\nputting the income tax on Ireland by Mr. Gladstone; and, as the charge of\r\nthat tax has been since more than L23,000,000, it savours of impudence to\r\ncall this a remission; it was writing off a doubtful debt to justify a new\r\nand portentous burden. The residue of the L10,000,000 is composed of\r\nadvances that have been misspent or spent on purposes really not Irish;\r\nthese were not remitted in the proper acceptation of the word. 'The\r\nremaining portion of the ten millions of alleged remissions of loans\r\nconsists mainly of remissions of the repayment of expenditure by the Board\r\nof Works, where it was shown that such expenditure had been wasteful, and\r\nof advances to the clergy and laity of the Established Church of Ireland,\r\nwhich advances Parliament, by legislation, deprived them of the ability of\r\nrepaying. Altogether it would appear, from Sir Edward Hamilton's evidence,\r\nthat in reality only about one million out of the ten corresponded in\r\ntheir character to the advances made to Great Britain, and that\r\nconsequently the proportion of real remissions of loans to Ireland did not\r\ndiffer very materially from that of the proportion of the remission in\r\nGreat Britain.'\r\n\r\nThe second argument appears to be more plausible; but it is mischievous,\r\nin a high degree, and dangerous; except to a slight extent, it is\r\ncompletely fallacious. Ireland, it is allowed, contributes from L7,300,000\r\nto L7,800,000 to the exchequer; but of this sum L5,000,000 and upwards are\r\nexpended on her; she really hardly pays L2,000,000 to the State; the\r\nL5,000,000 therefore, or nearly all this sum, create a just counterclaim\r\nagainst her, even admitting she is excessively taxed. This expenditure on\r\nIreland, it is contended, is for Irish 'local' purposes; it is not\r\nexpenditure for 'Imperial' purposes; the account, as between Great Britain\r\nand Ireland, is to be taken as if all this expenditure, or nearly so, were\r\npurely local. But is not the expenditure for keeping up the\r\nLord-Lieutenant and his Court, is not the expenditure on the government\r\nand administration of Ireland, essentially, and in the main, Imperial, and\r\nnot local in a legitimate sense, so long as the United Kingdom exists? Is\r\nit not as Imperial, at least for the most part, as the expenditure on the\r\nBritish army and navy and on the government and administration of England\r\nand Scotland is Imperial, and not, properly speaking, local? This argument\r\ncould be retorted with decisive effect, if urged in the interest of\r\nIreland against Great Britain. If this kind of expenditure in Ireland is\r\nheld to be local, not Imperial, the same rule must apply to England and\r\nScotland; this expenditure in their case must be local and not Imperial.\r\nWhy, then, should Ireland contribute to such charges as public works in\r\nEdinburgh and London, as the maintenance of the great English dockyards\r\nand harbours, as the cost of the army and navy outside Ireland, and of the\r\ngovernment and administration of England and Scotland? Clearly on the\r\nTreasury hypothesis she should not contribute; and if she does, she has an\r\nimmense counterclaim, so far as her contributions are applied to these\r\nlocal objects. But, in truth, this whole argument, when examined, is a\r\nmere sophism. The revenues of the Three Kingdoms are paid into a common\r\nexchequer; they are distributed according to the uses of the State; this\r\nexpenditure, as a general rule, must be held to be Imperial, not local,\r\nand cannot give a part of the Three Kingdoms a right to make a claim\r\nagainst another. The State spends millions on London which it does not\r\nspend on Surrey; it spends millions in Hants which it does not spend in\r\nBerkshire: does this circumstance give Surrey or Berkshire a title to say\r\nwe can make a demand on London and Hants? Precisely in the same way, the\r\nexpenditure of the State on Ireland, as contra-distinguished from that on\r\nGreat Britain, cannot, at least as a general principle, give Great Britain\r\na right to make a counterclaim on Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to point out how this theory has a tendency to create\r\nlocal and even national ill-will; to set parts of one country against\r\nother parts, and two countries against each other; it distinctly alienates\r\nIreland from Great Britain; as I have said, it is full of mischief and\r\nperil. In truth, however, it is a mere device to excuse the overcharge of\r\nIrish taxation; it has never entered the minds of statesmen. Nothing can\r\nbe more certain than that every great British financier, from the day of\r\nPitt to the day of Peel, and to the day of Mr. Gladstone, has regarded the\r\nexpenditure of the Three Kingdoms, as this is paid into a common\r\nexchequer, as a general fund to be allocated as the State requires; and\r\nhas not regarded it as a fund, under local heads, to be laid out in\r\nseparate districts, so as to give any one district a counterclaim against\r\nanother. I quote from a report of one of the members of the Childers\r\nCommissions: 'A division of the expenditure of the United Kingdom into\r\n\"charge for Irish purposes\" and \"Imperial expenditure,\" cannot be made\r\nunder the system of finance embodied in the constitution established by\r\nthe Legislative Union. All expenditure under that system is \"expenditure\r\nof the United Kingdom,\" or, to express it more briefly, \"Imperial\r\nexpenditure;\" and all Imperial expenditure is defrayed from the common\r\nfund of the Imperial Exchequer. If a part of the Imperial expenditure be\r\ndescribed as a charge \"for Irish purposes,\" this classification does not\r\naffect the fact that it is Imperial expenditure, and charged as such upon\r\nthe whole Imperial revenue. To regard this expenditure as non-Imperial, to\r\ndeduct it from the particular revenue contributed by Ireland to Imperial\r\nexpenditure, to treat the fraction of Irish revenue left as if it were the\r\nwhole of the Irish contribution to Imperial expenditure, and to regard\r\nImperial expenditure itself as not including \"the charge for Irish\r\npurposes,\" would be to do what the Constitution does not sanction: it\r\nwould be to deal with the revenue and expenditure of the United Kingdom as\r\nif the revenues of Great Britain and Ireland were raised and administered\r\nby separate authorities, each of which, having first, out of its own\r\nrevenue, defrayed its separate charges, then applied the balance to\r\npayment of common expenses, which, in that case, would be properly\r\nclassified as Imperial.'[176] And the evidence of Sir Robert Giffen is to\r\nthe same effect: 'The opinion which I have formed is that, on the whole,\r\nit is not possible to make the distinction between the different objects\r\nof Imperial expenditure which is made in some of these discussions; that,\r\nin fact, all the expenditure by an Imperial Government is to be considered\r\nexpenditure for Imperial purposes, and although part of it may be spent\r\nlocally, you cannot in any way call it expenditure for the special benefit\r\nof that locality. It is expenditure for the general objects of the\r\nImperial Government.'[177]\r\n\r\nThe theory of the Treasury is thus essentially false; but accidentally, it\r\ncontains, I think, a residuum of truth. When, as between two countries,\r\none pays a considerable sum, exclusively or mainly from local rates, and\r\nthe same charge in the other country is for the most part defrayed from\r\nImperial taxation by the State, it appears to me that a portion of the sum\r\nso paid by the State may give one country a counterclaim against the other\r\nto some extent. This is the case as between Great Britain and Ireland; the\r\ncost of national education and of the police force is largely discharged\r\nin Great Britain by local rates; in Ireland it amounts to about\r\nL2,700,000, and is mainly defrayed from Imperial taxes; this may create a\r\ncounterclaim against Ireland within reasonable limits at least. No doubt\r\nthe charge of bringing up the young of the poorer classes and of\r\nmaintaining public order by a suitable force, ought largely to be an\r\nImperial charge; but when in one community it is chiefly borne by local\r\nfunds, and in another it is chiefly borne by the common Exchequer of both,\r\nthis seems to give the first community a partial claim against the second.\r\nThis counterclaim, such as it is, has been reckoned, in addition to a sum\r\nfor free grants, at about L500,000 a year by the Childers Commission; but\r\nit did not thoroughly go into the subject; this estimate is believed to be\r\ntoo low by well-informed persons; the counterclaim has been calculated to\r\nbe about L1,000,000 sterling. Lord Salisbury's Government, we have seen,\r\npromised to appoint a second Commission to examine this question at\r\nlength, besides some other financial questions suggested by the Report of\r\nthe Childers Commission; for some unknown reason it has not redeemed its\r\npledge; it is very desirable that it should redeem it. Apart from the\r\nmischief of a delay approaching a breach of public faith, the only\r\ninference that can be drawn, if this promise is broken, is that the\r\nGovernment accepts the view in this matter of the Childers Commission.\r\n\r\nThe Childers Commission has conclusively proved that Ireland is much too\r\nhighly taxed; whatever counterclaim may be made against this excess, the\r\novercharge can be little less than two millions a year. The arguments\r\nurged against this conclusion are mere leather and prunella that may be\r\nbrushed aside; the Report of the Commission has had the sanction of nearly\r\nall economists of a high order. By all means let another Commission strike\r\na balance after making every fair allowance; but if it shall be struck, as\r\nit must be in Ireland's favour, the only real question for impartial men\r\nwill be how it shall be best discharged. Ireland has practically\r\nacquiesced for years in fiscal injustice; in any view of the case she has\r\nno right to call for a change in our whole system of finance for her\r\nspecial benefit. Still less has she a right to demand that her customs and\r\nexcise duties should be placed at a lower level than those of Great\r\nBritain; this would raise a mischievous barrier between the two countries;\r\nthis policy would be, perhaps, impossible; if possible, it would probably\r\ninjure Ireland greatly in the long run. The only remaining alternative is\r\nto leave our existing fiscal system intact, but to make an annual grant\r\nfrom the exchequer for Irish uses, as compensation for excessive taxation;\r\nthis has the support of the Childers Commission. 'The third method, and\r\nthat which most strongly recommends itself to our judgment, is to give\r\ncompensation to Ireland by making an annual allocation of revenue in their\r\nfavour, to be employed in promoting the material prosperity and social\r\nwelfare of the country.'[178] It is difficult to suppose, should a large\r\nyearly sum be found to be due to Ireland, as affairs now stand, that\r\nParliament will refuse to pay honourably a just debt; it would be a\r\nshameful act to repudiate an obligation of the kind. Years ago Pitt\r\ndeclared in his characteristic style that 'Ireland might safely rely on\r\nGreat Britain for the discharge of any fair claim on her; the liberality,\r\nthe justice, the honour of the people of Great Britain have never been\r\nfound deficient.' The time has come to test the value of this pledge; it\r\nhas been announced by the highest authority, in which English opinion\r\nlargely prevails, that Ireland has been immensely overtaxed for years:\r\nwill the 'people of Great Britain' give effect to this judgment, and make\r\ngood a claim which hardly admits of a doubt? The demand of Ireland, no\r\ndoubt, is not sustained by violent agitation and the shouts of multitudes;\r\nbut it is backed by all that is best in Irish opinion; it rests upon the\r\nsimplest financial justice. It is dangerous to treat a demand such as this\r\nwith contempt, and still more so with weak sophistry; not that Ireland can\r\nmake an effective resistance to fiscal wrong, however clearly proved; and\r\nI for one deprecate rhodomontade about 'the Boston tea-ships.' But a claim\r\nmay have great moral force, though it be not supported by physical power;\r\nthe disregard of this claim would provoke well-informed Irishmen, and\r\nweaken the Union perhaps greatly; and, after all, is it a seemly sight, is\r\nit becoming in the eyes of the world, that the richest country in Europe\r\nshould practically impose an iniquitous burden upon the poorest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE QUESTIONS OF IRISH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND EDUCATION--OTHER\r\nQUESTIONS--CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n    Irish county government--The grand jury system in the eighteenth\r\n    century--Its merits and defects--The grand jury system in the\r\n    nineteenth century, and especially since 1836--The Irish poor law\r\n    system--Elected and _ex-officio_ guardians--The local government of\r\n    cities and towns in Ireland--Municipal institutions founded in Ireland\r\n    by the Norman kings--Why they did not prosper--Boroughs and\r\n    municipalities founded by James I. and the Stuarts--Their condition in\r\n    the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries--The Municipal Reform Act of\r\n    1840--The Towns Commissioners Acts--Attempts to reform the municipal\r\n    system of local government in Ireland--The Local Government of Ireland\r\n    Act, 1898--Complete change in Irish local government--The County\r\n    Councils--The County Borough Councils--The District, Rural, and the\r\n    Urban District Councils--Their functions, rights, and duties--All\r\n    these bodies placed on a democratic basis--Attitude of the County\r\n    Councils in the southern provinces--Education in Ireland--History of\r\n    primary education--The national system of education--The principles on\r\n    which it is founded--How it has worked, and what its results have\r\n    been--Secondary education in Ireland--Its history--Its present\r\n    condition very imperfect--The Intermediate Education Act--University\r\n    education in Ireland--Its history--Trinity College--The Queen's\r\n    Colleges and the Queen's University founded by Peel--Their comparative\r\n    failure--Mr. Gladstone's Bill to reform University education in\r\n    Ireland--Its glaring errors and failure--Trinity College thrown open\r\n    in 1873--The Royal University founded in 1879--Present state of\r\n    University education in Ireland--The true principles of reform--Other\r\n    Irish questions--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat local government in Ireland should still be a 'Present Irish\r\nQuestion,' may appear strange to persons only versed in the mere routine\r\nof politics. The subject has been before Parliament for nearly thirty\r\nyears; it has engaged the attention of more than one of its Committees;\r\nButt endeavoured, to no purpose, to legislate on it. In 1892 Lord\r\nSalisbury's Government brought in a measure which aimed at transforming\r\nthe whole system of administering local affairs in Ireland; but it had\r\nunquestionable defects and was vehemently opposed; unfortunately, as I\r\nbelieve, it was permitted to drop. Six years afterwards, that is, in 1898,\r\nthe greater part of a parliamentary session was employed in dealing with\r\nthe question again; a Bill became law which placed Irish local government,\r\nin all its departments, upon a new basis, and completely changed the\r\ncharacteristics it had had for centuries. The measure was to be a _ne plus\r\nultra_; it was extolled by applauding partisans as a magnificent scheme of\r\npopular reform; these have since, over and over again, declared that its\r\nsuccess has been more than manifest. It is too soon to pronounce, with\r\nanything like confidence, on what its ultimate results may be, or even to\r\nsay, with certainty, how it will practically work; but enough has already\r\nbeen made apparent to cause thoughtful and fair-minded Irishmen to regard\r\nthe changes it has effected with grave misgivings; to question the\r\nprinciples on which it rests, or at least the wisdom of applying them to\r\nIreland as she now is; and to ask whether it must not be amended if the\r\nsocial structure of Ireland is not to be still more violently disturbed,\r\nthan it has been by the experiments that have been made on it. Besides,\r\nthe local government and administration of every community, especially if\r\nformed on a popular type, affect its existence in many ways; strongly\r\nindicate what its opinions are, what its qualities, what its evident\r\ntendencies; in a word, largely represent its essential nature. It was not\r\nfor nothing that in his survey of the Revolution in France, Burke did not\r\nconfine himself to the sovereign assembly at Versailles, but turned his\r\npenetrating glance on the petty assemblies which had been set up in the\r\nnew-made departments, for the conduct of their local affairs; these, he\r\ninsisted, formed the truest expression of the mind of the people and of\r\nthe leaders at its head. For these reasons, therefore, if we would\r\nunderstand Ireland, her local government is a 'Present Irish Question;' it\r\nis a question, moreover, which, whatever may be said, in all probability\r\nhas not been finally settled.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the subject, I must glance at the system of Irish\r\nlocal government, as this existed until, as it were, yesterday; I turn, in\r\nthe first instance, to Irish county government. The beginnings of this\r\nscheme have been traced back to the time of Strafford; but it was not\r\nfinally established until the reign of William III., when the subjugation\r\nof Ireland had been made complete. The Irish grand juries always had\r\ncriminal jurisdiction in their countries like their English fellows; but\r\nunlike these they were now entrusted with almost absolute control over\r\nIrish county government. This was partly because they were representatives\r\nof the conquering race, by this time the owners of nine-tenths of the\r\nlands of the country; and partly because there was no local organisation\r\nin Ireland, like the English parish, which could give local influence to\r\nthe conquered race. The grand juries were always composed of the leading\r\nlanded gentry of their respective counties; they were nominated by the\r\nsheriffs, that is, by officials of the Central Government; they were\r\nwholly devoid of a popular element; and as no Catholic could have a share\r\nin their councils, until nearly the end of the eighteenth century, they\r\nembodied, in the fullest sense, the Protestant ascendency of the day,\r\nsupreme in every sphere of authority in the State. The grand juries had\r\nalmost the exclusive power of administering the local affairs of their\r\ncounties, of managing their roads, public buildings, and police; and they\r\nlevied the charges for these by a local rate, known as the county cess to\r\nthis hour, and imposed almost wholly on the occupiers of the soil, that\r\nis, in five cases out of six on the Catholic peasantry, a striking\r\ninstance of taxation without representation to check it. These assemblies\r\nof local magnates met twice a year at the assizes which were held in their\r\ncounties. Miss Edgeworth has given us graphic accounts of them: how a seat\r\non a grand jury was deemed a prize to be sometimes fought for; how the\r\ngrand juries entertained the judges in state, and vied with these sages in\r\ntheir mighty potations; and how, while wretches were hanged and jurymen\r\ndined, the assize towns were scenes of not fastidious revelry. There was\r\nmuch jobbing, corruption, and waste in the administration of the counties\r\nin those days; much of the 'scratch me, and I will scratch you;' much\r\n'give and take' at the cost of the ratepayers. But there was another and\r\nbetter side to the picture: the Irish gentry of the time had the faculty\r\nof command; they ruled their districts efficiently with their police; the\r\npublic works for which they were responsible were usually good. Arthur\r\nYoung has especially noticed that the roads they constructed were almost\r\nalways well laid out and kept up.\r\n\r\nCatholics were not admitted on grand juries until the great Relief Act of\r\n1793, the first general relaxation of the execrable penal code. But the\r\nCatholic members of these bodies have always been few; the large majority\r\nof the Irish landlords remains still Protestant. The bureaucracy of the\r\nCastle, after the Union, began to encroach on the domain of the grand\r\njuries; at the same time the growing needs of the country made the\r\nexpenditure on local affairs much larger. The grand juries lost much of\r\ntheir authority by degrees; they were more and more controlled by the\r\nCentral Government, which supplanted them in a variety of ways; and they\r\nwere ere long compelled to vote sums for public works of different kinds\r\nfor the behoof of their counties. This change effectually checked\r\ncorruption and jobbing; but as the requirements of the counties\r\nincreased, and the 'imperative presentments,' as they were called, were\r\naugmented, the charge of the local rate or county cess became more\r\nonerous--it has advanced enormously in the last sixty years; and this was\r\nstill mainly imposed on the Catholic peasantry. The civil or fiscal\r\nadministration, which the grand juries possessed until 1898, was finally\r\narranged by an Act of Parliament passed in 1836,[179] supplemented, from\r\ntime to time, by subsequent statutes. These bodies were composed of the\r\nsame elements, and nominated by the sheriffs as before; and they had a\r\ngeneral supervision over all the public works, roads, bridges, and\r\nbuildings for public purposes, comprised within their different counties,\r\nincluding within these areas nearly all villages, and the large majority\r\nof the lesser towns. But they were made strictly dependent on the Central\r\nGovernment; this had the appointment of their chief officers; their\r\naccounts were subjected to a regular audit; and their 'imperative\r\npresentments' were largely extended. They acquired, too, an additional\r\njurisdiction in some respects, especially as regards inquiries into\r\ncriminal injuries and compensating persons who had been sufferers, and as\r\nregards voting an extra police force in disturbed districts; but their old\r\nlocal police had disappeared, and had been replaced by the great central\r\nconstabulary force. A change, too, was effected in the modes through which\r\nlocal rates were voted in the counties for public purposes. These sums\r\nwere 'presented' in the first instance at 'baronial' and 'county at large'\r\nsessions, held by county justices and ratepayers of substance; but these\r\nbodies were subordinate to the grand juries, and to a considerable extent\r\ndrawn from the same classes; no popular element was infused in county\r\ngovernment, and the grand juries were, in the last resort, supreme, within\r\nthe limits which had been assigned to them. The local expenditure voted\r\nand assessed in this way was subject to examination by a judge of assize,\r\nwho 'fiated' it, as a general rule; and ratepayers had a right to\r\nchallenge it, by a procedure called 'a traverse,' which, however, was\r\nseldom turned to account.\r\n\r\nThe Irish grand juries were thus oligarchic bodies, survivals of the\r\nProtestant ascendency of a bygone age, and with a tendency, in their later\r\nhistory, to become subordinate boards of the Castle. I pass on to the\r\nIrish poor law system, another considerable department of Irish local\r\ngovernment. As we have seen, unlike what had been the case in England, no\r\npoor law existed in Ireland until 1838; the want of such a measure was one\r\nof the causes of the pressure of a huge mass of indigence on the soil\r\nbefore the catastrophe of 1845-47. The Irish poor law, with some marked\r\ndistinctions, was analogous to the new English poor law, as it has long\r\nbeen called; it has now been in operation for about sixty years. The\r\ncountry was divided into a series of unions, which have varied from 130 to\r\n163 in number; at present there are 159 of these; these were the principal\r\nunits for carrying the poor law system into effect. The unions were again\r\nsubdivided into lesser districts, electoral divisions for the county,\r\nwards for the larger towns; the persons chosen to administer the poor law\r\nwere taken from these areas; and the unions and all that pertained to them\r\nwere placed under the control of the Central Government, represented by\r\nthe Local Government Board of Ireland. The persons returned from the\r\nelectoral divisions and the wards were selected by the votes of the\r\nratepayers, and were known as the elected guardians; a popular element was\r\nthus introduced into the administration of the law, which had never been\r\nintroduced into Irish county government. The vote of the ratepayers,\r\nhowever, was cumulative, not single; the largest ratepayers had the most\r\nvotes, a safeguard, it has been assumed, for property; and the elected\r\nguardians, in theory at least, were balanced by an equal number of\r\n_ex-officio_ guardians, composed of magistrates within the unions. The\r\nchief duties of the elected and the _ex-officio_ guardians, collectively\r\nknown as Boards of Guardians, were to provide for the wants of the poor,\r\nand to assess and levy poor rates for that purpose; but many other duties\r\nwere gradually imposed on them, the principal of these being the care of\r\nthe sanitary state of the lesser towns within their districts. There was a\r\nmarked difference between the incidence of the poor rate and of the county\r\nrate, or cess, of the grand juries. The county cess, we have seen, was\r\nmainly a charge on the Catholic occupiers of the soil, the poor rate was,\r\nto a very considerable extent, a charge on the owners, for the most part\r\nProtestants; for the landlord was bound to pay the whole poor rate in the\r\ncase of the pettiest holdings, and to allow his tenants half the poor rate\r\nin the case of other holdings; by these means the burden of at least half\r\nthe poor rate, it is believed, was borne by the Irish landed gentry. It\r\nshould be added that the elected guardians have practically had the\r\nadministration of the poor law in their hands; the _ex-officio_ guardians,\r\nespecially of late years, took little part in it.[180]\r\n\r\nI turn from the administration of local rural affairs in Ireland to that\r\nof its chief cities and its towns. The Irish towns, conquered and settled\r\nby the Danes, had, perhaps, a kind of municipal government; the\r\nPlantagenet kings conferred municipal rights as freely in Ireland as they\r\ndid in England. Thus Dublin received a charter from John, modelled on that\r\nof his 'liegemen of Bristol;' Limerick, Waterford, Kilkenny, and several\r\nother towns were incorporated and given powers of self-government at\r\ndifferent periods of the Middle Ages. But the municipal life and the\r\nmunicipal spirit which grew up and gained strength in the thriving towns\r\nof England, and secured for them a large measure of local liberty, had\r\nhardly any existence in a land like Ireland, distracted by feudal and\r\ntribal anarchy; the corporate cities and towns of Ireland fell into the\r\nhands of great Anglo-Norman nobles and Celtic chiefs, and seem to have all\r\nbut lost their local franchises. During the long agony of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when Ireland was devastated by a horrible strife of race and\r\nfaith, these privileges were still further effaced; at the death of\r\nElizabeth the Irish municipal centres, with the exception of the capital,\r\nwere mere names and shadows. A great change took place when the subjugated\r\nland passed under the domination of the first Stuarts. English law was now\r\nextended over the whole of Ireland; a colonial caste of settlers was\r\nbecoming lords of the soil; the Government was conducted by the men at the\r\nCastle, ruling through a Parliament largely composed of the new settlers.\r\nJames I. created forty-six Irish boroughs with a stroke of the pen, and\r\ngave them a representation in the Parliament and municipal rights; but\r\nthese, for the most part, were mere villages; they obtained their large\r\nprivileges solely in order to support 'the English interest,' as it was\r\ncalled, in the Irish House of Commons. This system was continued by the\r\nlater Stuarts; besides Dublin and the larger towns of Ireland, there were\r\nabout a hundred of these petty municipalities and parliamentary boroughs\r\nin the eighteenth century. These places, however, could have no municipal\r\nfreedom, and were wholly devoid of municipal feeling; they became nearly\r\nall the mere appanages of the neighbouring leading families; and, with\r\nhardly an exception, they were extreme types of the Protestant ascendency\r\nwhich prevailed everywhere. Something of the same kind was witnessed in\r\nEngland, under the aristocratic rule of that age, but there was the\r\ndifference between a sorry caricature and a picture; the great cities and\r\nthe better towns of England still retained an ample measure of municipal\r\nliberty, and, especially, did not lose the municipal spirit; the exact\r\ncontrary was the case in Ireland.\r\n\r\nA large majority of the little Irish boroughs were deprived of their\r\nparliamentary representation at the Union, but they retained their nominal\r\nmunicipal rights. They still remained under the control of the chief\r\nlanded gentry; and they became, as indeed they had always been, centres of\r\nmaladministration, corruption, and peculation of all kinds. When, after\r\nthe passing of the great Reform Act of 1832, statesmen directed their\r\nminds to the questions of corporate and municipal reform in England, they\r\nnaturally turned their minds to Ireland also, where this reform was\r\nnotoriously still more imperative. After the publication of a masterly\r\nreport in 1834-35, which thoroughly illustrated the whole subject, the\r\nabuses in the Irish corporations were shown to be such--they were enormous\r\neven in the cities and larger towns--that Peel, the leader of the\r\nOpposition, actually gave them up; he proposed to deprive the corporate\r\ntowns of all municipal rights and franchises, and to place them under the\r\nauthority of Commissioners appointed by the Crown. This plan, however, was\r\nrejected by the Melbourne Government, and was not sanctioned by the House\r\nof Commons; after a long and angry controversy, which continued for years,\r\na measure became law as late as 1840; and by this, with the exception of\r\nten, all the corporate towns of Ireland lost their municipal rights, and\r\nwere thus left without any power of self-government. With respect even to\r\nthe ten still enfranchised towns, their old privileges were greatly\r\ncurtailed and were transferred to the Central Government; and their\r\nmunicipal liberties were restricted and narrowed. They retained, indeed,\r\nmany rights of self-government; but the municipal franchise was placed at\r\na high level; the great body of the townsmen did not possess it; and they\r\nwere subject to the supervision of the Local Government Board, that is, of\r\nthe Central Government, to a considerable extent at least. True municipal\r\nlife, and the municipal sentiment, could not, therefore, become well\r\ndeveloped, in the case of towns under such conditions; they showed but few\r\nsymptoms of the wonderful growth of prosperity and power which has been\r\nsuch a marked feature in the history of the great corporate towns of\r\nEngland, in what may be called the Victorian age, though, no doubt, the\r\ncases were widely different--poor Ireland could not, in this respect,\r\ncompete with wealthy and progressive England. The deficiency of corporate\r\ntowns in Ireland was felt ere long to be such, that, in 1854, and\r\nsubsequent years, municipal rights were, in some measure, extended to\r\nnearly a hundred of these towns. These places were governed by bodies\r\ncalled Town Commissioners elected by a kind of popular vote; but the\r\nauthority of these bodies has never been large; the municipal franchise\r\nwas very high; and these towns were also under the Irish Local Government\r\nBoard.\r\n\r\nMunicipal institutions, like others of English origin, had thus, from a\r\nvariety of causes, when transferred to Ireland, only a stunted, imperfect,\r\nand maimed existence. We may briefly glance at the operation of the system\r\nof rural and urban local government, of which we have endeavoured to\r\nsketch the outlines. Except, perhaps, in the instance of criminal\r\ninjuries, and of the compensation to be adjudged by them, where they did\r\nnot always give proof of a judicial spirit, the grand juries, for upwards\r\nof two generations, administered county affairs very well; they were\r\neconomical, prudent, and jealous of expense, if the public buildings they\r\nsanctioned were, occasionally, too costly; but the system was an\r\nanachronism, and had had its day. In ordinary times the Irish poor law was\r\nreasonably well administered by the Boards of Guardians, as well,\r\nprobably, as was the case in England; they were rather parsimonious in\r\nassessing rates, and gave little attention to the sanitary state of their\r\ntowns, but, on the whole, there was not much cause to complain of them;\r\nand the Irish people, it must be recollected, have never liked the poor\r\nlaw. The local administration of the cities and the larger towns of\r\nIreland was worse--a notable exception was seen in Belfast; but these, as\r\na rule, gave proof of the restricted system on which their government had\r\nbeen formed; the results appeared in a high death rate, in bad supplies of\r\nwater, in crowds of squalid and deserted dwellings--in a word, in\r\nstagnation and a want of progress, if other and powerful causes concurred.\r\nWhen the movement conducted by Parnell acquired strength, almost a\r\nrevolution passed over the seats of Irish local government, where these,\r\nexcept in Ulster, possessed a popular element. Parnell called on the\r\nBoards of Guardians, the Corporations, and the Town Commissioners, in\r\nplaces where the 'people' had any effective voice, to rally round the Land\r\nand the National Leagues; he achieved remarkable success in the three\r\nprovinces of the south. This was especially made manifest in the Boards of\r\nGuardians, composed largely of farmers of substance, and in which the\r\n_ex-officio_ guardians had little real power; these bodies set a crusade\r\nagainst the landed gentry on foot; marked them out for plunder in many\r\nways; encouraged 'boycotting' and defiance of the law; gave a free rein to\r\nrebellious utterances of many kinds; and denounced Irish 'landlordism' and\r\nBritish rule in Ireland, as fiercely as they had been denounced at Land\r\nand National League gatherings.[181] The same phenomena appeared in many\r\nof the corporate and inferior towns: the Corporation of Dublin indulged in\r\nanti-British threats and speeches; the Corporation of Limerick refused to\r\npay a lawful tax; the Corporation of Cork proclaimed itself supreme in a\r\n'rebel' city; the example was generally followed in the lesser towns of\r\nthe south; in short, these bodies became centres of sedition, socialism,\r\nand resistance to the law, and widely disseminated their pernicious\r\nteaching. In fact, they made themselves agencies of the Land and the\r\nNational Leagues; at the same time, in numerous instances, they set the\r\nauthority of the Local Government Board at naught.[182]\r\n\r\nThe system of Irish local government was obviously so defective, so\r\nantiquated, so contrary to the spirit of the age, that several attempts,\r\nwe have seen, were made, long ago, to reform it. It has now been\r\ncompletely transformed on the principles applied to England and Scotland;\r\nthe occasion of this transformation was somewhat singular. In 1896\r\nconsiderable relief was given, in England and Scotland, to the landed\r\ninterest by a subvention made by the State, which defrayed half the charge\r\nof the local county rates, the depression of agriculture being so\r\ngrievous; the justice of this measure was hardly disputed. But the Report\r\nof the Childers Commission, declaring that Ireland was greatly overtaxed,\r\nand had been for a long series of years, was published about the same\r\ntime; the Government, probably because it had made up its mind not to\r\ncountenance the report in any way, refused to extend the same relief to\r\nIreland, although it was as much required--a decision that simply nothing\r\ncould warrant. The indignation, however, expressed in Ireland, and the\r\nremonstrances even of the Ministerial Press, angrily as it had challenged\r\nthe findings of the report, before long changed the Government's purpose;\r\nit was formally announced, in 1897, that Ireland would obtain the same\r\nboon as Great Britain, and, apparently, as a condition of this, that Irish\r\nlocal government was to be reformed. The measure of 1898 was the result of\r\nthis compromise; the interdependence of two subjects, which have nothing\r\nin common, has made it not easy to interpret; but, as we shall see, its\r\nauthors have provided, with skill, against one of the dangers the change\r\ninvolved, that is, the probability that it might expose the Irish landed\r\ngentry to predatory attacks. Before examining the recent law, I venture to\r\nmake a single remark. The question of the alleviation of the charge of\r\nrates, a concession made to Ireland with bad grace, and made to England\r\nand Scotland as a matter of course, has nothing to do with the infinitely\r\nlarger question of the excessive taxation imposed on Ireland; relief in\r\nthe one case does not imply relief in the other; the two subjects are\r\naltogether distinct. It is essential carefully to keep this in mind, for\r\nattempts are being made to confuse the two questions, and\r\ncharacteristically to argue that Ireland ought to rest and be thankful,\r\nand not to say a word about her overtaxation, because, forsooth, in common\r\nwith England and Scotland, she has received assistance as regards her\r\nlocal rates.\r\n\r\nThe transformation which has been effected in Irish local government has\r\ncompletely changed the old order of things, and is of an extremely\r\ndemocratic character. County government has been taken from the grand\r\njuries, and has been extended to bodies known by the name of County\r\nCouncils, recently formed in Great Britain. The County Councils proper are\r\nthirty-two in number, corresponding to the number of the Irish counties;\r\nthey are popular assemblies in the fullest sense of the word. They are\r\nelected by the ratepayers of their districts, who possess the present\r\nextravagantly low suffrage; the right of election is also bestowed on\r\nwomen; and the protection of the cumulative vote has been removed; a\r\ncottar has the same voting power as a man of forty thousand a year. Any of\r\nthese voters may have a seat in a County Council; the body, therefore, may\r\nbe crowded with petty ratepayers; and women also may have seats. Three\r\nmembers of the grand jury, in each county, are entitled to sit in a County\r\nCouncil, but for a short time only--a provision intended to reconcile the\r\nold with the new; the County Councils are given a right to 'co-opt' a few\r\nmembers; and the heads of bodies subordinate to them have the privilege of\r\ntaking part in their counsels. The rights and the responsibilities of the\r\ngrand juries have, as a rule, been transferred to the County Councils,\r\nexcept in the instance of criminal injuries, and of determining\r\ncompensation for these; this jurisdiction, subject to an appeal to a judge\r\nof assize, has been properly conferred on the County Court judges, for it\r\nis essentially of a judicial nature. The powers of the County Councils\r\nthus extend to the management and the supervision of the roads, bridges,\r\nand buildings for public purposes comprised within their counties, and\r\nalso to the regulation of villages and petty towns; but, like the grand\r\njuries, they are subject to the same control of the Central Government;\r\nthey must make 'imperative presentments' like the grand juries; and, as in\r\nthe instance of the grand juries, subordinate bodies have the initiative\r\nin part of their duties. Their powers, however, have been made larger and\r\nwider than those of the grand juries; they have been given the right to\r\nassess and levy the poor rate in rural districts, the management of the\r\nasylums of the lunatic poor, an authority, in cases of exceptional\r\ndistress, subject to the permission of the Local Government Board, to\r\nsanction relief to poor people out-of-doors, and several other powers of\r\nnot much importance. It should be added that the County Councils are not\r\nrestricted in any way by judge's 'fiats' and by 'traverses' as the grand\r\njuries were; these securities, such as they were, have disappeared; but\r\ntheir conduct may be controlled to a certain extent by the Superior Courts\r\nof Ireland, as that of most public bodies may be, if only through a\r\ntedious and costly procedure, and they are more or less under the\r\nauthority of the Local Government Board.\r\n\r\nSix of the principal cities and towns of Ireland, Dublin, Belfast, Cork,\r\nLimerick, Londonderry, and Waterford, have been made distinct counties,\r\nwith the appellation of County Boroughs. The scheme of County Councils has\r\nbeen applied to these also; the townsmen and townswomen have the same\r\npower of voting, and the same democratic suffrage as the counties proper;\r\nthe borough assemblies may have the same kinds of members; but the titles\r\nof mayors, aldermen, and burgesses have been preserved, in recognition, so\r\nto speak, of strictly urban government. These bodies, which, it will be\r\nobserved, are popular in the widest sense of the word, have the powers of\r\ngrand juries within their respective spheres; but they retain besides\r\ntheir former administrative powers subject to the control of the Local\r\nGovernment Board; they have thus been changed from narrow and close\r\noligarchies into democracies on the very broadest basis. The County\r\nCouncils have under them two minor bodies, the Rural District Councils and\r\nthe Urban District Councils, the characteristics of which may be briefly\r\nnoticed. The sphere of the authority of the Rural District Council\r\ncorresponds, for the most part, to the Poor Law Union; these councils are\r\nelected and constituted under the same conditions as the larger councils\r\nalready described; they are, therefore, mere democracies in considerable\r\nnumbers. The Rural District Councils are given the powers of the Baronial\r\nPresentment Sessions of the Grand Juries, that is, they may initiate\r\nproceedings as their predecessors did; they are made the sole guardians of\r\nthe poor within their districts, the _ex-officio_ guardians having been\r\nabolished; their chairmen are members of the County Councils; it may be\r\nadded here that rating for the poor has been extended generally over the\r\nunion, not as hitherto confined to the electoral division and the ward, a\r\nquestionable provision which will certainly increase the expenditure for\r\nthe relief of poverty. The sphere of the authority of the Urban District\r\nCouncils has been made that of the larger towns of Ireland, being sanitary\r\nareas within themselves; but power has been taken to increase the number\r\nof these towns, and this increase will be probably witnessed. The Urban\r\nDistrict Councils resemble, in their mode of election and their\r\nconstitution, the other assemblies, that is, they are democracies to the\r\nfullest extent; but they retain the names of Corporate or Town\r\nCommissioners towns, and of mayors, aldermen, and burgesses where they\r\npossessed these before. The powers of the Urban District Councils are\r\nthose of the grand juries within the towns, except as respects the larger\r\npublic buildings, which were formerly charged on 'the county at large;'\r\nthese councils levy and assess the poor rate within their districts; and\r\nthey retain the powers of urban government they formerly possessed. The\r\nLocal Government Board has authority, also, over the Rural District and\r\nthe Urban District Councils.\r\n\r\nThe entire system of Irish local government has thus been placed on an\r\nextremely democratic basis, subject, however, to partial control by the\r\nCentral Government. This revolution, for it has been nothing less, was\r\nobviously liable to be attended by the many mischiefs inseparable from a\r\nsudden transfer of enormous powers to local assemblies of the most popular\r\ntype, to maladministration, waste, and extravagance, and, as especially\r\nwould be the case in Ireland, to violent or insidious attacks on the\r\nlanded gentry. The late measure has provided against these evils, if not\r\ncompletely or adequately, with ingenuity and skill. The relief of Irish\r\nagriculture was its first financial object; to effect this the county cess\r\nand the poor rate have been consolidated into a single charge; and half of\r\nthis is to be defrayed by the State and appropriated to the relief of\r\nagricultural lands, towns and lands, within municipal limits, being\r\nexcepted. The subvention is not to extend to sums payable in respect of\r\ncriminal injuries, nor to sums payable in respect of extra police in\r\ndisturbed districts; these charges are properly to be borne by local areas\r\nas before. The relief afforded is an annual sum of about L700,000; it is\r\ndivided in tolerably equal shares between the owners and the occupiers of\r\nthe soil, that is, between the landlords and tenants of Ireland; it is\r\ncharacteristic of Radical clamour, that a boon, the justice of which could\r\nnot be disputed, was denounced as an 'infamous job' for the behoof of the\r\nIrish landed gentry. A powerful check has been placed on extravagance and\r\nwaste, and on attempts to injure property in land, exposed, we have seen,\r\nto undoubted dangers. The relief afforded was calculated on the local\r\nexpenditure for 1897, in the words of the law, 'the standard year;' it was\r\nregularly to be one-half of this sum. Should the local expenditure,\r\ntherefore, in subsequent years, be in excess of that of the standard year,\r\nthe proportionate value of the relief would fall; should it be a lesser\r\namount, the value would rise. A strong restraint was thus imposed on\r\nattempts recklessly to job and waste local funds, and notably to plunder\r\nIrish landlords; but this restriction only applies to agricultural lands;\r\nit does not extend to property in towns; and it is difficult to say that\r\nit will always prove effective against democratic sentiment, passion, and\r\ngreed. The extent of the relief afforded to Irish landlords differs widely\r\nas between landlords of different classes of tenants; landlords of mere\r\ncottars will get very little; landlords of farmers of substance will get\r\nmuch more; but it is unnecessary here to enlarge on this special\r\nsubject.[183]\r\n\r\nThis sweeping measure, in my judgment at least, might have been better\r\nframed to carry out its policy. Like much of the legislation of the\r\nImperial Parliament, it has been fashioned too closely on the English\r\nmodel; it gives to a poor and backward country, not trained in\r\nself-government, local institutions naturally adapted only to an opulent\r\nand well-ordered country accustomed for centuries to local liberties.\r\nHaving regard to the peculiar state of Ireland, it might have made the\r\npowers of local government it conferred larger, but it ought not to have\r\nbeen as purely democratic as it is; and it ought to have been accompanied\r\nby safeguards it does not possess. I would have been disposed to give the\r\nIrish County Councils a right to take evidence for private Bills on the\r\nspot; this, if transmitted to the Irish Privy Council, and considered by\r\nit, might be made the basis of reports by that body, which could be turned\r\ninto Acts of Parliament, by a summary process, thus getting rid of great\r\nand useless expense, and silencing one of the few real arguments in favour\r\nof Home Rule. I would also have allowed the County Councils of different\r\ncounties, in matters in which they had a common interest, say, in the\r\ndrainage of some of the great Irish rivers, to carry out together public\r\nworks of this kind, and to assess and levy rates for the purpose if, on\r\nconsideration, this was deemed expedient; at present they have no\r\nauthority like this; and such a power would, I think, be for the general\r\ngood of Ireland. The County Councils, too, I believe, might be given a\r\ndeliberative voice, in cases they have not at present; for example, should\r\nthe rate-payers of any county make a demand for sectarian education,\r\nwithin its area, and declare themselves ready to pay a rate for it, the\r\nCounty Council should have a right to entertain the project, and to report\r\non it to the Central Government. And I am convinced that members of the\r\nCounty Councils ought to have some seats on the Local Government Board,\r\nand on other boards now filled by the Castle bureaucracy; this would\r\nintroduce a popular element into these bodies, and, in many ways, would be\r\nof real advantage. On the other hand, in the election and the constitution\r\nof the County and other Councils, democracy has simply been let run riot;\r\nand the resulting evils have already been made manifest. Illiterate\r\npersons ought not to have been qualified to be electors; the single should\r\nnot have replaced the cumulative vote, property being thus deprived of its\r\nlegitimate weight; above all, as is evident, security should have been\r\ntaken that the landed gentry should have a proper representation on the\r\nCounty Councils. The authority, too, of the Superior Courts over all these\r\nassemblies should have been made more effective and less costly than it is\r\nat present; and that of the Local Government Board should have been better\r\ndefined and increased. In all this province the checks possessed by the\r\nCentral Government over these local democracies are not, I think,\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, I have remarked, to say with certainty what the end of\r\nthis social revolution will be; but some of the results are, even now,\r\napparent. There has, as yet, been little tendency in the local boards to\r\nwaste, or to attempts to despoil the landed gentry; the check in this\r\nrespect is of great force; but no one, I repeat, can predict what may be\r\ndone under the influence of democratic sympathies, especially should the\r\nexisting agitation acquire increased strength in Ireland. Some of the\r\ncouncils have been very fairly managed; a few others have been badly\r\nadministered; as a rule, much time has been misspent in irrelevant talk;\r\nthere has been a good deal of squabbling with the Local Government Board;\r\nbut, on the whole, the local business of the counties and towns has been\r\nconducted as reasonably well as could be expected in the case of a new and\r\nimmense experiment. But the consequences of giving raw democracies great\r\nand sudden power have already been made but too manifest, as persons, who\r\nknew Ireland, foresaw would happen. In parts of Ulster representatives of\r\nthe landed gentry have been elected to the County Councils; property in\r\nthese has still legitimate influence. But in Leinster, Munster, and\r\nConnaught, this order of men has been all but completely shut out from\r\nthese boards; the land is not represented at all; this is an absolutely\r\nunnatural position of affairs, pregnant with many ills to the community as\r\na whole. It is not only that the landed gentry have been deprived of an\r\ninfluence they ought to possess, in a society in any degree well ordered;\r\nthis change has a tendency to make them more and more, what they have\r\nlargely been made already, a privileged class without duties, akin to the\r\nold seigneurie of France, a state of things of which Tocqueville has\r\npowerfully described the evils. In the southern provinces, too, the new\r\ndemocracies, composed of Catholic 'Nationalists,' by large majorities,\r\nhave driven loyal, and especially Protestant, men and women from local\r\noffices they had filled with credit, and this too at a considerable charge\r\non the rates, a clear proof how no restraints can be wholly effective. But\r\nthe main feature in the conduct of the County and other Councils is that\r\nin most parts of Ireland they have followed the advice given by Parnell to\r\ntheir weaker forerunners; they have made themselves agencies of the United\r\nIrish League, as boards before them were agencies of the Land and the\r\nNational Leagues, and they have given but too ample proof of disaffection,\r\ndisloyalty, and hatred of British rule. In some counties, the councils\r\nseized the court houses, and refused light and fire to the Superior and\r\nthe County Court judges. Throughout the South of Ireland most of the\r\nboards vied with each other in wild expressions of sympathy with the\r\nBoers, and of hopes that disaster would befall the British army; many gave\r\nfree voice to frankly rebellious language; many denounced Irishmen being\r\nrecruited for the British army. Nor did these sinister exhibitions end\r\nhere; some of these bodies went out of their way to sneer at their aged\r\nsovereign, when she paid last year her last visit to the Irish shores, to\r\nquestion her motives, to speak all kinds of evil; a few even refused to\r\nsay a word of regret for her death, nay, indulged in language of scarcely\r\nveiled insult. These councils, in a word, in a number of instances, have\r\nshown a marked resemblance to the Assemblies of the Communes of Jacobin\r\nFrance, indignantly held up to execration by Burke; they have been petty\r\nnests of seditious agitation and clamour. It is at least well that this\r\nmanner of men has not succeeded, in the great statesman's language, in\r\n'ascending from parochial tyranny to federal anarchy' and have warned us\r\nwhat would be the nature of a Home Rule Parliament.\r\n\r\nThis scheme of local government must be given a trial; but ultimately it\r\nwill have to be reformed, in a Conservative sense, if things in Ireland\r\nare not to be left upside down.[184] I turn to the subject of Irish\r\neducation, which has been lately attracting much public attention.\r\nUniversity education is the most prominent part of this question; but, in\r\norder to understand it, we must briefly consider the history of Irish\r\neducation in all its branches. The first scheme of primary education in\r\nIreland, of which we have a record--I pass over the traditions of the\r\nMiddle Ages--was due to the policy of Henry VIII.; he procured an Act\r\nfrom the Irish Parliament, to the effect that elementary schools should be\r\nset up in different Irish parishes; but, true to the ideal of Tudor\r\nstatesmen--an ideal, however, which he did not always pursue--he required\r\nthat these should be 'English schools,' to teach the Irish poor 'the\r\nEnglish language.' Many years passed before these schools were found\r\nbeyond the borders of the Pale; but, as the march of conquest advanced,\r\nthey existed in many Irish parishes; there were more than five hundred of\r\nthem in 1810, the largest number probably they ever attained. These\r\nschools were originally intended to be open without distinction of creed;\r\nbut, under the conditions of Irish history, they necessarily became\r\nconfined to the lower Protestant classes; they were under the control of\r\nthe clergy of the Established Church, and Catholic children were kept away\r\nfrom them. Elizabeth founded another class of schools, in part elementary,\r\nin part of a higher type; these were known as the Diocesan Irish Schools;\r\nbut there seem never to have been more than sixteen of these; and they,\r\ntoo, became exclusively Protestant. To these schools should be added 'the\r\nEnglish Erasmus Smith Schools,' as they were called, foundations grafted,\r\nso to speak, on grammar schools established by a wealthy Cromwellian\r\nsettler; at one time they were more than one hundred in number; and if not\r\nwholly, they were nearly confined to Protestant children. A series of\r\nReports of Commissions and other records show that the education afforded\r\nin all these schools was not what it ought to have been; but this was to\r\nbe expected in the case of a country where Protestant ascendency was\r\nsupreme, where all administration was selfish and corrupt, and where the\r\nschools were the monopoly of a fraction of the people only. As to the\r\neducation of the Irish Catholic poor in these centuries, it was\r\ndiscouraged, and ultimately prohibited by the penal code; the Catholic\r\nchild could not learn the rudiments in his own land; but in spite of\r\nthis, 'hedge schools,' a significant name, grew up, in hundreds,\r\nthroughout the country, in which, to adopt the words of Davis, a man of\r\ngenius--\r\n\r\n  'Still crouching 'neath the sheltering hedge, or stretched on mountain\r\n        fern,\r\n  The teacher and his pupils met feloniously to learn.'\r\n\r\nAs may, however, be supposed the instruction afforded in these schools was\r\nusually bad; throughout the eighteenth century and a part of the\r\nnineteenth, the young of Catholic Ireland were brought up in ignorance. In\r\n1733 an odious experiment was made, and continued for a long period, to\r\ncause education to wean the Catholic child from his faith. An institution,\r\ncalled the Charter School, was established; the object of its founders was\r\nto make 'the young of the Papists' Protestant, by attracting them to\r\nseminaries where they were kept apart from their parents and priests,\r\nboarded, lodged, and handed over to Protestant tradesmen; millions were\r\nspent in furthering a detestable policy, which literally set up Mammon\r\nagainst God. The Charter Schools, however, completely failed; they never\r\nhad more than fourteen hundred pupils, and they became wretched Dotheboys\r\nHalls where cruel and pampered Squeerses, eating up funds set apart for\r\neducation such as it was, starved and ill-treated children victims of\r\nevery kind of disease.\r\n\r\nWhen the partial relaxation of the penal laws allowed the children of the\r\nIrish Catholics to be taught the rudiments, the 'Christian Brothers' began\r\nto found their schools, under the sanction of a Bull of Pius VI.; these\r\nschools, sectarian, like the genius of the Irish people, have, though\r\nreceiving no endowment from the State, grown from small beginnings into a\r\nnumber of excellent Catholic schools. The Quakers in Ireland had\r\nestablished a few elementary schools before the Union; and so had the\r\nPresbyterians of Ulster. The Charter Schools lingered down to the year\r\n1832; they disappeared when their subsidies ceased; but the 'Incorporated\r\nIrish Society' is in possession of the lands they once held, and it\r\nsupports a number of good Protestant schools. Primary education, however,\r\nin Ireland remained very backward; the Protestant schools did not\r\nflourish; the Catholic 'hedge schools' continued until the nineteenth\r\ncentury had far advanced. Attempts were made to promote Irish primary\r\neducation, in different ways, after the Union; a Board of Commissioners of\r\nEducation was appointed, and made valuable reports; but these efforts were\r\nof little avail for the benefit at least of the Catholic young; the\r\nschools thus established were all Protestant; and the evangelical\r\nmovement, which was then powerful, made them proselytising with scarcely a\r\nsingle exception, a danger which the example of the Charter Schools had\r\nespecially made the Catholic Irish priesthood dread. An institution,\r\nhowever, called the 'Kildare Place Schools' had, for a time, considerable\r\nsuccess; these schools were thrown open to children of all creeds, and had\r\nthe high approval of O'Connell himself; but it was one of the rules that\r\nthe Bible should be read in the schools; they became proselytising in no\r\ndoubtful sense, and ultimately they were tabooed by the Catholic\r\npriesthood. Primary education in Ireland was in this state, when the\r\nsubject was taken up by Mr. Stanley, the Chief Secretary for Ireland of\r\nLord Grey, and, in after years, the 'Rupert of Debate.' He founded in\r\n1831-34 what has ever since been known as the 'National System of\r\nEducation' of an elementary kind in Ireland. The principles on which he\r\nproceeded were in accord with the somewhat shallow Liberalism of the day,\r\nbut, it must be added, with the ideas of many enlightened Irishmen.\r\nPrimary education was to be endowed by the State, but it was to be divided\r\ninto two parts: secular instruction was to be given in the new schools to\r\nchildren assembled together to learn, and that without distinction of\r\ncreed; but religious instruction was to be given to children kept apart,\r\nProtestants and Catholics being completely separate, by the pastors of\r\ntheir respective communions. By these means it was hoped that a sound\r\nsystem of primary education would be formed; that proselytising would be\r\nmade impossible; and that the youth of the warring races and faiths of\r\nIreland, under the influence of a common teaching, would be made gradually\r\nto forget the animosities of the past. The National Schools were to be the\r\nLethe of Irish discords.\r\n\r\nI can barely glance at the chequered history of the institution which was\r\nthus established. The 'National System,' the name long in common use, was\r\nangrily condemned by the clergy of the Established Church of Ireland, and\r\nby a majority, perhaps, of the laity; this opposition was partly due to\r\nthe spirit of an ascendency that would not brook equality; but it was\r\nlargely to be ascribed to a higher motive. The new system, it was argued,\r\ncut education in two; the separation of what is secular from what is\r\nreligious practically postpones what is divine to the human; and this is\r\nespecially the case under the arrangements in force, for religious\r\ninstruction in the schools may be a mere accident. The Irish Protestant\r\nclergy, and many other Protestants, have never taken to the National\r\nSchools; their sincerity is proved by the fact that a 'Church Education\r\nSociety' exists, which, though depending on voluntary subscriptions alone,\r\nsupports nearly two hundred exclusively Protestant schools. As for the\r\nPresbyterians of Ireland, the National system of education fell in with\r\ntheir views; its 'Liberalism' was congenial to them; but though schools of\r\nthis type have flourished in Ulster, the Presbyterians have given a great\r\ndeal of trouble to the Commissioners charged to carry out the law, and\r\nhave shown much animosity to the Catholic Irish. The Irish Catholic\r\npriesthood at first accepted the National system almost with gratitude; it\r\ngave their flocks a rudimentary instruction they were much in need of; it\r\nseemed to provide against the proselytising they feared above all things;\r\nand during some years the heads of their Church in Ireland, for the most\r\npart not of the Ultramontane faith, were not indisposed to welcome a\r\ncompromise. By degrees, however, opposition grew up in Catholic Ireland\r\nagainst the system; and, it must be allowed, not without reason. The\r\nCatholic element on the Commission was much too weak; the purely secular\r\ninstruction in the schools was made partly religious, for books of a\r\nProtestant complexion found their way into them; a cry of Protestant\r\nproselytising was raised; and the National system was solemnly condemned\r\nin 1850, at the great Catholic Synod of Thurles, a sentence, however,\r\nwhich had no effect on the Government. But the real grievances of the\r\nIrish Catholics, in this matter, have nearly all been removed; the\r\nCatholic Commissioners have been made equal in number with the\r\nPresbyterian and Protestant; secular instruction in the schools has again\r\nbeen made strictly secular; attempts at proselytising have long been\r\nrendered impossible; it should be added--and this is very important--the\r\nCatholic priesthood have become the managers of a large majority of the\r\nschools. The system has certainly struck deep roots in Ireland; there are\r\nnow nearly 9000 National Schools, endowed with about L1,300,000 by the\r\nState, and teaching nearly 800,000 pupils; they are supported by model and\r\ntraining schools, and have a large staff of competent teachers; the\r\ninstruction they afford, if not remarkable, is, on the whole, sufficiently\r\ngood. It may fairly be said that the National system has been a beneficent\r\ninfluence of the greatest value; light has shone on a people that once\r\nsate in darkness. The system, however, has become, insensibly, but\r\ngreatly, changed; the National Schools have long been, for the most part,\r\nsectarian, that is, composed of Protestant or of Catholic children; the\r\n'mixed' schools, as they are called, are comparatively few. But the main\r\nprinciple of the system still is in force; the instruction given in the\r\nschools, when the pupils sit together, is strictly secular; and this is\r\nsecured by a conscience clause; the Bible cannot be read, in school hours,\r\neven in a Protestant school; no Catholic school can have a Catholic\r\nemblem. The religious instruction given in the schools is hardly what it\r\nought to be, especially in the case of the Protestant schools; it must be\r\nadded that the hope of their founders that they would bridge over the gulf\r\nof discords in Ireland has not been, in the slightest degree, realised.\r\n\r\nThe Irish are, naturally, a religious people; their history, a long\r\nconflict of races and faiths, has, necessarily, made them intensely\r\nsectarian. The system of education, of which I have traced the outlines,\r\nwas certainly not well designed for them; it would have been severely\r\ncondemned by Burke, the deepest of thinkers on the affairs of Ireland. And\r\nthough the National system has had a real measure of success, it owes\r\nthis, in the main, to the immense subvention it receives from the State;\r\nit has little or no support from voluntary aid; an attempt to impose an\r\neducation rate on Ireland would be a failure, would not improbably wreck\r\nthe system. Nor is this in harmony with genuine Irish sentiment; one of\r\nthe most conclusive proofs is that National education has become, to a\r\ngreat extent, sectarian; the 'Christian Brothers' and the 'Church\r\nEducation Society' schools, sustained by voluntary effort alone, and\r\noverweighted in the race by the endowed schools of the State, show how\r\nstrong is Irish sectarian feeling. The clergy, too, of the late\r\nEstablished Church, and a considerable body of their communion, remain\r\nhostile to the National Schools; and though the Catholic priesthood have\r\nmade them, to a great extent, their own, and avail themselves of the\r\nadvantages they afford, they are hardly in heartfelt sympathy with them.\r\nNor can it be denied that the conscientious objections to the National\r\nsystem have real weight; the system, if not irreligious, is, we may say,\r\nneutral; it does not make religion an essential part of school life. It\r\nwould, nevertheless, I believe, be exceedingly unwise to disturb a system\r\nwhich, on the whole, has for many years had excellent results in Ireland.\r\nThe opposition to it is not strong; the children of the humbler classes\r\nfreely avail themselves of it, and that with the full consent of their\r\nparents. Nor is the conscientious objection of much force in the case of\r\nschools which are only day schools, and in which the rudiments alone are\r\ntaught; this is not the case of education of the higher kind, in which\r\nthis objection is perhaps decisive; and it cannot be said that the\r\nNational Schools have, in any sense, impaired the religion of the Irish\r\npeople.[185]\r\n\r\nI pass from elementary to schools of a secondary kind in Ireland. The\r\nDiocesan Schools of Elizabeth were nearly all secondary schools; but they\r\nwere never numerous, and have all but disappeared. The two first Stuarts\r\nmade an attempt to establish secondary education in Ireland on a larger\r\nscale. They founded the 'Free Royal Schools,' as they have been called,\r\nnow seen at Armagh, Cavan, Dungannon, Portora, and Raphoe; they endowed\r\nthem with lands perhaps worth in our day, L6000 a year; they looked\r\nforward to a time when they might rival Eton, Winchester, and the great\r\npublic schools of England. Erasmus Smith established three considerable\r\n'grammar schools,' and granted valuable estates for their support; a\r\ntolerably large number of secondary schools was also founded, from time to\r\ntime, by benefactors of the dominant race in Ireland: of these Kilkenny\r\nCollege, a seminary created by the House of Ormond, which reared Swift and\r\nBerkeley, was the most conspicuous. These schools, though often nominally\r\nopen to different creeds, became, nevertheless, in the eighteenth century,\r\nunder the Protestant ascendency, supreme in the land, restricted to the\r\nyoung of the Protestant caste; they felt the effects of monopoly, and of\r\nthe corruption prevailing in the State; the education they afforded was,\r\nfor the most part, bad; their governing bodies and masters were often\r\ngrasping and selfish. After the relaxation of the penal code, the Irish\r\nCatholics began to found secondary schools; their exertions were, in a\r\nhigh degree, praiseworthy; and though these schools received no support\r\nfrom the State, some of them have done really excellent work. A number,\r\ntoo, of secondary schools were established in Ulster, for the most part\r\nfor Presbyterian uses; some of these are sectarian, some open to all\r\nfaiths; some have, others have not, received assistance from the State; in\r\nseveral the education given has been, on the whole, good. A few secondary\r\nschools--St. Columba is much the best--have also been founded within the\r\nlast century, usually for the benefit of the late Established Church of\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe progress made by secondary schools in Ireland, even in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, has not been rapid. It is not to be named with the immense\r\ndevelopment of public schools in England, within the same period, caused,\r\nin some measure, by the genius of Arnold; secondary Irish schools, in\r\nfact, have been largely a failure, like other institutions of British\r\norigin. This is mainly to be attributed to three reasons: the higher upper\r\nclasses in Ireland usually send their sons to be educated in the great\r\nEnglish public schools; the Irish secondary schools are seldom well\r\nendowed; above all, the upper middle class in Ireland is small and has\r\nlittle influence. Two Commissions, appointed in 1854 and in 1878, examined\r\nsecondary education in Ireland as it then existed; their reports give a\r\nfar from favourable account of the system. The secondary Irish schools\r\nhave not been much affected by an Act of Parliament passed in 1885, which\r\nprovided for making better schemes for their management; but certainly\r\nthey have derived very great benefit from the Intermediate Education Act\r\nof Lord Cairns, which established a system of competition between them,\r\nand secured prizes for successful competitors. In these honourable trials\r\nthe Catholic schools have done well; but even now the secondary schools\r\nare decidedly inferior to what they ought to be, and do not exhibit many\r\nsigns of improvement. An impartial inquirer thus described them in\r\n1871:[186] 'Upon the whole, secondary instruction, throughout the country,\r\nwas as some one--I believe Lord Cairns--said, \"bad in quality and\r\ndeficient in quantity.\" The fact seems incredible, but there can be no\r\ndoubt of its authenticity, viz. that out of a total population of\r\n5,500,000, there were only 10,814 boys in Ireland learning Latin, Greek,\r\nor modern languages in 1871. Or, to put the matter in another way, while\r\nin England about ten or fifteen in every 1000 were instructed in these\r\nlanguages, only two in every 1000 were instructed in them in\r\nIreland.'[187]\r\n\r\nI pass on to University life in Ireland, the question, I have said, most\r\nprominent at this time. Ireland had no Oxford or Cambridge in the Middle\r\nAges; an attempt to establish a University in Dublin failed; science and\r\nliterature could not grow up in a land distracted by feudal and tribal\r\nstrife, and in which two Churches were continually at war with each other.\r\nElizabeth founded Trinity College towards the close of her reign, on the\r\nsite of a monastery that had been suppressed; it was the intention of the\r\nqueen, and of her two first successors, that this seminary should expand\r\ninto a University in the true sense, containing a number of colleges\r\nwithin its sphere, and probably open to all students whatever their race\r\nor their faith. This happy consummation, however, was made impossible\r\nduring the long period of civil war and trouble, which only came to an end\r\nwith that of the seventeenth century. Trinity College remained a single\r\nfoundation; and, in the era of Protestant ascendency that ensued, when\r\nCatholic Ireland lay under the ban of the penal code, it necessarily\r\nbecame an exclusively Protestant place of learning, its dignities, its\r\nhonours, nay, admission to it, being reserved to members of the\r\nEstablished Church. It had, however, been amply endowed; and, from an\r\nearly period, it possessed many distinguished worthies, the names of\r\nUssher, of King, of Browne, and of others, being still remembered. Trinity\r\nCollege, strange to say, was very High Church during the reigns of the two\r\nlast Stuarts and of Anne; its leading divines preached the creed of\r\npassive obedience; and it was remarkable for its aversion to Presbyterian\r\nIreland, as was clearly shown in the diatribes of Swift. The college,\r\nhowever, became Whiggish and Low Church during the reign of Walpole--its\r\nProvost was appointed by the Crown; and until nearly the close of the\r\neighteenth century, its professorships, its fellowships, its scholarships,\r\nits degrees, even entrance to its walls, were strictly confined to the\r\ndominant communion of the Anglican Church. But a liberal spirit grew up,\r\nand gained strength within it; this appears in many of the admirable\r\nwritings of Berkeley, breathing the ideas that afterwards inspired\r\nGrattan, and in the histories of Leland and Warner, on the whole just to\r\nthe vanquished Catholic people; and after the almost National movement\r\nwhich produced the Revolution of 1782, Trinity College took a remarkable\r\nstep, which proved that it was in advance of the politics of that age. In\r\n1793, when the Irish Parliament passed a great measure of Catholic relief,\r\nthe college made Catholics eligible for its degrees and its minor prizes;\r\nand, but that its statutes made this impossible, it would, perhaps, have\r\nallowed Catholics to become professors, fellows, and scholars--in short,\r\nto have a share in its dignities and its government. Nothing like this was\r\ndone at Oxford and Cambridge until the nineteenth century had run far its\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nFrom this time onwards Trinity College, accessible to Presbyterians some\r\nyears before, received Catholics honourably within its precincts. A few\r\ndistinguished Catholic Irishmen have obtained the excellent education it\r\nhas always afforded; and these have been treated with scrupulous fairness;\r\nno attempt at proselytising has ever been made or thought of. Their\r\nnumbers, however, have never been large; and they were necessarily placed\r\nin an inferior position, for they could not become professors, fellows, or\r\nscholars; the college remained an institution essentially Protestant, even\r\nanti-Catholic, in much of its teaching, for example, in the predilection\r\nit long showed for Locke. The college continued to thrive and to make\r\nprogress; the reproach cast on it that she was the 'silent sister,' was\r\nrather due to the want of publishing enterprise in the Irish capital, than\r\nto any deficiency in literary power; at all events, it has long ago been\r\nremoved; Trinity College has stood for a century in the foremost rank of\r\nplaces of learning famed for scientific eminence. In 1843-44 an attempt\r\nwas made to introduce Catholics on the foundation, as scholars; but this\r\nwas prohibited by the statutes; some 'non-foundation' scholarships were\r\nthen endowed; and Catholics were enabled to compete for them. This was the\r\nposition of the college, when, in 1844-45, after the agitation for Repeal\r\nhad shown how disaffected Catholic Ireland still was, Peel turned his mind\r\nto Irish remedial measures, and among these to a reform of high education\r\nin Ireland. His policy was to maintain the Union intact, and all the\r\ninstitutions closely connected with it, but to create institutions, so to\r\nspeak, alongside of these, to which Irish Presbyterians, and Catholics\r\nespecially, might freely resort, in complete equality with all Irishmen;\r\nhe therefore left Trinity College exactly as it was, but resolved to\r\nestablish and endow places of learning, which he hoped would be popular\r\nsupplements to it, and would give a University training to students who,\r\nas affairs stood, were not on the same level as the favoured Protestants\r\nin it. He founded the Queen's Colleges of Belfast, of Cork, and of Galway;\r\nthese were supplied with an ample staff of professors, endowed, and given\r\nthe means to bestow many prizes; and they were affiliated to the Queen's\r\nUniversity, empowered to confer degrees. The principle on which these\r\ninstitutions were formed was, following the so-called liberalism of the\r\ntime, almost exactly the same as that on which the Irish National Schools\r\nhad been based. Secular education in them was to be united, religious\r\neducation was to be kept apart; their students were to learn the things\r\nthat belonged to this world together; but as to what belonged to another\r\nworld, this teaching was to be provided by their pastors outside their\r\ncolleges, and they were not to have it in common. The colleges, and the\r\nUniversity, therefore, were essentially seats of non-religious knowledge;\r\nreligious equality, it was said, could be only thus secured; and residence\r\nin the colleges was not required.\r\n\r\nThe principle pervading the Irish National education system was certainly\r\nopen to grave objections; these became infinitely stronger, when it was\r\napplied to a system of high education in Ireland. Secular instruction\r\ncould be really combined, and given to children together, when limited to\r\nthe first rudiments: how could it be combined when it should embrace such\r\nsubjects as moral philosophy, metaphysics, modern history, nay, physical\r\nscience, and when taught to young men of the University age? Besides,\r\nreligious instruction, without a great shock to conscience, could be made\r\na subordinate consideration in mere day schools: how could it,\r\nconsistently with Christian duty, be practically excluded from a\r\nUniversity course, and left to undergraduates to be dealt with as they\r\nmight think fit, and that at the most critical time of their life?\r\nIndifference to the Divine, masked in specious 'liberal' phrases, was, in\r\ntruth, the cardinal feature of this scheme; it would have been severely\r\nreprobated by Burke; it was repugnant to the ideas of five-sixths of\r\nIrishmen; its tendency was to form minds in superior men, like those of\r\nHume and Gibbon, in inferior men, to produce infidel, even atheistic,\r\nsentiments. It was denounced as 'godless' in the House of Commons by the\r\nHigh Church party; it was condemned by O'Connell, from the outset, though\r\nthe men of 'Young Ireland' were not adverse; after some hesitation, it was\r\nrejected unequivocally by the Irish Catholic bishops,[188] and finally was\r\nheld up to anathema at the Synod of Thurles. That the bishops were sincere\r\nis proved by the fact, that they established the Irish Catholic University\r\na few years afterwards--the first head of this creation was Newman; and\r\nthe foundation has been maintained ever since, though it could not give a\r\ndegree, and it received nothing from the State, and its only funds were\r\nthe contributions of a poor communion, a noble example of self-sacrifice\r\nand of a true sense of duty. Meanwhile, the Queen's Colleges and\r\nUniversity were kept up and endowed, at the rate of about L30,000 a year;\r\nthe College of Belfast has done well, for it falls in with Presbyterian\r\nideas; but the Colleges of Cork and of Galway, notably the last, have been\r\nsorry, nay, almost useless, failures; and Peel's hope that his project\r\nwould secure a good University training to Irish Catholics of the better\r\nclass has not been, to any real extent, fulfilled. Trinity College\r\nremained for many years unchanged, that is, it gave an admirable education\r\nto a very few Catholics; but it continued to be a Protestant institution\r\nin its essential nature; its governing body and its hierarchy were all\r\nProtestant; its teaching was Protestant in some of its parts; its higher\r\nhonours were a monopoly of the favoured communion.\r\n\r\nThe extreme unfairness of this University system, the ascendency secured\r\nto Trinity College, which, admirable institution as it was, was\r\npractically nearly confined to Protestants of the upper class; the\r\nfailure, with respect to Catholic Ireland, of the Queen's Colleges and the\r\nQueen's University, and the large and useless expenditure this involved;\r\nabove all, the denial to the Catholic University of any share in the\r\nbounty of the State, though its claim to it could be hardly\r\ndoubtful,--attracted the attention of several statesmen, from 1850 to\r\n1870; but nothing was done, or even attempted. The subject was taken up by\r\nMr. Gladstone, with characteristic earnestness, during his first Ministry;\r\nhe declared that University education in Ireland was 'a scandal;' indeed,\r\nIrish education of the higher kind was the third branch of the upas tree\r\nwhich threw its baleful shade over the land. He brought in a measure of\r\nreform in the session of 1873; it was an ambitious and a comprehensive\r\nscheme; but it was much the worst of his Irish reforms of this period; and\r\nit ended in complete and disastrous failure. With the historical instinct\r\noccasionally seen in his legislation, Mr. Gladstone proposed to revive the\r\nidea of Elizabeth and the first Stuarts, and to found a great National\r\nUniversity, which was to have the management and control of the higher\r\neducation throughout Ireland. The governing body of this new institution\r\nwas to be composed partly of men chosen by the Lord-Lieutenant, and partly\r\nof the heads of the colleges to be connected with it; and it was to have\r\nthe sole power of conferring degrees in Ireland. Trinity College was to\r\nhand over to the National University a sum of L12,000 a year, that is,\r\nmore than a fourth of its endowments from the State; its professorships,\r\nits fellowships, its scholarships, in a word, all its prizes, were to be\r\nthrown open to all its students whatever their faith; but in most other\r\nrespects it was not to be essentially changed, except as to the power of\r\ngranting degrees. Trinity College was to be affiliated to the National\r\nUniversity as a dependent college, and so were a number of minor colleges;\r\nbut this remarkable distinction was made in homage to the 'liberalism' of\r\nthe day: the Queen's Colleges, that of Galway being suppressed as useless,\r\nwere to retain the endowments they received from the State, on the ground\r\nthat they were free to all comers; but the Catholic University was not to\r\nobtain a shilling, nor yet other colleges of a sectarian type, on the\r\nground that they were 'close and exclusive,' this being the case of all\r\nthe Catholic colleges that could be affiliated to the new foundation. The\r\nQueen's University was to be abolished, for the National University was to\r\nbe sole and supreme; and then came provisions, which, strange as they may\r\nappear at first sight, were perhaps inevitable under the conditions on\r\nwhich the project was formed. Moral philosophy, metaphysics, and modern\r\nhistory were shut out from the National University course; they might be\r\ntaught in the colleges, but were to be no part of University learning. And\r\nthe National University, like the Queen's Colleges, was to be\r\n'non-religious;' its system of education was to be secular and united,\r\nthat is its students were to be examined together in secular learning, but\r\nin religious matters they were to stand apart; religion, indeed, might be\r\na subject of college teaching, but it was not to be heard of within the\r\nUniversity walls; in fact, it was probably to be left to the students and\r\ntheir clergy.\r\n\r\nThis complicated measure, not easy thoroughly to understand, was\r\nsustained, for a few days, by the glamour of Mr. Gladstone's rhetoric. But\r\nere long it arrayed against it an immense preponderance of opinion in\r\nIreland, and was assailed with fatal effect in the House of Commons. The\r\nHeads of Trinity College took the initiative in declaring against it; in\r\ndebates, wise, patriotic, and just alike, they recognised the claims of\r\nCatholic Ireland; but they protested against the wrong being done to the\r\ngreat and ancient foundation they represented, and especially against the\r\ndegradation to which it was subjected by the Bill. Trinity College was to\r\nbe deprived for no reason of a large part of its revenue; it was to be\r\nplaced under a governing body, in which nominees of the Castle would be\r\nall-powerful--an influence pernicious to its independence and\r\nself-government; above all, the National University was to supplant it,\r\nand was to exclude from its teaching the noblest studies of the intellect\r\nof man. The Platonism which had inspired Berkeley, the records which had\r\nanimated the genius of Burke, and had been fostered in the Alma mater of\r\nthese great worthies, were to be banished from a foundation which was to\r\nbe made the head of University life in Ireland. These sentiments were\r\nfully shared by enlightened Irishmen: that moral and metaphysical science\r\nand modern history should be virtually proscribed in the University about\r\nto be set up, was, as it were, putting out one of the eyes of the\r\nintellect, effacing what was best in the map of knowledge. But the most\r\ndecisive condemnation of the scheme was that pronounced by the Irish\r\nCatholic bishops. Like their predecessors of nearly thirty years before,\r\nand the Anglican High Church party of that day, they asserted that the\r\nproject was really 'godless;' it was irreligion in the mask of\r\nnon-religion; its liberalism was in the highest degree illiberal, for it\r\noffered their flocks a system of education it was known they would reject;\r\nand it was flagrantly, nay, basely, unjust, for while Trinity College, and\r\nthe Queen's Colleges, and the Queen's University, were to remain endowed,\r\nthe Catholic University and all Catholic colleges were to get nothing from\r\nthe State. These arguments made their way into the House of Commons, and\r\nwere vindicated in speeches of great ability. Disraeli dwelt especially on\r\nthe poverty and the imperfection of a University scheme, in which the\r\nfinest branches of knowledge were not to enter; he frankly denounced the\r\nBill as 'atheistic,' an epithet which Burke assuredly would have fastened\r\non it. Other speakers, notably Ball, a very brilliant Irishman, enlarged\r\non the wrong done to Trinity College, and earnestly advocated the Catholic\r\nclaims; not only was the minister offering a stone for bread, he was\r\nvirtually trying to bribe the Irish Catholic into accepting institutions\r\nhe disliked, and in the attempt was deeply offending his conscience.\r\nNotwithstanding the efforts of a powerful Government, the Bill was\r\nrejected by the House of Commons; nearly all the Irish members voted\r\nagainst it, and so did the best men of the Liberal party.\r\n\r\nThe year that witnessed the collapse of Mr. Gladstone's measure,\r\nwitnessed, also, a reform of Trinity College conceived in the spirit of\r\nthe 'liberalism' of the hour, and hailed as an illustration of what is\r\ncalled progress. The government, the dignities, and the prizes of the\r\ncollege were thrown open to all without regard to their creed; this was\r\nwelcomed as 'University equality' in the most perfect sense. It is a\r\nmistake to suppose that a corresponding change was ever made at Oxford and\r\nCambridge; the extension of their privileges to persons whatever their\r\nfaith, has, thanks to the exertions of the late Lord Selborne, been\r\nstrictly confined to lay offices; the religious character and teaching of\r\nthe Universities have been carefully preserved.[189] Though Trinity\r\nCollege has been made 'non-religious' by this measure, and that to such a\r\ndegree that its governing body might conceivably be composed of avowed\r\natheists, it has, nevertheless, to this day remained a Protestant\r\ninstitution in all essential respects. Its professors, fellows, and\r\nscholars have, since 1873, been nearly all Protestants; its Catholic\r\nstudents are not eight in a hundred of the number as a whole; and the\r\nchief practical result of the late reform has been to make the heads of\r\nthe Irish Catholic Church more opposed than before to seeing Catholics\r\nenter its precincts. In 1879, Lord Beaconsfield's Ministry made an attempt\r\nto diminish the injustice done to Irish Catholics by the system of\r\nUniversity education still in force in Ireland. The Queen's University was\r\nabolished; a Royal University was established, which was enabled to confer\r\ndegrees on, and to give prizes to, the students of the Catholic University\r\nand other colleges; but the Royal University is a mere Examining Board; it\r\nis not a University properly so called. One incident connected with this\r\ninstitution deserves attention; the success of the students of Catholic\r\ncolleges at the Royal University examinations has been so great, that it\r\nought to silence jeers at the 'superstition' which keeps them back, the\r\nvulgar cant of ignorant prejudice or worse.[190] Meanwhile the iniquities\r\nand anomalies of the Irish University system have continued but very\r\nlittle changed.[191] Trinity College remains a Protestant institution\r\nwell endowed, almost a monopoly of the Protestant upper class in Ireland,\r\npractically little resorted to by Irish Catholics; the Queen's Colleges\r\nare avoided by the Irish Catholics, as being 'irreligious' if called\r\n'non-religious,' though the College of Belfast suits Presbyterian views;\r\nthey, too, receive a large bounty from the State; but the Catholic\r\nUniversity, the true seminary for the upper middle Catholic classes, and\r\nnow divided into different colleges, is still, as such, left out in the\r\ncold. Its students, no doubt, can obtain Royal University degrees, and\r\nsome of its professors have been placed as examiners on that foundation;\r\nbut it is the veriest mockery to call this justice when we look at Trinity\r\nCollege and the Queen's Colleges. 'The words of scripture are reversed,'\r\nin Macaulay's language; 'the rich are filled with good things and the\r\nhungry are sent empty away.'\r\n\r\nI do not envy those who, whatever their reasons, refuse to acknowledge the\r\nwrong done by these arrangements. It will hardly be denied, in the\r\ntwentieth century, that Protestant ascendency ought not to exist in any\r\nsphere of Irish affairs, and that in University life, as in all matters,\r\nIrish Catholics ought to have civil equality, and that without a violation\r\nof the rights of conscience. It has been triumphantly maintained that, in\r\nhigh education, these conditions are actually fulfilled in Ireland;\r\nTrinity College and the Queen's Colleges are accessible to all students,\r\nwithout regard to their religion or no religion; these have a perfectly\r\nequal right to share in the government and the honours of institutions\r\nthrown completely open. But those who argue in this way either shut their\r\neyes to facts, or will not perceive that this fine 'liberalism' in Ireland\r\nworks sheer injustice. Catholics are but a handful of students in Trinity\r\nCollege and the Queen's Colleges compared to what their natural proportion\r\nought to be; Trinity College, if nominally open, is in all essential\r\nrespects Protestant; the Queen's Colleges as being 'non-religious,' that\r\nis, in the view of their Church 'irreligious,' are practically avoided by\r\nIrish Catholics; yet the State endows Trinity College and the Queen's\r\nColleges; it starves the Catholic University and other Catholic colleges,\r\nwhich are thus unfairly handicapped by their rivals. If this is not\r\nfurthering Protestant ascendency in Irish high education, and denying\r\ncivil equality to Irish Catholics who, in this matter, will not forego the\r\nrights of conscience, I do not know what else it can be; it seems to me to\r\nbe iniquity in no doubtful sense. And are the objections of the Irish\r\nCatholics, in this province, as 'irrational' and 'superstitious' as has\r\nbeen scoffingly said? Reverse the case of Trinity College: suppose that\r\nEngland was a Catholic Power, and that she kept up a great Catholic\r\nUniversity in the Irish capital, discountenancing Protestant institutions\r\nin many ways, how many Protestants would enter its walls, how soon would\r\nthe cry of Catholic ascendency be raised? Or suppose that Oxford and\r\nCambridge were made 'non-religious,' as the Queen's Colleges in Ireland\r\nare, would not an immense majority of English parents declare that these\r\nseats of learning were 'godless,' and persistently keep their sons away\r\nfrom them? The simple truth is that the Catholic objections to Trinity\r\nCollege and the Queen's Colleges are really those which, in this matter,\r\nhave been entertained by the deepest thinkers; to my mind, at least, they\r\nseem perfectly well-founded. As to the statement that these objections are\r\nthose of the Irish Catholic bishops alone, and are mere 'superstitious\r\nfancies,' it is enough to reply that, on two occasions, the Irish\r\nCatholic laity have distinctly pronounced on this subject, and have\r\ndeclared that they agree with the heads of their Church. And as to the\r\nargument that Catholic States do not endow sectarian institutions like the\r\nCatholic University and other Irish Catholic colleges, it will be quite\r\ntime enough to examine this when anything like such a state of things can\r\nbe found as that which at present exists in Ireland.\r\n\r\nOne argument, however, seldom frankly set forth, but hinted at in a\r\nvariety of ways, has been a real obstacle to a reform of this vicious\r\nsystem; it strongly appeals to British national prejudice, of all\r\naberrations of opinion the most difficult to overcome. 'Popery,' it is\r\nsaid, is a 'detestable thing;' a 'Protestant' State 'must have nothing to\r\ndo with it;' to endow a Catholic University in Ireland, therefore, or any\r\ncolleges of the same complexion, would be 'sacrificing to Baal,' or\r\nsomething as wicked. Catholic Ireland must put up with Trinity College and\r\nthe Queen's Colleges, which have been made open to all sorts and\r\nconditions of men; its 'conscientious objections' are mere 'bigotry.' This\r\nreasoning, which condemns as impious the religion of the greatest part of\r\nChristendom, would unfortunately overthrow many arrangements by which\r\nprovision has been made in our 'Protestant' State for Catholic\r\ninstitutions of different kinds; if pushed to its consequences, it would\r\nrevive the penal code in Ireland, and lead to the confiscation of Catholic\r\ncharities. But though it has still indirectly an effect on some\r\npoliticians, it is, in its naked simplicity, only the faith of Mr. Kensit\r\nand of those who walk in his footsteps; it is worthy of the philosophy of\r\nLord George Gordon, of the meekness of Orangeism, of the bray of Exeter\r\nHall. For some time a turn in British opinion has happily taken place;\r\n'liberalism,' it has been perceived, in Irish University education has\r\nfailed; Mr. Arthur Balfour has made himself conspicuous in advocating the\r\njust claims of Catholic Ireland. Even as I write a Commission is being\r\nappointed to consider the whole subject of University life in Ireland;\r\nthere can be no reasonable doubt that it will fully bring to light the\r\nanomalies and the unfairness of the existing system, and will recommend\r\nthat the Catholic University, and other Catholic colleges perhaps, shall\r\nbe endowed. In truth, things have already come to such a pass that Trinity\r\nCollege, the one institution of which, it is said, 'all Irishmen are\r\nreally proud,' will, owing to the exceptional favour it receives from the\r\nState, be placed in grave danger, and the Queen's Colleges also, if a\r\nCatholic University in Ireland be not established and endowed, in order to\r\nsecure to the Irish Catholic civil equality, in high education, through\r\nthe assistance of the State.[192]\r\n\r\nOn what principles, then, and by what means, is University education in\r\nIreland to be so reformed as to do equal justice to all Irishmen, to place\r\nProtestants, Presbyterians, and Catholics on the same level, and,\r\nespecially, to vindicate the rightful claims of Catholic Ireland? Two\r\nleading projects have at least been sketched out: the first, the grander\r\nand the more ambitious, but, in my judgment, scarcely possible to carry\r\ninto effect; the second, more simple, more in harmony with existing facts,\r\nand, I think, safer and much more easy to realise. The first scheme,\r\nfollowing in some respects the measure of Mr. Gladstone of 1873, but\r\nmaking a marked improvement on it, would aim at establishing and endowing\r\na National University for all Irishmen, which should have a power to\r\nconfer degrees, in common with the Royal University now existing, and\r\nshould have an ample professional staff; it should have its examinations\r\nfor degrees and for other honours. The governing body of this University\r\nshould be composed of the heads of the colleges affiliated to it--the\r\nelement of the Castle being excluded, according at least to the best\r\nauthorities--and Trinity College should not be deprived of any part of its\r\nrevenues, as it was to be under the Bill of 1873. Two of the Queen's\r\nColleges probably should be suppressed; but the College of Belfast, which\r\nhas been successful, should probably be made a Presbyterian college, at\r\nleast in the main; the endowments it would receive should be, doubtless,\r\nincreased. High Catholic education should be provided for in this way: The\r\nCatholic University should be established and endowed, and placed\r\nreasonably on a level with Trinity College, and perhaps other Catholic\r\ncolleges also; but, in consideration of this assistance from the State, a\r\nlay element should be introduced into the Catholic University governing\r\nbody; this should not be composed wholly of Catholic clergymen; and the\r\nteaching body should be composed of men, chosen without regard to\r\nreligious distinctions, but so constituted that a majority should be\r\nCatholics, and that Catholic education should be predominant. Other\r\nCatholic colleges might be connected with this institution; and Trinity\r\nCollege, the Catholic University, and the Belfast and all other colleges,\r\nshould be subordinate to the National University in this sense; their\r\nstudents should be obliged to resort to it, or to the Royal University if\r\nthey preferred it, in order to pass examinations, and to obtain degrees or\r\nother honours, there being thus two Universities of different types in\r\nIreland. Education in all the affiliated colleges should be perfectly\r\nfree, that is, left to the arrangements made by their governing bodies;\r\nbut a certain standard of proficiency should exist, which, however, the\r\ntests of University examinations would probably secure.\r\n\r\nAn Irish National University, could it be founded on these lines, would\r\npresent many attractive features, would realise, indeed, a noble ideal. It\r\nwould preserve Trinity College as a great place of learning, would give\r\nPresbyterian Ireland a college practically its own, and ought to satisfy\r\nthe legitimate demands of Catholic Ireland. That its dependent colleges\r\nshould compete with each other for its degrees and honours, and be\r\nfriendly rivals in the splendid race of learning, would also be an immense\r\nadvantage; and the Royal University would, doubtless, suffice for students\r\ntoo poor to enter the dependent colleges, and yet aspiring to pass\r\nexaminations and to obtain degrees. But could a National University of\r\nthis type be set up in Ireland with a prospect that it would succeed or\r\nflourish? Its governing body would be formed of the heads of the colleges\r\nconnected with it; these would be mainly composed of Catholic and\r\nProtestant divines: could these, in the existing state of Ireland, agree\r\nas to the University course that ought to be adopted? Suppose that\r\nArchbishop Walsh and Dr. Salmon, the venerable provost of Trinity College,\r\nwere together members of this supreme board. Would the first approve of\r\nLocke's Essay on the Human Understanding as a subject of examination in\r\nthe University schools? Would the second approve of Bellarmine and even of\r\nBossuet? Dissension, I fear, would be the inevitable result; and in that\r\ncase 'the Castle' would certainly try to gain authority over the governing\r\nbody, and to place on it nominees of its own, in my judgment, an\r\nexceedingly mischievous thing. Very probably, too, the State, in the long\r\nrun, would deprive Trinity College of some of its revenues, on different\r\npleas that could be plausibly urged; to this there would be the gravest\r\nobjections. And how could moral philosophy, metaphysics, and modern\r\nhistory, nay, even physical science itself, be made parts of University\r\nstudies? How could Protestants and Catholics be examined in them in\r\ncommon? Would it not be necessary to exclude them from University\r\nteaching, as in the case of Mr. Gladstone's ill-starred measure--to close\r\nthe University to the best works of the intellect of man, to deprive it of\r\nthe most fruitful branches of learning? I fear the idea of a National\r\nUniversity, as affairs now stand in Ireland, is not likely to become a\r\nreality with results that could be deemed hopeful. No doubt the Royal\r\nUniversity does, to some extent, have examinations on these debateable\r\nsubjects; but they occupy a very small place in its teaching; and in a\r\nNational University this ought not to be the case.\r\n\r\nA National University would not be founded in Ireland under the second\r\nproject. Trinity College would remain completely intact; it would retain\r\nits present governing body, its privileges, and its power of conferring\r\ndegrees. The Queen's Colleges--that of Galway being probably suppressed,\r\nand its funds transferred to the College of Belfast--and the Royal\r\nUniversity would continue unchanged; the students of the Queen's Colleges\r\nwould probably seek degrees from the Royal University as they do at\r\npresent. But the Catholic University should be established and endowed,\r\nand placed on the same level as Trinity College, as far as this could be\r\neffected by law; the charge of the endowment would not be great--it would\r\nbe perhaps L100,000 for buildings, and perhaps L40,000 a year for other\r\npurposes; but the students, and those of other colleges to be connected\r\nwith it, would not be numerous, at least for years; it should, of course,\r\nhave the power of conferring honours and degrees. In return for these\r\nadvantages, the State should have a right to insist that its governing\r\nbody should be in part laymen--the Irish Catholic bishops have already\r\nagreed to this; and the State ought, also, to have a right to require\r\nthat the secular education it should afford should be good, a security\r\nwhich could fully, if indirectly, be obtained. The advantages of this\r\nscheme, it is obvious, are that it would get rid of the difficulties\r\ninseparable from a National University in Ireland; it would preserve\r\nTrinity College exactly as it is, an enormous gain for that great place of\r\nlearning; it would interfere as little as possible with things as they\r\nare; and it would do all that Catholic Ireland could reasonably demand. It\r\nis understood that a scheme of this description has the approval of the\r\nauthorities of Trinity College, and of their distinguished representative,\r\nMr. Lecky; their opinions are of the very greatest weight. The only real\r\nobjection made to this plan is one made by characteristic prejudice: the\r\neducation, in the Catholic University, it is said, would be bad, and its\r\ndegrees would be of no value. In the face of the success of Catholic\r\nUniversity students at the Royal University examinations, the first\r\nassertion has been proved to be false; and besides, this is the affair of\r\nthe students and their parents alone. As to the inferiority of the\r\nCatholic University degrees, there is no reason to believe that this would\r\nexist; these degrees, moreover, would have to compete with those of the\r\nRoyal University and of Trinity College; if they were really inferior,\r\nthis would soon be found out, and the Catholic University would have to\r\nincrease their value. This is the true security the State and the public\r\nwould possess.\r\n\r\nA few 'Present Irish Questions' remain, on which I may offer passing\r\nremarks. Ireland is essentially a poor country; her middle class is\r\ncomparatively very weak; her trade and manufactures are small; the greater\r\npart of the community is a Celtic race. It has long been contended by\r\nwell-informed Irishmen that many undertakings, which, in Great Britain,\r\nhave properly been left to private enterprise, ought, in Ireland, to be\r\ncarried out by the State, as for centuries has been the case in France, a\r\nCeltic land, as was largely the case in Ireland under her extinct\r\nParliament. This observation especially applies to the Irish railway\r\nsystem. As long ago as 1836, Thomas Drummond, the Under Secretary of\r\nwell-known renown, strongly recommended that Irish railways should be laid\r\nout, managed, and controlled by the Government; but this was inconsistent\r\nwith English ideas; the Irish railways were abandoned to private\r\ncompanies. The results have been very far from fortunate; many of the\r\nlines have been badly designed; the Irish railway fares are a great deal\r\ntoo high; too numerous boards of directors are a heavy charge; railway\r\ncommunication, in a word, in Ireland is of an inferior kind, and much too\r\ncostly in a backward and poor country. Not indeed that the State has not\r\nmade large advances to Irish railway companies, some of these on terms\r\nvery unjust to ratepayers; but the system is faulty and ill-developed; a\r\nreform in this direction is greatly wanted.[193] As Drummond insisted, the\r\nState, even now, ought to buy up and direct the Irish railways; but this\r\nis only a part of what it ought to do in this province. The material\r\ncondition of Ireland is not prosperous; her main river basins require\r\ndrainage; her whole arterial drainage is in a bad state, and has suffered\r\nmuch from the legislation of 1881, and from the policy of so-called 'land\r\npurchase,' for ordinary Irish tenants will not keep it up, and their\r\nlandlords cannot now be expected to do so; these works must be undertaken\r\nby the State, or assuredly they will not be undertaken at all. Mr. Arthur\r\nBalfour has done something in this direction by the encouragement of light\r\nrailways in remote parts of Ireland, and by the foundation of the\r\n'Congested Districts Board,' an institution that has had excellent\r\nresults. But this is only the fringe of the subject; an enormous amount of\r\nwork remains to be done; and this, in the circumstances of Ireland, can\r\nonly be done by the Government.\r\n\r\nIn a book which has attracted some attention--'Ireland, 1798-1898'--I\r\nwrote these words nearly four years ago: 'An Irishman, Wolseley, an\r\nIrishman, Roberts, are the foremost of living British soldiers; but there\r\nare no Irish Guards, and few Irishmen in our artillery; we see here a want\r\nof tact and of sympathy.' Time, in this respect, has suddenly brought its\r\nchanges; has again illustrated the genius of the Irishman in war, and, in\r\nsome measure, has removed a reproach from England. It is true that the\r\nconspiracy, which still exists in Ireland, did all that it could to\r\nprevent Irishmen from taking part in the contest in South Africa, and that\r\neven a petty Irish contingent appeared in the ranks of the Boers. But Lord\r\nWolseley had at least a great share in fitting out the largest expedition\r\nwhich has ever left our shores to fight an enemy at a distance of six\r\nthousand miles--no other power could do anything of the kind; and without\r\ndisparaging our other generals, the presence of a superior mind was at\r\nonce seen when Lord Roberts was given the supreme command in our army. And\r\nthe Irish soldiery who fought in the campaigns of 1899-1900 were true to\r\nthe noble traditions of their race; they were in the forefront of many a\r\nbloody conflict; and now that a regiment of Irish Guards has been at last\r\nembodied--a tardy acknowledgment of Irish military worth--England may rest\r\nassured that these men will rival the famous Irish Brigade of another age,\r\n'ever and everywhere true' to the Bourbon lilies, and conspicuous in the\r\nservice of France on many a field of renown. I may add a word on another\r\nsubject, in which Ireland perhaps has a just claim on England. The\r\ndescendants of the chiefs, who, in Scotland, clung to the cause of the\r\nStuarts, have, for the most part, regained their forfeited lands and\r\nhonours; no such reparation has been made to the descendants of Irish\r\nnobles and princes, who supported the Stuarts in the nobler cause of\r\ntheir country. The representative of the last of the Celtic kings of\r\nIreland--a man of large possessions and of unquestionable parts--has no\r\nplace on the roll of the peerage; the sons of ennobled Cromwellian\r\ntroopers and tradesmen have precedence at Court over the sons of the most\r\nillustrious Milesian Houses. This is not a mere trifle as may carelessly\r\nbe said; it tends to revive memories that it were better to forget. Can\r\nnothing be done to make a graceful concession, which would touch many an\r\nIrish heart, and would go some way to promote a spirit of loyalty and hope\r\nin Ireland, which it should be a great object of statesmanship to create\r\nand foster?\r\n\r\nIf the picture I have drawn of Ireland is correct in outline, there is\r\nmuch of evil omen in her present condition. The ancient divisions of race\r\nand faith, the most distinctive feature in her social structure, are at\r\nleast as deeply marked as they have been for a century; bad legislation\r\nhas made them deeper and wider. Catholic Ireland remains disaffected to\r\nBritish rule, despite efforts of conciliation and concessions that cannot\r\nbe justified; no class in the community is completely satisfied;\r\ndiscontent rankles in the hearts of the landed gentry. The Union, indeed,\r\nhas been successfully maintained; the frightful agrarian disorder of\r\n1881-89 no longer exists. But the Union is not permanently assured as long\r\nas the Liberal party and eighty Irish members demand Home Rule, and the\r\nover-representation of Ireland continues; the conspiracy of the Land and\r\nthe National Leagues has revived in that of the United Irish League; and\r\nthis seeks to compass the ends of its prototypes by obstruction in\r\nParliament and detestable socialistic tyranny. And the frame of Irish\r\nsociety has been well-nigh shattered; ruins have been made, nothing solid\r\nhas been put in their place. An aristocracy, long waning, has been\r\npractically destroyed, and can no longer be a support of the State; the\r\nbureaucracy of the Castle reigns in its stead; but this is essentially a\r\nweak Government; it can maintain order, but has no hold on the people; the\r\nIrish democracy, to which power has been transferred, regards it with a\r\ndislike and a contempt it does not try to conceal. The country has made\r\nhardly any progress of late years; if some improvement in the state of the\r\nmiddle classes appears, agriculture, its leading industry, has perceptibly\r\ndeclined. In by far the most important of Irish social relations, those\r\nconnected with the land, a revolution has taken place; a huge if a veiled\r\nconfiscation has gone on; the landed gentry have been shamefully wronged;\r\nthe occupiers of the soil have been most unduly favoured; yet both classes\r\ndeclare they have been ill-treated, notably the last. And the Irish land\r\nsystem has been turned upside down, with consequences disastrous and\r\nfar-reaching; the landlord has been cut off from his estate; the tenant\r\nhas been encouraged in thriftlessness and waste by law; the land has been\r\nbound in a ruinous mortmain, like that which existed under the penal code,\r\nand subjected to demoralising litigation, breeding a war of class; capital\r\nand fruitful enterprise turn away from it. And, at the same time, in order\r\nto lessen these evils, recourse has been had to remedies that are perhaps\r\nworse; the system of so-called 'land purchase' has been devised; the\r\nresult has been to create a class of peasant owners reproducing the nearly\r\nextinct middleman, and, above all, to arouse a cry for the 'compulsory\r\npurchase' of the rented lands of Ireland, an act of wholesale spoliation\r\nunjust and disastrous alike. In the position of affairs we now see in\r\nIreland, the stability of society has been rudely shaken; the sense of the\r\nsecurity of property has well-nigh disappeared; the sanctity of contracts\r\nhas no respect; the pillars on which order and prosperity rest have been\r\ninjured; violent revolution has been arrested, indeed, but revolutionary\r\nand socialistic ideas spread far and wide. And will any impartial inquirer\r\ndeny that these untoward results may be largely ascribed to the faulty\r\nlegislation of late years, and to a system of administration shifty and\r\nfeeble? And what judgment is to be passed on the thoughtless optimism too\r\ncommon in opinion with respect to Ireland? Meanwhile, reforms imperatively\r\nrequired are not even attempted; they are passed over or postponed to some\r\nmore convenient season. The time surely has come to look things in Ireland\r\nstraight in the face; to see if statesmanship cannot do something really\r\neffective for her good. This end assuredly will not be attained by\r\nbreaking up the Three Kingdoms under the guise of Home Rule, or by\r\npromoting a confiscation the worst Ireland has ever seen; still less will\r\nit be attained by the quackery in legislation and administration too\r\napparent of late years; nor can trifling and foolish optimism blind the\r\neyes of intelligent thinkers to facts. Ireland can only expect to make\r\nprogress by ruling the community on the just and sound principles to which\r\nlong experience has given its sanction; and this consummation can only be\r\nthe slow result of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH GOVERNMENT BILL, 1886.\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT OF CLAUSES.\r\n\r\nPart I.\r\n\r\n  _Legislative Authority._\r\n\r\n  CLAUSE\r\n\r\n  1.

and if the result of the voting of the\r\ntwo orders does not agree the question shall be resolved in the negative.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First order.]\r\n\r\n=10.=--(1) The first order of the Irish Legislative Body shall consist of\r\none hundred and three members, of whom seventy-five shall be elective\r\nmembers and twenty-eight peerage members.\r\n\r\n(2) Each elective member shall at the date of his election and during his\r\nperiod of membership be _bona fide_ possessed of property which--\r\n\r\n    (_a_) If realty, or partly realty and partly personalty, yields two\r\n    hundred pounds a year or upwards, free of all charges;

make\r\nregulations for the following purposes:--\r\n\r\n    (_a_) The making of a register of electors of councillors in time for\r\n    the election of the first councillors, and with that object for the\r\n    variation of the days relating to registration in the existing\r\n    election laws, and for prescribing the duties of officers, and for\r\n    making such adaptations of those laws as appear necessary or proper\r\n    for duly making a register;\r\n\r\n    (_b_) The summoning of the two Houses of the Legislature of Ireland,\r\n    the issue of writs and any other things appearing to be necessary or\r\n    proper for the election of members of the two Houses;\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The election of a chairman (whether called Speaker, President,\r\n    or by any other name) of each House, the quorum of each House, the\r\n    communications between the two Houses, and such adaptation to the\r\n    proceedings of the two Houses of the procedure of Parliament, as\r\n    appears expedient for facilitating the conduct of business by those\r\n    Houses on their first meeting;\r\n\r\n    (_d_) The adaptation to the two Houses and the members thereof of any\r\n    laws and customs relating to the House of Commons or the members\r\n    thereof;\r\n\r\n    (_e_) The deliberation and voting together of the two Houses in cases\r\n    provided by this Act.\r\n\r\n(21) The regulations maybe altered by Irish Act, and also in so far as\r\nthey concern the procedure of either House alone, by Standing Orders of\r\nthat House, but shall, until altered, have effect as if enacted in this\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE I\r\n\r\nFROM THE 'MEMOIRS OF THE LATE LORD SELBORNE'\r\n\r\n(Part ii. pp. 261-263).\r\n\r\n\r\n... Each new step Gladstone takes is, as it seems to me, more and more on\r\nthe side of _moral_ as well as political evil. Much as I disapproved of\r\nhis surrender of last year to Parnell, I disapprove very much more of his\r\npresent endeavour to prevent the restoration in the present stage of the\r\nHome Rule question, of the reign of law in Ireland, and of the _means_ he\r\nis attempting to use for _that_ purpose. Deliberate and organised\r\nobstruction in the House of Commons, and an attempt to overrule a majority\r\nagainst him there, of more than one hundred, by violent appeals to popular\r\npassions outside,--those appeals being supported by representing the cause\r\nof anarchy and conspiring against law as the cause of liberty,--by denying\r\nthe existence of any case for strengthening the law, in the face of a\r\ncomplete and manifest paralysis of law by the power of a seditious\r\norganisation, into whose scale he has now thrown his whole influence,--and\r\nby denouncing, in the most violent terms, the principle of measures for\r\nthe protection of the loyal, and for securing the due administration of\r\njustice, which are the same (in their general character, for it is not\r\nnecessary here to go into questions of detail) with those by means of\r\nwhich he himself governed Ireland for the last years of his power, and far\r\nmore consistent with all real ideas of liberty than the suspension of the\r\nHabeas Corpus Act, which he introduced in 1881. It was quite open to him\r\n(of course) to contend that, by the acceptance of his Home Rule scheme,\r\nthe necessity for any such measures might be prevented, and that he\r\nprefers and insists upon that alternative,--so much as _that_ was involved\r\nin his measures of last year; but it is quite a different thing to\r\ndenounce the principle of maintaining law and government, and defending\r\nthose who respect and obey law from the tyranny of conspirators against\r\nit, and making the ordinary criminal law of the country a reality and not\r\na mere idle name,--'as coercion,' in the sense of an undue invasion of\r\nliberty. To do this, and to appeal _ad populum_ against it from an\r\noverwhelming majority in Parliament is _Acheronta movere_, with a\r\nvengeance.... For a man who, with his attainments, his experience, his\r\nprofessions, his fifty years' public service, his political education\r\nunder some of the greatest and best men of the time, has three times\r\nfilled the highest office in the State, and is now on the verge of the\r\ngrave, so to end his career, seems to me more shocking and disheartening\r\nthan anything else recorded in our history. It is only the old respect,\r\nand old attachment, which makes one search about for the possible\r\nexplanations, in the workings of a very complex and intricate mind. If (as\r\nI trust) the Government and the House of Commons stand firm, all his\r\nefforts in the cause of anarchy will be in vain. The clause as to removing\r\ntrials to England may have to be given up; but the _permanence_ of the\r\nBill (its best feature of all) must remain, if any good is to be done.\r\n\r\n... I will spare you a long yarn about politics this time. The G.O.M.\r\nseems to be determined to pull the whole Irish house down, parliamentary\r\ngovernment and all, unless he can have his own way. But I have no fear\r\nthat he _will_ have his way, just at present, whatever harm he may do in\r\nthe endeavour. But the struggle is very disagreeable, as well as sharp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE II\r\n\r\nREPORT OF SPECIAL COMMISSION (Vol. iv. pp. 544, 545).\r\n\r\n_Conclusions of the Report of the Judges._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now pursued our inquiry over a sufficiently extended period to\r\nenable us to report upon the several charges and allegations which have\r\nbeen made against the respondents, and we have indicated in the course of\r\nthis statement our findings upon these charges and allegations, but it\r\nwill be convenient to repeat _seriatim_ the conclusions we have arrived\r\nat upon the issues which have been raised for our consideration.\r\n\r\nI. We find that the respondent members of Parliament collectively were not\r\nmembers of a conspiracy having for its object to establish the absolute\r\nindependence of Ireland, but we find that some of them, together with Mr.\r\nDavitt, established and joined in the Land League organisation with the\r\nintention by its means to bring about the absolute independence of Ireland\r\nas a separate nation. The names of these respondents are set out on a\r\nprevious page.\r\n\r\nII. We find that the respondents did enter into a conspiracy by a system\r\nof coercion and intimidation to promote an agrarian agitation against the\r\npayment of agricultural rents, for the purpose of impoverishing and\r\nexpelling from the country the Irish landlords who were styled the\r\n'English Garrison.'\r\n\r\nIII. We find that the charge that 'when on certain occasions they thought\r\nit politic to denounce, and did denounce, certain crimes in public they\r\nafterwards led their supporters to believe such denunciations were not\r\nsincere' is not established. We entirely acquit Mr. Parnell and the other\r\nrespondents of the charge of insincerity in their denunciation of the\r\nPhoenix Park murders, and find that the 'facsimile' letters on which\r\nthis charge was chiefly based as against Mr. Parnell is a forgery.\r\n\r\nIV. We find that the respondents did disseminate the _Irish World_ and\r\nother newspapers tending to incite to sedition and the commission of other\r\ncrime.\r\n\r\nV. We find that the respondents did not directly incite persons to the\r\ncommission of crime other than intimidation, but that they did incite to\r\nintimidation, and that the consequence of that incitement was that crime\r\nand outrage were committed by the persons incited. We find that it has not\r\nbeen proved that the respondents made payments for the purpose of inciting\r\npersons to commit crime.\r\n\r\nVI. We find as to the allegation that the respondents did nothing to\r\nprevent crime and expressed no _bona fide_ disapproval, that some of the\r\nrespondents, and in particular Mr. Davitt, did express _bona fide_\r\ndisapproval of crime and outrage, but that the respondents did not\r\ndenounce the system of intimidation which led to crime and outrage, but\r\npersisted in it with knowledge of its effect.\r\n\r\nVII. We find that the respondents did defend persons charged with agrarian\r\ncrime, and supported their families, but that it has not been proved that\r\nthey subscribed to testimonials for, or were intimately associated with,\r\nnotorious criminals, or that they made payments to procure the escape of\r\ncriminals from justice.\r\n\r\nVIII. We find, as to the allegation that the respondents made payments to\r\ncompensate persons who had been injured in the commission of crime, that\r\nthey did make such payments.\r\n\r\nIX. As to the allegation that the respondents invited the assistance and\r\nco-operation of and accepted subscriptions of money from known advocates\r\nof crime and the use of dynamite, we find that the respondents did invite\r\nthe assistance and co-operation of and accepted subscriptions of money\r\nfrom Patrick Ford, a known advocate of crime and the use of dynamite, but\r\nthat it has not been proved that the respondents, or any of them, knew\r\nthat the Clan-na-Gael controlled the League or was collecting money for\r\nthe Parliamentary Fund. It has been proved that the respondents invited\r\nand obtained the assistance and co-operation of the Physical Force Party\r\nin America, including the Clan-na-Gael, and in order to obtain that\r\nassistance, abstained from repudiating or condemning the action of that\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Administration of the affairs of Ireland: its nature and defects, 28, 29.\r\n\r\n  Agrarian crime in Ireland, 12, 29, 128, 135, 146. _See_ Whiteboyism\r\n\r\n  Agriculture, state of, in Ireland, 3, 7, 204, 205, 206, 234\r\n\r\n\r\n  B\r\n\r\n  Balfour, Mr. Arthur: his successful policy when Chief Secretary for\r\n        Ireland, 58;\r\n    he establishes light railways in Ireland, and the Congested Districts\r\n        Board, 35, 36\r\n\r\n  Belfast, improvement in, within the last sixty years, 2\r\n\r\n  Bewley, Mr. Justice, the head of the Second Land Commission: his theory\r\n        of occupation right in the Irish land, 219, 220\r\n\r\n  Bureaucracy, the, of the Castle, 28, 29\r\n\r\n  Butt, Isaac: the true author of the conception of Home Rule, 41;\r\n    his work on Irish Federalism, 42\r\n\r\n\r\n  C\r\n\r\n  Chicago, the Convention at, in 1886: speeches of two of Parnell's\r\n        envoys, 57\r\n\r\n  Code, the Irish Penal: its effects on the Irish land, 99, 100. _See_ the\r\n        Question of the Irish Land, Chap.

These, too, are the latest returns.\r\n\r\n[14] 'Report of the Childers Commission,' p. 72. I cite also the following\r\nfrom the Report, p. 43: 'The income-tax figures are, perhaps, the best and\r\nmost complete test of the comparative growth of the wealth of the two\r\ncountries. Taking the two years, 1854 and 1892, we find that the net\r\nassessment for Great Britain was, in 1854, L245,389,931; and in 1892,\r\nL570,971,740. The net assessment for Ireland was, in 1854, L21,334,448;\r\nand in 1892, L26,851,585. In these thirty-eight years the net assessment\r\nfor Great Britain is more than two and a third times as great as it was in\r\n1854, whilst that for Ireland has only increased by one quarter. Put in\r\npercentage form, the figures are still more striking: In 1854 Great\r\nBritain was assessed at 92 per cent. of the whole; Ireland 8 per cent. In\r\n1892 Great Britain was assessed at 95.50 per cent, of the whole; Ireland\r\n4.50 per cent. In other words, Ireland's assessment was to that of Great\r\nBritain as 1 to 11 in 1854, and as 1 to 21 in 1892.'\r\n\r\n[15] See on this subject the true and indignant remarks of Mr. Lecky,\r\n'Democracy and Liberty,' vol. i. pp. 27, 28.\r\n\r\n[16] The tone of disaffected opinion in Ireland can only be thoroughly\r\nunderstood by a careful study of the conduct and the language of\r\n'Nationalist' leaders. I select a few specimens out of hundreds of\r\ninstances. Mr. William O'Brien, the Corypheus of the United Irish League,\r\nspake thus at Letterkenny in January, 1900: 'If ten thousand Frenchmen, or\r\nRussians, or Germans were to land in Bantry Bay, with a supply of arms for\r\nthe people, they would walk over the country and drive the English\r\ngarrison into the sea.' The same worthy exclaimed at a monster meeting in\r\nDublin in September, 'English rule in Ireland was so bad that they would\r\nbe justified in chasing the English out of Ireland bag and baggage. What\r\nwas wanting to them, unfortunately, were the guns and artillery to do it.'\r\nMr. Michael Davitt, of Land League renown, speaking in the Queen's County\r\nabout the same time, said, 'England is unquestionably the greatest empire\r\nof liars (loud cheers and laughter), of hypocrites, and of poltroons,\r\njudged by its achievements in South Africa, that has ever postured before\r\nmankind with a civilising mission.' Because the Corporation of Dublin\r\nvoted, by a small majority, an address to Queen Victoria when she paid her\r\nlast visit to Ireland, Mr. John Redmond, the chairman of the 'Irish\r\nParliamentary Party,' said, in January, 1901, 'It rests with the people\r\nthemselves to say whether they will redeem the reputation of Dublin from\r\nthe stain that has been cast on it.' So Mr. John Dillon, M.P., spoke in\r\nthe same sense, a few months ago, 'The voice of the capital will be the\r\nvoice of the rest of Ireland (applause), that we will not tolerate in this\r\nold city that new type of politics which thinks it consistent with Irish\r\nnationality to cringe and crouch before a foreign queen.' At least two\r\nCounty Councils in Ireland, and more than one Local Board, refused to vote\r\nan expression of condolence when the Queen died. It is painful to contrast\r\nthese sentiments with the loyalty of O'Connell when the Queen ascended the\r\nthrone.\r\n\r\n[17] Since the above lines were written, there has been a serious outbreak\r\nof agrarian crime in Ireland in the form of incendiary fires, which may be\r\ndistinctly traced to the operations of the United Irish League.\r\n\r\n[18] Speech in the House of Commons, February 19, 1844.\r\n\r\n[19] The figures were 1,238,342 against 1,316,327: Dicey, 'England's Case\r\nagainst Home Rule,' p. 35.\r\n\r\n[20] Butt maintained, in his place in Parliament (Hansard, March 20,\r\n1874), that this was the true import of his project.\r\n\r\n[21] Speech on receiving the freedom of Aberdeen, September 26, 1871.\r\n\r\n[22] See Mr. Gladstone's 'History of an Idea,' an apology for his attitude\r\ntowards Home Rule at this time, which seems to me to be his condemnation.\r\n\r\n[23] For an admirable analysis of the Bill, see Dicey's 'England's Case\r\nagainst Home Rule,' pp. 223-273. The text of the Bill will be found in the\r\nAppendix to this volume.\r\n\r\n[24] For a full statement of Mr. Gladstone's 'conditions,' see his speech\r\nin the House of Commons, April 8, 1886.\r\n\r\n[25] 'Reflections on the Revolution in France,' vol. i. p. 384, ed. 1834.\r\n\r\n[26] Report of the Special Commission, vol. iv. p. 542.\r\n\r\n[27] 'The Queen's Enemies in America,' p. 24.\r\n\r\n[28] For a scathing condemnation of Mr. Gladstone's public conduct in\r\nthese years, see several great speeches of Lord Hartington and Mr.\r\nGoschen. See also 'The Memoirs of Lord Selborne,' Part II. vol. ii. pp.\r\n261, _et seq._, and note in Appendix to this volume. See, too, Dicey's\r\n'Leap in the Dark,' p. 190. Lord Selborne's sketch of Mr. Gladstone's\r\ncharacter as a statesman, 'Memoirs,' Part II. vol. ii. pp. 339-359,\r\ndeserves careful study. Mr. Lecky's admirable account, 'Democracy and\r\nLiberty,' introduction to vol. i., second edition, is well known.\r\n\r\n[29] Report of the Judges, vol. iv. pp. 544, 545. See the note at the end\r\nof this volume in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n[30] For a very able analysis of and commentary on the Bill of 1893, see\r\nProfessor Dicey's 'Leap in the Dark.' For the text of the Bill, see the\r\nAppendix to this volume.\r\n\r\n[31] Dicey's 'Leap in the Dark,' p. 57.\r\n\r\n[32] 'England's Case against Home Rule,' p. 168.\r\n\r\n[33] The German Empire, in which Prussia is the leading State, may seem an\r\nexample to the contrary; but the German Empire is hardly a Federation\r\nproperly so called; it is a great military monarchy ruling subject\r\nkingdoms.\r\n\r\n[34] I feel obliged to refer to these authorities; not in order to stir up\r\nresentment against England in Ireland, but to point out a most important,\r\nif unfortunate, fact in the relations between the two countries. Swift, in\r\nhis 'View of the State of Ireland,' Works, vol. ii. 8vo ed. 1890, says,\r\n'We are in the condition of patients, who have physic sent them by doctors\r\nat a distance, strangers to their constitution and the nature of the\r\ndisease.' Burke, 'Correspondence,' vol. iii. p. 438, has remarked, 'I have\r\nnever known any of the successive Governments of my time influenced by any\r\nother feeling relative to Ireland than the wish that they should hear of\r\nit and of its concerns as little as possible.' So Grattan, cited by Mr.\r\nLecky, vol. vii. p. 108, exclaimed, 'It is a matter of melancholy\r\nreflection to consider how little the Cabinet knows of anything relating\r\nto Ireland. Ireland is a subject it considers with a lazy contumely, and\r\npicks up here and there, by accident or design, interested and erroneous\r\nintelligence.' I quote this passage from one of the speeches of Lord\r\nClare: 'The people of England know less of this country than of any other\r\nnation in Europe;' and this passage from one of the speeches of O'Connell:\r\n'We are governed by foreigners; foreigners make our laws.... As to\r\nIreland, the Imperial Parliament has the additional disadvantage springing\r\nfrom want of interest and total ignorance. I do not exaggerate; the\r\nministers are in total ignorance of this country.' This want of knowledge\r\nof Ireland, too often associated with indifference, has, I repeat, been\r\ndistinctly made manifest of late years.\r\n\r\n[35] These figures are taken from the Irish census of 1891. By the census\r\nof 1901, the population of Antrim and Down has increased, and that of\r\nevery other county in Ireland, except Dublin, has declined. The\r\nover-representation of Ireland has thus become more than ever an unjust\r\nanomaly.\r\n\r\n[36] For an admirable account of the ancient land system of Celtic\r\nIreland, see Maine's 'Early History of Institutions.' I may be allowed to\r\nrefer to an article on this work, from my pen, in the _Edinburgh Review_\r\nof July, 1875, and to the first chapter of my 'History of Ireland,' in the\r\nCambridge 'Historical Series.'\r\n\r\n[37] In the case of this, as of all the chapters, a list of the principal\r\nauthorities and sources of information will be found in the preface to\r\nthis book. For the conquest and confiscations of the Irish land, from the\r\nNorman Conquest to the end of the reign of William III., see 'The Statute\r\nof Kilkenny,' edited by James Hardiman; 'The Discoverie of Sir John\r\nDavies;' 'The Carew Papers,' edited by J. S. Brewer and William Bullen;\r\nSpenser's 'View of the State of Ireland;' Holingshead's 'Chronicles of\r\nIreland;' Carte's 'Life of Ormond;' Lord Clanricarde's 'Memoirs;' Sir\r\nWilliam Petty's 'Political Anatomy of Ireland;' 'Macariae Excidium;' and\r\nKing's 'State of the Protestants of Ireland.' As regards modern\r\nauthorities, numerous, and some very valuable, the reader may be referred\r\nto Froude's 'History of England,' vol. ii. ch. viii.; vol. v. ch. xxviii.;\r\nvol. viii. chs. vii., xi.; vol. x. ch. xxiv.; vol. xi. ch. xxvii.; to Mr.\r\nLecky's 'History of England in the Eighteenth Century,' vol. ii. ch. vi.;\r\nand to the Irish chapters in Mr. Gardiner's 'History of England,' from the\r\nAccession of James I. to the outbreak of the Civil War; to his 'History of\r\nthe Great Civil War,' vol. i. chs. vi., xi.; vol. ii. chs. xxvii.,\r\nxxxvii., xliv.; and to the Irish chapters of his 'History of the\r\nCommonwealth and Protectorate.' Other modern works on the subject are\r\nSigerson's 'History of Land Tenure in Ireland;' 'An Historical Account of\r\nthe Plantation of Ulster,' by the Rev. George Hill; 'The Cromwellian\r\nSettlement of Ireland,' by John P. Prendergast; and the 'Life of Sir\r\nWilliam Petty,' by Lord Edmund Fitzmaurice. See a review by me of this\r\nlast work in the _Edinburgh Review_ of July, 1895; and also chs. iii.,\r\niv., and v. of my 'History of Ireland, 1494-1868,' referred to before.\r\nThere are innumerable minor authorities; and Hallam's 'Chapter on\r\nIreland,' vol. iii., may be studied.\r\n\r\n[38] 'Letter to Sir Hercules Langriche:' 'Works,' vol. i. p. 560, ed.\r\n1834.\r\n\r\n[39] For an account of the penal laws of Ireland, see Vincent Scully on\r\n'The Irish Penal Laws;' Howard's 'Popery Laws;' and Burke's 'Tracts on the\r\nPopery Laws,' a short but masterly work.\r\n\r\n[40] For the state of Ireland and of the Irish land at this period, see\r\nthe Irish Statute Book from 1700 to about 1750, and especially the\r\nwritings of Swift and Berkeley on Irish affairs. Swift, however, is not\r\njust to the Irish landed gentry, many as were their faults. See also the\r\n'Letters' of Archbishop Boulter, the virtual ruler of Ireland during a\r\nseries of years, and of Archbishop Synge. Reference, too, may be made to\r\nMolyneux's 'Case of Ireland,' and to Hutchinson's and Caldwell's\r\n'Restraints on the Trade of Ireland.' For modern authorities, consult\r\nLecky's 'History of England in the Eighteenth Century,' vol. ii. ch. vii.;\r\nvol. iv. chs. xvi., xvii. Froude's 'English in Ireland' is very inaccurate\r\nand one-sided for this period; but his fine romance, the 'Two Chiefs of\r\nDunboy,' contains a brilliant, and, in the main, a true account of the\r\nstate of Irish social life in those days.\r\n\r\n[41] By far the best account of the state of Ireland, at this period, is\r\nto be found in the celebrated 'Tour' of Arthur Young, who wrote in\r\n1776-78. See also Mr. Lecky's 'History of England in the Eighteenth\r\nCentury,' vol. vi. chs. xxiv., xxv.; vol. vii. ch. xxvii. The 'Irlande,\r\nSociale, Politique, et Religieuse' of Gustave de Beaumont may also be\r\nconsulted; but though a very able work, it is that of a democratic\r\ndoctrinaire. For the Whiteboy movements, see the Irish Statute Book, and\r\nSir George Lewis on 'Irish Disturbances.'\r\n\r\n[42] See Burke's 'Tracts on the Popery Laws,' vol. ii. pp. 445, 446.\r\nArthur Young, too, often dwells on this subject.\r\n\r\n[43] For an account of this period nothing can be compared to Mr. Lecky's\r\n'History of England in the Eighteenth Century,' vols. vii., viii. These\r\ncontain all the information that can be obtained, collected from every\r\navailable source. I may refer to my 'Ireland, 1798-1898,' chs. i., ii.\r\n\r\n[44] There is no complete history of Ireland from the Union to the present\r\ntime, though the materials for such a work are abundant. I may refer to my\r\n'Ireland, 1798-1898,' from the second chapter to the end. An excellent and\r\nelaborate description of Ireland from 1800 to 1812 will be found in the\r\nvolumes of Edward Wakefield.\r\n\r\n[45] The best account of this period--the forerunner of one even more\r\ncalamitous--will be found in the proceedings of a Parliamentary Committee\r\non the state of Ireland in 1824-25, and in the mass of evidence collected\r\nby it. The evidence of O'Connell is full of interest.\r\n\r\n[46] I perfectly recollect, though quite a boy, this strong and widespread\r\nexpression of sentiment.\r\n\r\n[47] Mitchel's 'History of Ireland,' vol. ii. p. 213. Mitchel was a rebel,\r\nbut an honourable man, superior to the falsehoods disseminated by later\r\nagitators against Irish landlords.\r\n\r\n[48] Every one acquainted with the history of Irish titles, from about\r\n1790 to 1820, knows that this was the case.\r\n\r\n[49] 'Clarendon,' wrote Greville, 'told me he expected the Encumbered\r\nEstates Act would prove the regeneration of Ireland.'\r\n\r\n[50] That great lawyer, Lord St. Leonards, protested. He had been Lord\r\nChancellor of Ireland.\r\n\r\n[51] For the state of Ireland during the Famine and the years that\r\nfollowed, see 'The Irish Crisis,' by Sir Charles Trevelyan, reprinted from\r\nthe _Edinburgh Review_; and the 'Letters' of Mr. Campbell Foster, the\r\nCommissioner of the _Times_. Valuable information will also be found in\r\nthe Greville 'Memoirs,' vols. v., vi. I may refer to my 'Ireland,\r\n1798-1898,' chs. v. and part of vi.\r\n\r\n[52] For an account of these machinations of party, see Greville,\r\n'Memoirs,' vol. vii. p. 33.\r\n\r\n[53] I heard several of these most injudicious and ill-informed\r\nexpressions of a false opinion.\r\n\r\n[54] For the state of Ireland from the end of the Famine to 1868,\r\nreference may be made to 'Two Centuries of Irish History,' edited by Mr.\r\nBryce; to the Greville 'Memoirs,' vols. vii. and viii.; to Greville's\r\n'Policy of England towards Ireland;' to the 'Recollections and Suggestions\r\nof Earl Russell;' to parts of the 'Life of Lord Palmerston;' to 'Journals,\r\nConversations, and Essays relating to Ireland,' by Nassau Senior; to the\r\n'Young Ireland,' the 'Four Years of Irish History,' and 'The League of the\r\nNorth and South,' by Sir C. G. Duffy; to the 'New Ireland' of Mr. A. M.\r\nSullivan; and to the 'Parnell Movement' of Mr. T. P. O'Connor. Valuable\r\ninformation as to this period will also be found in Mr. Barry O'Brien's\r\nworks, 'Fifty Years of Concessions to Ireland' and 'Irish Wrongs and\r\nEnglish Remedies;' and there are many other authorities. This period is\r\ndealt with in my 'Ireland, 1798-1898.' ch. vi.\r\n\r\n[55] From the mass of literature on this subject reference may especially\r\nbe made to 'The Irish Land,' by the late Sir George Campbell; Judge\r\nLongfield's essay in 'Systems of Land Tenure;' the 'Irish Land and the\r\nIrish People,' by Butt; and the 'Ireland, Industrial, Political, and\r\nSocial,' of the late Mr. J. N. Murphy. As Special Commissioner of the\r\n_Times_, I went into the Irish land question at length on the spot; and it\r\nwould be affectation to deny that my letters, since republished,\r\npowerfully contributed to the legislation which ere long followed. See,\r\nfor further information, 'The Irish Land Question' of John Stuart Mill;\r\n'Emigration and the Tenure of Irish Land,' by Lord Dufferin; 'The New\r\nIreland' of the late Mr. A. M. Sullivan; parts of Mr. Barry O'Brien's\r\n'Fifty Years of Concessions to Ireland'; 'Ireland in 1868,' by the late\r\nMr. G. Fitzgibbon, a Master of the Court of Chancery in Ireland; and Mr.\r\nLecky's 'Democracy and Liberty,' vol. i. ch. ii.\r\n\r\n[56] This fact has been established by conclusive and impartial evidence,\r\nwhich hardly admits of question. It should be steadily kept in the\r\nreader's mind; for an idea, largely countenanced by iniquitous legislation\r\nbadly administered, has prevailed of late years, that rack-renting in\r\nIreland was common, nay, general. Exactly the contrary has been the case\r\nduring the last half century. Butt, in his 'The Irish People and the Irish\r\nLand,' published in 1867, hardly alludes to over-renting; he properly\r\ndwells on the insecurity of Irish land tenure. Master Fitzgibbon, a great\r\nauthority on the subject, in his 'Ireland in 1868,' p. 268, pointedly\r\nremarked, '452 estates are under my jurisdiction, in the Court of\r\nChancery, the rents of which amount to L330,809, paid by 18,287 tenants. I\r\nhave been now nearly eight years in office, during which time the rents\r\nhave been paid without murmuring or complaint worth noticing.... It is\r\nwell known that my ears are open to any just complaint from any tenant.'\r\nThe testimony of Judge Longfield, another great authority, is nearly to\r\nthe same effect. In 'Systems of Land Tenure,' published in 1870, he wrote\r\nthus (p. 21): 'This complaint of high rents has been made without ceasing\r\nfor more than three hundred years. There was never less ground for it than\r\nat the present day, although in some instances the rent demanded is still\r\ntoo high; but this chiefly occurs where the landlords are middlemen, or\r\nwhere the property is very small.' These views are fully confirmed by\r\nevidence of a later period, to which I shall refer. I may add that, in\r\n1869, I examined the rentals of many scores of Irish estates, and was\r\nconvinced that over-renting was very rare. See my 'Letters on the Land\r\nQuestion of Ireland,' republished from the _Times_, _passim_. I quote a\r\nsingle instance, from many to the same purpose (p. 221): 'It may be\r\nasserted, too, without fear of contradiction, that if in some districts\r\nrents are too high, they are not so as a general rule.' I have managed an\r\nIrish estate for upwards of fifty years, and have some claim to be an\r\nagricultural expert.\r\n\r\n[57] For the characteristics of the Ulster tenant right, see Butt's\r\n'Landlord and Tenant Act, 1870,' ch. xv. pp. 296-310. As to the legal\r\nauthorities on the subject, reference may be made to the learned treatise\r\nof Messrs. Cherry and Wakley, 'The Irish Land Law and Land Purchase Acts,'\r\npp. 150-152. A popular account of the Ulster custom will be found in my\r\n'Letters on the Land Question of Ireland,' pp. 242-247, and a more\r\ntechnical account in a legal treatise from my pen on the Land Act of 1870,\r\npp. 30-56. The best definition I have seen of the right is one made by the\r\nlate P. J. Blake, Q.C., C.C.J. of a northern county, 'Cherry and Wakley,'\r\np. 150: 'The right or custom in general of yearly tenants, or those\r\nderiving through them, to continue in undisturbed possession so long as\r\nthey act properly as tenants and pay their rents. The correlative right of\r\nthe landlord periodically to raise the rent, so as to give him a just,\r\nfair, and full participation in the increased value of the land, but not\r\nso as to extinguish the tenant's interest by paying a rack rent. The usage\r\nor custom of the yearly tenants to sell their interest, if they do not\r\nwish to continue in possession, or if they become unable to pay the rent.\r\nThe correlative right of the landlord to be consulted, and to exercise a\r\npotential voice in the approval or disapproval of the proposed assignee.'\r\n\r\n[58] I quote a few passages from the speeches of Mr. Gladstone, and\r\nothers, on this subject. Mr. Gladstone said, March 11, 1870, 'If you value\r\nrents you may as well, for every available purpose, adopt perpetuity of\r\ntenure at once. It is perpetuity of tenure only in a certain disguise....\r\nThe man who becomes a mere annuitant loses all general interest in the\r\nprosperity of the land.' And again, February 15, 1870: 'Perpetuity of\r\ntenure on the part of the occupier is virtually expropriation of the\r\nlandlord.... The mere readjustment of rent can by no means dispose of all\r\ncontingencies the future may produce in his favour.' Sir Roundell Palmer,\r\nafterwards Lord Selborne, said, March 10, 1870, 'Fixity of tenure, in\r\nplain English, means taking away the property of one man and giving it to\r\nanother.' So Lord Granville, June 14, 1870, said in the House of Lords,\r\n'They might have introduced a Bill--which they were determined not to\r\ndo--adopting fixity of tenure, taking away his property from the landlord,\r\nand establishing a valuation rent.' Passages of this kind, at least as\r\nstrong, might be multiplied a hundred-fold.\r\n\r\n[59] It is impossible, in a sketch like this, to describe in detail the\r\nagrarian legislation for Ireland, which Parliament has enacted from 1870\r\nto this time. The work of Butt referred to before is an admirable\r\ncommentary on the Bill of 1870, which soon became law. A brief account of\r\nall this legislation will be found in Mr. Lecky's 'Democracy and Liberty,'\r\nvol. i. ch. ii. The legal treatises of Messrs. Cherry and Wakley, pp.\r\n149-448, and of Mr. Justice Barton, are elaborate and complete.\r\n\r\n[60] Judge Longfield and Mr. Lecky are much the most distinguished of\r\nthese numerous censors.\r\n\r\n[61] By this time I was an Irish County Court Judge; and I had some\r\nexperience of reprehensible acts of this kind, extremely few as they were.\r\n\r\n[62] It is very remarkable that the stringent provisions of the Act\r\nagainst exorbitant rents seem to have been almost unknown to the\r\npeasantry, though exorbitant rents were, no doubt, existing here and\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[63] Report of the Judges of the Special Commission, vol. iv. pp. 478-480.\r\n\r\n[64] By many degrees the best account of the Land League movement will be\r\nfound in the 'Report of the Proceedings of the Special Commission of\r\n1888-89,' republished by the _Times_ in four volumes. Reference may also\r\nbe made to 'Parnellism and Crime,' a series of essays in the _Times_; to\r\nthe 'Truth about the Land League,' by Mr. Arnold Foster; to 'The\r\nContinuity of the Irish Revolutionary Movement,' by Professor Brougham\r\nLeech; and to a pamphlet called 'The Queen's Enemies in America.' A kind\r\nof apology for the conspiracy will be found in 'The Parnell Movement,' by\r\nMr. T. P. O'Connor, M.P.; but the Irish 'Nationalists' have judiciously\r\nbeen reticent on the subject. I may refer to my 'Ireland, 1798-1898,' ch.\r\nviii.\r\n\r\n[65] These infamous speeches, worthy of Marat and Hebert, were continued\r\nfor years, and fill a large part of the evidence in the proceedings of the\r\nSpecial Commission. I select a sample or two taken at random. Mr. M.\r\nHarris said, 'If the tenant farmers of Ireland shoot down landlords as\r\npartridges are shot in September, Mat Harris would never say a word\r\nagainst them' (vol. ii. p. 38). The same worthy, afterwards an M.P.,\r\nexclaimed on another occasion (vol. i. p. 26), 'Mrs. Blake of Keenoyle is\r\nno better than a she-devil.... Mr. Robinson called the people of Connemara\r\nvermin; the people of Connemara ought to treat him as vermin. Leonard of\r\nTuam I will say nothing about. I will denounce him at his own door.' So,\r\ntoo, a Mr. Boyton said (vol. iv. p. 277), 'We have seen plenty of them,\r\nlandlords and agents, that deserve to be shot at any man's hand. I have\r\nalways denounced the commission of outrages by night, but meet him in the\r\nbroad daylight, and if you must blow his brains out, blow them out in the\r\ndaytime.' Multiply such speeches addressed to an excitable peasantry, and\r\nthe results which followed can easily be understood.\r\n\r\n[66] This has been established by conclusive evidence, and should be\r\ncarefully borne in mind. Mr. Egan, one of the treasurers of the League,\r\nsaid, 'On my own behalf, and on behalf of my friends of the League, both\r\nin prison and outside, I can say that we regard the land question only in\r\nthe light of a step towards national independence, which is, and shall\r\ncontinue to be, the goal of all our efforts.' Mr. Healy, M.P., said, 'This\r\nis a movement to win back from England the land of Ireland, which was\r\nrobbed from the people by the confiscating armies of Elizabeth and\r\nCromwell.... But I would remind you that Mr. Parnell ... explained the\r\nbasis of the movement when he told the Galway farmers that he would never\r\nhave taken off his coat in this movement were it not with Irish\r\nnationality as its object.' Parnell occasionally let out the truth; he\r\nsaid, 'Let every farmer, while he keeps a firm grip of his holding,\r\nrecognise also the great truth that he is serving his country and the\r\npeople at large, and helping to break down English misrule in Ireland'\r\n(Report of the Proceedings of the Special Commission, vol. iv. pp. 203,\r\n204). These speeches were, in hundreds, imitated and followed by other\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\n[67] Report of the Judges, vol. iv. p. 486.\r\n\r\n[68] I was at this time judge of the County Kerry; these demands increased\r\nmore than twofold at a single Quarter Sessions.\r\n\r\n[69] Report of the Judges, vol. iv. pp. 522-525.\r\n\r\n[70] Report of the Judges, vol. iv. p. 522.\r\n\r\n[71] Some of the cynical and wicked utterances of Parnell in proclaiming\r\nand expounding the new policy of 'boycotting' must be quoted. These, it is\r\nneedless to say, were exaggerated in scores of speeches by orators of the\r\nLeague. In view almost of the corpse of a land agent who had been foully\r\nmurdered, the arch-conspirator coolly remarked (Proceedings of the Special\r\nCommission, vol. iv. p. 257): 'I had wished in referring to a sad\r\noccurrence which took place lately, the shooting or attempted shooting of\r\na land agent in the neighbourhood (uproar)--I had wished to point out that\r\nrecourse to such measures of procedure is entirely unnecessary and\r\nabsolutely prejudicial where there is a suitable organisation amongst the\r\ntenants themselves.' The methods to be adopted in 'boycotting'--the word\r\nwas so named from a Captain Boycott, who was one of the first\r\nsufferers--were those set forth by Parnell (Report of the Judges, vol. iv.\r\np. 498): 'Now, what are you to do to a tenant who bids for a farm from\r\nwhich his neighbour has been evicted? (Various shouts, among which, \"Kill\r\nhim!\" \"Shoot him!\") Now, I think I heard somebody say \"Shoot him\" (\"Shoot\r\nhim!\"); but I wish to point out to you a very much better way, a more\r\nChristian and charitable way, which will give the lost sinner an\r\nopportunity of repenting. (Hear, hear.) When a man takes a farm from which\r\nanother has been evicted, you must show[A] him on the roadside when you\r\nmeet him, you must show him in the streets of the town, you must show him\r\nat the shop counter, you must show him in the fair and in the\r\nmarket-place, and even in the house of worship, by leaving him severely\r\nalone, by putting him into a moral Coventry, by isolating him from the\r\nrest of his kind as if he was a leper of old. You must show him your\r\ndetestation of the crime he has committed, and you may depend upon it, if\r\nthe population of a county in Ireland carry out this doctrine, that there\r\nwill be no man so full of avarice, so lost to shame, as to dare the public\r\nopinion of all right-thinking men within the county, and to transgress\r\nyour unwritten code of laws.'\r\n\r\n    [A] In other, possibly more correct, reports, the word is 'shun,' not\r\n    'show.'\r\n\r\n[72] Report of the Judges, vol. iv. p. 522.\r\n\r\n[73] It is very important to bear this in mind, regard being had to the\r\ncircumstances of the time, which have been shamefully misrepresented, and\r\nto subsequent legislation and its administration. I quote a few words from\r\nthe Report, p. 3: 'It was unusual in Ireland to exact what in England\r\nwould have been considered as a full or fair commercial rent. Such a rent\r\nover many of the larger estates, the owners of which were resident, and\r\ntook an interest in the welfare of their tenants, it has never been the\r\ncustom to demand. The example has been largely followed, and is, to the\r\npresent day, rather the rule than the exception in Ireland.' M. de\r\nMolinari, a very competent foreign observer, wrote to the same effect in\r\n1881: 'Le taux general des rentes est modere; autant que j'ai pu en juger,\r\nil est a qualite egale de terrain de moitie plus bas que celui des terres\r\ndes Flandres' ('L'Irlande, le Canada, Jersey,' p. 138). See for further\r\nauthorities, Mr. Lecky's 'Democracy and Liberty,' vol. i. p. 179.\r\n\r\n[74] Mr. Gladstone, speeches in the House of Commons, July 22, 1881, and\r\nMay 10, 1881. Lord Carlingford, and notably Lord Selborne, said nearly the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n[75] This I know to be the fact on the very best authority.\r\n\r\n[76] A good popular account of the law of 1881 will be found in Mr.\r\nLecky's 'Democracy and Liberty,' vol. i. pp. 182-197. See for an elaborate\r\nand technical description, 'Cherry and Wakley,' pp. 217-343.\r\n\r\n[77] 'Systems of Land Tenure,' p. 59.\r\n\r\n[78] Report of the Judges, vol. iv. p. 522.\r\n\r\n[79] Report of the Judges, vol. iv. p. 532: 'We consider that the National\r\nLeague, like the Ladies' Land League, was substantially the old Land\r\nLeague under another name.'\r\n\r\n[80] I quote a few words from hundreds of these detestable writings, which\r\nshould be studied. Mr. William O'Brien, the editor of one of Parnell's\r\nnewspapers, and now the leader of the 'United Irish League,' published\r\nthis in _United Ireland_, April 18, 1885: 'It would be still more\r\ngratifying if the Irish millions, scattered over the globe, should wake up\r\none of these mornings to hear the war chimes joyfully ringing the\r\ndeclaration that would drive England on to downfall and destruction.' And\r\nagain, September 19, 1885: 'We cannot fight England in the open. We can\r\nkeep her in hot water. We cannot evict our rulers neck and crop. We can\r\nmake their rule more insupportable for them than for us.... It is no fault\r\nof ours if we cannot organise Waterloos to decide our quarrels.' As to\r\npersonalities, I quote two passages. December 15, 1883: 'Monstrous and\r\nincredible, surely, six hundred Irish gentlemen could not eat their dinner\r\nwithout pouring out libations to the adoration of an old lady who is only\r\nknown in Ireland by her scarcely decently disguised hatred of this\r\ncountry, and by the inordinate amount of her salary.' Again, June 13,\r\n1885: 'With all the stubborn force of a cruel, narrow, dogged nature, Lord\r\nSpencer struck murderous blow after blow at the people under his rod. He\r\nstopped at nothing; not at subsidising red-handed murderers, not at\r\nknighting jury-packers, not at sheltering black official villainy with a\r\ncoat of darkness, not at police quarterings, blood taxes, the bludgeoning\r\nof peaceful meetings, the clapping of handcuffs and convict jackets on\r\nM.P.'s, mayors, and editors, not at wholesale battues of hangings and\r\ntransportations by hook or crook.'\r\n\r\n[81] Report of the Judges, vol. iv. p. 522. Mr. Gladstone in the House of\r\nCommons, April 8, 1886.\r\n\r\n[82] For an elaborate account of the Act of 1887, see 'Cherry and Wakley,'\r\npp. 367-420. Reference, too, may be made to Mr. Lecky's 'Democracy and\r\nLiberty,' vol. i. pp. 198-200.\r\n\r\n[83] For an account of this legislation, which has not received the\r\nattention it deserves, as it is limited in its scope, see 'Cherry and\r\nWakley,' pp. 468-472, and 'Barton,' pp. 104-106.\r\n\r\n[84] Upwards of thirty years ago, when the question of compensating Irish\r\ntenants for their improvements was coming fully to the front, a wealthy\r\nmiddleman, who held a large demesne in perpetuity, at a rather high rent,\r\nand had built a valuable mansion on it, in addition to planting hundreds\r\nof acres of woodland, asked me 'if I thought Parliament would compensate\r\nhim, for, in that case, he could make his landlord pay him L30,000.' My\r\nreply was that 'Parliament would not be so insane.' I should be sorry to\r\nmake such a reply now, having regard to recent legislation.\r\n\r\n[85] I believe I may claim some credit for having contributed to this\r\nprovision. I had had large experience of the injustice of keeping tenants\r\nsubject to long-standing arrears; and, as a judge, had taken strong\r\nmeasures to prevent and defeat the practice.\r\n\r\n[86] For an elaborate account of the Act which was the result of this\r\nBill, see the work of Mr. Justice Barton, 'The Land Law (Ireland) Act,\r\n1896.'\r\n\r\n[87] 'Letter to a Member of the National Assembly,' vol. i. p. 478.\r\n\r\n[88] A Committee of the House of Lords sate, in 1872, to consider the\r\nadministration of the Land Act of 1870. The report and the evidence were,\r\nin the main, in favour of the judges.\r\n\r\n[89] Rushe _v._ Whitney, Roscommon Quarter Sessions, October, 1895.\r\n\r\n[90] Lord Salisbury in the House of Lords, August 1, 1881: 'They are all\r\nthree strong Liberals, with strong views of tenant right.... There is no\r\ndoubt that all three are appointed with a strong prepossession in favour\r\nof views which are advocated by the representatives of the tenantry in\r\nIreland, and which are deprecated by the landlords.... It is not the\r\nrelegation of landlord and tenant to an impartial tribunal.'\r\n\r\n[91] Mr. Gladstone, July 22, 1881: 'I shall be bitterly disappointed with\r\nthe operation of the Act if the property of the landlords of Ireland does\r\nnot come to be worth more than twenty years' purchase on the judicial\r\nrent.' Mr. W. E. Forster, same date: 'I think the final result of the\r\nmeasure will be, within a few years, that the landowners of Ireland, small\r\nand large, will be better off than they are at this moment.' Lord\r\nCarlingford, August 1, 1881: 'My Lords, I maintain that the provisions of\r\nthis Bill will cause the landlords no money loss whatever. I believe that\r\nit will inflict upon them no loss of income, except in those cases in\r\nwhich a certain number of landlords may have imposed upon their tenants\r\nexcessive and inequitable rents.'\r\n\r\n[92] Hansard, vol. 260, p. 1399.\r\n\r\n[93] The nature and character of these two classes of evidence has been\r\nthus well described in the Report of the Edward Fry's Commission, p. 18:\r\n'If the matter were perfectly open, it appears to us that two independent\r\nlines of evidence might be pursued by a person inquiring what is the fair\r\nrent to be fixed for a holding. One class of evidence may for shortness be\r\ncalled the popular evidence; the other the technical. The popular evidence\r\nwould comprise the prices obtained by the tenant for a sale of his\r\ninterest or _bona fide_ offers which he had received for it, evidence of\r\nthe letting value or judicial rents of similar holdings, evidence of the\r\nsums paid for conacre or agistment, evidence of the long and punctual\r\npayment of a real rent, or of the long arrears of a nominal rent, and\r\nevidence of the prosperity or poverty of the persons who had successively\r\nlived off the produce of the holding. The technical evidence would be that\r\nmore familiar to professional valuators. They would inspect the land,\r\nascertain the acreages of the different classes of land on the farm, and\r\nwhat they would produce or carry; they would consider the quantity and\r\nvalue of the produce and the cost of production, and the shares of the\r\nsurplus remaining after the cost of production divisible between landlord\r\nand tenant respectively. The popular evidence would be affected by all the\r\nmotives which make men in Ireland desirous to occupy land; the technical\r\nevidence would assume the desire of making a money profit out of the\r\noccupation of land as the sole motive of such occupation. The eighth\r\nsection of the Act of 1881 seems to admit of both lines of evidence with a\r\nsingle exception. It provided that in fixing the fair rent consideration\r\nshould be given not to some but to all the circumstances of the case, the\r\nholding and the district, with the single exception that (sub-sec. 10) the\r\nprice paid for the tenancy otherwise than to the landlord or his\r\npredecessors was not of itself, apart from other considerations, to be\r\ntaken into account; though, conjoined with other considerations, it still\r\nremains admissible.'\r\n\r\n[94] Report of the Fry Commission, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[95] Ibid., p. 14: 'Some specific charges of misconduct or negligence have\r\nbeen made against lay Assistant Commissioners and Court valuers; as _e.g._\r\nvisiting the land without due notice to the landlord; visiting the holding\r\nwhen lying under snow or water, or when suffering from prolonged drought,\r\nand refusing to wait whilst a trench was dug to show the condition of the\r\nalleged drainage. We have investigated many of these cases, and the\r\nexplanations given have generally been satisfactory to us.'\r\n\r\n[96] Evidence taken by Mr. Morley's Commission on the Irish Land Acts, p.\r\n236.\r\n\r\n[97] Ibid., p. 397.\r\n\r\n[98] Evidence taken by the Fry Commission, p. 131.\r\n\r\n[99] Ibid., p. 208.\r\n\r\n[100] Evidence taken by the Fry Commission: Mr. Campbell, p. 41.\r\n\r\n[101] Ibid., p. 682.\r\n\r\n[102] 'Democracy and Liberty,' vol. i. pp. 205, 206.\r\n\r\n[103] Evidence taken by the Fry Commission, p. 692.

I quote this passage, for I think\r\nits substance was referred to by the late Mr. Rathbone, member for\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\n[148] Mr. Lecky, 'Democracy and Liberty,' vol. ii. pp. 487-489, rather\r\nfavours the policy of creating and extending peasant ownership in Ireland,\r\nand, to a certain extent, approves of the so-called 'Land Purchase' Acts,\r\nbut only as a doubtful experiment, to endeavour to escape from a\r\nhopelessly bad land system. The distinguished historian and thinker, in my\r\nopinion, is not sufficiently alive to the iniquity of these measures as\r\nthey affect landlords who wish to retain their estates, or, rather, what\r\nremains of them; but he clearly perceives some of the objections to this\r\nvicious legislation. I quote his remarks at some length: 'In Ireland, as\r\nis well known, great efforts are made to create such a proprietary; but\r\nthe conditions of Ireland are unlike those of any other part of the\r\ncivilised globe. It has been the deliberate policy of the Government to\r\nbreak down, by almost annual Acts, the obligation of contracts, and the\r\nexisting ownership of land has been rendered so insecure, the political\r\npower attached to it has been so effectually destroyed, and the influences\r\ntending to anarchy and confiscation have been made so powerful, that most\r\ngood judges have come to the conclusion that it is necessary to force into\r\nexistence by strong legislative measures a new social type, which may,\r\nperhaps, possess some elements of stability and conservatism. In order to\r\neffect this object, the national credit has been made use of in such a way\r\nthat a tenant is enabled to purchase his farm without making the smallest\r\nsacrifice for that object, the whole sum being advanced by the Government,\r\nand advanced on such terms that the tenant is only obliged to pay for a\r\nlimited number of years a sum from 20 to 30 per cent. less than his\r\npresent rent. In other words, a man whose rent has been fixed by the Land\r\nCourt at L100 a year, can purchase his farm by paying, instead of that\r\nsum, L70 or L80 a year for forty-nine years. The arrangement sounds more\r\nlike burlesque than serious legislation; but the belief that political\r\npressure can obtain still better terms for the tenant, and that further\r\nconfiscatory legislation may still more depreciate the value of land to\r\nthe owner who has inherited it, or purchased it in the open market, has\r\ntaken such deep root in Ireland that the tenants have shown little\r\nalacrity to avail themselves of their new privilege. What may be the\r\nultimate issue of the attempt to govern a country in complete defiance of\r\nall received economical principles remains to be seen. The future must\r\nshow whether a large peasant proprietary can be not only called into\r\nexistence, but permanently maintained, under these conditions, and whether\r\nit will prove the loyal and conservative element that English politicians\r\nbelieve. According to all past experience, peasant proprietors rarely\r\nsucceed, except when they possess something more than an average measure\r\nof industrial qualities, and the Irish purchase laws give no preference to\r\nthe energetic, the industrious, and the thrifty. On the contrary, it is\r\nvery often the farmer who is on the verge of bankruptcy who is most eager\r\nto buy, in order to reduce his annual charge. The tendency of the new\r\nproprietors to mortgage, to sublet, and to subdivide, is already manifest,\r\nand some of the best judges of Irish affairs, who look beyond the present\r\ngeneration, are very despondent about the future. They believe that a\r\npeasant proprietary, called into existence suddenly and artificially, with\r\nno discrimination in favour of the better class, in a country where\r\nindustrial qualities are very low, and where the strongest wish of the\r\nfarmer is either to divide his farm among his children, or to burden it\r\nwith equal mortgages for their benefit, must eventually lead to economic\r\nruin, to fatal subdivision, to crushing charges on land. The new policy\r\nmust also, they contend, almost wholly withdraw from the country life,\r\nwhere it is peculiarly needed, the civilising and guiding influence of a\r\nresident gentry. Whether or not these apprehensions are exaggerated time\r\nonly can show. Two predictions may, I think, with some confidence be made.\r\nThe one is, that the transformation is likely to be most successful if it\r\nis gradually effected. The other is, that a great part of the influence\r\nonce possessed by the landlord will, under the new conditions, pass to the\r\nmoney-lender.'\r\n\r\n[149] I quote these remarks of Burke, a striking instance of his political\r\nwisdom ('Tracts on the Popery Laws,' vol. ii. p. 446): 'It is on this\r\nprinciple (to get rid of short and unprofitable tenures) that the Romans\r\nestablished their _emphyteusis_, or fee-farm. For though they extended the\r\nordinary term of their creation to nine years only, yet they encouraged a\r\nmore permanent letting to farm, with the condition of improvement, as well\r\nas of annual payment where the land had lain rough and neglected.' So John\r\nStuart Mill ('Irish Land Question,' p. 31, ed. 1870): 'The idea of\r\nproperty does not, however, necessarily imply that there should be no\r\nrent, any more than that there should be no taxes. It merely implies that\r\nthe rent should be a fixed charge, not liable to be raised against the\r\nfarmer by his own improvements, or by the will of a landlord. A tenant at\r\na quit rent is, to all intents and purposes, a proprietor; a copyholder is\r\nnot less so than a freeholder. What is wanted is permanent possession on\r\nfixed terms.' Mr. Morley said not long ago, in his place in Parliament,\r\nthat, as things now stand in Ireland, the landlord must become a\r\nrent-charger and the tenant a copyholder, a true utterance.\r\n\r\n[150] 'Principles of Political Economy,' book ii. chap. ii. p. 6. I may\r\nrefer, too, to these pregnant remarks of Bentham ('Theory of Legislation,'\r\nchap, xv.): 'The principle of security requires that reform should be\r\nattended with complete indemnity.... I cannot yet quit the subject, for\r\nthe establishment of the principle of security demands that error should\r\nbe pursued in all its retreats.... The interest of individuals, it is\r\nsaid, ought to yield to the public interest; but what does that mean? Is\r\nnot one individual as much a part of the public as another? The public\r\ninterest which you introduce as a person is only an abstract term; it\r\nrepresents nothing but the mass of individual interests.... Individual\r\ninterests are the only real interests. Take care of the individuals; never\r\nmolest them, never suffer any one to molest them, and you will have done\r\nenough for the public.... I shall conclude by a general observation of\r\ngreat importance. The more the principle of property is respected, the\r\nstronger hold it takes on the popular mind. Slight attacks on this\r\nprinciple prepare the way for heavier ones. A long time has been necessary\r\nto carry property to the point where we now see it in civilised societies;\r\nbut a fatal experience has shown with what facility it may be shaken, and\r\nhow easily the savage instinct of plunder gets the better of the laws.'\r\n\r\n[151] For the constitutional position of the British and Irish Parliaments\r\nbefore the Union, see Hallam's 'Constitutional History,' vol. iii.,\r\nchapter on Ireland, and Ball's 'Legislative Irish System,' chaps. v., xv.\r\nSee also Lecky's 'History of England in the Eighteenth Century,' vol. ii.\r\nchap. vii.; vol. iv. chaps. xvi., xvii. As to the financial position of\r\nthe two countries, see the opening pages of each of the Reports of the\r\nChilders Commission.\r\n\r\n[152] Grattan described this vicious state of things in his inimitable\r\nstyle ('Speeches,' p. 258, ed. published by Duffy): 'The Union is not an\r\nidentification of the two nations; it is merely a merger of the parliament\r\nof one nation in that of another.... There is no identification in\r\nanything save in legislature, in which there is complete and absolute\r\nabsorption. It follows that the two nations are not identified, though the\r\nIrish legislature be absorbed, and by that act of absorption the feeling\r\nof one of the nations is not identified, but alienated. The petitions on\r\nour table bespeak that alienation.'\r\n\r\n[153] Report of the Childers Commission, p. 20.\r\n\r\n[154] I transcribe this part of the seventh article of the Treaty of\r\nUnion; I believe that I have fairly described its purport (Report of\r\nChilders Commission, p. 140): 'That if at any future day the separate debt\r\nof each country respectively shall have been liquidated, or if the values\r\nof their respective debts ... shall be to each other in the same\r\nproportion with the respective contributions of each country\r\nrespectively.... And if it shall appear to the Parliament of the United\r\nKingdom that the respective circumstances of the two countries will\r\nthenceforth admit of their contributing indiscriminately by equal taxes\r\nimposed on the same articles in each, to the future expenditure of the\r\nUnited Kingdom to declare that all future expense thenceforth to be\r\nincurred, together with the interest and charges of all joint debts\r\ncontracted previous to such declaration, shall be so defrayed\r\nindiscriminately by equal taxes imposed on the same articles in each\r\ncountry, and thenceforth from time to time, as circumstances may require,\r\nto impose and apply such taxes accordingly, subject only to such\r\nparticular exemptions or abatements in Ireland, and in that part of Great\r\nBritain called Scotland, as circumstances may appear, from time to time,\r\nto demand.'\r\n\r\n[155] Grattan's speeches, quoted in a memorandum supplied to the Childers\r\nCommission by Sir Edward Hamilton, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[156] 'Minutes of Evidence,' Childers Commission, vol. i. p. 329.\r\n\r\n[157] Memorandum of Sir Edward Hamilton, p. 9.\r\n\r\n[158] Report of the Childers Commission, p. 143.\r\n\r\n[159] Ibid., p. 32.\r\n\r\n[160] Report of the Childers Commission, pp. 147, 148.\r\n\r\n[161] Ibid., p. 33.\r\n\r\n[162] Report of the Childers Commission, p. 158.\r\n\r\n[163] I think it necessary to set out verbatim the terms of reference to\r\nthe Commission; I have for the sake of clearness changed their order: 'To\r\ninquire into the financial relations between Great Britain and Ireland,\r\nand their relative taxable capacity, and to report: I. Upon what\r\nprinciples of comparison, and by the application of what specific\r\nstandards, the relative capacity of Great Britain and Ireland to bear\r\ntaxation may be most equitably determined. II. What, so far as can be\r\nascertained, is the true proportion, under the principles and specific\r\nstandards so determined, between the taxable capacity of Great Britain and\r\nIreland. III. The history of the financial relations between Great Britain\r\nand Ireland, at and after the Legislative Union, the charge for Irish\r\npurposes on the Imperial Exchequer during that period, and the amount of\r\nIrish taxation remaining available for contribution to Imperial\r\nexpenditure; also the Imperial expenditure to which it is considered\r\nequitable that Ireland should contribute.'\r\n\r\n[164] Report of the Childers Commission, p. 26.\r\n\r\n[165] Since 1896, when the Childers Commission made its report, the\r\novertaxation of Ireland has increased.\r\n\r\n[166] Report of Childers Commission: 'Minutes of Evidence,' vol. i. p. 17.\r\n\r\n[167] Report of the Childers Commission, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[168] Report of the Childers Commission, p. 89.\r\n\r\n[169] Report of the Childers Commission, pp. 159, 160.\r\n\r\n[170] 'Minutes of Evidence,' Childers Commission, vol. ii. p. 218.\r\n\r\n[171] I quote from the Report of the Childers Commission, p. 68, these\r\nvaluable remarks on the subject: 'Neither can there then be any question\r\nthat a system of equal rates of taxes on the same subjects is compatible\r\nwith the utmost inequality of burdens between two countries contributing\r\nto one exchequer. All that need be done in order to exact an undue\r\nproportion--unlimited in extent--of the means of either of the countries\r\nis to tax the commodities most consumed in that country, and in fixing the\r\nrate of the tax on each commodity, to fix the higher rates on the\r\nparticular commodities most generally in use in that country, and the\r\nlower rates on those most consumed in the other. The same kind of effect,\r\nof course, may be produced, and the same discrimination exercised, by\r\ntotally exempting some commodities and taxing others, however lightly. In\r\nfact, a system of equal rates of taxes may thus be rendered more easily\r\nunjust and burdensome to the country discriminated against than one of\r\ndifferential taxes, because in the latter case, the unequal treatment, and\r\nthe mode of it being manifest, are more liable to criticism and\r\nlimitation; whilst in the former, the true effect of the system is\r\ndisguised by the circumstances that each particular head of tax is at the\r\nsame rate in both countries.'\r\n\r\n[172] Report of the Childers Commission, p. 39.\r\n\r\n[173] Ibid., p. 166.\r\n\r\n[174] Report of the Childers Commission, p. 11.\r\n\r\n[175] Ibid.: Evidence of Mr. Munough O'Brien, pp. 12, 13: 'The system of\r\nImperial loans for temporary emergencies and charity tends to increase the\r\npoverty of Ireland, whose future income is mortgaged to pay interest on\r\nexpenditure from which there is no return. There is no surer road to ruin\r\nfor an individual than borrowing money to live upon, and most of these\r\nImperial loans are practically made from time to time to enable the Irish\r\npeople to live or relieve acute distress and disorder. Loans are almost\r\nannually made to keep the people quiet or to keep them alive. Yet this\r\nexpenditure does not prevent the recurrence of famine, distress, and\r\ndiscontent; it rather tends to cause their recurrence.'\r\n\r\n[176] Report of the Childers Commission: Report of Mr. Sexton and others,\r\npp. 102, 103.\r\n\r\n[177] Report of the Childers Commission: 'Evidence,' vol. ii. p. 18.\r\n\r\n[178] Report of the Childers Commission, pp. 194, 195.\r\n\r\n[179] 6 & 7 Will.

Vanston and Foote on\r\nthe grand juries of Ireland may be referred to.\r\n\r\n[180] The reader may be referred to Mr. Moore's work on the Irish poor\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n[181] See the Report of a Committee of the House of Lords, and especially\r\nof the Evidence, taken in 1884-85, with respect to the administration of\r\nthe Irish poor law at the time.\r\n\r\n[182] For a further account of local government in Ireland, a reader may\r\nconsult the Report of Mr. W. P. O'Brien on Local Government, 1878, and\r\nreports on the towns of Ireland and their taxation about the same date. An\r\nexcellent tract on the subject was published by Mr. William J. Bailey in\r\n1888, called 'Local and Centralised Government in Ireland.' With respect\r\nto the system of municipal government in Ireland as it existed before\r\n1840, nothing is so valuable as the Reports of the Commissioners, very\r\nable men, charged to inquire into the subject in 1834-35. A useful and\r\nwell-informed account will also be found in Mr. Barry O'Brien's 'Fifty\r\nYears of Concessions to Ireland,' vol. i. book v.\r\n\r\n[183] I have only been able to sketch the outlines of the measure, the\r\nLocal Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, p. 1, 62 Vict. cap. 37. A good\r\ncommentary on it has been written by Mr. Brett of the Irish Bar.\r\n\r\n[184] Mr. Lecky, 'Democracy and Liberty,' Cabinet Edition, Introduction,\r\np. 13, has well described this vaunted reform: 'It was a measure\r\nintroduced in fulfilment of distinct pledges, and it contains very skilful\r\nprovisions intended to protect existing interests. But, after all is said,\r\nit means a great transfer of power and influence from the loyal to the\r\ndisloyal, and it goes in the direction of democracy far beyond anything\r\nthat a few years ago would have been accepted by the Conservatives, or by\r\nthe moderate Liberals.'\r\n\r\n[185] For a description of elementary education in Ireland up to 1812, see\r\npassages in Wakefield's 'Account of Ireland;' and for a description in\r\nearlier and later times, see Mr. Barry O'Brien's 'Fifty Years of\r\nConcessions to Ireland,' book i. chs. i.-xiv.; Mr. Graham Balfour's\r\n'Educational Systems of Great Britain and Ireland,' pp. 80-128; the Report\r\nof the Commissioners of Irish Education, 1810-21; the important Report of\r\nthe Powis Commission, 1870-71; and the Reports of the Commissioners of\r\nNational Education in Ireland. Mr. Froude, in his 'English in Ireland,'\r\nvol. i. p. 514; vol. ii. p. 491, has characteristically eulogised the\r\nCharter Schools; but he stands alone; Mr. Lecky, 'History of England in\r\nthe Eighteenth Century,' vol. ii. pp. 200-304, has commented on this\r\nodious system as it deserved.\r\n\r\n[186] Barry O'Brien, 'Fifty Years of Concessions to Ireland,' vol. ii. p.\r\n322.\r\n\r\n[187] See Wakefield's 'Account of Ireland' for the state of her secondary\r\nschools in 1812; Barry O'Brien's 'Fifty Years of Concessions to Ireland,'\r\nbook x. chs. i., ii., iii.; Graham Balfour's 'The Educational System of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland,' pp. 203-218; and the Reports of the two\r\nCommissions of 1854-57 and of 1878-80, of which the heads were Lord\r\nKildare and the Earl of Rosse.\r\n\r\n[188] See the resolutions in Duffy's 'Young Ireland,' pp. 713, 714. There\r\nhas been much misrepresentation on this subject.\r\n\r\n[189] See 'The Problem of Irish Education,' by Butt, a masterly and\r\nimpartial tract.\r\n\r\n[190] See for the figures 'The Irish University Question,' by Archbishop\r\nWalsh, _passim_.\r\n\r\n[191] For further information on the history and the present state of the\r\nUniversity system in Ireland, see 'The History of the University of\r\nDublin,' by the Rev. J. W. Stubbs, and 'The Constitutional History of the\r\nUniversity of Dublin,' by D. C. Heron; Howley on 'Universities;' 'What is\r\nmeant by Freedom of Education,' by the O'Conor Don; 'University\r\nEducation,' by an Irish Protestant Celt; and especially 'The Problem of\r\nIrish Education,' by Butt. See also the Irish University Debates in\r\nHansard for 1873, and the very able debate in Trinity College. The reader,\r\ntoo, may be referred to Mr. Barry O'Brien's 'Fifty Years of Concessions to\r\nIreland,' book xi.; to Mr. Graham Balfour's 'Educational Systems of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland,' pp. 273-288; to Mr. Godkin's 'Education in Ireland;'\r\nand to Archbishop Walsh's 'The Irish University Question.'\r\n\r\n[192] Too much is not to be made of 'Nationalist' clamour; but these\r\nremarks of Mr. Dillon, M.P., are significant (_Freeman's Journal_, April\r\n13, 1901): 'I do not believe that these movements will ever succeed ...\r\nuntil that fortress of English domination and anti-Irish bigotry, Trinity\r\nCollege, is for ever swept away, or there is placed opposite to it a truly\r\nNational University, where the most honoured classes will be the classes\r\nof Irish literature and Irish history.' Archbishop Walsh, a much abler\r\nman, has written in the same sense in his work, 'The Irish University\r\nQuestion.' The question, he contends, in many passages, must be settled by\r\nlevelling up or by levelling down, that is, by raising the Catholic\r\nUniversity to the position of Trinity College, or by disestablishing and\r\ndisendowing Trinity College. The evil precedent of the Act disestablishing\r\nthe Anglican Church in Ireland, will, it is hoped, be eschewed.\r\n\r\n[193] See on this subject Mr. Lough's 'England's Wealth, Ireland's\r\nPoverty,' pp. 88-94.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nPassages in italics are indicated by _italics_.\r\n\r\nPassages in bold are indicated by =bold=.\r\n\r\nThe original text includes Greek characters.
