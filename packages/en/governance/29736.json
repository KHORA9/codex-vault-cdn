III.--APRIL, 1863.--No. IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WONDERS OF WORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery nation has its legend of a 'golden age'--when all was young and\r\nfresh and fair--'_comme les couleurs primitives de la nature_'--even\r\nbefore the existence of this gaunt shadow of Sorrow--_the shadow of\r\nourselves_--that ever stalks in company with us;--an epoch of Saturnian\r\nrule, when gods held sweet converse with men, and man primeval bounded\r\nwith all the elasticity of god-given juvenility:\r\n\r\n        ('Ah! remember,\r\n  This--all this--was in the olden\r\n  Time long ago.')\r\n\r\nAnd even now, in spite of our atheism and our apathism, amid all the\r\noverwhelming world-influences of this great 'living Present'--the ghost\r\nof the dead Past will come rushing back upon us with its solemn voices\r\nand its infinite wailings of pity: but soft and faint it comes; for the\r\nwild jarrings of the Now almost prevent us from hearing its still, small\r\nvoices. It\r\n\r\n  'Is but a _dim-remembered_ story\r\n   Of the old time entombed.'\r\n\r\nBesides, what is History but the story of the bygone? The elegy, too,\r\ncomes to us as the last lamenting, sadly solemn swan-song of that\r\nglorious golden time. And, indeed, are not all poesies but various notes\r\nof that mighty diapason of Thought and Feeling, that has, through the\r\nages, been singing itself in jubilee and wail?\r\n\r\nSo it is in the individual--(for is not the individual ever the\r\nrudimental, formula-like expression of that awful problem which nations\r\nand humanity itself are slowly and painfully working out?): in the\r\n'moonlight of memory' these sorrowful mementos revisit every one of us;\r\nand\r\n\r\n        ----'But I am not _now_\r\n  That which I _have been_'--\r\n\r\nand _vanitas vanitatum!_ are not only the satisfied croakings of _blasé_\r\nChilde Harolds, but our universal experience; while from childhood's\r\ngushing glee even unto manhood's sad satiety, we feel that all are\r\nnought but the phantasmagoria\r\n\r\n                    'of a creature\r\n  _Moving about in worlds not realized_.'\r\n\r\nListen now to a snatch of melody:\r\n\r\n     'The rainbow comes and goes,\r\n      And lovely is the rose,\r\n      The moon doth with delight\r\n    Look round her when the heavens are bare;\r\n      Waters on a starry night\r\n      Are beautiful and fair;\r\n    The sunshine is a glorious birth;\r\n      But yet I know, wherever I go,\r\n  That there hath passed away a glory from the earth!'\r\n\r\nSo saith the mild Braminical Wordsworth. Now it will be remembered that\r\nWordsworth, in that glorious ode whence we extract the above, develops\r\nthe Platonic idea (shall we call Platonic that which has been\r\nentertained by the wise and the _feeling_ of all times?) of a shadowy\r\nrecollection of past and eternal existence in the profundities of the\r\nDivine Heart. 'It sounds forth here a mournful remembrance of a faded\r\nworld of gods and heroes--as the echoing plaint for the loss of man's\r\noriginal, celestial state, and paradisiacal innocence.' And then we have\r\nthose transcendent lines that come to us like aromatic breezes blowing\r\nfrom the Spice Islands:\r\n\r\n     'Hence in a season of calm weather,\r\n      Though inland far we be,\r\n  Our souls have sight of that immortal sea,\r\n      Which brought us hither,\r\n      Can in a moment travel thither,\r\n  And see the Children sport upon the shore,\r\n  And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.'\r\n\r\nBut,\r\n\r\n                 'descending\r\n  From these imaginative heights that yield\r\n  Far-stretching views into eternity,'--\r\n\r\nwhat have the golden age and Platonic _dicta_ to do with our\r\nword-ramble? A good deal. For we will endeavor to show that words, being\r\nthe very sign-manual of man's convictions, contain the elements of what\r\nmay throw light on both. To essay this:\r\n\r\nWhy is it that we generally speak of death as a 'return,' or a 'return\r\nhome'? And how is it that this same idea has so remarkably interwoven\r\nitself with the very warp and woof of our language and poetry?--so that\r\nin our fervency, we can sing:\r\n\r\n  'Jerusalem, my glorious _home_,' etc.\r\n\r\nDoes not the very idea (not to mention the composition of the word) of a\r\n'return' involve a previously having been in the place? And we can\r\nscarcely call that 'home' where we have never been before. So, that 'old\r\nHebrew book' sublimely tells us that 'the spirit of the man _returneth_\r\nto God who gave it.'\r\n\r\nIs it possible that these can be obscure intimations of that bygone time\r\nwhen WE were rocked in the bosom of the Divine consciousness?\r\nPerhaps.... And now if the reader will pardon a piece of moralizing, we\r\nwould say that these expressions teach us in the most emphatic way\r\nthat--'_This is not our rest_.' So that when we have dived into every\r\nmine of knowledge and drunk from every fountain of pleasure; when, with\r\nDante, we arrive at the painful conclusion that\r\n\r\n  'Tutto l'oro, ch'è sotto la luna,\r\n  E che già fu, di queste anime stanche\r\n  Non poterebbe farne posar una,'\r\n\r\n(since, indeed, the Finite can never gain entire satisfaction in\r\nitself)--we may not despair, but still the heart-throbbings, knowing\r\nthat He who has--for a season--enveloped us in the mantle of this\r\nsleep-rounded life, and thrown around himself the drapery of the\r\nuniverse--spangling it with stars--will again take us back to his\r\nfatherly bosom.\r\n\r\nSomewhat analogous to these, and arguing the eternity of our existence,\r\nwe have such words as 'decease,' which merely imports a _withdrawal_;\r\n'demise,' implying also a laying down, a _removal_. By the way, it is\r\nrather curious to observe the notions in the mind of mankind that have\r\ngiven rise to the words expressing 'death.' Thus we have the Latin word\r\n_mors_--allied, perhaps, to the Greek [Greek: moros] and [Greek:\r\nmoira],[1] from [Greek: meiromai]--to _portion out_, to _assign_. Even\r\nthis, however, there was a repulsion to using; and both the Greeks and\r\nRomans were wont to slip clear of the employment of their [Greek:\r\nthanatos], _mors_, etc., by such circumlocutions as _vitam suam mutare,\r\ntransire e seculo_; [Greek: koimêsato chalkeon hypnon]--_he slept the\r\nbrazen sleep_ (Homer's Iliad, [Greek: Lamda], 241); [Greek: ton de\r\nskotos oss' ekalypsen]--_and darkness covered his eyes_ (Iliad, [Greek:\r\nZeta], 11); or _he completeth the destiny of life_, etc. This reminds us\r\nof the French aversion to uttering their _mort_. These expressions,\r\nagain, are suggestive of our 'fate,' with an application similar to the\r\nLatin _fatum_, which, indeed, is none other than 'id quod _fatum est_ a\r\ndeis'--a God's word. So that in this sense we may all be considered\r\n'fatalists,' and all things _fated_. Why not? However, in the following\r\nfrom _Festus_, it is the 'deil' that makes the assertion:\r\n\r\n  'FESTUS.         Forced on us.\r\n\r\n  LUCIFER.  _All things are of necessity._\r\n\r\n  FESTUS.       Then best.\r\n\r\n  But the good are never fatalists. The bad\r\n  Alone act by necessity, they say.\r\n\r\n  LUCIFER. It matters not what men assume to be;\r\n   Or good, or bad, they are but what they are.'\r\n\r\nIn which we may agree that his majesty was not so very far wrong.\r\n\r\nMoreover, 'Why _should_ we mourn departed friends?'--since we know that\r\nthey are but lying in the [Greek: moimêtêrion] (cemetery)--the _sleeping\r\nplace_; or, as the vivid old Hebrew faith would have it, _the house of\r\nthe living_ (Bethaim). Is not this testimony for the soul's immortality\r\nworth as much as all the rhapsody written thereon, from Plato to\r\nAddison?\r\n\r\nSome words are the very essence of poetry; redolent with all beauteous\r\nphantasies; odoriferous as flowers in spring, or discoursing an awful\r\norgan-melody, like to the re-bellowing of the hoarse-sounding sea. For\r\ninstance, those two noble old Saxon words 'main' and 'deep,' that we\r\napply to the ocean--what a music is there about them! The 'main' is the\r\n_maegen_--the strength, the _strong one_; the great 'deep' is precisely\r\nwhat the name imports. Our employment of 'deep' reminds of the Latin\r\n_altum_, which, properly signifying high or lofty, is, by a familiar\r\nspecies of metonymy, put for its opposite.\r\n\r\nBy the way, how exceedingly timid are our poets and poetasters generally\r\nof the open sea--_la pleine mer_. They linger around the shores thereof,\r\nin a vain attempt to sit snugly there _à leur aise_, while they 'call\r\nspirits from the vasty deep'--that never did and never would come on\r\nsuch conditions, though they grew hoarse over it. We all remember how\r\nSandy Smith labors with making abortive _grabs_ at its _amber tails_,\r\n_main_, etc. (rather slippery articles on the whole)--but he is not\r\n\r\n  'A shepherd in the Hebrid Isles,\r\n  _Placed far amid the melancholy main!_'\r\n\r\nHail shade of Thomson! But hear how the exile sings it:\r\n\r\n  'La mer! partout la mer! des flots, des flots encor!\r\n  L'oiseau fatigue en vain son inégal essor.\r\n     Ici les flots, là-bas les ondes.\r\n  Toujours des flots sans fin par des flots repoussés;\r\n  L'oeil ne voit que des flots dans l'abime entassés\r\n     Rouler sous les vaques profondes.'[2]\r\n\r\nThis we, for our part, would pronounce one of the very best open-sea\r\nsketches we have ever met with; and if the reader will take even our\r\nunequal rendering, he may think so too.\r\n\r\n  'The sea! all round, the sea! flood, flood o'er billow surges!\r\n   In vain the bird fatigued its faltering wing here urges.\r\n     Billows beneath, waves, waves around;\r\n  Ever the floods (no end!) by urging floods repulsed;\r\n  The eye sees but the waves, in an abyss engulphed,\r\n     Roll 'neath their lairs profound.'\r\n\r\n'Aurora' comes to us as a remnant of that beautiful Grecian mythology\r\nthat deified and poetized everything; and even to us she is still the\r\n'rosy-fingered daughter of the morn.' The 'Levant,' 'Orient,' and\r\n'Occident' are all of them poetical, for they are all true translations\r\nfrom nature. The 'Levant' is where the sun is _levant_, raising himself\r\nup. 'Orient' will be recognized as the same figure from _orior_; while\r\n'occident' is, of course, the opposite in signification, namely, the\r\ndeclining, the 'setting' place.\r\n\r\n'Lethe' is another classic myth. It is [Greek: ho tês lêthês\r\npotamos]--the river of forgetfulness, 'the oblivious pool.' Perhaps is\r\nit that all of us, as well as the son of Thetis, had a dip therein.\r\n\r\nThere exists not a more poetic expression than 'Hyperborean,' _i. e._\r\n[Greek: hyperboreos]--_beyond Boreas_; or, as a modern poet finely and\r\nfaithfully expands it:\r\n\r\n               'Beyond those regions cold\r\n  Where dwells the Spirit of the North-Wind,\r\n     Boreas old.'\r\n\r\nHomer never manifested himself to be more of a poet than in the creation\r\nof this word. By the way, the Hyperboreans were regarded by the ancients\r\nas an extremely happy and pious people.\r\n\r\nHow few of those who use that very vague, grandiloquent word 'Ambrosial'\r\nknow that it has reference to the 'ambrosia' ([Greek: ambrotos],\r\n_immortal_), the food of the gods! It has, however, a secondary\r\nsignification, namely, that of an unguent, or perfume, hence fragrant;\r\nand this is probably the prevailing idea in our 'ambrosial': instance\r\nMilton's 'ambrosial flowers.' It was, like the 'nectar' ([Greek:\r\nnektar], an _elixir vitæ_), considered a veritable elixir of\r\nimmortality, and consequently denied to men.\r\n\r\nThe Immortals, in their golden halls of 'many-topped Olympus,' seem to\r\nhave led a merry-enough life of it over their nectar and ambrosia, their\r\nlaughter and intrigues.\r\n\r\nBut not half as jolly were they as were Odin and the Iotun--dead drunk\r\nin Valhalla over their mead and ale, from\r\n\r\n        'the ale-cellars of the Iotun,\r\n  Which is called Brimir.'\r\n\r\nThe daisy (Saxon _Daeges ege_) has often been cited as fragrant with\r\npoesy. It is the _Day's Eye_: we remember Chaucer's affectionate lines:\r\n\r\n        'Of all the floures in the mede\r\n  Than love I most those floures of white and rede,\r\n  Such that men called _daisies_ in our toun,\r\n  To them I have so great affection.'\r\n\r\nNor is he alone in his love for the\r\n\r\n  _'Wee, modest, crimson-tipped flouer.'_\r\n\r\nAn odoriferous-enough (etymologic) bouquet could we cull from the names\r\nof Flora's children. What a beauty is there in the 'primrose,' which is\r\njust the _prime_-rose; in the 'Beauty of the Night' and the 'Morning\r\nGlory,' except when a pompous scientific terminology, would convert it\r\ninto a _convolvulus_! So, too, the 'Anemone' ([Greek: anemos], the\r\nwind-flower), into which it is fabled Venus changed her Adonis. What a\r\nstory of maiden's love does the 'Sweet William' tell; and how many\r\ncharming associations cluster around the 'Forget-me-not!' Again, is\r\nthere not poetry in calling a certain family of minute crustacea, whose\r\ntwo eyes meet and form a single round spot in the centre of the head,\r\n'Cyclops'--([Greek: kyklôps], circular-eyed)?\r\n\r\nAnd if any one thinketh that there cannot be poetry even in the dry\r\ntechnicalities of science, let him take such an expression as 'coral,'\r\nwhich, in the original Greek, [Greek: koralion], signifies a _sea\r\ndamsel_; or the chemical 'cobalt,' 'which,' remarks Webster, 'is said to\r\nbe the German _Kobold_, a goblin, the demon of the mines; so called by\r\nminers, because cobalt was troublesome to miners, and at first its value\r\nwas not known.' Ah! but these terms were created before _Science_, in\r\nits rigidity, had taught us the _truth_ in regard to these matters. Yes!\r\nand fortunate is it for us that we still have words, and ideas\r\nclustering around these words, that have not yet been chilled and\r\nexanimated by the frigid touch of an empirical knowledge. For\r\n\r\n  'Still the heart doth need a language, still\r\n  Doth the old instinct bring back the old names.'\r\n\r\nAnd may benign heaven deliver us from those buckram individuals who\r\nimagine that Nature is as narrow and rigid as their own contracted\r\nselves, and who would seek to array her in their own exquisite\r\nbottle-green bifurcations and a _gilet à la mode_! These characters\r\nalways put us in mind of the statues of Louis XIV, in which he is\r\nrepresented as Jupiter or Hercules, nude, with the exception of the\r\nlion's hide thrown round him--_and the long, flowing peruke_ of the\r\ntimes! O Jupiter _tonans_! let us have either the lion or the ass--only\r\nlet it be _veracious_!\r\n\r\nTo proceed: 'Auburn' is probably connected with _brennan_, and means\r\n_sun-burned_, analogous, indeed, to 'Ethiopian' ([Greek: Aithiops]),\r\n_one whom the sun has looked upon_.\r\n\r\nHow seldom do we think, in uttering 'adieu,' that we verily say, I\r\ncommend you _à Dieu_--to God; that the lightly-spoken _good-by_ means\r\n_God be wi' you_,[3] or that the (if possible) still more frequent and\r\n_unthinking_ 'thank you,' in reality assures the person addressed--_I\r\nwill think often of you_.\r\n\r\n'Eld' is a word that has the poetic aroma about it, and is an example\r\n(of which we might adduce additional cases from the domain of 'poetic\r\ndiction') of a word set aside from a prose use and devoted exclusively\r\nto poetry. It is, as we know, Saxon, signifying _old_ or _old age_, and\r\nwas formerly in constant use in this sense; as, for instance, in\r\nChaucer's translation of _Boethius de Consolatione Philosophiæ_, we find\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n     'At laste no drede ne might overcame tho muses, that thei ne weren\r\n     fellowes, and foloweden my waie, that is to saie, when I was\r\n     exiled, thei that weren of my youth whilom welfull and grene,\r\n     comforten now sorrowfull weirdes of me olde man: for _elde_ is\r\n     comen unwarely upon me, hasted by the harmes that I have, and\r\n     sorowe hath commaunded his age to be in me.'\r\n\r\nSo in the _Knightes Tale_:\r\n\r\n  'As sooth in said _elde_ hath gret avantage;\r\n  In _elde_ is both wisdom and usage:\r\n  Men may the old out-renne but not out-rede.'\r\n\r\nOh! what an overflowing fulness of truth and beauty is there wrapped up\r\nin the core of these articulations that we so heedlessly utter, would we\r\nbut make use of the wizard's wand wherewith to evoke them! What an\r\nexhaustless wealth does there lie in even the humblest fruitage and\r\nflowerage of language, and what a fecundity have even dry 'roots'!\r\n\r\n'Thinkest thou there were no poets till Dan Chaucer?' asks our great\r\nThomas; 'no heart burning with a thought, which it could not hold, and\r\nhad no word for; and needed to shape and coin a word for--what thou\r\ncallest a metaphor, trope, or the like? For every word we have, there\r\nwas such a man and poet. The coldest word was once a glowing new\r\nmetaphor, and bold questionable originality. 'Thy very ATTENTION, does\r\nit not mean an _attentio_, a STRETCHING-TO?' Fancy that act of the mind\r\nwhich all were conscious of, which none had yet named--when this new\r\n'poet' first felt bound and driven to name it! His questionable\r\noriginality and new glowing metaphor was found adoptible, intelligible;\r\nand remains our name for it to this day.'[4]\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a pet etymology of Carlyle, as he makes Professor\r\nTeufelsdröckh give it to us also.\r\n\r\nNor less of a poet was that Grecian man who first named this beauteous\r\nworld--with its boundless unity in variety--the [Greek: kosmos],[5] the\r\n_order_, the _adornment_. But\r\n\r\n  'Alas, for the rarity\r\n  Of Christian charity,'\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n  'Ah! the inanity\r\n  Of frail humanity,'\r\n\r\nthat first induced some luckless mortal to give to certain mysterious\r\ncompounds the appellation of _cosmetics_! But here is an atonement; for\r\neven in our unmythical, unbelieving days, the god 'Terminus' is made to\r\nstand guard over every railway station! Again, how finely did the Roman\r\ncall his heroism his 'virtus'--his _vir_tue--his _manliness_. With the\r\nItalians, however, it became quite a different thing; for his 'virtu' is\r\nnone other than his love of the fine arts (these being to him the only\r\nsubject of _manly_ occupation), a mere _objet de vertu_; and his\r\n_virtuoso_ has no more virtuousness or manliness about him than what\r\nappertains to being skilled in these same fine arts. With us, our\r\n'virtue' is ... well, as soon as we can find out, we will tell you.\r\n\r\nBy the way, in what a _bathos_ of mystery are most of our terms\r\nexpressing the moral relations plunged! Some philosophers have declared\r\nthat truth lies at the bottom of a well;--the well in which the truth in\r\nregard to these matters lies would seem to stretch far enough\r\ndown--reaching, in fact, almost to the kingdom of the Inane. The\r\nbeautiful simplicity of Bible truths has often become so perverted--so\r\noverloaded by the vain works (and _words_) of man's device--as barely to\r\nescape total extinction. Witness 'repentance'; in what a farrago of\r\nendless absurdities and palpable contradictions has this word (and, more\r\nunfortunately still, the thing itself along with it) been enveloped!\r\nAccording to the 'divines,' what does it not signify? Its composition,\r\nwe very well know, gives us _poenitentia_, from _poenitere_, to _be\r\nsorry_, to _regret_--and such is its true and _only_ meaning. 'This\r\ndesign' (that of the analysis of language in its elementary forms), says\r\nWilkins, 'will likewise contribute much to the clearing of some of our\r\nmodern differences in religion; by unmasking many wild errors, that\r\nshelter themselves under the disguise of affected phrases; which being\r\nphilosophically unfolded, and rendered according to the genuine and\r\nnatural importance of words, will appear to be inconsistencies and\r\nabsurdities.' Nor would he have gone very far astray had he put\r\n_philosophy_ and _politics_ under the same category. Strip the gaudy\r\ndress and trappings from an expression, and it will have a most marked\r\nresult. Analysis is a terrible humiliation to your mysticism and your\r\ngrandiloquence--and an awful bore to those who depend for effect on\r\neither. We have something to say hereafter on those astonishingly\r\nprofound oracles whose only depth is in the terminology they employ. In\r\nthe mean time, expect not too much of words. Never, in all our\r\nphilologic researches, must we lose sight of the fact that _words are\r\nbut the daughters of earth, while things are the sons of heaven_. This\r\nexpecting too much of words has been the fruitful source of innumerable\r\nerrors. To resume:\r\n\r\nTake a dozen words (to prove our generosity, we will let it be a baker's\r\ndozen) illustrative of this same principle of metaphor that governs the\r\nmechanism of language, and sheds a glory and a beauty around even our\r\nevery-day fireside words; so that even those that seem hackneyed, worn\r\nout, and apparently tottering with the imbecility of old age--would we\r\nbut get into the core of them--will shine forth with all the expressive\r\nmeaning of their spring time--with the blush and bloom of poesy--\r\n\r\n  'All redolent with youth and flowers,'\r\n\r\nand prove their very abusers--poets.\r\n\r\nThe 'halcyon' days! What a balmy serenity hovers around them--basking in\r\nthe sunlight of undisturbed tranquillity. This we feel; but how we\r\nrealize it after reading the little _family secret_ that it wraps up!\r\nThe [Greek: Halkyôn] (halcyon)--_alcedo hispida_--was the name applied\r\nby the Greeks to the _kingfisher_ (a name commonly derived from [Greek:\r\nhals, kyô], i. e., _sea-conceiving_, from the fact of this bird's being\r\nsaid to lay her eggs in rocks near the sea); and the [Greek: halkyonides\r\nhêmerai]--_halcyon days_--were those fourteen 'during the calm weather\r\nabout the winter solstice,' during which the bird was said to build her\r\nnest and lay her eggs; hence, by an easy transition, perfect quietude in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThose who have felt the bitter, biting effect of 'sarcasm,' will hardly\r\nbe disposed to consider it a metaphor even, should we trace it back to\r\nthe Greek [Greek: sarkazô]--_to tear off the flesh_ ([Greek: sarx]),\r\n_literally_, to 'flay.' 'Satire,' again, has an arbitrary-enough origin;\r\nit is _satira_, from _satur_, _mixed_; and the application is as\r\nfollows: each species of poetry had, among the Romans, its own special\r\nkind of versification; thus the hexameter was used in the epic, the\r\niambic in the drama, etc. Ennius, however, the earliest Latin\r\n'satirist,' first disregarded these conventionalities, and introduced a\r\n_medley_ (satira) of all kinds of metres. It afterward, however, lost\r\nthis idea of a _melange_, and acquired the notion of a poem 'directed\r\nagainst the vices and failings of men with a view to their correction.'\r\n\r\nPerhaps we owe to reviewing the metaphorical applications of such terms\r\nas 'caustic,' 'mordant,' 'piquant,' etc., in their _burning_, _biting_,\r\nand _pricking_ senses.\r\n\r\nBut 'review,' itself, we are to regard as pure metaphor. Our friend\r\n'Snooks,' at least, found _that_ out; for, instead of _re_-viewing--_i.\r\ne._, viewing again and again his book, they pronounced it to be\r\ndecidedly bad without any examination whatever. A 'critic' we all\r\nrecognize in his character of _judge_ or _umpire_; but is it that he\r\nalways possesses discrimination--has he always _insight_ (for these are\r\nthe primary ideas attaching themselves to [Greek: krinô], whence [Greek:\r\nkritikos] comes)--does he divide between the merely arbitrary and\r\nincidental, and see into the absolute and eternal Art-Soul that vivifies\r\na poem or a picture? If so, then is he a critic indeed.\r\n\r\nHow perfectly do 'invidiousness' and 'envy'[6] express the _looking over\r\nagainst_ (_in-video_)--the _askance gaze_--the natural development of\r\nthat painful mental state which poor humanity is so subject to! So with\r\n'obstinacy' (_ob-sto_), which, by the way, the phrenologists represent,\r\nliterally enough, by an ass in a position which assuredly Webster had in\r\nhis mind when he wrote his definition of this word; thus: ... '_in a\r\nfixedness in opinion or resolution that cannot be shaken at all, or\r\nwithout great difficulty_.'\r\n\r\nSpeaking of this reminds us of those very capital 'Illustrations of\r\nPhrenology,' by Cruikshank, with which we all are familiar, and where,\r\nfor example, '_veneration_ is exemplified by a stout old gentleman, with\r\nan ample paunch, gazing with admiring eyes and uplifted hands on the fat\r\nside of an ox fed by Mr. Heavyside, and exhibited at the stall of a\r\nbutcher. In this way a Jew old-clothes man, holding his hand on his\r\nbreast with the utmost earnestness, while in the other he offers a coin\r\nfor a pair of slippers, two pairs of boots, three hats, and a large\r\nbundle of clothes, to an old woman, who, evidently astonished all over,\r\nexclaims, 'A shilling!' is an illustration of _conscientiousness_. A\r\ndialogue of two fishwomen at Billingsgate illustrates _language_, and a\r\nriot at Donnybrook Fair explains the phrenological doctrine of\r\n_combativeness_.'\r\n\r\nBut peace to the 'bumps,' and pass we on. Could anything be more\r\ncompletely metaphorical than such expressions as 'egregious' and\r\n'fanatic?' 'Egregious' is chosen, _e-grex_--_out of the flock_, i. e.,\r\nthe best sheep, etc., selected from the rest, and set aside for sacred\r\npurposes; hence, _distingué_. This word, though occupying at present\r\ncomparatively neutral ground, seems fast merging toward its worst\r\napplication. Can it be that an 'egregious' _rogue_ is an article of so\r\nmuch more frequent occurrence than an 'egregiously' _honest_ man, that\r\nincongruity seems to subsist between the latter? 'Fanatic,' again, is\r\njust the Roman '_fanaticus_,' one addicted to the _fana_,[7] the temples\r\nin which the 'fanatici' or fanatics were wont to spend an extraordinary\r\nportion of their time. But besides this, their religious fervor used to\r\nimpel them to many extravagances, such as cutting themselves with\r\nknives, etc., and hence an 'ultraist' (one who goes _beyond_ (ultra) the\r\nnotions of other people) in any sense. Whereupon it might be remarked\r\nthat though\r\n\r\n  'Coelum, non animum, mutant qui trans mare currunt,'\r\n\r\nmay, in certain applications, be true, it is surely not so in the case\r\nof a good many words. Thus this very instance, 'fanatic,' which, among\r\nthe Romans, implied one who had an _extra share of devotion_, is, among\r\nus--the better informed on this head--by a very curious and very\r\nunfathomable figure (disfigure?) of speech or logic, applied to one who\r\nhas a peculiar _penchant_ for human liberty!\r\n\r\n  'In the most high and _palmy_ state of Rome,\r\n  A little ere the mighty Julius fell,\r\n  The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead\r\n  Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets.'\r\n\r\nWe do not quote this for the sake of the making-the-hair-to-stand-on-end\r\ntendencies of the last two lines, but through the voluptuous quiescence\r\nof the first,\r\n\r\n  'In the most high and palmy state of Rome,'\r\n\r\nto introduce the beautifully metaphorical expression, 'palmy.' It will,\r\nof course, be immediately recognized as being from the 'palm' tree; that\r\nis to say, _palm-abounding_. And what visions of orient splendor does it\r\nbear with it, wafting on its wings the very aroma of the isles of the\r\nblest--[Greek: makarôn nêsoi]--or\r\n\r\n  'Where the gorgeous East, with richest hand,\r\n  Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold!'\r\n\r\nIt bears us away with it, and we stand on that sun-kissed land\r\n\r\n  'Whose rivers wander over sands of gold,'\r\n\r\nwith a houri lurking in every 'bosky bourne,' and the beauteous palm,\r\nwaving its umbrageous head, at once food, shade, and shelter.\r\n\r\nThe palm being to the Oriental of such passing price, we can easily\r\nimagine how he would so enhance its value as to make it the type of\r\neverything that is prosperous and glorious and 'palmy,' the _beau-ideal_\r\nof everything that is flourishing. Hear what Sir Walter Raleigh says on\r\nthis subject: 'Nothing better proveth the excellency of this soil than\r\nthe abundant growing of the _palm trees_ without labor of man. _This\r\ntree alone giveth unto man whatsoever his life beggeth at nature's\r\nhand._'\r\n\r\n'Paradise,' too, is oriental in all its associations. It is [Greek:\r\nparadeisos],[8] that is, a _park_ or _pleasure ground_, in which sense\r\nit is constantly employed by Xenophon, as every weary youth who has\r\n_parasanged_ it with him knows. By the LXX it was used in a metaphorical\r\nsense for the garden of Eden:\r\n\r\n          'The glories we have known,\r\n  And that imperial palace whence we came;'\r\n\r\nbut a still loftier meaning did it acquire when the Christ employed it\r\nas descriptive of the splendors of the 'better land'--of the glories and\r\nbeauties of the land Beulah.\r\n\r\nBut, look out, fellow strollers, for we are off in a tangent!\r\n\r\nWhat a curiously humble origin has 'literature,' contrasted with the\r\nmagnitude of its present import. It is just 'litteral'--_letters_ in\r\ntheir most primitive sense; and [Greek: grammata] is nought other. Nor\r\ncan even all the pomposity of the 'belles-lettres' carry us any farther\r\nthan the very fine 'letters' or _litteral_; while even Solomon So-so may\r\ntake courage when he reflects (provided Solomon be ever guilty of\r\nreflecting) that the 'literati' have 'literally' nothing more profound\r\nabout them than the knowledge of their 'letters.' The Latins were\r\nprolific in words of this kind; thus they had the _literatus_ and the\r\n_literator_--making some such discrimination between them as we do\r\nbetween 'philosopher' and 'philosophe.'\r\n\r\n'Unlettered,' to be sure, is one who is unacquainted even with his\r\n'letters;' but what is 'erudite?' It is merely E, _out of_, a RUDIS,\r\n_rude_, _chaotic_, _ignorant_ state of things; and thus in itself\r\nasserts nothing very tremendous, and makes no very prodigious\r\npretensions. Surely these words had their origin at an epoch when\r\n'letters' stood higher in the scale of estimation than they do now; when\r\nhe who knew them possessed a spell that rendered him a potent character\r\namong the 'unlettered.'\r\n\r\nA 'spell' did we say? Perhaps that is not altogether fanciful; for\r\n'spell' itself in the Saxon primarily imports a _word_; and we know that\r\nthe runes or Runic letters were long employed in this way. For instance,\r\nMr. Turner thus informs us ('History of the Anglo-Saxons,' vol. i, p.\r\n169): 'It was the invariable policy of the Roman ecclesiastics to\r\ndiscourage the use of the Runic characters, because they were of pagan\r\norigin, and had been much connected with idolatrous superstitions.' And\r\nif any one be incredulous, let him read this from Sir Thomas Brown:\r\n'Some have delivered the polity of spirits, that they stand in awe of\r\ncharms, _spells_, and conjurations; _letters_, characters, notes, and\r\ndashes.' And have not the [Greek: Alpha] and [Greek: Ômega] something\r\nmystic and cabalistic about them even to us?\r\n\r\nWhile on this, let us note that 'spell' gives us the beautiful and\r\ncheering expression 'gospel,' which is precisely _God's-spell_--the\r\n'evangile,' the good God's-news!\r\n\r\nTo resume:\r\n\r\n'Graphical' ([Greek: graphô]) is just what is well\r\ndelineated--_literally_, 'well written,' or, as our common expression\r\ncorroboratively has it, _like a book_!\r\n\r\n'Style' and 'stiletto' would, from their significations, appear to be\r\nradically very different words; and yet they are something more akin\r\nthan even cousins-german. 'Style' is known to be from the [Greek:\r\nstylos], or _stylus_, which the Greeks and Romans employed in writing on\r\ntheir waxen tablets; and, as they were both sharp and strong, they\r\nbecame in the hands of scholars quite formidable instruments when used\r\nagainst their schoolmasters. Afterward they came to be employed in all\r\nthe bloody relations and uses to which a 'bare bodkin' can be put, and\r\nhence our acceptation of 'stiletto.' Cæsar himself, it is supposed, got\r\nhis 'quietus' by means of a 'stylus;' nor is he the first or last\r\ncharacter whose 'style' has been his (_literary_, if not _literal_)\r\ndamnation.\r\n\r\n'Volume,' too, how perfectly metaphorical is it in its present\r\nreception! It is originally just a _volumen_, that is, a 'roll' of\r\nparchment, papyrus, or whatever else the 'book' (i. e., the _bark_--the\r\n'liber') might be composed of. Nor can we regard as aught other such\r\nterms as 'leaf' or 'folio,' which is also 'leaf.' 'Stave,' too, is\r\nsuggestive of the _staff_ on which the runes were wont to be cut.\r\nIndeed, old almanacs are sometimes to be met with consisting of these\r\nlong sticks or 'staves,' on which the days and months are represented by\r\nthe Runic letters.\r\n\r\n'Charm,' 'enchant,' and 'incantation' all owe their origin to the time\r\nwhen spells were in vogue. 'Charm' is just _carmen_, from the fact that\r\n'a kind of Runic rhyme' was employed in _diablerie_ of this sort; so\r\n'enchant' and 'incantation' are but a _singing to_--a true 'siren's\r\nsong;' while 'fascination' took its rise when the mystic terrors of the\r\n_evil eye_ threw its withering blight over many a heart.\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with the old fable of _The Town Mouse and the\r\nCountry Mouse_. We will vouch that the following read us as luminous a\r\ncomment thereon as may be desired: 'Polite,' 'urbane,' 'civil,'\r\n'rustic,' 'villain,' 'savage,' 'pagan,' 'heathen.' Let us seek the\r\nmoral:\r\n\r\n'Polite,' 'urbane,' and 'civil' we of course recognize as being\r\nrespectively from [Greek: polis], _urbs_, and _civis_, each denoting the\r\ncity or town--_la grande ville_. 'Polite' is _city-like_; while\r\n'urbanity' and 'civility' carry nothing deeper with them than the\r\ngraces and the attentions that belong to the punctilious town. 'Rustic'\r\nwe note as implying nothing more uncultivated than a 'peasant,' which is\r\njust _pays_-an, or, as we also say, a 'countryman.' 'Savage,' too, or,\r\nas we ought to write it, _salvage_,[9] is nothing more grim or terrible\r\nthan one who dwells _in sylvis_, in the woods--a meaning we can\r\nappreciate from our still comparatively pure application of the\r\nadjective _sylvan_. A 'backwoodsman' is therefore the very best original\r\ntype of a _savage_! 'Savage' seems to be hesitating between its civil\r\nand its ethical applications; 'villain,' 'pagan,' and 'heathen,'\r\nhowever, have become quite absorbed in their moral sense--and this by a\r\ncontortion that would seem strange enough were we not constantly\r\naccustomed to such transgressions. For we need not to be informed that\r\n'villain' primarily and properly implies simply one who inhabits a ville\r\nor _village_. In Chaucer, for example, we see it without at least any\r\nmoral signification attached thereto:\r\n\r\n  'But firste I praie you of your curtesie\r\n  That ye ne arette it not my _vilanie_.'\r\n\r\n  _Prologue to the Canterbury Tales._\r\n\r\nSo a 'pagan,' or _paganus_, is but a dweller in a _pagus_, or village;\r\nprecisely equivalent to the Greek [Greek: kômêtês], with no other idea\r\nwhatever attached thereto; while 'heathen' imported those who lived on\r\nthe _heaths_ or in the country, consequently far away from\r\n_civilization_ or _town-like-ness_.\r\n\r\nFrom all of which expressions we may learn the mere conventionality and\r\nthe utter arbitrariness of even our most important ethical terms. How\r\nprodigiously _cheap_ is the application of any such epithets,\r\nconsidering the terrible abuse they have undergone! And how poor is that\r\nphilosophy that can concentrate 'politeness' and 'civility' in the\r\nfrippery and heartlessness of mere external city-forms; and convert the\r\nman who dwells in the woods or in the village into a _savage_ or a\r\n_villain_! How fearful a lack do these numerous words and their so\r\nprolific analogues manifest of acknowledgment of that glorious principle\r\nwhich Burns has with fire-words given utterance to--and to which, would\r\nwe preserve the dignity of manhood, we must hold on--\r\n\r\n  'A man's a man for a' that!'\r\n\r\nAh! it is veritably enough to make us atrabiliar! Here we see words in\r\ntheir weaknesses and their meannesses, as elsewhere in their glory and\r\nbeauty. And not so much _their_ meanness and weakness, as that of those\r\nwho have distorted these innocent servants of truth to become tools of\r\nfalsehood and the abject instruments of the extinction of all honesty\r\nand nobleness.\r\n\r\nThe word 'health' wraps up in it--for, indeed, it is hardly\r\nmetaphorical--a whole world of thought and suggestion. It is that which\r\n_healeth_ or maketh one to be _whole_, or, as the Scotch say, _hale_;\r\nwhich _whole_ or _hale_ (for they are one word) may imply entireness or\r\nunity; that is to say, perfect 'health' is that state of the system in\r\nwhich there is no disorganization--no division of interest--but when it\r\nis recognized as a perfect _one_ or whole; or, in other words, not\r\nrecognized at all. And this meaning is confirmed by our analogue\r\n_sanity_, which, from _sanus_, and allied to [Greek: saos], has\r\nunderneath it a similar basis.\r\n\r\nEvery student of Carlyle will remember the very telling use to which he\r\nputs the idea contained in this word--speaking of the manifold relations\r\nof physical, psychal, and social health. Reference is made to his\r\nemployment of it in the 'Characteristics'--itself one of the most\r\nauthentic and veracious pieces of philosophy that it has been our lot to\r\nmeet with for a long time; yet wherein he proves the impossibility of\r\nany, and the uselessness of all philosophies. Listen while he\r\ndiscourses thereon: 'So long as the several elements of life, all fitly\r\nadjusted, can pour forth their movement like harmonious tuned strings,\r\nit is melody and unison: life, from its mysterious fountains, flows out\r\nas in celestial music and diapason--which, also, like that other music\r\nof the spheres, even because it is perennial and complete, without\r\ninterruption and without imperfection, might be fabled to escape the\r\near. Thus, too, in some languages, is the state of health well denoted\r\nby a term expressing unity; when we feel ourselves as we wish to be, we\r\nsay that we are _whole_.'\r\n\r\nBut our psychal and social wholeness or health, as well as our physical,\r\nis yet, it would appear, in the future, in the good time _coming_--\r\n\r\n          'When man to man\r\n  Shall brothers be and a' that!'\r\n\r\nEven that, however, is encouraging--that it is _in prospectu_. For we\r\nknow that _right before us_ lies this great promised land--this\r\n_Future_, teeming with all the donations of infinite time, and bursting\r\nwith blessings. And for us, too, there are in waiting [Greek: makarôn\r\nnêsoi], or Islands of the Blest, where all heroic doers and all heroic\r\nsufferers shall enjoy rest forever!\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, take the benediction of serene old Miguel de Cervantes\r\nSaavedra, in his preface to 'Don Quixote' (could we possibly have a\r\nbetter?): 'And so God give you _health_, not forgetting me. Farewell!'\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This alliance may be fanciful (though we observe some of\r\nthe best German lexicographers have it so); a better origin might,\r\nperhaps, be found in the Sanscrit _mri_, etc.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 'Les Orientals,' par VICTOR HUGO. _Le Feu du ciel._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The 'by' may, however, have the force of going or passing,\r\nequivalent to 'fare' in 'farewell,' or 'welfare,' _i. e._, may you have\r\na good passage or journey.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: 'Past and Present,' pp. 128, 129.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Compare with this the Latin _mundus_, which is exactly\r\nanalogous in signification.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: En-voir.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Perhaps nothing could better prove how profoundly\r\n_religious_ were the Latins than a word compounded of the above; namely\r\n'profane.'

I wonder that the ancients, who\r\ncame so near it in so many ways, never made a goddess of Contrast. They\r\nhad something like it in ever-varying Future--something like it in\r\ndouble-faced Janus, who was their real 'Angel of the Odd.' Perhaps it is\r\nmy ignorance which is at fault--if so, I pray you correct me. The subtle\r\nNeo-Platonists _must_ have apotheosized such a savor to all æsthetic\r\nbliss. Mostly do I feel its charm when there come before me pictures\r\ntrue to life of far lands and lives, of valley and river, sea and shore.\r\nThen I forget the narrow office and the shop-lined street, the rattling\r\ncars and hurried hotel-lodgment, and think what it would be if nature,\r\nin all her freshness and never-ending contrasts, could be my\r\never-present.\r\n\r\nI thought this yesterday, in glancing over an old manuscript in my\r\ndrawer, containing translations, by some hand to me unknown, of sketches\r\nof Sweden by the fairy-story teller Hans Christian Andersen. Reader,\r\nwill they strike you as pleasantly as they did me? I know not. Let us\r\nglance them over. They have at least the full flavor of the North, of\r\nthe healthy land of frost and pines, of fragrant birch and of sweeter\r\nmeadow-grass, and simpler, holier flowers than the rich South ever\r\nshowed, even in her simplest moods.\r\n\r\nThe first of these sketches sweeps us at once far away over the\r\nNorthland:\r\n\r\n     'WE JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n     'It is spring, fragrant spring, the birds are singing. You do not\r\n     understand their song? Then hear it in free translation:\r\n\r\n     ''Seat thyself upon my back!' said the stork, the holy bird of our\r\n     green island. 'I will carry thee over the waves of the Sound.\r\n     Sweden also has its fresh, fragrant beechwoods, green meadows, and\r\n     fields of waving corn; in Schoonen, under the blooming apple trees\r\n     behind the peasant's house, thou wilt imagine thyself still in\r\n     Denmark!'\r\n\r\n     ''Fly with me,' said the swallow. 'I fly over Hal-land's mountain\r\n     ridges, where the beeches cease. I soar farther toward the north\r\n     than the stork. I will show you where the arable land retires\r\n     before rocky valleys. You shall see friendly towns, old churches,\r\n     solitary court yards, within which it is cosy and pleasant to\r\n     dwell, where the family stands in circle around the table with the\r\n     smoking platters, and asks a blessing through the mouth of the\r\n     youngest child, and morning and evening sings a holy song. I have\r\n     heard it, I have seen it, when I was yet small, from my nest under\r\n     the roof.'\r\n\r\n     ''Come! come!' cried the unsteady seagull, impatiently waiting, and\r\n     ever flying round in a circle. 'Follow me into the Scheeren, where\r\n     thousands of rocky islands, covered with pines and firs, lie along\r\n     the coasts like flower beds; where the fisherman draws full nets!'\r\n\r\n     ''Let yourself down between our outspread wings!' sing the wild\r\n     swans. 'We will bear you to the great seas, to the ever-roaring,\r\n     arrow-quick mountain streams, where the oak does not thrive and the\r\n     birches are stunted; let yourself down between our outspread\r\n     wings,--we soar high over Sulitelma, the eye of the island, as the\r\n     mountain is called; we fly from the spring-green valley, over the\r\n     snow waves, up to the summit of the mountain, whence you may catch\r\n     a glimpse of the North Sea, beyond Norway. We fly toward Jamtland,\r\n     with its high blue mountains, where the waterfalls roar, where the\r\n     signal fires flame up as signs from coast to coast that they are\r\n     waiting for the ferry boat--up to the deep, cold, hurrying floods,\r\n     which do not see the sun set in midsummer, where twilight is dawn!'\r\n\r\n     'So sing the birds! Shall we hearken to their song--follow them, at\r\n     least a short way? We do not seat ourselves upon the wings of the\r\n     swan, nor upon the back of the stork; we stride forward with steam\r\n     and horses, sometimes upon our own feet, and glance, at the same\r\n     time, now and then, from the actual, over the hedge into the\r\n     kingdom of fancy, that is always our near neighborland, and pluck\r\n     flowers or leaves, which shall be placed together in the memorandum\r\n     book--they bud indeed on the flight of the journey. We fly, and we\r\n     sing: Sweden, thou glorious land! Sweden, whither holy gods came in\r\n     remote antiquity from the mountains of Asia; thou land that art yet\r\n     illumined by their glitter! It streams out of the flowers, with the\r\n     name of Linnæus; it beams before thy knightly people from the\r\n     banner of Charles the Twelfth, it sounds out of the memorial stone\r\n     erected upon the field at Lutzen. Sweden! thou land of deep\r\n     feeling, of inward songs, home of the clear streams, where wild\r\n     swans sing in the northern light's glimmer! thou land, upon whose\r\n     deep, still seas the fairies of the North build their colonnades\r\n     and lead their struggling spirit-hosts over the ice mirror.\r\n     Glorious Sweden, with the perfume-breathing Linea, with Jenny's\r\n     soulful songs! To thee will we fly with the stork and the swallow,\r\n     with the unsteady seagull and the wild swan. Thy birchwood throws\r\n     out its perfume so refreshing and animating, under its hanging,\r\n     earnest boughs--on its white trunk shall the harp hang. Let the\r\n     summer wind of the North glide murmuring over its strings.'\r\n\r\nThere is true fatherland's love there. I doubt if there was ever yet\r\n_real_ patriotism in a hot climate--the North is the only home of\r\nunselfish and great union. Italy owes it to the cool breezes of her\r\nApennines that she cherishes unity; had it not been for her northern\r\nmountains in a southern clime, she would have long ago forgotten to\r\nthink of _one_ country. But while the Alps are her backbone, she will\r\nalways be at least a vertebrate among nations, and one of the higher\r\norder. Without the Alps she would soon be eaten up by the cancer of\r\nstates' rights. It is the North, too, which will supply the great\r\nuniting power of America, and keep alive a love for the great national\r\nname.\r\n\r\nVery different is the rest--and yet it has too the domestic home-tone of\r\nthe North. In Sweden, in Germany, in America, in England, the family tie\r\nis somewhat other than in the East or in any warm country. With us, old\r\nage is not so ever-neglected and little honored as in softer climes.\r\nThank the fireside for that. The hearth, and the stove, and the long,\r\ncold months which keep the grandsire and granddame in the easy chair by\r\nthe warm corner, make a home centre, where the children linger as long\r\nas they may for stories, and where love lingers, kept alive by many a\r\ncheerful, not to be easily told tie. And it lives--this love--lives in\r\nthe heart of the man after he has gone forth to business or to battle:\r\nhe will not tell you of it, but he remembers grandmother and\r\ngrandfather, as he saw them a boy--the centre of the group, which will\r\nnever form again save in heaven.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to\r\n\r\n     'THE GRANDMOTHER.\r\n\r\n     'Grandmother is very old, has many wrinkles, and perfectly white\r\n     hair; but her eyes gleam like two stars, yes, much more beautiful;\r\n     they are so mild, it does one good to look into them! And then she\r\n     knows how to relate the most beautiful stories. And she has a dress\r\n     embroidered with great, great flowers; it is such a heavy silk\r\n     stuff that it rattles. Grandmother knows a great deal, because she\r\n     has lived much longer than father and mother; that is certain!\r\n     Grandmother has a hymn book with strong silver clasps, and she\r\n     reads very often in the book. In the midst of it lies a rose,\r\n     pressed and dry; it is not so beautiful as the rose which stands in\r\n     the glass, but yet she smiles upon it in the most friendly way;\r\n     indeed, it brings the tears to her eyes! Why does grandmother look\r\n     so at the faded flower in the old book? Do you know? Every time\r\n     that grandmother's tears fall upon the flower, the colors become\r\n     fresh again, the rose swells up and fills the whole room with its\r\n     fragrance, the walls disappear, as if they were only mist, and\r\n     round about her is the green, glorious wood, where the sun beams\r\n     through the leaves of the trees; and grandmother is young again; a\r\n     charming maiden, with full red cheeks, beautiful and innocent--no\r\n     rose is fresher; but the eyes, the mild, blessing eyes, still\r\n     belong to grandmother. At her side sits a young man, large and\r\n     powerful: he reaches her the rose, and she smiles--grandmother does\r\n     not smile so now! oh yes, look now!----But he has vanished: many\r\n     thoughts, many forms sweep past--the beautiful young man is gone,\r\n     the rose lies in the hymn book, and grandmother sits there again as\r\n     an old woman, and looks upon the faded rose which lies in the book.\r\n\r\n     'Now grandmother is dead. She sat in the armchair and related a\r\n     long, beautiful story; she said, 'Now the story is finished, and I\r\n     am tired;' and she leaned her head back, in order to sleep a\r\n     little. We could hear her breathing--she slept; but it became\r\n     stiller and stiller, her face was full of happiness and peace, it\r\n     was as if a sunbeam illumined her features; she smiled again, and\r\n     then the people said, 'She is dead.' She was placed in a black box;\r\n     there she lay covered with white linen; she was very beautiful, and\r\n     yet her eyes were closed, but every wrinkle had vanished; she lay\r\n     there with a smile about her mouth; her hair was silver white,\r\n     venerable, but it did not frighten one to look upon the corpse, for\r\n     it was indeed the dear, kind-hearted grandmother. The hymn book was\r\n     placed under her head--this she had herself desired; the rose lay\r\n     in the old book; and then they buried grandmother.\r\n\r\n     Upon the grave, close by the church wall, a rose tree was planted;\r\n     it was full of roses, and the nightingale flew singing over the\r\n     flowers and the grave. Within the church, there resounded from the\r\n     organ the most beautiful hymns, which were in the old book under\r\n     the head of the dead one. The moon shone down upon the grave, but\r\n     the dead was not there; each child could go there quietly by night\r\n     and pluck a rose from the peaceful courtyard wall. The dead know\r\n     more than all of us living ones; they are better than we. The earth\r\n     is heaped up over the coffin, even within the coffin there is\r\n     earth; the leaves of the hymn book are dust, and the rose, with all\r\n     its memories. But above bloom fresh roses; above, the nightingale\r\n     sings, and the organ tones forth; above, the memory of the old\r\n     grandmother lives, with her mild, ever young eyes. Eyes can never\r\n     die. Ours will one day see the grandmother again, young and\r\n     blooming as when she for the first time kissed the fresh red rose,\r\n     which is now dust in the grave.'\r\n\r\n     'THE CELL PRISON.\r\n\r\n     'By separation from other men, by loneliness, in continual silence\r\n     shall the criminal be punished and benefited; on this account cell\r\n     prisons are built. In Sweden there are many such, and new ones are\r\n     building. I visited for the first time one in Marienstadt. The\r\n     building lies in a beautiful landscape, close by the town, on a\r\n     small stream of water, like a great villa, white and smiling, with\r\n     window upon window. But one soon discovers that the stillness of\r\n     the grave rests over the place; it seems as if no one dwelt here,\r\n     or as if it were a dwelling forsaken during the plague. The gates\r\n     of these walls are locked; but one opened and the jailor received\r\n     us, with his bundle of keys in his hand. The court is empty and\r\n     clean; even the grass between the paving stones is weeded out. We\r\n     entered the 'reception room,' to which the prisoner is first taken;\r\n     then the bath room, whither he is carried next. We ascend a flight\r\n     of stairs, and find ourselves in a large hall, built the whole\r\n     length and height of the building. Several galleries, one over\r\n     another in the different stories, extend round the whole hall, and\r\n     in the midst of the hall is the chancel, from which, on Sundays,\r\n     the preacher delivers his sermon before an invisible audience. All\r\n     the doors of the cells, which lead upon the galleries, are half\r\n     opened, the prisoners hear the preacher, but they cannot see him,\r\n     nor he them. The whole is a well-built machine for a pressure of\r\n     the spirit. In the door of each cell there is a glass of the size\r\n     of an eye; a valve covers it on the outside, and through this may\r\n     the warden, unnoticed by the prisoners, observe all which is going\r\n     on within; but he must move with soft step, noiselessly, for the\r\n     hearing of the prisoner is wonderfully sharpened by solitude. I\r\n     removed the valve from the glass very softly, and looked into the\r\n     closed room--for a moment the glance of the prisoner met my eye. It\r\n     is airy, pure, and clean within, but the window is so high that it\r\n     is impossible to look out. The whole furniture consists of a high\r\n     bench, made fast to a kind of table, a berth, which can be fastened\r\n     with hooks to the ceiling, and around which there is a curtain.\r\n     Several cells were opened to us. In one there was a young, very\r\n     pretty maiden; she had lain down in her berth, but sprang out when\r\n     the door was opened, and her first movement disturbed the berth,\r\n     which it unclasped and rolled together. Upon the little table stood\r\n     the water cask, and near it lay the remains of hard black bread,\r\n     farther off the Bible, and a few spiritual songs. In another cell\r\n     sat an infanticide; I saw her only through the small glass of the\r\n     door, she had heard our steps, and our talking, but she sat still,\r\n     cowered together in the corner by the door, as if she wished to\r\n     conceal herself as much as she could; her back was bent, her head\r\n     sunk almost into her lap, and over it her hands were folded. The\r\n     unhappy one is very young, said they. In two different cells sat\r\n     two brothers; they were paying the penalty of horse-stealing; one\r\n     was yet a boy. In one cell sat a poor servant girl; they said she\r\n     had no relations, and was poor, and they placed her here. I thought\r\n     that I had misunderstood, repeated my question, Why is the maiden\r\n     here? and received the same answer. Yet still I prefer to believe\r\n     that I have misunderstood the remark. Without, in the clear, free\r\n     sunlight, is the busy rush of day; here within the stillness of\r\n     midnight always reigns. The spider, which spins along the wall, the\r\n     swallow, which rarely flies near the vaulted window there above,\r\n     even the tread of the stranger in the gallery, close by the door,\r\n     is an occurrence in this mute, solitary life, where the mind of the\r\n     prisoner revolves ever upon himself. One should read of the martyr\r\n     cells of the holy inquisition, of the unfortunates of the Bagnio\r\n     chained to each other, of the hot leaden chambers, and the dark wet\r\n     abyss of the pit of Venice, and shudder over those pictures, in\r\n     order to wander through the galleries of the cell prison with a\r\n     calmer heart; here is light, here is air, here it is more human.\r\n     Here, where the sunbeam throws in upon the prisoner its mild light,\r\n     here will an illuminating beam from God Himself sink into the\r\n     heart.'\r\n\r\nLast we have\r\n\r\n     'SALA.\r\n\r\n     'Sweden's great king, Germany's deliverer, Gustavus Adolphus,\r\n     caused Sala to be built. The small enclosed wood in the vicinity of\r\n     the little town relates to us yet traditions of the youthful love\r\n     of the hero king, of his rendezvous with Ebba Brahe. The silver\r\n     shafts at Sala are the largest, the deepest and oldest in Sweden;\r\n     they reach down a hundred and seventy fathoms, almost as deep as\r\n     the Baltic. This is sufficient to awaken an interest in the little\r\n     town; how does it look now? 'Sala,' says the guide book, 'lies in a\r\n     valley, in a flat, and not very agreeable region.' And so it is\r\n     truly; in that direction was nothing beautiful, and the highway led\r\n     directly into the town, which has no character. It consists of a\r\n     single long street with a knot and a pair of ends: the knot is the\r\n     market; at the ends are two lanes which are attached to it. The\r\n     long street--it may be called long in such a short town--was\r\n     entirely empty. No one came out of the doors, no one looked out of\r\n     the windows. It was with no small joy that I saw a man, at last, in\r\n     a shop, in whose window hung a paper of pins, a red handkerchief,\r\n     and two tea cans, a solitary, sedate apprentice, who leaned over\r\n     the counter and looked out through the open house door. He\r\n     certainly wrote that evening in his journal, if he kept one;\r\n     'To-day a traveller went through the town; the dear God may know\r\n     him, I do not!' The apprentice's face appeared to me to say all\r\n     that, and he had an honest face.\r\n\r\n     'In the tavern in which I entered, the same deathlike stillness\r\n     reigned as upon the street. The door was indeed closed, but in the\r\n     interior of the house all the doors stood wide open; the house cock\r\n     stood in the midst of the sitting room, and crowed in order to give\r\n     information that there was some one in the house. As to the rest,\r\n     the house was entirely picturesque; it had an open balcony looking\r\n     out upon the court--upon the street would have been too lively. The\r\n     old sign hung over the door and creaked in the wind; it sounded as\r\n     if it were alive. I saw it from my window; I saw also how the grass\r\n     had overgrown the pavement of the street. The sun shone clear, but\r\n     as it shines in the sitting room of the solitary old bachelor and\r\n     upon the balsam in the pot of the old maid, it was still as on a\r\n     Scottish Sunday, and it was Tuesday! I felt myself drawn to study\r\n     Young's 'Night Thoughts.'\r\n\r\n     'I looked down from the balcony into the neighbor's court; no\r\n     living being was to be seen, but children had played there; they\r\n     had built a little garden out of perfectly dry twigs; these had\r\n     been stuck into the soft earth and watered; the potsherd, which\r\n     served as watering pot, lay there still; the twigs represented\r\n     roses and geranium. It had been a splendid garden--ah yes! We\r\n     great, grown-up men play just so, build us a garden with love's\r\n     roses and friendship's geranium, we water it with our tears and our\r\n     heart's blood--and yet they are and remain dry twigs without roots.\r\n     That was a gloomy thought--I felt it, and in order to transform the\r\n     dry twigs into a blossoming Aaron's-staff, I went out. I went out\r\n     into the ends and into the long thread, that is to say, into the\r\n     little lanes and into the great street, and here was more life, as\r\n     I might have expected; a herd of cows met me, who were coming home,\r\n     or going away, I know not--they had no leader. The apprentice was\r\n     still standing behind the counter; he bowed over it and greeted;\r\n     the stranger took off his hat in return; these were the events of\r\n     this day in Sala. Pardon me, thou still town, which Gustavus\r\n     Adolphus built, where his young heart glowed in its first love, and\r\n     where the silver rests in the deep shafts without the town, in a\r\n     flat and not very pleasant country. I knew no one in this town, no\r\n     one conducted me about, and so I went with the cows, and reached\r\n     the graveyard; the cows went on, I climbed over the fence, and\r\n     found myself between the graves, where the green grass grew, and\r\n     nearly all the tombstones lay with inscriptions blotted out; only\r\n     here and there, 'Anno' was still legible--what further? And who\r\n     rests here? Everything on the stone was effaced, as the earth life\r\n     of the one who was now earth within the earth. What drama have ye\r\n     dead ones played here in the still Sala? The setting sun threw its\r\n     beams over the graves, no leaf stirred on the tree; all was still,\r\n     deathly still, in the town of the silver mines, which for the\r\n     remembrance of the traveller is only a frame about the apprentice,\r\n     who bowed greeting over the counter.'\r\n\r\nSilence, stillness, quiet, solitude, loneliness, far-away-ness; hushed,\r\ncalm, remote, out of the world, un-newspapered, operaless,\r\nun-gossipped--was there ever a sketch which carried one so far from the\r\nworld as this of 'Sala'? That _one_ shopboy--those going or coming\r\ncows--the tombs, with wornout dates, every point of time vanishing--a\r\nliving grave!\r\n\r\nContrast again, dear reader. Verily she is a goddess--and I adore her.\r\nLo! she brings me back again in Sala to the busy streets of this city,\r\nand the office, and the 'exchanges,' and the rustling, bustling world,\r\nand the hotel dinner--to be in time for which I am even now writing\r\nagainst time--and I am thankful for it all. Sala has cured me. That\r\npicture drives away longings. Verily, he who lives in America, and in\r\nits great roaring current of events, needs but a glance at Sala to feel\r\nthat _here_ he is on a darting stream ever hurrying more gloriously into\r\nthe world and away from the dull inanity--which the merest sibilant of\r\naggravation will change to insanity.\r\n\r\nReader, our Andersen is an artist--as most children know. But I am glad\r\nthat he seldom gives us anything which is so _very_ much of a monochrome\r\nas Sala.\r\n\r\nI wonder if Sala was the native and surnaming town of that _other_ Sala\r\nwhose initials are G. A. S., and whose nature is 'ditto'? Did its\r\ndulness drive him to liveliness, even as an 'orthodox' training is said\r\nto drive youth to dissipation? It may be so. The one hath a deep mine of\r\nsilver--the other contains inexhaustible mines of brass--and the name of\r\nthe one as of the other, when read in Hebrew-wise gives us 'alas!'\r\n\r\nBut I am wandering from the Northern pictures and fresh nature, and must\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW RASSELAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n... And Joseph, opening the drawing room, told me the postchaise was\r\nready. My mother and my sister threw themselves into my arms.\r\n\r\n'It is still time,' said they, 'to abandon this scheme. Stay with us.'\r\n\r\n'Mother, I am of noble birth, I am now twenty, I must have a name, I\r\nmust be talked about in the country, I must be getting a position in the\r\narmy or at court.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! but, Bernard, when you have gone, what will become of me?'\r\n\r\n'You will be happy and proud when you hear of your son's success.'\r\n\r\n'But if you are killed in some battle?'\r\n\r\n'What of that! What's life? Who thinks about being killed? When one is\r\ntwenty, and of noble lineage, he thinks of nothing but glory. And,\r\nmother, in a few years you shall see me return to your side a colonel,\r\nor a general, or with some rich office at Versailles.'\r\n\r\n'Well, and what then?'\r\n\r\n'Why, then I shall be respected and considered about here.'\r\n\r\n'And then?'\r\n\r\n'Why, everybody will take off their hat to me.'\r\n\r\n'And then?'\r\n\r\n'I'll marry Cousin Henrietta, and I'll marry off my young sisters, and\r\nwe'll all live together with you, tranquil and happy, on my estate in\r\nBrittany.'\r\n\r\n'Now, why can't you commence this tranquil and happy life to-day? Has\r\nnot your father left us the largest fortune of all the province? Is\r\nthere anywhere near us a richer estate or a finer chateau than that of\r\nLa Roche Bernard? Are you not considered by all your vassals? Doesn't\r\neverybody take off their hat when they meet you? No, don't quit us, my\r\ndear child; remain with your friends, with your sisters, with your old\r\nmother, whom, at your return, perhaps you may not find alive; do not\r\nexpend in vain glory, nor abridge by cares and annoyances of every kind,\r\ndays which at the best pass away too rapidly: life is a pleasant thing,\r\nmy son, and Brittany's sun is genial!'\r\n\r\nAs she said this, she showed me from the drawing-room windows the\r\nbeautiful avenues of my park, the old horse-chestnuts in bloom, the\r\nlilacs, the honeysuckles, whose fragrance filled the air, and whose\r\nverdure glistened in the sun. In the antechamber was the gardener and\r\nall his family, who, sad and silent, seemed also to say to me, 'Don't\r\ngo, young master, don't go.' Hortense, my eldest sister, pressed me in\r\nher arms, and Amélie, my little sister, who was in a corner of the\r\ndrawing room looking at the pictures in a volume of La Fontaine, came up\r\nto me, holding out the book:\r\n\r\n'Read, read, brother,' said she, weeping....\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the fable of the Two Pigeons!... I suddenly got up, and\r\nrepelled them all. 'I am now twenty, I am of noble blood, I want glory\r\nand honor.... Let me go.' And I ran toward the courtyard. I was about\r\ngetting into the postchaise, when a woman appeared on the staircase.\r\nIt was Henrietta! She did not weep ... she did not say a word ... but,\r\npale and trembling, it was with the utmost difficulty that she kept from\r\nfalling. She waved the white handkerchief she held in her hand, as a\r\nlast good-by, and she fell senseless on the floor. I ran and took her\r\nup, I pressed her in my arms, I pledged my love to her for life; and as\r\nshe recovered consciousness, leaving her in the hands of my mother and\r\nsister, I ran to my postchaise without stopping, and without turning my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIf I had looked at Henrietta, I should not have gone.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments afterward the postchaise was rattling along the\r\nhighway. For a long time my mind was completely absorbed by thoughts of\r\nmy sisters, of Henrietta, of my mother, and of all the happiness I left\r\nbehind me; but these ideas gradually quitted me as I lost sight of the\r\nturrets of La Roche Bernard, and dreams of ambition and of glory took\r\nthe entire possession of my mind. What schemes! What castles in the air!\r\nWhat noble actions I performed in my postchaise!! I denied myself\r\nnothing: wealth, honors, dignities, success of every kind, I merited and\r\nI awarded myself all; at the last, raising myself from grade to grade as\r\nI advanced on my journey, by the time I reached my inn at night, I was\r\nduke and peer, governor of a province, and marshal of France. The voice\r\nof my servant, who called me modestly Monsieur le Chevalier, alone\r\nforced me to remember who I was, and to abdicate all my dignities. The\r\nnext day, and the following days, I indulged in the same dreams, and\r\nenjoyed the same intoxication, for my journey was long. I was going to a\r\nchateau near Sedan the chateau of the Duke de C----, an old friend of my\r\nfather, and protector of my family. It was understood that he was to\r\ncarry me to Paris with him, where he was expected about the end of the\r\nmonth; he promised to present me at Versailles, and to give me a company\r\nof dragoons through the credit of his sister, the Marchioness de F----,\r\na charming young lady, designated by public opinion as Madame de\r\nPompadour's successor, whose title she claimed with the greater justice\r\nas she had long filled its honorable functions. I reached Sedan at\r\nnight, and at too late an hour to go to the chateau of my protector. I\r\ntherefore postponed my visit until the nest day, and lay at the\r\n'France's Arms,' the best hotel of the town, and the ordinary rendezvous\r\nof all the officers; for Sedan is a garrison town, and is well\r\nfortified; the streets have a warlike air, and even the shopkeepers have\r\na martial look, which seems to say to strangers, 'We are fellow\r\ncountrymen of the great Turenne!' I supped at the general table, and I\r\nasked what road I should take in the morning to go to the chateau of the\r\nDuke de C----, which is situated some three leagues out of the town.\r\n'Anybody will show you,' I was told, 'for it is well known hereabouts:\r\nMarshal Fabert, a great warrior and a celebrated man, died there.'\r\nThereupon the conversation turned about Marshal Fabert. Between young\r\nsoldiers, this was very natural; his battles, his exploits, his modesty,\r\nwhich made him refuse the letters patent of nobility and the collar of\r\nhis orders offered him by Louis XIV, were all talked about; they dwelt\r\nespecially on the inconceivable fortune which had raised him from the\r\nrank of a simple soldier to the rank of a marshal of France--him, who\r\nwas nothing at all, the son of a mere printer: it was the only example\r\nof such a piece of fortune which could then be instanced, and which,\r\neven during Fabert's life, had appeared so extraordinary, the vulgar\r\nnever feared to ascribe his elevation to supernatural causes. It was\r\nsaid that from his youth he had busied himself with magic and sorcery,\r\nand that he had made a league with the devil. Mine host, who, to the\r\nstupidity inherent in all the natives of the province of Champagne,\r\nadded the credulity of our Brittany peasants, assured us with a great\r\ndeal of sangfroid, that when Fabert died in the chateau of the Duke de\r\nC----, a black man, whom nobody knew, was seen to enter into the dead\r\nman's room, and disappear, taking with him the marshal's soul, which he\r\nhad bought, and which belonged to him; and that even now, every May,\r\nabout the period of the death of Fabert, the people of the chateau saw\r\nthe black man about the house, bearing a small light. This story made\r\nour dessert merry, and we drank a bottle of champagne to the demon of\r\nFabert, craving it to be good enough to take us also under its\r\nprotection, and enable us to win some battles like those of Collioure\r\nand La Marfee.\r\n\r\nI rose early the next morning, and went to the chateau of the Duke de\r\nC----, an immense gothic manor-house, which perhaps at any other moment\r\nI would not have noticed, but which I regarded, I acknowledge, with\r\ncuriosity mixed with emotion, as I recollected the story told us on the\r\npreceding evening by the host of the 'France's Arms.' The servant to\r\nwhom I spoke, told me he did not know whether his master could receive\r\ncompany, and whether he could receive me. I gave him my name, and he\r\nwent out, leaving me alone in a sort of armory, decorated with the\r\nattributes of the chase and family portraits.\r\n\r\nI waited some time, and no one came. 'The career of glory and of honor I\r\nhave dreamed commences by the antechamber,' said I to myself, and\r\nimpatience soon possessed the discontented solicitor. I had counted over\r\nthe family portraits and all the rafters of the ceiling some two or\r\nthree times, when I heard a slight noise in the wooden wainscoting. It\r\nwas caused by an ill-closed door the wind had forced open. I looked in,\r\nand I perceived a very handsome boudoir, lighted by two large windows\r\nand a glazed door opening on a magnificent park. I walked into this\r\nroom, and after I had gone a short distance, I was stopped by a scene\r\nwhich I had not at first perceived. A man was lying on a sofa, with his\r\nback turned to the door by which I came in. He got up, and without\r\nperceiving me, ran abruptly to the window. Tears streamed down his\r\ncheeks, and a profound despair was marked on his every feature. He\r\nremained motionless for some time, keeping his face buried in his hands;\r\nthen he began striding rapidly about the room. I was then near him; he\r\nperceived me, and trembled; I, too, was annoyed and confounded at my\r\nindiscretion; I sought to retire, muttering some words of excuse.\r\n\r\n'Who are you? What do you want?' he said to me in a loud voice, taking\r\nhold of me by my arms.\r\n\r\n'I am the Chevalier Bernard de la Roche Bernard, and I come from\r\nBrittany.'...\r\n\r\n'I know, I know,' said he; and he threw himself into my arms, made me\r\ntake a seat by his side, spoke to me warmly about my father and all my\r\nfamily, whom he knew so well that I was persuaded I was talking with the\r\nmaster of the chateau.\r\n\r\n'You are Monsieur de C----?' I asked him.\r\n\r\nHe got up, looked at me wildly, and replied, 'I was he, I am he no\r\nlonger, I am nothing;' and seeing my astonishment, he exclaimed, 'Not a\r\nword more, young man, don't question me!'\r\n\r\n'I must, Monsieur; I have been the involuntary witness of your chagrin\r\nand your grief, and if my attachment and my friendship may to some\r\ndegree alleviate'----\r\n\r\n'You are right, you are right,' said he; 'you cannot change my fate, but\r\nat the least you may receive my last wishes and my last injunctions ...\r\nit is the only favor I ask of you.'\r\n\r\nHe shut the door, and again took his seat by my side; I was touched, and\r\ntremblingly expected what he was going to say: he spoke with a grave and\r\nsolemn manner. His physiognomy had an expression I had never seen before\r\non any face. His forehead, which I attentively examined, seemed marked\r\nby fatality; his face was pale; his black eyes sparkled, and\r\noccasionally his features, although changed by pain, would contract in\r\nan ironical and infernal smile. 'What I am going to tell you,' said he,\r\n'will surprise you.' You will doubt me ... you will not believe me ...\r\neven. I doubt it sometimes ... at the least, I would like to doubt it;\r\nbut I have got the proofs of it; and there is in everything around us,\r\nin our very organization, a great many other mysteries which we are\r\nobliged to undergo, without being able to understand.' He remained\r\nsilent for a moment, as if to collect his ideas, brushed his forehead\r\nwith his hand, and then proceeded:\r\n\r\n'I was born in this chateau. I had two elder brothers, to whom the\r\nhonors and the estates of our house were to descend. I could hope\r\nnothing above the cassock of an abbé, and yet dreams of ambition and of\r\nglory fermented in my head, and quickened the beatings of my heart.\r\nDiscontented with my obscurity, eager for fame, I thought of nothing but\r\nthe means of acquiring it, and this idea made me insensible to all the\r\npleasures and all the joys of life. The present was nothing to me; I\r\nexisted only in the future; and that future lay before me robed in the\r\nmost sombre colors. I was nearly thirty years old, and had done nothing.\r\nThen literary reputations arose from every side in Paris, and their\r\nbrilliancy was reflected even to our distant province. 'Ah!' I often\r\nsaid to myself, 'if I could at the least command a name in the world of\r\nletters! that at least would be fame, and fame is happiness.' The\r\nconfidant of my sorrow was an old servant, an aged negro, who had lived\r\nin the chateau for years before I was born; he was the oldest person\r\nabout the house, for no one remembered when he came to live there; and\r\nsome of the country people said that he knew the Marshal Fabert, and had\r\nbeen present at his death'--\r\n\r\nMy host saw me express the greatest surprise; he interrupted his\r\nnarrative to ask me what was the matter.\r\n\r\n'Nothing,' said I; but I could not help thinking of the black man the\r\ninnkeeper had mentioned the evening before.\r\n\r\nMonsieur de C---- went on with his story: 'One day, before Juba (such\r\nwas the negro's name), I loudly expressed my despair at my obscurity and\r\nthe uselessness of my life, and I exclaimed: '_I would give ten years of\r\nmy life_ to be placed in the first rank of our authors.' 'Ten years,' he\r\ncoldly replied to me, 'are a great deal; it's paying dearly for a\r\ntrifle; but that's nothing, I accept your ten years. I take them now;\r\nremember your promises: I shall keep mine!' I cannot depict to you my\r\nsurprise at hearing him speak in this way. I thought years had weakened\r\nhis reason; I smiled, and he shrugged his shoulders, and in a few days\r\nafterward I quitted the chateau to pay a visit to Paris. There I was\r\nthrown a great deal in literary society. Their example encouraged me,\r\nand I published several works, whose success I shall not weary you by\r\ndescribing. All Paris applauded me; the newspapers proclaimed my\r\npraises; the new name I had assumed became celebrated, and no later than\r\nyesterday, you, yourself, my young friend, admired me.'\r\n\r\nA new gesture of surprise again interrupted his narrative: 'What! you\r\nare not the Duke de C----?' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n'No,' said he very coldly.\r\n\r\n'And,' I said to myself, 'a celebrated literary man! Is it Marmontel? or\r\nD'Alembert? or Voltaire?'\r\n\r\nHe sighed; a smile of regret and of contempt flitted over his lips, and\r\nhe resumed his story: 'This literary reputation I had desired soon\r\nbecame insufficient for a soul as ardent as my own. I longed for nobler\r\nsuccess, and I said to Juba, who had followed me to Paris, and who now\r\nremained with me: 'There is no real glory, no true fame, but that\r\nacquired in the profession of arms. What is a literary man? A poet?\r\nNothing. But a great captain, a leader of an army! Ah! that's the\r\ndestiny I desire; and for a great military reputation, I would give\r\nanother ten years of my life.' 'I accept them,' Juba replied; 'I take\r\nthem now; don't forget it.''\r\n\r\nAt this part of his story he stopped again, and, observing the trouble\r\nand hesitation visible in my every feature, he said:\r\n\r\n'I warned you beforehand, young man, that you could not believe me; this\r\nseems a dream, a chimera to you!... and to me, too!... and yet the\r\ngrades and the honors I obtained were no illusions; those soldiers I led\r\nto the cannon's mouth, those redoubts stormed, those flags won, those\r\nvictories with which all France has rung ... all that was my work ...\r\nall that glory was mine.'...\r\n\r\nWhile he strode up and down the room, and spoke with this warmth and\r\nenthusiasm, surprise chilled my blood, and I said to myself, 'Who can\r\nthis gentleman be?... Is he Coligny?... Richelieu?... the Marshal\r\nSaxe?'...\r\n\r\nFrom this state of excitement he had fallen into great depression, and\r\ncoming close to me, he said to me, with a sombre air:\r\n\r\n'Juba spoke truly; and after a short time had passed away, disgusted\r\nwith this vain bubble of military glory, I longed for the only thing\r\nreal and satisfactory and permanent in this world; and when, at the cost\r\nof five or six years of life, I desired gold and wealth, Juba gave them\r\ntoo.... Yes, my young friend, yes, I have seen fortune surpass all my\r\ndesires; I became the lord of estates, of forests, of chateaux. Up to\r\nthis morning they were all mine; if you don't believe me, if you don't\r\nbelieve Juba ... wait ... wait ... he is coming ... and you will see for\r\nyourself, with your own eyes, that what confounds your reason and mine,\r\nis unhappily but too real.'\r\n\r\nHe then walked toward the mantlepiece, looked at the clock, exhibited\r\ngreat alarm, and said to me in a whisper:\r\n\r\n'This morning at daybreak I felt so depressed and weak I could scarcely\r\nget up. I rang for my servant. Juba came. 'What is the matter with me\r\nthis morning?' I asked him. 'Master, nothing more than natural. The hour\r\napproaches, the moment draws near!' 'What hour? What moment?' 'Don't you\r\nremember? Heaven allotted sixty years as the term of your existence. You\r\nwere thirty when I began to obey you!' 'Juba,' said I, seriously\r\nalarmed, 'are you in earnest?' 'Yes, master; in five years you have\r\ndissipated in glory twenty-five years of life. You gave them to me, they\r\nbelong to me; and those years you bartered away shall now be added to\r\nthe days I have to live.' 'What, was that the price of your services?'\r\n'Others have paid more dearly for them. You have heard of Fabert: I\r\nprotected him.' 'Silence! silence!' I said to him; 'you lie! you lie!'\r\n'As you please; but get ready, you have only half an hour to live.' 'You\r\nare mocking me; you deceive me.' 'Not at all; make the calculation\r\nyourself. You have really lived thirty-five years; you have lost\r\ntwenty-five years: total, sixty years.' He started to go out.... I felt\r\nmy strength diminishing; I felt my life waning away. 'Juba! Juba!' said\r\nI, 'give me a few hours, only a few hours,' I screamed; 'oh! give me a\r\nfew hours longer!' 'No, no,' said he, 'that would be to diminish my own\r\nlife, and I know better than you the value of life. There is no treasure\r\nin this world worth two hours' existence!' I could scarcely speak; my\r\neyes became obscured by a thick veil, the icy hand of death began to\r\nfreeze my veins. 'Oh!' said I, making an effort to speak, 'take back\r\nthose estates for which I have sacrificed everything. Give me four hours\r\nlonger, and I make you master of all my gold, of all my wealth, of all\r\nthat opulence of fortune I have so earnestly desired.' 'Agreed: you have\r\nbeen a good master, and I am willing to do something for you; I consent\r\nto your prayer.' I felt my strength return; and I exclaimed: 'Four hours\r\nare so little ... oh! Juba! ... Juba ... oh! Juba! give me yet four\r\nhours, and I renounce all my literary glory, all my works, everything\r\nthat has placed me so high in the opinion of the world.' 'Four hours of\r\nlife for that!' exclaimed the negro with contempt.... 'That's a great\r\ndeal; but never mind; you shan't say I refused your last dying request.'\r\n'Oh! no! no! Juba, don't say my last dying request.... Juba! Juba! I beg\r\nof you, give me until this evening, give me twelve hours, the whole day,\r\nand may my exploits, my victories, my military fame, my whole career be\r\nforever effaced from the memory of men!... may nothing whatever remain\r\nof them!... if you will give me this day, only to-day, Juba; and I shall\r\nbe too well satisfied.' 'You abuse my generosity,' said he, 'and I am\r\nmaking a fool's bargain. But never mind, I give you until sundown. After\r\nthat, ask me for nothing more. Don't forget, after sundown I shall come\r\nfor you!'\r\n\r\n'He went away,' added my companion, with a tone of despair I can never\r\nforget, 'and this is the last day of my life.' He then walked to the\r\nglazed door looking out on the park (it was open), and he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Oh God! I shall see no more this beautiful sky, these green lawns,\r\nthese sparkling waters; I shall never again breathe the balmy air of the\r\nspring! Madman that I was! I might have enjoyed for twenty-five years to\r\ncome these blessings God has showered on all, blessings whose worth I\r\nknew not, and of which I am beginning to know the value. I have worn out\r\nmy days, I have sacrificed my life for a vain chimera, for a sterile\r\nglory, which has not made me happy, and which died before me.... See!\r\nsee there!' said he, pointing to some peasants plodding their weary way\r\nhomeward; 'what would I not give to share their labors and their\r\npoverty!... But I have nothing to give, nothing to hope here below ...\r\nnothing ... not even misfortune!'... At this moment a sunbeam, a May\r\nsunbeam, lighted up his pale, haggard features; he took me by the arm\r\nwith a sort of delirium, and said to me:\r\n\r\n'See! oh see! how splendid is the sun!... Oh! and I must leave all\r\nthis!... Oh! at the least let me enjoy it now.... Let me taste to the\r\nfull this pure and beautiful day ... whose morrow I shall never see!'\r\n\r\nHe leaped into the park, and, before I could well comprehend what he was\r\ndoing, he had disappeared down an alley. But, to speak truly, I could\r\nnot have restrained him, even if I would.... I had not now the strength;\r\nI fell back on the sofa, confounded, stunned, bewildered by all I had\r\nseen and heard. At length I arose and walked about the room to convince\r\nmyself that I was awake, that I was not dreaming, that....\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door of the boudoir opened, and a servant announced:\r\n\r\n'My master, Monsieur le Duc de C----.'\r\n\r\nA gentleman some sixty years old and of a very aristocratic appearance\r\ncame forward, and, taking me by the hand, begged my pardon for having\r\nkept me so long waiting.\r\n\r\n'I was not at the chateau,' said he. 'I have just come from the town,\r\nwhere I have been to consult with the physicians about the health of the\r\nCount de C----, my younger brother.'\r\n\r\n'Is he dangerously ill?'\r\n\r\n'No, monsieur, thank Heaven, he is not; but in his youth visions of\r\nglory and of ambition had excited his imagination, and a grave fever,\r\nfrom which he has just recovered, and which came near proving fatal, has\r\nleft his head in a state of delirium and insanity, which persuades him\r\nthat he has only one day longer to live. That's his madness.'\r\n\r\nEverything was explained to me now!\r\n\r\n'Come, my young friend, now let us talk over your business; tell me what\r\nI can do for your advancement. We will go together to Versailles about\r\nthe end of this month. I will present you at court.'\r\n\r\n'I know how kind you are to me, duke, and I have come here to thank you\r\nfor it.'\r\n\r\n'What! have you renounced going to court, and to the advantages you may\r\nreckon on having there?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'But recollect, that aided by me, you will make a rapid progress, and\r\nthat with a little assiduity and patience ... say in ten years.'\r\n\r\n'They would be ten years lost!'\r\n\r\n'What!' exclaimed the duke with astonishment, 'is that purchasing too\r\ndearly glory, fortune, and fame?... Silence, my young friend, we will go\r\ntogether to Versailles.'\r\n\r\n'No, duke, I return to Brittany, and I beg you to accept my thanks and\r\nthose of my family for your kindness.'\r\n\r\n'You are mad!' said the duke.\r\n\r\nBut thinking over what I had heard and seen, I said to myself: 'You are\r\nthe same!'\r\n\r\nThe next morning I turned my face homeward. With what pleasure I saw\r\nagain my fine chateau de la Roche Bernard, the old trees of my park, and\r\nthe beautiful sun of Brittany! I found again my vassals, my sisters, my\r\nmother, and happiness, which has never quitted me since, for eight days\r\nafterward I married Henrietta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAINED RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Home I love, I now must leave thee! Home I love, I now must go\r\n  Far away, although it grieve me, through the valley, through the snow.\r\n\r\n  By the night and through the valley, though the hail against us flies,\r\n  Till we reach the frozen river--on its bank the foeman lies.\r\n\r\n  Frozen river, mighty river!--wilt thou e'er again be free\r\n  From the fountain through the mountain, from the mountain to the sea.\r\n\r\n  Yes; though Freedom's glorious river for a time be frozen fast,\r\n  Still it cannot hold forever--Winter's reign will soon be past.\r\n\r\n  Still it runs, although 'tis frozen--on beneath the icy plain,\r\n  From the mountain to the ocean--free as thought, though held in chain.\r\n\r\n  From the mountain to the ocean, from the ocean to the sky,\r\n  Then in rainy drops returning--lo the ice-chains burst and fly!\r\n\r\n  And the ice makes great the river. Breast the spring-flood if you dare!\r\n  Rivers run though ice be o'er them--GOD and Freedom everywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE WAR AFFECTS AMERICANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the present terrible civil war, the condition of the\r\nAmerican people was apparently enviable beyond that of any other nation.\r\nWe say apparently, because the seeds of the rebellion had long been\r\ngerminating; and, to a philosophic eye, the great change destined to\r\nfollow the rebellion was inevitable, though it was then impossible for\r\nhuman foresight to predict the steps by which that change would come.\r\nUnconscious of impending calamity, we were proud of our position and\r\ncharacter as American citizens. We were free from oppressive taxation,\r\nand enjoyed unbounded liberty of speech and action. Revelling in the\r\nfertility of a virgin continent, unexampled in modern times for the\r\nfacilities of cultivation and the richness of its return to human labor,\r\nit was a national characteristic to felicitate ourselves upon the\r\ngeneral prosperity, and boastingly to compare our growing resources and\r\nour unlimited and almost spontaneous abundance, with the hard-earned and\r\ndearly purchased productions of other and more exhausted countries. Our\r\npopulation, swollen by streams of immigration from the crowded\r\ncontinents of the old world, has spread over the boundless plains of\r\nthis, with amazing rapidity; and the physical improvements which have\r\nfollowed our wonderful expansion have been truly magical in their\r\nresults, as shown by the decennial exhibits of the census, or presented\r\nin still more palpable form to the eye of the thoughtful and observant\r\ntraveller. Since the fall of the Roman empire, no single government has\r\npossessed so magnificent a domain in the temperate regions of the globe;\r\nand certainly, no other people so numerous, intelligent, and powerful,\r\nhas ever in any age of the world enjoyed the same unrestricted freedom\r\nin the pursuit of happiness: accordingly, none has ever exhibited the\r\nsame extraordinary activity in enterprise, or equal success in the\r\ncreation and accumulation of wealth. It was unfortunately true that our\r\nmighty energies were mostly employed in the production of physical\r\nresults; and although our youthful, vigorous, and unrestricted efforts\r\nmade these results truly marvellous, yet the moral and intellectual\r\nbasis on which we built was not sufficiently broad and stable to sustain\r\nthe vast superstructure of our prosperity. The foundations having been\r\nseriously disturbed, it becomes indispensable to look to their permanent\r\nsecurity, whatever may be the temporary inconvenience arising from the\r\nnecessary destruction of portions of the old fabric.\r\n\r\nWhen the war began, the South was supplying the world with cotton--a\r\nstaple which in modern times has become intimately connected with the\r\nphysical well-being of the whole civilized world. At the same time, the\r\nNorthwest was furnishing to all nations immense quantities of grain and\r\nanimal food, her teeming fields presenting a sure resource against the\r\nuncertainty of seasons in those regions of the earth in which capital\r\nmust supply the fertility which is still inexhaustible here. While such\r\nwere the occupations of the South and the West, the North and East were\r\nadvancing in the path of mechanical and commercial improvement, with a\r\nrapidity beyond all former example. Agricultural and manufacturing\r\ninventions were springing up, full grown, out of the teeming brain of\r\nthe Yankees, and were fast altering the face of the world. New\r\ncombinations of natural forces were appearing as the agents of the human\r\nwill, and were multiplying the physical capacity of man in a ratio that\r\nseemed to know no bounds. Commercial enterprise kept pace with these\r\nmagnificent creations, and never failed, with liberal and enlightened\r\nspirit, to avail itself of all the resources which industry produced or\r\ngenius invented. Our tonnage surpassed that of the greatest nations; the\r\nskill of our shipbuilders was unsurpassed; and the courage, industry,\r\nand perseverance of our seamen were renowned all over the world. On\r\nevery ocean and in every important harbor of the earth were daily\r\nvisible the emblems of our national power and the evidences of our\r\nindividual prosperity. But in one fatal moment, from a cause which was\r\ninherent in our moral and political condition, all this prodigious\r\nactivity of thought and work was brought to a complete stand. Such a\r\nshock was never before experienced, because such a social and material\r\nmomentum had never before been acquired by any nation, and then been\r\narrested by so gigantic a calamity. It was as if the earth had been\r\nsuddenly stopped on its axis, and all things on its surface had felt the\r\ndestructive impulse of the centrifugal force.\r\n\r\nWar itself is, unhappily, no uncommon condition of mankind. Wars on a\r\ngigantic scale have often heretofore raged among the great nations, or\r\neven between sundered parts of the same people. It is not the magnitude\r\nof the present contest which constitutes its greatest peculiarity. It is\r\nrather the magnitude and importance of the interests it involves and the\r\nrelations it sunders, which give it the tremendous significance it bears\r\nin the eyes of the world. Never has any war found the contending parties\r\nengaged in works of such world-wide and absorbing interest, as those\r\nwhich occupied both sections of our people at the commencement of this\r\nrebellion. No two people, connected by so many ties, enjoying such\r\nunlimited freedom of intercourse, so mutually dependent each upon the\r\nother, and occupying a country so utterly incapable of natural\r\ndivisions, have ever been known to struggle with each other in so\r\nsanguinary a conflict. All the circumstances of the case have been\r\nunexampled in history. Accordingly the influence of the contest upon\r\naffairs on this continent, and indeed upon human affairs generally, has\r\nbeen great and disastrous in proportion to the magnitude of the peaceful\r\nworks which have been suspended by it, and to the closeness of those\r\nbrotherly relations which have heretofore existed between the contending\r\nparties, now violently broken, and perhaps forever destroyed.\r\n\r\nAlmost the entire industry and commerce of the United States have been\r\ndiverted into new and unaccustomed channels. The most active and\r\nenterprising people in the world, in the midst of their varied\r\noccupations, suddenly find all the accustomed channels of business\r\nblocked up and the stream of their productions flowing back upon them in\r\na disastrous flood, and stagnating in their workshops and storehouses.\r\nThey are compelled to find new issues for their enterprise and to make a\r\ncomplete change in their habits and works. It is not merely in the\r\ncessation of all intercourse between the two vast sections, North and\r\nSouth, that this mighty transformation has taken place; but an equal\r\nalteration has been suddenly effected in the character of the business\r\nand the nature of the occupations which the people have heretofore\r\npursued in the loyal States of the Union. Great branches of business,\r\nemploying millions of capital, have been utterly annihilated or\r\nindefinitely suspended. Vast amounts of capital have been sunk and\r\nutterly lost in the deep gulf of separation which temporarily divides\r\nthe States; or if they are ever to be recovered, it will be only after\r\nthe storm shall have completely subsided, when some portions of the\r\nwrecks, which have been scattered in the fearful commotion, may be\r\nthrown safely on to the shores of reunion. It was anticipated,\r\nespecially by the rebels themselves, that these incalculable losses,\r\nthese tremendous shocks and sudden changes, would utterly overwhelm the\r\nNorth with ruin and tear her to pieces with faction and disorder. But\r\nthis anticipation of accumulated disasters, in which the wish was father\r\nto the thought, has not been realized to any appreciable extent. The\r\npecuniary losses have been in a great measure compensated by the immense\r\ndemands of the war; and when faction has attempted to raise its head, it\r\nhas been compelled to retire before the patriotic rebuke of the people.\r\nAnd although the vast expenditures of the war give present relief; by\r\ndrawing largely on the resources of the future, yet the strength we\r\nacquire is none the less real or less effectual in overthrowing the\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nBut this sudden and grand emergency, with all its appalling concomitants\r\nof lives sacrificed, property destroyed, commercial disaster, and social\r\nderangement, has given a rare opportunity for the testing of our\r\nnational character, and of our ability to meet and overcome the most\r\ntremendous difficulties and dangers. Perhaps the versatility of American\r\ngenius and its ready adaptation to the new circumstances, are even more\r\nwonderful than any other exhibition made by our people in this great\r\nnational crisis. There has never been any good reason to doubt the\r\ncapacity of any portion of American citizens for warlike occupations,\r\nnor their possession of the moral qualities necessary to make them good\r\nsoldiers. The long period of peace which has blessed our country, with\r\nthe industrial, educational, and moral improvement produced by it, has\r\nrendered war justly distasteful to the Free States of the Union. They\r\nwere slow to recognize the necessity for it; and nothing but the most\r\nsolemn convictions of duty would have aroused them to the stern and\r\nunanimous determination with which they have entered on the present\r\nstruggle. Swift would have been our degeneration, if the spirit of our\r\nfathers had already died out among us. But our history of less than a\r\ncentury since the Revolutionary war has fully maintained the\r\nself-reliant character of Americans and demonstrated their military\r\nabilities; and if the commercial and manufacturing populations of\r\nparticular sections were supposed to have become somewhat enervated by\r\nlong exemption from the labors and perils of war, it was certain that\r\nour large agricultural regions and especially our frontier settlements\r\nwere peopled with men inured to toil and familiar with danger,\r\nconstituting the best material for armies to be found in any country.\r\nNor was it in fact true that any considerable portion of our people,\r\neven those drawn from the stores and workshops of the cities, had become\r\nso far deteriorated in vigor of body, or demoralized in spirit, as to be\r\nunfit for military service. The Southern leaders looked with scorn upon\r\nour volunteer army only until they encountered it in battle. They were\r\nthen compelled to alter their preconceived opinions of the Yankee\r\ncharacter, and to change their contempt, real or pretended, into\r\nrespect, if not admiration. Even when superior numbers or better\r\nstrategy enabled them to beat us, they have seldom failed to bear\r\nhonorable testimony to the unflinching courage and endurance of our\r\ntroops. Nor do we need the admissions of the enemy to establish this\r\ncharacter for us; our own triumphs, on many glorious fields, are the\r\nbest evidences of our ability in war, and of themselves sufficiently\r\nattest the valor and energy of our noble volunteers. In this aspect of\r\nthe matter, we must not forget the peculiar character and constitution\r\nof our vast army. It is indeed worthy to be called the wonder of the\r\nworld. It is virtually a voluntary association of the people for the\r\npurpose of putting down a gigantic rebellion and saving their own\r\ngovernment from destruction. This is a social phenomenon never before\r\nknown in history on a scale approaching the magnitude of our\r\ncombinations--a phenomenon which could only take place in a popular\r\ngovernment, where the unrestricted freedom of individual action promotes\r\nthe virtues of personal independence, self-respect, and manly courage.\r\nEven the Southern people, fighting on their own soil, in a war which,\r\nthough actually commenced by them, they now affect to consider wholly\r\ndefensive--even they, with all their boasted unanimity, and with the\r\nfierce passions engendered by slavery, have been compelled to maintain\r\ntheir armies by a conscription of the most unexampled severity; while\r\nthe loyal States, fighting solely for union and nationality--interests\r\nof the most general nature, and offering little of mere personal\r\ninducement--have so far escaped that necessity, and are now just\r\npreparing to resort to it. After all, it must be acknowledged by every\r\njust and generous mind, whether that of friend or foe, that there is a\r\nsubstratum of noble sentiment and manly impulses at the foundation of\r\nthe Yankee character. The vast movements of the Northern people plainly\r\nshow it. Their contributions for the support of soldiers' families and\r\nfor the relief of the wounded and disabled, are upon a gigantic scale.\r\nThey raise immense sums for the payment of bounties to volunteers, and\r\nthus, in every way, the burdens of the war are voluntarily assumed by\r\nthe people, and to some extent distributed among them, so that every one\r\nmay participate in the patriotic work. Nor is this large-hearted\r\nliberality confined solely to our own country. The sufferers in other\r\nlands, who have felt the disastrous effects of our great civil war, have\r\nnot been forgotten. In the midst of a life-and-death struggle among\r\nourselves, we have found time and means to assist in relieving their\r\nwants--an exhibition of liberality peculiar, and truly American in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nNor are these the only interesting features in the bearing of the\r\nAmerican people at the present crisis. Perhaps a still more remarkable\r\none is the entire devotion of the national energies--of intellect not\r\nless than of heart, of skill, not less than of capital--to the great\r\npurposes of the war. This was the necessary result of our free\r\ninstitutions; of our untrammelled pursuits; the mobility of our means\r\nand agencies of production; and the plastic character of all our\r\ncreations. The amount of thought expended on this subject has been\r\nprodigious and incalculable. It would be difficult, if not impossible,\r\nto enumerate the ten thousand inventions and devices of all kinds which\r\nhave been presented for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of\r\nweapons and of all the appliances of war, as well as for adding to the\r\ncomfort and securing the health of the soldier. Every imaginable\r\ninstrument of usefulness in any of the operations of the camp, or the\r\nmarch, or the field of battle, has been the subject of tentative\r\ningenuity, such as none but Yankees could display. The musket, the\r\ncarbine, the pistol, have been constructed upon numberless plans,\r\napparently with every possible modification. The cartridge has been\r\ncovered with copper, impervious to water, instead of paper, and has its\r\nown fulminate attached in various modes. Cannon shot and shells have\r\nbeen made in many new forms; and cannons themselves have been increased\r\nin calibre to an extraordinary size with proportionate efficiency, and\r\nhave been constructed in various modes and forms never before conceived.\r\nThe tent, the cot, the chest, the chair, the knife and fork, the stove\r\nand bakeoven, each and every one of them, have been touched by the\r\ntransforming hand of homely genius, and have assumed a thousand\r\nunimaginable forms of usefulness and convenience. India rubber and every\r\nother available material have been made to perform new and appropriate\r\nparts in the general work. The result of all this unexampled activity\r\nand ingenuity has not yet been fully eliminated. It would require years\r\nof experience in war in order to bring American genius, as at present\r\ndeveloped, to bear with all its extraordinary force on the mechanical\r\ndetails of the military art. Beyond doubt, numberless devices, among\r\nthose presented, will prove to be utterly worthless; but many of them\r\nwill certainly stand the test of experience, will be ultimately approved\r\nand adopted, and will remain as monuments of the enterprise and\r\ningenuity aroused by the necessities of the country in this hour of its\r\nsad calamity.\r\n\r\nIt would be a curious and interesting employment to estimate the number\r\nand character of these inventions, due wholly to the existing civil\r\nstrife. Only then should we be able to form some adequate conception of\r\nthe immense stimulus which has been applied to the national intellect,\r\nand which has caused it to embrace within the boundless range of its\r\ninvestigations, the highest moral and political problems, alike with the\r\nminutest questions of mechanical and economical convenience. But we\r\nshould be greatly disappointed in not finding this phenomenon even\r\npartially comprehended by the powers that be. It is truly a melancholy\r\nthing to meet in the highest quarters so little sympathy with the\r\nnoblest efforts of the popular mind, and to witness the cold neglect and\r\neven disdainful suspicion with which the most useful and valuable\r\ndevices are often received, or rather, we should say, haughtily\r\ndisregarded and rejected. Seldom or never do we find these inventions\r\nappreciated according to their merits. The Government is proverbially\r\nslow to adopt improvements of any kind; and the army and navy, like all\r\nsimilar professional bodies, are averse to every important change, and\r\nwedded to the instruments and processes in the use of which they have\r\nbeen educated and trained. This peculiar indisposition to progressive\r\nmovements, in all the established institutions and organizations of\r\nsociety, has frequently been the subject of remark and of regret. It is,\r\nhowever, only an exaggeration of the conservative principle, which, when\r\nconfined within proper limits, is wise and beneficial. Indeed, the\r\nactual progress of society in any period, is neither more nor less than\r\nthe result of the conflict between the opposite tendencies, of\r\nretrogradation and advancement--a disposition to adhere to the old,\r\nwhich has been tried and approved, and a tendency toward the new, which,\r\nhowever promising and alluring, may yet disappoint and mislead. In the\r\nlong run, however, the latter prevails, and the progressive movement,\r\nmore or less rapid, goes on continually. Improvements gradually force\r\nthemselves upon the attention of the most prejudiced minds, and\r\neventually conquer opposition in spite of professional immobility and\r\naversion to change. Observation has shown that the most important steps\r\nof progress usually originate outside of the professions, and are only\r\nadopted when they can no longer be resisted with safety to the\r\nconservative body. To the volunteer officer and soldier, or to those\r\neducated soldiers who have long been in civil life, will probably be due\r\nthe greater part of that accessibility to new ideas which will result in\r\nimportant advances in the art of war. This assertion may seem to be\r\nparadoxical; but all experience proves that ignorance of old processes\r\nis most favorable to the introduction of new ones. And though in a\r\nthousand instances such ignorance may be disastrous, occasionally it\r\nfinds the unprejudiced intellect illuminated by flashes of original\r\ngenius, and open to the entrance of valuable ideas which would have been\r\nutterly excluded by all the old and established rules.\r\n\r\nBut the actual work of the unexampled mental activity of the present\r\nday, will not be fully known and estimated until after the close of the\r\nwar. Until then there will be neither time nor opportunity to weigh and\r\ntest the creations of the national ingenuity. In the midst of campaigns\r\nand battles, with the absorbing interest of the great struggle, the\r\ninstruments of warfare cannot be easily changed, however important may\r\nbe the improvement presented. The emergency which arouses genius and\r\nbrings forth valuable inventions, is by no means favorable to their\r\nadoption and general use. On the contrary, by a sort of fatality which\r\nseems to be a law of their existence, they are doomed to struggle with\r\nadversity and fierce opposition, and they are left by the occasion which\r\ngave them birth as its repudiated offspring--a legacy to the future\r\nemergency which will cherish and perfect them, make them available, and\r\nenjoy the full benefit to be derived from them.\r\n\r\nThe navy has always justly been the pride of our country; and it was to\r\nbe expected that it would first feel the impulse of inventive genius.\r\nConfident in our strength and resources, we had long remained\r\ncomparatively sluggish, and regardless of those interesting experiments\r\nwhich other great maritime powers had been carefully making with a view\r\nto render ships invulnerable. We looked on quietly, observed the\r\nresults, and waited for the occasion when we should be required to put\r\nforth our strength in this direction. When the war commenced, we had not\r\na single iron-clad vessel of any description. It became necessary that\r\nthe immense Southern coast of our country should be subjected to the\r\nstrictest blockade. This was a work of vast magnitude, and a very large\r\nand sudden increase of the navy was demanded by the extraordinary\r\nemergency. Cities were to be taken, and strong fortresses to be\r\nattacked. The rebels had managed to save some of the vessels intended to\r\nbe destroyed at Norfolk, and had converted the Merrimack into a\r\nformidable monster, which in due time displayed her destructive powers\r\nupon our unfortunate fleet in Hampton Roads, in that ever-memorable\r\ncontest in which the Monitor first made her timely appearance. The chief\r\nresult of the vast effort demanded by the perilous situation of our\r\ncountry, was the class of vessels of which the partially successful but\r\nill-fated Monitor was the type. These structures are certainly very far\r\nfrom being perfect as ships of war; nevertheless, they constitute an\r\ninteresting and valuable experiment, and mark an advance in naval\r\nwarfare of the very first importance. They establish the form in which\r\ndefensive armor may perhaps be most effectively disposed for the\r\nprotection of men on board ships; but at the same time, it must be\r\nconceded that they utterly fail in all the other requisites for\r\nmen-of-war and sea-going vessels. They are deficient in buoyancy and\r\nspeed. In truth they are nothing more than floating batteries, useful in\r\nthe defence of harbors or the attack of forts. The melancholy end of the\r\nMonitor shows too plainly that vessels of her character cannot be safely\r\ntrusted to the fury of the open sea. They may do well in favorable\r\nweather, or may escape on a single expedition; but a repetition of long\r\nvoyages will be almost certain to result in their loss.\r\n\r\nWe want lighter and swifter vessels to be equally formidable in\r\nordnance, and alike invulnerable to the attacks of any adversary. To\r\ncombine all these requisites is not beyond the ingenuity of American\r\nconstructors. Most assuredly such vessels will soon make their\r\nappearance on the ocean. Some new arrangement of the propelling\r\napparatus, and lighter and more powerful machinery, will accomplish this\r\nimportant end. And then, too, with greatly increased speed, and with a\r\nconstruction suitable to the new function, the principle of the ram will\r\nbe perfected; so that the projectile thrown by the most powerful\r\nordnance now existing or even conceived will be insignificant compared\r\nwith the momentum of a large steamer, going at the rate of thirty or\r\nforty miles an hour, and herself becoming the direct instrument of\r\ndestruction to her adversary. Ordnance may possibly be devised which\r\nwill throw shot or shell weighing each a thousand pounds; but by the new\r\nprinciple, which is evidently growing in practicability and favor, the\r\nweight of thousands of tons will be precipitated against vessels of war,\r\nand naval combats will become a conflict of gigantic forces, in\r\ncomparison with which the discharge of guns and the momentum of cannon\r\nballs will be little more than the bursting of bubbles.\r\n\r\nThe exploits of the rebel steamer Alabama, so destructive to our\r\ncommerce and so humiliating to our pride as a great naval power,\r\nsufficiently attest the vital importance of the element of speed in\r\nships of war. Her capacity under steam is beyond that of our best\r\nvessels, and she therefore becomes, at her pleasure, utterly\r\ninaccessible to anything we may send to pursue her. We have built our\r\nsteamers strong and heavy; but proportionately slow and clumsy. The\r\nAlabama could not safely encounter any one of them entitled to the name\r\nof a regular cruiser; but she does not intend to risk such a contest,\r\nand, most unfortunately for us, she cannot be compelled to meet it. Of\r\nwhat real use are all the costly structures of our navy with the\r\ntremendous ordnance which they carry, if this comparatively\r\ninsignificant craft can go and come when and where she will, and sail\r\nthrough and around our fleets without the possibility of being\r\ninterrupted? They are perfectly well suited to remain stationary and aid\r\nus in blockading the Southern ports; but the frequent escape of fast\r\nsteamers running the blockade, serves still further to demonstrate the\r\ngreat and palpable deficiency in the speed of our ships of war. We may\r\nstart a hundred of our best steamers on the track of the Alabama, and,\r\nwithout an accident, they can never overtake her. The only alternative\r\nis to accept the lesson which her example teaches, and to surpass her in\r\nthose qualities which constitute her efficiency and make her formidable\r\nas a foe. This we must do, or we must quietly surrender our commerce to\r\nher infamous depredations, and acknowledge ourselves beaten on the seas\r\nby the rebel confederacy without an open port, and without anything\r\nworthy to be called a navy. The ability of our naval heroes, and their\r\nskill and valor, so nobly illustrated on several occasions during the\r\npresent war, will be utterly unavailing against superior celerity of\r\nmotion. Their just pride must be humbled, and their patriotic hearts\r\nmust chafe with vexation, so long as the terrible rebel rover continues\r\nto command the seas, as she will not fail to do so long as we are unable\r\nto cope with her in activity and speed. Nor is it certain we have yet\r\nknown the worst. Ominous appearances abroad, and thick-coming rumors\r\nbrought by every arrival, indicate the construction in England of\r\nnumerous other ships like the Alabama, destined to run the blockade and\r\nafterward to join that renowned cruiser in her work of destruction.\r\nStores of cotton held in Southern ports offer a temptation to the\r\ncupidity of foreign adventurers which will command capital to any\r\namount, and the best skill of English engineers and builders will be\r\nenlisted to make the enterprise successful--a skill not embarrassed by\r\nbureaucratic inertia and stolidity.\r\n\r\nLet the genius of American constructors and engineers be brought to bear\r\non the subject, and the important problem will be solved in sixty days.\r\nIndeed, there are plans in existence, at this very hour, by which the\r\ndesired end could be at once accomplished. But the inertia of official\r\nauthority, and especially of the bureaus in the Navy Department, is such\r\nthat any novel idea, however demonstrably good and valuable, is usually\r\ndoomed to battle for years against opposition of all kinds before it can\r\nhope to secure an introduction. In all probability, the war will have\r\nbeen ended before anything of great importance ever can be accomplished\r\nthrough those channels. The adoption of the Monitor principle was not\r\ndue to the skill and intelligence found in official quarters; it was\r\nforced upon the Navy Department from the outside. And like the boa\r\nconstrictor, after having swallowed its prey, the Department must\r\nsluggishly repose until that meal is digested before another can be\r\ntaken. One idea, of the magnitude of this, is enough for the present\r\ncrisis. We shall not have another, if the stubborn resistance and fixity\r\nof ideas in the bureaus can prevent it. The invulnerability of the\r\nMonitors, and the peculiar arrangement by which this important end is\r\nobtained, are but one of the items necessary to make up the complete\r\nefficiency of war steamers. They are only one half what is required.\r\nThey accomplish one of the great desiderata in armaments afloat; but\r\nthey leave another equally important demand utterly unsatisfied. There\r\nis a counterpart to this achievement--its complement, equally\r\nindispensable to the efficiency of the navy, and waiting to be placed by\r\nthe side of the recent improvement. It must and will be brought forth,\r\nwhether the naval authorities assist or oppose. American genius, only\r\ngive it fair play, is equal to all emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe immense activity of thought and ingenuity elicited by the war, and\r\nextending to all the departments of enterprise appropriate to the great\r\ncrisis, is a phenomenon peculiar to the American people. It could be\r\nexhibited nowhere else, to the same extent, among civilized nations,\r\nbecause nowhere else is the same stimulus applied with equal directness\r\nto the popular masses. The operation of this peculiar cause is\r\nconspicuously plain. The Government of the United States is the people's\r\nGovernment; the war is emphatically the people's war. Every man feels\r\nthat he has a personal interest in it. He understands, more or less\r\nclearly, the whole question involved, and has fixed opinions, and\r\nperhaps strong feelings, in regard to it. His friends and neighbors and\r\nbrothers are in the army, and they have gone thither voluntarily,\r\nperhaps impelled by enlightened and conscientious convictions of duty.\r\nHis sympathies follow them; he ardently prays for their success; and he\r\nis stimulated to provide, as well as he can, for their comfort. All\r\nother business being greatly interrupted, if not wholly suspended, he\r\nthinks continuously of the mighty operations of the war. He dwells on\r\nthem night and day, and in the laboratory of his active mind, excited by\r\nthe mighty stimulus of personal and patriotic feeling natural to the\r\noccasion, he produces those extraordinary combinations which distinguish\r\nthe present era.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these impulses which operate so generally, there is the\r\nstill more universal and all-pervading love of gain which stimulates his\r\ninventive faculties, and causes them to operate in the direction in\r\nwhich his hopes and sympathies are turned. Aroused by motives of all\r\nkinds, the whole mind and heart of the country is absorbed in the great\r\ncontest, and all its energies are applied in every conceivable way to\r\nthe work of war. The man who carries the gun and uses it on the battle\r\nfield is not more earnestly engaged in this work than he who racks his\r\nbrain and sifts his teeming ideas for the purpose of making the\r\ninstrument more destructive. Even the victims who fall in the deadly\r\nstrife and give their mangled bodies to their country, are not more\r\ntruly martyrs to a glorious cause than the inventors who sometimes\r\nsacrifice themselves in the course of their perilous experiments, or by\r\nthe slower process of mental and physical exhaustion during the long\r\nyears of 'hope deferred,' while vainly seeking to make known the value\r\nof their devices. A great power is at work, operating on the character\r\nand capacity of each individual, and affecting each according to the\r\ninfinite diversity which prevails among men. A common enthusiasm, or,\r\nat least, a common excitement pervades the whole community to its\r\nprofoundest depths, and arouses all its energy and all its intellect,\r\nwhatever that energy and intellect may be capable of doing. It carries\r\nmultitudes into the army full of patriotic ardor; it inspires others\r\nwith grand ideas, which they seek to embody in combinations of power,\r\nuseful and effective in the great work which is the task of the nation,\r\nand for the accomplishment of which all noble hearts are laboring\r\nearnestly and incessantly.\r\n\r\nBut in this tempestuous hour, as in more peaceful times, good and bad\r\nideas, valuable and worthless devices, noble and generous as well as\r\nsinister and mercenary purposes are mingled in the vast multitude of\r\nprojects which are presented for acceptance and adoption. The power of\r\nthe nation is magnified by the impulse which arouses it; but in its\r\nexaltation it still retains its errors and defects. It is the same\r\npeople, with all their characteristic faults and virtues, stimulated to\r\nmighty exertions in a sacred cause, who have been so often engaged in\r\npetty partisan contests, swayed by dishonest leaders, and carried astray\r\nby the base intrigues of ambition and selfishness. Yet, as the masses,\r\nat all times, have had no interest but that of the nation which they\r\nchiefly constitute, and have sought nothing but what they at least\r\nconsidered to be the public good, so even now, in these mad and perilous\r\ntimes, the predominating sentiment and purpose of the people, in\r\nwhatever sphere they move, are, on the whole, good and worthy of\r\napproval. Every one must at least pretend to be controlled by honest and\r\npatriotic motives; and in such an emergency hypocrisy cannot possibly be\r\nuniversal or even predominant. Although men may seek chiefly their own\r\ninterest and profit, they must do so through some effort of public\r\nusefulness. They must commend themselves, their works, and ideas, as of\r\nsuperior importance to the cause of the country; and in this universal\r\nstruggle and competition--this mighty effervescence of popular thought\r\nand action, it would be strange and unexampled, if some great, new\r\nconceptions should not dawn upon us. The very condition, physical,\r\nsocial, and moral, of our twenty millions of people in the loyal States\r\nis unlike all that has ever preceded it. Their general intelligence, the\r\nresult of universal education, makes available their unlimited freedom,\r\nand establishes their capacity for great achievements. The present\r\nmomentous occasion makes an imperative demand upon all their highest\r\nfaculties, and they cannot fail to respond in a manner which will\r\nsatisfy every just expectation.\r\n\r\nWhat the Government has undertaken in this crisis is worthy of a great\r\npeople and springs from the large ideas habitual to Americans. The\r\nblockade of the whole Southern coast, with its vast shore line, and its\r\nintricate network of inlets, harbors, and rivers; the controlling of the\r\nmighty Mississippi from Cairo to the gulf; the campaigns in Virginia,\r\nTennessee, and Arkansas; and the pending attacks on Charleston and\r\nSavannah--these gigantic and tremendous operations have something of\r\nthat grandeur which is familiar to our thoughts--which, indeed,\r\nconstitutes the staple of the ordinary American speech, apparently\r\nhaving all the characteristics of exaggerated jesting and idle boast. We\r\nfrequently hear our enthusiastic countrymen talk of anchoring Great\r\nBritain in one of our northern lakes. They speak contemptuously of the\r\npetty jurisdictions of European powers contrasted with the magnificent\r\ndomain of our States, and they sneer at the rivers of the old continent\r\nas mere rills by the side of the mighty 'father of waters.' The men\r\nwhose very jests are on a scale of such magnitude, do not seem to find\r\nthe extensive military operations too large for their serious thoughts.\r\nNo American considers them beyond our power, or for one moment hesitates\r\nto admit their ultimate success. No difficulties discourage us, no\r\ndisasters appal. We move on with indomitable will and determination,\r\nlooking through all the obstacles to the grand result as already\r\naccomplished. Does slavery stand in the way, and cotton seek to usurp\r\nthe throne of universal empire, dictating terms to twenty millions of\r\nfreemen, and demanding the acquiescence of the world? The first is\r\nannihilated by a word proclaiming universal liberation; the second is\r\nblockaded in his ports, surrounded by a wall of fire, suffocated and\r\nstrangled, and dragged helpless and insensible from his imaginary\r\nthrone. A proud and desperate aristocracy, rich and powerful, and\r\ncorrespondingly confident, undertake to measure strength with the\r\ndemocratic millions whom they despise. These Northern people, scorned\r\nand detested, have ideas--grand and magnificent as well as practical\r\nideas, nurtured by universal education and unlimited freedom of thought\r\nand act. The fierce and relentless aristocracy rave in their very\r\nmadness, and defy the people whom they seek to destroy; but these bear\r\ndown upon the haughty enemy, slowly and deliberately--awkwardly and\r\nblunderingly, it may be, at first, but learning by experience, and\r\nmoving on, through all vicissitudes, with the certainty and solemnity of\r\ndestiny to the hour of final and complete success. The confidence in\r\nthis grand result dominates every other thought. All ideas and all\r\npurposes revolve around it as a centre. It is the internal fire which\r\nwarms the patriotism, strengthens the purpose, stimulates the invention,\r\nsustains the courage, and feeds the undying confidence of the nation, in\r\nthis, the hour of its desperate struggle for existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROMOTED!\r\n\r\n\r\n  '_You_ will not bid me stay!' he said,\r\n    'She calls for me--my native land!\r\n  And _stay_? ah, better to be dead!\r\n    A _coward_ dare not ask your hand!\r\n\r\n  'My crimson sash you'll tie for me,\r\n    My belted sword you'll fasten, love!\r\n  I swear to both I'll faithful be,\r\n    To these below! to God above!\r\n\r\n  'And if, perchance, my sword shall win\r\n    A laurel wreath to crown _your_ name,\r\n  He will not count it as my sin,\r\n    That I for _you_ have prayed for fame!'\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  His name rings thro' his native land,\r\n    His sword has won the hero's prize;\r\n  Why comes he not to ask her hand?\r\n    Dead on the battle field he lies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRIETTA AND VULCAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime, O well beloved, floweth by like a river; sweepeth on by turreted\r\ncastles and dainty boat-houses, great old forests and ruined cities.\r\nTender, cool-eyed lilies fringe its rippling shores, straggling arms of\r\nlonging seaweeds are unceasingly wooing and losing its flying waves; and\r\non its purple bosom by night, linger merrily hosts of dancing stars.\r\nBright under its limpid waters gleam the towers of many a 'sunken city.'\r\nStrong and clear through the night-silence of eager listening, ring the\r\nchimes of their far-off bells, the echoes of joyous laughter: and to\r\nwaiting, yearning ones come, ever and anon, deep glances from gleaming\r\neyes, warm graspings from outstretched hands. And well windeth the river\r\ninto grim old caves, and even the merriest boat that King Cole ever\r\nlaunched flitteth by the dark doors, intent only on the brilliant\r\n_chateaux_, that shimmer above in the gorgeous sunlight of a brave\r\n_Espagne_. But laughing imps, with flying feet, venture singly into\r\nthese realms of the Unknown. Bright streameth the light there from\r\ncarbuncles and glowing rubies; but of the melodies that there bewilder\r\nthem, no returning voice ever speaketh, for are they not Eleusinian\r\nmysteries? But when thou meetest, O brother, sailing down the stream\r\nunder gay flags and rounding sails, some Hogarth or some Sterne, who\r\nplayeth _rouge et noir_ with keen old Pharaohs, and battledore with\r\nCharlie Buff; who singeth brave _Libiamos_, and despiseth not the\r\nChristmas plums of Johnny Horner; who payeth graceful court to the great\r\nand learned, and warmeth the pale hearts of the shivering poor with his\r\nkind cheer and gentle words; who sitteth with Socrates and Pericles at\r\nthe feet of an ever-lovely Aspasia, and whispereth _capricios_ to Anna\r\nMaria at the opera; know then, O beloved, if thou hast ever trodden the\r\nmystic halls, that this man is the brother of thy soul! Selah!\r\n\r\nBut the bravest stream that ever was born on a mountain side has its\r\nshoals and quicksands, and far out in the sounding sea rise slowly coral\r\nreefs. Now, if on every green, growing isle newly rising to the\r\nsunlight, the glorious jealousy of some Jove should toss a Vulcan, how\r\nwould our Venuses be suddenly charmed by the beauties of a South Sea\r\nScheme! how would their tiny shallops dot the curling waves, and what\r\nnew flowers would spring upon the smiling shores to greet their rosy\r\nfeet!\r\n\r\n'And why a Vulcan?' says the elegant Narcissus Hare, with a shiver; 'a\r\ngreat, grim, solemn, limping monster, that Brummel would have spurned in\r\ndisgust! And he to win our ladies with their delicate loveliness! Faugh,\r\nsir! are you a Cyclops yourself?'\r\n\r\nAlas! my Tinkler, do you remember that Salmasius began his vituperations\r\nof Milton with gratuitous speculations upon his supposed ugliness, and\r\nthat great was his grief when he was assured that he contended with an\r\nideal of beauty. Have you forgotten that the Antinöus won the\r\ndistinguished favor of his merry, courteous queen Christina, and that\r\nthe satirist and man of 'taste' died of obscurity in a year? Beware, my\r\nlittle Narcissus, lest the next autumn flowers bloom above your grave in\r\nGreenwood, and your fair Luline be accepting bouquets and _bonbons_ from\r\nme.\r\n\r\nYou, Roland, are pale from the very contemplation of such a catastrophe,\r\nsuch an unprecedented _hægira_ of dames! It is as if from every gay\r\nwatering place, some softly tinkling bell should summon the fair\r\nmermaids. Beplaided and betrowsered, with their little gypsy hats, would\r\nthey float out beyond the breakers, waving aside with farewell, airy\r\nkisses, the patent life boats and the magical preservers, and pressing\r\non, like Gebers, with their rosy faces and great, hopeful eyes ever\r\nlaughingly, merrily turned to the golden east--their _Morgen Land_!\r\n\r\nAh! but--have we no Vulcans among us? 'Fair Bertha, Beatrice, Alys,'\r\ncome out of the Christmas ecstatics of the dear old year that has just\r\nstreamed out like a meteor among the stars;--_you_ know, fair ones, that\r\nthe stars are only years, and the planets grave old centuries; lock away\r\nthe jewels and the lace sets--charming, I know--the glove boxes and the\r\nstatuettes, the cream-leaved books, and the fragile, graceful\r\n_babioles_; pull up the cushions, and group your bright selves around\r\nthe register--it's very cold to-day, you roses--and let us settle the\r\nquestion--have we a Vulcan among us?\r\n\r\nMagnificent essayists, O dearly beloved, have handled 'Our Husbands,'\r\n'Our Wives,' 'Our Sons' and 'Our Daughters' in a masterly style. Very\r\npraiseworthy, no doubt, but so unromantic! Why, there's not a green leaf\r\nin the whole collection! The style is decidedly Egyptian, solid and\r\nexpressive, but dreadfully compact. No arabesques, those offshoots of\r\nlazy, dreamy hours and pleasantly disconnected thoughts, disgrace the\r\nsolemnly even tenor of these fathers of 'Ephemeral Literature,' as some\r\n'rude Iconoclast' has irreverently styled the butterfly journeyings of\r\nour magazine age. But we, O merry souls and brave, are still young and\r\nfrivolous: we still look at pictures with as much zest as before our\r\ndimly remembered teens; and we belong to that happy branch of the\r\nScribbleri family, that prefer the sympathy of bright eyes and gay\r\nlaughter, to the approving shake of any D'Orsay's 'ambrosial curls,' or\r\nthe most unqualified smile from the grimmest old champion who even now\r\nvotes in his secret heart against the New Tariff, or charges with\r\nunparalleled bravery imaginary or windmill giants on the floor of a\r\nPlatform or of a Legislature.\r\n\r\nBut this, our paper, purporteth to be, in some wise, a disquisition on\r\nBeaux, and, by our faith, we had well-nigh forgotten it. _Retournons à\r\nnos moutons_, as the ancient lawyers used to say (and many a tyro, in\r\nthe interim, hath said the same) when they grew so entangled in the\r\nmazes of Jack Shepherd cases that they lost sight of their original\r\ndesigns. And lest I should grow wearisomely prosaic, and see the yawn\r\nbehind your white hand, _belle_ Beatrice, let me make my disquisition a\r\nhalf story, and point my moral, not as fairies do, with a pinch, but\r\nwith the shadow of a tale.\r\n\r\nAnd here, _signorina_, though in courage I am a Cæsar, here I shrink.\r\nThe birdseye view I would take of a few leaves of beau-dom, should be\r\nfrom the standing point of your own unquiet, peering eyes; and if even\r\nCupid is blindfold, how may I, to whom you are all tormentingly\r\ndelicious enigmas, hope in my own unaided strength to enter the charmed\r\ncitadel of your experiences? Oh, no! But happy is the man, who, with an\r\ninquiring mind, has also a sister! Thrice happy he whose sisters have\r\njust now flitted down the staircase, from their own inner sanctuaries,\r\ninto the little library, bearing with them in noisy triumph the Harry of\r\nall Goodfellows, the truant Henrietta Ruyter! Ah! she is the key that\r\nwill unlock for me those treasures of thought and observation that I\r\nwill shortly lay before you, O readers!\r\n\r\nAnd now to you, O much-traduced star, that presided at my _début_ into\r\nthis vale of tears, may the most glorious rocket ascend that Jackson\r\never said or sung, one that shall break out in pæans of brilliant\r\nstars!--_for_, when I entered the charmed presence, the very ball that I\r\nhad been wishing to roll was upon the carpet. But of this I was\r\nunconscious as I admired Fanny's new dress, the mysterious earrings of\r\nour stately Bertha, and ventured upon a slight compliment to Henrietta,\r\nwho lounged upon the divan. With admirable dexterity, the young lady\r\ncaught the _fleurette_ upon her crochet needle, reviewed it carelessly,\r\nand finally decided to accept it; an event that I had undoubtedly\r\nforeseen, for the compliment was a graceful and artistic one. But\r\nbrothers, as you, Gustav, my boy, have long since discovered, are not\r\nevents, and I was presently consigned to the 'elephant chair' in the\r\ncorner, with a portfolio of sketches that Henrietta had brought from\r\nover the sea--and the dames continued, in charming obliviousness of my\r\npresence.\r\n\r\n'Girls,' said Henrietta, having deposited my compliment snugly in her\r\nlittle workbasket, whence it may issue to the delectation of some future\r\nyoung lady group, 'how are you going to entertain me? Such a Wandering\r\nJew as I am! A perfect Ahasuerus! _What_ a novelty it will be that will\r\ninterest _me_!' and with a most laughingly wearied air, the pretty\r\neyebrows were raised, and waves of weariness floated over the golden\r\nhair in its scarlet net.\r\n\r\nFanny looked concerned. 'We may have a week of opera.'\r\n\r\n'I've been--in--Milan,' returned Henrietta, with a well-counterfeited\r\nair of the disdain with which Mrs. De Lancy Stevens views all republican\r\ninstitutions since her year in Europe. Bertha laughed.\r\n\r\n'You have grown literary, astronomical perhaps, with your star gazing,\r\nand Len has become such a Mitchellite of late, that two shelves of his\r\nbookcase are filled with works on the heavenly bodies. What a rapture\r\nyou will be in at the sight!'\r\n\r\n'Quite an Aquinas,' said Henrietta, with gravity.\r\n\r\n'How so, Harry,' asked Fanny, after a pause, during which she had been\r\ndeciding that her friend meant--Galileo!\r\n\r\n'Oh, he wrote about angels, you know; said these heavenly bodies were\r\nmade of thick clouds, and some other nonsense, of which I remember\r\nnothing.'\r\n\r\nI, in my corner, was devoutly thankful that angels now assume more\r\ntangible shapes, which chivalric sentiment, finding expression only in\r\nmy eyes, was recognized but by Henrietta, who rewarded me with a\r\nlightning smile.\r\n\r\n'Bertha, my queen,' continued she, as that lady's serene countenance\r\nbeamed upon her in apparently immovable calmness, '_does_ anything ever\r\narouse you? Have you forgotten, my impenetrable spirit, the sad days of\r\nyore, when we sobbed out grand _arias_ to the wretched accompaniment of\r\nProfessor Tirili, blistered our young fingers on guitar strings, waded\r\nunprofitably in oceans of Locke and Bacon, and were oftener at the apex\r\nof a triangle than its comfortable base? And you always as calm as\r\nthough 'sailing over summer seas!' Come--I am absolutely blue;' and the\r\nhalf-fretful belle, who had really exhausted her strength and amiability\r\nby a grand pedestrian tour in the Central Park that morning, stretched\r\nout demurely her gaiter boots, and drew with an invisible pencil on\r\nimaginary paper, the outline of her boldly arched instep.\r\n\r\n'If Landon would only come,' sighed Fanny, musingly, counting the beads\r\nfor the eye of the Polyphemus she was embroidering on a cushion for that\r\ngentleman's sofa meditations, 'he would entertain you, as well as\r\nthe--one--two--three--witches in Macbeth.'\r\n\r\n'No doubt of it,' said Henrietta.\r\n\r\n'Five blues and two blacks,' said Fanny, not heeding the reply. 'See,\r\ngirls,' and she held up the glittering orb, 'what a lovely eye!'\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm of her audience was delirious but subdued. I caught an\r\noccasional '_Such_ a love!' 'How sweet--how fierce!'\r\n\r\n'Now,' said Henrietta, decidedly, 'if Medusa had but one eye, and this\r\ndear creature two, I should die as miserably as the lady who loved the\r\nApollo Belvidere. I have had _oceans_ of knights errant--but _such_! I\r\nthink of writing a natural history like--Cuvier.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Bertha, quietly, 'or Peter Parley.'\r\n\r\n'Suppose I read you the advance sheets some morning?'\r\n\r\n'Charming,' said Fanny, with a little shrug of approaching delight.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Landon Snowe, Miss Fanny,' said a crusty voice, and from under a\r\ntower of white turban, Sibyl's face looked out--at the door.\r\n\r\n'We will see him here, Sibyl,' said Fanny, brightly; 'and oh, Sibyl, ask\r\nMott to make a macaroon custard for dinner, for Miss Ruyter.'\r\n\r\n'Excellent,' said that lady, again with the De Lancy Stevens air, 'I\r\nate--those--in--Paris. They actually flavor them there with _Haut\r\nBrion!_ and they are delicious!' and Henrietta's lips fairly quivered at\r\nthe remembrance, that was by no means a recollection of the long-ago\r\nenjoyed dainties.\r\n\r\n'Such extravagance!' said Fanny, opening her eyes, and arranging sundry\r\nlittle points in her attitude that were intended to be very piercing\r\nindeed to the gentleman, whose step was now heard in the hall. 'Such\r\nextravagance, Harry! Your father, I suppose. You'll get nothing better\r\nthan Port here. Good morning, Mr. Snowe.'\r\n\r\n'Talking of ports, ladies,' said that gentleman, airily, after he had\r\nprostrated himself, figuratively as well as disfiguratively, before Miss\r\nHenrietta, bowed over Bertha's hand, and drew his chair to Fanny's\r\nsewing stand, for the triple purpose of confusing her zephyrs, flirting\r\nat a side table, and ascertaining whether Henrietta had fulfilled the\r\nluxuriant promise of her earlier youth. Snowe was, womanly speaking, as\r\nyou will see, 'a perfect love of a man.' 'Newport, for example, and\r\ncharming drives? Williamsport and the Susquehanna, Miss Fanny?'\r\n\r\nVery statesmanly, O Landon G. Snowe, Esq., both the glance beneath which\r\nmy poor little sister's eyes fell, and the allusions twain to the scenes\r\nof many a pleasure past. But Fanny, though not mistress of her blushes,\r\ncan, at least, control her words.\r\n\r\n'You are not a very good Oedipus, Mr. Snowe; we were discussing\r\nimports.'\r\n\r\n'Such as laces and silks?'--\r\n\r\n'And punch,' suggested Henrietta.\r\n\r\nMr. Snowe's eyeglass was here freshly adjusted, and his attention\r\nbestowed upon the young lady who talked of punch, a thing unheard of in\r\nsociety! The prospect was refreshing. Henrietta was stylish, piquant,\r\nand pretty. Fanny was uncertain, indifferent, but, for the moment,\r\ndivine. He magnanimously sacrificed himself to the impulse of the\r\nmoment, and the courtesies of hospitality, and walked courageously over\r\nto Henrietta, under cover of a huge book.\r\n\r\n'They were views from the White Mountains, he believed. Had Miss Ruyter\r\nseen them? Allow him;' and he wheeled her sofa nearer the table, and\r\nunfurled the book. Henrietta was charmed.\r\n\r\n'The Schwartz Mountains? She had not understood. These are glaciers? How\r\nthey glisten! And these little flowers below are violets? Such pretty,\r\nmodest, ladylike flowers. Had Mr. Snowe a favorite among flowers?'\r\n\r\nMr. Snowe was prepared. He had answered the question exactly five\r\nhundred and ten times. To Cecilia Lanner, who was almost a _religieuse_,\r\nand who wore her diamond cross from principle, he was the very poet of a\r\npassion flower, such holy mysteries as its opening petals disclosed to\r\nhim! To Lucy Grey, who wore pensive curls, and had a sweet voice, he\r\npresented constantly fragrant little sprays of mignonette, cunning moss\r\nbaskets with a suspicion of heliotrope peeping out, and crushed myrtle\r\nblossoms between the leaves of her most exquisitely bound books. To Katy\r\nLessing, who rowed a small green boat somewhere up the Hudson in the\r\nsummer, he confided the fact that water lilies were his admiration: he\r\nloved the limpid water; its restless waves were like heart throbbings\r\n(this nearly overwhelmed poor Katy). All great and noble souls loved the\r\nwater;--he forgot the sacred fakirs, and the noble lord who preferred\r\nMalmsey wine! He had repeatedly assured Regina Ward that the camelia was\r\n_his_ flower, so proudly beautiful! His soul was 'permeated with\r\nloveliness,' and asked no fragrance. Regina is a great white creature,\r\nlovely to behold, and, perfectly conscious of her perfection, no more\r\nactively charming than the Ino of Foley. He won Milly White's favor by\r\napplauding her love for wild flowers, declaring that a field of\r\nbuttercups reminded him of the 'spangled heavens,' and that on summer\r\ndays he was constantly envying the cool little Jacks in their green\r\npulpits.\r\n\r\nA pretended Lavater--and there have been such--would have convicted\r\nSnowe at once of the most artful penetration, could he have seen the\r\nlowering curve of his brows as he watched the nervous fluttering of\r\nHenrietta's hands over the pictures, and the decided but softly pleasant\r\nrounding of her white chin. But it was the general unconsciously\r\npowerful indifference of manner, that advised him to prefer, in reply to\r\nher question:\r\n\r\n'The snapdragon, yes, beyond the shadow of a doubt. I have an odd\r\nfashion (very odd, Gustav!), Miss Ruyter, of associating ladies with\r\nflowers, and that gorgeous three-bird snapdragon always looks to me like\r\nsome brilliant belle, who holds her glittering sceptre and wields it,\r\ncapriciously perhaps, but always charmingly.'\r\n\r\n'A sort of Helen,' observed Henrietta, calmly.\r\n\r\n'A witching, arbitrary, lovely Helen,' promptly returned Snowe, who had\r\na vague idea of Greek helmets and golden apples, wooden horses, a great\r\nwar, and 'all for love.'\r\n\r\nHenrietta heard the magnificent vagueness, and became so intently\r\ninterested in a view, that Snowe came softly over to my window, and\r\nlooked into the garden. Lilly Brennan coming in just then, the\r\nconversation became general, and presently Snowe accompanied her down\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n'Fanny,' said Henrietta, with an inquisitorial air, after the girls had\r\ndecided that the slides on the bows of Lilly's dress were too small, and\r\nthat her 'Bird of Paradise' was lovely enough to fly away with them all,\r\n'Fanny, are you the 'bright, particular star' of that man?'\r\n\r\n'I believe so,' said Fanny, with a stare.\r\n\r\n'Do you intend to beam on him for any length of time?' persisted\r\nHenrietta.\r\n\r\n'I haven't decided,' said Fan, honestly. 'I love beauty, and Landon\r\nSnowe is magnificent.'\r\n\r\n'So is the Venus de Medicis,' said Henrietta, fiercely; 'but look at her\r\nspine! What sort of a brain do you think _could_ flourish at the top of\r\nsuch a spine? Not that I suppose that man to have the least fragment of\r\none; don't suspect such a thing! Don't you observe his weak, disjointed\r\nway of carrying his head, and the Pisan appearance of his sentences? I\r\nshould dread an earthquake for such a man as Mr. Snowe--you'd have\r\nnothing but remnants to remember him by, Fanny.'\r\n\r\n'But earthquakes _are_ phenomena,' said Fanny, stoutly, 'and I'm not in\r\nthe least like one. As long as Landon never fails except spiritually, I\r\nam contented--and even in that light _I_ never knew him to trip,' and\r\nthe child was as indignant as her indolent nature would permit.\r\n\r\n'Trip! of course not,' echoed Henrietta, 'when he's buried like a\r\ndelicate Sphinx up to his shoulders in the sands of your good opinion,\r\nand the mummy cloths of his own conceit; but just remove these, and\r\nyou'll see a downfall. My dear FRANCESCA, this man is your CECCO, and\r\nhe'd far better retire into a monastery than hope to win you. Why, I'd\r\nrather marry you myself, FRANCESCA! Such charms!' and Henrietta, with\r\nher own delicate perception and enjoyment of the beautiful, kissed my\r\nsister's deprecatingly extended hand, and, as the dinner bell rang,\r\nwaltzed her out of the room.\r\n\r\n'It's perfectly bewildering the interest some people take in music,' she\r\nresumed later, building a little tent on the side of her plate with the\r\n_débris_ of fish. 'There's Bartlett Browning, telling me the other\r\nevening a melancholy story of some melodious fishes, off the coast\r\nof--_Weiss nicht wo_; oysters, I suppose; conceive of it! the most\r\nphlegmatic of creatures. I suppose some poor fisherman heard a merlady\r\nsinging in her green halls, and fancied it the death song of some of his\r\nshells. But that's nothing to some of Bartlett Browning's musical tales.\r\nThe man's a perfect B flat himself!'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Nelly, Phil's little girl, who had come around to show her\r\nnew velvet basque, 'but shells _do_ sing, for I've often listened to\r\nmamma's, and Bessy gives it to me at night to put me to sleep. _You_\r\nknow, Aunt Bertie, for you once made me learn what it said:\r\n\r\n  'Oh, sweet and far, from cliff and scar,\r\n    The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!'\r\n\r\n'Fish-land, my beauty,' said Henrietta, playfully; 'let us hear _your_\r\nsong, fishlet,' and she held a little gleaming shrimp by his tail, and\r\nlooked expectantly at his silent mouth. And here I remember, with a\r\nsmile of amusement and some astonishment, that Herman Melville, in\r\nnervous fear of ridicule, apologized, most gracefully, of course, for\r\nhis beauteous Fayaway's primitive mode of carving a fish; but I fancy I\r\nhear myself, or you either, sir, begging the community to shut its dear\r\neyes, while Harry's little victim, all unconscious of his fate,\r\ndisappeared behind the walls, coral and white, of her lips and teeth.\r\n\r\nOh, isn't it perfectly delicious to meet a real, frank, merry, wise sort\r\nof a girl, who doesn't wear spectacles or blue stockings, nor disdain\r\nthe Lancers or a new frock with nineteen flounces? Just fancy it,\r\nGustav, my dear fellow, chatting with the Venus of Milo, in a New York\r\ndining room, and she all done up in blue poplin, with cords and tassels\r\nand all that, with that lovely hair tumbling about in a scarlet net, and\r\nsuch a splendid enjoyment of her own great grace, and royal claiming of\r\nhomage! Eating mashed potatoes too, and celery, and roast beef, to keep\r\nup that magnificent physique of hers! Oh, it's rare!\r\n\r\nBut Henrietta couldn't forget Snowe, any more than Snowe could forget\r\nhimself; so, after she had gazed with delight at the red veins of wine\r\nthat threaded the jelly-like custard, with its imprisoned macaroons,\r\nlooking like gold fish asleep in a globe of sun-dyed water, she went on,\r\nas if the conversation had not been interrupted:\r\n\r\n'Do you know, Fan, that he reminds me constantly of champagne. If\r\nthere's anything on earth or in a cellar that I do detest, its\r\nchampagne; such smiling, brilliant-looking impudence, that comes out\r\nfizz--bang! and that's the end of it; there's not so much as the quaver\r\nof an echo. You drink it, and instead of seeing cool vineyards and\r\npurple waters and cataracts of icicles in your glass, you find a pale,\r\ngaunt spectre, or a poor, half-drowned Bacchus, staring at you. It's\r\njust so with your Landon Snowe. You, and other people, too, have a\r\n_habit_ of admiring him, a great creature with eyes of milky blue, who\r\ngoes about disbursing his small coin like some old Aladdin! Why, my dear\r\nchildren, the man, I don't doubt, is this moment congratulating himself,\r\nin his solitude at Delmonico's, upon his great penetration. Didn't you\r\nsee him studying me with a great flourish of deference, and throwing\r\nhis old, three-birded snapdragons into my White Mountains? If he had\r\nbeen as ugly as a Scarron, now, and had known what he said, I could have\r\nloved him for that, for, of all things, I do delight in dragons! Such\r\nsieges as I have had at zoological gardens and menageries, from Dan to\r\nBeersheba, just to see one; and ugly old lizards have been pointed out\r\nto me, and scorpions, and every imaginable object but a dragon. But one\r\nday I dug a splendid old manuscript--a perfect fossil--out of some old\r\nlibrary in Spezia, and opening it, by the merest chance came upon a most\r\nlovely, illuminated, full-grown dragon, the very one, I suppose, that\r\nConfucius couldn't find! I gazed in raptures, my dearest; he perfectly\r\nsparkled with emeralds; his eyes were the most luminous opals. Dear,\r\nhappy old Indians, who had their dragons at the four corners of the\r\nearth, and could go and look over at the lordly creatures whenever they\r\nfelt melancholy. And besides, I have a little private system of\r\ndragonology of my own, that approaches the equator more nearly. I've\r\nalways worn opals since that day on every possible occasion; I mean to\r\nbe married in them.'\r\n\r\nHurra! _belle Henriette!_ thou hast a weakness. At the end of a long\r\naisle, shrouded in sumptuously colored perfumed light, stands an altar,\r\nand white surplices gleam through the effulgence.--Thou queen! and that\r\nthy crowning!\r\n\r\n'Len,' said Fanny the next morning, as I sat, after breakfast, over the\r\npaper, 'don't you think Harry is a little, just a little, satirical,\r\nand--well--not _perfectly_ ladylike and kind, to talk so dreadfully of\r\none's friends?'\r\n\r\n'Satirical!? Bless your little, tender heart, not the least mite in the\r\nworld; she's quite too straightforward for that. Unladylike! Why, my\r\ndear Fanny, don't you know 'the wounds of a friend'? Did you never\r\nthink, little sister, that some girls are sent into the world to perform\r\nthe office of crumb-scrapers for your serene highnesses, and themselves\r\nas well?'\r\n\r\n'Like a lady, who gives a dinner party, jumping up and brushing off her\r\nown table,' said Fanny with an amused laugh.\r\n\r\n'Just so, dear; and as they go wandering about, not a fragment can be\r\nomitted. Now, a little dwarf of a thing like you couldn't do that with\r\nany grace; but Harry _could_, you know, and make everybody think it was\r\ncharming. So, if fragments of poor Snowe fall under her unsparing hand,\r\nand she brushes them off carelessly, don't let anybody's tears go\r\nrolling after, don't let anybody's heart ache, for such a trifle; think\r\nof the dessert, Fanny, that is sure to follow.'\r\n\r\n'Then you too, Len, you _want_ me to give up Landon?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, my dear, let Landon--slide.'\r\n\r\nFanny here boxed my ears with emphasis, and retreated, with an\r\nexpression of great disgust on her pretty face.\r\n\r\n'Come back here, my child,' I said, pulling her down on my knee, 'and\r\nlet me reason with you.'\r\n\r\nSuch an oracle as I am with the girls! There's nothing like it, Gustav;\r\nfor every fan or bracelet you give your sisters, you'll be amply\r\nrewarded by revelations and love; and it's something to have a dear,\r\nwhite, undulating wreath of a girl in your arms, and rosy lips on yours,\r\neven if it is your sister. Bless the sweet creatures!\r\n\r\n'What do you want to marry Snowe for?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you see, Len, it's so grand to have such a great beauty always at\r\none's hand, and the girls are all dying for him; and, you know, Len, the\r\ntruth is,' (very low,) 'he loves me, as you see, and--we girls are such\r\nsilly creatures--and I suppose the compliment pleases me,' and the\r\nfrank, darling face crimsoned, and tears stood in the blue eyes. I\r\nkissed them both, and laid her hands on my shoulders.\r\n\r\n'Pet,' I said, earnestly, 'you are worth a gross of Landon Snowes. He\r\nloves you, of course--he'd have been an icicle to have failed in so\r\nobvious a duty; but it's only a matter of pure admiration, scarcely of\r\nany complicated feelings. Besides, dear, these whitewashed, sinewless,\r\nvariable fellows fade like the winter sun, without any twilight; their\r\nfeatures go wandering off in search of becoming expressions, and they\r\nwould want a wife like a chameleon to satiate their variety-loving\r\nnatures. No, dear; give Landon to Henrietta, and when Napoleon comes\r\nback, I will enter no protest, even Harry will be silent, and'--\r\n\r\n'Oh, Len, what nonsense! couldn't you recommend me to the man in the\r\nmoon, through a telescope?'\r\n\r\nFanny laughed, and we went again into the library, where Harry, as\r\nusual, was tapping her rings with the carved handle of the crotchet\r\nneedle, that was as ornamental, and about as useful, as Cleopatra's.\r\n\r\n'I am going to live in a new country,' said she, gravely, as we entered\r\nthe room; 'I would go sailing off like a squirrel on a piece of bark. I\r\nbegin to have intense yearnings after my double. _Where_ do you suppose\r\nI'm to find him, the gorgeous, tropical anomaly?'\r\n\r\n'In Pompeii, or the Cities of the Plain?' I suggested.\r\n\r\n'Fanny,' she continued, laughingly, 'is very grave about her vanishing\r\nSnowe-flakes; but for poor me, who have been persecuted by the most\r\ndistressing men, she has no pity. Girls, I promised you an inventory of\r\nthese treasures.'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes,' said Fan, gleefully; 'go out, Len, or you will never be able\r\nto endure Harry afterward, for your counterpart will be peeping out, and\r\nthen woe to your pride!'\r\n\r\n'No danger,' said Henrietta, '_that's_ perfectly invulnerable. Lenox may\r\nremain; it will be a wholesome discipline for him--a warning, you know,\r\nmy hero; although, girls, Lenox is tolerably faultless,\r\n\r\n  'Little _he_ loves but a Frau or a feast,\r\n   Little he fears but a protest or priest.'\r\n\r\nPraed altered. Sit down, disciple, at my feet if you will; I am in the\r\noratorical mood to-day. Hypatia, if you please, _not_ Grace the Less.'\r\n\r\nThere was a pretty picture of the _Immaculée Conception_ over the sofa,\r\none of those lithographs that you see in every bookstore, that Bertha\r\nfancied because it was 'sweet.' The Virgin, a woman with a child-angel's\r\nface, and the mezzo-luna beneath her feet. That artist knew what he was\r\nabout, sir. I'd give more for a picture with a good, deep idea, boldly\r\nlaunched forth, than for a thousand of your smiling, proper, natural\r\n'studies,' and Bridal Scenes, and Dramatic or Historical Snatches. If\r\nartists, now, were all poets and scholars, as they should be, it would\r\nbe the work and delirious rapture of a life to go through a gallery as\r\nlarge as our Dusseldorf. Men would go there to write novels and\r\nhistories, and women to learn to be good and beautiful--that is, to\r\nlearn to think. Oh, what a school for great and small! But when is this\r\nnew era of the real and the true in art to begin? You boy artists, who\r\nare just opening glad eyes to the glorious light, the great world looks\r\nto _you_ to inaugurate the new, to pour ancient lore and mystic symbols\r\nand grand old art into the waiting crucible, and melt the whole, with\r\nyour burning, creative genius, into forms and conceptions before which,\r\nhearts shall be silent in very rapture. But the time is not yet. One\r\nhere and there cannot change the Iron to a Golden Age, and it is to\r\nthoughts rather than their great embodiments that earnest\r\nart-worshippers now bow. And yet men fancy they are artists, dream of a\r\nfame glorious as that of Phidias! Why there's young Acajou, who\r\nchiselled a very respectable hound out of a stray lump of marble,\r\nstealthily, by a candle, or more probably a spirit lamp, in his father's\r\ncellar--was discovered and straightway heroized. I don't say the boy\r\nhasn't talent, genius if you will; but it isn't the genius that will\r\noverflow his soul and etherealize his whole nature. Yet already he\r\n'progresses like a giantess,' has attracted some attention in the\r\nAcademy, and will directly be sent to Rome. But the idea! I know him too\r\nwell! The other night I heard him criticizing Michael Angelo! and when I\r\ngave him an engraving of that delicious Psyche of Theed's to admire, the\r\ncreature talked as if she were a manikin or a robed skeleton! Is there\r\nnothing due to the idea, Acajou? 'The idea!' dear me, why he didn't\r\nexactly know what the _idea_ was! So he'll go trolling about the Louvre\r\nand the Luxembourg gallery, the Pitti palace and all Rome, and his mind\r\nwill be as full of elbows and collar bones as the catacombs; he'll talk\r\nto you of the Grecian line of beauty and of 'pose,' and sketch you such\r\na glorious arm or ankle that you, fair lady, wouldn't know it from your\r\nown! But do you see a single softened line in his own face? Has he ever\r\ndrunk deep draughts from old fountains of poesy? Has he ever thought of\r\nthe Vatican library--even though to long is all he may do? Oh no! He\r\nsays mythology is a wornout dream, and insulting to a Christian age;\r\nthat it's all well enough to know Jupiter and Bacchus (Silenus too?) and\r\nVenus and the head men back there, but this century wants originality,\r\nprogress! Oh, pshaw!\r\n\r\nOh, but I was saying that Our Lady stood over the half moon, and\r\nHenrietta sat below it, with that soft cashmere morning dress, fighting\r\nall around her to see which fold should cling most lovingly to her\r\ngraceful form. It was all a delicious poem to me, and if I were Horace,\r\nyou would have had a splendid ode. Oh, well!\r\n\r\n'Why, what a Joseph he is!' said Henrietta, waking me out of this\r\nreverie.\r\n\r\n'Oh,' said I, starting, 'how did you know that?'\r\n\r\n'Only conjecture, my dear friend; but when we see a man with his eyes\r\nfixed in that ghostly way, and his mustaches and all in perfect repose,\r\nwe reasonably imagine that he's seeing visions; and I suppose you'll\r\ncome flaming out presently with some dreams that shall have, for remote\r\nconsequences, a throne in some Eastern paradise, and a princess,\r\nperhaps--who knows?'\r\n\r\n'Who knows?' echoed I; 'but go on, Hypatia.'\r\n\r\n'Oh yes! where shall I begin? Oh! there is Penhurst Lane, girls, you\r\nremember?'\r\n\r\n'The raven?' said Bertha.\r\n\r\n'No,' said Fanny, 'that is Mr. Rawdon. Penhurst Lane is an idealist.'\r\n\r\n'A _very_ idealist, just so,' returned Harry. 'Well, the way I've been a\r\nmartyr to that man's caprice is perfectly heart-rending. He came of some\r\ngorgeous family in the middle of Pennsylvania, where all the tribes,\r\nlike leaning towers, incline toward Germany. To be sure, you'd never\r\ndream it from his looks, for he is a perfect Mark Antony in that\r\nrespect. You needn't laugh. Didn't he have _bonnes fortunes_ as well as\r\nAlcibiades? Not that Penhurst had _bonnes fortunes_, or ever dreamed of\r\nsuch things; but he always had such a proclivity toward any one who\r\nwould listen to his harangues; and I must say, just _inter nos_ (the\r\nonly bit of Latin I know, Lenox, I got it from the English 'Don\r\nGiovanni'), that I have quite a talent for listening well. But I'd as\r\nlief encounter a West India hurricane or a simoom. I used to feel him\r\ncoming an hour beforehand. Then I would read a little in Blair, take a\r\npeep at Sir Charles Grandison, swallow half a page of Cowper's 'Task,'\r\nand look over the Grecian and Roman heroes; then I was fortified. 'Why\r\ndidn't I take Shelley?' Oh my! why, he couldn't endure Shelley, said he\r\nwas a poor, weak creature, _all gone to imagination_! Then I would\r\nassume a Sontag and thick boots, if the weather was cold, to appear\r\nsensible, you know, and await his coming; that is, if I didn't become\r\nexasperated before that stage, and rush in to see Lil Brennan to avoid\r\nhim. And his opinions, such an unfolding! You never caught him looking\r\nwith admiration, oh no! I might have laid a wilderness of charms on the\r\nfloor, at his very feet, and he would have brushed them all away with\r\nindifference. His mind revolved around a weightier theme than any 'lady\r\nof fashion;' like a newly discovered moon, he flew around the earth, and\r\nwith miraculous speed. He stopped in China to say 'Confucius;' in India,\r\nto say 'Brahma;' in Persia, to say 'Ormuzd;' and so on around. My dear\r\nLenox, if you had asked him whether Ormuzd was at peace with all the\r\nworld, he would have retired into himself, for he hadn't the faintest\r\nidea. As for music, or any fine art, he never approached it but once,\r\nwhen he led me to the piano, begging for some native American melody,\r\nand not a German romance. Well, I played him 'God save the Queen,' with\r\nextravagant variations, which he took for 'Yankee Doodle.' No matter! I\r\nmade a mistake when I spoke of his opinions; he hadn't any. He was what\r\nsome call 'well read,' that is, he had a distant desire to 'improve his\r\nmind,' but his magnificent self so filled his little vision, that his\r\ngreat desire was obscured and distorted. Like my beloved Jean Paul, he\r\nhad once said to himself, _Ich bin ein Ich_ (I am a ME), and the noble\r\nconsciousness overwhelmed him, and excluded all after thoughts on any\r\nminor subject. He never heard Grisi, never saw Rachel; they were\r\ntriflers, 'life was too grave, too short;' but he escorted me\r\noccasionally to lectures and orations. I remember two or three of these.\r\nA lecture on the 'Fossils of Humanity and Primeval Formations,' which\r\nwas unintelligible, consequently to him 'sublime;' one on 'the Exalted,'\r\nthat soared out of sight and beyond the empire of gravity, and one on\r\n'Architecture,' by Dr. Vinton, a splendid production, the fruit and\r\nevidence of years of study and rare talent, that sent me home with\r\nlongings and unaccustomed reverence for the Great in every form, and\r\nwith grief that my own ignorance rendered it only a half-enjoyed\r\npleasure to me; while Penhurst talked as if it were only the echo of his\r\nown thoughts; pretended to say it was very 'sensible!' But you've had\r\nenough of Mr. Lane, who was never known to laugh except at his own wit,\r\nwho patronized me because I was a 'solid' young lady, and not given to\r\nflights. You may readily imagine that our interviews were generally\r\n_tête-à-têtes_, for general society was to him a thing 'stale, flat, and\r\nunprofitable.' Of course you know I only endured his visits because\r\namong the girls it was considered a compliment to receive them, and they\r\nwere all dying of envy. Besides and principally, it is neither politic\r\nnor pleasant to offend any one, and I could not have denied myself to\r\nhim, without doing this; so'--\r\n\r\n'But, Harry, he is married now.'\r\n\r\n'Ah me! yes. He saw me in a cap and bells once with you, Lenox, and not\r\nmany weeks afterward married a damsel who reveres him as a Solon, this\r\nman, who said:\r\n\r\n         ----'The wanderings\r\n  Of this most intricate Universe\r\n  Teach me the nothingness of things.\r\n  Yet could not all creation pierce\r\n  Beyond the bottom of his eye.'\r\n\r\n'_Are_ you done, Harry?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Lenox.'\r\n\r\n'Then sing us Béranger's _Grace à la fêve, je suis roi_.'\r\n\r\nShe has such a delicious voice.\r\n\r\n'And while I am on tiresome people, who think only of themselves, let me\r\nrecall P. George Rawdon; the Raven, Bertha; I always believed his first\r\nname was Pluto, because of the shades around him. They say every one has\r\na text book; his was neither the Bible, the Prayer Book, Thomas à\r\nKempis, _La Nouvelle Héloise_, or 'Queechy,' but Mrs. Crowe's 'Night\r\nSide of Nature.' Talk of having a skeleton in the house! the most\r\ndistressing ones that ever preceded Douglas and Sherwood's were nothing\r\nto him! he reminded one constantly of an Egyptian feast. He looked\r\nsadly at children, and gave little Henry Parsons, his godchild, a\r\nminiature dagger with a jewelled handle, with which the child nearly\r\ndestroyed his right hand. When poor Mary was married, he walked\r\nmournfully up to the altar, and stared during the ceremony unmistakably\r\nat an imaginary coffin, hanging, like Mohammed's, midway between the\r\nceiling and the floor. Poor man, it's really curious, but he contrives\r\nto be always in mourning, and everybody knows that he goes only to see\r\ntragedies, and has the dyspepsia, like Regina and her diamond cross,\r\nfrom principle. He composes epitaphs for all the ladies of his\r\nacquaintance, and presents them, like newspaper-carrier addresses, on\r\nNew Year's days. I have one in my writing desk in a very secret drawer;\r\na _soul_-cheering effusion, but not particularly agreeable to the\r\nphysical humanity. This I intend to bequeath to the British museum,\r\nwhere it will be in future ages as great a treat to the antiquary as the\r\nElgin marbles. What a doleful subject--pass him by!'\r\n\r\n'Don't forget Leon Channing,' suggested Fanny, who was listening with\r\ngreat interest, and from a natural dread of ghosts and vampires was glad\r\nto see that Mr. Rawdon had come to a crisis.\r\n\r\n'Dear me, no!' said Henrietta, cheerily, 'it's quite refreshing to come\r\nto an individual who creates a smile. I never was born for tears and\r\nlamentations, Bertha, any more than a lily was made to be merry; and if\r\nit were not for Len Channing, I don't suppose I should ever have been\r\nsharpened to such a dangerous degree; it's this constant friction, you\r\nknow; well, as some darling of a cosmopolite has said, 'We must allow\r\nfor friction in the most perfect machinery--yes, be glad to find it--for\r\na certain degree of resistance is essential to strength. I like Leon\r\nvery well. No one is more safe in a parlor engagement, always in the\r\nright place at the right tune, never embarrassed, never _de trop_; but\r\nthen the queer consciousness, when he's giving you a meringué or an ice,\r\nthat if you were a 'real pretty,' graceful, conversible fawn or dove he\r\nwould be doing it with the same interest! _Why?_ Oh, because he says\r\nwomen belong to a lower order in the animal creation! Yes, veil your\r\nface, Mr. Lenox Raleigh, and be mournful that you are a man! 'A lower\r\norder of humanity!' Well, of course, I'm always quarrelling with him. To\r\nbe sure he's a shallow kind of a philosopher, one of your rationalists;\r\nthinks Boston is the linchpin of the whole universe; has autograph\r\nletters from Emerson and Longfellow, and all that sort of thing. Now, I\r\ndare say it's very fine for a Schelling or a Hegel once in a while to\r\nbeam over the earth, but it always seems inharmonious to me to see\r\nlittle jets of philosophers popping up in your face and then down again,\r\nall the time, thinking themselves great things. That's the way with\r\nLeon. Let me tell you what happened when I saw him last; and that was in\r\nCologne, more than a year ago. I was sitting in our room with a great\r\nfolio of Retzsch's engravings before me, and father writing horrible\r\nnotes in his journal at the table, and wishing the eleven thousand\r\nvirgins and all Cologne in the bottom of the Rhine, when I looked up,\r\nand somehow there was Leon. Of course we were rejoiced to see him, it's\r\nalways so pleasant to meet friends abroad. After some talk, father went\r\nout to take another look at the cathedral, and indulge in speculations\r\nand legends, and left Leon and me in the window. It's as queer and\r\nhorrible an old town, girls, as you ever dreamed of, and, as there was\r\nnothing external very fascinating, Leon soon turned his gaze inward,\r\nand, after twanging several minor strings, began to harp on his endless\r\n'inferiority of woman.' I plied him, you may know; I gave him Zenobias\r\nand Didos and de Staels and de Medicis--in an emergency Pope Joan, and\r\nfinally the Boston Margaret Fuller. Leon only stroked his beard and\r\nsmiled.\r\n\r\n''Miss Henrietta,' said he, at last, when I stopped in exultation, 'do\r\nyou grant the Africans the vigor or variety of intellect of the\r\nEuropeans?'\r\n\r\n''No,' said I.\r\n\r\n''Yet you concede that there may be instances among them, where\r\neducation and culture have developed great results.'\r\n\r\n''Yes,' I thought, 'there might be.'\r\n\r\n''Just as I, bewildered by Miss Henrietta's keen shafts and graceful\r\nmanoeuvres, yield that a woman is, once in a century, gifted with a\r\nman's depth of thought and her sex's loveliness.' The comparison was\r\nodious. What did I do? Oh, I (the swarthy Ethiop) only rose from my\r\nfaded arm chair, saluted Mr. Channing (the lordly European) as if I were\r\nhis partner in a quadrille, and brought out my cameos and mosaics to\r\nshow him. In about half an hour the beauty of his reasoning and\r\ncomparison reached his brain, but mine was impenetrable to his most\r\nhoneyed apologies; as I very sweetly assured him, 'I couldn't\r\nunderstand, didn't see the drift, couldn't connect the links.' Leon says\r\nancient history is a fable, and Herodotus a myth, and all because a\r\n_woman_ sat upon the tripod at Delphi, and because a _woman_ wore the\r\nhelmet and carried the shield of wisdom.'\r\n\r\n'What's the matter, Harry?' asked Fanny, compassionately, as her small\r\nfingers were stretched like infant grid-irons before her eyes, and a\r\nsilence ensued.\r\n\r\n'My new bonnet, Fanny dear, I am wondering what it shall be; we must go\r\ndown this very morning and decide.'\r\n\r\nDid you ever think, Narcissus, and you, Gustav, and all of you boys,\r\nwhen you are engaged in your small diplomacies and _coups de main_, and\r\nfeeling like giants in intellect beside the dear little girls who play\r\npolkas for you of evenings and sing sweet ballads, that _pour bien juger\r\nles grands, il faut les approcher_? I thought so that morning, as I\r\nheard the animated discussion that succeeded Henrietta's monologue; a\r\ndiscussion into which all sorts of delicate conceits of lace and flowers\r\nentered largely, and which savored about as much of the preceding\r\nelements as last night's Charlotte Russe of this morning's coffee.\r\n\r\nSince Henrietta's oration, I am more than ever afraid of a Vulcan. It is\r\nvery plain that our most fashionably cut suits and most delicately\r\nperfumed billets are not all powerful,--that the dear creatures are\r\neither waking or we have been asleep. _Reveillons!_\r\n\r\n'_Aux armes, citoyens!_'\r\n\r\nNow, while I was writing that last word, a heavy hand was laid on my\r\nshoulder, and looking up, I saw--Nap. I love Nap. I have a girlish\r\nweakness (let some lady arraign me for this hereafter) for him; so I\r\nshouted out and grasped his hands.\r\n\r\n'How are the boys?'\r\n\r\n'Flourishing. Come to stay?\r\n\r\n'Yes, old fellow.'\r\n\r\n'Stocks up?'\r\n\r\n'To the sky.'\r\n\r\n'The governor?'\r\n\r\n'All right.'\r\n\r\n_I_ haven't any governor. Nap has; and one that saw fit to persecute him\r\nfrom twenty to thirty, because he declined to take 'orders.' _Per\r\nBacco!_ Never mind, a fit of paralysis has shaken the opposition out of\r\nthe old gentleman at last, and Nap is in sunshine in consequence, and\r\nrushes around Wall street like a veteran.\r\n\r\nBut I didn't promise to tell you about Nap, or the girls either; it was\r\nonly a few rays of light I had to dash over 'our beaux;' so where is\r\nyour mother, belle Beatrice? I must make my adieux.\r\n\r\nWhat say you, little one? You like Henrietta; you want to see her again?\r\nYou pull me back with your wee white hands; I will talk to you for an\r\nhour longer, if I may hold the little kittens in my own. I may? And kiss\r\neach finger afterward? Ah! you dear child! Well, then--\r\n\r\n'Are you going to Van Wyck's to-night, Lenox?' asked Bertha of me, as we\r\nrose from dinner, a month afterward.\r\n\r\n'Yes, after the opera. And you? I fancy--yes--from your eyes.'\r\n\r\nBertha did not answer, and I strolled up stairs into the little back\r\ndrawing room. From the library above I could hear Fanny's merry voice\r\nand the ring of Nap's cheery replies. Such a comfort as it was to me to\r\nsee those two so fond of each other. You see I am, in a way, Fanny's\r\nfather, and took no very great credit to myself when she half laid her\r\nhand in the extended one of Snowe. How curiously that witch Harry\r\nmanaged the thing, though! Dear little Fan; she stood in more than one\r\ntwilight by the garden window, and whispered over: '_Addio_, FRANCESCA!\r\n_addio_, CECCO!' and Snowe faded in the returning spring of her heart,\r\nand into the blooming vista of their separation, hopefully walked Nap,\r\nand was welcomed with many smiles.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, I walked over to the garden window, and there was Harry,\r\nscrawling an old, bearded hermit on the glass with her diamond ring. We\r\nboth looked out--nothing much to see--a New York garden, thirty feet\r\nsquare, with the usual gorgeousness of our winter flowers!\r\n\r\n'You are thinking of Shiraz, Harry.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said she, dreamily, 'I am thinking of Shiraz!'\r\n\r\nShe didn't say it, but don't you suppose I knew just as well that she\r\nwas wishing for her Vulcan and a great rose garden? I began to sing the\r\n'Last Man,' but didn't succeed admirably; then I lighted my pipe--Harry\r\ndidn't mind, you know, indeed she only looked at it wishfully.\r\n\r\n'In my rose garden,' said she, with a laugh, 'I shall smoke to kill the\r\nrosebugs.'\r\n\r\n'Don't wait,' said I, taking down a dainty _écume de mer_ (the back\r\ndrawing room was my peculiar 'study,' and the repository of several\r\ngentlemanly 'improprieties'), and I adjusted the amber mouth piece to\r\nthe cherry stem, 'Don't wait for Persia, make your rose garden here.'\r\n\r\nHarry shook her head: 'You know, Len,' she said, 'that my roses would\r\ngrow like so many witches in a Puritan soil. I always thought that story\r\nof the Norwegians' taking rosebuds for bulbs of fire, and being\r\nterrified, was a very delicate and poetical satire upon _all_\r\nsuperstition.'\r\n\r\n'Are you going to wash away _all_ superstition?' I asked hastily.\r\n\r\n'No,' said she, with a smile at my fierceness; 'no, I like to see the\r\nsun shine on the dew drops that the webs catch and swing between the\r\ntops of the grasses.'\r\n\r\nI looked at her as she laid her head back against the curtains. My\r\nnonchalance was as striking as hers, and--as genuine! We were no\r\nchildren to be awkward in any event. I took her hand; it was a glowing\r\npulse--and mine? She wore one of those curious little cabal rings; there\r\nwere the Hebrew characters for Faith, traced as with a gold pen dipped\r\nin melted pearls on black enamel. My seal was an emerald, Faith also,\r\nimpaled. I snatched it up and laid it by the ring on her hand. She\r\nsmiled--such a smile! intensest sympathy, deepest! Could it be? to love\r\nthe same old symbols, the same weird music? I caught her close, and bent\r\nover her lips. The gold hair waved over my shoulder; the great,\r\nglittering eyes foamed into mine, then melted and swam into deep,\r\nquivering seas of dreams. I whispered, '_Zoe mou!_' Oh, the quick,\r\ngolden whisper, the flash of genial heartiness, the daring--oh, _how_\r\ntender! '_Sas agapo._' I held her off, radiant, glowing, fragrant, and\r\nBertha's dress rustled up the stairs.\r\n\r\nHenrietta stooped to pick up the seal, which had fallen; she balanced it\r\non the tip of her finger--the nervy Titan queen! and drew Bertha down by\r\nher side on the sofa. It was growing dark.\r\n\r\n'I must be off, girls, and get your camelias. What will you have,\r\nBertha? a red or a white, you've a moment to decide?'\r\n\r\n'Neither, Len; I do not go.'\r\n\r\n'Why, Bertha? Oh! I remember, it is your anniversary,' and I kissed her.\r\n\r\n'And you, princess!' I turned to Henrietta.\r\n\r\n'Only roses, good my liege.'\r\n\r\nWhat was the opera that night? Pshaw! what a rhetorical affectation this\r\nquestion! as if I could ever forget! _Die Zauberflöte_, and it rang pure\r\nand clear through my thrilled heart. It followed me around to Van\r\nWyck's, where I found Henrietta and Fanny. A compliment to madame, a\r\nGerman with mademoiselle, and home again. A great light streamed out of\r\nthe drawing room. I pushed the door open. With a cry of joy, Fan rushed\r\ninto the arms of the grave, fair man who put Bertha off his knee to\r\nwelcome her. Nap, who had followed us in, for a moment stood transfixed,\r\nand Henrietta, more quiet, stood by their side, saying: 'Here is Harry,\r\nFred, when you choose to see her.' And he did choose, her own brother,\r\nwhom she had not seen for three years!\r\n\r\n'Come in, Nap,' I said. 'Fred Ruyter.'\r\n\r\n'Nap and Fanny,' I whispered; Fred smiled invisibly.\r\n\r\nAnd Bertha? Oh, you know, of course, that she's Bertha Ruyter, and that\r\nFred is her husband, just home from six months in Rio, and exactly a\r\nyear from his wedding night! Oh, Lionardo! what mellow, transparent,\r\nflowing shades drowned us all that night!\r\n\r\n'Harry,' I said, the next morning, before I went down town, as I lounged\r\nover her sofa, 'you have my emerald?'\r\n\r\n'Yes!' and her bright face turned up to mine.\r\n\r\n'You will keep it, and take me also, dear?'\r\n\r\n'_Ma foi! oui_,' was the sweet, smiling reply.\r\n\r\n'I'm not quite ugly enough for a Vulcan, I know; but after a while, if\r\nyou are patient, who knows? What sayest thou, Venus?'\r\n\r\n'I will try you, _bon camarade_.'\r\n\r\n'Your hand upon it, Harry.'\r\n\r\nShe gave it; I kissed the gold hair that waved against my lips. Fanny\r\nrushed impetuously upon us, with half-opened eyes, and stifled us with\r\ncaresses.\r\n\r\n'Such a proposal,' said she musingly, after she had returned to her\r\nwools and beads, '14° above zero!'\r\n\r\n'And the Polyphemus, Fanny?'\r\n\r\n'Is for Nap,' and Fanny blushed and laughed. She was wondering if that\r\ngreat event, an 'engagement,' always came about in so prosaic a way. But\r\nlooking at Bertha, I caught the bright, long, gravely humorous gleam\r\nfrom her dark eyes, and walked upon it all the way down to Exchange\r\nPlace.\r\n\r\nAdieu, little Beatrice; my story hath at last an ending. Keep the little\r\nhands and little heart warm for somebody brave by and by. Go shining\r\nabout and dancing, and smiling, Hummingbird; may sweetest flowers always\r\nbloom around you; may you dwell in a fragrant rose garden of your own,\r\n_mignonne_! Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETHEL.\r\n\r\nFITZ FASHION'S WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Take the diamonds from my forehead--their chill weight but frets my brow!\r\n  How they glitter! radiant, faultless--but they give no pleasure now.\r\n\r\n  Once they might have saved a Poet, o'er whose bed the violet waves:\r\n  Now their lustre chills my spirit, like the light from new-made graves.\r\n\r\n  Quick! unbind the braided tresses of my coroneted hair!\r\n  Let it fall in single ringlets such as I was wont to wear.\r\n\r\n  Take that wreath of dewy violets, twine it round their golden flow;\r\n  Let the perfumed purple blossoms fall upon my brow of snow!\r\n\r\n  Simple flowers, ye gently lead me back into the sunny years,\r\n  Ere I wore proud chains of diamonds, forged of bitter, frozen tears!\r\n\r\n  Bring the silver mirror to me! I am changed since those bright days,\r\n  When I lived with my sweet mother, and a Poet sang my praise.\r\n\r\n  My blue eyes are larger, dimmer; thicker lashes veil their light;\r\n  Upon my cheek the crimson rose fast is fading to the white.\r\n\r\n  I am taller, statelier, slighter, than I was in days of yore:--\r\n  If his eyes in heaven behold me, does he praise me as before?\r\n\r\n  Proudly swells the silken rustle--all around is wealth and state,--\r\n  Dearer far the early roses twining round the wicker gate,\r\n\r\n  Where my mother came at evening with the saint-like forehead pale,\r\n  And the Poet sat beside her, conning o'er his rhythmed tale.\r\n\r\n  As he read the linked lines over, she would sanction, disapprove:\r\n  Soft and musical the pages, but he never sang of love.\r\n\r\n  I had lived through sixteen summers, he was only twenty-one,\r\n  And we three still sat together at the hour of setting sun.\r\n\r\n  Lowly was the forest cottage, but the sweetbrier wreathed it well;\r\n  'Mid its violets and roses, bees and robins loved to dwell.\r\n\r\n  Wilder forms of larch and hemlock climbed the mountain at its side;\r\n  Fairy-like a rill came leaping where the quivering harebells sighed.\r\n\r\n  Glittering, bounding, singing, dancing, ferns and mosses loved its track;\r\n  Lower in it dipped the willows, as to kiss the cloudland's rack.\r\n\r\n  Soon there came a stately lover,--praised my beauty, softly smiled:\r\n  'He would make my mother happy,'--I was but a silly child!\r\n\r\n  Came a dream of sudden power--fairest visions o'er me glide--\r\n  Wider spheres would open for me;--dazzled, I became a bride:\r\n\r\n  Fondly deemed my lonely mother would be freed from sordid care;\r\n  Splendor I might pour around her, every joy with her might share.\r\n\r\n  Then the Poet, who had never breathed one word of love to me,--\r\n  We might shape his life-course for him, give him culture wide and free.\r\n\r\n  How I longed to turn the pages, with a husband's hand as guide,\r\n  Of the long-past golden ages, art and science at my side!\r\n\r\n  To my simple fancy seemed it almost everything he knew--\r\n  Ah! he might have won affection, faithful, fervent, trusting, true!\r\n\r\n  I was happy, never dreaming wealth congeals the human soul,\r\n  Freezing all its generous impulse--I but saw its wide control.\r\n\r\n  Years have passed--a larger culture poured strange knowledge through\r\n    my mind--\r\n  I have learned to read man's nature: better I were ever blind!\r\n\r\n  How can I take upon me what I look upon with scorn,\r\n  Or learn to brook my own contempt, or trample the forlorn?\r\n\r\n  I cannot live by rote and rule; I was not born a slave\r\n  To narrow fancies; I must feel, although a husband rave!\r\n\r\n  I cannot choose my friends because I know them rich, or great;\r\n  My heart elects the noble,--what cares love for wealth or state?\r\n\r\n  Very lovely are my pictures, saints and angels throng my hall--\r\n  But with shame my cheek is flushing, and my quivering lashes fall:\r\n\r\n  Can I gaze on pictured actions, daring deeds, and emprise high,\r\n  And not feel my degradation while these fetters round me lie?\r\n\r\n  Once the Poet came to see me, but it gave me nought but pain;\r\n  I was glad to see the Gifted go, ne'er to return again.\r\n\r\n  For my husband scorning told me: 'True, his lines were very sweet,\r\n  But his clothes, so worn and seedy--scarce for me acquaintance meet!\r\n\r\n  Artists, poets, men of genius, truly should be better paid,\r\n  But not holding our position, cannot be our friends,' he said.\r\n\r\n  'As gentlemen to meet them were a very curious thing;\r\n  They were happier in their garrets--there let them sigh or sing.\r\n\r\n  There were Travers and De Courcy--could he ask them home to dine,\r\n  At the risk of meeting truly such strange fellows o'er their wine?'\r\n\r\n  Then he said, 'My cheeks were peachy, lips were coral, curls were gold,\r\n  But he liked them braided crown-like, and with pearls and diamonds\r\n    rolled.\r\n\r\n  I was once a little peasant; now I stood a jewelled queen--\r\n  Fitter that a calmer presence in his stately wife were seen!'\r\n\r\n  Then he gave a gorgeous card-case; set with rubies, Roman gold,\r\n  Handed me a paper with it, strands of pearls around it rolled;\r\n\r\n  Names of all his wife should visit I would find upon the roll:--\r\n  Found I none I loved within it--not one friend upon the scroll!\r\n\r\n  And my mother, God forgive me! I was glad to see her go,\r\n  Ere the current of her loving heart had turned like mine to snow.\r\n\r\n  Must I still seem fair and stately, choking down my bosom's strife,\r\n  Because 'all deep emotions were unseemly in his wife'?\r\n\r\n  Must I gasp 'neath diamonds' glitter--walk in lustrous silken sheen--\r\n  Leaving those I love in anguish while I play some haughty scene?\r\n\r\n  I am choking! closer round me crowds convention's stifling vault--\r\n  Every meanness's called a virtue--every virtue deemed a fault!\r\n\r\n  Every generous thought is scandal; every noble deed is crime;\r\n  Every feeling's wrapped in fiction, and truth only lives in rhyme!\r\n\r\n  No;--I am not fashion's minion,--I am not convention's slave!\r\n  If 'obedience is for woman,' still she has a soul to save.\r\n\r\n  Must I share their haughty falsehood, take my part in social guile,\r\n  Cut my dearest friends, and stab them with a false, deceitful smile?\r\n\r\n  Creeping like a serpent through me, faint, I feel a deadly chill,\r\n  Freezing all the good within me, icy fetters chain my will.\r\n\r\n  Do I grow like those around me? will I learn to bear my part\r\n  In this glittering world of fashion, taming down a woman's heart?\r\n\r\n  Must I lower to my husband? is it duty to abate\r\n  All the higher instincts in me, till I grow his fitting mate?\r\n\r\n  Shall I muse on noble pictures, turn the poet's stirring page,\r\n  And grow base and mean in action, petty with a petty age?\r\n\r\n  I am heart-sick, weary, weary! tell me not that this life,\r\n  Where all that's truly living must be pruned by fashion's knife!--\r\n\r\n  I can make my own existence--spurn his gifts, and use my hands,\r\n  Though the senseless world of fashion for the deed my memory brands.\r\n\r\n  Quick! unbraid the heavy tresses of my coroneted hair--\r\n  Let its gold fall in _free_ ringlets such as I was wont to wear.\r\n\r\n  I am going back to nature. I no more will school my heart\r\n  To stifle its best feelings, play an idle puppet's part.\r\n\r\n  I will seek my banished mother, nestle closely on her breast;\r\n  Noble, faithful, kind, and loving, there the tortured one may rest.\r\n\r\n  We will turn the Poets' pages, learn the noblest deeds to act,\r\n  Till the fictions in their beauty shall be lived as simple fact.\r\n\r\n  I will mould a living statue, make it generous, strong, and high,\r\n  Humble, meek, self-abnegating, formed to meet the Master's eye.\r\n\r\n  Oh, the glow of earnest culture! Oh, the joy of sacrifice!\r\n  The delight to help another! o'er all selfish thoughts to rise!\r\n\r\n  Farewell, cold and haughty splendor--how you chilled me when a bride!\r\n  Hollow all your mental efforts; meanness all your dazzling pride!\r\n\r\n  Put the diamonds in their caskets! pearls and rubies, place them there!\r\n  I shall never sigh to wear them with the violets in my hair.\r\n\r\n  Freedom! with no eye upon me freezing all my fiery soul;\r\n  Free to follow nature's dictates; free from all save God's control.\r\n\r\n  I am going to the cottage, with its windows small and low,\r\n  Where the sweetbrier twines its roses and the Guelder rose its snow.\r\n\r\n  I will climb the thymy mountains where the pines in sturdy might\r\n  Follow nature's holy bidding, growing ever to the light;\r\n\r\n  Tracking down the leaping streamlet till the willows on it rise,\r\n  Watch its broad and faithful bosom strive to mirror back the skies.\r\n\r\n  Through the wicker gate at evening with my mother I will come,\r\n  With a little book, the Poet's, to read low at set of sun.\r\n\r\n  'Tis a gloomy, broken record of a love poured forth in death,\r\n  Generous, holy, and devoted, sung with panting, dying breath.\r\n\r\n  By the grassy mound we'll read it where he calmly sleeps in God,--\r\n  My gushing tears may stream above--they cannot pierce the sod!\r\n\r\n  Hand in hand we'll sit together by the lowly mossy grave--\r\n  Oh, God! I blazed with jewels, but the noble dared not save!\r\n\r\n  I am going to the cottage, there to sculpture my own soul,\r\n  Till it fill the high ideal of the Poet's glowing roll.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Stay, lovely dream! I waken! hear the clanking of my chain!\r\n  Feel a hopeless vow is on me--I can ne'er be free again!\r\n\r\n  His wife! I've sworn it truly! I must bear his freezing eye,\r\n  Feel his blighting breath upon me while all nobler instincts die!\r\n\r\n  Feel the Evil gain upon me as the weary moments glide,\r\n  Till I hiss, a jewelled serpent, fit companion, at his side.\r\n\r\n  Vain is struggle--vain is writhing--vain are sobs and stifled gasps--\r\n  I must wear my brilliant fetters though my life-blood stain their clasps!\r\n\r\n  Hark! he calls! tear out the violets! quick! the diamonds in my hair!\r\n  There's a ball to-night at Travers'--'tis his will I should be there.\r\n\r\n  Splendid victim in his pageant, though my tortured head should ache,\r\n  Yet I must be brilliant, joyous, if my throbbing heart should break!\r\n\r\n  I shudder! quick! my dress of rose, my tunic of point lace--\r\n  If fine enough, he will not read the anguish in my face!\r\n\r\n  I know one place he dare not look--it is so still and deep--\r\n  He dare not lift the winding sheet that veils my last, long sleep!\r\n\r\n  He dreads the dead! the coffin lid will shield me from his breath--\r\n  His eye no more will torture----Joy! I shall be free in death!\r\n\r\n  Free to rest beside the Poet. He will shun the lowly grave:\r\n  There my mother soon will join us, and the violets o'er us wave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SKEPTICS OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that while, in a republic, which is the mildest form of\r\ngovernment, respect for law and order are most highly developed, there\r\nis in an aristocracy (which is always the most deeply based form of\r\ntyranny) a constant revolt against all law. Puritanism in England,\r\nPietism in Germany, and Huguenotism in France, were all directly and\r\nstrongly republican and law-abiding in their social relations; while for\r\nan example of the contrary we need only glance at our own South.\r\nAristocracy--a regularly ordered system of society into ranks--is the\r\ndream of the slaveholder, and experience is showing us how extremely\r\ndifficult it is to uproot the power of a very few wicked men who have\r\nfairly mudsilled the majority; and yet, despite this strength, there was\r\nnever yet a country claiming to be civilized, in which the wild caprices\r\nand armed outrages of the individual were regarded with such toleration.\r\n\r\n_Republicanism is Christian._ When will the world see this tremendous\r\ntruth as it should, and realize that as there is a present and a future,\r\nso did the Saviour lay down one law whereby man might progress in this\r\nlife, and another for the attainment of happiness in the next, and that\r\nthe two are mutually sustaining? There was no real republicanism before\r\nthe Gospels, and there has been no real addition to the doctrine since.\r\nThe instant that religion or any great law of truth falls into the hands\r\nof a high caste, and puts on its livery, it becomes--ridiculous. What\r\nthink you of a shepherd's crook of gold blazing with diamonds?\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to trace an excellent illustration of the natural\r\naffinity between the fondness for feudalism and the love of law-breaking\r\nin Sir WALTER SCOTT. Whatever his head and his natural common sense\r\ndictated (and as he was a canny Scot and a shrewd observer, they\r\ndictated many wise truths), his heart was always with the men of bow and\r\nbrand; with dashing robbers, moss troopers, duellists, wild-eagle\r\nbarons, wild-wolf borderers, and the whole farrago of autocratic\r\nscoundrelism. With his soul devoted to dreams of feudalism, his fond\r\nlove of its romance was principally based on the constant infractions of\r\nlaw and order to which a state of society must always be subject in\r\nwhich certain men acquire power out of proportion to their integrity.\r\nThe result of this always is a lurking sympathy with rascality, a secret\r\nrelish for bold selfishness, which is in every community the deadliest\r\npoison of the rights of the poor, and all the disinherited by fortune.\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable that Walter Scott, a Tory to the soul, should, by\r\nhis apparently contradictory yet still most consistent love of the\r\n_outré_, have had a keen amateur sympathy for outlaws. It is much more\r\nremarkable, however, that, still retaining his faith in king and nobles,\r\nChurch and State, he should have pushed his appreciation of such men to\r\nthe degree of marvellously comprehending--nay, enjoying--certain types\r\nof skepticism which sprang up in fiercest opposition to authority; urged\r\ninto existence by its abuses, as germs of plants have been thought to be\r\nelectrified into life by sharp blows. And it is most remarkable of all,\r\nthat he did this at a time when none among his English readers seem to\r\nhave had any comprehension whatever of these characters, or to have\r\nsurmised the fact that to merely understand and depict them, the writer\r\nmust have ventured into fearful depths of reflection and of study. In\r\ntreating these characters, Walter Scott seems to become positively\r\n_subjective_--and I will venture to say that it is the only instance of\r\nthe slightest approach to anything of the kind to be found in all his\r\nwritings. Unlike Byron, who was painfully conscious, not of the nature\r\nof his want in this respect, but of _something_ wanting, Scott nowhere\r\nelse betrays the slightest consciousness of his continual life under\r\nlimitations, when, _plump!_ we find him making a headlong leap right\r\ninto the very centre of that terrible pool whose waters feed the\r\nforbidden-fruit tree of good and of evil.\r\n\r\nThe characters to which I particularly refer in Sir Walter Scott's\r\nnovels are those of the Templar, Brian de Bois Guilbert, in 'Ivanhoe;'\r\nof the gypsy Hayraddin Maugrabin in 'Quentin Durward;' of Dryfesdale,\r\nthe steward, in 'The Abbot;' and of the 'leech' Henbane Dwining, in 'The\r\nFair Maid of Perth.' There are several others which more or less\r\nresemble these, as, for instance, Ranald Mac Eagh, the Child of the\r\nMist, in 'Montrose,' and Rashleigh, in 'Rob Roy;' but the latter,\r\nconsidered by themselves, are only partly developed. In fact, if Scott\r\nhad given to the world only _one_ of these outlaws of faith, there would\r\nhave been but little ground for inferring that his mind had ever taken\r\nso daring a range as I venture to claim for him. It is in his constant,\r\nwistful return, in one form or the other, to that terrible type of\r\nhumanity--the man who, as a matter of intensely sincere faith, has freed\r\nhimself from all adherence to the laws of man or GOD--that we find the\r\nclue to the _real_ nature of the author's extraordinary sympathy for the\r\nmost daring, yet most subtle example of the law-breaker. In comparing\r\nthese characters carefully, we find that each by contrast appears far\r\nmore perfect than when separate--as the bone, which, however excellent\r\nits state of preservation may be, never seems to the eye of the\r\nphysiologist so complete as when in its place in the complete skeleton.\r\nAnd through this contrast we learn that Scott, having by sympathy and\r\nhistorical-romantic study, comprehended the lost secret of all\r\n_illuminée_ mysteries--that of human dependence on nought save the laws\r\nof a mysterious and terrible Nature--could not refrain from ever and\r\nanon whispering the royal secret, though it were only to the rustling\r\nreeds and rushes of fashionable novels. Having learned, though in an\r\nillegitimate way, that the friend of PAN, the great king of the golden\r\ntouch, had ass's ears, he _must_ tell it again, though in murmurs and\r\nwhispers:\r\n\r\n             'Qui cum ne prodere visum\r\n  Dedecus auderet, cupiens efferre sub auras,\r\n  Nec posset reticere tamen, secedit, humumque\r\n  Effodit: et domini quales aspexerit aures,\r\n  Vox refert parva; terræque immurmurat haustæ.'[10]\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked, in studying collectively these outlaws as set\r\nforth by Scott, that while the same characteristic lies at the basis of\r\neach, there is very great variety in its development, and that the\r\nauthor seems to have striven to present it in as many widely differing\r\nphases as he was capable of doing. When we reflect that Scott himself\r\ncould not be fairly said to be perfectly _at home_ in more than half a\r\ndozen departments of history, and yet that he has taken pains to set\r\nforth as many historical varieties of minds absolutely emancipated from\r\nall faith, and finally, when we recall that at the time when he wrote,\r\nthe great proportion of the characteristics of these _dramatis personæ_\r\nwere utterly unappreciated, and that by even the learned they were\r\nsimply reviewed as 'infidels,' we cannot but smile at the care with\r\nwhich (like the sculptor in the old story) he carved his images, and\r\nburied them to be dug up at a future day by men who, as he possibly\r\nhoped, would appreciate more fully than did his contemporaries his own\r\ndegree of forbidden knowledge. I certainly do not exaggerate the\r\nimportance of these characters when speaking in this manner. They could\r\nnot have been conceived without a very great expenditure of study and of\r\nreflection. They are, as I said, subjective, and such portraits of\r\nhumanity always involve a vastly greater amount of penetrative and\r\nlong-continued thought, than do the mere historical and social\r\nphotographs which constitute the bulk of Scott's, as of all novels, and\r\nform the favorites of the mass of readers for entertainment.\r\n\r\nFirst among these characters, and most important as indicating direct\r\nhistorical familiarity with the obscure subject of the Oriental heresies\r\nof the Middle Ages in Europe, I would place that of the Templar, Brian\r\nde Bois Guilbert, who is generally regarded by readers as simply 'a\r\nhorrid creature,' who chased 'that darling Rebecca' out of the window to\r\nthe verge of the parapet; or at best as a knightly ruffian, who, like\r\nmost ruffianly sinners, quieted conscience by stifling it with doubt.\r\nVery different, however, did the Templar appear to Scott himself, who,\r\nnotwithstanding the poetic justice meted to the knight, evidently\r\nsympathized in secret more warmly with him than with any other character\r\nin the gorgeous company of 'Ivanhoe.' Among them all he is the only one\r\nwho fully and fairly appreciates the intellect of Rebecca, and, seen\r\nfrom the stand-point of rigid historical probability which Scott would\r\nnot violate, _all allowance being made for what the Templar was_, he\r\nappears by far the noblest and most intelligent of all the knightly\r\nthrong. I say that though a favorite, Scott would not to favor him,\r\nviolate historical probability. Why should he? It formed no part of his\r\nplan to give the public of his day lessons in _illuminée_-ism. Had he\r\ndone so he would have failed like 'George Sand' in 'Consuelo;' but a\r\nvery small proportion indeed of whose readers retain a recollection of\r\nthe doctrines which it is the main object of the book to set forth. I\r\ntrust there is no slander in the remark, but I _must_ believe it to be\r\ntrue until I see that the majority of the readers of that work have also\r\ntaken to zealously investigating the sources of that most forbidden\r\nlore, which has most certainly this peculiarity, that no one can\r\n_comprehend_ it ever so little without experiencing an insatiable,\r\nnever-resting desire to exhaust it, like everything which is prohibited.\r\nThere is no such thing as knowing it a little. As one of its sages said\r\nof old, its knowledge rushes forth into infinite lands.\r\n\r\nIt was, I believe, some time before 'Ivanhoe' appeared, that Baron von\r\nHammer Purgstall had published his theory that the Knights Templars\r\nwere, although most unjustly treated, still guilty, in a certain sense,\r\nof the extraordinary charges brought against them. It seems at least to\r\nbe tolerably certain that during their long residence in the East they\r\nhad acquired the Oriental secrets of initiation into societies which\r\ntaught the old serpent-lore of _eritis sicut Deus_, and positive\r\nknowledge; the ultimate secret, being the absolute nothingness of all\r\nfaith, creeds, laws, ties, or rules to him who is capable of rising\r\nabove them and of drawing from Nature by an 'enlightened' study of her\r\nlaws the principles of action, of harmony with fellow men, and of\r\nunlimited earthly enjoyment. Such had been for ages the last lessons of\r\nall the 'mysteries' of the East--mysteries which it was the peculiar\r\ndestiny of the Hebrew race to resist through ages of struggle. It was\r\nthrough the teaching of such mysteries of pantheistic naturalism that,\r\nas the unflinching Jewish deists and anthropomorphists believed, man\r\nfell, and their belief was set forth in their very first religious\r\ntradition--the history of the apple, the serpent, and the Fall. And it\r\nis to the very extraordinary nature of the Hebrew race, by which they\r\npresented for the first time in history the spectacle of a people\r\nresisting nature-worship, that they owe their claim to be a peculiar\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe Templars, under the glowing skies of the East, among its thousand\r\ntemptations, those of superior knowledge not being the least; in an age\r\nwhen the absurdities of the Roman church were, to an enlightened mind,\r\nat their absurdest pitch, fell readily into 'illumination.' Whether they\r\nliterally _worshipped_ the Oriental Baphomet, a figure with two heads,\r\nmale and female, girt with a serpent, typifying the completest\r\nabnegation of all moral relations, and the rights of knowledge, no one\r\ncan say now--it is, however, significant that this symbol, which they\r\nundoubtedly used, actually found its way under the freemasons into the\r\nChristian churches of the West, as a type of 'prudence' among the\r\nrepresentations of Christian virtues. When we remember that the Gnostics\r\ntaught that _prudence_ alone was virtue,[11] we have here a coincidence\r\nwhich sufficiently explains the meaning of this emblem of 'the baptism\r\nof mind.'\r\n\r\nNothing is more likely than that a portion of the Knights Templars were\r\ninitiated in the mysteries of such Oriental sects as those of the _House\r\nof Wisdom_ of Al Hakem, the seventh and last degree of which at first\r\n'inculcated the vanity of all religion, and the indifference of actions\r\nwhich are neither visited with recompense nor chastisement here or\r\nhereafter.' At a later age, when the doctrines of this society had\r\npermeated all Islam, it seems to have labored very zealously to teach\r\nboth women and men gratuitously all learning, and give them the freest\r\nuse of books. At this time it was in the ninth degree that the initiate\r\n'learnt the grand secret of atheism, and a code of morals, which may be\r\nsummed up in a few words, as believing nothing and daring\r\neverything.'[12]\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, Walter Scott may be presumed to have studied with\r\nshrewd appreciation the character of the Templars, and to have\r\nconjectured with strange wisdom their great ambition, when we find Brian\r\nde Bois Guilbert declaring to Rebecca that his Order threatened the\r\nthrones of Europe, and hinting at tremendous changes in society--'hopes\r\nmore extended than can be viewed from the throne of a monarch.' For it\r\nwas indeed the hope--it _must_ have been--for the proud and powerful\r\nbrotherhood of the Temple to extend their secret doctrines over Europe,\r\nregenerate society, and overthrow all existing powers, substituting for\r\nthem its own crude and impossible socialism, and for Christianity the\r\nlore of the serpent. How plainly is this expressed in the speech of Bois\r\nGuilbert to Rebecca:\r\n\r\n     'Such a swelling flood is that powerful league. Of this mighty\r\n     Order I am no mean member, but already one of the Chief Commanders,\r\n     and may well aspire one day to hold the baton of Grand Master. The\r\n     poor soldiers of the Temple will not alone place their foot upon\r\n     the necks of Kings--a hemp-sandall'd monk can do that. Our mailed\r\n     step shall ascend their throne--our gauntlet shall wrench the\r\n     sceptre from their gripe. Not the reign of your vainly expected\r\n     Messiah offers such power to your dispersed tribes as my ambition\r\n     may aim at. I have sought but a kindred spirit to share it, and I\r\n     have found such in thee.'\r\n\r\n     'Sayest thou this to one of my people?' answered Rebecca. 'Bethink\r\n     thee'--\r\n\r\n     'Answer me not,' said the Templar, 'by urging the difference of our\r\n     creeds; within our secret conclaves we hold these nursery tales in\r\n     derision. Think not we long remain blind to the idiotic folly of\r\n     our founders, who forswore every delight of life for the pleasures\r\n     of dying martyrs by hunger, by thirst, and by pestilence, and by\r\n     the swords of savages, while they vainly strove to defend a barren\r\n     desert, valuable only in the eyes of superstition. Our Order soon\r\n     adopted bolder and wider views, and found out a better\r\n     indemnification for our sacrifices. Our immense possessions in\r\n     every kingdom of Europe, our high military fame, which brings\r\n     within our circle the flower of chivalry from every Christian\r\n     clime--these are dedicated to ends of which our pious founders\r\n     little dreamed, and which are equally concealed from such weak\r\n     spirits as embrace our Order on the ancient principles, and whose\r\n     superstition makes them our passive tools. But I will not further\r\n     withdraw the veil of our mysteries.'\r\n\r\nWe may well pause for an instant to wonder what would have been the\r\npresent state of the now civilized world had this order with its\r\nOriental illuminéeism actually succeeded in undermining feudal society\r\nand in overthrowing thrones. That it was jointly dreaded by Church and\r\nState appears from the excessive, implacable zeal with which it was\r\nbroken up by Philip the Fair and Pope Clement the Fifth--a zeal quite\r\ninexplicable from the motives of avarice usually attributed to them by\r\nthe modern freemasonic defenders of the Knights of the Temple. I may\r\nwell say modern, since in a freemasonic document bearing date 1766,\r\nreprinted in a rare work,[13] we find the most earnest protest and\r\ndenial that freemasonry had anything in common with the Templars. But\r\nthe Order did not die unavenged. It is by no means improbable that the\r\nsecret heresies which, bearing unmistakable marks of Eastern origin,\r\ncontinually sprang up in Europe, and finally led the way to Huss and the\r\nReformation, were in their origin encouraged by the Templars.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that the character of Bois Guilbert as drawn by Scott--his\r\nhabitual oath 'by earth and sea and sky!' his scorn of 'the doting\r\nscruples which fetter our free-born reason,' and his atheistic faith\r\nthat to die is to be 'dispersed to the elements of which our strange\r\nforms are so mystically composed,' are all wonderful indications of\r\ninsight into a type of mind differing inconceivably from the mere\r\ninfidel villain of modern novels, and which could never have been\r\nattributed to a knight of the superstitious Middle Ages without a strong\r\nbasis of historical research. Very striking indeed is his fierce love\r\nfor Rebecca--his intense appreciation of her great courage and firmness,\r\nwhich he at once recognizes as congenial to his own daring, and believes\r\nwill form for him in her a fit mate. There is a spirit of reality in\r\nthis which transcends ordinary conceptions of what is called genius. To\r\ndeem a woman requisite aid in such intellectual labor--for so we may\r\nwell call the system of the Templars--would at that era have been\r\nincomprehensibly absurd to any save the worshippers of the bi-sexed\r\nBaphomet and the disciples of the House of Wisdom, with whom the equal\r\nculture of the sexes was a leading aim. The extraordinary tact with\r\nwhich Scott has contrived to make Bois Guilbert repulsive to the mass of\r\nreaders, while at the same time he really--for himself--makes him\r\nundergo every sacrifice of which the Templar's nature is _consistently_\r\ncapable, is perhaps the most elaborately artistic effort in his works.\r\nTo have made Bois Guilbert sensible to the laws of love and of chivalry,\r\nwhich in his mystical freedom he despised, to rescue her simply from\r\ndeath, which in his view had no terrors beyond short-lived pain, would\r\nnot have agreed with his character as Scott very truly understood it.\r\nHimself a sacrifice to fate, he was willing that she, whom he regarded\r\nas a second self, should also perish. This reserving the true\r\ncomprehension of a certain character to one's self by a writer is not, I\r\nbelieve, an uncommon thing in romance writing. 'Blifil' was the favorite\r\nchild of his literary parent, and was (it is to be hoped) seen by him\r\nfrom a stand-point undreamed of by nearly all readers.\r\n\r\nClosely allied in the one main point of character to Bois Guilbert, and\r\nto a certain degree having his Oriental origin, yet differing in every\r\nother detail, we have Hayraddin Maugrabin, the gypsy, in 'Quentin\r\nDurward.'\r\n\r\nWhen Walter Scott drew the outlines of this singular subordinate actor\r\nin one of the world's greatest mediæval romances, so little was known of\r\nthe real condition of the 'Rommany,' that the author was supposed to\r\nhave introduced an exaggerated and most improbable character among\r\nhistorical portraits which were true to life. The more recent researches\r\nof George Borrow and others have shown that, judged by the gypsy of the\r\npresent day, Hayraddin is extremely well drawn in certain particulars,\r\nbut improbable in other respects. He has, amid all his villany, a\r\ncertain firmness or greatness which is peculiar to men who can sustain\r\npositions of rank--a marked Oriental 'leadership,' which Scott might be\r\npresumed to have guessed at. Yet all of this corresponds closely to the\r\nhistorical account of the first of these wanderers, who in 1427 came to\r\nEurope, 'well mounted,' and claiming to be men of the highest rank, and\r\nto the condition and character of certain men among them in the\r\nSlavonian countries of the present day. If we study carefully all that\r\nis accessible both of the present and the past relative to this singular\r\nrace, we shall find that Scott, partly from knowledge and partly by\r\npoetic intuition, has in this gypsy produced one of his most marvellous\r\nand deeply interesting studies.\r\n\r\nLike Bois Guilbert, Hayraddin is a man without a God, and the\r\npeculiarity of his character lies in a constant realization of the fact\r\nthat he is absolutely _free_ from every form or principle of faith,\r\nevery conventional tie, every duty founded on aught save the most\r\nnatural instincts. He revels in this freedom; it is to him like magic\r\narmor, making him invulnerable to shafts which reach all around\r\nhim--nay, which render him supremely indifferent to death itself.\r\nWhether this extreme of philosophical skepticism and stoicism could be\r\nconsistently and correctly attributed to a gypsy of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, will be presently considered. Let me first quote those passages\r\nin which the character is best set forth. The first is that in which\r\nHayraddin, in reply to the queries of Quentin Durward, asserts that he\r\nhas no country, is not a Christian, and is altogether lawless:\r\n\r\n     'You are then,' said the wondering querist, 'destitute of all that\r\n     other men are combined by--you have no law, no leader, no settled\r\n     means of subsistence, no house or home. You have, may Heaven\r\n     compassionate you, no country--and, may Heaven enlighten and\r\n     forgive you, you have no God! What is it that remains to you,\r\n     deprived of government, domestic happiness, and religion?'\r\n\r\n     'I have liberty,' said the Bohemian--'I crouch to no one--obey no\r\n     one--respect no one.--I go where I will--live as I can--and die\r\n     when my day comes.'\r\n\r\n     'But you are subject to instant execution at the pleasure of the\r\n     Judge?'\r\n\r\n     'Be it so,' returned the Bohemian; 'I can but die so much the\r\n     sooner.'\r\n\r\n     'And to imprisonment also,' said the Scot; 'and where then is your\r\n     boasted freedom?'\r\n\r\n     'In my thoughts,' said the Bohemian, 'which no chains can bind;\r\n     while yours, even when your limbs are free, remain fettered by your\r\n     laws and your superstitions, your dreams of local attachment, and\r\n     your fantastic visions of civil policy. Such as I are free in\r\n     spirit when our limbs are chained. You are imprisoned in mind, even\r\n     when your limbs are most at freedom.'\r\n\r\n     [14]'Yet the freedom of your thoughts,' said the Scot, 'relieves\r\n     not the pressure of the gyves on your limbs.'\r\n\r\n     'For a brief time that may be endured,' answered the vagrant, 'and\r\n     if within that period I cannot extricate myself, and fail of relief\r\n     from my comrades, I can always die, and death is the most perfect\r\n     freedom of all.'\r\n\r\nAgain, when asked in his last hour what are his hopes for the future,\r\nthe gypsy, after denying the existence of the soul, declares that his\r\nanticipations are:\r\n\r\n     'To be resolved into the elements. * * * My hope and trust and\r\n     expectation is, that the mysterious frame of humanity shall melt\r\n     into the general mass of nature, to be recompounded in the other\r\n     forms with which she daily supplies those which daily disappear,\r\n     and return under different forms,--the watery particles to streams\r\n     and showers, the earthy parts to enrich their mother earth, the\r\n     airy portions to wanton in the breeze, and those of fire to supply\r\n     the blaze of Aldebaran and his brethren. In this faith I have\r\n     lived, and will die in it. Hence! begone!--disturb me no further! I\r\n     have spoken the last word that mortal ears shall listen to!'\r\n\r\nThat such a strain as this would be absurd from 'Mr. Petulengro,' or any\r\nother of the race as portrayed by Borrow, is evident enough. Whether it\r\nis inappropriate, however, in the mouth of one of the first corners of\r\nthe people in Europe, of direct Hindustanee blood, is another question.\r\nLet us examine it.\r\n\r\nIn his notes to 'Quentin Durward,' Scott declares his belief that there\r\ncan be little doubt that the first gypsies consisted originally of\r\nHindus, who left their native land when it was invaded by Timur or\r\nTamerlane, and that their language is a dialect of Hindustanee. That the\r\ngypsies were Hindus, and outcast Hindus or Pariahs at that, could be no\r\nsecret to Scott. That he should have made Hayraddin in his doctrines\r\nmarvellously true to the very life to certain of this class, indicates a\r\ndegree either of knowledge or of intuition (it may have been either)\r\nwhich is at least remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe reader has probably learned to consider the Hindu Pariah as a merely\r\nwretched outcast, ignorant, vulgar, and oppressed. Such is not, however,\r\nexactly their _status_. Whatever their social rank may be, the\r\nPariahs--the undoubted ancestors of the gypsies--are the authors in\r\nIndia of a great mass of philosophy and literature, embracing nearly all\r\nthat land has ever produced which is tinctured with independence or wit.\r\nIn confirmation of which I beg leave to cite the following passages from\r\nthat extremely entertaining, well-edited, and elegantly published little\r\nwork, the 'Strange Surprising Adventures of the Venerable Goroo Simple\r\nand his Five Disciples':\r\n\r\n     'The literature of the Hindoos owes but little to the hereditary\r\n     claimants to the sole possession of divine light and knowledge. On\r\n     the contrary, with the many things which the Brahmins are forbidden\r\n     to touch, all science, if left to them alone, would soon stagnate,\r\n     and clever men, whose genius cannot be held in trammels, therefore\r\n     soon become outcasts and swell the number of _Pariars_ in\r\n     consequence of their very pursuit of knowledge. * * * To the\r\n     writings of the _Poorrachchameiyans_, a sect of _Pariars_ odious in\r\n     the eyes of a Brahman, the Tamuls owe the greater part of works on\r\n     science. * * * To the _Vallooran_ sect of Pariars, particularly\r\n     shunned by the Brahmans, Hindoo literature is indebted almost\r\n     exclusively for the many moral poems and books of aphorisms which\r\n     are its chief pride.\r\n\r\n     'This class of literature' (satiric humor and fables) 'emanated\r\n     chiefly from those despised outcasts, the Pariars, the very men who\r\n     (using keener spectacles than Dr. Robertson, our historian of\r\n     Ancient India, did, who singularly became the panegyrist of Gentoo\r\n     subdivisions) saw that to bind human intellect and human energy\r\n     within the wire fences of Hindoo castes is as impossible as to shut\r\n     up the winds of heaven in a temple built by man's hand, and boldly\r\n     thought for themselves.'\r\n\r\nOf the literary _Vallooran_ Pariah outcasts and scientific\r\nPoorrachchameiyans, we know from the best authority--Father Beschi--that\r\nthey form society of six degrees or sects, the fifth of which, when five\r\nFridays occur in a month, celebrate it _avec de grandes abominations_,\r\nwhile the sixth 'admits the real existence of nothing--except,\r\n_perhaps_, GOD.' This last is a mere guess on the part of the good\r\nfather. It is beyond conjecture that we have here another of those\r\nstrange Oriental sects, 'atheistic' in its highest school and identical\r\nin its nature with that of the House of Wisdom of Cairo, and with the\r\nTemplars; and if Scott's gypsy Hayraddin Maugrabin is to be supposed one\r\nof that type of Hindu outcasts, which were of all others most hateful to\r\nthe orthodox Moslem invader, we cannot sufficiently admire the\r\nappropriateness with which doctrines which were actually held by the\r\nmost deeply initiated among the Pariahs were put into his mouth. To have\r\nmade a merely vulgar, nothing-believing, and as little reflecting gypsy,\r\nas philosophical as the wanderer in 'Quentin Durward,' would have been\r\nabsurd. There is a vigor, an earnestness in his creed, which betrays\r\nculture and thought, and which is marvellously appropriate if we regard\r\nhim as a wandering scion of the outcast Pariah illuminati of India.\r\n\r\nDid our author owe this insight to erudition or to poetic intuition? In\r\neither case we discover a depth which few would have surmised. It was\r\nonce said of Scott, that he was a millionaire of genius whose wealth was\r\nall in small change--that his scenes and characters were all massed from\r\na vast collection of little details. This would be equivalent to\r\ndeclaring that he was a great novelist without a great idea. Perhaps\r\nthis is true, but the clairvoyance of genius which _seems_ to manifest\r\nitself in the two characters which I have already examined, and the\r\ncautious manner in which he has treated them, would appear to prove that\r\nhe possessed a rarer gift than that of 'great ideas'--the power of\r\ncontrolling them. Such ideas may make reformers, critics, politicians,\r\nessayists--but they generally ruin a novelist--and Scott knew it.\r\n\r\nA third character belonging to the class under consideration, is Henbane\r\nDwining, the 'pottingar,' apothecary or 'leech,' in the novel of 'The\r\nFair Maid of Perth.'\r\n\r\nThis man is rather developed by his deeds than his words, and these are\r\nprompted by two motives, terrible vindictiveness and the pride of\r\nsuperior knowledge. He is vile from the former, and yet almost heroic\r\nfrom the latter, for it is briefly impossible to make any man intensely\r\nself-reliant, and base this self-reliance on great learning in men and\r\nbooks, without displaying in him some elements of superiority. He is so\r\nradically bad that by contrast one of the greatest villains in Scottish\r\nhistory, Sir John Ramorney, appears rather gray than black; and yet we\r\ndislike him less than the knight, possibly because we know that men of\r\nthe Dwining stamp, when they have had the control of nations, often do\r\ngood simply from the dictates of superior wisdom--the wisdom of the\r\nserpent--which, no Ramorney ever did. The skill with which the crawling,\r\npaltry leech controls his fierce lord; the contempt for his power and\r\npride shown in Dwining's adroit sneers, and above all, the ease with\r\nwhich the latter casts into the shade Ramorney's fancied superiority in\r\nwickedness, is well set forth--and such a character could only have been\r\nconceived by deep study of the motives and agencies which formed it. To\r\ndo so, Scott had recourse to the same Oriental source--the same fearful\r\nschool of atheism which in another and higher form gave birth to the\r\nTemplar and the gypsy. 'I have studied,' says Dwining, 'among the sages\r\nof Granada, where the fiery-souled Moor lifts high his deadly dagger as\r\nit drops with his enemy's blood, and avows the doctrine which the pallid\r\nChristian practises, though, coward-like, he dare not name it.' His\r\nsneers at the existence of a devil, at all 'prejudices,' at religion,\r\nabove all, at brute strength and every power save that of intellect, are\r\nperfectly Oriental--not however of the Oriental Sufi, or of the\r\ninitiated in the House of Wisdom, whose pantheistic Idealism went hand\r\nin hand with a faith in benefiting mankind, and which taught\r\nforgiveness, equality, and love, but rather that corrupted Asiatic\r\nvanity of wisdom which abounded among the disciples of Aristotle and of\r\nAverroes in Spain, and which was entirely material. I err, strictly\r\nspeaking, therefore, when I speak of this as the _same_ Oriental school,\r\nthough in a certain sense it had a common origin--that of believing in\r\nthe infinite power of human wisdom. Both are embraced indeed in the\r\nbeguiling _eritis sicut Deus_, 'ye shall be as GOD,' uttered by the\r\nserpent to Eve.\r\n\r\nQuite subordinate as regards its position among the actors of the novel,\r\nyet extremely interesting in a historical point of view, is the\r\ncharacter of Jasper Dryfesdale the steward of the Douglas family, in\r\n'The Abbot.' In this man Scott has happily combined the sentiment of\r\nabsolute feudal devotion to his superiors with a gloomy fatalism learned\r\n'among the fierce sectaries of Lower Germany.' If carefully studied,\r\nDryfesdale will be found to be, on the whole, the most morally\r\ninstructive character in the entire range of Scott's writings. In the\r\nfirst place, he illustrates the fact, so little noted by the advocates\r\nof loyalty, aristocracy, 'devoted retainers,' and 'faithful vassals,'\r\nthat all such fidelity carried beyond the balance of a harmony of\r\ninterests, results in an insensibility to moral accountability. Thus in\r\nthe Southern States, masters often refer with pride to the fact that a\r\ncertain negro, who will freely pillage in other quarters, will 'never\r\nsteal at home.' History shows that the man who surrenders himself\r\nentirely to the will of another begins at once to cast on his superior\r\nall responsibility for his own acts. Such dependence and evasion is of\r\nitself far worse than the bold unbelief which is to the last degree\r\nself-reliant; which seeks no substitute, dreads no labor, scorns all\r\nmastery, and aims at the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the\r\ntruth. Such unbelief may possibly end in finding religious truth after\r\nits devious errors, but what shall be said of those who would have men\r\nsin as _slaves_?\r\n\r\nSingularly and appropriately allied to a resignation of moral\r\naccountability from feudal attachment, is the contemptible and cowardly\r\ndoctrine of fatalism, which Dryfesdale also professes. It is not with\r\nhim the philosophic doctrine of the concurring impulses of circumstance,\r\nor of natural laws, but rather the stupendously nonsensical notion of\r\nthe Arabian _kismet_, that from the beginning of time every event was\r\nfore-arranged as in a fairy tale, and that all which _is_, is simply the\r\nacting out of a libretto written before the play began--a belief revived\r\nin the last century by readers of Leibnitz, who were truer than the\r\ngreat German himself to the consequences of his doctrine, which he\r\nsimply evaded.[15] In coupling this humiliating and superstitious means\r\nof evading moral accountability with the same principle as derived from\r\nfeudal devotion, Scott, consciously or unconsciously, displayed genius,\r\nand at the same time indirectly attacked that system of society to which\r\nhe was specially devoted. So true is it that genius instinctively tends\r\nto set forth the _truth_, be the predilections of its possessor what\r\nthey may. And indeed, as Scott nowhere shows in any way that _he_, for\r\nhis part, regarded the blind fidelity of the steward as other than\r\nadmirable, it may be that he was guided rather by instinct than will, in\r\nthus pointing out the great evil resulting from a formally aristocratic\r\nstate of society. Such as it is, it is well worth studying in these\r\ntimes, when the principles of republicanism and aristocracy are brought\r\nface to face at war among us, firstly in the contest between the South\r\nand the North, and secondly in the rapidly growing division between the\r\nfriends of the Union, and the treasonable 'Copperheads,' who consist of\r\nmen of selfish, aristocratic tendencies, and their natural allies, the\r\nrefuse of the population.\r\n\r\nIt is very unfortunate that the term 'Anabaptists' should have ever been\r\napplied to the ferocious fanatics led by John of Leyden, Knipperdolling,\r\nand Rothmann, since it has brought discredit on a large sect bearing the\r\nsame name with which it had in reality even less in common than the\r\nhistorians of the latter imagine. It is not a difficult matter for the\r\nmind familiar with the undoubted Oriental origin of the 'heresies' of\r\nthe middle ages, to trace in the origin at least of the fierce and\r\nlicentious socialists of Münster the same secret influence which,\r\nflowing from Gnostic, Manichæan, or Templar sources, founded the\r\nWaldense and Albigense sects, and was afterward perceptible in a branch\r\nof the Hussites. At the time of the Reformation their ancient doctrines\r\nhad subsided into Biblical fanaticism; but the old leaven of revolt\r\nagainst the church, and against all compulsion--keenly sharpened by\r\ntheir experiences, in the recent Peasant's War--was as hot as ever among\r\nthem. They had no great or high philosophy, but were in all respects\r\nchaotic, contradictory, and stormy. Unable to rise to the cultivated and\r\nphilanthropic feelings which accompanied the skepticism of their remote\r\nfounders, they based their denial of moral accountability--as narrow and\r\nvulgar minds naturally do--on a predestination, which is as insulting to\r\nGOD as to man, since it is consistently comprehensible only by supposing\r\nHIM a slave to destiny. Among such vassals to a worse than earthly\r\ntyranny, the man who as 'a Scottish servant regarded not his own life or\r\nthat of any other save his master,' would find doctrines congenial\r\nenough to his grovelling nature. So he was willing to believe that 'that\r\nwhich was written of me a million years before I saw the light must be\r\nexecuted by me.' 'I am well taught, and strong in belief,' he says,\r\n'that man does nought for himself; he is but the foam on the billow,\r\nwhich rises, bubbles, and bursts, not by its own effort, but by the\r\nmightier impulse of fate which urges him.' And the combination of his\r\ntwo wretched doctrines is well set forth in the passage wherein he tells\r\nhis mistress that she had no choice as regarded accepting his criminal\r\nservices. 'You might not choose, lady,' answered the steward. 'Long ere\r\nthis castle was builded--ay, long ere the islet which sustains it reared\r\nits head above the blue water--I was destined to be your faithful slave,\r\nand you to be my ungrateful mistress.'\r\n\r\nFreethinkers, infidels, and atheists abound in novels, but it is to the\r\ncredit of Sir Walter Scott that wherever he has introduced a _sincere_\r\ncharacter of this description, he has gone to the very origin for his\r\nfacts, and then given us the result without pedantry. The four which I\r\nhave examined are each a curious subject for study, and indicate,\r\ncollectively and compared, a train of thought which I believe that few\r\nhave suspected in Scott, notwithstanding his well-known great love for\r\nthe curious and occult in literature. That he perfectly understood that\r\nabsurd and vain character, the so-called 'infidel,' whose philosophy is\r\nlimited to abusing Christianity, and whose real object is to be odd and\r\npeculiar, and astonish humble individuals with his wickedness, is most\r\namusingly shown in 'Bletson,' one of the three Commissioners of Cromwell\r\nintroduced into 'Woodstock.' Scott has drawn this very subordinate\r\ncharacter in remarkable detail, having devoted nearly seven pages to its\r\ndescription,[16] evidently being for once carried away by the desire of\r\nrendering the personality as clearly as possible, or of gratifying his\r\nown fancy. And while no effort is ever made to cast even a shadow of\r\nridicule on the Knight Templar, on Dryfesdale, on the gypsy, or even on\r\nthe crawling Dwining, he manifestly takes great pains to render as\r\ncontemptible and laughably absurd as possible this type of the very\r\ngreat majority of modern infidels, who disavow religion because they\r\nfear it, and ridicule Christianity from sheer, shallow ignorance. Our\r\nown country at present abounds in 'Bletsons,' in conceited, ignorant\r\n'infidel' scribblers of many descriptions, in of all whom we can still\r\ntrace the cant and drawl of the old-fashioned fanaticism to which they\r\nare in reality nearly allied, while they appear to oppose it. For the\r\ntruth is, that popular infidelity--to borrow Mr. Caudle's simile of\r\ntyrants--is only Puritanism turned inside out. We see this, even when it\r\nis masked in French flippancy and the Shibboleth of the current\r\naccomplishments of literature--it betrays itself by its vindictiveness\r\nand conceit, by its cruelty, sarcasms, and meanness--with the infidel as\r\nwith the bigot. The sincere seeker for truth, whether he wander through\r\nthe paths of unbelief or of faith, never forgets to love, never courts\r\nnotoriety, and is neither a satirical court-fool nor a would-be\r\nMephistopheles.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting on these characters, I am irresistibly reminded of an\r\nanecdote illustrating their nature. A friend of mine who had employed a\r\nrather ignorant fellow to guide him through some ruins in England, was\r\nastonished, as he entered a gloomy dungeon, at the sudden remark, in the\r\nhollow voice of one imparting a dire confidence, of: 'I doan't believe\r\nin hany GOD!' 'Don't you, indeed?' was the placid reply. 'Noa,' answered\r\nthe guide; '_H'I'm a_ HINFIDEL!' 'Well, I hope you feel easy after it,'\r\nquoth my friend.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another skeptic set forth by Scott, whose peculiarities may\r\nbe deemed worthy of examination. I refer to Agelastes, the treacherous\r\nand hypocritical sage of 'Count Robert of Paris.' In this man we have,\r\nhowever, rather the refined sensualist and elegant scholar who amuses\r\nhimself with the subtleties of the old Greek philosophy, than a sincere\r\nseeker for truth, or even a sincere doubter. His views are fully given\r\nin a short lecture of the countess:\r\n\r\n     'Daughter,' said Agelastes, approaching nearer to the lady, 'it is\r\n     with pain I see you bewildered in errors which a little calm\r\n     reflection might remove. We may flatter ourselves, and human vanity\r\n     usually does so, that beings infinitely more powerful than those\r\n     belonging to mere humanity are employed daily in measuring out the\r\n     good and evil of this world, the termination of combats or the fate\r\n     of empires, according to their own ideas of what is right or wrong,\r\n     or more properly, according to what we ourselves conceive to be\r\n     such. The Greek heathens, renowned for their wisdom, and glorious\r\n     for their actions, explained to men of ordinary minds the supposed\r\n     existence of Jupiter and his Pantheon, where various deities\r\n     presided over various virtues and vices, and regulated the temporal\r\n     fortune and future happiness of such as practised them. The more\r\n     learned and wise of the ancients rejected such the vulgar\r\n     interpretation, and wisely, although affecting a deference to the\r\n     public faith, denied before their disciples in private, the gross\r\n     fallacies of Tartarus and Olympus, the vain doctrines concerning\r\n     the gods themselves, and the extravagant expectations which the\r\n     vulgar entertained of an immortality supposed to be possessed by\r\n     creatures who were in every respect mortal, both in the\r\n     conformation of their bodies, and in the internal belief of their\r\n     souls. Of these wise and good men some granted the existence of the\r\n     supposed deities, but denied that they cared about the actions of\r\n     mankind any more than those of the inferior animals. A merry,\r\n     jovial, careless life, such as the followers of Epicurus would\r\n     choose for themselves, was what they assigned for those gods whose\r\n     being they admitted. Others, more bold or more consistent, entirely\r\n     denied the existence of deities who apparently had no proper object\r\n     or purpose, and believed that such of them, whose being and\r\n     attributes were proved to us by no supernatural appearances, had in\r\n     reality no existence whatever.'\r\n\r\nIn all this, and indeed in all the character of Agelastes, there is\r\nnothing more than shallow scholarship, such as may be found in many of\r\n'the learned' in all ages, whose learning is worn as a fine garment,\r\nperhaps as one of comfort, but _not_ as the armor in which to earnestly\r\ndo battle for life. A contempt for the vulgar, or at best a selfish\r\nrendering of life agreeable to themselves, is all that is gathered from\r\nsuch systems of doubt--and this was in all ages the reproach of all\r\nGreek philosophy. It was not meant for the multitude nor for the\r\nbarbarian. It embraced no hope of benefiting all mankind, no scheme for\r\neven freeing them from superstition. Such ideas were only cherished by\r\nthe Orientals, and (though mingled with errors) subsequently and _fully_\r\nby the early Christians. It was in the East that the glorious doctrine\r\nof love for _all_ beings, not only for enemies, but for the very fiends\r\nthemselves, was first proclaimed as essential to perfect the soul--as\r\nshown in the beautiful Hindu poem of 'The Buddha's Victory,'[17] in\r\nwhich the demon Wassywart, that horror of horrors, whose eyes are clots\r\nof blood, whose voice outroars the thunder, who plucks up the sun from\r\nits socket the sky, defies the great saint-god to battle:\r\n\r\n  'The unarmed Buddha mildly gazed at him,\r\n  And said in peace: 'Poor fiend, _even thee I love_.'\r\n  Before great Wassywart the world grew dim;\r\n  His bulk enormous dwindled to a dove. * * *\r\n  --Celestial beauty sat on Buddhas face,\r\n  While sweetly sang the metamorphosed dove:\r\n  'Swords, rocks, lies, fiends, must yield to moveless love,\r\n  And nothing can withstand the Buddha's grace.'\r\n\r\nAnd again, in 'The Secret of Piety'--the secret 'of all the lore which\r\nangelic bosoms swell'--we have the same pure faith:\r\n\r\n  'Whoso would careless tread one worm that crawls the sod,\r\n  That cruel man is darkly alienate from God;\r\n  But he that lives embracing all that is in _love_,\r\n  To dwell with him God bursts all bounds, below, above.'\r\n\r\nThe Greek philosophy knew nothing of all this, and the result is that\r\neven in the atheism which sprang from the East, and in its harshest and\r\nlowest 'tinctures,' we find a something nobler and less selfish than is\r\nto be found in the school of Plato himself. And however this may be, the\r\nreader will admit, in examining the six skeptics set forth by Scott,\r\nthat each is a character firmly based in historical truth; that all,\r\nwith the exception of 'Bletson,' are sketched with remarkable brevity;\r\nand that a careful comparative analysis of the whole gives us a deeper\r\ninsight into the secret tendencies of the author's mind, and at the same\r\ntime into the springs of his genius, than the world has been wont to\r\ntake. And the study of the subject is finally interesting, since we may\r\nlearn from it that even in the works of one who is a standard poetic\r\nauthority among those who would, if possible, subject all men to\r\nfeudalism, we may learn lessons of that highest social\r\ntruth--republicanism.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: OVID. _Metamorphoseon_, lib. xi. v. 183.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Hæc autem erat Gnosticorum doctrina ethica, quod omnem\r\nvirtutem in prudentia sitim esse credebant, quam Ophitæ per _Metem_\r\n(Sophiam) et Serpentem exprimebant, desumpto iterum ex Evangelii\r\npræcepto; _estote prudentes ut serpentes_,--ob innatem hujus animalis\r\nastutiam?--VON HAMMER, _Fundgruben des Orients_, tom. vi. p. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _New Curiosities of Literature._ By GEO.

They were nearly deserted. Not a\r\nsolitary fire slumbered on the bare clay hearths, and not a single darky\r\nstood sentry over the loose pork and neglected hoecakes, or kept at bay\r\nthe army of huge rats and prowling opossums which beleaguered the\r\nquarters. Silence--death's music--was over and around them. The noisy\r\nrevelry of the dancers had died away in the distance, and even the\r\nhoarse song of the great trees had sunk to a low moan as they stood,\r\nmotionless and abashed, in the presence of the grim giant who knocks\r\nalike at the palace and the cottage gate.\r\n\r\nA stray light glimmered through the logs of a low hut, far off in the\r\nwoods, and, making our way to it, we entered. A bright fire lit up the\r\ninterior, and on a rude cot, in one corner, lay the old preacher. His\r\neyes were closed; a cold, clammy sweat was on his forehead--he was\r\ndying. One of his skeleton hands rested on the tattered coverlet, and\r\nhis weazened face was half buried in a dilapidated pillow, whose ragged\r\ncasing and protruding plumage bespoke it a relic of some departed white\r\nsleeper.\r\n\r\nAn old negress, with gray hair and haggard visage, sat at the foot of\r\nthe bed, wailing piteously; and Joe and half a dozen aged saints stood\r\naround, singing a hymn, doleful enough to have made even a sinner weep.\r\n\r\nNot heeding our entrance, Joe took the dying man by the hand, and, in a\r\nslow, solemn voice, said:\r\n\r\n'Brudder Jack, you'm dyin'; you'm gwine ter dat lan' whence no trabeller\r\nreturns; you'm settin' out fur dat country which'm lit by de smile ob de\r\nLord; whar dar ain't no sickness, no pain, no sorrer, no dyin'; fur dat\r\nkingdom whar de Lord reigns; whar trufh flows on like a riber; whar\r\nrighteousness springs up like de grass, an' lub draps down like de dew,\r\nan' cobers de face ob de groun'; whar you woan't gwo 'bout wid no\r\ncrutch; whar you woan't lib in no ole cabin like dis, an' eat hoecake\r\nan' salt pork in sorrer an' heabiness ob soul; but whar you'll run an'\r\nnot be weary, an' walk an' not be faint; whar you'll hab a hous'n\r\nbuilded ob de Lord, an' sit at His table--you' meat an' drink de bread\r\nan' de water ob life!\r\n\r\n'I knows you's a sinner, Jack; I knows you's lub'd de hot water too\r\nmuch, an' dat it make you forgit you' duty sometime, an' set a bad\r\n'zample ter dem as looked up ter you fur better tings; but dar am mercy\r\nwid de Lord, Jack; dar am forgibness wid Him; an' I hopes you'm ready\r\nan' willin' ter gwo.'\r\n\r\nOld Jack opened his eyes, and, in a low, peevish tone, said:\r\n\r\n'Joe, none ob you' nonsense ter me! I'se h'ard you talk dis way afore.\r\n_You_ can't preach--you neber could. You jess knows I ain't fit ter\r\ntrabble, an' I ain't willin' ter gwo, nowhar.'\r\n\r\nJoe mildly rebuked him, and again commenced expatiating on the 'upper\r\nkingdom,' and on the glories of 'the house not made with hands, eternal\r\nin the heavens;' but the old darky cut him short, with--\r\n\r\n'Shet up, Joe! no more ob dat. I doan't want no oder hous'n but dis--dis\r\nole cabin am good 'nuff fur me.'\r\n\r\nJoe was about to reply, when Preston stepped to the bedside, and, taking\r\nthe aged preacher's hand, said:\r\n\r\n'My good Jack, master Robert has come to see you.'\r\n\r\nThe dying man turned his eyes toward his master, and, in a weak,\r\ntremulous voice, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Oh! massa Robert, has _you_ come? has you come ter see ole Jack? Bress\r\nyou, massa Robert, bress you! Jack know'd you'd neber leab him yere ter\r\ndie alone.'\r\n\r\n'No, my good Jack; I would save you if I could.'\r\n\r\n'But you can't sabe me, massa Robert; I'se b'yond dat. I'se dyin', massa\r\nRobert. I'se gwine ter de good missus. She tell'd me ter get ready ter\r\nfoller har, an' I is. I'se gwine ter har now, massa Robert!'\r\n\r\n'I know you are, Jack. I feel _sure_ you are.'\r\n\r\n'Tank you, massa Robert--tank you fur sayin' dat. An' woan't you pray\r\nfur me, massa Robert--jess a little pray? De good man's prayer am h'ard,\r\nyou knows, massa Robert.'\r\n\r\nAll kneeling down on the rough floor, Preston prayed--a short, simple,\r\nfervent prayer. At its close, he rose, and, bending over the old negro,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'The Lord is good, Jack; His mercy is everlasting.'\r\n\r\n'I knows dat; I feels dat,' gasped the dying man. 'I lubs you, massa\r\nRobert; I allers lub'd you; but I'se gwine ter leab you now. Bress you!\r\nde Lord bress you, massa Robert' I'll tell de good missus'--\r\n\r\nHe clutched convulsively at his master's hand; a wild light came out of\r\nhis eyes; a sudden spasm passed over his face, and--he was 'gone whar de\r\ngood darkies go.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Frank and I were to resume our journey; and, in the\r\nmorning, I suggested that we should visit Colonel Dawsey, with whom,\r\nthough he had for many years been a correspondent of the house in which\r\nI was a partner, I had no personal acquaintance.\r\n\r\nHis plantation adjoined Preston's, and his house was only a short half\r\nmile from my friend's. After breakfast, we set out for it through the\r\nwoods. The day was cold for the season, with a sharp, nipping air, and\r\nour overcoats were not at all uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAs we walked along I said to Preston:\r\n\r\n'Dawsey's 'account' is a good one. He never draws against shipments, but\r\nholds on, and sells sight drafts, thus making the exchange.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I know; he's a close calculator.'\r\n\r\n'Does he continue to manage his negroes as formerly?'\r\n\r\n'In much the same way, I reckon.'\r\n\r\n'Then he can't stand remarkably well with his neighbors.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! people round here don't mind such things. Many of them do as badly\r\nas he. Besides, Dawsey is a gentleman of good family. He inherited his\r\nplantation and two hundred hands.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed! How, then, did he become reduced to his present number?'\r\n\r\n'He was a wild young fellow, and, before he was twenty-five, had\r\nsquandered and gambled away everything but his land and some thirty\r\nnegroes. Then he turned square round, and, from being prodigal and\r\ncareless, became mean and cruel. He has a hundred now, and more ready\r\nmoney than any planter in the district.'\r\n\r\nA half hour's walk took us to Dawsey's negro quarters--a collection of\r\nabout thirty low huts in the rear of his house. They were not so poor as\r\nsome I had seen on cotton and rice plantations, but they seemed unfit\r\nfor the habitation of any animal but the hog. Their floors were the bare\r\nground, hardened by being moistened with water and pounded with mauls;\r\nand worn, as they were, several inches lower in the centre than at the\r\nsides, they must have formed, in rainy weather, the beds of small lakes.\r\nSo much water would have been objectionable to white tenants; but\r\nnegroes, like their friends the alligators, are amphibious animals; and\r\nDawsey's were never known to make complaint. The chimneys were often\r\nmerely vent-holes in the roof, though a few were tumble-down structures\r\nof sticks and clay; and not a window, nor an opening which courtesy\r\ncould have christened a window, was to be seen in the entire collection.\r\nAnd, for that matter, windows were useless, for the wide crevices in the\r\nlogs, which let in the air and rain, at the same time might admit the\r\nlight. Two or three low beds at one end, a small pine bench, which held\r\nhalf a dozen wooden plates and spoons, and a large iron pot, resting on\r\nfour stones, over a low fire, and serving for both washtub and\r\ncook-kettle, composed the furniture of each interior.\r\n\r\nNo one of the cabins was over sixteen feet square, but each was 'home'\r\nand 'shelter' for three or four human beings. Walking on a short\r\ndistance, we came to a larger hovel, in front of which about a dozen\r\nyoung chattels were playing. Seven or eight more, too young to walk,\r\nwere crawling about on the ground inside. They had only one garment\r\napiece--a long shirt of coarse linsey--and their heads and feet were\r\nbare. An old negress was seated in the doorway, knitting. Approaching\r\nher, I said:\r\n\r\n'Aunty, are not these children cold?'\r\n\r\n'Oh! no, massa; dey'm use' ter de wedder.'\r\n\r\n'Do you take care of all of them?'\r\n\r\n'In de daytime I does, massa. In de night dar mudders takes de small\r\n'uns.'\r\n\r\n'But some of them are white. Those two are as white as I am!'\r\n\r\n'No, massa; dey'm brack. Ef you looks at dar eyes an' dar finger nails,\r\nyou'll see dat.'\r\n\r\n'They're black, to be sure they are,' said young Preston, laughing; 'but\r\nthey're about as white as Dawsey, and look wonderfully like him--eh,\r\naunty Sue?'\r\n\r\n'I reckons, massa Joe!' replied the woman, running her hand through her\r\nwool, and grinning widely.\r\n\r\n'What does he ask for _them_, aunty?'\r\n\r\n'Doan't know, massa, but 'spect dey'm pooty high. Dem kine am hard ter\r\nraise.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Joe; 'white blood--even Dawsey's--don't take naturally to\r\nmud.'\r\n\r\n'I reckons not, massa Joe!' said the old negress, with another grin.\r\n\r\nJoe gave her a half-dollar piece, and, amid an avalanche of blessings,\r\nwe passed on to Dawsey's 'mansion'--if mansion it could be called--a\r\nstory-and-a-half shanty, about thirty feet square, covered with rough,\r\nunpainted boards, and lit by two small, dingy windows. It was approached\r\nby a sandy walk, and the ground around its front entrance was littered\r\nwith apple peelings, potato parings, and the refuse of the culinary\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nJoe rapped at the door, and, in a moment, it opened, and a middle-aged\r\nmulatto woman appeared. As soon as she perceived Preston, she grasped\r\nhis two hands, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Oh! massa Robert, _do_ buy har! Massa'll kill har, ef you doan't.'\r\n\r\n'But I can't, Dinah. Your master refuses my note, and I haven't the\r\nmoney now.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! oh! He'll kill har; he say he will. She woan't gib in ter him, an'\r\nhe'll kill har, _shore_. Oh! oh!' cried the woman, wringing her hands,\r\nand bursting into tears.\r\n\r\n'Is it 'Spasia?' asked Joe.\r\n\r\n'Yas, massa Joe; it'm 'Spasia. Massa hab sole yaller Tom 'way from har,\r\nan' he swar he'll kill har 'case she woan't gib in ter him. Oh! oh!'\r\n\r\n'Where is your master?'\r\n\r\n'He'm 'way wid har an' Black Cale. I reckon dey'm down ter de branch. I\r\nreckon dey'm whippin' on har _now_!'\r\n\r\n'Come, Frank,' cried Joe, starting off at a rapid pace; 'let's see that\r\nperformance.'\r\n\r\n'Hold on, Joe; wait for us. You'll get into trouble!' shouted his\r\nfather, hurrying after him. The rest of us caught up with them in a few\r\nmoments, and then all walked rapidly on in the direction of the small\r\nrun which borders the two plantations.\r\n\r\nBefore we had gone far, we heard loud screams, mingled with oaths and\r\nthe heavy blows of a whip. Quickening our pace, we soon reached the bank\r\nof the little stream, which there was lined with thick underbrush. We\r\ncould see no one, and the sounds had subsided. In a moment, however, a\r\nrough voice called out from behind the bushes:\r\n\r\n'Have you had enough? Will you give up?'\r\n\r\n'Oh! no, good massa; I can't do dat!' was the half-sobbing, half-moaning\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n'Give it to her again, Cale!' cried the first voice; and again the whip\r\ndescended, and again the piercing cries: 'O Lord!' 'Oh, pray doan't!' 'O\r\nLord, hab mercy!' 'Oh! good massa, hab mercy!' mingled with the falling\r\nblows.\r\n\r\n'This way!' shouted Joe, pressing through the bushes, and bounding down\r\nthe bank toward the actors in this nineteenth-century tournament,\r\nwherein an armed knight and a doughty squire were set against a weak,\r\ndefenceless woman.\r\n\r\nLeaning against a pine at a few feet from the edge of the run, was a\r\ntall, bony man of about fifty. His hair was coarse and black, and his\r\nskin the color of tobacco-juice. He wore the ordinary homespun of the\r\ndistrict; and long, deep lines about his mouth and under his eyes told\r\nthe story of a dissipated life. His entire appearance was anything but\r\nprepossessing.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of three or four rods, and bound to the charred trunk of\r\nan old tree, was a woman, several shades lighter than the man. Her feet\r\nwere secured by stout cords, and her arms were clasped around the\r\nblackened stump, and tied in that position. Her back was bare to the\r\nloins, and, as she hung there, moaning with agony, and shivering with\r\ncold, it seemed one mass of streaming gore.\r\n\r\nThe brawny black, whom Boss Joe had so eccentrically addressed at the\r\nnegro meeting, years before, was in the act of whipping the woman; but\r\nwith one bound, young Preston was on him. Wrenching the whip from his\r\nhand, he turned on his master, crying out:\r\n\r\n'Untie her, you white-livered devil, or I'll plough your back as you've\r\nploughed hers!'\r\n\r\n'Don't interfere here, you d--d whelp!' shouted Dawsey, livid with rage,\r\nand drawing his revolver.\r\n\r\n'I'll give you enough of that, you cowardly hound!' cried Joe, taking a\r\nsmall Derringer from his pocket, and coolly advancing upon Dawsey.\r\n\r\nThe latter levelled his pistol, but, before he could fire, by a\r\ndexterous movement of my cane, I struck it from his hand. Drawing\r\ninstantly a large knife, he rushed on me. The knife was descending--in\r\nanother instant I should have 'tasted Southern steel,' had not Frank\r\ncaught his arm, wrenched the weapon from his grasp, and with the fury of\r\nan aroused tiger, sprung on him and borne him to the ground. Planting\r\nhis knee firmly on Dawsey's breast, and twisting his neckcloth tightly\r\nabout his throat, Frank yelled out:\r\n\r\n'Stand back. Let _me_ deal with him!'\r\n\r\n'But you will kill him.'\r\n\r\n'Well, he would have killed _you_!' he cried, tightening his hold on\r\nDawsey's throat.\r\n\r\n'Let him up, Frank. Let the devil have fair play,' said Joe; 'I'll give\r\nhim a chance at ten paces.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, let him up, my son; he is unarmed.'\r\n\r\nFrank slowly and reluctantly released his hold, and the woman-whipper\r\nrose. Looking at us for a moment--a mingled look of rage and\r\ndefiance--he turned, without speaking, and took some rapid strides up\r\nthe bank.\r\n\r\n'Hold on, Colonel Dawsey!' cried Joe, elevating his Derringer; 'take\r\nanother step, and I'll let daylight through you. You've just got to\r\npromise you won't whip this woman, or take your chance at ten paces.'\r\n\r\n[I afterward learned that Joe was deadly sure with the pistol.]\r\n\r\nDawsey turned slowly round, and, in a sullen tone, asked:\r\n\r\n'Who are you, _gentlemen_, that interfere with my private affairs?'\r\n\r\n'_My_ name, sir, is Kirke, of New York; and this young man is my son.'\r\n\r\n'Not Mr. Kirke, my factor?'\r\n\r\n'The same, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Mr. Kirke, I'm sorry to say you're just now in d--d pore\r\nbusiness.'\r\n\r\n'I _have_ been, sir. I've done yours for some years, and I'm heartily\r\nashamed of it. I'll try to mend in that particular, however.'\r\n\r\n'Well, no more words, Colonel Dawsey,' said Joe. 'Here's a Derringer, if\r\nyou'd like a pop at me.'\r\n\r\n'Tain't an even chance,' replied Dawsey; 'you know it.'\r\n\r\n'Take it, or promise not to whip the woman. I won't waste more time on\r\nsuch a sneaking coward as you are.'\r\n\r\nDawsey hesitated, but finally, in a dogged way, made the required\r\npromise, and took himself off.\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation was going on, Preston and the negro man had\r\nuntied the woman. Her back was bleeding profusely, and she was unable to\r\nstand. Lifting her in their arms, the two conveyed her to the top of the\r\nbank, and then, making a bed of their coats, laid her on the ground. We\r\nremained there until the negro returned from the house with a turpentine\r\nwagon, and conveyed the woman 'home.' We then returned to the\r\nplantation, and that afternoon, accompanied by Frank and Joe, I resumed\r\nmy journey.\r\n\r\nBy way of episode, I will mention that the slave woman, after being\r\nconfined to her bed several weeks, recovered. Then Dawsey renewed his\r\nattack upon her, and, from the effects of a second whipping, she died.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nReturning from the South a few weeks after the events narrated in the\r\nprevious chapter, Frank and I were met at Goldsboro by Preston and\r\nSelma, when the latter accompanied us to the North, and once more\r\nresumed her place in David's family.\r\n\r\nOn the first of February following, Frank, then not quite twenty-one,\r\nwas admitted a partner in the house of Russell, Rollins, & Co., and, in\r\nthe succeeding summer, was sent to Europe on business of the firm.\r\nShortly after his return, in the following spring, he came on from\r\nBoston with a proposal from Cragin that I should embark with them and\r\nyoung Preston in an extensive speculation. Deeming any business in which\r\nCragin was willing to engage worthy of careful consideration, I listened\r\nto Frank's exposition of the plan of operations. He had originated the\r\nproject, and in it he displayed the comprehensive business mind and rare\r\nblending of caution and boldness which characterized his father. As the\r\nresult of this transaction had an important influence on the future of\r\nsome of the actors in my story, I will detail its programme.\r\n\r\nIt was during the Crimean war. The Russian ports were closed, and Great\r\nBritain and the Continent of Europe were dependent entirely on the\r\nSouthern States for their supply of resinous articles. The rivers at the\r\nSouth were low, and it was not supposed they would rise sufficiently to\r\nfloat produce to market before the occurrence of the spring freshets, in\r\nthe following April or May. Only forty thousand barrels of common rosin\r\nwere held in Wilmington--the largest naval-store port in the world; and\r\nit was estimated that not more than two hundred thousand were on hand in\r\nthe other ports of Savannah, Ga., Georgetown, S. C., Newbern and\r\nWashington, N. C., and in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. Very\r\nlittle was for sale in London, Liverpool, or Glasgow, the largest\r\nforeign markets for the article; and Frank thought that a hundred and\r\nfifty thousand barrels could be purchased. That quantity, taken at once\r\nout of market, would probably so much enhance the value of the article,\r\nthat the operation would realize a large profit before the new crop came\r\nforward. The purchases were to be made simultaneously in the various\r\nmarkets, and about two hundred thousand dollars were required to carry\r\nthrough the transaction. One hundred thousand of this was to be\r\nfurnished in equal proportions by the parties interested; the other\r\nhundred thousand would be realized by Joseph Preston's negotiating 'long\r\nexchange' on Russell, Rollins & Co.\r\n\r\nI declined to embark in the speculation, but the others carried it out\r\nas laid down in the programme; the only deviation being that, at Frank's\r\nsuggestion, Mr. Robert Preston was apprised of the intended movement,\r\nand allowed to purchase, on his own account, as much produce as could be\r\nsecured in Newbern. He bought about seven thousand barrels, paid for\r\nthem by drawing at ninety days on Russell, Rollins, & Co., and held them\r\nfor sale at Newbern, agreeing to satisfy his drafts with the proceeds.\r\nThese drafts amounted to a trifle over eighty-two hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nAbout a month after this transaction was entered into, our firm received\r\nthe following letter from Preston:\r\n\r\n     'GENTLEMEN: An unfortunate difference with my son prevents my\r\n     longer using him as my indorser. I have not, as yet, been able to\r\n     secure another; and, our banks requiring two home names on time\r\n     drafts, I have to beg you to honor a small bill at one day's sight.\r\n     I have drawn for one thousand dollars. Please honor.'\r\n\r\nTo this I at once replied:\r\n\r\n     'DEAR SIR: We have advice of your draft for one thousand dollars.\r\n     To protect your credit, we shall pay it; but we beg you will draw\r\n     no more, till you forward bills of lading.\r\n\r\n     'You are now overdrawn some five thousand dollars, which, by the\r\n     maturing of your drafts, has become a _cash_ advance. The death of\r\n     our senior, Mr. Randall, and the consequent withdrawal of his\r\n     capital, has left us with an extended business and limited means.\r\n     Money, also, is very tight, and we therefore earnestly beg you to\r\n     put us in funds at the earliest possible moment.'\r\n\r\nNo reply was received to this letter; but, about ten days after its\r\ntransmission, Preston himself walked into my private office. His clothes\r\nwere travel stained, and he appeared haggard and careworn. I had never\r\nseen him look so miserably.\r\n\r\nHe met me cordially, and soon referred to the state of his affairs. His\r\nwife, the winter before, had agreed to reside permanently at Newbern,\r\nand content herself with an allowance of three thousand dollars\r\nannually; but at the close of the year he found that she had contracted\r\ndebts to the extent of several thousand more. He was pressed for these\r\ndebts; his interest was in arrears, and he could raise no money for lack\r\nof another indorser. Ruin stared him in the face, unless I again put my\r\nshoulder to the wheel, and pried him out of the mire. The turpentine\r\nbusiness was not paying as well as formerly, but the new plantation was\r\nencumbered with only the original mortgage--less than six thousand\r\ndollars--and was then worth, owing to an advance in the value of land,\r\nfully twenty thousand. He would secure me by a mortgage on that\r\nproperty, but I _must_ allow the present indebtedness to stand, and let\r\nhim increase it four or five thousand dollars. That amount would\r\nextricate him from present difficulties; and, to avoid future\r\nembarrassments, he would take measures for a legal separation from his\r\nwife.\r\n\r\nI heard him through, and then said:\r\n\r\n'I cannot help you, my friend. I am very sorry; but my own affairs are\r\nin a most critical state. I owe over a hundred thousand dollars,\r\nmaturing within twenty days, and my present available resources are not\r\nmore than fifty thousand. I have three hundred thousand worth of produce\r\non hand, but the market is so depressed that I cannot realize a dollar\r\nupon it. The banks have shut down, and money is two per cent. a month in\r\nthe street. What you owe us would aid me wonderfully; but I can rub\r\nthrough without it. That much I can bear, but not a dollar more.'\r\n\r\nHe walked the room for a time, and was silent; then, turning to me, he\r\nsaid--each separate word seeming a groan:\r\n\r\n'I have cursed every one I ever loved, and now I am bringing\r\ntrouble--perhaps disaster--upon _you_, the only real friend I have\r\nleft.'\r\n\r\n'Pshaw! my good fellow, don't talk in that way. What you owe us is only\r\na drop in the bucket. We have made twice that amount out of you; so give\r\nyourself no uneasiness, if you _never_ pay it.'\r\n\r\n'But I must pay it--I _shall_ pay it;' and, continuing to pace the room\r\nsilently for a few moments, he added, giving me his hand: 'Good-by; I'm\r\ngoing back to-night.'\r\n\r\n'Back to-night!--without seeing Selly, or my wife? You are mad!'\r\n\r\n'I _must_ go.'\r\n\r\n'You must _not_ go. You are letting affairs trouble you too much. Come,\r\ngo home with me, and see Kate. A few words from her will make a new man\r\nof you.'\r\n\r\n'No, no; I must go back at once. I must raise this money somehow.'\r\n\r\n'Send money to the dogs! Come with me, and have a good night's rest.\r\nYou'll think better of this in the morning. And now it occurs to me that\r\nKate has about seven thousand belonging to Frank. He means to settle it\r\non Selly when they are married, and she might as well have it first as\r\nlast. Perhaps you can get it now.'\r\n\r\n'But I might be robbing my own child.'\r\n\r\n'You can give the farm as security; it's worth twice the amount.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll stay. Let us see your wife at once.'\r\n\r\nWhile we were seated in the parlor, after supper, I broached the subject\r\nof Preston's wants to Kate. She heard me through attentively, and then\r\nquietly said:\r\n\r\n'Frank is of age--he can do as he pleases; but _I_ would not advise him\r\nto make the loan. I once heard my father scout at the idea of taking\r\nsecurity on property a thousand miles away. I would not wound Mr.\r\nPreston's feelings, but--his wife's extravagance has led him into this\r\ndifficulty, and her property should extricate him from it. Her town\r\nhouse, horses, and carriages should be sold. She ought to be made to\r\nfeel some of the mortification she has brought upon him.'\r\n\r\nPreston's face brightened; a new idea seemed to strike him. 'You are\r\nright. I will sell everything.' His face clouded again, as he continued:\r\n'But I cannot realize soon enough. Your husband needs money at once.'\r\n\r\n'Never mind me; I can take care of myself. But what is this trouble with\r\nJoe? Tell me, I will arrange it. Everything can go on smoothly again.'\r\n\r\n'It cannot be arranged. There can be no reconciliation between us.'\r\n\r\n'What prevents? Who is at fault--you, or he?'\r\n\r\n'I am. He will never forgive me!'\r\n\r\n'Forgive you! I can't imagine what you have done, that admits of no\r\nforgiveness.'\r\n\r\nHe rose, and walked the room for a while in gloomy silence, then said:\r\n\r\n'I will tell you. It is right you should know. You _both_ should know\r\nthe sort of man you have esteemed and befriended for so many years;'\r\nand, resuming his seat, he related the following occurrences:\r\n\r\n'Everything went on as usual at the plantation, till some months after\r\nRosey's marriage to Ally. Then a child was born to them. It was white.\r\nRosey refused to reveal its father, but it was evidently not her\r\nhusband. Ally, being a proud, high-spirited fellow, took the thing\r\nterribly to heart. He refused to live with his wife, or even to see her.\r\nI tried to reconcile them, but without success. Old Dinah, who had\r\npreviously doted on Rosey, turned about, and began to beat and abuse her\r\ncruelly. To keep the child out of the old woman's way, I took her into\r\nthe house, and she remained there till about two months ago. Then, one\r\nday, Larkin, the trader, of whom you bought Phylly and the children,\r\ncame to me, wanting a woman house-servant. I was pressed for money, and\r\nI offered him--a thing I never did before--two or three of my family\r\nslaves. They did not suit, but he said Rosey would, and proposed to buy\r\nher and the child. I refused. He offered me fifteen hundred dollars for\r\nthem, but I still refused. Then he told me that he had spoken to the\r\ngirl, and she wished him to buy her. I doubted it, and said so; but he\r\ncalled Rosey to us, and she confirmed it, and, in an excited way, told\r\nme she would run away, or drown herself, if I did not sell her. She said\r\nshe could live no longer on the same plantation with Ally. I told her I\r\nwould send Ally away; but she replied: 'No; I am tired of this place. I\r\nhave suffered so much here, I want to get away. I _shall_ go; whether\r\nalive or dead, is for _you_ to say.' I saw she was in earnest; I was\r\nhard pressed for money; Larkin promised to get her a kind master, and--I\r\nsold her.'\r\n\r\n'Sold her! My God! Preston, she was your own child!'\r\n\r\n'I know it,' he replied, burying his face in his hands. 'The curse of\r\nGOD was on it; it has been on me for years.' After a few moments, he\r\nadded: 'But hear the rest, and _you_ will curse me, too.'\r\n\r\nOvercome with emotion, he groaned audibly. I said nothing, and a pause\r\nof some minutes ensued. Then, in a choked, broken voice, he continued:\r\n\r\n'The rosin transaction had been gone into. I had used up what blank\r\nindorsements I had. Needing more, and wanting to consult with Joe about\r\nselling the rosin, I went to Mobile. It was five weeks ago. I arrived\r\nthere about dark, and put up at the Battle House. Joe had boarded there.\r\nI was told he had left, and gone to housekeeping. A negro conducted me\r\nto a small house in the outskirts of the town. He said Joe lived there.\r\nWishing to surprise him, I went in without knocking. The house had two\r\nparlors, separated by folding doors. In the back one a young woman was\r\nclearing away the tea things; in the front one, Joe was seated by the\r\nfire, with a young child on his knee. I put my hand on his shoulder, and\r\nsaid: 'Joe, whose child have you here?' He looked up, and laughingly\r\nsaid: 'Why, father, you ought to know; you've seen it before!' I looked\r\nclosely at it--it was Rosey's! I said so. 'Yes, father,' he replied;\r\n'and there's Rosey herself. Larkin promised she should have a kind\r\nmaster, and--he kept his word.' The truth flashed upon me--the child was\r\nhis! My only son had seduced his _own sister_! I staggered back in\r\nhorror. I told him who Rosey was, and then'--no words can express the\r\nintense agony depicted on his face as he said this--'then he cursed me!\r\nO my God! HE CURSED ME!'\r\n\r\nI pitied him, I could but pity him; and I said:\r\n\r\n'Do not be so cast down, my friend. I once heard you say: 'The Lord is\r\ngood. His mercy is everlasting!''\r\n\r\n'But he cannot have mercy on some!' he cried. '_My_ sins have been too\r\ngreat; they cannot be blotted out. I embittered the life of my wife; I\r\nhave driven my daughter from her home; sold my own child; made my\r\ngenerous, noble-hearted boy do a horrible crime--a crime that will\r\nhaunt him forever. Oh! the curse of God is on me. My misery is greater\r\nthan I can bear.'\r\n\r\n'No, my friend; God curses none of his creatures. You have reaped what\r\nyou have sown, that is all; but you have suffered enough. Better things,\r\nbelieve me, are in store for you.'\r\n\r\n'No, no; everything is gone--wife, children, all! I am alone--the past,\r\nnothing but remorse; the future, ruin and dishonor!'\r\n\r\n'But Selly is left you. _She_ will always love you.'\r\n\r\n'No, no! Even Selly would curse me, if she knew _all_!'\r\n\r\nNo one spoke for a full half hour, and he continued pacing up and down\r\nthe room. When, at last, he seated himself, more composed, I asked:\r\n\r\n'What became of Rosey and the child?'\r\n\r\n'I do not know. I was shut in my room for several days. When I got out,\r\nI was told Joe had freed her, and she had disappeared, no one knew\r\nwhither. I tried every means to trace her, but could not. At the end of\r\na week, I went home, what you see me--a broken-hearted man.'\r\n\r\nThe next morning, despite our urgent entreaties, he returned to the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe twenty days were expiring. By hard struggling I had met my\r\nliabilities, but the last day--the crisis--was approaching. Thirty\r\nthousand dollars of our acceptances had accumulated together, and were\r\nmaturing on that day. When I went home, on the preceding night, we had\r\nonly nineteen thousand in bank. I had exhausted all our receivables.\r\nWhere the eleven thousand was to come from, I did not know. Only one\r\nresource seemed left me--the hypothecation of produce; and a resort to\r\nthat, at that time, before warehouse receipts became legitimate\r\nsecurities, would be ruinous to our credit. My position was a terrible\r\none. No one not a merchant can appreciate or realize it. With thousands\r\nupon thousands of assets, the accumulations of years, my standing among\r\nmerchants, and, what I valued more than all, my untarnished credit, were\r\nin jeopardy for the want of a paltry sum.\r\n\r\nI went home that night with a heavy heart; but Kate's hopeful words\r\nencouraged me. With her and the children left to me, I need not care for\r\nthe rest; all might go, and I could commence again at the bottom of the\r\nhill. The next morning I walked down town with a firm spirit, ready to\r\nmeet disaster like a man. The letters by the early mail were on my desk.\r\nI opened them one after another, hurriedly, eagerly. There were no\r\nremittances! I had expected at least five thousand dollars. For a moment\r\nmy courage failed me. I rose, and paced the room, and thoughts like\r\nthese passed through my mind: 'The last alternative has come. Pride must\r\ngive way to duty. I must hypothecate produce, and protect my\r\ncorrespondents. I must sacrifice myself to save my friends!\r\n\r\n'But here are two letters I have thrown aside. They are addressed to me\r\npersonally. Mere letters of friendship! What is friendship, at a time\r\nlike this?--friendship without money! Pshaw! I wouldn't give a fig for\r\nall the friends in the world!'\r\n\r\nMechanically I opened one of them. An enclosure dropped to the floor.\r\nWithout pausing to pick it up, I read:\r\n\r\n     'DEAR FATHER: Mother writes me you are hard pressed. Sell my U. S.\r\n     stock--it will realize over seven thousand. It is yours. Enclosed\r\n     is Cragin's certified check for ten thousand. If you need more,\r\n     draw on _him_, at sight, for any amount. He says he will stand by\r\n     you to the death.\r\n\r\n                                   'Love to mother.\r\n                                              FRANK.'\r\n\r\n     'P. S.--Fire away, old fellow! Hallet is ugly, but I'll go my pile\r\n     on you, spite of the devil.\r\n                                             CRAGIN.'\r\n\r\n\r\n'SAVED! saved by my wife and child!' I leaned my head on my desk. When I\r\nrose, there were tears upon it.\r\n\r\nIt wanted some minutes of ten, but I was nervously impatient to blot out\r\nthose terrible acceptances. I should then be safe; I should then breathe\r\nfreely. As I passed out of my private office, I opened the other letter.\r\nIt was from Preston. Pausing a moment, I read it:\r\n\r\n     'MY VERY DEAR FRIEND: I enclose you sight check of Branch Bank of\r\n     Cape Fear on Bank of Republic, for $10,820. Apply what is needed to\r\n     pay my account; the rest hold subject to my drafts.\r\n\r\n     'I have sold my town house, furniture, horses, etc., and the\r\n     proceeds will pay my home debts. I shall therefore not need to draw\r\n     the balance for, say, sixty days. God bless you!'\r\n\r\n'Well, the age of miracles is _not_ passed! How _did_ he raise the\r\nmoney?'\r\n\r\nStepping back into the private office, I called my partner:\r\n\r\n'Draw checks for all the acceptances due to-day; get them certified, and\r\ntake up the bills at once. Don't let the grass grow under your feet. I\r\nshall be away the rest of the day, and I want to see them before I go.\r\nHere is a draft from Preston; it will make our account good.'\r\n\r\nHe looked at it, and, laughing, said:\r\n\r\n'Yes, and leave about fifty dollars in bank.'\r\n\r\n'Well, never mind; we are out of the woods.'\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, I sat down, and wrote the following letter:\r\n\r\n     'MY DEAR FRANK: I return Cragin's check, with many thanks. I have\r\n     not sold your stock. My legitimate resources have carried me\r\n     through.\r\n\r\n     'I need not say, my boy, that I feel what you would have done for\r\n     me. Words are not needed between _us_.\r\n\r\n     'Tell Cragin that I consider him a trump--the very ace of hearts.\r\n\r\n     'Your mother and I will see you in a few days.'\r\n\r\nIn half an hour, with the two letters in my pocket, I was on my way\r\nhome. Handing them to Kate, I took her in my arms; and, as I brushed the\r\nstill bright, golden hair from her broad forehead, I felt I was the\r\nrichest man living.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithin the same week I went to Boston. I arrived just after dark; and\r\nthen occurred the events narrated in the first chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR.\r\n\r\n[J. G. PERCIVAL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  For war is now upon their shores,\r\n    And we must meet the foe,\r\n  Must go where battle's thunder roars,\r\n    And brave men slumber low;\r\n  Go, where the sleep of death comes on\r\n    The proudest hearts, who dare\r\n  To grasp the wreath by valor won,\r\n    And glory's banquet share.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER ON WONDERS.\r\n\r\n  'Obstupui! steteruntque comæ, et vox faucibus hæsit.'\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a certain portion of mankind ever on the alert to see or hear\r\nsome wonderful thing; whose minds are attuned to a marvellous key, and\r\nvibrate with extreme sensitiveness to the slightest touch; whose vital\r\nfluid is the air of romance, and whose algebraic symbol is a mark of\r\nexclamation! This sentiment, existing in some persons to a greater\r\ndegree than in others, is often fostered by education and association,\r\nso as to become the all-engrossing passion. Children, of course, begin\r\nto wonder as soon as their eyes are opened upon the strange scenes of\r\ntheir future operations. The first thing usually done to develop their\r\ndawning intellect, is to display before them such objects as are best\r\ncalculated to arrest their attention, and keep them in a continual state\r\nof excitement. This course is succeeded by a supply of all sorts of\r\n_toys_, to gratify the passion of novelty. These are followed by\r\nwonderful stories, and books of every variety of absurd\r\nimpossibilities;--which system of development is, it would seem,\r\nentirely based upon the presumption, that the faculty of admiration must\r\nbe expanded, in order that the young idea may best learn how to _shoot_.\r\nIt is therefore quite natural, that--the predisposition granted--a\r\nfaculty of the mind so auspiciously nurtured under the influence of\r\nexaggeration should mature in a corresponding degree.\r\n\r\nThus we have in our midst a class, into whose mental economy the faculty\r\nof _wonder_ is so thoroughly infused, that it has inoculated the entire\r\nsystem, and forms an inherent, inexplicable, and almost elementary part\r\nof it. These persons sail about in their pleasure yachts, on roving\r\nexpeditions, under a pretended '_right of search_,' armed to the teeth,\r\nand boarding all sorts of crafts to obtain plunder for their favorite\r\ngratification. They are most uneasy and uncomfortable companions, having\r\nno ear for commonplace subjects of conversation, and no eye for ordinary\r\nobjects of sight.\r\n\r\nWhen such persons approach each other, they are mutually attracted, like\r\ntwo bodies charged with different kinds of electricity--an interchange\r\nof commodities takes place, repulsion follows, and thus reënforced, they\r\nseparate to diffuse the supply of wonders collected.\r\n\r\nBy this centripetal and centrifugal process, the social atmosphere is\r\nsubjected to a continual state of agitation. _Language_ is altogether\r\ntoo tame to give full effect to their meaning, and all the varieties of\r\n_dumb show_, of _gesticulation_, _shrugs_, and wise shakes of the head,\r\nare called into requisition, to effectually and unmistakably express\r\ntheir ideas. The usages of good society are regarded by them as a great\r\nrestraint upon their besetting propensity to expatiate in phrases of\r\ngrandiloquence, and to magnify objects of trivial importance. They are\r\nalways sure to initiate topics which will afford scope for admiration;\r\nthey delight to enlarge upon the unprecedented growth of cities,\r\nvillages, and towns; upon the comparative prices of 'corner lots' at\r\ndifferent periods; and to calculate how rich they _might_ have been, had\r\nthey only known as much _then_ as _now_.\r\n\r\nThey experience a gratification when a rich man dies, that the wonder\r\nwill now be solved as to the amount of his property; and when a man\r\nfails in business, that it is _now_ made clear--what has so long\r\nperplexed them--'_how he managed to live so extravagantly_!' See them\r\nat an agricultural fair, and they will be found examining the 'mammoth\r\nsquashes' and various products of prodigious growth--or they will\r\ninstall themselves as self-appointed exhibiter of the 'Fat Baby,' to\r\ninform the incredulous how much it weighs! See them at a conflagration,\r\nand they wonder what was the _cause_ of the fire, and _how far_ it will\r\nextend?\r\n\r\nThey long to travel, that they may visit 'mammoth caves' and 'Giant's\r\nCauseways.' We talk of the 'Seven Wonders of the World,' while to them\r\nthere is a successive series for every day in the year--putting to the\r\nblush our meagre stock of monstrosities--making 'Ossa like a wart.'\r\nNothing gratifies them more than the issuing from the press of an\r\nanonymous work, that they may exert their ingenuity in endeavoring to\r\ndiscover the author; and, when called on for information on the subject,\r\nprove conclusively to every one but themselves, that they know nothing\r\nwhatever about the matter.\r\n\r\nThe ocean is to them only wonderful as the abode of 'Leviathans,' and\r\n'Sea Serpents,' 'Krakens,' and 'Mermaids'--abounding in 'Mäelstroms' and\r\n_sunken_ islands, and traversed by 'Phantom Ships' and 'Flying Dutchmen'\r\nin perpetual search for some 'lost Atlantis;'--all well-attested\r\nincredibilities, certified to by the 'affidavits of respectable\r\neye-witnesses,' and, we might add, by 'intelligent contrabands,'--and\r\nall in strict conformity with the convenient aphorism '_Credo quia\r\nimpossibile est_.' They are ever ready to bestow their amazement upon a\r\nfresh miracle as soon as the present has had its day--like the man who,\r\nbeing landed at some distance by the explosion of a juggler's\r\npyrotechnics, rubbed his eyes open, and exclaimed, '_I wonder what the\r\nfellow will do next!_'\r\n\r\nIf a steamboat explodes her boiler, or the walls of a factory fall,\r\nburying hundreds in the ruins, their hearts--rendered callous by the\r\nconstant stream of cold air pouring in through their _ever-open\r\nmouths_--are not shocked at the calamity, but they wonder if it was\r\n_insured_!\r\n\r\nThe increase of population in this country affords a most prolific and\r\ninexhaustible fund for statistical astonishment, as an interlude to the\r\nentertainment, while something more appalling is being prepared.\r\n\r\nThe portentous omens so often relied on by the credulous believers in\r\nsigns, have so frequently proved 'dead failures,' that one would suppose\r\nthese votaries would at length become disheartened. But this seems not\r\nto be the case--like a quack doctor when his patient dies, their\r\naudacity is equal to any emergency, and, with the elasticity of india\r\nrubber, they come out of a 'tight squeeze' with undiminished rotundity.\r\nWith _stupid_ amazement, hair all erect, and ears likewise, they pass\r\nthrough life as through a museum, ready to exclaim with Dominie Sampson\r\nat all _they_ cannot understand, 'Pro--di--gi--ous!'\r\n\r\nIt matters little, perhaps, in what form this principle is exhibited,\r\nwhile it exists and flourishes in undiminished exuberance. Thus says\r\nGlendower:\r\n\r\n                      'At my nativity\r\n  The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,\r\n  Of burning cressets; and, at my birth,\r\n  The frame and huge foundation of the earth\r\n  Shak'd like a coward.\r\n\r\n  _Hotspur._ Why so it would have done\r\n  At the same season, if your mother's cat had\r\n  But kittened, though yourself had ne'er been born.'\r\n\r\nGlendower naturally enough flouts this rather impertinent comment, and\r\n'repeats the story of his birth' with still greater improvements, till\r\nHotspur gives him a piece of advice which will do for his whole race of\r\nthe present day, viz., 'tell the truth, and shame the devil.'\r\n\r\nThe English people of this generation are rather more phlegmatic than\r\ntheir explosive neighbors across the channel, and neither the injustice\r\nof black slavery abroad, nor the starvation of _white_ slaves at home,\r\ncan shake them from their lop-sided neutrality, _so long as money goes\r\ninto their pocket_. The excitable French, on the contrary, require an\r\noccasional _coup d'état_ to arouse their conjectures as to the next\r\nimperial experiment in the art of international diplomacy.\r\n\r\nThe press of the day teems with all sorts of provisions to satisfy the\r\ncravings of a depraved imagination, and even the most sedate of our\r\ndaily papers are not above employing 'double-leaded Sensations,' and\r\n'display Heads' as a part of their ordinary stock in trade; while from\r\nthe hebdomadals, 'Thrilling Tales,' 'Awful Disclosures,' and 'Startling\r\nDiscoveries,' succeed each other with truly fearful rapidity. Thus he\r\nwho wastes the midnight kerosene, and spoils his weary eyes in poring\r\nover the pages of trashy productions, so well designed to murder sleep,\r\nmay truly say with Macbeth, 'I have supp'd full with horrors.'\r\n\r\nIt is certainly remarkable (as an indication of the pleasure the\r\nmultitude take in voluntarily perplexing themselves), how eagerly they\r\nenter into all sorts of contrivances which conduce to bewilderment and\r\ndoubt. In 'Hampton Court' there is a famous enclosure called the\r\n'_Maze_,' so arranged with hedged alleys as to form a perfect labyrinth.\r\nTo this place throngs of persons are constantly repairing, to enjoy the\r\nluxury of losing themselves, and of seeing others in the same\r\npredicament.\r\n\r\nSome persons become so impatient of the constant demand upon their\r\nadmiration, that they resist whatever seems to lead in that direction.\r\nWashington Irving said he 'never liked to walk with his host over the\r\nlatter's ground'--a feeling which many will at once acknowledge having\r\nexperienced. A celebrated English traveller was so annoyed by the urgent\r\ninvitations of the Philadelphians to visit the Fairmount Water Works,\r\nthat he resolved _not_ to visit them, so that he might have the\r\ncharacteristic satisfaction of recording the ill-natured fact.\r\n\r\n'Swift mentions a gentleman who made it a rule in reading, to skip over\r\nall sentences where he spied a note of admiration at the end.'\r\n\r\nThe instances here quoted are, to be sure, carrying out the '_Nil\r\nadmirari_' principle rather to extremes, and are not recommended for\r\ngeneral observance. The most remarkable and prominent wonders in the\r\nnatural world seldom meet the expectation of the beholder, because he\r\nlooks to experience a new sensation, and is disappointed; and so with\r\nworks of art, as St. Peter's at Rome--\r\n\r\n    ----'its grandeur overwhelms thee not,\r\n  And why? it is not lessen'd; but thy mind,\r\n  Expanded by the genius of the spot,\r\n  Has grown colossal.'\r\n\r\n_Wonder_ is defined as 'the effect of novelty upon ignorance.' Most\r\nobjects which excite wonder are magnified by the distance or the point\r\nof view, and their proportions diminish and shrink as we approach them.\r\nIt is a saying as old as Horace, 'ignotum pro magnifico est': we cease\r\nto wonder at what we understand. Seneca says that those whose habits are\r\ntemperate are satisfied with fountain water, which is cold enough for\r\nthem; while those who have lived high and luxuriously, require the use\r\nof _ice_. Thus a well-disciplined mind adjusts itself to whatever events\r\nmay occur, and not being likely to lose its equanimity upon ordinary\r\noccasions, is equally well prepared for more serious results.\r\n\r\n'Let us never wonder,' again saith Seneca, 'at anything we are born to;\r\nfor no man has reason to complain where we are all in the same\r\ncondition.' But notwithstanding all the precepts of philosophers, the\r\nadvice of all men of sense, and the best examples for our guides, we go\r\non, with eyes dilated and minds wide open, to see, hear, and receive\r\nimpressions through distorted mediums, leading to wrong conclusions and\r\nendless mistakes.\r\n\r\n'Wonders will never cease!' Of course they will not, so long as there\r\nare so many persons engaged in providing the aliment for their\r\nsustenance; so long as the demand exceeds the supply; so long as mankind\r\nare more disposed to listen to exaggeration rather than to simple\r\ntruths, and so long as they shall tolerate the race of _wonder-mongers_,\r\ngiving them 'aid and comfort,' regardless of their being enemies of our\r\npeace, and the pests of our social community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN.\r\n\r\n\r\n  July,--what is the news they tell?\r\n    A battle won: our eyes are dim,\r\n  And sad forbodings press the heart\r\n    Anxious, awaiting news from him.\r\n  Hour drags on hour: fond heart, be still,\r\n    Shall evil tidings break the spell?\r\n  A word at last!--they found him dead;\r\n    He fought in the advance, and fell.\r\n\r\n  Oh aloes of affliction poured\r\n    Into the wine cup of the soul!\r\n  Oh bitterness of anguish stored\r\n    To fill our grief beyond control!\r\n  At last he comes, awaited long,\r\n    Not to home welcomes warm and loud,\r\n  Not to the voice of mirth and song,\r\n    Pale featured, cold, beneath a shroud.\r\n\r\n  Oh from the morrow of our lives\r\n    A glowing hope has stolen away,\r\n  A something from the sun has fled,\r\n    That dims the glory of the day.\r\n  More earnestly we look beyond\r\n    The present life to that to be;\r\n  Another influence draws the soul\r\n    To long for that futurity.\r\n\r\n  Pardon if anguished souls refrain\r\n    Too little, grieving for the lost,\r\n  From thinking dearly bought the gain\r\n    Of victory at such fearful cost.\r\n  Teach us as dearest gain to prize\r\n    The glory crown he early won;\r\n  Forever shall his requiem rise:\r\n    Rest thee in peace, thy duty done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNION.\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA AND PENNSYLVANIA COMPARED.\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginia was a considerable colony, when Pennsylvania was occupied only\r\nby Indian tribes. In 1790, Virginia was first in rank of all the States,\r\nher number of inhabitants being 748,308. (Census Rep., 120,121.)\r\nPennsylvania then ranked the second, numbering 434,373 persons. (Ib.) In\r\n1860 the population of Virginia was 1,596,318, ranking the fifth;\r\nPennsylvania still remaining the second, and numbering 2,905,115. (Ib.)\r\nIn 1790 the population of Virginia exceeded that of Pennsylvania\r\n313,925; in 1860 the excess in favor of Pennsylvania was 1,308,797. The\r\nratio of increase of population of Virginia from 1790 to 1860 was 113.32\r\nper cent., and of Pennsylvania in the same period, 569.03. At the same\r\nrelative ratio of increase for the next seventy years, Virginia would\r\ncontain a population of 3,405,265 in 1930; and Pennsylvania 19,443,934,\r\nexceeding that of England. Such has been and would continue to be the\r\neffect of slavery in retarding the progress of Virginia, and such the\r\ninfluence of freedom in the rapid advance of Pennsylvania. Indeed, with\r\nthe maintenance and perpetuity of the Union in all its integrity, the\r\ndestiny of Pennsylvania will surpass the most sanguine expectations.\r\n\r\nThe population of Virginia per square mile in 1790 was 12.19, and in\r\n1860, 26.02; whilst that of Pennsylvania in 1790 was 9.44, and in 1860,\r\n63.18. (Ib.) The absolute increase of the population of Virginia per\r\nsquare mile, from 1790 to 1860, was 13.83, and from 1850 to 1860, 2.85;\r\nwhilst that of Pennsylvania from 1790 to 1860, was 53.74, and from 1850\r\nto 1860, 12.93. (Ib.)\r\n\r\nAREA.--The area of Virginia is 61,352 square miles, and of Pennsylvania,\r\n46,000, the difference being 15,352 square miles, which is greater, by\r\n758 square miles, than the aggregate area of Massachusetts, Connecticut,\r\nand Delaware, containing in 1860 a population of 1,803,429. (Ib.)\r\nRetaining their respective ratios of increase per square mile from 1790\r\nto 1860, and reversing their areas, that of Virginia in 1860 would have\r\nbeen 1,196,920, and of Pennsylvania 3,876,119. Reversing the numbers of\r\neach State in 1790, the ratio of increase in each remaining the same,\r\nthe population of Pennsylvania in 1860 would have been 5,408,424, and\r\nthat of Virginia, 926,603. Reversing both the areas and numbers in 1790,\r\nand the population of Pennsylvania would have exceeded that of Virginia\r\nin 1860 more than six millions.\r\n\r\nSHORE LINE.--By the Tables of the Coast Survey, the shore line of\r\nVirginia is 1,571 miles, and of Pennsylvania only 60 miles. This vastly\r\nsuperior coast line of Virginia, with better, deeper, more capacious,\r\nand much more numerous harbors, unobstructed by ice, and with easy\r\naccess for so many hundred miles by navigable bays and tide-water rivers\r\nleading so far into the interior, give to Virginia great advantages over\r\nPennsylvania in commerce and every branch of industry. Indeed, in this\r\nrespect, Virginia stands unrivalled in the Union. The hydraulic power of\r\nVirginia greatly exceeds that of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nMINES.--Pennsylvania excels every other State in mineral wealth, but\r\nVirginia comes next.\r\n\r\nSOIL.--In natural fertility of soil, the two States are about equal;\r\nbut the seasons in Virginia are more favorable, both for crops and\r\nstock, than in Pennsylvania. Virginia has all the agricultural products\r\nof Pennsylvania, with cotton in addition. The area, however, of Virginia\r\n(39,265,280 acres) being greater by 9,825,280 acres than that of\r\nPennsylvania (29,440,000 acres), gives to Virginia vast advantages.\r\n\r\nIn her greater area, her far superior coast line, harbors, rivers, and\r\nhydraulic power, her longer and better seasons for crops and stock, and\r\ngreater variety of products, Virginia has vast natural advantages, and\r\nwith nearly double the population of Pennsylvania in 1790. And yet,\r\nwhere has slavery placed Virginia? Pennsylvania exceeds her now in\r\nnumbers 1,308,797, and increased in population, from 1790 to 1860, in a\r\nratio more than five to one. Such is the terrible contrast between free\r\nand slave institutions!\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF WEALTH.--By Census Tables (1860) 33 and 36, it appears\r\n(omitting commerce) that the products of industry, as given, viz., of\r\nagriculture, manufactures, mines, and fisheries, were that year in\r\nPennsylvania, of the value of $398,600,000, or $137 per capita; and in\r\nVirginia, $120,000,000 or $75 per capita. This shows a total value of\r\nproduct in Pennsylvania much more than three times that of Virginia,\r\nand, per capita, nearly two to one. That is, the average value of the\r\nproduct of the labor of each person in Pennsylvania, is nearly double\r\nthat of each person, including slaves, in Virginia. Thus is proved the\r\nvast superiority of free over slave labor, and the immense national loss\r\noccasioned by the substitution of the latter for the former.\r\n\r\nAs to the rate of increase; the value of the products of Virginia in\r\n1850 was $84,480,428 (Table 9), and in Pennsylvania, $229,567,131,\r\nshowing an increase in Virginia, from 1850 to 1860, of $35,519,572,\r\nbeing 41 per cent.; and in Pennsylvania, $169,032,869, being 50 per\r\ncent.; exhibiting a difference of 9 per cent. in favor of Pennsylvania.\r\nBy the Census Table of 1860, No. 35, p. 195, the true value then of the\r\nreal and personal property was, in Pennsylvania, $1,416,501,818, and of\r\nVirginia, $793,249,681. Now, we have seen, the value of the products in\r\nPennsylvania in 1860 was $398,600,000, and in Virginia, $120,000,000.\r\nThus, as a question of the annual yield of capital, that of Pennsylvania\r\nwas 28.13 per cent., and of Virginia, 15.13 per cent. By Census Table\r\n35, the total value of the real and personal property of Pennsylvania\r\nwas $722,486,120 in 1850, and $1,416,501,818 in 1860, showing an\r\nincrease, in that decade, of $694,015,698, being 96.05 per cent.; and in\r\nVirginia, $430,701,082 in 1850, and $793,249,681 in 1860, showing an\r\nincrease of $362,548,599, or 84.17 per cent.\r\n\r\nBy Table 36, p. 196, Census of 1860, the _cash_ value of the farms of\r\nVirginia was $371,092,211, being $11.91 per acre; and of Pennsylvania,\r\n$662,050,707, being $38.91 per acre. Now, by this table, the number of\r\nacres embraced in these farms of Pennsylvania was 17,012,153 acres, and\r\nin Virginia, 31,014,950; the difference of value per acre being $27, or\r\nlargely more than three to one in favor of Pennsylvania, Now, if we\r\nmultiply the farm lands of Virginia by the Pennsylvania value per acre,\r\nit would make the total value of the farm lands of Virginia\r\n$1,204,791,804; and the _additional_ value, caused by emancipation,\r\n$835,699,593, which is more, by $688,440,093, than the value of all the\r\nslaves of Virginia. But the whole area of Virginia is 39,265,280 acres,\r\ndeducting from which the farm lands, there remain unoccupied 8,250,330\r\nacres. Now, if (as would be in the absence of slavery,) the population\r\nper square mile of Virginia equalled that of Pennsylvania, three fifths\r\nof these lands would have been occupied as farms, viz., 4,950,198,\r\nwhich, at the Pennsylvania value per acre, would have been worth\r\n$188,207,524. Deduct from this their present average value of $2 per\r\nacre, $9,800,396, and the remainder, $178,407,128, is the sum by which\r\nthe unoccupied lands of Virginia, converted into farms, would have been\r\nincreased in value by emancipation. Add this to the enhanced value of\r\ntheir present farms, and the result is $1,014,106,721 as the gain, on\r\nthis basis, of Virginia in the value of her lands, by emancipation. To\r\nthese we should add the increased value of town and city lots and\r\nimprovements, and of personal property, and, with emancipation, Virginia\r\nwould now have an augmented wealth of at least one billion and a half of\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThe earnings of commerce are not given in the Census Tables, which would\r\nvastly increase the difference in the value of their annual products in\r\nfavor of Pennsylvania as compared with Virginia. These earnings include\r\nall not embraced under the heads of agriculture, manufactures, the\r\nmines, and fisheries. Let us examine some of these statistics.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS.--The number of miles of railroads in operation in\r\nPennsylvania in 1860, including city roads, was 2,690.49 miles, costing\r\n$147,283,410; and in Virginia, 1,771 miles, costing $64,958,807. (Census\r\nTable of 1860, No. 38, pp. 230, 232.) The annual value of the freight\r\ncarried on these roads is estimated at $200,000,000 more in Pennsylvania\r\nthan in Virginia, and the passenger account would still more increase\r\nthe disparity.\r\n\r\nCANALS.--The number of miles of canals in Pennsylvania in 1860 was\r\n1,259, and their cost, $42,015,000. In Virginia the number of miles was\r\n178, and the cost, $7,817,000. (Census Table 39, p. 238.) The estimated\r\nvalue of the freight on the Pennsylvania canals is ten times that of the\r\nfreight on the Virginia canals.\r\n\r\nTONNAGE.--The tonnage of vessels built in Pennsylvania in 1860 was\r\n21,615 tons, and in Virginia, 4,372. (Census, p. 107.)\r\n\r\nBANKS.--The number of banks in Pennsylvania in 1860 was 90; capital,\r\n$25,565,582; loans, $50,327,127; specie, $8,378,474; circulation,\r\n13,132,892; deposits, $26,167,143:--and in Virginia the number was 65;\r\ncapital, $16,005,156; loans, $24,975,792; specie, $2,943,652;\r\ncirculation, $9,812,197; deposits, $7,729,652. (Census Table 35, p.\r\n193.)\r\n\r\nEXPORTS AND IMPORTS, ETC.--Our exports abroad from Pennsylvania, for the\r\nfiscal year ending 30th June, 1860, and foreign imports, were of the\r\nvalue of $20,262,608. The clearances, same year, from Pennsylvania, and\r\nentries were 336,848 tons. In Virginia the exports the same year, and\r\nforeign imports were of the value of $7,184,273; clearances and entries,\r\n178,143 tons, (Table 14, Register of U.S. Treasury.) Revenue from\r\ncustoms, same year, in Pennsylvania, $2,552,924, and in Virginia,\r\n$189,816; or more than twelve to one in favor of Pennsylvania. (Tables\r\nU.S. Commissioner of Customs.) No returns are given for the coastwise\r\nand internal trade of either State; but the railway and canal\r\ntransportation of both States shows a difference of ten to one in favor\r\nof Pennsylvania. And yet, Virginia, as we have seen, had much greater\r\nnatural advantages than Pennsylvania for commerce, foreign and internal,\r\nher shore line up to head of tide-water being 1,571 miles, and\r\nPennsylvania only 60 miles.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, exclusive of commerce, the products of Pennsylvania\r\nin 1860 were of the value of $398,600,000, or $137 per capita; and in\r\nVirginia, $120,000,000, or $75 per capita. But, if we add the earnings\r\nof commerce, the products of Pennsylvania must have exceeded those of\r\nVirginia much more than four to one, and have reached, per capita,\r\nnearly three to one. What but slavery could have produced such amazing\r\nresults? Indeed, when we see the same effects in _all_ the Free States\r\nas compared with _all_ the Slave States, and in _any_ of the Slave\r\nStates, as compared with _any_ of the Free States, the uniformity of\r\nresults establishes the law beyond all controversy, that slavery\r\nretards immensely the progress of wealth and population.\r\n\r\nThat the Tariff has produced none of these results, is shown by the fact\r\nthat the agriculture and commerce of Pennsylvania vastly exceed those of\r\nVirginia, and yet these are the interests supposed to be most\r\ninjuriously affected by high tariffs. But there is still more conclusive\r\nproof. The year 1824 was the commencement of the era of high tariffs,\r\nand yet, from 1790 to 1820, as proved by the Census, the percentage of\r\nincrease of Pennsylvania over Virginia was greater than from 1820 to\r\n1860. Thus, by Table 1 of the Census, p. 124, the increase of population\r\nin Virginia was as follows:\r\n\r\n  From 1790 to 1800  17.63 per cent.\r\n    \"  1800 \"  1810  10.73    \"\r\n    \"  1810 \"  1820   9.31    \"\r\n    \"  1820 \"  1830  13.71    \"\r\n    \"  1830 \"  1840   2.34    \"\r\n    \"  1840 \"  1850  14.60    \"\r\n    \"  1850 \"  1860  12.29    \"\r\n\r\nThe increase of population in Pennsylvania was:\r\n\r\n  From 1790 to 1800  38.67 per cent.\r\n    \"  1800 \"  1810  34.49    \"\r\n    \"  1810 \"  1820  29.55    \"\r\n    \"  1820 \"  1830  28.47    \"\r\n    \"  1830 \"  1840  27.87    \"\r\n    \"  1840 \"  1850  34.09    \"\r\n    \"  1850 \"  1860  25.71    \"\r\n\r\nIn 1790 the population of Virginia was 748,318; in 1820, 1,065,129, and\r\nin 1860, 1,596,318. In 1790 the population of Pennsylvania was 434,373;\r\nin 1820, 1,348,233, and in 1860, 2,906,115. Thus, from 1790 to 1820,\r\nbefore the inauguration of the protective policy, the relative increase\r\nof the population of Pennsylvania, as compared with Virginia, was very\r\nfar greater than from 1820 to 1860. It is quite clear, then, that the\r\ntariff had no influence in depressing the progress of Virginia as\r\ncompared with Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nHaving shown how much the material progress of Virginia has been\r\nretarded by slavery, let us now consider its effect upon her moral and\r\nintellectual development.\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS.--The number of newspapers and periodicals in\r\nPennsylvania in 1860 was 367, of which 277 were political, 43 religious,\r\n25 literary, 22 miscellaneous; and the total number of copies circulated\r\nin 1860 was 116,094,480. (Census Tables, Nos. 15, 37.) The number in\r\nVirginia was 139, of which 117 were political, 13 religious, 3 literary,\r\n6 miscellaneous; and the number of copies circulated in 1860 was\r\n26,772,568, being much less than one fourth that of Pennsylvania. The\r\nnumber of copies of monthly periodicals circulated in Pennsylvania in\r\n1860 was 464,684; and in Virginia, 43,900; or much more than ten to one\r\nin favor of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAs regards schools, colleges, academies, libraries, and churches, I must\r\ntake the Census of 1850, those tables for 1860 not being yet arranged or\r\nprinted. The number of public schools in Pennsylvania in 1850 was 9,061;\r\nteachers, 10,024; pupils, 413,706; colleges, academies, &c., pupils,\r\n26,142; attending school during the year, as returned by families,\r\n504,610; native adults of the State who cannot read or write, 51,283;\r\npublic libraries, 393; volumes, 363,400; value of churches, $11,853,291;\r\npercentage of native free, population (adults) who cannot read or write,\r\n4.56. (Comp. Census of 1850.)\r\n\r\nThe number of public schools in Virginia in 1850 was 2,937; teachers,\r\n3,005; pupils, 67,438; colleges, academies, &c., pupils, 10,326;\r\nattending school, as returned by families, 109,775; native white adults\r\nof the State who cannot read or write, 75,868; public libraries, 54;\r\nvolumes, 88,462; value of churches, $2,902,220; percentage of native\r\nfree adults of Virginia who cannot read or write, 19.90. (Comp. Census\r\nof 1850.) Thus, the church and educational statistics of Pennsylvania,\r\nand especially of free adults who cannot read or write, is as five to\r\none nearly in favor of Pennsylvania. When we recollect that nearly one\r\nthird of the population of Pennsylvania are of the great German race,\r\nand speak the noble German language, to which they are greatly attached,\r\nand hence the difficulty of introducing common _English_ public schools\r\nin the State, the advantage, in this respect, of Pennsylvania over\r\nVirginia is most extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThese official statistics enable me, then, again to say that slavery is\r\nhostile to the progress of _wealth_ and _education_, to _science_ and\r\n_literature_, to _schools_, _colleges_, and _universities_, to _books_\r\nand _libraries_, to _churches_ and _religion_, to the PRESS, and\r\ntherefore to FREE GOVERNMENT; hostile to the _poor_, keeping them in\r\n_want_ and _ignorance_; hostile to LABOR, reducing it to _servitude_ and\r\ndecreasing _two thirds_ the value of its products; hostile to _morals_,\r\nrepudiating among slaves the _marital_ and _parental_ condition,\r\nclassifying them by law as CHATTELS, _darkening_ the _immortal soul_,\r\nand making it a _crime_ to teach millions of _human beings_ to _read_ or\r\n_write_.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, there are desperate leaders of the Peace party of Pennsylvania,\r\ndesecrating the name of _Democrats_, but, in fact, Tories and traitors,\r\nwho would separate that glorious old commonwealth from the North, and\r\nbid her sue in abject humiliation for admission as one of the Slave\r\nStates of the rebel confederacy. Shades of Penn and Franklin, and of the\r\nthousands of martyred patriots of Pennsylvania who have fallen in\r\ndefence of the Union from 1776 to 1863, forbid the terrible degradation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWN IN TENNESSEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSultry and wearisome the day had been in that Tennessee valley, and\r\nafter drill, we had laid around under the trees--tall, noble trees they\r\nwere--and the fresh grass was green and soft under them as on the old\r\n'Campus,' and we had been smoking and talking over a wide, wide range of\r\nsubjects, from deep Carlyleism--of which Carlyle doubtless never\r\nheard--to the significance of the day's orders. It was not an\r\ninharmonious picture--Camp Alabama, so we had named it--for it was with\r\na 'here we rest' feeling that a dozen days before we had marched in at\r\nnoon. The ground sloped to the eastward--a single winding road of yellow\r\nsand crept over the slope into the horizon, a mile or more away; north,\r\na hill rose with some abruptness; south and west, a grove of wonderful\r\nbeauty skirted the valley. A single building--an old but large log\r\nfarmhouse--stood near the tent, whose fluttering banner indicated\r\nheadquarters. This old house was well filled with commissary stores,\r\nand, following that incomprehensible Tennessee policy, four companies of\r\nour regiment, the twenty-third, had been detached to guard them under\r\nMajor Fanning--'a noble soldier he, but all untried.' We had never yet\r\nseen active service, and our tents were still white and unstained. The\r\nground had been once the lawn of the deserted house--in the long ago\r\nprobably the home of a planter of some pretension; and, as we lay there\r\nunder the trees watching the boys over the fires, kindled for their\r\nevening meal, the blue smoke curling up among the trees, it made, as I\r\nhave said, a most harmonious picture.\r\n\r\nThat fair June evening! I can never forget it, and I wish I were an\r\nartist that I could show you the sloping valley, the white tents,\r\nflushing like a girl's cheek to the good-night kisses of the sun, the\r\ncurling smoke wreaths, and far, far above the amethystine heaven, from\r\nwhich floated over all a dim purple tint. I was the youngest\r\ncommissioned officer in the regiment, having been promoted to a vacancy\r\na week or two before through Major Fanning's influence.\r\n\r\nWe were all invited that evening to supper with our commanding officer\r\nand his wife--who had been with him for a few days. A fresh breeze\r\nstirred the trees at sunset, and, after slight attention to our\r\ntoilette, we dropped by twos and threes into the neighborhood of the\r\nmajor's tent. A little back from the rows of other tents, a few fine\r\noaks made a temple in front, worthy even of its presiding genius, Grace\r\nFanning--but I am _not_ going to rhapsodize. She was a fair, modest,\r\nyoung thing, with the girl rose yet fresh on her wife's cheek. I had\r\nknown her from childhood; very nearly of the same age, and the children\r\nof neighbors, we had been inseparable; of course in my first college\r\nvacation, finding her grown tall and womanly, I had entertained for her\r\na devoted boyish passion, and had gone from her presence, one August\r\nnight, mad with rejection, and wild with what I called despair. But\r\n_that_ passed, and we had been good friends ever since--she the\r\nconfidential one, to whom I related my varied college love affairs,\r\nlistening ever with a tender, genial sympathy. I had no sister, and\r\nGrace Jones (I am sorry, but her name _was_ Jones) was dear to me as\r\none. Two years of professional study had kept me away from my village\r\nhome, and a few words came once in a long while, in my mother's letters\r\n'to assure me of Grace's remembrance and regard.' A little of the elder\r\nsister's advising tone amused my one and twenty years and my incipient\r\nmoustache amazingly; and I resolved, when I saw her, to convince her of\r\nmy dignity--to patronize her. But the notes that called me home were too\r\nclarion-like for a relapse into puppyism. My country spoke my name, and\r\nI arose a man, and 'put away childish things.' I came home to say\r\nfarewell. A regiment was forming there, I enlisted, and a few days\r\nbefore our departure, I stood in the village church, looking and\r\nlistening while Grace promised eternal fidelity to Harry Fanning. I was\r\na stranger to him. He had come to Danville after my departure, winning\r\nfrom all golden opinions, and from Grace a woman's priceless heart. She\r\ngave him freely to his country, and denied not her hand to his parting\r\nprayer. I had had time only to say farewell to her, and the old footing\r\nhad not been restored, but I _think_ she spoke to the major of me, for\r\nhe soon sought me, giving me genial friendship and sympathy, and\r\nprocuring for me, as I have related, my commission. I had seen her but\r\nonce since she came to Camp Alabama, and she gave me warm and kindly\r\nwelcome as I came in, the last of the group, having found in my tent\r\nsome unexpected employment. Being a soldier, I shall not shock my fair\r\nreaders if I confess that it was--buttons. Ah! me, I am frivolous. But I\r\nlinger in the spirit of that happy hour. Grace's chair was shaded by a\r\ngracefully draped flag; the major stood near her, his love for her as\r\nvisible in his eye as his cordial kindness for us. To me, in honor of my\r\n'juniority,' as Mrs. Fanning said, was assigned a place near her. The\r\nothers had choice between campstools and blankets on the grass. And the\r\noddest but most respectable of contrabands served us soon with our\r\nsupper, so homelike that we suspected 'Mrs. Major's' fair hands of\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy evening. Merry laughter at our camp stories rang silverly\r\nfrom her fair lips. Or we listened eagerly to her as she told us of the\r\nhomes we had left, and the bonny maidens there, sobered since our\r\ndeparture into patriotic industry. Stories of touching self-denial, with\r\na wholesome pathos, and sometimes from her dainty musical talk she\r\ndropped, pebble-like, a name, as 'Fanny,' 'Carry,' 'Maggie,' and\r\nresponsive blushes rippled up over sunburned, honest faces, and a soft\r\nmist brightened for a second resolute eyes. Presently the band--a part\r\nonly of the regiment's--began to play soft, well-known tunes. Through a\r\nfew marches and national airs, I looked and listened as a year before,\r\nin the village church at home. And as the 'Star-Spangled Banner' rose\r\ninspiringly, I felt the coincidence strangely, and could scarcely say\r\nwhich scene was real: the church aisle and the bridal party, in white\r\nrobes and favors, with mellow organ-tones rising in patriotic strains\r\nconcerning the 'dear old flag,' or the group under the oaks; the young\r\nwife in her gray travelling dress, and the uniformed figures gathered\r\naround her; the moon-rise over the hill, lighting softly the drooping\r\nflag, the major's dark hair, and Mrs. Fanning's sunny braids, the wild\r\nnotes of the same beloved melody overswelling all. But voices near\r\naroused me, and we joined in the chorus, and in the following tune,\r\n'Sweet Home,' the usual finale of our evening programme. Then, as the\r\ntones died, Grace lifted her voice and sang with sweet, pure soprano\r\ntones, an old-time ballad of love and parting and reunion.\r\n\r\nWe had a wild little battle song in 'Our Mess,' written by Charlie\r\nMarsh, our fair-haired boy-poet soldier, speaking of home, and the\r\ncountry's need, and victory, and possible deaths in ringing notes. We\r\nsang it there in the light of the slowly rising moon. The chorus was\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n  'Our country's foe before us,\r\n  Our country's banner o'er us,\r\n  Our country to deplore us,\r\n    These are a soldier's needs.'\r\n\r\nAs we closed, Grace caught the strain, and with soft, birdlike notes\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n  'Your country's flag above you,\r\n  Your country's true hearts love you--\r\n  So let your country move you\r\n    To brave, undying deeds.'\r\n\r\nMore songs followed, and happy words of cheer in distress, of\r\nself-consecration, of past and future victory; but Major Fanning was\r\nunusually silent. Hardly sad, for he flung into our conversation\r\noccasional cheerful words; but gravely quiet, his dark eye following\r\nevery motion of his fair young wife. Finally we called on Captain\r\nCarter, our 'oldest man,' a grave bachelor of forty-five, and to our\r\nsurprise, who knew him harsh and sometimes profane, he sang, with a\r\nvoice not faultless, but soft and expressive, that exquisite health of\r\nCampbell's:\r\n\r\n  'Drink ye to her that each loves best,\r\n    And if you nurse a flame\r\n  That's told but to her mutual breast,\r\n    We will not ask her name.\r\n\r\n  'And far, far hence be jest or boast,\r\n    From hallowed thoughts so dear;\r\n  But drink to her that each loves most,\r\n    As she would love to hear.'\r\n\r\nThen silence for a little space; and the moonlight full and fair in\r\nsoldiers' faces, young and old, but all firm and true, and fair and full\r\non Grace Fanning's fresh, young brow. Then 'good-nights,' mingled with\r\nexpressions of enjoyment, and plans for the morrow. I left them last.\r\n\r\n'I am glad you are here, Robert,' said the major; 'Grace would not be\r\nall alone, even if I'--\r\n\r\nHer white hand flashed to his lips, where a kiss met it, and laughingly\r\nwe parted. A few rods away, I paused and turned. They stood there under\r\nthe flag. Her bright head on his bosom, his arms about her, and the\r\nsilver moonlight over all. Fair Grace Fanning! Have I named my story\r\nwrongly, pretty reader? I called it 'Camp Sketch,' and it reads too like\r\na love story. 'Ah! gentle girl, seeking adventure in fiction, but\r\nshrinking really from even a cut finger, there is enough of battle even\r\nin my little story, though you slept peacefully and happily that fair\r\nJune night, or waltzed yourself weary to the sound of the sea at the\r\n'Ocean House.'\r\n\r\nA few 'good nights' commendatory of our hostess and our evening greeted\r\nme as I sought my tent and made ready for sleep. I was very happy, no\r\nmemory of our talk was sullied by coarse or unlovely thought; pure as\r\nherself had been our enjoyment of Mrs. Fanning's society, and I slept\r\nsweetly.\r\n\r\nThe long roll! None but those who have heard it when it means instant\r\ndanger and possible death, can conceive the thrill with which I sprang\r\nfrom deep slumber, and made hasty preparation for action. Quick as I\r\nwas, others had been before me, and I found the half-dressed men drawn\r\nup in battle line before the encampment. I took my place.\r\n\r\nBehind us lay the camp, a wide, street-like space, fringed with a double\r\nrow of tents--at its foot the old log mansion; near that, a little in\r\nfront, but at one side, the flag of headquarters--this behind. Before us\r\nthe major--the western wood, and the flashing sabres of a band of\r\nhostile cavalry. They came on heedless of the fast-emptying saddles, on,\r\n_on_, and more following from the wood, the moon in the mid heaven,\r\nclear like day.\r\n\r\nA gallant charge--a firm repulse. Major Fanning's clear voice on the\r\nnight air, rallying the men to attack the furious foe. They sweep their\r\nhorses around to left, but calmly the major wheels his battalion, still\r\nunflanked; again those fierce steeds try the first point of attack;\r\nagain we front them undaunted. In our turn, with lifted level bayonets\r\nwe charge; the enemy falls back--a shout threads along our lines,\r\nchanging suddenly into a wail, for, calling us on, our leader falls.\r\nPitiless to his noble valor, a well-aimed carbine-shot lays him low.\r\nThey lift him, some brave soldiers near; and, his young face bathed in\r\nblood, they bear him to his waiting bride; he opens his eyes, as he\r\npasses.\r\n\r\n'Courage! victory! my boys!' he calls; then, seeing me: 'Go! tell her,\r\nRobert.'\r\n\r\nI call my orderly to my place, and before they have pierced our lines\r\nwith their beloved burden, I am at the tent door. She stands there\r\nwaiting, a little pistol in her hand--a light wrapper about her, and her\r\nfair hair streaming over her shoulders. I look at her mutely; she knows\r\nthere is something terrible for her, and while I seek words, her eye\r\ngoes on, resting where down the moonlit trees they are bringing him. A\r\nmoment, she is by his side, and tearless and white, her hand on his\r\nunanswering heart, she moves beside him. The soldiers lay their leader\r\non the ground under his flag, and her imperious gesture sends them back\r\nto their places in the battle. And then she, sinking beside him, cries\r\nout:\r\n\r\n'Oh, Robert! will he never speak to me again? Help him!'\r\n\r\nMy two years at lectures had not been passed in vain, and surgery had\r\nbeen my hobby. I knelt and strove to aid him. It was a cruel wound. I\r\nasked for bandages. She tore them from her garments wildly. I stilled\r\nthe trickling crimson stream, and going into the tent, found some\r\nrestoratives. I poured the wine down his throat, and, soon opening his\r\neyes, he spoke:\r\n\r\n'Grace!'\r\n\r\nI stepped away--near enough for call, not near enough for intrusion.\r\nLooking at the lines of dark forms topped by the light glimmer of stray\r\nbayonets, I saw with dismay that our men were retreating before those\r\nheavy charges; in thick, dense masses they moved back, nearing us. I\r\nthought of our soldier chief, crushed under those wild hoofs; I thought\r\nof Grace, unprotected in her youth and widowed, desolate beauty, and\r\nsprang to her side, ready with my life for her.\r\n\r\nThe major saw it all, and, faint as he was, rose on his elbow, watching.\r\nCharge after charge, wild and impetuous, break the slowly retreating\r\nbattalions. In vain I heard Carter's stern oaths (may the angel of tears\r\nforgive him!), and Charlie Marsh's boyish calls. The men are facing us.\r\nThe enemy, cheering, and in the background huge torches flaming with\r\npitch, are ready for incendiarism.\r\n\r\n'Grace! Grace! I _must_ rally them, let me go!' and I see Major Fanning\r\nstraggling in her arms. I clasp him also.\r\n\r\n'It is certain death,' I say to her, mad with fright and misery.\r\n\r\n'And this is worse, worse, Grace; you might better kill me!' his voice\r\nwas harsh--cruel even.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she was gone, and I held him alone; catching his sword, she\r\nsprang like a flash of lightning into the open space before the log\r\nhouse, and, lifting the bare blade with naked, slender arm, its loose\r\nsleeve floating from her shoulder like a wing, she faced those\r\npanic-stricken men.\r\n\r\n'For shame!' she cried; but her weak voice was lost; then, stern as the\r\nangel of death, she stepped forward.\r\n\r\n'The first man that passes me shall die!' and she swung the flashing\r\nblade up, ready to fall. A moment's halt, and then, she spoke to them\r\nwith wonderful strange words. I cannot recall them; with inspired\r\neloquence she spoke, a slight, white-robed figure in the clear\r\nmoonlight, and the rout was stayed, and they turned bravely to meet the\r\nfoe. Then she came faint and weak to her husband's side again. He looked\r\nup with glad, eager eyes.\r\n\r\n'Darling!'\r\n\r\nInfinite love, soul-recognition, shone on both faces, and then blank\r\nunconsciousness crept over his. Firmly our boys met the charging steeds\r\nnow. That moment had restored to them their courage. Emptied saddles\r\nwere frequent, but still fresh forces dashed from the wood. Is there no\r\nhope for us? Must we be overpowered? Is all this valor vain? Grace from\r\nher husband's side looks mutely up to heaven. I find my place among the\r\nmen. Little hope remains. Some one calls 'retreat.' 'Just once more,'\r\ncries Charlie, and falls before us. But listen; above the battle din\r\ncomes a new, an approaching sound from the eastward.\r\n\r\nAlong the yellow road pours swiftly a force of cavalry, behind the\r\nrumble of cannon almost flying over the ground, and high in air, reeling\r\nfrom the swift motion of its bearer's steed, the banner of the free. We\r\nare saved! A wild shout rings along our lines. Among the enemy,\r\nfrightened consultation followed by flight; another second, and our\r\nfriends are with us and beyond us in hot pursuit.\r\n\r\nBrief question and answer told us of the friendly warning in the distant\r\ncamp, the hasty march to aid us. The rest we saw. Then, 'A surgeon for\r\nMajor Fanning.' The man of the green sash had not grown callous. There\r\nwere tears in his eyes as he rose from his vain endeavors, saying only:\r\n\r\n'I can do nothing here; I am needed elsewhere.'\r\n\r\nOur young hero was dead!\r\n\r\nThey composed his limbs, laying him on a blanket under the trees, and\r\nGrace sat down beside him, tearless still, but pale as her dress, or the\r\nwhite hand lying cold over the soldier's pulseless heart.\r\n\r\n'Robert, send them away,' she said to me, as sympathizing strangers\r\npressed round; and they left us alone with the dead. I spoke at last the\r\ncommonplaces of consolation, suggested and modified by the hour and my\r\nsoldier feelings.\r\n\r\n'Yes, Robert,' she answered, 'I gave him long ago. GOD will comfort me\r\nfor my hero--in time. Do not speak to me just yet. Do not let any one\r\ncome.'\r\n\r\nThe tears came now, and she wept bitterly, silently, under the starry\r\nbanner, beside the dead. I heard the hum of many voices, and now and\r\nthen a cry of pain, and knew they were all helping the sufferers. Then I\r\nturned to her again. Her streaming hair swept the ground, golden in the\r\nlight. Her fair face was hidden on the cold dead face. And I dared not\r\nspeak to her. Oh, that picture! Poor Grace Fanning! and the silver,\r\nsilver moonlight over all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOETRY AND POETICAL SELECTIONS.\r\n\r\n  'Oh, deem not in this world of strife,\r\n    An idle art the Poet brings;\r\n      Let high Philosophy control,\r\n  And sages calm the stream of life;\r\n    'Tis he refines its fountain springs,\r\n      The nobler passions of the soul.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the annals of literature, Poetry antedates Prose. Creation precedes\r\nProvidence, not merely in the order of sequence, but what is usually\r\ncalled intellectual and physical grandeur. So in genius and taste,\r\nPoetry transcends prose. In the work of Creation the Almighty broke the\r\nawful stillness of Eternity, by His first creative fiat, and angels were\r\nthe first-born of God. They took their thrones in the galleries of the\r\nuniverse, and in silent contemplation sat. They spoke not; for words, as\r\nsigns of thought or will or emotion, were not then conceived, and,\r\nconsequently, then unborn. They gazed in rapture on one another, and in\r\nsolemn silence thought. Their emotions bodied forth the Anthem of\r\nCreation.\r\n\r\nHuman words being created breath, and breath being air in motion, prior\r\nto these language was impossible. And as the deaf are always dumb,\r\nlanguage, like faith, comes by hearing. But hearing itself is a\r\npensioner, waiting upon a speaker; consequently, it must ever be\r\ncontingent on a cause alike antecedent and extrinsic of itself. It is,\r\ntherefore, equally an oracle of reason and of faith that, however God\r\nmay have communicated to angels, to _man_ He spoke in articulate sounds,\r\nbefore man articulated a thought, a feeling, or an emotion of his soul.\r\nAnd as an emotional soul is but a harp of many strings, a hand there\r\nmust have been to play upon its chords, before melody and harmony,\r\ntwins-born of Heaven, had either a local habitation or a name.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be asked--Is there not in the regions of Poetry an æolian\r\nharp, found in the cave of Æolus, on which the winds of heaven played\r\nmany a celestial symphony, without the skill or touch of human hand?\r\nGrant all that the Poetic Muse assumes, and then we ask--Who made the\r\nharp? And whence directed came the musing sylvan Zephyrus and his choir?\r\nCame they not from a land of images and dreams?\r\n\r\nBut we are inquiring for originals. Images and originals are the poles\r\napart. An original without an image is possible; but an image without an\r\noriginal is alike impossible and inconceivable. Hence, alike\r\nphilosophically and logically, we conclude that _neither man nor angel\r\naddressed each other until they themselves had been addressed by their\r\nCreator_. Then they intercommunicated thought, sentiment, and emotion\r\nwith one another as God had communicated to them.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of language and Poetry is insoluble but on the admission of\r\na revelation or communication of some sort, unconceived by the human\r\nmind, unexecuted by the human hand. If invention and creation be the\r\ngrand characteristics of the Poet, Moses, if uninspired, was a greater\r\nPoet than Homer, or Milton, or Shakspeare, on the hypothesis that he\r\ninvented the drama which he wrote. The first chapter of Genesis is the\r\ngreatest and most splendid Poem ever conceived by human imagination, or\r\nwritten by human hand.\r\n\r\nAll Poets, ancient and modern, are mere plagiarists, if Moses was\r\nuninspired. We prove his Divine Legation by the intrinsic and\r\ntranscendent merits of the Poem which he wrote. Imagination originates\r\nnothing absolutely new. It merely imitates and combines. It is regarded\r\nas the creative faculty of man; but its material is already furnished.\r\nThe portrait of an unreal Adam is as conceivable as a child without a\r\nfather, or an effect without a cause.\r\n\r\nThus we are obliged, by an inseparable necessity, to admit the\r\ncredibility of the Poem which he wrote. And what does Moses say? Nothing\r\nmore than that _God spoke, and the universe was!_ This is the sublime of\r\ntrue Poetry. This is more than the logic of the proposition, _God was,\r\ntherefore we are!_ It is more than the philosophy, _ex nihilo, nihil\r\nfit!_ or than, that _nothing_ cannot be the parent of _something_.\r\n\r\nBut we must place our foot on a higher round of the ladder, before we\r\ncan stand on such an eminence as to see, in all its fair proportions,\r\nthe column on which the Muses perch themselves.\r\n\r\nJob, and not Moses, shall be our guide, and the oracle alike of our\r\nreason and our imagination. But who is Job? There is not much poetry in\r\nthe name, Job. But Rome and its vulgate vulgarized this hallowed name,\r\nand Britain followed Rome. His name in Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic, is\r\nJobab. There is more poetry in this. There is no metre, no poetry in a\r\nmonotone or monosyllable. Born among rocks and mountains, the proper\r\ntheatre of a heaven-inspired Muse--not in Arabia the Happy, but in\r\nArabia the Rocky--he was a heart-touching, a soul-stirring, emotional\r\nBard. In such a case the clouds that overshadow the era of the man only\r\nenhance the genius and inspiration of the Poet.\r\n\r\nIn internal and external evidence, according to our calendar of the\r\nMuses, he is the first-born of the Poets that yet survive the wasteful\r\nravages of hoary Time. He sings not, indeed, of Chaos and Eternal Night.\r\nBut as one inspired by a heaven-born Muse, he echoes the chorus of the\r\nAngelic Song, when on the utterance of the first _fiat_ the Morning\r\nStars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy. Hence we\r\nargue, that Poetry is not only prior to prose, but that language, its\r\nintellectual and emotional embodiment, is heaven-conceived, and\r\nheaven-born.\r\n\r\nBut in a short essay it would be out of place and in bad taste to\r\nattempt a discourse upon the broad field of ancient or modern Poetry. We\r\nmerely attempt to suggest one idea on this rich and lofty theme. Our\r\nradical conception of the essential and differential attribute of\r\nPoetry, as contradistinguished from prose, however chaste, pure,\r\nbeautiful, and philosophic, is not mere art, nor science, but\r\n_creation_.\r\n\r\nThe universe itself is a grand Heroic Poem. Hence its instrument is that\r\npower usually called Imagination. But _human_ imagination is not first,\r\nsecond, or third in rank on the scale of the universe. God Himself\r\nimagined the universe before He created it. His imagination is infinite.\r\nThe Cherubim and Seraphim have wings that elevate them above our zenith.\r\nAnd angels, too, excel us in this creative faculty, and therefore veil\r\ntheir faces before the Majesty of heaven and earth. Still, man has an\r\nhumble portion of it, and can turn it to a good account.\r\n\r\nBut there is another idea essential to the character of Poetry, as good\r\nor evil in its spirit and adornings. We need scarcely say, for we are\r\nanticipated by every reflecting mind, that this is the _spirit_ of the\r\nPoem. Poetry, in the abstract, is not necessarily good or evil. It may\r\nbe Christian, Jewish, Pagan, or Infidel in its spirit and tendencies. It\r\nmay corrupt or purify the heart. It may save or ruin the reader in\r\nfortune or in fame. Hence, as Poetry is powerful to elevate or degrade,\r\nto purify or to corrupt a people, much depends on the spirit of the\r\nPoetry which they may put into the hands of the youth of a country; as\r\nwell observed by an eminent moralist: 'Let me write the poems or\r\nballads of a people, and I care but little who enacts their laws.'\r\n\r\nThe genius of a Poet is a rare genius. And most happily it is so; for\r\nelevated taste and high-toned morality are not, by any means, the common\r\nheritage of man. Anacreon and Burns were genuine Poets. They uttered, in\r\nfine style, many truths; and were not merely fluent in their respective\r\nlanguages, but affluent. But, perhaps, like some other men of mighty\r\nparts and grand proportions, better for mankind they had never been\r\nborn. A Cowper and a Byron, in their whole career of song, will exert a\r\nvery different influence, not only on earth, but in eternity, on the\r\ndestiny of their amateurs. We need not argue this position as though,\r\namong a Christian people, it were a doubtful or debatable position. If\r\nthe evil spirit, or the melancholy demon, that fitfully possessed the\r\nfirst king of Israel, was expelled by the skilful hand of his successor,\r\neven when his youthful fingers awoke the melodies of the lyre, how much\r\nmore puissant the exquisite Odes of the sweet Psalmist, inspired as they\r\nwere with sentiments and views alike honorable to God and man, to\r\nelevate the conceptions, purify the heart, ennoble the aspirations, and\r\nadorn the life of man!\r\n\r\nAs the cask long retains the odor of the wine put into it, so the moral\r\nand religious fragrance of many a fine poetic effusion, securely lodged\r\nin the recesses of memory, may yield, and often does yield, a rich\r\nrepast of pleasurable associations and emotions which, beside their\r\nopportune recurrence in some trying or tempting hour or season of\r\nadversity, do often energize our souls with a moral heroism to deeds of\r\nnobler daring, which result in enterprises full of blessings to\r\nourselves, and not unfrequently to our associates in the walks of life,\r\nand radiate through them salutary light for generations to come.\r\n\r\nImagination, like every other faculty, is to be cultivated. But here we\r\nare interrogated--'What is Imagination?'\r\n\r\nNo distinction has given critics more trouble, in the way of definition,\r\nthan that between Imagination and Fancy. Fancy, it is held, is given to\r\nbeguile and quicken the temporal part of our nature; Imagination to\r\nincite and support the eternal.\r\n\r\nIt would be vain to enumerate the various definitions of this term, or\r\nto attempt to give even an abstract of the diversity of views\r\nentertained by philosophers respecting the nature and extent of its\r\noperations. It is regarded by some writers as that power or faculty of\r\nthe mind by which it conceives and forms ideas of things communicated to\r\nit by the organs of sense. So defines our encyclopædias. Bacon defined\r\nit to be the 'representation of an individual thought.' But Dugald\r\nStewart more philosophically defines it as the 'power of modifying our\r\nconceptions, by combining the parts of different ones so as to form new\r\nwholes of our own creation.' The Edinburgh Encyclopædia, not satisfied\r\nwith this, says Webster defines it to be the _will working on the\r\nmaterials of memory, selecting parts of different conceptions, or\r\nobjects of memory, to form some new whole_.\r\n\r\nThis has long been our cherished view of Imagination. It creates only as\r\na mechanic creates a chest of drawers, a sideboard, a clock, or a watch.\r\nIt originates not a single material of thought, volition, or action.\r\nBut, mechanic-like, it works by plumb and rule on all the materials\r\nfound in the warehouse of memory; and manufactures, out of the same\r\nplank of pine, or bar of iron, or wedge of gold, or precious stone, some\r\nnew utensil, ornament, or adornment never found in Nature. In its\r\npresent form it is the offspring of the art and contrivance of man.\r\nHence our invulnerable position against Atheism or Deism. _No one could\r\nhave created the idea of a God or of a Christ, without a special\r\ninspiration, any more than he could create a gold watch without the\r\nmetal called gold._\r\n\r\nThe deaf are necessarily dumb. The blind cannot conceive of color. A\r\nPoet cannot work without language, any more than the nightingale could\r\nsing without air. Language and prototypes precede and necessarily\r\nantedate writing and prose. Hence the idea of Poetry is preceded by the\r\nidea of Prose, as speaking by the idea of hearing. There was reason, and\r\nan age of reason, without, and antecedent to, rhyme; and therefore we\r\nsometimes find rhyme without reason, as well as reason without rhyme.\r\n\r\nRhyme, however, facilitates memory and recollection. Memory, indeed, is\r\nbut a printed tablet, and recollection the art and mystery of reading\r\nit. Poetry, therefore, is both useful and pleasing. It aids\r\nrecollection, and soothes and excites and animates the soul of man. It\r\nmakes deeper, more pungent, more stimulating, more exciting, and more\r\nenduring impressions on the mind than prose; and, therefore, greatly\r\nfacilitates both the acquisition and retention of ideas and impressions.\r\nOf it Horace says ('Ars Poetica'):\r\n\r\n  'Ut pictura, poesis; erit, quæ, si propius stes,\r\n  Te capiet magis, et quædam, si longius abstes.\r\n  Hæc amat obscurum; volet hæc sub luce videri,\r\n  Judicis argutum quæ non formidat acumen:\r\n  Hæc placuit semel, hæc decies repetita placebit.'\r\n\r\nNo one ever attained to what is usually called _good taste_ who has not\r\ndevoted a portion of his time and study to the whole science and art of\r\nPoetry. We do not mean good taste in relation to any one manifestation\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThere is a general as well as a special good taste, but they are\r\ndistinguishable only as genus and species. There is, it may be alleged,\r\na _native_ as well as an _acquired_ taste. This may also be conceded.\r\nThere is in some persons a greater innate susceptibility of deriving\r\npleasure from the works of Nature and of Art than is discoverable in\r\nothers. Still we cannot imagine any one gifted with reason and\r\nsensibility to be entirely destitute of it. It is an element of reason\r\nand of sense peculiar to man. As a fabulist once represented a cock in\r\nquest of barleycorns, scraping for his breakfast, saying to himself, on\r\ndiscovering a precious and brilliant gem: 'If a lapidary were in my\r\nplace he would now have made his fortune; but as for myself, I prefer\r\none grain of barley to all the precious stones in the world.'\r\n\r\nBut what man, so feeling and thinking, would not 'blush and hang his\r\nhead to think himself a man'? Apart from the value of the gem, every man\r\nof reason or of thought has pleasure in the contemplation of the\r\nbeautiful diamond, whether on his own person or on that of another.\r\nTaste seems to be as inseparable from reason as Poetry is from\r\nimagination. It is not wholly the gift of Nature, nor wholly the gift of\r\nArt. It is an innate element of the human constitution, designed to\r\nbeautify and beatify man. To cultivate and improve it is an essential\r\npart of education. The highest civilization known in Christendom is but\r\nthe result or product of good taste. Even religion and morality, in\r\ntheir highest excellence, are but, so far as society is concerned,\r\ndevelopments and demonstrations of cultivated taste. There may, indeed,\r\nbe a fictitious or chimerical taste without Poetry or Religion; but a\r\ngenuine good taste, in our judgment, without these handmaids, is\r\nunattainable.\r\n\r\nBut as no interesting landscape--no mountain, hill, or valley, no river,\r\nlake or sea--affords us all that charms, excites or elevates our\r\nimagination viewed from any one point of vision, so the poetic faculty\r\nitself can neither be conceived of nor appreciated, contemplated out of\r\nits own family register.\r\n\r\nThere is in all the 'Fine Arts' a common paternity, and hence a family\r\nlineage and a family likeness. To appreciate any one of them we must\r\nform an acquaintance with the whole sisterhood--Poetry, Music, Painting,\r\nand Sculpture.\r\n\r\nAnd are not all these the genuine offspring of Imagination? Hence they\r\nare of one paternity, though not of one maternity. The eye, the ear, and\r\nthe hand, has each its own peculiar sympathetic nerve. For, as all God's\r\nworks are perfect, when and where He gives an eye to see or an ear to\r\nhear, He gives a hand to execute. This is the law; and as all God's laws\r\nare universal as perfect, there is no exception save from accident, or\r\nfrom something poetically styled a _lusus naturæ_--a mere caprice or\r\nsport of Nature.\r\n\r\nBut the philosophy of Poetry is not necessary to its existence any more\r\nthan the astronomy of the heavens is to the brilliancy of the sun or to\r\nthe splendors of a comet. A Poet is a creator, and his most perfect\r\ncreature is a portraiture of any work of God or man; of any attribute of\r\nGod or man in perfect keeping with Nature or with the original\r\nprototype, be it in fact or in fiction, in repose or in operation.\r\n\r\nImitation is sometimes regarded as the test of poetic excellence. But\r\nwhat is imitation but the creation of an image! Alexander Pope so well\r\nimitates Homer, that, as an English critic once said, in speaking of his\r\ntranslation of that Prince of Grecian Poets--'a time might come, should\r\nthe annals of Greece and England be confounded in some convulsion of\r\nNature, when it might be a grave question of debate whether Pope\r\ntranslated Homer, or Homer Pope.'\r\n\r\nFor our own part, we have never been able to decide to our own entire\r\nsatisfaction, which excels in the true Heroic style. Pope, in his\r\ntranslation of the exordium of Homer, we think more than equals Homer\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n  'Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring\r\n  Of woes unnumbered, heavenly goddess, sing!\r\n  That wrath which hurled to Pluto's dark domain\r\n  The souls of mighty chiefs in battle slain;\r\n  Whose limbs, unburied on the fatal shore,\r\n  Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore;\r\n  Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,\r\n  Such was the sovereign doom and such the will of Jove.'[18]\r\n\r\nWe opine that Pope, being trammelled with a copy, and consequently his\r\nimagination cramped, displays every attribute of poetic genius fully\r\nequal, if not superior, to that of the beau ideal of the Grecian Muse.\r\n\r\nBut Alexander Pope, of England, is not the Pope of English Poetry, a\r\nbrother Poet being judge, for Dryden says:\r\n\r\n  'Three Poets, in three distant ages born,\r\n  Greece, Italy, and England did adorn;\r\n  The first in majesty of thought surpassed,\r\n  The next in melody--in both the last:\r\n  The force of Nature could no further go,\r\n  To make the third she joined the other two.'\r\n\r\nAnd who awards not to Milton the richest medal in the Temple of the\r\nMuses! Not, perhaps, for the elegant diction and sublime imagery of his\r\nPARADISE LOST, but for his grand conceptions of Divinity in all its\r\nattributes, and of humanity in all its conditions, past, present, and\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nWe Americans have a peculiar respect for Lyric Poetry. We have not time\r\nfor the Epic. If anything with us is good, it is superlatively good for\r\nbeing brief. Short sermons, short prayers, short hymns, and short metre\r\nare peculiarly interesting. We are, too, a miscellaneous people, and we\r\nare peculiarly fond of miscellanies. The age of folios and quartos is\r\nforever past with Young America. Octavos are waning, and more in need of\r\nbrushing than of burnishing. But still we must have Poetry--_good_\r\nPoetry; for we Americans prefer to live rather in the style of good\r\nlyric than in that of grave, elongated hexameter. Variety, too, is with\r\nus the spice of life. We are not satisfied with grand prairies, rivers,\r\nand cataracts, and even cascades and _jet d'eaus_!\r\n\r\nCollections of miscellaneous Poetry seem alike due to the Poetic Muse\r\nand to the American people. We love variety. It is, as we have remarked,\r\nthe spice of American life; and our country will ever cherish it as\r\nbeing most in harmony with itself. It is, moreover, more in unison with\r\nthe conditions of human nature and human existence. There is, too, as\r\nthe wisest of men and the greatest of kings has said, 'a time for every\r\npurpose and for every work.' No volume of Poetry or of Prose can,\r\ntherefore, be popular or interesting to such a nation as we are, that\r\ndoes not adapt itself to the versatile genius of our people, and to the\r\never-varying conditions of their lives and fortunes.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, a propriety in getting up good selections, because\r\na greater advantage is to be derived from well selected specimens of the\r\nPoetic Muse than from the labors of any one of the great masters of the\r\nLyre! Who would not rather visit a rich and extensive museum of the\r\nproducts and arts of civilized life--some well assorted repository of\r\nits scientific or artistic developments, than to traverse a whole state\r\nor kingdom in pursuit of such knowledge of the wisdom, talents, and\r\ncontrivances of its population?\r\n\r\nOf all kinds of composition, Poetry is that which gives to the lovers of\r\nit the greatest and most enduring pleasure. Almost every one of them can\r\nheartily respond to the beautiful words of one who was not only a great\r\nPoet, but a profound philosopher--Coleridge--who, speaking of the\r\ndelight he had experienced in writing his Poems, says: 'Poetry has been\r\nto me its own exceeding great reward. It has soothed my afflictions; it\r\nhas multiplied and refined my enjoyments; it has endeared solitude; and\r\nit has given me the habit of wishing to discover the Good and the\r\nBeautiful in all that meets and surrounds me.'\r\n\r\nIn no way can the imagination be more effectually or safely exercised\r\nand improved than by the constant perusal and study of our best Poets.\r\nPoetry appeals to the universal sympathies of mankind. With the\r\ncontemplative writers, we can indulge our pensive and thoughtful tastes.\r\nWith the describers of natural scenery, we can delight in the beauties\r\nand glories of the external universe. With the great dramatists, we are\r\nable to study all the phases of the human mind, and to take their\r\nfictitious personages as models or beacons for ourselves. With the great\r\ncreative Poets, we can go outside of all these, and find ourselves in a\r\nregion of pure Imagination, which may be as true to our higher\r\ninstincts--perhaps more so--than the shows which surround us.\r\n\r\nIf it be as truthfully as it has been happily expressed by the prince of\r\ndramatic Poets, that\r\n\r\n  'He who has no music in his soul\r\n  Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils,'\r\n\r\nit should be a paramount duty with every one who loves his species, and\r\ncultivates a generous philanthropy, to patronize every effort to diffuse\r\nwidely through society, Poetry of genuine character, and to cultivate a\r\ntaste for it as an element of a literary, religious, and moral\r\neducation. We commend, as a standard of appreciation of the true\r\ncharacter of the gifts of the Poetic Muse, the following critique from\r\nSheffield, Duke of Buckingham:\r\n\r\n  ''Tis not a flash of fancy, which sometimes,\r\n  Dazzling our minds, sets off the slightest rhymes,\r\n  Bright as a blaze, but in a moment done;\r\n  True wit is everlasting, like the sun,\r\n  Which, though sometimes behind a cloud retired,\r\n  Breaks out again, and is by all admired.\r\n  Number and rhyme, and that harmonious sound\r\n  Which not the nicest ear with harshness wound,\r\n  Are necessary, yet but vulgar arts;\r\n  And all in rain these superficial parts\r\n  Contribute to the structure of the whole,\r\n  Without a genius too--for that's the soul;\r\n  A spirit which inspires the work throughout,\r\n  As that of Nature moves the world about;\r\n  A flame that glows amidst conceptions fit;\r\n  E'en something of divine, and more than wit;\r\n  Itself unseen, yet all things by it shown,\r\n  Describing all men, but described by none.'\r\n\r\nWe neither intend nor desire to institute any invidious comparisons\r\nbetween Old Britain and Young America. We are one people--one in blood,\r\none literature, one faith, one religion, in fact or in profession. Our\r\nlanguage girdles the whole earth. Our science and our religion more or\r\nless enlighten every land, as our sails whiten every sea, and our\r\ncommerce, in some degree, enriches every people. There is a magnanimity,\r\na benevolence, a philanthropy, in English Poetry, whether the Muse be\r\nEnglish, Scotch, Irish, or American, that thrills the social nerve and\r\nwarms the kindred hearts of all who think, or speak, or dream in our\r\nvernacular. The pen of the gifted Bard is more puissant than the\r\ncannon's thundering roar or the warrior's glittering sword; and the\r\nsoft, sweet melodies of English Poetry, gushing from a Christian Muse,\r\nare Heaven's sovereign specifics for a wounded spirit and an aching\r\nheart!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18:\r\n\r\n  [Greek: Mênin aeide, thea, Pêlêiadeô, Achilêos,\r\n  Oulomenên, hê myri' Achaiois alge' ethêken,\r\n  Pollas d' iphthimous psychas Aidi proiapsen\r\n  Hêrôôn, autous de helôria teuche kynessin\r\n\r\n  K.T.L.]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRIA SPES ULTIMA MUNDI.\r\n\r\nFLAG OF OUR UNION.\r\n\r\nNational Song.\r\n\r\nBY HON. ROBERT J. WALKER\r\n\r\n_Dedicated to the Union Army and Navy._\r\n\r\n\r\n  The day our nation's life began,\r\n  Dawned on the sovereignty of man,\r\n  His charter then our Fathers signed,\r\n  Proclaiming Freedom for mankind.\r\n  May Heaven still guard her glorious sway,\r\n  Till time with endless years grows gray.\r\n\r\n        Flag of our Union! float unfurled,\r\n        Thy stars shall light a ransomed world.\r\n\r\n  Americans, your mighty name,\r\n  With glory floods the peaks of fame;\r\n  Ye whom our Washington has led,\r\n  Men who with Warren nobly bled,\r\n  Who never quailed on land or sea,\r\n  Your watchword, _Death or Liberty_!\r\n\r\n        Flag of our Union! float unfurled,\r\n        Thy stars shall light a ransomed world.\r\n\r\n  It was the Union made us free,\r\n  Its loss, man's second fall would be.\r\n  States linked in kindred glory save,\r\n  Till the last despot finds a grave;\r\n  And angels hasten here to see\r\n  Man break his chains, the whole earth free!\r\n\r\n        Flag of our Union! float unfurled,\r\n        Thy stars shall light a ransomed world.\r\n\r\n  Ye struggling brothers o'er the sea,\r\n  Who spurn the chain of tyranny,\r\n  Like brave Columbus westward steer,\r\n  Our stars of hope will guide you here,\r\n  Where States still rising bless our land,\r\n  And freedom strengthens labor's hand.\r\n\r\n        Flag of our Union! float unfurled,\r\n        Thy stars shall light a ransomed world.\r\n\r\n  Ye toiling millions, free and brave,\r\n  Whose shores two mighty oceans lave:\r\n  Your cultured fields, your marts of trade,\r\n  Keels by the hand of genius laid,\r\n  The shuttle's hum, the anvil's ring\r\n  Echo your voice that God is King.\r\n\r\n        Flag of our Union! float unfurled,\r\n        Thy stars shall light a ransomed world.\r\n\r\n  Hail! Union Army, true and brave,\r\n  And dauntless Navy on the wave.\r\n  Holy the cause where Freedom leads,\r\n  Sacred the field where patriot bleeds;\r\n  Victory shall crown your spotless fame,\r\n  Nations and ages bless your name.\r\n\r\n        Flag of our Union! float unfurled,\r\n        Thy stars shall light a ransomed world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FANCY SKETCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a banker, and I need hardly say I am in comfortable circumstances.\r\nSome of my friends, of whom I have a good many, are pleased to call me\r\nrich, and I shall not take it upon myself to dispute their word. Until I\r\nwas twenty-five, I travelled, waltzed, and saw the best foreign society;\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty I devoted myself to literature and the art of\r\ndining; I am now entered upon the serious business of life, which\r\nconsists in increasing one's estate. At forty I shall marry, and as this\r\nepoch is nine years distant, I trust none of the fair readers of this\r\njournal will trouble themselves to address me notes which I really\r\ncannot answer, and which it would give me pain to throw in the fire.\r\n\r\nSome persons think it beneath a gentleman to write for the magazines or\r\npapers. This is a low and vulgar idea. The great wits of the world have\r\nfound their best friends in the journals; there were some who never\r\nlearned to write,--who ever hears of them now? I write anonymously of\r\ncourse, and I amuse myself by listening to the remarks that society\r\nmakes upon my productions. Society talks about them a great deal, and I\r\ndivide attention with the last novelist, whether an unknown young lady\r\nof the South, or a drumhead writer of romances. People say, 'That was a\r\nbrilliant article of so and so's in the last ----, wasn't it?' You will\r\noften hear this remark. I am that gentleman--I wrote that article--it\r\nwas brilliant, and, though I say it, I am capable of producing others\r\nfully equal to it.\r\n\r\nMany persons imagine that business disqualifies from the exercise of the\r\nimagination. This is a mistake. Alexander was a business man of the\r\nhighest order; so was Cæsar; so was Bonaparte; so was Burr; so am I. To\r\nbe sure, none of these distinguished characters wrote poetry; but I take\r\nit, poetry is a low species of writing, quite inferior to prose, and\r\nunworthy one's attention. Look at the splendid qualities of these great\r\nmen, particularly in the line in which the imaginative faculties tend.\r\nSee how they fascinated the ladies, who it is well known adore a fine\r\nimagination. How well they talked love, the noblest of all subjects--for\r\na man's idle hours. Then observe the schemes they projected. Conquests,\r\nconsolidations, empires, dominion, and to include my own project, a\r\nbullion bank with a ten-acre vault. It appears that a lack of capital\r\nwas at the bottom of all their plans. Alexander confessed that he was\r\nbankrupt for lack of more worlds, and is reputed to have shed tears over\r\nhis failure, which might have been expected from a modern dry-goods\r\njobber, but not from Alexander. Cæsar and Bonaparte failed for the want\r\nof men: they do not seem to have been aware of the existence of Rhode\r\nIsland. I think Burr failed for the lack of impudence--he had more than\r\nall the rest of the world together, but he needed much more than that to\r\npush his projects ahead of his times. As for myself, when I have doubled\r\nmy capital, I shall found my bullion bank in the face of all opposition.\r\nThe ten-acre lot at the corner of Broadway and Wall street is already\r\nselected and paid for, and I shall excavate as soon as the present crop\r\nis off.\r\n\r\nThere is no question that the occupation of banking conduces to literary\r\npursuits. When I take interest out of my fellow beings, I naturally take\r\ninterest in them, and so fall to writing about them. I have in my\r\nportfolio sketches of all the leading merchants of the age, romantically\r\nwrought, and full of details of their private lives, hopes, fears, and\r\npleasures. These men that go up town every day have had, and still have,\r\nlittle fanciful excursions that are quite amusing when an observer of my\r\ntalent notes them down. I know all about old Boscobello, the Spanish\r\nmerchant, of the house of Boscobello, Bolaso & Co. My romance of his\r\nlife from twenty to forty fills three volumes, and is as exciting as the\r\ndiaries of those amusing French people whom Bossuet preached to with\r\nsuch small effect. Boscobello has sobered since forty, and begs for\r\nloans as an old business man ought to. I think he sees the error of his\r\nways, and is anxious to repair his fortunes to the old point, but it is\r\neasier to spend a million than to make it. My cashier reports his\r\naccount overdrawn the other day, and not made good till late next\r\nafternoon. This is a sign of failing circumstances, and must be attended\r\nto.\r\n\r\nWhen Boscobello comes in about half past two of an afternoon for the\r\nusual loan of a hundred dollars to enable him to go on, I amuse myself\r\nby talking to him while I look over his securities. He has two or three\r\nloans to pay up before three o'clock, in different parts of the town,\r\nand we cannot blame him for being in a hurry, but this is no concern of\r\nmine. If he _will_ get into a tight place, one may surely take one's\r\ntime at helping him out: and really it does require some little time to\r\ninvestigate the class of securities he brings, and which are\r\nastonishingly varied. For instance, he brought me to-day as collateral\r\nto an accommodation, a deed to a South Brooklyn block, title clouded; a\r\nMackerelville second mortgage; ten shares of coal-oil stock; an\r\nundivided quarter right in a guano island, and the note of a President\r\nof the Unterrified Insurance Company. 'How much was the cartage, Bos?'\r\nsaid I, for you see my great mind descends to the smallest particulars,\r\nand I was benevolent enough to wish to deduct his expenses from the\r\nbonus I was about to charge him for the loan. 'Never mind the cartage,'\r\nsaid he, 'that's a very strong list, and will command the money any day\r\nin Wall street, but I have a particular reason for getting it of you.'\r\n'The particular reason being,' said I, 'that you can't get it anywhere\r\nelse. Jennings,' I continued to my cashier, 'give Mr. Boscobello\r\nninety-five dollars Norfolk or Richmond due-bills, and take his check\r\npayable in current funds next Saturday for a hundred.'\r\n\r\nPoor old Boscobello! A man at forty ought not to look old, but Bos had\r\noften seen the sun rise before he went to bed, and he _had_ been gay, so\r\nall my aunts said. Some stories Bos has told me himself, o' nights at my\r\nhouse, after having in vain endeavored to induce me to take shares in\r\nthe guano island, or 'go into' South Brooklyn water lots. 'I'm too old\r\nfor that sort of a thing, Bos,' I say; 'it's quite natural for you to\r\nask me, and I don't blame you for trying it on, but you must find some\r\nyounger man. Tell me about that little affair with the mysterious Cuban\r\nlady; when you only weighed a hundred and forty pounds, and never went\r\nout without a thousand dollars in your pocket--in the blooming days of\r\nyouth, Bos, when you went plucking purple pansies along the shore.'\r\n\r\nBoscobello weighs over two hundred now, and would have a rush of blood\r\nto the head if he were to stoop to pluck pansies. Mysterious Cuban\r\nladies, in fact ladies of any description, would pass him by as a\r\nmiddle-aged person of a somewhat distressed appearance, and the dreams\r\nof his youth are quite dreamed out. Nevertheless, when he warms with my\r\nwhite Hermitage, the colors of his old life come richly out into sight,\r\nand the romantic adventures of wealth and high spirits overpower, though\r\nin the tame measures of recital, all the adverse influences of the\r\npresent hour. But as the evening wanes, the colors fade again; his\r\nvoice assumes a dreary tone; and I once more feel that I am with a man\r\nwho has outlived himself, and who, having never learned where the late\r\nroses blow, is now too old to learn.\r\n\r\nThe reader will perceive I am sorry for Boscobello. If I am remarkable\r\nfor anything, it is for my humanity, consideration, and sympathy.\r\n\r\nThese qualities of my constitution lead me to enter into the affairs of\r\nmy clients with feeling and sincerity, but I fear I am sometimes\r\nmisunderstood. Not long ago I issued an order to my junior partners to\r\nexercise more compassion for those unfortunate men with whom we decline\r\nbusiness, and not to tumble them down the front steps so roughly. Let\r\nsix of the porters attend with trestles, I said, and carry them out\r\ncarefully, and dump them with discretion in some quiet corner, where, as\r\nsoon as they recover their faculties, they may get up and walk away. I\r\nput it to the reader if this was not a very humane idea, and yet there\r\nare those who have stigmatized it as heartless.\r\n\r\nI wish I was better acquainted with the way in which common people live.\r\nI can see how I have made mistakes in consequence of not understanding\r\nthe restricted means and the exigencies of these people, who are styled\r\nrespectable merchants. Thus when Boscobello has made some more than\r\nordinarily piteous application, I have said, 'Boscobello, dismiss about\r\nfifty of your servants;' or, 'Boscobello, sell a railroad and put the\r\nmoney back again into your business;' or, 'Boscobello, my good friend,\r\nlimit your table, say, to turtle soup, champagne, and truffles; live\r\nmore plainly, and don't take above ten quarts of strawberries a day\r\nduring the winter,--the lower servants don't really need them;' or,\r\n'Boscobello, if you are really short, send around a hundred or so of\r\nyour fast trotters to my stables, and I'll pay you a long figure for\r\nthem, if they are warranted under two minutes.' Boscobello has never\r\nmade any very definite replies to such advice, and I have attributed his\r\nsilence to his nervousness; but I begin to suspect he has'nt quite\r\nunderstood me on such occasions. Then again, when Twigsmith declared he\r\nwas a ruined man, in consequence of my refusal of further advances, and\r\nthat he should be unable to provide for his family, I said: 'Why,\r\nTwigsmith, retire to one of your country seats, and live on the interest\r\nof some canal or other, or discount bonds and mortgages for the country\r\nbanks.' Actually, I heard Twigsmith mutter as he went out, that it\r\nwasn't right to insult a man's poverty. Now I hadn't the remotest idea\r\nof injuring Twigsmith's feelings, for he was a very clever fellow, and\r\nwe made a good thing out of him in his time, but it seems that my advice\r\nmight not have been properly grounded.\r\n\r\nIt begins to occur to me that there _may_ be such a case as that a man\r\nmay want something, and not be able to get it; and again, that at such a\r\ntime a weak mind may complain, and grow discouraged, and make itself\r\ndisagreeable to others.\r\n\r\nThere is a set of old fellows who call themselves family men, and apply\r\nfor discounts as if they had a right to them, by reason of their having\r\nfamilies to provide for. I have never yet been able to see the logical\r\nsequence of their conclusions, and so I tell them. What right does it\r\ngive anybody to my money that he has a wife, six children, and lives in\r\na large house with three nursery-maids, a cook, and a boy to clean the\r\nknives? 'Limit your expenses,' I say to these respectable gentlemen, 'do\r\nas I do. When Jennings comes to me on Monday morning, and reports that\r\nthe receipts of the week will be eighty millions, exclusive of the\r\nLabrador coupons, which, if paid, will be eighty millions more, I say,\r\n'Jennings, discount seventy, and don't encroach upon the reserves; you\r\nmay however let Boscobello have ten on call.' This is true philosophy;\r\nadapt your outlay to your income, and you will never be in trouble, or\r\ngo begging for loans. If the Bank of England had always managed in this\r\nway, they wouldn't have been obliged to call on our house for assistance\r\nduring the Irish famine.'\r\n\r\nThese family men invite me to their wives' parties, constantly,\r\nunremittingly. The billets sometimes reach my desk, although I have\r\ngiven orders to put them all into the waste basket unopened. I went to\r\none of these parties, only one, I give you my honor as a gentleman, and\r\nafter Twigsmith and his horrid wife had almost wrung my hand off, I was\r\npresented to a young female, to whom Nature had been tolerably kind, but\r\nwho was most shamefully dressed. In fact her dress couldn't have cost\r\nover a thousand dollars--one of my chambermaids going to a Teutonia ball\r\nis better got up. This young person asked me 'how I liked the Germania?'\r\nTaking it for granted that such a badly dressed young woman must be a\r\nschool teacher, with perhaps classical tastes, I replied that it was one\r\nof the most pleasing compositions of Tacitus, and that I occasionally\r\nread it of a morning. 'Oh, it's not very taciturn,' she replied; 'I mean\r\nthe band.' 'Very true,' said I, 'he says _agmen_, which you translate\r\nband very happily, though I might possibly say 'body' in a familiar\r\nreading.' 'Oh dear,' she replied, blushing, 'I'm sure I don't know what\r\nkind of men they are, nor anything about their bodies, but they\r\ncertainly seem very respectable, and they play elegantly; oh, don't you\r\nthink so?' 'I am glad you are pleased so easily,' I answered; 'Tacitus\r\ndescribes their performances as indeed fearful, and calculated to strike\r\nhorror into the hearts of their enemies. But,' continued I, endeavoring\r\nto make my retreat, for I began to think I was in company with an inmate\r\nof a private lunatic hospital, 'they were devoted to the ladies.'\r\n'Indeed they are,' said she,'and the harpist is _so_ gallant, and gets\r\nso many nice bouquets.' It then flashed across my mind that she meant\r\nthe Germania musicians. 'They might do passably well, madame,' said I,\r\n'for a quadrille party at a country inn, but for a dress ball or a\r\ndinner you would need three of them rolled into one.' 'Oh, you gentlemen\r\nare so hard to please,' she replied; and catching sight of the\r\nKoh-i-noor on my little finger, she began to smile so sweetly that I\r\nfled at once.\r\n\r\nIt was at that party that I perspired. I had heard doctors talk about\r\nperspiration, and I had seen waiters at a dinner with little drops on\r\ntheir faces, but I supposed it was the effect of a spatter, or that some\r\nchampagne had flown into their eyes, or something of that sort. But at\r\nthis party I happened to pass a mirror, and did it the honor to look\r\ninto it. I saw there the best dressed man in America, but his face was\r\nflushed, and there were drops on it. This is fearful, thought I; I took\r\nmy _mouchoir_ and gently removed them. They dampened the delicate\r\nfabric, and I shook with agitation. The large doors were open, and after\r\na struggle of an hour and three quarters, I reached them, and promising\r\nthe hostess to send my _valet_ in the morning to make my respects, which\r\nthe present exigency would not allow me to stay to accomplish, I was\r\nrapidly whirled homeward. I can hardly pen the details, but on the\r\nremoval of my linen, it was found--can I go on?--tumbled, and here and\r\nthere the snowy lawn confessed a small damp spot, or fleck of moisture.\r\nRemorse and terror seized me. Medical attendance was called, and I\r\npassed the night in a bath of attar of roses delicately medicated with\r\n_aqua pura_. Of course, I have never again appeared at a party.\r\n\r\nPeople haven't right ideas of entertainment. What entertainment is it to\r\nstand all the evening in a set of sixteen-by-twenty parlors, jammed in\r\namong all sorts of strange persons, and stranger perfumes, deafened with\r\na hubbub of senseless talk, and finally be led down to feed at a long\r\ntable where the sherry is hot, and the partridges are cold? Very\r\nprobably some boy or other across the table lets off a champagne cork\r\ninto your eyes, and the fattest men in the room _will_ tread on your\r\ntoes. One might describe such scenes of torture at length, but the\r\nrecital of human follies and miseries is not agreeable to my\r\nsensibilities.\r\n\r\nI dare say the reader might find himself gratified at one of my little\r\nfètes. The editors of this journal attend them regularly, and have done\r\nme the honor to approve of them. You enter on Twelfth avenue; a modest\r\ndoor just off Nine-and-a-half street opens quietly, and you are ushered\r\nby a polite gentleman--one of our city bank presidents, who takes this\r\nmeans to increase his income--into an attiring room. Here you are\r\ndressed by the most accomplished Schneider of the age, in your own\r\nselections from an unequalled _repertoire_ of sartorial _chef d'ouvres_,\r\nand your old clothes are sent home in an omnibus.\r\n\r\nI might delight you with a description of the ball room, but the editors\r\nhave requested me to the contrary. Some secrets of gorgeous splendor\r\nthere are which are wisely concealed from the general gaze. But a floor\r\nthree hundred feet square, and walls as high as the mast of an East\r\nBoston clipper, confer ample room for motion; and the unequalled\r\natmosphere of the saloon is perhaps unnecessarily refreshed by fountains\r\nof rarest distilled waters. This is also my picture gallery, where all\r\nmythology is exhausted by the great painters of the antique; and modern\r\nart is thoroughly illustrated by the famous landscapes of both\r\nhemispheres. The luxuriant fancy of my favorite artist has suggested\r\nunique collocations of aquaria and mossy grottoes in the angles of the\r\napartment, where the vegetable wealth of the tropics rises in perfect\r\nbounty and lawless exuberance, and fishes of every hue and shape flash\r\nto and fro among the tangled roots, in the light of a thousand lamps. In\r\nthe centre, I have caused the seats of the orchestra to be hidden at the\r\nsummit of a picturesque group of rocks, profusely hung with vegetation,\r\nand gemmed with a hundred tiny fountains that trickle in bright beads\r\nand diamonds into the reservoir at the base. From this eminence, the\r\nmelody of sixty unequalled performers pervades the saloon, justly\r\ndiffused, and on all sides the same; unlike the crude arrangements of\r\nmost modern orchestras, where at one end of the room you are deluged\r\nwith music, and at the other extremity you distinguish the notes with\r\npain or difficulty. The ceiling, by a rare combination of mechanical\r\ningenuity and artistic inspiration, displays, so as to quite deceive the\r\nsenses, the heavens with all their stars moving in just and harmonious\r\norder. Here on summer nights you see Lyra and Altair triumphantly\r\nblazing in the middle sky as they sweep their mighty arch through the\r\nample zenith; and low in the south, the Scorpion crawls along the verge\r\nwith the red Antares at his heart, and the bright arrows of the Archer\r\nforever pursuing him. Here in winter, gazing up through the warm and\r\nperfumed air, you behold those bright orbs that immemorially suggest the\r\nicy blasts of January: Aldebaran; the mighty suns of Orion; diamond-like\r\nCapella; and the clear eyes of the Gemini. Under such influences, with\r\nthe breath of the tropics in your nostrils, and your heart stirred by\r\nthe rich melodies of the invisible orchestra, waltzing becomes a sublime\r\npassion, in which all your faculties dilate to utmost expansion, and you\r\nfloat out into happy forgetfulness of time and destiny.\r\n\r\nRarely at these fêtes do we dance to other measures than those of the\r\nwaltz, though at times we find a relief from the luxuriance of that\r\ndivine rhythm in the cooler cadences of the Schottish. By universal\r\nconsent and instinct, we banish the quadrille, stiff and artificial; the\r\npolka, inelegant and essentially vulgar; and the various hybrid\r\nmeasures with which the low ingenuity of professors has filled society.\r\nBut we move like gods and goddesses to the sadly joyful strains of\r\nStrauss and Weber and Beethoven and Mozart, and the mighty art of these\r\ngreat masters fills and re-creates all our existence.\r\n\r\nSometimes in these divine hours, thrilled by the touch of a companion\r\nwhose heart beats against and consonantly with mine, I catch glimpses of\r\nthe possibilities of a free life of the spirit when it shall be released\r\nfrom earth and gravitation, and I conjecture the breadth of a future\r\nexistence. This will only seem irrational to such as have squeezed out\r\ntheir souls flat between the hard edges of dollars, or have buried them\r\namong theologic texts which they are too self-wise to understand.\r\nHistory and the experience of the young are with me.\r\n\r\nFrom twelve to four you sup, when, and as, and where, you will. A\r\nsuccession of little rooms lie open around an atrium, all different as\r\nto size and ornament, yet none too large for a single couple, and none\r\ntoo small for the reunion of six. What charming accidents of company and\r\nconversation sometimes occur in these Lucullian boudoirs! You pass and\r\nrepass, come and go, at your own pleasure. Waltzing, and Burgundy, and\r\nLove, and Woodcock are here combined into a dramatic poem, in which we\r\nare all star performers, and sure of applause. These hours cannot last\r\nforever, and the first daybeams that tell of morning, are accompanied by\r\nthose vague feelings of languor that hint to us that we are mortal. Then\r\nwe pause, and separate before these faint hints of our imperfection\r\ndeepen into distasteful monitions, and before our fulness of enjoyment\r\ndegenerates into satiety. Antiquity has conferred an immortal blessing\r\nupon us in bequeathing to us that golden legend, NE QUID NIMIS;[19] a\r\nlegend better than all the teachings of Galen, or than all the dialogues\r\nof Socrates. For in these brief words are compressed the experiences of\r\nthe best lives, and Alcibiades and Zeno might equally profit by them.\r\nThey contain the priceless secret of happiness; and do you, reader,\r\nwisely digest them till we meet again.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: 'Not too much.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLDIER.\r\n\r\n[BURNS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  For gold the merchant ploughs the main,\r\n    The farmer ploughs the manor;\r\n  But glory is the soldier's pride,\r\n    The soldier's wealth is honor.\r\n  The brave, poor soldier ne'er despise,\r\n    Nor count him as a stranger;\r\n  Remember he's his country's stay\r\n    In day and hour of danger!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR PRESENT POSITION: ITS DANGERS AND ITS DUTIES.\r\n\r\nADDRESSED TO THE PEOPLE OF ALL POLITICAL PARTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Daniel Webster replied to Senator Hayne, of South Carolina, during\r\nthe exciting debate on the right of secession, he commenced his\r\never-memorable speech with these words:\r\n\r\n     'When the mariner has been tossed for many days in thick weather\r\n     and on an unknown sea, he naturally avails himself of the first\r\n     pause in the storm--the earliest glance of the sun--to take his\r\n     latitude, and ascertain how far the elements have driven him from\r\n     his true course. Let us imitate this prudence before we float\r\n     farther, that we may at least be able to conjecture where we now\r\n     are.'\r\n\r\nNo words are fitter for our ears at this tumultuous period than are\r\nthese, when the passions of our countrymen, North and South, are excited\r\nwith the bitterest animosity, and when the discordant cries of party\r\nfaction at the North are threatening a desolation worse than that of\r\ncontending armies. In considering, then, our condition, it behooves us\r\nfirst, to 'take our latitude, and ascertain where we now are,'--not as a\r\nsection or a party, but as a nation and a people. Let us avail ourselves\r\nof that distant and dim glimmer in the heavens which even now is looked\r\nupon by the sanguine as the promise of peace, and in its light survey\r\nour dangers and nerve ourselves to our duties. We behold, then, a\r\npeople, bound together by the ties of a common interest, namely,\r\nnational prosperity and renown, and in possession of a land more favored\r\nby natural elements of advantage than any other on the face of the\r\nglobe. We see them standing up in the ranks of hostile resistance each\r\nto each, the one great and glorious army fighting for the restoration of\r\na nation once the envy of the world; the other great and glorious army\r\nequally ardent and valorous in behalf of a separation of that territory\r\nin which they are taught to believe we cannot hold together in peace and\r\namity. Both armies and people are evincing in their very warfare the\r\nelements of character which heretofore distinguished us as a nation, and\r\nare employing the very means for each other's destruction which were of\r\nlate the principles of action which rendered us in the highest degree a\r\nnation worthy of respect at home and admiration abroad. It is not the\r\npurpose of this paper to go back to causes or to relate the subsequent\r\nevents which have placed us where we are. These causes and events are\r\nwell known to us and to the world. But here we now stand, with this\r\nfratricidal war increased to the most alarming proportions, and with,\r\nresults but partially developed. Here we of the North stand, with a\r\nstill invincible army, loyal to the cause nearest to the heart of every\r\npatriot, and confident in the ability to withstand and overcome the\r\nmachinations of the enemy. Here, too, we--ay, _we_ of the South stand,\r\nbound together in a common aim, an ardent hope, and a proclaimed and\r\nomnipotent impulse to action. _This is the only proper view to take of\r\nthe case_--to regard our opponents as we regard ourselves, and to give\r\ndue credit where credit is due for valor, for motives, and for\r\nprinciples of action. The North believes itself to be engaged in a\r\nstrife forced upon it by blinded prejudice and evil passion, and fights\r\nfor that which, if not worthy of fighting, ay, and dying for, is unfit\r\nto live for, namely, national integrity. The South claims, little as we\r\ncan understand it, the same ground for rising against the land they had\r\nsworn to protect, and whose fathers died with our fathers to create. We\r\nat the North would have been pusillanimous and weak indeed had we\r\nsilently submitted to that which is in our view against every principle\r\nof national right and renown. To have acted otherwise would have been to\r\nbring down upon our heads the scorn and contempt of our enemies and of\r\nevery foreign power, from the strongest oligarchy to the most benevolent\r\nform of monarchical government. Hence it is that while certain foreign\r\npowers have not failed to improve the opportunity of our weakness, as a\r\ndivided nation, to insult and sneer, to preach peace with dishonor, and\r\nadvocate separation, which they know to be but another word for\r\nhumiliation, yet have they not failed to see and been forced to confess\r\nthat, divided as we are, we have shown inherent greatness and power,\r\n_which, united, would be a degree of national superiority which might\r\nwell defy the world_. Nothing is more striking at this moment than this\r\ngreat fact, and no topic is more worthy of the serious consideration of\r\nour countrymen, North and South, than this. No time is fitter than now\r\nto suggest the subject, and to see in it matter which is pregnant with\r\nhopes for our future. If nothing but this great truth had been developed\r\nby the war--this truth, bold, naked, defiant as it is, _is worth the\r\nwar_--worth all its cost of noble lives, of sacred blood, of yet\r\nuncounted treasure. We stand before the world this day divided by the\r\nfearful conflict, with malignant hate lighting the fires of either camp,\r\nand with hands reeking in fraternal blood--with both sections of our\r\nland more or less afflicted--with credit impaired, with the scoff and\r\njeers of nations ringing in our ears--we stand losers of almost every\r\nthing but our individual self-respect, which has inspired both foes with\r\nthe ardor and courage born within us as Americans. This it is that\r\nleaves us unshorn of our strength; this it is that enables us in this\r\nvery day of trial and adversity to present to the world the undeniable\r\nfact that we have within us--not as Northerners, not as Southerners,\r\n_but as Americans_--the elements of innate will and physical power,\r\nwhich makes the scale of valor hang almost with an even beam, and\r\nforetells us, with words which we cannot but hear--and which would to\r\nGod we might heed!--that, united, we can rear up on this beautiful and\r\nbountiful land a temple of political, social, and commercial prosperity,\r\nmore glorious than that which entered into the dreams and aspirations of\r\nthe fathers who founded it.\r\n\r\nAlas! that the contemplation of so worthy a theme is marred by the 'ifs'\r\nand 'buts' of controversial strife. Alas! that we cannot depress the\r\nsectional opposing interests which are but secondary to a condition of\r\npolitical consolidation, and elevate above these distracting and\r\nisolated evils, the great and eternal principle, Strength as it alone\r\nexists in Unity. Alas! that with the beam of suicidal measures we blind\r\nthe eye political, because, forsooth, the motes of individual or local\r\ninjuries afflict, as they afflict _all_ human forms of government.\r\n\r\nThe great evil, North and South, before the war, during the war, and\r\nnow, is the want of political charity--that charity which, like its\r\nmoral prototype, 'suffereth long and is kind.' We the people, North and\r\nSouth, have been and are unwilling to grant to the other people and\r\nStates the right to think, speak, and urge their own opinions--the very\r\nright which each insists upon claiming for itself. It has been held\r\n'dangerous' to discuss questions which, though in one sense pertaining\r\nonly to particular States, nevertheless bear upon the whole country. It\r\nhas been considered 'heresy' to urge with rhetoric and declamation, even\r\nin our halls of Congress, certain principles for and against Slavery,\r\nfor example, lest mischief result from the agitation of those topics.\r\nBut in such remonstrance we have forgotten that the very principle of\r\ndemocratic institutions involves the right of all men to think and act,\r\nunder the law, as each pleases. We have also forgotten that any subject\r\nwhich will not bear discussion and political consideration must be\r\ndangerous _in itself_, and pregnant with weakness, if not evil. There is\r\nno harm in discussing questions upon which hang vital principles; for if\r\nthere exists on the one side strength and justice, all arguments on the\r\nother side can do it no injury. With regard to Slavery, one of the\r\n'causes' or 'occasions' of this unhappy war, it may be said that the\r\nNorth owes much to the South which it has never paid, in a true and\r\nkindly appreciation of the difficulties which have ever surrounded the\r\ninstitutions of the latter. But let us not forget that one reason why\r\nthis debt has not been paid is because the South owes the North its\r\nvalue received, by not being willing to admit in the other's behalf the\r\nmotives which underlay the efforts which have been made by the earnest,\r\nor so-called 'radical' men, who have opposed the institution of slavery.\r\nPure misunderstanding of motive, pure lack of political as well as moral\r\ncharity, has been wanting between the men of the North who opposed, and\r\nthe men of the South who maintained the extension of slavery. Had each\r\nunderstood the other better, it is probable that the character of each\r\nwould have assumed the following proportions: The slaveholder of the\r\nSouth, inheriting from generations back a system of servitude which even\r\nancient history supported and defended, and which he in his inmost heart\r\nbelieves to be beneficial to the slave not less than the master, regards\r\nhimself as violating no law of God or man in receiving from this\r\ninferior race or grade of men the labor of their hands, and the right to\r\ntheir control, while they draw from him the necessary physical support\r\nand protection which it is in his belief his bounden duty to give. The\r\nplanter, a gentleman educated and a Christian, with the fear of God\r\nbefore his eyes, believes this--the belief was born in him and dies in\r\nhim, and he is conscientiously faithful in carrying out the principles\r\nof his faith. I speak now of no exceptional, but of general cases,\r\ninstancing only the representative of the highest class of Southern men.\r\nIs it to be wondered at that such a man, looking from _his_ point of\r\nvision, should regard with suspicion and distrust the efforts of those\r\nwho sought to abolish even by gradual means the apparent sources of his\r\nprosperity? Is it remarkable that he should regard as his enemy the man\r\nwho preaches against and denounces as criminal the very system in which\r\nhe trusts his social and political safety? He will not regard that\r\napparent enemy what at heart and soul he really is, namely, a man as\r\npure and devout, as well meaning and conscientious as himself. The man\r\nwhom he scoffs at as a 'radical,' an 'abolitionist,' and a 'fanatic,' by\r\neducation and intuition believes in his very soul that the holding of\r\nmen in bondage, forcing from them involuntary labor, and the\r\nconsequences thereof, are pregnant with moral and political ruin and\r\ndecay. The system, not the men, is offensive to his eyes. Is he to blame\r\nfor this opinion, provided it be well founded in his mind? Admit it\r\neroneous in logic, still, if he believes it, is he to be condemned for\r\nholding the belief, and would he not be contemptible in his own eyes if\r\nhe feared to express the moral convictions of his soul? The error of\r\nboth has been that both are uncharitable--both unwilling to allow the\r\nright of opinion and freedom of debate on what both, as American\r\ncitizens, hold to be vital principles, dependent upon constitutional\r\nprovisions; the one claiming Slavery as the 'corner stone of political\r\nfreedom,' the other as the stumbling block in the way of its\r\nadvancement. This unwillingness to appreciate the motives of opposing\r\nminds led at last one section of our beloved country to an unwillingness\r\nto recognize the right of election, and, worse than all, an\r\nunwillingness to abide by the results of that election. When that\r\nprinciple--submission to the will of the majority--was overthrown, then,\r\nindeed, did the pillars of our national temple tremble, and the seat of\r\nour national power rock in its foundation.\r\n\r\nAnd now a word in connection with this same principle of submission, as\r\napplicable to the people of the North in our present emergency. In\r\naccordance with the plan adopted by the founders of our Government, and\r\npractically illustrated in the election of George Washington and his\r\nsuccessors, the people by a plurality of votes elected to office and\r\nplaced at the head of our political system as its highest authority and\r\nruler, the present Chief Magistrate. From the day of his acknowledged\r\nelection, party politics settled into the calm of acquiescence, and all\r\nloyal and true States and men bowed to the arbitrament of the ballot\r\nbox. That man, Abraham Lincoln, instantly became invested with the\r\npotential right of rule under the Constitution, and the great principle\r\nof constitutional liberty in his election and elevation stood justified.\r\nIt mattered not then, nor matters it now, to us, what may be individual\r\nopinion of his merits or demerits, his ability or his disability. There\r\nhe is, not as a private citizen, but as the head of our Government: his\r\nindividuality is lost in his official embodiment. This principle being\r\nacknowledged, and party opinion being buried, in theory at least, at the\r\nfoot of the altar of the Government _de facto_, whence is it that at\r\nthis time creeps into our council chambers, our political cliques, our\r\nsocial haunts, our market places, ay, our most sacred tabernacles--a\r\nspirit adverse to the principles for which we are fighting, laboring\r\nfor, and dying for? Let us--a people anxious for peace on honorable\r\ngrounds, anxious for a Union which no rash hand shall ever again attempt\r\nto destroy--look, with a moment's calm reflection, at this alarming\r\nevil.\r\n\r\nIt is very evident to most men that, in spite of temporary defeats and\r\nan unexpected prolongation of the war, the loyal States hold\r\nunquestionably the preponderance of power. Nothing but armed\r\nintervention from abroad can now affect even temporarily this\r\npreponderance. As events and purposes are seen more clearly through the\r\nsmoke of the battle fields by the ever-watchful eyes of Europe, armed\r\nintervention becomes less and less a matter of probability. The hopes of\r\nan honorable peace, therefore, hang upon the increase and continuance of\r\nthis military preponderance. With the spirit of determination evinced by\r\nboth combatants, the unflinching valor of both armies, and with the\r\nunquestioned resources and ability to hold out of the North, it appears\r\nevident that the strife for mastery will in time terminate in favor of\r\nthe loyal States. There is but one undermining influence which can\r\ndefeat this end, and still further prolong the war, or, what is worse,\r\nplunge the North into the irretrievable disaster of internal\r\nconflict--and that undermining influence is _dissension among\r\nourselves_. Such a consummation would bring joy to the hearts of our\r\nenemies and lend them the first ray of real hope that ultimate\r\nseparation will be their purchased peace. We will not here draw a\r\npicture of that fallacious peace, that suicidal gap, whose festering\r\npolitical sore would breed misery and ruin, not only for ourselves, but\r\nfor our posterity, for ages to come. But let us be warned in time. Even\r\nnow the insidious movement of dissension is hailed with satisfaction and\r\ndelight in the council meetings at Richmond, and no effort will be\r\nspared to aid its devastating progress. False rumors will be raised on\r\nthe slightest and most insignificant grounds. Trivial mistakes and\r\nblunders in the cabinet and the field will be magnified; facts\r\ndistorted, and the flame be blown by corrupting influences abroad and\r\nat home, in the hopes--let them be vain hopes--that we the people will\r\nbe diverted from the great cause we have most at heart into side issues\r\nand sectional distrust. And why? Because more powerful than serried\r\nhosts and open warfare is the poison of sedition and conspiracy that is\r\nthrown into the cup of domestic peace and confidence--more fatal than\r\nthe ravages of the battle field is that of the worm that creeps slowly\r\nand surely--weakening, as it works, the foundations of the edifice in\r\nwhich we dwell unsuspicious of evil. Is it astonishing that they, the\r\nenemies of our common weal, should rejoice in these signs of incipient\r\nweakness, or fail to resort to any expedient whereby our strength as a\r\nunited and loyal people can be made less? Have they not shown themselves\r\ncapable and ready to avail themselves of every weakness in our counsels\r\nand in the field? Would not we do the same did we perceive distrust and\r\ndissatisfaction presenting through the mailed armor of our opponents a\r\nvulnerable point for attack? Then blame them not with muttered\r\nimprecations, but look--ay, look to ourselves. The shape of this\r\nundermining influence is political dissension at a period when the name\r\nof 'party' ought to be obliterated from the people's creed. Let opinion\r\non measures and men have full and unrestricted sway, so far as these\r\nopinions may silently work under the banner of the one great cause of\r\nself-preservation; but let them not interfere with the prosecution of\r\nthe efforts of the Government, whether State or national, to prosecute\r\nthis holy and patriotic war in defence of the principles which created\r\nand are to keep us a united nation. Let us not tempt the strength of the\r\nice that covers the waters of political and partisan problems, while we\r\nhave enough to do to protect and cover the solid ground already in our\r\npossession. The President of the United States, be he who or what he\r\nmay--think he how or what he will, enact he what he chooses--is, let us\r\nremember, the corner stone of our political liberty. The Constitution is\r\na piece of parchment--sacred and to be revered--but it is, in its\r\noutward presentment, material and inactive. The _spirit_ of the\r\nConstitution is intangible and ideal, its interpretation alone is its\r\nvitality. We the people--through equally material morsels of paper\r\nentitled votes--raise the spirit of the Constitution by placing in the\r\nhalls of Congress the interpreters of that Constitution, over whom and\r\nabove all sits the Chief Magistrate, who, once endowed by us with power,\r\nretains and sways it until another, by the same process, carries out at\r\nour will the same eventualities. Our part as electors and adjudicators\r\nis done, and it ill becomes us to weaken or hold up to the ridicule of\r\nthe world the power therein invested, by questions as to the President's\r\n'right' or 'power' or 'ability' to enact this measure or that.\r\n\r\nAway then with the unseemly cry of 'the Constitution as it is,' 'the\r\nUnion at it was,' the 'expediency' or 'non-expediency' of employing the\r\nwar power, the interference or the non-interference of the man and the\r\nmen established by us to represent us with the military leaders, the\r\nfinances, or the thousand and one implements of administration, _which\r\nthey are bound to employ_, not as we, but as they, holding our powers of\r\nattorney for a specified and legalized period, in their human wisdom\r\ndeem best for the common good of the land. Let us have faith in the\r\nmotives and intentions of our political administration, or if we have\r\nlost our faith, let us submit--patiently and with accord. Above all, at\r\na period like this, when the minds of the best men and the truest are\r\noppressed with a sense of the injustice with which a portion of our\r\ncountrymen regard us, it most behooves us to keep our social and\r\npolitical ranks closed and in order, subject to the will of that\r\ncommander, disobedience to which is infamy and ruin. No matter with\r\nwhat diversity of tongues and opinions we pursue our individual\r\navocations and aims, we are all pilgrims pressing forward like the\r\nfollowers of Mohammed to the Kêbla stone of _our_ faith--Peace founded\r\non Union.\r\n\r\nWhat if a party clique utters sentiments adverse to our own on the never\r\nceasing topic of political policy? Is it not the expression of a mind or\r\na hundred minds forming a portion of the great body politic, of which we\r\nourselves are a part, and are they not entitled to their opinion and\r\nmodes of expressing it, providing it be done with decorum and with a\r\nproper respect for the opinions of their adversaries? Why then do we or\r\nthey employ, through the press and in rhetorical bombast, opprobrious\r\nepithets, fit only for the pot-house or the shambles? Shall we men and\r\ncitizens, each of us a pillar upholding the crowning dome of our\r\nnationality, be taught, like vexed and querulous children, the impotence\r\nof personal abuse? Why seek to lay upon the head of this Cabinet officer\r\nor that, this Senator or that, the responsibility of temporary military\r\ndefeats, when we are no more able to command and prevent reverses than\r\nare they? Or if in our superior wisdom we deem ourselves to be the\r\nbetter able to direct and administer, why do we forget that others among\r\nus, inspired by the same love of country, and equally ardent for its\r\nsafety and advancement, hold exactly contrary opinions? It is not a\r\nmatter of opinion--it is not a matter for interference, it is simply and\r\nonly a matter for untiring unflinching confidence and support. We have\r\ndone our duty as a people, and elected our Administration--let us, in\r\nthe name of all that is sublime and fundamental in republican\r\nprinciples, support and not perplex them in the hard and complex problem\r\nwhich they are appointed to solve. These are principles, which, however\r\ntrite, need to be kept before us and practically sustained at a period\r\nwhen, as is often the case in long and tedious wars, the dispiriting\r\ninfluence of delays and occasional defeats work erroneous conclusions in\r\nthe minds of the people, leading to unjust accusations against the men\r\nin power, and an unwillingness to frankly acknowledge that the evil too\r\noften originated where the result most immediately occurred. In other\r\nwords, our armies have often suffered simply and for no other reason\r\nthan that they were outgeneralled on the field of battle, or overpowered\r\nby military causes for which no one is to blame--least of all, the\r\nPresident or his advisers.\r\n\r\nAnd here let one word be said against the arguments of those\r\nwell-meaning and patriotic men who attempt to prove that certain acts of\r\nthe Government have been injudicious and unwise--such, for example, as\r\nthe suspension of the habeas corpus, the alleged illegal arrests, and\r\nthe emancipation policy. It is not the purpose of this paper to enter\r\ninto additional argument to sustain this opinion or to disprove it. But\r\nin justice to the Government--simply because it is a Government--let it\r\nnot be forgotten that when events heretofore unforeseen and unprepared\r\nfor are throwing our vast nation into incalculable confusion, and when\r\nit becomes absolutely imperative that the head of the Government must\r\nact decisively and according to the promptness of his honest judgment,\r\nand when we know equally well that that judgment, be it what it may,\r\ncannot accord with the various and diverse opinions of _all_ men, then\r\nit behooves his countrymen, if not to acquiesce in, to support whatever\r\nthat honest judgment may decide to be best for the emergency. No doubt,\r\nerrors have been made, but they are errors inconceivably less in their\r\nresults than would be the unpardonable sin of the people, should they,\r\nbecause differing in opinion, weaken the hands and confuse the purposes\r\nof the powers that be. With secret and treacherous foes in our very\r\nmidst, hidden behind the masks of a painted loyalty, the President,\r\nafter deep and earnest consultation and reflection, deemed it his duty\r\nto authorize arrests under circumstances which he solemnly believed were\r\nthe best adapted to arrest the evil, though, by so doing, many good and\r\ninnocent men might temporarily suffer with the bad. So too with regard\r\nto the proclamation of freedom--be the step wise or unwise, and there is\r\nby no means a unity of sentiment on this head--the President conceived\r\nit to be the duty of his office--a duty which never entered into his\r\nplans or intentions until the war had increased to gigantic and\r\nthreatening proportions--to level a blow at what he and millions of his\r\ncountrymen believe to be the stronghold of the enemy, viz., that system\r\nof human servitude which nourished the body politic and social now\r\nstanding in armed and fearful resistance to the Constitution and the\r\nlaws. It matters not, so far as opinion goes, whether the step was wise\r\nor foolish, if the executive head deemed it wise. Nor was it a hasty or\r\nspasmodic movement on his part. Months were devoted to its\r\nconsideration, and every argument was patiently and candidly listened to\r\nfrom all the representatives of political theory for and against. Even\r\nthen no hasty step was taken; but, on the contrary, our deluded\r\ncountrymen in arms against us were forewarned, and earnestly,\r\nrespectfully advised and entreated to take that step in behalf of Union\r\nand peace, which would leave their institution as it had existed. Nay,\r\nmore: terms whereby no personal inconvenience or pecuniary loss to them\r\nwould be involved if they would but be simply loyal to the Government,\r\nwere liberally offered them, with three months for their consideration.\r\nLet those of us who, notwithstanding these ameliorating circumstances,\r\ndoubt the good policy of the act, remember that they of the South, our\r\nopen foes, invited the measures. Their leaders acknowledged and their\r\npress boasted that the Southern army never could be overcome--if for no\r\nother reason, for this reason, that while the army of the North was\r\ncomposed of the bone and muscle of the great working classes, drawn away\r\nfrom the fields of labor and enterprise, which must necessarily, in\r\ntheir opinion, languish from this absence, the Confederate army was\r\ncomposed of 'citizens' and property owners (to wit, slaveholders), whose\r\nabsence from their plantations in no way interfered with the growth of\r\ntheir cotton, sugar, corn, and rice, from which sources of wealth and\r\nnourishment they could continue to draw the sinews of war. They went\r\nfarther than this, and acted upon their declaration by employing their\r\nsurplus slave labor in the work of intrenching their fortifications,\r\nserving their army, and finally fighting in their army.\r\n\r\nUpon this basis of slave labor they asserted their omnipotence in war\r\nand ability to continue the struggle without limit of time. The\r\nsubsidized press of England supported this theory, and declared that\r\nwith such advantages it was idle for the Federal Government to maintain\r\na struggle in the face of such belligerent advantages! Then, and not\r\ntill then, were the eyes of the President open to a fact which none but\r\nthe political blind man could fail to observe, and then it was that not\r\nonly the President, but a very large proportion of our countrymen,\r\nheretofore strictly conservative men, felt that the time had come when\r\nfurther forbearance would be suicidal. Although many doubted and still\r\ndoubt if slavery was the cause of the rebellion, very many were forced\r\nto the conclusion that what our enemies themselves admitted to be the\r\nstrength of the rebellion was indeed such, and that the time had arrived\r\nto avail themselves of that military necessity which authorizes the\r\nGovernment to adopt such measures as may be deemed the most fitting for\r\ncrushing rebellion and restoring our constitutional liberty. Let us\r\nthink, then, as we please upon the judiciousness of the\r\nproclamation--that it was uttered with forethought, calmness, and with a\r\nfull sense of the responsibility of the President to his God and his\r\ncountry, none of us can deny. With this we should be satisfied. We have\r\nbut one duty before us, then, as a government and a people--and that is,\r\nan earnest, devoted prosecution of this war for the integrity of our\r\ncommon country. In the untrammelled hands of that Government let us\r\nleave its prosecution. We have but one duty before us as individuals,\r\nand that is to support the existing Government with our individual\r\nmight. Let the cry be loud and long, as, thank Heaven, it still is, 'On\r\nwith the war,' not for war's sake, but for the sake of that peace, which\r\nonly war, humanely and vigorously conducted, can achieve.\r\n\r\nFling personal ambition and individual aggrandizement to the winds. Let\r\npolitical preferment and partisan proclivities bide their time, and as a\r\nunited and one-minded people, devote heart and mind, strength and money,\r\nto the prosecution of the campaign, without considering what may be its\r\nduration, and without fear of circumstance or expenditure. If it be\r\nnecessary, let the public debt be increased until it reaches and exceeds\r\nthe public liabilities of the most indebted Government of Europe. We and\r\nour descendants will cheerfully pay the interest on that expenditure\r\nwhich purchased so great a blessing as national endurability. Meanwhile,\r\nwith unity, forbearance, perseverance, and the silent administration of\r\nthe ballot box, we will, as a people, maintain, notwithstanding that a\r\nportion of the land we hold dear stands severed from us by hatred and\r\nprejudice, the prosperity which we still claim, and the renown which was\r\nonce accorded to us. By so doing, and by so doing only, shall our former\r\ngrandeur come back to us--though its garments be stained with blood. A\r\ngrandeur which, without hyperbole, it may be said, will outstrip the\r\nglory which, as a young and sanguine people, we have ever claimed for\r\nour country. The reason for so believing is the simple and undeniable\r\nfact that out of the saddening humiliation and devastation of this civil\r\nwar has arisen the better knowledge of the wonderful resources,\r\nabilities, and determined spirit of the American people. We see--both\r\ncombatants--that we are giants fighting, and not quarrelling pigmies, as\r\nthe foreign enemies of us both have vainly attempted to prove. We see,\r\nboth combatants, how vast and important to each is the territory we are\r\nstruggling for, how inseparable to our united interests are the sources\r\nof wealth imbedded in our rocks, underlying our soil, and growing in its\r\nbeneficent bosom. We see, both combatants, how strong is the commerce of\r\nthe East to supply, like a diligent handmaiden, the wants of every\r\nsection; how bountiful are the plantations of the South and the\r\ngranaries of the West to keep the world united to us in the strong bonds\r\nof commercial and friendly intercourse; how absolutely necessary to the\r\nprosperity of both are the deep and wide-flowing rivers which run, like\r\nsilver bands of peace, through the length and breadth of a land whose\r\nvast privileges we have been too blind to appreciate, and in that\r\nblindness would destroy. Above all, we are _beginning_ to see that like\r\ntwo mighty champions fighting for the belt of superiority, we can\r\nneither of us achieve that individual advantage which can utterly and\r\nforever place the other beyond the ability of again accepting the\r\ngauntlet of defiance, and that our true and lasting glory can alone\r\nproceed from a determination to shake hands in peace, and, as united\r\nchampions, defying no longer each other, defy the world. Nor would the\r\nSouth in consenting to a reunion _now_ find humiliation or dishonor. She\r\nhas proved herself a noble foe--quick in expedient, firm in\r\ndetermination, valorous in war. We know each other the better for the\r\ncontest; we shall, when peace returns, respect each other the more; and\r\nalthough the cost of that peace, whenever it comes, will be the\r\nsacrifice of many local prejudices and sectional privileges, what, oh,\r\nwhat are such sacrifices to the inestimable blessings of national\r\nsalvation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPLAINING BORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the most disagreeable people one meets with in life are those who\r\nmake a business of complaining. They ask for sympathy when they merit\r\ncensure. There is no excuse for man or woman making known their private\r\ngriefs except to intimate friends or those who stand in the nearest\r\nrelation to them. I have no patience with the man who wishes to catch\r\nthe public ear with the sound of his repining. Be it that he complain of\r\nthe world generally, or specify the particular occasion of his\r\ndumpishness, he is in either aspect equally contemptible. What a\r\nserio-comic spectacle a man presents who imagines that everybody is in a\r\nleagued conspiracy against him to disappoint his hopes and thwart his\r\nplans for success! He thinks he is kept from rising by some untoward\r\nfate that is bent on crushing him into the ground, feels that he is the\r\nvictim of persecution, the sport of angry gods. Not having the spirit of\r\na martyr, he frets and fumes about his condition, and finds a selfish\r\nrelief in counting over his grievances in the presence of all who are\r\ngood-natured enough to listen. Such a fellow is a social nuisance--away\r\nwith him! The fact usually is that the world has more reason to complain\r\nof him than he of the world. For instance, I know a man who has become\r\nmisanthropic, but who should hate himself instead of the whole race.\r\n\r\nMr. Jordan Algrieve has become disgusted with life, and confesses than\r\nhis experiment with existence has thus far proved a failure. He has\r\ncombated with the world, and the world has proved too much for him, and\r\nhe acknowledges the defeat. Mr. Algrieve is on the shady side of fifty,\r\nand his hair getting to be of an iron gray. His features are prominent,\r\nwith a face wrinkled and shrivelled by discontent and acidity of temper.\r\nHis tall figure is bent, not so much by cares and weight of years, as in\r\na kind of typical submission to the stern decree of an evil destiny.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, he is well educated, and graduated with honor at one of\r\nour Eastern colleges. With a knowledge of this fact, it is pitiable to\r\nsee him standing at the corner of the street in his busy town in a suit\r\nof seedy black and a shockingly bad hat, chafing his hands together and\r\npretending to wait for somebody who never comes.\r\n\r\nPoor Algrieve, he is a man under the table, and he knows it. He has\r\ntried to be somebody in his way, but has failed sadly in all his\r\nefforts. It is said that Algrieve always had a constitutional aversion\r\nto legitimate and continued labor, but has a passion for making strikes\r\nand securing positions that afford liberal pay for little work.\r\n\r\nThinking a profession too monotonous and plodding, he never took the\r\ntrouble to acquire one. As to honest manual toil, that was an expedient\r\nhe never so much as dreamed of. In early life he was so unfortunate as\r\nto secure an appointment to a clerkship in the Assembly, and after that\r\nhe haunted the State Legislature for five or six winters in hot pursuit\r\nof another place, but his claims failing to be recognized, he relapsed\r\ninto the natural belief that his party was in league to proscribe him.\r\nAfter making a large number of political ventures of a more ambitious\r\norder, and with the same mortifying results, he abandoned that field and\r\ntook to speculation in patent rights. He vended a wonderful churn-dash,\r\ncirculated a marvellous flatiron, and expatiated through the country on\r\nthe latest improvement in the line of a washing machine. But these\r\noperations somehow afforded him but transient relief, and left him\r\nalways involved still more largely in debt. At different times in his\r\nlife he had also been a horse dealer, a dry-goods merchant, a saloon\r\nkeeper, the proprietor of a tenpin alley, and managed to grow poorer in\r\nall these various occupations. The last I saw of him he was reduced to\r\npeddling books in a small way, carrying his whole stock in a new market\r\nbasket. He was very importunate in his appeals to customers to purchase,\r\nputting it upon the ground that he had been unfortunate and had a claim\r\nto their charity. I happened to see him in the office of the popular\r\nhotel in Podgeville, when he was more than usually clamorous for\r\npatronage. He accosted nearly every man in the room with a dull,\r\nuninteresting volume in his hand, and for which he asked a respectable\r\nprice. At last he set down his basket, and commenced a kind of\r\nsnivelling harangue to his little audience. Mr. Algrieve opened by\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n     'Gentlemen, you'll pardon me for thrusting myself upon your\r\n     attention; but it is hard to have the world turned against ye, and\r\n     to work like a slave all your life to get something to fall back on\r\n     in old age, and then have to die poor at last! I hope none of you\r\n     have ever known what it is to be born unlucky; to never undertake\r\n     anything but turned out a failure, and to meet disappointment where\r\n     you deserved success. I am such a man!'\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Algrieve produced a fragmentary pocket handkerchief for the\r\nostensible purpose of absorbing an expected tear, but really to give his\r\nremark a tragic effect. He continued:\r\n\r\n     'Behold an individual who has been doomed to penury and\r\n     destitution, but who has not met his fate without a struggle. You\r\n     who have known me, gentlemen, for the last thirty years, know that\r\n     Jordan Algrieve has battled with life manfully.' At this point he\r\n     put out his clenched fist in defiance of his fancied enemy.' But I\r\n     have been compelled to yield to the force of circumstances--not,\r\n     however, till I had taken my chance in nearly every department of\r\n     honorary endeavor, and experienced the most wretched success. The\r\n     world has pronounced its ban upon me, and I must bow submissively\r\n     to its cruel imposition. I tried to serve my country in the\r\n     capacity of a public official, but my services and talents were\r\n     repeatedly rejected--the majority of voters always so necessary to\r\n     an honest election was forever on the side of my lucky opponent.\r\n     When I withdrew from the political field, impoverished by my\r\n     efforts to advance the prosperity of my party, I embarked in a\r\n     small commercial enterprise; but owing to the tightness of the\r\n     times, and my want of capital, I was soon obliged to give up and\r\n     throw myself upon the mercy of my creditors. I have tried popular\r\n     amusements, and lost money--that is, I failed to make it. I even\r\n     branched out into fancy speculations, but they only served to sink\r\n     me still deeper in the yawning depths of insolvency!'\r\n\r\nMr. Algrieve here paused, and seemed to look down into the frightful\r\ngulf with a shuddering expression, as if he were not quite accustomed to\r\nthe descent yet.\r\n\r\n     'In short, gentlemen, I am completely prostrated--I am floored! And\r\n     is the world willing to help me up? By no means! On the contrary,\r\n     when I commenced falling and slipping on the stairs of human\r\n     endeavor the world was ready to kick me down, down, till I reached\r\n     the--in short, gentlemen, till I became what I now am. Now, what\r\n     have I done, let me ask, that I should fare thus? Have I not made\r\n     an effort? I appeal to you, gentlemen, to say. [A voice from the\r\n     crowd here chimed in: 'Yes, Algrieve, your efforts to live without\r\n     work have been immense!'] But here I am, poor and persecuted; my\r\n     family are in want of some of the common necessaries of life; and\r\n     now, gentlemen, I beg some of you will buy that book (holding out a\r\n     copy of the 'Pilgrim's Progress'), and do something to avert for a\r\n     while, at least, the pauper's fate!'\r\n\r\nSome benevolent gentleman, either from a charitable motive, or to put an\r\nend to his lachrymose oration, bought the volume for $1.25. Mr. Algrieve\r\nreceived the money with many expressions of gratitude, and, gathering up\r\nhis stock, moped off into the drinking room, and invested a dime in a\r\ngin cocktail, and five cents in a cigar, with which he sought to solace\r\nhimself for all the inflictions of the inexorable world.\r\n\r\nThus Jordan Algrieve goes about telling of his reverses and misfortunes,\r\nexhibiting them to the public eye like a beggar his sores, without shame\r\nor remorse; seeking to levy contributions on his fellow men, as one who\r\nhas been robbed of his estate. Reader, will you say that you have never\r\nmet with Jordan Algrieve?\r\n\r\nAnother common species of the complaining bore are those who are\r\ncontinually parading their bodily infirmities. For example, a man will\r\ncall on you, apparently for the express purpose of illustrating a most\r\ninteresting case of neuralgia. He comes into your office, perhaps, with\r\nhis head tied up in a handkerchief, and an expression of face as if he\r\nhad some time winked one eye very close, and had never since been able\r\nto open it. Thinking himself an object worthy of study, he shows how the\r\ndarting pains vacillate between his eyes, invade his teeth, hold general\r\nmuster in his cheeks, take refuge in the back of his neck; and\r\ndemonstrates these points to you by applying his hands to the parts\r\ndesignated, and uttering cries of feigned anguish to give effect to his\r\ndescription. He informs you, as a piece of refreshing intelligence, that\r\nit is devilish hard to bear, and enough to make a saint indulge in\r\nprofanity. When he has proceeded thus far, he may be taken with one of\r\nhis capricious pains, ducks his head between his knees, squeezes it with\r\nhis hands, and bawls out: 'O-h! Je-ru-sa-lem!' with a duration of sound\r\nonly limited by the capacity of his wind. He feels that he has a witness\r\nto his sufferings, and wishes to make the most of it. When he gets\r\nsufficiently easy, he tells you his experience with various remedies,\r\nenumerates all the lotions, liniments, ointments, and other applications\r\nhe has used, with his opinion on the merits of each.\r\n\r\nAnother person will accost you on a bright day with a most saturnine and\r\nwo-begone visage, informing you that he is in a terrible way, that his\r\nfood distresses him, and he can't any longer take comfort in eating. He\r\nplaces his hand in the region of his stomach, remarks that he feels a\r\ngreat load there, and makes the usual complaints of a dyspeptic. He is\r\npathetic over the fact that his physician has denied him fried oysters\r\nand mince pie for evening lunch, and closes his observations by\r\nexclaiming in a moralizing vein that 'such is life!'\r\n\r\nA third individual has a throat disease, and, forgetful of his bad\r\nbreath, desires you to take a minute survey of his glottis, and inform\r\nhim of its appearance. Accordingly he opens his mouth and throws back\r\nhis head as if he were inviting you to an entertaining show.\r\n\r\nThese are but a tithe of the examples of people who exhibit in public\r\nand at social gatherings their ills and ailments, accompanied with\r\ndreary complainings of their bodily inflictions. It implies no\r\nindifference or lack of sympathy for physical pain and hardships to say\r\nthat its victims have no right to mar the enjoyment of others by the\r\nunnecessary display of their infirmities or present sufferings. If a man\r\nwill make a travelling show of his disorders, he should be obliged to\r\ncarry a hand organ to give variety to his stupid entertainment. Were\r\nthese fellows all compelled to furnish this accompaniment, what a\r\nmusical bedlam our streets would become! Of course, there is no law\r\nagainst complaining and repining--it may not be immoral--but it is a\r\nvery poor method of making those around us happy, which is a duty that\r\nnone but selfish natures can forget. A man who goes through life with a\r\nsmiling face and cheerful temper, despite the grievances common to us\r\nall, is a public benefactor in his way, as much as one who founds a\r\nlibrary or establishes an asylum.\r\n\r\nMisanthropy is a sublime egotism that mistakes its own distemper for a\r\ndisease of the universe. With all the mishaps to which our life is\r\nsubject, a glance over a wide range of human experience proves that God\r\nhelps those who help themselves, and whatever be the tenor of our\r\nfortune, levity is more seemly than moodiness, and under any\r\ncircumstances there is more virtue in being a clown than a cynic. But in\r\nadversity, a subdued cheerfulness and quiet humor are, next to Christian\r\nfortitude, the golden mean of feeling that makes the loss of worldly\r\nthings rest lightly on the heart, and spreads out before the hopeful eye\r\nthe vision of better days!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF THE BRAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  'How sleep the brave who sink to rest\r\n  By all their country's wishes blest!\r\n  When spring with dewy fingers cold\r\n  Returns to deck their hallowed mould,\r\n  She then shall dress a sweeter sod\r\n  Than fancy's feet have ever trod.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE ICE MAIDEN, AND OTHER TALES. By HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN.\r\n     Translated by FANNY FULLER. Philadelphia: F. Leypoldt. New York: C.\r\n     T. EVANS. 1863.\r\n\r\nProbably no writer of stories for the young ever equalled Hans Christian\r\nAndersen; certainly none ever succeeded as he has done in reproducing\r\nthe nameless charm of the real fairy tale which springs up without an\r\nauthor among the people,--the best specimens of which are the stories\r\ncollected by the Brothers Grimm in Germany. But this exquisite\r\nfascination of an inner life in animals and in inanimate objects, which\r\nevery child's mind produces from dolls and other puppets, and which\r\nmakes fairies of flowers, is by Andersen adroitly turned very often to\r\ngood moral and instructive purpose, without losing the original sweet\r\nand simple charm which blends the real and the imaginary. Here he\r\nsurpasses all other tale writers, nearly all of whom, in their efforts\r\nat simplicity in such narratives, generally become supremely silly.\r\n\r\nThe present volume contains four stories--'The Ice Maiden,' 'The\r\nButterfly,' 'The Psyche,' and 'The Snail and the Rose Tree,'--all in\r\nAndersen's usual happy and successful vein; for he is preëminently an\r\n_equal_ writer, and never falls behind himself. Perhaps the highest\r\ncompliment which can be paid them is the truthful assertion that any\r\nperson may read them with keen interest, and never reflect that they\r\nwere written for young people. Poetry and prose meet in them on equal\r\ngrounds, and any of them in verse would be charming. The main reason for\r\nthis is that such stories to charm must set forth natural objects with\r\nIrving-like fidelity; nay, the writer must, with a few words, bring\r\nbefore us scenes and things as in a mirror. In this 'The Ice Maiden'\r\nexcels; Swiss life is depicted as though we were listening to _yodle_\r\nsongs on the mountains, and felt the superstitions of the icy winter\r\nnights taking hold of our souls.\r\n\r\n'The Psyche' is an art-story. Most writers would have made it a legend\r\nof 'high' art, but it is far sweeter and more impressive from the sad\r\nsimplicity and gentleness with which it is here told. 'The Butterfly,'\r\non the contrary, is a delightful little burlesque on flirtations and\r\nfops; and 'The Snail and the Rose Tree' is much like it. Both are really\r\nfables of the highest order, or shrewd prose epigrams.\r\n\r\nThe volume before us is well translated; very well, notwithstanding one\r\nor two trifling inadvertencies, which, however, really testify to the\r\nfact that the best of all pens for such version--a lady's--was employed\r\nin the work. A _Skytte_, for instance, in Danish, or _Schutz_ in German,\r\nis generally termed among the fraternity of sportsmen a 'shot,' and not\r\na 'shooter.' But the spirit of the original is charmingly preserved, and\r\nMiss Fuller has the rare gift of using short and simple words, which are\r\nthe best in the world when one knows how to use them as she does. We\r\ntrust that we shall see many more stories of this kind, translated by\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWe must, in conclusion, say a word for the dainty binding (Pawson &\r\nNicholson), the exquisite paper and typography, and, finally, for the\r\npretty photograph vignette with which this volume is adorned. Mr.\r\nLeypoldt has benefited Philadelphia in many ways,--by his foreign and\r\nAmerican circulating library, his lecture room, and by his republication\r\nin photograph of first-class engravings,--and we now welcome him to the\r\nsociety of publishers. His first step in this direction is a most\r\npromising one.\r\n\r\n\r\n     NOTES, CRITICISMS, AND CORRESPONDENCE UPON SHAKSPEARE'S PLAYS AND\r\n     ACTORS. By JAMES HENRY HACKETT. New York: Carleton, 413 Broadway.\r\n     1863.\r\n\r\nThis work will be one of great interest, firstly to all those who visit\r\nthe theatre, secondly to readers of Shakspeare, and thirdly to all who\r\nrelish originality and naïvete of character, such as Mr. Hackett\r\ndisplays abundantly, from the rising of the curtain even to the going\r\ndown of the same, in his book. There are no men who live so much within\r\ntheir profession as actors, or are so earnest in their faith in it; and\r\nthis devotion is reflected unconsciously, but very entertainingly,\r\nthrough the whole volume. Shakspeare tells us that all the world is a\r\nstage--to the actor the stage is all his world, the only one in which he\r\ntruly lives.\r\n\r\nWe thank Mr. Hackett for giving us in this volume, firstly, very minute\r\nand excellent descriptions of all the eminent actors of Shakespeare\r\nwithin his memory--not a brief one, he having been himself a really\r\nexcellent and eminent actor since 1828. It is to be regretted that there\r\nare not more such judicious descriptions as these. The author has, as we\r\ngather from his book, been in the habit of recording his daily\r\nexperiences, and consequently writes from better data than those\r\nafforded by mere memory. The reader will also thank him for many\r\nagreeable minor reminiscences of celebrities, and for giving to the\r\npublic his extremely interesting correspondence on Shaksperean subjects\r\nwith John Quincy Adams and others. The views of the venerable statesman\r\non _Hamlet_, and on 'Misconceptions of Shakspeare on the Stage,'\r\nindicate a very great degree of study of the great poet, and of\r\nreflection on the manner in which he is over or under acted. Nor are Mr.\r\nHackett's own letters and criticisms by any means devoid of\r\nmerit--witness the following:\r\n\r\n     'Mr. Forrest recites the text (of King Lear) as though it were all\r\n     prose, and not occasionally written in poetic measure; whereas,\r\n     blank verse can, and always should, be distinguishable from prose\r\n     by proper modulations of the voice, which a listener with a nice\r\n     ear and a cultivated taste could not mistake, nor, if confounded,\r\n     detect in their respective recitals: else Milton as well as\r\n     Shakspeare has toiled to little purpose in the best-proportioned\r\n     numbers.'\r\n\r\nThe criticism on Forrest is throughout judicious, and, though frequently\r\nsevere, is still very kindly written when we consider the 'capacities'\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\nAs regards Mr. Hackett's views of readings, we detect in them a little\r\nof that tendency to excessive accentuation, and that disposition to\r\n'make a hit' or a sensation in every sentence which renders most, or\r\nall, Shaksperean or tragic acting so harsh and strained, and which has\r\nmade the word 'theatrical' in ordinary conversation synonymous with\r\n'unnatural.' Something of this is reflected in the enormous amount of\r\nneedless italicizing with which the typography of the book is afflicted,\r\nand which we trust will be amended in future editions. We cheerfully\r\npardon Mr. Hackett for sounding his own praises--sometimes rather loudly\r\nand frequently, as in the republication of a sketch of himself--since,\r\nafter all, we thereby gain a more accurate idea of a favorite actor, who\r\nhas for thirty-six years pleased the public, and gained in that long\r\ntime the character of a conscientious artist who has always striven to\r\nimprove himself.\r\n\r\nTo one thing, however, we decidedly object--the questionable taste\r\ndisplayed by the author in answering in type criticisms of his acting,\r\nand in republishing them in his work. We can well imagine the temptation\r\nto be great, but to yield to it is not creditable to a good artist. With\r\nthis little exception, we cordially commend the work to all readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     DEVOTIONAL POEMS. By R. T. CONRAD. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott &\r\n     Co. 1862.\r\n\r\nThe late Judge Conrad left a number of religious poems, which\r\nfortunately fell into the hands of those who appreciated their merit,\r\nand we now have them in volume, with an introductory poem to the widow\r\nof the deceased and a preface by George H. Boker, to whom the editing of\r\nthe present volume was committed. These lyrics, as we infer, were\r\nwritten in the spirit of private devotion, and are therefore gifted with\r\nthe greatest merit which can possibly inspire religious writing--we mean\r\ndeep sincerity. But apart from the _spirit_,--the _sine qua non_,--the\r\nbeauty of the form of these works will always give them a high value to\r\nthe impartial critic. They are far above the mediocrity into which most\r\nreligious writers always at first _appear_ to be lost, owing to the vast\r\namount of thoughts and expressions which they are compelled to share in\r\ncommon with others. And as there has been awakened within a few years a\r\nspirit of collecting and studying such poetry, we cordially commend this\r\nwork to all who share it.\r\n\r\nAs regards form, one of the more marked poems in this collection is\r\n'The Stricken;' we have room only for the beginning:\r\n\r\n    Heavy! Heavy! Oh, my heart\r\n      Seems a cavern deep and drear,\r\n    From whose dark recesses start,\r\n        Flatteringly like birds of night,\r\n      Throes of passion, thoughts of fear,\r\n        Screaming in their flight.\r\n      Wildly o'er the gloom they sweep,\r\n  Spreading a horror dim,--a woe that cannot weep!\r\n\r\n    Weary! Weary! What is life\r\n      But a spectre-crowded tomb?\r\n    Startled with unearthly strife,\r\n      Spirits fierce in conflict met,\r\n    In the lightning and the gloom,\r\n      The agony and sweat;\r\n    Passions wild and powers insane,\r\n  And thoughts with vulture beak, and quick Promethean pain.\r\n\r\nWe select this single specimen from its remarkable resemblance to\r\nAnglo-Saxon religious poetry,--by far the sincerest, and, so far as it\r\nwas ripened, the soundest, in our language. With the exception of the\r\nPromethean allusion, every line in these verses is singularly Saxon--the\r\nnight birds, screaming in gloom--as in the '_Sea Farer_,' where, instead\r\nof joyous mirth,\r\n\r\n  'Storms beat the stone cliffs,\r\n  Where them the starling answered,\r\n  Icy of wing.'\r\n\r\nThe divisions of this work are 'Sinai,' which is in great measure a\r\ncommentary on virtues and vices, 'Sonnets on the Lord's Prayer,' and\r\n'Bible Breathings.' Of these we would commend the Sonnets, as forming\r\ncollectively a highly finished and beautiful poem, complete in each\r\ndetail. The little poem, 'A Thought,' is as perfect as a mere simile in\r\nverse could be.\r\n\r\nRobert T. Conrad, who was born in Philadelphia in 1810, and died there\r\nin 1858, first became known to the public by a drama entitled _Conrad of\r\nNaples_, a subject which has been extensively treated by German writers,\r\nUhland himself having written a tragedy on it. After being admitted to\r\nthe bar, Conrad connected himself with the press, but resumed the\r\npractice of law in 1834 with success, being appointed judge of the\r\ncriminal sessions in 1838, and of the general sessions in 1840. He was\r\nsubsequently president of a well-known railroad company, and mayor of\r\nhis native city. During the intervals of his business he was at one time\r\neditor of _Graham's Magazine_, and acquired a literary reputation by his\r\narticles in the _North American_, and by the well-known tragedy of\r\n_Aylmere_, in which Mr. Forrest, the actor, has frequently appeared as\r\n'Jack Cade.' In addition to these, Mr. Conrad published, in 1852, a\r\nvolume entitled 'Aylmere and other poems,' which was very extensively\r\nreviewed. In it the 'Sonnets on the Lord's Prayer' first appeared.\r\n\r\nThe volume before us is very well edited in every respect, and makes its\r\nappearance in very beautiful 'externals.' The paper, binding, and\r\ntypography are, in French phrase, as applied to such matters,\r\n'luxurious.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     SKETCHES OF THE WAR: A Series of Letters to the North Moore Street\r\n     School of New York. By CHARLES C. NOTT, Captain in the Fifth Iowa\r\n     Cavalry. New York: Charles T. Evans, 448 Broadway. 1863.\r\n\r\nWere this little work ten times its present length, we should have read\r\nit to the end with the same interest which its perusal inspired, and\r\narrived, with the same regret that there was not more of it, at its last\r\npage. It is simple and unpretending, but as life-like and spirited as\r\nany collection of descriptive sketches which we can recall. We realize\r\nin it all the vexations of mud, all the horrors of blood, and all the\r\njoys of occasional chickens and a good night's rest, which render the\r\nsoldier's life at once so great and yet so much a matter of petty joys\r\nand sorrows. The love of the rider for the good horse--for his pet\r\nGypsy--her caprices and coquetries, are set forth, for instance, very\r\nfreely, without, however, a shadow of affectation, while in all his\r\ninterviews with men and women, the characters come before us 'like\r\nlife,' and give us a singularly accurate conception of the social\r\neffects of the war in the West. The appearance of the country is\r\nunconsciously detailed as accurately as in a photograph, and the events\r\nand sensations of battle are presented with great ability; in fact, we\r\nhave as yet seen no sketches from the war which in these particulars are\r\nequal to them. They are free from 'fine writing,' and are given in\r\nsimple, intelligible language which cannot fail to make them generally\r\npopular. The occasional flashes of humorous description are extremely\r\nwell given--so well that we only wish there had been more of them, as\r\nthe author has evidently a talent in that direction, which we trust will\r\nbe more fully developed in other works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all the outcry that has been raised at the slow progress of the\r\nwar, it is difficult for a comprehensive mind to conceive how, on the\r\nwhole, the struggle with the South could have advanced more favorably to\r\nthe _general interests_ and future prosperity of the whole country, than\r\nit has thus far done. 'Had the Administration been possessed of\r\nsufficient energy, it could have crushed the rebellion in the first\r\nmonth,' say the grumblers. Very possibly--to break out again! No amount\r\nof prompt action could have calmed the first fire and fury of the South.\r\nIt required _blood_; it was starving for war; it was running over with\r\nhatred for the North.\r\n\r\nThe war went on, and, as it progressed, it became evident that, while\r\nthousands deprecated agitation of the slave question as untimely, the\r\nwar could never end until that question was disposed of. And it also\r\nbecame every day more plain that the 'little arrangement' so frequently\r\ninsisted on, and expressed in the words, 'Conquer the enemy _first_, and\r\n_then_ free the slaves,' was a little absurdity. It was 'all very\r\npretty,' but with the whole North and South at swords-points over this\r\nas the alleged cause of war--with all Europe declaring that the North\r\nhad no intention of removing the cause of the war--with the slave\r\nconstantly interfering in all our military movements--and, finally, with\r\na party of domestic traitors springing up everywhere, at home and in the\r\narmy itself, it became high time to adopt a fixed policy. It _was_\r\nadopted, and President LINCOLN, to his lasting honor, and despite\r\ntremendous opposition, issued the Proclamation of January First--the\r\nnoblest document in history.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to see how, when, or in what manner slavery would have\r\ndisappeared from a single State, had the war been sooner ended; and\r\nnothing is more certain than that any early victory or temporary\r\ncompromise would have simply postponed the struggle, to be settled with\r\ncompound interest. But another benefit has resulted and is resulting\r\nfrom the experience of the past two years. Our own Free States have\r\nabounded with men who are at heart traitors; men who have, by their\r\nignorance of the great principles of national welfare involved in this\r\nwar, acted as a continual drawback on our progress. This body of men,\r\nincapable of comprehending the great principles of republicanism as laid\r\ndown in the Constitution, and as urged by Washington, would be after all\r\nonly partially vanquished should we subdue the rebels. They are around\r\nus here in our own homes; their treason rings from the halls of national\r\nlegislation; they are busy night and day in their 'copperhead' councils\r\nin giving aid and comfort to the enemy, and in poisoning the minds of\r\nthe ignorant, by hissing slanders at the President and his advisers as\r\nbeing devoid of energy and ability.\r\n\r\nIt would avail us little could we conclude a peace to-morrow, if these\r\naiders and abetters of treason--these foes of all enlightened\r\nmeasures--these worse than open rebels--were to remain among us to\r\ndestroy by their selfishness and malignity those great measures by which\r\nthis country is destined to become great. The war is doing us the\r\nglorious service of bringing the 'copperheads' before the people in\r\ntheir true light--the light of foes to equality, to the rights of the\r\nmany, and as perverse friends of all that is anti-American. Who and\r\n_what_, indeed, are their leaders! Review them all, from FERNANDO WOOD\r\ndown to the wretched SAULSBURY, including W. B. REED, in whose veins\r\nhereditary traitorous blood seems, with every descent, to have acquired\r\na fresh taint--consider the character which has for years attached to\r\nmost of them--and then reflect on what a party must be with such\r\nleaders!\r\n\r\nThese men have no desire to be brought distinctly before the public;\r\nthey would by far prefer to burrow in silence. But the war and\r\nemancipation have proved an Ithuriel's spear to touch the toad and make\r\nhim spring up in his full and naturally fiendish form. The sooner and\r\nthe more distinctly he is seen, the better will it be for the country.\r\nWe must dispose of rebels abroad and copperheads at home ere we can have\r\npeace, and the sooner the country knows its foes, the better will it be\r\nfor it. We have come at last to either carrying out the great\r\ncentralizing system of an Union, superior to all States Rights, as\r\ncommended by Washington, or to division into a thousand petty\r\nprincipalities, each ruled by its WOOD, or other demagogue, who can\r\nsucceed in securing a majority-mob of adherents!\r\n\r\nIt is with such men and their measures that Gen. GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN,\r\nthe frequently proposed candidate for the next presidency, is becoming\r\nfirmly connected in the minds of the people! Fortunately the war has\r\ndeveloped the objects of the traitors, and the Union Leagues which are\r\nspringing up by hundreds over the country are doing good service in\r\nmaking them thoroughly known. Until treason is fairly rooted out at home\r\nand abroad, and until _Union at the centre for the people everywhere_ is\r\nfully enforced, this war can only be concluded now, to be renewed\r\nin tenfold horror to-morrow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a complication of interests at present springing up in Europe,\r\nwhich is difficult to fathom. Just now it seems as if the Polish\r\ninsurrection were being fomented by Austria, at French instigation, in\r\norder that the hands of Russia may be tied, so that in case of war with\r\nAmerica, we may be deprived of the aid of our great European friend.\r\nEngland sees it in this light, and angrily protests against Prussian\r\ninterference in the matter. Should a general war result, who would gain\r\nby it? Would France avail herself of the opportunity to array her forces\r\nagainst Prussia, and seize the Rhine, and perhaps Belgium? Or would the\r\nEmperor avail himself of circumstances to embroil England in a war, and\r\nthen withdraw to a position of profitable neutrality? Let it be borne in\r\nmind, meantime, that it required all the strength of France, England,\r\nand Austria, combined, to beat Russia in the Crimea, and that a short\r\nprolongation of the war would have witnessed the arrival of vast bodies\r\nof Russian troops--many of whom had been nearly a year on the march.\r\nThose troops are now far more accessible in case of war.\r\n\r\nA war between England and the United States, however it might injure us,\r\nwould be utter ruin to our adversary. With our commerce destroyed, we\r\nshould still have a vast territory left; but nine tenths of England's\r\nprosperity lies within her wooden walls, which would be swept from the\r\nocean. With her exportation destroyed, England would be ruined. We\r\nshould suffer, unquestionably, but we could hold our own, and would\r\nundoubtedly progress as regards manufacturing. But what would become of\r\nthe British workshops, and how would the British people endure such\r\nsuffering as never yet befell them? Even with our Southern Rebellion on\r\nour hands, and English men-of-war on our coast, we could still, with our\r\nmerchant marine, bring John Bull to his face. And John Bull knows it.\r\n\r\nEngland is now building, in the cause of slavery and for the South, a\r\ngreat fleet of iron-clad pirate vessels, which are intended to prey on\r\nour commerce. How long will it be before retaliation on England begins,\r\nand, _when_ it begins, how will it end? Ay--_how_ will it end? It is not\r\nto be supposed that we can long be blinded by such a flimsy humbug as a\r\ntransfer to Southern possession of these vessels 'for the Chinese\r\ntrade!' Are the English mad, demented, or besotted, that they suppose we\r\nintend to endure such deliberate aid of our enemies? When those vessels\r\n'for the Chinese' are afloat, and our merchants begin to suffer, let\r\nEngland beware! We are not a people to stop and reason nicely on legal\r\npoints, when they are enforced in the form of fire and death. Better for\r\nEngland that she weighed the iron of that fleet pound for pound with\r\ngold, and cast it into the sea, than that she suffered it to be\r\nlaunched. _Qui facit per alium, facit per se._ England is the _real_\r\ncriminal in this business, for her Government could have _prevented_ it;\r\nand to her we shall look for the responsibility. All through America a\r\nspirit of fierce indignation has been awakened at hearing of this\r\n'Chinese' fleet, which will burst out ere long in a storm. We are very\r\nfar from being afraid of war--we are in it; we know what it is like--and\r\nthose who openly, brazenly, infamously, aid our enemies and make war for\r\nthem, shall also learn, let it cost what it may.\r\n\r\nEngland hopes to cover the world's oceans with pirates, with murder,\r\nrapine, and robbery--to exaggerate still more the horrors of war--and\r\nyet deems that her commerce will escape! This is a different matter from\r\nthe affair of the Trent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDon't grumble! Don't be incessantly croaking from morning to night at\r\nthe war and the administration and the generals, and everything else!\r\nThings have gone better on the whole than you imagine, and your endless\r\ngrowling is just what the traitors like. Were there no croakers there\r\nwould be no traitors.\r\n\r\nIt was growling and croaking which caused the reverses of the army of\r\nthe Potomac--sheer grumbling. Now the truth is coming out, and we are\r\nbeginning to see the disadvantages of eternal fault-finding. The truth\r\nis that the war in the Crimea was much worse conducted than this of ours\r\nhas been--even as regards swindling by contracts--and it was so with\r\nevery other war. We have no monopoly of faults.\r\n\r\nNow that the war is being reorganized, we would modestly suggest that a\r\nlittle severity--say an occasional halter--would not be out of place as\r\nregards deserters. There has been altogether too much of this amusement\r\nin vogue, which a few capital punishments in the beginning would have\r\nentirely obviated. Pennsylvania, we are told, is full of hulking runaway\r\nyoung farmers, and our cities abound in ex-rowdies, who, after securing\r\ntheir bounties, have deserted, and who are now aiding treason, and\r\nspreading 'verdigrease' in every direction by their falsehoods. Let\r\nevery exertion be made to arrest and return these scamps--cost what it\r\nmay; and let their punishment be exemplary. And let there be a new\r\npolicy inaugurated with the new levy, which shall effectually prevent\r\nall further escaping.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReader--wherever you are, either join a Union League, or get one up. If\r\nthere be none in your town, gather a few friends together--and mind that\r\nthey be good, loyal Unionists, without a suspicion of verdigrease or\r\ncopperhead poison about them--and at once put yourselves in connection\r\nwith the central Leagues of the great cities. Those of Philadelphia, New\r\nYork and Boston are all conducted by honorable men of the highest\r\ncharacter--and we may remark, by the way, that in this respect the\r\ncontrast between the leaders of the League and of the Verdigrease Clubs\r\nis indeed remarkable. When you have formed your League, see that\r\naddresses are delivered there frequently, that patriotic documents and\r\nnewspapers are collected there, and finally that it does good service in\r\nevery way in forwarding the war, and in promoting the determination to\r\npreserve the Union.\r\n\r\nThe copperheads aim not only at letting the South go--they hope to break\r\nthe North to fragments, and trust that in the general crash each of them\r\nmay secure his share. When the war first broke out, FERNANDO WOOD\r\npublicly recommended the secession of New York as a free city--and a\r\nvery free city it would have been under the rule of Fernando the First!\r\nAnd this object of 'dissolution and of division' is still cherished in\r\nsecret among the true leaders of the traitors.\r\n\r\nThe time has come when every true American should go to work in earnest\r\nto strengthen the Union and destroy treason, whether in the field or at\r\nhome. A foe to liberty and to human rights is a foe, whether he be a\r\nfellow countryman or not, and against such foes it is the duty of every\r\ngood citizen to declare himself openly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the annexed that our Art correspondent, a gentleman\r\nof wide experiences, has gone into the battle. We trust that his\r\nexperiences will amuse the reader. As for the _facts_--never mind!\r\n\r\n                                                    CAMP O'BELLOW,\r\n                                            _Army of the Potomac_.\r\n\r\nMY PATRIOTIC FRIEND AND EDITOR:\r\n\r\nI have changed my base.\r\n\r\nWhen I last wrote you, it was from the field of art--this time it is\r\nfrom the floor of my tent--at least it will be, as soon as my fellows\r\npitch it. N. B.--For special information I would add that this is not\r\ndone, as I have seen a Kalmouk do it, with a bucket of pitch and a rag\r\non a stick. One way, however, of pitching tents is to pitch 'em down\r\nwhen the enemy is coming, and run like the juice. Ha, ha!\r\n\r\nBut I must not laugh too loudly, as yon small soldier may hear me.\r\nLittle pitchers have long ears.\r\n\r\nNow for my sufferings.\r\n\r\nThe first is my stove.\r\n\r\nMy stove is made of a camp kettle.\r\n\r\nIt has such a vile draught that I think of giving it a lesson in\r\ndrawing. _Joke._ Perhaps you remember it of old in the jolly old Studio\r\nBuilding in Tenth Street. By the way how is WHITTREDGE?--I believe _he_\r\nimported that joke from Rome where he learned it of JULES DE MONTALANT\r\nwho acquired it of CHAPMAN who got it from GIBSON, who learned it of\r\nTHORWALDSEN who picked it up from DAVID who stole it from the elder\r\nVERNET to whom it had come down from MICHAEL ANGELO who cribbed it from\r\nALBERT DÜRER who sucked it somehow from GIOTTO.\r\n\r\nI wish you could see that stove. I cook in it and on it and all around\r\nthe sides and underneath it. I wash my clothes in it, make punch in it,\r\nwrite on it, when cold sit on it, play poker on it, and occasionally use\r\nit for a trunk. It also gives music, for though it don't draw, it can\r\nsing.\r\n\r\nMy second friend is my Iron Bride--the sword. She is a useful creeter.\r\nLittle did I think, when you, my beloved friends, presented me with that\r\ndeadly brand, how useful she would prove in getting at the brandy, when\r\nI should have occasion to 'decap' a bottle. She kills pigs, cuts cheese,\r\ntoasts pork, slices lemons, stirs coffee, licks the horses, scares\r\nSecesh, and cuts lead pencils. In a word, if I wished to give useful\r\nadvice to a cavalry officer, it would be not to go to war without a\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nA revolver is also extremely utilitarious. A _large_ revolver, mind you,\r\nwith _six corks_. Mine contains red and black pepper, salt, vinegar,\r\noil, and ketchup--when I'm in a hurry. A curious circumstance once\r\n'transpired,' as the missionaries say, in relation to this article of\r\nthe _quizzeen_. All the barrels were loaded--which I had forgotten--and\r\nso proceeded to give it an extra charge of groceries. * * *\r\n\r\nIt was a deadly fray. _Rang tang bang, paoufff!_ We fought as if it had\r\nbeen a Sixth Ward election. Suddingly I found myself amid a swarm of my\r\ncountry's foes. Sabres slashed at me, and in my rage I determined to\r\nexterminate something. Looking around from mere force of habit to see\r\nthat there were no police about, I drew my revolver and aimed at JIM\r\nMARRYGOLD of Charleston, whom I had last seen owling it in New Orleans,\r\nfour years ago. He and DICK MIDDLETONGUE of Natchez (who carved the\r\nButcher's Daughter at Florence, and who is now a Secesh major), came\r\ndown with their cheese knives, evidently intending to carve _me_. Such\r\nlanguage you never heard, such a diluvium of profanity, such\r\ndouble-shotted d--ns! I drew my pistol _at once_, and gave Dick a\r\nblizzard. The ball went through his ear--the red pepper took his eyes,\r\nwhile Jim received the shot in his hat, and with it the sweet oil. In\r\nthis sweet state of affairs, CHARLEY RUFFEM of Savannah was descending\r\non me with his sabre. (He was the man who said my browns were all put in\r\nwith guano.) I put him out of the way of criticism with a _third_\r\nbarrel--killed him _dead_, and _salted_ him.\r\n\r\nThe best of this war is, it enables me to exterminate so many _bad\r\nartists_.\r\n\r\nThe worst of it is that Charley owed me five dollars.\r\n\r\nA fifth Secesh now made his appearance. We went it on the sword, and\r\nfought--for further particulars see Ivanhoe, volume second. My foe was\r\nRAWLEY CHIVERS, of Tuscumbia, Ala., and as the mischief would have it,\r\nhe knew all my guards and cuts. We used to fence together, and had had\r\nmore than one trial at _'fertig-los!'_ on the old _Pauk-boden_ in\r\nHeidelberg.\r\n\r\n'POP!' said he on the seventeenth round, 'are we going to chop all day?'\r\n\r\n'CHIV,' said I, as I drew my castor, '_are you ready_?'\r\n\r\n'Ready,' quoth he, effecting the same manoeuvre--'_one_, _two_,\r\n_three_.'\r\n\r\nI scratched his cheek, but the mustard settled him.\r\nSputter--p'l'z'z'z--how he swore! I went at him with both hands.\r\n\r\n'_Priz?_' I cried.\r\n\r\n'Priz it is,' he answered.\r\n\r\nSo I took him off as a priz. He was very glad to go too, for he hadn't\r\nhad a dinner for six weeks, and would have made a fine study for a\r\nMurillo beggar so ar as rags went.\r\n\r\nI punish my men whenever I catch them foraging. Punish them by\r\nconfiscation. Mild as I am by nature, I never allow them to keep stolen\r\nprovisions--when I am hungry.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening I detected a vast German private with a colossal\r\nbull-turkey.\r\n\r\n'Lay it down _there_, sir!' I exclaimed fiercely--indicating the floor\r\nof my tent as the bank of deposit.\r\n\r\n'But den when I leafs it you eats de toorky up!' he exclaimed in\r\nsorrowful remonstrance.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I replied, like a Roman. 'Yes--I may _eat_ it--but,' I added in\r\ntones of high moral conscientiousness, 'remember that I didn't STEAL\r\nit!'\r\n\r\nHe went forth abashed.\r\n\r\nNo more till it is eaten, from\r\n\r\n  Yours truly,\r\n\r\n  POPPY OYLE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a Philadelphia correspondent for the following:\r\n\r\n  Alas! that noble thoughts so oft\r\n  Are born to live but for an hour,\r\n  Then sleep in slumber of the soul\r\n  As droops at night the passion flower,\r\n  Their morn is like a summer sun\r\n  With splendor dawning on the day--\r\n  Their eve beholds that glory gone,\r\n  And light with splendor fled away.\r\n\r\n  J. W. L.\r\n\r\nTrue indeed. The difference between the great mind and the small is\r\nafter all that the former can _retain_ its 'noble thoughts,' while with\r\nthe latter they are evanescent. And it is the glory of Art that it\r\nrevives such feelings, and keeps early impressions alive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFROM THE GERMAN OF HEINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  My love, in our light boat riding,\r\n    We sat at the close of day;\r\n  And still through the night went gliding,\r\n    Afar on our watery way.\r\n\r\n  The Spirit Isle, soft glowing,\r\n    Lay dimmering 'neath moon and star;\r\n  There music was softly flowing,\r\n    And cloud dances waved afar:\r\n\r\n  And ever more sweetly pealing,\r\n    And waving more winningly;\r\n  But past it our boat went stealing,\r\n    All sad on the wide, wide sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere is an\r\n\r\nADVENTURE WITH A GRIZZLY BEAR,\r\n\r\nfrom a Philadelphia correspondent:\r\n\r\n     'We had gone out one morning, while camping upon the river San\r\n     Joaquin, to indulge in the sport of fowling. There were three of\r\n     us, and we possessed two skiffs, but an accident had reduced our\r\n     sculls to a single pair, which my companion used to propel one of\r\n     the boats down the stream, after securing the other, with me as its\r\n     occupant, in the midst of a thicket of tule, where I awaited in\r\n     ambush the flying flocks. As geese and ducks abounded, and nearly\r\n     all of my shots told, in a few hours I had killed plenty of game;\r\n     but becoming weary, as the intervals lengthened between the flights\r\n     of the birds, I sat down, and had already begun to nod dozingly,\r\n     when a startling splash, near the river bank, instantly aroused me.\r\n     Grasping my gun and springing upright, I looked in the direction\r\n     whence the sound had come; but, owing to the intervening mass of\r\n     tule, could not see what kind of animal--for such I at once\r\n     conjectured it must be--had occasioned my sudden surprise. Having\r\n     hitherto seen no domestic stock hereabouts, I therefore felt fully\r\n     satisfied that it could not belong to a tame species. Judging from\r\n     the noise of its still continued movements, it was of no small\r\n     bulk; and, if its ferocity were correspondent with its apparent\r\n     size, this was indeed a beast to be dreaded.\r\n\r\n     'The thought at once occurred to me that, as I possessed neither\r\n     oars nor other means of propulsion, it would be difficult to move\r\n     the boat from its mooring if chance or acuteness of scent should\r\n     lead the creature to my place of concealment. In short, this, with\r\n     various suggestions of fancy, some of them ludicrously exaggerated,\r\n     speedily made me apprehensive of imminent danger. Nor was my\r\n     suspicion unfounded, for a crisis was at hand.\r\n\r\n     'There was a space of clear water between the river bank and the\r\n     margin of the tule, in which the brute seemed to disport a few\r\n     moments; and then the rustling of the reeds indicated that it was\r\n     about to advance. With heavy footfalls it came toward me; as it\r\n     approached my nervousness increased; I could not mistake that\r\n     significant tread; undoubtedly it was a grizzly bear. But how could\r\n     I escape? Bruin, though his progress was not unimpeded, was surely\r\n     drawing near. Following my first impulse in this pressing\r\n     emergency, I placed myself forward in the boat, and, seizing a\r\n     handful of green blades on either side of it, endeavored, by\r\n     violently pulling upon them, to force the craft through the thick\r\n     growth which surrounded it. The headway of the skiff was slow, but\r\n     my efforts were not silent. In fact, the commotion occasioned by my\r\n     own panic became, to my hearing, so confounded with the sound made\r\n     by my floundering pursuer that my excited imagination multiplied\r\n     the single supposed bear, and the water seemed to be dashed about\r\n     by several formidable 'grizzlies.'\r\n\r\n     'You smile, gentlemen, but really I was so impressed with this and\r\n     like extravagant creations of fear that my better judgment was\r\n     temporarily suspended. This deception, however, was only of\r\n     momentary duration.\r\n\r\n     'Suddenly the skiff encountered some obstacle and remained\r\n     immovable. Quickly clutching my gun and firing it aimlessly, I\r\n     sprang overboard, and, with extraordinary energy, made for the\r\n     other side of the river and safety.\r\n\r\n     'My remembrance of that hazardous crossing even now fills me with a\r\n     sympathetic thrill. The river, near where I had leaped in, varied\r\n     in depth from my middle to my neck, and the snaky stalks of tule\r\n     clung to me, retarding my retreat like faithful allies of the\r\n     enemy. An area of this plant extended to the channel, a distance of\r\n     some fifty yards, where a clear current rendered swimming feasible;\r\n     and this I essayed to reach, urged onward by terror, and regardless\r\n     of ordinary obstructions. So vigorous was my action that,\r\n     notwithstanding the frequent reversals of my head and 'head's\r\n     antipodes' as I tripped over reeds and roots, perhaps I should have\r\n     reached the 'point proposed' with only a loss equivalent to the\r\n     proverbial 'year's growth,' had not a hidden snag unluckily lain in\r\n     the way, which 'by hook or by crook' fastened itself in the part of\r\n     my trowsers exactly corresponding, when dry, with that 'broad disk\r\n     of drab' finally seen, after much anxiety, by the curious Geoffrey\r\n     Crayon between the parted coat-skirts of a certain mysterious\r\n     'Stout Gentleman,' and inextricably held me in check despite my\r\n     frantic struggles.\r\n\r\n     'Imagine my feelings while thus entangled by a bond of enduring\r\n     material, a bait for a fierce brute which eagerly pressed forward\r\n     to snap at me. Believe me, boys, this was _not_ the happiest moment\r\n     of my life. I knew no reason why I should resignedly submit to so\r\n     undistinguished a fate. My knife, however, was in the boat, so that\r\n     my release could only be attained by extreme exertion. Accordingly\r\n     I writhed and jerked with my 'best violence,' all the time\r\n     denouncing the whole race of bears, from 'Noah's pets' down; and\r\n     you may be sure, emphatically expressing not a very exalted opinion\r\n     of snags.\r\n\r\n     'Ah! how that brief period of horrible _suspense_ appeared to\r\n     stretch out almost to the crack of doom. I roared lustily for help,\r\n     but no aid came. The bear continued its course through the thicket;\r\n     in another instant I might be seized.\r\n\r\n     'Rather than suffer such a 'taking off' as this, which now seemed\r\n     inevitable, I should have welcomed as an easy death any method of\r\n     exit from life that I might hitherto have deprecated. Incited then\r\n     by the proximity of the beast, which so intensified the horror of\r\n     my situation, to a last desperate effort to avert this much dreaded\r\n     fate; and, concentrating nearly a superhuman strength upon one\r\n     impetuous bound, the _stubborn fabric burst_, and--joy possessed my\r\n     soul!\r\n\r\n     'Even greater than my recent misery was the ecstasy which succeeded\r\n     my liberation. The happy sense of relief imparted to me such a\r\n     feeling of buoyancy that I was enabled to extricate myself from\r\n     this 'slough of despond,' and I soon reached the swift current,\r\n     when a few strokes landed me in security on a jutting bar.\r\n\r\n     'Without unnecessary delay I sought out my comrades, to whom I told\r\n     the story of my escape. Their response was a hearty laugh, and\r\n     certain equivocal words which might imply doubt--not as to my\r\n     fright, for that was too plain--but concerning the identity of the\r\n     'grizzly.' I observed, however, that, as they rowed nearer to the\r\n     scene of my disaster, their display of levity lessened; and as we\r\n     came within sight of the suspicious locality, there was not the\r\n     'ghost of a joke' on board; but, on the contrary, thay both charged\r\n     me to 'keep a bright look out,' as well as to 'see that the arms\r\n     were all right,' thus showing a remarkable diminution of their\r\n     previous incredulity.\r\n\r\n     'While cautiously exploring the vicinity of my memorable flight, we\r\n     saw the bear in the distance, upon a piece of rising ground. It\r\n     moved off with a lumbering shuffle and probably a contented\r\n     stomach, for, on searching for my scattered game, we found but\r\n     little of it left besides sundry fragments and many feathers.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the old times people received queer names, and plenty of them. On\r\nLong Island a Mr. Crabb named a child\r\n'Through-much-tribulation-we-enter-into-the-kingdom-of-heaven Crabb.'\r\nThe child went by the name of _Tribby_. Scores of such names could be\r\ncited. The practice of giving long and curious names is not yet out of\r\ndate. In Saybrook, Conn., is a family by the name of Beman, whose\r\nchildren are successively named as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Jonathan Hubbard Lubbard Lambard Hunk Dan Dunk Peter Jacobus Lackany\r\nChristian Beman.\r\n\r\n2. Prince Frederick Henry Jacob Zacheus Christian Beman.\r\n\r\n3.

There is a vagueness of mind and a senile bewilderment manifested\r\nin this poem, which is indeed remarkable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne fine day, some time ago, SAVIN and PIDGEON were walking down Fifth\r\navenue to their offices.\r\n\r\nA funeral was starting from No. --. On the door plate was the word\r\nIRVING.\r\n\r\n'Such is life,' said Savin. 'All that is mortal of the great essayist is\r\nbeing borne to the grave: in fact, the cold and silent tomb.'\r\n\r\nA tear came to Pidgeon's eye. Pidgeon has an enthusiastic veneration for\r\ngenius. He adores literary talent.\r\n\r\n'Savin,' said he, 'there is a seat vacant in this carriage. I will enter\r\nit, and pay my last tribute of respect to the illustrious departed. But\r\nI thought he had a place up the river.'\r\n\r\n'This was his town house,' said Savin. 'How I should like to join with\r\nyou in your thoughtful remembrance, and in your somewhat unceleritous\r\njourney to the churchyard! But, no, the case of Blackbridge _vs._\r\nBridgeblack will be called at twelve, and I have no time to lose.'\r\n\r\nPidgeon entered the carriage. There was a large man on the seat, but\r\nPigeon found room beside him. The carriage slowly moved off. Pidgeon put\r\nhis handkerchief to his eyes; the large man coughed and took a chew of\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nPresently said Pidgeon:\r\n\r\n'We are following to the grave the remains of a splendid writer.'\r\n\r\n'Uncommon,' said the large man. 'Sech a man with a pen _I_ never\r\nsee--ekalled by few, and excelled by none; copperplate wasn't nowhere.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed,' replied Pidgeon, 'I wasn't aware his chirography was so\r\nunusually elegant; but his books were magnificent, weren't they? So\r\nequable, too, and without that bold speculation that we too often meet\r\nwith, nowadays.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, you may well say so,' returned the large man. 'He always kept them\r\nhimself; had 'em sent up to his house whenever he was sick, likeways;\r\nbut he wasn't without his bold speculations neither. Look at that there\r\noperation of his into figs, last year.'\r\n\r\n'Figs!'\r\n\r\n'Figs, yes; and there was dates into the same cargo.'\r\n\r\n'Dates! figs! My good friend, do you mean to say that the great\r\nWashington Irving speculated in groceries?'\r\n\r\n'Lord, no, not that _I_ know of. This here is Josh Irving, whose\r\nremains'--\r\n\r\nPidgeon opened the carriage door, and, being agile, got out without\r\nstopping the procession. Arriving at his office, where the boy was\r\ndiligently occupied in sticking red wafers over the velvet of his desk\r\nlid, he took down 'Sugden on Vendors,' to ascertain if there was any\r\nlegal remedy for the manner in which he had been sold, and at the latest\r\ndates had unsuccessfully travelled nearly half through that very\r\nentertaining volume.\r\n\r\nTHERE is no time to be lost.

The manly, good, old-fashioned Democrats, at\r\nleast, are above this, and are rapidly dividing from the copperheads.\r\nThe Philadelphia _Evening Bulletin_, a staunch patriotic journal, says:\r\n\r\n'The sooner that the fact is made clear that the mass of the Democrats,\r\nas well as of all other parties, are loyal and opposed to the infamous\r\nteachings of Vallandigham, Biddle, Reed, Ingersoll, Wood, and their\r\ncompeers, the sooner will the war be brought to an end and the Union be\r\nrestored.'\r\n\r\nShow your colors.

Will the reader permit us to\r\ncall attention to the following notice of the work from the Philadelphia\r\n_Evening Bulletin_:\r\n\r\n     'A beautiful volume, entitled _Sunshine in Thought_, by Charles\r\n     Godfrey Leland, has just been published by Charles T. Evans. No\r\n     work from Mr. Leland's pen has afforded us so much pleasure, and we\r\n     recommend it to all who want and relish bright, refreshing,\r\n     cheering reading. It consists of a number of essays, the main idea\r\n     of which is to inculcate joyousness in thought and feeling, in\r\n     opposition to the sickly, sentimental seriousness which is so much\r\n     affected in literature and in society. That a volume based on this\r\n     one idea should be filled with reading that is never tiresome, is a\r\n     proof of great cleverness. But Mr. Leland's varied learning, and\r\n     his extensive acquaintance with foreign as well as English\r\n     literature, combine with his native talent to qualify him for such\r\n     a work. He has done nothing so well, not even his admirable\r\n     translation of Heine's _Reisebilder_. He is thoroughly imbued with\r\n     the spirit of his motto, '_Hilariter_,' and in expressing his\r\n     bright thoughts, he has been peculiarly felicitous in style.\r\n     Nothing of his that we have read shows so much elegance and polish.\r\n     Every chapter in the book is delightful, but we especially enjoyed\r\n     that on 'Tannhæuser,' with the fine translation and subsequent\r\n     elucidation of the famous legend.' But the boldest and most\r\n     original chapter is the concluding one, with its strange\r\n     speculations on 'The Musical After-Life of the Soul,' and the\r\n     after-death experience of 'Dione' and 'Bel-er-oph-on,' which the\r\n     author characterizes in the conclusion as 'an idle, fantastic,\r\n     foolish dream.' So it may be, but it is as vividly told as any\r\n     dream of the Opium-Eater or the Hasheesh-Eater. Mr. Leland is to be\r\n     congratulated on his _Sunshine in Thought_. It is a book that will\r\n     be enjoyed by every reader of culture, and its effect will be good\r\n     wherever it is read.'\r\n\r\nThe aim proposed in this work is one of great interest at the present\r\ntime, or, as the Philadelphia _North American_ declares, 'is a great and\r\nnoble one'--'to aid in fully developing the glorious problem of freeing\r\nlabor from every drawback, and of constantly raising it and intellect in\r\nthe social scale.' 'Mr. LELAND believes that one of the most powerful\r\nlevers for raising labor to its true position in the estimation of the\r\nworld, is the encouragement of cheerfulness and joyousness in every\r\nphase of literature and of practical life.' 'The work is one long,\r\nglowing sermon, the text of which is the example of Jesus Christ.'\r\n\r\n  E. K.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUST-HEAD WHISKEY.\r\n\r\nFor two days the quiet of the Rising Sun Tavern, in the quaint little\r\ntown of Shearsville, Ohio, was disturbed by a drunken Democratic member\r\nof the Pennsylvania Legislature, who visited the town in order to\r\naddress what he hoped would turn out to be the assembled multitude of\r\ncopperheads, but which proved after all no great snakes!\r\n\r\nFor two days this worthless vagabond insulted travellers stopping at the\r\ntavern, until at last the landlord's wife, a woman of some intelligence,\r\ndetermined to have her revenge, since no man on the premises had pluck\r\nenough to give the sot the thrashing he so well merited.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, after a very severe night's carouse on bust-head\r\nwhiskey, the Pennsylvanian appeared at the breakfast table, looking\r\nsadly the worse for wear, and having an awful headache. The landlady\r\nhaving previously removed the only looking glass in the tavern--one\r\nhanging in the barroom--said to the beast as he sat down to table:\r\n\r\n'Poor man! oh, what _is_ the matter with your face? It is terribly\r\nswollen, and your whole head too. Can't I do something for you? send for\r\nthe doctor, or'--\r\n\r\nThe legislator, who was in a state of half-besottedness, listened with\r\nsharp ears to this remark, but believing the landlady was only making\r\nfun of him, interrupted her with--\r\n\r\n'There ain't nothin' the matter with my head. I'm all right; only a\r\nlittle headache what don't 'mount to nothing.'\r\n\r\nBut a man who sat opposite to him at table, and who had his clue from\r\nthe landlady, said with an alarmed look--\r\n\r\n'I say, mister, I don't know it's any of my business, but I'll be hanged\r\nfor a horse thief, if your head ain't swelled up twicet its nat'ral\r\nsize. You'd better do something for it, I'm thinking.'\r\n\r\nThe drunken legislator! (Legislator, _n._ One who makes laws for a\r\nstate: vide dictionary) believing at last that his face must in fact be\r\nswollen, since several other travellers, who were in the plot, also\r\nspoke to him of his shocking appearance, got up from the table and went\r\nout to the barroom to consult the looking glass, such luxuries not being\r\nplaced in the chambers. But there was no glass there. After some time he\r\nfound the landlady, and she told him that the barroom glass was broken,\r\nbut she could lend him a small one; which she at once gave him.\r\n\r\nThe poor sot, with trembling hand, held it in front of his face, and\r\nlooked in.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said he, 'if that ain't a swelled head I hope I may never be a\r\nsenator! or sell my vote again at Harrisburg.'\r\n\r\n'Poor man!' exclaimed the bystanders.\r\n\r\n'Fellers,' said the legislator, 'wot d'ye think I'd better do?' Here he\r\ngave another hard look in the glass. 'I ought to be back in Harrisburg\r\nright off, but I cant go with a head like that onto me. Nobody'd give me\r\nten cents to vote for 'em with such a head as that. It's a'--\r\n\r\n'Big thing,' interrupted a bystander.\r\n\r\n'Fellers,' said the blackguard, 'I'll kill a feller any day of the week,\r\nwith old rye, if he'll only tell er feller how to cure this head of\r\nmine.'\r\n\r\n'Have it shaved, sir, by all means,' spoke the landlady: 'shaved at\r\nonce, and then a mild fly blister will draw out the inflammation, and\r\nthe swelling will go down. Don't you think so, doctor?'\r\n\r\nThe doctor thus addressed was a cow doctor, but, accustomed to attending\r\nbrutes, his advice was worth something in the present case; so he also\r\nrecommended shaving and blistering.\r\n\r\n'I'll go git the barber right off the reel, sha'n't I?' asked the\r\ndoctor, to which the legislator assenting, it chanced that in fifteen\r\nminutes his head was as bald as a billiard ball, and in a few more was\r\ncovered with a good-sized fly blister.\r\n\r\n'Ouch--good woman--how it hurts!' he cried. But that was only the\r\nbeginning of it.\r\n\r\n'Ee-ea-ah!' he roared, as it grew hotter and hotter. One might have\r\nheard him a mile. The neighbors did hear it, and rushed in. The joke was\r\n'contaminated' round among them, and they enjoyed it. He had disgusted\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\n'Golly! what a big head!' cried a bystander.\r\n\r\nThe legislator took another look at the glass. They held it about a yard\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n'It's gittin' smaller, ain't it?' he groaned.\r\n\r\n'Yes, it's wiltin',' said the landlady. 'Now go to bed.'\r\n\r\nHe went, and on rising departed. Whether he ever became an honest man is\r\nnot known, but the legend says he has from that day avoided 'bust-head\r\nwhiskey.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDon't you _see_ it, reader? The landlady had shown him his face in a\r\nconvex mirror--one of those old-fashioned things, which may occasionally\r\nbe found in country taverns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWAR-WAIFS.\r\n\r\nThe chronicles of war in all ages show us that this internecine strife\r\ninto which we of the North have been driven by those who will eventually\r\nrue the necessity, is by no manner of means the first in which brother\r\nhas literally been pitted against brother in the deadly 'tug of war.'\r\nThe fiercest conflict of the kind, however, which we can at present call\r\nup from the memory of past readings, was one in which THEODEBERT, king\r\nof Austria, took the field against his own brother, THIERRI, king of\r\nBurgundy. Historians tell us that, so close was the hand-to-hand\r\nfighting in this battle, slain soldiers did not fall until the _mélée_\r\nwas over, but were borne to and fro in an upright position amid the\r\nserried ranks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough many and many of England's greatest battles have been won for\r\nher by her Irish soldiers, it is not always that the latter can be\r\ndepended upon by her. With the Celt, above all men, 'blood is thicker\r\nthan water;' and, although he is very handy at breaking the head of\r\nanother Celt with a blackthorn 'alpeen,' in a free faction fight, he\r\nobjects to making assaults upon his fellow countrymen with the 'pomp and\r\ncircumstance of war.' A striking instance of this occurred during the\r\nIrish rebellion of 1798. The 5th Royal Irish Light Dragoons refused to\r\ncharge upon a body of the rebels when the word was given. Not a man or\r\nhorse stirred from the ranks. Here was a difficult card to play, now,\r\nfor the authorities, because it would have been inconvenient to try the\r\nwhole regiment by court martial, and the soldiers were quite too\r\nvaluable to be mowed down _en masse_. The only course left was to\r\ndisband the regiment, which was done. The disaffected men were\r\ndistributed into regiments serving in India and other remote colonies,\r\nand the officers, none of whom, we believe, were involved in the mutiny,\r\nwere provided for in various quarters. The circumstance was commemorated\r\nin a curious way. It was ordered that the 5th Royal Irish Light Dragoons\r\nshould be erased from the records of the army list, in which a blank\r\nbetween the 4th and 6th Dragoons should remain forever, as a memorial of\r\ndisgrace. For upward of half a century this gap remained in the army\r\nlist, as anybody may see by referring to any number of that publication\r\nof half-a-dozen years back. The regiment was revived during, or just\r\nafter, the Crimean war, and the numbers in the army list are once more\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL MONTHLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe readers of the CONTINENTAL are aware of the important position it\r\nhas assumed, of the influence which it exerts, and of the brilliant\r\narray of political and literary talent of the highest order which\r\nsupports it. No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the latter is\r\nabundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection of its\r\ncounsels in many important public events, and in the character and power\r\nof those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThough but little more than a year has elapsed since the CONTINENTAL was\r\nfirst established, it has during that time acquired a strength and a\r\npolitical significance elevating it to a position far above that\r\npreviously occupied by any publication of the kind in America. In proof\r\nof which assertion we call attention, to the following facts:\r\n\r\n1. Of its POLITICAL articles republished in pamphlet form, a single one\r\nhas had, thus far, a circulation of _one hundred and six thousand_\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\n2. From its LITERARY department, a single serial novel, \"Among the\r\nPines,\" has, within a very few months, sold nearly _thirty-five\r\nthousand_ copies. Two other series of its literary articles have also\r\nbeen republished in book form, while the first portion of a third is\r\nalready in press.\r\n\r\nNo more conclusive facts need be alleged to prove the excellence of the\r\ncontributions to the CONTINENTAL, or their _extraordinary popularity_;\r\nand its conductors are determined that it shall not fall behind.\r\nPreserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a thousand\r\njournals have attributed to it, it will greatly enlarge its circle of\r\naction, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle involved in\r\nthe great questions of the day. The first minds of the country,\r\nembracing the men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are among its contributors; and it is no mere\r\n\"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say that this \"magazine for the\r\ntimes\" will employ the first intellect in America, under auspices which\r\nno publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the great\r\nquestions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal: much the\r\nlarger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore, by\r\ntales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be found,\r\nunder its new staff of Editors, occupying, a position and presenting\r\nattractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n  Two copies for one year,         Five dollars.\r\n\r\n  Three copies for one year,       Six dollars.\r\n\r\n  Six copies for one year,         Eleven dollars.\r\n\r\n  Eleven copies for one year,      Twenty dollars.\r\n\r\n  Twenty copies for one year,      Thirty-six dollars.\r\n\r\n  PAID IN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n  _Postage, Thirty-six cents a year_, TO BE PAID BY THE SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\n  SINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\n  Three dollars a year, IN ADVANCE. _Postage paid by the Publisher._\r\n\r\n\r\n  JOHN F.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (it distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 50 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 85,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorghum, Grapes, Peaches, Apples. &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. DAIRY FARMING also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\n_The experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\nthe Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to the\r\nperfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young children,\r\ncan turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in the growth\r\nand perfection of this plant._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio, As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n80 acres at $10 per acre with interest at 6 per ct. annually on the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment               $48.00\r\n  Payment in one year         48.00\r\n     \"    in two years        48.00\r\n     \"    in three years      48.00\r\n     \"    in four years      236.00\r\n     \"    in five years      224.00\r\n     \"    in six years       212.00\r\n     \"    in seven years     200.00\r\n\r\n  40 acres, at $10.00 per acre:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment               $24.00\r\n  Payment in one year         24.00\r\n     \"     in two years       24.00\r\n     \"     in three years     24.00\r\n     \"     in four years     118.00\r\n     \"     in five years     112.00\r\n     \"     in six years      106.00\r\n     \"     in seven years    100.00\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber 17.\r\n\r\n25 Cents.\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL\r\n\r\nMONTHLY.\r\n\r\nDEVOTED TO\r\n\r\nLiterature and National Policy.\r\n\r\nMAY, 1863.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK:\r\n  JOHN F.
