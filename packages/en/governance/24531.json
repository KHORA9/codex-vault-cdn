The men who use it are doubtless well aware of the\r\nprodigious power of such cries adroitly raised. The history of their\r\ninfluence over the unreflecting masses in all ages would be one of the\r\nmost curious chapters in the history of human nature.\r\n\r\nThe phrase has a grand air. Its words are brave words to conjure with.\r\nIt is susceptible of a good and loyal sense. It may mean, restore the\r\nsupremacy of the Constitution and the integrity of the Union by crushing\r\nthis atrocious rebellion to utter extinction by force of arms. It may\r\nmean that all the revolted States are to be brought back into the Union\r\nand under the authority of the Constitution by military subjugation. It\r\n_may_ mean this, though it is certainly not a short or strong way of\r\nexpressing the only thing which patriotic men have now to think of, to\r\nwish done, and to help do; and I do not believe any man of strong, clear\r\nhead or right loyal heart would take this way of expressing it. Still,\r\nit may mean this; but if it does not mean this, it means nothing\r\npertinent to exigency, nothing patriotic, nothing loyal.\r\n\r\nBut is this what they mean who trade with it now? No--nothing of the\r\nsort. They use it to distract and perplex the public mind; to draw it\r\noff from the one paramount obligation which the times impose upon the\r\nnation--the obligation of saving the national existence by the military\r\nextinction of the rebellion, regardless of all other ends and aims. They\r\ntrade upon the popular reverence for the Constitution--that sense of its\r\nsacredness which lies so deep in the heart of the North. They do it to\r\nmislead the honest masses, whose hearts are mainly right, but whose\r\nheads--some of them, but, thank God! not many now--are not so clear to\r\nsee the miserable fallacy of its application. They make it a text and\r\npretext for inveighing against the government, and so weakening its hold\r\non the popular confidence and support; for raising seditious outcries\r\nagainst any restriction of the license to talk and print treason--what\r\nthey call tyrannical oppression of the freedom of speech and of the\r\npress. They know perfectly well that not a thousandth part of the\r\ntoleration which traitorous talking and printing enjoy at the\r\nNorth--through the extraordinary and amazing leniency of the\r\nGovernment--is for one moment granted to Union sympathizers by rebel\r\nauthorities in the South. They never have a word to say against the way\r\nin which loyalty to the Union is there crushed down by imprisonment,\r\nbanishment, confiscation, and hanging. They have never a word to say\r\nagainst the brutal and fiendish atrocities of cruelty perpetrated there\r\nupon all who are even suspected of Union sentiments. They reserve all\r\ntheir indignation for the moderate repression which our Administration\r\nhas seen fit, in some cases, to apply to traitorous utterances. They\r\nhave even risen to the sublime impudence of denouncing it as a monstrous\r\noutrage on the constitutional rights of Northern traitors, that our\r\nGovernment has declined, in a few instances, to allow the United States\r\nmail to be the agent for transporting and circulating treasonable\r\nnewspapers. I have quite lately been edified with the tone of lofty,\r\nindignant scorn with which one of these papers--published in the city of\r\nNew-York--cries shame on the Government for refusing to be its carrier;\r\nthough no man knows better than the editor that a publication at the\r\nSouth as much in sympathy with the Union as his is with the rebellion,\r\nwould not only not get carried in the rebel mails, but, before\r\ntwenty-four hours, would be suppressed, and its editor in prison, or\r\nmore probably hung, by the direction or with the approbation of the\r\nrebel authorities; and in such a case, our New-York editor would not\r\nhave space for a line to chronicle the fact, or for a word to denounce\r\nit to Northern indignation. But for our Government to decline carrying\r\nhis treasonable sheet--that is monstrous! Behold him, a confessor in the\r\nsacred cause of freedom of speech and of the press! _He_ will not\r\nsuccumb to unconstitutional tyranny! He will continue to print in spite\r\nof Government, and to send his treason through the land by the express\r\ncompanies, until the millennial day of the restoration of 'the\r\nConstitution _as it is_, the Union _as it was_!'\r\n\r\nThe men who utter this phrase talk, too, about the constitutional rights\r\nof the rebels--just as if those who are waging war for the overthrow of\r\nthe Constitution had any rights under it! Such talk is an outrage on\r\ncommon-sense and decency. What constitutional rights have rebels in arms\r\nto any thing, but to be fairly tried for treason, to the forfeiture of\r\ntheir lives, if they escape merited death on the battle-field?\r\n\r\nThese out-criers for the Constitution and the Union strive also to\r\nconfuse the public mind with constitutional questions as to the end or\r\npurpose of the war. What has the Constitution to do with that? What\r\nconstitutional object is there for the nation or the Government to have\r\nnow in view? This, and this only: the extinction of the rebellion by\r\nforce of arms. Conventions, negotiations, concessions to rebels in\r\narms--even if they were in arms for rights under the Constitution--would\r\nbe utterly unconstitutional; much more are they so when the rebels are\r\nin arms not to vindicate constitutional rights, but for the overthrow of\r\nthe Constitution, the destruction of the Government, and the\r\ndismemberment of the nation. They must lay down their arms in\r\nunconditional submission before they can be constitutionally treated\r\nwith. Any other doctrine would be subversive of the Constitution, of the\r\nprinciples that lie at its basis, of the principles of all government,\r\nall national existence, and all social order.\r\n\r\nThe Government may be driven, by the victorious pressure of rebel arms,\r\nto the overwhelming necessity of treating with them. Necessity has no\r\nlaws. But until then, to talk of treating with armed rebels is as\r\ntreasonable as it is absurd. Until then, there is no other object\r\nallowed by the Constitution, no other obligation imposed by it on the\r\nGovernment, but the military subjugation of the rebellion. The\r\nConstitution gives the Government this power, and no other--puts upon it\r\nthis duty, and no other.\r\n\r\nAnd as to constitutional modes of conducting the war: are the men who\r\nraise questions, and suggest scruples, so stupid as not to know that, so\r\nfar as the rebels are concerned, such a way of talking is the sheerest\r\nof all possible absurdities? The war power is a power conferred by the\r\nConstitution; but it is a power which, in face of an enemy, is above all\r\nother constitutional powers. In granting the war power to Government,\r\nthe Constitution grants to it, without qualification or limitation, all\r\nthe powers necessary and proper to carry on war; this, of course, even\r\nif there were no plain delegation of them. But there is; and the only\r\nlaws which limit the constitutional powers of Government in the conduct\r\nof the war, are the laws of war. These laws lie outside of the\r\nConstitution, in the consent and recognition of civilized nations. They\r\nare now the supreme laws. All this, for the sufficient reason that the\r\nconstitutional grant of the war power under any other limitation than\r\nthe laws of war, would be idle and nugatory; and this for the sufficient\r\nreason that the salvation of the republic is that to which every thing\r\nelse must be sacrificed. The constitutional guaranties of State and\r\npersonal rights were framed for a condition of union, order, peace--not\r\nfor one of secession, rebellion, and war. In such a time, they must all\r\ngive way to the supreme necessity of saving the national existence.\r\nConstitution or no Constitution, the nation must not be destroyed. Who\r\nbut a fool would question the right of a man to strike a dagger to the\r\nheart of the assassin whose grasp was on his throat, because there is a\r\nlaw against the private use of deadly weapons? The clutch of a\r\nparricidal rebellion is grappling at the national existence, and what\r\nshall we think of those men who would stay the arm of Government from\r\nstabbing at its vitals by interposing constitutional scruples? Even if\r\nthe Constitution did stand in the way, who but a fool or a traitor would\r\nhesitate to go around it or over it to save the national existence?\r\n_Salus reipublicæ suprema lex._ Was the nation made for the\r\nConstitution, or the Constitution for the nation? If both can not stand\r\ntogether, which shall go down? Will you stick to the Constitution, and\r\nlet the nation be destroyed? Any thing more insanely preposterous than\r\nsuch a putting of the wrong thing foremost, such a preference of the\r\nmeans to the end, is hard to be imagined.\r\n\r\nBut the Constitution does not stand in the way. Neither in letter nor in\r\nspirit does it interpose a feather's resistance to the most summary and\r\neffectual extinction of the rebellion. On the contrary, it justifies the\r\nuse of all the means sanctioned by the laws of war. It justifies, and,\r\nif need be, demands, the receiving, employing, and arming of all the\r\nloyal inhabitants of the South held in slavery under local laws, whether\r\nby rebel or by loyal masters. What the former might think or say, need\r\nnot be asked or cared for; and the latter can not, in loyalty, object to\r\nthe taking of their slaves for the defence of the nation, if military\r\nreasons make it needful or wise to do it. _If employed, these slaves\r\nmust be freed_, and their masters must receive compensation at the hands\r\nof Government. To this, if their loyalty be any thing but an empty name,\r\nthey will consent. If the extinction of slavery should be the ultimate\r\nresult, what then? Is slavery so sacred and beneficent, that a\r\ntriumphant rebellion and a dismembered country are to be preferred to\r\nits extinction? The loyal people of the North--the great body of the\r\nnation--are getting tired of that conditional Unionism, that Border\r\nState loyalty, which makes a paramount regard to the interests of\r\nslavery the price of adhering to the national cause. Conditional\r\nUnionism--what sort of Unionism is that? Loyalty with a price--what is\r\nsuch loyalty worth? The very terms imply threats, and involve the\r\nassertion of the very principle of secession itself. To treat with it,\r\nto concede to it, is to admit the principle. It has already cost the\r\ncountry too dearly to be longer endured. Six hundred millions of dollars\r\nand a hundred thousand lives vainly sacrificed to the foolish policy,\r\nare enough. It helps the cause of rebellion, it paralyzes the arm of\r\nGovernment. The people have become sternly impatient of it. The sooner\r\nPresident Lincoln, in his quality of Commander-in-Chief, understands\r\nthis, and makes the Border State Unionists understand that every thing\r\nmust give way to the necessity of putting an end to the rebellion\r\nforthwith by the employment of all the means which God and nature have\r\nput in our power, the better it will be for him, the better for the\r\nnation, and the better for the Border States themselves, if they are\r\nwise. I think that when firmly told there must be an end to this\r\nconditional Unionism, this loyalty with a price, those States will have\r\nthe wisdom to see on which side their real interests lie. But, at all\r\nevents, the question should be settled. Better they should go over to\r\nthe rebels at once, than prevent the extinction of the rebellion through\r\ntheir conditional Unionism.\r\n\r\nBut it is with Northern out-criers for the Constitution and the Union\r\nthat the present inquiry is chiefly concerned. These men want the Union\r\n'as it was.' What _was_ it? What was it, in the _only_ thing that is in\r\ntheir thoughts and wishes when they raise the cry? It was a Union\r\ncontrolled by the South through alliance with a Northern party styling\r\nitself Democratic. It was the whole power of the Federal Government\r\nwielded for the aggrandizement of slavery, its extension and perpetual\r\nmaintenance as an element of political domination. This is what the\r\nUnion _was_. This is what these Democrats want again--in order that they\r\nmay again enjoy such a share (never an equal one) in the honors and\r\nemoluments of office as their oligarchic masters may allow them. This is\r\nall they think of or desire when they cry for the Union as it was--a\r\nchance for loaves and fishes again at the hands of those who for thirty\r\nyears have used them and despised them. They want to be used and\r\ndespised again. Hence, though they talk about putting an end to the\r\nrebellion, they want it put an end to only in such a way as shall secure\r\nthe restoration of the slave power to its old position, and of\r\nthemselves to their old relations with it. This would set them up in\r\ntheir business again. They are out of business now.\r\n\r\nHence, while Governor Stanly, in North-Carolina, is telling the people\r\nthere that the rebellion must be crushed though it involve the\r\ndestruction 'of every Southern institution,' and that the maintenance of\r\nthe supremacy of the National Government and the integrity of the\r\nnational domain is worth more than all the lives and all the property of\r\nrebels of whatever sort; and while Andrew Johnson is declaring the same\r\nthing in Tennessee, these Northern traitors are speaking tenderly of the\r\nrebellion as an 'irregular opposition'--excited and almost justified by\r\nNorthern aggressions on Southern rights--which ought to be so met on our\r\npart as not to preclude the South from a return to its ancient\r\ndomination. They insist that the struggle shall be conducted with the\r\nleast possible 'irritation' of rebel feelings and with a sacred regard\r\nto their slave rights. They bewail the enormities perpetrated by\r\nCongress and the President against the rebels, the abolition of slavery\r\nin the District of Columbia, the receiving and feeding of fugitive\r\nslaves, the employment of negroes as Government teamsters, the repeal in\r\nthe Senate of the law prohibiting free negroes to carry the mail, the\r\nlegalizing of the testimony of blacks, the attempt 'to create an\r\nAbolition party in the Border States' by the offer of compensation to\r\nthe owners in such States as may adopt the policy of emancipation, and\r\nlastly, the Confiscation Act, which takes away the property of rebels\r\nand sets free their slaves. These things they denounce in the bitterest\r\nterms--some of them as 'wounding to the sensibilities of the South,' and\r\nsome of them as atrocious outrages on the rights of the rebels,\r\ncalculated to drive them to such 'desperation' that they will never\r\nconsent, on any entreaty of their Northern friends, to accept their old\r\nposition of political control in the 'Union as it was.'\r\n\r\nSome of these men talk, indeed, of putting down the rebellion by the\r\nstrong arm; but they talk a great deal more of putting down\r\nAbolitionism--which with them means not only hostility to slavery, but\r\neven the disposition to acquiesce in the military necessity of its\r\nextinction. They sometimes go to the length of talking of 'hanging the\r\nsecessionists;' but then, you will observe, they always talk of hanging\r\nthe 'Abolitionists' along with them. They want them to dangle at the\r\nother end of the same rope. It is easy, however, to perceive that the\r\nhanging of the secessionists is not the emphatic thing--with many not\r\neven the real thing, but only an ebullition of vexation at them for\r\nhaving spoiled the old Democratic trade--a figurative hanging--often,\r\nindeed, only a rhetorical tub thrown out prudentially to the popular\r\nwhale, who might not be quite content to hear them talk of hanging only\r\non one side: but the hanging of the Abolitionists, there is no mistaking\r\ntheir feelings about that; there is a hearty smack of malignant relish\r\non their lips when they speak of it.\r\n\r\nThese men are as foolish as they are traitorous in their cry for the\r\nUnion as it was. The Union 'as it was' is a thing that never can be\r\nagain. They say the South wants nothing but guarantee for the security\r\nof its constitutional slave rights--if that had been given they would\r\nnever have taken up arms; give them that and they will lay them down.\r\nNothing more false. Just before the secession of South-Carolina, Pryor\r\ntelegraphed from Washington: 'We can get the Crittenden Compromise, but\r\nwe don't want it.' 'No matter what compromise the North offers,' said\r\nMason, 'the South must find a way to defeat it.' These are facts\r\nundeniable and undenied. They demonstrate the falsehood and folly of the\r\nmen who talk of bringing the rebels back into the Union by concessions.\r\nThe South did not want guarantees; it wanted separation. It determined\r\nto set up an independent slave empire, and no concession you can make\r\nwill lead them to abandon their determination. Undo the recent\r\nlegislation of Congress, reëstablish slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia, and repeal the prohibition of slavery in the Territories, and\r\nyou make the Union 'as it was,' so far as the North is concerned; but\r\nwill that bring back the South? No. Go still further, and make the Union\r\n_more_ than 'it was' for them; yield them the principle of the Lemmon\r\nCase, and so allow them to call the roll of their slaves under the\r\nshadow of Bunker Hill, and to convert New-York Battery into a slave-mart\r\nfor the convenience of slave-breeding Virginia and the slave-buying Gulf\r\nStates; and will these concessions lead the rebels to lay down their\r\narms and return into the Union? No. They will never lay down their arms\r\nuntil they are conquered by overwhelming military force. They will never\r\nbe in the Union until subjugated. And I think the rebellion will never\r\nbe extinguished without extinguishing slavery. Then, and not before,\r\nwill the conditions begin to exist of lasting peace and true union\r\nbetween the South and the North. Then, and not before, will there be\r\ngenuine prosperity, a true social order, and a decent civilization in\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nAnd since 'the Union _as it was_' is a thing that never can be again, it\r\nis not worth while to concern ourselves overmuch about 'the Constitution\r\nas _it is_,' so far as those who raise the outcry for it have any\r\ndeterminate meaning in their cry. For here, too, the reëstablishment of\r\nthe political power of slavery is the only point in their view.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution--in its great substance, in its essential principles,\r\nin the general frame of government it establishes, in its organization\r\nof powers, in its main provisions, and in most of its details--is an\r\ninstrument which probably few wise and patriotic Americans would care to\r\nsee altered, and none would wish to see subverted. But the constitutions\r\nof all governments, written or unwritten, (and each sort has its special\r\nadvantages and disadvantages,) are more or less subject to change--must\r\nchange and should change--with the progress of society. The\r\nConstitution of the United States provides for its own amendment by the\r\npeople by whom and for whom it was framed. Many amendments have already\r\nbeen made; more are likely in time to be found needful. And no one but a\r\nfool will swear blindly by 'the Constitution as it is,' if he is thereby\r\nto be precluded from voting for such improvements as time and\r\ncircumstances may make important and desirable.\r\n\r\nBut these traitorous traders in the phrase have (as before said) but one\r\nsingle point in view. In the whole compass of the Constitution their\r\ndevotion embraces nothing in their vows for its unchangeable sacredness\r\nexcept its recognition of slavery, its provisions for the rendition of\r\nfugitive slaves, and for counting five Southern chattels as three white\r\ncitizens in the basis for Federal representation. These are provisions\r\nthat must not be changed. This is what they mean, and all they mean,\r\nwhen they shout for 'the Constitution as it is.' So sacred is the\r\nConstitution in this one sole respect, that they have rung every change\r\nof protest--from solemn remonstrance to frantic howls of wrath--against\r\nthe recent law for taking from rebels the slaves that dig trenches and\r\ngrow food for them while they are fighting for the overthrow of the\r\nConstitution. And the only vision of a Constitution '_as it is_' which\r\nlooms up to their views and wishes in the future--'the Mecca of their\r\nhearts' fond dream'--is the overthrow of this legislation, and the\r\nreinstatement of slaveholders in their old rights fortified and extended\r\nby Supreme Court decisions carrying slavery and their slave laws into\r\nall the Territories, with the right of transit and sale for slaves in\r\nall the free States.\r\n\r\nBut most wise men believe that in the end of the war there is not likely\r\nto be much slavery to need constitutional protection. And since our\r\nnation at its very birth solemnly proclaimed the doctrine that of right\r\n'all men are born free and equal' as before the law, and have an equal\r\nright 'to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,' perhaps these\r\nDemocrats may be willing to let these provisions in behalf of slavery be\r\ndropped out of the Constitution when they shall have become no longer\r\nany thing but a dead letter--with no power of political victory and\r\nreward in them. As a living contradiction to the Declaration of\r\nIndependence they have been the source of all our woes. It is not\r\nnecessary to blame the framers of our Constitution for introducing them.\r\nThey did it for the best, as they thought. They themselves hoped and\r\nbelieved the necessity for such provisions would long before this time\r\ncease to exist. They little dreamed what mighty mischiefs, what long\r\ncontentions, what bitterness, what crimes, what bloody horrors they were\r\nentailing on their descendants. They little dreamed what a terrible\r\n_Nemesis_ would so soon avenge the expedient and temporary introduction\r\n(as they thought) of a contradiction to the principles of liberty into\r\nthe organic law of a free nation whose first foundations they themselves\r\nhad laid in the solemn proclamation of man's inalienable rights.\r\n\r\nIs it too much to hope that, by and by, when there shall (as God grant)\r\nno longer be any slavery to need protection, these Democrats will be\r\nwilling that this contradiction should be removed, by making a slight\r\nalteration in 'the Constitution _as it is_'? Let us trust they will. It\r\nis true the Democratic party for twenty years has had but one single\r\nprinciple. Its whole life, activity, object, and occupation has centred\r\nand turned on the one sole point of upholding slavery, echoing its\r\ndoctrines, asserting its rights, obeying its behests, extending its\r\narea, and aggrandizing its power; and so thoroughly imbued with the\r\nspirit of their Southern masters became the members of the party, that\r\nin ten years past I have found but few men calling themselves Democrats\r\nand acting with the party who were not in mind and heart, in principle\r\nand feeling, pro-slavery men! Pro-slavery Democrats! Four-cornered\r\ntriangles! Square circles! So the sense of contradiction always struck\r\nme. Yet for most of them I could not feel any thing of that intense\r\nscorn with which John Randolph of Roanoke more than thirty years ago\r\nbranded the Northern 'doughface' in Congress, when pointing his skinny\r\nfinger at his sneaking victim, he exclaimed: 'Mr. Speaker, I envy\r\nneither the head nor the heart of the Northern man who rises here to\r\ndefend slavery on principle.' I remembered the prodigiously demoralizing\r\neffect of slavery on the moral sense and sentiments. I remembered that\r\nthe present generation of Democrats have been subjected to the influence\r\nof Southern masters who long ago out-grew and renounced the sentiments\r\nprevalent in the early days of John Randolph: and I have been charitable\r\nin most cases (not in all) to their inability to see the contradiction\r\nbetween the ideas of _Democracy_ and _Pro-Slaveryism_. Let us hope for\r\nbetter things in time to come. With their bondage, their love of bondage\r\nwill go. It has been passing from the hearts of the great, honest masses\r\nof them ever since _Saint Sumter's Day_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACCARONI AND CANVAS.\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA ROMAN VETTURA.\r\n\r\nIf a man's mind and purse were in such state that he didn't care where\r\nhe went, and was able to go there; if the weather was fine, and the\r\naforesaid man could eat, drink, and sleep rough, and really loved\r\npicturesqueness in all his surroundings for its own sake--that man\r\nshould travel by _vettura_. Not one of the _vetture_ advertised by a\r\nRoman 'to go to all parts of the world;' not one of those traveling\r\ncarriages with a seat for milady's maid and milord's man, with courier\r\nbeside the driver and a vettura dog on top of the baggage, at the very\r\nsight of which, beggars spring from the ground as if by magic, and the\r\ncustomhouse officers assume airs of state. No, no, NO! What is meant by\r\na _vettura_ is a broken-down carriage, seats inside for four English or\r\nsix Italians, a seat outside along with the driver for one American or\r\nthree Italians, and places to hold on to, for two or three more,\r\nItalians. The harness of the horses consists of an originally leather\r\nharness, with rope commentaries, string emendations, twine notes, and\r\nragged explanations of the primary work; in plain English, it's an\r\nedition of harness with nearly all the original leather expurgated.\r\n\r\nWell, you enter into agreement with the compeller of horses, alias\r\n_vetturino_, to go to a certain town a certain distance from Rome. The\r\nvehicle he drives is popularly reported to leave regularly for that\r\ntown; you know that regularly means regularly-uncertainly. You go and\r\nsee the _vetturino_, say in that classic spot, the piazza Pollajuólo;\r\nyou find him, after endless inquiries, in a short jacket, in a\r\nwine-shop, smoking a throat-scorcher of a short pipe, and you arrange\r\nwith him as regards the fare, for he has different prices for different\r\npeople. Little children and soldiers pay half-price, as you will read on\r\nyour railroad ticket to Frascati, and priests pay what they please,\r\nforeigners all that can be squeezed out of them, and Italians at fixed\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nAs for the horses that drag this _vettura_. _Ola!_ I hope the crows will\r\nspare them one day longer. The long-suffering traveler pauses here,\r\nreader, wipes the dust from his brow, and exclaims:\r\n\r\n'Blessed be bull-fights; for they use up that class of horses which in\r\npious America drag oysters to their graves, and in papal Italy drag the\r\nnatives to their lairs outside of Rome!'\r\n\r\nYou will toil along the dusty plain--hot, weary, worn-out--but anon you\r\nbegin the ascent of the mountains; then, as you go up, the air grows\r\npurer and cooler. You descend from the _vettura_, and on foot tramp up\r\nthe road, perhaps beside the driver, who is innately thankful to you for\r\nsaving his horses a heavy pull; and with him, or a fellow-traveler, joke\r\noff the weary feeling you had in the low grounds. Again you are\r\nascending a still steeper part of the mountain. Now oxen are attached to\r\nthe old rumbling rattle-trap of a carriage, and it is _creak_, pull,\r\nyell, and cheer, until you find yourself above the clouds--serene and\r\ncalm--away from dust, heat, turmoil, bustle, in an old _locanda_, in a\r\nshaded room, a flask of cool red wine before you, the south wind\r\nrustling the leaves in the lattice, the bell of the old Franciscan\r\nconvent sending its clear silver notes away over valley and mountain\r\nfrom its sleepy old home under the chestnut trees, the crowing of cocks\r\naway down the mountain, the hum of bees in the flower-garden under the\r\nwindow--the blessed, holy calm of the country!\r\n\r\nIt is the end aimed at that makes _vettura_-traveling jolly, for it can\r\nwell be imagined, as an Englishman justly said of it: 'It is just as\r\ngood a vehicle to go to the gallows in, as any I've ever been in, I am\r\nsure.' But it is equally certain that the quiet joys revealed to the man\r\nwho travels by it--always be it understood, the man who don't care where\r\nhe goes or when he gets there--are many. These quiet joys consist of\r\nexquisite paintings, sketches, scenes, landscapes, or whatever else you\r\nchoose to call them, wherein shrines, _asterias_ or taverns, _locandas_\r\nor inns; costumes; shadow of grand old trees; the old Roman stone\r\nsarcophagus turned into a water-trough, into which falls the fountain,\r\nand where the tired horses thrust their dusty muzzles, drawing up water\r\nwith a rattling noise, while the south wind plays through the trees, and\r\nthey switch the flies from their flanks with their tails; the old\r\npriest, accosted by the three small boys--'they are asking his\r\nblessing,' said Miss Hicks--'they are asking him for a pinch of snuff,'\r\nsaid Caper--and when she saw him produce his snuff-box, she acquiesced;\r\nthe wine-carts instead of swill-carts; the Italian peasants instead of\r\nPaddies; agriculture instead of commerce; churches and monasteries in\r\nplace of cotton-mills; Roman watch-towers instead of factory-chimneys;\r\ntrees instead of board-yards; vineyards and olive-groves in place of\r\nblue-grass and persimmon trees; golden oranges in place of crab-apples\r\nand choke-pears; _zigarri scelti_ instead of Cabañas--but this is the\r\nreverse of the medal; let us stop before we ruin our first position.\r\n\r\nIt was warm in Rome. The English had fled. The Romans, pure blood, once\r\nmore wandered toward sunset--not after it--on the Pincian Hill, and trod\r\nwith solid step the gravel of _Il Pincio Liberato_. In the Spanish\r\nsquare around the fountain called Barcaccia, the lemonaders are\r\nencamped; a hint of lemon, a supposition of sugar, a certainty of\r\nwater--what more can one expect for a baioccho? From midday until three\r\no'clock in the afternoon, scarcely a place of business, store or shop,\r\nis open in Rome. The inhabitants are sleeping, clad as Monsieur Dubufe\r\nconceived the original Paradisians should be clad. At sunset, as you\r\nturn down the Via Condotti, you see chairs and tables placed outside the\r\nCafé Greco for its frequenters. The interior rooms are too, too close.\r\nEven that penetralia, the 'Omnibus,' can not compare with the unwalled\r\nroom outside, with its star-gemmed ceiling, and the cool breeze eddying\r\naway the segar-smoke; so its usual occupants are all outside.\r\n\r\nAt one of these tables sat Caper, Rocjean, and their mutual friend,\r\nDexter--an animal painter--the three in council, discussing the\r\nquestion: 'Where shall we go this summer?' Rocjean strongly advocated\r\nthe cause of a little town in the Volscian mountains, called Segni,\r\nassuring his friends that two artists of the French Academy had\r\ndiscovered it the summer before.\r\n\r\n'And they told me,' he said, 'that they would have lived there until\r\nthis time if they had had it in their power. Not that the scenery around\r\nthere was any better, if so good, as at Subiaco, or even Gennezzano; but\r\nthe wine was very cheap, and the cost of boarding at the _locanda_ was\r\nonly forty baiocchi a day----'\r\n\r\n'We will go, we will go!' chimed in Caper.\r\n\r\n'There were festivals in some of the neighboring towns nearly every\r\nweek, and costumes----'\r\n\r\n'Let us travel there,' said Caper, 'at once!'\r\n\r\n'Horses were to be had for a song----'\r\n\r\n'I am ready to sing,' remarked Dexter.\r\n\r\n'There was good shooting; _beccafichi_, woodcock, and quails, also\r\nred-legged partridges----'\r\n\r\n'Say no more,' spoke Caper, 'but let us secure seats in the next stage\r\nthat starts for such game scenes--immediately!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMatters were so well arranged by Rocjean, that three days after the\r\nabove conversation, the three artists, with passports properly viséed,\r\nwere waiting, toward sunset, in the Piazza Pollajuólo, for the time not\r\nadvertised, but spoken of, by the _vetturino_ Francesco as his hour for\r\nstarting for Segni.\r\n\r\nOur trio entered from the piazza, (every house in the environs of it\r\nbeing gayly decked outside with flying pennants, banners, standards,\r\nflags, in the shape of long shirts, short shirts, sheets, and stockings,\r\nhanging out to dry.) They entered the house, resembling a hen-house,\r\nwhere the _vettura_ was reposing, and commenced a rigid examination of\r\nthe old vehicle, which looked guilty and treacherous enough to have\r\ncommitted all kinds of break-downs and upsets in its day. While they\r\nwere thus engaged, the driver and an assistant mounted to the top and\r\nmade fast the baggage, covering it all with a rough reed matting, and\r\ntying it carefully on with cords, except a large-sized basket, which\r\nthey let fall, striking Caper on one side of the head as it descended.\r\n\r\n'_Accidente!_' yelled two voices from the top of the carriage. 'Santa\r\nMaria! Madonna mia! it isn't any thing, merely a bread-basket!' cried\r\nFrancesco, who, delighted to find out he had not killed his passenger\r\nand so lost a scudo, at once harnessed in three horses abreast to the\r\n_vettura_, interspersing his performance with enough oaths and vulgarity\r\nto have lasted a small family of economical _contadine_ for a week. One\r\nof his team, a mare named Filomena, he seemed to be particularly down\r\non. She was evidently not of a sensitive disposition, or she might have\r\nrevenged sundry defamations of her character with her heels. As it was,\r\nshe only whinnied, and playfully took off the driver's cap with her\r\nteeth, lifting a few hairs with it.\r\n\r\n'_Signora diavola!_' said Francesco, addressing the mare, and grabbing\r\nhis cap from her teeth, 'this is an insult--an insult to ME! Recollect\r\nthat when you are going up the mountain!'\r\n\r\n'Come, Francesco, come!' said Rocjean, 'it's time to be off.'\r\n\r\n'_Ecco me qua_, Signore, have patience a little minute, (_piccolo\r\nmomento_,) and then, whew! but we'll fly!'\r\n\r\nThe trio were anxious to get off, for every now and then, from some\r\nthird or fourth-story window, down would come waste water thus emptied\r\ninto the street, and they were fearful that they might be deluged.\r\n\r\n'Jump inside,' said Francesco, when he had the old _vettura_ fairly in\r\nthe street, 'then you may laugh at the cascades of Pollajuólo,\r\n_seguro_!'\r\n\r\n_Creak, bang! rumble, rattle_; off they went, and were fairly under way,\r\nat last, for Segni. They passed out of Rome by the Porta San Giovanni,\r\nwhere their passports received a _visto_; and this being finished, again\r\nstarted, the _vettura_ soon reaching the Campagna. It looked a fair and\r\nwinning scene, as they saw far away its broad fields of ripe wheat\r\nswayed by the wind, and nodding all golden in the setting sun; herds of\r\nhorses feeding on the bright green grass; the large grey oxen,\r\nblack-eyed and branching-horned, following the _mandarina_ or leading ox\r\nwith his tinkling bell; the ruined aqueducts and Roman tombs; the\r\ndistant mountains robed in purple mist; the blue-clothed contadini\r\nreturning homewards. Yet this was where the malaria raged. As the road,\r\nafter an hour's drive, gradually ascending, carried them into a purer\r\nand clearer air, and they felt its freshness invigorating mind and body,\r\nthere broke out a merry spirit of fun with our trio, as, descending from\r\nthe carriage, they walked up the steepest part of the ascent, laughing\r\nand joking, or stopping to note the glories of sunset over Rome, above\r\nwhich hung the dome of St. Peter's, grand in the golden haze.\r\n\r\nThey reached Colonna while the West was still flaming away, and found\r\nthe red wine there cool, if nothing better, as they drank it by the\r\nfountain under the old trees. Then they mounted the _vettura_ refreshed,\r\nand pushed on in the shadow of evening, under a long avenue of trees,\r\nand late into the night, until they reached Valmontone; and they knew,\r\nby the tinkling of mule-bells, and the hoarse shouts of their drivers,\r\nwith the barking of dogs, and the bars of bright light shooting through\r\ndarkness from doors and windows, that the _Osteria e Locanda_ was near,\r\nand supper not far off. The _vettura_ stopped.\r\n\r\nDescending, they entered the large hall of the inn, with its whitewashed\r\nwalls and brick floor, its ceiling heavy with rough-hewn rafters, and\r\nits long wooden tables and rough benches stained nearly black by use. By\r\nthe oil lights burning in the graceful long-stemmed Roman lamps, they\r\nsaw three or four countrymen eating eggs fried with olive-oil in little\r\nearthenware pipkins--a highly popular dish in the country round Rome,\r\nsince, by proper management, a great deal of bread, which is not very\r\ndear, can be consumed with a few eggs. One of the number was luxuriating\r\nin _agradolce_--meat stewed with preserved prunes or cherries--a dish\r\nwhich many travelers have laughed at in Germany, but have never observed\r\nin 'classic Italy.'\r\n\r\n'_E che volete, Signori?_' from the once white-aproned waiter, aroused\r\nour artists to a sense of duty; and fried ham, eggs, bread, and wine,\r\nwith a salad, were ordered, slowly brought, and ham and eggs quickly\r\nfinished and again furnished, much to the astonishment of a family of\r\npeasants who had entered while they were eating, and who watched the\r\nplates of ham and eggs disappear as if it were a feat of jugglery. After\r\nsupper came coffee and segars, and the sight of one of the soldiers of\r\nthe patrol, who came in to have a glass of _sambuca_, his blue uniform\r\nin good condition, his carbine brightly shining. After the horses were\r\nwell rested, the _vettura_ again started, as the first faint light of\r\nday shone in the east. About two miles from Valmontone, they commenced\r\nthe ascent of the mountains, and shortly had two oxen attached to help\r\ndrag their vehicle upward. The road wound along a mountain side--a\r\nravine far below them--and from its base arose a high conical mountain\r\nopposite to them, as they slowly toiled upward. Again and again they\r\npulled through heavy clouds of mist hanging around the mountain side,\r\nemerging above them only again to enter others. Finally it cleared; and\r\nover the mountains, beyond the valley yet white with the morning dews,\r\nthey saw the red sun rise clear and sparkling; while high above their\r\nheads, perched on mountain top and side, loomed out the old, gray,\r\ntime-worn walls of Segni. The _vettura_ came to a halt under the shade\r\nof some old mulberry trees, and our travelers descended to leave it\r\nwhere it was, for the town was not built with a view to the entrance of\r\ncarriages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDAY IN THE CAMPAGNA.\r\n\r\nLeaving the _vettura_, they mounted the steep road, seeing above them\r\nthe ruined walls, once the ramparts of the town, crowned by gray old\r\nhouses with tiled roofs rising one over the other, and soon entered the\r\nMaggiore Gate with its round arch, its architecture noting a time when\r\nSegni was not quite the unknown place it now is. As they entered the\r\ngate, seeing the cleanly-dressed country people seated on the stone\r\nbenches under its shadow--the women with their blue woolen shawls formed\r\ninto coifs falling over head and shoulders, loose and pendent white\r\nlinen sleeves, and black woolen boddices tightly laced, calico or woolen\r\nskirts, and dark blue woolen aprons with broad bands of yellow or red;\r\nwhile the men wore blue knee-breeches, brown woolen stockings, and blue\r\njackets, with here and there a short scarlet waistcoat, and all with\r\nblack conical felt hats, sometimes ornamented with a flower--noting all\r\nthis, our artists knew it was Sunday or a festival. It was both.\r\n\r\nThe main street was very narrow--the houses so close together that a\r\ndonkey loaded with brush-wood could hardly scrape through--and so steep\r\nthat he had hard work to get a foot-hold on the smooth, worn stones\r\nserving to pave it. The buildings were all of that sombre gray stone so\r\npicturesque in paintings, and so pleasant for the eye to rest on, yet\r\nwithal suggesting no brilliant ideas of cleanliness or even neatness.\r\nThe houses were rarely over two stories in hight, the majority only one\r\nstory, and but very few of them boasted glazed window-frames,\r\nboard-shutters letting in light or keeping out rain. Two twists through\r\nthe narrow streets, or rather alleys, a right-angled turn, a wheel to\r\nthe left, then straight forward thirty steps, and lo! they were in the\r\ninn, alias _locanda_, of Gaetano. As soon as rooms could be given them,\r\nour artists, spite of its being daylight, took a long nap, induced by\r\ntraveling all night without sleep.\r\n\r\nAbout noon the landlord, Gaetano, aroused them with the fact that dinner\r\nwas ready. They made a hearty meal, the landlord being careful to wish\r\nthem 'good appetite' before they commenced. When it was over, and they\r\nwere about to rise and go forth to discover if there was a café in the\r\ntown, the waiter-girl appeared with two large dishes, on one of which\r\nwere green peas in the pod, and on the other goat's-milk cheese.\r\n\r\n'I know what the cheese is for,' said Caper, 'but it seems to me an odd\r\nway, to send in peas for the guests to shell for them.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps,' said Dexter, 'as they've no opera-house here, it's one of\r\ntheir amusements.'\r\n\r\n'Can you tell me,' asked Rocjean of the stout waiter-girl, 'what we are\r\nto do with those peas?'\r\n\r\n'Eh? Why, Signor, they are the fruit. You eat them.'\r\n\r\n'Pods and all?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly; they are very sweet and tender.'\r\n\r\n'No, thank you. You can take them away. Will you send the _padrone_\r\nhere?'\r\n\r\nIn came the landlord, and then and there a bargain was struck. For forty\r\ncents a day, he agreed to give them individually:\r\n\r\nFirst. Breakfast, consisting of eggs, bread, butter, fruit in season,\r\none dish of meat, a pint of good wine, and a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\nSecond. Dinner; soup, boiled meat, roast meat, vegetables, bread,\r\nbutter, fish occasionally, one pint of wine, salad, dessert.\r\n\r\nThird. Supper; one dish of meat, bread, butter, salad, and pint of wine.\r\n\r\nFourth. A bed-chamber for each one, with the use of the main room.\r\n\r\nIt was moreover agreed and covenanted, that for the extra sum of two\r\nbaiocchi each one, he would provide a cup of coffee and sugar after\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nThis is the Italian mode of proceeding; and when you have done thus, you\r\nwill rarely find any trouble, either in receiving what you have agreed\r\nfor, or in being overcharged. Justice to Gaetano Colajamo, keeper of the\r\nlocanda at Segni, demands that it should be here witnessed that he\r\nfaithfully and truly kept the agreement thus made; that after six months\r\nspent with him by Caper, he found that Gaetano had acted fairly,\r\nsquarely, honestly, and manfully with him, from the day of his arrival\r\nuntil he shook hands at parting. May his tribe increase!\r\n\r\nLeaving the hotel, they found a café near the Maggiore Gate, and learned\r\nthat coffee was to be had there only on Sundays and festivals, the\r\ndemand for it on other days being so small that it would not pay to make\r\nit. After coffee, Caper proposed a ramble up-town, and the trio sallied\r\nout, succeeding by dint of perseverance, and digging their heels firmly\r\nin the pavement, in climbing up the main street, which was about ten\r\nfeet wide and very steep, an angle of forty-five degrees about\r\ndescribing its inclination, and as it was paved with limestone cubes\r\nworn smooth by the iron shoes of clambering horses and donkeys, it was\r\ndifficult at times to prevent slipping. The irregularity of the front of\r\nthe houses, and their evident want of repairs, in fact, their general\r\ntumble-down look, relieved here and there by a handsome middle-age\r\ndoorway or window on the first floor, while the second story would show\r\na confused modern wall of rubble-work and poverty-stricken style of\r\narchitecture generally; all these contrasts brought out the picturesque\r\nelement in force. As they passed a row of iron-grated windows a rough,\r\nhairy hand was thrust nearly into Rocjean's face, with the request that\r\nhe would bestow a baioccho for charity on the owner.\r\n\r\n'What are you doing in there?' asked Dexter.\r\n\r\n'Nothing, nothing. Santa Maria! I am an innocent man. I never did any\r\nthing; I never will do any thing so long as I live.'\r\n\r\n'That's the reason they shut you up, perhaps. You are lazy, an't you?'\r\n\r\n'Never. It's because I have been too active. So, Signor, give me a few\r\nbaiocchi, for I am tired of being shut up in this old bottle, and if\r\nthey will let me out I will marry her to-morrow.'\r\n\r\nSo Rocjean gave him a few baiocchi, asking Caper what he thought of this\r\nplan of allowing jail-birds to sit and sing to every one who passed by,\r\npermitting the inmates of the prison to converse with and entertain\r\ntheir friends?\r\n\r\nThey had hardly passed the prison before three horses, sleekly curried,\r\nand with ribbons tied to their manes and tails, were led past them. And\r\nin answer to a question from Dexter, he learned that they were being led\r\ndown to the stretch of road at the foot of the town, the spur connecting\r\nthe conical mountain on which Segni is built, with the Volscian\r\nmountains in its rear. This road was about a quarter of a mile in\r\nlength, quite level, and lined on both sides with fine old elm-trees,\r\ngiving goodly shade; it was used as a race-course; and the three horses\r\nwere going down to run a _Carriera_ or race. Four horses were to run\r\nbare-backed, their riders being well used to dispense with saddles, and\r\nmanaging to guide them with a rope halter in lieu of bridle. The purse\r\nwas four scudi, (four dollars.) Two horses were to run at a time, and\r\nthe race was then to be run off by the two winning horses.\r\n\r\nAnxious to conform to the customs of the country, including Sabbath\r\nquarter-races, our three artists retraced their steps, and descending\r\nthe main street, were soon outside the gate of the town. Selecting a\r\ngood position in the shade where they could see the race to advantage,\r\nthey quietly waited for the races to begin. At the firing of a gun, down\r\nthe course came two flying bay horses, ridden by boys, who urged them on\r\nto top speed, accelerated by the shouts of the entire population; the\r\nsmallest horse won that heat. Again the gun was fired, and now the two\r\nother horses, a dark bay and a black, came thundering along, the black\r\ngoing ahead by four lengths, and receiving shouts of applause as _Il\r\nDiavolo Benissimo_! Now came the real pull, for the two winners were to\r\ntry off; and as the last gun sounded, _Clatter, whizz!_ the small bay\r\nand the black horse fairly flew by, neck and neck; unfortunately the\r\nblack bolted from the course before he reached the goal, and the last\r\nseen of him he was somewhere on top of a hill with his legs white with\r\nlime, which he had picked up darting through a mortar-bed where a house\r\nwas building; The bay horse, _Mortadella_, ridden by a boy named Bruno,\r\nwon this Sunday quarter-race; and though the horse was not timed, it is\r\nsafe to say the time was good, taking into account the fact that on\r\nweek-days he brought wood down the mountain on his back, and\r\nconsequently had that peculiar corkscrew motion incident to his\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nThe race over, Caper proposed their once more ascending the main street\r\nand making a bold endeavor to discover the top of the town, from which\r\nhe argued there must be a fine view. Sturdily mounting up, they found\r\nthemselves at last on the summit of the mountain, and passing several\r\nhouses, an academy and a church, found before them a pleasant walk\r\ncalled the Pianillo, which was the crown of the conical mountain, and\r\nfrom whence, looking over the valley below and around them, they saw far\r\noff the Albanian mountains to their front and left, while away to their\r\nright hand and fading into the clouds, the chain of the Abruzzi showed\r\nthem the confines of Naples. From this walk they saw the mountains and\r\ntowns of San Germano, Santo Padre di Regno, l'Arnara, Frosinone,\r\nTorrice, Monte San Giovanni, Veroli, Ferentino, Morino, Agnani, Acuto,\r\nPiglio, Serrone, Paliano, Roviate, Civitella, Olevano, San Vito,\r\nCapranica, Gennazzano, Cave, Palestrina, Valmontone, Montefortino,\r\nLugnano, Zagarolo, Colonna, Rocca Priora, and the neighboring towns of\r\nSgurgola, Gorga, and Gavignano, with that lovely valley, La Villamagna.\r\n\r\nLost in admiration of the splendid panorama before them, our artists\r\nwere not at first aware that the Pianillo was fast filling up with the\r\npeople who had lately attended the horse-race; believing they were\r\nattracted here by the lovely scenery, they only admired their good\r\ntaste, when Rocjean, overhearing two of the Segnians, discovered that\r\nthey came there to enjoy a very different spectacle--that of _La Giostra\r\ndel Porchetto_, or\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL-HOG GAME.\r\n\r\nWhat this might be, our artists had yet to learn; it sounded slightly\r\nsensual for a Sunday amusement, but as there was a bishop in the town,\r\nand nothing could consequently be permitted that would shock, etc.,\r\netc., Caper, Rocjean, and Dexter at once agreed to assist the heads of\r\nthe church in their pious endeavors to celebrate the day--as the Romans\r\ndo. Not far from where they were standing, at the foot of wild rocks and\r\nthe ruins of an old Roman watchtower, was a curious basin cut in the\r\nsolid rock, its sides lined with large blocks, and its circular form\r\npreserved entire; its depth was from five to seven feet, and its bottom\r\nwas like the sides, paved with smooth blocks. It was popularly said to\r\nhave been anciently a cistern, a fish-tank, etc., but nothing was known\r\ndefinitely as to its original purpose; it now served for the circus,\r\nwhere the Small-Hog Game was annually indulged in.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-two o'clock, (that is, six in the afternoon,) the audience\r\nand spectators--for it was an audible as well as visible\r\nentertainment--being assembled and desirous for the performance to\r\ncommence, whistled and shouted slightly, but not indecorously; for the\r\ngrand army of the town--seven gendarmes--were around. Our three artists\r\nmounted up the rocks overhanging the cistern, and looked down on the\r\nheads of the people. They saw a thousand or two female heads, mostly\r\nwith light hair, all pulled directly back from the forehead, twisted\r\ninto a knot behind, and tied with a piece of string, while a silver\r\nbodkin a foot in length, run in sideways, held it tight. The heads of\r\nthese silver hair-pins indicated the married or unmarried state of the\r\nwearers; the former were fashioned as acorns or flower-buds, while the\r\nlatter were full-blown flowers with expanded petals. The faces of these\r\nwomen were tanned, but ruddy health was there and robust forms; and you\r\nsaw among them all a very happy, contented, ignorant look, showing a\r\nsatisfied condition of heart, without endless longings for the\r\nunattainable and dim--they always had 'the dim' about them in the shape\r\nof the one-horse lamps of the country, a saucer of oil with a piece of\r\ntwine hanging over the edge for a wick. By the way, the Acadiens on\r\nBayou La Fourche in Louisiana have the same 'lampion' light!\r\n\r\nThe dress of these women was plain, but strong and serviceable. White\r\nshirts in full folds covered neck and bosom, the sleeves hanging from\r\nthe shoulder in large folds, a boddice of dark blue cloth was laced\r\ntightly around their waists, while skirts, generally of dark blue cloth,\r\nhung in heavy lines to their ankles.\r\n\r\nThe men, assembled there to the number of about two thousand, were\r\naccoutred in blue cloth jackets, (which rarely have the owners' arms in\r\nthe sleeve, but are worn as cloaks,) red waistcoats of startlingly\r\ncrimson color, and blue small clothes, while conical black felt hats,\r\nadorned here and there with flowers, served for head-coverings. A large\r\nassemblage of children, dressed and undressed, filled up the gaps.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, _Bang, Bangity Bang!_ and a row of small mortars were fired\r\noff in succession, and a small boy with a banner in his hands, and an\r\nIrish pennant in his wake, appeared marching slowly along. On the banner\r\nwas a painting of a small black hog between two men, each armed with\r\nbrooms, who seemed bent on sweeping it out of existence; over these were\r\nthe words:\r\n\r\n\r\nGIOSTRA DEL PORCHETTO.\r\n\r\nThen came six _contadini_, young men and stout, each armed with a broom\r\nthree or four feet in length, made of rushes tied together, resembling\r\nour birch-brooms without their handles. They entered the arena or\r\ncistern, and then each one throwing aside his hat, had a large linen bag\r\ncoming to a point at the top, tied over his head and throat, so that it\r\nwas impossible for him to see. On each of these bags a comical face was\r\nroughly painted. To the right leg of each man a cow-bell was tied; with\r\ntheir brooms swinging a preparatory flourish, the six stood ready to\r\ncommence the game. The small hog was then turned into the cistern,\r\nannouncing his presence by sundry squeals. Now the game fairly begins:\r\n_Whish!_ sound the brooms as they are whisked here, there, every where,\r\nin attempts to strike the hog; one man giving a strong blow, strikes\r\nanother one who was stooping down to arrange his garters, where he\r\ndislikes to be struck, and instantly the one struck runs a muck, hitting\r\nwildly left and right. Two or three men charge on one another and brooms\r\nfly in splinters all round. One champion got a head-blow and had his\r\nwind knocked out by another blow simultaneously; round they go, and at\r\nit they go, beating the air and each other, while the wreath of honor,\r\n_alias_ small hog, keeps turning up his head, calculating the chances\r\nand making fierce rushes every time he sees a broom approaching him; he\r\nmust have practiced in the game before, he manages so well to avoid\r\nbeing hit. The six men being unable to hit the hog, grew angry, and one\r\nof them, unmindful of the fact that his small clothes had burst open at\r\nthe knee, and his stockings were around his shoes, terribly batters\r\nanother combatant, who strives in vain to dodge him. Then the six\r\nshouted truce, and pulling off their caps, declared that the small hog\r\nmust have the bell tied to him also, so that like a beacon (or bacon) he\r\nmight warn the cruisers of his whereabouts. This arranged, and the caps\r\nbeing again tied on, they recommence the game with renewed spirit. One\r\nman ignobly raised his helmet, _alias_ nose-bag, to see where the small\r\nhog was keeping himself, and then made a rush for him, whereupon one of\r\nthree umpires, a very lean man with nervous twitches, rushed at the man\r\nin a great state of excitement, and collared him amid the disapproving\r\nshouts of the spectators; he let him go upon this, and the other two\r\numpires, who were fat men, jumping into the cistern to take away their\r\nlean brother, received several violent blows on the road, finally\r\nleading away the thin man in a high state of twitches, communicating\r\nthemselves to his stove-pipe hat, (only one on the ground,) and to a\r\nlarge cane he tried to hold. A lucky blow from one of the gamesters\r\nstruck the hog, and there was a cessation of hitting, interrupted by an\r\noutside _contadino_ of the tight-built style breaking through the\r\ngendarmes and umpires and jumping into the middle of the cistern,\r\nbeginning a fearful battle of words with the man who hit the hog,\r\ninterrupted, however, by two of the gendarmes, who collared him and led\r\nhim off up the steps, his legs very stiff, his body at an angle of\r\nforty-five degrees, and his head turned round to give a few last fierce\r\nwords to the hog-hitter. The man would have made a good bandit, on\r\ncanvas, with his bronzed, bearded face, flashing eyes, conical hat,\r\nsavage features, broad shirt-collar, red sash around his waist, and\r\nleather gaiters, showing he rode horses and came from down in the plain.\r\n\r\nThe game recommenced, and by good luck the broom-swinger who hit the hog\r\nthe first blow, hit him twice more; and the regulation being that\r\nwhoever first struck the hog three blows should win him, the successful\r\nhog-hunter bore off the small hog on his back, having at the same time\r\nto carry the standard above described. The cheers of beauty and ugliness\r\naccompanied the hog and standard-bearer, as jerking down his head the\r\numpire pulled off his head-bag, showing the face of Bruno, the butcher,\r\nwho kept a bull-dog. A great many friends surrounded him, patting him on\r\nthe back--_he had a hog to be eaten!_\r\n\r\nSo ended the Game of the Small-Hog.\r\n\r\nAfter this was all over, a Tombola came off in front of the church, and\r\nour three artists having purchased tickets for this Sunday lottery, in\r\norder to keep the day as the rest of the people did, and not render\r\nthemselves liable to the censure of being eccentric, had an opportunity\r\nof seeing its beneficial working--for those who got it up!\r\n\r\nThe Tombola finished, there was a good display of fire-works; in the\r\nstill night air of the Sabbath the fiery snakes and red serpents, blue\r\nfires and green, darting flames and forked lights, reminded our\r\nartists of a large painting over the Maggiore Gate of the town, where\r\na lot of the condemned are expiring in a very vermilion-colored\r\nInferno--condemned, perhaps, for Sabbath-breaking!\r\n\r\nReturning to their inn to supper, the landlord handed them a note\r\nwithout address, which he said had been sent them by the Gonfaloniere of\r\nthe city, who had called upon them as soon as he learned that they were\r\nstrangers there. Caper opening the envelope, found in it the following\r\nprinted invitation to attend a concert to be given that night at the\r\nPalazzo Comunale, in honor of the day:\r\n\r\n\r\n'IL GONFALONIERE\r\n\r\n'DELLA CITTA' DI SEGNI\r\n\r\n     'Invita li sigi, Rocjean, Caper e Dexter ad intervenire all'\r\n     Accademia di Musica che si terrà nella Sala del Palazzo Comunale il\r\n     giorno 18 Luglio alle ore 9-1/2 pom. per festeggiare la ricorrenza\r\n     del Protettore S. Bruno.'\r\n\r\n'It sounds well,' said Dexter; 'but both of you have seen the\r\ntumble-down, ruined look of the old town, or city, as they call it; and\r\nthe inhabitants, as far as I have seen them, don't indicate a very\r\nselect audience for the concert.'\r\n\r\n'Select audience be hanged! it's this very selectness that is no\r\nselectness, that makes your English and a part of our American society a\r\ndreary bore,' broke in Caper; 'I've come up here in the mountains to be\r\nfree, and if the Gonfaloniere bids me welcome to a palace where the\r\n_nobilitá_ await me, with music, I shall not ask whether they are select\r\nor not, but go.'\r\n\r\n'I think,' spoke Rocjean, 'we should go; it will be the easiest way to\r\nacknowledge the attention shown us, and probably the pleasantest to the\r\none who sent it. I am going.'\r\n\r\nIt therefore came to pass that near the hour noted in the invitation,\r\nRocjean and Caper, inquiring the direction to the Palazzo Comunale of\r\nthe landlord, went forth to discover its whereabouts, leaving Dexter to\r\nhunt scorpions in the sitting-room of the inn, or study the stars from\r\nits balcony.\r\n\r\nClimbing up the main street, now quite dark save where the lamp of a\r\nstray shrine or two feebly lit up a few feet around it, they soon found\r\nthe palace, the lower story of which held the post-office and various\r\nother offices. After passing a gendarme on guard at the door, they found\r\nthemselves in a not very light hall leading to the second story;\r\nmounting a flight of stairs, there stood another soldier on guard; a\r\ndoor suddenly was thrown open, and then a burst of light showed them a\r\nlarge hall with lofty ceilings, the walls hung with red and golden\r\ntapestry and with its rich medieval groined arches and gilded cornices,\r\nresembling, after all the ruins and decay of the town, a castle-hall in\r\nfairy-land rather than a positively real earthly room. Dazzled by the\r\nbrilliance of the scene, Rocjean and Caper were standing near the door\r\nof entrance, when a tall, stout, and very handsome man, leaving a circle\r\nof ladies, at once approached them, and introducing himself as the\r\nGonfaloniere of the city, with much courtesy showed them to seats among\r\nthe 'most reserved of the reserved.' There sat the Bishop of the Commune\r\nin purple silk robes, with an inch-wide golden chain over his breast,\r\nanimatedly conversing with a dashing Roman lady, startingly handsome,\r\nwith solitaire diamond ear-rings flashing light, while the lace on her\r\ndress would have caused deaths of envy in one of our country villages.\r\nThe Governor of the Province was there, a quiet, grave gentleman,\r\nearnest enough in his duties to be respected, and evidently a favorite\r\nwith several ladies who also shone in diamonds and with the 'air noble'\r\nso much adored by Dexter, A warlike looking priest whom Caper afterward\r\nfound out was the chaplain of a regiment of soldiers, and by no means\r\nafraid of grape-juice, was also there; and with numerous distinguished\r\nmen and beautiful women including one or two of the _Stelle d'Anagni_,\r\nor Stars of Anagni, as the nobility of that town are called, made with\r\ntheir rich dresses and courteous manners such a picture--so startlingly\r\nin contrast with the out-door life that our artists had seen, that they\r\nhave never forgotten it to this day. The concert for which the\r\ninvitation was given soon commenced. The selection of vocal and\r\ninstrumental pieces was made with good judgment, and the singers who\r\ncame from Rome, and had been selected for their ability, sung with a\r\nskill and grace that proved they knew that their audience had nice\r\njudgment and critical ears.\r\n\r\nThe concert was over: and having made their acknowledgments to the\r\nGonfaloniere for the pleasure they had received through his invitation,\r\nour two artists, lighting segars, walked up to the Pianillo, where the\r\nrising moon gave them a splendid view of the Campagna and\r\nmountain-bounded horizon. Thus ended their first day in Segni, and their\r\nfirst Sunday in the Campagna.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA TRIGLIA.\r\n\r\nThe sickles were flashing in the sunlight, felling the ripened wheat in\r\nthe valley, when our three artists, having previously arranged the\r\nmatter with a certain Segnian named Bruno, stood one morning early,\r\nwaiting his appearance with horses, to carry them down the mountain to a\r\nfarm belonging to Prince Doria, called the Piombinara. There they were\r\ngoing to see a _triglia_ or threshing of wheat with horses.\r\n\r\n'Here he comes,' said Caper, 'with a piebald horse and a bay mare and an\r\niron-gray mule. Let's toss up for a choice.'\r\n\r\nThe mule fell to Caper: mounting him gayly, and calling to the others to\r\nfollow, he led the way with their guide down the steep street of the\r\ntown until they reached the road outside of the gate, when the others\r\ncoming up, the party ambled along down the mountain road. In about an\r\nhour they reached the plain, and fifteen minutes more brought them to\r\nthe old, ivy-covered, ruined fortress of the middle ages, called the\r\nPiombinara: passing this, they soon reached an open field, in the centre\r\nof which, near a small cabin, they found quite a number of harvesters\r\nengaged piling up sheaves of wheat in a circle on a spot of ground\r\npreviously leveled and hardened until it presented a surface as even as\r\na barn-floor.\r\n\r\nWhile they were inquiring of the harvesters as to the time when the\r\nthreshing would commence, a fine-looking man, mounted on a fiery,\r\nfull-blooded chestnut horse, rode up, and politely saluting the three\r\nartists, inquired of them if they were not desirous of seeing the\r\n_triglia_.\r\n\r\nRocjean answered that it was for that purpose they had come there,\r\nhaving learned in Segni that the horses would begin the threshing that\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe horseman then introduced himself as Prince Doria's agent for the\r\nPiombinara and farmer of the estate, and gave them a warm welcome; being\r\nvery glad, he said, that the _triglia_ would not begin until the\r\nafternoon, since he hoped it would give him in the mean time the\r\npleasure of showing them the estate, and extending the rough hospitality\r\nof the Campagna to them.\r\n\r\nOur artists, acknowledging his politeness, accepted the invitation of\r\nSignor Ercole, as he was generally called, and upon his proposing a ride\r\naround the estate, accompanied him. They first visited the old ruin,\r\nriding in through what was formerly its main entrance. Once inside, they\r\nfound the lower walls sufficiently entire to give them an idea of the\r\nsize and form of the old fortress. At one end they found the ruins of a\r\nsmall chapel, where even yet the traces of fresco-painting could be seen\r\non its walls; near this arose a tall, square tower, ivy-clad to its very\r\nsummit, from whence a flock of hawks were flying in and out; the\r\nlightning had so shattered its walls that it threatened every moment to\r\nfall, yet in this dilapidated state it had remained for years, and was\r\nregarded, therefore, as an 'un-tumbling' curiosity. After some time\r\nspent here, which Dexter improved by making a pencil-sketch of the\r\nvalley and adjacent mountains, Signor Ercole leading the way, they rode\r\nthrough a small woods where herds on herds of black hogs were feeding,\r\nto the pasture-grounds where the brood-mares and colts of the Prince\r\nwere seen grazing together. Over a hundred head of the purest\r\nblood-stock were here, and Dexter, who was thoroughly conversant with\r\nhorse-flesh, passed the highest encomiums of praise on many of the\r\nanimals. Riding on, they next saw quite a number of oxen, but the\r\nsuperintendent informed them that these were only a few kept to perform\r\nthe farm-work, the large herds belonging to the estate being at this\r\nseason of the year driven miles away to feed upon other lands of the\r\nPrince. Continuing their ride, the party next came to the wheat-fields,\r\nextending far and wide, like those of Illinois, for a hundred acres or\r\nmore: here the harvesters, most of whom were from the Abruzzi, were\r\nbusily engaged, men and women, in loading the large carts with\r\nwheat-sheafs, the grain being all cut, and consequently many of the\r\nlaborers having returned to their distant homes. Returning from the\r\nfields, Signor Ercole now invited them to enter the farmhouse. This was\r\na very large stone house whitewashed, looking as they approached it more\r\nlike a garrison for several regiments than a residence for a few\r\nfamilies, and a store-house for agricultural implements and crops. The\r\nlower floor of this long building was taken up with stables and offices,\r\nbut mounting a wide stone staircase, our artists found themselves in a\r\nlarge room scrupulously neat, with whitewashed walls, very high\r\nceilings, and whips, guns, dogs, tables, account-books, stone floors and\r\nrough seats, making a curious mingling of monastery, squire's office,\r\nsportsman's chamber, and social hall, for no sooner had Signor Ercole\r\nseen his guests comfortably seated, than his servant brought in segars,\r\nwith a brass dish of live coals to light them, several bottles of wine,\r\nand one of capital old Sambuca di Napoli, a liquor that is refreshing,\r\ndrank, as it should be, with a good allowance of water.\r\n\r\nDinner was served at an early hour, with a profusion of each dish that\r\nwould have frightened an economical Yankee housewife. Six roast chickens\r\nwere not considered at all too many for the five persons at table--the\r\nfifth being a jolly old gentleman, an uncle to the Signor Ercole. The\r\nplate of maccaroni looked as if Gargantua had ordered it--the salad\r\nmight have been put in a bushel measure, the bread been carried in a\r\ndonkey-cart, and the wine--ahem! in the expressive language of the\r\nCelts, there was 'lashings of it.'\r\n\r\nBut even a Campagna dinner with a Farmer-General will have an end, and\r\nwhen our friends had finished theirs, they arose and went dreamily forth\r\nto the before-mentioned squire's office, where they lighted segars,\r\nwhile they drank small cups of black coffee, and gazed out of the open\r\nwindows to the distant mountains, rising far above the plain sleeping in\r\nthe summer sun, and hushed to sleep by the unceasing song of the cicalas\r\nsharply crying from leaf and blade of grass.\r\n\r\nAbout three o'clock in the afternoon a man came to inform the Signor\r\nErcole that the mares and colts had been driven into the corral, and our\r\nparty accordingly walked out to see them lassoed prior to their\r\nperformance in the ring. As they approached the corral, they saw the\r\nblooded animals circling around the inclosure, apparently aware that\r\nthey would soon be called on to do some work--the only work, in fact,\r\nthe majority of them had to do the whole year through. Taking a lasso\r\nfrom one of the men, Signor Ercole entered the inclosure and singling\r\nout a fine-looking bay mare, he threw the lasso--the noose encircling\r\nher neck as she dashed forward, bringing her up all standing. Satisfied\r\nwith this performance, he handed her over to one of the herdsmen, who\r\nfastening her with a halter, again and again swung the lasso, catching\r\nat last twelve horses and mares. One long halter was now attached to six\r\nof the animals, and a driver taking it in hand, led them toward the spot\r\nwhere the beaten earth was covered with sheafs of wheat standing on end\r\none against the other in a circle of say thirty or forty feet in\r\ndiameter; another driver fastening six others, horses and mares, to\r\nanother long halter, led them to the side opposite the first six. As\r\nsoon as they were stationed, waving long-lashed whips, plunge! ahead\r\nwent the wild horses, jumping into the wheat-sheaves breast-high,\r\nrearing, squealing, kicking, lashing out their hoofs, their eyes\r\nstarting from their heads, while each driver stood firm in one spot,\r\nwhirling his whiplash and keeping his team within a circle one half of\r\nwhich was in the wheat and the other half outside. Thus there were three\r\ncircles, one of wheat and the other two described by the horses as they\r\ndashed wildly around, the drivers shouting, the wheat flying and being\r\nquickly threshed under the swift-moving hoofs of the twelve four-legged\r\nflails!\r\n\r\nCaper and Dexter were meanwhile as busy as they could be sketching the\r\nscene before them and endeavoring to catch notes of the first plunges\r\nand excited motions of the horses. The active motive-power of the\r\nforeground finished, with a hasty sketch of the Piombinara at the right\r\nhand, in the middle ground the Campagna with its corn-fields and ruined\r\ntowers, while in the distance the Lepini mountains stretched away into\r\ncloud-land--all afforded a sketch from which both Caper and Dexter\r\nafterward made two very excellent paintings.\r\n\r\nThe sketches finished, Signor Ercole insisted upon the artists taking a\r\nstirrup-cup with him before they left for Segni, and accordingly\r\naccompanying him to the house, they drank success to their hospitable\r\nentertainer, and departed highly pleased with this Representative Man.\r\nIt is his class--the intelligent Producers of the Papal States--to whom\r\nwe must look for all the life that will keep that worn-out old body\r\nsufficiently animated to last until Regenerated Italy can take it in\r\nhand, see it decently buried, and over its tomb achieve a brilliant\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAINTING A DONKEY.\r\n\r\nSegni might well boast of her hogs and donkeys. As the sun rose, a\r\nwild-looking fellow stood by the Maggiore Gate and blew on a long horn\r\nmany rough blasts; then from all the streets and alleys rushed out black\r\nhogs tumultuously, to the number of one hundred or more, and followed\r\ntheir pastor with the horn, to the field or forest. There he guarded\r\nthem all day, and at sunset brought them back to the town; when as soon\r\nas they reached the gate, the herd separated, and right and left, at\r\ntop-speed, every hog hastened to his own house. Poor as the inhabitants\r\nwere, yet among the five thousand of them living in the town, besides\r\ncountless black hogs, they owned over two hundred and fifty donkeys and\r\nmules, the majority donkeys of the longest-eared, smallest-body breed\r\nyou can conceive. Costing little if any thing to support them, they were\r\nexcellent labor-saving machines, and did three quarters of the work that\r\nin our country would have been done by hod and wheelbarrow labor. Very\r\nsure-footed, they were well calculated for traveling the mountain-roads\r\naround; and with their enormous saddles, a direct copy of those now used\r\nin Egypt, of course attracted the attention of the two animal-painters,\r\nwho determined to secure a good specimen, and make a sketch of donkey\r\nand saddle.\r\n\r\nThe most comical-looking one in the town belonged to a cross,\r\nill-tempered, ugly brute of a hunchback, who, as soon as he learned that\r\nthe artists wanted to paint him, asked such a price for his loan that\r\nthey found themselves obliged to give up all hopes of taking his\r\nportrait. One morning, as Caper was walking out of the inn-door, he\r\nnearly tumbled over a little, sun-burnt, diminutive donkey that had a\r\nsaddle on his back, resembling, with this on him, a broken-backed\r\nrabbit. Caper was charmed; and as he stood there lost in admiration, a\r\npoor little lame boy came limping up, and catching Long Ears by the rope\r\nhalter, was leading him away, when the artist stopped him and asked him\r\nwhom it belonged to. The small boy, probably not understanding Caper, or\r\nafraid of him, made no answer, but resolutely pulled away the donkey to\r\na gateway leading into a garden, at the end of which was a half-ruined\r\nold house. Our artist followed him in, when, raising his eyes toward the\r\nhouse, he saw leaning from one of the windows, her figure marked boldly\r\nagainst the dark gray of the house, a strikingly beautiful woman. There\r\nwas an air of neatness in her dress, a certain care of her hair, that\r\nwas an improvement over any of the other female Segnians he had yet\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n'Can you tell me,' said Caper, pointing to the donkey, 'who owns that\r\nanimal?'\r\n\r\n'_Padrone mio_, I own him,' said the woman.\r\n\r\n'I want to paint him.'\r\n\r\n'_Do_ you?' replied the beauty, whose name Caper learned was Margarita;\r\nand she asked this with a very astonished look.\r\n\r\n'I do, indeed I do. It will not hurt him.'\r\n\r\n'No, I don't believe it will. He is very ugly and sun-burnt. I think it\r\nwill improve him,' said Margarita confidently.\r\n\r\nCaper didn't see how the mere taking his portrait would improve the\r\nanimal; but thinking it might be meant for a compliment, he assented,\r\nadding that he would pay a fair price for himself and his friend to be\r\nallowed to have the donkey, all saddled, for two or three hours every\r\nday when he was not used.\r\n\r\nThat very day, about four o'clock in the afternoon, Caper and Dexter,\r\nhaving prepared their sketching-paper, with colors on pallet,\r\nmall-sticks in hand, and seated on camp-stools in the shade of a wall,\r\nwere busy sketching in Margarita's garden, the donkey held by the little\r\nlame boy, and fed from time to time with corn-meal in order to keep him\r\nsteady. Margarita was seated, with a little child in her arms, on a\r\nflight of old wooden steps leading to the second story of her house; and\r\nwith her bright crimson boddice, and white falling linen sleeves, and\r\nshirt gathered in folds over her bosom, while her dark blue skirts, and\r\ndark apron with brilliant gold and red stripes, were draped around her\r\nas she sat on the stairs, looked exactly like one of Raphael's _Madonne\r\nalla Fornarina_. Her large eyes followed seriously every movement of the\r\npainters. Caper, learning that she was a widow, did not know but what\r\nher affections were straying his way.\r\n\r\n'I say, Dexter, don't you think, now, she's regarding us pretty\r\nclosely?'\r\n\r\n'I am sure it's the donkey is next her heart, and it is more than\r\nprobable she's there on watch to keep us from stealing it. D'ye notice\r\nthe manner she's eyeing the paints? Every time my brush goes near the\r\nvermilion, and I move my stool, her eyes brighten. I wonder what's up\r\naround the gate there? Hanged if half the old women and children around\r\ntown an't assembled there! Look.'\r\n\r\nCaper looked, and, sure enough, there was a crowd of heads; and not\r\ncontent with standing at the gateway, they began soon to enter the\r\ngarden, crowding around our two artists, getting in front of the donkey,\r\nand being generally in the way.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice Dexter drove them off with words, until at last, an\r\nunlucky urchin striking his elbow and making him mar his sketch, he laid\r\ndown his sketching-box, and, clubbing his campstool, made a rush at the\r\ncrowd. They fled before him, in their hurry tumbling one over the other,\r\nand then, scrambling to their feet, were soon out of sight. Returning to\r\nhis sketch, he was no sooner busily at work than they were all back\r\nagain, but now keeping at respectful distance.\r\n\r\nAfter about two hours' work, Caper proposed knocking off sketching, and\r\ncontinuing it next day; to which Dexter assenting, they put up their\r\nsketches. Caper agreeing to pay Margarita for the afternoon's study, he\r\nwent up to her, and handing over the amount agreed upon, she seemed by\r\nno means satisfied.\r\n\r\n'Won't that pay you?' asked he.\r\n\r\n'Certainly, but--'\r\n\r\n'But what?'\r\n\r\n'When are you going to paint the donkey? Here I've told all my friends\r\nthat you were to paint the little old fellow all over, perhaps a nice\r\nred color, or bright yellow; and here we've all been waiting hours to\r\nsee you begin, and you haven't put the first brush to him yet!'\r\n\r\nThis was too much for the gravity of Caper, who fairly roared with\r\nlaughter, and Dexter, who had listened to the talk, joining in as\r\nchorus, made the garden ring.\r\n\r\n'They are crazy,' said one old woman, who was holding a distaff in one\r\nhand, while she was making woolen thread with the other.\r\n\r\n'_Seguro_,' said another, who had once been to Rome, and therefore was\r\ngreat authority, 'they are Englis', and all the Englis' is crazy. Didn't\r\nI once live with an Englis' family? and they were that mad that they\r\nwashed themselves every day! And they had white sticks with hair on the\r\nend of them, what they scrubbed their mouth and teeth with two and three\r\ntimes a day!'\r\n\r\n'Now, Maricuccia, that is too much; what could they do that for?'\r\n\r\n'_Ma, che!_ I tell you it was so; and their maid told me it was to kill\r\nthe little devils that are always jumping in and out of the throats of\r\nall heretics.'\r\n\r\n'Santa Maria!'\r\n\r\nThe next day, after they had finished their sketch of the donkey, Caper\r\nproposed that they should oblige Margarita by giving the donkey a little\r\nof that painting the owner seemed so anxious to have bestowed on him.\r\nDexter accordingly drew bright yellow circles of cadmium and yellow\r\nochre round his eyes, giving him a peculiarly owly look; painted white\r\nrings round his tail, black streaks round his body, and touched the ends\r\nof his ears with vermilion. A more striking-looking object you never\r\nsaw; and when Margarita proudly led him forth and showed him to the\r\nsurrounding multitude, there were storms of applause for the _Inglese_\r\nwho painted donkeys!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN SUCKLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nProminent among the gay cavaliers at the court of Charles I. of England,\r\nwas Sir John Suckling, a dashing, reckless, improvident fellow, who\r\nacted the gallant to the ladies, played skillfully at bowls and deeply\r\nat cards, was always ready at a frolic and merry-making, and died when\r\nscarcely more than thirty years of age; the author of three or four\r\ndramas of no more than ordinary merit, and of a few snatches of poetry,\r\nchiefly love-songs, betraying talent sufficient to have rendered his\r\nname of no inconsiderable interest down to the present day. It is an\r\ninterest, however, growing not out of a familiarity with the\r\ncircumstances of his life and character, but from a curiosity to know a\r\nlittle more concerning one of whom, as yet, we know almost nothing at\r\nall, albeit his name is of the most familiar.\r\n\r\nMaterials for his biography are scanty enough, made up for the most part\r\nof gossip from such antiquarians as Aubrey, who imitates Herodotus, in a\r\nfondness for the marvelous and romantic, to a degree that weakens our\r\nfaith in him as a trustworthy historian. Not until the middle of the\r\npresent century were we in possession of a memoir claiming to be in any\r\nrespect complete. In 1838, there appeared in London an edition of his\r\nwritings, with a prefatory sketch of his life, by the Rev. Alfred\r\nSuckling, LL.B. The editor had access to a few private MSS., which, in\r\nour judgment, have not served to modify the previous accounts of Sir\r\nJohn's character, in spite of the labored efforts of his namesake--and,\r\nit may be, descendant--to that effect. The memoir and critical remarks\r\nappended are well written, though partial; and the work is the more\r\nvaluable for the reason that only a few hundred copies of it were\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nAll accounts agree in ascribing to Suckling, as an individual and as to\r\nhis _personnel_, the same careless and unstudied manner so conspicuous\r\nin his literary efforts. He must have expended at least a moderate\r\ndegree of labor on his dramas; all dramas require it. On the other hand,\r\nthere is hardly a doubt that he threw off his poems in the mere fancy of\r\nan idle moment, with no care for their subsequent revision; indeed, a\r\ncollected publication was not made until the lapse of four or five years\r\nafter his death. A certain vivacity and sprightliness is the secret of\r\ntheir popularity, which, from their first appearance to the present day,\r\nhas never been totally lost, though at no period could they be said to\r\nhave commanded an extensive range of readers. Previous to the collection\r\nof 1838, four or five editions of his poems, dramas, and letters had\r\nbeen published at London, at wide intervals during the last two\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nWhether Sir John Suckling was ushered into this world in 1608-9, or in\r\n1613, has never been positively ascertained, though a discrepancy of\r\nfive years would imply a state of the family record open, to say the\r\nleast, to a little free criticism. If the poet himself was aware of the\r\ncorrect date, he has not taken the trouble to enlighten the public upon\r\nit. It would be well were that public always so good-natured as to err\r\non the side of youth, giving the more credit to success, and accepting\r\ninexperience as an excuse in part for mistake and failure. But in\r\ndoubtful cases, one is likely to get credit for more years than he is\r\nfairly entitled to--a deception we are ready to believe not unpalatable\r\nsometimes to active men of early or middle age, though proverbially\r\nannoying to spinsters. There is, too, an inherent tendency among\r\nscholars toward antiquarianism, which always induces them to take the\r\nearliest possible year. In the present instance, at any rate, most\r\nauthorities favor the first date, fixing his birth at Whitton, in\r\nMiddlesex, in 1608-9.\r\n\r\nSir John Suckling, the father, had been Secretary of State under James\r\nI., and was Comptroller of the Household to Charles I. He was said to\r\nhave been a quiet, grave, and serious man, of sound judgment and good\r\nbusiness habits. Aubrey disposes of him summarily enough, with the\r\nremark that 'he was but a dull fellow.' Had his wife been of the same\r\npattern, the worthy couple might well have been astonished at the lively\r\ncapers of their progeny; but we have reason to believe that the\r\nfrolicksome courtier and poet drew upon a bountiful store of good\r\n'mother wit.' Quite all that we know of her, however, in an authentic\r\nway, is contained in a professional and curious item that the family\r\nphysician saw fit to jot down in his note-book, as follows, 'Sir John's\r\nmother went till the eleventh month with him;' which, to be sure, in\r\npopular opinion, betokened a deal of future consequence.\r\n\r\nTo the subject of our narrative is assigned the customary precocity of\r\nintellect; for he is said to have spoken Latin at five, and written it\r\nat nine. Add four years to conform with the true date, and the facts\r\nassume a little more reasonable aspect. In 1623, he was matriculated at\r\nTrinity College, Cambridge, where he remained three or four years, but\r\ndid not take a degree, probably having shown himself a little more\r\n'progressive' than the laws of that institution allowed. After leaving\r\nCambridge, he traveled over a large part of the Continent, which,\r\nbesides increasing his knowledge of the world, brought still nearer\r\nperfection that easy carriage and polished manner which had already\r\nattracted the observation of the court.\r\n\r\nWhile in Germany, he united himself to an expedition of six thousand\r\ntroops sent by Charles to the aid of Gustavus Adolphus, and was one of\r\nforty gentlemen's sons forming the body-guard of the Marquis of\r\nHamilton, who had been commissioned as General in command. He was\r\npresent at the first great victory over Tilly near Leipsic, and in other\r\nbattles and sieges. How valuable a military experience accrued from this\r\nservice we are not informed, but no great amount of it was ever\r\ndisplayed upon his return to England. When the 'League and Covenant'\r\nended in open rebellion, Suckling eagerly espoused the royal cause, and\r\naccompanied the King in his expedition against the Scots. It was the\r\ncustom for each retainer to fit out his men according to his own taste,\r\nand at his own expense. Sir John arrayed one hundred horsemen in a\r\ngorgeous attire of scarlet and white, to the admiration of the fair sex,\r\nand at the expense of twelve thousand pounds. On arriving in sight of\r\nthe enemy, it seems that they resolved not to soil their attire with\r\nsuch vulgar contact. If they had been told in the early day to follow\r\ntheir gallant leader, they obeyed the order now; for Sir John was making\r\nexcellent good time away from the field, and, as nearly as he could\r\njudge, in the direction of London. This inglorious maneuver was improved\r\nby Sir John Mennes, Rear-Admiral of the Fleet, and the author of\r\n_Musarum Deliciæ_, (who never suffered an opportunity of this kind to go\r\nby without blazing away in a lampoon;) and a jaunty song,\r\n\r\n  'Sir John he got him an ambling nag,\r\n  To Scotland for to ride--á!'\r\n\r\nbecame the delight of the town.\r\n\r\nSuckling was of slight figure and middle stature, with a face handsome\r\nand full of animation. His fine appearance, due also in part to\r\nexcellent taste in dress, made him a universal favorite at court. He was\r\nno doubt as faithful a friend as a volatile disposition would allow; a\r\nfair specimen, in short, of the elegant gentleman of the times. Aubrey\r\nspeaks of him as 'incomparable at reparteeing, the bull that was bayted,\r\nhis witt beinge most sparkling, when most set on and provoked.' His\r\nexpenditures went beyond liberality; they were extravagant. His credit\r\nwith the tradesmen soon became worthless. The greater part of his money\r\nwas made at gaming. He was one of the most skillful men of his age at\r\ncards and at bowls. So absorbed would he become in the former, that he\r\nwould often lie in bed the greater part of the day studying their\r\nvarious changes. He became notorious in an age when every one played to\r\nexcess. No one 'fought the tiger' (to borrow the modern expression) with\r\nmore indomitable pluck than Sir John; for, as his friend Will Davenant\r\ntells us, 'at his lowest ebb he would make himself glorious in apparel,\r\nand said that it exalted his spirits'--a curious philosophy, suggestive\r\nnot a little of Dickens' Mark Tapley. Pope has accused Suckling of being\r\nan 'immoral man, as well as debauched.' One is ready, with Leigh Hunt,\r\nto ask for the difference between these qualities of vice. The\r\nexplanation is, that dissipation in general was excused by the times,\r\nbut Sir John was suspected of unfair play at cards--a suspicion which\r\nappears to have rested upon a mere trifle for its foundation.\r\n\r\nIn 1641, while a member of the Long Parliament, he was found guilty by\r\nthe Commons of having assisted Lord Stafford in his attempt to escape\r\nfrom the Tower. Davenant and Jermyn were concerned in the affair.\r\nSuckling, as usual, took to his heels, and arrived safe in France. His\r\nflight was the signal for the appearance of a number of ballads about\r\nLondon. One, with forty-two wretchedly-conceived stanzas, was entitled:\r\n'A letter sent by Sir John Suckling from France, deploring his sad\r\nestate and flight, with a discoverie of the plot and conspiracie\r\nintended by him and his adherents against England.' A tolerably\r\nwell-executed engraving, on a folio sheet, was also circulated,\r\nrepresenting two cavaliers lounging among cards, dice-boxes, and\r\ndrinking-cups, and set off with wholesome Scriptural quotations, and\r\nverses in praise of the temperate.\r\n\r\n  'Hee is a frugal man indeede,\r\n    That with a leafe can dine;\r\n\r\n  'He needes no napkin for his handes,\r\n    His fingers for to wipe;\r\n  He hath his kitchen in a box,\r\n    His roast meat in a pipe.'\r\n\r\nThe title to this choice bit of satire was in staring letters:\r\n\r\n  THE SUCKLINGTON FACTION;\r\n\r\n  OR,\r\n\r\n  SUCKLING'S ROARING BOYES.\r\n\r\nAnother curiosity in the rare catalogue popular just after Sir John's\r\ndeath, was: 'A copy of two remonstrances brought over the river Stix in\r\nCaron's ferry-boate, by the ghost of Sir John Suckling.'\r\n\r\nEvery thing subsequent to his arrival in France is involved in hopeless\r\nobscurity, but the conjecture is pretty well founded that his death\r\noccurred some time during that same year. One account says that he\r\npoisoned himself at Paris. A more popular story is from letters in Lord\r\nOxford's collection, and is given both by Spence and by Oldys. Sir John\r\narrived late at night in Calais. In the morning, he found that his\r\nservant had run away with his money and papers. He called for a horse,\r\nand on drawing on his boot, felt a sharp pain, but making nothing of it\r\nin his hurry, he mounted and drove off in hot pursuit. The dishonest\r\nvalet was apprehended, and the property recovered. Then he complained,\r\nthe tale goes on to say, of pain in one of his feet; his boot was found\r\nto be full of blood. The servant had placed a nail in his master's boot,\r\nwhich had been driven into the flesh. He fainted from loss of blood,\r\nfell into a violent fever, and died in a few days. This, at least, is\r\nbelieved to be certain: that he perished in early manhood--almost before\r\ntime was given him to repent of the follies of youth--in miserable\r\nexile from the land of his birth and kindred.\r\n\r\nSuckling's literary remains, as we have already stated, consist of\r\npoems, letters, and dramas. These last-named productions were four in\r\nnumber. _Aglaura_, which was _presented at the Private House in\r\nBlackfriars by his Majesty's Servants_, is a tragedy, the scene of which\r\nis laid in Persia. This play was brought upon the stage in a style of\r\nprincely magnificence. The dresses were of rich material, profusely\r\nornamented with gold and silver, the kind indulgence of the audience,\r\nfor once, not being asked to attribute an extraordinary value to\r\nprofessional tinsel. The author is said to have laid out four hundred\r\npounds for this occasion. _Brennoralt_, also a tragedy, was first\r\npublished under the title of _The Discontented Colonel_, in 1639, as a\r\nsatire on the Scottish insurgents. _The Goblins_, a comedy in five acts,\r\nis enlivened by the presence of a motley crew of devils, clowns,\r\nwenches, and fiddlers; and an unfinished piece, entitled _The Sad One_,\r\nmay also be classed as a tragedy, as it opens briskly with a 'murder\r\nwithin' in the very first scene, which undoubtedly would have culminated\r\nin wholesale horrors had the author gone on and completed the play.\r\n\r\nWe will not stop for any minute examination of these dramas. Suffice it\r\nto say, that they are devoid of interest at the present day; and from\r\nwhat we have been able to read of them, we question whether the success\r\nthat is said to have attended their private representation was other\r\nthan mere compliment. Unfortunately for their dramatic unity, the author\r\nis impatient of the restraint which a plot imposes, and the dialogue, in\r\nconsequence, rambles off hither and thither into passages as foreign to\r\nthe subject-matter as they are tame and spiritless in expression. There\r\nare kings and princes, but they utter very commonplace remarks; and an\r\nuncommonly liberal amount of bloodshed and stage-machinery contribute to\r\nstartling incidents, but they fail to redeem the play from a tiresome\r\nmonotony.\r\n\r\nIn the prologues, we find the author more at home:\r\n\r\n  'Then, gentlemen, be thrifty--save your dooms\r\n  For the next man or the next play that comes;\r\n  For smiles are nothing where men do not care,\r\n  And frowns are little where they need not fear.'\r\n\r\n  _Aglaura: Prologue to the Court._\r\n\r\nThe following lines occur in the epilogue to the same play:\r\n\r\n  'But as, when an authentic watch is shown,\r\n  Each man winds up and rectifies his own,\r\n  So, in our very judgments,' etc.\r\n\r\nThe reader will readily call to mind the oft-quoted couplet in Pope's\r\nEssay on Criticism:\r\n\r\n  ''Tis with our judgments as our watches: none\r\n  Go just alike, yet each believes his own.'\r\n\r\nWriting prefaces, it seems, has never been a popular task with\r\nbook-makers, and playwrights have a no less weighty burden of complaint:\r\n\r\n  'Now, deuce take him that first good prologue writ:\r\n  He left a kind of rent-charge upon wit,\r\n  Which, if succeeding poets fail to pay,\r\n  They forfeit all they're worth, and that's their play.'\r\n\r\n  _Prologue to The Goblins._\r\n\r\nHis apology for the present work is ingenious:\r\n\r\n  'The richness of the ground is gone and spent.\r\n  Men's brains grow barren, and you raise the rent.'\r\n\r\n  _Ibid._\r\n\r\nA collection of about thirty letters are addressed, for the most part,\r\nto the fair sex, and sparkle with wit and gallantry. The taste that is\r\ndisplayed in them is elegant, and the style, as rapid and flowing as\r\ncorrespondence need be--_præterea nihil_. When you have perused them,\r\nyou find that nothing substantial has been said. But Suckling, with\r\npains, might have risen to superior rank as a prose writer. This is\r\nevident from _An Account of Religion by Reason_, a _brochure_ presented\r\nto the Earl of Dorset, wherein his perspicuous style appears to good\r\nadvantage, joined with well-digested thought and argument.\r\n\r\nBut it is Suckling's poems that have been best known and most admired.\r\nThe school that flourished in this age, and devoted its muse to gay and\r\namorous poetry, was but a natural reaction from the stern, harsh views\r\nof the Puritan, who despised and condemned _belles lettres_ as the\r\nwickedness of sin and folly. Suckling's poems are few in number, and,\r\nwith rare exceptions, are all brief. The most lengthy is the _Sessions\r\nof the Poets_, a satire upon the poets of his day, from rare Ben Jonson,\r\nwith Carew and Davenant, down to those of less note--\r\n\r\n  'Selwin and Walter, and Bartlett both the brothers,\r\n  Jack Vaughan, and Porter, and divers others.'\r\n\r\nThe versification is defective, but the satire is piquant, and no doubt\r\ndiscriminating and just. At any rate, what the poet says of himself hits\r\nthe truth nearer than confessions commonly do:\r\n\r\n  'Suckling next was called, but did not appear;\r\n  But straight one whispered Apollo i' the ear,\r\n  That of all men living he cared not for't--\r\n  He loved not the muses so well as his sport;\r\n  And prized black eyes, or a lucky hit\r\n  At bowls, above all the trophies of wit.'\r\n\r\nIn Suckling's love-songs we discover the brilliancy of Sedley, the\r\n_abandon_ of Rochester, (though hardly carried to so scandalous an\r\nextreme) and a strength and fervor which, with care for the minor\r\nmatters of versification and melody, might have equaled or even\r\nsurpassed the best strains of Herrick. In a complaint that his mistress\r\nwill not return her heart for his that she has stolen, he says:\r\n\r\n  'I prithee send me back my heart,\r\n     Since I can not have thine;\r\n  For if from yours you will not part,\r\n     Why, then, shouldst thou have mine?\r\n\r\n  'Yet, now I think on't, let it lie;\r\n     To find it were in vain:\r\n  For thou'st a thief in either eye\r\n     Would steal it back again.'\r\n\r\nThe following, which has always been a favorite, was originally sung by\r\nOrsames in _Aglaura_, who figures in the _dramatis personæ_ as an\r\n'anti-Platonic young lord':\r\n\r\n  'Why so pale and wan, fond lover?\r\n       Prithee, why so pale?\r\n  Will, when looking well can't move her,\r\n       Looking ill prevail?\r\n       Prithee, why so pale?\r\n\r\n  'Why so dull and mute, young sinner?\r\n       Prithee, why so mute?\r\n  Will, when speaking well can't win her,\r\n       Saying nothing do't?\r\n       Prithee, why so mute?\r\n\r\n  'Quit, quit, for shame; this will not move,\r\n         This can not take her;\r\n  If of herself she will not love,\r\n         Nothing can make her--\r\n         The devil take her!'\r\n\r\nWe are tempted to add still another, which, to our taste, is the best of\r\nhis songs. A faulty versification deserves censure in all of them:\r\n\r\n  'Hast thou seen the down in the air,\r\n     When wanton blasts have tossed it?\r\n  Or the ship on the sea,\r\n     When ruder winds have crossed it?\r\n  Hast thou marked the crocodile's weeping,\r\n     Or the fox's sleeping?\r\n  Or hast thou viewed the peacock in his pride,\r\n     Or the dove by his bride,\r\n  When he courts her for his lechery?\r\n  Oh! so fickle, oh! so vain, oh! so false, so false is she!'\r\n\r\nLove has been compared to a variety of objects, all of them with more or\r\nless aptness. When some one likened it to a potato, because it 'shoots\r\nfrom the eyes,' was it not Byron who was wicked enough to add, 'and\r\nbecause it becomes all the less by pairing'? One wretched swain tells us\r\nthat he finds it to be\r\n\r\n                     '----a dizziness,\r\n  That will not let an honest man go about his business.'\r\n\r\nBut no similitude can be more striking or more lasting than that of love\r\nto a state of debt. So long as human nature continues materially the\r\nsame, these words, of four letters each, will express sensations pretty\r\nnearly identical. The ease with which a poor creature falls into one or\r\nthe other of these snares, is all the more remarkable from the\r\ndifficulty which he is sure to encounter in his attempts at getting out.\r\nBesides, is not love sometimes a real debit and credit account? But, not\r\nto pursue the interesting inquiry further, we submit that there is good\r\nsense, as well as good poetry, (does the latter always insure the\r\npresence of the former?) in the lines we quote, which Sir John has\r\nlabeled _Love and Debt alike Troublesome_:\r\n\r\n  'This one request I make to him that sits the clouds above:\r\n  That I were freely out of debt, as I am out of love;\r\n  Then for to dance, to drink, and sing, I should be very willing--\r\n  I should not owe one lass a kiss, nor ne'er a knave a shilling.\r\n  'Tis only being in love and debt that breaks us of our rest,\r\n  And he that is quite out of both, of all the world is blest;\r\n  He sees the golden age wherein all things were free and common,\r\n  He eats, he drinks, he takes his rest, he fears no man nor woman.\r\n  Though Croesus compassed great wealth, yet he still craved more;\r\n  He was as needy a beggar still as goes from door to door.\r\n  Though Ovid was a merry man, love ever kept him sad;\r\n  He was as far from happiness as one that is stark mad.\r\n  Our merchant, he in goods is rich, and full of gold and treasure;\r\n  But when he thinks upon his debts, that thought destroys his pleasure.\r\n  Our courtier thinks that he's preferred, whom every man envies;\r\n  When love so rumbles in his pate, no sleep comes in his eyes.\r\n  Our gallant's case is worst of all--he lies so just betwixt them:\r\n  For he's in love, and he's in debt, and knows not which most vex him!'\r\n\r\nThe _Metamorphose_ is forcible, perhaps it has more force and wit than\r\nelegance. The occasion may be where Sir John has for once shown himself\r\na 'constant lover':\r\n\r\n  'The little boy, to show his might and power,\r\n  Turned Io to a cow, Narcissus to a flower;\r\n  Transformed Apollo to a homely swain,\r\n  And Jove himself into a golden rain.\r\n  These shapes were tolerable; but by the mass,\r\n  He's metamorphosed me into an ass!'\r\n\r\nThere is no hesitancy in pronouncing which of Suckling's poetic pieces\r\nshould be called the best. It is the _Ballad upon a Wedding_. For ease\r\nand jocoseness of description it stands almost unapproachable. Of\r\ncourse, many other such productions may show equal fidelity to nature;\r\nand there is a small class of poems which may boast a vein of the same\r\nsparkling humor; but it would be difficult--we were ready to say\r\nimpossible--to cite another instance of so exquisite a commingling of\r\nthese two elements.\r\n\r\nIt requires a master-hand, it must be remembered, to harmonize these\r\ntouches of playful fancy with what the poet is obliged to recognize as\r\nfacts in nature. A tyro in the art is likely to transcend nature and\r\nalter a little things as he finds them, when he wishes to indulge in\r\nsportive recreation. Something well out of the common course must be\r\nlaid hold on to excite that pleasant feeling of surprise which lies at\r\nthe foundation of wit, if not of humor. Every one knows how much easier\r\nit is to call forth mirth by caricature than by simple truth; nor need\r\nit be added that while the former leaves but a momentary impression, the\r\nlatter abides longer and seldom tires. Broad farce is rewarded by the\r\ntremendous applause of the gallery, but the pit and boxes confess to a\r\ndeal more gratification in the quiet humor of an old comedy. This ballad\r\ndisplays all the vivacity and humor of light comedy, though we miss the\r\nvirtue-inculcating moral at the close. We fear that we have already\r\ntrespassed too far over the limits of a magazine article. We append only\r\na part of this _chef d'oeuvre:_\r\n\r\n  'I tell thee, Dick, where I have been,\r\n  Where I the rarest sights have seen;\r\n    Oh! things without compare!\r\n  Such sights again can not be found\r\n  In any place on English ground,\r\n    Be it at wake or fair.\r\n\r\n  'At Charing Cross, hard by the way\r\n  Where we (thou know'st) do sell our hay,\r\n    There is a house with stairs;\r\n  And there did I see coming down\r\n  Such folk as are not in our town,\r\n    Forty at least, in pairs.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'The maid, and thereby hangs a tale,\r\n  For such a maid no Whitsun'-ale\r\n    Could ever yet produce:\r\n  No grape that's kindly ripe could be\r\n  So round, so plump, so soft as she,\r\n    Nor half so full of juice.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'Her feet beneath her petticoat,\r\n  Like little mice stole in and out,\r\n    As if they feared the light:\r\n  But oh! she dances such a way!\r\n  No sun upon an Easter-day\r\n    Is half so fine a sight.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'Her cheeks, so rare a white was on,\r\n  No daisy makes comparison;\r\n    Who sees them is undone;\r\n  For streaks of red were mingled there.\r\n  Such as are on a Catherine pear,\r\n    The side that's next the sun.\r\n\r\n  'Her lips were red; and one was thin,\r\n  Compared to that was next her chin,\r\n    Some bee had stung it newly;\r\n  But, Dick, her eyes so guard her face,\r\n  I durst no more upon them gaze,\r\n    Than on the sun in July.\r\n\r\n  'Her mouth so small when she doth speak,\r\n  Thou'dst swear her teeth her words did break,\r\n    That they might passage get;\r\n  But she so handled still the matter,\r\n  They came as good as ours, or better,\r\n    And are not spent a whit.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'Passion, O me! how I run on;\r\n  There's that that would be thought upon,\r\n    I trow, beside the bride:\r\n  The business of the kitchen's great,\r\n  For it is fit that men should eat;\r\n    Nor was it there denied.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  'Now hats fly off, and youths carouse;\r\n  Healths first go round, and then the house,\r\n    The bride's came thick and thick;\r\n  And when 'twas named another's health,\r\n  Perhaps he made it hers by stealth;\r\n    And who could help it, Dick?\r\n\r\n  'O' th' sudden up they rise and dance;\r\n  Then sit again and sigh and glance;\r\n    Then dance again and kiss.\r\n  Thus sev'ral ways the time did pass,\r\n  Till every woman wished her place,\r\n    And every man wished his.\r\n\r\n  'By this time all were stolen aside\r\n  To counsel and undress the bride;\r\n    But that he must not know--\r\n  But yet 'twas thought he guessed her mind,\r\n  And did not mean to stay behind\r\n    Above an hour or so.'\r\n\r\nWhat can be finer than the verse commencing, 'Her feet beneath her\r\npetticoat,' or that which follows: 'Her cheeks,' etc.? That Suckling\r\ncould write like this, proves that there was in him the dawning of no\r\nordinary genius. He challenges our admiration, not so much for what he\r\nhas done, as for what he might have done, had his life been spared. Or\r\nwe should say, rather, what he might have done had he devoted half as\r\nmuch of the life that was granted him to literary labors, as he did to\r\npleasure and dissipation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BULL.\r\n\r\n  I hear a voice you can not hear,\r\n    Which says it will not pay;\r\n  I see a hand you can not see,\r\n    Which motions t'other way.\r\n  The thumb is horizontalized,\r\n    The fingers perpendic'lar,\r\n  And scorn for you seems giving there\r\n    A motion quite partic'lar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON FOGS AND LONDON POOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI first saw London on a morning late in November; or, it will be more\r\ncorrect to say that I should have seen it, if a dense fog had not\r\nconcealed every thing that belonged to it, wharves, warehouses,\r\nchurches, St. Paul's, the Tower, the Monument, the Custom-House, the\r\nshipping, the river, and the bridge that spanned it. We made our dock in\r\nthe Thames at an early hour, before I was dressed for landing, and by\r\nthe time I had hurried upon deck to cast the first eager glance around,\r\nthe fog had descended, shutting all things from view. A big, looming\r\n_something_ was receding as I gained the top of the companion-ladder,\r\nand faded altogether before I could attach to it any distinct idea. But\r\nthe great heart of the city was beating, and where I stood its throbbing\r\nwas distinctly audible. A hum, in which all sounds were blended, a\r\nconfused roar of the human ocean that rolled around me, fell with\r\nstrange effect upon my ear, accustomed for nearly five weeks only to the\r\nnoises peculiar to shipboard.\r\n\r\nCertainly the fog did not afford me a cheering welcome. It was denser\r\nand dirtier than the fogs we had encountered off the banks of\r\nNewfoundland, and more chilling and disagreeable to the human frame. It\r\ndid not disperse the whole day. What with the difficulty that attended\r\nour landing, and the long delay consequent upon the very dilatory\r\nmovements of the Custom-House officers, the night had fairly closed\r\nin--it did not add much to the darkness--before I was _en route_ to an\r\nhotel. A Scotch fellow-passenger, who had maintained a sullen reserve\r\nthroughout the voyage, which ought to have placed me on my guard against\r\nhim, had attached himself to me during our troubles at the Custom-House,\r\nand now joined with us all in loud rebuke of the sluggish motions and\r\nrude behavior of the officers. He knew that I was a stranger, and with a\r\nshow of cordiality, for which I was very thankful, he invited me to\r\naccompany him to a quiet, respectable hotel, where the charges were not\r\nexorbitant. As his proposal suited my purse and my humor, I acquiesced\r\nwillingly enough, little suspecting into what hands I had fallen. In\r\nless than an hour we were seated at a capital dinner, the best that I\r\never remembered to have eaten, so exquisite is the relish imparted by a\r\nkeen appetite to the first meal one gets on shore after a long\r\nsea-voyage.\r\n\r\nWe were wearied with the day's annoyances, and as the streets were very\r\nuninviting, we sat smoking segars in the coffee-room of the\r\nestablishment. As one person after another dropped in, we heard of the\r\nincrease of the fog outside, and, indeed, it had long since entered and\r\nfilled the apartment till the outline of the waiter, as he moved to and\r\nfro in supplying the wants of the company, became indistinct, and his\r\nhead, whenever he approached the chandelier, radiated a glory. As I had\r\noften read of a London fog in November, I judged this to be an excellent\r\nopportunity for seeing one, and accepted my companion's proposal to\r\nrepair to the door of the hotel. The scene was like nothing else I ever\r\nhad witnessed. At the distance of five yards the light of a gas-lamp was\r\ninvisible. We could not distinguish each other's features as we stood\r\nside by side. Stages, cabs, and coaches were creeping forward at the\r\nrate of twenty yards in a minute, the drivers carrying glaring torches,\r\nand leading the horses by their bridles. Even at this pace the danger of\r\na collision was imminent. Pedestrians, homeward bound, were at their\r\nwits' end. As they could not have proceeded fifty paces in security\r\nwithout a torch, they were each provided with one, but some of them\r\ncontrived to lose their way notwithstanding, and seeing us on the steps\r\nof the hotel, halted to make inquiries. One man assured us that he had\r\nbeen half an hour looking for the next street. The better to convince\r\nmyself of the density of the mist, I extended my arm to its full length\r\nand tried to count my fingers. From ocular evidence alone, I certainly\r\ncould not have told whether I had four, five, or six.\r\n\r\nIt was an amusing sight to see scores of ragged boys carrying about\r\ntorches for sale. The cry of 'Links! links!' resounded on all sides.\r\n'Light you home for sixpence, sir,' said one of them, as I stood\r\nwatching their operations. 'If 'tan't far,' he added, presently, 'I'll\r\nlight you for a Joey.' A Joey is the flash term for a four-penny piece,\r\nor eight cents of our money, and is so called because these silver\r\ncoins, somewhat larger than a half-dime, are said to owe their origin to\r\nMr. Joseph Hume. We witnessed a bargain struck between one of these\r\nurchins and a servant-girl, who imprudently yielded to his demand to\r\nhave the money in advance. No sooner had the young rogue conveyed it to\r\nhis pocket than he ran off to seek another customer as simple, leaving\r\nthe poor girl to strike a wiser bargain on the next occasion.\r\n\r\nThat I might fairly appreciate the character of the fog, my companion\r\nproposed that we should 'put off into the unknown dark.' Not till I had\r\ngot into the street, and was groping my way among the pedestrians,\r\ninstead of watching them in security from the topmost of a flight of\r\nsteps, could I estimate its real nature. To my bewildered eyes it had\r\nthe appearance of a solid wall constantly opposing our further progress.\r\nThe blazing torches that we met were invisible at fifty yards' distance.\r\nThe tradesmen had closed their stores from fear of thieves, who are\r\nremarkably active at such seasons. I afterward learned that in one of\r\nthe leading thoroughfares a vender of hams and bacon, who had a quantity\r\nof goods exposed in front of his open store, was robbed in a most daring\r\nmanner at an early hour of the evening. The thieves drove a cart to his\r\ndoor, and had nearly filled the vehicle with spoil before they were\r\nobserved. The tradesman rushed into the street, but the villains had\r\nurged on the horse, and although he heard the noise of the wheels,\r\npursuit was an utter impossibility. Robberies on the person are of\r\nfrequent occurrence at such times, even in the most crowded streets, the\r\nsecurity with which the thief attacks a single individual rendering his\r\naudacity almost incredible. Before assistance can arrive he has darted\r\nacross the road, and is in safety at a few yards' distance from the\r\nscene of his violence.\r\n\r\nWe were about a quarter of a mile from the hotel, and were on the point\r\nof retracing our steps when a cry of 'Fire!' was raised in our vicinity,\r\nfollowed by a rush of several persons in the direction from which the\r\nalarm proceeded. In a few minutes all the torches in the street seemed\r\nto be collected in one spot, and the crowd grew rapidly. I expected to\r\nhear the fire-bell, but I was told that the Londoners have no alarm-bell\r\nof any kind. The glare of a conflagration is usually the first warning\r\nconveyed to the firemen, when instantly a score of engines are turned\r\nout, horses, that are always kept ready harnessed, are fastened to the\r\nshafts, and away they go, pell-mell, through the streets, every vehicle,\r\nto the Lord Mayor's or Prime Minister's carriage, being compelled to\r\ndraw aside and give them room to pass. On this occasion their services\r\nwere not required, the fire being confined to the basement-story of the\r\nbuilding in which it had originated, and extinguished by the exertions\r\nof the inmates before any material injury was sustained. The crowd that\r\nhad collected was not a small one, and the congregation of so many\r\ntorches dispelled in part the oppressive gloom of the fog. But when they\r\nhad dispersed, and the unnatural darkness was made more palpable by the\r\nsudden contrast effected by the withdrawal of such a glare of light, I\r\nfound that my companion had disappeared. Once I fancied that my name was\r\ncalled, and I thought that he was perhaps searching for me in a wrong\r\ndirection. I ran, as I conjectured, in pursuit of his retreating\r\nfootsteps, but was soon abruptly brought to a halt by a wall, against\r\nwhich I nearly dashed myself with a force that would have stunned me. Of\r\nthe name of the hotel, or even of the street on which it was situated, I\r\nwas utterly ignorant, and as the climax of my difficulty, I discovered\r\nthat all the money I had in my pocket was a fifty-cent piece that I had\r\nbrought from New-York. I attempted to buy a torch of a boy, but I could\r\nnot persuade him that my half-dollar, though it was not current money,\r\nwas worth much more than an English sixpence, valued as old silver. He\r\nevidently regarded me as an improper character, and refused to deal with\r\nme. I detained the first man I met, and explained my situation, but as I\r\ncould give him no clue to the whereabouts of the hotel, he could furnish\r\nme no assistance. As nearly as I could conjecture, it was within half a\r\nmile of the spot where I was standing, but I could not indicate the\r\ndirection, 'There are fifty hotels,' he said, 'within that distance,\r\ntaking the sweep of the compass.'\r\n\r\nI now began seriously to fear that I should have to pass the night in\r\nthe streets. My clothes were already moist with the fog, and I knew that\r\nbefore morning they must be saturated. A policeman, who chanced to pass\r\nat this juncture, recommended me to obtain a bed at the nearest inn, and\r\nto renew my search in the morning. Then arose the difficulty about the\r\nmoney; but as it occurred to me that I could leave my watch in charge of\r\nthe landlord as security for the payment of my expenses, I decided to\r\naccompany him to an inn in the neighborhood, to which he undertook to\r\nguide me. It was an indifferent place, being one of the gin-palaces for\r\nwhich London is famous, but I was content, under the circumstances, to\r\nremain there. The landlord, having examined my watch, and being\r\nsatisfied that it would cover all reasonable charges, if I never\r\nreappeared to claim it, conferred with his wife respecting her domestic\r\narrangements. It was not usual, he told me, personally, for him to let\r\nbeds at such a late hour to strangers, but he thought I could be\r\naccommodated. The policeman's satisfaction was very cordially expressed,\r\nand as he lingered at my elbow, and significantly remarked that the fog\r\nhad got into his throat, I ordered him a glass of warm brandy and water,\r\nfor which he bowed acknowledgments. He was dressed, I noticed, in the\r\nlivery with which the engravings in Punch have made our public familiar.\r\nHe asked me several questions about the police in New-York, complained\r\nthat it was impossible for a man to live decently in England, and\r\nremarked that 'if it weren't for the knocking-up money, a policeman in\r\nLondon couldn't do it nohow.' I inquired what he meant by 'knocking-up\r\nmoney,' and was informed that it was the custom in London, and in all\r\nthe large towns, for laboring men, who had to rise to their work at an\r\nearly hour, to pay a small sum weekly to the policeman in whose 'beat'\r\nthey resided, for knocking loudly at their doors in the morning to\r\nawaken them. It is usual for policemen to add several shillings to their\r\nweekly wages by this practice, and it is so far recognized by the\r\nregulations of the force, that men who have slightly misconducted\r\nthemselves are punished by being removed from a 'beat' where there is a\r\ngreat deal of 'knocking-up' to be performed, and transferred to a more\r\nrespectable quarter of the town, where the inhabitants are not compelled\r\nto rise until they choose.\r\n\r\nI had leisure before the arrangements for my night's repose were\r\nconcluded, to contemplate the novel scene which the interior of the\r\ngin-palace presented. Many of our Broadway liquor-stores are, in point\r\nof gilding and decoration, equally splendid, but there all resemblance\r\nceases. Behind the spacious bar stood immense vats containing whole\r\nhogsheads of ardent spirits. These were elevated on a pedestal about\r\nfour feet from the floor, and reached to the lofty ceiling. Their\r\ncontents were gin, whisky, rum, and brandy, of various standards.\r\nOthers of a somewhat smaller size contained port, sherry, and Madeira\r\nwines, or the adulterations which pass by their names, with an\r\nundiscriminating public. When these vats were empty, they were filled\r\nfrom barrels in the cellars beneath by means of a force-pump.\r\n\r\nThe customers at the bar were of a motley description. There were many\r\nfemales among them, mostly girls of the town, who were swallowing\r\nundiluted drams of gin and peppermint. Pallid mechanics and their wives,\r\nthe latter sometimes bearing young children in their arms, exhibited\r\nvarying degrees of drunkenness, from the hilarious or maudlin state to\r\nthat of rolling intoxication. Even children, whose size was so\r\ndiminutive that they had to stand on tiptoe to elevate their heads above\r\nthe counter, demanded and received their liquor, imbibing the burning\r\nfluid with eyes that sparkled delight. I was in the temple of the\r\ngin-fiend, and the crowd around me were his daily devotees.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when I awoke I hastened to the window of my room. The\r\nopposite houses were visible, and the ordinary traffic of the streets\r\nwas not impeded. A drizzling rain was falling, and pedestrians waded\r\nankle deep in slush and mud. The fog, though partially dispelled,\r\nbrooded over the house-tops, and concealed the chimneys. All the stores\r\nwere lighted with gas, and one could well imagine that the sun had never\r\nshone in that dismal climate.\r\n\r\nThe landlord readily consented to advance me a pound sterling on my\r\nwatch, and without stopping to take breakfast, I plunged into the miry\r\nstreets. I was at a loss what course to pursue. The fog of the previous\r\nevening had prevented my noticing any of the external features of the\r\nhotel in which I had dined with my Scotch acquaintance, and where my\r\ntrunks, that contained all the money for my travels, and the\r\nintroductory letters that were essential to the purpose for which I had\r\nvisited Europe, were deposited. The house in which I had passed the\r\nnight was situated in St. Martin's Lane, and a radius thrown out from\r\nthat centre would, in some quarter, touch the hotel at a distance of\r\nhalf a mile or thereabout. I was sure of that, as of one ascertained\r\nfact, but I had no other clue to guide my footsteps.\r\n\r\nI know not how many hotels I entered during that day. The night, I know,\r\nhad closed in, and found me a denizen of the streets, splashed with mud\r\nto the collar of my coat, and worn out with fatigue. At night I got a\r\nbed at a small coffee-house, for I saw that it would be necessary to\r\neconomize the few shillings that I had in my possession. The sun was\r\nreally shining the next morning, when I breakfasted, and the landlord\r\nspoke of the blue sky, remarking that the day would be a fine one. To my\r\napprehension the sky was _gray_, which is, indeed, almost always the\r\ncolor of the English sky at all seasons. From the _Post-Office\r\nDirectory_, which I found at the coffee-house, I copied a list of all\r\nthe hotels within half a mile of St. Martin's Lane. Entering one of\r\nthese about noon--it was situated in Rupert street--I recognized the\r\nfirst waiter who presented himself. I thought it strange that he did not\r\nseem surprised at my appearance, or allude to my enforced absence, but\r\nupon inquiring for the Scotchman, I was utterly confounded by his reply:\r\n'Oh! the gentleman that dined with you, sir, the day before yesterday.\r\nHe went away yesterday, sir, and took your trunks with him.'\r\n\r\n'Took my trunks with him!' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n'Yes, sir; he said that you had gone on to Birmingham, by the\r\nmail-train, and that he was to follow with the luggage.'\r\n\r\nI almost reeled at the intelligence. The perfidy of the Scotchman was\r\nmanifest. He had taken me into the fog to lose me, and while I was\r\npicturing his dismay at the accident which had separated us, and his\r\nanxiety on my account, the scoundrel was appropriating my trunks and\r\nvalises. I hastened to confer with the proprietor of the hotel\r\nrespecting the step which it would be best to take. He was a very\r\nrespectable man, and was sincerely grieved for my loss.\r\n\r\n'We will go to Scotland Yard immediately,' he said, 'and acquaint the\r\nChief of Police.'\r\n\r\nMy money, my letters, every thing that stood between me and beggary were\r\nin the purloined trunks. The landlord told me to regard his house as my\r\nhome. The police-officer heard my story patiently, but seemed to think\r\nthat the chance of getting back the trunks was a small one. And the\r\nsequel proved he was right.\r\n\r\nAltogether, I resided fifteen months in London, and the present record\r\nwill consist of my later and more matured impressions. An American who\r\nhas never seen this metropolis can have but a faint idea of it. A fair\r\ndistribution of the houses would cover Manhattan Island. Two of its\r\nparks contain some square miles of pleasure-ground, and the smallest of\r\nfive would clear New-York of buildings from the City Hall to the\r\nBattery. It is indeed a mammoth city. The ancient suburbs of\r\nWestminster, Southwark, Lambeth, Chelsea, Islington, Pentonville,\r\nShoreditch, Hackney, Whitechapel, Limehouse, Rotherhithe, with the\r\nmodern Pimlico, Knightsbridge, Old and New Brompton, Bayswater,\r\nPaddington, St. John's Wood, Camden Town, Somer's Town, Kingsland,\r\nCamberwell, and many more, are now united with it, and make it by far\r\nthe largest city in the world. Starting from almost any point of its\r\nextreme boundary, and traversing the city till you reach the opposite\r\nboundary--as from Brompton to Hackney--you will walk nine miles nearly\r\nin a straight line without quitting the pavement. I was disappointed in\r\nmany of the public buildings; I would be understood, however, to refer\r\nto them only as works of architecture, for to the interest attaching to\r\ntheir historical associations I could not be insensible. Protestantism\r\nhas built no churches. St. Paul's is its best effort, and that is a\r\nfailure. It is, indeed, a wonderful building, considered _per se_, but\r\ncompare it with the Continental cathedrals, or with York Minster. I must\r\nown that the shameful exaction of money at the doors created a feeling\r\nof dissatisfaction which, perhaps, in some measure transferred itself to\r\nthe edifice. The English are the only people who are so mercenary as to\r\ncharge for admission to their temples, and the man who guards the door\r\nof St. Paul's is one of the worst specimens of his class. I paid\r\ncheerfully a dollar and a quarter to see a play of Shakspeare's\r\nperformed at the Haymarket Theatre, but I grudged the four cents that I\r\ndropped into the exacting palm of the rubicund janitor of St. Paul's,\r\n'Tis a vile system. They sell the memories of their famous heroes, of\r\ntheir philosophers and poets, by making a raree-show of their tombs. A\r\nnation should have free access to the hallowed spots where rest the\r\nashes of its mightiest dead. St. Paul's, Westminster Abbey, and all such\r\nbuildings, should be free as the streets to decent people, for genius\r\nreceives inspiration at such altars, and men fresh from the commonplace\r\nof every-day life rub off the rust of the world in the holy and awful\r\ncalm of these and kindred sanctuaries. How venerable would they appear\r\nto the American, if they were not markets of gain and greed to their\r\nclerical proprietors! The poets whose tombs are the chief attraction in\r\nWestminster Abbey are not foreigners to the Anglo-Saxon race of the New\r\nWorld. We, too, claim a property in their works. Our forefathers were\r\ncotemporaries with Shakspeare, Spenser, and Milton, inhabited the same\r\nland, breathed the same air, were subject to the same laws; and we speak\r\nto-day the language of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Tennyson. We have, I\r\ninsist, a claim on the glorious memories that give renown to England;\r\nand the avarice that bars the gates of her abbeys and cathedrals against\r\nthe poor, is a disgrace to a great nation.\r\n\r\nThere has been lately a report that St. Paul's had grown ashamed of its\r\ngreediness, and Westminster Abbey has at length really admitted the\r\npublic without demanding its sixpences--admitted, that is, to a large\r\nportion of the building, but not to the whole. The mausoleums of the\r\nkings are still worthy, in the opinion of the Dean and Chapter, of some\r\nsilver coins sterling. Let them remain so. We are not especially anxious\r\nto do homage to _them_. The intellectually great of England are worthy\r\nof much--sometimes of all reverence; her kings of very little, or of\r\nnone. But St. Paul's is closed still, notwithstanding the report of free\r\nadmission which recently agitated the public of London. Nelson's\r\nsepulchre is worth some score of pounds sterling per annum. Dr.\r\nJohnson's statue can be seen any day for twopence, which is tenpence\r\nless than Madame Tassaud charges for admission to her wax effigies, and\r\nmust therefore be considered cheap.\r\n\r\nAn American is astonished at the number of beggars in every city of\r\nEngland. Even the small towns and the smallest villages have them. Their\r\nnumbers in London are roundly estimated at one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand. You meet them every where. They are, in some quarters, like\r\nthe paving-stones of the street--eternally present. There are artists in\r\ncolored chalks, who limn the heads of Christ and Napoleon on the\r\npavement, with the inscription: 'I am starving.' Very fairly are the\r\nportraits executed; very decent artists they are, and they grovel by the\r\nside of their handiwork in an attitude of broken-hearted despondency,\r\nand pocket the pennies of the charitable. Objects the most decrepit in\r\nnature, hideous, half-nude wretches, male and female, creep along the\r\nstreets, shivering, too evidently starving, till your heart aches at the\r\nspectacle, and you deprive yourself of your last cent to administer\r\nrelief. These are impostors. So are the respectable class--the\r\nbroken-down tradesmen, who, in a suit of decent black Saxony cloth, and\r\nwearing a spotless white kerchief around their necks, offer lead-pencils\r\nfor sale. So respectable are they, that you start to see them, and are\r\nalmost ashamed to offer them a dollar; but they will accept a cent, and\r\nwill ply the same trade for years to come, in a suit equally as\r\nrespectable. It is one of the mysteries connected with them, that their\r\nclothes never wear out. I grew familiar with the features of one of\r\nthese respectable men, from seeing him almost daily in some quarter of\r\nLondon. During the twelve months that I kept my eye upon him, the\r\ncondition of his apparel was unchanged. His coat never got old, nor did\r\nhe ever have a new one. That man is at this moment an unpleasant puzzle\r\nto me--a conundrum without a solution. The income of this class of\r\nbeggars, I was told, is considerable--much better than a clerk's in\r\nLombard or Wall street.\r\n\r\nThe lodging-houses of the lowest class of professed beggars, who do not\r\ntrade on assumed respectability, or make a pretense of having once been\r\nbetter off, present to an American a spectacle, or chapter of\r\nspectacles, of which he can previously have no conception. They are\r\nsituated in the most densely crowded and dirtiest quarters of the town,\r\nand are approached through lanes of the most noisome filth. No\r\ncomparison holds good with any quarter of Boston, New-York,\r\nPhiladelphia, or any city of the Union, for there is nothing in our\r\ncities to compare with them. Let us enter one of them. The common\r\nboarding-room, in which meals are taken, is about forty feet long by\r\ntwenty broad. Either the floor has never been paved, or a thick layer of\r\nstreet-soil has hidden the stones for many a day past. Along each side\r\nof a long, narrow table, runs a wooden bench of rough construction,\r\nwhich is the only seat the place affords. The knives and forks are\r\nchained to the table. Strange implements they are, and a thief, one\r\nwould think, must be reduced to shifts indeed if they could offer him a\r\ntemptation. Almost every fork has lost one of its prongs, and every\r\nknife has been notched or otherwise abused. The plaster has mostly\r\nfallen from the walls of the room, the very laths are cut away, and the\r\nnaked bricks and rude masonry are exposed. The ceiling is blackened with\r\nthe tobacco-smoke of years, ascending every night from a hundred pipes.\r\nThe filth that accumulates is seldom cleared away, but is swept into\r\nheaps in the corners, and remains there perhaps for weeks. A stench\r\npervades the place, and a horrible moisture settles upon the walls. The\r\nroom every night has the appearance of a market-place, where beggars\r\nvend and where beggars are the purchasers. From the roof a dim light is\r\nsuspended, and candles stuck into glass bottles are placed upon the\r\ntable. The daily contributions of the benevolent are here disposed of;\r\nwhat one has, another lacks. Old coats, old boots and shoes, old gowns,\r\nare freely bartered for tobacco and gin. Women from neighboring\r\nrag-shops attend to buy, and candle-makers send their agents to collect\r\nfat and grease. Every individual brings his own food, for the proprietor\r\nof the house finds lodging only, and not board. The atmosphere reeks\r\nwith the smell of herrings and fried sausages. After supper is finished,\r\na fiddler--one of their number, paid for his services by contributions\r\nof tobacco and beer--strikes up some merry music; dancing commences, and\r\ngoes on till midnight, and often far into the morning. Save in such\r\nhouses, such dancing and such dancers were never seen. The lame cast\r\naside their crutches, the blind regain their sight, the paralyzed are\r\nalert and nimble, the trampers of every species jig in turn, or\r\naltogether, shaking their rags unto the jocund tune; and where is there\r\na blither party? Burns has pictured the scene in his 'Jolly Beggars,'\r\nand he is the laureate of the night.\r\n\r\nWould you know what kind of dormitories these people resort to when\r\ntheir dancing is finished? I will describe one out of many that I saw,\r\nwhich will serve as a specimen of the rest. Let us ascend the rickety\r\nstaircase. The atmosphere is intolerably foul, and you feel that a\r\nweek's confinement in such a den would cause your death. Well, these are\r\nthe beds; a heap of straw, matted with long service, and a filthily foul\r\nrug for a coverlet. The sleepers have no other covering, in summer or\r\nwinter. These beds change their occupants, perhaps, every night; for a\r\ntramper seldom sleeps two consecutive nights in the same place. Do not\r\napproach too near, for they are alive with loathsome vermin. There are\r\ntwenty-five beds in a room thirty feet by fourteen, and in each bed two\r\nand sometimes three persons are placed. When the landlord is doing a\r\ngood business, he puts three lodgers in each bed. Seventy-five sleepers\r\nin that confined space! For such accommodation the charge is six cents\r\nper night. And this is quite a respectable lodging-house. There are\r\nfour-cent lodging-houses, where there is only straw without any\r\ncovering; and there are three-cent houses, where there is no straw even,\r\nbut only bare boards rotting beneath a crustation of dirt and filth,\r\nwhich is never washed off.\r\n\r\nThe frequenters of these places are professed beggars; and although\r\ntheir sufferings are at times great, they must not be classed with the\r\ndeserving poor. You will see the latter lingering at the doors of\r\nwork-houses. I have seen some two hundred of them on a winter's evening,\r\nwhen the frost has sharply bound up the lakes in the parks and the\r\nfountains in Trafalgar Square, shivering in semi-nudity on the bare and\r\nbitter pavement, waiting for admission. The houses of the rich--where\r\nlap-dogs were fed on hot and savory steaks, or even on daintier\r\npoultry--were standing around, and the heavens were as brass to the\r\nwails of the wretched crowd. I have been fairly staggered at such\r\nsights. I remember that one occasion a man dropped dead in the street\r\nwhere I was, while on his way to the workhouse, and it was found upon\r\ninquiry that he was really starved to death.\r\n\r\nThey sit and lie before the work-houses, at such times, huddled almost\r\nupon one another, and forming such groups of hungry, squalid, and\r\ndegraded human beings, as no painter would venture to transfer from life\r\nto canvas. Of the number that apply for admission, one half will be\r\nrejected, who must shelter themselves under the dry arches of the\r\nbridges, or creep into hidden doorways, up narrow alleys, where the\r\npolice are not likely to find them. For if found, they would be seized\r\nand taken before a magistrate, to be punished for being homeless and\r\nwithout food. Many of them do not dread this punishment, but will seek\r\nto deserve it by more criminal conditions than enforced indigence and\r\nhelpless hunger. They will break street-lamps and tradesmen's windows,\r\nto get a month's imprisonment, with food, and rest, and shelter for that\r\nperiod. Others, and the majority, have a prouder spirit. They will\r\nescape a prison, with the help of God. Their number is very great. There\r\nare fifty thousand, it is said, in London, who rise every morning\r\nwithout knowing where to procure a breakfast. God be with them!\r\n\r\nBut all the want, and all the sin produced by want, in London, it would\r\ntake all the volumes of the _Conversations-Lexicon_ to recount. The\r\nstreets--every street--is filled with it. Survey the thoroughfares at\r\nnight. If any modest person is occasionally shocked at the exhibitions\r\nin Broadway, what would he say to Regent street, the Haymarket, the\r\nStrand, Fleet street, Cheapside, or fifty other streets in London? I\r\nhave reckoned nearly three hundred unfortunate females, as they call\r\nthemselves, in the space of one mile, on one side of the street alone,\r\nfrom Charing Cross to Temple Bar. These girls, as records testify, were\r\nmostly starved into the life of their adoption. They will tell you, if\r\nyou converse with them in their serious moments--for they have\r\nsuch--that but for the mad excitement drawn from gin, they could not\r\nlive. The river that flows sullenly along--what a catalogue of woes,\r\nwhat shame and frenzied despair, it has ended!\r\n\r\nI was crossing Waterloo Bridge one night when there was suddenly a shout\r\nand a rush of people. A girl had thrown herself off the parapet, and was\r\nstruggling in the water. The moon shone brightly down, and her figure\r\nwas distinctly visible as she wrestled with the tide that was bearing\r\nher away. She was the third that had jumped into the river within twelve\r\ndays; the average of such suicides in London being one in eight days. A\r\nvain effort was made to save her. Her body drifted down the river to be\r\ncast up at Greenwich or Woolwich, or perhaps the tide swept it out to\r\nsea, never to be found. I searched the newspapers for many days\r\nafterward, but saw no record of the poor creature's miserable end. These\r\nthings happen so frequently in London, that the press seldom records\r\nthem, unless they offer some peculiar features of interest.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the horrid want and misery that prevail among the very\r\npoorest class in London, I have as yet only partially uncovered the\r\npicture. We will draw the curtain back a little further, not to present\r\nthe entire truth in all its fidelity, for that would be too harrowing.\r\n\r\nIn the streets of London I have seen women and children contending for\r\nthe possession of a bone drawn from the slush of the kennel. I have seen\r\nboys fight and bruise each other for a crust of bread dropped upon the\r\npavement, and covered with wet mud, or even unsightlier filth. I have\r\nentered the abode of this desperate poverty, led thither by children,\r\nwho have clamored at my side for alms, and found such misery as I am\r\nincompetent to express in words. I have seen the living unable to rise\r\nfrom sickness, in the same bed with the dying and the dead. I have known\r\nan instance where a living man in strong health, bating the exhausting\r\neffects of privation and sorrow, has been compelled to seek repose in\r\nthe straw beside the body of his dead wife, his children occupying the\r\nfloor, and there being in the room neither chair in which he could seat\r\nhimself, nor table on which he could stretch himself for rest. I have\r\nseen an infant crawl for nourishment to its dead mother's breast, and\r\nthere was not in all the house the value of a cent to buy it food. I\r\nhave seen a wife, in following her husband's body to the grave, drop in\r\nthe road and die before medical assistance could be procured. A\r\n_post-mortem_ examination proved that she died from hunger.\r\n\r\nLet no one say that there are charitable asylums enough in London to\r\nfurnish assistance in all deserving cases of extreme distress. If there\r\nare, their doors--and I appeal to all Englishmen who know any thing\r\nabout the workings of the Poor Law System in their country, whether I do\r\nnot record the truth--are closed in three cases out of five against the\r\napplicant. Besides, charity in London is reserved and suspicious. But\r\nits reserve is chilling to the deserving poor, who are usually too proud\r\nto disclose their sufferings to strangers, and are ashamed to solicit\r\nalms with an open hand. They strive as long as they are able; their\r\nhistory, if duly recorded, would swell the roll of martyrs. I have known\r\namong them heroes and heroines, as in all nations such, whether apparent\r\nto the world or not, are never wanting. Wives, who have been bred in\r\ncomfort, working for their husbands who were out of employment, and\r\nsupporting them by the scanty wages of such industry as many men would\r\nshrink from. Girls of tender years toiling to support a surviving\r\nparent, sisters toiling for their brothers. And all done not only\r\nwithout a murmur, but with cheerfulness and thankfulness to God that\r\ntheir condition was no worse. I have heard hopeful accents from the\r\nplodding charwoman, that have made me ashamed, as Wordsworth stood\r\nrebuked before the 'leech-gatherer, upon the lonely moor.' Let England\r\nlook to it. These women, mothers of men, are abandoning her shores for\r\nforeign lands. When good and dutiful children desert the maternal home,\r\nwhat provocation must they have had from the parent?\r\n\r\n'In the year ending Lady-day 1859,' said the London _Times_ of February\r\n15th, 1860, 'England and Wales spent five million seven hundred and\r\nninety-two thousand nine hundred and sixty-three pounds in the relief of\r\nthe poor. It is estimated that on July 1st, 1859, nine hundred and\r\nninety-seven thousand seven hundred and ninety-six paupers were\r\nreceiving relief in or out of the workhouse in this part of the empire.\r\nThis is near a million of persons, at an average cost of about five\r\npounds sixteen shillings a head, a considerable improvement on the\r\nprevious year. The computation is, that every sixteenth person, or one\r\nperson in every three households, is a pauper, hanging like a dead\r\nweight on the industry of the other fifteen. This, too, is only one form\r\nof charity, beside untold millions spent in endowed alms-houses,\r\nhospitals, asylums for every imaginable infirmity, coal-funds,\r\nclothing-funds, charity-schools, voluntary labor-rates,\r\nchurch-collections, alms done in secret, and several hundred other\r\nspecies of benevolence.'\r\n\r\nVainly does an American strive to realize such a state of society. Its\r\neffects are visible in the hatred of the poor toward the rich, which, if\r\nthings continue as they are, will ultimately produce a war of classes.\r\nThe work-houses and other alms-houses are always filled. There may be\r\nbrief intervals when trade is brisk, and statesmen brag of the\r\nprosperity of the country, but these are only as the sane moments of a\r\ndelirious patient. The general health of the community must not be\r\njudged from these. When in a year that it confesses is a favorable one,\r\nthe leading political journal admits the proportion of paupers\r\nsubsisting on alms to be one to fifteen, what must be the proportion in\r\nperiods of great mercantile depression, which recur more frequently as\r\ntime advances? I can not at all agree with Mr. Emerson, that England has\r\nnot within her the elements of decay. She has. Her maritime supremacy is\r\ngone; her commercial advantages have vanished. In the world's market she\r\npossesses a stall, and nothing more. If it is better supplied than the\r\nstalls of some nations in the same market, it is, in its turn, inferior\r\nto those of others. I can not say, with her enemies, Let her decay. But\r\nI do bid her look to it in time, for her present condition is not one of\r\npromise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MILITARY NATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Confederates are vastly our superiors in the art of spreading\r\nplausible reports. Acting together 'like one man,' a falsehood from\r\nhead-quarters is at once disseminated from Richmond to New-Orleans, and\r\nthe North is promptly victimized. At present their game is to make us\r\ndiscredit their own forces, having learned that our belief in the extent\r\nof their army is only a stimulus to Northern exertions. The truth is,\r\nthat the Confederacy never had so large an army as at present, or in\r\nsuch excellent condition. They have been gathering up the odds and ends;\r\nthey have learned day by day to make better soldiers of them; they have\r\nabundant food, are on the whole well armed, and it is rank folly in us\r\nto rely on their weakness. Only an overwhelming force--the entire force\r\nof the North--can now conquer them, and to make even this available, our\r\nGovernment must have recourse to the most determined and daring\r\nmeasures. It is no longer a question of suppressing rebellion, but of\r\ndefense; of conquering or being conquered. Were we at this instant to\r\nconsent to the independence of the Confederacy, it would not be\r\naccepted. The Southerner, easily depressed by defeat, becomes arrogant\r\nin the hour of victory, and would exact such conditions as we could\r\nnever endure.\r\n\r\nThe South, by successful secession, would take with it all our\r\nprosperity and all our power. It would take the Border States and the\r\ncontrol of the Mississippi, and worse than this, it would _establish_ a\r\nwar which would rage without intermission until we should be crushed,\r\nperhaps into literal tribute and vassalage. Every dispute arising from\r\nour entangled neighborhood--and these would be innumerable--would be\r\ndetermined with an insolence and a cruelty far surpassing any thing\r\nwhich we have heretofore experienced; and at every manifestation of\r\nunwillingness on our part to submit, we should have the sword tauntingly\r\nthrown in the balance. With foreign aid and foreign allies they could\r\nsoon make our condition more galling than death. We should be the butt\r\nof every nation, humiliated and trampled on in every international\r\ndispute, and in every such difficulty the South would become the great\r\npower of America, and its rising sun would easily find means to abuse us\r\nstill further.\r\n\r\nIs this picture exaggerated? Let the reader shake off the fetters of old\r\ncustom and see the literal truths of life and what it is capable of\r\nbecoming. The South seriously proposes to establish itself as a\r\npermanently military nation. The blacks are to do all the labor, raise\r\nall the food, perform all the menial labor, and, in fact, literally\r\nsupport all the white men. The aristocracy are to govern and fill all\r\nhigher civil and military functions; the 'mean whites' are to be\r\nincorporated in the army. Year by year they will, it is hoped, become\r\nmore and more identified with their cause and their calling, and firmer\r\nin their hatred of the North. Long ago this programme was published,\r\nthis scheme of a great negro-supported military nation, and it is not\r\ndifficult to see that recent events have rendered the leaders of the\r\nConfederacy sanguine of its success. The whole South is full of crops\r\nraised by the slaves--and the Virginia press triumphantly proclaims the\r\nsuccess of the first part of the great experiment, a success well worth\r\nto them far greater sacrifices than they have already undergone. The\r\nnegro, it seems, as a slave, _can_ support the Southern\r\nConfederacy--feed and clothe it. One year of war has proved this.\r\n\r\n'One year ago we might have prevented this,' some furious 'radical' may\r\nurge. Let such men be silent. On every hand there are cries for their\r\nblood, and it is boldly commended in conservative journals and meetings\r\nthat they be hanged. However, the question is not now, what might have\r\nbeen done a year ago. It is, what the enemy hope for and what they are\r\nyet capable of doing.\r\n\r\nBy proving, undisturbed, the fact that the slaves can support them, the\r\nConfederates have gained a greater victory than the North dreams of. By\r\nforming a permanently military nation, they go a step further, and\r\nrelieve their communities from the weight of a non-productive, idle,\r\ndangerous class of poor whites. When every 'bush-whacker,'\r\n'sand-hiller,' 'Arab,' and other hanger-on shall have become a soldier,\r\nwith his settled place in society, a few new troubles may be incurred,\r\nbut much greater ones can not fail to be avoided. The leaders in a\r\nmilitary government may preserve that unity which could never be hoped\r\nfor under other conditions. We already know what unanimity prevails\r\namong them; we may imagine what this would become when further\r\nexperience shall have still more coordinated and consolidated them.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed in the South that other than military manufactures\r\nshall be encouraged. European goods are to flow in untaxed, and the\r\n'military nation' proposes to do all in its power to smuggle them over\r\nthe Northern frontier. To effect this darling scheme of vast profits to\r\nthemselves and of ruin to us, any sacrifice will be made. It is urged\r\nthat direct taxation will not prove sufficiently profitable to enable\r\nthe South to dispense with a revenue tariff; but those who urge this, do\r\nnot know the South. They do not know the infinite depths of hatred to\r\nthe North and to everything Northern--the venom and vindictiveness with\r\nwhich they would pursue us. They forget that as a _military_ nation\r\nwhatever the rulers will, must and shall be done. The great\r\nplanters--and Southern policy of capital tends to develop none save\r\ngreat planters and their adherents--will undoubtedly be taxed, but then\r\nthey will on the other hand be directly interested in sustaining the\r\ngovernment, and share in its power and patronage. Let the reader\r\nremember that after all, there are only _at present_ in the South some\r\ntwo hundred thousand slaveholders, or men holding slaves sufficient to\r\nfairly rank among those whose interests are seriously allied to 'the\r\ninstitution.' Possibly the chances of war have still further diminished\r\nthis number; it would be strange indeed, if between runaways and the\r\nsacrifices which adversity brings, and which fall most heavily on men of\r\nmoderate means, the number of slaveholders has not been reduced. In such\r\ntimes negroes are sold at _any_ price. This small number of slaveholders\r\nwill understand their own political interests sufficiently well to admit\r\nforeign goods duty free, and to use every effort to smuggle them into\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nWe, on the other hand, who have no negroes to plant for us, who must pay\r\nour farmers far more than the wretched black earns, have no 'mud-sill'\r\nwhereon to rest. We are manufacturers, and can not form a permanent\r\nmilitary nation. We hold in horror the idea of a standing army, and of\r\nhaving our young men who might grow up wealthy and learned--and what\r\nNorthern youth is there who has not his 'chances'?--become\r\ngarrison-soldiers for life. We love learning, culture, independence,\r\nprogress. Year by year sees noble schools rising among us--schools in\r\nwhich every man's son may obtain an excellent free education, and\r\nqualify himself for any position in any society. Year by year sees our\r\nmanufacturers demanding fresh labor, more talent, more youth, more\r\nenergy, and with them sees the condition of the mechanic becoming more\r\nand more ameliorated. Year by year finds the public lecture and library\r\nmore used by the workman, and the masses rising little by little above\r\ntheir post. In short, we belong to a community whose conditions are\r\nthose of refinement and of peace; ours is an advanced stage of\r\ncivilization, and it is our duty to maintain this advance.\r\n\r\n'The South' cares nothing for all these things. It 'loathes the very\r\nname of free schools,' despises industry and ingenuity, scorns the\r\nmechanic, and is altogether, as a community, behind us: as a merely\r\nagricultural and would-be merely military government, must essentially\r\nbe. There are predicaments when the shrewd brute and cunning brigand has\r\nhis superior at a disadvantage. Let the South prolong this contest till\r\nits military social system acquires sufficient strength, and it will\r\ndrag us down to its own wretched lord-and-serf level. 'To its level!'\r\nrather let us say beneath it; yes, beneath its iron heel, to endless\r\nshame and ruin.\r\n\r\nIt can never be. The man who believes in peaceable secession must be an\r\nidiot. Secession means a military nation living side by side with a\r\nnon-military nation, which it hates and will do its best to crush. It\r\nmeans a successful rebel flashing the sword in our face at every fancied\r\ninsult, and all the work of war perennially renewed. It means\r\nconservative traitors and doughface scoundrels stirring up riot and ruin\r\namong us at every corner, with no man to make them afraid; nourishing\r\nthe South in our faces and intriguing to bring us into the Confederacy.\r\nIt means the breaking up of the Union into many fragments--for who\r\nsupposes that Southern hatred will not intrigue to this effect, and that\r\nthe pro-slavery Northern men of the present day who have worked so hard\r\nto secure to the South the successful solution of the first part of its\r\nproblem will not be found laboring heart and soul to aid their old\r\nmasters?\r\n\r\n_Væ victis!_ If we do not rise in our might and crush this rebellion\r\nroot and branch, we shall be crushed--and no honest, observant man can\r\ndeny it. Fire and water may as well mingle as we two hope to inhabit the\r\nsame continent. It is hammer or anvil with us now, and no escape. They\r\nrealize with delight that our year of procrastination has been to them\r\nmore than two years of preparation, and so confident are they of success\r\nas to even wish to conceal their numbers.\r\n\r\nReader, this is not an emergency whose evil results may fall on others\r\nand not on yourself. There is not one loyal American to whom Southern\r\nsuccess does not portend misery, poverty, degradation. We have not yet\r\nfelt the foot of the enemy on our soil, but if we pour away the\r\nlife-blood of the nation little by little, why, a day will come when the\r\nblood will be exhausted, and the enemy, grown to fearful strength, will\r\ncome ravaging over the border. Do not fold your hands in fancied\r\nsecurity and say of that day: 'It is far off.' When it comes, you will\r\nsay, as you _now_ say of the past year, that there was time lost and sad\r\nnegligence. A year ago we 'progressives' cried aloud in bitter\r\nearnestness for one great, overwhelming effort, for decisive measures,\r\nand after debating, and delaying, and plucking all the feathers from our\r\nbird, they threw him, half-starved, at Bull Run, and then cried: There\r\nis your victory! A year ago we urged expediency and boldness; but\r\n'Democracy' quibbled at every thing, hindered everything, and then laid\r\nthe fault on us--as its friend Jeff Davis does when accusing the Federal\r\nGovernment of waging barbarous warfare--so as to excuse his own\r\niniquities. But now we have come to the bitter need, and the country\r\nmust choose between bold measures and measureless disgrace.\r\n\r\nLo! the country is responding heart and soul. From every township comes\r\nthe cry of Union or death! What was the waking of Sumter, compared to\r\nthis of the summer and autumn of eighteen hundred and sixty-two? At last\r\nthe truth has gone home--we _must_ conquer. Conquer or be conquered, it\r\nis, O friends! but if you _will_ it, you _shall_ have victory. You have\r\nthe strength: in God's name put forth your hand and grasp the golden\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM WINTERS' STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was taking an early walk on the morning after my arrival at the city\r\nof C----, in the spring of 186-, in order to sharpen my appetite for\r\nbreakfast, when I observed a tall and stoutly-built man on the opposite\r\nsidewalk proceeding in the same direction with myself. There was\r\nsomething in his gait and his manner of swinging his right arm (he had a\r\ncommon market-basket on his left) that seemed not unfamiliar to me; and\r\nI hastened my pace to keep up with him while I observed him further. It\r\nwas no easy matter; for he had a stride that, if hurried to its beat,\r\nwould have put me to a run to save being distanced; but I succeeded in\r\nheading him off after a rapid walk of several squares, which brought us\r\nto the market-place, and I soon had the satisfaction of hearing his\r\nvoice as he inquired the price of some of the marketing exposed for\r\nsale. This decided me, and I immediately threw myself in his way. He\r\nrecognized me at once, and as he held out his huge hand, which I took in\r\nmine, we exclaimed simultaneously: 'How are you, Owen?' 'How are you,\r\nTom?'\r\n\r\nThe greeting was something more than cordial. We had once been quite\r\nintimate, and it was seventeen years since we had met. I had lost sight\r\nof him that number of years before, and getting no satisfactory response\r\nto any inquiries I had from time to time made after him of mutual\r\nacquaintances, I had gradually dropped the subject, and never expected\r\nto meet him again.\r\n\r\nTom Winters was a Marylander by birth, and I had known him in Ohio\r\nduring the Presidential canvass of 1844, when he had supported the\r\ngallant son of Kentucky, Henry Clay, with all the ardor of his generous,\r\nrash, and passionate nature; while I had supported James K. Polk,\r\nbecause--because he was nominated by the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nI can appreciate at its true worth now that political infatuation which\r\nled me to reject the 'Mill Boy of the Slashes,' and to 'decline upon'\r\nPolk. There was no comparison between the two men.\r\n\r\n      ----'That was, to this,'\r\n  Hyperion to a satyr.'\r\n\r\nBut that is passed. Polk was elected, and the gallant 'Harry of the\r\nWest' died of a broken heart. Thence came Texas, the repeal of the\r\nCompromise, the Rebellion,\r\n\r\n  'Sin, and death, and all our woes.'\r\n\r\nAfter a few hasty questions and answers on each side, we parted to meet\r\nat dinner at Tom's residence, and to sit down then for a general\r\n_palabre_.\r\n\r\nI was punctual to my appointment, and after being introduced to Mrs.\r\nWinters, (Tom was now married and held an important position under the\r\nState government,) and after having been presented to Master Henry Clay\r\nWinters, a lad of three years, and being informed--in an aside--that the\r\nnext was to be named John Fremont Winters, we sat down to the table and\r\naccomplished our dinner and our explanations 'by piece-meal\r\nsimultaneously,'\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied my quondam friend upon the subject of my various\r\nwanderings, successes, and reverses since we parted--which were\r\ndecidedly too dull and commonplace to interest the reader, although Tom,\r\nfrom a sense of duty, probably, listened to their rehearsal with a great\r\ndeal of attention--I, in turn, questioned him of the events of his life.\r\nHe ran them hastily over, and seemed inclined to treat them with so much\r\nbrevity that I had frequently to call him back upon his narrative by a\r\nquestion on some point where I required more detailed information. But\r\nour dinner was over, and Mrs. Winters had retired, with Master Henry\r\nClay Winters, ere he had half satisfied my curiosity.\r\n\r\nWinters had left N----, the little county-town in Middle Ohio, where I\r\nhad known him, in the spring of 1845, and had begun to travel as agent\r\nfor a marble dealer of Pittsburgh, Pa. In this capacity he had roamed\r\nover all the Western States during several years, had made extensive\r\nacquaintances, and been rubbed against the world until he had acquired\r\ngreat knowledge of mankind and habits of self-reliance, without much of\r\nthat polish of manner which worldly attrition usually gives a man. He\r\nwas at that time between twenty-five and thirty years of age, in perfect\r\nhealth, and of herculean strength. He was considerably over six feet in\r\nheight, compactly built, and that consciousness of power which such\r\nfavored individuals possess, rendered him, in a great measure,\r\nindifferent to the opinions of others. Without any of the refinement\r\nwhich careful culture and early training confer, it is not to be\r\nwondered at that Tom was not 'over-particular' as to the society in\r\nwhich he ventured, or what profession he followed.\r\n\r\nHe had also been captain of a canal-packet, a drover, a deputy-sheriff,\r\na general collector, and had first married in Kentucky, and settled at\r\nLexington, where he had spent four years. There his wife died, without\r\nleaving children, and Tom was afloat upon the world again. Then he had\r\nspent two years in Mississippi; returned to Lexington, went to\r\nCincinnati; 'and since then,' he continued, 'I have lived in every\r\ncounty on this side in succession, and have been here four years since I\r\nmarried my present wife; so that you see the seventeen years is now\r\nfilled up, and you know my whole history.'\r\n\r\n'But what were you doing in Mississippi?' I inquired.\r\n\r\nFor the first time Tom hesitated; and he answered, with an uneasy\r\nexpression and a furtive glancing about of his keen hazel eye, that he\r\nhad been an overseer on a plantation.\r\n\r\n'The devil!' I exclaimed, rather abruptly.\r\n\r\n'It is a fact,' said the plain-spoken Tom, looking seriously into his\r\nempty glass, then adding apologetically:\r\n\r\n'What should I care about it? I had lived a long time in Kentucky, and\r\nbeen accustomed to slavery as it existed there. Besides, I am a\r\nMarylander by birth. I said slavery was right, and I believed it. My\r\nwife was dead; I had little means left, and cared for nothing.\r\n\r\n'I had become acquainted with Luke Meminger, the principal negro-dealer\r\nat Lexington, who boarded at McGowan's Hotel, where I was then stopping,\r\nand he introduced me to a Mississippi planter' who was there buying a\r\nfew hands for his plantation back of Grand Gulf. Talbot (that was the\r\nplanter's name) seemed to take a fancy to me, and finally proposed to me\r\nto go with him to Mississippi and serve as assistant overseer. He\r\noffered me a salary of eight hundred dollars a year; said I should have\r\na horse to ride over the plantation, a servant to wait on me, and an\r\neasy time of it generally. I accepted the offer, and accompanied him\r\ndown the river. We took down fifteen niggars whom he had purchased in\r\nKentucky, mostly at Lexington. I was there two years, and left heartily\r\nsick of it.'\r\n\r\n'Well, that is an episode in your history, Tom,' I said, 'that I could\r\nnever have imagined. But now you must tell me something about plantation\r\nlife. I have heard and read a great deal about it, but never had it from\r\nthe mouth of an old friend on whose word I could rely, and who possessed\r\nthe advantage of having been an overseer himself.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! there is very little to tell,' said Tom. 'I had to set the niggars\r\nat work and see that they performed their tasks; that was all.'\r\n\r\n'Well, what crops did you cultivate?'\r\n\r\n'Cotton.'\r\n\r\n'How many hands did you work?'\r\n\r\n'About seventy-five. There were some hundred and fifty on the\r\nplantation, altogether, big and little.\r\n\r\n'What did the women do?'\r\n\r\n'Women?' said Tom, with a slight note of interrogation. 'We didn't know\r\nany thing about women: they were all _hands_. When I was driving stock\r\nto New-York, I treated oxen and cows all alike; and on our plantation\r\nall the able-bodied hands worked together in the field, and no\r\ndifference was made between them. There were old, decrepit wenches,\r\nunable to work, who took care of the children during the day. When the\r\nmothers came from the field at night they suckled their picaninies--for\r\nnearly all the women have babies. They breed like rabbits,' added Tom,\r\n'in postscript.'\r\n\r\n'But what did _you_ know about raising cotton?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Nothing, of course,' he replied, 'you must remember that I was second\r\noverseer. The head overseer took the chief management of affairs. But\r\nwhen I had been there about three months, Blake died--that was my\r\nchief's name--then the whole charge of the plantation then devolved on\r\nme. Talbot was North, spending the summer. I wrote to him at Saratoga,\r\ninforming of the death of Blake, and requesting him to get another\r\nhead-overseer. But I got no reply, and I supposed he never received the\r\nletter. When he came back in the fall, I found that he had, though; but\r\nhe said he supposed things would go on well enough. And so they did. The\r\nsupplies were all on hand, and there was nothing to do but to work the\r\nplace, raise the crop, and gather it.'\r\n\r\n'But, after the death of Blake, and in the absence of Talbot, your want\r\nof knowledge of the business must have worked you great inconvenience,'\r\nI remarked.\r\n\r\n'Not at all,' he replied; 'I knew next to nothing about it, it is true;\r\nbut the niggars did. [Tom _would_ call them _niggars_.] They understood\r\nthe business well enough, the most of them. Talbot knew nothing about it\r\nhimself, and he seemed to care less. These planters put every thing on\r\nthe overseers. They make them responsible for the crop; and the\r\noverseers--they make the hands responsible.'\r\n\r\n'Well, tell me something, now, of the operations of each day on the\r\nplantation. How early did you get the hands at work in the morning?'\r\n\r\n'In summer I called the hands at about four o'clock. They had half an\r\nhour to get their feed and reach the field. I divided them into gangs of\r\nfrom fifteen to thirty each, and appointed some one of the most\r\nintelligent to oversee each gang. I then set them their tasks for the\r\nday; and calling out Dick, or Jeff, or whatever his name might be that I\r\nhad appointed, I told him, in presence and hearing of his gang, that I\r\nmade him responsible for the work being done, and being well done; that\r\nif the hands did not obey him, he should lick them, and make them do\r\ntheir work. In this way I never had any difficulty in getting the work\r\ndone which I had set for them.\r\n\r\n'When I had got them all at work, I rode from one part of the field to\r\nanother to see how they were getting along; and when the sun began to\r\nget too hot, toward nine o'clock, I would go back to my quarters at the\r\nhouse, get my breakfast, and then lounge about awhile, and finally lie\r\ndown and sleep through the heat of the day. After four or five o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, I had my horse brought up by my servant--I had my own\r\nservant, I told you; I had my boots blacked twice a day; had to keep up\r\nthe dignity of the institution, you know--I had my horse brought up, and\r\nrode round to the different gangs.'\r\n\r\n'But, Tom,' I inquired; 'I suppose you sometimes had to flog the\r\nslaves?'\r\n\r\n'Never touched a one of them, never! 'T wan't no use. Made 'em do just\r\nas I wanted without striking a blow.'\r\n\r\n'Why, how did you do it?'\r\n\r\n'I've told you how I did it. I set some of them to oversee the rest.\r\n_They_ thrashed them; I didn't. If they failed in their tasks, I talked\r\nto them in this way,' (and he turned his wicked eye on me with a merry\r\ntwinkle,) 'I called out the overseer, and spoke to him so that the rest\r\ncould hear me; I said to him: 'Dick,' or 'Jeff,' or whatever his name\r\nwas, 'how is this? I set you a task this morning that you could do easy\r\nenough. Why isn't it done? Some of your hands have been lazy. Now, mind,\r\nthis won't do. I don't want to punish you, but I see I'll have to do\r\nit.' Then turning to the hands: 'Boys, what have you been so lazy for?\r\nYou don't want Jeff licked, do you? Why don't you work like men, and\r\nfinish the tasks I set you? You black devils, you! if you keep on in\r\nthis way you will always be niggars; but if you work, and do as you\r\nought to, you will get as white as I am, after a while!'\r\n\r\n'This course generally had the desired effect; but I clinched the\r\nargument by threatening to withhold their whisky rations if they failed\r\nin their work.'\r\n\r\n'Then you gave them whisky rations, did you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. Every Saturday night, if they had behaved well during the week, I\r\ngave them a keg of whisky to keep Sunday with. We locked up the tools,\r\nand the supplies, and in fact the houses. My room was bolted and barred\r\nlike a state's prison, and I had a complete arsenal of guns, swords, and\r\nammunition. And then they had a regular 'drunk' on Sunday. The keg held\r\njust enough, and not a drop over. They divided it out among themselves,\r\nby measurement, and it was all gone in time for them to get over the\r\neffects of it before Monday morning.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you think,' I inquired, 'that the expected whisky rations was\r\nquite as great a stimulus to their exertions as your philosophical\r\nexhortations?'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps it was. But you must recollect that the whisky rations formed a\r\npart of my lecture, and were always introduced as a clincher. I was the\r\nmost popular overseer ever on the plantation, and when I left the\r\ndarkies cried like babies. Talbot raised my wages to twelve hundred\r\ndollars, dating from the time I went there, and I performed the whole\r\nduties of overseer without any assistance.'\r\n\r\n'And how did you come to leave so agreeable and profitable an\r\nemployment?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'll tell you how it was. Talbot used to get tight; and although\r\nhe was ordinarily a perfect gentleman in his behavior, when drunk he was\r\nthe very devil! Then, he would abuse me like a pickpocket, and find all\r\nmanner of fault with whatever I did. He would curse me for a d--d\r\nYankee, and I would give him as good as he sent. I was no more a Yankee\r\nthan he was, having been born, as you know, in Maryland.\r\n\r\n'Often he drew his bowie-knife, and rushed at me as if he would cut me\r\ninto mince-meat; but I met him boldly with my 'cheese-cutter,' and\r\nbacked him down. I could have handled him as I would a child, and he\r\nknew it. And if he had ever drawn blood on me, I would have killed him\r\nin an instant; and he knew it.\r\n\r\n'One day when he was drunk, he got mad at a niggar woman he kept about\r\nthe house, and ordered me to whip her. I told him to whip her himself.\r\nThis enraged him terribly. He was just drunk enough to be crazy. Out\r\ncame the everlasting bowie-knife, and out came mine, as usual. Then he\r\nturned from me--whom he feared to attack, drunk and insensate as he\r\nwas--he turned from me upon the poor black girl. She was standing near,\r\nwith her eyes cast down, and did not immediately perceive his intention.\r\n\r\n'She was a pretty girl--a dark mulatto--and had long been his favorite.\r\nBut he was then perfectly blind with fury, and dashed at her with his\r\nglittering knife raised above his head. She saw him in time to utter a\r\npiercing shriek, and while in the act of turning to fly, the weapon fell\r\nupon her neck, severed the jugular vein, and prostrated her to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n'The poor girl never spoke again. The blood rushed like water from the\r\nwound, her face paled, her limbs stiffened, and, with a few convulsive\r\nshudders, she was dead. She was taken to one of the huts, and buried by\r\nthe blacks on the following night. There was no inquest--no inquiry--it\r\nwas nobody's business.\r\n\r\n'As for Talbot, as soon as he saw her fall he appeared to be sobered all\r\nat once. He looked at her a moment, glanced at the bloody knife, and\r\nthen cast it from him, as if he were purging himself of the offense, or\r\npunishing the offender by the act. He said not a word, but went to his\r\nroom. I saw him no more that day.\r\n\r\n'On the next, I went to him and told him he must get another overseer,\r\nfor I was about to leave. He seemed incredulous at first, then stormed,\r\nthen finding me inflexible, he offered to increase my wages if I would\r\nremain. I had but one answer for all. I said to him: 'Mr. Talbot, I\r\ndon't want your money. If I would stay with you at all, I would stay for\r\nmy present salary. But I will not stay: I never eat my words. If you are\r\nready to settle with me now, say so; if not, say when you will be\r\nready.'\r\n\r\n'He said he was ready then, and we settled. I had a few hundred dollars\r\ndue to me, which he paid, and I was on my way to Grand Gulf within two\r\nhours after. The subject of the murder of the mulatto girl was not\r\nalluded to between us.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Well,' I said to Tom, 'what is your opinion of slavery now? You are\r\nable to judge for yourself of the 'institution,' having formed one of\r\nits ornaments, and contributed to keep up its 'dignity.' I suppose you\r\nhave read _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, and are prepared to give a flat denial to\r\nthe pretended facts of the author. Of course it is all false about the\r\nparting of families--husband and wife, parent and child, etc., and all\r\nthe instances of that sort of cruelty cited in her appendix are trash\r\nand a libel upon the beneficent and patriarchal institution?'\r\n\r\nI spoke ironically, and he so understood me. The passions of Tom's great\r\nheart had been gradually wrought up by a review of the bloody scene he\r\nhad himself witnessed, and which had made a strong impression on him,\r\nand he now sprung to his feet.\r\n\r\n'_Uncle Tom's Cabin_ be d--d!' he cried. 'Owen Glendower, what I've seen\r\nwith my own eyes I know, don't I? I could tell you things that would\r\nmake your hair stand straight out, if I was a mind to; but it's no use.\r\n\r\n'As to slavery, as it exists in the Sugar and Cotton States, to-day, I\r\nhave but one fit illustration for it.\r\n\r\n'The religious writers of the Jews, and those who follow their ideas,\r\nhave pictured to us the future condition of the sinner and finally\r\nimpenitent as the most desperate and deplorable possible to be\r\nconceived--as they thought. They had never witnessed American slavery as\r\npracticed in the nineteenth century. If they, had, the material fire,\r\nthe tormenting fiends, and the 'worm that never dies,' would have given\r\nplace to the natural features of a Mississippi plantation, where the\r\nunrestrained passions of avarice, brutality, and lust make a Hell to\r\nwhich the _Gehenna_ of the Hebrews is but a mild sort of purgatory by\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\n'About parting husband and wife, and parent and child, I will tell you\r\none thing I myself saw in Kentucky; and in Kentucky you know, slavery\r\nexists in its mildest form, and the system approaches nearer to that\r\npatriarchal character which is most falsely claimed for it by its\r\nsupporters, than in any of the more Southern States.'\r\n\r\nJust then Master Winters returned to the room, and on seeing him Tom's\r\nexcitement apparently increased. He gesticulated violently, and\r\ndelivered himself in short, emphatic sentences, interlarded, I am sorry\r\nto say, with rather too many of those objectionable expletives that an\r\nex-slave-overseer may be supposed to be addicted to. Swearing is a\r\nvulgar practice, and one for which there is no sort of justification;\r\nand yet, I must confess, it is calculated to give a certain savage\r\nenergy to one's language when he has not a very copious vocabulary of\r\nchoicer epithets and synonyms at command. Of course I can not do justice\r\nto Tom's colloquial style in print, but he proceeded:\r\n\r\n'I was, as I told you before, well acquainted with the slave-dealer,\r\nMeminger, at Lexington. We boarded together at M'Gowan's; and after my\r\nwife died I went about with him considerable.\r\n\r\n'One day, in the winter before I left there to go to Mississippi, he and\r\nI were coming over from Danville. It was the coldest day I ever knew in\r\nKentucky. Kentucky has a mild climate, and the winters are short and not\r\nvery severe. Still the weather is very variable, and there will\r\noccasionally occur a day in January which is as cold as any where else,\r\nand which is felt all the more for being an exception.\r\n\r\n'This day, when Meminger and I were coming over from Danville, was one\r\nof those days. It was cold; I tell you, it was almighty cold! We were on\r\nhorseback, and were bundled up with any amount of clothes and mufflers,\r\nand had leggins on--as they always wear them in Kentucky when they go on\r\nhorseback. We had got--you know where the turnpike forks south of the\r\nKentucky river. One branch runs this way, to Danville; the other, that\r\nway to Lancaster and Stanford. Right here in the forks--that is the\r\nidentical spot where Camp 'Dick Robinson' now is; but there was no camp\r\nthere then, by a long shot. Then as you approach the river, you come\r\ndown a long hill, a mile long, at least, you know.\r\n\r\n'Well, we had got nearly to the bottom of this hill, and were coming\r\nalong at a pretty good jog, when we heard some body hallooing after us,\r\nand we held up. Looking around, we saw a man running down from the house\r\nstanding upon the side-hill, a little away from the road. May be you\r\nremember the house up there? Well, he was hallooing like a loon, and we\r\nwaited till he came up. Soon as he got near enough to talk, he says:\r\n\r\n''An't one o' you Mr. Meminger, the negro-trader from Lexington?'\r\n\r\n''My name's Meminger,' said my companion, 'and I sometimes buy niggars.\r\nWhat do you want?'\r\n\r\n''I want to sell you a woman,' replied the man.\r\n\r\n''Where is she?'\r\n\r\n''Up at my house, there.'\r\n\r\n''Well, fotch her down, then. You don't suppose I'm going up there for\r\nany d--d niggar woman, such a day as this, do you? And be quick about\r\nit, for I don't intend to stand here in the cold.'\r\n\r\n'The man started back for the house on the run, and kept hallooing and\r\nmotioning to some one who met him on the way; and he returned to where\r\nwe stood on the 'pike with as fine, healthy a looking young black girl\r\nas I have often seen. She was dressed with a single garment, which\r\nhardly covered her; and she carried in her arms a child, apparently\r\nabout two or three months old, which she had wrapped up in some rags to\r\nkeep it warm.\r\n\r\n''This is the woman,' said the man.\r\n\r\n''What do you ask for her?' said Meminger.\r\n\r\n''I'll take eight hundred dollars for the mother and child,' said the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n''D--n the child!' said Meminger; 'do you suppose I want two months\r\nchildren in my pen? If you do, you are cursedly mistaken. What will you\r\ntake for the woman alone?'\r\n\r\n''I don't very well like to part them,' said the man hesitatingly, 'and\r\nI promised my wife I wouldn't. But if you won't buy the child--'\r\n\r\n''I tell you I won't buy the child, and that's enough,' broke in\r\nMeminger.\r\n\r\n''---- I'll take seven hundred dollars for the woman.'\r\n\r\n'Meminger threw his bridle-rein to me, and slid down from his horse to\r\nlook at the girl. He stepped up to her, caught her upper lip with one\r\nhand and her lower with the other, and opened her mouth, and examined\r\nher teeth in the same manner that you or I, Owen, would a horse. Then he\r\ntook her by the arm, twirled her round, struck her roughly on her back,\r\nfelt the muscle of her fore-arm, her thigh, and calf; then stood back\r\nand examined her all over a moment, and said:\r\n\r\n''I suppose she is all right? I don't want her, but I am going right\r\nhome, and I can take her along as well as not, and I'll give you six\r\nhundred dollars for her. If you want it, say so at once, for I an't\r\ngoing to stand here talking all day!'\r\n\r\n'The man seemed reluctant to take the sum offered--said she was worth\r\nmore, and he ought to give six hundred and fifty for her.\r\n\r\n'Meminger cut him short with a savage oath, telling him that if he\r\nwasn't going to accept the six hundred, to say so, for he would not\r\nstand there in the cold any longer for the six hundred dollars, niggar\r\nand all, and he moved toward his horse as if to remount.\r\n\r\n''Well, then,' said the man, who seemed determined to sell her at some\r\nprice, 'take her at six hundred if that's all you'll give.'\r\n\r\n'Meminger drew out a blank bill of sale--that's the way they do it, you\r\nknow, have to have it in writing--and said to me:\r\n\r\n''Here, Tom, you fill out this for me, for my hands have got so cold I\r\ncan't write.'\r\n\r\n'He took a pen and ink from his pocket, and I filled out the bill of\r\nsale while he counted down six hundred dollars in bills on the Northern\r\nBank of Kentucky, and paid them over. By the time the man had signed the\r\nbill the ink was frozen solid.\r\n\r\n''Hurry up!' says Meminger.\r\n\r\n'The man having received his money, caught the child from its mother's\r\narms and started for the house without saying another word.\r\n\r\n'The woman had all this time been shivering with the cold, and\r\napparently wholly occupied with the child in endeavoring to keep it\r\nwarm. She pressed it to her bosom, examined the ragged covering with\r\ncare and tenderness, and strove to draw her own scanty garment over it.\r\nShe seemed, in fact, so engrossed with her care of the child that she\r\nhad not comprehended that part of the negotiation which threatened to\r\npart her from it. Perhaps she did not, in her blind maternal confidence,\r\nconceive such a thing possible!\r\n\r\n'When the child was roughly snatched from her, she paused an instant, as\r\nif collecting her thoughts, and then, awakening to the reality of the\r\ncase, she started wildly after it. But Meminger was too quick for her.\r\nHe was used to such scenes. He caught her before she had gone three\r\nsteps, and rudely threw her down. She uttered scream after scream, and\r\nimplored him not to part her from her child. Turning alternately from\r\nthe unfeeling and repulsive countenance of the slave-trader to the\r\nretreating form of her late master, who bore away farther and farther\r\nfrom her all that she knew of love or hope on earth, her impassioned\r\nentreaties touched every key-note of human agony from frenzy to despair.\r\nIt was of no use. Meminger regarded her feelings no more than I regarded\r\nthe lowings of my stock when I was in the droving business.\r\n\r\n'He mounted his horse, brought him up alongside of a low bank, and\r\nordered the woman to get up behind him. This she did as one accustomed\r\nto obey, groaning and crying piteously. He placed her behind his saddle,\r\nastride of the horse as if she were a man. In this position, what dress\r\nshe had on, and it was not much, was necessarily drawn up above her\r\nknees. She had an old pair of scuffs of shoes on, the rest of the limbs\r\nwere bare. And in this way we went on through the cold, she shivering,\r\nsobbing, and clinging to the negro-trader, all the way to Lexington.\r\nOnly at Nicholasville, I persuaded Meminger to alight and get some\r\nclothes to wrap up the girl's legs to prevent them from being frosted\r\nbefore he got her home.'\r\n\r\n'And do you really think she had a mother's affection for her child, and\r\nfelt its loss as acutely as other mothers--white mothers?' I asked him.\r\n\r\n'Do I think so?' he asked, almost fiercely. 'Come here, Henry Clay!' and\r\nhe reached down and lifted his boy up into his huge arms and kissed him\r\nwith fervor.\r\n\r\n'Do you see that boy? Do you think his white mother loves him?' he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n'No doubt of it,' I answered.\r\n\r\n'And I tell you, Owen Glendower,' he resumed, 'that just as my wife,\r\nMrs. Winters, loves this boy, did that black mother love her child. More\r\nstrongly, more firmly did she love it; more frantically did she bewail\r\nits loss, because her reason did not suggest any hope of its ultimate\r\nrecovery, such as might be entertained by an intelligent white woman.\r\nAnd when it was suddenly snatched from her bosom, on that cold day, by\r\nthe Kentucky River, it was as much lost to her as if it had been\r\nsnatched by the hand of death instead of that of her inhuman master.'\r\n\r\n'This was a single instance, you may say; but if I've seen _one_, I've\r\nseen _fifty_ such. Not all alike, but varying with circumstance,\r\nlocality, and occasion; and yet all due alike to the essential elements\r\nof human slavery, and inseparable from the institution.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy time was up. I bade adieu to my hostess, shook Tom Winters' hand, and\r\nstarted for the cars with a feeling of satisfaction at having\r\nencountered him again, even if it should be for the last time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HILLS IN OCTOBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur town friends, who fly from the heat and dust, and menacing diseases\r\nand insupportable _ennui_, of their city residence during the months of\r\nJuly and August, may have an escape, but they have little enjoyment. We\r\nadmire the heroism with which they endure, year after year, the\r\ndiscomforts of a country hotel, or the packing in the narrow,\r\nhalf-furnished bed-rooms and rather warm attics of rural lodging-houses,\r\nand the general abatement and contraction of creature-comforts, in such\r\nstartling contrast to the abounding luxuries of their own city palaces.\r\nBut they are right. The country, at any discount, is better, in the\r\nfearful heats of July and August, than the town with its hot, unquiet\r\nnights and polluted air. Any hillside or valley in the country, and a\r\nshelter under any roof in or upon them, with the broad cope of heaven\r\nabove, (not cut into patches and fragments by intervening walls and\r\nchimney-tops,) and broad fields, and grass, and corn, and woodlands, and\r\ntheir flowers and freshening dews and breezes, and all Nature's infinite\r\nvariety, is better than every appliance and contrivance of luxury, with\r\nthe din, the suffocation, and unrest of city life.\r\n\r\nYes, our city friends are right in their summer flight from\r\n\r\n                      '----the street,\r\n  Filled with its ever-shifting train;'\r\n\r\nbut they must not flatter themselves that their mere glimpse of country\r\nlife--their mere snatch at its midsummer beauty, the one free-drawn\r\nbreath of their wearied spirit--is acquaintance with it. As well might\r\none who had seen Rosalind, the most versatile of Shakspeare's heroines,\r\nonly in her court-dress at her uncle the duke's ball, guess at her\r\ninfinite variety of charm in the Forest of Ardennes. Nature holds her\r\ndrawing-room in July and August. She wears her fullest and richest\r\ndresses then; if we may speak flippantly without offense to the\r\nsimplicity of her majesty, she is then _en pleine toilette_. But any\r\nother of the twelve is more picturesque than the summer months:\r\nblustering March, with its gushing streams tossing off their icy\r\nfetters; changeful April, with its greening fields and glancing birds;\r\nsweet, budding, blossoming May; flowery June; fruitful September;\r\ngolden, glorious October; dreary, thoughtful November; and all of\r\nWinter, with its potent majesty and heroic adversity.\r\n\r\nBut let our citizens come to our rural districts; the more, the better\r\nfor them! Only let them not imagine they get that 'enough' which is 'as\r\ngood as a feast.'\r\n\r\nThis preamble was naturally suggested by our autumnal life in the\r\ncountry, and by a recurrence to a late delightful passage through the\r\n'White Hills of New Hampshire.'\r\n\r\n  'That resort of people that do pass\r\n    In travel to and fro'\r\n\r\nduring the intense months of July and August, we found in October so\r\nfree from visitors, that we might have fancied ourselves the discoverers\r\nof that upland region of beauty, unparalleled, so far as we know, in all\r\nthe traveled parts of our country. And for the benefit of those who\r\nshall come after us, for all who have their highest enjoyment, perhaps\r\ntheir best instruction, in Nature's 'free school,' we intended to give\r\nsome brief notices of our tour, in the hope of extending the traveling\r\nseason into October by imparting some faint idea of the startling beauty\r\nof this brilliant month in the mountains; but what we might have said\r\nwas happily superseded.\r\n\r\nAt a little inn in a small town, after we came down from the 'high\r\nplaces,' we met a party of friends who had preceded us along the whole\r\nroute by a day. A rain came on, and we were detained together for\r\ntwenty-four hours. We agreed to pass the evening in a reciprocal reading\r\nof the brief notes of our journey. It came last to the turn of my\r\nfriend, a very charming young person, whom I shall take the liberty to\r\ncall Mary Langdon. She blushed and stammered, and protested against\r\nbeing a party to the contribution.\r\n\r\n'Mine,' she said, 'is a long letter to my cousin, which I began before\r\nwe left home.'\r\n\r\n'So much the better,' we rejoined, 'for the pleasure will be the\r\nlonger.'\r\n\r\n'But it has been written in every mood of feeling.'\r\n\r\n'Therefore,' we urged, 'the more variety.'\r\n\r\nAt last, driven to the wall, she threw a nice morocco letter-case into\r\nmy lap, saying:\r\n\r\n'Take it and read it to yourself, and you will see why I positively can\r\nnot read it aloud.'\r\n\r\nSo we gave up our entreaties. I read the letter-journal after I went to\r\nmy room. The reading cheated me of an hour's sleep; perhaps because I\r\nhad just intensely enjoyed the country my friend described; and in the\r\nmorning I begged Miss Langdon's permission to publish it. She at first\r\nvehemently objected, saying it would be in the highest degree indelicate\r\nto publish so much of her own story as was inextricably interwoven with\r\nthe journey.\r\n\r\n'But, dear child,' I urged, 'who that reads THE CONTINENTAL knows you?\r\nAnd besides, when this is published, (if indeed the Messrs. Editors of\r\nthat popular journal graciously permit it to see the light,) you will be\r\non the other side of the Atlantic; and before you return, this record\r\nwill be forgotten, for, alas! we contributors to Monthlies do not write\r\nfor immortality.'\r\n\r\n'But for the briefest mortality I am not fitted to write,' she pleaded.\r\n\r\nI rather smiled at the novelty of one hesitating to write for the public\r\nbecause not fitted for the task; and, thinking of 'the fools that rushed\r\nin,' (there is small aptness in the remainder of the familiar\r\nquotation,) I continued to urge till my young friend yielded, on my\r\npromising to omit passages which relate to the emotions and rites of the\r\ninner temple; Mary Langdon not partaking that incomprehensible frankness\r\nor child-like hallucination which enables some of our very best\r\nwriters--Mrs. Browning, for instance--to impart, by sonnets and in\r\nvarious vehicles of prose and verse, to the curious and all-devouring\r\npublic those secrets from the heart's holy of holies that one would\r\nhardly confess to a lover or a priest.\r\n\r\nIt is to our purpose, writing, as we profess to do, _pour l'utile_, that\r\nour young friend indulged little in sentiment that her circumstances\r\nrendered dangerous to her peace, and that, being a country-bred\r\nNew-England girl, she conscientiously, set down the coarser realities\r\nessential to the well-being of a traveler--breakfasts, dinners, etc. But\r\nbefore proceeding to her journal, I must introduce my _debutante_, if\r\nshe who will probably make but a single appearance before the public may\r\nbe so styled.\r\n\r\nMary Langdon is still on the threshold of life; at least those who have\r\nreached threescore would deem her so, as she is not more than\r\nthree-and-twenty. The freshness of her youth has been preserved by a\r\nsimple and rather retired country-life. A total abstinence from French\r\nnovels and other light reading has left the purity and candor of her\r\nyouth unscathed by their blight and weather-stain. Would that this tree\r\nof the knowledge of evil--not _good_ and evil--were never transplanted\r\ninto our New World. 'If ye eat of it,' your love of what is natural and\r\nsimple 'will surely die;' ye will lose your perception of the sweet\r\nodors of the flowers Providence has sown along your path, and the vile\r\nexhalations from these fruits of corrupted genius will hide from you the\r\nstar of duty--perhaps Nature's sternest light, but her best.\r\n\r\nMary Langdon's simplicity is that of truth, not of ignorance. Her father\r\nhas given her what he calls 'a good old-fashioned English education;'\r\nthat means, he says, that 'she thoroughly knows how to read, write, and\r\ncipher, which few girls brought up at French boarding-schools do.' As\r\nmight be suspected from the practical ideas in her narrative, our young\r\nfriend has had that complete development of her faculties which arises\r\nout of the necessities of country-life in its best aspects. There is\r\nhardly a position in our country, now, so isolated but one may 'follow\r\nthe arts' if one chooses, foreign artists and accomplished exiles\r\npervading our country parts. Mary has availed herself of the facilities\r\nthus afforded to cultivate a musical talent and temperament, and acquire\r\nenough of the foreign languages to open their literature to her.\r\nStrangers do not call Mary Langdon handsome; but her friends do, and\r\nthey marvel that her fair oval face, her spirited expression, tempered\r\nby the sweetest mouth and most pearly and expressive teeth, do not\r\nstrike all eyes. And then she is so buoyant, so free of step and frank\r\nof speech, that while others are slowly winding their way to your\r\naffections, she springs into your heart.\r\n\r\nWith due respect to seniority, we should have presented Mr. Langdon\r\nbefore his daughter. On being called on for his journal, he said he was\r\nnot 'such a confounded fool as to keep one for any portion of his life.\r\nHe should as soon think of crystallizing soap-bubbles. He had dotted\r\ndown a few memoranda in his memorandum book, as warnings to future\r\ntravelers, and we were welcome to them; though he thought we were too\r\nmountain-mad to profit by them, if indeed any body ever profited by any\r\nbody else's experience!' The fact was, the dear old gentleman had left\r\nhome in a very unquiet state of mind. He hated at all times leaving his\r\nhome, abounding in comforts. He detested travel under what he termed\r\n'alleviating circumstances.' He was rather addicted to growling; this\r\nEnglish instinct came over with his progenitor in the Mayflower, and\r\nhalf a dozen generations had not sufficed to subdue it. But Mr.\r\nLangdon's 'bark is worse than his bite.' In truth his 'bite' is like\r\nthat of a teething child's, resulting from a derangement of sweet and\r\nloving elements.\r\n\r\nWe found our old friend's memoranda so strongly resembling the grumbling\r\nof our traveling cousins from over the water, that we think it may be\r\nedifying to print it in a parallel column, as a per contra, illustrating\r\nthe effects of the lights or shadows that emanate from our own minds.\r\nProvidence provides the banquet; its relish or disrelish depends on the\r\nappetite of the guest.\r\n\r\nBut to Mary Langdon's letter, which, as it was begun before she left\r\nhome, bears its first date there:\r\n\r\n'LAKE-SIDE, _28th September_.--My Dear Sue: I have not much more to tell\r\nyou than my last contained. Carl Heiner left our neighborhood last week,\r\ndetermined to return by the next steamer to Dusseldorf. We were both\r\nvery wretched at this final parting. But as I have often seen people\r\nmaking great sacrifices to others, and then letting them lose all the\r\nbenefit of the sacrifice, by the manner of it, I summoned up courage,\r\nand appeared before my father calm and acquiescing, and--you will think\r\nme passionless, perhaps hard-hearted--I soon became so. I read, over and\r\nover again, your arguments, and I confess I was willing to be persuaded\r\nby them. But, after all, my point of sight is not yours, and you can not\r\nsee objects in the proportions and relations that I do. You say I have\r\nexaggerated notions of filial duty, that I have come to mature age and\r\nripe judgment, and that I should decide and act for myself; that in the\r\nnature of things the conjugal must supersede the filial relation, and\r\nthat I have no right to sacrifice my life-long happiness to the remnant\r\nof my father's days; and above all, that I am foolish to give in to his\r\nprejudices, and _selfishness_, you added, dear, and did not quite efface\r\nthe word. Now I see there is much reason in what you say, and I have\r\nonly to answer that I can not leave my father with a shadow of his\r\ndisapprobation. I can not and I will not. Our hearts have grown\r\ntogether. God forms the bond that ties the child to the parent, and we\r\nmake the other, and rotten it often proves. Susy, you lost your parents\r\nwhen you were so young, that you can not tell what I feel for my\r\nsurviving one. Since my mother's death and Alice's marriage, he has\r\nlived in such dependence on me, that I can't tell what his life would be\r\nif I were to leave him; and I will not. You tell me this is unnatural,\r\nand a satisfactory proof to you that I do not love Carl Heiner. O\r\nSue----'\r\n\r\n'Here must be our first hiatus. We can only say that the outpouring of\r\nour young friend's heart satisfied us that beneath her serene surface\r\nthere was an unfathomable well of feeling, and that her friend must have\r\nbeen convinced that 'love's reason' is _not_ always without reason. The\r\nletter proceeds:\r\n\r\n'I very well know that my father is prejudiced, Sue, but old men's\r\nprejudices become a part and parcel of themselves, and they can not be\r\ncured of them. My father's do not spring from any drop of bitterness,\r\nfor he has not one--nor from egotism, for he has none of it; but, as you\r\nknow, his early life was in Boston, and his only society is there, and\r\nhe naturally partakes the opinions of his cotemporaries, who--the few\r\nsurviving--believe all foreigners to be a sort of 'outside barbarians,'\r\nand especially regard those who have participated in the revolutionary\r\nmovements of Europe as impertinent invaders of our exclusive birthright\r\nto 'liberty, equality, and the pursuit of happiness.' Artists, in the\r\ncreed of these good old gentlemen, are mere vagrants; and so my father\r\ncomes to look upon Carl's intense love of his art, and his confidence in\r\nhis future success, justified as it is by that already achieved, as a\r\nmere hallucination. So it is all ended--_for the present_. How subtle is\r\nhope! it still lurks in my heart in spite of the strongest probability\r\nthat all is ended _forever_.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     GLEN-HOUSE, _White Hills, October 3d_.--I am resuming my unfinished\r\n     letter to you, my dear Sue, much nearer heaven than I began it. The\r\n     day of Carl's sailing from New-York, my father proposed to me to go\r\n     to Boston, take up Alice there, and come up to the hill-country.\r\n     Dear father! he was offering me a lump of sugar after the bitter\r\n     medicine, and I accepted it, sure at least of a momentary sweet\r\n     sensation, and very sure that my poor father felt comforted by the\r\n     self-complacency flowing from the enormous sacrifice he was making\r\n     in coming up to the highlands at this cold season. My sister was\r\n     glad enough to get a holiday from her nursery, so, on Monday, the\r\n     second of October, a mellow, beautiful day, we came into Boston to\r\n     take the two o'clock cars for Portland. We had three hours upon our\r\n     hands, which were pleasantly filled up by visits to a studio and a\r\n     picture-shop, and finally to refresh our mortal part, which had\r\n     been running down while we were feasting the immortal, to a\r\n     restaurateur's.\r\n\r\n     We groped our way up-stairs into a little back-room in School\r\n     street, where, if we did not find luxuries and elegance, we did\r\n     wholesome fare and civility. The rail-ride to Portland was dusty\r\n     but brief, and we arrived there in time to see its beautiful harbor\r\n     while the water reflected the roses thrown by the last rays of the\r\n     sun upon the twilight clouds. We eschewed the hotel, and were\r\n     kindly received at the boarding-house of a Miss Jones, a single\r\n     woman somewhere between thirty and forty, who so blends dignity\r\n     with graciousness, that she made us feel more like guests than\r\n     customers. One might well mistake her reception for a welcome. Her\r\n     house is a model, adding variety and abundance to the perfection,\r\n     in all but these attributes, of the table of an English inn, and\r\n     having the quiet and completeness, neatness and elegance, that have\r\n     made the English tavern a classic type of comfort. It seems this\r\n     house with its high repute, was the inheritance of two sisters from\r\n     their mother, of whom we were told an anecdote which may be\r\n     apocryphal, but which certainly would not be discordant with the\r\n     character of Sir Roger de Coverley. The old lady finished her\r\n     patriarchal days serenely, and when she was dying, begged that the\r\n     order of her house might be in no wise disturbed by the event of\r\n     her decease, but that 'the gentlemen would play their evening game\r\n     of whist as usual'!\r\n\r\n     Miss Jones's morning face was as benign as her evening countenance\r\n     had been. No lady could have administered hospitality with more\r\n     refinement. We were to be at the station before seven, and just as\r\n     our carriage-door was closing, it was reopened, and a rough but\r\n     decent country-woman was shoved in, the driver muttering something\r\n     about there being no other conveyance for her. My father looked a\r\n     little awry, not with any thought of remonstrating against the\r\n     procedure--no native American would do that, you know--but he was\r\n     just lighting his after-breakfast segar, and he shrunk from the\r\n     impropriety of smoking in such close quarters, with even such a\r\n     woman-stranger. 'I hope, madam,' he said, 'a segar does not offend\r\n     you?' 'La! no, sir,' replied our rustic friend most good-naturedly,\r\n     'I like it.' My father's geniality is always called forth by the\r\n     touch of his segar. He said, with a smile at the corners of his\r\n     mouth: 'Perhaps, madam, you would try one yourself.' 'I would!' she\r\n     answered eagerly. My father hospitably selected his best segar,\r\n     which she took, saying: 'Thank you kindly, sir. I s'pose I can\r\n     light it at the end of yours.' My dear, fastidious father\r\n     heroically breasted this juxtaposition, and the good woman,\r\n     unconscious of any thing but her keen enjoyment of the unlooked-for\r\n     boon, smoked away vigorously. Alice, who never loses sight of her\r\n     duty to avert a possible mischance from any human being, rather\r\n     verdantly suggested, 'that the segar might make her sick.' 'Mercy,\r\n     child! I am used to pipes,' she replied; which, indeed, we might\r\n     have inferred from her manner of holding the segar. Her rapid puffs\r\n     soon resulted in the necessity usually engendered by smoking, and\r\n     half-rising from her seat it was too evident that she mistook the\r\n     pure plate-glass for empty space. My father let down the glass as\r\n     if he had been shot, but she, no wise discomposed, even by our\r\n     laughing, (for Alice and I could not resist it,) merely said,\r\n     coolly: 'Why, I didn't calculate right, did I?' There are\r\n     idiosyncrasies in Yankeedom, there is no doubt of it. We had a long\r\n     drive to the cars, but there our close companionship, and our\r\n     acquaintance, too, ended, except that the woman's husband--for she\r\n     had a husband, some Touchstone, whose 'humor' it was to 'take that\r\n     no other man would,' came to me, and asked me to put my window\r\n     down, for his 'wife was sick.' But as I had just observed the good\r\n     woman munching a bit of mince-pie, I thought that, coming so close\r\n     upon the segar might possibly offend her stomach more than the\r\n     fresh, untainted air, so I declined, as courteously as possible,\r\n     with the answer I have always ready for similar requests, 'that I\r\n     keep my window open to preserve the lives of the people in the\r\n     car.' 'That's peculiar!' I heard her murmur; but her serenity was\r\n     no wise discomposed by my refusal, or her sickness. Surely the\r\n     imperturbable good-nature of our people is national and peculiar.\r\n\r\n     By the way, there were notices posted up in these cars, which\r\n     reminded us that we were near the English Provinces, and under\r\n     their influence. The notices ran thus: 'Gentlemen are requested not\r\n     to put their feet on the cushions, and not to spit on the floor,\r\n     and to maintain a respectable cleanliness. The Conductors are\r\n     required to enforce these requests.' Must we wait for the\r\n     millennium to see a like request and like enforcement in our own\r\n     cars?\r\n\r\n     We found ourselves surrounded by intelligent people of the\r\n     country--_habitués_ who gave us all the local information we asked,\r\n     told us when we came to 'Bryant's Pond,' and that the poor little\r\n     shrunken stream that still brawled and fretted in its narrowed\r\n     channel, along which we were gliding, was the Androscoggin. At\r\n     Gorham, but seven miles from the Glen-House, we found a wagon\r\n     awaiting passengers, 'the last of the season,' we were told. 'The\r\n     houses are all closed,' (he spoke technically) added our driver,\r\n     'and the cold has already been so tedious that the _bubble_ has\r\n     burst on Mt. Washington.' 'What! the bubble! What means the man?'\r\n     exclaimed my father. 'Oh!' said I, 'it is only a poor joke upon\r\n     some 'nothing venture, nothing have' people who have come here\r\n     since the company season is past, they have told them the bulb had\r\n     burst.' 'Oh! the bulb! the bulb!' exclaimed my father; 'oh! that's\r\n     it, and I don't in the least doubt it' And as we went on slowly\r\n     making the long ascent, he looked 'sagely sad.' However, Alice was,\r\n     as she always can be, 'bright without the sun,' and my father\r\n     kindly protested that the slight sprinkling that, ever and anon,\r\n     reminded us of our exposure in an open wagon, was no annoyance to\r\n     him, and he even responded to our exclamations of delight at the\r\n     wreaths of mist that floated around the mountains, and dropped over\r\n     their summits, so that our imaginations were not kept in abeyance\r\n     by definite outlines, and we were at liberty to fancy them just as\r\n     high as we wished them. The air was as soft as in the early days of\r\n     September, and our steeds very considerately lingered, thus\r\n     prolonging our pleasure, so that we came into the Glen-House with\r\n     keen appetites, a needful blessing, we thought, when Mr. Thompson,\r\n     its host, said: 'We are not prepared for company in October, and I\r\n     don't know that we shall find any thing but pork and beans to give\r\n     you!' My father looked blank, and blanker yet when we were ushered\r\n     into a parlor where, instead of finding the crackling wood-fire\r\n     that we had fancied indigenous in these mountains, there was one of\r\n     those frightful black stoves that have expelled from our life all\r\n     the poetry of the hearthstone--but, courage, we can open the\r\n     stove-door, and see a sparkle of light and life.\r\n\r\n     10 P.M.--Before bidding you good night, dear Sue, I must tell you\r\n     'pour encourager les autres' who may come after us that our\r\n     scrupulous host performed so much better than he promised, that\r\n     when we were summoned to our dinner it was served in a cosy little\r\n     room, as neatly as a home dinner, and hot, which a hotel meal, _in\r\n     the season_, never is, and that the ghost of the pork and beans\r\n     which had terrified us, was exorcised by actual tender chickens,\r\n     fresh eggs, and plentiful accessories of vegetables and pies; and\r\n     our man, William, the driver, was converted into a waiter, doing\r\n     his part as if he were 'native to the manner.'\r\n\r\n     [N.B.--Our old friend's memorandum was scanty, and so we publish\r\n     but a small extract from it. We smile at his infirmities--more in\r\n     love than ridicule--and are not fond of proclaiming them, and only\r\n     do so in this brief extract to justify our assertion that his\r\n     traveling temper reminded us of English tourists, who would seem to\r\n     make it a point to turn their plates bottom-side upward. The\r\n     father's and daughter's records of the same scenes are both true.\r\n     The one is the right, the other the wrong side of the tapestry.\r\n     Strange, that any eye should make the fatal mistake of looking at\r\n     the last rather than the first.]\r\n\r\n     _September 29th, Anno Domini 18--._ ---- Left my comfortable\r\n     lowland home for unknown parts, and known mountain regions of snow\r\n     and ice. The Lord willing, I am sure of one pleasure--coming home!\r\n\r\n     _Monday Evening._--We had three mortal hours on our hands this\r\n     morning in Boston. I called on my dear old surviving friends of the\r\n     ---- family. Not one of them, they tell me, has yet risked his life\r\n     in a rail-car. Wisdom is not extinct! Called on dear Widow O----,\r\n     who gave me a nice lunch of pickled oysters, rolls and butter, and\r\n     a glass of old Madeira. Meantime the girls were ranging round\r\n     studios(?) and picture-shops. This rage for art has come in with\r\n     the foreign tongues, since my time. Picked them up at a\r\n     restaurateur's. What a misnomer! What refreshment could be found in\r\n     the little back-parlor of a shop, with herds coming in and herd\r\n     going out, and a few faint rays of light stealing in between the\r\n     windows and the walls of back-buildings surrounding them? Came in\r\n     the cars to Portland. Dust disgusting! Shall never again see the\r\n     original color of my coat! Dust laid on inches deep, the continual\r\n     presence of a mob, and peril to life and limb; death staring you in\r\n     the face, ready to grab you at any moment. This is what we get by\r\n     the modern improvement of rail-cars over a gentleman's carriage,\r\n     with select and elect friends, and leisure to look at a beautiful\r\n     country! Travelers now are prisoners under sentence of probable\r\n     death--their jailer being called a _conductor_. Oh! I cry with my\r\n     old friend Touchstone: 'When I was at home, I was in a better\r\n     place!'\r\n\r\n     Rather a nice house, this of the Misses Jones--old-fashioned,\r\n     neatness, and comfort. But the lady should not favor us with the\r\n     company of her guest! Bad butter for tea. And my daughters\r\n     pronounce the house perfect!\r\n\r\n     _Tuesday Morning._--Bad butter again! could eat nothing.\r\n\r\n     _Tuesday Afternoon._--Happy illustration from a smoking old woman,\r\n     this morning, of the pleasant accessories of railroad traveling.\r\n     Found only an open wagon at Gorham, and a rain impending.\r\n     Convenience of travelers much talked of, but in my opinion, the\r\n     convenience of those who transport them is alone consulted.\r\n\r\n     The approach to the mountain, dreary. The girls--Lord, help\r\n     us!--call it beautiful, sublime! Not very cold, but the driver says\r\n     the bulb has already burst on Mount Washington! What an arrant old\r\n     fool I was to propose coming up here! The 'Glen-House closed!' But\r\n     the landlord graciously, as a favor, 'took us in'--a 'take in' to\r\n     the tune of his summer-prices, no doubt. Fried salt-ham at dinner,\r\n     and mince-pie for a supplement!\r\n\r\n     Went with the girls to walk, and plunged into forest-paths, where,\r\n     instead of our broad, smiling, home meadows, and orchards, and\r\n     gardenspots, we could see nothing but the ghostly mountains in\r\n     their fog-shrouds, and precipices, and uprooted trees, and that\r\n     plague of our Egypt--Paddies--who are making a road to the summit\r\n     of Mount Washington, that men, women, and much cattle may be\r\n     dragged up to see a savage view--ninety-nine times out of a hundred\r\n     befogged!\r\n\r\n     _Wednesday._--Well, here we are! raining all night, and when I\r\n     could sleep, haunted by dire mischances, torrents, slides, etc.\r\n     Waked by a devilish gong! Hot biscuits, potatoes, and corn-bread,\r\n     on the breakfast-table; could eat none of them. Villainous tea!\r\n     Raining and sunshining alternately, so that no mortal can tell\r\n     whether to go or stay; and meantime here am I, sitting by a gloomy\r\n     window where I can see nothing but these useless mountains. Lord,\r\n     forgive me! The angels do hover about me, even here, in the shape\r\n     of my children! Etc., etc., etc.!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cloudy evening has closed in upon us early. It has been long, but\r\nnot tedious. We began it with reading aloud _The Heir of Redcliffe_. It\r\nis one of those novels of the day that seem to me to preach, as few\r\npreachers do, the true Gospel doctrine. It is so cleverly, so charmingly\r\nwritten, that one is persuaded of the Christian truths of forgiveness\r\nand self-sacrifice, vitalized in the lives of Guy and Amy, without one\r\nthought or argument bristling up against them, as they sometimes do\r\nagainst the ordained preacher. I will try to imitate Amy in her cheerful\r\nsubmission to a disappointment far heavier than mine--for the husband\r\nmust be dearer than the lover.\r\n\r\nYou think me cool, dear friend; I am only trying to be so, and how far I\r\nshall succeed I doubt, as a cold shivering runs through my veins as I\r\nhear the winds and think of Carl on the ocean.\r\n\r\nI laid down my pen. I perceive my father watches me very narrowly. 'My\r\nchild,' he said, 'you are shaking with cold,' (not with 'cold,' I could\r\nhave answered;) 'these confounded stoves,' he added, 'keep one in an\r\nalternate ague and fever; come, waltz round the room with your sister,\r\nand get into a glow.' So, singing our own music, we waltzed till we were\r\nout of breath; and Alice has seated herself at picquet with my father,\r\nwho has a run of luck, 'point! seizieme! and capote!' which puts him\r\ninto high good humor--and I may write unmarked, and let my thoughts,\r\nunbridled, fly off after Carl. He was to write me once more before his\r\nembarkation, but I can not get the letter till we return, and I have not\r\nthe poor consolation of looking over the list of the steamer's\r\npassengers and seeing the strange names of those who would seem to me\r\nhappy enough to be in the same ship with him--and yet, what care they\r\nfor that! Poor fellow! he will be but sorry company, I know. I find\r\nsupport in the faith that I am doing my duty. He could not see it in\r\nthat light, and had neither comfort for himself nor sympathy for me. I\r\nalmost wish now, when I think of him in his desolation, that I could\r\nreceive the worldly philosophy my old nurse offered me when, as Carl\r\ndrove away, she came into my room and found me crying bitterly. She\r\nhushed me tenderly as she was used to do when I was a child; and when I\r\nsaid, 'Hannah, it is for him, not for myself, I feel'--'Oh! that's\r\nnothing but a nonsense, child,' she said, 'men an't that way; they go\r\nabout among folks and get rid of feelings; it's women that stay at home\r\nand keep 'em alive, brooding on 'em!' Will he soon 'get rid' of them?\r\n\r\nWhy should I thus shrink from a consequence I ought to desire? and yet,\r\nin my secret soul, I do shrink from it. But perhaps it will be easier as\r\nI go on, if it be true that\r\n\r\n  'Each goodly thing is hardest to begin;\r\n  But entered in a spacious court, they see\r\n  Both plain, and pleasant to be walked in.'\r\n\r\n_Wednesday Morning._--My father happened to cast his eye across the\r\ntable as I finished my last page, and he saw a tear fall on it. Throwing\r\ndown his cards he said, 'Come, come, children, it's time to go to bed;'\r\nand stooping over me, he kissed me fondly, and murmured: 'Dear, good\r\nchild, I can not stand it if I see you unhappy.' He shall not see me so;\r\nI have risen to-day with this resolution.\r\n\r\nThe rain has been pouring down all night, but at this glorious point of\r\nsight, directly under Mount Washington, we are 'equal to either fate,'\r\ngoing on or staying.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson has again surprised us with a delicious breakfast of tender\r\nchickens, light biscuit, excellent bread, fresh eggs, and that rarest of\r\ncomforts at a hotel, delicious coffee, with a brimming pitcher of cream.\r\nWe wondered at all these domestic comforts, for we have not heard the\r\nflutter of a petticoat in the house till we saw our respectable landlady\r\nin spectacles gliding out of the room. We learned from her that she was\r\nthe only womankind on the 'diggings.' Every thing is neatly done, so we\r\nbless our October star for exempting us from the tardy and careless\r\nservice of chambermaids. While it rains, we walk on the piazza, enjoying\r\nthe beautiful and ever-varying effects of the clouds as they roll down\r\nthe mountains, and roll off--like the shadows on our human life, dear\r\nSusan, that God's love does often lift from it.\r\n\r\nThe Glen-House is on the lowest ridge of the hill that rises opposite to\r\nMount Washington, which, as its name indicates, stands head and\r\nshoulders above the other summits, having no peer. Madison and Monroe\r\ncome next, on the left, and then Jefferson, who appears\r\n(characteristically?) higher than he is. In a line with Mount\r\nWashington, on the other side, are Adams, Clay, etc. These names\r\n(excepting always Washington) do not, with their recent political\r\nassociations, seem quite to suit these sublime, eternal mounts, but as\r\ntime rolls on, the names will grow to signs of greatness, and harmonize\r\nwith physical stability and grandeur. Jefferson's head seems quite\r\nconsistently modeled after an European pattern. It runs up to a sharp\r\npoint, and wants but accumulated masses of ice to be broken into Alpine\r\nangles. My father says there are other passes in the mountains more\r\nbeautiful than this--none can be grander.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy father has been most sweet and tender to me to-day, dear Susan.\r\nWhenever he lays his hand upon my head or shoulder, it seems like a\r\nbenediction; and Alice is so kind, projecting future pleasures and sweet\r\nsolaces for me. You know how I love her little girl. To-day, while we\r\nwere walking, she heard me sigh, and putting her arm around me, she\r\nsaid: 'Will you let Sara come and pass the winter with you and father?'\r\nI trust my look fully answered her. I can not yet talk even with her as\r\nI do on paper to you--a kind of confidential implement is a pen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have all been walking, in the lowering twilight, on the turnpike,\r\nwhich is making by a joint-stock company, up Mount Washington, The road,\r\nby contract, is to be finished in three years; the cost is estimated at\r\nsixty-three thousand dollars. The workmen, of course, are nearly all\r\nIrishmen, with Anglo-Saxon heads to direct them. The road is, as far as\r\npossible, to be secured by frequent culverts, and by macadamizing it,\r\nfrom the force of winter torrents. But that nothing is impossible to\r\nmodern science, it would seem impossible to vanquish the obstacles to\r\nthe enterprise, the inevitable steepness of the ascent, the rocky\r\nprecipices, etc. We amused ourselves with graduating the intellectual\r\ndevelopment of the Celtic workmen by their answers to our questions:\r\n'When is the road to be finished?' 'And, faith, sir, it must be done\r\nbefore winter comes, down below.' The next replied: 'When the year comes\r\nround.' And another: 'Some time between now and niver.' 'Friend,' said I\r\nto one of them, 'have you such high mountains in Ireland?' 'Yis, indeed,\r\nthat we have, and higher--five miles high!' Paddy is never over-crowed.\r\n'Straight up?' I asked. 'By my faith and troth, straight up, it is.' 'In\r\nwhat part of Ireland is that mountain?' 'In county Cork.' 'Of course, in\r\ncounty Cork!' said my father, and we passed on through the _débris_ of\r\nblasted rocks, stumps of uprooted trees, and heaps of stones, till we\r\ngot far enough into the mountain to feel the sublimity of its stern,\r\nsilent solitude, with the night gathering its shroud of clouds about it,\r\nand we were glad to pick our way back to our cheerful tea-table at Mr.\r\nThompson's. We had a long evening before us, but we diversified it (my\r\nfather hates monotony, and was glad of 'something different,' as he\r\ncalled it) by bowling--my father pitting Alice against me. She beat me,\r\naccording to her general luck in life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Thursday Morning, October 6th._--The weather still uncertain, but more\r\nbeautiful in its effects on these grand mountains, in their October\r\nglory, than I can describe to you. They are grand--Mount Washington[A]\r\nbeing higher than Mount Rhigi and Mount Rhigi is majestic even in the\r\npresence of Mont Blanc and of the Jungfrau. The rich coloring of our\r\nautumnal foliage is unknown in Europe, and how it lights up with\r\nbrilliant smiles the dark, stern face of the mountains! Even when the\r\nsun is clouded, the beeches that skirt the evergreens look like a golden\r\nfringe, radiant in the sun; and wherever they are seemingly rippling\r\nadown the mountain's side, they make 'sunshine in a shady place.' The\r\nmaples are flame-colored, and in masses so bright that you can scarcely\r\nlook steadily on them; and where they are small, and stand singly, they\r\nresemble (to compare the greater to the less) flamingos lighted on the\r\nmountain-side. Then there is the infinite diversity of coloring--the\r\nsoft brown, the shading off into pale yellow, and the delicate\r\nMay-green. None but a White of Selborne, with his delicately-defining\r\npen, could describe them. While we stood on the piazza admiring and\r\nexclaiming, the obliging Mr. Thompson brought out a very good telescope,\r\nand adjusted it so that our eyes could explore the mountains. He pointed\r\nout the foot and bridle-path to the summit of Mount Washington. Various\r\nobstacles have prevented our attempting the ascent. If my father would\r\nhave trusted us to guides, there are none in October, nor trained\r\nhorses; for as the feed is brought from below, they are sent down to the\r\nlowlands as soon as _the season_ is over. Besides, the summits are now\r\npowdered with snow, and the paths near the summits slippery with ice.\r\nAnd though I like the scramble, and the achievement of attaining a\r\ndifficult eminence, I much prefer the nearer, better defined, and less\r\nsavage views below it. Guided by my landlord, my eye had followed the\r\npath past two huge, out-standing rocks which look like Druidical\r\nmonuments, to the summit of Mount Washington, where I had the pleasure\r\nof descrying and announcing the figure of a man. My father and Alice\r\nboth looked, but could not make it out. I referred to Mr. Thompson, and\r\nhis accustomed eye confirmed the accuracy of mine. Mr. Thompson was much\r\nexercised with conjectures as to where the traveler came from. He had\r\nseen none for the last few days in the mountains except our party, and\r\nhe naturally concluded the man had made his ascent from the Crawford\r\nHouse. My eye seemed spell-bound to the glass. I mentally speculated\r\nupon the character and destiny of the pilgrim who, at this season, and\r\nalone, could climb up those steeps. My imagination invested him with a\r\nstrange interest. He had wandered far away from the world, and above it.\r\nThere was something in his mind--perhaps in his destiny--akin to the\r\nseverity of this barren solitude. The spell was broken by a call from my\r\nfather: 'Come, Mary; are you glued to that glass?' he exclaimed; 'the\r\nrain is over, and we are off in half an hour.' And so we were--with\r\nThompson, Jr., for our driver, one of our young countrymen who always\r\nmake me proud, dear Susan, performing well the task of your inferior,\r\nwith the capacity and self-respect of your equal. Long live the true\r\nrepublicanism of New-England!\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: Mount Washington is six thousand seven hundred feet high.]\r\n\r\nMy father had been rather nettled in the morning by what he thought an\r\nattempt, on the part of Mr. Thompson, to take advantage of our\r\ndependence, and charge us exorbitantly for conveying us thirty-three\r\nmiles to the Mountain-Notch; but, on talking the matter over with our\r\nhost, he found that his outlay, with tolls, and other expenses, was such\r\nthat he only made what every Yankee considers his birthright, 'a good\r\nbusiness' out of us; so, my father being relieved from the dread of\r\nimposition, was in happy condition all day, and permitted us, without a\r\nmurmur of impatience, to detain him, while we went off the road to see\r\none of the two celebrated cascades of the neighborhood. It was the Glen\r\nEllis Fall. We compromised, and gave up seeing the Crystal Fall, a\r\nhalf-mile off the road on the other side; and enjoyed the usual\r\nconsolation bestowed on travelers on like occasions, of being told that\r\nthe one we did not see was far best worth seeing. However, we hold all\r\nthese wild leaps of mountain streams to be worth seeing, each having an\r\nindividual beauty; and advise all who may follow in our traces, to go to\r\nthe top and bottom of the Glen Ellis.\r\n\r\nI have often tried to analyze the ever fresh delight of seeing a\r\nwater-fall, and have come to the conclusion that it partly springs from\r\nthe scramble to get at the best and all the points of view, setting the\r\nblood in the most sluggish veins to dancing, and, as you know, '_tout\r\ndepend de la manière que le sang circule_.'\r\n\r\nI can not describe to you, my dear Susan, the enjoyment of this day's\r\nride. As heart to heart, my father's serenity answered to my\r\ncheerfulness, and rewarded it. Our cup was brimming and sparkling. There\r\nwas a glowing vitality in the western breeze that blew all the clouds\r\nfrom our spirits, and shaped those on the mountain-sides into\r\never-changing beauty, or drove them off the radiant summits. We laughed,\r\nas the vapor condensing into the smallest of hailstones, came pelting in\r\nour faces as if the elements had turned boys and threw them in sport!\r\nWhat may not Nature be to us--play-fellow, consoler, teacher, religious\r\nminister! Strange that any one wretch should be found to live without\r\nGod in the world, when the world is permeated with its Creator!\r\n\r\nOur level road wound through the Pinkham woods in the defiles of the\r\nmountains, and at every turn gave them to us in a new aspect. It seemed\r\nto me that the sun had never shone so brightly as it now glanced into\r\nthe forest upon the stems of the white birches--Wordsworth's 'ladies of\r\nthe wood'--and danced on the mosaic carpet made by the brilliant fallen\r\nleaves. We missed the summer-birds, but the young partridges abounded,\r\nand, hardly startled by our wheels, often crossed our path. We saw a\r\nfox, who turned and very quietly surveyed us, as if to ask who the\r\nbarbarians were that so out of season invaded his homestead. One of\r\nus--I will not tell you which, lest you discredit the story--fancying,\r\nwhile the wagon was slowly ascending, to make a cross-cut on foot\r\nthrough some woodland, saw a bear--yes, a bear! face to face, and made,\r\nyou may be sure, a forced march to the highway. The mountaineers were\r\nnot at all surprised when we recounted what we fancied a hair-breadth\r\n'scape, but quietly told us that 'three bears had been seen in that\r\nneighborhood lately, but bears did no harm unless provoked, or\r\ndesperately hungry!' It was not a very pleasant thought that our lives\r\ndepended on the chances of Bruin's appetite.\r\n\r\nThis meeting with the fox--the Mercury of the woods--and with the\r\nbear--the hero of many a dramatic fable--would, in the forests of the\r\nOld World, and in prolific Old World fancies, have been wrought into\r\npretty legends or traditions for after-ages. I might have figured as the\r\n\r\n  'Forsaken, woful, solitary maid,\r\n  In wilderness and wasteful deserts strayed,'\r\n\r\nset on by the 'ramping beast;' and for the knight? why, it would be easy\r\nto convert the wanderer I descried on the summit of Mount Washington,\r\ninto a lover and deliverer, whose 'allegiance and fast fealty' had bound\r\nhim to my trail. But, alas! there is no leisure in this material age for\r\nfancy-weaving; and all our way was as bare of tradition or fable as if\r\nno human footstep had impressed it, till we came to a brawling stream\r\nnear Davis's, crossing the way, which we were told was called 'Nancy's\r\nBrook.' We heard various renderings of the origin of the name, but all\r\nended in one source--man's perjury and woman's trust. A poor girl, some\r\nsaid, had come with a woodsman, a collier, or tree-feller, and lived\r\nwith him in the mountains, toiling for him, and 'singing to him,' no\r\ndoubt, 'when she his evening food did dress,' till he grew tired, and\r\none day went forth and did not come back; and day after day she waited,\r\nbut her Theseus did not return, and she was starved to death on the\r\nbrink of the little brook that henceforward was to murmur her tragic\r\ntale.\r\n\r\nThe sun was set to us behind the ridge of Mount Willard, when we reached\r\nthe 'Willey Slide,' and Alice and I walked the last two miles to the\r\n'Mountain Notch.' Just after we alighted from the wagon, and while we\r\nwere yet close to it, at a turn in the road I perceived a pedestrian\r\ntraveler before us, who, seeming startled by the sound of our wheels,\r\nsprang lightly over the fence. I involuntarily withdrew my arm from\r\nAlice's, and stood still, gazing after him for the half-instant that\r\npassed before he disappeared in the forest.\r\n\r\n'Are you frightened?' said Alice; 'this is a lonely road; shall I hail\r\nthe wagon?'\r\n\r\n'Oh! no,' I replied.\r\n\r\n'But,' she urged, 'this may be some fugitive from justice.'\r\n\r\n'Nonsense, Alice; don't you see by his air that he is a gentleman?'\r\n\r\n'No,' she saw nothing 'but that he was light of foot, and anxious to\r\nescape observation.'\r\n\r\nI had seen more; I had seen, or my mind being prepossessed by one image,\r\nI had shaped the reality to the imagination, as ghost-seers do, and in\r\nthe pedestrian had seen that form that henceforward is to me as if it\r\nhad passed the bourne whence no traveler returns. It was a mere fancy.\r\nAlice--she is a cautious little woman--was continually looking back,\r\nfrom fear; and I--I may as well confess it--from hope; but we saw\r\nnothing more of the traveler. He was truly a fugitive from us--or, more\r\nprobably, in spite of the gentlemanly graces my imagination had lent\r\nhim, a collier returning to his shanty in the forest. The apparition had\r\nspoiled our twilight walk. The brief twilight of October was shortened\r\nby the mountains that rise like walls on either side of the road, and\r\nAlice hurried forward, so that we had no time to look for the cascades,\r\nand forms of animals, and profiles of men, that we had been forewarned\r\nwe should see on the hill-sides. The stars were coming out, and the full\r\nmoon--indicated by the floods of silver light it sent up from behind\r\nMount Webster--when we passed through the portal of the 'Notch' and came\r\nupon the level area where the 'Crawford House' now stands.\r\n\r\nHere we found my father, already seated in a rocking-chair by a broad\r\nhearthstone and a roaring, crackling fire. And beside these cheering\r\ntypes of home-contentments, he had found a gentleman from the\r\nlow-country, with whom he was already in animated discourse. The\r\nstranger was a fine, intelligent, genteel-looking person, who proved to\r\nbe a clergyman whom Alice had once before met at the Flume-House. He is\r\na true lover of nature and explorer of nature's secrets, a geologist,\r\nbotanist, etc., etc., and he most wisely comes up to the high places at\r\nall seasons, whenever he feels the need of refreshment to his bodily and\r\nmind's eye. Perhaps he finds here an arcana for his theology; and I am\r\nsure that after a study here he may go hence a better as well as a wiser\r\nman, and better able, by his communings here, to inform and mold the\r\nminds of others. No teachers better understood the sources and means of\r\nmental power and preparation than Moses and Mohammed; and their studies\r\nwere not in theological libraries, but in the deepest of nature's\r\nsolitudes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps our friend has no direct purpose beyond his own edification in\r\nhis rambles in the mountains. He is familiar with every known resort\r\namong them, and most kindly disposed to give us thoroughfare travelers\r\ninformation. He made for us, from memory, a pencil-sketch of the peaks\r\nto be seen from Mount Willard, with their names. We verified them\r\nto-day, and found the outline as true as if it had been daguerreo-typed.\r\nAn observation so keen, and a memory so accurate, are to be envied.\r\n\r\nThis house, at the Mountain Notch, is called the Crawford House. The old\r\nCrawford House, familiar to the pioneer travelers in this region, stands\r\na few rods from it, or rather did, till the past winter, when it was\r\nburned, and its site is now marked by a few charred timbers. Old\r\nCrawford's memory will live, as one of these eternal hills bears his\r\nname. He lived to a good old age, and for many years in rather awful\r\nsolitude here, and at the last with some of the best blessings that wait\r\non age, 'respect, and troops of friends.' His son--whose stature, broad\r\nshoulders, and stolid aspect bring to mind the Saxon peasant of the\r\nmiddle ages--is driver, in the season, and sportsman in and out of it.\r\nHe stood at the door this morning as we were driving off to the Falls of\r\nthe Ammonoosuck, with his fowling-piece in hand, and asked leave to\r\noccupy a vacant seat in the wagon. My father was a sportsman in his\r\nyouth--some forty years ago; his heart warms at the sight of a gun, and\r\nbesides, I fancy, he had some slight hope of mending our cheer by a\r\nbrace of partridges; so he very cheerfully acquiesced in Crawford's\r\nrequest. Alice and I plied him with questions, hoping to get something\r\nout of an old denizen of the woods. But he knew nothing, or would tell\r\nnothing; the 'tongues in trees' were far more fluent than his. But even\r\nso stony a medium had power, afterward, to make my heart beat. I was\r\nstanding near him at the Falls, and away from the rest, and I asked him\r\n(Sue, I confess I have been either thinking or dreaming of that\r\n'fugitive' all night) if he had seen a foot-traveler pass along the road\r\nlast evening or this morning. 'No; there was few travelers any way in\r\nOctober.' He vouchsafed a few more words, adding: 'It's a pity folks\r\ndon't know the mountains are never so pretty as in October, and sport\r\nnever so smart!' Was there ever a sportsman the dullest, the most\r\nimpassive, but he had some perception of woodland beauty? While we were\r\ntalking, and I was seemingly measuring with my eye the depth of the\r\nwater, as transparent as the air, my father and sister had changed their\r\nposition, and come close to me. 'Oh!' said the man, 'I recollect--I did\r\nsee a _stranger_ on Mount Willard this morning, when I went out with my\r\ngun--he was drawing the mountains; a great many of the young folks try\r\nto do it, but they don't make much likeness.'\r\n\r\nPerhaps this timely generalization of friend Crawford, prevented my\r\nfather and Alice's thought following the direction of mine. I _know_\r\nthis youth is not Carl Heiner, it is not even possible he should be; and\r\nyet, the resemblance that in my one glance I had fancied to perceive to\r\nhim, and the coincidence of the sketching, had invested him with a power\r\nto make my cheeks burn, and my hands cold as ice. I stole off and looked\r\nat the deep, smooth cavities the water had welled in the rocks, but I\r\ndid not escape my sister's woman's eye.\r\n\r\n'Mary, dear,' she whispered, when she joined me, 'you are not so strong\r\nas you think yourself.'\r\n\r\nDear Susan, if I am not strong, I will be patient; patience, you will\r\nsay, implies a waiting for something to come; well, let it be so; can a\r\nspark of hope live under the ashes I have heaped upon it?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rocks are very beautiful at these Falls of the Ammonoosuck. The\r\nstream which never here can be a river, is now, by the unusual droughts\r\nof the summer, shrunken to a mere rill, but even now, and at all\r\nseasons, it must be worth the drive to see it. Worth the drive! a drive\r\nany where in these hills 'pays'--to borrow the slang of this bank-note\r\nworld--for itself. It is a pure enjoyment. On our return we repeatedly\r\nsaw young partridges in our path, nearly as tame as the chickens of the\r\nCasse-cour. The whir-r-ing of their wings struck a spark even from our\r\nsportsman's eye, and--a far easier achievement--started the blood in my\r\nfather's veins. The instinct to kill game is, I believe, universal with\r\nman, else how should it still live in my father, who, though he blusters\r\nlike Monkbarns, is very much of an Uncle Toby in disposition. He sprang\r\nfrom the wagon, borrowed Crawford's gun, and reminding Alice and me so\r\nmuch of Mr. Pickwick, that we laughed in spite of our terror lest he\r\nshould kill, not the partridge, but himself; but, luckily, he escaped\r\nunhurt--and so did the bird. Crawford secured two or three brace of them\r\nin the course of the morning's drive. I fear we shall relish them at\r\nbreakfast, to-morrow, in spite of our lamentations over their untimely\r\nloss of their pleasant mountain-life. I asked our driver how they\r\nsurvived the winter (if haply they escaped the fowler) in these high\r\nlatitudes? 'Oh!' he said, 'they had the neatest way of folding their\r\nlegs under their wings and lying down in the snow.' They subsist on\r\nberries and birchen-buds--dainty fare, is it not?\r\n\r\nWe found a very comfortable dinner awaiting us, which rather surprised\r\nus, as our landlord, Mr. Lindsay, a very civil, obliging person, and a\r\nnew proprietor here, I believe, had promised us but Lenten\r\nentertainment; but 'deeds, not words,' seems the motto of these\r\nmountaineers.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we drove up Mount Willard; 'straight up Ben Lomond did\r\nwe press,' but our horses seemed to find no difficulty for themselves,\r\nand made no danger for us in the ascent. I shall not attempt to describe\r\nthe view. I have never seen any mountain prospect resembling that of the\r\ndeep ravine (abyss?) with its convex mountain-sides. The turnpike-road,\r\nlooking like a ribbon carelessly unwound, the only bit of level to be\r\nseen, and prolonged for miles. The distant mountains that bound the\r\nprospect you may see elsewhere, but this ravine, with the traces of the\r\n'Willey Slide' on one side of it, has no parallel. Don't laugh at me for\r\nthe homeliness of the simile--it suggested a gigantic cradle. Here, as\r\nelsewhere, we were dazzled by the brilliancy of the October foliage, and\r\nhaving found a seat quite as convenient as a sofa, though being of rock,\r\nnot quite so easy, we loitered till the last golden hue faded from the\r\nhighest summit. And we should have staid to see the effect of the rising\r\nmoon on the summits, contrasting with the black shadows of night in the\r\nabyss, but my father had observed that our driver had neglected the\r\nprecaution of blanketing his horses; and as a mother is not more\r\nwatchful of a sucking-child than he is of the well-being of animals, it\r\nmatters not whether they are his own, he begged us to sacrifice our\r\nromance to their safety. Alice and I walked down the mountain; it was\r\nbut a half-hour's easy walk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have forborne talking with Alice on the subject that haunts me in\r\nspite of myself. I know I have her sympathy and her approval; and that\r\nshould satisfy me. But this evening, as we were returning, she said:\r\n\r\n'Did you feel any electric influence as we sat looking at the view\r\nCrawford's '_stranger_' sketched this morning?'\r\n\r\n'I thought of Carl,' I honestly answered, and turned the subject.\r\n\r\nAlas! Sue, when do I not think of him?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPROFILE HOUSE, _Saturday Evening_.--We have again, to-day, experienced\r\nthe advantage of these open mountain-vehicles, which are quite as\r\n'roomy' and as easy as the traveling-jails called stagecoaches, which\r\nalways remind me of Jonah's traveling accommodations. Again, to-day, we\r\nhave been enchanted with the brilliancy of the foliage. It is just at\r\nthe culminating point of beauty, and I think it does not remain at this\r\npoint more than three or four days when you perceive it is a thought\r\nless bright. Why is it that no painting of our autumnal foliage has\r\nsucceeded? It has been as faithfully imitated as the colors on the\r\npallet can copy these living, glowing colors; but those who have best\r\nsucceeded--even Cole, with his accurate eye, and faithful, beautiful\r\nart--have but failed. The pictures, if toned down, are dull; if up to\r\nnature, are garish to repulsiveness. Is it not that nature's toning is\r\ninimitable, and that the broad overhanging firmament with its cold,\r\nserene blue, and the soft green of the herbage, and brown of the reaped\r\nharvest-fields, temper to the eye the intervening brilliancy, and that,\r\nwithin the limits of a picture, there is not sufficient expanse to\r\nreproduce these harmonies?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Saturday Evening._--We have driven some twenty-three miles--from the\r\nMountain Notch to the Franconian Notch--to-day; the weather has been\r\ndelicious. The drive has been more prosaic, more commonplace, or\r\napproaching to it, than we have before traveled in this hill country.\r\nThis October coloring would make far tamer scenery beautiful, but I can\r\nfancy it very bleak and dismal when 'blow, blow November's winds,'\r\nwhereas here, at the Franconian Notch, you feel as it were housed and\r\nsecured by nature's vast fortresses and defences. The 'Eagle's Cliff' is\r\non one side of you, and Mount Cannon (called so from a resemblance of a\r\nrock on the summit to a cannon) on the other, and they so closely fold\r\nand wall you in, that you need but a poetic stretch of the arms to touch\r\nthem with either hand; and when the sun glides over the arch in the\r\nzenith above--but a four hours' visible course in mid-winter--you might\r\nfancy yourself sheltered from the sin and sorrow that great Eye\r\nwitnesseth.\r\n\r\nYou will accuse me, I know, dear, rational friend, of being '_exalté_,'\r\n(vernacular, cracked,) but remember, we are alone in these inspiring\r\nsolitudes, free from the disenchantment of the eternal buzzing and\r\nswarming of the summer-troops that the North gives up, and the South\r\nkeeps not back.\r\n\r\nWe were received at the Profile House with a most smiling welcome by Mr.\r\nWeeks, the _pro tem._ host, who promises to make us 'as comfortable as\r\nis in his power,' and is substantiating his promise by transferring his\r\ndinner-table from the long, uncarpeted dinner-saloon with its fearful\r\nrows of bare chairs and tables, to a well-furnished, home-looking\r\napartment, where a fire-place worthy of the middle ages, is already\r\nbrightened with a hospitable fire. The great rambling hotel is vacant,\r\nand its silence unbroken, save by the hastening to and fro of our\r\nwilling host, who unites all offices of service in his own person, and\r\nthe pattering of his pretty little boy's feet--the little fellow\r\nfollowing him like his shadow, and, perchance, running away from other\r\nshadows in this great empty house. The little fellow makes music to my\r\near; there is no pleasanter sound than the footsteps of a child.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI left Alice dressing for dinner--I think Alice would perform the\r\nceremonial of a lady if she were shipwrecked on a desert island--and my\r\nfather awaiting dinner. Dear father is never the pleasantest company at\r\nthese seasons, when 'time stands still withal,' or rather, to him, keeps\r\na snail's fretting pace. Well, I left them both and went down to the\r\nlake, a short walk, to greet the 'Old Man of the Mountain,' as they\r\nprosaically call the wonderful head at the very summit of the Headland\r\nCliff, upreared on high over the beautiful bit of water named 'The Old\r\nMan's Punch-bowl.' The nomenclature of our country certainly does not\r\nindicate one particle of poetry or taste in its people. There are, to be\r\nsure, namesakes of the old world which intimate the exile's loving\r\nmemories, and there are scattered, here and there, euphonious and\r\nsignificant Indian names, not yet superseded by Brownvilles or\r\nSmithdales, but for the most part, one would infer that pedagogues,\r\nsophomores, and boors, had presided at the baptismal-font of the land.\r\nTo call that severe Dantescan head, which it would seem impossible that\r\naccident should have formed, so defined and expressive is its outline,\r\nlike the Sphynx, a mystery in the desert--to call it the Old Man of the\r\nMountain, is irreverence, desecration! I and this exquisite little lake,\r\nlapped amid the foldings and windings of the mountains, whose 'million\r\nunseen spirits' may do the bidding of that heroic old Prospero who\r\npresides over it--to call this gem of the forest a 'Punch-bowl,' is a\r\nsorry travesty. I paid my homage to him while his profile cut the\r\nglowing twilight, and then sat down at the brim of the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Susan,\r\n\r\n       ----'the leanings\r\n  Of the close trees o'er the brim,\r\n  Had a sound beneath their leaves.'\r\n\r\nAnd--I will borrow two lines more to help out my confession--\r\n\r\n  'Driftings of my dream do light\r\n  All the skies, by day and night.'\r\n\r\nBut truly, it is mere drift-wood, not fit even to build a 'castle in the\r\nair.'\r\n\r\nI was startled from my musings by a rustling of the branches behind me,\r\nand I turned, expecting--not to see a bear or a fox, but my fancies\r\nincorporate. The leaves were still quivering, but I saw no apparent\r\ncause for so much disturbance. I probably had startled a brace of\r\npartridges from their roost. They brought me back to the actual world,\r\nand I came home to an excellent dinner, which I found my father\r\npractically commending.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sunday._--My father has brought us up to so scrupulous an observance of\r\nthe Puritan Sabbath, that I was rather surprised, this morning, by his\r\nproposition to drive over to the Flume. His equanimity had been\r\ndisturbed by finding one of the horses that had brought us here,\r\nseemingly in a dying condition. He was one of the 'team' that had taken\r\nus on to Mount Willard, and my father had then prophesied that he would\r\nsuffer from the driver's neglect to blanket him. He was in nowise\r\ncomforted by the verification of his 'I told you so!' but walked to and\r\nfro from the stable, watching the remedies administered, and\r\nvituperating all youth as negligent, reckless, and hard-hearted. I think\r\nit was half to get rid of this present annoyance that he proposed the\r\ndrive to the Flume, saying, as he did so: 'These mountains are a great\r\ntemple, my children; it matters not much where we stand to worship.'\r\n\r\nWe stopped for a half-hour at a little fall just by the roadside, called\r\nby the mountain-folk 'The Basin,' and by fine people, 'The Emerald\r\nBowl,' a name suggested by the exquisite hue of the water, which truly\r\nis of as soft and bright a green as an emerald's. The stream has\r\ncuriously cut its way through a rock, whitened, smoothed, and almost\r\npolished by its fretting, which overhangs the deep, circular bowl like a\r\ncanopy, or rather, like a half-uplifted lid, its inner side being\r\nmottled and colored like a beautiful shell. The stream glides over the\r\nbrim of its sylvan bowl and goes on its way rejoicing. We loitered here\r\nfor a half-hour watching the golden and crimson leaves that had dropped\r\nin, and that lay in rich mosaics in the eddies of the stream.\r\n\r\nThe morning was misty, and the clouds were driven low athwart the\r\nmountains, forming, as Alice well said, pedestals on which their lofty\r\nheads were upreared. No wonder that people in mountainous and misty\r\nregions become imaginative, even superstitious. These forms, falling,\r\nrising, floating, over the eternal hills, susceptible of heavenly\r\nbrightness, and deepening into the gloomiest of earth's shadows, spur on\r\nfancy and fear to act at will.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt, my friend, to describe this loveliest of all\r\nfive-mile drives, from the Profile House to the Flume under the Eagle's\r\nCliff, and old 'Prospero,' and beside his lake, and the Emerald Bowl,\r\nand then finished by the most curious, perhaps the most beautiful\r\npassage we have yet seen in the mountains--'The Flume'--thus called,\r\nprobably, from a homely association with the race-way of a mill. The\r\nravine is scarcely more than a fissure, probably made by the gradual\r\nwearing of the stream. I am told the place resembles the Bath of\r\nPfeffers, in Switzerland. That world's wonder can scarcely be more\r\nromantically beautiful than our Flume.\r\n\r\nThe small stream, which is now reduced to a mere rill by the prolonged\r\ndroughts, forces its way between walls of rock, upheaved in huge blocks\r\nlike regular mason-work. Where you enter the passage, it may be some\r\nhundred yards wide, but it gradually contracts till you may almost touch\r\neither side with your outstretched arms. I only measured the height of\r\nthe rock-walls with my eye--and a woman's measure is not very\r\naccurate--it may be one hundred or one hundred and fifty feet. Tall\r\ntrees at the summits interlace, and where they have fallen, bridge the\r\npassage from one side to the other. Rich, velvety mosses cover the rocks\r\nlike a royal garment, and wild vines, almost glittering in their\r\nautumnal brightness, lay on them like rich embroidery, so that we might\r\nsay, as truly as was said of the magnificence of oriental nature, that\r\n'Solomon, in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these.'\r\n\r\nBut how, dear Susan, am I to show the picture to you--the sun glancing\r\non the brilliant forest above us, and the indescribable beauty of the\r\nshrubs--golden, and crimson, and fine purple--that shot out of the\r\ncrevices of the rocks? It is idle to write or talk about it; but only\r\nlet me impress on you that this enchanting coloring is limited to the\r\nfirst days of October. I am afraid it may be said of scenery as has been\r\nsaid of lover's _tête-à-tête_ talks, that it resembles those delicate\r\nfruits which are exquisite where they are plucked, but incapable of\r\ntransmission. As my father can never enjoy any thing selfishly, he was\r\nparticularly pleased with the nice little foot-path won from the\r\nmountain-side, and the frequent foot-bridges that indicate the numbers\r\nthat have taken this wild walk before us. My father fancies he enjoys\r\nour security from the summer swarms, but the social principle born in\r\nhim masters his theories.\r\n\r\nAlice and I were amused this morning, just at the highest access of our\r\nenthusiasm, while we stood under a huge rock wedged in between the two\r\nwalls, on looking back, to see my father sitting on a bench arranged as\r\na point of sight, not gazing, but listening profoundly, his graceful\r\nperson and beautiful old head inclined in an attitude of the deepest\r\nattention to a loafer who had unceremoniously joined us, and who, as my\r\nfather afterwards rather reluctantly confessed, was recounting to him\r\nthe particulars of his recent wooing of a third Mrs. Smith or Mrs.\r\nBrown, or whatever might be her name. And when we returned to our\r\nquarters at the Profile House, and came down to dinner, we met our\r\nlandlord at the door, his face even more than usually effulgent with\r\nsmiles.\r\n\r\n'There has a lady and gentleman come in,' he said, 'and your father has\r\nno objection to their dining at table with you?'\r\n\r\nHis voice was slightly deprecatory; I think he didn't quite give us\r\ncredit for our father's affability. Of course we acquiesced, and were\r\nafterwards edified by our brief acquaintance with the strangers, a\r\nmother and son, who had come up from the petty cares of city life for a\r\nquiet ramble among the hills to find here\r\n\r\n  'A peace no other season knows.'\r\n\r\nThe mother wears widow's weeds, and has evidently arrived at the\r\n'melancholy days.' As we just now sat enjoying our evening fire, 'My\r\nhearthstone,' she said, 'was never cold for seventeen years, but there\r\nis no light there now. My children are dispersed, and he who was dearest\r\nand best lies under the clods. My youngest and I hold together--I can\r\nnot let him go.'\r\n\r\nThe loving companionship of a mother and a son who returns to her\r\ntenderness the support of his manly arm, never shrinking from the\r\nshadows that fall from her darkened and stricken heart, or melting those\r\nshadows in his own sunny youth, is one of the consoling pictures of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThis poor lady seems to have the love of nature which never dies out. It\r\nis pleasant to see with what patience her son cares for the rural wealth\r\nshe is amassing in her progress through the hills, the late flowers and\r\nbright leaves and mosses, though I have detected a boyish, mischievous\r\nsmile as he stowed them away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had something approaching to an adventure this evening on Echo Lake,\r\nthe loveliest of all these mountain lakes, and not more than half a mile\r\nfrom our present inn--the Profile House. Our dear father consented to go\r\nout with us, and let Alice and me, who have been well trained at that\r\nexercise on our home-lake, take our turns with him in rowing. This lake\r\nis embosomed in the forest, and lies close nestled under the mountains\r\nwhich here have varied shape and beautiful outlines. It takes its name\r\nfrom its clear echoes; we called, we sang, and my father whistled, and\r\nfrom the deep recesses of the hills our voices came back as if spirit\r\ncalled to spirit, musical and distinct. You know the root of fascination\r\nthere is in such a scene. The day had continued misty to the last, the\r\ntwilights at this season are at best short, and while my father was\r\nwhistling, one after another, the favorite songs of his youth, we were\r\nsurprised by nightfall. My father startled us with 'Bless me, girls,\r\nwhat are you about?' (it was he who was most entranced,) 'I can not see\r\nour landing-place!'\r\n\r\nNeither, with all possible straining, could our younger eyes descry it.\r\nWe approached as near the shore as we dared, but could go no nearer\r\nwithout the danger of swamping our boat, when suddenly we perceived a\r\nblessed apparition, a long white signal flying, made quite obvious in\r\nthe dim light by a background of evergreens. We rowed toward it with all\r\nour might, wondering what kind friend was waving it so eagerly. As we\r\napproached near the shore it suddenly dropped and hung motionless, and\r\nwhen we landed we saw no person and heard no footstep. I untied the\r\nsignal, and finding it a man's large, fine linen handkerchief, I eagerly\r\nexplored the corner for the name, but the name had evidently just been\r\ntorn off. Strange! We puzzled ourselves with conjectures. My father cut\r\nus short with:\r\n\r\n'It's that young man at the hotel: young folks like this sort of thing.'\r\n\r\nBut it was not he; we found him reading to his mother, who said she was\r\njust about sending him to look after us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus abruptly ended Mary Langdon's journal-letter. The reason of its\r\nsudden discontinuance will be found in our own brief relation of the\r\nexperience of the following morning, (Monday,) which we had from all the\r\nparties that partook in it.\r\n\r\nOur friends were to leave the Profile House on Monday, on their return\r\nto the lowlands, to go from there to the Flume House, visit 'the Pool,'\r\nand then down to the pretty village of Plymouth, in New-Hampshire.\r\n\r\nMary and her sister rose early, and having a spare half-hour before\r\nbreakfast, went down to take a last look of Prospero and his 'Bowl.'\r\nThere they found a crazy, old, leaky boat, with a broken oar, and Mary,\r\nspying some dry bits of board on the shore, deftly threw them in and\r\narranged them so that she and her sister could get in dry-shod. Alice\r\nlooked doubtfully at the crazy little craft and hung back--the thought\r\nof husband and children at home is always a sedative--but her eager\r\nsister overcame her scruples, and they were soon fairly out from shore\r\nin deep water. They went on, half-floating, half-rowing, unconscious of\r\nthe flying minutes. Not so their father, who after waiting breakfast 'an\r\neternity,' (as he said, possibly some five minutes,) came to the lake to\r\nrecall them. Just as he came within fair sight of them--for they were\r\nnot two hundred yards from him--the boat suddenly began whirling round.\r\nAn eddying wind had sprung from the mountain upon them. The poor father\r\nsaw their dilemma, and could not help them. He could not swim. He\r\nscreamed for help, but what likelihood that any one should hear or could\r\naid him?\r\n\r\nAlice prudently sat perfectly still. The oar was in Mary's hand. She\r\ninvoluntarily sprung to her feet; her head became giddy; not so much,\r\nshe afterward averred, with the whirling of the boat as with the sight\r\nof her poor old father, and the sense that she had involved Alice in\r\nthis peril. She plunged the oar into the water in the vain hope, by\r\nfirmly holding it, of steadying the boat; but she dropped it from her\r\ntrembling hand, and in reaching after it, she too dropped over into the\r\nwater, and in her struggle she pushed the boat from her, and thus became\r\nherself beyond the possibility of her sister's reach. Her danger was\r\nimminent; she was sinking. Her father and sister shrieked to Him--who\r\nthey believed heard them and sent his Messenger; for a plash in the\r\nwater, a strong man with wonderful--it seemed superhuman--strength and\r\nspeed, was making his way toward Mary. In one moment more he had grasped\r\nher with one hand. She had still enough presence of mind not to\r\nembarrass him by any struggles, and shouting a word of comfort to Alice,\r\nhe swam to the shore and laid Mary in her father's arms. He then\r\nreturned to the boat, and soon brought it to shore.\r\n\r\nThere are moments of this strange life of ours not to be\r\ndescribed--feelings for which language is no organ. While such a moment\r\nsped with father and daughters, their deliverer stood apart. The father\r\ngazed upon his darling child, satisfying himself that 'not a hair' had\r\nperished, but she was only 'fresher than before;' and, as he afterward\r\nsaid, 'fully recovering his wits,' he turned to thank the preserver of\r\nhis children. He was standing half-concealed behind a cluster of\r\nevergreens.\r\n\r\n'Come forward, my dear fellow,' he said, 'for God's sake, let me grasp\r\nyour hand!'\r\n\r\nHe did not move.\r\n\r\n'Oh! come,' urged Mr. Sandford, 'never mind your shirt-sleeves--it's no\r\ntime to be particular about trifles.'\r\n\r\nStill he didn't move.\r\n\r\n'Oh! come, dear Carl!' said Mary.\r\n\r\nAnd her lover sprang to her feet!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat immediately followed was not told me. But there was no\r\nafter-coldness or reluctance on the part of the good father. His heart\r\nwas melted and fused in affection and gratitude for his daughter's\r\nlover. His prejudices were vanquished, and he was just as well satisfied\r\nas if they had been overcome by the slower processes of reason and\r\nconviction.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, the old gentleman was not to be outdone in magnanimity.\r\nMary's filial devotion had prepared him to yield his opposition, and he\r\nconfessed that he had, in his own secret counsel with himself,\r\ndetermined to recall Heiner at the end of another year, if he proved\r\nconstant and half as deserving as his foolish girl thought him. But\r\nProspero--as Mary called the Old Man of the Mountain--had seen fit to\r\ntake the business into his own hands, and setting his magic to work, had\r\nstirred up a tempest in his Punch-Bowl, just to bring these young\r\nromancers together. But by what spell had he conjured up the lover, just\r\nat the critical moment?\r\n\r\nHeiner confessed, that not being able to get off in the steamer of the\r\ntwenty-ninth, as he had purposed, he had delayed his embarkation for ten\r\ndays, and the magic of love--really the only magic left in our prosaic\r\nworld--had drawn him to the White Mountains, where he might have the\r\nhappiness (a lover, perhaps, only could appreciate it) of breathing the\r\nsame atmosphere with Mary, and possibly of now and then getting a\r\nglimpse of her. Thus he had stood on the summit of Mount Washington\r\nwhen, by some mysterious magnetism, she was gazing through the glass;\r\nthus he narrowly escaped detection near the Willey Slide; and preceding\r\nher by a few hours on Mount Willard, he was in time at the Echo Lake to\r\nsignalize her, and by a good providence had been present at her hour of\r\nneed on the magic domain of 'The Old Man of the Mountain.'\r\n\r\nIt was flood-tide in the old gentleman's heart. Mary's affairs ripened\r\nrapidly. They seemed to me well typified by one of my Malmaison\r\nrose-buds that I have watched slowly growing through the ungenial\r\nMay-days, drooping under a cold rain, suddenly expand into luxurious\r\nperfection with a half-day's June sunshine. The happy future was already\r\narranged. The thrice-blessed October sun was to shine upon the bridal\r\nfestival, and then Mary was to go with her husband, and accompanied by\r\nher father, to pass a year in Europe. 'Mary and I are already wedded,'\r\nsaid he to me, with a smile of complete satisfaction; 'we only take this\r\nyoung fellow into the partnership.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a bright day in the outer and inner world when we separated. And\r\nthus ended our October visit to the White Hills of New-Hampshire, but\r\nnot our gratitude to Him who had held us\r\n\r\n  'In his large love and boundless thought.'\r\n\r\nIf our young friend has imperfectly sketched the beauties of the\r\nmountains, she has exaggerated nothing. We hope our readers--though,\r\nalas! perchance over-wearied now--may make the complete tour of these\r\nWhite Hills, including, as it should, the enchanting sail on Lake\r\nWinnipiseogee, the beautiful drive by North-Conway, and the ascents of\r\nKiarsarge, Chicoma, Mount Moriah, and the Red Mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST TOAST.\r\n\r\n\r\n  'Quick! fill up our glasses, comrade true!\r\n  I hear the reveille,' he fainting said;\r\n  'O brave MCCLELLAN! I drink to _you!_'\r\n  His glass lay broken--the soldier was dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY-TWO.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Alone at her window a maiden sat,\r\n    And toward the South looked she,\r\n  Over the field, over the flood,\r\n    Over the restless sea.\r\n  My Love, she said, he wanders far,\r\n    He may not come to me.\r\n       To and fro, to and fro,\r\n       Sweeps the tide in ebb and flow:\r\n       You and I, ah! well we know\r\n       How hope and fear may come and go.\r\n\r\n  With folded hands the maiden sat;\r\n    Her work beside her lay;\r\n  She saw the dusty, lengthening miles,\r\n    A weary, weary way,\r\n  Dullest links of a leaden chain,\r\n    Unfolding, day on day.\r\n       To and fro, to and fro,\r\n       Breaking waves in restless flow:\r\n       You and I, ah! well we know\r\n       How hope and fear may come and go.\r\n\r\n  My Love, she said, he wanders far\r\n    Over the Southern sea;\r\n  Nor Paris gay, nor ancient Rome,\r\n    Could keep my love from me.\r\n  The good ship drives through the misty night\r\n    With the black rocks under the lea.\r\n       To and fro, to and fro,\r\n       Winter storms may come and go:\r\n       You and I, ah! well we know\r\n       Hope of good and fear of woe.\r\n\r\n  I would, she said, I were by his side,\r\n    Fighting on sea and land;\r\n  Harder by far the folded hands,\r\n    Than in battle light to stand--\r\n  Stand with the faithful knights of God,\r\n    Afar on the Southern sand.\r\n       To and fro, to and fro,\r\n       Spring may come, but spring must go:\r\n       You and I, ah! well we know\r\n       Change is stamped on all below.\r\n\r\n  My Love, she said, is every man\r\n    Who girds him for the fight,\r\n  By fortressed coast or Western wood,\r\n    To battle for the Right.\r\n  Be still, my heart, the end is sure;\r\n    From darkness cometh light.\r\n       To and fro, to and fro,\r\n       The watchful sentries come and go:\r\n       You and I, ah! well we know\r\n       Rifle-shot of unseen foe.\r\n\r\n  I glory with my Love, she said,\r\n    My heart beats quick and high\r\n  When captured fort or well-fought field\r\n    Echoes the victor cry\r\n  Of those who know 'like men to live,\r\n    Or hero-like to die.'\r\n       To and fro, to and fro,\r\n       Summer's smiles and winter's snow:\r\n       You and I, ah! well we know\r\n       Faith may fail and doubt may grow.\r\n\r\n  I mourn my Love with bitter tears,\r\n    Lying on many a plain;\r\n  Above him sighs the winter wind\r\n    And weeps the summer rain--\r\n  The nation's holy ground, where low\r\n    Her martyr sons are lain.\r\n       To and fro, to and fro,\r\n       Man must reap as well as sow:\r\n       You and I, ah! well we know\r\n       Grain shall to the ripening grow.\r\n\r\n  Though long miles lie between, I stand\r\n    Beside my Love, she said;\r\n  No couch of roses, wet with dew,\r\n    The wounded soldier's bed,\r\n  When fever-flushes, crown of thorns,\r\n    Rest on the martyr's head.\r\n       Soft and low, soft and low,\r\n       Woman's footsteps come and go:\r\n       You and I, ah! well we know\r\n       Woman's love and woman's woe.\r\n\r\n  With folded hands the maiden sat,\r\n    And toward the South looked she,\r\n  Over the field, over the flood,\r\n    Over the restless sea.\r\n  And I shall go to my love, she said,\r\n    Though he may not come to me.\r\n       To and fro, to and fro,\r\n       Sweeps the tide in ebb and flow:\r\n       You and I, ah! well we know\r\n       Death brings peace to all below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWER-ARRANGING.\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to speak of the art of arranging flowers. Of the _art_, I say,\r\nfor it _is_ one. Do any of my readers comprehend the fact? They\r\ncertainly would, had they dawdled away hours more than grave moralists\r\nwould approve, fussing with me over the darlings of garden and\r\ngreenhouse.\r\n\r\nDon't come to the conclusion now, that I am in the habit of making up\r\nthose small, round, or flat, stiff bouquets to be obtained for a\r\ncompensation (not slight) from market-gardeners and the like. I\r\nrepudiate the artificialities! Who wants camellias tied on false stems?\r\nWho would be thankful for such a mosaic of 'nature's gems'? _Mosaic_,\r\nthat's the word exactly for such French bouquets. And _gems_, in truth,\r\nfar too stony in their setting for blithe springing blossoms! I'll have\r\nnothing to do with such abominations.\r\n\r\nNo; _I_ mean by the 'art of flower-arranging' that process by which the\r\nvarious characteristics of flowers are brought out and combined\r\naccording to artistic rules. Does this sound metaphysical\r\nor--æsthet-i-cal? Why is the effect produced by the 'bunch of posies'\r\nstuck clumsily into a broken-nosed pitcher on the kitchen window-sill,\r\ndifferent from that of the same carefully disposed in an elegant\r\nreceptacle on the drawing-room table? The nosegay is bright and fragrant\r\nin either place. Why then do not the plebeian and patrician bouquets\r\nequally please? In the one case, you say, the charms are inharmoniously\r\ndispersed, and nearly neutralized by meaner surroundings, while in the\r\nother they are enhanced by every advantage of position and appropriate\r\naccessories. Should you not be grateful, then, for the working of my\r\ntheory of development and manifestation? Would you now like to\r\nunderstand a little its operation?\r\n\r\nWelcome, then, to whatever benefit can be derived from my limited\r\nexperience. I am a humble student in floral _architecture_, and I offer\r\nmy few suggestions to fellow-pupils, to those who aim unsuccessfully at\r\nhome adornment, whose utmost skill often only attains sublime\r\n_failures_--not to the geniuses in the art.\r\n\r\nFrankly, submissively I acknowledge there are persons who, guided only\r\nby native taste and sense of harmony, accomplish beautiful results\r\nwithout hesitation or thought. Their flowers obey the slightest touch\r\nwith nice subservience, falling into their most exquisite combinations\r\nof color and form.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to dictate to those thus gifted, but some of the\r\nunfortunates destitute of the divine intuition may be aided by the plain\r\ndirections following. I may venture to hope that the judicious\r\napplication of them will prevent the appearance of, perhaps, _several_\r\nugly bouquets in the world.\r\n\r\nMy first maxim has reference to vases. They should, for the most part,\r\nbe simple in design and uniform in tint. Avoid 'fishy' mouths, too wide\r\nfor their (the vases') hight. Never put Lilliputian flowers, in no\r\nmatter how large a quantity, into Brobdignagian vessels. In other\r\nrespects, endeavor to adapt your boxes to the character of your flowers.\r\nFor dahlias, flat dishes will be found very convenient, spread with\r\nbroad, green leaves.\r\n\r\nSecondly. Do not put flowers of different shades of the same color side\r\nby side, any more than you would wear hues as discordant together on\r\nyour person.\r\n\r\nThirdly. Be very careful with the foliage employed. Too much hides the\r\nflowers; too little does not relieve them. Drooping green vines, etc.,\r\nare always available.\r\n\r\nLast, but by no means least, _mass_ your colors. This rule is now often\r\nadopted on a larger scale in laying out flower-beds, and it is very\r\nimportant. It gives concentration and force to bouquets, and\r\neffectually prevents their not uncommon patchwork appearance.\r\n\r\nIf these _dicta_ seem to any one ridiculously self-evident, he may take\r\nit for granted he is one of the geniuses, for whose service they are not\r\npromulgated. For their efficacy, behold some bouquets.\r\n\r\nA small, plain Parian pitcher, bearing sprays of orange-leaves and\r\nblossoms, one full-blown, deep red camellia, solid, heavy, looking as if\r\ncarved from coral-stained ivory, many pendent abutilus, and some\r\ngraceful vine curled negligently round the handle. How like you _le tout\r\nensemble_!\r\n\r\nLook again: A small vase, light buff in color, holding roses--red and\r\nwhite--relieved by pansies, of intermingled purple and golden dyes, and\r\nby sprigs of the lemon verbena, of dainty heaths, mignonette,\r\nheliotrope, and geranium-leaves.\r\n\r\nSee this, also: A ground-glass vase, containing a perfect white\r\ncamellia, the daphneodora, and fuchsias, crimson and white.\r\n\r\nAnd this: A slender, tall vase of the ruby Bohemian glass, with\r\nvarieties of the colceolaria, their tiny purses specked with brown, from\r\nlight tan to velvety maroon.\r\n\r\nThese, it will be seen, are all medium-sized bouquets. Larger ones,\r\nrequiring more material, are not so easy to describe. Some summer\r\nflowers found in every garden--the double stocks (gilli-flowers) blend\r\ntheir varied shades finely with the glittering coreopsis, the sombre\r\nmourning-bride, and the violet cerulean Canterbury bells.\r\n\r\nIn winter, with ample resources, one can produce masterpieces. What\r\nthink you of callas--their frozen calm kindled by the ruddy flush of\r\nazaleas, and their superb stateliness opposed by the flexile vivacity of\r\nthe feathery willow acacia? The same white lilies, or their deliciously\r\nsweet July representatives, are contrasted well with scarlet geranium,\r\nvivid and glowing, or with the flames of the cactus, and toned down by\r\nthe bluish lavender of the wistaria. This makes a bouquet eminently\r\nsuited for church--its colors forming Ruskin's sacred chord, and\r\ntypifying the union of purity, love, and faith.\r\n\r\nFlowers on the altar are most appropriate and significant, but strict\r\nattention should be paid to their symbolism. For the communion-table\r\nthere are lilies of the valley, and in its season, the rosy snow of the\r\nblooming fruit-trees. Nor must the passion-flower be forgotten--and\r\nagainst its mystic darkness set the china pink clusters of the oleander.\r\nIf they are not procurable, substitute great half-opened rose-buds,\r\ndeepest pink and cream-color, and add the broken stars of the\r\nstephanotis. This last, twined among the glossiest and darkest leaves of\r\nthe rhododendron, forms a fitting crown for the gray hairs of the dead,\r\npassing away in fullness of years and of honors.\r\n\r\nChrysanthemums brought by November, and half-faded, as it were, in the\r\nwaning light, are most meet offerings for the departing year to lay at\r\nthe holy shrine.\r\n\r\nThus much for _spiritual_ flowers. Others there are in contrast,\r\n_material_ merely, hearty, substantial, and robust. I take singularly to\r\nall such, calumniated as _vulgar_. And why not keep a corner in our\r\nsouls for the common and every-day, as for the elegant and rare?\r\n\r\nThere is a noon of sharp, bustling matter-of-fact, as well as a morn of\r\nhigh, noble aspiration, and an eve of hushed and solemn reverie. It is\r\nin the noon, too, that our active life takes place; why not enjoy\r\nourselves then, as only it is possible? So why not allow certain lower\r\nfaculties of our nature to delight in what are called the grosser\r\nflowers? Why not cultivate their acquaintance, as we would that of\r\nmotherly, kind, portly, and phlegmatic old ladies, rustling in their\r\nsilks and satins, with a comfortable complacency, satisfied with their\r\nown share of fortune's goods, and benevolently disposed toward their\r\nless favored neighbors?\r\n\r\nTo be sure much can not be said of the _artistic_ capabilities of some\r\nof these cronies. One does not care to transfer marigolds, poppies,\r\nlilacs, phlox, cockscomb, and cabbage-roses from their own garden-homes\r\nto the more elevated sphere of domestic life. But snow-balls,\r\n'flaunting' petunias, double hollyhocks, China asters, and tulips, they\r\ncertainly are available. By the way, what business have the juvenile\r\nstory-books to stigmatize tulips as vain and proud? The splendid things\r\nhave a right to be conscious of their glorious clothing. Who gave it\r\nthem? And dahlias, what purples, crimsons, and oranges they boast!\r\nFormal they may be, but, at least in Yankee parlance, _handsome_, and\r\nwhen arranged with woodbine-leaves October's earliest frosts have\r\npainted, can there be a finer expression of the season of autumn?\r\n\r\nIn this connection one remembers Miss Mitford and her charming history\r\nof the loss of her yellow pride--the Apollo among dahlias. Lovable Miss\r\nMitford! how pleasant would have been a flower-talk with her!\r\n\r\nNow, having owned to so many shockingly low tastes, no one would, I\r\npresume, be surprised to hear me avow a _penchant_ for sun-flowers and\r\npeonies, dear old-fashioned creatures that they are! Shall I plead in\r\nexcuse for my weakness for the coarsest of the flowers yet another\r\nreason? They form to me, in their extent of surface and fullness of\r\ncolor, the nearest approach our chilly New-England can make to the blaze\r\nand vitality of the Southern flora. And I so long for the luxuriant\r\nvegetation of the tropics, the gorgeous magnificence I have never\r\nseen--even the magnolia has only been disclosed to my dreams.\r\n\r\nI would not disparage delicate and fragile flowerets, though I am so\r\ninfatuated by their brilliant sisters. They are lovely to examine, and,\r\nas individuals, very precious, but in my opinion useless for decorative\r\npurposes. In a body they confuse one another, and you can not _mass_\r\ntheir colors.\r\n\r\nThis remark is also very applicable to wild flowers, which, moreover, be\r\nthey large or small, possess additional disqualifications for proper\r\narrangement. They are not at ease in cultivated atmospheres. Violets and\r\nanemones--their sacredness, innocence, and peace--require the soothing\r\nairs of woodland solitudes. Drawn from secret nooks and haunts into the\r\ngarish day, they droop and pine, they cry forlornly: 'We are weary, we\r\nare dying; take us home to rest again!' There is the blood-red\r\ncardinal-flower. Bold enough surely, you say. Wade, stretch, and leap,\r\nand seize at last in triumph the coveted prize. A new difficulty! The\r\nspikes are so rough, jagged, and stiff, there is no welding of them\r\ntogether. You wish them back in their burning bush. The fringed blue\r\ngentian, too, has very troublesome appendages. It is prettiest in its\r\npasture-built place, opening to the welcome breezes its azure petals.\r\nBesides, there is where Bryant wishes it to remain, and certainly _his_\r\ndesire should have some weight with us.\r\n\r\nSome mortifications, therefore, it has been seen, attend on the pursuit\r\nof the art of flower-arranging. These are but the beginning of sorrows,\r\nnevertheless. Many others might be mentioned, vexations consequent on\r\nthe constitution of the subjects themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy fact that life and beauty can not be preserved in\r\nthem without water. On grand, temporary occasions it may answer for the\r\nartist to disregard this natural law, but it would be an excess of\r\nbarbarity to do thus often. There ought to be no more martyrs for the\r\nsake of _effect_ than can be helped.\r\n\r\nBut now ensues the tug of war. How make stems of all lengths stand in\r\nthe most desirable position and yet all touch the water? Sometimes a\r\nshorter one _must_ stand above a longer one, when it is impossible to\r\nbathe its feet in the refreshing liquid. _Sink_ the longer then; _cut_\r\nit off. Each experiment will bring annoyance, as the tyro may find as he\r\nplods on in his task. Short-stemmed flowers make '_chunky_' bouquets,\r\nevery one knows. Another trouble is occasioned by the froward behavior\r\nof flowers. Never a woman among the sex could be at times so fickle and\r\nperverse. I am not prepared to maintain the theory of a higher nature in\r\nplants than the merely physical. It is enough for me to cling to an\r\nenormous heresy with respect to _animals_. Against the fiat of\r\nChristendom I will persist in granting them the semblance of a soul. I\r\n_will_ swallow the old creed about flowers. Still, wherever they get\r\nthem, they do exhibit tantalizing qualities. _Perverse?_ That verbena\r\nknows perfectly where she ought to go, where, in the goodness of your\r\nheart, you are striving to place her, but how obstinately she resists,\r\nslipping finally, in utter rebellion, from your fingers. _Fickle?_ How\r\ndocile was the same verbena yesterday. Nay, it was of her own accord she\r\nassumed the pretty position you want to see again. You did not think or\r\ncare about it then.\r\n\r\nWith all one's minor trials, who would regret time spent in such\r\ndelightful labors? I have tasted so many pleasures in my devotion\r\nhitherto, that perhaps I should be content. Yet to look upon grand\r\nfloral decorations; to behold wreath-encircled pillar and arch in lordly\r\nhalls, and baskets piled and pyramids raised from the wealth of\r\nfairy-land conservatories!--on spectacles like these I hope to feast my\r\nsenses some future day.\r\n\r\nSome one may ask: 'You who enjoy so fully flowers, who hang over them in\r\nsuch transport when gathered, have you no interest in their cultivation?\r\nno care to watch their growth? no love for gardening, in short?' No! I\r\nreply; very little. I am satisfied to take the results of others'\r\nexertions. I have no wish to plod i' the mold,' not the slightest\r\nobjection to others doing that business for me. I am too indolent to\r\nlike out-door work very well; much too fond of late rising to enjoy\r\nweeding, digging, etc., in the early morning air. I think likely I ought\r\nto feel differently, but I don't. Suffer me to inquire _why_ people\r\ninsist on peeping behind the scenes of nature's stage, when she seems to\r\ntake such pains to conceal her '_modus operandi_'? Let me not be too\r\nsweeping, however. There is one kind of floriculture I could fancy.\r\nPlants reared in winter in the house, snatched from the biting cold,\r\nmust be so caressingly tended! Vines, too, how precious they\r\nbecome--every tiny tendril regarded with such tenderness, and as the\r\nclinging branches wind in light festoons round parent shell or basket,\r\nso do they grasp the cords of the affections and twine exultingly around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHyacinths also are pleasant to sight and smell in warm, cheerful rooms\r\nwhen fast without fall drifting snows. It is the happiness of education,\r\nof association, of possession, that such plants afford. They are\r\nendeared inversely to their number, it may be--the solitary shrub being\r\nas the one ewe lamb. This joy in flowers differing thus materially from\r\nmy pleasure in their artistic elements.\r\n\r\nAh! when shall I stop? The civil public will be wearied out ere long,\r\nand so much has been left unsaid on my inexhaustible theme! When was a\r\nlover ever known to tire--_himself_? A lover! Here conscience has a word\r\nof reproach, '_Thou_ a _lover_, so unjust in thy self-conceit? Bringing\r\ndown thy goddesses to be in truth very _idols_, the work of thy own\r\nhands--prating presumptuously of thy power over their immortal glories!'\r\n\r\nVerily, I am to blame, but how repair the error?\r\n\r\nCan eloquence be mine to fitly tell of the mighty influence of the\r\nflowers? Shall I say that, without their 'laughing light,' this world\r\nwould be a dreary, lonesome place? It is a trite and tedious\r\nexclamation--an axiom past disputing.\r\n\r\nShall I join in the grateful song resounding over every land; in homage\r\nto the blessing-laden blossoms? Lips long used to wailing swell that\r\nchorus loudest, for it was the sunshine caught in buttercup or dandelion\r\nthat turned so many darkened faces in sudden smiles to heaven. Ah! they\r\nare the forms wasted and bowed down by anguish, that stoop most meekly,\r\nthankfully, only to lie where the daisies can grow over them.\r\n\r\nShall I strive to spell the lesson written by the green earth's flowery\r\ntracery?\r\n\r\nLong, long ago One read that lore in love, and the lilies of the field\r\nbut give it back to us to-day.\r\n\r\nHere pondering, one thought of awe, yet rapture, thrills through my\r\nsoul. If to our poor humanity such honeyed drops of healing do earth's\r\nfrailest flower-cups yield, how cool, how crystal-clear the nectar from\r\namaranth and asphodel distilled for those\r\n\r\n  'Who walk in soft white light, with kings and priests abroad;\r\n  Who summer high in bliss upon the hills of God!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN HATE OF THE NORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fact which stands broadly out on the page of our current history is\r\nthe intense and peculiar hatred wherewith the people of the North are\r\ngenerally regarded by those engaged in the Southern rebellion. That _it\r\nis_ a fact, is established by the concurrent testimony of the whole\r\ninsurgent press and of our soldiers returned from Southern captivity,\r\nand nearly all those, whether in civil or military life, who have\r\nvisited the States deeply infected with the virus of Secession. Probably\r\nnever before were prisoners of war in a civilized country subjected to\r\nso much obloquy and vituperation from women and children as our captured\r\nvolunteers in the South during the past year. Hate of the abhorred\r\n'Yankees,' scorn and the loathing of 'Lincoln's hirelings,' detestation\r\nof the mean, sordid, groveling, mercenary spirit of the Northern masses,\r\nhave been the burden of Southern oratory and journalism for the last\r\neighteen months. No devilish hate expressed in Milton's magnificent epic\r\nsurpasses in intensity, however it may in dignity and genuine force,\r\nthat which is breathed through every oracle of Southern popular\r\nsentiment. And this is insisted on by Southern letter-writers and\r\njournalists as demonstrating the impossibility of 'reconstruction.' 'How\r\ncan those who hate each other so implacably ever again be one people?\r\nWhat use in seeking to restore a Union which hereafter can, at best, be\r\nbut the result of overwhelming force on the one side, and utter\r\nsubjugation on the other?'\r\n\r\nBut the assumption of _mutual_ hate between the Northern and the\r\nSouthern masses is utterly groundless. Nothing in the attitude, the\r\nbearing, the utterances, of the loyal millions affords it any\r\njustification or countenance. So far are they from cherishing any such\r\naversion to the Southern people, that they can with difficulty, and but\r\ninadequately, comprehend the malignity wherewith they are regarded by\r\nthe revolters, without feeling the smallest desire to reciprocate it.\r\nThat the Rebellion itself should be regarded with general reprobation\r\nthroughout the Free States was inevitable, for, in the first place, it\r\ninvolves a most flagitious breach of faith. Republican liberty rests on\r\nan implied but essential compact that the result of a fair election\r\nshall be conclusive. If those who lose an election are thereupon to rush\r\nto arms for a reversal of the decision of the ballot-box, then elections\r\nare a stupid sham, whereon no earnest person will waste his breath or\r\nhis suffrage. Why should any one devote his time and effort to secure a\r\npolitical result which those overborne by it will set at defiance the\r\nnext hour? It is not merely Jefferson or Adams, Jackson or Lincoln, who\r\nis defied by a revolt like that now raging in this country; it is the\r\nprinciple of Popular Elections--it is the right of a constitutional\r\nmajority to govern. Concede that the Southern States were justifiable in\r\nseceding from the Union because Lincoln (with their connivance) was\r\nchosen President, and it were absurd ever to hold another Presidential\r\nElection, or ask any man to vote hereafter. The North certainly feels\r\nthat the principle of government by constitutions and majorities is\r\nassailed by this rebellion, and that to concede its rightfulness is to\r\ndisplace the very corner-stone of republican liberty.\r\n\r\nThe North feels also that commercial dishonesty was potent among the\r\ninfluences which fomented this rebellion. Bankruptcy almost\r\nuniversal--planters immersed in debt for lands, for negroes, for food,\r\nfor fabrics--merchants overhead in debt to the importers and jobbers of\r\nthe Northern sea-ports--every one owing more or less, and few able or\r\nwilling to pay: such was the general pecuniary condition of the South at\r\nthe outset of this subversion. It is no libel on the South to say that\r\nrelief from the pressure of over-due obligations was primarily sought by\r\nan immense number, in plunging into the abyss of revolution. And a great\r\nproportion of the Southern merchants, with full intent to defraud their\r\ncreditors, by lighting the flames of civil war, in 1860 swelled their\r\nindebtedness to their Northern friends to the utmost. This was low\r\nknavery seeking protection behind the black mantle of treason. If the\r\nfacts could be fully laid bare, it would be found that disinclination to\r\npay their honest debts has transformed vast numbers from Unionists into\r\ntraitors. The North can never respect those who seek to slay their\r\ncreditors, that they may evade their moral as well as legal obligation\r\nto pay them.\r\n\r\nNor can the loyal millions respect those who, in setting forth the\r\ngrounds of their rebellion, and essaying to justify themselves in the\r\neyes of the civilized world, do not hesitate to deny the most palpable\r\ntruths. The rebel who rests on the inherent or reserved right of each\r\nState to secede from the Union at her sovereign pleasure, is a bad\r\nlogician, and unsound in his constitutional theories; but he is not\r\nnecessarily a knave. But the rebel apologist who says to Europe, 'This\r\nrevolt was not impelled by Slavery, but by hostility to the policy of\r\nProtection, Internal Improvements, etc., which the North had power in\r\nthe Union to fasten upon us in defiance of our utmost opposition,' he\r\nshows himself a dissembler and a liar. There was no tariff when the\r\nCotton States seceded--there had been none for many years--which those\r\nStates had not heartily aided to enact. For not more than ten years of\r\nthe eighty-odd of our existence as a nation, has there been a tariff in\r\noperation that South-Carolina did not help enact and sustain. The\r\ntariffs which are now trumped up as an excuse for Secession, not only\r\nhad no existence when that Secession was inaugurated, but could have had\r\nnone had the Cotton States remained faithful to their constitutional\r\nobligations. When, therefore, such men as Lieutenant Maury assure Europe\r\nthat Slavery did not incite the Southern Rebellion--that it had but a\r\nremote and subordinate relation to that outbreak--they betray their own\r\nrecklessness of truth, and their knowledge that their case is one which\r\ncan not abide the scrutiny and the dispassionate judgment of\r\nChristendom.\r\n\r\nBut the Southern Whites hate us vehemently. That is unfortunately true\r\nof what would seem to be a large majority of them. Misled by artful\r\ndemagogues--excited by charges of Northern rapacity, perfidy, outrage,\r\nand venom, to which no contradiction in their hearing is permitted--the\r\nPoor Whites of the South really believe that the North is waging against\r\nthem an unprovoked and fiendish, war of subjugation and rapine. Of\r\ncourse, they abhor us, and invoke all manner of curses on our heads. But\r\ntheir hatred rests upon and is impelled by egregious falsehoods, and\r\nwill vanish when those falsehoods shall have been exposed and their\r\ninfluence dissipated. The Whisky Rebels of Western Pennsylvania\r\nintensely hated the rule of George Washington; but their rebellion being\r\ncrushed, all trace of the bitterness it engendered soon faded away.\r\n\r\nAs to the aristocracy of the South, it understands the case far better,\r\nthough individuals among its members are misled. The majority are\r\nfighting for the extension and perpetuation of that Heaven-defying\r\nsystem which is at once the idol and the bane of the South--for that\r\n'peculiar institution' which makes one half the community helpless\r\nvictims to the pride, indolence, avarice, and lust of the other half.\r\nThe aristocracy are fighting for Slavery--neither less nor more--and\r\nthey fight bravely, desperately. Their existence as a privileged order\r\nhas been recklessly staked on the issue of the contest, and they mean to\r\ntriumph at any cost. To suppose that they can be vanquished yet leave\r\ntheir bloody idol intact--that they can be compelled to reënter 'the\r\nUnion as it was,' and send their Slidells, Hammonds, Howell Cobbs, and\r\nMasons, back to a Union Congress--is one of the wildest dreams that ever\r\nflitted through a sane mind. Reunion or Disunion is possible; a\r\nrestoration of 'the Union as it was,' is as impracticable as a return of\r\nthe Eleventh Century or a replacement of the New World in the condition\r\nwherein Columbus found it.\r\n\r\nThe Southern aristocracy must triumph or cease as an aristocracy to\r\nexist. A flogged slaveholder is an anomaly that can not endure; he can\r\nnot rule his chattels if they know that he has succumbed to a force that\r\nhe would gladly have defied but could no longer resist. 'Poor White\r\ntrash' may endure and repay the contempt of their servile neighbors, but\r\na man-owning aristocracy that has fought and been vanquished, can no\r\nlonger command the respect or the obedience of its chattels.\r\n\r\nThe issue of our present struggle must be Disunion or Emancipation. And,\r\nassuming it to be Emancipation, the hate wherewith the North is regarded\r\nat the South would soon die out. New social and industrial relations and\r\ninterests, new activities, new ambitions, would speedily efface all\r\npainful recollections of our desperate struggle. The late slaveholders,\r\nhaving ceased to be such, would no longer be controlled by the impulses\r\nnor plastic to the influences which impelled them to rush upon the thick\r\nbosses of the Union. They would find in the rapid peopling of their\r\nsection by immigration from the North and from Europe, and the\r\nconsequent increase in current value of the lands, timber, mines,\r\nwater-power, etc., of their Section, new avenues to wealth, new\r\nincitements to activity and energy. Shays' rebellion engulfed the\r\ngreater part of Western Massachusetts; but ten years passed, and it had\r\nsunk into a mere tradition. La Vendée was more unanimous and more\r\nintense in its hostility to the French Republic than any Southern State\r\nnow is to a restoration of the Union; yet La Vendée soon after responded\r\nmeekly to the conscriptions of Napoleon. War alienates and inflames; but\r\nPeace speedily re-links the golden chain of mutual interests, and all is\r\nkindly again.\r\n\r\nLet Slavery disappear, and all incitement to alienation or bitterness\r\nbetween the North and the South will have vanished. God has made them\r\nfor parts of the same country; their diverse topographies, climates,\r\nproductions, render them the natural complement of each other. The\r\nCotton, Sugar, Tobacco, etc., of the South will be freely exchanged, as\r\nof yore, for the Manufactures, Machinery, and Implements of the North:\r\nthe former gradually learning to supply her own essential wants to an\r\nextent hitherto unknown; but the rapid increase of her population,\r\nindustry, and wealth, will render her a wider and steadier market for\r\nthe products of the latter and of Europe than she has ever yet been. The\r\nSouth will soon realize that the death of Slavery has awakened her to a\r\nnew and nobler life--that what she at first regarded as a great calamity\r\nand a downfall, was in truth her beneficent renovation and her chief\r\nblessing. So shall North and South, at length comprehending and\r\nappreciating each other, walk hand in hand along their common pathway to\r\nan exalted and benignant destiny, admonished to mutual forbearance and\r\ndeference by mournful yet proud recollections of their great struggle,\r\nand realizing in their newly established and truly fraternal concord the\r\nopening of a long, bright vista of reciprocal kindness and inviolable\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MERCHANT'S STORY.\r\n\r\n  'All of which I saw, and part of which I was.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nIt was five years after the events recorded in the previous chapter,\r\nwhen, one day late in October, I started on my annual tour among the\r\nSouthern correspondents of the mercantile-house of which I was then a\r\nmember. Arriving at Richmond shortly after noon, I took a hasty meal at\r\nthe wretched restaurant near the railway-station, and, with a segar in\r\nmy mouth, seated myself on a trunk in the baggage-car, to proceed on my\r\njourney. As the train moved off from the depot, a hand was placed on my\r\narm, and a familiar voice said:\r\n\r\n'Lord bless me! Kirke, is this you?'\r\n\r\nLooking up, I saw Mr. Robert Preston--or, as he was known among his\r\nacquaintance, 'Squire Preston of Jones'--a gentleman whose Northern\r\nbusiness I had transacted for several years. He had been on a visit to\r\nsome Virginia relatives, and was returning to his plantation on the\r\nTrent, about twenty miles from Newbern. Though I had never been at his\r\nhome, he had often visited mine, and we were well--in fact, intimately\r\nacquainted. I soon explained that I was on the way to New-Orleans, and\r\nmentioned that I might, on my return, find the route to his plantation.\r\nHe urged me to visit it at once, and I finally consented to do so. We\r\nrode on by the cars as far as Goldsboro, and there, after a few hours'\r\nrest, and a light breakfast of corn-cake, hominy, and bacon, took seats\r\non the stage, which then was the only public conveyance to Newbern.\r\n\r\nPreston was an intelligent, cultivated gentleman, and, at that time,\r\nappeared to be about thirty-three years of age. He was tall, athletic,\r\nand of decidedly prepossessing appearance; and, though somewhat careless\r\nin his dress, had a simple dignity about him that is not furnished by\r\nthe tailor. The firm lines about his mouth, his strong jaw, wide\r\nnostrils, and large nose--straight as if cut after a bevel--indicated a\r\nresolute, determined character; but his large, dreamy eyes--placed far\r\napart, as if to give fit proportion to his broad, overhanging\r\nbrows--showed that his nature was as gentle and tender as a woman's. He\r\nspoke with the broad Southern accent, and his utterance was usually slow\r\nand hesitating, and his manner quiet and deliberate; but I had seen him\r\nwhen his words came like a torrent of hot lava, when his eyes flashed\r\nfire, his thin nostrils opened and shut, and his whole frame seemed\r\ninfused with the power and the energy of the steam-engine.\r\n\r\nEducated for the ministry, in early life he had been a popular preacher\r\nin the Baptist denomination, but at the date of which I am writing, he\r\nwas devoting himself to the care of his plantation, and preached only\r\nnow and then, when away from home, or when the little church at Trenton\r\nwas without a pastor. Altogether he was a man to be remarked upon, A\r\nstranger casually meeting him, would turn back, and involuntarily ask:\r\n'Who is he?'\r\n\r\nOnly five of the nine seats inside the stage were occupied, but as the\r\nday, though cold, was clear and pleasant, we mounted the box, and took\r\nthe vacant places beside the driver. That worthy was a rough, surly\r\ncharacter, with a talent for profanity truly wonderful. His horses were\r\nlean, half-starved quadrupeds, with ribs protruding from their sides\r\nlike hoops from a whisky-barrel, and he accounted for their condition,\r\nand for the scarcity of fences on the highroad, by saying that the\r\nstage-owners fed them on rails; but I suspected that the constant curses\r\nhe discharged at them had worried the flesh off their bones, and induced\r\nthe fences to move to a more godly latitude.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the coach, coiled away on a pile of horse-blankets, was a\r\nwoman whose skin and dress designated her as one of the species of\r\n'white trash' known in North-Carolina as 'clay-eaters.' She was about\r\nthirty years of age, and if her face had been bleached, and her teeth\r\nintroduced to a scrubbing-brush, might have passed for being tolerably\r\ngood-looking. After a number of preliminary cracks of the whip, and\r\nsundry oaths and loud shouts administered to the 'leaders,' the driver\r\ngot under way, and we were soon jolting--at a speed of about four miles\r\nan hour--over the 'slews' and ruts made by the recent rains. Shortly\r\nafter we started the woman said to me:\r\n\r\n'I say, stranger, ye han't no 'backer 'bout ye, hev ye?'\r\n\r\nI was about to say I had none, when Preston handed her a paper of\r\n'Richmond Sweet.' Without pausing to thank him, she coolly stuffed\r\nnearly a half of it into her mouth. My companion did not seem at all\r\nsurprised, but I remarked:\r\n\r\n'You do not _smoke_, then, madam?'\r\n\r\n'Oh! yas, I smokes; but I durned sight d'ruther chaw.'\r\n\r\n'Let me give you a segar,' I said, taking one from my pocket, and slyly\r\nwinking at Preston.\r\n\r\n'I never smokes them sort o' things; I takes nat'rally ter pipes--did\r\nwhen I'se a gal,' she replied, ejecting a mouthful of saliva of the same\r\ncolor as her skin.\r\n\r\n'This gentleman,' said the Squire, smiling, 'isn't fully up to our ways.\r\nHe thinks it queer that women chew tobacco.'\r\n\r\n'Quar thet wimmin chaws! Han't the' as much right ter as ye? _I_ reckon\r\nwhat's good fur th' gander'll do fur th' goose!\r\n\r\n'Good logic, that,' said Preston, laughing heartily.\r\n\r\nThe woman kept on expectorating for a time, when she again spoke to my\r\ncompanion:\r\n\r\n'I say! ye b'long ter Newbern, doan't ye?'\r\n\r\n'No, not now; but I live near there.'\r\n\r\n'Ye doan't know a feller down thar called Mulock, I doan't s'pose--Bony\r\nMulock?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I do; I know him well.'\r\n\r\n'So do I. I'm gwine ter see 'im.'\r\n\r\n'Where were you acquainted?'\r\n\r\n'Up ter Harnett--I b'long thar--nigh on ter Chalk Level. He war raised\r\nthar.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I know; but he left there long ago.'\r\n\r\n'Nigh on ter nine year. I'm his wife.'\r\n\r\n'You his wife!' exclaimed the Squire, turning round and looking at her.\r\n\r\n'Yas. He put eöut nine year ago, and I han't heerd nor seed nary a thing\r\non him sence, till a spell back. But I'll stick ter him this time, like\r\na possum ter a rail. He woan't put eöut no more, ye kin bet high on\r\nthet!'\r\n\r\n'But he has another wife now!'\r\n\r\n'Wall, I thort he moight hev--but she'll lean, raather sudden, I reckon.\r\nWhat is she--white or nigger?'\r\n\r\n'She's a likely quadroon girl. She has almost made a man of him.'\r\n\r\n'Hi Lordy! then she's right smart. I'm gol-durned ef _I_ could!'\r\n\r\n'If you have so poor an opinion of him, why do you follow him?'\r\n\r\n'Wall, I goes for a 'ooman's hevin' har own. When he put eöut I swore\r\nter gol I'd foller 'im as soon as I got on his trail, ef I hed ter go to\r\nh--ll fur it!'\r\n\r\nThe low vulgarity of the woman disgusted me, and it seemed to have the\r\nsame effect on the Squire, for he turned his back on her when she made\r\nthe last remark. Not appearing to notice his manner, she said, after a\r\nmoment:\r\n\r\n'I say, Gin'ral! what 'bout thet stealin' bisness?'\r\n\r\n'Bony was taken up a while back, for buying turpentine of the negroes. I\r\nreckon he's in jail yet.'\r\n\r\n'Yas, I heerd uv thet--thet's how I treed 'im. Cunnel Lamsin--nigh on\r\nter me--he seed it in the paper. I know'd 'im by th' Bonaparty. \"When'll\r\nhe be mauled?'\r\n\r\n'Very soon, I reckon. He was sentenced to fifty lashes a week ago.'\r\n\r\n'It'll do 'im good; I'd given 'im more'n thet. He war allers up ter\r\ndealin' with nigs.'\r\n\r\nThe road, when we started, was in a very bad condition, and as we\r\nproceeded it grew gradually worse, till, in the vicinity of the runs\r\nwhere we then were, it had become almost impassable. We frequently\r\nturned off into the woods and open fields to avoid the worst places, but\r\neven there the jolting of the coach was so violent that I momentarily\r\nexpected our 'lady' passenger would roll off into the mud. Seeing that\r\nshe was in absolute danger, and being also willing to dispense with her\r\nrefined society, I finally said to her:\r\n\r\n'Would you not prefer an inside seat?'\r\n\r\n'Yas, I would; but I han't th' money fur't. The' axed so like durnation\r\nfur totein' me in thar, I couldn't stan' it, no how.'\r\n\r\n'What fare did she pay, driver?' I asked of the Jehu.\r\n\r\n'Half-price.'\r\n\r\n'That's enough for seventy miles over a road like this. Let her get\r\ninside.'\r\n\r\n'Karn't, stranger, 'tan't 'lowed, (d'rot yer dirty hide--you,\r\nJake--g'up!) the old man would raise 'tic'lar (wha 'bout--g'lang, ye\r\nlazy critter) music ef I done thet.'\r\n\r\n'How much more do you want?' I inquired.\r\n\r\n'The hull figur, (g'up thar, g'lang, ye durnation brute,) nary a red\r\nless.'\r\n\r\n'I will see that Dibble finds no fault, and you shall 'moisten up' at\r\nthe doctor's,' said Preston.\r\n\r\n'Wall, Squire, (d----n yer rotten pictur, why don't ye g'lang?) ef ye\r\nsays thet, (whoa--whoa, thar, ye all-fired rockabone--whoa!) it's a\r\ntrade.'\r\n\r\nThe stage halted, and the woman got inside.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Kinston about an hour after noon, and stopped to dine. The\r\nvillage was composed of about twenty dingy, half-painted\r\ndwelling-houses, and a carriage manufactory--the latter establishment\r\nbeing carried on by an enterprising Yankee, a brother to the stage\r\nproprietor. He told me that he furnished large numbers of vehicles to\r\nthe planters in all parts of the State, and took in pay, cotton, tar,\r\nand turpentine, which he shipped to another brother doing business in\r\nNew York. There were, if I remember aright, five of these brothers,\r\nliving far apart, but all in co-partnership, and owning every thing in\r\ncommon. They were native and natural Yankees, and no disgrace to the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nAfter a meagre meal at 'the doctor's' (that gentleman eked out a dull\r\npractice among his neighbors by a sharp practice on his guests,) we\r\nagain mounted the stage. We had proceeded to within eighteen miles of\r\nNewbern, when suddenly, as the Squire and I were lighting our second\r\nafter-dinner segars, 'kerchunk' went one of the forward wheels, and over\r\nwent the coach in a twinkling. I saved myself by clinging to the seat,\r\nbut Preston was not so fortunate. The first I saw of him he was immersed\r\nin a pool of water some ten feet distant. Luckily the ground was soft,\r\nand he escaped personal injury. When he rose to his feet, his coat, like\r\nJoseph's, was of many colors, a dull clayey-red predominating.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for the clay-eating feminine that her conversation had\r\ndisgusted me. Had she remained outside she might have sighed for her\r\n'Bonaparty' in the torrid region of which she had spoken.\r\n\r\nThe other passengers escaped with a few bruises, and after an hour's\r\nexercise with rails and saplings, we succeeded in prying the wheels out\r\nof the mire. Then the driver discovered that one of the horses had lost\r\nhis shoes, and insisted on having them replaced before he proceeded. We\r\nwere midway between two 'relay-houses,' each being six miles distant,\r\nand the Jehu decided on taking the shoeless horse back to the one we had\r\npassed. As he was unharnessing the animal, I said to him:\r\n\r\n'You say there is a blacksmith at each station--why not go on to the one\r\nahead? It will save time.'\r\n\r\n'The boy at Tom's Store's ran off. Thar an't nary a nig thar to hold the\r\ncritter's huff.'\r\n\r\n'Can not the blacksmith do that himself? I never heard of it's taking\r\ntwo men to shoe one horse!'\r\n\r\n'Wall, it do, stranger. I reckon ye never done that sort o' bisness.'\r\n\r\n'But, can't _you_ do it?'\r\n\r\n'_I_ do it! My bisness ar drivin' hosses, not shoein' on 'em. When I\r\ntakes ter thet I'll let ye know!'\r\n\r\nHe had then taken off the harness and was preparing to mount the animal.\r\n\r\n'Come, come, my good fellow, don't go back for that. Go on, and _I'll_\r\nhold the horse's feet.'\r\n\r\n'_Ye_ hold 'em! I reckon ye wull! I'd like to see a man uv yer cloth a\r\nholdin' a critter's fut! Ha! ha!' Then throwing his leg over the horse's\r\nbare back, he added: 'We doan't cum it over trav'lers thet way, in these\r\ndiggin's--we doan't. We use 'em like folks--we do. Ye can bet yer pile\r\non thet!'\r\n\r\nPreston had been quietly enjoying the dialogue, and as the driver rode\r\naway, said to me:\r\n\r\n'I knew you wouldn't make any thing out of him. Come, let us walk on; a\r\nlittle exercise, after our warm work, will do us good.'\r\n\r\nLeaving the other passengers to await the motions of the driver, the\r\nblacksmith, and the black 'huff'-holder, we trudged on through the mud,\r\nand in about two hours reached the next station.\r\n\r\nThe reader will find the spot which bears the dignified cognomen of\r\n'Tom's Store,' if he looks on the map of North-Carolina. It is there\r\ndestitute of a name, but is plainly designated by the circular character\r\nwhich is applied by geographers to villages. It is situated on the bank\r\nof a small tributary of the Neuse, and consists of a one-story building\r\nabout twenty feet wide, and forty feet long, divided into two\r\napartments, and built of pine slabs. One half of the village is sparsely\r\nfilled with dry-goods, groceries, fish-hooks, log-chains, goose-yokes,\r\ntin-pans, cut-nails, and Jews'-harps, while the other is densely crowded\r\nwith logwood, 'dog-leg,' strychnine, juniper-berries, New-England rum,\r\nand cistern-water, all mixed together. This latter region is the more\r\npopulous neighborhood; and at the date of my visit it was absolutely\r\npacked with thirsty natives, who were imbibing certain fluids known\r\n'down South' as 'blue-ruin,' 'bust-head, 'red-eye,' 'tangle-foot,'\r\n'rifle-whisky,' and 'devil's-dye,' at the rate of a 'bit' a glass, and\r\nof four 'bits' for 'as much as one could carry.'\r\n\r\nI was introduced by the Squire to Tom himself, the illustrious founder\r\nof the village. He was a stout, bloated specimen of humanity, with a\r\nred, pimpled face, a long grizzly beard, small inflamed eyes, and a nose\r\nthat might have been mistaken for a peeled beet. His whole appearance\r\nshowed that he was an _habitué_ of the more fashionable quarter of his\r\nvillage, (the groggery,) and a liberal imbiber of his own compounds. He\r\ninformed me that he did a 'right smart' business; bought dry-goods in\r\n'York,' 'sperrets' in 'Hio, and rum in Bostin', and he added: 'Stranger,\r\nI never keeps none but th' clar juice, th' raal, genuwine critter,\r\nd----d ef I do. Come, take a drink.'\r\n\r\nI declined, when a bystander who seemed to know--he could scarcely keep\r\nhis feet--overhearing the remark, confirmed it by saying with a big\r\noath:\r\n\r\n'It's so, stranger, Tom do keep th' reg'lar critter, th' genuwine juice!\r\nThar's no mistake 'bout thet, fur it gets tight itself ev'ry cold\r\nsnap--d----d if it doan't!'\r\n\r\nThe village, at the date of my visit, had a population of about one\r\nhundred men, women, and children, and they were all assembled on the\r\ncleared plot in front of the store, witnessing a 'turkey-match.' Wishing\r\nto avoid the noisy crowd, and being fatigued with our long tramp over\r\nthe muddy road, my companion and I entered the more reputable portion of\r\nTom's Store in quest of a seat. It was nearly deserted. A lazy yellow\r\nboy was stretched at full length on a pine counter, which kept customers\r\nat an honest distance from the rows of half-filled shelves, occupying\r\nthree sides of the room, and on a low bench in front of him sat a woman\r\nand two children. These four were the only persons in the apartment. The\r\nwoman seemed to be not more than twenty-five, and was dressed in a neat\r\ncalico gown, and had a tidy appearance. A thin woolen shawl was thrown\r\nover her shoulders, and she wore on her head a clean red and yellow\r\nkerchief, tied as a turban, and on her feet white cotton stockings and\r\ncoarse untanned shoes. These last were nearly new, and very clumsy, and,\r\nlike the rest of her costume, travel-stained and bespattered with mud.\r\nShe had evidently walked a long distance that morning.\r\n\r\nHer figure was slight and graceful, and her face very beautiful. She had\r\nlong, black, glossy hair, straight, regular features, a rich olive\r\ncomplexion, and large, dark lustrous eyes, which, as she sat opposite\r\nthe open door, were fixed on the thick, gloomy woods with an earnest,\r\nalmost agonizing gaze, as if they were reading in its tangled depths the\r\ndark, uncertain future that lay before her. Never shall I forget the\r\nexpression of her face. Never have I seen its look of keen, intense\r\nagony, and its full, perfect, utter despair.\r\n\r\nOne of the children was a little girl of about seven years, with a\r\nsweet, hopeful face, a clear rosy skin, and brown, wavy hair; and the\r\nother, a little mulatto boy, a few years older. They each held one of\r\nthe woman's hands, and something peculiar in their attitudes made me\r\nlook closely at them. A thin piece of iron, called by slave-traders a\r\n'bracelet,' encircled their wrists, and fastened their arms to the\r\nwoman's! They were slaves!\r\n\r\nI entered the cabin a few steps in advance of Preston, who paused in the\r\ndoorway as he caught sight of the group. The woman did not notice him,\r\nbut his face turned to a marble white, and his voice trembled with\r\nemotion as he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'My God! Phyllis, is this _you_?'\r\n\r\nThe woman looked up, sprang to her feet, took one step forward, and then\r\nsank to the floor. Stretching out her shackled arms, bound to the\r\nchildren as they were, she clasped his knees and cried out:\r\n\r\n'O Master Robert! dear Master Robert, save me! Oh! save me; for the love\r\nof the dear children, save me!'\r\n\r\nThe little boy and girl took hold of his skirts, and both crying hard,\r\nturned their faces up to his. The youngest said:\r\n\r\n'Oh! do, massa! take us 'way from dis man; he bery bad, massa. He whip\r\nyou' little Rosey 'case she couldn't walk all de way--all de way har,\r\nmassa!'\r\n\r\nThe water gathered in Preston's eyes as he asked:\r\n\r\n'Why did they sell you, Phyllis? Why didn't I know of it?'\r\n\r\n'Missus went to you, Master Robert, but you warn't to home. Master had\r\nto have the money right off. The trader was thar. Master couldn't wait\r\ntill you come back. Oh! save me! He's takin' me to Orleans, to Orleans,\r\nMaster Robert. Do save me! Think of the chil'ren, Master Robert. Oh!\r\nthink of the chil'ren!' And she loosened her hold of his limbs, and wept\r\nas if her very heart was breaking.\r\n\r\nPreston's words came thick and broken, his frame shook, he almost\r\ngroaned as he said:\r\n\r\n'I would to God that I could, Phyllis; but I am in debt--pressed on\r\nevery side. I could not raise the money to save my soul!'\r\n\r\n'O my God! what will become of us?' exclaimed the woman. 'Think of\r\nlittle Lule, Master Robert! They've taken me 'way from her! Oh! what\r\nwill become of her, Master Robert? What will become of _her_?' and she\r\nmoaned and wept harder than before.\r\n\r\nHe stood like a man on whom the sentence of death had fallen. A cold,\r\nglassy look came into his eyes, a thick, heavy sweat started from his\r\nforehead, his iron limbs seemed giving way under him. Placing my hand\r\ngently on his shoulder, I said:\r\n\r\n'How much is needed, my friend?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know,' he replied, pressing his head with his hands as if to\r\nkeep it from bursting. 'How much, Phylly?'\r\n\r\n'Twelve hundred, Master Robert--they sold us for twelve hundred?'\r\n\r\n'Well, well, my good woman, don't feel badly any more. I'll let Master\r\nRobert have the money.'\r\n\r\nThe woman stared at me incredulously for a moment; then, while the\r\nchildren came and clung to my coat as if I were an old friend, she said:\r\n\r\n'Oh! bless you, sir! bless you! I will love you, sir! the children will\r\nforever love you for it.'\r\n\r\nA struggle seemed to be going on in Preston's mind. He was silent for\r\nsome moments; then in a slow, undecided voice he said:\r\n\r\n'It an't right; I can't take it, Kirke. I owe you now. I'm in debt\r\nelsewhere. A judgment has been got against me. My crops have turned out\r\npoorly, I've been to Virginia for money, and can't get a dollar. It\r\nwould not be honest. I can't take it.'\r\n\r\nNo words can picture the look on the woman's face as she said:\r\n\r\n'Oh! do take it, Master Robert! _Do_ take it. I'll work. I'll make it. I\r\ncan make it _very soon_, Master Robert. Oh! _do_ take it!'\r\n\r\n'How much is the judgment?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Only six hundred; but old ---- has it, and he has no mercy. He'll have\r\nthe money at once, or sell every thing--the negroes--every thing!' and\r\nhe choked down the heavy groan which half-escaped his lips.\r\n\r\n'Have you no produce at home?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, about a thousand barrels of rosin; but the river is low. I can't\r\nget it down.'\r\n\r\n'Well, that's worth five hundred where it is. Any cotton?'\r\n\r\n'Only eleven bales--low middling.'\r\n\r\n'That's three hundred more. Consider it ours, and draw at ninety days\r\nfor the whole, judgment and all.'\r\n\r\nThe woman had risen during this conversation, and stood with her eyes\r\nriveted on his face and mine as if her eternal destiny hung on our\r\nwords. When I made the last remark she staggered toward me and fell, as\r\nif dead, at my feet. I brought water from the stream hard by, and we\r\nsoon restored her to herself. Preston then lifted her from the floor,\r\nand placing her tenderly on the bench, said, taking my hand:\r\n\r\n'She and her children are very dear to me. You can not understand how\r\nmuch you have done for me. Words are weak--they can not tell you. I will\r\npay you out of the next crop. Meanwhile, I will re-draw and keep it\r\nafloat.'\r\n\r\n'Do as you like about that. Where is your owner, Phyllis?'\r\n\r\n'Outside, dear master. You'll know him. He's more of us poor creatures\r\nwith him.'\r\n\r\n'Come, Preston, let's see him at once--we've no time to lose--the stage\r\nwill be along soon.'\r\n\r\n'I've no heart for trading now. You manage it, my friend.'\r\n\r\n'Well, as you say; but you'd better be with me. Come.'\r\n\r\n'I will in a moment.'\r\n\r\nHe lingered behind, and when I left the cabin was speaking in a low tone\r\nto the slave-woman. Thinking he would follow in a moment, I went in\r\nquest of the trader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur rebellion is the most stupendous in history. It absorbs the\r\nattention and affects the material interests of the world. The armies\r\nengaged outnumber those of Napoleon. Death never had such a carnival,\r\nand each day consumes millions of treasure. Great is the sacrifice, but\r\nthe cause is peerless and sublime. If God has placed us, as in 1776, in\r\nthe van of the great contest for the rights and liberties of man; if he\r\nhas again assigned us the post of danger and of suffering, it is that of\r\nunfading glory and of imperishable renown. The question with us is that\r\nof national unity and existence, and compromise is treason. To\r\nacknowledge the doctrine of secession, to abdicate the power of\r\nself-preservation, and permit the Union to be dissolved or\r\ndisintegrated, is ruin, disgrace, and suicide. We must fight it out to\r\nthe last. If necessity requires, we can live at home, and reverses or\r\nintervention should only increase our efforts. If need be, all--_all_\r\nwho can bear arms, must take the field, and leave to those who can not,\r\nthe pursuits of industry. If we count not the cost of the struggle in\r\nmen or means, it is because the value of the Union can not be estimated.\r\nIf martyrs from every State, and from nearly every nation of\r\nChristendom, have fallen in our defense, never, in humble faith, we\r\ntrust, has any blood, since that of Calvary, been shed in a cause more\r\nholy.\r\n\r\nOur armies, eventually, must triumph, but to restore, throughout the\r\nrevolted States, the supremacy of the Constitution, we must continue to\r\nmaintain the just distinction between the loyal and disloyal; the\r\ndeluded masses and the rebel leaders. We must also remember, that the\r\nreign of terror has long been supreme in the South, and that thousands\r\nhave been forced into apparent support of the rebellion by threats, by\r\nspoliation, by conscription, by the ruin of their homes, and the loss of\r\ntheir means of subsistence.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of South-Carolina, whose normal condition for more\r\nthan thirty years before she struck down our flag at Sumter, was that of\r\nincipient treason and revolt, no other State really desired to destroy\r\nthe Union. A secret association and active armed conspiracy, and an\r\norganized system of falsehood and misrepresentation, drove the masses,\r\nby sudden action, violence, and terror, into this rebellion; but a large\r\nmajority of the aggregate popular vote of the South was against\r\nsecession.\r\n\r\nIt was a Northern President, yielding to secession leaders, in\r\nopposition to the patriots of the South, who, by the whole power of\r\nExecutive influence and patronage, attempted to force slavery into\r\nKansas, by the crime, heretofore without a name or an example, the\r\nFORGERY OF A CONSTITUTION. This was the tolling of the first bell,\r\nalarming to patriots, but the concerted signal for the grand movement of\r\nthe assassins, then conspiring the death of the Union. It was also a\r\nNorthern President who urged the Lecompton forgery upon Congress, thus\r\nmainly contributing to the downfall of the Union; yet, when the vote was\r\ntaken in the fall of 1860, a majority of the popular suffrage of the\r\nSouth was given to those candidates for the Presidency who had denounced\r\nand opposed this measure, over the candidate, (now in the traitor army,)\r\nwho gave it his support. Thus, on this, as on every other occasion,\r\nwhere the people of the South have not been overborne by violence and\r\nterror, they have rejected at the polls the action of the secession\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nBut the disaster was precipitated, when the same President, rejecting\r\nthe advice of the patriot Scott, refused to reinforce our forts, when\r\nmenaced or beleaguered by traitors, and announced, in his messages, to\r\nour country and all the world, the secession heresy, fatal to all\r\ngovernment, that we had no right to repel force by force, on the part of\r\na State seeking, by armed secession, to destroy the Union. The absurd\r\npolitical paradox was then announced by the President, that a State has\r\nno right to secede, but that the Government has no right to prevent its\r\nsecession. It was this wretched dogma, that paralyzed our energies when\r\nthey were most needed, gave immunity to treason, and invited rebellion,\r\nrendered our stocks unsalable, and induced thousands, at home and\r\nabroad, to believe that the Federal Government was a phantom, which\r\nexisted only in name.\r\n\r\nIf Andrew Jackson had then been President, the rebellion would have been\r\ncrushed by him in embryo, as it was in 1833, without expenditure of\r\nblood or treasure.\r\n\r\nSurely, it is some palliation of the course of the deluded masses of the\r\nSouth, that they heard such pernicious counsels, and from such a source.\r\n\r\nIf, as our army advances, there has not been an open, general return of\r\nthe masses to the Union, we must recollect, that when we did occupy\r\nparts of the South, and then withdrew, how soon the resurging tide of\r\nthe rebellion swept over the devoted region, what scenes of horror and\r\ndesolation ensued, how the homes of those who had welcomed our flag were\r\ngiven to the flames, whilst death was the portion of others. But let us\r\ncrush out the very embers of this rebellion, cherish the devoted\r\npatriots of the South, drive out to other lands the rebel leaders, give\r\nto the ruined and deluded masses ample assurance of permanent\r\nprotection, and they will resume their allegiance to the Union.\r\n\r\nAs a final result, we should not desire to hold the Southern States as\r\nprovinces, for that would fatally exasperate, and tend to perpetuate the\r\ncontest, increase our expenses, destroy our wealth and revenue, render\r\nour taxes intolerable, and endanger our free institutions. When the\r\nrebellion is crushed, we should seek a real pacification, the close of\r\nthe war and its expenses, a cordial restoration of the Union, and return\r\nof that fraternal feeling, which marked the first half century of our\r\nwonderful progress. To insure these great results, the policy of the\r\nGovernment must be _firm_, _clear_, _unwavering_, and marked by\r\ndiscriminating justice and perfect candor. The country is in imminent\r\nperil, and nothing but the truth will avail us. _The North and South\r\nmust understand each other._ The South must know that we realize the\r\nevident truth, that slavery caused the rebellion. Efforts were made on\r\nother questions to shake the Union, but all had proved impotent in the\r\npast, as they must in the future, until we were divided by slavery, the\r\nonly issue which could produce a great rebellion. Nor will angry\r\ndenunciations of the discordant elements of slavery and abolition now\r\nsave us, for still the fact recurs, that without slavery there would\r\nhave been no abolition, and, consequently, no secession. Slavery,\r\ntherefore, was the cause, the _causa causans_, and whilst we should use\r\nall wise and _constitutional_ means to secure its gradual disappearance,\r\nyet we should act justly, remembering how, when, and under what flag\r\nslavery was forced upon the protesting and opposing South, then feeble\r\ncolonies of England. And yet, for nearly thirty years past, England has\r\nconstantly agitated this question here, with a view to dissolve our\r\nUnion, and has thus been mainly instrumental in sowing here the seeds of\r\ndiscord, which fructified in the rebellion.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when the tide of battle seemed adverse, England, giving her\r\nwhole moral aid to the rebellion, demanded from us restitution and\r\napology in the case of the Trent, for an act, which had received the\r\nrepeated sanction of her own example. Her press then teemed with\r\natrocious falsehoods, insulting threats, and exulting annunciations of\r\nour downfall. Her imperious _ultimatum_, excluding arbitrament, was\r\naccompanied by fleets and armies, her cannon thundered on our coast, and\r\nshe became the moral ally of that very slavery which she had forced\r\nupon the South, but which, for nearly thirty years past, she made the\r\ntheme of fierce denunciation of our country, and constant agitation\r\nhere, with one ever-present purpose, _the destruction of this Union_.\r\nAnd now let not England suppose, that there is an American, who does not\r\nfeel the insult and understand the motive. England beheld, in our\r\nwonderful progress, the ocean's scepter slipping from her grasp, our\r\ngrain and cotton almost feeding and clothing the world, our augmenting\r\nskill and capital, our inventive genius, and ever-improving machinery,\r\nour educated, intelligent, untaxed labor, the marvelous increase of our\r\nrevenue, tonnage, and manufactures, and our stupendous internal\r\ncommunications, natural and artificial, by land and water. The last\r\ncensus exhibited to her, our numbers increasing in a ratio, making the\r\nmere _addition_, in the next twenty-five years, equal to her whole\r\npopulation, and our wealth augmenting in a far greater proportion. She\r\nsaw our mines and mountains of coal and iron, (her own great element of\r\nprogress,) exceed hers nearly twenty times, our hydraulic power,\r\nincalculably greater than that of Great Britain; a single American\r\nriver, with its tributaries, long enough to encircle the globe, and that\r\nEngland might be anchored as an island in our inland seas. She witnessed\r\nConnecticut, smaller than many English counties, and with but one sixth\r\nthe population of some of them, appropriating more money for education\r\nin that State, than the British Parliament for the whole realm; that we\r\nhad more heads at work among our laboring classes than all Europe, and\r\nshe realized the great truth, that knowledge is power, reposing on\r\ncommon schools for the whole people. She measured our continental area,\r\nlaved by two oceans, as also by the lakes and the gulf, with a more\r\ngenial sun, and a soil far more fertile and productive than that of\r\nEngland, and nearly thirty times greater in extent. She saw us raise\r\nwithin the loyal States a _volunteer_ army of three fourths of a\r\nmillion, without a conscript, the largest, and far the most intelligent\r\nand effective force in the world, and millions more ready, whenever\r\ncalled, to rush to the defense of the Union, whilst a great and gallant\r\nnavy rose, as if by enchantment, from the ocean. She marked the rapid\r\ntransfer of the command of the commerce of the world from London to\r\nNew-York. She observed the transcendent success of our free\r\ninstitutions, and with that 'fear of change, perplexing monarchs,' she\r\ndreaded the moral influence of our republican system. But why should any\r\nfriend of his country, or of mankind, object to this, if it promoted the\r\nwelfare of the people? We reject all force or intervention. Our only\r\ninfluence is that of our example. If our system was a failure, the\r\ninstitutions of England were not endangered, but strengthened by such a\r\nresult. It was their success only that made them dangerous, not to the\r\npeople of England, but to dynastic ambition, to aristocratic rule, and\r\nto selfish interests. To insure our permanent division, was to destroy\r\nus. Hence, she encouraged the South, acknowledged her as a belligerent,\r\nwelcomed the rebel flag and war vessels into her ports, protected them\r\nthere, enabled them to elude our cruisers, and prepared to aid and\r\nsustain slavery. For a time, with the exception of Cobden and Bright, we\r\nseemed to have had scarcely an influential friend in England. Her masses\r\nfavored us, but five sixths of them are excluded from the polls by\r\nrestricted suffrage. For a time, King Cotton never had more loyal\r\nsubjects, than those who then controlled the press and government of\r\nEngland. Our Union was to be severed, the Southern confederacy\r\nacknowledged, the blockade broken, free trade between the South and\r\nEngland established, cotton given her, and refused us; we were to be\r\nforever cut off from the gulf and the lower Mississippi; Portland (the\r\nstar of the East) was to become a British city, and Maine, always loyal\r\nand patriotic, was to be wrested from us, and reannexed to the British\r\ncrown. It was the carnival of despots, exulting over our anticipated\r\nruin, in our death-struggle in the great cause of human liberty and\r\nhuman progress.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was England that forced slavery upon the South against its\r\nearnest protest, and colonial acts vetoed by the British crown. Then,\r\nduring our colonial weakness and dependence, the kings, and queens, and\r\nparliaments of England, not only legalized and encouraged the African\r\nslave-trade, but gave charters and monopolies for the wretched traffic.\r\nThen the lords and noble ladies, the blood royal, the merchant-princes,\r\nand even the mitred prelates of England, engaged most extensively in\r\nthis accursed commerce, and thousands of the rich and noble of England\r\nenjoy now, by inheritance, fortunes thus accumulated. British vessels,\r\nsailing from British ports, openly displayed there upon their decks the\r\nshackles that were to bind the victims, thousands of whom, in the\r\nhorrors of the middle passage, found unshrouded in an ocean grave, a\r\nhappy escape from sufferings and misery indescribable. It was to these,\r\nour then infant, feeble, and dependent, but protesting colonies of the\r\nSouth, most of these slaves were forced by British avarice, and royal\r\nvetoes on colonial acts of the South prohibiting the traffic. Most\r\njustly then did Mr. Jefferson, in the original of our Declaration of\r\nIndependence, announce the terrible truth as follows:\r\n\r\n'He has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most\r\nsacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who\r\nnever offended him, captivating and carrying them into slavery in\r\nanother hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation\r\nthither. This piratical warfare, the opprobium of INFIDEL powers, is the\r\nwarfare of the CHRISTIAN king of Great Britain. Determined to keep open\r\na market where MEN should be bought and sold, he has prostituted his\r\nnegative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or\r\nrestrain this execrable commerce. And that this assemblage of horrors\r\nmight want no fact of distinguished dye, he is now exciting those very\r\npeople to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which\r\nhe has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded\r\nthem, thus paying off former crimes committed against the LIBERTIES of\r\none people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the LIVES\r\nof another.'\r\n\r\nThe flag of England was then the flag of slavery, and not of slavery\r\nonly, but of the African slave-trade; and wherever slavery now exists,\r\nEngland may look upon it and say, This is the work of my hands--mine was\r\nthe price of blood, and mine all the anguish and despair of centuries of\r\nbondage.\r\n\r\nThis war, then, is mainly the work of England. She forced slavery here,\r\nand then commenced and inflamed here the anti-slavery agitation,\r\nassailing the Constitution and the Union, arresting the progress of\r\nmanumission in the Border States, and finally culminating in the\r\nrebellion. Here, then, in the South are slavery and rebellion, branches\r\nof that Upas tree, whose seeds were planted in our soil by England.\r\n\r\nEngland, then, should never have reproached us with slavery. The work\r\nwas hers, and hers may yet be the dread retribution of avenging justice.\r\nHad the contest she provoked in the Trent affair then happened, the\r\nresult might have been very different from her expectations. Instead of\r\na ruined country, and divided Union, and God save the King played under\r\nthe cross of St. George in Boston, New-York, and Philadelphia, she might\r\nhave heard the music of Yankee Doodle, Hail Columbia, and the\r\nStar-Spangled Banner on the heights of Quebec, reëchoed in fraternal\r\nchorus over the Union intended by God, under one government, of the\r\nvalley of the lakes and the St. Lawrence. Looking nearer home, she might\r\nhave beheld that banner, whose stars she would have extinguished in\r\nblood, floating triumphantly, in union with the Shamrock, over that\r\nglorious Emerald Isle, whose generous heart beats with love of the\r\nAmerican Union, and whose blood, now as ever heretofore, is poured out\r\nin copious libations in its defense. Indeed, but for the forbearance of\r\nour Government, and the judgment and good sense of Lord Lyons, the\r\nconflict was inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe hope was expressed by me in England that 'those glorious isles would\r\nbecome the breakwater of liberty, against which the surges of European\r\ndespotism would dash in vain.' This was her true policy, justice to\r\nIreland, successive reforms in her system, a further wise extension of\r\nthe suffrage, with the vote by ballot, a cordial moral alliance with her\r\nkindred race in America, and a full participation, mutually beneficial,\r\nin our ever enlarging commerce. But her oligarchy has chosen coalition\r\nwith the South and slavery, and war upon our Union and the republican\r\nprinciple. _Divide and conquer_ is their motto, SUICIDE will be their\r\nepitaph.\r\n\r\nEngland is now playing her part in the fourth act of the drama of\r\nslavery. During the first act, for more than a century, she was actively\r\nengaged in the African slave-trade, and in forcing the victims, as\r\nslaves, upon the colonies, against their protest.\r\n\r\nWith the close of the first act came the American Revolution, when, in\r\nthe truthful language of Mr. Jefferson, before quoted, England 'excited\r\nthe slaves to rise in arms among us, and to purchase the liberty of\r\nwhich she had deprived them, by murdering the people on whom she had\r\nobtruded them.'\r\n\r\nThe third act, from 1834 to 1861, presented England engaged in fierce\r\ndenunciations of American slavery. The British pulpit, press, and\r\nhustings, her universities, literature, courts, bar, statesmen, and\r\norators, were all devoted to assaults on American slavery, and upon our\r\nConstitution, for tolerating the system, even for a moment. Her\r\nParliament most graciously favored us with one of its own members, to\r\ndenounce in the _North_, the slavery of the _South_, inflaming sectional\r\npassions and hatred, with the fixed purpose of dissolving the Union. As\r\nall the slaves whom England had sent to Boston, had been manumitted in\r\n1780, and there was no slavery there, the object was, not to abolish\r\nslavery, or the mission would have been to the South, where the\r\ninstitution and the power over it existed, but the movement was made in\r\nthe North, not to destroy slavery, but to dissolve the Union. England\r\nhaving failed to accomplish our overthrow in the two great wars of 1776\r\nand 1812, she commenced the third war upon us, not from the mouths of\r\nher cannon, but in zealous efforts, continued now for more than a fourth\r\nof a century, to divide the Union, by the agitation of this question. We\r\nare indebted to England for the curse of slavery, and then for the\r\nslavery agitation. In this she has been but too successful North and\r\nSouth; but if slavery should perish in the conflict, she will mourn the\r\nresult, because it removes our only dangerous element of discord.\r\n\r\nAnd now the curtain has risen on the fourth act, and England, as always\r\nheretofore, is the chief actor. And where now is the great anti-slavery\r\nagitator? Why, England has reversed her position, and suddenly\r\ndiscovered the surpassing beauty and perfection of secession and\r\nslavery. Secession, an anarchical absurdity, destructive of all law, and\r\nall government, she kindly adopts as the true theory of our system. This\r\nheresy was discarded by Washington, Madison, Hamilton, and all the\r\nillustrious founders of the Constitution. It was exposed, in all its\r\ndeformity, by Jackson, Clay, and Webster, in 1833, when it was rejected\r\nby _every State_, except South-Carolina. But England repudiates the\r\ndoctrine at home, and abroad also, except for our country. Substituting\r\nher wishes for the fact, she declares we are not a nation, and that any\r\nState has a legal and moral right to secede and dissolve the Union.\r\nDeplorable would have been the folly of such a system, and well then\r\nmight England have exulted over the failure of republics. Nothing but\r\nher intense desire for this failure could have induced England to adopt\r\nthis absurd doctrine. The whole world perceives the motive for so false\r\na pretense, and history will expose and denounce it.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as to slavery, let us compare the England of 1834 and 1860, and\r\nall the intermediate period, with the England of 1861 and 1862. What a\r\nrevolution? Where now are her daily denunciations of slavery? Where now\r\nis Exeter Hall, so lately teeming with anti slavery harangues, but now\r\ncheering the slavery rebellion? Where are the abolition lords and ladies\r\nof England; where the reverend clergy; where the public press, and\r\nParliament? Has England been struck dumb in a moment, that she can no\r\nlonger denounce a system which, up to the hour of pro-slavery secession,\r\nshe had, from day to day, during more than a fourth of a century,\r\ndeclared to combine all the crimes of the decalogue? Where now are the\r\ncompliments that were lavished upon _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ and its gifted\r\nwriter? Where are the notices in England, of our recent great\r\nanti-slavery work, _Among the Pines_, by the celebrated Edmund Kirke,\r\n'who awoke one morning and found himself famous'? The book is read and\r\ncirculated here by thousands, but none will notice or take it now in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBut England is not silent. Her press, her statesmen, and even members of\r\nher cabinet, declare that the rebellion has dissolved our Union, and\r\ndestroyed our Government. They say we can never conquer the rebellion;\r\nthat we should abandon the contest, acknowledge the South as an\r\nindependent power, give it all the Gulf, two thirds of the Atlantic, all\r\nthe Chesapeake, half the Ohio, all the lower Mississippi and its mouth,\r\ncut our territory into two parts, acknowledge the right of secession,\r\nand the absolute dissolution of the Union. Such is the assurance of\r\nrightful and certain success by which England encourages the rebels,\r\nwhile _surrender_, is the advice she gratuitously urges upon us, from\r\nday to day. But England is not the only false prophet whose predictions\r\nwere based only on her wishes. Indeed, many of her presses and statesmen\r\nopenly avow their belief and desire that the Union should be overthrown.\r\nOur area, they say, is too large, although all compact and connected by\r\nthe greatest arterial river-system of the globe. But England is not\r\nlarge enough, and new possessions are constantly added by the sword,\r\nalthough her territory is double our own, and scattered over all the\r\ncontinents, and many of the isles of the world. If, before or shortly\r\nafter this struggle began, England had spoken a word of friendship and\r\nsympathy for us--if she had but repeated her former denunciations of\r\nslavery, and given us the moral weight of her opinion--the rebellion\r\nwould have been crushed long since. If--claiming to be our mother--she\r\nhad only, in this crisis, acted as such, in her hour of need a kindred\r\nrace would have rallied to her rescue. But now, so long as this wicked\r\noligarchy rules her destiny never--never! It was England forced slavery\r\nupon us. It was England fastened upon our feeble, youthful limbs, this\r\npoisoned shirt of Nessus, and then, when we were tearing it from us,\r\neven though the vitals and the life-blood might follow, England exulted\r\nin what she believed to be our dying agonies.\r\n\r\nThis is no fancy sketch, but a dread reality. It has filled our cup with\r\nsorrow; it is mingled with every tear that falls upon the dying\r\npatriot's couch; it is wafted with every agonizing sigh that follows the\r\ndeparted spirit; it is felt in every house of mourning, and is seared,\r\nin letters of fire and blood, upon the memory of every American.\r\n\r\nBut England now says that Slavery was not the cause of the war. Yet it\r\nwas so avowed in every secession ordinance, and in the confederate\r\nconstitution. None but a slave State revolted; none but a slave State\r\ncan be admitted into the rebel confederacy; and slavery is extended by\r\ntheir constitution over all existing or after-acquired territory. If\r\nEngland should ever form a part of slavedom, slavery would be extended\r\nthere, and slaves could be bought and sold in London. Other revolts have\r\nbeen against tyranny, but this is a rebellion of slavery against\r\nfreedom, of the few against the many, of the bayonet against the ballot,\r\nof capital invested in man as a chattel, against free labor and free\r\nmen. The tariff was scarcely referred to in the contest at the South.\r\nThe tariff then existing was a free-trade measure, prepared by the\r\nleaders of this rebellion, and passed in 1856, by the aid of their\r\nvotes. That tariff was twenty per cent lower than the revenue act of\r\n1846. The tariff of 1846 was proposed in the Treasury Report of\r\nDecember, 1845, which report was quoted by Sir Robert Peel in his speech\r\nof January, 1846, and made the basis of his motion to repeal the corn\r\nlaws. But the free-trade bill of 1856 (duties on exports being\r\nprohibited) was _the law of the land_ when the Cotton States seceded in\r\nDecember, 1860, and January and February, 1861, and inaugurated the\r\nrebel government. It was not until _after_ all this, that this measure\r\nwas repealed, in March, 1861. This repeal could never have occurred but\r\nfor the prior withdrawal of the Cotton States from Congress. The great\r\nagricultural and exporting North-west was opposed to high tariffs; so\r\nalso was New-York, the great mart of foreign commerce. The South has\r\nalways been greatly divided on this question, and, since the act of\r\n1846, the aggregate popular vote of the North has always been nearly\r\ndouble that of the South against high tariffs. The author of the tariff\r\nof 1846, is now, as always heretofore, devoting all his energies to the\r\nsupport of the Union. So is the distinguished Republican Senator from\r\nPennsylvania, the author of the celebrated anti-slavery Wilmot Proviso,\r\nwho, with many other Republican Senators and members supported the\r\ntariff of 1846. So is the eminent ex-Vice-President, (who gave the\r\ncelebrated casting vote for the tariff of 1846,) supporting the Union.\r\nBut it is enough that a majority of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet supported the\r\ntariff of 1846. No, the tariff had nothing to do with the rebellion. It\r\nwas slavery alone that produced the revolt. There are, however,\r\nthousands who favored the act of 1846, and even of 1856, desiring\r\nenlarged trade between _friendly_ nations, who regard England now, as\r\nthe enemy of our Union, the champion of secession, and the friend of\r\nthis infernal pro-slavery rebellion.\r\n\r\nI have stated that the South must know what course we intend to pursue\r\nin regard to slavery. But not only the South, but our friends and\r\nenemies, and _all the world_ must also know, that the AMERICAN UNION\r\nSHALL NEVER BE DISMEMBERED. It is the great citadel of self-government,\r\nintrusted to our charge by Providence, and we will defend it against all\r\nassailants until our last man has fallen. The lakes can never be\r\nseparated from the Gulf, nor the Eastern from the Western Ocean. As the\r\nsun high advanced in the heavens illumes our flag on the Atlantic, its\r\nfirst morning beams shall salute our kindred banner-stars on the shores\r\nof the Pacific, the present western limit of this great republic.\r\nAlready the telegraphic lightning flashes intelligence from ocean to\r\nocean, and soon the iron horse, starting from the Atlantic on his\r\ncontinental tour, shall announce his own advent on the shores of the\r\nPacific, The lakes of the North are united by railroads and canals with\r\nthe Atlantic, the Gulf, the Ohio, and Mississippi, and our iron gunboats,\r\nbearing aloft in war and in peace the emblems of our country's glory,\r\nare soon to perform their great circuit from the Albemarle, the Potomac,\r\nthe Chesapeake, the Susquehanna, the Delaware, and the Hudson, to the\r\nLakes and the Mississippi. Above all, the valley of the Mississippi was\r\nordained by God as the residence of a united people. Over every acre of\r\nits soil must forever float the banner of the Union, and all its waters,\r\nas they roll on together to the Gulf, proclaim that what 'God has joined\r\ntogether, man shall never put asunder.' The nation's life-blood courses\r\nthis vast arterial system, and to sever it is death. No line of latitude\r\nor longitude shall ever separate the mouth from the centre or sources\r\nof the Mississippi. All the waters of the imperial river, from their\r\nmountain springs and crystal fountains, shall ever flow in commingling\r\ncurrents to the Gulf, uniting evermore in one undivided whole, the\r\nblessed homes of a free and happy people. The Ohio and Missouri, the Red\r\nRiver and the Arkansas, shall never be dissevered from the Mississippi.\r\nPittsburgh and Louisville, Cincinnati and St. Louis, shall never be\r\nseparated from New-Orleans, or mark the capitals of disunited and\r\ndiscordant States. That glorious free-trade between all the States (the\r\ngreat cause of our marvelous progress) shall in time, notwithstanding\r\nthe present suicidal folly of England, go on in its circuit among\r\naccordant peoples throughout the globe, the precursor of that era of\r\nuniversal and unrestricted commerce, whose sceptre is peace, and whose\r\nreign the fusion and fraternity of nations, as foretold by the holy\r\nprophets in the Scriptures of truth.\r\n\r\nThis great valley, one mighty plain, without an intervening mountain,\r\ncontains, west of the Mississippi, seven States and Territories of an\r\narea sufficient for thirteen more of the size of New-York. East of the\r\nMississippi, it embraces all the remaining States except New-England,\r\nNew-Jersey, Delaware, South-Carolina, and Florida. New-York is connected\r\nwith the great valley by the Alleghany River; and Maryland by the\r\nCastleman's River and the Youghiogany, and Alabama, North-Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia, by the Tennessee and its tributaries. Nearly one half the area\r\nof Pennsylvania and Virginia is within its limits. Michigan is united\r\nwith it by the Wisconsin River, and Texas by the Red River; whilst Ohio,\r\nIndiana, and Kentucky, Wisconsin, Illinois, Tennessee, and Mississippi,\r\nMinnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Louisiana, and Arkansas own almost\r\nexclusively its sway.\r\n\r\nAnd who will dare erect the feeble barriers designed to seclude the\r\ngreat valley and its products from either ocean, the Lakes, or the Gulf,\r\nor persuade her to hold these essential rights and interests by the\r\nwretched tenure of the will of any seceding State? No line but one of\r\nblood, of military despotisms, and perpetual war, can ever separate this\r\ngreat valley. The idea is sacrilege. It is the raving of a maniac.\r\nSeparation is death. Disunion is suicide. If the South presents the\r\nissue that the Union or slavery must perish, the result is not doubtful.\r\nSlavery will die. It will meet a traitor's doom, wherever it selects a\r\ntraitor's position. The Union will still live. It is written on the\r\nscroll of destiny, by the finger of God, that 'neither principalities\r\nnor powers' shall effect its overthrow, nor shall 'the gates of hell\r\nprevail against it.'\r\n\r\nNor will we ever surrender the grave of Washington. There, upon the\r\nPotomac, on whose banks he was born and died, the flag of the Union must\r\nfloat over his sacred sepulchre, until the dead shall be summoned from\r\ntheir graves by the trump of the resurrection.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth of July, 1776, when our name was first inscribed upon the\r\nroll of nations, shall be forever commemorated under one flag, and as\r\nthe birthday of one undivided Union. The memorable declaration of\r\nAmerican Independence, the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution\r\nof the United States, all subscribed upon that consecrated ground at\r\nIndependence Hall, Philadelphia, shall ever mark the noble commonwealth\r\nof Pennsylvania as the keystone of the arch of a perpetual and unbroken\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nNor shall any but the same banner be unfolded over the graves of the\r\npatriots and statesmen of the Revolution, or the battle-fields of the\r\nmighty conflict.\r\n\r\nAnd around the graves of Washington and Jackson, and in memory of their\r\nsolemn farewell appeals in favor of the Union, how could Virginia or\r\nTennessee ever have been disloyal? No, they were not disloyal, but were\r\ntorn, by rebel fraud and violence, from that banner round which they\r\nwill again rejoice to rally.\r\n\r\nWe must not despair of the Republic. All is not lost. The Union yet\r\nlives. Its restoration approaches. The calm will soon follow the storm.\r\nThe golden sunlight and the silver edging of the azure clouds will be\r\nseen again in the horizon. The bow of promise will appear in the\r\nheavens, to mark the retiring of the bitter waters, proclaiming from on\r\nhigh, that now, henceforth, and forever, no second secession deluge\r\nshall ever disturb the onward, united, and peaceful march of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR WOUNDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  As loftier rise the ocean's heaving crests,\r\n    Ere they sink, tempest-driven, on the strand;\r\n  So do these hearts and freedom-beating breasts,\r\n    Sublimed by suffering, fall upon our land.\r\n\r\n  Wounded! O sweet-lipped word! for on the page\r\n    Of this strange history, all these scars shall be\r\n  The hieroglyphics of a valiant age,\r\n    Deep writ in freedom's blood-red mystery.\r\n\r\n  What though your fate sharp agony reveals!\r\n    What though the mark of brother's blows you bear!\r\n  The breath of your oppression upward steals,\r\n    Like incense from crushed spices into air.\r\n\r\n  Freedom lies listening, nor as yet averts\r\n    The battle horrors of these months' slow length;\r\n  But as she listens, silently she girts\r\n    More close, more firm, the armor of her strength.\r\n\r\n  Then deem them not as lost, these bitter days,\r\n    Nor those which yet in anguish must be spent\r\n  Far from loved skies and home's peace-moving ways,\r\n    For these are not the losses you lament.\r\n\r\n  It is the glory that your country bore,\r\n    Which you would rescue from a living grave;\r\n  It is the unity that once she wore,\r\n    Which your true hearts are yearning still to save.\r\n\r\n  Despair not: _it is written_, though the eye,\r\n    Red with its watching, can no future scan:\r\n  The glow of triumph yet shall flush the sky,\r\n    And God redeem the ruin made by man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SOUTHERN REVIEW.\r\n\r\n\r\nA friend 'down South' has kindly sent us a number of '_De Bow's Review,\r\nIndustrial Resources_, etc.,' as its elegantly worded title-page\r\nproclaims. It is true that the number in question is none of the\r\nfreshest, it having appeared at Charleston, in December last. Yet, as a\r\nSouthern magazine published during the war, and full of war matter, it\r\nis replete with interest.\r\n\r\nIts first article on Privateers and Privateersmen, by George Fitzhugh of\r\nVirginia--as arrogant, weak, and Sophomorical as Southern would-be\r\n'literary' articles usually are--is written in a vein of reasoning so\r\noddly illogical as to almost induce suspicion as to the sanity of the\r\nauthor. Let the reader take, for instance, the following extracts:\r\n\r\n     'To show how untenable and absurd are the doctrines of the writers\r\n     on the laws of war, we will cite the instance of pickets. According\r\n     to their leading principle that in war 'only such acts of hostility\r\n     are permissible as weaken the enemy and advance and promote the\r\n     ends and purposes of the war,' pickets are the very men to be\r\n     killed, for the death of one of them may effect a surprise and\r\n     victory, and do more injury to the enemy than the killing of a\r\n     thousand men in battle. According to their doctrine, it is\r\n     peculiarly proper and merciful to shoot pickets; yet they propose\r\n     to interpolate on the laws of war a provision that pickets shall\r\n     not be shot. This provision is, in accordance with our philosophy,\r\n     founded on Christian principles and the dictates of healthy\r\n     humanity, for pickets are not active belligerents, and can oppose\r\n     no force to the stealthy attacks made on them by unseen enemies. To\r\n     kill a picket is like fighting an unarmed man, a child or a woman.\r\n     It is eminently right according to the selfish and silly philosophy\r\n     of writers on national law, but inhuman, and therefore wrong,\r\n     according to our philosophy, which is founded on Christian\r\n     injunctions and natural feelings.\r\n\r\n     'Yet, as a matter of necessity, we would encourage the shooting of\r\n     pickets. We of the South are accustomed to the use of arms, are\r\n     individually brave and self-reliant, can creep upon their pickets\r\n     and shoot them in the night, and thus carry out our defensive\r\n     policy of exhausting in detail the superior numbers of the invading\r\n     North. We must be conquered and subjugated unless we take advantage\r\n     of all our peculiarities of habits, customs, localities, and\r\n     institutions. We have to make a choice of evils; either shoot\r\n     pickets, or by neglecting to do so, cut off one of our most\r\n     available arms of defense. We must fight the 'devil with fire.' Our\r\n     enemy professes no allegiance to the laws of morality nor to the\r\n     laws of God. We must deal with them as Moses dealt with the people\r\n     of Canaan, so long as they invade our territory. But we are not\r\n     God's chosen people, not his instruments to punish Canaanites, and\r\n     we will not follow them when they retreat to their barren Northern\r\n     homes. There a just and avenging God is already punishing them for\r\n     their crimes. Left to themselves, and our real enemies--those of\r\n     the North-east--will perish, for they have little means of support\r\n     at home, and have not learned to avail themselves of those means,\r\n     trusting that a generous and confiding South would continue to feed\r\n     and clothe them.\r\n\r\n     'In old countries, where there are few trees, forests, or other\r\n     hiding-places, and where the country people are unused to firearms,\r\n     an invaded country gains little by shooting pickets; but in a new,\r\n     rough country like ours, where pickets can be approached furtively,\r\n     and where all the country people are first-rate marksmen, there is\r\n     no better means of harassing and exhausting an invading army than\r\n     by cutting off its outposts in detail.\r\n\r\n     'It is the obvious interest of the North to make the persons of\r\n     pickets sacred; and equally _our_ obvious policy to shoot them down\r\n     at every opportunity.'\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these slightly confused arguments on war, the writer\r\nsuddenly introduces a very out of place eulogy of '_De Bow's Review,\r\nIndustrial Resources_, etc.,' as a periodical 'which occupies a much\r\nwider range than any English periodical, and which, _as an\r\nEncyclopedia_, would be more valuable than any other Review, were equal\r\npains and labor bestowed upon its articles.' We suspect this bit to be\r\noffice-made--it has the heavy, clumsy ring of the great cracked bell of\r\nDe Bow. For instance:\r\n\r\n     'I know, Mr. Editor, you intend, so soon as the war is over, to\r\n     enlarge the _Review_, without increasing the subscription-price\r\n     ... and then if Southern patronage ceases to be bestowed chiefly\r\n     on the flimsy and immoral literature of the North, and Southern\r\n     pens cease to prostitute themselves for pay by ministering to the\r\n     vile and sensual literary appetites of the Yankees, then, we say,\r\n     this _Review_ will rank with the ablest for ability, and far above\r\n     them for usefulness. But this result can be attained only when we\r\n     cease to be Yankee-worshipers, and when the semi-traitorous\r\n     imbeciles of the Virginia Convention and of Kentucky are remembered\r\n     only to be detested and despised. Already hundreds of scientific\r\n     and philosophic minds who have thrown off the debasing influence of\r\n     Yankee authority have contributed learned and valuable articles to\r\n     your pages.'\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the character of De Bow as a deliberate and accomplished\r\nliar, and the exposure of his infamous falsification of statistics, have\r\nsomewhat sunk the character of his '_Review, Industrial Resources_,\r\netc.,' out of Dixie, where, only, due honor is paid to those who are\r\nlike him\r\n\r\n        ----'for profound\r\n  And solid lying much renowned.'\r\n\r\n'Art. II.' or Article the Second, in this magazine, 'which only needs\r\nequal pains and labor' [we might add paper, ink, and a Yankee Grammar\r\nand Dictionary] to be made equal to 'any other Review'--treats of 'The\r\nBastile--Tyranny, Past and Present.' All the doleful stories of\r\nprisoners of earlier or later ages, in the Bastile, including much\r\nsentimental balderdash, are drawled out by a very stupid and would-be\r\neffective writer, for the purpose of proving that the imprisonment of\r\npolitical offenders and captives by the North is precisely on a par with\r\nthat of 'Bastiling' them, and that Abraham Lincoln is only a revival of\r\nthe worst kings of France in an American form. We of the North have,\r\naccording to this writer, 'reached the goal of despotism at a single\r\nleap. In a few months the government has achieved ETERNAL INFAMY.' We\r\ncommend to the reader the following superbly Southern conclusion:\r\n\r\n     'With all these evils comes the inevitable Bastile. It is an\r\n     inseparable part of the system. A philosophical Cuvier, from one\r\n     act or condition of tyranny, will supply the rest of the organism.\r\n     Wherever despotism exists, we look for the Bastile as naturally as\r\n     we do for the character of a robber in an Italian story. Like the\r\n     ponderous step of the statue of the commander in the _Don Juan_ of\r\n     Molière, its approach is audible above civil commotion, above the\r\n     shrieks of frenzied orators, the howlings of a demoralized clergy,\r\n     and the sound of battle. It brings with it the destruction of civil\r\n     liberty, and darkens all the perspective.'\r\n\r\nTo us, to whom the approach of despotism with all its horrors is not\r\nquite so apparent as the heavy footfall 'in the _Don Juan_ of Molière,'\r\nthis all sounds as if Dixie would very much like to have the little\r\nprivilege of keeping all the prisoners to itself. Nothing is said, by\r\nthe way, of Southern Bastiles--of tobacco-factories, in which mere boys\r\nare allowed to die of wounds in utter solitude, to which officers come\r\nfor the purpose of spitting upon and kicking the 'Yanks,' and where\r\nsentinels in wanton fiendishness were allowed to daily shoot through the\r\nwindows at those within. No word is spoken of officers thrown into a\r\ncommon dungeon with negroes and thieves, nor is there any allusion to\r\nthe ingenious system of keeping Northern prisoners as long as possible,\r\nso that they may die and thereby diminish the numbers of the enemy, in\r\naccordance with the Southern plan of Fitzhugh, already cited, as 'our\r\ndefensive policy of exhausting _in detail_ the superior numbers of the\r\ninvading North.'\r\n\r\n'Article III.' gives us a rehash of the views of Dr. Cartwright on 'The\r\nSerpent, the Ape, and the Negro.'\r\n\r\n'Article IV.' by E. Delony, of Louisiana, is the great political gun of\r\nthe magazine, and inquires: 'What of the the Confederacy--the Present\r\nand the Future?' It is of course full of hope, bluster, and self-praise.\r\n'Our armies,' says Delony, 'are not like the miserable hirelings of\r\nLincoln--the scum of infamy and degradation--hunted up from the dens,\r\nsewers, and filthy prisons of the North, with the low vandalism of\r\nforeign importations, picked up wherever they can be found. Yet such are\r\nthe creatures our brave soldiers have to meet. _Our_ armies are\r\ncomposed of men who have not volunteered for pay, nor for food or\r\nclothing!'\r\n\r\nSince copying this paragraph, it was recalled to us--within a few\r\nhours--by meeting some half-dozen of the 'scum of sewers' in question,\r\nin the persons of half-a-dozen young gentlemen, privates in a\r\nMassachusetts regiment, several of them college graduates--all of them\r\nsons of wealthy citizens and gentlemen. It would be interesting to\r\nascertain, taking man for man, what proportion of the Southern and\r\nNorthern armies are respectively able to read, or are otherwise\r\npersonally familiar with the decencies and proprieties of civilized\r\nlife. From this assumption of superiority Mr. Delony argues victory,\r\nasks, 'What about the peace?' and inquires if the Federal Government\r\nwill offer to negotiate for it?\r\n\r\n     'We can _propose_ no terms, but we must _demand_ them. We desire\r\n     nothing that is not right and just, and we will submit to nothing\r\n     that is wrong. But no peace will be acceptable to the people that\r\n     permits the Lincoln Government to hold its Abolition orgies and\r\n     fulminate its vile edicts upon slave territory. Much valuable\r\n     property of our citizens has been destroyed, or stolen and carried\r\n     off by the invaders; this should be accounted for, and paid. The\r\n     Yankees were shrewd enough to cheat us out of the navy, but we must\r\n     have half of the war-vessels and naval armament in possession of\r\n     the North at the commencement of this war. We should enter into no\r\n     commercial alliances or complications with them, but assume the\r\n     entire control of our commercial policy and regulations with them,\r\n     to be modified at our own discretion and pleasure. They have closed\r\n     against us all navigation and trade on the Mississippi, Missouri,\r\n     and other rivers; it is our right and duty hereafter so to regulate\r\n     the navigation of these streams as may best conform to our own\r\n     interests. It can not be expected that we should permit the free\r\n     navigation of the Lower Mississippi to the West after they have\r\n     closed it against us above, without the most stringent regulations.\r\n     There is no palliation in the pretense that the blockade above was\r\n     a war measure; they can not so claim it unless we had been\r\n     acknowledged as belligerents, and hence they have forfeited all\r\n     right to free navigation as a peace measure. If, then, permission\r\n     be given to the Free States of the West to navigate the Lower\r\n     Mississippi, it should be under such restrictions as to afford a\r\n     commensurate revenue to the confederacy, and the strictest rules\r\n     regulating the ingress and egress of passengers, officers, and\r\n     hands. The West is learning us how to do without her, and we thank\r\n     her for it; we shall have but little need of her produce, as we\r\n     shall soon have a plentiful supply among our own people. An\r\n     absolute separation from all the North, with the sole and\r\n     independent control of all regulations with its people, are our\r\n     best and safest terms of peace.'\r\n\r\nWhat is further hoped for is shown in remarks on the\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTENT OF THE CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\n     'We have conquered an outlet to the Pacific which must be\r\n     maintained, though we can desire no dominion on the Pacific coast,\r\n     but such as may be sufficient to secure the terminus of our great\r\n     Pacific railroad through Texas and Arizona. Toward the north and\r\n     east, the Maryland and Pennsylvania line, including Delaware, is\r\n     our true landmark. Kansas, on the other side, must be conquered and\r\n     confiscated to pay for the negroes stolen from us, abolitionism\r\n     expelled from its borders, and transformed into a Slave State of\r\n     the confederacy. Perhaps, after we have done with Lincoln, this\r\n     arrangement may be very acceptable to a majority in Kansas, without\r\n     force. We will have no desire to disturb Mexico so long as she\r\n     conducts herself peaceably toward us, and, as a neighbor, maintains\r\n     good faith in her dealings with us. Central America must remain as\r\n     a future consideration; and, instead of the acquisition of Cuba,\r\n     she has become our _friendly ally_, identified with us in interests\r\n     and institutions, and, so long as she continues to hold slaves,\r\n     connected with us by the closest ties.'\r\n\r\nBut the strong point of the article consists in a fierce onslaught on\r\nforeigners, all of whom, save those now resident in the South, are to be\r\nexcluded from citizenship and office. 'With the exception of these, and\r\nafter that time, no more votes should be allowed, and no' more offices\r\nbe held, except by _native-born_ citizens of the confederacy.'\r\n\r\n     'The naturalization law of the old Government has proved of little\r\n     benefit to the Southern States. Whilst our Southern adopted\r\n     citizens have proven themselves reliable, faithful, and true to\r\n     our institutions of the South, those of the North, who outnumber\r\n     them twenty to one, have universally arrayed themselves foremost\r\n     and in front of Lincoln's hordes in the work of rapine, murder, and\r\n     destruction against the South. _Hereafter then, we can make no\r\n     distinction between the Yankee and the foreigner, and both must\r\n     necessarily be debarred of the privilege of citizenship in this\r\n     confederacy._'\r\n\r\nDelony, it seems, has 'viewed this question in all its bearings,'\r\n'foremost and in front' of course included, and deems its adoption\r\neminently essential to the future stability and welfare of the\r\nconfederacy. The abolition of _all_ impost duties and a system of direct\r\ntaxation, are of course warmly advocated--meaning thereby the ruin of\r\nNorthern manufactures by smuggling European goods over our border. In\r\nshort, he sets forth plainly what is as yet far from being felt or\r\ngenerally understood, that the independence of the Southern confederacy\r\nmust inevitably bring with it the total ruin of the North, and the\r\nentire exclusion from its citizenship and offices of all persons other\r\nthan native-born Southerners.\r\n\r\n'Article V.' is one of those intensely snobbish, sickening,\r\nself-conscious essays on 'Gentility,' which none but a Southerner is\r\ncapable of writing. The innate vulgarity of its author, 'J. T. Wiswall,\r\nof Alabama,' is shown in such expressions as 'a pretty Romeo of\r\nseventeen, that looks as charming as sweet sixteen, _gallused up_ in\r\ntight unmentionables,' and in artless confessions that he--J. T.\r\nWiswall--belongs to a class above the snob, but still to one 'whose\r\nconversation stalks as on stilts,' and which is foppish, effeminate, and\r\nostentatious. The conclusion is, of course, the worship of\r\n'aristocracy,' a worship of which, as J.T. Wiswall infers from his own\r\nshallow reading and flimsy experience, exists 'in every heart.' The\r\nwants of the rich, their 'toys and gauds,' 'were made to relieve the\r\nsufferings of the poor,' and the 'ceaseless abuse of aristocracy is\r\n_therefore_ absurd.' Without the great truths, based on these relations\r\nof rich and poor, J. T. W., the apostle of 'Gentility,' thinks that\r\n'society is a murderous anarchy; without these, revolution follows\r\nrevolution, and barbarism closes the hideous drama of national\r\nexistence. On these alone hang all the law and prophets.'\r\n\r\nThe remaining articles of '_De Bow's Review, Industrial Resources_,\r\netc.,' are devoted to Free Trade, the Progress of the War, and the\r\nCoal-Fields of Arkansas, none of them, with the exception of the latter,\r\npresenting aught like an approach to a useful truth. The magazine is,\r\nhowever, as a whole both curious and characteristic. It shows, as in a\r\nmirror, the enormous ambition, the uneasy vanity, the varnished\r\nvulgarity of the Southerner, his claims to scrupulous honor, outflanked\r\nand contradicted at every turn by an innate tendency to exaggerate and\r\nmisrepresent, and his imperfect knowledge employed as a basis for the\r\nmost weighty conclusions. And it is such writers and thinkers who\r\naccurately set forth the ideas and principles on which the great\r\nexperiment of the Southern aristocratic confederacy is to be based--in\r\ncase of its success. A tremendous Ism, fringed with bayonets! There is\r\nstrength in bayonets, but what stability is there in the Ism which\r\nsupports them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST AND WEST.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the far East the imperial rule\r\n    Is aided by the British rod;\r\n  While in the West the rebel school\r\n    Receives full many a friendly nod.\r\n  Can no new Mithra ever be\r\n    To slay this Bull of tyranny?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Everyone _lives_ it--to\r\n     not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting.'--_Goethe._\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished or\r\n     intended.'--_Webster's Dictionary._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHOW HIRAM MEEKER FLOURISHED AT BURNSVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram entered on his new duties--I was about to say with zeal and\r\nactivity; such are not the words I would employ to describe his conduct\r\nor character, but rather earnestness and fidelity. Neither do these\r\nterms precisely convey my meaning, but none better occur to me. He was\r\nquiet and unobtrusive, at the same time alert and ready. Absolutely\r\nnegative in his manner, he did not leave a salient point for Mr. Burns\r\nto lay hold of. His first object was to learn exactly the situation of\r\nhis employer's affairs, and that without manifesting the least curiosity\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nOf course, such an event as the introduction of a young man into Mr.\r\nBurns's private office was soon known all over town. The appearance of\r\nthe new-comer was scrutinized, and every word and gesture watched. This\r\nHiram knew very well, and bore himself accordingly. Wherever he went,\r\nwhether on some business to Slab City with Mr. Burns's horse and wagon,\r\nor into the store, or about the village, he carried with him the\r\ncareful, considerate air of one who is charged with affairs of the\r\ngreatest importance.\r\n\r\nDo not think Hiram was so foolish as to assume a consequential air--not\r\nhe. His manner appeared quite involuntary; produced necessarily by the\r\ngrave matters he had in charge. He was by no means reserved. He was\r\nalways ready to enter into conversation and to answer questions,\r\nprovided the questions did not refer to his employer's business. Thus he\r\nsoon gained the reputation in Burnsville which he had in Hampton, of\r\nbeing a very agreeable young man. At first his presence rather puzzled\r\nthe good people, and some would inquire of Hiram what he was 'hired\r\nfor;' his answer was ready and explicit: 'To act as confidential clerk\r\nfor Mr. Burns.' This would be pronounced in a tone so decided, that\r\nwhile it only stimulated the curiosity of the inquirer, it checked\r\nfurther questioning.\r\n\r\nIn this way, without appearing conceited, arrogant, or consequential,\r\nour hero managed to impress every body with the importance and\r\nresponsibility of his position. Wherever he appeared, folks would say:\r\n'There goes Meeker.' As Mr. Burns's representative, he was noticed more\r\nthan Mr. Burns himself. Hiram knew very well how to manage all this, and\r\nhe did so to perfection.\r\n\r\nIt would have done you good to see Hiram on Sunday, elaborately dressed,\r\ngoing to church with the Widow Hawkins on his arm, followed by the two\r\nMiss Hawkins. Walking up the aisle, his countenance composed and\r\nserious, he would open the pew-door and wait reverently for Mrs. H. and\r\nthe young ladies, to pass in. They, 'the young ladies,' would flutter\r\nalong and enter the pew with a pleased, satisfied air--they were already\r\nin love with Hiram--and after the usual turnings and twistings and\r\nadjustments, would take their seats, the one next our hero giving him a\r\nlittle bit of a smile or a brief whisper ere she settled down into the\r\nordinary church decorum.\r\n\r\nHiram all the while would not move a muscle. He never cast his eyes\r\naround the congregation--he never looked any where except at the\r\nclergyman, to whom he paid profound attention. When the services were\r\nover, he escorted Mrs. Hawkins back to her house, while the young ladies\r\nsometimes stopped to say a few words to their companions.\r\n\r\nIn a fortnight Hiram had taken a class in the Sunday-school, of which\r\nMr. Burns was superintendent, and on the next communion Sabbath he\r\njoined the church by letter.\r\n\r\nFor some time Hiram confined himself in the office to following\r\nimplicitly the instructions of Mr. Burns, without venturing to ask any\r\nquestions or make any suggestions. He carried out these instructions to\r\nthe letter. He wrote a beautiful hand. He was, as the reader knows, an\r\nadmirable accountant. For several days Mr. Burns seemed disposed to\r\nascertain his capabilities by putting a variety of matters into his\r\nhands. He gave him a contract to copy, and then asked for an abstract of\r\nit. He submitted several long accounts to him for arrangement. He sent\r\nhim to the mill or factory, sometimes to deliver a message simply,\r\nsometimes to look after a matter of consequence. Mr. Burns found Hiram\r\non all these occasions to be intelligent, accurate, and prompt. He\r\ninvariably manifested this single characteristic, to wit, undivided\r\nattention to the matter in hand.\r\n\r\n'He is an invaluable fellow, I declare,' said Mr. Burns to himself; 'I\r\nwish I could feel differently toward him. Strange how a first prejudice\r\nwill stick to one!'\r\n\r\n'I think I am gaining ground,' soliloquized Hiram. 'Let him try me--the\r\nmore the better. I shall do him good in spite of himself.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring this period, which we may term Hiram's novitiate, he had been\r\ncareful, without appearing to avoid her, not to come in contact with\r\nSarah Burns. Mr. Burns was a very hospitable man, but he had omitted to\r\nask Hiram to visit him. The latter was not slow to perceive and\r\nappreciate the neglect. He did not mind it much, though. He had gained\r\nhis position, and felt he could take care of himself.\r\n\r\nMeantime Sarah frequently inquired of her father how he liked his new\r\nclerk. At first, as we have stated, she felt jealous that any one should\r\nshare his business confidences with her, but soon she resigned herself\r\nto this, and learning who was to enter her father's service, she hoped\r\nthat she would find an agreeable acquaintance in the young man with\r\nwhom--if the truth be told--she was really much pleased when they met at\r\nMrs. Crofts'. We have already described the wrath of young Meeker at\r\nreceiving, as he supposed, the cut direct from Sarah Burns the first day\r\nhe visited the place. Sarah, entirely unconscious of having given\r\noffense, began to wonder how it happened that she never encountered him\r\non any occasion. They attended the same church, each had a class in the\r\nSunday-school, they met in the lecture-room, but never where an\r\nopportunity was afforded for them to speak. At last, one Sunday, after\r\nhe had finished with his class, Hiram started to go to the library to\r\nprocure some books for his pupils, and perceived, when it was too late,\r\nthat Miss Burns herself was making choice of some. Another moment, and\r\nHiram was close at her side, but intent on his selections.\r\n\r\n'He is diffident,' said Sarah to herself, 'and thinks I do not recognize\r\nhim because I did not when we met so unexpectedly. It is proper I should\r\nspeak to him.'\r\n\r\n'How do you do, Mr. Meeker?' she said.\r\n\r\nHiram looked up with well-feigned surprise.\r\n\r\n'Very well, I thank you,' he replied, with polite formality; 'I hope you\r\nare quite well;' and barely waiting for her bow of assent, he busied\r\nhimself with the books again.\r\n\r\n'How he _has_ altered! What can be the matter with him?' thought Sarah\r\nas she turned to resume her place.\r\n\r\n'Pretty well for encounter Number two,' muttered Hiram, as he walked\r\nback to his class. 'Wait a little, young lady, and we will see who comes\r\noff second best.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLouisa and Charlotte Hawkins were both very pretty girls. Their mother,\r\nnow several years a widow, was an estimable lady, who had by no means\r\nlost her good looks. Possessing excellent health, she made a very\r\nyouthful appearance, and seemed more like an elder sister than the\r\nmother of her daughters. Her husband left her a moderate income, which\r\nan unforeseen occurrence had the last season diminished. It was this\r\ncircumstance which induced her to listen to Hiram's application to\r\nbecome a member of her family. His recommendations were so ample, what\r\nMr. Burns said about him was so satisfactory, and the price which Hiram\r\nvolunteered to pay for his accommodations so generous, that Mrs. Hawkins\r\nfound it impossible to refuse him. I will not say that Hiram's manner\r\nand address did not serve to turn the scale. The widow was gratified\r\nwith the extraordinary deference paid to her, with which was mingled a\r\nspecies of admiration, while the young ladies, who were of course\r\nbrought into the consultation, were somehow severally impressed with the\r\nidea that Hiram must be perfectly charming in a private _tête-à-tête_\r\nwith mamma and sister out of the room.\r\n\r\nHiram's plan with the ladies was literally to divide and conquer. Mrs.\r\nHawkins had too much good sense to take matters seriously, but she could\r\nnot help being flattered by the assiduous and persevering attentions of\r\nso young and handsome a fellow. In fact, she looked five years younger\r\nherself, after Hiram came to her house. These attentions, however, were\r\nnot out of the common course. They were apparently just what it was\r\neminently proper and polite to render; but we have already explained\r\nthat Hiram had a delicate and most insinuating way of giving force and\r\nmeaning to them.\r\n\r\nAh! well, after all, we would not intimate that the widow Hawkins, now\r\nforty years of age, ever entertained any other thought toward Hiram than\r\nthat he would make a most delightful son-in-law, or if she did\r\nexperience feelings which people take for granted belong only to the\r\nyoung, (people are much mistaken,) it is not for me to betray or expose\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut the young ladies, Miss Louisa and Miss Charlotte--here was a more\r\ndifficult task, to render equal justice to each. Candidly, however, I\r\nthink Hiram accomplished it. Louisa was already one-and-twenty, but she\r\nhad glossy dark hair which she wore in curls down her neck, and served\r\nto give her a very youthful appearance. Charlotte, who was nearly two\r\nyears younger than her sister, was always taken by strangers to be the\r\neldest. She was a blonde, and wore her light brown hair plain over her\r\nface. Both these young ladies soon had their private impression that\r\nthere were peculiar confidences between them and Hiram. It was the old\r\nstory again. Our hero had lost none of his powers of fascination in\r\nremoving from Hampton to Burnsville.\r\n\r\nYou see, reader, how pleasantly Hiram was quartered. I do not suppose\r\nthat a thought of Mary Jessup ever entered his brain (to say nothing of\r\nhis heart, if he had any) after he came to Mrs. Hawkins's. He attended\r\nto his business devotedly, and never in a single instance sacrificed it\r\nto his pleasure, his comfort, or his inclinations. When it was finished,\r\nhe found solace and enjoyment in the society of these ladies, much as he\r\nwould enjoy his dinner, though in a higher degree, and with a keener\r\nzest.\r\n\r\nAfter the meeting with Miss Burns at the Sunday-school, Hiram no longer\r\navoided her. Still, he confined himself to courteous salutations, in\r\nwhich he appeared perfectly at his ease, and unrestrained, without\r\ngetting into conversation or alluding to a previous acquaintance. But\r\npray, understand, if Sarah Burns had had the slightest idea that Hiram's\r\ncourse was premeditated, she would have cut his acquaintance instanter,\r\nfor she was a girl of spirit, with a vein of her father's impetuosity of\r\ncharacter. As it was, she imagined every reason for Hiram's reserve but\r\nthe right one, and so was anxious he should do away with it. To this end\r\nshe always returned his greeting in a manner calculated to give him\r\nconfidence if he were diffident, and courage if he were timid. It\r\nseemed to little purpose. 'What can be the matter with the fellow?' she\r\nsaid to herself. She was piqued; she was puzzled; she felt annoyed.\r\n\r\nYoung ladies must excuse me for letting the public into some of their\r\nsecrets, but as a faithful historian, I am forced to record precisely\r\nhow Sarah Burns felt, as well as just what she did during the early part\r\nof her acquaintance with my hero--an acquaintance which led, as the\r\nreader may remember, to an engagement of marriage.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Hiram began to gain in Mr. Burns's regard. He soon discovered\r\nhow very capable his new clerk was. He certainly had never had any such\r\nperson in his employment before. He found himself by degrees leaving\r\nmany things for Hiram to attend to which he supposed no one but himself\r\nwas capable of transacting. In such cases he was astonished with what\r\nfacility Hiram performed the work; how apt and ready he was. What a\r\ncomfort for a man with as much on his hands as Mr. Burns, to have such a\r\nperson near him!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet, somehow, with all his readiness, and capability, and actual value\r\nto his employer, he was _not_ a comfort to him. Despite all, Hiram's\r\npresence cast a shadow across the _soul_ of Mr. Burns. While he approved\r\nof every thing he did, while he appreciated his extraordinary business\r\nabilities, while he could not but feel satisfied and pleased with his\r\ncompetency, his assiduity, and his untiring devotion, the quick,\r\nsensitive nature of this truthful, genuine man felt magnetically the\r\nmalign force working in the brain of the subtle and calculating schemer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was remarked after a while about the village, that Hiram never\r\nvisited. It was soon understood though, what a moral, pious youth he\r\nwas. The Rev. Mr. Baker said he never conversed with a young person\r\nwhose religious experience was so interesting, and who manifested such\r\nimplicit trust in Providence.\r\n\r\nHiram was quick-witted enough to perceive that his situation with Mr.\r\nBurns was enough of itself to give him a prominent position in the\r\nvillage. The girls were crazy to be introduced to him, and one young\r\nlady who had hitherto held out against it, took a class in Sunday-school\r\nso as to make young Meeker's acquaintance at the meetings of the\r\nteachers. I have said Hiram never visited; I will tell you why. So long\r\nas he made _no_ visits, it would not appear singular that he did not\r\ncall at Mr. Burns's, otherwise his omission to do so would certainly\r\nattract attention. True, Hiram did not, perhaps, require an invitation\r\nto justify his going to see Miss Burns, but he resolved he would not go\r\nwithout one. He was careful, however, that not a soul should know he\r\nfelt slighted, and this led him to spend his time at home, and devote\r\nhimself to the widow Hawkins and her daughters. It is true he rapidly\r\nmade the acquaintance of the whole church. Some very pleasant seasons he\r\nenjoyed with the young ladies at the various gatherings connected with\r\nit. He was rallied on his being so much of a recluse. Arch hints were\r\nconveyed that doubtless his home was specially agreeable. Was it Louisa\r\nor Charlotte? Both these young ladies would simper and look conscious\r\nwhen they were attacked on the subject; for both candidly believed they\r\nwere liable to the innuendoes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus matters went on during the first six months of Hiram's career at\r\nBurnsville. In that time he managed to make himself fully acquainted\r\nwith Mr. Burns's affairs. In fact, he knew more about them with\r\nreference to value and availability than did Mr. Burns himself. For with\r\nthe latter life possessed higher objects than the mere acquisition of\r\nproperty; while with Hiram it was _the_ great earthly good, and not a\r\nthought or a fancy entered his brain which did not have reference to it.\r\nWe can see how very useful such a person would be to Mr. Burns. Indeed,\r\nafter a while he found himself listening to occasional suggestions\r\nwhich Hiram modestly put forth about this or that matter.\r\n\r\nThe liberal terms allowed to every one in his service was a matter of\r\ngreat annoyance to the confidential clerk. But here he touched a vital\r\nprinciple in Mr. Burns's course of action, which was, to regard all who\r\nserved him as entitled to share according to their usefulness in the\r\nbenefits of the business or enterprise in which they were engaged. The\r\nresult was, that their wages or salaries were on a generous scale. A\r\nfurther result appeared in the pleasing aspect of the village,\r\nbetokening a more diffused prosperity than is ordinarily observed.\r\n\r\nNow, Hiram had early mastered the doctrine of making the many contribute\r\nto the success and fortunes of the few. It had already become one of his\r\ncardinal ideas. The reader will recollect that about the first thing\r\nwhich impressed our hero on coming to Burnsville, was the fact that Mr.\r\nBurns was not as rich as he ought to be considering the facilities he\r\nhad to make money. Here was a point beyond Hiram Meeker's comprehension.\r\nTurn it whichever way he would, he failed to understand Mr. Burns in\r\nthis. You see, Hiram could have no more idea of his employer's large and\r\nhumanizing views than a blind man of colors. He could not attribute it\r\nto lack of sagacity, for he saw such abundant proofs as compelled his\r\nadmiration and respect. It did not appear to grow out of any strict\r\nreligious theories, for Mr. Burns held mere professions in such low\r\nesteem that he never _spoke_ of an act or of a course as dictated or\r\nregulated by a sense of duty, so called. Since his wife died, he had\r\ntried to obey her dying injunction, 'to live right,' which he soon\r\ndiscovered had reference to the state of his heart, and thus to his\r\nmotives, while his actions were such as would naturally flow from such a\r\ncondition of the 'inner man.' Hiram, on the other hand, practiced on the\r\nphilosophical principle of 'means to ends.' He had two ends in view,\r\nnamely: To be SUCCESSFUL here, and to be SUCCESSFUL hereafter. He was\r\ndetermined to omit nothing which could further these ends. But since\r\nthese (as we have before stated) had no reference to or connection with\r\nany thing except _self_, the reader will readily see how Hiram failed to\r\nunderstand Mr. Burns.\r\n\r\nOn other points there was no difficulty. And on his part, Mr. Burns\r\ncould not help being struck with the clear, rapid, comprehensive\r\nbusiness mind of the young man. Despite his prejudices, Hiram advanced\r\ndaily in his confidence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was one matter, and that an important one, in Mr. Burns's affairs\r\nwhich was going wrong. I refer to the paper-mill. Mr. Burns had\r\nundertaken the enterprise in connection with an excellent man, an old\r\nfriend and an extensive paper-dealer, residing in New-York. Each\r\nfurnished half the capital for the erection of the mill and for the\r\nmachinery, and they were, therefore, joint owners of the property. The\r\nseason after it went into operation, his friend failed and felt himself\r\nobliged, without having time to consult Mr. Burns, to convey his portion\r\nof the mill to a Mr. Joslin--Mr. Elihu Joslin, one of the largest\r\npaper-merchants in the city, to whom he owed a heavy confidential debt.\r\nThis Joslin was a very rich man and also very unscrupulous--such was his\r\nreputation with the trade. Not a few thought he was the means of forcing\r\nhis brother-merchant into bankruptcy, having first lent him considerable\r\nsums of money on a pledge that it should be considered confidential in\r\nany event. In this way Elihu Joslin came to be owner of one half the\r\npaper-mill with Joel Burns. At the first interview every thing passed\r\npleasantly between the two. Joslin was planning how to get the other in\r\nhis power, and so finally possess the whole of the property. It was\r\narranged, as was very proper, that Mr. Joslin should act as merchant for\r\nthe mill, as his predecessor had done. He was to purchase and forward\r\nrags of which to manufacture paper, and should receive on consignment\r\nall paper produced at the mill. He sounded Mr. Burns on his own wants\r\nfor money, and was disappointed to find him in no need whatever. On the\r\nrendering of the first accounts, Mr. Burns was much chagrined at the\r\nstate of things which they discovered. True, every thing was correct on\r\npaper. Rags were entered at the market price; consignments when sold\r\nwere properly credited. But there were charges for all sorts of\r\ncommissions, for accepting, and paying, and accepting again, because\r\npaper remained unsold, and for a variety of things hitherto unheard of\r\nin ordinary dealings, and which the previous correspondent of Mr. Burns\r\nhad never made, which were positively startling. Mr. Burns remonstrated\r\nby letter. It did not do the least good. He was dealing with a bold,\r\ndaring, unscrupulous man, who, in the language of his acquaintances,\r\nalways practiced the grab-game.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns finally made the best settlement of the account in his power,\r\ndetermining, before another six months should pass, that he would make a\r\nchange of some sort. Unfortunately, he was at that time rather short of\r\nmoney, for he was expending considerable sums in other enterprises, and\r\nsupposed the paper-mill could not fail of taking care of itself. So he\r\ncontinued to send forward to Mr. Joslin the consignments of paper, and\r\nto draw on him as usual. The next rendering of accounts showed affairs\r\nin a sad plight. Paper was very dull, so Joslin wrote. The lots sent\r\nforward were not as good as usual, (which was a falsehood,) so that much\r\nthat had been sold was returned to him, (another lie,) and he had been\r\nforced to sell the most of it at auction to cover his advances, and the\r\nlast cargo of rags still remained unpaid.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns was thunderstruck. He saw at once that he had fallen into the\r\nhands of a knave; but what was to be done? The idea of going to New-York\r\nto obtain satisfaction and thus encounter the scoundrel on his own\r\nground was not pleasant; but what else could be done? He decided, after\r\nsome reflection, as he could not just then leave the place, to send the\r\nsuperintendent of the mill to Mr. Joslin for the purpose of\r\ninvestigating the account, and all the circumstances connected with the\r\nbusiness. He prepared a strong letter to Joslin, in which he spoke with\r\ngreat severity of the course pursued by that individual.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Hiram was taken into the consultation. He begged Mr.\r\nBurns to write no letter, but to send any message he chose. 'The man\r\nwill accomplish nothing,' he rather curtly added, 'still, it is well\r\nenough to send him.' Mr. Burns thought Hiram's suggestion a prudent one,\r\nso the head man of the paper-mill was dispatched with his instructions.\r\nHe returned in three days very well satisfied with his journey. He had\r\nbeen received by Mr. Elihu Joslin with the utmost politeness. He\r\nexpressed entire willingness to go over the account and correct any\r\nmistakes in it. Indeed, he had succeeded in convincing Mr. Joslin of one\r\nerror of thirty-one dollars and twenty-six cents, which the latter at\r\nonce made right. As to the main points at issue, however, Mr. Joslin\r\ncould not alter the amount. There were the advances, here the sales,\r\nthere the charges, here the credits. As to the commissions for buying,\r\nfor selling, and guaranteeing, and for accepting, why, let him consult\r\nthe very first houses in the city, the _very_ first. He would leave it\r\nto Mr. Burns to select the house, and abide by its decision.\r\n\r\nThe man came back to Burnsville completely bamboozled. Hiram was present\r\nin Mr. Burns's office when this report was made. Mr. Burns received it\r\nin silence. He saw at once how his messenger had been over-reached.\r\n\r\nWhen the latter left the office he turned toward Hiram and said:\r\n\r\n'This is an unfortunate business.'\r\n\r\n'I want to ask an especial favor of you,' said Hiram.\r\n\r\n'What is it?'\r\n\r\n'I want you to permit me to go to New-York and try what I can do.'\r\n\r\n'Have you any plan?'\r\n\r\n'I can not say I have. It would depend on circumstances.'\r\n\r\n'Have you confidence in achieving something?'\r\n\r\n'I have sufficient to induce me to wish to make the attempt.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you shall go.'\r\n\r\n'I would like to start to-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'Very well; come to my house after tea and we will look over the\r\npapers.'\r\n\r\n'I am much obliged to you, sir.'\r\n\r\nMr. Burns started to leave the office; he opened the door and was half\r\nout; then he turned.\r\n\r\n'By the way, Meeker, come and take tea with me; we will then be ready to\r\ngo at once into the accounts.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, sir.'\r\n\r\nThe door closed and Hiram was left alone. What a moment of triumph, as\r\nhe regarded it!\r\n\r\n'_Invited_ to the house at last! I knew I should fetch it. Let us see\r\n... very good.... Now, young lady....'\r\n\r\nThe murmurings finally became inaudible as Hiram rose and walked up and\r\ndown the room, stopping occasionally, and then starting rapidly on.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns proceeded homeward, quite unconscious of the excitement he had\r\nraised in Hiram's breast. Always considerate and just, it occurred to\r\nhim since he had requested the young man to come to his house on\r\nbusiness, thus breaking over his usual rule, that he ought to ask him to\r\ntea, and accordingly he did so. He announced the fact to Sarah as he\r\nentered the house. He was too much preöccupied to observe a slight flush\r\nrise to her cheeks as he spoke. She, however, only replied:\r\n\r\n'Any thing unusual, father?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; Stevens has returned from New-York, accomplishing nothing. I am\r\ngoing to send Meeker. We are to look over matters this evening.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, Do you think he can do better than Stevens?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I think so. Besides, he wants to go. He volunteered to go.'\r\n\r\n'Is it possible?'\r\n\r\n'Why not, my child?'\r\n\r\n'I am sure I don't know; it seems strange.'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps it does; but I confess I have a great deal of confidence that\r\nhe will bring something about.'\r\n\r\nThat evening the appearance of the table was slightly changed--not\r\nenough to attract Mr. Burns's attention, but there was a greater display\r\nof silver than usual, and a nicer regard to arrangement. The same might\r\nbe said of Sarah herself. The casual observer would not notice it, one\r\nof her own sex would.\r\n\r\nOne minute past the appointed time master Hiram arrived, direct from the\r\noffice, where he had been so immersed in accounts, head and hands so\r\nfull of business, as almost to forget the tea-hour.\r\n\r\nYes, he came direct from the office. But previously he had stepped to\r\nhis room, and without 'dressing up,' or apparently disturbing the usual\r\narrangement of his wardrobe, managed to make himself especially\r\npresentable. In short, he had done just what Sarah Burns had done.\r\n\r\nI wish you could have witnessed the meeting between them. You would have\r\nthought Hiram in the habit of going all his life to the house, instead\r\nof entering it for the first time. No forwardness, though, no\r\nassumption, yet entire freedom from awkwardness or embarrassment.\r\n\r\nSarah, on her part, received him with a pleasant lady-like greeting,\r\nquite unconscious, as we have already intimated, of having given Hiram\r\nany cause of offense.\r\n\r\nVarious topics were discussed: the condition of the Sunday-school, the\r\nhealth of the clergyman, the high water at Slab City, the lecture of the\r\ncelebrated Charles Benjamin Bruce, the prospects of the Lyceum, the new\r\ntown-hall.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns said but little. It was very unusual to see him engrossed with\r\nany business matter to the exclusion of social enjoyments. _Was_ he\r\nthinking of business altogether? Occasionally and unconsciously his eye\r\nwould glance from his daughter to Hiram and then back again. Little did\r\nhe know, little could he guess what was passing in that crafty, scheming\r\nbrain--else....\r\n\r\nMr. Burns was called out for a few moments just as tea was concluded.\r\n\r\n'So,' exclaimed Sarah suddenly, 'you are going to New-York?'\r\n\r\n'How do you know that?' returned Hiram.\r\n\r\n'How do I know it? Are you not aware that I know _every thing_ going on?\r\nI was very jealous of you at first.'\r\n\r\n'Of me?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, for depriving me of my situation.'\r\n\r\n'You speak in riddles.'\r\n\r\n'Did you not know _I_ was father's 'confidential clerk' before you cut\r\nme out?'\r\n\r\n'Indeed I did not. If I had, I should never have presumed to offer my\r\nservices.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose it was well you did. Some time I will tell you what I used to\r\ndo. But father talks to me about every thing just as ever. Oh! I hope\r\nyou _can_ do something with that Mr. Joslin. Do you think you can?'\r\n\r\n'I hope so; I shall try, and--(he hesitated, looked down, and\r\nblushed--consummate actor that he was)--'and all the harder now that I\r\nfind _you_ take such an interest in it.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! thank you,' replied Sarah.\r\n\r\n[There was the slightest perceptible hauteur in her tone, and the\r\nslightest perceptible drawing in from her previous pleasant, free\r\nmanner--only the slightest.]\r\n\r\n'For,' continued Hiram, lifting his eyes and looking at her boldly, as\r\nif not noticing the remark, 'if you take so much interest in my mission,\r\nyou will be forced to feel some sort of interest in me.'\r\n\r\n'If you _succeed_, why, I will say yes,' replied Sarah, with entire good\r\nhumor. 'If you do not--'\r\n\r\n'I accept the alternative,' interrupted Hiram, 'but do not forget your\r\npledge.'\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Burns came in, and the two proceeded at once to business. He\r\ndid not see Sarah again.\r\n\r\nIt was at a late hour that Hiram left the house. With Mr. Burns's aid he\r\nhad mastered the whole subject, accounts and all. He was happy. Once as\r\nhe walked along he turned and cast his eyes up at the window. I do not\r\nlike to think of the look which flitted across his face. He nodded\r\nsignificantly, and went on his way.\r\n\r\nLouisa Hawkins opened the door for him the moment he put his foot on the\r\nstep.\r\n\r\n'Where _have_ you been?' she whispered, 'I was so frightened. I\r\npersuaded _them_ to go to bed. Did you think I would be waiting for\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'I was sure of it, Lily.'\r\n\r\n'You _were_, weren't you?'\r\n\r\nThey went in and sat half an hour in the parlor together. But Hiram gave\r\nher no inkling of where he passed the evening.\r\n\r\nThe next day our hero started for New-York. Of his adventures there, and\r\nthe result of his interview with Elihu Joslin, we will speak in another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Dark and Bloody Ground of yore,\r\n  Kentucky, thou art that once more.\r\n  But where is he who gave the name--\r\n  The Indian? Lost like meteor's flame!\r\n  Gone, as the bandits soon shall be,\r\n  Who brought the name again to thee!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES\r\n\r\n\r\n     LIFE AND LETTERS OF WASHINGTON IRVING. By Pierre Irving. Vol. II.\r\n     New-York: G. P. Putnam. Boston: A. K. Loring. 1862.\r\n\r\nWe have perused this second volume of 'Irving's Life and Letters' with\r\neven greater relish than the first, and return sincere thanks to its\r\neditor for the zeal and skill shown in his work. Such compilations, when\r\nnot _very_ well done, are proverbially dull; it is therefore the highest\r\ncompliment which we can pay to say that the work thus far is extremely\r\ninteresting. We have in it, as in the brilliant memoir of some great man\r\nof the world, constantly recurring glimpses of world-wide celebrities,\r\npictures of travel, bits of gossip of people in whom every body is\r\ninterested, the whole interwoven with the kindliest and most genial\r\ntraits of character. If Irving's works are essential to every library,\r\nit may be said with equal truth that the 'Life and Letters' are quite as\r\ninseparable from the works themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n     BAYARD TAYLOR'S WORKS. NORTHERN TRAVEL. New-York: G. P. Putnam.\r\n     Boston: A. K. Loring.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years the tide of English and of American travel has flown\r\nfar more than of old over Scandinavia, a land so little known as to bear\r\na prestige of strange mystery to many. Books of travel describing it are\r\ncomparatively rare; it has not, like Germany or England, been 'done to\r\ndeath,' and the consequence is, that a good book describing it, like\r\nthis of Taylor's, has a peculiar charm of freshness and of novelty. In\r\nit, as in every volume of his travels, Bayard Taylor gives us the\r\nimpression that the country in question is his specialty and favorite,\r\nthe result being a thoroughly genial account of all he saw. Readers not\r\nfamiliar with this series may be pleased to know that as regards\r\ntypography, illustration, and binding, it is in all respects elegant,\r\nthough furnished at an extremely moderate price.\r\n\r\n\r\n     EDWIN BROTHERTOFT. By Theodore Winthrop. Boston: Ticknor & Fields.\r\n     1862.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent novels are like dishes; while there is no dispute as\r\nto the surpassing excellence of a few, the majority are prized\r\ndifferently, according to individual tastes. Public opinion has\r\nunanimously rated the Winthrop novels highly, some readers preferring\r\n'Cecil Dreeme,' while to judge by the press, it would seem that 'Edwin\r\nBrothertoft' best pleases the majority. It is certainly a book of marked\r\ncharacter, and full of good local historical color. The author had one\r\ngreat merit--he studied from _life_ and truth, and did not rehash what\r\nhe had read in other novels, as do the majority of story-tellers at the\r\npresent day, when a romance which is _not_ crammed with palpable apings\r\nof 'Jane Eyre' and 'Adam Bede' is becoming a rarity. In 'Edwin\r\nBrothertoft' we have a single incident--as in 'John Brent'--the rescue\r\nof a captive damsel by a dashing 'raid,' as the nucleus, around which\r\nare deftly woven in many incidents, characters, and scenes, all well set\r\nforth in the vigorous style of a young writer who was deeply interested\r\nin his own work. That he is sometimes rather weakly grotesque, as in his\r\nsporting with the negro dialect, which in the person of a servant he\r\naffects to discard and yet resumes, is a trifle. That he shows\r\nthroughout the noblest sympathies and instincts of a gentleman, a\r\nphilanthropist, and a cosmopolite is, however, something which can not\r\nbe too highly praised, since it is these indications which lend a grace\r\nand a glory to all that Winthrop wrote. _Noblesse oblige_ seems to have\r\nbeen the great consciousness of his nature, and he therefore presented\r\nin his life and writings that high type of a gentleman by birth and\r\nculture, who without lowering himself one whit, was a reformer, a\r\nprogressive, yes, a 'radical' in all things where he conceived that the\r\nroot to be extracted was a great truth.\r\n\r\nIn many things 'Edwin Brothertoft' is most appropriate to these our\r\ntimes, since its scenes are laid in that Revolutionary War for the cause\r\nof freedom, of which this of the present day is, in fact, a repetition.\r\nWe feel in its every page the anxiety and interest of war, an American\r\nwar for the right, sweeping along through trials and sorrows. To\r\ncharacterize it in few words, we may say that in it the author reminds\r\nus of Cooper, but displays more genius and _life_ than Cooper ever did.\r\n\r\n\r\n     OUT OF HIS HEAD. By T. B. Aldrich. New-York. Carleton.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the 'grotesque' romance is going out of fashion; if this\r\nbe so, the beautiful and quaint collection of interwoven fancies before\r\nus proves that in literature as in horticulture, the best blooms of\r\ncertain species are of the latest. Strange, indeed, is the conception of\r\nthis work--the fancied biography of one literally 'out of his head,' who\r\nimagines himself surrounded by a world of people who act very\r\nsingularly. Madmen are never ordinary; therefore the writer has not,\r\nwhile setting forth the most extraordinary fancies, once transgressed\r\nthe limits of the probable. This was a bold stroke of genius in the very\r\ninception, and it is developed with a subtle tact which can hardly fail\r\nto claim the cordial admiration of the most carping critic. It is true\r\nthat in using the strange aberrations of a lunatic as material for\r\nromance, Aldrich has provoked comparison with some of the world's\r\ngreatest writers; and it is to his credit that he has met them evenly,\r\nand that too without in any particular incurring the charge of\r\nplagiarism. But had the _thema_ of the work been less ingenious or\r\nstriking, its defects would have been unnoticed among the beautiful\r\npictures, the unconscious breathings of poetry, and the sweet caprices\r\nwhich twine around the strange plot, as the tendrils and leaves of the\r\nvine cover over, yet indicate by their course the fantastic twinings of\r\nthe parent vine. It is needless to say, that we commend this most\r\nagreeable work to our readers. We are glad to see that 'Père Antoine's\r\nDate Palm' which has attained so great a popularity, and several other\r\nfascinating tales by Aldrich, are incorporated into the present volume\r\nas the 'library' of the hero.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LES MISERABLES. III. Marius. By Victor Hugo. New-York: Carleton.\r\n\r\n'Sure an' didn't I tell ye I was a _poor_ scholar,' said the young Irish\r\nsham-student-beggar to the gentleman who refused him alms because he\r\ncould not read. In the same strain, as it seems to us, Victor Hugo might\r\nreply to the wearied readers of these tales: 'Why, do they not call\r\nthemselves miserable?' Miserable indeed is the 'Marius' installment now\r\nbefore us--a mere sensation plot, brilliantly patched here and there\r\nwith the _purpureus pannus_, or purple rag of a bit of imperial or later\r\nhistory, 'coached' up for display, but falling lamentably into what\r\nunder any other name would be called a gross imitation of Eugène Sue.\r\nThe point of the present volume, to which its scenes tend, is, of\r\ncourse, a robber's den--a decoyed victim--the police in waiting, and a\r\ntremendous leap from a window--the whole suggesting Mr. Bourcicault's\r\nmoral sensational drama, or rather its French originals, to an amusing\r\nextent. Still the _genius_ of the author, always erratic, of course, is\r\nshown in more than one chapter. The trials and sufferings of 'Marius,'\r\nand his noble independence of character, as well as the peculiar and\r\nwidely differing traits of his friends the students are set forth with\r\ngreat spirit, and with the intention of a good purpose. Victor Hugo is\r\nin all his works unequal unless we except 'Hans of Iceland,' which is\r\ncompletely trashy throughout; but he was never more so than in 'The\r\nMiserables.' We have spoken of this third part as though its first title\r\nwere an illustration of the _nomen et omen_ so much believed in of old.\r\nWe may add that like the _Mois_ of Alexandre Dumas, it has simply an _s_\r\ntoo much,\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE FLY-ING DUTCHMAN. By John Q. Saxe. Illustrated. New-York:\r\n     Carleton. 1862.\r\n\r\nAn amusing little series of pictures, drawn and written, setting forth\r\nthe accidents which befell a 'Dutchman' in catching a fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE POEMS OF ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH. With a Memoir. By Charles Eliot\r\n     Norton. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1862.\r\n\r\nArthur Hugh Clough was an English gentleman of high university education\r\nand honors, and gifted with liberal and progressive views in politics,\r\nwho, after distinguishing himself somewhat in his native land, resided\r\nfor one year in this country as an instructor at Cambridge, Mass. On\r\nreturning to England to take a place in the Education Department of the\r\nPrivy Council, he wrote: 'I am rather unwilling to be re-Englished after\r\nonce attaining that higher transatlantic development. However, _il faut\r\ns'y soumettre_, I presume, though I fear I am embarked in the foundering\r\nship. I hope to heaven you'll get rid of slavery, and then I shouldn't\r\nfear but you would really 'go ahead' in the long run. As for us and our\r\ninveterate feudalism, it is not hopeful.'\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that an English poet with such feelings must be,\r\nif not vigorous, liberal, and original, at least ambitious of becoming\r\nsuch, and this Clough is. A vigorous naturalism, such as is becoming\r\nhalf the religion and all the art of the scholars and thinkers of the\r\npresent day, inspires every page. Truthful yet picturesque, he is more\r\nthan pleasant to read, he is good _to think_, and most relishing to\r\n_feel_ with. Had he been a meaner mind, he would have been a mere Adam\r\nBede-ish pre-Raffaelite in word-painting--'the Bothie of\r\nTaber-na-vuolich,' the first poem in this volume is often photographic\r\nin its rural views, as well as in its characters. As it is, literal\r\nnature is to him material for fresh brave thought. Through all his\r\npoems, owing to this simple vigorous truth, and an innate sense of\r\nrefinement, he rises head and shoulders above the 'sweet-pretty' Miss\r\nNancy Coventry Patmores or spasmodic Alexander Smiths or other\r\ncotemporary English stuff of later poetry.\r\n\r\nEngland has of late years deluged and wearied us so much with thousand\r\ntimes told tales of herself and her social life, and her writers have\r\nrun so _exceedingly_ in ruts, that there are few really thinking men in\r\nAmerica who have not begun to tire woefully of her endless novels and\r\nworn-out poetry. We could write against the whole '_connu, connu_,' and\r\nat the end a 'deliver us'--from evil it might be, certainly from no\r\ngreat temptation. Let the world believe it--it _will_ some day--English\r\n_thought_ is at present exhausted, stagnant, and imitative. It is cursed\r\nwith mannerism, even as the Chinese are cursed, and every honest man of\r\nmind knows it. In such a state of national art it is cheerful to open a\r\nvolume like these poems, in which one hears, as it were, the first\r\nlark-notes of an early dawn and sees from afar a few gleams of morning\r\nred. It is not the full light nor the great poetry which reforms and\r\nawakes nations, but it is the forerunner in many things of such, and\r\nwill be read with great pleasure by those who long for some faint\r\nrealization of the great Nature-Art of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident enough that all questions between North and South must\r\nsettle themselves, should the war only _go far enough_. When it comes to\r\nthe struggle for life; to the last most desperate effort on either side\r\nfor political and personal existence, then people will begin to open\r\ntheir eyes to the fact that the one who conquers must conquer\r\neffectually, and hold the vanquished at utter will. Very few among us\r\nhave as yet realized this extreme case as the nations of the Old World\r\nhave done a thousand times. We who lived at home, have, looking at the\r\nlate wars of Europe, imagined that 'the army' might beat or be beaten,\r\nbut that 'the country' and the mass of its in-dwellers would remain\r\nunharmed. We have not seen cities captured, farms laid waste, and\r\nexperienced the horrors of war. When it comes to that, the case becomes\r\ndesperate, and nothing is left at last but unconditional victory or\r\ndefeat. Had we done so, we should have 'gone to extremes.'\r\n\r\nThe South has begun the war, dared its terrors, encountered them, and\r\nbecome desperate. It is win or lose with them. We too, with every loss\r\ngather fresh strength. Ere long we shall probably have every man in the\r\nFederal Union capable of bearing arms summoned to the field, and that\r\nless by Executive command than by an individual sense of duty, _or\r\ndread_. Our people have learned very slowly indeed what disasters may\r\nbefall them in case of defeat, but they are gradually coming to the\r\nknowledge, and are displaying a rapidly advancing energy of interest and\r\nof action. They have immediate and terrible disasters from hostile\r\narmies to repel, and they have to apprehend in the future such a picture\r\nof ruin and disorganization as the result of secession as no one can\r\nbear to contemplate. We are coming to it, and may as well make up our\r\nminds at once to the fact that it is to be a Southern rule in the North\r\nor 'Northern' rule over the South--if we may call that 'Northern' which\r\nmeans simply the principles of the Constitution as applied to all\r\nStates, and of justice as recognized by all nations. He must be blind\r\nwho can not see that it is to this extreme stage of war to the knife\r\nthat we are rapidly advancing, and that its result is far more likely to\r\nbe complete conquest than reconciliation.\r\n\r\nThe nations of Europe are waiting for the crisis of the fever to be\r\npassed before they intervene. The sympathy of England is in great\r\nmeasure with the South; yet England may well doubt the expediency of any\r\npartial interference. This tremendous North can yet send forth another\r\nmillion if needs must be, and still leave those who with tears in their\r\neyes and stern resolve in their hearts would plant and weave and work to\r\nsustain the soldiers a-field. When it comes to this death-struggle--when\r\nwe begin to live in the war and for the war alone--where can the foe be?\r\nThey have long since sunk in great measure from the social condition of\r\npeace into that olden-time state of full war, when as in Sparta, or\r\nRome, in her early days all things in life were done solely with\r\nreference to maintaining the army. With us it has been--is as yet--very\r\ndifferent. The voice of the highly-paid opera-singer is still heard in\r\nour large cities--Newport and Saratoga never saw gayer seasons than\r\nthose of 1862--splendor and luxury are still the life of thousands, and\r\neven yet there exists in the North a large political party who are so\r\nfar from feeling that there is any desperation involved as to still\r\ndally and coquet with the political principles of the enemy, and talk\r\nlargely of compromise. When it comes to the bitter end, those trivial,\r\nsuperficial, temporary men will, we believe, in most cases, be changed\r\ninto good citizens, for necessity is a hard master.\r\n\r\nFor surely as we live it is approaching; the terrible struggle of rule\r\nor ruin, which so few have dared to anticipate. We have ever been so\r\nfree from tremendous crises of life and death that even with a war\r\ndevouring scores of thousands of our best men, very few have realized\r\nwhat we _must_ come to with a brave and desperate foe. Union victories\r\nmay defer such a struggle--and God grant that they have such\r\nresult!--but in case they do not, what hope remains for our foe? They\r\nhave fought well, they are willing to hang out the black flag; but what\r\nthen? They have not and can not establish a real _superiority_ of\r\nstrength, and yet have voluntarily forced upon a stronger opponent a war\r\nwhich must become deadly.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous enthusiasm which spread over the country on the last day\r\nof August, 1862, was after all only an awakening. The extraordinary\r\nvoluntary response to President Lincoln's calls for six hundred thousand\r\nmen was merely a beginning. The South, in proportion to its strength did\r\nas much long ago. But the ball is rolling on and the storm grows more\r\nterrible. We have great trials, probably, still before us, but let no\r\none despair. Out of our agony and our desperation _must_ come victory--a\r\ndire and terrible victory it may be for us all--but it will be\r\noverwhelming, and after that victory there will be left no strength in\r\nthe South to lift a hand.\r\n\r\nAnd in those days the different principles involved in this war will\r\nhave forced themselves so fiercely to a result that those who contended\r\nfor them will seem to have acted almost as vainly as those who were such\r\nchildren as to resist them. What will become of the Negro if the South\r\nstrives to the death, dragging the North down on and after it! What\r\nbecame of Serfdom during the Thirty Years' War and the other desperate\r\nand exhausting wars which followed it? What will become of Cotton if new\r\nmarkets are opened, as they must be? England has not realized, as we are\r\nbeginning to do, that there is not, can not, and will not be a time,\r\nwhen both combatants, mutually wearied, must let go. Men do not weary of\r\nwar; the new generation grows up fiercer than its fathers. The sooner\r\nEngland begins to plant her cotton in Jamaica, and Asia Minor and India,\r\nthe better it will be for her. Unless we gain some extraordinary Union\r\nvictories this autumn, there will be but little cotton planted next year\r\nin Dixie.\r\n\r\nWe are becoming too strong and fierce for intervention. These be the\r\ndays of iron-clads and of great armies. Before England and France engage\r\nin war with a desperate nation like ours, it will be well to think\r\ntwice. And we are not at the end yet.\r\n\r\nEvery man and woman in the North may as well, therefore, be warned\r\nbetimes, and give _all_ his and her aid to forwarding this war. It will\r\nnot avail to be feeble, or lukewarm, or indifferent, to wish it well and\r\ndo nothing, to give a little or dribble out mere kind wishes. Every\r\none's property is at stake, or will be, and the sooner we go to work in\r\nright earnest the better. Had we one year ago done what we are even now\r\ndoing--had we sprung up like a grizzly bear on a buffalo, and given it\r\nfor its insolent kick a sudden, tremendous blow, tearing through its\r\nvery heart, we should not have dragged out a year of doubt. It is our\r\ncurse that we are always 'just a little' behind the enemy in enthusiasm.\r\nIn due time we shall be in the struggle for life--the faster we advance,\r\nthe better it will be for us.\r\n\r\nOn and on and on! We are marching on, and will we, nill we, must conquer\r\nor perish.\r\n\r\n  'Ye mountains that see us descend to the shore\r\n  Must view us as victors or view us no more!'\r\n\r\nIt is written that North-America is to rise purified, regenerated, and\r\nperfectly free from the most tremendous and probably exhaustive struggle\r\nin history. Believe it, you who live in it--_premonitus,\r\npremunitus_--'forewarned is to be forearmed.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf President Lincoln were to call out _every_ man in the North capable\r\nof bearing arms--according to medical judgment--between the ages of\r\nsixteen and sixty, there would be less difficulty in assembling them\r\nthan in drafting a minority. If it were once realized that _all_ must\r\ngo, all _would_ go, and with rare exceptions, right cheerfully. It is\r\nnot so much the dread of battle and the trials of camp-life which keep\r\nmen back as the idea that there should be any exempt. Unless the six\r\nhundred thousand be speedily brought into the field, and unless when\r\nonce there, they secure us a speedy victory, the voice of the whole\r\ncountry will cry out for a general and unexcepted conscription.\r\n\r\nAnd if so--why, then, hurrah for it! Let us show Europe and history how\r\nfar a great nation can go for a great truth and for its rights. Why\r\nshould we not _all_ arise in tremendous power as whole races rose of\r\nold, and trample to the dust this insolent, slaveholding,\r\nliberty-defying foe to us and to the holiest rights of man? Such an\r\nuprising would be worthy of us--it would rank as the noblest deed of\r\nhistory--it would cast fresh lustre on the name, already great, of our\r\nnoble President--it would be unparalleled in grandeur, in daring, and in\r\nmajesty. Its very greatness would thrill the people and inspire them to\r\ndo each man his utmost. Hurrah for the onward march of the millions!\r\n\r\nWatch the times well, Father Abraham--and the instant that the time\r\ncomes, call for us _all_. _You_ are not afraid of great\r\nmeasures--neither are your people. What a thing it would be to have led\r\nsuch a movement--what a glory it would be for every man who marched in\r\nthe great uprising.\r\n\r\nLet us continue by singing:\r\n\r\n\r\n'TRELAWNEY.'\r\n\r\n  Shall Freedom droop and die\r\n  And we stand idle by,\r\n  When countless millions yet unborn\r\n  Will ask the reason why?\r\n\r\n  If for her flag on high,\r\n  You bravely fight and die,\r\n  Be sure that God on his great roll\r\n  Will mark the reason why.\r\n\r\n  But should you basely fly.\r\n  Scared by the battle-cry,\r\n  Then down through all eternity\r\n  You'll hear the reason why.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Great _Onion_ victory!' cried a little newsboy, lately, through the\r\nstreets of a certain village, wherein we were 'over-nighting,' as the\r\nGermans say. He had not well learned orthoëpy, and held that _u-n_, un,\r\nwas to be pronounced as in 'unctuous.' Still there are some droll sounds\r\nto be extracted from the word--witness the following song in which by a\r\nslight modulation of sound the word _Union_ is made a war-cry to\r\nadvance:\r\n\r\n\r\nDE-CAMPING SONG.\r\n\r\n  U-_ni_-on--you an' I on!\r\n  It's time that you and I were gone;\r\n  Gone to fight with all our might,\r\n  And drive the rebels left and right;\r\n  There is Uncle Sam, and I am Sam's Son,\r\n  And we'll crush the Philistines with you an' I on.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n  U-ni-on--you an' I on!\r\n  It's time that you an' I were gone.\r\n\r\n  U-ni-on, are _you_ nigh on?\r\n  It's time we were there, and the fight were won;\r\n  O Old Samson! you never knew\r\n  What _this_ Sam's son, when he tries, can do;\r\n  Your jaw-bone made the enemy flee--\r\n  They shall walk jaw-bone from Tennessee.\r\n    U-ni-on--you an' I on!\r\n    It's time that you an' I were gone.\r\n\r\nReader, if the great call should come, drafting the whole North, why,\r\npack up your blankets and travel, light of heart, remembering that when\r\n_you_ are there, the secession-pool of rebellion must 'dry up' in a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said as to the degree of complicity in which the\r\nconfederates were guilty in stirring up savages against us. In a\r\n'Secesh' poem which 'De Bow' declares to be among the best which belong\r\nto the war, we find the following, which seems to have been written in\r\nthe Indian interest:\r\n\r\n  'Our women have hung their harps away,\r\n    And they scowl on your brutal bands,\r\n  While the nimble poignard dares the day\r\n    In their dear defiant hands;\r\n  They will strip their tresses to string our bows\r\n    Ere the Northern sun is set;\r\n  There's faith in their unrelenting woes,\r\n    There's life in the old land yet.'\r\n\r\nNow it is very evident that if the author of the lyric was not\r\ndescribing Indian squaws when he alluded to the 'scowling' females whose\r\n'nimble poignards dare the day,' he certainly _ought_ to have been. But\r\nthe allusion to 'the bows,' settles the matter. Bows and arrows are not\r\nused in the confederate army, though they are by Albert Pike's\r\nIndians--enough said.\r\n\r\nBut if the secessionists _will_ come North, and hemp should give out, we\r\nmay find a new application, with a slight alteration to the verse in\r\nquestion. For then our women of the North may\r\n\r\n  'Strip their tresses to string _your_ beaux.'\r\n\r\nAnd serve 'em right, too. That's all. But really, if this be, in the\r\nopinion of the first magazine of the South, one of the _best_ of\r\nSouthern poems, what _must_ the 'common sort' be?'\r\n\r\n\r\nGONE.\r\n\r\nBY H. L.

If so, read the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nIS SMOKING BENEFICIAL?\r\n\r\nLeaning from the balcony of the old hotel at Stresa, on the Lago\r\nMaggiore, the old hotel kept by Papa Bolangaro, and watching the sunset\r\nover Isola Bella and the lake, my friend Blome knocked away the ashes\r\nfrom his Vevay segar--wretched segars those--and dreamily gazed at the\r\nbeautiful scene before him.\r\n\r\n_Vino Barbera_, as they wrote its name in the bill, was not a bad wine;\r\na bottle of it assisted imagination as a percussion-cap does the powder\r\nin your rifle. In the present ease it also brought on an explosion, for\r\nas Blome knocked off the segar-ashes for the second time, he heard a\r\nloud exclamation from a balcony on the _primo piano_ below him. He\r\nlooked down. You have seen, I have seen, all the world has seen the\r\nItalian woman of paintings and engravings--black eyes, black hair,\r\ngolden and red-peach complexion--there she was.\r\n\r\nMy friend passed down apologies for his oversight; an oversight--bowing\r\n_preux-chevalier_-ly--he was afraid unpardonable, when he saw the object\r\nhe had overlooked. The beautiful Italian received the apology most\r\ncharmingly. It proved the overture to a brilliant adventure culminating\r\nin Milan.\r\n\r\n'You observe,' said Blome to me, 'what real benefits can be derived from\r\nsmoking. Here have I formed the acquaintance of a very pretty woman, who\r\nwill fall desperately in love with me, who will call me by my first name\r\nwithin two days, all through segar-ashes. I had a friend in Jena once,\r\nthe university-town----'\r\n\r\n'Where you got that sword-cut over the cheek?'\r\n\r\n'Where I received it. Good! My friend in Jena was a theological student,\r\na very steady young man. While others would come reeling home from the\r\nbeer-kneips, he would be careful always to keep steady and under gentle\r\nsail; but he had one weakness, a want of confidence while in the\r\npresence of woman--one strong point, pipe-smoking.\r\n\r\n'One afternoon he was smoking a pipe at his chamber-window, and\r\nregarding the passers-by in the street below. When his pipe was smoked\r\nout, he emptied its ashes in the street; as he did so, he looked down,\r\n_Himmel_! The ashes fell on the head of Fräulein Baumann, who dwelt in\r\nthe same house in the story below him, and who was at that time knitting\r\na pair of stockings and also looking at the passengers in the street.\r\n\r\n'The theological student drew his head in from the window with the\r\nquickness of a turtle. He sat down and meditated.\r\n\r\n'Now Fräulein Baumann was a good-hearted blonde, very well calculated to\r\nmake a good wife to somebody, and her mother, the widow Baumann,\r\ndetermined that this calculation should become a mathematical certainty\r\nthe first time there was any opportunity of its becoming a fixed fact.\r\nShe had for some time regarded our student as the coming man. When he\r\nflung ashes at her daughter's head, the mother said to her daughter:\r\n\r\n''Angelika, thou must find time to make a potato-salad, and see that the\r\nsmoked goose is well cooked on thy wedding-day.'\r\n\r\n''Ma, when am I going to be married, and who to?'\r\n\r\n''_Stille!_ here comes thy husband.'\r\n\r\n'With great trembling the student summoned up force enough to descend\r\nthe stairs, in order to make a humble apology to the Fräulein for the\r\nashes accident. He knocked at the Frau Baumann's door, and asked to see\r\nthe Fräulein; but lo! her mother stood before him with a very affable\r\nair.\r\n\r\n''_Mad-dad-ame_, I have called in--in, in relation to your d--d-daughter.\r\nI----'\r\n\r\n''Are you not the theological student, Herr Müller, who lives overhead?'\r\nasked Frau Baumann.\r\n\r\n''I am, Mad-dame. I----'\r\n\r\n''Be seated, I pray you, and _O mein Herr_! I am so glad to learn from\r\nyour own lips the declaration of your love for my dearest, best, kindest\r\ndaughter, Angelika. She will make you the best of wives; a nurse in\r\naffliction, a companion in distress, a soother in sorrow, a housekeeper\r\nin tribulation, a--but here she is! Angelika, my daughter, behold the\r\nHerr Müller, who has sought thy hand; give him the betrothal kiss.' Here\r\nFrau Baumann bursting into tears, left the room and the young people\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n'I draw a curtain over the thunderstruck theological student. He went in\r\nabout ashes and was coming out with hymeneal torches! Before he knew\r\nwhere he was, he had given the betrothal kiss, and one year afterward\r\nmarried the blonde Angelika. If you ever meet an old lady who says\r\nsmoking is beneficial, you may be sure her name is Frau Baumann,\r\nmother-in-law of our theological student.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShoddy is not so much heard of now.

To judge from a recent attempt at\r\nimposition in New-York, one might suppose that negroes were so rare in\r\nthis country that we are obliged to imitate them, by way of keeping up\r\nthe supply. Not long ago, a young woman, named Perry, and a Dr. Perkins,\r\nof Oneida county, engaged with a broker of the curb-stone persuasion to\r\nshow off the lady as a case of gradual external carbonization; it being\r\nasserted that for four years her body had gradually been turning to\r\ncharcoal! Examination by Dr. Mott and others revealed the fact that 'the\r\nsupposed epidermis was made of woven cotton, into which charcoal mixed\r\nwith gum had been worked.' This was tightly gummed to the fair dame, who\r\nwas to have been exhibited 'in style' in a stylish house in Fourth\r\nstreet; but who was taken to Bellevue Hospital, to be 'ungummed,' as the\r\nFrench say of people who are turned out of place and lose their\r\nchances--as this damsel did.

Its matter is high-toned and\r\ninteresting, it is the _most outspoken_ print we know of, and its\r\noutspokenness is the result of a fresh and vigorous life that is not\r\nwarped by petty conventionalities.'\r\n\r\nWe thank our editorial friend for his compliment, and sincerely trust\r\nthat those who have followed us in our career will not disagree with\r\nhim. We honestly and earnestly believe that we _are_ outspoken and\r\nindependent, and accountable in no earthly way to any one, or aught save\r\nour conscience and the public. We can imagine no measure for the good of\r\nthe people, which we would not urge heart and soul, and we most\r\ncertainly know of no public official, in any capacity, whom we should\r\nfeel bound to spare in the event of his unworthiness becoming patent. We\r\nare neither Radical nor Conservative, neither anti-capital nor\r\nanti-poor-man's rights, but hold to the great and glorious creed of\r\nLabor and Intelligence hand in hand with Capital, and the harmony of\r\ntheir interests. We believe in constantly enlarging the area of human\r\nfreedom, holding that the freer and more responsible you make a man,\r\nthe more, as a rule, will you stimulate him to improve himself.\r\nAnd we detest from our very soul the Southern-planter and\r\nNorthern-democratic-conservative doctrine that society should consist of\r\ntwo grades, the first being the mudsill poor, to whom certain\r\nprotections and privileges should be granted, and are due by the second\r\nor the 'higher classes;' holding that a free American, beyond a good\r\neducation (to which every tax-payer contributes) should claim 'nothing\r\nfrom any body,' and that the less use is made of such phrases as 'lower\r\norders,' 'aristocracy,' and 'social nobility,' the more creditable will\r\nit be for man or woman, let their 'position' be what it will.\r\n\r\nThis war has inaugurated a new era when earnest, honest thought, and\r\nbold straightforward speech alone can effect any thing. It is the time\r\nfor fearlessness and straightforwardness if there ever was one in our\r\nhistory. We have a great war in hand, and great political reforms and\r\nmeasures of tremendous importance are crowding thickly around it, while\r\nothers, not less mighty, are looming dimly behind them. The great\r\nprinciples of Republicanism, of man's capacity for self-government, of\r\nfreedom and of progress, have been brought to 'the struggle for life,'\r\nand it depends upon our national American energy and _honesty_ to\r\ndetermine whether they shall live. If they _are_ to live, we shall be\r\nfirst among nations, not in the narrow, wretched sense of old-fashioned\r\ndiplomacy, but in the high Christian sense of aiding all oppressed\r\nhumanity in their hopes of attaining their rights. But if these\r\nprinciples are to perish--better would it be for this whole land to\r\nbecome a wilderness, and every life a death, than that we should survive\r\nthe degradation. We have not yet sunk so low that there is no truth left\r\nworth dying for. There was a time when men, women, and children were\r\nmartyred by countless thousands for their fidelity to the faith that\r\nextended the same religious rights to all, and now that time has come\r\nagain to us, calling for fresh sacrifices to the same principle as\r\nregards earthly rights and the common happiness of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut we believe that the truth will prevail, after a sore trial, and that\r\nwe shall be rewarded to the full. 'No cross, no crown.' But there is a\r\ncrown after the cross, and God will give it to us. We are passing\r\nthrough the baptism of fire--and verily we needed it, both South and\r\nNorth. The South had become mad with vanity and aristocracy; the North\r\nwas, is still, corrupt and rotten beyond all healthy life, with such\r\nvillainy in 'politics,' and such indifference to all that was noble and\r\nhonorable through the greed of gold, that honest and able men were cast\r\naside, or at best, used as mere tools by the 'intelligent.' Now we are\r\nin the struggle for life, and rascals, whether of the Union or of the\r\nconfederacy, will sooner or later be tried, tested, and rejected. The\r\npeople are very patient, and they can be for a long time fooled with\r\nthis or that man's reputed honesty and ability. But we have come to the\r\ntime of trial, and the people will soon find who is false and what is\r\n_true_.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be expected that in one year, or in two, the country will\r\nbe rid of all the old, corrupt politicians and demagogues who\r\ncontinually work every subject of public interest into the question of a\r\n'party.' But it is gratifying to observe that, whether Radical or\r\nConservative, such men are beginning to be regarded with contempt. In\r\ntimes like these, _we_, at least, blame no man for honestly advocating\r\nany policy which he thinks will aid the Union cause. But the country was\r\nnever more disgusted than it is at present, with men who use politics as\r\na mere trade by which to live. The infamy which has attached to the\r\nmiserable and imbecile Buchanan, that type of degraded, pettifogging\r\ndiplomacy, is rapidly extending to his whole tribe--and their name is\r\nlegion. It is significant that a bank, whose notes bore as vignette a\r\nportrait of the ex-honorable ex-President, has been obliged to call them\r\nin, and substitute another device, since so many of the bills were\r\nmarked beneath the picture with such words as 'traitor,' and 'Judas\r\nIscariot.'\r\n\r\nThe _people_ are 'all right' in this struggle: but they are awaking very\r\nrapidly to the fact that those in power _must_ be honest or able. The\r\ncoming year is to witness either a grand sifting or a tremendous\r\nprotest, whose thunder-tones will be heard through all history. It is\r\nall very well for conservatives to lay the blame on their enemies and\r\nyell for their blood; to recommend the assassination of Charles Sumner,\r\nas has been done by one Boston journal; or the hanging of all leading\r\nRadicals, as recommended time and again by the New-York _Herald_; but\r\nthis will not satisfy the people who can not see how the country is to\r\nbe saved by holding up and aiding the enemy. Neither, on the other hand,\r\nwill the people long regard with favor any persons of the opposite\r\nparty, who are suspected of having managed the war for their own selfish\r\npurposes. The old hacks who can only live for personal preferment and\r\nfor plunder, will be found out, and their places taken by honester and\r\nyounger men, whose minds will have been shaped, not in by-gone political\r\npettifogging, but in the great earnest needs of the times--in honor and\r\nin truth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven before authentic copies of General Butler's famed 'Woman Order' had\r\nreached us, it was generally understood that he had really done very\r\nlittle more than enforce an already existing local law; yet 'with the\r\nword' there went up a squall from the democratic press, clamoring for\r\nhis instant removal; so angry were the 'Conservatives' that any thing\r\nshould be said or done which would in any way injure the\r\n'susceptibilities' of their beloved rebel friends.\r\n\r\nIf we are really _at war_, it is neither fit nor proper that such\r\nexpressions of sympathy for the enemy should continually appear, to keep\r\nalive in the heart of the foe continual hopes of Northern aid. What does\r\nthe reader think, for instance, of such a paragraph as the following\r\nfrom the Washington correspondence of the New-York _Herald_--which has\r\nbeen copied with commendation by its colleagues:\r\n\r\n     'All conservative men here are shocked at the sweeping measures of\r\n     confiscation proposed by the radicals. They provide substantially\r\n     for the abolition of slavery, because slaveholders, for the most\r\n     part, are considered as rebels by these bills. _There are a quarter\r\n     of a million of slaveholders_, and a quarter of a million of other\r\n     property-holders in the South, _that would be made beggars by the\r\n     execution of this programme_. It is pretended that this wholesale\r\n     confiscation is for the purpose of compensating for the expenses of\r\n     the war; but none will dare to go into the Africanized South among\r\n     an infuriated people to purchase estates. It is proposed, also, to\r\n     arm the negroes, and in effect make them superior to the million of\r\n     whites, who are to be deprived of their property. Of course, under\r\n     such circumstances, there will be no cotton or other crops, nor any\r\n     demand for Northern manufactures from the South.'\r\n\r\nReally! and so legislation at Washington is to be conducted with special\r\nreference to protecting the property of the rebels! No confiscation,\r\nforsooth, because the half million of rebels who have plunged us into\r\nthis iniquitous and horrible war, in the hope of utterly ruining us,\r\nmight thereby be reduced to poverty! Northern men may pay a million a\r\nday in taxes, but the select slaveholding few who caused the taxation\r\nare to be exempted. How shallow is the concluding '_of course_, under\r\nsuch circumstances there will be no demand for Northern manufactures\r\nfrom the South.' Will there not? Wait until the South has been well\r\nsubdued, thoroughly Butlered and vigorously Northed; wait till the\r\nYankee is at home there, and then see if there will be 'no demand for\r\nNorthern manufactures.' Quite as tender to the rebels is the spirit of\r\nthe following from the Boston _Post_ of May 31st:\r\n\r\n     'Senator Sumner,' a correspondent writes, 'in an argument against\r\n     the proposed tax on cotton, not only opposed it as _an act of\r\n     injustice to the unrepresented South_--for grain, hemp, and flax\r\n     are left untouched--but as oppressive on manufacturers.' Mr.\r\n     Sumner's sense of justice is called into exercise only when it\r\n     suits its owner's convenience. He has no thought of 'injustice to\r\n     the unrepresented South,' when he wishes to tax negroes, emancipate\r\n     slaves, and confiscate Southern property.'\r\n\r\nSuch remarks require no comment. If a rebel in arms, disgraced by every\r\ninfamy of treason, is only to be treated as his representatives would\r\nlike, then it is indeed time for the honest friends of the Union to\r\ninquire what safeguard we have in the future against national ruin?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMY MOCKING-BIRD.\r\n\r\n  With wings a-quiver, eyes irate,\r\n    He watched me coming near,\r\n  Each plume upon his panting breast\r\n    Astir with kindling fear.\r\n\r\n  My hand, though always kindly stretched,\r\n    He _would_ not think it good;\r\n  And as I placed some sugar in,\r\n    He pecked, and drew my blood.\r\n\r\n  So have I seen the souls caged here,\r\n    To learn celestial speech\r\n  From angels chanting love so near\r\n    They seemed within arm reach;\r\n\r\n  When closer to them drew God's power,\r\n    In wrath or terror stand;\r\n  And while he dropped the sweet, dart up\r\n    And rend His dear, warm hand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe London _Times_ is becoming malignantly consistent, and has declared\r\nthat there should be at present nothing more said of intervention in\r\nAmerican affairs, because it would have the effect to immediately\r\nstrengthen the Federal army.\r\n\r\n     'If we wish to give the Civil War a new impetus, to recruit for the\r\n     North with a vigor with which they never can again recruit for\r\n     themselves, we have only to take some step, we do not say what\r\n     step, but any step which can be represented as being an\r\n     interference on our part in the quarrel. The spirit of conquest is\r\n     worn out, but we know the Americans too well to doubt that the\r\n     spirit of national independence is as strong as ever. If we\r\n     interfere at all, we assist Mr. Lincoln to raise his three hundred\r\n     thousand men, we give a new impetus to the war, and postpone\r\n     indefinitely the chances of peace, which will never come till the\r\n     North has been convinced that it is useless to prosecute the war\r\n     any further. To do nothing is often the wisest, but generally the\r\n     most difficult policy. We hope that, unless some complete change in\r\n     the conditions of the problem take place, our government will on no\r\n     account allow itself to be tempted out of its present policy of\r\n     expressive silence and masterly inaction.'\r\n\r\nThe _Times_ speaks too late. One year ago it did not express the\r\nsentiments of all England--now unfortunately we find that it has not\r\nonly poisoned all Great Britain, but is rapidly stirring up Europe\r\nagainst us. The steady stream of falsehood; the reports of Federal\r\ndefeats which never occurred, and of confederate victories more\r\nunfounded, are gradually weakening the faith even of Americans abroad in\r\nthe great cause of freedom. Let our people arm and out, in all their\r\nstrength. England and France are only waiting for reverses to our\r\nGovernment to attack us right and left.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe clip the following in reference to a popular eccentric phrase from a\r\nnote by a friend:\r\n\r\n     'By the way, do you know that the phrase, 'Or any other man,' can\r\n     be found in Byron's _Letter to my Grandmother's Review_? He writes:\r\n\r\n     \"Charley Incledon's usual exordium when people came into the tavern\r\n     to hear him sing, without paying their share of the reckoning: 'If\r\n     a maun, or _ony_ maun, or _ony other_ maun,' etc., etc.''\r\n\r\nThat settles it. After all, there is nothing original in this world, or,\r\nas we presume, 'any other world.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the steamers for Europe take every week gold from this country, there\r\nis at least some comfort in the reflection that we received and continue\r\nto receive something for it. If American securities are returning to us\r\nfrom abroad, we are at least getting them back cheap and shall some day\r\nsell them again dear. There is some comfort and common-sense in the\r\nfollowing from one of 'Hallett and Co.'s' circulars:\r\n\r\n     'We certainly ought not to complain. We had their money at the\r\n     right time. It has done for the nation all that money could do--by\r\n     giving the highest possible value to all our resources and\r\n     products. Having reaped the full advantage of the investment,\r\n     which has increased our means more than five-fold, we were never in\r\n     a better position to commence its return. The securities are still\r\n     very low; on an average from ten to fifty per cent below what they\r\n     were originally sold for. To this discount is to be added something\r\n     over twenty per cent in the present price of exchange. We are\r\n     getting back our securities at about one half what we parted with\r\n     them for. As money is plenty, the foreigner paying the premium on\r\n     gold, we are certainly driving a very good bargain. We can, without\r\n     the least inconvenience, part with one hundred million dollars in\r\n     specie, which is lying idle in the vaults of our banks and the\r\n     hands of our people, and get back nearly twice the amount of\r\n     interest-paying securities, which is equivalent to the payment of a\r\n     debt too, and stopping the interest on an equal amount, assuming\r\n     securities of this country to a similar amount were held abroad,\r\n     which is an excessive estimate, the aggregate not probably\r\n     exceeding one hundred million dollars.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have heard of a German, who having been strung up in jest and cut\r\ndown, declared it was 'a fery pad choke.' The best 'choke' of the season\r\nwas issued by our friend the _Boston Traveller_, who in commenting on\r\nthe remark of the London _Times_, to the effect that Mr. Lincoln is\r\neating his artichoke, the South, leaf by leaf, but thinks it will not\r\nagree with him, said: 'It will not trouble him a thousandth part so much\r\nas Jeff Davis will be troubled when he shall, by and by, take _his_\r\n'heartychoke with caper sauce.''\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHON ROBERT J. WALKER knows the South well, and he has of late written\r\nwell on it and on the present state and future prospects of our country.\r\nThose who have read Mr. Atkinson's instructive pamphlet upon 'Cheap\r\nCotton,' will be interested in the strong confirmation of his arguments\r\ngiven by Hon. Robert J. Walker, late of Mississippi, in the following\r\nstatement contained in one of his recent letters:\r\n\r\n     'From long residence in the South, and from having traversed every\r\n     Southern State, I know it to be true that cotton is raised there\r\n     most extensively and profitably by non-slaveholders, and upon farms\r\n     using exclusively white labor. In Texas, especially, this is a\r\n     great truth, nor is there a doubt that skilled, educated,\r\n     persevering, and energetic free labor, engaged voluntarily for\r\n     wages for its own use, would in time, especially when aided by\r\n     improved culture and machinery, produce much larger crops and\r\n     better cotton than is now raised by the forced and ignorant labor\r\n     of slaves, and at a much cheaper rate and a far greater profit than\r\n     any crop now produced in the North.'\r\n\r\nWith this great truth before us, will Government hesitate to seize on\r\nand settle Texas, as soon as circumstances admit? We have urged Texas\r\nfrom the beginning as the great stone of resistance which must\r\neventually, by means of free labor be employed to stem the progress of\r\ncotton-ocracy in the other Southern States. On this subject Hon. Robert\r\nJ. Walker's letter of June 28th is one of the most instructive and\r\nremarkable documents issued since the beginning of the free-labor\r\nagitation, and it is to be desired that it should be read by every\r\nfreeman in the Union. Colonization, voluntary but effective, is, as he\r\nholds, the only remedy for the terrible evil of slavery, and the only\r\nbasis of the peaceful restoration of the Union.\r\n\r\nIt was urged, months ago, against THE CONTINENTAL by a radical Abolition\r\norgan, that while favoring Emancipation, we were quite willing 'to\r\ncolonize the negro out of the way.' And if it could promote the real\r\nwelfare of both black and white, why should he not be colonized, even\r\n'out of the way'? 'But it is impossible,' say the Conservatives; to\r\nwhich we reply that this is an age of great conceptions and great deeds,\r\nand it would be strange indeed if we, with steamboats, could not effect\r\nas much as was done of old by the most primitive races of both\r\nhemispheres. The Incas of Peru had no difficulty in moving hundreds of\r\nthousands of a conquered race to fresh fields and pastures new--why\r\nshould we find it impossible? Let the same enthusiasm which has been\r\ndisplayed on the bare subject of freeing the black, be devoted to\r\nfreeing and placing him at the same time in a climate congenial to his\r\nnature, and we should soon witness a solution of our great national\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a genial Western correspondent for\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM JOHNSON'S BEAR.\r\n\r\nA STORY WITH A MORAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States, this poem is\r\ndedicated with the 'distinguished consideration' of\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n  Tom Johnson he lived on the Western border,\r\n  Where he went to escape from 'law and order,'\r\n  For Tom was a terrible fellow, was he,\r\n  He drunk, and he swore, and he fou't[B] like the\r\n  Old Harry--and Tom he had a wife:\r\n  Fit partner she was of his backwoods life.\r\n\r\n  Tom lived on the border for divers years,\r\n  Where he fou't the red-skins, and he fou't the bears\r\n  And there wasn't a thing that could bite or scratch\r\n  For which Tom Johnson wasn't a match,\r\n  Excepting his wife, and she was the better\r\n  Half by all odds--he'd often get her\r\n  In a tight place, and give her a strapping.\r\n  But somehow or other 'twould always happen,\r\n  In every tussle and every bout,\r\n  In every 'scrimmage' and every rout,\r\n  She'd come out ahead of the cross-grained old wizzard,\r\n  And by hook or crook manage to 'give him a blizzard.'\r\n  Sometimes from a brawl of which Tom was the hero,\r\n  Returning at midnight, the weather at zero,\r\n  His wife snug in bed, and the door safely barred,\r\n  Long time would elapse ere his shouts could be heard;\r\n  And sometimes she'd catch him dead drunk or asleep,\r\n  When he'd find himself suddenly 'all of a heap,'\r\n  And open his eyes on his bellicose bride,\r\n  Hot mush in his mouth and his under-pins tied.\r\n  So she managed to keep just inside of the law,\r\n  While he ever would find himself '_hors du combat_.'\r\n\r\n  As Johnson was one day exploring the wood,\r\n  To replenish the meat-tub--then empty--with food,\r\n  While a tree-top near by he was leisurely viewin''\r\n  He spied the short ears and sharp eyes of old Bruin,\r\n  Peering out 'mid the branches--a sight worth a dollar\r\n  When the rifle is charged and the stomach is hollow;\r\n  So he drew a bead on him, and sent him a missile,\r\n  Which Brain perceived, by an ominous whistle,\r\n  Was very near taking him plump in the eye,\r\n  But he dodged just in time, and the bullet went by.\r\n\r\n  Now bears are pugnacious--as much so as wives,\r\n  And whenever assaulted will fight for their lives;\r\n  So seeing that Tom's ammunition was spent,\r\n  He determined at once on a hasty descent;\r\n  For knowing that he or Tom Johnson would eat,\r\n  The question arose which should furnish the meat;\r\n  For although the bullet had wrought some confusion,\r\n  A moment's reflection produced the conclusion,\r\n  That he at the foot of the tree with the gun,\r\n  Minus powder and bullet, must needs be the one;\r\n  So he slid down the tree, with much scratching and clawing,\r\n  Designing to give poor Tom's carcass a gnawing.\r\n\r\n  But Thomas, intent upon saving his life,\r\n  And calling to mind a sharp trick of his wife,\r\n  As Bruin came down, his legs clasping the tree,\r\n  Caught a paw in each hand and held tight as could be:\r\n  He put on a grip unto Bruin quite new,\r\n  Like a vice when the blacksmith is turning the screw.\r\n\r\n  But now what to do there arose a great doubt,\r\n  For Bruin and Johnson had both just found out\r\n  What neither had thought of until 'twas too late,\r\n  That each was exposed to a merciless fate\r\n  At the hands, or the teeth, or the claws of the other,\r\n  At which _neither_ could his astonishment smother,\r\n  And neither knew what it was safest to do;\r\n  'Twas _hard_ to hold on, but 'twas worse to let go!\r\n\r\n  Now Johnson still being not far from his house,\r\n  Bethought him in time of his excellent spouse,\r\n  So he hooted and hallooed and made such a noise\r\n  She distinguished at last his affectionate voice,\r\n  Calling loudly for help as it rose on the breeze,\r\n  Like the panther's wild scream in the tops of the trees:\r\n  'O Julee, dear Julee! come, help me this time,\r\n  And I never again--will--(oh! bother the rhyme,)\r\n  Will bite you, or scratch you, or whip you, not I,\r\n  But love and protect you till you or I die.'\r\n\r\n  Now good Mistress Johnson, dear soul, when she heard\r\n  The piteous cries of her penitent lord,\r\n  Got herself to the wood with broom-stick in hand.\r\n  'I am, most respectfully, yours to command,'\r\n  Said the wife, as she came and found Tom and the bear\r\n  Both hugging a tree with the grip of despair.\r\n  'O Julee, _dear_ Julee! How can you?--now come,\r\n  Do help me, or quickly-confound it!--our home\r\n  Won't have any master!--dear Julee, consider--\r\n  The children no daddy, and you a lone widow!'\r\n  An _un_lucky hint for poor Tom, by the by,\r\n  'For worse things _might_ happen!' thought she with a sigh.\r\n\r\n  But good mistress Johnson, though love was but scant,\r\n  Had a heart never hewn from the worst adamant;\r\n  It softened apace, so with broom-stick in air\r\n  And ire in her eye she advanced on the bear,\r\n  Who seeing the enemy thus reënforced\r\n  Tried to get his fore-paws from Tom's clutches divorced.\r\n\r\n  O woman, poor woman! dear woman! sweet thing!\r\n    O light of earth's darkness! O treasure supernal!\r\n  Thy fond heart, though crushed, win unceasingly cling\r\n    To a loved one, though fallen, degraded, infernal!\r\n\r\n  Thrice Bruin's tough hide from the broom-stick now had a cut;\r\n  Quoth Johnson: 'My darling, that weapon's inadequate--\r\n  Hold a bit--let me see--now we'll fix him--here, Mother--\r\n  Reach your hand--take this paw--hold it tight--now the other.\r\n  There, _I_ will dispatch him--ah! where is my gun?\r\n  And bullets? dear me!--ah!--why, what have I done?\r\n  I will run to the house, and be back in a trice--\r\n  Hold on, my beloved! be 'still as a mice!''\r\n  'Quick! quick!' the wife shouted. 'Be off--get away!\r\n  Make tracks, Mr. Johnson! don't stand there all day!'\r\n\r\n  So Tom started off in pursuit of assistance,\r\n  And leisurely walking a very short distance,\r\n  Turned, paused to reflect, then addressed her: 'My dear,\r\n  My conscience upbraids me concerning this bear;\r\n  A very great doubt has arisen in my mind--\r\n  I am not quite sure--but am rather inclined,\r\n  Indeed--I may say--I have reached the conclusion\r\n  That bears have been made a Divine Institution;\r\n  This is plainly deduced from the Scriptures of truth,\r\n  Which frightened me much in the days of my youth,\r\n  With the story of forty of ages quite tender,\r\n  Torn to strings by two gears of the feminine gender:\r\n  And not only so, but you see, Mistress Julia,\r\n  This same institution is very 'peculiar;'\r\n  I found it somewhat inconvenient to hold,\r\n  (The cubs are quite harmless, but this one is old,)\r\n  He is gentle at first, but as muscle increases,\r\n  Shows some disposition to tear one in pieces.\r\n  Then hold him the tighter, and keep up good heart,\r\n  As it's all in the family, you'll do your part.'\r\n\r\n  Tom closed his oration with actions to suit,\r\n  Then went to his house, where the reprobate brute\r\n  Whipped the children and kicked his old mother out-door,\r\n  Got tipsy as Bacchus and rolled on the floor,\r\n  While his wife held the bear, fast tied to the spot,\r\n  And how long she staid there, deponent says not.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Secesh has a bear, and has had many years,\r\n  At first, a mere pet, he engendered no fears;\r\n  But now he's grown strong and can fight like a major,\r\n  And has like his master become an old stager;\r\n  He has taught him to work, and has trained him to fight,\r\n  Adding strength to his hands and increasing his might;\r\n  Albeit if _free_ he would turn on his master,\r\n  Who knows it full well, and hence holds him the faster;\r\n  But not only so, he insists _we_ shall help\r\n  While he fights to destroy us, at holding his whelp!\r\n  And strangely enough, we obey his command,\r\n  While he strikes at our vitals and plunders the land!\r\n  He has murdered the son and led captive the brother,\r\n  Has broke up the home and made war on his mother;\r\n  And now while our sons by the thousand are slain\r\n  The nation to save and its life to maintain,\r\n  When the patriot's eyelids are closing in death,\r\n  While a prayer for his country inspires his last breath,\r\n  Or bleeding he lies as the foul traitor's dart\r\n  Is caught in the folds of the flag round his heart,\r\n  While freedom's bright bow, for the millions unborn,\r\n  No longer encircles the brow of the storm,\r\n  While the sun of our glory grows dim in our sight,\r\n  And the star of our destiny's shrouded in night;\r\n  Still our paralyzed hands, to our country untrue,\r\n  Are stretched out to _succor_ the traitorous crew,\r\n  As they strike for our lives, fully bent on our ruin,\r\n  _We_ lend them assistance by holding their Bruin,\r\n  And tell all the world that our national wars\r\n  Shall be waged to protect _constitutional bears_.\r\n\r\n  And now let us know, my dear sir, in conclusion,\r\n  How long must continue this monstrous delusion,\r\n  (If not a state secret, so sacred a one\r\n  That it may to the Cabinet only be known,)\r\n  While being destroyed by a traitorous war,\r\n  _How long we must aid them by holding their bear_?\r\n  Or how long shall we flourish our broom-stick, and say,\r\n  To one who would help us: 'Keep out of the way!\r\n  Go home to your master, your Samaritan neighbor;\r\n  Return all his kindness and give him your labor,\r\n  Plant corn, hoe the cotton, and keep things all bright,\r\n  Give him plenty to eat and more leisure to fight;\r\n  For we mean to protect him in every 'RIGHT;'\r\n  And the best way of keeping the 'whole Constitution'\r\n  Is to help those who fight for its _whole_ dissolution,\r\n  (Though this proposition may seem somewhat strange,)\r\n  While we dig our own ditches and fire at long range,\r\n  For our duty is plain, when the traitor makes war,\r\n  To give aid and comfort by _holding his bear_.'\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: In the border dialect this word rhymes with 'shout,'\r\n'about,' etc.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe find the following in the notice of THE CONTINENTAL MONTHLY by a\r\ncontemporary:\r\n\r\n     'The CONTINENTAL looks upon Slavery through blood and murder eyes.\r\n     It sees in the institution nothing but lashes, salt-rubbed wounds,\r\n     bloodhounds, and iron-hearted taskmasters. _It looks upon the war\r\n     as solely for the freedom of the nigger_; and judging from its tone\r\n     for the past six months would undoubtedly go in for an entire\r\n     separation, if its editors and contributors thought at the end of\r\n     the conflict the rebellious States would be restored to the Union\r\n     with the 'peculiar institution' still in force.'\r\n\r\n_Ab uno disce omnes._ This, reader, is the manner in which every\r\ndemocratic-conservative journal which has undertaken to notice our\r\nMagazine speaks of it. And the reader who has followed us--who has\r\nfairly and equitably appreciated our views of the war and of\r\nEmancipation--will not hesitate for an instant in pronouncing it as\r\nperfectly _false_ a verdict as was ever yet given against any one. We\r\nhave never in any way looked upon the war as 'solely for the freedom of\r\nthe nigger,' and we have been chid by the regular Abolition press\r\nbecause we did _not_ look more to the welfare of the negro, or, as the\r\n_Liberator_ accused us, of being willing to 'colonize the slave out of\r\nthe way.' It was in the _Knickerbocker_ and in these pages, and\r\neditorially, that the principle of the true Republican, Free White Labor\r\nEmancipationists, in the words, 'Emancipation for the sake of the WHITE\r\nMan,' first appeared. And while we advocate ultimate emancipation, it\r\nis not as _the_ matter of _primary_ importance that we do so. Slavery\r\nhas inextricably entangled itself with the war, and no one who takes a\r\nbroad, comprehensive view of the struggle, or of contemporary history,\r\ncan fail to see that slavery must ultimately go, because it makes bad\r\ncitizens of the masters, wastes soil, represses manufactures,\r\nneutralizes the proper development of capital, and, worst of all,\r\ndegrades labor--man's noblest prerogative--and inflicts grievous wrong\r\non the white working man. And does not every Southern journal and every\r\nSouthern 'gentleman' prove what we say? 'Aristocrat,' 'Norman\r\ngentleman,' 'Yankee serf,' 'vile herd'--is it not enough to make the\r\nheart sick and the brain burn to hear the poor sons and daughters of\r\ntoil, those whom God has appointed to be truly good and useful, cursed\r\nand reviled in this manner by the few owners of black labor? Is there\r\nnot enough in the wrongs of the _white_ man to inspire all the headlong\r\nzeal and boldness with which the press credit us, without making the\r\nmiserable _negro_ the chief aim? Not but that we pity the latter, God\r\nknows! But it is the elevation of the dignity of _white_ labor that we\r\nhave in hand, and while we advocate 'emancipation to come' sooner or\r\nlater, it is as a means of doing justice to the white man. Let us\r\nemancipate white labor from the comparison with slavery and from the\r\nsneers of an aristocracy which _will_ be 'Cæsar or nothing' among us.\r\n\r\nThe South has sinned against man and God by voluntarily, boldly,\r\nshamelessly reviling the poor, who are the chosen children of God. And\r\nfor all this they shall be judged by those whom they have cursed and\r\nridiculed. The most crushing tread of destiny is reserved for those who\r\nimpertinently aid her in trampling the lowly. Does Christ, think you,\r\nwhose whole teaching was one upholding of the poor and the hard-working,\r\napprove this scorn of the 'laboring scum'? So surely as this thing has\r\nbeen fevered to a war, so surely shall there be one last moment when\r\ndying Southern sin shall exclaim: '_Vicisti Galilæ!_'\r\n\r\nBut what are we to think of the hangers-on and parasites and shadows and\r\n'shadows of shadows,' as Plautus calls the vilest toadies to sycophants,\r\nwho, hard-working men themselves, try to catch some faint reflection of\r\nsham gentility by 'talking pro-slavery because they think it\r\naristocratic,' as Winthrop says? What of an _editor_--the one who of all\r\nmen works hard for indifferent reward--who forgets the nobility which\r\n_should_ surround all who speak for and to the people, and beslabbers\r\nthe meanest and most contemptible of even sham aristocracies, that which\r\nis _self_-conscious, self-glorifying by comparison and forgetful that\r\n_noblesse oblige_? Or what of him when he cunningly and with the vulgar\r\n'cuteness which characterizes the most degraded snobbery, takes pains to\r\nmake it appear that the labor of another on behalf of the poor white man\r\nis meant solely for the negro, and that the former is to be sacrificed\r\nto the latter!\r\n\r\nWe know, see, and feel clearly what we want and what we believe. It is\r\nthe progress of the rights of free white labor, which correctly\r\nconsidered means all that is right. And if this were understood and\r\nfelt, as it _should_ be by those most deeply interested, our police\r\nwould be amply sufficient to punish the _soi-disant_ Normans of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf we could speak a word to all men in or about to enter the army, it\r\nwould be: 'Don't drink.' We know the fever and ague country, and assure\r\nour readers that all advice to the contrary notwithstanding, he who lets\r\nliquor alone will fare best in the end. _Apropos_ of which we clip the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     'Hall's _Journal of Health_ recommends to those writing to soldier\r\n     friends to inclose a little _capsicum_ (in the vulgar, simply\r\n     strong cayenne pepper) in the letter. The editor declares that the\r\n     effect of the slightest pinch in a glass of water, is better than\r\n     quinine whisky. It prevents thirst, and wards off miasma; it\r\n     protects from chills, and does not induce too much animal heat. It\r\n     stimulates without leaving any depressing effect; all of which we\r\n     most firmly believe. The weight is so small that enough to do a\r\n     great deal of good may be put in tissue-paper and be inclosed in a\r\n     single letter without cost additional to the regular postage\r\n     rates.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEvery mail brings fresh proof of English antipathy to the Federal Union.\r\nIt is now only a question of time when we are to be attacked by the\r\ngreat Abolition nation. John Bull is hammering away at his iron-clads\r\nand doing his best in every direction to aid the aristocratic and\r\ndespotic principle, so dear to his soul--nay, which _is_ his very soul\r\nand self. In China he is helping the Imperialists, whose awful and\r\nheart-rending atrocities go beyond all belief--in the West, the\r\nslaveholder meets with his warmest sympathy. How well--how human--how\r\nChristian he looks _now_ with his sheepskin thrown aside--this selfish,\r\nbrutal savage, howling for cotton and trade and gold as though all\r\ntruth, honor, and nobility were as dirt before them.\r\n\r\nFor all this, England will have its reward. In the history of nations,\r\n1862 shall be marked as the year of British falsehood, infamy, and\r\nguilt. _Upharsin!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDEAR CONTINENTAL: Curious fellows those Pre-Raphaelites!\r\n\r\nDo you remember Holman Hunt's picture of the Light of the World? I\r\nremember that one evening at the Century, among a cheerful group of\r\nLeutze, Durand, Gifford, Mignot, and others, you once called it a\r\npre-Raphaelight of the World!\r\n\r\nWell, 'twas far away in Switzerland, _tilly hi ho--tilly i o!_ all in\r\nthe mountains high, several years ago, and I was touring and sketching\r\nsomewhere along in the Oberland. I found at last a retired village\r\nwithout English. No--not without them altogether--there was one little\r\nman with a _barba rossa_, and he was pre-Raphaeliting round for a\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nHe found it at last in a small rock about nine inches by twelve--full of\r\nsentiment, tone, color, piety, feeling, reality, child-like faith and\r\ntrustingness.\r\n\r\nAnd he went to work to paint the rock.\r\n\r\nDay after day he painted. When it rained he worked under an umbrella;\r\nwhen it sun-shone on him he toiled in the heat.\r\n\r\nI pitied him. 'Smith,' said I, 'what do you do that for? Why don't you\r\npick your stone up and take it home with you? Put it in your trunk and\r\ncarry it back to London. It isn't a landscape, you know.'\r\n\r\n'By Jove!' quoth he, 'I never thought of that. So I will, d'ye know. 'Ow\r\nvery hodd! Vell! you Yankees are werry hinwentive, I must hadmit.'\r\n\r\nAnd he did; and the portrait of the rock went into the 'Annual\r\nExhibish,' and was thought to be the deepest-toned thing 'out.'\r\n\r\nAnd it's _true_.\r\n\r\n  Yours also,\r\n  GALLI VAN T.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is odd, but after all, the world seldom sees a real original letter.\r\nLetters of business, old letters, love-letters, and letters written for\r\nprint, the world sees enough. But the real life-descriptive gossiping\r\nletter is rarely en-typed. More's the pity.\r\n\r\nHere is one--from a never-seen friend--which has been lying for months\r\nin THE CONTINENTAL his drawer. Shall we be pardoned for publishing it?\r\nWe hope so, for we remember that it pleased us well when we received it,\r\nand what is good for the editor must be good for the reader. Let it go!\r\n\r\n  _The Hermitage, May_, 1862.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND: Appearances--to make a very original remark--are deceitful.\r\nTo the traveler who may chance to cast his eyes upon this little brown,\r\nhouse, a little brown house it will be to him, 'and nothing more.' He\r\nwill not even notice the woodbines that are flinging their arms around\r\nthe windows, nor will he dwell for an instant upon the thrifty\r\ncotton-woods that guard the door, or bestow more than a casual glance on\r\nthe artistically arranged garden-beds, wherein I have anxiously watched\r\ntulips and radishes sprouting into existence. Anxiously--for winter has\r\nbeen writing a somewhat lengthy postscript to his annual message, and\r\nthe modest, gentle-mannered spring retreats in lady-like fright before\r\nhis furious blasts.\r\n\r\nNow we are having an interval of hazy warmth--the really royal weather\r\nof the year--red sunshine, the hills purple and blue in the distance,\r\nand the still air savory with the smoke of brush-burnings and the wild\r\nbreath of new-lifed vegetation. Lovelier than the Indian summer, for\r\nmingled with all things is the consciousness of the flowering and\r\nfruiting _to come_. The Indian summer has a sweet sadness. The spring is\r\nfull of hope and promise, and the _heart_ buds with the flowers.\r\n\r\nOut in the midst of all this country springtime freshness, our\r\n'Hermitage' looks up from its shrubberies and rejoices within itself,\r\nand does not care for the traveler's careless glances. The traveler may\r\ncall it stupid and ugly, if he calls it at all; our Hermitage still\r\npatiently wears its havelock of weather-beaten shingles, for _it_ knows\r\nthat beneath its lowly roof--radiant with whitewash and fresh paper--are\r\ncozy, coolly curtained rooms, where friendly books look down from the\r\nwall, and drowsy arm-chairs woo from the corners.\r\n\r\nYes, many Wisconsin banks have yielded up their lives in the past year,\r\nand in one of these fatal safes our little pile of 'ready' irrevocably\r\nevaporated! Ah! the palmy days! when we had rooms at the ----; when our\r\ntables were marble-topped and our mirrors presented full-length\r\nportraits of us; when every dinner was a feast for epicures; when\r\nservants awaited our nod or beck; when Davis's best turn-out bowled us\r\naway to the purple bluffs yonder, at every sunset, and bowled us back\r\nagain happy in pocket and in heart! Those days have gemmed themselves in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nWe find it necessary to 'put in for repairs,' as they say of a steamboat\r\nwhen her smoke-stacks are snapped off by a Lake Pepin gale, and she goes\r\nashore. At no distant day we will again go out into the tide. From any\r\nquantity of 'wild lands'--which we have the felicity of paying taxes\r\non--we have selected a ten-acre patch in the neighborhood of the city,\r\nand are living something after the style of Thoreau, except that we have\r\na better cook!\r\n\r\nFrom our modestly architectured porch we look out upon the broad,\r\nfar-stretching valley of the Mississippi. It is a vast view--so that a\r\nshower becomes a part of the landscape, and it is delightful to watch it\r\ntrailing over the hills. Alexander Smith is ahead of me in this idea,\r\nbut no matter. East and west the picturesque bluffs mingle in hazy\r\nsoftness with the sky; the roofs and steeples of the city glimmer in the\r\nsunny distance; now and then, away through the wooded banks we see\r\ncolumns of pearly steam, as some stately boat goes gliding by. I shall\r\nalways have a weakness for these proud, screeching steamboats, for there\r\nis one among them--the dear old 'Milwaukee'--for which I entertain a\r\nconfirmed infirmity! _We_ went honey-mooning in the 'Milwaukee.' Its\r\nmusical and far-heard whistle is doomed for evermore to deluge my soul\r\nin a 'sea of soft-blue memories.'\r\n\r\nOur carpets are of matting and oil-cloth, islanded here and there with a\r\nchoice bit of rug. My little kitchen is exultant in shining tins, a\r\nglittering 'Hotspur,' patented 1860, and a capacious cupboard, through\r\nthe glass doors of which shines forth a complete set of 'Ironstone.' On\r\nMondays a little Bohemian--with surprising strength in her diminutive\r\nperson--comes, and out from the fury of suds and steam issues a line of\r\nsnowy, flapping clothes. She receives her 'tri shealing' and trots home.\r\nAside from washing, I am addicted to that unpoetical, homely, dry, and\r\nutterly plebeian practice of doing my own work. Think you I could endure\r\nto have a poetic mood burst in upon by a red-faced girl, smelling of\r\ndish-water, exclaiming, '_The tay's out_'? Besides, I never was born to,\r\nhad thrust upon me, or achieved, any surplus amount of 'greatness,'\r\nconsequently my laurels will not suffer from being in contact with\r\nsauce-pans and toasting-forks. (But fancy the idea of Mrs. Browning\r\na-frying _flapjacks_!) I have lived for the most part in the country,\r\nyou know, and at the old home I was applauded on by an appreciative\r\nmamma to rare feats in this department of humble life. I combine the\r\nartist with the cook--the ideal with the material. I consult color and\r\nthe nice shades of taste. Indeed, I make cooking and furniture-arranging\r\nan art. The emerald lettuce I mingle with the ruby radish; the carefully\r\nbrowned trout I surround with a wall of snowy and hot potatoes; the\r\nroseate shavings of beef and ham flank the golden butter, which is\r\nstamped in a very superior manner, I may say, with the American Eagle;\r\nthe amber honey sides with the royal purple of grape-jelly; and the\r\ncreamy biscuit contrasts with the deep chrome of the sponge-cake beside\r\nit, etc., etc. Of various pastries and _entrees_--of which I alone hold\r\nthe original recipes--I will not speak. Suffice to say, that it may be\r\nof interest to some housekeepers to send me a prepaid envelope!\r\n\r\nShould you go Minnehahaing this summer, I shall hope that you may fail\r\nto make connections with the St. Paul Packet Company, so that while\r\nwaiting a boat you may find it convenient to immortalize 'The Hermitage'\r\nby breaking fast beneath its humble roof.\r\n\r\n  Hermetically thine,\r\n  MARIE.\r\n\r\nWe would that we could. Alas! there is very little 'ha-ha-ing' of any\r\nkind this serious 'battle-summer'--least of all for us toward the rosy\r\nWest. Well, a time _may_ come, and when it does, of a verity the\r\nHermitage shall become well known to 'Esquire CONTINENTAL.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA CORRESPONDENT, whose style, by the way, is quaint enough to be printed\r\nwith black-letter, thus favors us with his protest against certain\r\nmerely 'bread-and-butter' notions of Woman:\r\n\r\n     I object to the current newspaper 'Advice for Girls.' A woman may\r\n     know how to cook, sweep, sew, tend babies; but is _this_ what a\r\n     young man--Spanish, _virgen_--most looks, or cares for, or thinks\r\n     of, when he seeks life-companionship--a Somebody to get him dinner,\r\n     tidy his room, fasten his shirt-buttons, and bear him children?\r\n     'Tis not for spread tables, kept house, mended clothes, nor\r\n     pleasure, that the young man's soul thirsts. For sympathy, for\r\n     love, for the object of his manliness, for its complement, for his\r\n     wife--and not a servant, nor a mistress.\r\n\r\n     He does indeed holily choose the mother of their little ones, but\r\n     newspaper-notice hints nothing of that; it teaches bodily, not\r\n     spiritually, and simply trains up a female able to bear offspring\r\n     of healthy flesh.\r\n\r\n     However, the husband requires a lover fit to join with him in\r\n     spirit also, for the total benefit of posterity.\r\n\r\n     The education which best suits a woman, then, is it carnal or\r\n     soulful? to make a kitchen-drudge or a soft-eyed maiden? a prudent\r\n     housewife or a thoughtful heartsweet? 'a special breeder' (POPE) or\r\n     a trusted bosomer? Cattle and machinery are for this labor-saving.\r\n     The true end of woman is feminity. Therefore, if she is any\r\n     brighter and heartsomer for playing in the fields, any more pensive\r\n     and sober for meditating there, who shall deny her God's free air\r\n     and sunshine?\r\n\r\n     If she is more delicate and softer to handle the light embroidery,\r\n     or plan the curious patchwork, who shall restrict her busy\r\n     ingenuity to garments of _wear_--coarse jackets, trowsers, shirts?\r\n\r\n     If she is more earnest and devoted for loving and suffering through\r\n     a romance, who shall hinder from reading and writing, or limit the\r\n     one to _Pilgrim's Progress_, the other to a letter, or confine her\r\n     pity to street-beggars, for whom alms-giving is act of charity not\r\n     more than tears are for imagined woes?\r\n\r\n     If she is more winning and tender by dwelling with old friendships\r\n     and memorable passages of trial or happiness, who shall fetter her\r\n     thoughts to the selfish indifference of the present, or the dull\r\n     routine of daily toil called duty?\r\n\r\n     If she is gentler and meeker, purer and loftier, Christlier, for\r\n     contemplating God and the angels, who can bind her conscience to\r\n     worship her husband or 'God in him'? (MILTON.)\r\n\r\n     Summarily and concisely, if she is more _womanly_, in any sort, for\r\n     doing, saying, thinking, whatsoever, howsoever, whithersoever, is\r\n     not what she ought the term and measure of what she may? or else\r\n     who shall presume to prescribe other bounds to her nature, and\r\n     undertake to restrain its ongoings in this or that direction?\r\n\r\n     Is female determined by male? woman's mind by the wind of man's\r\n     caprice? or both mutually interdetermined by the law of their\r\n     correlation, his wants and her capacities, her wants and his\r\n     abilities? And if he preaches utility, but she follows taste,\r\n     whether is to be concluded, that he needs more of practicality in\r\n     her, or she more of æstheticality in him? Is it that women lack\r\n     usefulness or that men lack beautifulness?\r\n\r\n     The sterner sex, by assuming to itself superior desires, can\r\n     stigmatize the other because the female disposition does not meet\r\n     its own; but truth and right may be much upon the other side. Women\r\n     may be nearer _standard_, just in this land and age, than men; and\r\n     their unsatisfied longings for handsome, chaste, and noble men are\r\n     swifter witnesses than all the low complaint about feminine finery\r\n     and extravagance. When men can seem to better understand that it is\r\n     not necessarily madness to prefer (as Nero) a fortune in marble to\r\n     a fortune in gold, or a Raphael's painting to 'money in the bank,'\r\n     when they shall come to recognize the utility of beauty and\r\n     holiness, then will not women be slow to acknowledge the use and\r\n     usefulness of so much utility.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHonor to Sigel! honor to Heintzelman! Whatever may have been said or\r\nsung against others, there is no doubt as to the ability, faithfulness,\r\nperseverance, and courage of these gallant _Deutschers_, and with them\r\nof many others of their glorious nation who have followed their national\r\nand instinctive hatred of tyranny, and taken part with us in battle\r\nagainst the South. Hurrah then for our German Generals. _Sigel soll\r\nleben, vivat hoch!_\r\n\r\n  Wir geh'n die Waffen in der Hand,\r\n  Zu retten unser Vaterland,\r\n       Und unser Kampf ist Sieg.\r\n  Wir tragen nicht Erober-Schwerdt,\r\n  Wir schützen Weib und Kind und Heerd,\r\n       Gerecht ist unser Krieg.\r\n\r\n  (ENGLISH.)\r\n\r\n  'We go with weapon in our hand,\r\n  And all to free our Father-land,\r\n       A victory is our fight.\r\n  We seek to win no foreign earth,\r\n  We fight for wife and child and hearth:\r\n       God knows our cause is right.'\r\n\r\nHow many hundreds of thousands of Germans are there to whom these lines\r\nhave become as applicable in this our 'Trans-Atlantic Germany' as when\r\nsung of old under the oaks of the Teuton father-land. When this battle\r\nshall be over, let every one bear in mind the good and faithful aid they\r\ngave us. Nor shall the Irish be forgotten, who with such desperate\r\ncourage have contributed so largely to swell our armies. They are in\r\nevery regiment, they have been foremost in every battle, their dead lie\r\non every field. Let those deny it who will, we should have fared badly\r\nenough had it not been for the Irish. They have shown themselves from\r\nthe beginning as presenting\r\n\r\n  'First fut on the flure,\r\n  First stick in the fight.'\r\n\r\nThey gave us the poet-warrior O'Brien, and the brave and generous\r\nKearney, and the noble Corcoran--but the list is too long. Honor to them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThere are many very good sort of people who will tell you, 'I don't like\r\nGermans,' or 'I don't like Irish!' We trust that this war will drive all\r\nsuch dislikes among us out of existence. Those who indulge in them are\r\ngenerally narrow-minded, un-cosmopolite sort of people. The principles\r\nof our day and of our war--the Republican principles--are opposed to all\r\nsuch illiberality. The Southerner, indeed, proposes to exclude all\r\nforeigners--it is his 'policy'--the Republican would give to the brain\r\nand muscle of every living being the fullest chance for development\r\n_every where_. Free Soil and Free Labor forever!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLiterature and religion have of late sustained a great loss in the death\r\nof Benjamin J. Wallace, D.D., which took place in Philadelphia August\r\nfirst. The deceased was a descendant of the great Harris family, which\r\nmay be almost said to have founded Western Pennsylvania, and which gave\r\na name to its largest city. Originally educated at West-Point, he\r\nsubsequently studied divinity at Princeton, distinguished himself as a\r\nNew-School clergyman in many States, especially in the West, was at one\r\ntime a professor at Delaware College, Newark, and was well known during\r\nthe later years of his life as editor of and contributor to that very\r\nable magazine, the Presbyterian _Quarterly Review_.\r\n\r\nWe had frequent opportunities of becoming familiar with the scope of Mr.\r\nWallace's abilities, and can testify that they were truly remarkable.\r\nApart from his theological learning he was a thorough and extremely\r\nvaried student of general literature; one familiar to a degree rare in\r\nthis country with Greek genius; a most able and ready writer; and above\r\nall, a man of strong belief; one who touched no subject on which he did\r\nnot write with sincerest interest.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace left a large circle of friends and a family to mourn a loss\r\nwhich all the friends of religion and of culture share in common with\r\nthem. It is seldom that the journalist is called on to record the death\r\nof any one who to natural gifts, aided by most excellent education,\r\nadded such a life of conscientious and modest industry. He was a true\r\nChristian and gentleman in all things.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe writer of the letter excerpted from in the following story, will\r\naccept our sincere thanks for the 'De Bow,' which, as he will find\r\n'other wheres,' has been turned to account by us:\r\n\r\n\r\n_New-Orleans, August 13th, 1862._\r\n\r\nDEAR CONTINENTAL: Let me give you a true version of an anecdote touching\r\nthe 'contraband' question: it may do for the Drawer.\r\n\r\nA rascally slave-jockey of this habitat procured an order for the\r\nrendition of a fugitive, who was supposed to be in the Quartermaster's\r\nemploy at the Custom-House, addressed to that functionary. Meanwhile the\r\nnegro, who had doubtless been there, had taken refuge in the hospital,\r\nwhither Jew pursued him with the same order, not doubting that the\r\nMajor-General's order was as good for one place as another. But Dr.\r\nSmith, it seems, thought otherwisely, for he coolly informed the\r\napplicant that _he_ was not Quartermaster, and declined to pay any\r\nattention to an order on that officer. Back to head-quarters travels\r\n'Shylock,' with his dishonored order and his complaint. The paper is\r\nforthwith returned with a curt indorsement and the assurance that 'that\r\nwill make it all right.' Thus fortified, he returned to the charge, and\r\ntriumphantly displaying the back of the paper only to Dr. Smith,\r\ndemanded his 'nigger.' Dr. Smith looked at the writing presented to him\r\nand read:\r\n\r\n'DR. SMITH: You will turn this man out at once.'\r\n\r\nThen to the Jockey: 'Here, I am ordered to turn you out of my house. Get\r\nout, sir, get out; get out of my house!' And as he stood petrified with\r\nastonishment at the apparent disrespect shown to the General's order,\r\nDr. Smith called out to the guard: 'Orderly, put this man out at the\r\ndoor, and see that he is not admitted again.' The fellow found his\r\ntongue at length, but the Doctor, who is no admirer of slave-hunters,\r\nwould not hear a word of remonstrance, and the discomfited trader was\r\nhustled down the stairs, shaking his order behind him, and spluttering\r\nout his wrath and disappointment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n'Grasp thy happiness and bear it with thee.' Is that Sanscrit or\r\nPersian? He who said that, had grasped a great truth. The Beautiful\r\nnever perishes to him that _wills_.\r\n\r\n\r\nONCE.\r\n\r\n  No matter when: enough that moon and stars\r\n    Shone as they shine to-night;\r\n  That tales of desolation and of wars,\r\n    Of struggle and of blight,\r\n  Like the low mutterings of a troublous dream,\r\n  Flitting across the still and peaceful night,\r\n    Glanced o'er my heart and thine!\r\n    The music of the pine--\r\n    The silver, witching stream\r\n  An impress deeper, left upon our hearts.\r\n  The murmuring song fell soothing on our ears;\r\n  The silver stream with beauty charmed our eyes;\r\n  And so we bade the tales of spears and darts,\r\n    With all their train of agony and tears,\r\n  Go to the winds; and leave us golden skies,\r\n  And brooks, and reaching hills, and 'lovers' leaps,'\r\n    With bold and rugged steeps;\r\n  And all the romance of 'enchanting scenes;'\r\n  For thou and I were--midway in our teens!\r\n\r\n  Once! breathe it softly, softly, O my heart!\r\n    And thou--my waiting one!\r\n  My unforgotten! wheresoe'er thou art--\r\n    My heart's unfading sun!\r\n  My guiding light beneath the storms and clouds;\r\n  My solace when the woods and hills are lone;\r\n  And the dark pine breathes out its saddening moan;\r\n  And when the night the misty mountain shrouds,\r\n  Breathe it still gently, wheresoe'er thou art,\r\n    Light of my fainting heart!\r\n\r\n  'Once!' stop, O wheels of time! upon the word!\r\n    Gather it in a knot of silken blue;\r\n  Bind it all fondly--with a nuptial cord,\r\n    Unto the widowed present! bear it through\r\n  All change--all chance! Love, friendship! hold it fast:\r\n  Let it no more be wedded to the past!\r\n    And human hearts through all life's checkered scenes,\r\n  Shall ever tarry 'midway in their teens'!\r\n\r\nWe find the following paragraph floating through our exchanges:\r\n\r\n     'The venerable John J. Crittenden was in town to-day, preparing to\r\n     start for home. I am sorry to hear that he speaks, to intimate\r\n     friends, very despondingly of our future prospects. This is not as\r\n     it should be. Public men, occupying seats in the high councils of\r\n     the nation, ought never to despair of the republic.'--_N. Y.\r\n     Letter._\r\n\r\nAnd _how_ else could the venerable compromiser be expected to speak? The\r\nman who dallies with death and destruction to the last moment--who is\r\nonly anxious to yield to an insolent and unscrupulous foe, is just the\r\none of all others who, when the struggle comes, wails and howls despair.\r\nTheir hearts were always with Southern aristocracy, these venerable\r\nSweetsops who would have gladly compromised Northern dignity and\r\nmanliness down to its very face in the mud before the devil himself, and\r\nthen have explained their course by referring to Christian example, as\r\nthough Christ himself had not dared death time and again, and finally\r\nsuffered it as an example that there _is_ a limit where it is _better_\r\nto perish than that evil should prevail over the truth.\r\n\r\nThey are all Southrons at heart. Did not the venerable John Bell, only\r\nthe other day, when he was offered a safe conduct by Federal forces out\r\nof Dixie, prefer to remain there? Of course he did. _Ubi bene ibi\r\npatria._ We feel and know instinctively where they belong and what they\r\nare, these men whose inordinate vanity of respectability so far\r\noutweighs their sense of truth, honor, and manhood. Very well taken off\r\nare they in a happy hit--author to us unknown--setting forth what they\r\nwould have agreed on in convention had they lived at the time of the\r\nfirst murder:\r\n\r\n     '_Resolved_, That we are equally opposed to the pretended piety and\r\n     evident fanaticism of Abel and the authorized violence of the\r\n     high-toned and chivalrous Cain.\r\n\r\n     '_Resolved_, That the 'Ultras' who are clamoring for the hanging of\r\n     Cain, which would only exasperate him, desire to destroy the\r\n     domestic happiness and peace of the family, and have no other\r\n     purpose in view.\r\n\r\n     '_Resolved_, That we are in favor of punishing both parties, and\r\n     invite all conservative men to unite with us in frowning down this\r\n     whole business.\r\n\r\n     '_Resolved_, That nobody has a right to provoke murder, and if Abel\r\n     had exhibited less fanaticism this one never would have occurred.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Apropos_ of which subject and which men, we are reminded of a rough and\r\nready poem by William Higgins:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPROMISER.\r\n\r\n  A cross between a man and slave\r\n    This mongrel thing produces,\r\n  Who deems himself ordained to save\r\n    The Union by sham truces.\r\n\r\n  In strife between the Wrong and Right\r\n    To hold the nation's border,\r\n  Ashamed to run, afraid to fight,\r\n    He faintly squeaks out 'Order!'\r\n\r\n  The boasted friend of quiet, peace,\r\n    He'd quell all agitation,\r\n  By giving Satan longer lease\r\n    Of earth, to damn the nation.\r\n\r\n  No matter, though the Scriptures teach\r\n    The golden rule of action,\r\n  He says 'tis but a fancy speech,\r\n    And proves it to a fraction!\r\n\r\n  He knows no 'Higher Law,' but thinks\r\n    State Rights the Catechism;\r\n  Which having learned by rote, he links\r\n    His practice to his schism.\r\n\r\n  And thus is fitted to proclaim,\r\n    With all his might and vigor,\r\n  Nor feel a single blush of shame,\r\n    'That chains become a nigger!'\r\n\r\n  With him, Religion is a boon,\r\n    That Slavery may diddle;\r\n  God's laws to those of John Calhoun,\r\n    Play only second-fiddle!\r\n\r\n  The faith for which his fathers bled,\r\n    And died to make him heir to,\r\n  He quite ignores, and takes instead\r\n    That leading God knows where to.\r\n\r\n  O compromiser! what a gleam\r\n    Of glory hangs about you!\r\n  No wonder that you proudly deem\r\n    The world would spoil without you!\r\n\r\n  With supple knees to slavery bent,\r\n    Your conscience hangs on hinges,\r\n  And gives mild treason easy vent,\r\n    Despite compunction's twinges!\r\n\r\nRude but true.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the Industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 60 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. Dairy Farming also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\nThe experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant.\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n  80 acres at $10 per acre, with interest at 6 per ct. annually\r\n  on the following terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $48 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           48 00\r\n     \"    in two years          48 00\r\n     \"    in three years        48 00\r\n     \"    in four years        236 00\r\n     \"    in five years        224 00\r\n     \"    in six years         212 00\r\n\r\n\r\n  40 acres, at $10 00 per acre:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $24 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           24 00\r\n     \"    in two years          24 00\r\n     \"    in three years        24 00\r\n     \"    in four years        118 00\r\n     \"    in five years        112 00\r\n     \"    in six years         106 00\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNumber 11.                          25 Cents.\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL\r\n\r\nMONTHLY\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVOTED TO LITERATURE and NATIONAL POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK:\r\n\r\nJOHN F.

Devoted to the NATIONAL CAUSE, it will\r\nardently and unconditionally support the UNION. Its scope will be\r\nenlarged by articles relating to our public defences, Army and Navy,\r\ngunboats, railroads, canals, finance, and currency. The cause of gradual\r\nemancipation and colonization will be cordially sustained. The literary\r\ncharacter of the Magazine will be improved, and nothing which talent,\r\nmoney, and industry combined can achieve, will be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe political department will be controlled by HON. ROBERT J. WALKER and\r\nHON. FREDERIC P. STANTON, of Washington, D.C. Mr. WALKER, after serving\r\nnine years as Senator, and four years as Secretary of the Treasury, was\r\nsucceeded in the Senate by JEFFERSON DAVIS. Mr. STANTON served ten years\r\nin Congress, acting as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and of Naval\r\nAffairs. Mr. WALKER was succeeded as Governor of Kansas by Mr. STANTON,\r\nand both were displaced by Mr. BUCHANAN, for refusing to force slavery\r\nupon that people by fraud and forgery. The literary department of the\r\nMagazine will be under the control of CHARLES GODFREY LELAND of Boston,\r\nand EDMOND KIRKE of New York. Mr. LELAND is the present accomplished\r\nEditor of the Magazine. Mr. KIRKE is one of its constant contributors,\r\nbut better known as the author of \"Among the Pines,\" the great picture,\r\ntrue to life, of Slavery as it is.\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL, while retaining all the old corps of writers, who have\r\ngiven it so wide a circulation, will be reënforced by new contributors,\r\ngreatly distinguished as statesmen, scholars, and savans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENTERED, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1862, by JAMES R.\r\nGILMORE, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United\r\nStates for the Southern District of New York.",
