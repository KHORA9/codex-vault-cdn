Whipple\r\n\r\n1923\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of the present volume is not to supersede the standard\r\nedition of Daniel Webster's Works, in six octavo volumes, edited by\r\nEdward Everett, and originally issued in the year 1851, by the\r\npublishers of this volume of Selections. It is rather the purpose of the\r\npresent publication to call attention anew to the genius and character\r\nof Daniel Webster, as a lawyer, statesman, diplomatist, patriot, and,\r\ncitizen, and, by republishing some of his prominent orations and\r\nspeeches of universally acknowledged excellence, to revive public\r\ninterest in the great body of his works. In the task of selection, it\r\nhas been impossible to do full justice to his powers; for among the\r\nspeeches omitted in this collection are to be found passages of\r\nsuperlative eloquence, maxims of political and moral wisdom which might\r\nbe taken as mottoes for elaborate treatises on the philosophy of law and\r\nlegislation, and important facts and principles which no student of\r\nhistory of the United States can overlook without betraying an ignorance\r\nof the great forces which influenced the legislation of the two Houses\r\nof Congress, from the time Mr. Webster first entered public life to the\r\nday of his death.\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed that, when Mr. Everett consented to edit the six\r\nvolumes of his works, Mr. Webster indicated to him the orations,\r\nspeeches, and diplomatic despatches which he really thought might be of\r\nservice to the public, and that he intended them as a kind of legacy,--a\r\nbequest to his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe publishers of this volume believe that a study of Mr. Webster's\r\nmind, heart, and character, as exhibited in the selections contained in\r\nthe present volume, will inevitably direct all sympathetic readers to\r\nthe great body of Mr. Webster's works. Among the eminent men who have\r\ninfluenced legislative assemblies in Great Britain and the United\r\nStates, during the past hundred and twenty years, it is curious that\r\nonly two have established themselves as men of the first class in\r\nEnglish and American literature. These two men are Edmund Burke and\r\nDaniel Webster; and it is only by the complete study of every thing\r\nwhich they authorized to be published under their names, that we can\r\nadequately comprehend either their position among the political forces\r\nof their time, or their rank among the great masters of English\r\neloquence and style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANIEL

Both boys at school and young men in college show no lack of\r\npower in speaking their native language with a vehemence and fluency\r\nwhich almost stuns the ears of their seniors. Why, then, should they\r\nfind such difficulty in writing it? When you listen to the animated talk\r\nof a bright school-boy or college student, full of a subject which\r\nreally interests him, you say at once that such command of racy and\r\nidiomatic English words must of course be exhibited in his\r\n\"compositions\" or his \"themes\"; but when the latter are examined, they\r\nare commonly found to be feeble and lifeless, with hardly a thought or a\r\nword which bears any stamp of freshness or originality, and which are so\r\ninferior to his ordinary conversation, that we can hardly believe they\r\ncame from the same mind.\r\n\r\nThe first quality which strikes an examiner of these exercises in\r\nEnglish composition is their _falseness_. No boy or youth writes what he\r\npersonally thinks and feels, but writes what a good boy or youth is\r\nexpected to think or feel. This hypocrisy vitiates his writing from\r\nfirst to last, and is not absent in his \"Class Oration,\" or in his\r\n\"Speech at Commencement.\" I have a vivid memory of the first time the\r\nboys of my class, in a public school, were called upon to write\r\n\"composition.\" The themes selected were the prominent moral virtues or\r\nvices. How we poor innocent urchins were tormented by the task imposed\r\nupon us! How we put more ink on our hands and faces than we shed upon\r\nthe white paper on our desks! Our conclusions generally agreed with\r\nthose announced by the greatest moralists of the world. Socrates and\r\nPlato, Cicero and Seneca, Cudworth and Butler, could not have been more\r\nausterely moral than were we little rogues, as we relieved the immense\r\nexertion involved in completing a single short baby-like sentence, by\r\nshying at one companion a rule, or hurling at another a paper pellet\r\nintended to light plump on his forehead or nose. Our custom was to begin\r\nevery composition with the proposition that such or such a virtue \"was\r\none of the greatest blessings we enjoy\"; and this triumph of accurate\r\nstatement was not discovered by our teacher to be purely mechanical,\r\nuntil one juvenile thinker, having avarice to deal with, declared it to\r\nbe \"one of the greatest evils we enjoy.\" The whole thing was such a\r\npiece of monstrous hypocrisy, that I once timidly suggested to the\r\nschoolmaster that it would be well to allow me to select my own subject.\r\nThe request was granted; and, as narrative is the natural form of\r\ncomposition which a boy adopts when he has his own way, I filled, in\r\nless than half the time heretofore consumed in writing a quarter of a\r\npage, four pages of letter-paper with an account of my being in a ship\r\ntaken by a pirate; of the heroic defiance I launched at the pirate\r\ncaptain; and the sagacity I evinced in escaping the fate of my\r\nfellow-passengers, in not being ordered to \"walk the plank.\" The story,\r\nthough trashy enough, was so much better than any of the moral essays of\r\nthe other pupils, that the teacher commanded me to read it before the\r\nwhole school, as an evidence of the rapid strides I had made in the art\r\nof \"composition.\"\r\n\r\nThis falseness of thought and feeling is but too apt to characterize the\r\nwriting of the student, after he has passed from the common school to\r\nthe academy or the college. The term \"Sophomorical\" is used to describe\r\nspeeches which are full of emotion which the speaker does not feel, full\r\nof words in four or five syllables that mean nothing, and, in respect to\r\nimagery and illustrations, blazing with the cheap jewelry of\r\nrhetoric,--with those rubies and diamonds that can be purchased for a\r\nfew pennies an ounce. The danger is that this \"Sophomorical\" style may\r\ncontinue to afflict the student after he has become a clergyman, a\r\nlawyer, or a legislator.\r\n\r\nPractical men who may not be \"college educated\" still have the great\r\nvirtue of using the few words they employ as identical with facts. When\r\nthey meet a man who has half the dictionary at his disposal, and yet\r\ngives no evidence of apprehending the real import and meaning of one\r\nword among the many thousands he glibly pours forth, they naturally\r\ndistrust him, as a person who does not know the vital connection of all\r\ngood words with the real things they represent. Indeed, the best rule\r\nthat a Professor of Rhetoric could adopt would be to insist that no\r\nstudent under his care should use an unusual word until he had _earned\r\nthe right to use it_ by making it the verbal sign of some new advance in\r\nhis thinking, in his acquirements, or in his feelings. Shakspeare, the\r\ngreatest of English writers, and perhaps the greatest of all writers,\r\nrequired fifteen thousand words to embody all that his vast exceptional\r\nintelligence acquired, thought, imagined, and discovered; and he had\r\nearned the right to use every one of them. Milton found that eight\r\nthousand words could fairly and fully represent all the power, grandeur,\r\nand creativeness of his almost seraphic soul, when he attempted to\r\nexpress his whole nature in a literary form. All the words used by\r\nShakspeare and Milton are _alive_; \"cut them and they will _bleed_.\" But\r\nit is ridiculous for a college student to claim that he has the mighty\r\nresources of the English language at his supreme disposal, when he has\r\nnot verified, by his own thought, knowledge, and experience, one in a\r\nhundred of the words he presumptuously employs.\r\n\r\nNow Daniel Webster passed safely through all the stages of the\r\n\"Sophomoric\" disease of the mind, as he passed safely through the\r\nmeasles, the chicken-pox, and other eruptive maladies incident to\r\nchildhood and youth. The process, however, by which he purified his\r\nstyle from this taint, and made his diction at last as robust and as\r\nmanly, as simple and as majestic, as the nature it expressed, will\r\nreward a little study.\r\n\r\nThe mature style of Webster is perfect of its kind, being in words the\r\nexpress image of his mind and character,--plain, terse, clear, forcible;\r\nand rising from the level of lucid statement and argument into passages\r\nof superlative eloquence only when his whole nature is stirred by some\r\ngrand sentiment of freedom, patriotism, justice, humanity, or religion,\r\nwhich absolutely lifts him, by its own inherent force and inspiration,\r\nto a region above that in which his mind habitually lives and moves. At\r\nthe same time it will be observed that these thrilling passages, which\r\nthe boys of two generations have ever been delighted to declaim in their\r\nshrillest tones, are strictly illustrative of the main purpose of the\r\nspeech in which they appear. They are not mere purple patches of\r\nrhetoric, loosely stitched on the homespun gray of the reasoning, but\r\nthey seem to be inwoven with it and to be a vital part of it. Indeed we\r\ncan hardly decide, in reading these magnificent bursts of eloquence in\r\nconnection with what precedes and follows them, whether the effect is\r\ndue to the logic of the orator becoming suddenly morally impassioned, or\r\nto his moral passion becoming suddenly logical. What gave Webster his\r\nimmense influence over the opinions of the people of New England was,\r\nfirst, his power of so \"putting things\" that everybody could understand\r\nhis statements; secondly, his power of so framing his arguments that all\r\nthe steps, from one point to another, in a logical series, could be\r\nclearly apprehended by every intelligent farmer or mechanic who had a\r\nthoughtful interest in the affairs of the country; and thirdly, his\r\npower of inflaming the sentiment of patriotism in all honest and\r\nwell-intentioned men by overwhelming appeals to that sentiment, so that,\r\nafter convincing their understandings, he clinched the matter by\r\nsweeping away their wills.\r\n\r\nPerhaps to these sources of influence may be added another which many\r\neminent statesmen have lacked. With all his great superiority to average\r\nmen in force and breadth of mind, he had a genuine respect for the\r\nintellect, as well as for the manhood, of average men. He disdained the\r\nignoble office of misleading the voters he aimed to instruct; and the\r\nfarmers and mechanics who read his speeches felt ennobled when they\r\nfound that the greatest statesman of the country frankly addressed them,\r\nas man to man, without pluming himself on his exceptional talents and\r\naccomplishments. Up to the crisis of 1850, he succeeded in domesticating\r\nhimself at most of the pious, moral, and intelligent firesides of New\r\nEngland. Through his speeches he seemed to be almost bodily present\r\nwherever the family, gathered in the evening around the blazing hearth,\r\ndiscussed the questions of the day. It was not the great Mr. Webster,\r\n\"the godlike Daniel,\" who had a seat by the fire. It was a person who\r\ntalked _to_ them, and argued _with_ them, as though he was \"one of the\r\nfolks,\"--a neighbor dropping in to make an evening call; there was not\r\nthe slightest trace of assumption in his manner; but suddenly, after the\r\ndiscussion had become a little tiresome, certain fiery words would leap\r\nfrom his lips and make the whole household spring to their feet, ready\r\nto sacrifice life and property for \"the Constitution and the Union.\"\r\nThat Webster was thus a kind of invisible presence in thousands of homes\r\nwhere his face was never seen, shows that his rhetoric had caught an\r\nelement of power from his early recollections of the independent,\r\nhard-headed farmers whom he met when a boy in his father's house. The\r\nbodies of these men had become tough and strong in their constant\r\nstruggle to force scanty harvests from an unfruitful soil, which only\r\npersistent toil could compel to yield any thing; and their brains,\r\nthough forcible and clear, were still not stored with the important\r\nfacts and principles which it was his delight to state and expound. In\r\ntruth, he ran a race with the demagogues of his time in an attempt to\r\ncapture such men as these, thinking them the very backbone of the\r\ncountry. Whether he succeeded or failed, it would be vain to hunt\r\nthrough his works to find a single epithet in which he mentioned them\r\nwith contempt. He was as incapable of insulting one member of this\r\nlanded democracy,--sterile as most of their acres were,--as of insulting\r\nthe memory of his father, who belonged to this class.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Peter Harvey used to tell with much zest a story\r\nillustrating the hold which these early associations retained on\r\nWebster's mind throughout his life. Some months after his removal from\r\nPortsmouth to Boston, a servant knocked at his chamber door late in an\r\nApril afternoon in the year 1817, with the announcement that three men\r\nwere in the drawing-room who insisted on seeing him. Webster was\r\noverwhelmed with fatigue, the result of his Congressional labors and his\r\nattendance on courts of law; and he had determined, after a night's\r\nsleep, to steal a vacation in order to recruit his energies by a\r\nfortnight's fishing and hunting. He suspected that the persons below\r\nwere expectant clients; and he resolved, in descending the stairs, not\r\nto accept their offer. He found in the parlor three plain, country-bred,\r\nhonest-looking men, who were believers in the innocence of Levi and\r\nLaban Kenniston, accused of robbing a certain Major Goodridge on the\r\nhighway, and whose trial would take place at Ipswich the next day. They\r\ncould find, they said, no member of the Essex bar who would undertake\r\nthe defence of the Kennistons, and they had come to Boston to engage the\r\nservices of Mr. Webster. Would he go down to Ipswich and defend the\r\naccused? Mr. Webster stated that he could not and would not go. He had\r\nmade arrangements for an excursion to the sea-side; the state of his\r\nhealth absolutely demanded a short withdrawal from all business cares;\r\nand that no fee could tempt him to abandon his purpose. \"Well,\" was the\r\nreply of one of the delegation, \"it isn't the fee that we think of at\r\nall, though we are willing to pay what you may charge; but it's justice.\r\nHere are two New Hampshire men who are believed in Exeter, and Newbury,\r\nand Newburyport, and Salem to be rascals; but we in Newmarket believe,\r\nin spite of all evidence against them, that they are the victims of some\r\nconspiracy. We think you are the man to unravel it, though it seems a\r\ngood deal tangled even to us. Still we suppose that men whom we know to\r\nhave been honest all their lives can't have become such desperate rogues\r\nall of a sudden.\" \"But I cannot take the case,\" persisted Mr. Webster;\r\n\"I am worn to death with over-work. I have not had any real sleep for\r\nforty-eight hours. Besides, I know nothing of the case.\" \"It's hard, I\r\ncan see,\" continued the leader of the delegation; \"but you're a New\r\nHampshire man, and the _neighbors_ thought that you would not allow two\r\ninnocent New Hampshire men, however humble they may be in their\r\ncircumstances, to suffer for lack of your skill in exposing the wiles of\r\nthis scoundrel Goodridge. The _neighbors_ all desire you to take the\r\ncase.\" That phrase \"the neighbors\" settled the question. No resident of\r\na city knows what the phrase means. But Webster knew it in all the\r\nintense significance of its meaning. His imagination flew back to the\r\nscattered homesteads of a New England village, where mutual sympathy and\r\nassistance are the necessities, as they are the commonplaces, of village\r\nlife. The phrase remotely meant to him the combination of neighbors to\r\nresist an assault of Indian savages, or to send volunteers to the war\r\nwhich wrought the independence of the nation. It specially meant to him\r\nthe help of neighbor to neighbor, in times of sickness, distress,\r\nsorrow, and calamity. In his childhood and boyhood the Christian\r\nquestion, \"Who is my neighbor?\" was instantly solved the moment a matron\r\nin good health heard that the wife of Farmer A, or Farmer B, was\r\nstricken down by fever, and needed a friendly nurse to sit by her\r\nbedside all night, though she had herself been toiling hard all day.\r\nEvery thing philanthropists mean when they talk of brotherhood and\r\nsisterhood among men and women was condensed in that homely phrase, \"the\r\nneighbors.\" \"Oh!\" said Webster, ruefully, \"if the neighbors think I may\r\nbe of service, of course I must go\";--and, with his three companions, he\r\nwas soon seated in the stage for Ipswich, where he arrived at about\r\nmidnight. The court met the next morning; and his management of the case\r\nis still considered one of his masterpieces of legal acumen and\r\neloquence. His cross-examination of Goodridge rivalled, in mental\r\ntorture, every thing martyrologists tell us of the physical agony\r\nendured by the victim of the inquisitor, when roasted before slow fires\r\nor stretched upon the rack. Still it seemed impossible to assign any\r\nmotive for the self-robbery and the self-maiming of Goodridge, which any\r\njudge or jury would accept as reasonable. The real motive has never been\r\ndiscovered. Webster argued that the motive might have originated in a\r\ndesire to escape from the payment of his debts, or in a whimsical\r\nambition to have his name sounded all over Maine and Massachusetts as\r\nthe heroic tradesman who had parted with his money only when overpowered\r\nby superior force. It is impossible to say what motives may impel men\r\nwho are half-crazed by vanity, or half-demonized by malice. Coleridge\r\ndescribes Iago's hatred of Othello as the hatred which a base nature\r\ninstinctively feels for a noble one, and his assignment of motives for\r\nhis acts as the mere \"motive-hunting of a motiveless malignity.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been Goodridge's motive in his attempt to ruin the\r\ninnocent men he falsely accused, it is certain that Webster saved these\r\nmen from the unjust punishment of an imputed crime. Only the skeleton of\r\nhis argument before the jury has been preserved; but what we have of it\r\nevidently passed under his revision. He knew that the plot of Goodridge\r\nhad been so cunningly contrived, that every man of the twelve before\r\nhim, whose verdict was to determine the fate of his clients, was\r\ninwardly persuaded of their guilt. Some small marked portions of the\r\nmoney which Goodridge swore he had on his person on the night of the\r\npretended robbery were found in their house. Circumstantial evidence\r\nbrought their guilt with a seemingly irresistible force literally \"home\"\r\nto them. It was the conviction of the leaders of the Essex bar that no\r\nrespectable lawyer could appear in their defence without becoming, in\r\nsome degree, their accomplice. But Webster, after damaging the character\r\nof the prosecutor by his stern cross-examination, addressed the jury,\r\nnot as an advocate bearing down upon them with his arguments and\r\nappeals, but rather as a thirteenth juryman, who had cosily introduced\r\nhimself into their company, and was arguing the case with them after\r\nthey had retired for consultation among themselves. The simplicity of\r\nthe language employed is not more notable than the power evinced in\r\nseizing the main points on which the question of guilt or innocence\r\nturned. At every quiet but deadly stab aimed at the theory of the\r\nprosecution, he is careful to remark, that \"it is for the jury to say\r\nunder their oaths\" whether such inconsistencies or improbabilities\r\nshould have any effect on their minds. Every strong argument closes with\r\nthe ever-recurring phrase, \"It is for the jury to say\"; and, at the end,\r\nthe jury, thoroughly convinced, said, \"Not guilty.\" The Kennistons were\r\nvindicated; and the public, which had been almost unanimous in declaring\r\nthem fit tenants for the State prison, soon blamed the infatuation which\r\nhad made them the accomplices of a villain in hunting down two\r\nunoffending citizens, and of denouncing every lawyer who should\r\nundertake their defence as a legal rogue.\r\n\r\nThe detected scoundrel fled from the place where his rascality had been\r\nexposed, to seek some other locality, where the mingled jeers and curses\r\nof his dupes would be unheard. Some twenty years after the trial, Mr.\r\nWebster, while travelling in Western New York, stopped at an obscure\r\nvillage tavern to get a glass of water. The hand of the man behind the\r\nbar, who gave it to him, trembled violently; and Webster, wondering at\r\nthe cause, looked the fellow steadily in the eye. He recognized\r\nGoodridge, and understood at once that Goodridge had just before\r\nrecognized _him_. Not a word passed between the felon and the intrepid\r\nadvocate who had stripped his villany of all its plausible disguises;\r\nbut what immense meaning must there have been in the swift interchange\r\nof feeling as their eyes met! Mr. Webster entered his carriage and\r\nproceeded on his journey; but Goodridge,--who has since ever heard of\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nThis story is a slight digression, but it illustrates that hold on\r\nreality, that truth to fact, which was one of the sources of the force\r\nand simplicity of Mr. Webster's mature style. He, however, only obtained\r\nthese good qualities of rhetoric by long struggles with constant\r\ntemptations, in his early life, to use resounding expressions and\r\nflaring images which he had not earned the right to use. His Fourth of\r\nJuly oration at Hanover, when he was only eighteen, and his college\r\naddresses, must have been very bad in their diction if we can judge of\r\nthem by the style of his private correspondence at the time. The verses\r\nhe incorporates in his letters are deformed by all the faults of false\r\nthinking and borrowed expression which characterized contemporary\r\nAmerican imitators of English imitators of Pope and Gray. Think of the\r\nfuture orator, lawyer, and senator writing, even at the age of twenty,\r\nsuch balderdash as this!\r\n\r\n    \"And Heaven grant me, whatever luck betide,\r\n    Be fame or fortune given or denied,\r\n    Some cordial friend to meet my warm desire,\r\n    Honest as John and good as Nehemiah.\"\r\n\r\nIn reading such couplets we are reminded of the noted local poet of New\r\nHampshire (or was it Maine?) who wrote \"The Shepherd's Songs,\" and some\r\nof whose rustic lines still linger in the memory to be laughed at, such,\r\nfor instance, as these:--\r\n\r\n    \"This child who perished in the fire,--\r\n    His father's name was Nehemiah.\"\r\n\r\nOr these:--\r\n\r\n    \"Napoleon, that great ex_ile_,\r\n    Who scoured all Europe like a file.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Webster's prose was then almost as bad as his verse, though it was\r\nmodelled on what was considered fine writing at the opening of the\r\npresent century. He writes to his dearest student friends in a style\r\nwhich is profoundly insincere, though the thoughts are often good, and\r\nthe fact of his love for his friends cannot be doubted. He had committed\r\nto memory Fisher Ames's noble speech on the British Treaty, and had\r\nprobably read some of Burke's great pamphlets on the French Revolution.\r\nThe stripling statesman aimed to talk in their high tone and in their\r\nrichly ornamented language, before he had earned the right even to mimic\r\ntheir style of expression. There is a certain swell in some of his long\r\nsentences, and a kind of good sense in some of his short ones, which\r\nsuggest that the writer is a youth endowed with elevation as well as\r\nstrength of nature, and is only making a fool of himself because he\r\nthinks he must make a fool of himself in order that he may impress his\r\ncorrespondents with the idea that he is a master of the horrible jargon\r\nwhich all bright young fellows at that time innocently supposed to\r\nconstitute eloquence. Thus, in February, 1800, he writes thus to his\r\nfriend Bingham: \"In my melancholy moments I presage the most dire\r\ncalamities. I already see in my imagination the time when the banner of\r\ncivil war shall be unfurled; when Discord's hydra form shall set up her\r\nhideous yell, and from her hundred mouths shall howl destruction through\r\nour empire; and when American blood shall be made to flow in rivers by\r\nAmerican swords! But propitious Heaven prevent such dreadful calamities!\r\nInternally secure, we have nothing to fear. Let Europe pour her\r\nembattled millions around us, let her thronged cohorts cover our shores,\r\nfrom St. Lawrence to St. Marie's, yet United Columbia shall stand\r\nunmoved; the manes of her deceased Washington shall guard the liberties\r\nof his country, and direct the sword of freedom in the day of battle.\"\r\nAnd think of this, not in a Fourth of July oration, but in a private\r\nletter to an intimate acquaintance! The bones of Daniel Webster might be\r\nsupposed to have moved in their coffin at the thought that this\r\nmiserable trash--so regretted and so amply atoned for--should have ever\r\nseen the light; but it is from such youthful follies that we measure the\r\nvigor of the man who outgrows them.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that Webster, after he was admitted to the bar, came\r\ninto constant collision, in the courts of New Hampshire, with one of the\r\ngreatest masters of the common law that the country has ever produced,\r\nJeremiah Mason. It has been said that Mr. Mason educated Webster into a\r\nlawyer by opposing him. He did more than this; he cured Webster of all\r\nthe florid foolery of his early rhetorical style. Of all men that ever\r\nappeared before a jury, Mason was the most pitiless realist, the most\r\nterrible enemy of what is--in a slang term as vile almost as\r\nitself--called \"Hifalutin\"; and woe to the opposing lawyer who indulged\r\nin it! He relentlessly pricked all rhetorical bubbles, reducing them at\r\nonce to the small amount of ignominious suds, which the orator's breath\r\nhad converted into colored globes, having some appearance of stability\r\nas well as splendor. Six feet and seven inches high, and corpulent in\r\nproportion, this inexorable representative of good sense and sound law\r\nstood, while he was arguing a case, \"quite near to the jury,\" says\r\nWebster,--\"so near that he might have laid his finger on the foreman's\r\nnose; and then he talked to them in a plain conversational way, in short\r\nsentences, and using no word that was not level to the comprehension of\r\nthe least educated man on the panel. This led me,\" he adds, \"to examine\r\nmy own style, and I set about reforming it altogether.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mason was what the lawyers call a \"cause-getting man,\" like Sir\r\nJames Scarlett, Brougham's great opponent at the English bar. It was\r\nsaid of Scarlett, that he gained his verdicts because there were twelve\r\nScarletts in the jury-box; and Mason so contrived to blend his stronger\r\nmind with the minds of the jurymen, that his thoughts appeared to be\r\ntheirs, expressed in the same simple words and quaint illustrations\r\nwhich they would have used if asked to give their opinions on the case.\r\nIt is to be added, that Mason's almost cynical disregard of ornament in\r\nhis addresses to the jury gave to an opponent like Webster the advantage\r\nof availing himself of those real ornaments of speech which spring\r\ndirectly from a great heart and imagination. Webster, without ever\r\nbecoming so supremely plain and simple in style as Mason, still strove\r\nto emulate, in his legal statements and arguments, the homely, robust\r\ncommon-sense of his antagonist; but, wherever the case allowed of it, he\r\nbrought into the discussion an element of _un_-common sense, the gift of\r\nhis own genius and individuality, which Mason could hardly comprehend\r\nsufficiently to controvert, but which was surely not without its effect\r\nin deciding the verdicts of juries.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that Webster was one of the few lawyers and statesmen\r\nthat Mason respected. Mason's curt, sharp, \"vitriolic\" sarcasms on many\r\nmen who enjoyed a national reputation, and who were popularly considered\r\nthe lights of their time, still remain in the memories of his surviving\r\nassociates, as things which may be quoted in conversation, but which it\r\nwould be cruel to put into print. Of Webster, however, he never seems to\r\nhave spoken a contemptuous word. Indeed, Mason, though fourteen years\r\nolder than Webster, and fighting him at the Portsmouth bar with all the\r\nformidable force of his logic and learning, was from the first his\r\ncordial friend. That friendship, early established between strong\r\nnatures so opposite in character, was never disturbed by any collision\r\nin the courts. In a letter written, I think, a few weeks after he had\r\nmade that \"Reply to Hayne\" which is conceded to be one of the great\r\nmasterpieces of eloquence in the recorded oratory of the world, Webster\r\nwrote jocularly to Mason: \"I have been written to, to go to New\r\nHampshire, to try a cause against you next August.... If it were an easy\r\nand plain case on our side, I might be willing to go; but I have some of\r\nyour _pounding in my bones yet_, and I don't care about any more till\r\nthat wears out.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be said that Webster's argument in the celebrated \"Dartmouth\r\nCollege Case,\" before the Supreme Court of the United States, placed\r\nhim, at the age of thirty-six, in the foremost rank of the\r\nconstitutional lawyers of the country. For the main points of the\r\nreasoning, and for the exhaustive citation of authorities by which the\r\nreasoning was sustained, he was probably indebted to Mason, who had\r\npreviously argued the case before the Superior Court of New Hampshire;\r\nbut his superiority to Mason was shown in the eloquence, the moral\r\npower, he infused into his reasoning, so as to make the dullest citation\r\nof legal authority _tell_ on the minds he addressed.\r\n\r\nThere is one incident connected with this speech which proves what\r\nimmense force is given to simple words when a great man--great in his\r\nemotional nature as well as great in logical power--is behind the words.\r\n\"It is, sir, as I have said, a small college. And yet there are those\r\nwho love it.\" At this point the orator's lips quivered, his voice\r\nchoked, his eyes filled with tears,--all the memories of sacrifices\r\nendured by his father and mother, his brothers and sisters, in order\r\nthat he might enjoy its rather scanty advantages of a liberal education,\r\nand by means of which he was there to plead its cause before the supreme\r\ntribunal of the nation, rushed suddenly upon his mind in an overwhelming\r\nflood. The justices of the Supreme Court--great lawyers, tried and\r\ntoughened by experience into a certain obdurate sense of justice, and\r\ninsensible to any common appeal to their hearts--melted into unwonted\r\ntenderness, as, in broken words, the advocate proceeded to state his own\r\nindebtedness to the \"small college,\" whose rights and privileges he was\r\nthere to defend. Chief Justice Marshall's eyes were filled with tears;\r\nand the eyes of the other justices were suffused with a moisture similar\r\nto that which afflicted the eyes of the Chief. As the orator gradually\r\nrecovered his accustomed stern composure of manner, he turned to the\r\ncounsel on the other side,--one of whom, at least, was a graduate of\r\nDartmouth,--and in his deepest and most thrilling tones, thus concluded\r\nhis argument: \"Sir, I know not how others may feel; but for myself, when\r\nI see my Alma Mater surrounded, like Caesar in the senate-house, by\r\nthose who are reiterating stab after stab, I would not, for this right\r\nhand, have her turn to me and say, _Et tu quoque, mi fili!_--And thou\r\ntoo, my son.\" The effect was overwhelming; yet by what simple means was\r\nit produced, and with what small expenditure of words! The eloquence was\r\nplainly \"in the man, in the subject, and in the occasion,\" but most\r\nemphatically was it in the MAN.\r\n\r\nWebster's extreme solicitude to make his style thoroughly\r\n_Websterian_--a style unimitated because it is in itself inimitable--is\r\nobservable in the care he took in revising all his speeches and\r\naddresses which were published under his own authority. His great\r\nPlymouth oration of 1820 did not appear in a pamphlet form until a year\r\nafter its delivery. The chief reason of this delay was probably due to\r\nhis desire of stating the main political idea of the oration, that\r\ngovernment is founded on property, so clearly that it could not be\r\nmisconceived by any honest mind, and could only be perverted from its\r\nplain democratic meaning by the ingenious malignity of such minds as are\r\ndeliberately dishonest, and consider lying as justifiable when lying\r\nwill serve a party purpose. It is probable that Webster would have been\r\nPresident of the United States had it not been for one short sentence in\r\nthis oration,--\"Government is founded on property.\" It was of no use for\r\nhis political friends to prove that he founded on this general\r\nproposition the most democratic views as to the distribution of\r\nproperty, and advised the enactment of laws calculated to frustrate the\r\naccumulation of large fortunes in a few hands. There were the words,\r\nwords horrible to the democratic imagination, and Webster was proclaimed\r\nan aristocrat, and an enemy to the common people. But the delay in the\r\npublication of the oration may also be supposed to have been due to his\r\ndesire to prune all its grand passages of eloquence of every epithet and\r\nimage which should not be rigorously exact as expressions of his genuine\r\nsentiments and principles. It is probable that the Plymouth oration, as\r\nwe possess it in print, is a better oration, in respect to composition,\r\nthan that which was heard by the applauding crowd before which it was\r\noriginally delivered. It is certain that the largeness, the grandeur,\r\nthe weight of Webster's whole nature, were first made manifest to the\r\nintelligent portion of his countrymen by this noble commemorative\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nYet it is also certain that he was not himself altogether satisfied with\r\nthis oration; and his dissatisfaction with some succeeding popular\r\nspeeches, memorable in the annals of American eloquence, was expressed\r\nprivately to his friends in the most emphatic terms. On the day he\r\ncompleted his magnificent Bunker Hill oration, delivered on the 17th of\r\nJune, 1825, he wrote to Mr. George Ticknor: \"I did the deed this\r\nmorning, i.e. I finished my speech; and I am pretty well persuaded that\r\nit will _finish_ me as far as reputation is concerned. There is no more\r\ntone in it than in the weather in which it has been written; it is\r\nperpetual dissolution and thaw.\" Every critic will understand the force\r\nof that word \"tone.\" He seemed to feel that it had not enough robust\r\nmanliness,--that the ribs and backbone, the facts, thoughts, and real\r\nsubstance of the address, were not sufficiently prominent, owing to the\r\nfrequency of those outbursts of magnetic eloquence, which made the\r\nimmense audience that listened to it half crazy with the vehemence of\r\ntheir applause. On the morning after he had delivered his eulogy on\r\nAdams and Jefferson, he entered his office with his manuscript in his\r\nhand, and threw it down on the desk of a young student at law whom he\r\nspecially esteemed, with the request, \"There, Tom, please to take that\r\ndiscourse, and weed out all the Latin words.\"\r\n\r\nWebster's liking for the Saxon element of our composite language was,\r\nhowever, subordinate to his main purpose of self-expression. Every word\r\nwas good, whether of Saxon or Latin derivation, which aided him to\r\nembody the mood of mind dominant at the time he was speaking or writing.\r\nNo man had less of what has been called \"the ceremonial cleanliness of\r\nacademical pharisees;\" and the purity of expression he aimed at was to\r\nput into a form, at once intelligible and tasteful, his exact thoughts\r\nand emotions. He tormented reporters, proof-readers, and the printers\r\nwho had the misfortune to be engaged in putting one of his performances\r\ninto type, not because this or that word was or was not Saxon or Latin,\r\nbut because it was inadequate to convey perfectly his meaning. Mr.\r\nKemble, a great Anglo-Saxon scholar, once, in a company of educated\r\ngentlemen, defied anybody present to mention a single Latin phrase\r\nin our language for which he could not furnish a more forcible\r\nSaxon equivalent. \"The impenetrability of matter\" was suggested;\r\nand Kemble, after half a minute's reflection, answered, \"The\r\nun-thorough-fareableness of stuff.\" Still, no English writer would think\r\nof discarding such an abstract, but convenient and accurate, term as\r\n\"impenetrability,\" for the coarsely concrete and terribly ponderous word\r\nwhich declares that there is no possible thoroughfare, no road, by which\r\nwe can penetrate that substance which we call \"matter,\" and which our\r\nSaxon forefathers called \"stuff.\" Wherever the Latin element in our\r\nlanguage comes in to express ideas and sentiments which were absent from\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon mind, Webster uses it without stint; and some of the\r\nmost resounding passages of his eloquence owe to it their strange power\r\nto suggest a certain vastness in his intellect and sensibility, which\r\nthe quaint, idiomatic, homely prose of his friend, Mason, would have\r\nbeen utterly incompetent to convey. Still, he preferred a plain, plump,\r\nsimple verb or noun to any learned phrase, whenever he could employ it\r\nwithout limiting his opulent nature to a meagre vocabulary, incompetent\r\nfully to express it.\r\n\r\nYet he never departed from simplicity; that is, he rigidly confined\r\nhimself to the use of such words as he had earned the right to use.\r\nWhenever the report of one of his extemporaneous speeches came before\r\nhim for revision, he had an instinctive sagacity in detecting every word\r\nthat had slipped unguardedly from his tongue, which he felt, on\r\nreflection, did not belong to _him_. Among the reporters of his\r\nspeeches, he had a particular esteem for Henry J. Raymond, afterwards so\r\nwell known as the editor of the New York Times. Mr. Raymond told me\r\nthat, after he had made a report of one of Webster's speeches, and had\r\npresented it to him for revision, his conversation with him was always a\r\nlesson in rhetoric. \"Did I use that phrase? I hope not. At any rate,\r\nsubstitute for it this more accurate definition.\" And then again: \"That\r\nword does not express my meaning. Wait a moment, and I will give you a\r\nbetter one. That sentence is slovenly,--that image is imperfect and\r\nconfused. I believe, my young friend, that you have a remarkable power\r\nof reporting what I say; but, if I said that, and that, and that, it\r\nmust have been owing to the fact that I caught, in the hurry of the\r\nmoment, such expressions as I could command at the moment; and you see\r\nthey do not accurately represent the idea that was in my mind.\" And\r\nthus, Mr. Raymond said, the orator's criticism upon his own speech would\r\ngo on,--correction following correction,--until the reporter feared he\r\nwould not have it ready for the morning edition of his journal.\r\n\r\nWebster had so much confidence in Raymond's power of reporting him\r\naccurately, that, when he intended to make an important speech in the\r\nSenate, he would send a note to him, asking him to come to Washington as\r\na personal favor; for he knew that the accomplished editor had a rare\r\npower of apprehending a long train of reasoning, and of so reporting it\r\nthat the separate thoughts would not only be exactly stated, but the\r\nrelations of the thoughts to each other--a much more difficult\r\ntask--would be preserved throughout, and that the argument would be\r\npresented in the symmetrical form in which it existed in the speaker's\r\nmind. Then would follow, as of old, the severe scrutiny of the\r\nphraseology of the speech; and Webster would give, as of old, a new\r\nlesson in rhetoric to the accomplished reporter who was so capable of\r\nfollowing the processes of his mind.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty with speakers who may be sufficiently clear in\r\nstatement and cogent in argument is that turn in their discourse when\r\ntheir language labors to become figurative. Imagery makes palpable to\r\nthe bodily eye the abstract thought seen only by the eye of the mind;\r\nand all orators aim at giving vividness to their thinking by thus making\r\ntheir thoughts _visible_. The investigation of the process of\r\nimagination by which this end is reached is an interesting study. Woe to\r\nthe speaker who is ambitious to rise into the region of imagination\r\nwithout possessing the faculty! Everybody remembers the remark of\r\nSheridan, when Tierney, the prosaic Whig leader of the English House of\r\nCommons, ventured to bring in, as an illustration of his argument, the\r\nfabulous but favorite bird of untrained orators, the phoenix, which is\r\nsupposed always to spring up alive out of its own ashes. \"It was,\" said\r\nSheridan, \"a poulterer's description of a phoenix.\" That is, Tierney,\r\nfrom defect of imagination, could not lift his poetic bird above the\r\nrank of a common hen or chicken.\r\n\r\nThe test that may be most easily applied to all efforts of the\r\nimagination is sincerity; for, like other qualities of the mind, it acts\r\nstrictly within the limits of a man's character and experience. The\r\nmeaning of the word \"experience,\" however, must not be confined to what\r\nhe has personally seen and felt, but is also to be extended to every\r\nthing he has seen and felt through vital sympathy with facts, scenes,\r\nevents, and characters, which he has learned by conversation with other\r\nmen and through books. Webster laid great emphasis on conversation as\r\none of the most important sources of imagery as well as of positive\r\nknowledge. \"In my education,\" he once remarked to Charles Sumner, \"I\r\nhave found that conversation with the intelligent men I have had the\r\ngood fortune to meet has done more for me than books ever did; for I\r\nlearn more from them in a talk of half an hour than I could possibly\r\nlearn from their books. Their minds, in conversation, come into intimate\r\ncontact with my own mind; and I absorb certain secrets of their power,\r\nwhatever may be its quality, which I could not have detected in their\r\nworks. Converse, _converse_, CONVERSE with living men, face to face, and\r\nmind to mind,--that is one of the best sources of knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nBut my present object is simply to give what may be called the natural\r\nhistory of metaphor, comparison, image, trope, and the like, whether\r\nimagery be employed by an uneducated husbandman, or by a great orator\r\nand writer. Many readers may recollect the anecdote of the New Hampshire\r\nfarmer, who was once complimented on the extremely handsome appearance\r\nof a horse which he was somewhat sullenly urging on to perform its work.\r\n\"Yaas,\" was the churlish reply, \"the critter looks well enough, but then\r\nhe is as slow as--as--as--well, as slow as cold molasses.\" This\r\nperfectly answers to Bacon's definition of imagination, as \"thought\r\nimmersed in matter.\" The comparison is exactly on a level with the\r\nexperience of the person who used it. He had seen his good wife, on so\r\nmany bitter winter mornings, when he was eager for his breakfast, turn\r\nthe molasses-jug upside down, and had noted so often the reluctance of\r\nthe congealed sweetness to assume its liquid nature, that the thing had\r\nbecome to him the visible image of the abstract notion of slowness of\r\nmovement. An imaginative dramatist or novelist, priding himself on the\r\nexactness with which he represented character, could not have invented a\r\nmore appropriate comparison to be put into the mouth of an imagined New\r\nEngland farmer.\r\n\r\nThe only objection to such rustic poets is, that a comparatively few\r\nimages serve them for a lifetime; and one tires of such \"originals\"\r\nafter a few days' conversation has shown the extremely limited number of\r\napt illustrations they have added to the homely poetry of agricultural\r\nlife. The only person, belonging to this class, that I ever met, who\r\npossessed an imagination which was continually creative in quaint\r\nimages, was a farmer by the name of Knowlton, who had spent fifty years\r\nin forcing some few acres of the rocky soil of Cape Ann to produce\r\ngrass, oats, potatoes, and, it may be added, those ugly stone walls\r\nwhich carefully distinguish, at the cape, one patch of miserable sterile\r\nland from another. He was equal, in quickness of imaginative\r\nillustration, to the whole crowd of clergymen, lawyers, poets, and\r\nartists, who filled the boarding-houses of \"Pigeon Cove\"; and he was\r\nabsolutely inexhaustible in fresh and original imagery. On one hot\r\nsummer day, the continuation of fourteen hot summer days, when there was\r\nfear all over Cape Ann that the usual scanty crops would be withered up\r\nby the intense heat, and the prayer for rain was in almost every\r\nfarmer's heart, I met Mr. Knowlton, as he was looking philosophically\r\nover one of his own sun-smitten fields of grass. Thinking that I was in\r\nfull sympathy with his own feeling at the dolorous prospect before his\r\neyes, I said, in accosting him, that it was bad weather for the farmers.\r\nHe paused for half a minute; and then his mind flashed back on an\r\nincident of his weekly experience,--that of his wife \"ironing\" the\r\nsomewhat damp clothes of the Monday's \"washing,\"--and he replied: \"I see\r\nyou've been talking with our farmers, who are too stupid to know what's\r\nfor their good. Ye see the spring here was uncommonly rainy, and the\r\nground became wet and cold; but now, for the last fortnight, _God has\r\nbeen putting his flat-iron over it_, and 'twill all come out right in\r\nthe end.\"\r\n\r\nThus Mr. Knowlton went on, year after year, speaking poetry without\r\nknowing it, as Molière's Monsieur Jourdain found he had been speaking\r\nprose all his life without knowing it. But the conception of the sun as\r\nGod's flat-iron, smoothing out and warming the moist earth, as a\r\nhousewife smooths and warms the yet damp shirts, stockings, and\r\nbed-linen brought into the house from the clothes-lines in the yard, is\r\nan astounding illustration of that \"familiar grasp of things divine,\"\r\nwhich obtains in so many of our rustic households. Dante or Chaucer, two\r\nof the greatest poets of the world, would, had they happened to be\r\n\"uneducated\" men, have seized on just such an image to express their\r\nidea of the Divine beneficence.\r\n\r\nThis natural, this instinctive operation of the imaginative faculty, is\r\noften observed in children. Numberless are the stories told by fond\r\nmothers of the wonderful things uttered by their babies, shortly after\r\nthey have left their cradles. The most striking peculiarity running\r\nthrough them all is the astonishing audacity with which the child treats\r\nthe most sacred things. He or she seems to have no sense of awe. All\r\nchildren are taught to believe that God resides above them in the sky;\r\nand I shall never forget the shock of surprise I felt at the answer of a\r\nboy of five years--whom I found glorying over the treasures of his first\r\npaint-box--to my question: \"Which color do you like best?\" \"Oh,\" he\r\ncarelessly replied, \"I like best sky-blue,--God's color.\" And the little\r\nrogue went on, daubing the paper before him with a mixture of all\r\ncolors, utterly unconscious that he had said any thing remarkable; and\r\nyet what Mrs. Browning specially distinguishes as the characteristic of\r\nthe first and one of the greatest of English poets, Chaucer, namely, his\r\n\"familiar grasp of things Divine,\" could not have found a more\r\nappropriate illustration than in this chance remark of a mere child,\r\nexpressing the fearlessness of his faith in the Almighty Father above\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNow in all these instinctive operations of the imagination, whether in\r\nthe mind of a child or in that of a grown man, it is easy to discern the\r\nmark of sincerity. If the child is petted, and urged by his mother to\r\ndisplay his brightness before a company of other mothers and other\r\nbabies, he is in danger of learning early that trick of falsehood, which\r\nclings to him when he goes to school, when he leaves the school for the\r\ncollege, and when he leaves the college for the pursuits of professional\r\nlife. The farmer or mechanic, not endowed with \"college larnin',\" is\r\nsure to become a bad declaimer, perhaps a demagogue, when he abandons\r\nthose natural illustrations and ornaments of his speech which spring\r\nfrom his individual experience, and strives to emulate the\r\ngrandiloquence of those graduates of colleges who have the heathen\r\nmythology at the ends of their fingers and tongues, and can refer to\r\nJove, Juno, Minerva, Diana, Venus, Vulcan, and Neptune, as though they\r\nwere resident deities and deesses of the college halls. The trouble with\r\nmost \"uneducated\" orators is, that they become enamored of these shining\r\ngods and goddesses, after they have lost, through repetition, all of\r\ntheir old power to give point or force to any good sentence of modern\r\noratory. During the times when, to be a speaker at Abolitionist\r\nmeetings, the speaker ran the risk of being pelted with rotten eggs, I\r\nhappened to be present, as one of a small antislavery audience, gathered\r\nin an equally small hall. Among the speakers was an honest,\r\nstrong-minded, warm-hearted young mechanic, who, as long as he was true\r\nto his theme, spoke earnestly, manfully, and well; but alas! he thought\r\nhe could not close without calling in some god or goddess to give\r\nemphasis--after the method of college students--to his previous\r\nstatements. He selected, of course, that unfortunate phantom whom he\r\ncalled the Goddess of Liberty. \"Here, in Boston,\" he thundered, \"where\r\nshe was cradled in Faneuil Hall, can it be that Liberty should be\r\ntrampled under foot, when, after two generations have passed,--yes, sir,\r\nhave elapsed,--she has grown--yes, sir, I repeat it, has grown--grown\r\nup, sir, into a great man?\" The change in sex was, in this case, more\r\nviolent than usual; but how many instances occur to everybody's\r\nrecollection, where that poor Goddess has been almost equally outraged,\r\nthrough a puerile ambition on the part of the orator to endow her with\r\nan exceptional distinction by senseless rhodomontade, manufactured by\r\nthe word-machine which he presumes to call his imagination! All\r\nimitative imagery is the grave of common-sense.\r\n\r\nNow let us pass to an imagination which is, perhaps, the grandest in\r\nAmerican oratory, but which was as perfectly natural as that of the\r\n\"cold molasses,\" or \"God's flat-iron,\" of the New England farmer,--as\r\nnatural, indeed, as the \"sky-blue, God's color,\" of the New England boy.\r\nDaniel Webster, standing on the heights of Quebec at an early hour of a\r\nsummer morning, heard the ordinary morning drum-beat which called the\r\ngarrison to their duty. Knowing that the British possessions belted the\r\nglobe, the thought occurred to him that the morning drum would go on\r\nbeating in some English post to the time when it would sound again in\r\nQuebec. Afterwards, in a speech on President Jackson's Protest, he dwelt\r\non the fact that our Revolutionary forefathers engaged in a war with\r\nGreat Britain on a strict question of principle, \"while actual suffering\r\nwas still afar off.\" How could he give most effect to this statement? It\r\nwould have been easy for him to have presented statistical tables,\r\nshowing the wealth, population, and resources of England, followed by an\r\nenumeration of her colonies and military stations, all going to prove\r\nthe enormous strength of the nation against which the United American\r\ncolonies raised their improvised flag. But the thought which had\r\nheretofore occurred to him at Quebec happily recurred to his mind the\r\nmoment it was needed; and he flashed on the imagination an image of\r\nBritish power which no statistics could have conveyed to the\r\nunderstanding,--\"a Power,\" he said, \"which has dotted over the surface\r\nof the whole globe with her possessions and military posts, whose\r\nmorning drum-beat, following the sun, and keeping company with the\r\nhours, circles the earth with one continuous and unbroken strain of the\r\nmartial airs of England.\" Perhaps a mere rhetorician might consider\r\nsuperfluous the word \"whole,\" as applied to \"globe,\" and \"unbroken,\" as\r\nfollowing \"continuous\"; yet they really add to the force and majesty of\r\nthe expression. It is curious that, in Great Britain, this magnificent\r\nimpersonation of the power of England is so little known. It is certain\r\nthat it is unrivalled in British patriotic oratory. Not Chatham, not\r\neven Burke, ever approached it in the noblest passages in which they\r\ncelebrated the greatness and glory of their country. Webster, it is to\r\nbe noted, introduced it in his speech, not for the purpose of exalting\r\nEngland, but of exalting our Revolutionary forefathers, whose victory,\r\nafter a seven years' war of terrible severity, waged in vindication of a\r\nprinciple, was made all the more glorious from having been won over an\r\nadversary so formidable and so vast.\r\n\r\nIt is reported that, at the conclusion of this speech on the President's\r\nProtest, John Sergeant, of Philadelphia, came up to the orator, and,\r\nafter cordially shaking hands with him, eagerly asked, \"Where, Webster,\r\ndid you get that idea of the morning drum-beat?\" Like other public men,\r\naccustomed to address legislative assemblies, he was naturally desirous\r\nof knowing the place, if place there was, where such images and\r\nillustrations were to be found. The truth was that, if Webster had ever\r\nread Goethe's Faust,--which he of course never had done,--he might have\r\nreferred his old friend to that passage where Faust, gazing at the\r\nsetting sun, aches to follow it in its course for ever. \"See,\" he\r\nexclaims, \"how the green-girt cottages shimmer in the setting sun. He\r\nbends and sinks,--the day is outlived. Yonder he hurries off, and\r\nquickens other life. Oh, that I have no wing to lift me from the ground,\r\nto struggle after--for ever after--him! I should see, in everlasting\r\nevening beams, the stilly world at my feet, every height on fire, every\r\nvale in repose, the silver brook flowing into golden streams. The rugged\r\nmountain, with all its dark defiles, would not then break my godlike\r\ncourse. Already the sea, with its heated bays, opens on my enraptured\r\nsight. Yet the god seems at last to sink away. But the new impulse\r\nwakes. I hurry on to drink his everlasting light,--_the day before me\r\nand the night behind_,--and under me the waves.\" In Faust, the wings of\r\nthe mind follow the setting sun; in Webster, they follow the rising sun;\r\nbut the thought of each circumnavigates the globe, in joyous\r\ncompanionship with the same centre of life, light, and heat,--though the\r\nsuggestion which prompts the sublime idea is widely different. The\r\nsentiment of Webster, calmly meditating on the heights of Quebec,\r\ncontrasts strangely with the fiery feeling of Faust, raging against the\r\nlimitations of his mortal existence. A humorist, Charles Dickens, who\r\nnever read either Goethe or Webster, has oddly seized on the same\r\ngeneral idea: \"The British empire,\" as he says, in one of his\r\nnovels,--\"on which the sun never sets, and where the tax-gatherer never\r\ngoes to bed.\"\r\n\r\nThis celebrated image of the British \"drum-beat\" is here cited simply to\r\nindicate the natural way in which all the faculties of Webster are\r\nbrought into harmonious co-operation, whenever he seriously discusses\r\nany great question. His understanding and imagination, when both are\r\nroused into action, always cordially join hands. His statement of facts\r\nis so combined with the argument founded on them, that they are\r\ninterchangeable; his statement having the force of argument, and his\r\nargument having the \"substantiality\" which properly belongs to\r\nstatement; and to these he commonly adds an imaginative illustration,\r\nwhich gives increased reality to both statement and argument. In rapidly\r\nturning over the leaves of the six volumes of his Works, one can easily\r\nfind numerous instances of this instinctive operation of his mind. In\r\nhis first Bunker Hill oration, he announces that \"the _principle_ of\r\nfree governments adheres to the American soil. It is bedded in it,\r\nimmovable as its mountains.\" Again he says: \"A call for the\r\nrepresentative system, wherever it is not enjoyed, and where there is\r\nalready intelligence enough to estimate its value, is perseveringly\r\nmade. Where men may speak out, they demand it where the bayonet is at\r\ntheir throats, they pray for it.\" And yet again: \"If the true spark of\r\nreligious and civil liberty be kindled, it will burn. Human agency\r\ncannot extinguish it. Like the earth's central fire, it may be smothered\r\nfor a time; the ocean may overwhelm it; mountains may press it down; but\r\nits inherent and unconquerable force will heave both the ocean and the\r\nland, and at some time or other, in some place or other, the volcano\r\nwill break out, and flame up to heaven.\" It would be difficult to find\r\nin any European literature a similar embodiment of an elemental\r\nsentiment of humanity, in an image which is as elemental as the\r\nsentiment to which it gives vivid expression.\r\n\r\nAnd then with what majesty, with what energy, and with what simplicity,\r\ncan he denounce a political transaction which, had it not attracted his\r\nire, would hardly have survived in the memory of his countrymen! Thus,\r\nin his Protest against Mr. Benton's Expunging Resolution, speaking for\r\nhimself and his Senatorial colleague, he says: \"We rescue our own names,\r\ncharacter, and honor from all participation in this matter; and,\r\nwhatever the wayward character of the times, the headlong and plunging\r\nspirit of party devotion, or the fear or the love of power, may have\r\nbeen able to bring about elsewhere, we desire to thank God that they\r\nhave not, as yet, overcome the love of liberty, fidelity to true\r\nrepublican principles, and a sacred regard for the Constitution in that\r\nState whose soil was drenched to a mire by the first and best blood of\r\nthe Revolution.\" Perhaps the peculiar power of Webster in condemning a\r\nmeasure by a felicitous epithet, such as that he employs in describing\r\n\"the _plunging_ spirit of party devotion,\" was never more happily\r\nexercised. In that word \"plunging,\" he intended to condense all his\r\nhorror and hatred of a transaction which he supposed calculated to throw\r\nthe true principles of constitutional government into a bottomless abyss\r\nof personal government, where right constitutional principles would\r\ncease to have existence, as well as cease to have authority.\r\n\r\nThere is one passage in his oration at the completion of the Bunker Hill\r\nMonument, which may be quoted as an illustration of his power of compact\r\nstatement, and which, at the same time, may save readers from the\r\ntrouble of reading many excellent histories of the origin and progress\r\nof the Spanish dominion in America, condensing, as it does, all which\r\nsuch histories can tell us in a few smiting sentences. \"Spain,\" he says,\r\n\"stooped on South America, like a vulture on its prey. Every thing was\r\nforce. Territories were acquired by fire and sword. Cities were\r\ndestroyed by fire and sword. Hundreds of thousands of human beings fell\r\nby fire and sword. Even conversion to Christianity was attempted by fire\r\nand sword.\" One is reminded, in this passage, of Macaulay's method of\r\ngiving vividness to his confident generalization of facts by emphatic\r\nrepetitions of the same form of words. The repetition of \"fire and\r\nsword,\" in this series of short, sharp sentences, ends in forcing the\r\nreality of what the words mean on the dullest imagination; and the\r\nclimax is capped by affirming that \"fire and sword\" were the means by\r\nwhich the religion of peace was recommended to idolaters, whose\r\nheathenism was more benignant, and more intrinsically Christian, than\r\nthe military Christianity which was forced upon them.\r\n\r\nAnd then, again, how easily Webster's imagination slips in, at the end\r\nof a comparatively bald enumeration of the benefits of a good\r\ngovernment, to vitalize the statements of his understanding!\r\n\"Everywhere,\" he says, \"there is order, everywhere there is security.\r\nEverywhere the law reaches to the highest, and reaches to the lowest, to\r\nprotect all in their rights, and to restrain all from wrong; and over\r\nall hovers liberty,--that liberty for which our fathers fought and fell\r\non this very spot, with her eye ever watchful, and her eagle wing ever\r\nwide outspread.\" There is something astonishing in the dignity given in\r\nthe last clause of this sentence to the American eagle,--a bird so\r\ndegraded by the rhodomontade of fifth-rate declaimers, that it seemed\r\nimpossible that the highest genius and patriotism could restore it to\r\nits primacy among the inhabitants of the air, and its just eminence as a\r\nsymbol of American liberty. It is also to be noted, that Webster here\r\nalludes to \"the bird of freedom\" only as it appears on the American\r\nsilver dollar that passes daily from hand to hand, where the watchful\r\neye and the outspread wing are so inartistically represented that the\r\ncritic is puzzled to account for the grandeur of the image which the\r\norator contrived to evolve from the barbaric picture on the ugliest and\r\nclumsiest of civilized coins.\r\n\r\nThe compactness of Webster's statements occasionally reminds us of the\r\nepigrammatic point which characterizes so many of the statements of\r\nBurke. Thus, in presenting a memorial to Congress, signed by many\r\nprominent men of business, against President Jackson's system of\r\nfinance, he saw at once that the Democrats would denounce it as another\r\nmanifesto of the \"moneyed aristocracy.\" Accordingly Webster introduced\r\nthe paper to the attention of the Senate, with the preliminary remark:\r\n\"The memorialists are not unaware, that, if rights are attacked,\r\nattempts will be made to render odious those whose rights are violated.\r\nPower always seeks such subjects on which to try its experiments.\" It is\r\ndifficult to resist the impression that Webster must have been indebted\r\nto Burke for this maxim. Again, we are deluded into the belief that we\r\nmust be reading Burke, when Webster refers to the _minimum_ principle as\r\nthe right one to be followed in imposing duties on certain manufactures.\r\n\"It lays the impost,\" he says, \"exactly where it will do good, and\r\nleaves the rest free. It is an intelligent, discerning, discriminating\r\nprinciple; not a blind, headlong, generalizing, uncalculating operation.\r\nSimplicity undoubtedly, is a great beauty in acts of legislation, as\r\nwell as in the works of art; but in both it must be a simplicity\r\nresulting from congruity of parts and adaptation to the end designed;\r\nnot a rude generalization, which either leaves the particular object\r\nunaccomplished, or, in accomplishing it, accomplishes a dozen others\r\nalso, which were not desired. It is a simplicity wrought out by\r\nknowledge and skill; not the rough product of an undistinguishing,\r\nsweeping general principle.\"\r\n\r\nAn ingenuous reader, who has not learned from his historical studies\r\nthat men generally act, not from arguments addressed to their\r\nunderstandings, but from vehement appeals which rouse their passions to\r\ndefend their seeming interests, cannot comprehend why Webster's\r\narguments against Nullification and Secession, which were apparently\r\nunanswerable, and which were certainly unanswered either by Hayne or\r\nCalhoun, should not have settled the question in debate between the\r\nNorth and the South. Such a reader, after patiently following all the\r\nturns and twists of the logic, all the processes of the reasoning\r\nemployed on both sides of the intellectual contest, would naturally\r\nconclude that the party defeated in the conflict would gracefully\r\nacknowledge the fact of its defeat; and, as human beings, gifted with\r\nthe faculty of reason, would cheerfully admit the demonstrated results\r\nof its exercise. He would find it difficult to comprehend why the men\r\nwho were overcome in a fair gladiatorial strife in the open arena of\r\ndebate, with brain pitted against brain, and manhood against manhood,\r\nshould resort to the rough logic of \"blood and iron,\" when the nobler\r\nkind of logic, that which is developed in the struggle of mind with\r\nmind, had failed to accomplish the purposes which their hearts and\r\nwills, independent of their understandings, were bent on accomplishing.\r\n\r\nIt may be considered certain that so wise a statesman as Webster--a\r\nstatesman whose foresight was so palpably the consequence of his\r\ninsight, and whose piercing intellect was so admirably adapted to read\r\nevents in their principles--never indulged in such illusions as those\r\nwhich cheered so many of his own adherents, when they supposed his\r\ntriumph in argumentation was to settle a matter which was really based\r\non organic differences in the institutions of the two sections of the\r\nUnion. He knew perfectly well that, while the Webster men were glorying\r\nin his victory over Calhoun, the Calhoun men were equally jubilant in\r\ncelebrating Calhoun's victory over him. Which of them had the better in\r\nthe argument was of little importance in comparison with the terrible\r\nfact that the people of the Southern States were widening, year by year,\r\nthe distance which separated them from the people of the Northern\r\nStates. We have no means of judging whether Webster clearly foresaw the\r\nfrightful civil war between the two sections, which followed so soon\r\nafter his own death. We only know that, to him, it was a conflict\r\nconstantly impending, and which could be averted for the time only by\r\ncompromises, concessions, and other temporary expedients. If he allowed\r\nhis mind to pass from the pressing questions of the hour, and to\r\nconsider the radical division between the two sections of the country\r\nwhich were only formally united, it would seem that he must have felt,\r\nas long as the institution of negro slavery existed, that he was only\r\nlaboring to postpone a conflict which it was impossible for him to\r\nprevent.\r\n\r\nBut my present purpose is simply to indicate the felicity of Webster's\r\nintrepid assault on the principles which the Southern disunionists put\r\nforward in justification of their acts. Mr. Calhoun's favorite idea was\r\nthis,--that Nullification was a conservative principle, to be exercised\r\nwithin the Union, and in accordance with a just interpretation of the\r\nConstitution. \"To begin with nullification,\" Webster retorted, \"with the\r\navowed intent, nevertheless, not to proceed to secession, dismemberment,\r\nand general revolution, is as if one were to take the plunge of Niagara,\r\nand cry out that he would stop half-way down. In the one case, as in the\r\nother, the rash adventurer must go to the bottom of the dark abyss\r\nbelow, were it not that the abyss has no discovered bottom.\"\r\n\r\nHow admirable also is his exposure of the distinction attempted to be\r\ndrawn between secession, as a State right to be exercised under the\r\nprovisions of what was called \"the Constitutional Compact,\" and\r\nrevolution. \"Secession,\" he says, \"as a revolutionary right, is\r\nintelligible; as a right to be proclaimed in the midst of civil\r\ncommotions, and asserted at the head of armies, I can understand it. But\r\nas a practical right, existing under the Constitution, and in conformity\r\nwith its provisions, it seems to me nothing but a plain absurdity; for\r\nit supposes resistance to government, under the authority of government\r\nitself; it supposes dismemberment, without violating the principles of\r\nunion; it supposes opposition to law, without crime, it supposes the\r\ntotal overthrow of government, without revolution.\"\r\n\r\nAfter putting some pertinent interrogatories--which are arguments in\r\nthemselves--relating to the inevitable results of secession, he adds,\r\nthat \"every man must see that these are all questions which can arise\r\nonly after a revolution. They presuppose the breaking up of the\r\ngovernment. While the Constitution lasts, they are repressed\";--and\r\nthen, with that felicitous use of the imagination as a handmaid of the\r\nunderstanding, which is the peculiar characteristic of his eloquence, he\r\ncloses the sentence by saying, that \"they spring up to annoy and startle\r\nus only from its grave.\" A mere reasoner would have stopped at the word\r\n\"repressed\"; the instantaneous conversion of \"questions\" into spectres,\r\naffrighting and annoying us as they spring up from the grave of the\r\nConstitution,--which is also by implication impersonated,--is the work\r\nof Webster's ready imagination; and it thoroughly vitalizes the\r\nstatements which precede it.\r\n\r\nA great test of the sincerity of a statesman's style is his moderation.\r\nNow, if we take the whole body of Mr. Webster's speeches, whether\r\ndelivered in the Senate or before popular assemblies, during the period\r\nof his opposition to President Jackson's administration, we may well be\r\nsurprised at their moderation of tone and statement. Everybody old\r\nenough to recollect the singular virulence of political speech at that\r\nperiod must remember it as disgraceful equally to the national\r\nconscience and the national understanding. The spirit of party, always\r\nsufficiently fierce and unreasonable, was then stimulated into a fury\r\nresembling madness. Almost every speaker, Democrat or Whig, was in that\r\nstate of passion which is represented by the physical sign of \"foaming\r\nat the mouth.\" Few mouths then opened that did not immediately begin to\r\n\"foam.\" So many fortunes were suddenly wrecked by President Jackson's\r\nfinancial policy, and the business of the country was so disastrously\r\ndisturbed, that, whether the policy was right or wrong, those who\r\nassailed and those who defended it seemed to be equally devoid of common\r\nintellectual honesty. \"I do well to be angry,\" appears to have been the\r\nmaxim which inspired Democratic and Whig orators alike; and what reason\r\nthere was on either side was submerged in the lies and libels, in the\r\ncalumnies and caricatures, in the defamations and execrations, which\r\naccompanied the citation of facts and the affirmation of principles.\r\nWebster, during all this time, was selected as a shining mark, at which\r\nevery puny writer or speaker who opposed him hurled his small or large\r\ncontribution of verbal rotten eggs; and yet Webster was almost the only\r\nWhig statesman who preserved sanity of understanding during the whole\r\nprogress of that political riot, in which the passions of men became the\r\nmasters of their understandings. Pious Whig fathers, who worshipped the\r\n\"godlike Daniel,\" went almost to the extent of teaching their children\r\nto curse Jackson in their prayers; equally pious Democratic fathers\r\nbrought up their sons and daughters to anathematize the fiend-like\r\nDaniel as the enemy of human rights; and yet, in reading Webster's\r\nspeeches, covering the whole space between 1832 and 1836, we can hardly\r\nfind a statement which an historian of our day would not admit as a\r\ncandid generalization of facts, or an argument which would not stand the\r\ntest of logical examination. Such an historian might entirely disagree\r\nwith the opinions of Webster; but he would certainly award to him the\r\npraise of being an honest reasoner and an honest rhetorician, in a time\r\nwhen reason was used merely as a tool of party passion, and when\r\nrhetoric rushed madly into the worst excesses of rhodomontade.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be said that Webster rarely indulged in personalities.\r\nWhen we consider how great were his powers of sarcasm and invective, how\r\nconstant were the provocations to exercise them furnished by his\r\npolitical enemies, and how atrociously and meanly allusions to his\r\nprivate affairs were brought into discussions which should have been\r\nconfined to refuting his reasoning, his moderation in this matter is to\r\nbe ranked as a great virtue. He could not take a glass of wine without\r\nthe trivial fact being announced all over the country as indisputable\r\nproof that he was an habitual drunkard, though the most remarkable\r\ncharacteristic of his speeches is their temperance,--their \"total\r\nabstinence\" from all the intoxicating moral and mental \"drinks\" which\r\nconfuse the understanding and mislead the conscience. He could not\r\nborrow money on his note of hand, like any other citizen, without the\r\ncircumstance being trumpeted abroad as incontrovertible evidence that\r\nNick Biddle had paid him that sum to defend his diabolical Bank in the\r\nSenate of the United States. The plain fact that his speeches were\r\nconfined strictly to the exposition and defence of sound opinions on\r\ntrade and finance, and that it was difficult to answer them, only\r\nconfirmed his opponents in the conviction that old Nick was at the\r\nbottom of it all. His great intellect was admitted; but on the high,\r\nbroad brow, which was its manifestation to the eye, his enemies pasted\r\nthe words, \"To be let,\" or, \"For sale.\" The more impersonal he became in\r\nhis statements and arguments, the more truculently was he assailed by\r\nthe personalities of the political gossip and scandal-monger. Indeed,\r\nfrom the time he first came to the front as a great lawyer, statesman,\r\nand patriot, he was fixed upon by the whole crew of party libellers as a\r\nman whose arguments could be answered most efficiently by staining his\r\ncharacter. He passed through life with his head enveloped \"in a cloud of\r\npoisonous flies\"; and the head was the grandest-looking head that had\r\never been seen on the American continent. It was so pre-eminently noble\r\nand impressive, and promised so much more than it could possibly\r\nperform, that only one felicitous sarcasm of party malice, among many\r\nthousands of bad jokes, has escaped oblivion; and that was stolen from\r\nCharles Fox's remark on Lord Chancellor Thurlow, as Fox once viewed him\r\nsitting on the wool-sack, frowning on the English House of Lords, which\r\nhe dominated by the terror of his countenance, and by the fear that he\r\nmight, at any moment, burst forth in one of his short bullying,\r\nthundering retorts, should any comparatively weak baron, earl, marquis,\r\nor duke dare to oppose him. \"Thurlow,\" said Fox, \"must be an impostor,\r\nfor nobody can be as wise as he looks.\" The American version of this\r\nwas, \"Webster must be a charlatan, for no one can be as great as he\r\nlooks.\"\r\n\r\nBut during all the time that his antagonists attempted to elude the\r\nforce of his arguments by hunting up the evidences of his debts, and by\r\ntrying to show that the most considerate, the most accurate, and the\r\nmost temperate of his lucid statements were the products of physical\r\nstimulants, Webster steadily kept in haughty reserve his power of\r\nretaliation. In his speech in reply to Hayne he hinted that, if he were\r\nimperatively called upon to meet blows with blows, he might be found\r\nfully equal to his antagonists in that ignoble province of intellectual\r\npugilism; but that he preferred the more civilized struggle of brain\r\nwith brain, in a contest which was to decide questions of principle. In\r\nthe Senate, where he could meet his political opponents face to face,\r\nfew dared to venture to degrade the subject in debate from the\r\ndiscussion of principles to the miserable subterfuge of imputing bad\r\nmotives as a sufficient answer to good arguments; but still many of\r\nthese dignified gentlemen smiled approval on the efforts of the\r\nlow-minded, small-minded caucus-speakers of their party, when they\r\ndeclared that Webster's logic was unworthy of consideration, because he\r\nwas bought by the Bank, or bought by the manufacturers of Massachusetts,\r\nor bought by some other combination of persons who were supposed to be\r\nthe deadly enemies of the laboring men of the country. On some rare\r\noccasions Webster's wrath broke out in such smiting words that his\r\nadversaries were cowed into silence, and cursed the infatuation which\r\nhad led them to overlook the fact that the \"logic-machine\" had in it\r\ninvectives more terrible than its reasonings. But generally he refrained\r\nfrom using the giant's power \"like a giant\"; and it is almost pathetic\r\nto remember that, when Mr. Everett undertook to edit, in 1851, the\r\nstandard edition of his works, Webster gave directions to expunge all\r\npersonalities from his speeches, even when those personalities were the\r\njust punishment of unprovoked attacks on his integrity as a man. Readers\r\nwill look in vain, in this edition of his works, for some of the most\r\npungent passages which originally attracted their attention in the first\r\nreport of the Defence of the Treaty of Washington. At the time these\r\ndirections were given, Webster was himself the object of innumerable\r\npersonalities, which were the natural, the inevitable results of his\r\nspeech of the 7th of March, 1850.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be a law, that the fame of all public men shall be \"half\r\ndisfame.\" We are specially warned to beware of the man of whom all men\r\nspeak well. Burke, complimenting his friend Fox for risking every thing,\r\neven his \"darling popularity,\" on the success of the East India Bill,\r\nnobly says: \"He is traduced and abused for his supposed motives. He will\r\nremember, that obloquy is a necessary ingredient in all true glory; he\r\nwill remember, that it was not only in the Roman customs, but it is in\r\nthe nature of human things, that calumny and abuse are essential parts\r\nof triumph.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be said, however, that Webster's virtue in this general\r\nabstinence from personalities is to be offset by the fact that he could\r\nthrow into a glance of his eye, a contortion of his face, a tone of his\r\nvoice, or a simple gesture of his hand, more scorn, contempt, and hatred\r\nthan ordinary debaters could express by the profuse use of all the\r\nscurrilous terms in the English language. Probably many a sentence,\r\nwhich we now read with an even pulse, was, as originally delivered,\r\naccompanied by such pointing of the finger, or such flashing of the eye,\r\nor such raising of the voice, that the seemingly innocent words were\r\npoisoned arrows that festered in the souls of those against whom they\r\nwere directed, and made deadly enemies of a number of persons whom he\r\nseems, in his printed speeches, never to have mentioned without the\r\nrespect due from one Senator to another. In his speech in defence of the\r\nTreaty of Washington, he had to repel Mr. Ingersoll's indecent attack on\r\nhis integrity, and his dreadful retort is described by those who heard\r\nit as coming within the rules which condemn cruelty to animals. But the\r\n\"noble rage\" which prompted him to indulge in such unwonted invective\r\nsubsided with the occasion that called it forth, and he was careful to\r\nhave it expunged when the speech was reprinted. An eminent judge of the\r\nSupreme Court of Massachusetts, in commending the general dignity and\r\ncourtesy which characterized Webster's conduct of a case in a court of\r\nlaw, noted one exception. \"When,\" he said, \"the opposite counsel had got\r\nhim into a corner, the way he 'trampled out' was something frightful to\r\nbehold. The court itself could hardly restrain him in his gigantic\r\nefforts to extricate himself from the consequences of a blunder or an\r\noversight.\"\r\n\r\nGreat writers and orators are commonly economists in the use of words.\r\nThey compel common words to bear a burden of thought and emotion, which\r\nmere rhetoricians, with all the resources of the language at their\r\ndisposal, would never dream of imposing upon them. But it is also to be\r\nobserved, that some writers have the power of giving a new and special\r\nsignificance to a common word, by impressing on it a wealth of meaning\r\nwhich it cannot claim for itself. Three obvious examples of this\r\npeculiar power may be cited. Among poets, Chaucer infused into the\r\nsimple word \"green\" a poetic ecstasy which no succeeding English poet,\r\nnot even Wordsworth, has ever rivalled, in describing an English\r\nlandscape in the month of May. Jonathan Edwards fixed upon the term\r\n\"sweetness\" as best conveying his loftiest conception of the bliss which\r\nthe soul of the saint can attain to on earth, or expect to be blessed\r\nwith in heaven; but not one of his theological successors has ever\r\ncaught the secret of using \"sweetness\" in the sense attached to it by\r\nhim. Dr. Barrow gave to the word \"rest,\" as embodying his idea of the\r\nspiritual repose of the soul fit for heaven, a significance which it\r\nbears in the works of no other great English divine. To descend a\r\nlittle, Webster was fond of certain words, commonplace enough in\r\nthemselves, to which he insisted on imparting a more than ordinary\r\nimport. Two of these, which meet us continually in reading his speeches,\r\nare \"interesting\" and \"respectable.\" The first of these appears to him\r\ncompetent to express that rapture of attention called forth by a thing,\r\nan event, or a person, which other writers convey by such a term as\r\n\"absorbing,\" or its numerous equivalents. If we should select one\r\npassage from his works which, more than any other, indicates his power\r\nof seeing and feeling, through a process of purely imaginative vision\r\nand sympathy, it is that portion of his Plymouth oration, where he\r\nplaces himself and his audience as spectators on the barren shore, when\r\nthe _Mayflower_ came into view. He speaks of \"the _interesting_ group\r\nupon the deck\" of the little vessel. The very word suggests that we are\r\nto have a very commonplace account of the landing, and the circumstances\r\nwhich followed it. In an instant, however, we are made to \"feel the cold\r\nwhich benumbed, and listen to the winds which pierced\" this\r\n\"interesting\" group; and immediately after, the picture is flashed upon\r\nthe imagination of \"chilled and shivering childhood, houseless, but for\r\na mother's arms, couchless, but for a mother's breast,\"--an image which\r\nshows that the orator had not only transported himself into a spectator\r\nof the scene, but had felt his own blood \"almost freeze\" in intense\r\nsympathy with the physical sufferings of the shelterless mothers and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThere is no word which the novelists, satirists, philanthropic\r\nreformers, and Bohemians of our day have done so much to discredit, and\r\nmake dis-respectable to the heart and the imagination, as the word\r\n\"respectable.\" Webster always uses it as a term of eulogy. A respectable\r\nman is, to his mind, a person who performs all his duties to his family,\r\nhis country, and his God; a person who is not only virtuous, but who has\r\na clear perception of the relation which connects one virtue with\r\nanother by \"the golden thread\" of moderation, and who, whether he be a\r\nman of genius, or a business man of average talent, or an intelligent\r\nmechanic, or a farmer of sound moral and mental character, is to be\r\nconsidered \"respectable\" because he is one of those citizens whose\r\nintelligence and integrity constitute the foundation on which the\r\nRepublic rests. As late as 1843, in his noble oration on the completion\r\nof the Bunker Hill Monument, he declared that if our American\r\ninstitutions had done nothing more than to produce the character of\r\nWashington, that alone would entitle them to the respect of mankind.\r\n\"Washington is all our own!... I would cheerfully put the question\r\nto-day to the intelligence of Europe and the world, what character of\r\nthe century, upon the whole, stands out in the relief of history, most\r\npure, most _respectable_, most sublime; and I doubt not, that, by a\r\nsuffrage approaching to unanimity, the answer would be Washington!\" It\r\nis needless to quote other instances of the peculiar meaning he put into\r\nthe word \"respectable,\" when we thus find him challenging the Europe of\r\nthe eighteenth century to name a match for Washington, and placing \"most\r\nrespectable\" after \"most pure,\" and immediately preceding \"most\r\nsublime,\" in his enumeration of the three qualities in which Washington\r\nsurpassed all men of his century.\r\n\r\nIt has been often remarked that Webster adapted his style, even his\r\nhabits of mind and modes of reasoning, to the particular auditors he\r\ndesired to influence; but that, whether he addressed an unorganized\r\ncrowd of people, or a jury, or a bench of judges, or the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, he ever proved himself an orator of the first class.\r\n\r\nHis admirers commonly confine themselves to the admirable sagacity with\r\nwhich he discriminated between the kind of reasoning proper to be\r\nemployed when he addressed courts and juries, and the kind of reasoning\r\nwhich is most effective in a legislative assembly. The lawyer and the\r\nstatesman were, in Webster, kept distinct, except so far as he was a\r\nlawyer who had argued before the Supreme Court questions of\r\nconstitutional law. An amusing instance of this abnegation of the\r\nlawyer, while incidentally bringing in a lawyer's knowledge of judicial\r\ndecisions, occurs in a little episode in his debate with Mr. Calhoun, in\r\n1849, as to the relation of Congress to the Territories. Mr. Calhoun\r\nsaid that he had been told that the Supreme Court of the United States\r\nhad decided, in _one_ case, that the Constitution did not extend to the\r\nTerritories, but that he was \"incredulous of the fact.\" \"Oh!\" replied\r\nMr. Webster, \"I can remove the gentleman's incredulity very easily, for\r\nI can assure him that the same thing has been decided by the United\r\nStates courts over and over again for the last thirty years.\" It will be\r\nobserved, however, that Mr. Webster, after communicating this important\r\nitem of information, proceeded to discuss the question as if the Supreme\r\nCourt had no existence, and bases his argument on the plain terms of the\r\nConstitution, and the plain facts recorded in the history of the\r\ngovernment established by it.\r\n\r\nMacaulay, in his lively way, has shown the difficulty of manufacturing\r\nEnglish statesmen out of English lawyers, though, as lawyers, their rank\r\nin the profession may be very high. \"Their arguments,\" he says, \"are\r\nintellectual prodigies, abounding with the happiest analogies and the\r\nmost refined distinctions. The principles of their arbitrary science\r\nbeing once admitted, the statute-books and the reports being once\r\nassumed as the foundations of reasoning, these men must be allowed to be\r\nperfect masters of logic. But if a question arises as to the postulates\r\non which their whole system rests, if they are called upon to vindicate\r\nthe fundamental maxims of that system which they have passed their lives\r\nin studying, these very men often talk the language of savages or of\r\nchildren. Those who have listened to a man of this class in his own\r\ncourt, and who have witnessed the skill with which he analyzes and\r\ndigests a vast mass of evidence, or reconciles a crowd of precedents\r\nwhich at first sight seem contradictory, scarcely know him again when, a\r\nfew hours later, they hear him speaking on the other side of Westminster\r\nHall in his capacity of legislator. They can scarcely believe that the\r\npaltry quirks which are faintly heard through a storm of coughing, and\r\nwhich do not impose on the plainest country gentleman, can proceed from\r\nthe same sharp and vigorous intellect which had excited their admiration\r\nunder the same roof, and on the same day.\" And to this keen distinction\r\nbetween an English lawyer, and an English lawyer as a member of the\r\nHouse of Commons, may be added the peculiar kind of sturdy manliness\r\nwhich is demanded in any person who aims to take a leading part in\r\nParliamentary debates. Erskine, probably the greatest advocate who ever\r\nappeared in the English courts of law, made but a comparatively poor\r\nfigure in the House of Commons, as a member of the Whig opposition. \"The\r\ntruth is, Erskine,\" Sheridan once said to him, \"you are afraid of Pitt,\r\nand that is the flabby part of your character.\"\r\n\r\nBut Macaulay, in another article, makes a point against the leaders of\r\nparty themselves. His definition of Parliamentary government is\r\n\"government by speaking\"; and he declares that the most effective\r\nspeakers are commonly ill-informed, shallow in thought, devoid of large\r\nideas of legislation, hazarding the loosest speculations with the utmost\r\nintellectual impudence, and depending for success on volubility of\r\nspeech, rather than on accuracy of knowledge or penetration of\r\nintelligence. \"The tendency of institutions like those of England,\" he\r\nadds, \"is to encourage readiness in public men, at the expense both of\r\nfulness and of exactness. The keenest and most vigorous minds of every\r\ngeneration, minds often admirably fitted for the investigation of truth,\r\nare habitually employed in producing arguments such as no man of sense\r\nwould ever put into a treatise intended for publication, arguments which\r\nare just good enough to be used once, when aided by fluent delivery and\r\npointed language.\" And he despairingly closes with the remark, that he\r\n\"would sooner expect a great original work on political science, such a\r\nwork, for example, as the Wealth of Nations, from an apothecary in a\r\ncountry town, or from a minister in the Hebrides, than from a statesman\r\nwho, ever since he was one-and-twenty, had been a distinguished debater\r\nin the House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\nNow it is plain that neither of these contemptuous judgments applies to\r\nWebster. He was a great lawyer; but as a legislator the precedents of\r\nthe lawyer did not control the action or supersede the principles of the\r\nstatesman. He was one of the most formidable debaters that ever appeared\r\nin a legislative assembly; and yet those who most resolutely grappled\r\nwith him in the duel of debate would be the last to impute to him\r\ninaccuracy of knowledge or shallowness of thought. He carried into the\r\nSenate of the United States a trained mind, disciplined by the sternest\r\nculture of his faculties, disdaining any plaudits which were not the\r\nhonest reward of robust reasoning on generalized facts, and\r\n\"gravitating\" in the direction of truth, whether he hit or missed it. In\r\nhis case, at least, there was nothing in his legal experience, or in his\r\nlegislative experience, which would have unfitted him for producing a\r\nwork on the science of politics. The best speeches in the House of\r\nCommons of Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell appear very weak\r\nindeed, as compared with the Reply to Hayne, or the speech on \"The\r\nConstitution not a Compact between Sovereign States,\" or the speech on\r\nthe President's Protest.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be said, when we remember the hot contests\r\nbetween the two men, that there is something plaintive in Calhoun's\r\ndying testimony to Webster's austere intellectual conscientiousness. Mr.\r\nVenables, who attended the South Carolina statesman in his dying hours,\r\nwrote to Webster: \"When your name was mentioned he remarked that 'Mr.\r\nWebster has as high a standard of truth as any statesman I have met in\r\ndebate. Convince him, and he cannot reply; he is silenced; he cannot\r\nlook truth in the face and oppose it by argument. I think that it can be\r\nreadily perceived by his manner when he felt the unanswerable force of a\r\nreply.' He often spoke of you in my presence, and always kindly and most\r\nrespectfully.\" Now it must be considered that, in debate, the minds of\r\nWebster and Calhoun had come into actual contact and collision. Each\r\nreally felt the force of the other. An ordinary duel might be ranked\r\namong idle pastimes when compared with the stress and strain and pain of\r\ntheir encounters in the duel of debate. A sword-cut or pistol-bullet,\r\nmaiming the body, was as nothing in comparison with the wounds they\r\nmutually inflicted on that substance which was immortal in both. It was\r\na duel, or series of duels, in which mind was opposed to mind, and will\r\nto will, and where the object appeared to be to inflict moral and mental\r\nannihilation on one of the combatants. There never passed a word between\r\nthem on which the most ingenious Southern jurists, in their\r\ninterpretations of the \"code\" of honor, could have found matter for a\r\npersonal quarrel; and yet these two proud and strong personalities knew\r\nthat they were engaged in a mortal contest, in which neither gave\r\nquarter nor expected quarter. Mr. Calhoun's intellectual egotism was as\r\ngreat as his intellectual ability. He always supposed that he was the\r\nvictor in every close logical wrestle with any mind to which his own was\r\nopposed. He never wrestled with a mind, until he met Webster's, which in\r\ntenacity, grasp, and power was a match for his own. He, of course,\r\nthought his antagonist was beaten by his superior strength and amplitude\r\nof argumentation; but it is still to be noted that he, the most\r\nredoubtable opponent that Webster ever encountered, testified, though in\r\nequivocal terms, to Webster's intellectual honesty. When he crept, half\r\ndead, into the Senate-Chamber to hear Webster's speech of the 7th of\r\nMarch, 1850, he objected emphatically at the end to Webster's\r\ndeclaration that the Union could not be dissolved. After declaring that\r\nCalhoun's supposed case of justifiable resistance came within the\r\ndefinition of the ultimate right of revolution, which is lodged in all\r\noppressed communities, Webster added that he did not at that time wish\r\nto go into a discussion of the nature of the United States government.\r\n\"The honorable gentleman and myself,\" he said, \"have broken lances\r\nsufficiently often before on that subject.\" \"I have no desire to do it\r\nnow,\" replied Calhoun; and Webster blandly retorted, \"I presume the\r\ngentleman has not, and I have quite as little.\" One is reminded here of\r\nDr. Johnson's remark, when he was stretched on a sick-bed, with his\r\ngladiatorial powers of argument suspended by physical exhaustion. \"If\r\nthat fellow Burke were now present,\" the Doctor humorously murmured, \"he\r\nwould certainly kill me.\"\r\n\r\nBut to Webster's eminence as a lawyer and a statesman, it is proper to\r\nadd, that he has never been excelled as a writer of state papers among\r\nthe public men of the United States. Mr. Emerson has a phrase which is\r\nexactly applicable to these efforts of Webster's mind. That phrase is,\r\n\"superb propriety.\" Throughout his despatches, he always seems to feel\r\nthat he impersonates his country; and the gravity and weight of his\r\nstyle are as admirable as its simplicity and majestic ease. \"Daniel\r\nWebster, his mark,\" is indelibly stamped on them all. When the Treaty of\r\nWashington was criticised by the Whigs in the English Parliament,\r\nMacaulay specially noticed the difference in the style of the two\r\nnegotiators. Lord Ashburton, he said, had compromised the honor of his\r\ncountry by \"the humble, caressing, wheedling tone\" of his letters, a\r\ntone which contrasted strangely with \"the firm, resolute, vigilant, and\r\nunyielding manner\" of the American Secretary of State. It is to be\r\nnoticed that no other opponent of Sir Robert Peel's administration, not\r\neven Lord Palmerston and Lord John Russell, struck at the essential\r\nweakness of Lord Ashburton's despatches with the force and sagacity\r\nwhich characterized Macaulay's assault on the treaty. Indeed, a\r\nrhetorician and critic less skilful than Macaulay can easily detect that\r\n\"America\" is represented fully in Webster's despatches, while\r\n\"Britannia\" has a very amiable, but not very forcible, representative in\r\nLord Ashburton. Had Palmerston been the British plenipotentiary, we can\r\neasily imagine how different would have been the task imposed on\r\nWebster. As the American Secretary was generally in the right in every\r\nposition he assumed, he would probably have triumphed even over\r\nPalmerston; but the letters of the \"pluckiest\" of English statesmen\r\nwould, we may be sure, have never been criticised in the House of\r\nCommons as \"humble, wheedling, and caressing.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition, however, to his legal arguments, his senatorial speeches,\r\nand his state papers, Webster is to be considered as the greatest orator\r\nour country has produced in his addresses before miscellaneous\r\nassemblages of the people. In saying this we do not confine the remark\r\nto such noble orations as those on the \"First Settlement of New\r\nEngland,\" \"The Bunker Hill Monument,\" and \"Adams and Jefferson,\" but\r\nextend it so as to include speeches before great masses of people who\r\ncould be hardly distinguished from a mob, and who were under no\r\nrestraint but that imposed by their own self-respect and their respect\r\nfor the orator. On these occasions he was uniformly successful. It is\r\nimpossible to detect, in any reports of these popular addresses, that he\r\never stooped to employ a style of speech or mode of argument commonly\r\nsupposed appropriate to a speaker on the \"stump\"; and yet he was the\r\ngreatest \"stump\" orator that our country has ever seen. He seemed to\r\ndelight in addressing five, or ten, or even twenty thousand people, in\r\nthe open air, trusting that the penetrating tones of his voice would\r\nreach even the ears of those who were on the ragged edges of the swaying\r\ncrowd before him; and he would thus speak to the sovereign people, in\r\ntheir unorganized state as a collection of uneasy and somewhat\r\nbelligerent individuals, with a dignity and majesty similar to the\r\ndignity and majesty which characterized his arguments before the Senate\r\nof the United States, or before a bench of judges. A large portion of\r\nhis published works consist of such speeches, and they rank only second\r\namong the remarkable productions of his mind.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, How could he hold the attention of such audiences\r\nwithout condescending to flatter their prejudices, or without\r\noccasionally acting the part of the sophist and the buffoon? Much may be\r\nsaid, in accounting for this phenomenon, about his widely extended\r\nreputation, his imposing presence, the vulgar curiosity to see a man\r\nwhom even the smallest country newspaper thought of sufficient\r\nimportance to defame, his power of giving vitality to simple words which\r\nthe most ignorant of his auditors could easily understand, and the\r\ninstinctive respect which the rudest kind of men feel for a grand\r\nspecimen of robust manhood. But the real, the substantial source of his\r\npower over such audiences proceeded from his respect for _them_; and\r\ntheir respect for him was more or less consciously founded on the\r\nperception of this fact.\r\n\r\nIndeed, a close scrutiny of his speeches will show how conscientiously\r\nhe regards the rights of other minds, however inferior they may be to\r\nhis own; and this virtue, for it is a virtue, is never more apparent\r\nthan in his arguments and appeals addressed to popular assemblies. No\r\nworking-man, whether farmer, mechanic, factory \"hand,\" or day-laborer,\r\never deemed himself insulted by a word from the lips of Daniel Webster;\r\nhe felt himself rather exalted in his own esteem, for the time, by\r\ncoming in contact with that beneficent and comprehensive intelligence,\r\nwhich cherished among its favorite ideas a scheme for lifting up the\r\nAmerican laborer to a height of comfort and respectability which the\r\nEuropean laborer could hardly hope to attain. Prominent politicians, men\r\nof wealth and influence, statesmen of high social and political rank,\r\nmay, at times, have considered Webster as arrogant and bad-tempered, and\r\nmay, at times, have felt disposed to fasten a quarrel upon him; even in\r\nMassachusetts this disposition broke out in conventions of the party to\r\nwhich he belonged; but it would be in vain to find a single\r\nlaboring-man, whether he met Webster in private, or half pushed and half\r\nfought his way into a mass meeting, in order to get his ears into\r\ncommunication with the orator's voice, who ever heard a word from him\r\nwhich did not exalt the dignity of labor, or which was not full of\r\nsympathy for the laborer's occasional sorrows and privations. Webster\r\nseemed to have ever present to his mind the poverty of the humble home\r\nof his youth. His father, his brothers, he himself, had all been brought\r\nup to consider manual toil a dignified occupation, and as consistent\r\nwith the exercise of all the virtues which flourish under the domestic\r\nroof. More than this, it may be said that, with the exception of a few\r\nintimate friends, his sympathies to the last were most warmly with\r\ncommon laborers. Indeed, if we closely study the private correspondence\r\nof this statesman, who was necessarily brought into relations, more or\r\nless friendly, with the conventionally great men of the world, European\r\nas well as American, we shall find that, after all, he took more real\r\ninterest in Seth Peterson, and John Taylor, and Porter Wright, men\r\nconnected with him in fishing and farming, than he did in the\r\nambassadors of foreign states whom he met as Senator or as Secretary of\r\nState, or in all the members of the polite society of Washington, New\r\nYork, and Boston. He was very near to Nature himself; and the nearer a\r\nman was to Nature, the more he esteemed him. Thus persons who\r\nsuperintended his farms and cattle, or who pulled an oar in his boat\r\nwhen he ventured out in search of cod and halibut, thought \"Squire\r\nWebster\" a man who realized their ideal and perfection of\r\ngood-fellowship while it may confidently be said that many of his\r\nclosest friends among men of culture, including lawyers, men of letters,\r\nand statesmen of the first rank, must have occasionally resented the\r\n\"anfractuosities\" of his mood and temper. But Seth Peterson, and Porter\r\nWright, and John Taylor, never complained of these \"anfractuosities.\"\r\nWebster, in fact, is one of the few public men of the country in whose\r\nchampionship of the rights and sympathy with the wrongs of labor there\r\nis not the slightest trace of the arts of the demagogue; and in this\r\nfact we may find the reason why even the \"roughs,\" who are present in\r\nevery mass meeting, always treated him with respect. Perhaps it would\r\nnot be out of place to remark here, that, in his Speech of the 7th of\r\nMarch, he missed a grand opportunity to vindicate Northern labor, in the\r\nreference he made to a foolish tirade of a Senator from Louisiana, who\r\n\"took pains to run a contrast between the slaves of the South and the\r\nlaboring people of the North, giving the preference, in all points of\r\ncondition, of comfort, and happiness, to the slaves of the South.\"\r\nWebster made a complete reply to this aspersion on Northern labor; but,\r\nas his purpose was to conciliate, he did not blast the libeller by\r\nquoting the most eminent example that could be named demonstrating the\r\nfalsehood of the slave-holding Senator's assertion. Without deviating\r\nfrom the conciliatory attitude he had assumed, one could easily imagine\r\nhim as lifting his large frame to its full height, flashing from his\r\nrebuking eyes a glance of scorn at the \"amiable Senator,\" and simply\r\nsaying, \"_I_ belong to the class which the Senator from Louisiana\r\nstigmatizes as more degraded than the slaves of the South.\" There was\r\nnot at the time any Senator from the South, except Mr. Calhoun, that the\r\nmost prejudiced Southern man would have thought of comparing with\r\nWebster in respect to intellectual eminence; and, if Webster had then\r\nand there placed himself squarely on his position as the son of a\r\nNorthern laborer, we should have been spared all the rhetoric about\r\nNorthern \"mud-sills,\" with which the Senate was afterwards afflicted.\r\nWebster was our man of men; and it would seem that he should have\r\ncrushed such talk at the outset, by proudly assuming that Northern labor\r\nwas embodied and impersonated in him,--that HE had sprung from its\r\nranks, and was proud of his ancestry.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious and powerful, but paradoxical thinker, once told me that I\r\nwas mistaken in calling Jonathan Edwards and Daniel Webster great\r\nreasoners. \"They were bad reasoners,\" he added, \"but great poets.\"\r\nWithout questioning the right of the author of \"An Enquiry into the\r\nModern Prevailing Notion of that Freedom of the Will, which is supposed\r\nto be Essential to Moral Agency,\" to be ranked among the most eminent of\r\nmodern logicians, I could still understand why he was classed among\r\npoets; for whether Edwards paints the torments of hell or the bliss of\r\nheaven, his imagination almost rivals that of Dante in intensity of\r\nrealization. But it was at first puzzling to comprehend why Webster\r\nshould be depressed as a reasoner in order to be exalted as a poet. The\r\nimages and metaphors scattered over his speeches are so evidently\r\nbrought in to illustrate and enforce his statements and arguments, that,\r\ngrand as they often are, the imagination displayed in them is still a\r\nfaculty strictly subsidiary to the reasoning power. It was only after\r\nreflecting patiently for some time on the seeming paradox that I caught\r\na glimpse of my friend's meaning; and it led me at once to consider an\r\nentirely novel question, not heretofore mooted by any of Webster's\r\ncritics, whether friendly or unfriendly, in their endeavors to explain\r\nthe reason of his influence over the best minds of the generation to\r\nwhich he belonged. In declaring that, as a poet, he far exceeded any\r\ncapacity he evinced as a reasoner, my paradoxical friend must have meant\r\nthat Webster had the poet's power of so _organizing_ a speech, that it\r\nstood out to the eye of the mind as a palpable intellectual product and\r\nfact, possessing, not merely that vague reality which comes from\r\nerecting a plausible mental structure of deductive argumentation, based\r\non strictly limited premises, but a positive reality, akin to the\r\nproducts of Nature herself, when she tries her hand in constructing a\r\nledge of rocks or rearing a chain of hills.\r\n\r\nIn illustration, it may be well to cite the example of poets with whom\r\nWebster, of course, cannot be compared. Among the great mental facts,\r\npalpable to the eyes of all men interested in literature, are such\r\ncreations as the Iliad, the Divine Comedy, the great Shakspearian\r\ndramas, the Paradise Lost, and Faust. The commentaries and criticisms on\r\nthese are numerous enough to occupy the shelves of a large library; some\r\nof them attempt to show that Homer, Dante, Shakspeare, Milton, and\r\nGoethe were all wrong in their methods of creation; but they still\r\ncannot obscure, to ordinary vision, the lustre of these luminaries as\r\nthey placidly shine in the intellectual firmament, which is literally\r\n_over_ our heads. They are as palpable, to the eye of the mind, as\r\nSirius, Arcturus, the Southern Cross, and the planets Venus, Mars,\r\nJupiter, and Saturn, are to the bodily sense. M. Taine has recently\r\nassailed the Paradise Lost with the happiest of French epigrams; he\r\ntries to prove that, in construction, it is the most ridiculously\r\ninartistic monstrosity that the imagination of a great mind ever framed\r\nout of chaos; but, after we have thoroughly enjoyed the play of his wit,\r\nthere the Paradise Lost remains, an undisturbed object in the\r\nintellectual heavens, disdaining to justify its right to exist on any\r\nother grounds than the mere fact of its existence; and, certainly, not\r\nmore ridiculous than Saturn himself, as we look at him through a great\r\nequatorial telescope, swinging through space encumbered with his clumsy\r\nring, and his wrangling family of satellites, but still, in spite of\r\npeculiarities on which M. Taine might exercise his wit until doomsday,\r\none of the most beautiful and sublime objects which the astronomer can\r\nbehold in the whole phenomena of the heavens.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in reading criticisms on such durable poetic creations and\r\norganizations as we have named, one is reminded of Sydney Smith's\r\ndelicious chaffing of his friend Jeffrey, on account of Jeffrey's\r\nsensitiveness of literary taste, and his inward rage that events, men,\r\nand books, outside of him, do not correspond to the exacting rules which\r\nare the products of his own subjective and somewhat peevish\r\nintelligence. \"I like,\" says Sydney, \"to tell you these things, because\r\nyou never do so well as when you are humbled and frightened, and, if\r\n_you could be alarmed into the semblance of modesty_, you would charm\r\neverybody; but remember my joke against you about the moon: 'D--n the\r\nsolar system! bad light--planets too distant--pestered with\r\ncomets--feeble contrivance; could make a better with great ease.'\"\r\n\r\nNow when a man, in whatever department or direction of thought his\r\nactivity is engaged, succeeds in organizing, or even welding together,\r\nthe materials on which he works, so that the product, as a whole, is\r\n_visible_ to the mental eye, as a new creation or construction, he has\r\nan immense advantage over all critics of his performance. Refined\r\nreasonings are impotent to overthrow it; epigrams glance off from it, as\r\nrifle-bullets rebound when aimed at a granite wall; and it stands erect\r\nlong after the reasonings and the epigrams are forgotten. Even when its\r\nsymmetry is destroyed by a long and destructive siege, a pile of stones\r\nstill remains, as at Fort Sumter, to attest what power of resistance it\r\nopposed to all the resources of modern artillery.\r\n\r\nIf we look at Webster's greatest speeches, as, for instance, \"The Reply\r\nto Hayne,\" \"The Constitution not a Compact between Sovereign States,\"\r\n\"The President's Protest,\" and others that might be mentioned, we shall\r\nfind that they partake of the character of organic formations, or at\r\nleast of skilful engineering or architectural constructions. Even Mr.\r\nCalhoun never approached him in this art of giving objective reality to\r\na speech, which, after all, is found, on analysis, to consist only of a\r\nhappy collocation and combination of words, but in Webster the words are\r\neither all alive with the creative spirit of the poet, or, at the worst,\r\nresemble the blocks of granite or marble which the artisan piles, one on\r\nthe other, and the result of which, though it may represent a poor style\r\nof architecture, is still a rude specimen of a Gothic edifice. The\r\nartist and artificer are both observable in Webster's work; but the\r\nreality and solidity of the construction cannot be questioned. At the\r\npresent time, an educated reader would be specially interested in the\r\nmental processes by which Webster thus succeeded in giving objective\r\nexistence and validity to the operations of his mind, and, whether\r\nsympathizing with his opinions or not, would as little think of refusing\r\nto read them because of their Whiggism, as he would think of refusing to\r\nread Homer because of his heathenism, or Dante because of his\r\nCatholicism, or Milton because of his compound of Arianism and\r\nCalvinism, or Goethe because of his Pantheism. The fact which would most\r\ninterest such a reader would be, that Webster had, in some mysterious\r\nway, translated and transformed his abstract propositions into concrete\r\nsubstance and form. The form might offend his reason, his taste, or his\r\nconscience; but he could not avoid admitting that it _had_ a form, while\r\nmost speeches, even those made by able men, are comparatively formless,\r\nhowever lucid they may be in the array of facts, and plausible in the\r\norder and connection of arguments.\r\n\r\nIn trying to explain this power, the most obvious comparison which would\r\narise in the mind of an intelligent reader would be, that Webster, as a\r\nrhetorician, resembled Vauban and Cohorn as military engineers. In the\r\nwar of debate, he so _fortified_ the propositions he maintained, that\r\nthey could not be carried by direct assault, but must be patiently\r\nbesieged. The words he employed were simple enough, and fell short of\r\nincluding the vocabulary of even fifth-rate declaimers; but he had the\r\nart of so disposing them that, to an honest reasoner, the position he\r\ntook appeared to be impregnable. To assail it by the ordinary method of\r\npassionate protest and illogical reasoning, was as futile as a dash of\r\nlight cavalry would have been against the defences of such cities as\r\nNamur and Lille. Indeed, in his speech, \"The Constitution not a Compact\r\nbetween Sovereign States,\" he erected a whole Torres Vedras line of\r\nfortifications, on which legislative Massenas dashed themselves in vain,\r\nand, however strong in numbers in respect to the power of voting him\r\ndown, recoiled defeated in every attempt to reason him down.\r\n\r\nIn further illustration of this peculiar power of Webster, the Speech of\r\nthe 7th of March, 1850, may be cited, for its delivery is to be ranked\r\nwith the most important historical events. For some years it was the\r\nobject of the extremes of panegyric and the extremes of execration. But\r\nthis effort is really the most loosely constructed of all the great\r\nproductions of Webster's mind. In force, compactness, and completeness,\r\nin closeness of thought to things, in closeness of imagery to the\r\nreasoning it illustrates, and in general intellectual fibre, muscle, and\r\nbone, it cannot be compared to such an oration as that on the \"First\r\nSettlement of New England,\" or such a speech as that which had for its\r\ntheme, \"The Constitution not a Compact between Sovereign States\"; but,\r\nafter all deductions have been made, it was still a speech which frowned\r\nupon its opponents as a kind of verbal fortress constructed both for the\r\npurpose of defence and aggression. Its fame is due, in a great degree,\r\nto its resistance to a storm of assaults, such as had rarely before been\r\nconcentrated on any speech delivered in either branch of the Congress of\r\nthe United States. Indeed, a very large portion of the intellect, the\r\nmoral sentiment, and the moral passion of the free States was directed\r\nagainst it. There was not a weapon in the armory of the dialectician or\r\nthe rhetorician which was not employed with the intent of demolishing\r\nit. Contempt of Webster was vehemently taught as the beginning of\r\npolitical wisdom. That a speech, thus assailed, should survive the\r\nattacks made upon it, appeared to be impossible. And yet it did survive,\r\nand is alive now, while better speeches, or what the present writer\r\nthought, at the time, to be more convincing speeches, have not retained\r\nindividual existence, however deeply they may have influenced that\r\npublic opinion which, in the end, determines political events. \"I still\r\nlive,\" was Webster's declaration on his death-bed, when the friends\r\ngathered around it imagined he had breathed his last; and the same words\r\nmight be uttered by the Speech of the 7th of March, could it possess the\r\nvocal organ which announces personal existence. Between the time it was\r\noriginally delivered and the present year there runs a great and broad\r\nstream of blood, shed from the veins of Northern and Southern men alike;\r\nthe whole political and moral constitution of the country has\r\npractically suffered an abrupt change; new problems engage the attention\r\nof thoughtful statesmen; much is forgotten which was once considered of\r\nthe first importance; but the 7th of March Speech, battered as it is by\r\ninnumerable attacks, is still remembered at least as one which called\r\nforth more power than it embodied in itself. This persistence of life is\r\ndue to the fact that it was \"organized.\"\r\n\r\nIs this power of organization common among orators? It seems to me\r\nthat, on the contrary, it is very rare. In some of Burke's speeches, in\r\nwhich his sensibility and imagination were thoroughly under the control\r\nof his judgment, as, for instance, his speech on Conciliation with\r\nAmerica, that on Economical Reform, and that to the Electors of Bristol,\r\nwe find the orator to be a consummate master of the art of so\r\nconstructing a speech that it serves the immediate object which prompted\r\nits delivery, while at the same time it has in it a principle of\r\nvitality which makes it survive the occasion that called it forth. But\r\nthe greatest of Burke's speeches, if we look merely at the richness and\r\nvariety of mental power and the force and depth of moral passion\r\ndisplayed in it, is his speech on the Nabob of Arcot's Debts. No speech\r\never delivered before any assembly, legislative, judicial, or popular,\r\ncan rank with this in respect to the abundance of its facts, reasonings,\r\nand imagery, and the ferocity of its moral wrath. It resembles the El\r\nDorado that Voltaire's Candide visited, where the boys played with\r\nprecious stones of inestimable value, as our boys play with ordinary\r\nmarbles; for to the inhabitants of El Dorado diamonds and pearls were as\r\ncommon as pebbles are with us.\r\n\r\nBut the defect of this speech, which must still be considered, on the\r\nwhole, the most inspired product of Burke's great nature, was this,--\r\nthat it did not strike its hearers or readers as having _reality_ for\r\nits basis or the superstructure raised upon it. Englishmen could not\r\nbelieve then, and most of them probably do not believe now, that it had\r\nany solid foundation in incontrovertible facts. It did not \"fit in\" to\r\ntheir ordinary modes of thought; and it has never been ranked with\r\nBurke's \"organized\" orations; it has never come home to what Bacon\r\ncalled the \"business and bosoms\" of his countrymen. They have generally\r\ndismissed it from their imaginations as \"a phantasmagoria and a hideous\r\ndream\" created by Burke under the impulse of the intense hatred he felt\r\nfor the administration which succeeded the overthrow of the government,\r\nwhich was founded on the coalition of Fox and North.\r\n\r\nNow, in simple truth, the speech is the most masterly statement of\r\nfacts, relating to the oppression of millions of the people of India,\r\nwhich was ever forced on the attention of the House of Commons,--a\r\nlegislative assembly which, it may be incidentally remarked, was\r\npractically responsible for the just government of the immense Indian\r\nempire of Great Britain. It is curious that the main facts on which the\r\nargument of Burke rests have been confirmed by James Mill, the\r\ncoldest-blooded historian that ever narrated the enormous crimes which\r\nattended the rise and progress of the British power in Hindostan, and a\r\nman who also had a strong intellectual antipathy to the mind of Burke.\r\nIn making the speech, Burke had documentary evidence of a large portion\r\nof the transactions he denounced, and had _divined_ the rest. Mill\r\nsupports him both as regards the facts of which Burke had positive\r\nknowledge, and the facts which he deductively inferred from the facts he\r\nknew. Having thus a strong foundation for his argument, he exerted every\r\nfaculty of his mind, and every impulse of his moral sentiment and moral\r\npassion, to overwhelm the leading members of the administration of Pitt,\r\nby attempting to make them accomplices in crimes which would disgrace\r\neven slave-traders on the Guinea coast. The merely intellectual force of\r\nhis reasoning is crushing; his analysis seems to be sharpened by his\r\nhatred; and there is no device of contempt, scorn, derision, and direct\r\npersonal attack, which he does not unsparingly use. In the midst of all\r\nthis mental tumult, inestimable maxims of moral and political wisdom are\r\nshot forth in short sentences, which have so much of the sting and\r\nbrilliancy of epigram, that at first we do not appreciate their depth of\r\nthought; and through all there burns such a pitiless fierceness of moral\r\nreprobation of cruelty, injustice, and wrong, that all the accredited\r\ncourtesies of debate are violated, once, at least, in every five\r\nminutes. In any American legislative assembly he would have been called\r\nto order at least once in five minutes. The images which the orator\r\nbrings in to give vividness to his argument are sometimes coarse; but,\r\ncoarse as they are, they admirably reflect the moral turpitude of the\r\nmen against whom he inveighs. Among these is the image with which he\r\ncovers Dundas, the special friend of Pitt, with a ridicule which\r\npromises to be immortal. Dundas, on the occasion when Fox and Burke\r\ncalled for papers by the aid of which they proposed to demonstrate the\r\niniquity of the scheme by which the ministry proposed to settle the\r\ndebts of the Nabob of Arcot, pretended that the production of such\r\npapers would be indelicate,--\"that this inquiry is of a delicate nature,\r\nand that the state will suffer detriment by the exposure of this\r\ntransaction.\" As Dundas had previously brought out six volumes of\r\nReports, generally confirming Burke's own views of the corruption and\r\noppression which marked the administration of affairs in India, he laid\r\nhimself open to Burke's celebrated assault. Dundas and delicacy, he\r\nsaid, were \"a rare and singular coalition.\" And then follows an image of\r\ncolossal coarseness, such as might be supposed capable of rousing\r\nthunder-peals of laughter from a company of festive giants,--an image\r\nwhich Lord Brougham declared offended _his_ sensitive taste,--the\r\nsensitive taste of one of the most formidable legal and legislative\r\nbullies that ever appeared before the juries or Parliament of Great\r\nBritain, and who never hesitated to use any illustration, however\r\nvulgar, which he thought would be effective to degrade his opponents.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be thought of the indelicacy of Burke's image, it was\r\none eminently adapted to penetrate through the thick hide of the\r\nminister of state at whom it was aimed, and it shamed him as far as a\r\nprofligate politician like Dundas was capable of feeling the sensation\r\nof shame. But there are also flashes, or rather flames, of impassioned\r\nimagination, in the same speech, which rush up from the main body of its\r\nstatements and arguments, and remind us of nothing so much as of those\r\njets of incandescent gas which, we are told by astronomers, occasionally\r\nleap, from the extreme outer covering of the sun, to the height of a\r\nhundred or a hundred and sixty thousand miles, and testify to the\r\nterrible forces raging within it. After reading this speech for the\r\nfiftieth time, the critic cannot free himself from the rapture of\r\nadmiration and amazement which he experienced in his first fresh\r\nacquaintance with it. Yet its delivery in the House of Commons (February\r\n28, 1785) produced an effect so slight, that Pitt, after a few minutes'\r\nconsultation with Grenville, concluded that it was not worth the trouble\r\nof being answered; and the House of Commons, obedient to the Prime\r\nMinister's direction, negatived, by a large majority, the motion in\r\nadvocating which Burke poured out the wonderful treasures of his\r\nintellect and imagination. To be sure, the House was tired to death with\r\nthe discussion, was probably very sleepy, and the orator spoke five\r\nhours after the members had already shouted, \"Question! Question!\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that this speech, unmatched though it is in the literature\r\nof eloquence, had not, as has been previously stated, the air of\r\nreality. It struck the House as a magnificent Oriental dream, as an\r\nArabian Nights' Entertainment, as a tale told by an inspired madman,\r\n\"full of sound and fury, signifying nothing\"; and the evident partisan\r\nintention of the orator to blast Pitt's administration by exhibiting its\r\ncomplicity in one of the most enormous frauds recorded in history,\r\nconfirmed the dandies, the cockneys, the bankers, and the country\r\ngentlemen, who, as members of the House of Commons, stood by Pitt with\r\nall the combined force of their levity, their venality, and their\r\nstupidity, in the propriety of voting Burke down. And even now, when the\r\nsubstantial truth of all the facts he alleged is established on evidence\r\nwhich convinces historians, the admiring reader can understand why it\r\nfailed to convince Burke's contemporaries, and why it still appears to\r\nlack the characteristics of a speech thoroughly organized. Indeed, the\r\nmind of Burke, when it was delivered, can only be compared to a volcanic\r\nmountain in eruption;--not merely a volcano like that of Vesuvius,\r\nvisited by scientists and amateurs in crowds, when it deigns to pour\r\nforth its flames and lava for the entertainment of the multitude; but a\r\nlonely volcano, like that of Etna, rising far above Vesuvius in height,\r\nfar removed from all the vulgar curiosity of a body of tourists, but\r\nrending the earth on which it stands with the mighty earthquake throes\r\nof its fiery centre and heart. The moral passion,--perhaps it would be\r\nmore just to say the moral fury,--displayed in the speech, is elemental,\r\nand can be compared to nothing less intense than the earth's interior\r\nfire and heat.\r\n\r\nNow in Webster's great legislative efforts, his mind is never exhibited\r\nin a state of eruption. In the most excited debates in which he bore a\r\nprominent part, nothing strikes us more than the admirable\r\nself-possession, than the majestic inward calm, which presides over all\r\nthe operations of his mind and the impulses of his sensibility, so that,\r\nin building up the fabric of his speech, he has his reason, imagination,\r\nand passion under full control,--using each faculty and feeling as the\r\noccasion may demand, but never allowing himself to be used _by_ it,--and\r\nalways therefore conveying the impression of power in reserve, while he\r\nmay, in fact, be exercising all the power he has to the utmost. In\r\nlaboriously erecting his edifice of reasoning he also studiously regards\r\nthe intellects and the passions of ordinary men; strives to bring his\r\nmind into cordial relations with theirs; employs every faculty he\r\npossesses to give reality, to give even visibility, to his thoughts; and\r\nthough he never made a speech which rivals that of Burke on the Nabob of\r\nArcot's Debts, in respect to grasp of understanding, astounding wealth\r\nof imagination and depth of moral passion, he always so contrived to\r\norganize his materials into a complete whole, that the result stood out\r\nclearly to the sight of the mind, as a structure resting on strong\r\nfoundations, and reared to due height by the mingled skill of the\r\nartisan and the artist. When he does little more than weld his materials\r\ntogether, he is still an artificer of the old school of giant workmen,\r\nthe school that dates its pedigree from Tubal Cain.\r\n\r\nAfter all this wearisome detail and dilution of the idea attempted to be\r\nexpressed, it may be that I have failed to convey an adequate impression\r\nof what constitutes Webster's distinction among orators, as far as\r\norators have left speeches which are considered an invaluable addition\r\nto the literature of the language in which they were originally\r\ndelivered. Everybody understands why any one of the great sermons of\r\nJeremy Taylor, or the sermon of Dr. South on \"Man created in the Image\r\nof God,\" or the sermon of Dr. Barrow on \"Heavenly Rest,\" differs from\r\nthe millions on millions of doubtless edifying sermons that have been\r\npreached and printed during the last two centuries and a half; but\r\neverybody does not understand the distinction between one brilliant\r\noration and another, when both made a great sensation at the time, while\r\nonly one survived in literature. Probably Charles James Fox was a more\r\neffective speaker in the House of Commons than Edmund Burke, probably\r\nHenry Clay was a more effective speaker in Congress than Daniel Webster;\r\nbut when the occasions on which their speeches were made are found\r\ngradually to fade from the memory of men, why is it that the speeches of\r\nFox and Clay have no recognized position in literature, while those of\r\nBurke and Webster are ranked with literary productions of the first\r\nclass? The reason is as really obvious as that which explains the\r\nexceptional value of some of the efforts of the great orators of the\r\npulpit. Jeremy Taylor, Dr. South, and Dr. Barrow, different as they were\r\nin temper and disposition, succeeded in \"organizing\" some masterpieces\r\nin their special department of intellectual and moral activity; and the\r\nsame is true of Burke and Webster in the departments of legislation and\r\npolitical science. The \"occasion\" was merely an opportunity for the\r\nconsolidation into a speech of the rare powers and attainments, the\r\nlarge personality and affluent thought, which were the spiritual\r\npossessions of the man who made it,--a speech which represented the\r\nwhole intellectual manhood of the speaker,--a manhood in which\r\nknowledge, reason, imagination, and sensibility were all consolidated\r\nunder the directing power of will.\r\n\r\nA pertinent example of the difference we have attempted to indicate may\r\nbe easily found in contrasting Fox's closing speech on the East India\r\nBill with Burke's on the same subject. For immediate effect on the House\r\nof Commons, it ranks with the most masterly of Fox's Parliamentary\r\nefforts. The hits on his opponents were all \"telling.\" The _argumentum\r\nad hominem_, embodied in short, sharp statements, or startling\r\ninterrogatories, was never employed with more brilliant success. The\r\nreasoning was rapid, compact, encumbered by no long enumeration of\r\nfacts, and, though somewhat unscrupulous here and there, was driven home\r\nupon his adversaries with a skill that equalled its audacity. It may be\r\nsaid that there is not a sentence in the whole speech which was not\r\ncalculated to sting a sleepy audience into attention, or to give\r\ndelight to a fatigued audience which still managed to keep its eyes and\r\nminds wide open. Even in respect to the principles of liberty and\r\njustice, which were the animating life of the bill, Fox's terse\r\nsentences contrast strangely with the somewhat more lumbering and\r\nelaborate paragraphs of Burke. \"What,\" he exclaims, putting his argument\r\nin his favorite interrogative form,--\"what is the most odious species of\r\ntyranny? Precisely that which this bill is meant to annihilate. That a\r\nhandful of men, free themselves, should exercise the most base and\r\nabominable despotism over millions of their fellow-creatures; that\r\ninnocence should be the victim of oppression; that industry should toil\r\nfor rapine; that the harmless laborer should sweat, not for his own\r\nbenefit, but for the luxury and rapacity of tyrannic depredation;--in a\r\nword, that thirty millions of men, gifted by Providence with the\r\nordinary endowments of humanity, should groan under a system of\r\ndespotism unmatched in all the histories of the world? What is the end\r\nof all government? Certainly, the happiness of the governed. Others may\r\nhold different opinions; but this is mine, and I proclaim it. What,\r\nthen, are we to think of a government whose good fortune is supposed to\r\nspring from the calamities of its subjects, whose aggrandizement grows\r\nout of the miseries of mankind? This is the kind of government exercised\r\nunder the East Indian Company upon the natives of Hindostan; and the\r\nsubversion of that infamous government is the main object of the bill in\r\nquestion.\" And afterwards he says, with admirable point and pungency of\r\nstatement: \"Every line in both the bills which I have had the honor to\r\nintroduce, presumes the possibility of bad administration; for every\r\nword breathes suspicion. This bill supposes that men are but men. It\r\nconfides in no integrity; it trusts no character; it inculcates the\r\nwisdom of a jealousy of power, and annexes responsibility, not only to\r\nevery _action_, but even to the _inaction_ of those who are to dispense\r\nit. The necessity of these provisions must be evident, when it is known\r\nthat the different misfortunes of the company have resulted not more\r\nfrom what their servants _did_, than from what the _masters did not_.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a directness in such sentences as these which we do not find in\r\nBurke's speech on the East India Bill; but Burke's remains as a part of\r\nEnglish literature, and in form and substance, especially in substance,\r\nis so immensely superior to that of Fox, that, in quoting sentences from\r\nthe latter, one may almost be supposed to rescue them from that neglect\r\nwhich attends all speeches which do not reach beyond the occasion which\r\ncalls them forth. In Bacon's phrase, the speech of Fox shows \"small\r\nmatter, and infinite agitation of wit\"; in Burke's, we discern large\r\nmatter with an abundance of \"wit\" proper to the discussion of the\r\nmatter, but nothing which suggests the idea of mere \"agitation.\" Fox, in\r\nhis speeches, subordinated every thing to the immediate impression he\r\nmight make on the House of Commons. He deliberately gave it as his\r\nopinion, that a speech that read well must be a bad speech; and, in a\r\nliterary sense, the House of Commons, which he entered before he was\r\ntwenty, may be called both the cradle and the grave of his fame. It has\r\nbeen said that he was a debater whose speeches should be studied by\r\nevery man who wishes \"to learn the science of logical defence\"; that he\r\nalone, among English orators, resembles Demosthenes, inasmuch as his\r\nreasoning is \"penetrated and made red-hot by passion\"; and that nothing\r\ncould excel the effect of his delivery when \"he was in the full paroxysm\r\nof inspiration, foaming, screaming, choked by the rushing multitude of\r\nhis words.\" But not one of his speeches, not even that on the East India\r\nBill, or on the Westminster Scrutiny, or on the Russian Armament, or on\r\nParliamentary Reform, or on Mr. Pitt's Rejection of Bonaparte's\r\nOvertures for Peace, has obtained an abiding place in the literature of\r\nGreat Britain. It would be no disparagement to an educated man, if it\r\nwere said that he had never read these speeches; but it would be a\r\nserious bar to his claim to be considered an English scholar, if he\r\nconfessed to be ignorant of the great speeches of Burke; for such a\r\nconfession would be like admitting that he had never read the first book\r\nof Hooker's Ecclesiastical Polity, Bacon's Essays and Advancement of\r\nLearning, Milton's Areopagitica, Butler's Analogy, and Adam Smith's\r\nWealth of Nations.\r\n\r\nWhen we reflect on the enormous number of American speeches which, when\r\nthey were first delivered, were confidently predicted, by appreciating\r\nfriends, to insure to the orators a fame which would be immortal, one\r\nwonders a little at the quiet persistence of the speeches of Webster in\r\nrefusing to die with the abrupt suddenness of other orations, which, at\r\nthe time of their delivery, seemed to have an equal chance of renown.\r\nThe lifeless remains of such unfortunate failures are now entombed in\r\nthat dreariest of all mausoleums, the dingy quarto volumes, hateful to\r\nall human eyes, which are lettered on the back with the title of\r\n\"Congressional Debates,\"--a collection of printed matter which members\r\nof Congress are wont to send to a favored few among their constituents,\r\nand which are immediately consigned to the dust-barrel or sold to\r\npedlers in waste paper, according as the rage of the recipients takes a\r\nscornful or an economical direction. It would seem that the speeches of\r\nWebster are saved from this fate, by the fact that, in them, the mental\r\nand moral life of a great man, and of a great master of the English\r\nlanguage, are organized in a palpable intellectual form. The reader\r\nfeels that they have some of the substantial qualities which he\r\nrecognizes in looking at the gigantic constructions of the master\r\nworkmen among the crowd of the world's engineers and architects, in\r\nlooking at the organic products of Nature herself, and in surveying,\r\nthrough the eye of his imagination, those novel reproductions of Nature\r\nwhich great poets have embodied in works which are indelibly stamped\r\nwith the character of deathlessness.\r\n\r\nBut Webster is even more obviously a poet--subordinating \"the shows of\r\nthings to the desires of the mind\"--in his magnificent idealization, or\r\nidolization, of the Constitution and the Union. By the magic of his\r\nimagination and sensibility he contrived to impress on the minds of a\r\nmajority of the people of the free States a vague, grand idea that the\r\nConstitution was a sacred instrument of government,--a holy shrine of\r\nfundamental law, which no unhallowed hands could touch without\r\nprofanation,--a digested system of rights and duties, resembling those\r\ninstitutes which were, in early times, devised by the immortal gods for\r\nthe guidance of infirm mortal man; and the mysterious creatures, half\r\ndivine and half human, who framed this remarkable document, were always\r\nreverently referred to as \"the Fathers,\"--as persons who excelled all\r\nsucceeding generations in sagacity and wisdom; as inspired prophets, who\r\nwere specially selected by Divine Providence to frame the political\r\nscriptures on which our political faith was to be based, and by which\r\nour political reason was to be limited. The splendor of the glamour thus\r\ncast over the imaginations and sentiments of the people was all the more\r\neffective because it was an effluence from the mind of a statesman who,\r\nof all other statesmen of the country, was deemed the most practical,\r\nand the least deluded by any misguiding lights of fancy and abstract\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that Webster's impressive idealization of the\r\nConstitution gave a certain narrowness to American thinking on\r\nconstitutional government and the science of politics and legislation.\r\nForeigners, of the most liberal views, could not sometimes restrain an\r\nexpression of wonder, when they found that our most intelligent men,\r\neven our jurists and publicists, hardly condescended to notice the\r\neminent European thinkers on the philosophy of government, so absorbed\r\nwere they in the contemplation of the perfection of their own. When the\r\ngreat civil war broke out, hundreds of thousands of American citizens\r\nmarched to the battle-field with the grand passages of Webster glowing\r\nin their hearts. They met death cheerfully in the cause of the\r\n\"Constitution and Union,\" as by him expounded and idealized; and if they\r\nwere so unfortunate as not to be killed, but to be taken captive, they\r\nstill rotted to death in Southern prisons, sustained by sentences of\r\nWebster's speeches which they had declaimed as boys in their country\r\nschools. Of all the triumphs of Webster as a leader of public opinion,\r\nthe most remarkable was his infusing into the minds of the people of the\r\nfree States the belief that the Constitution as it existed in his time\r\nwas an organic fact, springing from the intelligence, hearts, and wills\r\nof the people of the United States, and not, as it really was, an\r\ningenious mechanical contrivance of wise men, to which the people, at\r\nthe time, gave their assent.\r\n\r\nThe constitutions of the separate States of the Union were doubtless\r\nrooted in the habits, sentiments, and ideas of their inhabitants. But\r\nthe Constitution of the United States could not possess this advantage,\r\nhowever felicitously it may have been framed for the purpose of keeping,\r\nfor a considerable period, peace between the different sections of the\r\ncountry. As long, therefore, as the institution of negro slavery lasted,\r\nit could not be called a Constitution of States organically \"United\";\r\nfor it lacked the principle of _growth_, which characterizes all\r\nconstitutions of government which are really adapted to the progressive\r\nneeds of a people, if the people have in them any impulse which\r\nstimulates them to advance. The unwritten constitution of Great Britain\r\nhas this advantage, that a decree of Parliament can alter the whole\r\nrepresentative system, annihilating by a vote of the two houses all laws\r\nwhich the Parliament had enacted in former years. In Great Britain,\r\ntherefore, a measure which any Imperial Parliament passes becomes at\r\nonce the supreme law of the land, though it may nullify a great number\r\nof laws which previous Parliaments had passed under different conditions\r\nof the sentiment of the nation. Our Constitution, on the other hand,\r\nprovides for the contingencies of growth in the public sentiment only by\r\namendments to the Constitution. These amendments require more than a\r\nmajority of all the political forces represented in Congress; and Mr.\r\nCalhoun, foreseeing that a collision must eventually occur between the\r\ntwo sections, carried with him, not only the South, but a considerable\r\nminority of the North, in resisting any attempt to limit the _extension_\r\nof slavery. On this point the passions and principles of the people of\r\nthe slave-holding and the majority of the people of the\r\nnon-slave-holding States came into violent opposition; and there was no\r\npossibility that any amendment to the Constitution could be ratified,\r\nwhich would represent either the growth of the Southern people in their\r\never-increasing belief that negro slavery was not only a good in itself,\r\nbut a good which ought to be extended, or the growth of the Northern\r\npeople in their ever-increasing hostility both to slavery and its\r\nextension. Thus two principles, each organic in its nature, and\r\ndemanding indefinite development, came into deadly conflict under the\r\nmechanical forms of a Constitution which was not organic.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the speeches in this volume is devoted to\r\ndenunciations of violations of the Constitution perpetrated by Webster's\r\npolitical opponents. These violations, again, would seem to prove that\r\nwritten constitutions follow practically the same law of development\r\nwhich marks the progress of the unwritten. By a strained system of\r\nCongressional interpretation, the Constitution has been repeatedly\r\ncompelled to yield to the necessities of the party dominant, for the\r\ntime, in the government; and has, if we may believe Webster, been\r\nrepeatedly changed without being constitutionally \"amended.\" The causes\r\nwhich led to the most terrible civil war recorded in history were\r\nsilently working beneath the forms of the Constitution,--both parties,\r\nby the way, appealing to its provisions,--while Webster was idealizing\r\nit as the utmost which humanity could come to in the way of civil\r\ngovernment. In 1848, when nearly all Europe was in insurrection against\r\nits rulers, he proudly said that our Constitution promised to be the\r\n_oldest_, as well as the best, in civilized states. Meanwhile the\r\ninstitution of negro slavery was undermining the whole fabric of the\r\nUnion. The moral division between the South and North was widening into\r\na division between the religion of the two sections. The Southern\r\nstatesmen, economists, jurists, publicists, and ethical writers had\r\nadapted their opinions to the demands which the defenders of the\r\ninstitution of slavery imposed on the action of the human intellect and\r\nconscience; but it was rather startling to discover that the Christian\r\nreligion, as taught in the Southern States, was a religion which had no\r\nvital connection with the Christianity taught in the Northern States.\r\nThere is nothing more astounding, to a patient explorer of the causes\r\nwhich led to the final explosion, than this opposition of religions. The\r\nmere form of the dogmas common to the religion of both sections might be\r\nverbally identical; but a volume of sermons by a Southern doctor of\r\ndivinity, as far as he touched on the matter of slavery, was as\r\ndifferent from one published by his Northern brother, in the essential\r\nmoral and humane elements of Christianity, as though they were divided\r\nfrom each other by a gulf as wide as that which yawns between a Druid\r\npriest and a Christian clergyman.\r\n\r\nThe politicians of the South, whether they were the mouthpieces of the\r\nideas and passions of their constituents, or were, as Webster probably\r\nthought, more or less responsible for their foolishness and bitterness,\r\nwere ever eager to precipitate a conflict, which Webster was as eager to\r\nprevent, or at least to postpone. It was fortunate for the North, that\r\nthe inevitable conflict did not come in 1850, when the free States were\r\nunprepared for it. Ten years of discussion and preparation were allowed;\r\nwhen the war broke out, it found the North in a position to meet and\r\neventually to overcome the enemies of the Union; and the Constitution,\r\nnot as it _was_, but as it _is_, now represents a form of government\r\nwhich promises to be permanent; for after passing through its baptism of\r\nfire and blood, the Constitution contains nothing which is not in\r\nharmony with any State government founded on the principle of equal\r\nrights which it guarantees, and is proof against all attacks but those\r\nwhich may proceed from the extremes of human folly and wickedness. But\r\nthat, before the civil war, it was preserved so long under conditions\r\nwhich constantly threatened it with destruction, is due in a\r\nconsiderable degree to the circumstance that it found in Daniel Webster\r\nits poet as well as its \"expounder.\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be said that the style of Webster is pre-eminently\r\ndistinguished by manliness. Nothing little, weak, whining, or\r\nsentimental can be detected in any page of the six volumes of his works.\r\nA certain strength and grandeur of personality is prominent in all his\r\nspeeches. When he says \"I,\" or \"my,\" he never appears to indulge in the\r\nbravado of self-assertion, because the words are felt to express a\r\npositive, stalwart, almost colossal manhood, which had already been\r\nimplied in the close-knit sentences in which he embodied his statements\r\nand arguments. He is an eminent instance of the power which character\r\ncommunicates to style. Though evidently proud, self-respecting, and\r\nhigh-spirited, he is ever above mere vanity and egotism. Whenever he\r\ngives emphasis to the personal pronoun the reader feels that he had as\r\nmuch earned the right to make his opinion an authority, as he had earned\r\nthe right to use the words he employs to express his ideas and\r\nsentiments. Thus, in the celebrated _Smith Will_ trial, his antagonist,\r\nMr. Choate, quoted a decision of Lord Chancellor Camden. In his reply,\r\nWebster argued against its validity as though it were merely a\r\nproposition laid down by Mr. Choate. \"But it is not mine, it is Lord\r\nCamden's\" was the instant retort. Webster paused for half a minute, and\r\nthen, with his eye fixed on the presiding judge, he replied: \"Lord\r\nCamden was a great judge; he is respected by every American, for he was\r\non our side in the Revolution; but, may it please your honor, _I_ differ\r\nfrom my Lord Camden.\" There was hardly a lawyer in the United States who\r\ncould have made such a statement without exposing himself to ridicule;\r\nbut it did not seem at all ridiculous, when the \"I\" stood for Daniel\r\nWebster. In his early career as a lawyer, his mode of reasoning was such\r\nas to make him practically a thirteenth juror in the panel; when his\r\nfame was fully established, he contrived, in some mysterious way, to\r\nseat himself by the side of the judges on the bench, and appear to be\r\nconsulting with them as a jurist, rather than addressing them as an\r\nadvocate. The personality of the man was always suppressed until there\r\nseemed to be need of asserting it; and then it was proudly pushed into\r\nprominence, though rarely passing beyond the limits which his\r\nacknowledged eminence as a statesman and lawyer did not justify him in\r\nasserting it. Among the selections in the present volume where his\r\nindividuality becomes somewhat aggressive, and breaks loose from the\r\nrestraints ordinarily self-imposed on it, may be mentioned his speech on\r\nhis Reception at Boston (1842), his Marshfield Speech (1848), and his\r\nspeech at his Reception at Buffalo (1851). Whatever may be thought of\r\nthe course of argument pursued in these, they are at least thoroughly\r\npenetrated with a manly spirit,--a manliness somewhat haughty and\r\ndefiant, but still consciously strong in its power to return blow for\r\nblow, from whatever quarter the assault may come.\r\n\r\nBut the real intellectual and moral manliness of Webster underlies all\r\nhis great orations and speeches, even those where the animating life\r\nwhich gives them the power to persuade, convince, and uplift the\r\nreader's mind, seems to be altogether impersonal; and this plain force\r\nof manhood, this sturdy grapple with every question that comes before\r\nhis understanding for settlement, leads him contemptuously to reject all\r\nthe meretricious aids and ornaments of mere rhetoric, and is prominent,\r\namong the many exceptional qualities of his large nature, which have\r\ngiven him a high position among the prose-writers of his country as a\r\nconsummate master of English style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT ORATIONS AND SPEECHES\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE CASE.\r\n\r\nARGUMENT BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, AT WASHINGTON,\r\nON THE 10TH OF MARCH, 1818.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The action, The Trustees of Dartmouth College v. William H. Woodward,\r\nwas commenced in the Court of Common Pleas, Grafton County, State of New\r\nHampshire, February term, 1817. The declaration was trover for the books\r\nof record, original charter, common seal, and other corporate property\r\nof the College. The conversion was alleged to have been made on the 7th\r\nday of October, 1816. The proper pleas were filed, and by consent the\r\ncause was carried directly to the Superior Court of New Hampshire, by\r\nappeal, and entered at the May term, 1817. The general issue was pleaded\r\nby the defendant, and joined by the plaintiffs. The facts in the case\r\nwere then agreed upon by the parties, and drawn up in the form of a\r\nspecial verdict, reciting the charter of the College and the acts of the\r\nlegislature of the State, passed June and December, 1816, by which the\r\nsaid corporation of Dartmouth College was _enlarged_ and _improved_, and\r\nthe said charter _amended_.\r\n\r\nThe question made in the case was, whether those acts of the legislature\r\nwere valid and binding upon the corporation, without their acceptance or\r\nassent, and not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. If\r\nso, the verdict found for the defendants; otherwise, it found for the\r\nplaintiffs.\r\n\r\nThe cause was continued to the September term of the court in Rockingham\r\nCounty, where it was argued; and at the November term of the same year,\r\nin Grafton County, the opinion of the court was delivered by Chief\r\nJustice Richardson, in favor of the validity and constitutionality of\r\nthe acts of the legislature; and judgment was accordingly entered for\r\nthe defendant on the special verdict.\r\n\r\nThereupon a writ of error was sued out by the original plaintiffs, to\r\nremove the cause to the Supreme Court of the United States; where it was\r\nentered at the term of the court holden at Washington on the first\r\nMonday of February, 1818.\r\n\r\nThe cause came on for argument on the 10th day of March, 1818, before\r\nall the judges. It was argued by Mr. Webster and Mr. Hopkinson for the\r\nplaintiffs in error, and by Mr. Holmes and the Attorney-General (Wirt)\r\nfor the defendant in error.\r\n\r\nAt the term of the court holden in February, 1819, the opinion of the\r\njudges was delivered by Chief Justice Marshall, declaring the acts of\r\nthe legislature unconstitutional and invalid, and reversing the judgment\r\nof the State Court. The court, with the exception of Mr. Justice Duvall,\r\nwere unanimous.\r\n\r\nThe following was the argument of Mr. Webster for the plaintiffs in\r\nerror.]\r\n\r\nThe general question is, whether the acts of the legislature of New\r\nHampshire of the 27th of June, and of the 18th and 26th of December,\r\n1816, are valid and binding on the plaintiffs, _without their acceptance\r\nor assent_.\r\n\r\nThe charter of 1769 created and established a corporation, to consist of\r\ntwelve persons, and no more; to be called the \"Trustees of Dartmouth\r\nCollege.\" The preamble to the charter recites, that it is granted on the\r\napplication and request of the Rev. Eleazer Wheelock: That Dr. Wheelock,\r\nabout the year 1754, established a charity school, at his own expense,\r\nand on his own estate and plantation: That for several years, through\r\nthe assistance of well-disposed persons in America, granted at his\r\nsolicitation, he had clothed, maintained, and educated a number of\r\nnative Indians, and employed them afterwards as missionaries and\r\nschoolmasters among the savage tribes: That, his design promising to be\r\nuseful, he had constituted the Rev. Mr. Whitaker to be his attorney,\r\nwith power to solicit contributions, in England, for the further\r\nextension and carrying on of his undertaking; and that he had requested\r\nthe Earl of Dartmouth, Baron Smith, Mr. Thornton, and other gentlemen,\r\nto receive such sums as might be contributed, in England, towards\r\nsupporting his school, and to be trustees thereof, for his charity;\r\nwhich these persons had agreed to do: That thereupon Dr. Wheelock had\r\nexecuted to them a deed of trust, in pursuance of such agreement between\r\nhim and them, and, for divers good reasons, had referred it to these\r\npersons to determine the place in which the school should be finally\r\nestablished: And, to enable them to form a proper decision on this\r\nsubject, had laid before them the several offers which had been made to\r\nhim by the several governments in America, in order to induce him to\r\nsettle and establish his school within the limits of such governments\r\nfor their own emolument, and the increase of learning in their\r\nrespective places, as well as for the furtherance of his general\r\noriginal design: And inasmuch as a number of the proprietors of lands in\r\nNew Hampshire, animated by the example of the Governor himself and\r\nothers, and in consideration that, without any impediment to its\r\noriginal design, the school might be enlarged and improved, to promote\r\nlearning among the English, and to supply ministers to the people of\r\nthat Province, had promised large tracts of land, provided the school\r\nshould be established in that Province, the persons before mentioned,\r\nhaving weighed the reasons in favor of the several places proposed, had\r\ngiven the preference to this Province, and these offers: That Dr.\r\nWheelock therefore represented the necessity of a legal incorporation,\r\nand proposed that certain gentlemen in America, whom he had already\r\nnamed and appointed in his will to be trustees of his charity after his\r\ndecease, should compose the corporation. Upon this recital, and in\r\nconsideration of the laudable original design of Dr. Wheelock, and\r\nwilling that the best means of education be established in New\r\nHampshire, for the benefit of the Province, the king granted the\r\ncharter, by the advice of his Provincial Council.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the facts thus recited is, that Dr. Wheelock had\r\nfounded a charity, on funds owned and procured by himself; that he was\r\nat that time the sole dispenser and sole administrator, as well as the\r\nlegal owner, of these funds; that he had made his will, devising this\r\nproperty in trust, to continue the existence and uses of the school, and\r\nappointed trustees; that, in this state of things, he had been invited\r\nto fix his school permanently in New Hampshire, and to extend the design\r\nof it to the education of the youth of that Province; that before he\r\nremoved his school, or accepted this invitation, which his friends in\r\nEngland had advised him to accept, he applied for a charter, to be\r\ngranted, not to whomsoever the king or government of the Province should\r\nplease, but to such persons as he named and appointed, namely, the\r\npersons whom he had already appointed to be the future trustees of his\r\ncharity by his will.\r\n\r\nThe charter, or letters patent, then proceed to create such a\r\ncorporation, and to appoint twelve persons to constitute it, by the name\r\nof the \"Trustees of Dartmouth College\"; to have perpetual existence as\r\nsuch corporation, and with power to hold and dispose of lands and goods,\r\nfor the use of the college, with all the ordinary powers of\r\ncorporations. They are in their discretion to apply the funds and\r\nproperty of the college to the support of the president, tutors,\r\nministers, and other officers of the college, and such missionaries and\r\nschoolmasters as they may see fit to employ among the Indians. There are\r\nto be twelve trustees for ever, _and no more_; and they are to have the\r\nright of filling vacancies occurring in their own body. The Rev. Mr.\r\nWheelock is declared to be the founder of the college, and is, by the\r\ncharter, appointed first president, with power to appoint a successor by\r\nhis last will. All proper powers of government, superintendence, and\r\nvisitation are vested in the trustees. They are to appoint and remove\r\nall officers at their discretion; to fix their salaries, and assign\r\ntheir duties; and to make all ordinances, orders, and laws for the\r\ngovernment of the students. To the end that the persons who had acted as\r\ndepositaries of the contributions in England, and who had also been\r\ncontributors themselves, might be satisfied of the good use of their\r\ncontributions, the president was annually, or when required, to transmit\r\nto them an account of the progress of the institution and the\r\ndisbursements of its funds, so long as they should continue to act in\r\nthat trust. These letters patent are to be good and effectual, in law,\r\n_against the king, his heirs and successors for ever_, without further\r\ngrant or confirmation; and the trustees are to hold all and singular\r\nthese privileges, advantages, liberties, and immunities to them and to\r\ntheir successors for ever.\r\n\r\nNo funds are given to the college by this charter. A corporate existence\r\nand capacity are given to the trustees, with the privileges and\r\nimmunities which have been mentioned, to enable the founder and his\r\nassociates the better to manage the funds which they themselves had\r\ncontributed, and such others as they might afterwards obtain.\r\n\r\nAfter the institution thus created and constituted had existed,\r\nuninterruptedly and usefully, nearly fifty years, the legislature of New\r\nHampshire passed the acts in question.\r\n\r\nThe first act makes the twelve trustees under the charter, and nine\r\nother individuals, to be appointed by the Governor and Council, a\r\ncorporation, by a new name; and to this new corporation transfers all\r\nthe _property, rights, powers, liberties, and privileges_ of the old\r\ncorporation; with further power to establish new colleges and an\r\ninstitute, and to apply all or any part of the funds to these purposes;\r\nsubject to the power and control of a board of twenty-five overseers, to\r\nbe appointed by the Governor and Council.\r\n\r\nThe second act makes further provisions for executing the objects of the\r\nfirst, and the last act authorizes the defendant, the treasurer of the\r\nplaintiffs, to retain and hold their property, against their will.\r\n\r\nIf these acts are valid, the old corporation is abolished, and a new one\r\ncreated. The first act does, in fact, if it can have any effect, create\r\na new corporation, and transfer to it all the property and franchises of\r\nthe old. The two corporations are not the same in anything which\r\nessentially belongs to the existence of a corporation. They have\r\ndifferent names, and different powers, rights, and duties. Their\r\norganization is wholly different. The powers of the corporation are not\r\nvested in the same, or similar hands. In one, the trustees are twelve,\r\nand no more. In the other, they are twenty-one. In one, the power is in\r\na single board. In the other, it is divided between two boards. Although\r\nthe act professes to include the old trustees in the new corporation,\r\nyet that was without their assent, and against their remonstrance; and\r\nno person can be compelled to be a member of such a corporation against\r\nhis will. It was neither expected nor intended that they should be\r\nmembers of the new corporation. The act itself treats the old\r\ncorporation as at an end, and, going on the ground that all its\r\nfunctions have ceased, it provides for the first meeting and\r\norganization of the new corporation. It expressly provides, also, that\r\nthe new corporation shall have and hold all the property of the old; a\r\nprovision which would be quite unnecessary upon any other ground, than\r\nthat the old corporation was dissolved. But if it could be contended\r\nthat the effect of these acts was not entirely to abolish the old\r\ncorporation, yet it is manifest that they impair and invade the rights,\r\nproperty, and powers of the trustees under the charter, as a\r\ncorporation, and the legal rights, privileges, and immunities which\r\nbelong to them, as individual members of the corporation.\r\n\r\nThe twelve trustees were the _sole_ legal owners of all the property\r\nacquired under the charter. By the acts, others are admitted, against\r\n_their_ will, to be joint owners. The twelve individuals who are\r\ntrustees were possessed of all the franchises and immunities conferred\r\nby the charter. By the acts, _nine_ other trustees and _twenty-five_\r\noverseers are admitted, against their will, to divide these franchises\r\nand immunities with them.\r\n\r\nIf, either as a corporation or as individuals, they have any legal\r\nrights, this forcible intrusion of others violates those rights, as\r\nmanifestly as an entire and complete ouster and dispossession. These\r\nacts alter the whole constitution of the corporation. They affect the\r\nrights of the whole body as a corporation, and the rights of the\r\nindividuals who compose it. They revoke corporate powers and franchises.\r\nThey alienate and transfer the property of the college to others. By the\r\ncharter, the trustees had a right to fill vacancies in their own number.\r\nThis is now taken away. They were to consist of twelve, and, by express\r\nprovision, of no more. This is altered. They and their successors,\r\nappointed by themselves, were for ever to hold the property. The\r\nlegislature has found successors for them, before their seats are\r\nvacant. The powers and privileges which the twelve were to exercise\r\nexclusively, are now to be exercised by others. By one of the acts, they\r\nare subjected to heavy penalties if they exercise their offices, or any\r\nof those powers and privileges granted them by charter, and which they\r\nhad exercised for fifty years. They are to be punished for not accepting\r\nthe new grant and taking its benefits. This, it must be confessed, is\r\nrather a summary mode of settling a question of constitutional right.\r\nNot only are new trustees forced into the corporation, but new trusts\r\nand uses are created. The college is turned into a university. Power is\r\ngiven to create new colleges, and, to authorize any diversion of the\r\nfunds which may be agreeable to the new boards, sufficient latitude is\r\ngiven by the undefined power of establishing an institute. To these new\r\ncolleges, and this institute, the funds contributed by the founder, Dr.\r\nWheelock, and by the original donors, the Earl of Dartmouth and others,\r\nare to be applied, in plain and manifest disregard of the uses to which\r\nthey were given.\r\n\r\nThe president, one of the old trustees, had a right to his office,\r\nsalary, and emoluments, subject to the twelve trustees alone. His title\r\nto these is now changed, and he is made accountable to new masters. So\r\nalso all the professors and tutors. If the legislature can at pleasure\r\nmake these alterations and changes in the rights and privileges of the\r\nplaintiffs, it may, with equal propriety, abolish these rights and\r\nprivileges altogether. The same power which can do any part of this work\r\ncan accomplish the whole. And, indeed, the argument on which these acts\r\nhave been hitherto defended goes altogether on the ground, that this is\r\nsuch a corporation as the legislature may abolish at pleasure; and that\r\nits members have no _rights, liberties, franchises, property, or\r\nprivileges_, which the legislature may not revoke, annul, alienate, or\r\ntransfer to others, whenever it sees fit.\r\n\r\nIt will be contended by the plaintiffs, that these acts are not valid\r\nand binding on them without their assent,--\r\n\r\n1. Because they are against common right, and the Constitution of New\r\nHampshire.\r\n\r\n2. Because they are repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nI am aware of the limits which bound the jurisdiction of the court in\r\nthis case, and that on this record nothing can be decided but the single\r\nquestion, whether these acts are repugnant to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. Yet it may assist in forming an opinion of their true\r\nnature and character to compare them with those fundamental principles\r\nintroduced into the State governments for the purpose of limiting the\r\nexercise of the legislative power, and which the Constitution of New\r\nHampshire expresses with great fulness and accuracy.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to assert, that the legislature of New Hampshire\r\nwould not have been competent to pass the acts in question, and to make\r\nthem binding on the plaintiffs without their assent, even if there had\r\nbeen, in the Constitution of New Hampshire, or of the United States, no\r\nspecial restriction on their power, because these acts are not the\r\nexercise of a power properly legislative.[1] Their effect and object are\r\nto take away, from one, rights, property, and franchises, and to grant\r\nthem to another. This is not the exercise of a legislative power. To\r\njustify the taking away of vested rights there must be a forfeiture, to\r\nadjudge upon and declare which is the proper province of the judiciary.\r\nAttainder and confiscation are acts of sovereign power, not acts of\r\nlegislation. The British Parliament, among other unlimited powers,\r\nclaims that of altering and vacating charters; not as an act of ordinary\r\nlegislation, but of uncontrolled authority. It is theoretically\r\nomnipotent. Yet, in modern times, it has very rarely attempted the\r\nexercise of this power. In a celebrated instance, those who asserted\r\nthis power in Parliament vindicated its exercise only in a case in which\r\nit could be shown, 1st. That the charter in question was a charter of\r\npolitical power; 2d. That there was a great and overruling state\r\nnecessity, justifying the violation of the charter; 3d. That the charter\r\nhad been abused and justly forfeited.[2] The bill affecting this charter\r\ndid not pass. Its history is well known. The act which afterwards did\r\npass, passed _with the assent of the corporation_. Even in the worst\r\ntimes, this power of Parliament to repeal and rescind charters has not\r\noften been exercised. The illegal proceedings in the reign of Charles\r\nthe Second were under color of law. Judgments of forfeiture were\r\nobtained in the courts. Such was the case of the _quo warranto_ against\r\nthe city of London, and the proceedings by which the charter of\r\nMassachusetts was vacated.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of New Hampshire has no more power over the rights of\r\nthe plaintiffs than existed somewhere, in some department of government,\r\nbefore the Revolution. The British Parliament could not have annulled or\r\nrevoked this grant as an act of ordinary legislation. If it had done it\r\nat all, it could only have been in virtue of that sovereign power,\r\ncalled omnipotent, which does not belong to any legislature in the\r\nUnited States. The legislature of New Hampshire has the same power over\r\nthis charter which belonged to the king who granted it, and no more. By\r\nthe law of England, the power to create corporations is a part of the\r\nroyal prerogative.[3] By the Revolution, this power may be considered as\r\nhaving devolved on the legislature of the State, and it has accordingly\r\nbeen exercised by the legislature. But the king cannot abolish a\r\ncorporation, or new-model it, or alter its powers, without its assent.\r\nThis is the acknowledged and well-known doctrine of the common law.\r\n\"Whatever might have been the notion in former times,\" says Lord\r\nMansfield, \"it is most certain now that the corporations of the\r\nuniversities are lay corporations; and that the crown cannot take away\r\nfrom them any rights that have been formerly subsisting in them under\r\nold charters or prescriptive usage.\"[4] After forfeiture duly found, the\r\nking may re-grant the franchises; but a grant of franchises already\r\ngranted, and of which no forfeiture has been found, is void.\r\n\r\nCorporate franchises can only be forfeited by trial and judgment.[5] In\r\ncase of a new charter or grant to an existing corporation, it may accept\r\nor reject it as it pleases.[6] It may accept such part of the grant as\r\nit chooses, and reject the rest.[7] In the very nature of things, a\r\ncharter cannot be forced upon any body. No one can be compelled to\r\naccept a grant; and without acceptance the grant is necessarily void.[8]\r\nIt cannot be pretended that the legislature, as successor to the king in\r\nthis part of his prerogative, has any power to revoke, vacate, or alter\r\nthis charter. If, therefore, the legislature has not this power by any\r\nspecific grant contained in the Constitution; nor as included in its\r\nordinary legislative powers; nor by reason of its succession to the\r\nprerogatives of the crown in this particular, on what ground would the\r\nauthority to pass these acts rest, even if there were no prohibitory\r\nclauses in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights?\r\n\r\nBut there _are_ prohibitions in the Constitution and Bill of Rights of\r\nNew Hampshire, introduced for the purpose of limiting the legislative\r\npower and protecting the rights and property of the citizens. One\r\nprohibition is, \"that no person shall be deprived of his property,\r\nimmunities, or privileges, put out of the protection of the law, or\r\ndeprived of his life, liberty, or estate, but by judgment of his peers\r\nor the law of the land.\"\r\n\r\nIn the opinion, however, which was given in the court below, it is\r\ndenied that the trustees under the charter had any property, immunity,\r\nliberty, or privilege in this corporation, within the meaning of this\r\nprohibition in the Bill of Rights. It is said that it is a public\r\ncorporation and public property; that the trustees have no greater\r\ninterest in it than any other individuals; that it is not private\r\nproperty, which they can sell or transmit to their heirs, and that\r\ntherefore they have no interest in it; that their office is a public\r\ntrust, like that of the Governor or a judge, and that they have no more\r\nconcern in the property of the college than the Governor in the property\r\nof the State, or than the judges in the fines which they impose on the\r\nculprits at their bar; that it is nothing to them whether their powers\r\nshall be extended or lessened, any more than it is to their honors\r\nwhether their jurisdiction shall be enlarged or diminished. It is\r\nnecessary, therefore, to inquire into the true nature and character of\r\nthe corporation which was created by the charter of 1769.\r\n\r\nThere are divers sorts of corporations; and it may be safely admitted\r\nthat the legislature has more power over some than others.[9] Some\r\ncorporations are for government and political arrangement; such, for\r\nexample, as cities, counties, and towns in New England. These may be\r\nchanged and modified as public convenience may require, due regard being\r\nalways had to the rights of property. Of such corporations, all who live\r\nwithin the limits are of course obliged to be members, and to submit to\r\nthe duties which the law imposes on them as such. Other civil\r\ncorporations are for the advancement of trade and business, such as\r\nbanks, insurance companies, and the like. These are created, not by\r\ngeneral law, but usually by grant. Their constitution is special. It is\r\nsuch as the legislature sees fit to give, and the grantees to accept.\r\n\r\nThe corporation in question is not a civil, although it is a lay\r\ncorporation. It is an eleemosynary corporation. It is a private charity,\r\noriginally founded and endowed by an individual, with a charter obtained\r\nfor it at his request, for the better administration of his charity.\r\n\"The eleemosynary sort of corporations are such as are constituted for\r\nthe perpetual distributions of the free alms or bounty of the founder of\r\nthem, to such persons as he has directed. Of this are all hospitals for\r\nthe maintenance of the poor, sick, and impotent; and all colleges both\r\nin our universities and out of them.\"[10] Eleemosynary corporations are\r\nfor the management of private property, according to the will of the\r\ndonors. They are private corporations. A college is as much a private\r\ncorporation as a hospital; especially a college founded, as this was, by\r\nprivate bounty. A college is a charity. \"The establishment of learning,\"\r\nsays Lord Hardwicke, \"is a charity, and so considered in the statute of\r\nElizabeth. A devise to a college, for their benefit, is a laudable\r\ncharity, and deserves encouragement.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe legal signification of _a charity_ is derived chiefly from the\r\nstatute 43 Eliz. ch. 4. \"Those purposes,\" says Sir William Grant, \"are\r\nconsidered _charitable_ which that statute enumerates.\"[12] Colleges are\r\nenumerated as charities in that statute. The government, in these cases,\r\nlends its aid to perpetuate the beneficent intention of the donor, by\r\ngranting a charter under which his private charity shall continue to be\r\ndispensed after his death. This is done either by incorporating the\r\nobjects of the charity, as, for instance, the scholars in a college or\r\nthe poor in a hospital, or by incorporating those who are to be\r\ngovernors or trustees of the charity.[13] In cases of the first sort,\r\nthe founder is, by the common law, visitor. In early times it became a\r\nmaxim, that he who gave the property might regulate it in future. \"Cujus\r\nest dare, ejus est disponere.\" This right of visitation descended from\r\nthe founder to his heir as a right of property, and precisely as his\r\nother property went to his heir; and in default of heirs it went to the\r\nking, as all other property goes to the king for the want of heirs. The\r\nright of visitation arises from the property. It grows out of the\r\nendowment. The founder may, if he please, part with it at the time when\r\nhe establishes the charity, and may vest it in others. Therefore, if he\r\nchooses that governors, trustees, or overseers should be appointed in\r\nthe charter, he may cause it to be done, and his power of visitation may\r\nbe transferred to them, instead of descending to his heirs. The persons\r\nthus assigned or appointed by the founder will be visitors, with all the\r\npowers of the founder, in exclusion of his heir.[14] The right of\r\nvisitation, then, accrues to them, as a matter of property, by the gift,\r\ntransfer, or appointment of the founder. This is a private right, which\r\nthey can assert in all legal modes, and in which they have the same\r\nprotection of the law as in all other rights. As visitors they may make\r\nrules, ordinances, and statutes, and alter and repeal them, as far as\r\npermitted so to do by the charter.[15] Although the charter proceeds\r\nfrom the crown or the government, it is considered as the will of the\r\ndonor. It is obtained at his request. He imposes it as the rule which is\r\nto prevail in the dispensation of his bounty in all future times. The\r\nking or government which grants the charter is not thereby the founder,\r\nbut he who furnishes the funds. The gift of the revenues is the\r\nfoundation.[16]\r\n\r\nThe leading case on this subject is _Phillips v. Bury_.[17] This was an\r\nejectment brought to recover the rectory-house, &c. of Exeter College in\r\nOxford. The question was whether the plaintiff or defendant was legal\r\nrector. Exeter College was founded by an individual, and incorporated by\r\na charter granted by Queen Elizabeth. The controversy turned upon the\r\npower of the visitor, and, in the discussion of the cause, the nature of\r\ncollege charters and corporations was very fully considered. Lord Holt's\r\njudgment, copied from his own manuscript, is found in 2 Term Reports.\r\n346. The following is an extract:--\r\n\r\n     \"That we may the better apprehend the nature of a visitor, we are\r\n     to consider that there are in law two sorts of corporations\r\n     aggregate; such as are for public government, and such as are for\r\n     private charity. Those that are for the public government of a\r\n     town, city, mystery, or the like, being for public advantage, are\r\n     to be governed according to the laws of the land. If they make any\r\n     particular private laws and constitutions, the validity and justice\r\n     of them is examinable in the king's courts. Of these there are no\r\n     particular private founders, and consequently no particular\r\n     visitor; there are no patrons of these; therefore, if no provision\r\n     be in the charter how the succession shall continue, the law\r\n     supplieth the defect of that constitution, and saith it shall be by\r\n     election; as mayor, aldermen, common council, and the like. But\r\n     _private_ and particular corporations for charity, founded and\r\n     endowed by private persons, are subject to the private government\r\n     of those who erect them; and therefore, if there be no visitor\r\n     appointed by the founder, the law appoints the founder and his\r\n     heirs to be visitors, who are to act and proceed according to the\r\n     particular laws and constitutions assigned them by the founder. It\r\n     is now admitted on all hands that the founder is patron, and, as\r\n     founder, is visitor, if no particular visitor be assigned; so that\r\n     patronage and visitation are necessary consequents one upon\r\n     another. For this visitatorial power was not introduced by any\r\n     canons or constitutions ecclesiastical (as was said by a learned\r\n     gentleman whom I have in my eye, in his argument of this case); it\r\n     is an appointment of law. It ariseth from the property which the\r\n     founder had in the lands assigned to support the charity; and as he\r\n     is the author of the charity, the law gives him and his heirs a\r\n     visitatorial power, that is, an authority to inspect the actions\r\n     and regulate the behavior of the members that partake of the\r\n     charity. For it is fit the members that are endowed, and that have\r\n     the charity bestowed upon them, should not be left to themselves,\r\n     but pursue the intent and design of him that bestowed it upon them.\r\n     _Now, indeed, where the poor, or those that receive the charity,\r\n     are not incorporated, but there are certain trustees who dispose of\r\n     the charity, there is no visitor, because the interest of the\r\n     revenue is not vested in the poor that have the benefit of the\r\n     charity, but they are subject to the orders and directions of the\r\n     trustees._ But where they who are to enjoy the benefit of the\r\n     charity are incorporated, there to prevent all perverting of the\r\n     charity, or to compose differences that may happen among them,\r\n     there is by law a visitatorial power; and it being a creature of\r\n     the founder's own, it is reason that he and his heirs should have\r\n     that power, unless by the founder it is vested in some other. Now\r\n     there is no manner of difference between a college and a hospital,\r\n     except only in degree. A hospital is for those that are poor, and\r\n     mean, and low, and sickly; a college is for another sort of\r\n     indigent persons; but it hath another intent, to study in and breed\r\n     up persons in the world that have no otherwise to live; but still\r\n     it is as much within the reasons as hospitals. And if in a hospital\r\n     the master and poor are incorporated, it is a college having a\r\n     common seal to act by, although it hath not the name of a college\r\n     (which always supposeth a corporation), because it is of an\r\n     inferior degree; and in the one case and in the other there must be\r\n     a visitor, either the founder and his heirs or one appointed by\r\n     him; and both are eleemosynary.\"\r\n\r\nLord Holt concludes his whole argument by again repeating, that that\r\ncollege was a _private corporation_, and that the founder had a right to\r\nappoint a visitor, and to give him such power as he saw fit.[18]\r\n\r\nThe learned Bishop Stillingfleet's argument in the same cause, as a\r\nmember of the House of Lords, when it was there heard, exhibits very\r\nclearly the nature of colleges and similar corporations. It is to the\r\nfollowing effect: \"That this absolute and conclusive power of visitors\r\nis no more than the law hath appointed in other cases, upon commissions\r\nof charitable uses: that the common law, and not any ecclesiastical\r\ncanons, do place the power of visitation in the founder and his heirs,\r\n_unless he settle it upon others_: that although corporations for public\r\ngovernment be subject to the courts of Westminster Hall, which have no\r\nparticular or special visitors, yet corporations for charity, founded\r\nand endowed by private persons, are subject to the rule and government\r\nof those that erect them; but where the persons to whom the charity is\r\ngiven are not incorporated, there is no such visitatorial power, because\r\nthe interest of the revenue is not invested in them; but where they are,\r\nthe right of visitation ariseth from the foundation, and the founder may\r\nconvey _it to whom and in what manner he pleases; and the visitor acts\r\nas founder, and by the same authority which he had, and consequently is\r\nno more accountable than he had been_: that the king by his charter can\r\nmake a society to be incorporated so as to have the rights belonging to\r\npersons, as to legal capacities: that colleges, although founded by\r\nprivate persons, are yet incorporated by the king's charter; but\r\nalthough the kings by their charter made the colleges to be such in law,\r\nthat is, to be legal corporations, yet they left to the particular\r\nfounders authority to appoint what statutes they thought fit for the\r\nregulation of them. And not only the statutes, but the appointment of\r\nvisitors, was left to them, and the manner of government, and the\r\nseveral conditions on which any persons were to be made or continue\r\npartakers of their bounty.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThese opinions received the sanction of the House of Lords, and they\r\nseem to be settled and undoubted law. Where there is a charter, vesting\r\nproper powers in trustees, or governors, they are visitors; and there is\r\nno control in any body else; except only that the courts of equity or of\r\nlaw will interfere so far as to preserve the revenues and prevent the\r\nperversion of the funds, and to keep the visitors within their\r\nprescribed bounds. \"If there be a charter with proper powers, the\r\ncharity must be regulated in the manner prescribed by the charter. There\r\nis no ground for the controlling interposition of the courts of\r\nchancery. The interposition of the courts, therefore, in those instances\r\nin which the charities were founded on charters or by act of Parliament,\r\nand a visitor or governor and trustees appointed, must be referred to\r\nthe general jurisdiction of the courts in all cases in which a trust\r\nconferred appears to have been abused, and not to an original right to\r\ndirect the management of the charity, or the conduct of the governors or\r\ntrustees.\"[20] \"The original of all _visitatorial_ power is the property\r\nof the donor, and the power every one has to dispose, direct, and\r\nregulate his own property; like the case of patronage; _cujus est dare_,\r\n&c. Therefore, if either the crown or the subject creates an\r\neleemosynary foundation, and vests the charity in the persons who are to\r\nreceive the benefit of it, since a contest might arise about the\r\ngovernment of it, the law allows the founder or his heirs, or the person\r\nspecially appointed by him to be visitor, to determine concerning his\r\nown creature. If the charity is not vested in the persons who are to\r\npartake, but in trustees for their benefit, no visitor can arise by\r\nimplication, but the trustees have that power.\"[21]\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing better established,\" says Lord Commissioner Eyre,\r\n\"than that this court does not entertain a general jurisdiction, or\r\nregulate and control charities _established by charter_. There the\r\nestablishment is fixed and determined; and the court has no power to\r\nvary it. If the governors established for the regulation of it are not\r\nthose who have the management of the revenue, this court has no\r\njurisdiction, and if it is ever so much abused, as far as it respects\r\nthe jurisdiction of this court it is without remedy; but if those\r\nestablished as governors have also the management of the revenues, this\r\ncourt does assume a jurisdiction of necessity, so far as they are to be\r\nconsidered as trustees of the revenue.\"[22]\r\n\r\n\"The foundations of colleges,\" says Lord Mansfield, \"are to be\r\nconsidered in two views; namely, as they are _corporations_ and as they\r\nare _eleemosynary_. As eleemosynary, they are the creatures of the\r\nfounder; he may delegate his power, either generally or specially; he\r\nmay prescribe particular modes and manners, as to the exercise of part\r\nof it. If he makes a general visitor (as by the general words _visitator\r\nsit_), the person so constituted has all incidental power; but he may be\r\nrestrained as to particular instances. The founder may appoint a special\r\nvisitor for a particular purpose, and no further. The founder may make a\r\ngeneral visitor; and yet appoint an inferior particular power, to be\r\nexecuted without going to the visitor in the first instance.\"[23] And\r\neven if the king be founder, if he grant a charter, incorporating\r\ntrustees and governors, _they are visitors_, and the king cannot\r\nvisit.[24] A subsequent donation, or ingrafted fellowship, falls under\r\nthe same general visitatorial power, if not otherwise specially\r\nprovided.[25]\r\n\r\nIn New England, and perhaps throughout the United States, eleemosynary\r\ncorporations have been generally established in the latter mode; that\r\nis, by incorporating governors, or trustees, and vesting in them the\r\nright of visitation. Small variations may have been in some instances\r\nadopted; as in the case of Harvard College, where some power of\r\ninspection is given to the overseers, but not, strictly speaking, a\r\nvisitatorial power, which still belongs, it is apprehended, to the\r\nfellows or members of the corporation. In general, there are many\r\ndonors. A charter is obtained, comprising them all, or some of them, and\r\nsuch others as they choose to include, with the right of appointing\r\nsuccessors. They are thus the visitors of their own charity, and appoint\r\nothers, such as they may see fit, to exercise the same office in time to\r\ncome. All such corporations are private. The case before the court is\r\nclearly that of an eleemosynary corporation. It is, in the strictest\r\nlegal sense, a private charity. In King v. St. Catherine's Hall,[26]\r\nthat college is called a private eleemosynary lay corporation. It was\r\nendowed by a private founder, and incorporated by letters patent. And in\r\nthe same manner was Dartmouth College founded and incorporated. Dr.\r\nWheelock is declared by the charter to be its founder. It was\r\nestablished by him, on funds contributed and collected by himself.\r\n\r\nAs such founder, he had a right of visitation, which he assigned to the\r\ntrustees, and they received it by his consent and appointment, and held\r\nit under the charter.[27] He appointed these trustees visitors, and in\r\nthat respect to take place of his heir; as he might have appointed\r\ndevisees, to take his estate instead of his heir. Little, probably, did\r\nhe think, at that time, that the legislature would ever take away this\r\nproperty and these privileges, and give them to others. Little did he\r\nsuppose that this charter secured to him and his successors no legal\r\nrights. Little did the other donors think so. If they had, the college\r\nwould have been, what the university is now, a thing upon paper,\r\nexisting only in name.\r\n\r\nThe numerous academies in New England have been established\r\nsubstantially in the same manner. They hold their property by the same\r\ntenure, and no other. Nor has Harvard College any surer title than\r\nDartmouth College. It may to-day have more friends; but to-morrow it may\r\nhave more enemies. Its legal rights are the same. So also of Yale\r\nCollege; and, indeed, of all the others. When the legislature gives to\r\nthese institutions, it may and does accompany its grants with such\r\nconditions as it pleases. The grant of lands by the legislature of New\r\nHampshire to Dartmouth College, in 1789, was accompanied with various\r\nconditions. When donations are made, by the legislature or others, to a\r\ncharity already existing, without any condition, or the specification of\r\nany new use, the donation follows the nature of the charity. Hence the\r\ndoctrine, that all eleemosynary corporations are private bodies. They\r\nare founded by private persons, and on private property. The public\r\ncannot be charitable in these institutions. It is not the money of the\r\npublic, but of private persons, which is dispensed. It may be public,\r\nthat is general, in its uses and advantages; and the State may very\r\nlaudably add contributions of its own to the funds; but it is still\r\nprivate in the tenure of the property, and in the right of administering\r\nthe funds.\r\n\r\nIf the doctrine laid down by Lord Holt, and the House of Lords, in\r\n_Phillips v. Bury_, and recognized and established in all the other\r\ncases, be correct, the property of this college was private property; it\r\nwas vested in the trustees by the charter, and to be administered by\r\nthem, according to the will of the founder and donors, as expressed in\r\nthe charter. They were also visitors of the charity, in the most ample\r\nsense. They had, therefore, as they contend, privileges, property, and\r\nimmunities, within the true meaning of the Bill of Rights. They had\r\nrights, and still have them, which they can assert against the\r\nlegislature, as well as against other wrong-doers. It makes no\r\ndifference, that the estate is holden for certain trusts. The legal\r\nestate is still theirs. They have a right in the property, and they\r\nhave a right of visiting and superintending the trust; and this is an\r\nobject of legal protection, as much as any other right. The charter\r\ndeclares that the powers conferred on the trustees are \"privileges,\r\nadvantages, liberties, and immunities\"; and that they shall be for ever\r\nholden by them and their successors. The New Hampshire Bill of Rights\r\ndeclares that no one shall be deprived of his \"property, privileges, or\r\nimmunities,\" but by judgment of his peers, or the law of the land. The\r\nargument on the other side is, that, although these terms may mean\r\nsomething in the Bill of Rights, they mean nothing in this charter. But\r\nthey are terms of legal signification, and very properly used in the\r\ncharter. They are equivalent with _franchises_. Blackstone says that\r\n_franchise_ and _liberty_ are used as synonymous terms. And after\r\nenumerating other liberties and franchises, he says: \"It is likewise a\r\nfranchise for a number of persons to be incorporated and subsist as a\r\nbody politic, with a power to maintain perpetual succession and do other\r\ncorporate acts; and each individual member of such a corporation is also\r\nsaid to have a franchise or freedom.\"[28]\r\n\r\n_Liberties_ is the term used in Magna Charta as including franchises,\r\nprivileges, immunities, and all the rights which belong to that class.\r\nProfessor Sullivan says, the term signifies the \"_privileges_ that some\r\nof the subjects, whether single persons or bodies corporate, have above\r\nothers by the lawful grant of the king; as the chattels of felons or\r\noutlaws, and the lands _and privileges of corporations_.\"[29]\r\n\r\nThe privilege, then, of being a member of a corporation, under a lawful\r\ngrant, and of exercising the rights and powers of such member, is such a\r\nprivilege, _liberty_, or _franchise_, as has been the object of legal\r\nprotection, and the subject of a legal interest, from the time of Magna\r\nCharta to the present moment. The plaintiffs have such an interest in\r\nthis corporation, individually, as they could assert and maintain in a\r\ncourt of law, not as agents of the public, but in their own right. Each\r\ntrustee has a _franchise_, and if he be disturbed in the enjoyment of\r\nit, he would have redress, on appealing to the law, as promptly as for\r\nany other injury. If the other trustees should conspire against any one\r\nof them to prevent his equal right and voice in the appointment of a\r\npresident or professor, or in the passing of any statute or ordinance of\r\nthe college, he would be entitled to his action, for depriving him of\r\nhis franchise. It makes no difference, that this property is to be\r\nholden and administered, and these franchises exercised, for the purpose\r\nof diffusing learning. No principle and no case establishes any such\r\ndistinction. The public may be benefited by the use of this property.\r\nBut this does not change the nature of the property, or the rights of\r\nthe owners. The object of the charter may be public good; so it is in\r\nall other corporations; and this would as well justify the resumption or\r\nviolation of the grant in any other case as in this. In the case of an\r\nadvowson, the use is public, and the right cannot be turned to any\r\nprivate benefit or emolument. It is nevertheless a legal private right,\r\nand the _property_ of the owner, as emphatically as his freehold. The\r\nrights and privileges of trustees, visitors, or governors of\r\nincorporated colleges, stand on the same foundation. They are so\r\nconsidered, both by Lord Holt and Lord Hardwicke.[30]\r\n\r\nTo contend that the rights of the plaintiffs may be taken away, because\r\nthey derive from them no pecuniary benefit or private emolument, or\r\nbecause they cannot be transmitted to their heirs, or would not be\r\nassets to pay their debts, is taking an extremely narrow view of the\r\nsubject. According to this notion, the case would be different, if, in\r\nthe charter, they had stipulated for a commission on the disbursement\r\nof the funds; and they have ceased to have any interest in the\r\nproperty, because they have undertaken to administer it gratuitously.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be necessary to say much in refutation of the idea, that there\r\ncannot be a legal interest, or ownership, in any thing which does not\r\nyield a pecuniary profit; as if the law regarded no rights but the\r\nrights of money, and of visible, tangible property. Of what nature are\r\nall rights of suffrage? No elector has a particular personal interest;\r\nbut each has a legal right, to be exercised at his own discretion, and\r\nit cannot be taken away from him. The exercise of this right directly\r\nand very materially affects the public; much more so than the exercise\r\nof the privileges of a trustee of this college. Consequences of the\r\nutmost magnitude may sometimes depend on the exercise of the right of\r\nsuffrage by one or a few electors. Nobody was ever yet heard to contend,\r\nhowever, that on that account the public might take away the right, or\r\nimpair it. This notion appears to be borrowed from no better source than\r\nthe repudiated doctrine of the three judges in the Aylesbury case.[31]\r\nThat was an action against a returning officer for refusing the\r\nplaintiff's vote, in the election of a member of Parliament. Three of\r\nthe judges of the King's Bench held, that the action could not be\r\nmaintained, because, among other objections, \"it was not any matter of\r\nprofit, either _in presenti_, or _in futuro_.\" It would not enrich the\r\nplaintiff _in presenti_, nor would it _in futuro_ go to his heirs, or\r\nanswer to pay his debts. But Lord Holt and the House of Lords were of\r\nanother opinion. The judgment of the three judges was reversed, and the\r\ndoctrine they held, having been exploded for a century, seems now for\r\nthe first time to be revived.\r\n\r\nIndividuals have a right to use their own property for purposes of\r\nbenevolence, either towards the public, or towards other individuals.\r\nThey have a right to exercise this benevolence in such lawful manner as\r\nthey may choose; and when the government has induced and excited it, by\r\ncontracting to give perpetuity to the stipulated manner of exercising\r\nit, it is not law, but violence, to rescind this contract, and seize on\r\nthe property. Whether the State will grant these franchises, and under\r\nwhat conditions it will grant them, it decides for itself. But when once\r\ngranted, the constitution holds them to be sacred, till forfeited for\r\njust cause.\r\n\r\nThat all property, of which the use may be beneficial to the public,\r\nbelongs therefore to the public, is quite a new doctrine. It has no\r\nprecedent, and is supported by no known principle. Dr. Wheelock might\r\nhave answered his purposes, in this case, by executing a private deed of\r\ntrust. He might have conveyed his property to trustees, for precisely\r\nsuch uses as are described in this charter. Indeed, it appears that he\r\nhad contemplated the establishing of his school in that manner, and had\r\nmade his will, and devised the property to the same persons who were\r\nafterwards appointed trustees in the charter. Many literary and other\r\ncharitable institutions are founded in that manner, and the trust is\r\nrenewed, and conferred on other persons, from time to time, as occasion\r\nmay require. In such a case, no lawyer would or could say, that the\r\nlegislature might divest the trustees, constituted by deed or will,\r\nseize upon the property, and give it to other persons, for other\r\npurposes. And does the granting of a charter, which is only done to\r\nperpetuate the trust in a more convenient manner, make any difference?\r\nDoes or can this change the nature of the charity, and turn it into a\r\npublic political corporation? Happily, we are not without authority on\r\nthis point. It has been considered and adjudged. Lord Hardwicke says, in\r\nso many words, \"The charter of the crown cannot make a charity more or\r\nless public, but only more permanent than it would otherwise be.\"[32]\r\n\r\nThe granting of the corporation is but making the trust perpetual, and\r\ndoes not alter the nature of the charity. The very object sought in\r\nobtaining such charter, and in giving property to such a corporation, is\r\nto make and keep it private property, and to clothe it with all the\r\nsecurity and inviolability of private property. The intent is, that\r\nthere shall be a legal private ownership, and that the legal owners\r\nshall maintain and protect the property, for the benefit of those for\r\nwhose use it was designed. Who ever endowed the public? Who ever\r\nappointed a legislature to administer his charity? Or who ever heard,\r\nbefore, that a gift to a college, or a hospital, or an asylum, was, in\r\nreality, nothing but a gift to the State?\r\n\r\nThe State of Vermont is a principal donor to Dartmouth College. The\r\nlands given lie in that State. This appears in the special verdict. Is\r\nVermont to be considered as having intended a gift to the State of New\r\nHampshire in this case, as, it has been said, is to be the reasonable\r\nconstruction of all donations to the college? The legislature of New\r\nHampshire affects to represent the public, and therefore claims a right\r\nto control all property destined to public use. What hinders Vermont\r\nfrom considering herself equally the representative of the public, and\r\nfrom resuming her grants, at her own pleasure? Her right to do so is\r\nless doubtful than the power of New Hampshire to pass the laws in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nIn _University v. Foy_,[33] the Supreme Court of North Carolina\r\npronounced unconstitutional and void a law repealing a grant to the\r\nUniversity of North Carolina, although that university was originally\r\nerected and endowed by a statute of the State. That case was a grant of\r\nlands, and the court decided that it could not be resumed. This is the\r\ngrant of a power and capacity to hold lands. Where is the difference of\r\nthe cases, upon principle?\r\n\r\nIn _Terrett v. Taylor_,[34] this court decided that a legislative grant\r\nor confirmation of lands, for the purposes of moral and religious\r\ninstruction, could no more be rescinded than other grants. The nature of\r\nthe use was not holden to make any difference. A grant to a parish or\r\nchurch, for the purposes which have been mentioned, cannot be\r\ndistinguished, in respect to the title it confers, from a grant to a\r\ncollege for the promotion of piety and learning. To the same purpose may\r\nbe cited the case of _Pawlett v. Clark_. The State of Vermont, by\r\nstatute, in 1794, granted to the respective towns in that State certain\r\nglebe lands lying within those towns for the sole use and support of\r\nreligious worship. In 1799, an act was passed to repeal the act of 1794;\r\nbut this court declared, that the act of 1794, \"so far as it granted the\r\nglebes to the towns, could not afterwards be repealed by the\r\nlegislature, so as to divest the rights of the towns under the\r\ngrant.\"[35]\r\n\r\nIt will be for the other side to show that the nature of the use decides\r\nthe question whether the legislature has power to resume its grants. It\r\nwill be for those who maintain such a doctrine to show the principles\r\nand cases upon which it rests. It will be for them also to fix the\r\nlimits and boundaries of their doctrine, and to show what are and what\r\nare not such uses as to give the legislature this power of resumption\r\nand revocation. And to furnish an answer to the cases cited, it will be\r\nfor them further to show that a grant for the use and support of\r\nreligious worship stands on other ground than a grant for the promotion\r\nof piety and learning.\r\n\r\nI hope enough has been said to show that the trustees possessed vested\r\nliberties, privileges, and immunities, under this charter; and that such\r\nliberties, privileges, and immunities, being once lawfully obtained and\r\nvested, are as inviolable as any vested rights of property whatever.\r\nRights to do certain acts, such, for instance, as the visitation and\r\nsuperintendence of a college and the appointment of its officers, may\r\nsurely be vested rights, to all legal intents, as completely as the\r\nright to possess property. A late learned judge of this court has said,\r\n\"When I say that a _right_ is vested in a citizen, I mean that he has\r\nthe power to do _certain actions_, or to possess _certain things_,\r\naccording to the law of the land.\"[36]\r\n\r\nIf such be the true nature of the plaintiffs' interests under this\r\ncharter, what are the articles in the New Hampshire Bill of Rights which\r\nthese acts infringe?\r\n\r\nThey infringe the second article; which says, that the citizens of the\r\nState have a right to hold and possess property. The plaintiffs had a\r\nlegal property in this charter; and they had acquired property under it.\r\nThe acts deprive them of both. They impair and take away the charter;\r\nand they appropriate the property to new uses, against their consent.\r\nThe plaintiffs cannot now hold the property acquired by themselves, and\r\nwhich this article says they have a right to hold.\r\n\r\nThey infringe the twentieth article. By that article it is declared\r\nthat, in questions of property, there is a right to trial. The\r\nplaintiffs are divested, without trial or judgment.\r\n\r\nThey infringe the twenty-third article. It is therein declared that no\r\nretrospective laws shall be passed. This article bears directly on the\r\ncase. These acts must be deemed to be retrospective, within the settled\r\nconstruction of that term. What a retrospective law is, has been\r\ndecided, on the construction of this very article, in the Circuit Court\r\nfor the First Circuit. The learned judge of that circuit says: \"Every\r\nstatute which takes away or impairs vested rights, acquired under\r\nexisting laws, must be deemed retrospective.\"[37] That all such laws are\r\nretrospective was decided also in the case of _Dash v. Van Kleek_,[38]\r\nwhere a most learned judge quotes this article from the constitution of\r\nNew Hampshire, with manifest approbation, as a plain and clear\r\nexpression of those fundamental and unalterable principles of justice,\r\nwhich must lie at the foundation of every free and just system of laws.\r\nCan any man deny that the plaintiffs had rights, under the charter,\r\nwhich were legally vested, and that by these acts those rights are\r\nimpaired?\r\n\r\n\"It is a principle in the English law,\" says Chief Justice Kent, in the\r\ncase last cited, \"as ancient as the law itself, that a statute, even of\r\nits omnipotent Parliament, is not to have a retrospective effect. 'Nova\r\nconstitutio futuris formam imponere debet, et non praeteritis.'[39] The\r\nmaxim in Bracton was taken from the civil law, for we find in that\r\nsystem the same principle, expressed substantially in the same words,\r\nthat the lawgiver cannot alter his mind to the prejudice of a vested\r\nright. 'Nemo potest mutare concilium suum in alterius injuriam.'[40]\r\nThis maxim of Papinian is general in its terms, but Dr. Taylor[41]\r\napplies it directly as a restriction upon the lawgiver, and a\r\ndeclaration in the Code leaves no doubt as to the sense of the civil\r\nlaw. 'Leges et constitutiones futuris certum est dare formam negotiis,\r\nnon ad facta praeterita revocari, nisi nominatim, et de praeterito\r\ntempore, et adhuc pendentibus negotiis cautum sit.'[42] This passage,\r\naccording to the best interpretation of the civilians, relates not\r\nmerely to future suits, but to future, as contradistinguished from past,\r\ncontracts and vested rights.[43] It is indeed admitted that the prince\r\nmay enact a retrospective law, provided it be done _expressly_; for the\r\nwill of the prince under the despotism of the Roman emperors was\r\nparamount to every obligation. Great latitude was anciently allowed to\r\nlegislative expositions of statutes; for the separation of the judicial\r\nfrom the legislative power was not then distinctly known or prescribed.\r\nThe prince was in the habit of interpreting his own laws for particular\r\noccasions. This was called the 'Interlocutio Principis'; and this,\r\naccording to Huber's definition, was, 'quando principes inter partes\r\nloquuntur et jus dicunt.'[44] No correct civilian, and especially no\r\nproud admirer of the ancient republic (if any such then existed), could\r\nhave reflected on this interference with private rights and pending\r\nsuits without disgust and indignation; and we are rather surprised to\r\nfind that, under the violent and arbitrary genius of the Roman\r\ngovernment, the principle before us should have been acknowledged and\r\nobeyed to the extent in which we find it. The fact shows that it must be\r\nfounded in the clearest justice. Our case is happily very different from\r\nthat of the subjects of Justinian. With us the power of the lawgiver is\r\nlimited and defined; the judicial is regarded as a distinct, independent\r\npower; private rights are better understood and more exalted in public\r\nestimation, as well as secured by provisions dictated by the spirit of\r\nfreedom, and unknown to the civil law. Our constitutions do not admit\r\nthe power assumed by the Roman prince, and the principle we are\r\nconsidering is now to be regarded as sacred.\"\r\n\r\nThese acts infringe also the thirty-seventh article of the constitution\r\nof New Hampshire; which says, that the powers of government shall be\r\nkept separate. By these acts, the legislature assumes to exercise a\r\njudicial power. It declares a forfeiture, and resumes franchises, once\r\ngranted, without trial or hearing.\r\n\r\nIf the constitution be not altogether waste-paper, it has restrained the\r\npower of the legislature in these particulars. If it has any meaning, it\r\nis that the legislature shall pass no act directly and manifestly\r\nimpairing private property and private privileges. It shall not judge by\r\nact. It shall not decide by act. It shall not deprive by act. But it\r\nshall leave all these things to be tried and adjudged by the law of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth article has been referred to before. It declares that no\r\none shall be \"deprived of his property, immunities, or privileges, but\r\nby the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.\" Notwithstanding\r\nthe light in which the learned judges in New Hampshire viewed the rights\r\nof the plaintiffs under the charter, and which has been before adverted\r\nto, it is found to be admitted in their opinion, that those rights are\r\nprivileges within the meaning of this fifteenth article of the Bill of\r\nRights. Having quoted that article, they say: \"That the right to manage\r\nthe affairs of this college is a privilege, within the meaning of this\r\nclause of the Bill of Rights, is not to be doubted.\" In my humble\r\nopinion, this surrenders the point. To resist the effect of this\r\nadmission, however, the learned judges add: \"But how a privilege can be\r\nprotected from the operation of the law of the land by a clause in the\r\nconstitution, declaring that it shall not be taken away but by the law\r\nof the land, is not very easily understood.\" This answer goes on the\r\nground, that the acts in question are laws of the land, within the\r\nmeaning of the constitution. If they be so, the argument drawn from this\r\narticle is fully answered. If they be not so, it being admitted that the\r\nplaintiffs' rights are \"privileges,\" within the meaning of the article,\r\nthe argument is not answered, and the article is infringed by the acts.\r\n\r\nAre, then, these acts of the legislature, which affect only particular\r\npersons and their particular privileges, laws of the land? Let this\r\nquestion be answered by the text of Blackstone. \"And first it (i.e. law)\r\nis a _rule_: not a transient, sudden order from a superior to or\r\nconcerning a particular person; but something permanent, uniform, and\r\nuniversal. Therefore a particular act of the legislature to confiscate\r\nthe goods of Titius, or to attaint him of high treason, does not enter\r\ninto the idea of a municipal law; for the operation of this act is spent\r\nupon Titius only, and has no relation to the community in general; it is\r\nrather a sentence than a law.\"[45] Lord Coke is equally decisive and\r\nemphatic. Citing and commenting on the celebrated twenty-ninth chapter\r\nof Magna Charta, he says: \"No man shall be disseized, &c., unless it be\r\nby the lawful judgment, that is, verdict of equals, or by the law of\r\nthe land, that is (to speak it once for all), by the due course and\r\nprocess of law.\"[46] Have the plaintiffs lost their franchises by \"due\r\ncourse and process of law\"? On the contrary, are not these acts\r\n\"particular acts of the legislature, which have no relation to the\r\ncommunity in general, and which are rather sentences than laws\"?\r\n\r\nBy the law of the land is most clearly intended the general law; a law\r\nwhich hears before it condemns; which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders\r\njudgment only after trial. The meaning is, that every citizen shall hold\r\nhis life, liberty, property, and immunities under the protection of the\r\ngeneral rules which govern society. Every thing which may pass under the\r\nform of an enactment is not therefore to be considered the law of the\r\nland. If this were so, acts of attainder, bills of pains and penalties,\r\nacts of confiscation, acts reversing judgments, and acts directly\r\ntransferring one man's estate to another, legislative judgments,\r\ndecrees, and forfeitures in all possible forms, would be the law of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nSuch a strange construction would render constitutional provisions of\r\nthe highest importance completely inoperative and void. It would tend\r\ndirectly to establish the union of all powers in the legislature. There\r\nwould be no general, permanent law for courts to administer or men to\r\nlive under. The administration of justice would be an empty form, an\r\nidle ceremony. Judges would sit to execute legislative judgments and\r\ndecrees; not to declare the law or to administer the justice of the\r\ncountry. \"Is that the law of the land,\" said Mr. Burke, \"upon which, if\r\na man go to Westminster Hall, and ask counsel by what title or tenure he\r\nholds his privilege or estate _according to the law of the land_, he\r\nshould be told, that the law of the land is not yet known; that no\r\ndecision or decree has been made in his case; that when a decree shall\r\nbe passed, he will then know _what the law of the land is_? Will this be\r\nsaid to be the law of the land, by any lawyer who has a rag of a gown\r\nleft upon his back, or a wig with one tie upon his head?\"\r\n\r\nThat the power of electing and appointing the officers of this college\r\nis not only a right of the trustees as a corporation, generally, and in\r\nthe aggregate, but that each individual trustee has also his own\r\nindividual franchise in such right of election and appointment, is\r\naccording to the language of all the authorities. Lord Holt says: \"It is\r\nagreeable to reason and the rules of law, that a franchise should be\r\nvested in the corporation aggregate, and yet the benefit of it to\r\nredound to the particular members, and to be enjoyed by them in their\r\nprivate capacity. Where the privilege of election is used by particular\r\npersons, _it is a particular right, vested in every particular\r\nman_.\"[47]\r\n\r\nIt is also to be considered, that the president and professors of this\r\ncollege have rights to be affected by these acts. Their interest is\r\nsimilar to that of fellows in the English colleges; because they derive\r\ntheir living, wholly or in part, from the founders' bounty. The\r\npresident is one of the trustees or corporators. The professors are not\r\nnecessarily members of the corporation; but they are appointed by the\r\ntrustees, are removable only by them, and have fixed salaries payable\r\nout of the general funds of the college. Both president and professors\r\nhave freeholds in their offices; subject only to be removed by the\r\ntrustees, as their legal visitors, for good cause. All the authorities\r\nspeak of fellowships in colleges as freeholds, notwithstanding the\r\nfellows may be liable to be suspended or removed, for misbehavior, by\r\ntheir constituted visitors.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been less expected, in this age, than that there\r\nshould have been an attempt, by acts of the legislature, to take away\r\nthese college livings, the inadequate but the only support of literary\r\nmen who have devoted their lives to the instruction of youth. The\r\npresident and professors were appointed by the twelve trustees. They\r\nwere accountable to nobody else, and could be removed by nobody else.\r\nThey accepted their offices on this tenure. Yet the legislature has\r\nappointed other persons, with power to remove these officers and to\r\ndeprive them of their livings; and those other persons have exercised\r\nthat power. No description of private property has been regarded as more\r\nsacred than college livings. They are the estates and freeholds of a\r\nmost deserving class of men; of scholars who have consented to forego\r\nthe advantages of professional and public employments, and to devote\r\nthemselves to science and literature and the instruction of youth in the\r\nquiet retreats of academic life. Whether to dispossess and oust them; to\r\ndeprive them of their office, and to turn them out of their livings; to\r\ndo this, not by the power of their legal visitors or governors, but by\r\nacts of the legislature, and to do it without forfeiture and without\r\nfault; whether all this be not in the highest degree an indefensible and\r\narbitrary proceeding, is a question of which there would seem to be but\r\none side fit for a lawyer or a scholar to espouse.\r\n\r\nOf all the attempts of James the Second to overturn the law, and the\r\nrights of his subjects, none was esteemed more arbitrary or tyrannical\r\nthan his attack on Magdalen College, Oxford; and yet that attempt was\r\nnothing but to put out one president and put in another. The president\r\nof that college, according to the charter and statutes, is to be chosen\r\nby the fellows, who are the corporators. There being a vacancy, the king\r\nchose to take the appointment out of the hands of the fellows, the legal\r\nelectors of a president, into his own hands. He therefore sent down his\r\nmandate, commanding the fellows to admit for president a person of his\r\nnomination; and, inasmuch as this was directly against the charter and\r\nconstitution of the college, he was pleased to add a _non obstante_\r\nclause of sufficiently comprehensive import. The fellows were commanded\r\nto admit the person mentioned in the mandate, \"any statute, custom, or\r\nconstitution to the contrary notwithstanding, wherewith we are\r\ngraciously pleased to dispense, in this behalf.\" The fellows refused\r\nobedience to this mandate, and Dr. Hough, a man of independence and\r\ncharacter, was chosen president by the fellows, according to the charter\r\nand statutes. The king then assumed the power, in virtue of his\r\nprerogative, to send down certain commissioners to turn him out; which\r\nwas done accordingly; and Parker, a creature suited to the times, put in\r\nhis place. Because the president, who was rightfully and legally\r\nelected, _would not deliver the keys, the doors were broken open_. \"The\r\nnation as well as the university,\" says Bishop Burnet,[48] \"looked on\r\nall these proceedings with just indignation. It was thought an open\r\npiece of robbery and burglary when men, authorized by no legal\r\ncommission, came and forcibly turned men out of their possession and\r\nfreehold.\" Mr. Hume, although a man of different temper, and of other\r\nsentiments, in some respects, than Dr. Burnet, speaks of this arbitrary\r\nattempt of prerogative in terms not less decisive. \"The president, and\r\nall the fellows,\" says he, \"except two, who complied, were expelled the\r\ncollege, and Parker was put in possession of the office. This act of\r\nviolence, of all those which were committed during the reign of James,\r\nis perhaps the most illegal and arbitrary. When the dispensing power was\r\nthe most strenuously insisted on by court lawyers, it had still been\r\nallowed that the statutes which regard private property could not\r\nlegally be infringed by that prerogative. Yet, in this instance, it\r\nappeared that even these were not now secure from invasion. The\r\nprivileges of a college are attacked; men are illegally dispossessed of\r\ntheir property for adhering to their duty, to their oaths, and to their\r\nreligion.\"\r\n\r\nThis measure King James lived to repent, after repentance was too late.\r\nWhen the charter of London was restored, and other measures of violence\r\nwere retracted, to avert the impending revolution, the expelled\r\npresident and fellows of Magdalen College were permitted to resume their\r\nrights. It is evident that this was regarded as an arbitrary\r\ninterference with private property. Yet private property was no\r\notherwise attacked than as a person was appointed to administer and\r\nenjoy the revenues of a college in a manner and by persons not\r\nauthorized by the constitution of the college. A majority of the members\r\nof the corporation would not comply with the king's wishes. A minority\r\nwould. The object was therefore to make this minority a majority. To\r\nthis end the king's commissioners were directed to interfere in the\r\ncase, and they united with the two complying fellows, and expelled the\r\nrest; and thus effected a change in the government of the college. The\r\nlanguage in which Mr. Hume and all other writers speak of this abortive\r\nattempt of oppression, shows that colleges were esteemed to be, as they\r\ntruly are, private corporations, and the property and privileges which\r\nbelong to them _private_ property and _private_ privileges. Court\r\nlawyers were found to justify the king in dispensing with the laws; that\r\nis, in assuming and exercising a legislative authority. But no lawyer,\r\nnot even a court lawyer, in the reign of King James the Second, as far\r\nas appears, was found to say that, even by this high authority, he could\r\ninfringe the franchises of the fellows of a college, and take away their\r\nlivings. Mr. Hume gives the reason; it is, that such franchises were\r\nregarded, in a most emphatic sense, as _private property_.[49]\r\n\r\nIf it could be made to appear that the trustees and the president and\r\nprofessors held their offices and franchises during the pleasure of the\r\nlegislature, and that the property holden belonged to the State, then\r\nindeed the legislature have done no more than they had a right to do.\r\nBut this is not so. The charter is a charter of privileges and\r\nimmunities; and these are holden by the trustees expressly against the\r\nState for ever.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that the State, by its courts of law, can enforce the\r\nwill of the donor, and compel a faithful execution of the trust. The\r\nplaintiffs claim no exemption from legal responsibility. They hold\r\nthemselves at all times answerable to the law of the land, for their\r\nconduct in the trust committed to them. They ask only to hold the\r\nproperty of which they are owners, and the franchises which belong to\r\nthem, until they shall be found, by due course and process of law, to\r\nhave forfeited them.\r\n\r\nIt can make no difference whether the legislature exercise the power it\r\nhas assumed by removing the trustees and the president and professors,\r\ndirectly and by name, or by appointing others to expel them. The\r\nprinciple is the same, and in point of fact the result has been the\r\nsame. If the entire franchise cannot be taken away, neither can it be\r\nessentially impaired. If the trustees are legal owners of the property,\r\nthey are sole owners. If they are visitors, they are sole visitors. No\r\none will be found to say, that, if the legislature may do what it has\r\ndone, it may not do any thing and every thing which it may choose to do,\r\nrelative to the property of the corporation, and the privileges of its\r\nmembers and officers.\r\n\r\nIf the view which has been taken of this question be at all correct,\r\nthis was an eleemosynary corporation, a private charity. The property\r\nwas private property. The trustees were visitors, and the right to hold\r\nthe charter, administer the funds, and visit and govern the college, was\r\na franchise and privilege, solemnly granted to them. The use being\r\npublic in no way diminishes their legal estate in the property, or their\r\ntitle to the franchise. There is no principle, nor any case, which\r\ndeclares that a gift to such a corporation is a gift to the public. The\r\nacts in question violate property. They take away privileges,\r\nimmunities, and franchises. They deny to the trustees the protection of\r\nthe law; and they are retrospective in their operation. In all which\r\nrespects they are against the constitution of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs contend, in the second place, that the acts in question\r\nare repugnant to the tenth section of the first article of the\r\nConstitution of the United States. The material words of that section\r\nare: \"No State shall pass any bill of attainder, _ex post facto_ law, or\r\nlaw impairing the obligation of contacts.\"\r\n\r\nThe object of these most important provisions in the national\r\nconstitution has often been discussed, both here and elsewhere. It is\r\nexhibited with great clearness and force by one of the distinguished\r\npersons who framed that instrument. \"Bills of attainder, _ex post facto_\r\nlaws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to\r\nthe first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of\r\nsound legislation. The two former are expressly prohibited by the\r\ndeclarations prefixed to some of the State constitutions, and all of\r\nthem are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental\r\ncharters. Our own experience has taught us, nevertheless, that\r\nadditional fences against these dangers ought not to be omitted. Very\r\nproperly, therefore, have the convention added this constitutional\r\nbulwark, in favor of personal security and private rights; and I am much\r\ndeceived, if they have not, in so doing, as faithfully consulted the\r\ngenuine sentiments as the undoubted interests of their constituents. The\r\nsober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has\r\ndirected the public councils. They have seen with regret, and with\r\nindignation, that sudden changes, and legislative interferences in cases\r\naffecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprising and\r\ninfluential speculators, and snares to the more industrious and less\r\ninformed part of the community. They have seen, too, that one\r\nlegislative interference is but the link of a long chain of repetitions;\r\nevery subsequent interference being naturally produced by the effects of\r\nthe preceding.\"[50]\r\n\r\nIt has already been decided in this court, that a _grant_ is a contract,\r\nwithin the meaning of this provision; and that a grant by a State is\r\nalso a contract, as much as the grant of an individual. In the case of\r\n_Fletcher v. Peck_[51] this court says: \"A contract is a compact between\r\ntwo or more parties, and is either executory or executed. An executory\r\ncontract is one in which a party binds himself to do, or not to do, a\r\nparticular thing; such was the law under which the conveyance was made\r\nby the government. A contract executed is one in which the object of\r\ncontract is performed; and this, says Blackstone, differs in nothing\r\nfrom a grant. The contract between Georgia and the purchasers was\r\nexecuted by the grant. A contract executed, as well as one which is\r\nexecutory, contains obligations binding on the parties. A grant, in its\r\nown nature, amounts to an extinguishment of the right of the grantor,\r\nand implies a contract not to reassert that right. If, under a fair\r\nconstruction of the Constitution, grants are comprehended under the term\r\ncontracts, is a grant from the State excluded from the operation of the\r\nprovision? Is the clause to be considered as inhibiting the State from\r\nimpairing the obligation of contracts between two individuals, but as\r\nexcluding from that inhibition contracts made with itself? The words\r\nthemselves contain no such distinction. They are general, and are\r\napplicable to contracts of every description. If contracts made with the\r\nState are to be exempted from their operation, the exception must arise\r\nfrom the character of the contracting party, not from the words which\r\nare employed. Whatever respect might have been felt for the State\r\nsovereignties, it is not to be disguised that the framers of the\r\nConstitution viewed with some apprehension the violent acts which might\r\ngrow out of the feelings of the moment; and that the people of the\r\nUnited States, in adopting that instrument, have manifested a\r\ndetermination to shield themselves and their property from the effects\r\nof those sudden and strong passions to which men are exposed. The\r\nrestrictions on the legislative power of the States are obviously\r\nfounded in this sentiment; and the Constitution of the United States\r\ncontains what may be deemed a bill of rights for the people of each\r\nState.\"\r\n\r\nIt has also been decided, that a grant by a State before the Revolution\r\nis as much to be protected as a grant since.[52] But the case of\r\n_Terrett v. Taylor_, before cited, is of all others most pertinent to\r\nthe present argument. Indeed, the judgment of the court in that case\r\nseems to leave little to be argued or decided in this. \"A private\r\ncorporation,\" say the court, \"created by the legislature, may lose its\r\nfranchises by a _misuser_ or a _nonuser_ of them; and they may be\r\nresumed by the government under a judicial judgment upon a _quo\r\nwarranto_ to ascertain and enforce the forfeiture. This is the common\r\nlaw of the land, and is a tacit condition annexed to the creation of\r\nevery such corporation. Upon a change of government, too, it may be\r\nadmitted, that such exclusive privileges attached to a private\r\ncorporation as are inconsistent with the new government may be\r\nabolished. In respect, also, to _public_ corporations which exist only\r\nfor public purposes, such as counties, towns, cities, and so forth, the\r\nlegislature may, under proper limitations, have a right to change,\r\nmodify, enlarge, or restrain them, securing, however, the property for\r\nthe uses of those for whom and at whose expense it was originally\r\npurchased. But that the legislature can repeal statutes creating private\r\ncorporations, or confirming to them property already acquired under the\r\nfaith of previous laws, and by such repeal can vest the property of such\r\ncorporations exclusively in the State, or dispose of the same to such\r\npurposes as they please, without the consent or default of the\r\ncorporators, we are not prepared to admit; and we think ourselves\r\nstanding upon the principles of natural justice, upon the fundamental\r\nlaws of every free government, upon the spirit and letter of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, and upon the decisions of most\r\nrespectable judicial tribunals, in resisting such a doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nThis court, then, does not admit the doctrine, that a legislature can\r\nrepeal statutes creating private corporations. If it cannot repeal them\r\naltogether, of course it cannot repeal any part of them, or impair them,\r\nor essentially alter them, without the consent of the corporators. If,\r\ntherefore, it has been shown that this college is to be regarded as a\r\nprivate charity, this case is embraced within the very terms of that\r\ndecision. A grant of corporate powers and privileges is as much a\r\ncontract as a grant of land. What proves all charters of this sort to be\r\ncontracts is, that they must be accepted to give them force and effect.\r\nIf they are not accepted, they are void. And in the case of an existing\r\ncorporation, if a new charter is given it, it may even accept part and\r\nreject the rest. In _Rex v. Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge_,[53] Lord\r\nMansfield says: \"There is a vast deal of difference between a new\r\ncharter granted to a new corporation, (who must take it as it is given,)\r\nand a new charter given to a corporation already in being, and acting\r\neither under a former charter or under prescriptive usage. The latter, a\r\ncorporation already existing, are not obliged to accept the new charter\r\n_in toto_, and to receive either all or none of it; they may act partly\r\nunder it, and partly under their old charter or prescription. The\r\nvalidity of these new charters must turn upon the acceptance of them.\"\r\nIn the same case Mr. Justice Wilmot says: \"It is the concurrence and\r\nacceptance of the university that gives the force to the charter of the\r\ncrown.\" In the _King v. Pasmore_,[54] Lord Kenyon observes: \"Some things\r\nare clear: when a corporation exists capable of discharging its\r\nfunctions, the crown cannot obtrude another charter upon them; they may\r\neither accept or reject it.\"[55]\r\n\r\nIn all cases relative to charters, the acceptance of them is uniformly\r\nalleged in the pleadings. This shows the general understanding of the\r\nlaw, that they are grants or contracts; and that parties are necessary\r\nto give them force and validity. In _King v. Dr. Askew_,[56] it is said:\r\n\"The crown cannot oblige a man to be a corporator, without his consent;\r\nhe shall not be subject to the inconveniences of it, without accepting\r\nit and assenting to it.\" These terms, \"acceptance\" and \"assent,\" are the\r\nvery language of contract. In _Ellis v. Marshall_,[57] it was expressly\r\nadjudged that the naming of the defendant among others, in an act of\r\nincorporation, did not of itself make him a corporator; and that his\r\nassent was necessary to that end. The court speak of the act of\r\nincorporation as a grant, and observe: \"That a man may refuse a grant,\r\nwhether from the government or an individual, seems to be a principle\r\ntoo clear to require the support of authorities.\" But Justice Buller, in\r\n_King v. Pasmore_, furnishes, if possible, a still more direct and\r\nexplicit authority. Speaking of a corporation for government, he says:\r\n\"I do not know how to reason on this point better than in the manner\r\nurged by one of the relator's counsel; who considered the grant of\r\nincorporation to be a compact between the crown and a certain number of\r\nthe subjects, the latter of whom undertake, in consideration of the\r\nprivileges which are bestowed, to exert themselves for the good\r\ngovernment of the place.\" This language applies with peculiar propriety\r\nand force to the case before the court. It was in consequence of the\r\n\"privileges bestowed,\" that Dr. Wheelock and his associates undertook to\r\nexert themselves for the instruction and education of youth in this\r\ncollege; and it was on the same consideration that the founder endowed\r\nit with his property.\r\n\r\nAnd because charters of incorporation are of the nature of contracts,\r\nthey cannot be altered or varied but by consent of the original parties.\r\nIf a charter be granted by the king, it may be altered by a new charter\r\ngranted by the king, and accepted by the corporators. But if the first\r\ncharter be granted by Parliament, the consent of Parliament must be\r\nobtained to any alteration. In _King v. Miller_,[58] Lord Kenyon says:\r\n\"Where a corporation takes its rise from the king's charter, the king by\r\ngranting, and the corporation by accepting another charter, may alter\r\nit, because it is done with the consent of all the parties who are\r\ncompetent to consent to the alteration.\"[59]\r\n\r\nThere are, in this case, all the essential constituent parts of a\r\ncontract. There is something to be contracted about, there are parties,\r\nand there are plain terms in which the agreement of the parties on the\r\nsubject of the contract is expressed. There are mutual considerations\r\nand inducements. The charter recites, that the founder, on his part, has\r\nagreed to establish his seminary in New Hampshire, and to enlarge it\r\nbeyond its original design, among other things, for the benefit of that\r\nProvince; and thereupon a charter is given to him and his associates,\r\ndesignated by himself, promising and assuring to them, under the\r\nplighted faith of the State, the right of governing the college and\r\nadministering its concerns in the manner provided in the charter. There\r\nis a complete and perfect grant to them of all the power of\r\nsuperintendence, visitation, and government. Is not this a contract? If\r\nlands or money had been granted to him and his associates, for the same\r\npurposes, such grant could not be rescinded. And is there any\r\ndifference, in legal contemplation, between a grant of corporate\r\nfranchises and a grant of tangible property? No such difference is\r\nrecognized in any decided case, nor does it exist in the common\r\napprehension of mankind.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore contended, that this case falls within the true meaning\r\nof this provision of the Constitution, as expounded in the decisions of\r\nthis court; that the charter of 1769 is a contract, a stipulation or\r\nagreement, mutual in its considerations, express and formal in its\r\nterms, and of a most binding and solemn nature. That the acts in\r\nquestion impair this contract, has already been sufficiently shown. They\r\nrepeal and abrogate its most essential parts.\r\n\r\nA single observation may not be improper on the opinion of the court of\r\nNew Hampshire, which has been published. The learned judges who\r\ndelivered that opinion have viewed this question in a very different\r\nlight from that in which the plaintiffs have endeavored to exhibit it.\r\nAfter some general remarks, they assume that this college is a public\r\ncorporation; and on this basis their judgment rests. Whether all\r\ncolleges are not regarded as private and eleemosynary corporations, by\r\nall law writers and all judicial decisions; whether this college was not\r\nfounded by Dr. Wheelock; whether the charter was not granted at his\r\nrequest, the better to execute a trust, which he had already created;\r\nwhether he and his associates did not become visitors, by the charter;\r\nand whether Dartmouth College be not, therefore, in the strictest sense,\r\na private charity, are questions which the learned judges do not appear\r\nto have discussed.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted in that opinion, that, if it be a private corporation,\r\nits rights stand on the same ground as those of an individual. The great\r\nquestion, therefore, to be decided is, To which class of corporations do\r\ncolleges thus founded belong? And the plaintiffs have endeavored to\r\nsatisfy the court, that, according to the well-settled principles and\r\nuniform decisions of law, they are private, eleemosynary corporations.\r\n\r\nMuch has heretofore been said on the necessity of admitting such a power\r\nin the legislature as has been assumed in this case. Many cases of\r\npossible evil have been imagined, which might otherwise be without\r\nremedy. Abuses, it is contended, might arise in the management of such\r\ninstitutions, which the ordinary courts of law would be unable to\r\ncorrect. But this is only another instance of that habit of supposing\r\nextreme cases, and then of reasoning from them, which is the constant\r\nrefuge of those who are obliged to defend a cause, which, upon its\r\nmerits, is indefensible. It would be sufficient to say in answer, that\r\nit is not pretended that there was here any such case of necessity. But\r\na still more satisfactory answer is, that the apprehension of danger is\r\ngroundless, and therefore the whole argument fails. Experience has not\r\ntaught us that there is danger of great evils or of great inconvenience\r\nfrom this source. Hitherto, neither in our own country nor elsewhere\r\nhave such cases of necessity occurred. The judicial establishments of\r\nthe State are presumed to be competent to prevent abuses and violations\r\nof trust, in cases of this kind, as well as in all others. If they be\r\nnot, they are imperfect, and their amendment would be a most proper\r\nsubject for legislative wisdom. Under the government and protection of\r\nthe general laws of the land, these institutions have always been found\r\nsafe, as well as useful. They go on, with the progress of society,\r\naccommodating themselves easily, without sudden change or violence, to\r\nthe alterations which take place in its condition, and in the knowledge,\r\nthe habits, and pursuits of men. The English colleges were founded in\r\nCatholic ages. Their religion was reformed with the general reformation\r\nof the nation; and they are suited perfectly well to the purpose of\r\neducating the Protestant youth of modern times. Dartmouth College was\r\nestablished under a charter granted by the Provincial government; but a\r\nbetter constitution for a college, or one more adapted to the condition\r\nof things under the present government, in all material respects, could\r\nnot now be framed. Nothing in it was found to need alteration at the\r\nRevolution. The wise men of that day saw in it one of the best hopes of\r\nfuture times, and commended it as it was, with parental care, to the\r\nprotection and guardianship of the government of the State. A charter of\r\nmore liberal sentiments, of wiser provisions, drawn with more care, or\r\nin a better spirit, could not be expected at any time or from any\r\nsource. The college needed no change in its organization or government.\r\nThat which it did need was the kindness, the patronage, the bounty of\r\nthe legislature; not a mock elevation to the character of a university,\r\nwithout the solid benefit of a shilling's donation to sustain the\r\ncharacter; not the swelling and empty authority of establishing\r\ninstitutes and other colleges. This unsubstantial pageantry would seem\r\nto have been in derision of the scanty endowment and limited means of an\r\nunobtrusive, but useful and growing seminary. Least of all was there a\r\nnecessity, or pretence of necessity, to infringe its legal rights,\r\nviolate its franchises and privileges, and pour upon it these\r\noverwhelming streams of litigation.\r\n\r\nBut this argument from necessity would equally apply in all other cases.\r\nIf it be well founded, it would prove, that, whenever any inconvenience\r\nor evil is experienced from the restrictions imposed on the legislature\r\nby the Constitution, these restrictions ought to be disregarded. It is\r\nenough to say, that the people have thought otherwise. They have, most\r\nwisely, chosen to take the risk of occasional inconvenience from the\r\nwant of power, in order that there might be a settled limit to its\r\nexercise, and a permanent security against its abuse. They have imposed\r\nprohibitions and restraints; and they have not rendered these altogether\r\nvain and nugatory by conferring the power of dispensation. If\r\ninconvenience should arise which the legislature cannot remedy under the\r\npower conferred upon it, it is not answerable for such inconvenience.\r\nThat which it cannot do within the limits prescribed to it, it cannot do\r\nat all. No legislature in this country is able, and may the time never\r\ncome when it shall be able, to apply to itself the memorable expression\r\nof a Roman pontiff: \"Licet hoc _de jure_ non possumus, volumus tamen _de\r\nplenitudine potestatis_.\"\r\n\r\nThe case before the court is not of ordinary importance, nor of\r\nevery-day occurrence. It affects not this college only, but every\r\ncollege, and all the literary institutions of the country. They have\r\nnourished hitherto, and have become in a high degree respectable and\r\nuseful to the community. They have all a common principle of existence,\r\nthe inviolability of their charters. It will be a dangerous, a most\r\ndangerous experiment, to hold these institutions subject to the rise and\r\nfall of popular parties, and the fluctuations of political opinions. If\r\nthe franchise may be at any time taken away, or impaired, the property\r\nalso may be taken away, or its use perverted. Benefactors will have no\r\ncertainty of effecting the object of their bounty; and learned men will\r\nbe deterred from devoting themselves to the service of such\r\ninstitutions, from the precarious title of their offices. Colleges and\r\nhalls will be deserted by all better spirits, and become a theatre for\r\nthe contentions of politics. Party and faction will be cherished in the\r\nplaces consecrated to piety and learning. These consequences are neither\r\nremote nor possible only. They are certain and immediate.\r\n\r\nWhen the court in North Carolina declared the law of the State, which\r\nrepealed a grant to its university, unconstitutional and void, the\r\nlegislature had the candor and the wisdom to repeal the law. This\r\nexample, so honorable to the State which exhibited it, is most fit to be\r\nfollowed on this occasion. And there is good reason to hope that a\r\nState, which has hitherto been so much distinguished for temperate\r\ncounsels, cautious legislation, and regard to law, will not fail to\r\nadopt a course which will accord with her highest and best interests,\r\nand in no small degree elevate her reputation.\r\n\r\nIt was for many and obvious reasons most anxiously desired that the\r\nquestion of the power of the legislature over this charter should have\r\nbeen finally decided in the State court. An earnest hope was\r\nentertained that the judges of the court might have viewed the case in a\r\nlight favorable to the rights of the trustees. That hope has failed. It\r\nis here that those rights are now to be maintained, or they are\r\nprostrated for ever. \"Omnia alia perfugia bonorum, subsidia, consilia,\r\nauxilia, jura ceciderunt.

Russell, Esq., entitled \"Guide to Plymouth and\r\nRecollections of the Pilgrims.\"\r\n\r\nThis club was formed for general purposes of social intercourse, in\r\n1769; but its members determined, by a vote passed on Monday, the 18th\r\nof December, of that year, \"to keep\" Friday, the 22d, in commemoration\r\nof the landing of the fathers. A particular account of the simple\r\nfestivities of this first public celebration of the landing of the\r\nPilgrims will be found at page 220 of Mr. Russell's work.\r\n\r\nThe following year, the anniversary was celebrated much in the same\r\nmanner as in 1769, with the addition of a short address, pronounced\r\n\"with modest and decent firmness, by a member of the club, Edward\r\nWinslow, Jr., Esq.,\" being the first address ever delivered on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIn 1771, it was suggested by Rev. Chandler Robbins, pastor of the First\r\nChurch at Plymouth, in a letter addressed to the club, \"whether it would\r\nnot be agreeable, for the entertainment and instruction of the rising\r\ngeneration on these anniversaries, to have a sermon in public, some part\r\nof the day, peculiarly adapted to the occasion.\" This recommendation\r\nprevailed, and an appropriate discourse was delivered the following year\r\nby the Rev. Dr. Robbins.\r\n\r\nIn 1773 the Old Colony Club was dissolved, in consequence of the\r\nconflicting opinions of its members on the great political questions\r\nthen agitated. Notwithstanding this event, the anniversary celebrations\r\nof the 22d of December continued without interruption till 1780, when\r\nthey were suspended. After an interval of fourteen years, a public\r\ndiscourse was again delivered by the Rev. Dr. Robbins. Private\r\ncelebrations took place the four following years, and from that time\r\ntill the year 1819, with one or two exceptions, the day was annually\r\ncommemorated, and public addresses were delivered by distinguished\r\nclergymen and laymen of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 the \"Pilgrim Society\" was formed by the citizens of Plymouth and\r\nthe descendants of the Pilgrims in other places, desirous of uniting \"to\r\ncommemorate the landing, and to honor the memory of the intrepid men who\r\nfirst set foot on Plymouth rock.\" The foundation of this society gave a\r\nnew impulse to the anniversary celebrations of this great event. The\r\nHon. Daniel Webster was requested to deliver the public address on the\r\n22d of December of that year, and the following discourse was pronounced\r\nby him on the ever-memorable occasion. Great public expectation was\r\nawakened by the fame of the orator; an immense concourse assembled at\r\nPlymouth to unite in the celebration; and it may be safely anticipated,\r\nthat some portion of the powerful effect of the following address on the\r\nminds of those who were so fortunate as to hear it, will be perpetuated\r\nby the press to the latest posterity.\r\n\r\nFrom 1820 to the present day, with occasional interruptions, the 22d of\r\nDecember has been celebrated by the Pilgrim Society. A list of all those\r\nby whom anniversary discourses have been delivered since the first\r\norganization of the Old Colony Club, in 1769, may be found in Mr.\r\nRussell's work.\r\n\r\nNor has the notice of the day been confined to New England. Public\r\ncelebrations of the landing of the Pilgrims have been frequent in other\r\nparts of the country, particularly in New York. The New England Society\r\nof that city has rarely permitted the day to pass without appropriate\r\nhonors. Similar societies have been formed at Philadelphia, Charleston,\r\nS.C., and Cincinnati, and the day has been publicly commemorated in\r\nseveral other parts of the country.]\r\n\r\nLet us rejoice that we behold this day. Let us be thankful that we have\r\nlived to see the bright and happy breaking of the auspicious morn, which\r\ncommences the third century of the history of New England. Auspicious,\r\nindeed,--bringing a happiness beyond the common allotment of Providence\r\nto men,--full of present joy, and gilding with bright beams the prospect\r\nof futurity, is the dawn that awakens us to the commemoration of the\r\nlanding of the Pilgrims.\r\n\r\nLiving at an epoch which naturally marks the progress of the history of\r\nour native land, we have come hither to celebrate the great event with\r\nwhich that history commenced. For ever honored be this, the place of our\r\nfathers' refuge! For ever remembered the day which saw them, weary and\r\ndistressed, broken in every thing but spirit, poor in all but faith and\r\ncourage, at last secure from the dangers of wintry seas, and impressing\r\nthis shore with the first footsteps of civilized man!\r\n\r\nIt is a noble faculty of our nature which enables us to connect our\r\nthoughts, our sympathies, and our happiness with what is distant in\r\nplace or time; and, looking before and after, to hold communion at once\r\nwith our ancestors and our posterity. Human and mortal although we are,\r\nwe are nevertheless not mere insulated beings, without relation to the\r\npast or the future. Neither the point of time, nor the spot of earth, in\r\nwhich we physically live, bounds our rational and intellectual\r\nenjoyments. We live in the past by a knowledge of its history; and in\r\nthe future, by hope and anticipation. By ascending to an association\r\nwith our ancestors; by contemplating their example and studying their\r\ncharacter; by partaking their sentiments, and imbibing their spirit; by\r\naccompanying them in their toils, by sympathizing in their sufferings,\r\nand rejoicing in their successes and their triumphs; we seem to belong\r\nto their age, and to mingle our own existence with theirs. We become\r\ntheir contemporaries, live the lives which they lived, endure what they\r\nendured, and partake in the rewards which they enjoyed. And in like\r\nmanner, by running along the line of future time, by contemplating the\r\nprobable fortunes of those who are coming after us, by attempting\r\nsomething which may promote their happiness, and leave some not\r\ndishonorable memorial of ourselves for their regard, when we shall sleep\r\nwith the fathers, we protract our own earthly being, and seem to crowd\r\nwhatever is future, as well as all that is past, into the narrow compass\r\nof our earthly existence. As it is not a vain and false, but an exalted\r\nand religious imagination, which leads us to raise our thoughts from the\r\norb, which, amidst this universe of worlds, the Creator has given us to\r\ninhabit, and to send them with something of the feeling which nature\r\nprompts, and teaches to be proper among children of the same Eternal\r\nParent, to the contemplation of the myriads of fellow-beings with which\r\nhis goodness has peopled the infinite of space; so neither is it false\r\nor vain to consider ourselves as interested and connected with our whole\r\nrace, through all time; allied to our ancestors; allied to our\r\nposterity; closely compacted on all sides with others; ourselves being\r\nbut links in the great chain of being, which begins with the origin of\r\nour race, runs onward through its successive generations, binding\r\ntogether the past, the present, and the future, and terminating at last,\r\nwith the consummation of all things earthly, at the throne of God.\r\n\r\nThere may be, and there often is, indeed, a regard for ancestry, which\r\nnourishes only a weak pride; as there is also a care for posterity,\r\nwhich only disguises an habitual avarice, or hides the workings of a low\r\nand grovelling vanity. But there is also a moral and philosophical\r\nrespect for our ancestors, which elevates the character and improves the\r\nheart. Next to the sense of religious duty and moral feeling, I hardly\r\nknow what should bear with stronger obligation on a liberal and\r\nenlightened mind, than a consciousness of alliance with excellence which\r\nis departed; and a consciousness, too, that in its acts and conduct, and\r\neven in its sentiments and thoughts, it may be actively operating on the\r\nhappiness of those who come after it. Poetry is found to have few\r\nstronger conceptions, by which it would affect or overwhelm the mind,\r\nthan those in which it presents the moving and speaking image of the\r\ndeparted dead to the senses of the living. This belongs to poetry, only\r\nbecause it is congenial to our nature. Poetry is, in this respect, but\r\nthe handmaid of true philosophy and morality; it deals with us as human\r\nbeings, naturally reverencing those whose visible connection with this\r\nstate of existence is severed, and who may yet exercise we know not what\r\nsympathy with ourselves; and when it carries us forward, also, and shows\r\nus the long continued result of all the good we do, in the prosperity of\r\nthose who follow us, till it bears us from ourselves, and absorbs us in\r\nan intense interest for what shall happen to the generations after us,\r\nit speaks only in the language of our nature, and affects us with\r\nsentiments which belong to us as human beings.\r\n\r\nStanding in this relation to our ancestors and our posterity, we are\r\nassembled on this memorable spot, to perform the duties which that\r\nrelation and the present occasion impose upon us. We have come to this\r\nRock, to record here our homage for our Pilgrim Fathers; our sympathy in\r\ntheir sufferings; our gratitude for their labors; our admiration of\r\ntheir virtues; our veneration for their piety; and our attachment to\r\nthose principles of civil and religious liberty, which they encountered\r\nthe dangers of the ocean, the storms of heaven, the violence of savages,\r\ndisease, exile, and famine, to enjoy and to establish. And we would\r\nleave here, also, for the generations which are rising up rapidly to\r\nfill our places, some proof that we have endeavored to transmit the\r\ngreat inheritance unimpaired; that in our estimate of public principles\r\nand private virtue, in our veneration of religion and piety, in our\r\ndevotion to civil and religious liberty, in our regard for whatever\r\nadvances human knowledge or improves human happiness, we are not\r\naltogether unworthy of our origin.\r\n\r\nThere is a local feeling connected with this occasion, too strong to be\r\nresisted; a sort of _genius of the place_, which inspires and awes us.\r\nWe feel that we are on the spot where the first scene of our history was\r\nlaid; where the hearths and altars of New England were first placed;\r\nwhere Christianity, and civilization, and letters made their first\r\nlodgement, in a vast extent of country, covered with a wilderness, and\r\npeopled by roving barbarians. We are here, at the season of the year at\r\nwhich the event took place. The imagination irresistibly and rapidly\r\ndraws around us the principal features and the leading characters in the\r\noriginal scene. We cast our eyes abroad on the ocean, and we see where\r\nthe little bark, with the interesting group upon its deck, made its slow\r\nprogress to the shore. We look around us, and behold the hills and\r\npromontories where the anxious eyes of our fathers first saw the places\r\nof habitation and of rest. We feel the cold which benumbed, and listen\r\nto the winds which pierced them. Beneath us is the Rock,[1] on which New\r\nEngland received the feet of the Pilgrims. We seem even to behold them,\r\nas they struggle with the elements, and, with toilsome efforts, gain the\r\nshore. We listen to the chiefs in council; we see the unexampled\r\nexhibition of female fortitude and resignation; we hear the whisperings\r\nof youthful impatience, and we see, what a painter of our own has also\r\nrepresented by his pencil,[2] chilled and shivering childhood,\r\nhouseless, but for a mother's arms, couchless, but for a mother's\r\nbreast, till our own blood almost freezes. The mild dignity of Carver\r\nand of Bradford; the decisive and soldier-like air and manner of\r\nStandish; the devout Brewster; the enterprising Allerton;[3] the general\r\nfirmness and thoughtfulness of the whole band; their conscious joy for\r\ndangers escaped; their deep solicitude about dangers to come; their\r\ntrust in Heaven; their high religious faith, full of confidence and\r\nanticipation; all of these seem to belong to this place, and to be\r\npresent upon this occasion, to fill us with reverence and admiration.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of New England by the colony which landed here[4] on the\r\ntwenty-second[5] of December, sixteen hundred and twenty, although not\r\nthe first European establishment in what now constitutes the United\r\nStates, was yet so peculiar in its causes and character, and has been\r\nfollowed and must still be followed by such consequences, as to give it\r\na high claim to lasting commemoration. On these causes and consequences,\r\nmore than on its immediately attendant circumstances, its importance, as\r\nan historical event, depends. Great actions and striking occurrences,\r\nhaving excited a temporary admiration, often pass away and are\r\nforgotten, because they leave no lasting results, affecting the\r\nprosperity and happiness of communities. Such is frequently the fortune\r\nof the most brilliant military achievements. Of the ten thousand battles\r\nwhich have been fought, of all the fields fertilized with carnage, of\r\nthe banners which have been bathed in blood, of the warriors who have\r\nhoped that they had risen from the field of conquest to a glory as\r\nbright and as durable as the stars, how few that continue long to\r\ninterest mankind! The victory of yesterday is reversed by the defeat of\r\nto-day; the star of military glory, rising like a meteor, like a meteor\r\nhas fallen; disgrace and disaster hang on the heels of conquest and\r\nrenown; victor and vanquished presently pass away to oblivion, and the\r\nworld goes on in its course, with the loss only of so many lives and so\r\nmuch treasure.\r\n\r\nBut if this be frequently, or generally, the fortune of military\r\nachievements, it is not always so. There are enterprises, military as\r\nwell as civil, which sometimes check the current of events, give a new\r\nturn to human affairs, and transmit their consequences through ages. We\r\nsee their importance in their results, and call them great, because\r\ngreat things follow. There have been battles which have fixed the fate\r\nof nations. These come down to us in history with a solid and permanent\r\ninterest, not created by a display of glittering armor, the rush of\r\nadverse battalions, the sinking and rising of pennons, the flight, the\r\npursuit, and the victory; but by their effect in advancing or retarding\r\nhuman knowledge, in overthrowing or establishing despotism, in extending\r\nor destroying human happiness. When the traveller pauses on the plain of\r\nMarathon, what are the emotions which most strongly agitate his breast?\r\nWhat is that glorious recollection, which thrills through his frame, and\r\nsuffuses his eyes? Not, I imagine, that Grecian skill and Grecian valor\r\nwere here most signally displayed; but that Greece herself was saved. It\r\nis because to this spot, and to the event which has rendered it\r\nimmortal, he refers all the succeeding glories of the republic. It is\r\nbecause, if that day had gone otherwise, Greece had perished. It is\r\nbecause he perceives that her philosophers and orators, her poets and\r\npainters, her sculptors and architects, her governments and free\r\ninstitutions, point backward to Marathon, and that their future\r\nexistence seems to have been suspended on the contingency, whether the\r\nPersian or the Grecian banner should wave victorious in the beams of\r\nthat day's setting sun. And, as his imagination kindles at the\r\nretrospect, he is transported back to the interesting moment; he counts\r\nthe fearful odds of the contending hosts; his interest for the result\r\noverwhelms him; he trembles, as if it were still uncertain, and seems to\r\ndoubt whether he may consider Socrates and Plato, Demosthenes,\r\nSophocles, and Phidias, as secure, yet, to himself and to the world.\r\n\r\n\"If we conquer,\" said the Athenian commander on the approach of that\r\ndecisive day, \"if we conquer, we shall make Athens the greatest city of\r\nGreece.\"[6] A prophecy how well fulfilled! \"If God prosper us,\" might\r\nhave been the more appropriate language of our fathers, when they landed\r\nupon this Rock, \"if God prosper us, we shall here begin a work which\r\nshall last for ages; we shall plant here a new society, in the\r\nprinciples of the fullest liberty and the purest religion; we shall\r\nsubdue this wilderness which is before us; we shall fill this region of\r\nthe great continent, which stretches almost from pole to pole, with\r\ncivilization and Christianity; the temples of the true God shall rise,\r\nwhere now ascends the smoke of idolatrous sacrifice; fields and gardens,\r\nthe flowers of summer, and the waving and golden harvest of autumn,\r\nshall spread over a thousand hills, and stretch along a thousand\r\nvalleys, never yet, since the creation, reclaimed to the use of\r\ncivilized man. We shall whiten this coast with the canvas of a\r\nprosperous commerce; we shall stud the long and winding shore with a\r\nhundred cities. That which we sow in weakness shall be raised in\r\nstrength. From our sincere, but houseless worship, there shall spring\r\nsplendid temples to record God's goodness; from the simplicity of our\r\nsocial union, there shall arise wise and politic constitutions of\r\ngovernment, full of the liberty which we ourselves bring and breathe;\r\nfrom our zeal for learning, institutions shall spring which shall\r\nscatter the light of knowledge throughout the land, and, in time, paying\r\nback where they have borrowed, shall contribute their part to the great\r\naggregate of human knowledge; and our descendants, through all\r\ngenerations, shall look back to this spot, and to this hour, with\r\nunabated affection and regard.\"\r\n\r\nA brief remembrance of the causes which led to the settlement of this\r\nplace; some account of the peculiarities and characteristic qualities of\r\nthat settlement, as distinguished from other instances of colonization;\r\na short notice of the progress of New England in the great interests of\r\nsociety, during the century which is now elapsed; with a few\r\nobservations on the principles upon which society and government are\r\nestablished in this country; comprise all that can be attempted, and\r\nmuch more than can be satisfactorily performed, on the present occasion.\r\n\r\nOf the motives which influenced the first settlers to a voluntary exile,\r\ninduced them to relinquish their native country, and to seek an asylum\r\nin this then unexplored wilderness, the first and principal, no doubt,\r\nwere connected with religion. They sought to enjoy a higher degree of\r\nreligious freedom, and what they esteemed a purer form of religious\r\nworship, than was allowed to their choice, or presented to their\r\nimitation, in the Old World. The love of religious liberty is a stronger\r\nsentiment, when fully excited, than an attachment to civil or political\r\nfreedom. That freedom which the conscience demands, and which men feel\r\nbound by their hope of salvation to contend for, can hardly fail to be\r\nattained. Conscience, in the cause of religion and the worship of the\r\nDeity, prepares the mind to act and to suffer beyond almost all other\r\ncauses. It sometimes gives an impulse so irresistible, that no fetters\r\nof power or of opinion can withstand it. History instructs us that this\r\nlove of religious liberty, a compound sentiment in the breast of man,\r\nmade up of the clearest sense of right and the highest conviction of\r\nduty, is able to look the sternest despotism in the face, and, with\r\nmeans apparently most inadequate, to shake principalities and powers.\r\nThere is a boldness, a spirit of daring, in religious reformers, not to\r\nbe measured by the general rules which control men's purposes and\r\nactions. If the hand of power be laid upon it, this only seems to\r\naugment its force and its elasticity, and to cause its action to be more\r\nformidable and violent. Human invention has devised nothing, human\r\npower has compassed nothing, that can forcibly restrain it, when it\r\nbreaks forth. Nothing can stop it, but to give way to it; nothing can\r\ncheck it, but indulgence. It loses its power only when it has gained its\r\nobject. The principle of toleration, to which the world has come so\r\nslowly, is at once the most just and the most wise of all principles.\r\nEven when religious feeling takes a character of extravagance and\r\nenthusiasm, and seems to threaten the order of society and shake the\r\ncolumns of the social edifice, its principal danger is in its restraint.\r\nIf it be allowed indulgence and expansion, like the elemental fires, it\r\nonly agitates, and perhaps purifies, the atmosphere; while its efforts\r\nto throw off restraint would burst the world asunder.\r\n\r\nIt is certain, that, although many of them were republicans in\r\nprinciple, we have no evidence that our New England ancestors would have\r\nemigrated, as they did, from their own native country, would have become\r\nwanderers in Europe, and finally would have undertaken the establishment\r\nof a colony here, merely from their dislike of the political systems of\r\nEurope. They fled not so much from the civil government, as from the\r\nhierarchy, and the laws which enforced conformity to the church\r\nestablishment. Mr. Robinson had left England as early as 1608, on\r\naccount of the persecutions for non-conformity, and had retired to\r\nHolland. He left England from no disappointed ambition in affairs of\r\nstate, from no regrets at the want of preferment in the church, nor from\r\nany motive of distinction or of gain. Uniformity in matters of religion\r\nwas pressed with such extreme rigor, that a voluntary exile seemed the\r\nmost eligible mode of escaping from the penalties of non-compliance. The\r\naccession of Elizabeth had, it is true, quenched the fires of\r\nSmithfield, and put an end to the easy acquisition of the crown of\r\nmartyrdom. Her long reign had established the Reformation, but\r\ntoleration was a virtue beyond her conception, and beyond the age. She\r\nleft no example of it to her successor; and he was not of a character\r\nwhich rendered a sentiment either so wise or so liberal would originate\r\nwith him. At the present period it seems incredible that the learned,\r\naccomplished, unassuming, and inoffensive Robinson should neither be\r\ntolerated in his peaceable mode of worship in his own country, nor\r\nsuffered quietly to depart from it. Yet such was the fact. He left his\r\ncountry by stealth, that he might elsewhere enjoy those rights which\r\nought to belong to men in all countries. The departure of the Pilgrims\r\nfor Holland is deeply interesting, from its circumstances, and also as\r\nit marks the character of the times, independently of its connection\r\nwith names now incorporated with the history of empire. The embarkation\r\nwas intended to be made in such a manner that it might escape the notice\r\nof the officers of government. Great pains had been taken to secure\r\nboats, which should come undiscovered to the shore, and receive the\r\nfugitives; and frequent disappointments had been experienced in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nAt length the appointed time came, bringing with it unusual severity of\r\ncold and rain. An unfrequented and barren heath, on the shores of\r\nLincolnshire, was the selected spot, where the feet of the Pilgrims were\r\nto tread, for the last time, the land of their fathers. The vessel which\r\nwas to receive them did not come until the next day, and in the mean\r\ntime the little band was collected, and men and women and children and\r\nbaggage were crowded together, in melancholy and distressed confusion.\r\nThe sea was rough, and the women and children were already sick, from\r\ntheir passage down the river to the place of embarkation on the sea. At\r\nlength the wished-for boat silently and fearfully approaches the shore,\r\nand men and women and children, shaking with fear and with cold, as many\r\nas the small vessel could bear, venture off on a dangerous sea.\r\nImmediately the advance of horses is heard from behind, armed men\r\nappear, and those not yet embarked are seized and taken into custody. In\r\nthe hurry of the moment, the first parties had been sent on board\r\nwithout any attempt to keep members of the same family together, and on\r\naccount of the appearance of the horsemen, the boat never returned for\r\nthe residue. Those who had got away, and those who had not, were in\r\nequal distress. A storm, of great violence and long duration, arose at\r\nsea, which not only protracted the voyage, rendered distressing by the\r\nwant of all those accommodations which the interruption of the\r\nembarkation had occasioned, but also forced the vessel out of her\r\ncourse, and menaced immediate shipwreck; while those on shore, when they\r\nwere dismissed from the custody of the officers of justice, having no\r\nlonger homes or houses to retire to, and their friends and protectors\r\nbeing already gone, became objects of necessary charity, as well as of\r\ndeep commiseration.\r\n\r\nAs this scene passes before us, we can hardly forbear asking whether\r\nthis be a band of malefactors and felons flying from justice. What are\r\ntheir crimes, that they hide themselves in darkness? To what punishment\r\nare they exposed, that, to avoid it, men, and women, and children, thus\r\nencounter the surf of the North Sea and the terrors of a night storm?\r\nWhat induces this armed pursuit, and this arrest of fugitives, of all\r\nages and both sexes? Truth does not allow us to answer these inquiries\r\nin a manner that does credit to the wisdom or the justice of the times.\r\nThis was not the flight of guilt, but of virtue. It was an humble and\r\npeaceable religion, flying from causeless oppression. It was conscience,\r\nattempting to escape from the arbitrary rule of the Stuarts. It was\r\nRobinson and Brewster, leading off their little band from their native\r\nsoil, at first to find shelter on the shore of the neighboring\r\ncontinent, but ultimately to come hither; and having surmounted all\r\ndifficulties and braved a thousand dangers, to find here a place of\r\nrefuge and of rest. Thanks be to God, that this spot was honored as the\r\nasylum of religious liberty! May its standard, reared here, remain for\r\never! May it rise up as high as heaven, till its banner shall fan the\r\nair of both continents, and wave as a glorious ensign of peace and\r\nsecurity to the nations!\r\n\r\nThe peculiar character, condition, and circumstances of the colonies\r\nwhich introduced civilization and an English race into New England,\r\nafford a most interesting and extensive topic of discussion. On these,\r\nmuch of our subsequent character and fortune has depended. Their\r\ninfluence has essentially affected our whole history, through the two\r\ncenturies which have elapsed; and as they have become intimately\r\nconnected with government, laws, and property, as well as with our\r\nopinions on the subjects of religion and civil liberty, that influence\r\nis likely to continue to be felt through the centuries which shall\r\nsucceed. Emigration from one region to another, and the emission of\r\ncolonies to people countries more or less distant from the residence of\r\nthe parent stock, are common incidents in the history of mankind; but it\r\nhas not often, perhaps never, happened, that the establishment of\r\ncolonies should be attempted under circumstances, however beset with\r\npresent difficulties and dangers, yet so favorable to ultimate success,\r\nand so conducive to magnificent results, as those which attended the\r\nfirst settlements on this part of the American continent. In other\r\ninstances, emigration has proceeded from a less exalted purpose, in\r\nperiods of less general intelligence, or more without plan and by\r\naccident; or under circumstances, physical and moral, less favorable to\r\nthe expectation of laying a foundation for great public prosperity and\r\nfuture empire.\r\n\r\nA great resemblance exists, obviously, between all the English colonies\r\nestablished within the present limits of the United States; but the\r\noccasion attracts our attention more immediately to those which took\r\npossession of New England, and the peculiarities of these furnish a\r\nstrong contrast with most other instances of colonization.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient nations, the Greeks, no doubt, sent forth from their\r\nterritories the greatest number of colonies. So numerous, indeed, were\r\nthey, and so great the extent of space over which they were spread, that\r\nthe parent country fondly and naturally persuaded herself, that by\r\nmeans of them she had laid a sure foundation for the universal\r\ncivilization of the world. These establishments, from obvious causes,\r\nwere most numerous in places most contiguous; yet they were found on the\r\ncoasts of France, on the shores of the Euxine Sea, in Africa, and even,\r\nas is alleged, on the borders of India. These emigrations appear to have\r\nbeen sometimes voluntary and sometimes compulsory; arising from the\r\nspontaneous enterprise of individuals, or the order and regulation of\r\ngovernment. It was a common opinion with ancient writers, that they were\r\nundertaken in religious obedience to the commands of oracles, and it is\r\nprobable that impressions of this sort might have had more or less\r\ninfluence; but it is probable, also, that on these occasions the oracles\r\ndid not speak a language dissonant from the views and purposes of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nPolitical science among the Greeks seems never to have extended to the\r\ncomprehension of a system, which should be adequate to the government of\r\na great nation upon principles of liberty. They were accustomed only to\r\nthe contemplation of small republics, and were led to consider an\r\naugmented population as incompatible with free institutions. The desire\r\nof a remedy for this supposed evil, and the wish to establish marts for\r\ntrade, led the governments often to undertake the establishment of\r\ncolonies as an affair of state expediency. Colonization and commerce,\r\nindeed, would naturally become objects of interest to an ingenious and\r\nenterprising people, inhabiting a territory closely circumscribed in its\r\nlimits, and in no small part mountainous and sterile; while the islands\r\nof the adjacent seas, and the promontories and coasts of the neighboring\r\ncontinents, by their mere proximity, strongly solicited the excited\r\nspirit of emigration. Such was this proximity, in many instances, that\r\nthe new settlements appeared rather to be the mere extension of\r\npopulation over contiguous territory, than the establishment of distant\r\ncolonies. In proportion as they were near to the parent state, they\r\nwould be under its authority, and partake of its fortunes. The colony at\r\nMarseilles might perceive lightly, or not at all, the sway of Phocis;\r\nwhile the islands in the Aegean Sea could hardly attain to independence\r\nof their Athenian origin. Many of these establishments took place at an\r\nearly age; and if there were defects in the governments of the parent\r\nstates, the colonists did not possess philosophy or experience\r\nsufficient to correct such evils in their own institutions, even if they\r\nhad not been, by other causes, deprived of the power. An immediate\r\nnecessity, connected with the support of life, was the main and direct\r\ninducement to these undertakings, and there could hardly exist more than\r\nthe hope of a successful imitation of institutions with which they were\r\nalready acquainted, and of holding an equality with their neighbors in\r\nthe course of improvement. The laws and customs, both political and\r\nmunicipal, as well as the religious worship of the parent city, were\r\ntransferred to the colony; and the parent city herself, with all such of\r\nher colonies as were not too far remote for frequent intercourse and\r\ncommon sentiments, would appear like a family of cities, more or less\r\ndependent, and more or less connected. We know how imperfect this system\r\nwas, as a system of general politics, and what scope it gave to those\r\nmutual dissensions and conflicts which proved so fatal to Greece.\r\n\r\nBut it is more pertinent to our present purpose to observe, that nothing\r\nexisted in the character of Grecian emigrations, or in the spirit and\r\nintelligence of the emigrants, likely to give a new and important\r\ndirection to human affairs, or a new impulse to the human mind. Their\r\nmotives were not high enough, their views were not sufficiently large\r\nand prospective. They went not forth, like our ancestors, to erect\r\nsystems of more perfect civil liberty, or to enjoy a higher degree of\r\nreligious freedom. Above all, there was nothing in the religion and\r\nlearning of the age, that could either inspire high purposes, or give\r\nthe ability to execute them. Whatever restraints on civil liberty, or\r\nwhatever abuses in religious worship, existed at the time of our\r\nfathers' emigration, yet even then all was light in the moral and mental\r\nworld, in comparison with its condition in most periods of the ancient\r\nstates. The settlement of a new continent, in an age of progressive\r\nknowledge and improvement, could not but do more than merely enlarge the\r\nnatural boundaries of the habitable world. It could not but do much more\r\neven than extend commerce and increase wealth among the human race. We\r\nsee how this event has acted, how it must have acted, and wonder only\r\nwhy it did not act sooner, in the production of moral effects, on the\r\nstate of human knowledge, the general tone of human sentiments, and the\r\nprospects of human happiness. It gave to civilized man not only a new\r\ncontinent to be inhabited and cultivated, and new seas to be explored;\r\nbut it gave him also a new range for his thoughts, new objects for\r\ncuriosity, and new excitements to knowledge and improvement.\r\n\r\nRoman colonization resembled, far less than that of the Greeks, the\r\noriginal settlements of this country. Power and dominion were the\r\nobjects of Rome, even in her colonial establishments. Her whole exterior\r\naspect was for centuries hostile and terrific. She grasped at dominion,\r\nfrom India to Britain, and her measures of colonization partook of the\r\ncharacter of her general system. Her policy was military, because her\r\nobjects were power, ascendency, and subjugation. Detachments of\r\nemigrants from Rome incorporated themselves with, and governed, the\r\noriginal inhabitants of conquered countries. She sent citizens where she\r\nhad first sent soldiers; her law followed her sword. Her colonies were a\r\nsort of military establishment; so many advanced posts in the career of\r\nher dominion. A governor from Rome ruled the new colony with absolute\r\nsway, and often with unbounded rapacity. In Sicily, in Gaul, in Spain,\r\nand in Asia, the power of Rome prevailed, not nominally only, but really\r\nand effectually. Those who immediately exercised it were Roman; the tone\r\nand tendency of its administration, Roman. Rome herself continued to be\r\nthe heart and centre of the great system which she had established.\r\nExtortion and rapacity, finding a wide and often rich field of action in\r\nthe provinces, looked nevertheless to the banks of the Tiber, as the\r\nscene in which their ill-gotten treasures should be displayed; or, if a\r\nspirit of more honest acquisition prevailed, the object, nevertheless,\r\nwas ultimate enjoyment in Rome itself. If our own history and our own\r\ntimes did not sufficiently expose the inherent and incurable evils of\r\nprovincial government, we might see them portrayed, to our amazement, in\r\nthe desolated and ruined provinces of the Roman empire. We might hear\r\nthem, in a voice that terrifies us, in those strains of complaint and\r\naccusation, which the advocates of the provinces poured forth in the\r\nRoman Forum:--\"Quas res luxuries in flagitiis, crudelitas in suppliciis,\r\navaritia in rapinis, superbia in contumeliis, efficere potuisset, eas\r\nomnes sese pertulisse.\"\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, the Roman Provinces partook of the fortunes, as\r\nwell as of the sentiments and general character, of the seat of empire.\r\nThey lived together with her, they flourished with her, and fell with\r\nher. The branches were lopped away even before the vast and venerable\r\ntrunk itself fell prostrate to the earth. Nothing had proceeded from her\r\nwhich could support itself, and bear up the name of its origin, when her\r\nown sustaining arm should be enfeebled or withdrawn. It was not given to\r\nRome to see, either at her zenith or in her decline, a child of her own,\r\ndistant, indeed, and independent of her control, yet speaking her\r\nlanguage and inheriting her blood, springing forward to a competition\r\nwith her own power, and a comparison with her own great renown. She saw\r\nnot a vast region of the earth peopled from her stock, full of states\r\nand political communities, improving upon the models of her\r\ninstitutions, and breathing in fuller measure the spirit which she had\r\nbreathed in the best periods of her existence; enjoying and extending\r\nher arts and her literature; rising rapidly from political childhood to\r\nmanly strength and independence; her offspring, yet now her equal;\r\nunconnected with the causes which might affect the duration of her own\r\npower and greatness; of common origin, but not linked to a common fate;\r\ngiving ample pledge, that her name should not be forgotten, that her\r\nlanguage should not cease to be used among men; that whatsoever she had\r\ndone for human knowledge and human happiness should be treasured up and\r\npreserved; that the record of her existence and her achievements should\r\nnot be obscured, although, in the inscrutable purposes of Providence, it\r\nmight be her destiny to fall from opulence and splendor; although the\r\ntime might come, when darkness should settle on all her hills; when\r\nforeign or domestic violence should overturn her altars and her temples;\r\nwhen ignorance and despotism should fill the places where Laws, and\r\nArts, and Liberty had flourished; when the feet of barbarism should\r\ntrample on the tombs of her consuls, and the walls of her senate-house\r\nand forum echo only to the voice of savage triumph. She saw not this\r\nglorious vision, to inspire and fortify her against the possible decay\r\nor downfall of her power. Happy are they who in our day may behold it,\r\nif they shall contemplate it with the sentiments which it ought to\r\ninspire!\r\n\r\nThe New England Colonies differ quite as widely from the Asiatic\r\nestablishments of the modern European nations, as from the models of the\r\nancient states. The sole object of those establishments was originally\r\ntrade; although we have seen, in one of them, the anomaly of a mere\r\ntrading company attaining a political character, disbursing revenues,\r\nand maintaining armies and fortresses, until it has extended its control\r\nover seventy millions of people. Differing from these, and still more\r\nfrom the New England and North American Colonies, are the European\r\nsettlements in the West India Islands. It is not strange, that, when\r\nmen's minds were turned to the settlement of America, different objects\r\nshould be proposed by those who emigrated to the different regions of so\r\nvast a country. Climate, soil, and condition were not all equally\r\nfavorable to all pursuits. In the West Indies, the purpose of those who\r\nwent thither was to engage in that species of agriculture, suited to the\r\nsoil and climate, which seems to bear more resemblance to commerce than\r\nto the hard and plain tillage of New England. The great staples of these\r\ncountries, being partly an agricultural and partly a manufactured\r\nproduct, and not being of the necessaries of life, become the object of\r\ncalculation, with respect to a profitable investment of capital, like\r\nany other enterprise of trade or manufacture. The more especially, as,\r\nrequiring, by necessity or habit, slave labor for their production, the\r\ncapital necessary to carry on the work of this production is very\r\nconsiderable. The West Indies are resorted to, therefore, rather for the\r\ninvestment of capital than for the purpose of sustaining life by\r\npersonal labor. Such as possess a considerable amount of capital, or\r\nsuch as choose to adventure in commercial speculations without capital,\r\ncan alone be fitted to be emigrants to the islands. The agriculture of\r\nthese regions, as before observed, is a sort of commerce; and it is a\r\nspecies of employment in which labor seems to form an inconsiderable\r\ningredient in the productive causes, since the portion of white labor is\r\nexceedingly small, and slave labor is rather more like profit on stock\r\nor capital than _labor_ properly so called. The individual who\r\nundertakes an establishment of this kind takes into the account the cost\r\nof the necessary number of slaves, in the same manner as he calculates\r\nthe cost of the land. The uncertainty, too, of this species of\r\nemployment, affords another ground of resemblance to commerce. Although\r\ngainful on the whole, and in a series of years, it is often very\r\ndisastrous for a single year, and, as the capital is not readily\r\ninvested in other pursuits, bad crops or bad markets not only affect the\r\nprofits, but the capital itself. Hence the sudden depressions which take\r\nplace in the value of such estates.\r\n\r\nBut the great and leading observation, relative to these establishments,\r\nremains to be made. It is, that the owners of the soil and of the\r\ncapital seldom consider themselves _at home_ in the colony. A very\r\ngreat portion of the soil itself is usually owned in the mother country;\r\na still greater is mortgaged for capital obtained there; and, in\r\ngeneral, those who are to derive an interest from the products look to\r\nthe parent country as the place for enjoyment of their wealth. The\r\npopulation is therefore constantly fluctuating. Nobody comes but to\r\nreturn. A constant succession of owners, agents, and factors takes\r\nplace. Whatsoever the soil, forced by the unmitigated toil of slavery,\r\ncan yield, is sent home to defray rents, and interest, and agencies, or\r\nto give the means of living in a better society. In such a state, it is\r\nevident that no spirit of permanent improvement is likely to spring up.\r\nProfits will not be invested with a distant view of benefiting\r\nposterity. Roads and canals will hardly be built; schools will not be\r\nfounded; colleges will not be endowed. There will be few fixtures in\r\nsociety; no principles of utility or of elegance, planted now, with the\r\nhope of being developed and expanded hereafter. Profit, immediate\r\nprofit, must be the principal active spring in the social system. There\r\nmay be many particular exceptions to these general remarks, but the\r\noutline of the whole is such as is here drawn.\r\n\r\nAnother most important consequence of such a state of things is, that no\r\nidea of independence of the parent country is likely to arise; unless,\r\nindeed, it should spring up in a form that would threaten universal\r\ndesolation. The inhabitants have no strong attachment to the place which\r\nthey inhabit. The hope of a great portion of them is to leave it; and\r\ntheir great desire, to leave it soon. However useful they may be to the\r\nparent state, how much soever they may add to the conveniences and\r\nluxuries of life, these colonies are not favored spots for the expansion\r\nof the human mind, for the progress of permanent improvement, or for\r\nsowing the seeds of future independent empire.\r\n\r\nDifferent, indeed, most widely different, from all these instances of\r\nemigration and plantation, were the condition, the purposes, and the\r\nprospects of our fathers, when they established their infant colony upon\r\nthis spot. They came hither to a land from which they were never to\r\nreturn. Hither they had brought, and here they were to fix, their hopes,\r\ntheir attachments, and their objects in life. Some natural tears they\r\nshed, as they left the pleasant abodes of their fathers, and some\r\nemotions they suppressed, when the white cliffs of their native country,\r\nnow seen for the last time, grew dim to their sight. They were acting,\r\nhowever, upon a resolution not to be daunted. With whatever stifled\r\nregrets, with whatever occasional hesitation, with whatever appalling\r\napprehensions, which might sometimes arise with force to shake the\r\nfirmest purpose, they had yet committed themselves to Heaven and the\r\nelements; and a thousand leagues of water soon interposed to separate\r\nthem for ever from the region which gave them birth. A new existence\r\nawaited them here; and when they saw these shores, rough, cold,\r\nbarbarous, and barren, as then they were, they beheld their country.\r\nThat mixed and strong feeling, which we call love of country, and which\r\nis, in general, never extinguished in the heart of man, grasped and\r\nembraced its proper object here. Whatever constitutes _country_, except\r\nthe earth and the sun, all the moral causes of affection and attachment\r\nwhich operate upon the heart, they had brought with them to their new\r\nabode. Here were now their families and friends, their homes, and their\r\nproperty. Before they reached the shore, they had established the\r\nelements of a social system,[7] and at a much earlier period had settled\r\ntheir forms of religious worship. At the moment of their landing,\r\ntherefore, they possessed institutions of government, and institutions\r\nof religion: and friends and families, and social and religious\r\ninstitutions, framed by consent, founded on choice and preference, how\r\nnearly do these fill up our whole idea of country! The morning that\r\nbeamed on the first night of their repose saw the Pilgrims already _at\r\nhome_ in their country. There were political institutions, and civil\r\nliberty, and religious worship. Poetry has fancied nothing, in the\r\nwanderings of heroes, so distinct and characteristic. Here was man,\r\nindeed, unprotected, and unprovided for, on the shore of a rude and\r\nfearful wilderness; but it was politic, intelligent, and educated man.\r\nEvery thing was civilized but the physical world. Institutions,\r\ncontaining in substance all that ages had done for human government,\r\nwere organized in a forest. Cultivated mind was to act on uncultivated\r\nnature; and, more than all, a government and a country were to commence,\r\nwith the very first foundations laid under the divine light of the\r\nChristian religion. Happy auspices of a happy futurity! Who would wish\r\nthat his country's existence had otherwise begun? Who would desire the\r\npower of going back to the ages of fable? Who would wish for an origin\r\nobscured in the darkness of antiquity? Who would wish for other\r\nemblazoning of his country's heraldry, or other ornaments of her\r\ngenealogy, than to be able to say, that her first existence was with\r\nintelligence, her first breath the inspiration of liberty, her first\r\nprinciple the truth of divine religion?\r\n\r\nLocal attachments and sympathies would ere long spring up in the breasts\r\nof our ancestors, endearing to them the place of their refuge. Whatever\r\nnatural objects are associated with interesting scenes and high efforts\r\nobtain a hold on human feeling, and demand from the heart a sort of\r\nrecognition and regard. This Rock soon became hallowed in the esteem of\r\nthe Pilgrims,[8] and these hills grateful to their sight. Neither they\r\nnor their children were again to till the soil of England, nor again to\r\ntraverse the seas which surround her.[9] But here was a new sea, now\r\nopen to their enterprise, and a new soil, which had not failed to\r\nrespond gratefully to their laborious industry, and which was already\r\nassuming a robe of verdure. Hardly had they provided shelter for the\r\nliving, ere they were summoned to erect sepulchres for the dead. The\r\nground had become sacred, by enclosing the remains of some of their\r\ncompanions and connections. A parent, a child, a husband, or a wife, had\r\ngone the way of all flesh, and mingled with the dust of New England. We\r\nnaturally look with strong emotions to the spot, though it be a\r\nwilderness, where the ashes of those we have loved repose. Where the\r\nheart has laid down what it loved most, there it is desirous of laying\r\nitself down. No sculptured marble, no enduring monument, no honorable\r\ninscription, no ever-burning taper that would drive away the darkness of\r\nthe tomb, can soften our sense of the reality of death, and hallow to\r\nour feelings the ground which is to cover us, like the consciousness\r\nthat we shall sleep, dust to dust, with the objects of our affections.\r\n\r\nIn a short time other causes sprung up to bind the Pilgrims with new\r\ncords to their chosen land. Children were born, and the hopes of future\r\ngenerations arose, in the spot of their new habitation. The second\r\ngeneration found this the land of their nativity, and saw that they were\r\nbound to its fortunes. They beheld their fathers' graves around them,\r\nand while they read the memorials of their toils and labors, they\r\nrejoiced in the inheritance which they found bequeathed to them.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these causes, it was to be expected that an\r\ninterest and a feeling should arise here, entirely different from the\r\ninterest and feeling of mere Englishmen; and all the subsequent history\r\nof the Colonies proves this to have actually and gradually taken place.\r\nWith a general acknowledgment of the supremacy of the British crown,\r\nthere was, from the first, a repugnance to an entire submission to the\r\ncontrol of British legislation. The Colonies stood upon their charters,\r\nwhich, as they contended, exempted them from the ordinary power of the\r\nBritish Parliament, and authorized them to conduct their own concerns by\r\ntheir own counsels. They utterly resisted the notion that they were to\r\nbe ruled by the mere authority of the government at home, and would not\r\nendure even that their own charter governments should be established on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic. It was not a controlling or protecting\r\nboard in England, but a government of their own, and existing\r\nimmediately within their limits, which could satisfy their wishes. It\r\nwas easy to foresee, what we know also to have happened, that the first\r\ngreat cause of collision and jealousy would be, under the notion of\r\npolitical economy then and still prevalent in Europe, an attempt on the\r\npart of the mother country to monopolize the trade of the Colonies.\r\nWhoever has looked deeply into the causes which produced our Revolution\r\nhas found, if I mistake not, the original principle far back in this\r\nclaim, on the part of England, to monopolize our trade, and a continued\r\neffort on the part of the Colonies to resist or evade that monopoly; if,\r\nindeed, it be not still more just and philosophical to go farther back,\r\nand to consider it decided, that an independent government must arise\r\nhere, the moment it was ascertained that an English colony, such as\r\nlanded in this place, could sustain itself against the dangers which\r\nsurrounded it, and, with other similar establishments, overspread the\r\nland with an English population. Accidental causes retarded at times,\r\nand at times accelerated, the progress of the controversy. The Colonies\r\nwanted strength, and time gave it to them. They required measures of\r\nstrong and palpable injustice, on the part of the mother country, to\r\njustify resistance; the early part of the late king's reign furnished\r\nthem. They needed spirits of high order, of great daring, of long\r\nforesight, and of commanding power, to seize the favoring occasion to\r\nstrike a blow, which should sever, for all time, the tie of colonial\r\ndependence; and these spirits were found, in all the extent which that\r\nor any crisis could demand, in Otis, Adams, Hancock, and the other\r\nimmediate authors of our independence.\r\n\r\nStill, it is true that, for a century, causes had been in operation\r\ntending to prepare things for this great result. In the year 1660 the\r\nEnglish Act of Navigation was passed; the first and grand object of\r\nwhich seems to have been, to secure to England the whole trade with her\r\nplantations.[10] It was provided by that act, that none but English\r\nships should transport American produce over the ocean, and that the\r\nprincipal articles of that produce should be allowed to be sold only in\r\nthe markets of the mother country. Three years afterwards another law\r\nwas passed, which enacted, that such commodities as the Colonies might\r\nwish to purchase should be bought only in the markets of the mother\r\ncountry. Severe rules were prescribed to enforce the provisions of these\r\nlaws, and heavy penalties imposed on all who should violate them. In the\r\nsubsequent years of the same reign, other statutes were enacted to\r\nre-enforce these statutes, and other rules prescribed to secure a\r\ncompliance with these rules. In this manner was the trade to and from\r\nthe Colonies restricted, almost to the exclusive advantage of the parent\r\ncountry. But laws, which rendered the interest of a whole people\r\nsubordinate to that of another people, were not likely to execute\r\nthemselves, nor was it easy to find many on the spot, who could be\r\ndepended upon for carrying them into execution. In fact, these laws were\r\nmore or less evaded or resisted, in all the Colonies. To enforce them\r\nwas the constant endeavor of the government at home; to prevent or elude\r\ntheir operation, the perpetual object here. \"The laws of navigation,\"\r\nsays a living British writer, \"were nowhere so openly disobeyed and\r\ncontemned as in New England.\" \"The people of Massachusetts Bay,\" he\r\nadds, \"were from the first disposed to act as if independent of the\r\nmother country, and having a governor and magistrates of their own\r\nchoice, it was difficult to enforce any regulation which came from the\r\nEnglish Parliament, adverse to their interests.\" To provide more\r\neffectually for the execution of these laws, we know that courts of\r\nadmiralty were afterwards established by the crown, with power to try\r\nrevenue causes, as questions of admiralty, upon the construction given\r\nby the crown lawyers to an act of Parliament; a great departure from the\r\nordinary principles of English jurisprudence, but which has been\r\nmaintained, nevertheless, by the force of habit and precedent, and is\r\nadopted in our own existing systems of government.\r\n\r\n\"There lie,\" says another English writer, whose connection with the\r\nBoard of Trade has enabled him to ascertain many facts connected with\r\nColonial history, \"There lie among the documents in the board of trade\r\nand state-paper office, the most satisfactory proofs, from the epoch of\r\nthe English Revolution in 1688, throughout every reign, and during every\r\nadministration, of the settled purpose of the Colonies to acquire direct\r\nindependence and positive sovereignty.\" Perhaps this may be stated\r\nsomewhat too strongly; but it cannot be denied, that, from the very\r\nnature of the establishments here, and from the general character of the\r\nmeasures respecting their concerns early adopted and steadily pursued by\r\nthe English government, a division of the empire was the natural and\r\nnecessary result to which every thing tended.[11]\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on this topic, because it seems to me, that the peculiar\r\noriginal character of the New England Colonies, and certain causes\r\ncoeval with their existence, have had a strong and decided influence on\r\nall their subsequent history, and especially on the great event of the\r\nRevolution. Whoever would write our history, and would understand and\r\nexplain early transactions, should comprehend the nature and force of\r\nthe feeling which I have endeavored to describe. As a son, leaving the\r\nhouse of his father for his own, finds, by the order of nature, and the\r\nvery law of his being, nearer and dearer objects around which his\r\naffections circle, while his attachment to the parental roof becomes\r\nmoderated, by degrees, to a composed regard and an affectionate\r\nremembrance; so our ancestors, leaving their native land, not without\r\nsome violence to the feelings of nature and affection, yet, in time,\r\nfound here a new circle of engagements, interests, and affections; a\r\nfeeling, which more and more encroached upon the old, till an undivided\r\nsentiment, _that this was their country_, occupied the heart; and\r\npatriotism, shutting out from its embraces the parent realm, became\r\n_local_ to America.\r\n\r\nSome retrospect of the century which has now elapsed is among the duties\r\nof the occasion. It must, however, necessarily be imperfect, to be\r\ncompressed within the limits of a single discourse. I shall content\r\nmyself, therefore, with taking notice of a few of the leading and most\r\nimportant occurrences which have distinguished the period.\r\n\r\nWhen the first century closed, the progress of the country appeared to\r\nhave been considerable; notwithstanding that, in comparison with its\r\nsubsequent advancement, it now seems otherwise. A broad and lasting\r\nfoundation had been laid; excellent institutions had been established;\r\nmany of the prejudices of former times had been removed; a more liberal\r\nand catholic spirit on subjects of religious concern had begun to extend\r\nitself, and many things conspired to give promise of increasing future\r\nprosperity. Great men had arisen in public life, and the liberal\r\nprofessions. The Mathers, father and son, were then sinking low in the\r\nwestern horizon; Leverett, the learned, the accomplished, the excellent\r\nLeverett, was about to withdraw his brilliant and useful light. In\r\nPemberton great hopes had been suddenly extinguished, but Prince and\r\nColman were in our sky; and along the east had begun to flash the\r\ncrepuscular light of a great luminary which was about to appear, and\r\nwhich was to stamp the age with his own name, as the age of Franklin.\r\n\r\nThe bloody Indian wars, which harassed the people for a part of the\r\nfirst century; the restrictions on the trade of the Colonies, added to\r\nthe discouragements inherently belonging to all forms of colonial\r\ngovernment; the distance from Europe, and the small hope of immediate\r\nprofit to adventurers, are among the causes which had contributed to\r\nretard the progress of population. Perhaps it may be added, also, that\r\nduring the period of the civil wars in England, and the reign of\r\nCromwell, many persons, whose religious opinions and religious temper\r\nmight, under other circumstances, have induced them to join the New\r\nEngland colonists, found reasons to remain in England; either on account\r\nof active occupation in the scenes which were passing, or of an\r\nanticipation of the enjoyment, in their own country, of a form of\r\ngovernment, civil and religious, accommodated to their views and\r\nprinciples. The violent measures, too, pursued against the Colonies in\r\nthe reign of Charles the Second, the mockery of a trial, and the\r\nforfeiture of the charters, were serious evils. And during the open\r\nviolences of the short reign of James the Second, and the tyranny of\r\nAndros, as the venerable historian of Connecticut observes, \"All the\r\nmotives to great actions, to industry, economy, enterprise, wealth, and\r\npopulation, were in a manner annihilated. A general inactivity and\r\nlanguishment pervaded the public body. Liberty, property, and every\r\nthing which ought to be dear to men, every day grew more and more\r\ninsecure.\"\r\n\r\nWith the Revolution in England, a better prospect had opened on this\r\ncountry, as well as on that. The joy had been as great at that event,\r\nand far more universal, in New than in Old England. A new charter had\r\nbeen granted to Massachusetts, which, although it did not confirm to her\r\ninhabitants all their former privileges, yet relieved them from great\r\nevils and embarrassments, and promised future security. More than all,\r\nperhaps, the Revolution in England had done good to the general cause of\r\nliberty and justice. A blow had been struck in favor of the rights and\r\nliberties, not of England alone, but of descendants and kinsmen of\r\nEngland all over the world. Great political truths had been established.\r\nThe champions of liberty had been successful in a fearful and perilous\r\nconflict. Somers, and Cavendish, and Jekyl, and Howard, had triumphed in\r\none of the most noble causes ever undertaken by men. A revolution had\r\nbeen made upon principle. A monarch had been dethroned for violating the\r\noriginal compact between king and people. The rights of the people to\r\npartake in the government, and to limit the monarch by fundamental rules\r\nof government, had been maintained; and however unjust the government of\r\nEngland might afterwards be towards other governments or towards her\r\ncolonies, she had ceased to be governed herself by the arbitrary maxims\r\nof the Stuarts.\r\n\r\nNew England had submitted to the violence of James the Second not longer\r\nthan Old England. Not only was it reserved to Massachusetts, that on her\r\nsoil should be acted the first scene of that great revolutionary drama,\r\nwhich was to take place near a century afterwards, but the English\r\nRevolution itself, as far as the Colonies were concerned, commenced in\r\nBoston. The seizure and imprisonment of Andros, in April, 1689, were\r\nacts of direct and forcible resistance to the authority of James the\r\nSecond. The pulse of liberty beat as high in the extremities as at the\r\nheart. The vigorous feeling of the Colony burst out before it was known\r\nhow the parent country would finally conduct herself. The king's\r\nrepresentative, Sir Edmund Andros, was a prisoner in the castle at\r\nBoston, before it was or could be known that the king himself had ceased\r\nto exercise his full dominion on the English throne.\r\n\r\nBefore it was known here whether the invasion of the Prince of Orange\r\nwould or could prove successful, as soon as it was known that it had\r\nbeen undertaken, the people of Massachusetts, at the imminent hazard of\r\ntheir lives and fortunes, had accomplished the Revolution as far as\r\nrespected themselves. It is probable that, reasoning on general\r\nprinciples and the known attachment of the English people to their\r\nconstitution and liberties, and their deep and fixed dislike of the\r\nking's religion and politics, the people of New England expected a\r\ncatastrophe fatal to the power of the reigning prince. Yet it was\r\nneither certain enough, nor near enough, to come to their aid against\r\nthe authority of the crown, in that crisis which had arrived, and in\r\nwhich they trusted to put themselves, relying on God and their own\r\ncourage. There were spirits in Massachusetts congenial with the spirits\r\nof the distinguished friends of the Revolution in England. There were\r\nthose who were fit to associate with the boldest asserters of civil\r\nliberty; and Mather himself, then in England, was not unworthy to be\r\nranked with those sons of the Church, whose firmness and spirit in\r\nresisting kingly encroachments in matters of religion, entitled them to\r\nthe gratitude of their own and succeeding ages.\r\n\r\nThe second century opened upon New England under circumstances which\r\nevinced that much had already been accomplished, and that still better\r\nprospects and brighter hopes were before her. She had laid, deep and\r\nstrong, the foundations of her society. Her religious principles were\r\nfirm, and her moral habits exemplary. Her public schools had begun to\r\ndiffuse widely the elements of knowledge; and the College, under the\r\nexcellent and acceptable administration of Leverett, had been raised to\r\na high degree of credit and usefulness.\r\n\r\nThe commercial character of the country, notwithstanding all\r\ndiscouragements, had begun to display itself, and _five hundred\r\nvessels_, then belonging to Massachusetts, placed her, in relation to\r\ncommerce, thus early at the head of the Colonies. An author who wrote\r\nvery near the close of the first century says:--\"New England is almost\r\ndeserving that _noble name_, so mightily hath it increased; and from a\r\nsmall settlement at first, is now become a _very populous_ and\r\n_flourishing_ government. The _capital city_, Boston, is a place of\r\n_great wealth and trade_; and by much the largest of any in the English\r\nempire of America; and not exceeded but by few cities, perhaps two or\r\nthree, in all the American world.\"\r\n\r\nBut if our ancestors at the close of the first century could look back\r\nwith joy and even admiration, at the progress of the country, what\r\nemotions must we not feel, when, from the point on which we stand, we\r\nalso look back and run along the events of the century which has now\r\nclosed! The country which then, as we have seen, was thought deserving\r\nof a \"noble name,\"--which then had \"mightily increased,\" and become\r\n\"very populous,\"--what was it, in comparison with what our eyes behold\r\nit? At that period, a very great proportion of its inhabitants lived in\r\nthe eastern section of Massachusetts proper, and in Plymouth Colony. In\r\nConnecticut, there were towns along the coast, some of them respectable,\r\nbut in the interior all was a wilderness beyond Hartford. On Connecticut\r\nRiver, settlements had proceeded as far up as Deerfield, and Fort Dummer\r\nhad been built near where is now the south line of New Hampshire. In New\r\nHampshire no settlement was then begun thirty miles from the mouth of\r\nPiscataqua River, and in what is now Maine the inhabitants were confined\r\nto the coast. The aggregate of the whole population of New England did\r\nnot exceed one hundred and sixty thousand. Its present amount (1820) is\r\nprobably one million seven hundred thousand. Instead of being confined\r\nto its former limits, her population has rolled backward, and filled up\r\nthe spaces included within her actual local boundaries. Not this only,\r\nbut it has overflowed those boundaries, and the waves of emigration have\r\npressed farther and farther toward the West. The Alleghany has not\r\nchecked it; the banks of the Ohio have been covered with it. New England\r\nfarms, houses, villages, and churches spread over and adorn the immense\r\nextent from the Ohio to Lake Erie, and stretch along from the Alleghany\r\nonwards, beyond the Miamis, and toward the Falls of St. Anthony. Two\r\nthousand miles westward from the rock where their fathers landed, may\r\nnow be found the sons of the Pilgrims, cultivating smiling fields,\r\nrearing towns and villages, and cherishing, we trust, the patrimonial\r\nblessings of wise institutions, of liberty, and religion. The world has\r\nseen nothing like this. Regions large enough to be empires, and which,\r\nhalf a century ago, were known only as remote and unexplored\r\nwildernesses, are now teeming with population, and prosperous in all the\r\ngreat concerns of life; in good governments, the means of subsistence,\r\nand social happiness. It may be safely asserted, that there are now more\r\nthan a million of people, descendants of New England ancestry, living,\r\nfree and happy, in regions which scarce sixty years ago were tracts of\r\nunpenetrated forest. Nor do rivers, or mountains, or seas resist the\r\nprogress of industry and enterprise. Erelong, the sons of the Pilgrims\r\nwill be on the shores of the Pacific.[12] The imagination hardly keeps\r\npace with the progress of population, improvement, and civilization.\r\n\r\nIt is now five-and-forty years since the growth and rising glory of\r\nAmerica were portrayed in the English Parliament, with inimitable\r\nbeauty, by the most consummate orator of modern times. Going back\r\nsomewhat more than half a century, and describing our progress as\r\nforeseen from that point by his amiable friend Lord Bathurst, then\r\nliving, he spoke of the wonderful progress which America had made during\r\nthe period of a single human life. There is no American heart, I\r\nimagine, that does not glow, both with conscious, patriotic pride, and\r\nadmiration for one of the happiest efforts of eloquence, so often as the\r\nvision of \"that little speck, scarce visible in the mass of national\r\ninterest, a small seminal principle, rather than a formed body,\" and the\r\nprogress of its astonishing development and growth, are recalled to the\r\nrecollection. But a stronger feeling might be produced, if we were able\r\nto take up this prophetic description where he left it, and, placing\r\nourselves at the point of time in which he was speaking, to set forth\r\nwith equal felicity the subsequent progress of the country. There is yet\r\namong the living a most distinguished and venerable name, a descendant\r\nof the Pilgrims; one who has been attended through life by a great and\r\nfortunate genius; a man illustrious by his own great merits, and favored\r\nof Heaven in the long continuation of his years.[13] The time when the\r\nEnglish orator was thus speaking of America preceded but by a few days\r\nthe actual opening of the revolutionary drama at Lexington. He to whom I\r\nhave alluded, then at the age of forty, was among the most zealous and\r\nable defenders of the violated rights of his country. He seemed already\r\nto have filled a full measure of public service, and attained an\r\nhonorable fame. The moment was full of difficulty and danger, and big\r\nwith events of immeasurable importance. The country was on the very\r\nbrink of a civil war, of which no man could foretell the duration or the\r\nresult. Something more than a courageous hope, or characteristic ardor,\r\nwould have been necessary to impress the glorious prospect on his\r\nbelief, if, at that moment, before the sound of the first shock of\r\nactual war had reached his ears, some attendant spirit had opened to him\r\nthe vision of the future;--if it had said to him, \"The blow is struck,\r\nand America is severed from England for ever!\"--if it had informed him,\r\nthat he himself, during the next annual revolution of the sun, should\r\nput his own hand to the great instrument of independence, and write his\r\nname where all nations should behold it and all time should not efface\r\nit; that erelong he himself should maintain the interests and represent\r\nthe sovereignty of his newborn country in the proudest courts of Europe;\r\nthat he should one day exercise her supreme magistracy; that he should\r\nyet live to behold ten millions of fellow-citizens paying him the homage\r\nof their deepest gratitude and kindest affections; that he should see\r\ndistinguished talent and high public trust resting where his name\r\nrested; that he should even see with his own unclouded eyes the close of\r\nthe second century of New England, who had begun life almost with its\r\ncommencement, and lived through nearly half the whole history of his\r\ncountry; and that on the morning of this auspicious day he should be\r\nfound in the political councils of his native State, revising, by the\r\nlight of experience, that system of government which forty years before\r\nhe had assisted to frame and establish; and, great and happy as he\r\nshould then behold his country, there should be nothing in prospect to\r\ncloud the scene, nothing to check the ardor of that confident and\r\npatriotic hope which should glow in his bosom to the end of his long\r\nprotracted and happy life.\r\n\r\nIt would far exceed the limits of this discourse even to mention the\r\nprincipal events in the civil and political history of New England\r\nduring the century; the more so, as for the last half of the period that\r\nhistory has, most happily, been closely interwoven with the general\r\nhistory of the United States. New England bore an honorable part in the\r\nwars which took place between England and France. The capture of\r\nLouisburg gave her a character for military achievement; and in the war\r\nwhich terminated with the peace of 1763, her exertions on the frontiers\r\nwore of most essential service, as well to the mother country as to all\r\nthe Colonies.\r\n\r\nIn New England the war of the Revolution commenced. I address those who\r\nremember the memorable 19th of April, 1775; who shortly after saw the\r\nburning spires of Charlestown; who beheld the deeds of Prescott, and\r\nheard the voice of Putnam amidst the storm of war, and saw the generous\r\nWarren fall, the first distinguished victim in the cause of liberty. It\r\nwould be superfluous to say, that no portion of the country did more\r\nthan the States of New England to bring the Revolutionary struggle to a\r\nsuccessful issue. It is scarcely less to her credit, that she saw early\r\nthe necessity of a closer union of the States, and gave an efficient and\r\nindispensable aid to the establishment and organization of the Federal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we might safely say, that a new spirit and a new excitement\r\nbegan to exist here about the middle of the last century. To whatever\r\ncauses it may be imputed, there seems then to have commenced a more\r\nrapid improvement. The Colonies had attracted more of the attention of\r\nthe mother country, and some renown in arms had been acquired. Lord\r\nChatham was the first English minister who attached high importance to\r\nthese possessions of the crown, and who foresaw any thing of their\r\nfuture growth and extension. His opinion was, that the great rival of\r\nEngland was chiefly to be feared as a maritime and commercial power, and\r\nto drive her out of North America and deprive her of her West Indian\r\npossessions was a leading object in his policy. He dwelt often on the\r\nfisheries, as nurseries for British seamen, and the colonial trade, as\r\nfurnishing them employment. The war, conducted by him with so much\r\nvigor, terminated in a peace, by which Canada was ceded to England. The\r\neffect of this was immediately visible in the New England Colonies; for,\r\nthe fear of Indian hostilities on the frontiers being now happily\r\nremoved, settlements went on with an activity before that time\r\naltogether unprecedented, and public affairs wore a new and encouraging\r\naspect. Shortly after this fortunate termination of the French war, the\r\ninteresting topics connected with the taxation of America by the British\r\nParliament began to be discussed, and the attention and all the\r\nfaculties of the people drawn towards them. There is perhaps no portion\r\nof our history more full of interest than the period from 1760 to the\r\nactual commencement of the war. The progress of opinion in this period,\r\nthough less known, is not less important than the progress of arms\r\nafterwards. Nothing deserves more consideration than those events and\r\ndiscussions which affected the public sentiment and settled the\r\nRevolution in men's minds, before hostilities openly broke out.\r\n\r\nInternal improvement followed the establishment and prosperous\r\ncommencement of the present government. More has been done for roads,\r\ncanals, and other public works, within the last thirty years, than in\r\nall our former history. In the first of these particulars, few countries\r\nexcel the New England States. The astonishing increase of their\r\nnavigation and trade is known to every one, and now belongs to the\r\nhistory of our national wealth.\r\n\r\nWe may flatter ourselves, too, that literature and taste have not been\r\nstationary, and that some advancement has been made in the elegant, as\r\nwell as in the useful arts.\r\n\r\nThe nature and constitution of society and government in this country\r\nare interesting topics, to which I would devote what remains of the time\r\nallowed to this occasion. Of our system of government the first thing to\r\nbe said is, that it is really and practically a free system. It\r\noriginates entirely with the people, and rests on no other foundation\r\nthan their assent. To judge of its actual operation, it is not enough to\r\nlook merely at the form of its construction. The practical character of\r\ngovernment depends often on a variety of considerations, besides the\r\nabstract frame of its constitutional organization. Among these are the\r\ncondition and tenure of property; the laws regulating its alienation and\r\ndescent; the presence or absence of a military power; an armed or\r\nunarmed yeomanry; the spirit of the age, and the degree of general\r\nintelligence. In these respects it cannot be denied that the\r\ncircumstances of this country are most favorable to the hope of\r\nmaintaining the government of a great nation on principles entirely\r\npopular. In the absence of military power, the nature of government must\r\nessentially depend on the manner in which property is holden and\r\ndistributed. There is a natural influence belonging to property, whether\r\nit exists in many hands or few; and it is on the rights of property that\r\nboth despotism and unrestrained popular violence ordinarily commence\r\ntheir attacks. Our ancestors began their system of government here under\r\na condition of comparative equality in regard to wealth, and their early\r\nlaws were of a nature to favor and continue this equality.\r\n\r\nA republican form of government rests not more on political\r\nconstitutions, than on those laws which regulate the descent and\r\ntransmission of property. Governments like ours could not have been\r\nmaintained, where property was holden according to the principles of the\r\nfeudal system; nor, on the other hand, could the feudal constitution\r\npossibly exist with us. Our New England ancestors brought hither no\r\ngreat capitals from Europe; and if they had, there was nothing\r\nproductive in which they could have been invested. They left behind them\r\nthe whole feudal policy of the other continent. They broke away at once\r\nfrom the system of military service established in the Dark Ages, and\r\nwhich continues, down even to the present time, more or less to affect\r\nthe condition of property all over Europe. They came to a new country.\r\nThere were, as yet, no lands yielding rent, and no tenants rendering\r\nservice. The whole soil was unreclaimed from barbarism. They were\r\nthemselves, either from their original condition, or from the necessity\r\nof their common interest, nearly on a general level in respect to\r\nproperty. Their situation demanded a parcelling out and division of the\r\nlands, and it may be fairly said, that this necessary act _fixed the\r\nfuture frame and form of their government_. The character of their\r\npolitical institutions was determined by the fundamental laws respecting\r\nproperty. The laws rendered estates divisible among sons and daughters.\r\nThe right of primogeniture, at first limited and curtailed, was\r\nafterwards abolished. The property was all freehold. The entailment of\r\nestates, long trusts, and the other processes for fettering and tying up\r\ninheritances, were not applicable to the condition of society, and\r\nseldom made use of. On the contrary, alienation of the land was every\r\nway facilitated, even to the subjecting of it to every species of debt.\r\nThe establishment of public registries, and the simplicity of our forms\r\nof conveyance, have greatly facilitated the change of real estate from\r\none proprietor to another. The consequence of all these causes has been\r\na great subdivision of the soil, and a great equality of condition; the\r\ntrue basis, most certainly, of a popular government. \"If the people,\"\r\nsays Harrington, \"hold three parts in four of the territory, it is plain\r\nthere can neither be any single person nor nobility able to dispute the\r\ngovernment with them; in this case, therefore, _except force be\r\ninterposed_, they govern themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of other nations may teach us how favorable to public\r\nliberty are the division of the soil into small freeholds, and a system\r\nof laws, of which the tendency is, without violence or injustice, to\r\nproduce and to preserve a degree of equality of property. It has been\r\nestimated, if I mistake not, that about the time of Henry the Seventh\r\nfour fifths of the land in England was holden by the great barons and\r\necclesiastics. The effects of a growing commerce soon afterwards began\r\nto break in on this state of things, and before the Revolution, in 1688,\r\na vast change had been wrought. It may be thought probable, that, for\r\nthe last half-century, the process of subdivision in England has been\r\nretarded, if not reversed; that the great weight of taxation has\r\ncompelled many of the lesser freeholders to dispose of their estates,\r\nand to seek employment in the army and navy, in the professions of civil\r\nlife, in commerce, or in the colonies. The effect of this on the British\r\nconstitution cannot but be most unfavorable. A few large estates grow\r\nlarger; but the number of those who have no estates also increases; and\r\nthere may be danger, lest the inequality of property become so great,\r\nthat those who possess it may be dispossessed by force; in other words,\r\nthat the government may be overturned.\r\n\r\nA most interesting experiment of the effect of a subdivision of property\r\non government is now making in France. It is understood, that the law\r\nregulating the transmission of property in that country, now divides it,\r\nreal and personal, among all the children equally, both sons and\r\ndaughters; and that there is, also, a very great restraint on the power\r\nof making dispositions of property by will. It has been supposed, that\r\nthe effects of this might probably be, in time, to break up the soil\r\ninto such small subdivisions, that the proprietors would be too poor to\r\nresist the encroachments of executive power. I think far otherwise. What\r\nis lost in individual wealth will be more than gained in numbers, in\r\nintelligence, and in a sympathy of sentiment. If, indeed, only one or a\r\nfew landholders were to resist the crown, like the barons of England,\r\nthey must, of course, be great and powerful landholders, with multitudes\r\nof retainers, to promise success. But if the proprietors of a given\r\nextent of territory are summoned to resistance, there is no reason to\r\nbelieve that such resistance would be less forcible, or less successful,\r\nbecause the number of such proprietors happened to be great. Each would\r\nperceive his own importance, and his own interest, and would feel that\r\nnatural elevation of character which the consciousness of property\r\ninspires. A common sentiment would unite all, and numbers would not only\r\nadd strength, but excite enthusiasm. It is true, that France possesses\r\na vast military force, under the direction of an hereditary executive\r\ngovernment; and military power, it is possible, may overthrow any\r\ngovernment. It is in vain, however, in this period of the world, to look\r\nfor security against military power to the arm of the great landholders.\r\nThat notion is derived from a state of things long since past; a state\r\nin which a feudal baron, with his retainers, might stand against the\r\nsovereign and his retainers, himself but the greatest baron. But at\r\npresent, what could the richest landholder do, against one regiment of\r\ndisciplined troops? Other securities, therefore, against the prevalence\r\nof military power must be provided. Happily for us, we are not so\r\nsituated as that any purpose of national defence requires, ordinarily\r\nand constantly, such a military force as might seriously endanger our\r\nliberties.\r\n\r\nIn respect, however, to the recent law of succession in France, to which\r\nI have alluded, I would, presumptuously perhaps, hazard a conjecture,\r\nthat, if the government do not change the law, the law in half a century\r\nwill change the government; and that this change will be, not in favor\r\nof the power of the crown, as some European writers have supposed, but\r\nagainst it. Those writers only reason upon what they think correct\r\ngeneral principles, in relation to this subject. They acknowledge a want\r\nof experience. Here we have had that experience; and we know that a\r\nmultitude of small proprietors, acting with intelligence, and that\r\nenthusiasm which a common cause inspires, constitute not only a\r\nformidable, but an invincible power.[14]\r\n\r\nThe true principle of a free and popular government would seem to be, so\r\nto construct it as to give to all, or at least to a very great majority,\r\nan interest in its preservation; to found it, as other things are\r\nfounded, on men's interest. The stability of government demands that\r\nthose who desire its continuance should be more powerful than those who\r\ndesire its dissolution. This power, of course, is not always to be\r\nmeasured by mere numbers. Education, wealth, talents, are all parts and\r\nelements of the general aggregate of power; but numbers, nevertheless,\r\nconstitute ordinarily the most important consideration, unless, indeed,\r\nthere be _a military force_ in the hands of the few, by which they can\r\ncontrol the many. In this country we have actually existing systems of\r\ngovernment, in the maintenance of which, it should seem, a great\r\nmajority, both in numbers and in other means of power and influence,\r\nmust see their interest. But this state of things is not brought about\r\nsolely by written political constitutions, or the mere manner of\r\norganizing the government; but also by the laws which regulate the\r\ndescent and transmission of property. The freest government, if it could\r\nexist, would not be long acceptable, if the tendency of the laws were to\r\ncreate a rapid accumulation of property in few hands, and to render the\r\ngreat mass of the population dependent and penniless. In such a case,\r\nthe popular power would be likely to break in upon the rights of\r\nproperty, or else the influence of property to limit and control the\r\nexercise of popular power. Universal suffrage, for example, could not\r\nlong exist in a community where there was great inequality of property.\r\nThe holders of estates would be obliged, in such case, in some way to\r\nrestrain the right of suffrage, or else such right of suffrage would,\r\nbefore long, divide the property. In the nature of things, those who\r\nhave not property, and see their neighbors possess much more than they\r\nthink them to need, cannot be favorable to laws made for the protection\r\nof property. When this class becomes numerous, it grows clamorous. It\r\nlooks on property as its prey and plunder, and is naturally ready, at\r\nall times, for violence and revolution.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, to be the part of political wisdom to found\r\ngovernment on property; and to establish such distribution of property,\r\nby the laws which regulate its transmission and alienation, as to\r\ninterest the great majority of society in the support of the government.\r\nThis is, I imagine, the true theory and the actual practice of our\r\nrepublican institutions. With property divided as we have it, no other\r\ngovernment than that of a republic could be maintained, even were we\r\nfoolish enough to desire it. There is reason, therefore, to expect a\r\nlong continuance of our system. Party and passion, doubtless, may\r\nprevail at times, and much temporary mischief be done. Even modes and\r\nforms may be changed, and perhaps for the worse. But a great revolution\r\nin regard to property must take place, before our governments can be\r\nmoved from their republican basis, unless they be violently struck off\r\nby military power. The people possess the property, more emphatically\r\nthan it could ever be said of the people of any other country, and they\r\ncan have no interest to overturn a government which protects that\r\nproperty by equal laws.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed, that this state of things possesses too strong\r\ntendencies towards the production of a dead and uninteresting level in\r\nsociety. Such tendencies are sufficiently counteracted by the infinite\r\ndiversities in the characters and fortunes of individuals. Talent,\r\nactivity, industry, and enterprise tend at all times to produce\r\ninequality and distinction; and there is room still for the accumulation\r\nof wealth, with its great advantages, to all reasonable and useful\r\nextent. It has been often urged against the state of society in America,\r\nthat it furnishes no class of men of fortune and leisure. This may be\r\npartly true, but it is not entirely so, and the evil, if it be one,\r\nwould affect rather the progress of taste and literature, than the\r\ngeneral prosperity of the people. But the promotion of taste and\r\nliterature cannot be primary objects of political institutions; and if\r\nthey could, it might be doubted whether, in the long course of things,\r\nas much is not gained by a wide diffusion of general knowledge, as is\r\nlost by diminishing the number of those who are enabled by fortune and\r\nleisure to devote themselves exclusively to scientific and literary\r\npursuits. However this may be, it is to be considered that it is the\r\nspirit of our system to be equal and general, and if there be particular\r\ndisadvantages incident to this, they are far more than counterbalanced\r\nby the benefits which weigh against them. The important concerns of\r\nsociety are generally conducted, in all countries, by the men of\r\nbusiness and practical ability; and even in matters of taste and\r\nliterature, the advantages of mere leisure are liable to be overrated.\r\nIf there exist adequate means of education and a love of letters be\r\nexcited, that love will find its way to the object of its desire,\r\nthrough the crowd and pressure of the most busy society.\r\n\r\nConnected with this division of property, and the consequent\r\nparticipation of the great mass of people in its possession and\r\nenjoyments, is the system of representation, which is admirably\r\naccommodated to our condition, better understood among us, and more\r\nfamiliarly and extensively practised, in the higher and in the lower\r\ndepartments of government, than it has been by any other people. Great\r\nfacility has been given to this in New England by the early division of\r\nthe country into townships or small districts, in which all concerns of\r\nlocal police are regulated, and in which representatives to the\r\nlegislature are elected. Nothing can exceed the utility of these little\r\nbodies. They are so many councils or parliaments, in which common\r\ninterests are discussed, and useful knowledge acquired and communicated.\r\n\r\nThe division of governments into departments, and the division, again,\r\nof the legislative department into two chambers, are essential\r\nprovisions in our system. This last, although not new in itself, yet\r\nseems to be new in its application to governments wholly popular. The\r\nGrecian republics, it is plain, knew nothing of it; and in Rome, the\r\ncheck and balance of legislative power, such as it was, lay between the\r\npeople and the senate. Indeed, few things are more difficult than to\r\nascertain accurately the true nature and construction of the Roman\r\ncommonwealth. The relative power of the senate and the people, of the\r\nconsuls and the tribunes, appears not to have been at all times the\r\nsame, nor at any time accurately defined or strictly observed. Cicero,\r\nindeed, describes to us an admirable arrangement of political power, and\r\na balance of the constitution, in that beautiful passage, in which he\r\ncompares the democracies of Greece with the Roman commonwealth. \"O morem\r\npreclarum, disciplinamque, quam a majoribus accepimus, si quidem\r\nteneremus! sed nescio quo pacto jam de manibus elabitur. Nullam enim\r\nilli nostri sapientissimi et sanctissimi viri vim concionis esse\r\nvoluerunt, quae scisseret plebs, aut quae populus juberet; summota\r\nconcione, distributis partibus, tributim et centuriatim descriptis\r\nordinibus, classibus, aetatibus, auditis auctoribus, re multos dies\r\npromulgata et cognita, juberi vetarique voluerunt. Graecorum autem totae\r\nrespublicae sedentis concionis temeritate administrantur.\"[15]\r\n\r\nBut at what time this wise system existed in this perfection at Rome, no\r\nproofs remain to show. Her constitution, originally framed for a\r\nmonarchy, never seemed to be adjusted in its several parts after the\r\nexpulsion of the kings. Liberty there was, but it was a disputatious, an\r\nuncertain, an ill-secured liberty. The patrician and plebeian orders,\r\ninstead of being matched and joined, each in its just place and\r\nproportion, to sustain the fabric of the state, were rather like hostile\r\npowers, in perpetual conflict. With us, an attempt has been made, and so\r\nfar not without success, to divide representation into chambers, and, by\r\ndifference of age, character, qualification, or mode of election, to\r\nestablish salutary checks, in governments altogether elective.\r\n\r\nHaving detained you so long with these observations, I must yet advert\r\nto another most interesting topic,--the Free Schools. In this\r\nparticular, New England may be allowed to claim, I think, a merit of a\r\npeculiar character. She early adopted, and has constantly maintained the\r\nprinciple, that it is the undoubted right and the bounden duty of\r\ngovernment to provide for the instruction of all youth. That which is\r\nelsewhere left to chance or to charity, we secure by law.[16] For the\r\npurpose of public instruction, we hold every man subject to taxation in\r\nproportion to his property, and we look not to the question, whether he\r\nhimself have, or have not, children to be benefited by the education for\r\nwhich he pays. We regard it as a wise and liberal system of police, by\r\nwhich property, and life, and the peace of society are secured. We seek\r\nto prevent in some measure the extension of the penal code, by inspiring\r\na salutary and conservative principle of virtue and of knowledge in an\r\nearly age. We strive to excite a feeling of respectability, and a sense\r\nof character, by enlarging the capacity and increasing the sphere of\r\nintellectual enjoyment. By general instruction, we seek, as far as\r\npossible, to purify the whole moral atmosphere; to keep good sentiments\r\nuppermost, and to turn the strong current of feeling and opinion, as\r\nwell as the censures of the law and the denunciations of religion,\r\nagainst immorality and crime. We hope for a security beyond the law, and\r\nabove the law, in the prevalence of an enlightened and well-principled\r\nmoral sentiment. We hope to continue and prolong the time, when, in the\r\nvillages and farm-houses of New England, there may be undisturbed sleep\r\nwithin unbarred doors. And knowing that our government rests directly on\r\nthe public will, in order that we may preserve it we endeavor to give a\r\nsafe and proper direction to that public will. We do not, indeed,\r\nexpect all men to be philosophers or statesmen; but we confidently\r\ntrust, and our expectation of the duration of our system of government\r\nrests on that trust, that, by the diffusion of general knowledge and\r\ngood and virtuous sentiments, the political fabric may be secure, as\r\nwell against open violence and overthrow, as against the slow, but sure,\r\nundermining of licentiousness.\r\n\r\nWe know that, at the present time, an attempt is making in the English\r\nParliament to provide by law for the education of the poor, and that a\r\ngentleman of distinguished character (Mr. Brougham) has taken the lead\r\nin presenting a plan to government for carrying that purpose into\r\neffect. And yet, although the representatives of the three kingdoms\r\nlistened to him with astonishment as well as delight, we hear no\r\nprinciples with which we ourselves have not been familiar from youth; we\r\nsee nothing in the plan but an approach towards that system which has\r\nbeen established in New England for more than a century and a half. It\r\nis said that in England not more than _one child in fifteen_ possesses\r\nthe means of being taught to read and write; in Wales, _one in twenty_;\r\nin France, until lately, when some improvement was made, not more than\r\n_one in thirty-five_. Now, it is hardly too strong to say, that in New\r\nEngland _every child possesses_ such means. It would be difficult to\r\nfind an instance to the contrary, unless where it should be owing to the\r\nnegligence of the parent; and, in truth, the means are actually used and\r\nenjoyed by nearly every one. A youth of fifteen, of either sex, who\r\ncannot both read and write, is very seldom to be found. Who can make\r\nthis comparison, or contemplate this spectacle, without delight and a\r\nfeeling of just pride? Does any history show property more beneficently\r\napplied? Did any government ever subject the property of those who have\r\nestates to a burden, for a purpose more favorable to the poor, or more\r\nuseful to the whole community?\r\n\r\nA conviction of the importance of public instruction was one of the\r\nearliest sentiments of our ancestors. No lawgiver of ancient or modern\r\ntimes has expressed more just opinions, or adopted wiser measures, than\r\nthe early records of the Colony of Plymouth show to have prevailed here.\r\nAssembled on this very spot, a hundred and fifty-three years ago, the\r\nlegislature of this Colony declared, \"Forasmuch as the maintenance of\r\ngood literature doth much tend to the advancement of the weal and\r\nflourishing state of societies and republics, this Court doth therefore\r\norder, that in whatever township in this government, consisting of fifty\r\nfamilies or upwards, any meet man shall be obtained to teach a grammar\r\nschool, such township shall allow at least twelve pounds, to be raised\r\nby rate on all the inhabitants.\"\r\n\r\nHaving provided that all youth should be instructed in the elements of\r\nlearning by the institution of free schools, our ancestors had yet\r\nanother duty to perform. Men were to be educated for the professions and\r\nthe public. For this purpose they founded the University, and with\r\nincredible zeal and perseverance they cherished and supported it,\r\nthrough all trials and discouragements.[17] On the subject of the\r\nUniversity, it is not possible for a son of New England to think without\r\npleasure, or to speak without emotion. Nothing confers more honor on the\r\nState where it is established, or more utility on the country at large.\r\nA respectable university is an establishment which must be the work of\r\ntime. If pecuniary means were not wanting, no new institution could\r\npossess character and respectability at once. We owe deep obligation to\r\nour ancestors, who began, almost on the moment of their arrival, the\r\nwork of building up this institution.\r\n\r\nAlthough established in a different government, the Colony of Plymouth\r\nmanifested warm friendship for Harvard College. At an early period, its\r\ngovernment took measures to promote a general subscription throughout\r\nall the towns in this Colony, in aid of its small funds. Other colleges\r\nwere subsequently founded and endowed, in other places, as the ability\r\nof the people allowed; and we may flatter ourselves, that the means of\r\neducation at present enjoyed in New England are not only adequate to the\r\ndiffusion of the elements of knowledge among all classes, but sufficient\r\nalso for respectable attainments in literature and the sciences.\r\n\r\nLastly, our ancestors established their system of government on morality\r\nand religious sentiment. Moral habits, they believed, cannot safely be\r\ntrusted on any other foundation than religious principle, nor any\r\ngovernment be secure which is not supported by moral habits. Living\r\nunder the heavenly light of revelation, they hoped to find all the\r\nsocial dispositions, all the duties which men owe to each other and to\r\nsociety, enforced and performed. Whatever makes men good Christians,\r\nmakes them good citizens. Our fathers came here to enjoy their religion\r\nfree and unmolested; and, at the end of two centuries, there is nothing\r\nupon which we can pronounce more confidently, nothing of which we can\r\nexpress a more deep and earnest conviction, than of the inestimable\r\nimportance of that religion to man, both in regard to this life and that\r\nwhich is to come.\r\n\r\nIf the blessings of our political and social condition have not been too\r\nhighly estimated, we cannot well overrate the responsibility and duty\r\nwhich they impose upon us. We hold these institutions of government,\r\nreligion, and learning, to be transmitted, as well as enjoyed. We are in\r\nthe line of conveyance, through which whatever has been obtained by the\r\nspirit and efforts of our ancestors is to be communicated to our\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nWe are bound to maintain public liberty, and, by the example of our own\r\nsystems, to convince the world that order and law, religion and\r\nmorality, the rights of conscience, the rights of persons, and the\r\nrights of property, may all be preserved and secured, in the most\r\nperfect manner, by a government entirely and purely elective. If we fail\r\nin this, our disaster will be signal, and will furnish an argument,\r\nstronger than has yet been found, in support of those opinions which\r\nmaintain that government can rest safely on nothing but power and\r\ncoercion. As far as experience may show errors in our establishments, we\r\nare bound to correct them; and if any practices exist contrary to the\r\nprinciples of justice and humanity within the reach of our laws or our\r\ninfluence, we are inexcusable if we do not exert ourselves to restrain\r\nand abolish them.\r\n\r\nI deem it my duty on this occasion to suggest, that the land is not yet\r\nwholly free from the contamination of a traffic, at which every feeling\r\nof humanity must for ever revolt,--I mean the African slave-trade.[18]\r\nNeither public sentiment, nor the law, has hitherto been able entirely\r\nto put an end to this odious and abominable trade. At the moment when\r\nGod in his mercy has blessed the Christian world with a universal peace,\r\nthere is reason to fear, that, to the disgrace of the Christian name and\r\ncharacter, new efforts are making for the extension of this trade by\r\nsubjects and citizens of Christian states, in whose hearts there dwell\r\nno sentiments of humanity or of justice, and over whom neither the fear\r\nof God nor the fear of man exercises a control. In the sight of our law,\r\nthe African slave-trader is a pirate and a felon; and in the sight of\r\nHeaven, an offender far beyond the ordinary depth of human guilt. There\r\nis no brighter page of our history, than that which records the measures\r\nwhich have been adopted by the government at an early day, and at\r\ndifferent times since, for the suppression of this traffic; and I would\r\ncall on all the true sons of New England to co-operate with the laws of\r\nman, and the justice of Heaven. If there be, within the extent of our\r\nknowledge or influence, any participation in this traffic, let us\r\npledge ourselves here, upon the rock of Plymouth, to extirpate and\r\ndestroy it. It is not fit that the land of the Pilgrims should bear the\r\nshame longer. I hear the sound of the hammer, I see the smoke of the\r\nfurnaces where manacles and fetters are still forged for human limbs. I\r\nsee the visages of those who by stealth and at midnight labor in this\r\nwork of hell, foul and dark, as may become the artificers of such\r\ninstruments of misery and torture. Let that spot be purified, or let it\r\ncease to be of New England. Let it be purified, or let it be set aside\r\nfrom the Christian world; let it be put out of the circle of human\r\nsympathies and human regards, and let civilized man henceforth have no\r\ncommunion with it.\r\n\r\nI would invoke those who fill the seats of justice, and all who minister\r\nat her altar, that they execute the wholesome and necessary severity of\r\nthe law. I invoke the ministers of our religion, that they proclaim its\r\ndenunciation of these crimes, and add its solemn sanctions to the\r\nauthority of human laws. If the pulpit be silent whenever or wherever\r\nthere may be a sinner bloody with this guilt within the hearing of its\r\nvoice, the pulpit is false to its trust. I call on the fair merchant,\r\nwho has reaped his harvest upon the seas, that he assist in scourging\r\nfrom those seas the worst pirates that ever infested them. That ocean,\r\nwhich seems to wave with a gentle magnificence to waft the burden of an\r\nhonest commerce, and to roll along its treasures with a conscious\r\npride,--that ocean, which hardy industry regards, even when the winds\r\nhave ruffled its surface, as a field of grateful toil,--what is it to\r\nthe victim of this oppression, when he is brought to its shores, and\r\nlooks forth upon it, for the first time, loaded with chains, and\r\nbleeding with stripes? What is it to him but a wide-spread prospect of\r\nsuffering, anguish, and death? Nor do the skies smile longer, nor is the\r\nair longer fragrant to him. The sun is cast down from heaven. An inhuman\r\nand accursed traffic has cut him off in his manhood, or in his youth,\r\nfrom every enjoyment belonging to his being, and every blessing which\r\nhis Creator intended for him.\r\n\r\nThe Christian communities send forth their emissaries of religion and\r\nletters, who stop, here and there, along the coast of the vast continent\r\nof Africa, and with painful and tedious efforts make some almost\r\nimperceptible progress in the communication of knowledge, and in the\r\ngeneral improvement of the natives who are immediately about them. Not\r\nthus slow and imperceptible is the transmission of the vices and bad\r\npassions which the subjects of Christian states carry to the land. The\r\nslave-trade having touched the coast, its influence and its evils\r\nspread, like a pestilence, over the whole continent, making savage wars\r\nmore savage and more frequent, and adding new and fierce passions to the\r\ncontests of barbarians.\r\n\r\nI pursue this topic no further, except again to say, that all\r\nChristendom, being now blessed with peace, is bound by every thing which\r\nbelongs to its character, and to the character of the present age, to\r\nput a stop to this inhuman and disgraceful traffic.\r\n\r\nWe are bound, not only to maintain the general principles of public\r\nliberty, but to support also those existing forms of government which\r\nhave so well secured its enjoyment, and so highly promoted the public\r\nprosperity. It is now more than thirty years that these States have been\r\nunited under the Federal Constitution, and whatever fortune may await\r\nthem hereafter, it is impossible that this period of their history\r\nshould not be regarded as distinguished by signal prosperity and\r\nsuccess. They must be sanguine indeed, who can hope for benefit from\r\nchange. Whatever division of the public judgment may have existed in\r\nrelation to particular measures of the government, all must agree, one\r\nshould think, in the opinion, that in its general course it has been\r\neminently productive of public happiness. Its most ardent friends could\r\nnot well have hoped from it more than it has accomplished; and those who\r\ndisbelieved or doubted ought to feel less concern about predictions\r\nwhich the event has not verified, than pleasure in the good which has\r\nbeen obtained. Whoever shall hereafter write this part of our history,\r\nalthough he may see occasional errors or defects, will be able to record\r\nno great failure in the ends and objects of government. Still less will\r\nhe be able to record any series of lawless and despotic acts, or any\r\nsuccessful usurpation. His page will contain no exhibition of provinces\r\ndepopulated, of civil authority habitually trampled down by military\r\npower, or of a community crushed by the burden of taxation. He will\r\nspeak, rather, of public liberty protected, and public happiness\r\nadvanced; of increased revenue, and population augmented beyond all\r\nexample; of the growth of commerce, manufactures, and the arts; and of\r\nthat happy condition, in which the restraint and coercion of government\r\nare almost invisible and imperceptible, and its influence felt only in\r\nthe benefits which it confers. We can entertain no better wish for our\r\ncountry, than that this government may be preserved; nor have a clearer\r\nduty than to maintain and support it in the full exercise of all its\r\njust constitutional powers.\r\n\r\nThe cause of science and literature also imposes upon us an important\r\nand delicate trust. The wealth and population of the country are now so\r\nfar advanced, as to authorize the expectation of a correct literature\r\nand a well formed taste, as well as respectable progress in the abstruse\r\nsciences. The country has risen from a state of colonial subjection; it\r\nhas established an independent government, and is now in the undisturbed\r\nenjoyment of peace and political security. The elements of knowledge are\r\nuniversally diffused, and the reading portion of the community is large.\r\nLet us hope that the present may be an auspicious era of literature. If,\r\nalmost on the day of their landing, our ancestors founded schools and\r\nendowed colleges, what obligations do not rest upon us, living under\r\ncircumstances so much more favorable both for providing and for using\r\nthe means of education? Literature becomes free institutions. It is the\r\ngraceful ornament of civil liberty, and a happy restraint on the\r\nasperities which political controversies sometimes occasion. Just taste\r\nis not only an embellishment of society, but it rises almost to the rank\r\nof the virtues, and diffuses positive good throughout the whole extent\r\nof its influence. There is a connection between right feeling and right\r\nprinciples, and truth in taste is allied with truth in morality. With\r\nnothing in our past history to discourage us, and with something in our\r\npresent condition and prospects to animate us, let us hope, that, as it\r\nis our fortune to live in an age when we may behold a wonderful\r\nadvancement of the country in all its other great interests, we may see\r\nalso equal progress and success attend the cause of letters.\r\n\r\nFinally, let us not forget the religious character of our origin. Our\r\nfathers were brought hither by their high veneration for the Christian\r\nreligion. They journeyed by its light, and labored in its hope. They\r\nsought to incorporate its principles with the elements of their society,\r\nand to diffuse its influence through all their institutions, civil,\r\npolitical, or literary. Let us cherish these sentiments, and extend this\r\ninfluence still more widely; in the full conviction, that that is the\r\nhappiest society which partakes in the highest degree of the mild and\r\npeaceful spirit of Christianity.\r\n\r\nThe hours of this day are rapidly flying, and this occasion will soon be\r\npassed. Neither we nor our children can expect to behold its return.\r\nThey are in the distant regions of futurity, they exist only in the\r\nall-creating power of God, who shall stand here a hundred years hence,\r\nto trace, through us, their descent from the Pilgrims, and to survey, as\r\nwe have now surveyed, the progress of their country, during the lapse of\r\na century. We would anticipate their concurrence with us in our\r\nsentiments of deep regard for our common ancestors. We would anticipate\r\nand partake the pleasure with which they will then recount the steps of\r\nNew England's advancement. On the morning of that day, although it will\r\nnot disturb us in our repose, the voice of acclamation and gratitude,\r\ncommencing on the Rock of Plymouth, shall be transmitted through\r\nmillions of the sons of the Pilgrims, till it lose itself in the murmurs\r\nof the Pacific seas.\r\n\r\nWe would leave for the consideration of those who shall then occupy our\r\nplaces, some proof that we hold the blessings transmitted from our\r\nfathers in just estimation; some proof of our attachment to the cause of\r\ngood government, and of civil and religious liberty; some proof of a\r\nsincere and ardent desire to promote every thing which may enlarge the\r\nunderstandings and improve the hearts of men. And when, from the long\r\ndistance of a hundred years, they shall look back upon us, they shall\r\nknow, at least, that we possessed affections, which, running backward\r\nand warming with gratitude for what our ancestors have done for our\r\nhappiness, run forward also to our posterity, and meet them with cordial\r\nsalutation, ere yet they have arrived on the shore of being.\r\n\r\nAdvance, then, ye future generations! We would hail you, as you rise in\r\nyour long succession, to fill the places which we now fill, and to taste\r\nthe blessings of existence where we are passing, and soon shall have\r\npassed, our own human duration. We bid you welcome to this pleasant land\r\nof the fathers. We bid you welcome to the healthful skies and the\r\nverdant fields of New England. We greet your accession to the great\r\ninheritance which we have enjoyed. We welcome you to the blessings of\r\ngood government and religious liberty. We welcome you to the treasures\r\nof science and the delights of learning. We welcome you to the\r\ntranscendent sweets of domestic life, to the happiness of kindred, and\r\nparents, and children. We welcome you to the immeasurable blessings of\r\nrational existence, the immortal hope of Christianity, and the light of\r\neverlasting truth!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\nNOTE A.--PAGE 27.\r\n\r\nThe allusion in the Discourse is to the large historical painting of the\r\nLanding of the Pilgrims at Plymouth, executed by Henry Sargent, Esq., of\r\nBoston, and, with great liberality, presented by him to the Pilgrim\r\nSociety. It appeared in their hall (of which it forms the chief\r\nornament) for the first time at the celebration of 1824. It represents\r\nthe principal personages of the company at the moment of landing, with\r\nthe Indian Samoset, who approaches them with a friendly welcome. A very\r\ncompetent judge, himself a distinguished artist, the late venerable\r\nColonel Trumbull, has pronounced that this painting has great merit. An\r\ninteresting account of it will be found in Dr. Thacher's History of\r\nPlymouth, pp. 249 and 257.\r\n\r\nAn historical painting, by Robert N. Weir, Esq., of the largest size,\r\nrepresenting the embarkation of the Pilgrims from Delft-Haven, in\r\nHolland, and executed by order of Congress, fills one of the panels of\r\nthe Rotunda of the Capitol at Washington. The moment chosen by the\r\nartist for the action of the picture is that in which the venerable\r\npastor Robinson, with tears, and benedictions, and prayers to Heaven,\r\ndismisses the beloved members of his little flock to the perils and the\r\nhopes of their great enterprise. The characters of the personages\r\nintroduced are indicated with discrimination and power, and the\r\naccessories of the work marked with much taste and skill. It is a\r\npainting of distinguished historical interest and of great artistic\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nThe \"Landing of the Pilgrims\" has also been made the subject of a very\r\ninteresting painting by Mr. Flagg, intended to represent the deep\r\nreligious feeling which so strikingly characterized the first settlers\r\nof New England. With this object in view, the central figure is that of\r\nElder Brewster. It is a picture of cabinet size, and is in possession of\r\na gentleman of New Haven, descended from Elder Brewster, and of that\r\nname.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE B.--PAGE 45.\r\n\r\nAs the opinion of contemporaneous thinkers on this important subject\r\ncannot fail to interest the general reader, it is deemed proper to\r\ninsert here the following extract from a letter, written in 1849, to\r\nshow how powerfully the truths uttered in 1820, in the spirit of\r\nprophecy, as it were, impressed themselves upon certain minds, and how\r\nclosely the verification of the prediction has been watched.\r\n\r\n     \"I do not remember any political prophecy, founded on the spirit of\r\n     a wide and far-reaching statesmanship, that has been so remarkably\r\n     fulfilled as the one made by Mr. Webster, in his Discourse\r\n     delivered at Plymouth in 1820, on the effect which the laws of\r\n     succession to property in France, then in operation, would be\r\n     likely to produce on the forms and working of the French\r\n     government. But to understand what he said, and what he foresaw, I\r\n     must explain a little what had been the course of legislation in\r\n     France on which his predictions were founded.\r\n\r\n     \"Before the Revolution of 1789, there had been a great accumulation\r\n     of the landed property of the country, and, indeed, of all its\r\n     property,--by means of laws of entail, _majorats_, and other legal\r\n     contrivances,--in the hands of the privileged classes; chiefly in\r\n     those of the nobility and the clergy. The injury and injustice done\r\n     by long continued legislation in this direction were obviously\r\n     great; and it was not, perhaps, unnatural, that the opposite course\r\n     to that which had brought on the mischief should be deemed the best\r\n     one to cure it. At any rate, such was the course taken.\r\n\r\n     \"In 1791 a law was passed, preventing any man from having any\r\n     interest beyond the period of his own life in any of his property,\r\n     real, personal, or mixed, and distributing all his possessions for\r\n     him, immediately after his death, among his children, in equal\r\n     shares, or if he left no children, then among his next of kin, on\r\n     the same principle. This law, with a slight modification, made\r\n     under the influence of Robespierre, was in force till 1800. But the\r\n     period was entirely revolutionary, and probably quite as much\r\n     property changed hands from violence and the consequences of\r\n     violence, during the nine years it continued, as was transmitted by\r\n     the laws that directly controlled its succession.\r\n\r\n     \"With the coming in of Bonaparte, however, there was established a\r\n     new order of things, which has continued, with little modification,\r\n     ever since, and has had its full share in working out the great\r\n     changes in French society which we now witness. A few experiments\r\n     were first made, and then the great Civil Code, often called the\r\n     _Code Napoleon_, was adopted. This was in 1804. By this remarkable\r\n     code, which is still in force, a man, if he has but one child, can\r\n     give away by his last will, as he pleases, half of his\r\n     property,--the law insuring the other half to the child; if he has\r\n     two children, then he can so give away only one third,--the law\r\n     requiring the other two thirds to be given equally to the two\r\n     children; if three, then only one fourth under similar conditions;\r\n     but if he has a greater number, it restricts the rights of the\r\n     parent more and more, and makes it more and more difficult for him\r\n     to distribute his property according to his own judgment; the\r\n     restrictions embarrassing him even in his lifetime.\r\n\r\n     \"The consequences of such laws are, from their nature, very slowly\r\n     developed. When Mr. Webster spoke in 1820, the French code had been\r\n     in operation sixteen years, and similar principles had prevailed\r\n     for nearly a generation. But still its wide results were not even\r\n     suspected. Those who had treated the subject at all supposed that\r\n     the tendency was to break up the great estates in France, and make\r\n     the larger number of the holders of small estates more accessible\r\n     to the influence of the government, then a limited monarchy, and so\r\n     render it stronger and more despotic.\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Webster held a different opinion. He said, 'In respect,\r\n     however, to the recent law of succession in France, to which I have\r\n     alluded, _I would, presumptuously perhaps, hazard a conjecture,\r\n     that, if the government do not change the law, the law in half a\r\n     century will change the government; and that this change will be,\r\n     not in favor of the power of the crown, as some European writers\r\n     have supposed, but against it_. Those writers only reason upon what\r\n     they think correct general principles, in relation to this subject.\r\n     They acknowledge a want of experience. Here we have had that\r\n     experience; and we know that a multitude of small proprietors,\r\n     acting with intelligence, and that enthusiasm which a common cause\r\n     inspires, constitute not only a formidable, but an invincible\r\n     power.'\r\n\r\n     \"In less than six years after Mr. Webster uttered this remarkable\r\n     prediction, the king of France himself, at the opening of the\r\n     Legislative Chambers, thus strangely echoed it:--'Legislation ought\r\n     to provide, by successive improvements, for all the wants of\r\n     society. The progressive partitioning of landed estates,\r\n     essentially contrary to the spirit of a monarchical government,\r\n     would enfeeble the guaranties which the charter has given to my\r\n     throne and to my subjects. Measures will be proposed to you,\r\n     gentlemen, to establish the consistency which ought to exist\r\n     between the political law and the civil law, and to preserve the\r\n     patrimony of families, without restricting the liberty of disposing\r\n     of one's property. The preservation of families is connected with,\r\n     and affords a guaranty to, political stability, which is the first\r\n     want of states, and which is especially that of France, after so\r\n     many vicissitudes.'\r\n\r\n     \"Still, the results to which such subdivision and comminution of\r\n     property tended were not foreseen even in France. The Revolution of\r\n     1830 came, and revealed a part of them; for that revolution was\r\n     made by the influence of men possessing very moderate estates, who\r\n     believed that the guaranties of a government like that of the elder\r\n     branch of the Bourbons were not sufficient for their safety. But\r\n     when the revolution was made, and the younger branch of the\r\n     Bourbons reigned instead of the elder, the laws for the descent of\r\n     property continued to be the same, and the subdivision went on as\r\n     if it were an admitted benefit to society.\r\n\r\n     \"In consequence of this, in 1844 it was found that there were in\r\n     France at least five millions and a half of families, or about\r\n     twenty-seven millions of souls, who were proprietary families, and\r\n     that of these about four millions of families had each less than\r\n     nine English acres to the family on the average. Of course, a vast\r\n     majority of these twenty-seven millions of persons, though they\r\n     might be interested in some small portion of the soil, were really\r\n     poor, and multitudes of them were dependent.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, therefore, the results began to appear in a practical form.\r\n     One third of all the rental of France was discovered to be\r\n     absolutely mortgaged, and another third was swallowed up by other\r\n     encumbrances, leaving but one third free for the use and benefit of\r\n     its owners. In other words, a great proportion of the people of\r\n     France were embarrassed and poor, and a great proportion of the\r\n     remainder were fast becoming so.\r\n\r\n     \"Such a state of things produced, of course, a wide-spread social\r\n     uneasiness. Part of this uneasiness was directed against the\r\n     existing government; another and more formidable portion was\r\n     directed against _all_ government, and against the very institution\r\n     of property. The convulsion of 1848 followed; France is still\r\n     unsettled; and Mr. Webster's prophecy seems still to be in the\r\n     course of a portentous fulfilment.\"\r\n\r\nIn the London Quarterly Review for 1846 there is an interesting\r\ndiscussion on so much of the matter as relates to the subdivision of\r\nreal estate for agricultural purposes in France, as far as it had then\r\nadvanced, and from which many of the facts here alluded to are taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: An interesting account of the Rock may be found in Dr.\r\nThacher's History of the Town of Plymouth, pp. 29, 198, 199.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Note A, at the end of the Discourse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: For notices of Carver, Bradford, Standish, Brewster, and\r\nAllerton, see Young's Chronicles of Plymouth and Massachusetts; Morton's\r\nMemorial, p. 126; Belknap's American Biography, Vol. II.; Hutchinson's\r\nHistory, Vol. II., App., pp. 456 _et seq._; Collections of the\r\nMassachusetts Historical Society; Winthrop's Journal; and Thacher's\r\nHistory.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: For the original name of what is now Plymouth, see Lives of\r\nAmerican Governors, p. 38, note, a work prepared with great care by J.B.\r\nMoore, Esq.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The twenty-first is now acknowledged to be the true\r\nanniversary.

WEBSTER'S\r\n\"ARGUMENT ON THE IMPEACHMENT OF JAMES PRESCOTT,\" APRIL 24TH, 1821.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President, the case is closed! The fate of the respondent is in your\r\nhands. It is for you now to say, whether, from the law and the facts as\r\nthey have appeared before you, you will proceed to disgrace and\r\ndisfranchise him. If your duty calls on you to convict him, let justice\r\nbe done, and convict him; but, I adjure you, let it be a clear,\r\nundoubted case. Let it be so for his sake, for you are robbing him of\r\nthat for which, with all your high powers, you can yield him no\r\ncompensation; let it be so for your own sakes, for the responsibility of\r\nthis day's judgment is one which you must carry with you through life.\r\nFor myself, I am willing here to relinquish the character of an\r\nadvocate, and to express opinions by which I am prepared to be bound as\r\na citizen and a man. And I say upon my honor and conscience, that I see\r\nnot how, with the law and constitution for your guides, you can\r\npronounce the respondent guilty. I declare that I have seen no case of\r\nwilful and corrupt official misconduct, set forth according to the\r\nrequisitions of the constitution, and proved according to the common\r\nrules of evidence. I see many things imprudent and ill-judged; many\r\nthings that I could wish had been otherwise; but corruption and crime I\r\ndo not see.\r\n\r\nSir, the prejudices of the day will soon be forgotten; the passions, if\r\nany there be, which have excited or favored this prosecution will\r\nsubside; but the consequence of the judgment you are about to render\r\nwill outlive both them and you. The respondent is now brought, a single,\r\nunprotected individual, to this formidable bar of judgment, to stand\r\nagainst the power and authority of the State. I know you can crush him,\r\nas he stands before you, and clothed as you are with the sovereignty of\r\nthe State. You have the power \"to change his countenance and to send him\r\naway.\" Nor do I remind you, that your judgment is to be rejudged by the\r\ncommunity; and, as you have summoned him for trial to this high\r\ntribunal, that you are soon to descend yourselves from these seats of\r\njustice, and stand before the higher tribunal of the world. I would not\r\nfail so much in respect to this honorable court as to hint that it could\r\npronounce a sentence which the community will reverse. No, Sir, it is\r\nnot the world's revision which I would call on you to regard; but that\r\nof your own consciences, when years have gone by and you shall look back\r\non the sentence you are about to render. If you send away the\r\nrespondent, condemned and sentenced, from your bar, you are yet to meet\r\nhim in the world on which you cast him out. You will be called to behold\r\nhim a disgrace to his family, a sorrow and a shame to his children, a\r\nliving fountain of grief and agony to himself.\r\n\r\nIf you shall then be able to behold him only as an unjust judge, whom\r\nvengeance has overtaken and justice has blasted, you will be able to\r\nlook upon him, not without pity, but yet without remorse. But if, on the\r\nother hand, you shall see, whenever and wherever you meet him, a victim\r\nof prejudice or of passion, a sacrifice to a transient excitement; if\r\nyou shall see in him a man for whose condemnation any provision of the\r\nconstitution has been violated or any principle of law broken down, then\r\nwill he be able, humble and low as may be his condition, then will he be\r\nable to turn the current of compassion backward, and to look with pity\r\non those who have been his judges. If you are about to visit this\r\nrespondent with a judgment which shall blast his house; if the bosoms of\r\nthe innocent and the amiable are to be made to bleed under your\r\ninfliction, I beseech you to be able to state clear and strong grounds\r\nfor your proceeding. Prejudice and excitement are transitory, and will\r\npass away. Political expediency, in matters of judicature, is a false\r\nand hollow principle, and will never satisfy the conscience of him who\r\nis fearful that he may have given a hasty judgment. I earnestly entreat\r\nyou, for your own sakes, to possess yourselves of solid reasons, founded\r\nin truth and justice, for the judgment you pronounce, which you can\r\ncarry with you till you go down into your graves; reasons which it will\r\nrequire no argument to revive, no sophistry, no excitement, no regard to\r\npopular favor, to render satisfactory to your consciences; reasons which\r\nyou can appeal to in every crisis of your lives, and which shall be able\r\nto assure you, in your own great extremity, that you have not judged a\r\nfellow-creature without mercy.\r\n\r\nSir, I have done with the case of this individual, and now leave it in\r\nyour hands. But I would yet once more appeal to you as public men; as\r\nstatesmen; as men of enlightened minds, capable of a large view of\r\nthings, and of foreseeing the remote consequences of important\r\ntransactions; and, as such, I would most earnestly implore you to\r\nconsider fully of the judgment you may pronounce. You are about to give\r\na construction to constitutional provisions which may adhere to that\r\ninstrument for ages, either for good or evil. I may perhaps overrate the\r\nimportance of this occasion to the public welfare; but I confess it does\r\nappear to me that, if this body give its sanction to some of the\r\nprinciples which have been advanced on this occasion, then there is a\r\npower in the State above the constitution and the law; a power\r\nessentially arbitrary and despotic, the exercise of which may be most\r\ndangerous. If impeachment be not under the rule of the constitution and\r\nthe laws, then may we tremble, not only for those who may be impeached,\r\nbut for all others. If the full benefit of every constitutional\r\nprovision be not extended to the respondent, his case becomes the case\r\nof all the people of the Commonwealth. The constitution is their\r\nconstitution. They have made it for their own protection, and for his\r\namong the rest. They are not eager for his conviction. They desire not\r\nhis ruin. If he be condemned, without having his offences set forth in\r\nthe manner which they, by their constitution, have prescribed, and in\r\nthe manner which they, by their laws, have ordained, then not only is he\r\ncondemned unjustly, but the rights of the whole people are disregarded.\r\nFor the sake of the people themselves, therefore, I would resist all\r\nattempts to convict by straining the laws or getting over their\r\nprohibitions. I hold up before him the broad shield of the\r\nconstitution; if through that he be pierced and fall, he will be but one\r\nsufferer in a common catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION IN GREECE.\r\n\r\nA SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\nON THE 19TH OF JANUARY, 1824.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The rise and progress of the revolution in Greece attracted great\r\nattention in the United States. Many obvious causes contributed to this\r\neffect, and their influence was seconded by the direct appeal made to\r\nthe people of America, by the first political body organized in Greece\r\nafter the breaking out of the revolution, viz. \"The Messenian Senate of\r\nCalamata.\" A formal address was made by that body to the people of the\r\nUnited States, and forwarded by their committee (of which the celebrated\r\nKoray was chairman), to a friend and correspondent in this country. This\r\naddress was translated and widely circulated; but it was not to be\r\nexpected that any great degree of confidence should be at once generally\r\nfelt in a movement undertaken against such formidable odds.\r\n\r\nThe progress of events, however, in 1822 and 1823, was such as to create\r\nan impression that the revolution in Greece had a substantial foundation\r\nin the state of affairs, in the awakened spirit of that country, and in\r\nthe condition of public opinion throughout Christendom. The interest\r\nfelt in the struggle rapidly increased in the United States. Local\r\ncommittees were formed, animated appeals were made, and funds collected,\r\nwith a view to the relief of the victims of the war.\r\n\r\nOn the assembling of Congress, in December, 1823, President Monroe made\r\nthe revolution in Greece the subject of a paragraph in his annual\r\nmessage, and on the 8th of December Mr. Webster moved the following\r\nresolution in the House of Representatives:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That provision ought to be made, by law, for defraying the\r\nexpense incident to the appointment of an Agent or Commissioner to\r\nGreece, whenever the President shall deem it expedient to make such\r\nappointment.\"\r\n\r\nThese, it is believed, are the first official expressions favorable to\r\nthe independence of Greece uttered by any of the governments of\r\nChristendom, and no doubt contributed powerfully towards the creation of\r\nthat feeling throughout the civilized world which eventually led to the\r\nbattle of Navarino, and the liberation of a portion of Greece from the\r\nTurkish yoke.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives having, on the 19th of January, resolved\r\nitself into a committee of the whole, and this resolution being taken\r\ninto consideration, Mr. Webster spoke to the following effect.]\r\n\r\nI am afraid, Mr. Chairman, that, so far as my part in this discussion is\r\nconcerned, those expectations which the public excitement existing on\r\nthe subject, and certain associations easily suggested by it, have\r\nconspired to raise, may be disappointed. An occasion which calls the\r\nattention to a spot so distinguished, so connected with interesting\r\nrecollections, as Greece, may naturally create something of warmth and\r\nenthusiasm. In a grave, political discussion, however, it is necessary\r\nthat those feelings should be chastised. I shall endeavor properly to\r\nrepress them, although it is impossible that they should be altogether\r\nextinguished. We must, indeed, fly beyond the civilized world; we must\r\npass the dominion of law and the boundaries of knowledge; we must, more\r\nespecially, withdraw ourselves from this place, and the scenes and\r\nobjects which here surround us,--if we would separate ourselves entirely\r\nfrom the influence of all those memorials of herself which ancient\r\nGreece has transmitted for the admiration and the benefit of mankind.\r\nThis free form of government, this popular assembly, the common council\r\nheld for the common good,--where have we contemplated its earliest\r\nmodels? This practice of free debate and public discussion, the contest\r\nof mind with mind, and that popular eloquence, which, if it were now\r\nhere, on a subject like this, would move the stones of the\r\nCapitol,--whose was the language in which all these were first\r\nexhibited? Even the edifice in which we assemble, these proportioned\r\ncolumns, this ornamented architecture, all remind us that Greece has\r\nexisted, and that we, like the rest of mankind, are greatly her\r\ndebtors.[1]\r\n\r\nBut I have not introduced this motion in the vain hope of discharging\r\nany thing of this accumulated debt of centuries. I have not acted upon\r\nthe expectation, that we who have inherited this obligation from our\r\nancestors should now attempt to pay it to those who may seem to have\r\ninherited from _their_ ancestors a right to receive payment. My object\r\nis nearer and more immediate. I wish to take occasion of the struggle of\r\nan interesting and gallant people, in the cause of liberty and\r\nChristianity, to draw the attention of the House to the circumstances\r\nwhich have accompanied that struggle, and to the principles which appear\r\nto have governed the conduct of the great states of Europe in regard to\r\nit; and to the effects and consequences of these principles upon the\r\nindependence of nations, and especially upon the institutions of free\r\ngovernments. What I have to say of Greece, therefore, concerns the\r\nmodern, not the ancient; the living, and not the dead. It regards her,\r\nnot as she exists in history, triumphant over time, and tyranny, and\r\nignorance; but as she now is, contending, against fearful odds, for\r\nbeing, and for the common privileges of human nature.\r\n\r\nAs it is never difficult to recite commonplace remarks and trite\r\naphorisms, so it may be easy, I am aware, on this occasion, to remind me\r\nof the wisdom which dictates to men a care of their own affairs, and\r\nadmonishes them, instead of searching for adventures abroad, to leave\r\nother men's concerns in their own hands. It may be easy to call this\r\nresolution _Quixotic_, the emanation of a crusading or propagandist\r\nspirit. All this, and more, may be readily said; but all this, and more,\r\nwill not be allowed to fix a character upon this proceeding, until that\r\nis proved which it takes for granted. Let it first be shown, that in\r\nthis question there is nothing which can affect the interest, the\r\ncharacter, or the duty of this country. Let it be proved, that we are\r\nnot called upon, by either of these considerations, to express an\r\nopinion on the subject to which the resolution relates. Let this be\r\nproved, and then it will indeed be made out, that neither ought this\r\nresolution to pass, nor ought the subject of it to have been mentioned\r\nin the communication of the President to us. But, in my opinion, this\r\ncannot be shown. In my judgment, the subject is interesting to the\r\npeople and the government of this country, and we are called upon, by\r\nconsiderations of great weight and moment, to express our opinions upon\r\nit. These considerations, I think, spring from a sense of our own duty,\r\nour character, and our own interest. I wish to treat the subject on such\r\ngrounds, exclusively, as are truly _American_; but then, in considering\r\nit as an American question, I cannot forget the age in which we live,\r\nthe prevailing spirit of the age, the interesting questions which\r\nagitate it, and our own peculiar relation in regard to these interesting\r\nquestions. Let this be, then, and as far as I am concerned I hope it\r\nwill be, purely an American discussion; but let it embrace,\r\nnevertheless, every thing that fairly concerns America. Let it\r\ncomprehend, not merely her present advantage, but her permanent\r\ninterest, her elevated character as one of the free states of the world,\r\nand her duty towards those great principles which have hitherto\r\nmaintained the relative independence of nations, and which have, more\r\nespecially, made her what she is.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the session, the President, in the discharge of\r\nthe high duties of his office, called our attention to the subject to\r\nwhich this resolution refers. \"A strong hope,\" says that communication,\r\n\"has been long entertained, founded on the heroic struggle of the\r\nGreeks, that they would succeed in their contest, and resume their equal\r\nstation among the nations of the earth. It is believed that the whole\r\ncivilized world takes a deep interest in their welfare. Although no\r\npower has declared in their favor, yet none, according to our\r\ninformation, has taken part against them. Their cause and their name\r\nhave protected them from dangers which might ere this have overwhelmed\r\nany other people. The ordinary calculations of interest, and of\r\nacquisition with a view to aggrandizement, which mingle so much in the\r\ntransactions of nations, seem to have had no effect in regard to them.\r\nFrom the facts which have come to our knowledge, there is good cause to\r\nbelieve that their enemy has lost for ever all dominion over them; that\r\nGreece will become again an independent nation.\"\r\n\r\nIt has appeared to me that the House should adopt some resolution\r\nreciprocating these sentiments, so far as it shall approve them. More\r\nthan twenty years have elapsed since Congress first ceased to receive\r\nsuch a communication from the President as could properly be made the\r\nsubject of a general answer. I do not mean to find fault with this\r\nrelinquishment of a former and an ancient practice. It may have been\r\nattended with inconveniences which justified its abolition. But,\r\ncertainly, there was one advantage belonging to it; and that is, that it\r\nfurnished a fit opportunity for the expression of the opinion of the\r\nHouses of Congress upon those topics in the executive communication\r\nwhich were not expected to be made the immediate subjects of direct\r\nlegislation. Since, therefore, the President's message does not now\r\nreceive a general answer, it has seemed to me to be proper that, in some\r\nmode, agreeable to our own usual form of proceeding, we should express\r\nour sentiments upon the important and interesting topics on which it\r\ntreats.\r\n\r\nIf the sentiments of the message in respect to Greece be proper, it is\r\nequally proper that this House should reciprocate those sentiments. The\r\npresent resolution is designed to have that extent, and no more. If it\r\npass, it will leave any future proceeding where it now is, in the\r\ndiscretion of the executive government. It is but an expression, under\r\nthose forms in which the House is accustomed to act, of the satisfaction\r\nof the House with the general sentiments expressed in regard to this\r\nsubject in the message, and of its readiness to defray the expense\r\nincident to any inquiry for the purpose of further information, or any\r\nother agency which the President, in his discretion, shall see fit, in\r\nwhatever manner and at whatever time, to institute. The whole matter is\r\nstill left in his judgment, and this resolution can in no way restrain\r\nits unlimited exercise.\r\n\r\nI might well, Mr. Chairman, avoid the responsibility of this measure, if\r\nit had, in my judgment, any tendency to change the policy of the\r\ncountry. With the general course of that policy I am quite satisfied.\r\nThe nation is prosperous, peaceful, and happy; and I should very\r\nreluctantly put its peace, prosperity, or happiness at risk. It appears\r\nto me, however, that this resolution is strictly conformable to our\r\ngeneral policy, and not only consistent with our interests, but even\r\ndemanded by a large and liberal view of those interests.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that the just policy of this country is, in the\r\nfirst place, a peaceful policy. No nation ever had less to expect from\r\nforcible aggrandizement. The mighty agents which are working out our\r\ngreatness are time, industry, and the arts. Our augmentation is by\r\ngrowth, not by acquisition; by internal development, not by external\r\naccession. No schemes can be suggested to us so magnificent as the\r\nprospects which a sober contemplation of our own condition, unaided by\r\nprojects, uninfluenced by ambition, fairly spreads before us. A country\r\nof such vast extent, with such varieties of soil and climate, with so\r\nmuch public spirit and private enterprise, with a population increasing\r\nso much beyond former example, with capacities of improvement not only\r\nunapplied or unexhausted, but even, in a great measure, as yet\r\nunexplored,--so free in its institutions, so mild in its laws, so secure\r\nin the title it confers on every man to his own acquisitions,--needs\r\nnothing but time and peace to carry it forward to almost any point of\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, I take it for granted that the policy of this\r\ncountry, springing from the nature of our government and the spirit of\r\nall our institutions, is, so far as it respects the interesting\r\nquestions which agitate the present age, on the side of liberal and\r\nenlightened sentiments. The age is extraordinary; the spirit that\r\nactuates it is peculiar and marked; and our own relation to the times we\r\nlive in, and to the questions which interest them, is equally marked and\r\npeculiar. We are placed, by our good fortune and the wisdom and valor of\r\nour ancestors, in a condition in which we _can_ act no obscure part. Be\r\nit for honor, or be it for dishonor, whatever we do is sure to attract\r\nthe observation of the world. As one of the free states among the\r\nnations, as a great and rapidly rising republic, it would be impossible\r\nfor us, if we were so disposed, to prevent our principles, our\r\nsentiments, and our example from producing some effect upon the opinions\r\nand hopes of society throughout the civilized world. It rests probably\r\nwith ourselves to determine whether the influence of these shall be\r\nsalutary or pernicious.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that the great political question of this age is\r\nthat between absolute and regulated governments. The substance of the\r\ncontroversy is whether society shall have any part in its own\r\ngovernment. Whether the form of government shall be that of limited\r\nmonarchy, with more or less mixture of hereditary power, or wholly\r\nelective or representative, may perhaps be considered as subordinate.\r\nThe main controversy is between that absolute rule, which, while it\r\npromises to govern well, means, nevertheless, to govern without control,\r\nand that constitutional system which restrains sovereign discretion, and\r\nasserts that society may claim as matter of right some effective power\r\nin the establishment of the laws which are to regulate it. The spirit of\r\nthe times sets with a most powerful current in favor of these\r\nlast-mentioned opinions. It is opposed, however, whenever and wherever\r\nit shows itself, by certain of the great potentates of Europe; and it is\r\nopposed on grounds as applicable in one civilized nation as in another,\r\nand which would justify such opposition in relation to the United\r\nStates, as well as in relation to any other state or nation, if time and\r\ncircumstances should render such opposition expedient.\r\n\r\nWhat part it becomes this country to take on a question of this sort, so\r\nfar as it is called upon to take any part, cannot be doubtful. Our side\r\nof this question is settled for us, even without our own volition. Our\r\nhistory, our situation, our character, necessarily decide our position\r\nand our course, before we have even time to ask whether we have an\r\noption. Our place is on the side of free institutions. From the earliest\r\nsettlement of these States, their inhabitants were accustomed, in a\r\ngreater or less degree, to the enjoyment of the powers of\r\nself-government; and for the last half-century they have sustained\r\nsystems of government entirely representative, yielding to themselves\r\nthe greatest possible prosperity, and not leaving them without\r\ndistinction and respect among the nations of the earth. This system we\r\nare not likely to abandon; and while we shall no farther recommend its\r\nadoption to other nations, in whole or in part, than it may recommend\r\nitself by its visible influence on our own growth and prosperity, we\r\nare, nevertheless, interested to resist the establishment of doctrines\r\nwhich deny the legality of its foundations. We stand as an equal among\r\nnations, claiming the full benefit of the established international law;\r\nand it is our duty to oppose, from the earliest to the latest moment,\r\nany innovations upon that code which shall bring into doubt or question\r\nour own equal and independent rights.\r\n\r\nI will now, Mr. Chairman, advert to those pretensions put forth by the\r\nallied sovereigns of Continental Europe, which seem to me calculated, if\r\nunresisted, to bring into disrepute the principles of our government,\r\nand, indeed, to be wholly incompatible with any degree of national\r\nindependence. I do not introduce these considerations for the sake of\r\ntopics. I am not about to declaim against crowned heads, nor to quarrel\r\nwith any country for preferring a form of government different from our\r\nown. The right of choice that we exercise for ourselves, I am quite\r\nwilling to leave also to others. But it appears to me that the\r\npretensions to which I have alluded are wholly inconsistent with the\r\nindependence of nations generally, without regard to the question\r\nwhether their governments be absolute, monarchical and limited, or\r\npurely popular and representative. I have a most deep and thorough\r\nconviction, that a new era has arisen in the world, that new and\r\ndangerous combinations are taking place, promulgating doctrines and\r\nfraught with consequences wholly subversive in their tendency of the\r\npublic law of nations and of the general liberties of mankind. Whether\r\nthis be so, or not, is the question which I now propose to examine, upon\r\nsuch grounds of information as are afforded by the common and public\r\nmeans of knowledge.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows that, since the final restoration of the Bourbons to the\r\nthrone of France, the Continental powers have entered into sundry\r\nalliances, which have been made public, and have held several meetings\r\nor congresses, at which the principles of their political conduct have\r\nbeen declared. These things must necessarily have an effect upon the\r\ninternational law of the states of the world. If that effect be good,\r\nand according to the principles of that law, they deserve to be\r\napplauded. If, on the contrary, their effect and tendency be most\r\ndangerous, their principles wholly inadmissible, their pretensions such\r\nas would abolish every degree of national independence, then they are to\r\nbe resisted.\r\n\r\nI begin, Mr. Chairman, by drawing your attention to the treaty concluded\r\nat Paris in September, 1815, between Russia, Prussia, and Austria,\r\ncommonly called the Holy Alliance. This singular alliance appears to\r\nhave originated with the Emperor of Russia; for we are informed that a\r\ndraft of it was exhibited by him, personally, to a plenipotentiary of\r\none of the great powers of Europe, before it was presented to the other\r\nsovereigns who ultimately signed it.[2] This instrument professes\r\nnothing, certainly, which is not extremely commendable and praiseworthy.\r\nIt promises only that the contracting parties, both in relation to other\r\nstates, and in regard to their own subjects, will observe the rules of\r\njustice and Christianity. In confirmation of these promises, it makes\r\nthe most solemn and devout religious invocations. Now, although such an\r\nalliance is a novelty in European history, the world seems to have\r\nreceived this treaty, upon its first promulgation, with general charity.\r\nIt was commonly understood as little or nothing more than an expression\r\nof thanks for the successful termination of the momentous contest in\r\nwhich those sovereigns had been engaged. It still seems somewhat\r\nunaccountable, however, that these good resolutions should require to be\r\nconfirmed by treaty. Who doubted that these august sovereigns would\r\ntreat each other with justice, and rule their own subjects in mercy? And\r\nwhat necessity was there for a solemn stipulation by treaty, to insure\r\nthe performance of that which is no more than the ordinary duty of every\r\ngovernment? It would hardly be admitted by these sovereigns, that by\r\nthis compact they consider themselves bound to introduce an entire\r\nchange, or any change in the course of their own conduct. Nothing\r\nsubstantially new, certainly, can be supposed to have been intended.\r\nWhat principle, or what practice, therefore, called for this solemn\r\ndeclaration of the intention of the parties to observe the rules of\r\nreligion and justice?\r\n\r\nIt is not a little remarkable, that a writer of reputation upon the\r\nPublic Law, described, many years ago, not inaccurately, the character\r\nof this alliance. I allude to Puffendorf. \"It seems useless,\" says he,\r\n\"to frame any pacts or leagues, barely for the defence and support of\r\nuniversal peace; for by such a league nothing is superadded to the\r\nobligation of natural law, and no agreement is made for the performance\r\nof any thing which the parties were not previously bound to perform; nor\r\nis the original obligation rendered firmer or stronger by such an\r\naddition. Men of any tolerable culture and civilization might well be\r\nashamed of entering into any such compact, the conditions of which imply\r\nonly that the parties concerned shall not offend in any clear point of\r\nduty. Besides, we should be guilty of great irreverence towards God,\r\nshould we suppose that his injunctions had not already laid a sufficient\r\nobligation upon us to act justly, unless we ourselves voluntarily\r\nconsented to the same engagement; as if our obligation to obey his will\r\ndepended upon our own pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"If one engage to serve another, he does not set it down expressly and\r\nparticularly among the terms and conditions of the bargain, that he will\r\nnot betray nor murder him, nor pillage nor burn his house. For the same\r\nreason, that would be a dishonorable engagement in which men should bind\r\nthemselves to act properly and decently, and not break the peace.\"[3]\r\n\r\nSuch were the sentiments of that eminent writer. How nearly he had\r\nanticipated the case of the Holy Alliance will appear from the preamble\r\nto that alliance. After stating that the allied sovereigns had become\r\npersuaded, by the events of the last three years, that \"their relations\r\nwith each other ought to be regulated exclusively by the sublime truths\r\ntaught by the eternal religion of God the Saviour,\" they solemnly\r\ndeclare their fixed resolution \"to adopt as the sole rule of their\r\nconduct, both in the administration of their respective states, and in\r\ntheir political relations with every other government, the precepts of\r\nthat holy religion, namely, the precepts of justice, charity, and peace,\r\nwhich, far from being applicable to private life alone, ought, on the\r\ncontrary, to have a direct influence upon the counsels of princes, and\r\nguide all their steps, as being the only means of consolidating human\r\ninstitutions, and remedying their imperfections.\"[4]\r\n\r\nThis measure, however, appears principally important, as it was the\r\nfirst of a series, and was followed afterwards by others of a more\r\nmarked and practical nature. These measures, taken together, profess to\r\nestablish two principles, which the Allied Powers would introduce as a\r\npart of the law of the civilized world; and the establishment of which\r\nis to be enforced by a million and a half of bayonets.\r\n\r\nThe first of these principles is, that all popular or constitutional\r\nrights are held no otherwise than as grants from the crown. Society,\r\nupon this principle, has no rights of its own; it takes good government,\r\nwhen it gets it, as a boon and a concession, but can demand nothing. It\r\nis to live by that favor which emanates from royal authority, and if it\r\nhave the misfortune to lose that favor, there is nothing to protect it\r\nagainst any degree of injustice and oppression. It can rightfully make\r\nno endeavor for a change, by itself; its whole privilege is to receive\r\nthe favors that may be dispensed by the sovereign power, and all its\r\nduty is described in the single word _submission_. This is the plain\r\nresult of the principal Continental state papers; indeed, it is nearly\r\nthe identical text of some of them.\r\n\r\nThe circular despatch addressed by the sovereigns assembled at Laybach,\r\nin the spring of 1821, to their ministers at foreign courts, alleges,\r\n\"that useful and necessary changes in legislation and in the\r\nadministration of states ought only to emanate from the free will and\r\nintelligent and well-weighed conviction of those whom God has rendered\r\nresponsible for power. All that deviates from this line necessarily\r\nleads to disorder, commotions, and evils far more insufferable than\r\nthose which they pretend to remedy.\"[5] Now, Sir, this principle would\r\ncarry Europe back again, at once, into the middle of the Dark Ages. It\r\nis the old doctrine of the Divine right of kings, advanced now by new\r\nadvocates, and sustained by a formidable array of power. That the people\r\nhold their fundamental privileges as matter of concession or indulgence\r\nfrom the sovereign power, is a sentiment not easy to be diffused in this\r\nage, any farther than it is enforced by the direct operation of military\r\nmeans. It is true, certainly, that some six centuries ago the early\r\nfounders of English liberty called the instrument which secured their\r\nrights a _charter_. It was, indeed, a concession; they had obtained it\r\nsword in hand from the king; and in many other cases, whatever was\r\nobtained, favorable to human rights, from the tyranny and despotism of\r\nthe feudal sovereigns, was called by the names of _privileges_ and\r\n_liberties_, as being matter of special favor. Though we retain this\r\nlanguage at the present time, the principle itself belongs to ages that\r\nhave long passed by us. The civilized world has done with \"the enormous\r\nfaith, of many made for one.\" Society asserts its own rights, and\r\nalleges them to be original, sacred, and unalienable. It is not\r\nsatisfied with having kind masters; it demands a participation in its\r\nown government; and in states much advanced in civilization, it urges\r\nthis demand with a constancy and an energy that cannot well nor long be\r\nresisted. There are, happily, enough of regulated governments in the\r\nworld, and those among the most distinguished, to operate as constant\r\nexamples, and to keep alive an unceasing panting in the bosoms of men\r\nfor the enjoyment of similar free institutions.\r\n\r\nWhen the English Revolution of 1688 took place, the English people did\r\nnot content themselves with the example of Runnymede; they did not build\r\ntheir hopes upon royal charters; they did not, like the authors of the\r\nLaybach circular, suppose that all useful changes in constitutions and\r\nlaws must proceed from those only whom God has rendered responsible for\r\npower. They were somewhat better instructed in the principles of civil\r\nliberty, or at least they were better lovers of those principles than\r\nthe sovereigns of Laybach. Instead of petitioning for charters, they\r\ndeclared their rights, and while they offered to the Prince of Orange\r\nthe crown with one hand, they held in the other an enumeration of those\r\nprivileges which they did not profess to hold as favors, but which they\r\ndemanded and insisted upon as their undoubted rights.\r\n\r\nI need not stop to observe, Mr. Chairman, how totally hostile are these\r\ndoctrines of Laybach to the fundamental principles of our government.\r\nThey are in direct contradiction; the principles of good and evil are\r\nhardly more opposite. If these principles of the sovereigns be true, we\r\nare but in a state of rebellion or of anarchy, and are only tolerated\r\namong civilized states because it has not yet been convenient to reduce\r\nus to the true standard.\r\n\r\nBut the second, and, if possible, the still more objectionable\r\nprinciple, avowed in these papers, is the right of forcible interference\r\nin the affairs of other states. A right to control nations in their\r\ndesire to change their own government, wherever it maybe conjectured, or\r\npretended, that such change might furnish an example to the subjects of\r\nother states, is plainly and distinctly asserted. The same Congress that\r\nmade the declaration at Laybach had declared, before its removal from\r\nTroppau, \"that the powers have an undoubted right to take a hostile\r\nattitude in regard to those states in which the overthrow of the\r\ngovernment may operate as an example.\"\r\n\r\nThere cannot, as I think, be conceived a more flagrant violation of\r\npublic law, or national independence, than is contained in this short\r\ndeclaration.\r\n\r\nNo matter what be the character of the government resisted; no matter\r\nwith what weight the foot of the oppressor bears on the neck of the\r\noppressed; if he struggle, or if he complain, he sets a dangerous\r\nexample of resistance,--and from that moment he becomes an object of\r\nhostility to the most powerful potentates of the earth. I want words to\r\nexpress my abhorrence of this abominable principle. I trust every\r\nenlightened man throughout the world will oppose it, and that,\r\nespecially, those who, like ourselves, are fortunately out of the reach\r\nof the bayonets that enforce it, will proclaim their detestation of it,\r\nin a tone both loud and decisive. The avowed object of such declarations\r\nis to preserve the peace of the world. But by what means is it proposed\r\nto preserve this peace? Simply, by bringing the power of all governments\r\nto bear against all subjects. Here is to be established a sort of\r\ndouble, or treble, or quadruple, or, for aught I know, quintuple\r\nallegiance. An offence against one king is to be an offence against all\r\nkings, and the power of all is to be put forth for the punishment of the\r\noffender. A right to interfere in extreme cases, in the case of\r\ncontiguous states, and where imminent danger is threatened to one by\r\nwhat is occurring in another, is not without precedent in modern times,\r\nupon what has been called the law of vicinage; and when confined to\r\nextreme cases, and limited to a certain extent, it may perhaps be\r\ndefended upon principles of necessity and self-defence. But to maintain\r\nthat sovereigns may go to war upon the subjects of another state to\r\nrepress an example, is monstrous indeed. What is to be the limit to such\r\na principle, or to the practice growing out of it? What, in any case,\r\nbut sovereign pleasure, is to decide whether the example be good or bad?\r\nAnd what, under the operation of such a rule, may be thought of our\r\nexample? Why are we not as fair objects for the operation of the new\r\nprinciple, as any of those who may attempt a reform of government on the\r\nother side of the Atlantic?\r\n\r\nThe ultimate effect of this alliance of sovereigns, for objects personal\r\nto themselves, or respecting only the permanence of their own power,\r\nmust be the destruction of all just feeling, and all natural sympathy,\r\nbetween those who exercise the power of government and those who are\r\nsubject to it. The old channels of mutual regard and confidence are to\r\nbe dried up, or cut off. Obedience can now be expected no longer than it\r\nis enforced. Instead of relying on the affections of the governed,\r\nsovereigns are to rely on the affections and friendship of other\r\nsovereigns. There are, in short, no longer to be nations. Princes and\r\npeople are no longer to unite for interests common to them both. There\r\nis to be an end of all patriotism, as a distinct national feeling.\r\nSociety is to be divided horizontally; all sovereigns above, and all\r\nsubjects below; the former coalescing for their own security, and for\r\nthe more certain subjection of the undistinguished multitude beneath.\r\nThis, Sir, is no picture drawn by imagination. I have hardly used\r\nlanguage stronger than that in which the authors of this new system have\r\ncommented on their own work. M. de Chateaubriand, in his speech in the\r\nFrench Chamber of Deputies, in February last, declared, that he had a\r\nconference with the Emperor of Russia at Verona, in which that august\r\nsovereign uttered sentiments which appeared to him so precious, that he\r\nimmediately hastened home, and wrote them down while yet fresh in his\r\nrecollection. \"The Emperor declared,\" said he, \"that there can no longer\r\nbe such a thing as an English, French, Russian, Prussian, or Austrian\r\npolicy; there is henceforth but one policy, which, for the safety of\r\nall, should be adopted both by people and kings. It was for me first to\r\nshow myself convinced of the principles upon which I founded the\r\nalliance; an occasion offered itself,--the rising in Greece. Nothing\r\ncertainly could occur more for my interests, for the interests of my\r\npeople, nothing more acceptable to my country, than a religious war in\r\nTurkey. But I have thought I perceived in the troubles of the Morea the\r\nsign of revolution, and I have held back. Providence has not put under\r\nmy command eight hundred thousand soldiers to satisfy my ambition, but\r\nto protect religion, morality, and justice, and to secure the prevalence\r\nof those principles of order on which human society rests. It may well\r\nbe permitted, that kings may have public alliances to defend themselves\r\nagainst secret enemies.\"\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are the words which the French minister thought so important\r\nthat they deserved to be recorded; and I, too, Sir, am of the same\r\nopinion. But if it be true that there is hereafter to be neither a\r\nRussian policy, nor a Prussian policy, nor an Austrian policy, nor a\r\nFrench policy, nor even, which yet I will not believe, an English\r\npolicy, there will be, I trust in God, an American policy. If the\r\nauthority of all these governments be hereafter to be mixed and blended,\r\nand to flow in one augmented current of prerogative over the face of\r\nEurope, sweeping away all resistance in its course, it will yet remain\r\nfor us to secure our own happiness by the preservation of our own\r\nprinciples; which I hope we shall have the manliness to express on all\r\nproper occasions, and the spirit to defend in every extremity. The end\r\nand scope of this amalgamated policy are neither more nor less than\r\nthis: to interfere, by force, for any government against any people who\r\nmay resist it. Be the state of the people what it may, they shall not\r\nrise; be the government what it will, it shall not be opposed.\r\n\r\nThe practical commentary has corresponded with the plain language of the\r\ntext. Look at Spain, and at Greece. If men may not resist the Spanish\r\nInquisition, and the Turkish cimeter, what is there to which humanity\r\nmust not submit? Stronger cases can never arise. Is it not proper for\r\nus, at all times, is it not our duty, at this time, to come forth, and\r\ndeny, and condemn, these monstrous principles? Where, but here, and in\r\none other place, are they likely to be resisted? They are advanced with\r\nequal coolness and boldness; and they are supported by immense power.\r\nThe timid will shrink and give way, and many of the brave may be\r\ncompelled to yield to force. Human liberty may yet, perhaps, be obliged\r\nto repose its principal hopes on the intelligence and the vigor of the\r\nSaxon race. As far as depends on us, at least, I trust those hopes will\r\nnot be disappointed; and that, to the extent which may consist with our\r\nown settled, pacific policy, our opinions and sentiments may be brought\r\nto act on the right side, and to the right end, on an occasion which is,\r\nin truth, nothing less than a momentous question between an intelligent\r\nage, full of knowledge, thirsting for improvement, and quickened by a\r\nthousand impulses, on one side, and the most arbitrary pretensions,\r\nsustained by unprecedented power, on the other.\r\n\r\nThis asserted right of forcible intervention in the affairs of other\r\nnations is in open violation of the public law of the world. Who has\r\nauthorized these learned doctors of Troppau to establish new articles in\r\nthis code? Whence are their diplomas? Is the whole world expected to\r\nacquiesce in principles which entirely subvert the independence of\r\nnations? On the basis of this independence has been reared the beautiful\r\nfabric of international law. On the principle of this independence,\r\nEurope has seen a family of nations flourishing within its limits, the\r\nsmall among the large, protected not always by power, but by a principle\r\nabove power, by a sense of propriety and justice. On this principle, the\r\ngreat commonwealth of civilized states has been hitherto upheld. There\r\nhave been occasional departures or violations, and always disastrous, as\r\nin the case of Poland; but, in general, the harmony of the system has\r\nbeen wonderfully preserved. In the production and preservation of this\r\nsense of justice, this predominating principle, the Christian religion\r\nhas acted a main part. Christianity and civilization have labored\r\ntogether; it seems, indeed, to be a law of our human condition, that\r\nthey can live and flourish only together. From their blended influence\r\nhas arisen that delightful spectacle of the prevalence of reason and\r\nprinciple over power and interest, so well described by one who was an\r\nhonor to the age;--\r\n\r\n    \"And sovereign Law, the state's collected will,\r\n      O'er thrones and globes elate,\r\n    Sits empress,--crowning good, repressing ill:\r\n      Smit by her sacred frown,\r\n    The fiend, Discretion, like a vapor, sinks,\r\n      And e'en the all-dazzling crown\r\n    Hides his faint rays, and at her bidding shrinks.\"\r\n\r\nBut this vision is past. While the teachers of Laybach give the rule,\r\nthere will be no law but the law of the strongest.\r\n\r\nIt may now be required of me to show what interest _we_ have in\r\nresisting this new system. What is it to _us_, it may be asked, upon\r\nwhat principles, or what pretences, the European governments assert a\r\nright of interfering in the affairs of their neighbors? The thunder, it\r\nmay be said, rolls at a distance. The wide Atlantic is between us and\r\ndanger; and, however others may suffer, _we_ shall remain safe.\r\n\r\nI think it is a sufficient answer to this to say, that we are one of the\r\nnations of the earth; that we have an interest, therefore, in the\r\npreservation of that system of national law and national intercourse\r\nwhich has heretofore subsisted, so beneficially for all. Our system of\r\ngovernment, it should also be remembered, is, throughout, founded on\r\nprinciples utterly hostile to the new code; and if we remain undisturbed\r\nby its operation, we shall owe our security either to our situation or\r\nour spirit. The enterprising character of the age, our own active,\r\ncommercial spirit, the great increase which has taken place in the\r\nintercourse among civilized and commercial states, have necessarily\r\nconnected us with other nations, and given us a high concern in the\r\npreservation of those salutary principles upon which that intercourse is\r\nfounded. We have as clear an interest in international law, as\r\nindividuals have in the laws of society.\r\n\r\nBut apart from the soundness of the policy, on the ground of direct\r\ninterest, we have, Sir, a duty connected with this subject, which I\r\ntrust we are willing to perform. What do _we_ not owe to the cause of\r\ncivil and religious liberty? to the principle of lawful resistance? to\r\nthe principle that society has a right to partake in its own government?\r\nAs the leading republic of the world, living and breathing in these\r\nprinciples, and advanced, by their operation, with unequalled rapidity\r\nin our career, shall we give _our_ consent to bring them into disrepute\r\nand disgrace? It is neither ostentation nor boasting to say, that there\r\nlies before this country, in immediate prospect, a great extent and\r\nheight of power. We are borne along towards this without effort, and not\r\nalways even with a full knowledge of the rapidity of our own motion.\r\nCircumstances which never combined before have co-operated in our favor,\r\nand a mighty current is setting us forward which we could not resist\r\neven if we would, and which, while we would stop to make an observation,\r\nand take the sun, has set us, at the end of the operation, far in\r\nadvance of the place where we commenced it. Does it not become us, then,\r\nis it not a duty imposed on us, to give our weight to the side of\r\nliberty and justice, to let mankind know that we are not tired of our\r\nown institutions, and to protest against the asserted power of altering\r\nat pleasure the law of the civilized world?\r\n\r\nBut whatever we do in this respect, it becomes us to do upon clear and\r\nconsistent principles. There is an important topic in the message to\r\nwhich I have yet hardly alluded. I mean the rumored combination of the\r\nEuropean Continental sovereigns against the newly established free\r\nstates of South America. Whatever position this government may take on\r\nthat subject, I trust it will be one which can be defended on known and\r\nacknowledged grounds of right. The near approach or the remote distance\r\nof danger may affect policy, but cannot change principle. The same\r\nreason that would authorize us to protest against unwarrantable\r\ncombinations to interfere between Spain and her former colonies, would\r\nauthorize us equally to protest if the same combination were directed\r\nagainst the smallest state in Europe, although our duty to ourselves,\r\nour policy, and wisdom, might indicate very different courses as fit to\r\nbe pursued by us in the two cases. We shall not, I trust, act upon the\r\nnotion of dividing the world with the Holy Alliance, and complain of\r\nnothing done by them in their hemisphere if they will not interfere with\r\nours. At least this would not be such a course of policy as I could\r\nrecommend or support. We have not offended, and I hope we do not intend\r\nto offend, in regard to South America, against any principle of national\r\nindependence or of public law. We have done nothing, we shall do\r\nnothing, that we need to hush up or to compromise by forbearing to\r\nexpress our sympathy for the cause of the Greeks, or our opinion of the\r\ncourse which other governments have adopted in regard to them.\r\n\r\nIt may, in the next place, be asked, perhaps, Supposing all this to be\r\ntrue, what can _we_ do? Are we to go to war? Are we to interfere in the\r\nGreek cause, or any other European cause? Are we to endanger our pacific\r\nrelations? No, certainly not. What, then, the question recurs, remains\r\nfor us? If we will not endanger our own peace, if we will neither\r\nfurnish armies nor navies to the cause which we think the just one, what\r\nis there within our power?\r\n\r\nSir, this reasoning mistakes the age. The time has been, indeed, when\r\nfleets, and armies, and subsidies, were the principal reliances even in\r\nthe best cause. But, happily for mankind, a great change has taken place\r\nin this respect. Moral causes come into consideration, in proportion as\r\nthe progress of knowledge is advanced; and the public opinion of the\r\ncivilized world is rapidly gaining an ascendency over mere brutal force.\r\nIt is already able to oppose the most formidable obstruction to the\r\nprogress of injustice and oppression; and as it grows more intelligent\r\nand more intense, it will be more and more formidable. It may be\r\nsilenced by military power, but it cannot be conquered. It is elastic,\r\nirrepressible, and invulnerable to the weapons of ordinary warfare. It\r\nis that impassible, inextinguishable enemy of mere violence and\r\narbitrary rule, which, like Milton's angels,\r\n\r\n    \"Vital in every part, ...\r\n    Cannot, but by annihilating, die.\"\r\n\r\nUntil this be propitiated or satisfied, it is vain for power to talk\r\neither of triumphs or of repose. No matter what fields are desolated,\r\nwhat fortresses surrendered, what armies subdued, or what provinces\r\noverrun. In the history of the year that has passed by us, and in the\r\ninstance of unhappy Spain, we have seen the vanity of all triumphs in a\r\ncause which violates the general sense of justice of the civilized\r\nworld. It is nothing that the troops of France have passed from the\r\nPyrenees to Cadiz; it is nothing that an unhappy and prostrate nation\r\nhas fallen before them; it is nothing that arrests, and confiscation,\r\nand execution, sweep away the little remnant of national resistance.\r\nThere is an enemy that still exists to check the glory of these\r\ntriumphs. It follows the conqueror back to the very scene of his\r\novations; it calls upon him to take notice that Europe, though silent,\r\nis yet indignant; it shows him that the sceptre of his victory is a\r\nbarren sceptre; that it shall confer neither joy nor honor, but shall\r\nmoulder to dry ashes in his grasp. In the midst of his exultation, it\r\npierces his ear with the cry of injured justice; it denounces against\r\nhim the indignation of an enlightened and civilized age; it turns to\r\nbitterness the cup of his rejoicing, and wounds him with the sting which\r\nbelongs to the consciousness of having outraged the opinion of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Sir, the Spanish nation is now nearer, not only in point\r\nof time, but in point of circumstance, to the acquisition of a regulated\r\ngovernment, than at the moment of the French invasion. Nations must, no\r\ndoubt, undergo these trials in their progress to the establishment of\r\nfree institutions. The very trials benefit them, and render them more\r\ncapable both of obtaining and of enjoying the object which they seek.\r\n\r\nI shall not detain the committee, Sir, by laying before it any\r\nstatistical, geographical, or commercial account of Greece. I have no\r\nknowledge on these subjects which is not common to all. It is\r\nuniversally admitted, that, within the last thirty or forty years, the\r\ncondition of Greece has been greatly improved. Her marine is at present\r\nrespectable, containing the best sailors in the Mediterranean, better\r\neven, in that sea, than our own, as more accustomed to the long\r\nquarantines and other regulations which prevail in its ports. The number\r\nof her seamen has been estimated as high as 50,000, but I suppose that\r\nestimate must be much too large. She has, probably, 150,000 tons of\r\nshipping. It is not easy to ascertain the amount of the Greek\r\npopulation. The Turkish government does not trouble itself with any of\r\nthe calculations of political economy, and there has never been such a\r\nthing as an accurate census, probably, in any part of the Turkish\r\nempire. In the absence of all official information, private opinions\r\nwidely differ. By the tables which have been communicated, it would seem\r\nthat there are 2,400,000 Greeks in Greece proper and the islands; an\r\namount, as I am inclined to think, somewhat overrated. There are,\r\nprobably, in the whole of European Turkey, 5,000,000 Greeks, and\r\n2,000,000 more in the Asiatic dominions of that power.\r\n\r\nThe moral and intellectual progress of this numerous population, under\r\nthe horrible oppression which crushes it, has been such as may well\r\nexcite regard. Slaves, under barbarous masters, the Greeks have still\r\naspired after the blessings of knowledge and civilization. Before the\r\nbreaking out of the present revolution, they had established schools,\r\nand colleges, and libraries, and the press. Wherever, as in Scio, owing\r\nto particular circumstances, the weight of oppression was mitigated, the\r\nnatural vivacity of the Greeks, and their aptitude for the arts, were\r\nevinced. Though certainly not on an equality with the civilized and\r\nChristian states of Europe,--and how is it possible, under such\r\noppression as they endured, that they should be?--they yet furnished a\r\nstriking contrast with their Tartar masters. It has been well said, that\r\nit is not easy to form a just conception of the nature of the despotism\r\nexercised over them. Conquest and subjugation, as known among European\r\nstates, are inadequate modes of expression by which to denote the\r\ndominion of the Turks. A conquest in the civilized world is generally no\r\nmore than an acquisition of a new dominion to the conquering country. It\r\ndoes not imply a never-ending bondage imposed upon the conquered, a\r\nperpetual mark,--an opprobrious distinction between them and their\r\nmasters; a bitter and unending persecution of their religion; an\r\nhabitual violation of their rights of person and property, and the\r\nunrestrained indulgence towards them of every passion which belongs to\r\nthe character of a barbarous soldiery. Yet such is the state of Greece.\r\nThe Ottoman power over them, obtained originally by the sword, is\r\nconstantly preserved by the same means. Wherever it exists, it is a mere\r\nmilitary power. The religious and civil code of the state being both\r\nfixed in the Koran, and equally the object of an ignorant and furious\r\nfaith, have been found equally incapable of change. \"The Turk,\" it has\r\nbeen said, \"has been _encamped_ in Europe for four centuries.\" He has\r\nhardly any more participation in European manners, knowledge, and arts,\r\nthan when he crossed the Bosphorus. But this is not the worst. The power\r\nof the empire is fallen into anarchy, and as the principle which belongs\r\nto the head belongs also to the parts, there are as many despots as\r\nthere are pachas, beys, and viziers. Wars are almost perpetual between\r\nthe Sultan and some rebellious governor of a province; and in the\r\nconflict of these despotisms, the people are necessarily ground between\r\nthe upper and the nether millstone. In short, the Christian subjects of\r\nthe Sublime Porte feel daily all the miseries which flow from despotism,\r\nfrom anarchy, from slavery, and from religious persecution. If any thing\r\nyet remains to heighten such a picture, let it be added, that every\r\noffice in the government is not only actually, but professedly,\r\nvenal,--the pachalics, the vizierates, the cadiships, and whatsoever\r\nother denomination may denote the depositary of power. In the whole\r\nworld, Sir, there is no such oppression felt as by the Christian Greeks.\r\nIn various parts of India, to be sure, the government is bad enough; but\r\nthen it is the government of barbarians over barbarians, and the feeling\r\nof oppression is, of course, not so keen. There the oppressed are\r\nperhaps not better than their oppressors; but in the case of Greece,\r\nthere are millions of Christian men, not without knowledge, not without\r\nrefinement, not without a strong thirst for all the pleasures of\r\ncivilized life, trampled into the very earth, century after century, by\r\na pillaging, savage, relentless soldiery. Sir, the case is unique. There\r\nexists, and has existed, nothing like it. The world has no such misery\r\nto show; there is no case in which Christian communities can be called\r\nupon with such emphasis of appeal.\r\n\r\nBut I have said enough, Mr. Chairman, indeed I need have said nothing to\r\nsatisfy the House, that it must be some new combination of\r\ncircumstances, or new views of policy in the cabinets of Europe, which\r\nhave caused this interesting struggle not merely to be regarded with\r\nindifference, but to be marked with opprobrium. The very statement of\r\nthe case, as a contest between the Turks and Greeks, sufficiently\r\nindicates what must be the feeling of every individual, and every\r\ngovernment, that is not biassed by a particular interest, or a\r\nparticular feeling, to disregard the dictates of justice and humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, what has been the conduct pursued by the Allied Powers in\r\nregard to this contest? When the revolution broke out, the sovereigns\r\nwere assembled in congress at Laybach; and the papers of that assembly\r\nsufficiently manifest their sentiments. They proclaim their abhorrence\r\nof those \"criminal combinations which had been formed in the eastern\r\nparts of Europe\"; and, although it is possible that this denunciation\r\nwas aimed, more particularly, at the disturbances in the provinces of\r\nWallachia and Moldavia, yet no exception is made, from its general\r\nterms, in favor of those events in Greece which were properly the\r\ncommencement of her revolution, and which could not but be well known at\r\nLaybach, before the date of these declarations. Now it must be\r\nremembered, that Russia was a leading party in this denunciation of the\r\nefforts of the Greeks to achieve their liberation; and it cannot but be\r\nexpected by Russia, that the world should also remember what part she\r\nherself has heretofore acted in the same concern. It is notorious, that\r\nwithin the last half-century she has again and again excited the Greeks\r\nto rebellion against the Porte, and that she has constantly kept alive\r\nin them the hope that she would, one day, by her own great power, break\r\nthe yoke of their oppressor. Indeed, the earnest attention with which\r\nRussia has regarded Greece goes much farther back than to the time I\r\nhave mentioned. Ivan the Third, in 1482, having espoused a Grecian\r\nprincess, heiress of the last Greek Emperor, discarded St. George from\r\nthe Russian arms, and adopted the Greek two-headed black eagle, which\r\nhas continued in the Russian arms to the present day. In virtue of the\r\nsame marriage, the Russian princes claim the Greek throne as their\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nUnder Peter the Great, the policy of Russia developed itself more fully.\r\nIn 1696, he rendered himself master of Azof, and, in 1698, obtained the\r\nright to pass the Dardanelles, and to maintain, by that route,\r\ncommercial intercourse with the Mediterranean. He had emissaries\r\nthroughout Greece, and particularly applied himself to gain the clergy.\r\nHe adopted the _Labarum_ of Constantine, \"In hoc signo vinces\"; and\r\nmedals were struck, with the inscription, \"Petrus I. Russo-Graecorum\r\nImperator.\" In whatever new direction the principles of the Holy\r\nAlliance may now lead the politics of Russia, or whatever course she may\r\nsuppose Christianity now prescribes to her, in regard to the Greek\r\ncause, the time has been when she professed to be contending for that\r\ncause, as identified with Christianity. The white banner under which the\r\nsoldiers of Peter the First usually fought, bore, as its inscription,\r\n\"In the name of the Prince, and for our country.\" Relying on the aid of\r\nthe Greeks, in his war with the Porte, he changed the white flag to red,\r\nand displayed on it the words, \"In the name of God, and for\r\nChristianity.\" The unfortunate issue of this war is well known. Though\r\nAnne and Elizabeth, the successors of Peter, did not possess his active\r\ncharacter, they kept up a constant communication with Greece, and held\r\nout hopes of restoring the Greek empire. Catharine the Second, as is\r\nwell known, excited a general revolt in 1769. A Russian fleet appeared\r\nin the Mediterranean, and a Russian army was landed in the Morea. The\r\nGreeks in the end were disgusted at being expected to take an oath of\r\nallegiance to Russia, and the Empress was disgusted because they refused\r\nto take it. In 1774, peace was signed between Russia and the Porte, and\r\nthe Greeks of the Morea were left to their fate. By this treaty the\r\nPorte acknowledged the independence of the Khan of the Crimea; a\r\npreliminary step to the acquisition of that country by Russia. It is not\r\nunworthy of remark, as a circumstance which distinguished this from most\r\nother diplomatic transactions, that it conceded to the cabinet of St.\r\nPetersburg the right of intervention in the interior affairs of Turkey,\r\nin regard to whatever concerned the religion of the Greeks. The\r\ncruelties and massacres that happened to the Greeks after the peace\r\nbetween Russia and the Porte, notwithstanding the general pardon which\r\nhad been stipulated for them, need not now be recited. Instead of\r\nretracing the deplorable picture, it is enough to say, that in this\r\nrespect the past is justly reflected in the present. The Empress soon\r\nafter invaded and conquered the Crimea, and on one of the gates of\r\nKerson, its capital, caused to be inscribed, \"The road to Byzantium.\"\r\nThe present Emperor, on his accession to the throne, manifested an\r\nintention to adopt the policy of Catharine the Second as his own, and\r\nthe world has not been right in all its suspicions, if a project for the\r\npartition of Turkey did not form a part of the negotiations of Napoleon\r\nand Alexander at Tilsit.\r\n\r\nAll this course of policy seems suddenly to be changed. Turkey is no\r\nlonger regarded, it would appear, as an object of partition or\r\nacquisition, and Greek revolts have all at once become, according to the\r\ndeclaration of Laybach, \"criminal combinations.\" The recent congress at\r\nVerona exceeded its predecessor at Laybach in its denunciations of the\r\nGreek struggle. In the circular of the 14th of December, 1822, it\r\ndeclared the Grecian resistance to the Turkish power to be rash and\r\nculpable, and lamented that \"the firebrand of rebellion had been thrown\r\ninto the Ottoman empire.\" This rebuke and crimination we know to have\r\nproceeded on those settled principles of conduct which the Continental\r\npowers had prescribed for themselves. The sovereigns saw, as well as\r\nothers, the real condition of the Greeks; they knew as well as others\r\nthat it was most natural and most justifiable, that they should\r\nendeavor, at whatever hazard, to change that condition. They knew that\r\nthey themselves, or at least one of them, had more than once urged the\r\nGreeks to similar efforts; that they themselves had thrown the same\r\nfirebrand into the midst of the Ottoman empire. And yet, so much does it\r\nseem to be their fixed object to discountenance whatsoever threatens to\r\ndisturb the actual government of any country, that, Christians as they\r\nwere, and allied, as they professed to be, for purposes most important\r\nto human happiness and religion, they have not hesitated to declare to\r\nthe world that they have wholly forborne to exercise any compassion to\r\nthe Greeks, simply because they thought that they saw, in the struggles\r\nof the Morea, the sign of revolution. This, then, is coming to a plain,\r\npractical result. The Grecian revolution has been discouraged,\r\ndiscountenanced, and denounced, solely because it _is_ a revolution.\r\nIndependent of all inquiry into the reasonableness of its causes or the\r\nenormity of the oppression which produced it; regardless of the peculiar\r\nclaims which Greece possesses upon the civilized world; and regardless\r\nof what has been their own conduct towards her for a century; regardless\r\nof the interest of the Christian religion,--the sovereigns at Verona\r\nseized upon the case of the Greek revolution as one above all others\r\ncalculated to illustrate the fixed principles of their policy. The\r\nabominable rule of the Porte on one side, the value and the sufferings\r\nof the Christian Greeks on the other, furnished a case likely to\r\nconvince even an incredulous world of the sincerity of the professions\r\nof the Allied Powers. They embraced the occasion with apparent ardor:\r\nand the world, I trust, is satisfied.\r\n\r\nWe see here, Mr. Chairman, the direct and actual application of that\r\nsystem which I have attempted to describe. We see it in the very case of\r\nGreece. We learn, authentically and indisputably, that the Allied\r\nPowers, holding that all changes in legislation and administration ought\r\nto proceed from kings alone, were wholly inexorable to the sufferings of\r\nthe Greeks, and entirely hostile to their success. Now it is upon this\r\npractical result of the principle of the Continental powers that I wish\r\nthis House to intimate its opinion. The great question is a question of\r\nprinciple. Greece is only the signal instance of the application of that\r\nprinciple. If the principle be right, if we esteem it conformable to the\r\nlaw of nations, if we have nothing to say against it, or if we deem\r\nourselves unfit to express an opinion on the subject, then, of course,\r\nno resolution ought to pass. If, on the other hand, we see in the\r\ndeclarations of the Allied Powers principles, not only utterly hostile\r\nto our own free institutions, but hostile also to the independence of\r\nall nations, and altogether opposed to the improvement of the condition\r\nof human nature; if, in the instance before us, we see a most striking\r\nexposition and application of those principles, and if we deem our\r\nopinions to be entitled to any weight in the estimation of\r\nmankind,--then I think it is our duty to adopt some such measure as the\r\nproposed resolution.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of observation, Sir, that as early as July, 1821, Baron\r\nStrogonoff, the Russian minister at Constantinople, represented to the\r\nPorte, that, if the undistinguished massacres of the Greeks, both of\r\nsuch as were in open resistance and of those who remained patient in\r\ntheir submission were continued, and should become a settled habit, they\r\nwould give just cause of war against the Porte to all Christian states.\r\nThis was in 1821.[6] It was followed, early in the next year, by that\r\nindescribable enormity, that appalling monument of barbarian cruelty,\r\nthe destruction of Scio; a scene I shall not attempt to describe; a\r\nscene from which human nature shrinks shuddering away; a scene having\r\nhardly a parallel in the history of fallen man. This scene, too, was\r\nquickly followed by the massacres in Cyprus; and all these things were\r\nperfectly known to the Christian powers assembled at Verona. Yet these\r\npowers, instead of acting upon the case supposed by Baron Strogonoff,\r\nand which one would think had been then fully made out,--instead of\r\nbeing moved by any compassion for the sufferings of the Greeks,--these\r\npowers, these Christian powers, rebuke their gallantry and insult their\r\nsufferings by accusing them of \"throwing a firebrand into the Ottoman\r\nempire.\" Such, Sir, appear to me to be the principles on which the\r\nContinental powers of Europe have agreed hereafter to act; and this, an\r\neminent instance of the application of those principles.\r\n\r\nI shall not detain the committee, Mr. Chairman, by any attempt to recite\r\nthe events of the Greek struggle up to the present time. Its origin may\r\nbe found, doubtless, in that improved state of knowledge which, for some\r\nyears, has been gradually taking place in that country. The emancipation\r\nof the Greeks has been a subject frequently discussed in modern times.\r\nThey themselves are represented as having a vivid remembrance of the\r\ndistinction of their ancestors, not unmixed with an indignant feeling\r\nthat civilized and Christian Europe should not ere now have aided them\r\nin breaking their intolerable fetters.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 a society was founded in Vienna for the encouragement of Grecian\r\nliterature. It was connected with a similar institution at Athens, and\r\nanother in Thessaly, called the \"Gymnasium of Mount Pelion.\" The\r\ntreasury and general office of the institution were established at\r\nMunich. No political object was avowed by these institutions, probably\r\nnone contemplated. Still, however, they had their effect, no doubt, in\r\nhastening that condition of things in which the Greeks felt competent to\r\nthe establishment of their independence. Many young men have been for\r\nyears annually sent to the universities in the western states of Europe\r\nfor their education; and, after the general pacification of Europe, many\r\nmilitary men, discharged from other employment, were ready to enter even\r\ninto so unpromising a service as that of the revolutionary Greeks.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, war commenced between the Porte and Ali, the well-known Pacha\r\nof Albania. Differences existed also with Persia and with Russia. In\r\nthis state of things, at the beginning of 1821, an insurrection broke\r\nout in Moldavia, under the direction of Alexander Ypsilanti, a\r\nwell-educated soldier, who had been major-general in the Russian\r\nservice. From his character, and the number of those who seemed inclined\r\nto join him, he was supposed to be countenanced by the court of St.\r\nPetersburg. This, however, was a great mistake, which the Emperor, then\r\nat Laybach, took an early opportunity to rectify. The Turkish government\r\nwas alarmed at these occurrences in the northern provinces of European\r\nTurkey, and caused search to be made of all vessels entering the Black\r\nSea, lest arms or other military means should be sent in that manner to\r\nthe insurgents. This proved inconvenient to the commerce of Russia, and\r\ncaused some unsatisfactory correspondence between the two powers. It may\r\nbe worthy of remark, as an exhibition of national character, that,\r\nagitated by these appearances of intestine commotion, the Sultan issued\r\na proclamation, calling on all true Mussulmans to renounce the pleasures\r\nof social life, to prepare arms and horses, and to return to the manner\r\nof their ancestors, the life of the plains. The Turk seems to have\r\nthought that he had, at last, caught something of the dangerous\r\ncontagion of European civilization, and that it was necessary to reform\r\nhis habits, by recurring to the original manners of military roving\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time, that is to say, at the commencement of 1821,\r\nthat the revolution burst out in various parts of Greece and the isles.\r\nCircumstances, certainly, were not unfavorable to the movement, as one\r\nportion of the Turkish army was employed in the war against Ali Pacha in\r\nAlbania, and another part in the provinces north of the Danube. The\r\nGreeks soon possessed themselves of the open country of the Morea, and\r\ndrove their enemy into the fortresses. Of these, that of Tripolitza,\r\nwith the city, fell into their hands, in the course of the summer.\r\nHaving after these first movements obtained time to breathe, it became,\r\nof course, an early object to establish a government. For this purpose\r\ndelegates of the people assembled, under that name which describes the\r\nassembly in which we ourselves sit, that name which \"freed the\r\nAtlantic,\" a _Congress_. A writer, who undertakes to render to the\r\ncivilized world that service which was once performed by Edmund Burke, I\r\nmean the compiler of the English Annual Register, asks, by what\r\nauthority this assembly could call itself a Congress. Simply, Sir, by\r\nthe same authority by which the people of the United States have given\r\nthe same name to their own legislature. We, at least, should be\r\nnaturally inclined to think, not only as far as names, but things also,\r\nare concerned, that the Greeks could hardly have begun their revolution\r\nunder better auspices; since they have endeavored to render applicable\r\nto themselves the general principles of our form of government, as well\r\nas its name. This constitution went into operation at the commencement\r\nof the next year. In the mean time, the war with Ali Pacha was ended, he\r\nhaving surrendered, and being afterwards assassinated, by an instance of\r\ntreachery and perfidy, which, if it had happened elsewhere than under\r\nthe government of the Turks, would have deserved notice. The negotiation\r\nwith Russia, too, took a turn unfavorable to the Greeks. The great point\r\nupon which Russia insisted, beside the abandonment of the measure of\r\nsearching vessels bound to the Black Sea, was, that the Porte should\r\nwithdraw its armies from the neighborhood of the Russian frontiers; and\r\nthe immediate consequence of this, when effected, was to add so much\r\nmore to the disposable force ready to be employed against the Greeks.\r\nThese events seemed to have left the whole force of the Ottoman empire,\r\nat the commencement of 1822, in a condition to be employed against the\r\nGreek rebellion; and, accordingly, very many anticipated the immediate\r\ndestruction of the cause. The event, however, was ordered otherwise.\r\nWhere the greatest effort was made, it was met and defeated. Entering\r\nthe Morea with an army which seemed capable of bearing down all\r\nresistance, the Turks were nevertheless defeated and driven back, and\r\npursued beyond the isthmus, within which, as far as it appears, from\r\nthat time to the present, they have not been able to set their foot.\r\n\r\nIt was in April of this year that the destruction of Scio took place.\r\nThat island, a sort of appanage of the Sultana mother, enjoyed many\r\nprivileges peculiar to itself. In a population of 130,000 or 140,000, it\r\nhad no more than 2,000 or 3,000 Turks; indeed, by some accounts, not\r\nnear as many. The absence of these ruffian masters had in some degree\r\nallowed opportunity for the promotion of knowledge, the accumulation of\r\nwealth, and the general cultivation of society. Here was the seat of\r\nmodern Greek literature; here were libraries, printing-presses, and\r\nother establishments, which indicate some advancement in refinement and\r\nknowledge. Certain of the inhabitants of Samos, it would seem, envious\r\nof this comparative happiness of Scio, landed upon the island in an\r\nirregular multitude, for the purpose of compelling its inhabitants to\r\nmake common cause with their countrymen against their oppressors. These,\r\nbeing joined by the peasantry, marched to the city and drove the Turks\r\ninto the castle. The Turkish fleet, lately reinforced from Egypt,\r\nhappened to be in the neighboring seas, and, learning these events,\r\nlanded a force on the island of fifteen thousand men. There was nothing\r\nto resist such an army. These troops immediately entered the city and\r\nbegan an indiscriminate massacre. The city was fired; and in four days\r\nthe fire and sword of the Turk rendered the beautiful Scio a clotted\r\nmass of blood and ashes. The details are too shocking to be recited.\r\nForty thousand women and children, unhappily saved from the general\r\ndestruction, were afterwards sold in the market of Smyrna, and sent off\r\ninto distant and hopeless servitude. Even on the wharves of our own\r\ncities, it has been said, have been sold the utensils of those hearths\r\nwhich now exist no longer. Of the whole population which I have\r\nmentioned, not above nine hundred persons were left living upon the\r\nisland. I will only repeat, Sir, that these tragical scenes were as\r\nfully known at the Congress of Verona, as they are now known to us; and\r\nit is not too much to call on the powers that constituted that congress,\r\nin the name of conscience and in the name of humanity, to tell us if\r\nthere be nothing even in these unparalleled excesses of Turkish\r\nbarbarity to excite a sentiment of compassion; nothing which they regard\r\nas so objectionable as even the very idea of popular resistance to\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe events of the year which has just passed by, as far as they have\r\nbecome known to us, have been even more favorable to the Greeks than\r\nthose of the year preceding. I omit all details, as being as well known\r\nto others as to myself. Suffice it to say, that with no other enemy to\r\ncontend with, and no diversion of his force to other objects, the Porte\r\nhas not been able to carry the war into the Morea; and that, by the last\r\naccounts, its armies were acting defensively in Thessaly. I pass over,\r\nalso, the naval engagements of the Greeks, although that is a mode of\r\nwarfare in which they are calculated to excel, and in which they have\r\nalready performed actions of such distinguished skill and bravery, as\r\nwould draw applause upon the best mariners in the world. The present\r\nstate of the war would seem to be, that the Greeks possess the whole of\r\nthe Morea with the exception of the three fortresses of Patras, Coron,\r\nand Modon; all Candia, but one fortress; and most of the other islands.\r\nThey possess the citadel of Athens, Missolonghi, and several other\r\nplaces in Livadia. They have been able to act on the offensive, and to\r\ncarry the war beyond the isthmus. There is no reason to believe their\r\nmarine is weakened; more probably, it is strengthened. But, what is most\r\nimportant of all, they have obtained time and experience. They have\r\nawakened a sympathy throughout Europe and throughout America; and they\r\nhave formed a government which seems suited to the emergency of their\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nSir, they have done much. It would be great injustice to compare their\r\nachievements with our own. We began our Revolution, already possessed of\r\ngovernment, and, comparatively, of civil liberty. Our ancestors had from\r\nthe first been accustomed in a great measure to govern themselves. They\r\nwere familiar with popular elections and legislative assemblies, and\r\nwell acquainted with the general principles and practice of free\r\ngovernments. They had little else to do than to throw off the paramount\r\nauthority of the parent state. Enough was still left, both of law and of\r\norganization, to conduct society in its accustomed course, and to unite\r\nmen together for a common object. The Greeks, of course, could act with\r\nlittle concert at the beginning; they were unaccustomed to the exercise\r\nof power, without experience, with limited knowledge, without aid, and\r\nsurrounded by nations which, whatever claims the Greeks might seem to\r\nhave upon them, have afforded them nothing but discouragement and\r\nreproach. They have held out, however, for three campaigns; and that, at\r\nleast, is something. Constantinople and the northern provinces have sent\r\nforth thousands of troops;--they have been defeated. Tripoli, and\r\nAlgiers, and Egypt, have contributed their marine contingents;--they\r\nhave not kept the ocean. Hordes of Tartars have crossed the\r\nBosphorus;--they have died where the Persians died. The powerful\r\nmonarchies in the neighborhood have denounced their cause, and\r\nadmonished them to abandon it and submit to their fate. They have\r\nanswered them, that, although two hundred thousand of their countrymen\r\nhave offered up their lives, there yet remain lives to offer; and that\r\nit is the determination of _all_, \"yes, of ALL,\" to persevere until they\r\nshall have established their liberty, or until the power of their\r\noppressors shall have relieved them from the burden of existence.\r\n\r\nIt may now be asked, perhaps, whether the expression of our own\r\nsympathy, and that of the country, may do them good? I hope it may. It\r\nmay give them courage and spirit, it may assure them of public regard,\r\nteach them that they are not wholly forgotten by the civilized world,\r\nand inspire them with constancy in the pursuit of their great end. At\r\nany rate, Sir, it appears to me that the measure which I have proposed\r\nis due to our own character, and called for by our own duty. When we\r\nshall have discharged that duty, we may leave the rest to the\r\ndisposition of Providence.\r\n\r\nI do not see how it can be doubted that this measure is entirely\r\n_pacific_. I profess my inability to perceive that it has any possible\r\ntendency to involve our neutral relations. If the resolution pass, it is\r\nnot of necessity to be immediately acted on. It will not be acted on at\r\nall, unless, in the opinion of the President, a proper and safe occasion\r\nfor acting upon it shall arise. If we adopt the resolution to-day, our\r\nrelations with every foreign state will be to-morrow precisely what they\r\nnow are. The resolution will be sufficient to express our sentiments on\r\nthe subjects to which I have adverted. Useful for that purpose, it can\r\nbe mischievous for no purpose. If the topic were properly introduced\r\ninto the message, it cannot be improperly introduced into discussion in\r\nthis House. If it were proper, which no one doubts, for the President to\r\nexpress his opinions upon it, it cannot, I think, be improper for us to\r\nexpress ours. The only certain effect of this resolution is to signify,\r\nin a form usual in bodies constituted like this, our approbation of the\r\ngeneral sentiment of the message. Do we wish to withhold that\r\napprobation? The resolution confers on the President no new power, nor\r\ndoes it enjoin on him the exercise of any new duty; nor does it hasten\r\nhim in the discharge of any existing duty.\r\n\r\nI cannot imagine that this resolution can add any thing to those\r\nexcitements which it has been supposed, I think very causelessly, might\r\npossibly provoke the Turkish government to acts of hostility. There is\r\nalready the message, expressing the hope of success to the Greeks and\r\ndisaster to the Turks, in a much stronger manner than is to be implied\r\nfrom the terms of this resolution. There is the correspondence between\r\nthe Secretary of State and the Greek Agent in London, already made\r\npublic, in which similar wishes are expressed, and a continuance of the\r\ncorrespondence apparently invited. I might add to this, the unexampled\r\nburst of feeling which this cause has called forth from all classes of\r\nsociety, and the notorious fact of pecuniary contributions made\r\nthroughout the country for its aid and advancement. After all this,\r\nwhoever can see cause of danger to our pacific relations from the\r\nadoption of this resolution has a keener vision than I can pretend to.\r\nSir, there is no augmented danger; there is no danger. The question\r\ncomes at last to this, whether, on a subject of this sort, this House\r\nholds an opinion which is worthy to be expressed.\r\n\r\nEven suppose, Sir, an agent or commissioner were to be immediately\r\nsent,--a measure which I myself believe to be the proper one,--there is\r\nno breach of neutrality, nor any just cause of offence. Such an agent,\r\nof course, would not be accredited; he would not be a public minister.\r\nThe object would be inquiry and information; inquiry which we have a\r\nright to make, information which we are interested to possess. If a\r\ndismemberment of the Turkish empire be taking place, or has already\r\ntaken place; if a new state be rising, or be already risen, in the\r\nMediterranean,--who can doubt, that, without any breach of neutrality,\r\nwe may inform ourselves of these events for the government of our own\r\nconcerns? The Greeks have declared the Turkish coasts in a state of\r\nblockade; may we not inform ourselves whether this blockade be _nominal_\r\nor _real_? and, of course, whether it shall be regarded or disregarded?\r\nThe greater our trade may happen to be with Smyrna, a consideration\r\nwhich seems to have alarmed some gentlemen, the greater is the reason,\r\nin my opinion, why we should seek to be accurately informed of those\r\nevents which may affect its safety. It seems to me impossible,\r\ntherefore, for any reasonable man to imagine that this resolution can\r\nexpose us to the resentment of the Sublime Porte.\r\n\r\nAs little reason is there for fearing its consequences upon the conduct\r\nof the Allied Powers. They may, very naturally, dislike our sentiments\r\nupon the subject of the Greek revolution; but what those sentiments are\r\nthey will much more explicitly learn in the President's message than in\r\nthis resolution. They might, indeed, prefer that we should express no\r\ndissent from the doctrines which they have avowed, and the application\r\nwhich they have made of those doctrines to the case of Greece. But I\r\ntrust we are not disposed to leave them in any doubt as to our\r\nsentiments upon these important subjects. They have expressed their\r\nopinions, and do not call that expression of opinion an interference;\r\nin which respect they are right, as the expression of opinion in such\r\ncases is not such an interference as would justify the Greeks in\r\nconsidering the powers at war with them. For the same reason, any\r\nexpression which we may make of different principles and different\r\nsympathies is no interference. No one would call the President's message\r\nan interference; and yet it is much stronger in that respect than this\r\nresolution. If either of them could be construed to be an interference,\r\nno doubt it would be improper, at least it would be so according to my\r\nview of the subject; for the very thing which I have attempted to resist\r\nin the course of these observations is the right of foreign\r\ninterference. But neither the message nor the resolution has that\r\ncharacter. There is not a power in Europe which can suppose, that, in\r\nexpressing our opinions on this occasion, we are governed by any desire\r\nof aggrandizing ourselves or of injuring others. We do no more than to\r\nmaintain those established principles in which we have an interest in\r\ncommon with other nations, and to resist the introduction of new\r\nprinciples and new rules, calculated to destroy the relative\r\nindependence of states, and particularly hostile to the whole fabric of\r\nour government.\r\n\r\nI close, then, Sir, with repeating, that the object of this resolution\r\nis to avail ourselves of the interesting occasion of the Greek\r\nrevolution to make our protest against the doctrines of the Allied\r\nPowers, both as they are laid down in principle and as they are applied\r\nin practice. I think it right, too, Sir, not to be unseasonable in the\r\nexpression of our regard, and, as far as that goes, in a manifestation\r\nof our sympathy with a long oppressed and now struggling people. I am\r\nnot of those who would, in the hour of utmost peril, withhold such\r\nencouragement as might be properly and lawfully given, and, when the\r\ncrisis should be past, overwhelm the rescued sufferer with kindness and\r\ncaresses. The Greeks address the civilized world with a pathos not easy\r\nto be resisted. They invoke our favor by more moving considerations than\r\ncan well belong to the condition of any other people. They stretch out\r\ntheir arms to the Christian communities of the earth, beseeching them,\r\nby a generous recollection of their ancestors, by the consideration of\r\ntheir desolated and ruined cities and villages, by their wives and\r\nchildren sold into an accursed slavery, by their blood, which they seem\r\nwilling to pour out like water, by the common faith, and in the name,\r\nwhich unites all Christians, that they would extend to them at least\r\nsome token of compassionate regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The interior of the hall of the House of Representatives is\r\nsurrounded by a magnificent colonnade of the composite order.

The object of the bill was a comprehensive\r\nrevision of the existing laws, with a view to the extension of the\r\nprotective system. The bill became the subject of a protracted debate,\r\nin which much of the talent of the House on both sides was engaged. Mr.\r\nWebster took an active part in the discussion, and spoke upon many of\r\nthe details of the bill, while it remained in the committee of the whole\r\nHouse on the state of the Union. Several objectionable provisions were\r\nremoved, and various amendments were introduced upon his motion; and it\r\nwas a matter of regret to him, as seen in the following speech, that the\r\nfriends of the bill were not able or willing to bring it into a form in\r\nwhich, as a whole, he could give it his support. On the 30th and 31st of\r\nMarch, Mr. Clay, Speaker of the House, addressed the committee of the\r\nwhole, at length and with great ability, on the general principles of\r\nthe bill; and he was succeeded by Mr. Webster, on the 1st and 2d of\r\nApril, in the following speech.]\r\n\r\nMR. CHAIRMAN,--I will avail myself of the present occasion to make some\r\nremarks on certain principles and opinions which have been recently\r\nadvanced, and on those considerations which, in my judgment, ought to\r\ngovern us in deciding upon the several and respective parts of this very\r\nimportant and complex measure. I can truly say that this is a painful\r\nduty. I deeply regret the necessity which is likely to be imposed upon\r\nme of giving a general affirmative or negative vote on the whole of the\r\nbill. I cannot but think this mode of proceeding liable to great\r\nobjections. It exposes both those who support and those who oppose the\r\nmeasure to very unjust and injurious misapprehensions. There may be good\r\nreasons for favoring some of the provisions of the bill, and equally\r\nstrong reasons for opposing others; and these provisions do not stand to\r\neach other in the relation of principal and incident. If that were the\r\ncase, those who are in favor of the principal might forego their\r\nopinions upon incidental and subordinate provisions. But the bill\r\nproposes enactments entirely distinct and different from one another in\r\ncharacter and tendency. Some of its clauses are intended merely for\r\nrevenue; and of those which regard the protection of home manufactures,\r\none part stands upon very different grounds from those of other parts.\r\nSo that probably every gentleman who may ultimately support the bill\r\nwill vote for much which his judgment does not approve; and those who\r\noppose it will oppose something which they would very gladly support.\r\n\r\nBeing intrusted with the interests of a district highly commercial, and\r\ndeeply interested in manufactures also, I wish to state my opinions on\r\nthe present measure, not as on a whole, for it has no entire and\r\nhomogeneous character, but as on a collection of different enactments,\r\nsome of which meet my approbation and some of which do not.\r\n\r\nAnd allow me, Sir, in the first place, to state my regret, if indeed I\r\nought not to express a warmer sentiment, at the names or designations\r\nwhich Mr. Speaker[1] has seen fit to adopt for the purpose of describing\r\nthe advocates and the opposers of the present bill. It is a question, he\r\nsays, between the friends of an \"American policy\" and those of a\r\n\"foreign policy.\" This, Sir, is an assumption which I take the liberty\r\nmost directly to deny. Mr. Speaker certainly intended nothing invidious\r\nor derogatory to any part of the House by this mode of denominating\r\nfriends and enemies. But there is power in names, and this manner of\r\ndistinguishing those who favor and those who oppose particular measures\r\nmay lead to inferences to which no member of the House can submit. It\r\nmay imply that there is a more exclusive and peculiar regard to American\r\ninterests in one class of opinions than in another. Such an implication\r\nis to be resisted and repelled. Every member has a right to the\r\npresumption, that he pursues what he believes to be the interest of his\r\ncountry with as sincere a zeal as any other member. I claim this in my\r\nown case; and while I shall not, for any purpose of description or\r\nconvenient arrangement use terms which may imply any disrespect to other\r\nmen's opinions, much less any imputation upon other men's motives, it is\r\nmy duty to take care that the use of such terms by others be not,\r\nagainst the will of those who adopt them, made to produce a false\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Sir, it is a little astonishing, if it seemed convenient to Mr.\r\nSpeaker, for the purposes of distinction, to make use of the terms\r\n\"American policy\" and \"foreign policy,\" that he should not have applied\r\nthem in a manner precisely the reverse of that in which he has in fact\r\nused them. If names are thought necessary, it would be well enough, one\r\nwould think, that the name should be in some measure descriptive of the\r\nthing; and since Mr. Speaker denominates the policy which he recommends\r\n\"a new policy in this country\"; since he speaks of the present measure\r\nas a new era in our legislation; since he professes to invite us to\r\ndepart from our accustomed course, to instruct ourselves by the wisdom\r\nof others, and to adopt the policy of the most distinguished foreign\r\nstates,--one is a little curious to know with what propriety of speech\r\nthis imitation of other nations is denominated an \"American policy,\"\r\nwhile, on the contrary, a preference for our own established system, as\r\nit now actually exists and always has existed, is called a \"foreign\r\npolicy.\" This favorite American policy is what America has never tried;\r\nand this odious foreign policy is what, as we are told, foreign states\r\nhave never pursued. Sir, that is the truest American policy which shall\r\nmost usefully employ American capital and American labor, and best\r\nsustain the whole population. With me it is a fundamental axiom, it is\r\ninterwoven with all my opinions, that the great interests of the country\r\nare united and inseparable; that agriculture, commerce, and manufactures\r\nwill prosper together or languish together; and that all legislation is\r\ndangerous which proposes to benefit one of these without looking to\r\nconsequences which may fall on the others.\r\n\r\nPassing from this, Sir, I am bound to say that Mr. Speaker began his\r\nable and impressive speech at the proper point of inquiry,--I mean the\r\npresent state and condition of the country,--although I am so\r\nunfortunate, or rather although I am so happy, as to differ from him\r\nvery widely in regard to that condition. I dissent entirely from the\r\njustice of that picture of distress which he has drawn. I have not seen\r\nthe reality, and know not where it exists. Within my observation, there\r\nis no cause for so gloomy and terrifying a representation. In respect to\r\nthe New England States, with the condition of which I am of course best\r\nacquainted, the present appears to me a period of very general\r\nprosperity. Not, indeed, a time for sudden acquisition and great\r\nprofits, not a day of extraordinary activity and successful\r\nspeculation. There is no doubt a considerable depression of prices, and,\r\nin some degree, a stagnation of business. But the case presented by Mr.\r\nSpeaker was not one of _depression_, but of _distress_; of universal,\r\npervading, intense distress, limited to no class and to no place. We are\r\nrepresented as on the very verge and brink of national ruin. So far from\r\nacquiescing in these opinions, I believe there has been no period in\r\nwhich the general prosperity was better secured, or rested on a more\r\nsolid foundation. As applicable to the Eastern States, I put this remark\r\nto their representatives, and ask them if it is not true. When has there\r\nbeen a time in which the means of living have been more accessible and\r\nmore abundant? When has labor been rewarded, I do not say with a larger,\r\nbut with a more certain success? Profits, indeed, are low; in some\r\npursuits of life, which it is not proposed to benefit, but to _burden_,\r\nby this bill, very low. But still I am unacquainted with any proofs of\r\nextraordinary distress. What, indeed, are the general indications of the\r\nstate of the country? There is no famine nor pestilence in the land, nor\r\nwar, nor desolation. There is no writhing under the burden of taxation.\r\nThe means of subsistence are abundant; and at the very moment when the\r\nmiserable condition of the country is asserted, it is admitted that the\r\nwages of labor are high in comparison with those of any other country. A\r\ncountry, then, enjoying a profound peace, perfect civil liberty, with\r\nthe means of subsistence cheap and abundant, with the reward of labor\r\nsure, and its wages higher than anywhere else, cannot be represented as\r\nin gloom, melancholy, and distress, but by the effort of extraordinary\r\npowers of tragedy.\r\n\r\nEven if, in judging of this question, we were to regard only those\r\nproofs to which we have been referred, we shall probably come to a\r\nconclusion somewhat different from that which has been drawn. Our\r\nexports, for example, although certainly less than in some years, were\r\nnot, last year, so much below an average formed upon the exports of a\r\nseries of years, and putting those exports at a fixed value, as might be\r\nsupposed. The value of the exports of agricultural products, of animals,\r\nof the products of the forest and of the sea, together with gunpowder,\r\nspirits, and sundry unenumerated articles, amounted in the several years\r\nto the following sums, viz.:--\r\n\r\nIn 1790,    $27,716,152\r\n   1804,     33,842,316\r\n   1807,     38,465,854\r\n\r\nComing up now to our own times, and taking the exports of the years\r\n1821, 1822, and 1823, of the same articles and products, at the same\r\nprices, they stand thus:--\r\n\r\nIn 1821,    $45,643,175\r\n   1822,     48,782,295\r\n   1823,     55,863,491\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker has taken the very extraordinary year of 1803, and, adding\r\nto the exportation of that year what he thinks ought to have been a just\r\naugmentation, in proportion to the increase of our population, he swells\r\nthe result to a magnitude, which, when compared with our actual exports,\r\nwould exhibit a great deficiency. But is there any justice in this mode\r\nof calculation? In the first place, as before observed, the year 1803\r\nwas a year of extraordinary exportation. By reference to the accounts,\r\nthat of the article of flour, for example, there was an export that year\r\nof thirteen hundred thousand barrels; but the very next year it fell to\r\neight hundred thousand, and the next year to seven hundred thousand. In\r\nthe next place, there never was any reason to expect that the increase\r\nof our exports of agricultural products would keep pace with the\r\nincrease of our population. That would be against all experience. It is,\r\nindeed, most desirable, that there should be an augmented demand for the\r\nproducts of agriculture; but, nevertheless, the official returns of our\r\nexports do not show that absolute want of all foreign market which has\r\nbeen so strongly stated.\r\n\r\nBut there are other means by which to judge of the general condition of\r\nthe people. The quantity of the means of subsistence consumed, or, to\r\nmake use of a phraseology better suited to the condition of our own\r\npeople, the quantity of the comforts of life enjoyed, is one of those\r\nmeans. It so happens, indeed, that it is not so easy in this country as\r\nelsewhere to ascertain facts of this sort with accuracy. Where most of\r\nthe articles of subsistence and most of the comforts of life are taxed,\r\nthere is, of course, great facility in ascertaining, from official\r\nstatements, the amount of consumption. But in this country, most\r\nfortunately, the government neither knows, nor is concerned to know, the\r\nannual consumption; and estimates can only be formed in another mode,\r\nand in reference only to a few articles. Of these articles, tea is one.\r\nIt is not quite a luxury, and yet is something above the absolute\r\nnecessaries of life. Its consumption, therefore, will be diminished in\r\ntimes of adversity, and augmented in times of prosperity. By deducting\r\nthe annual export from the annual import, and taking a number of years\r\ntogether, we may arrive at a probable estimate of consumption. The\r\naverage of eleven years, from 1790 to 1800, inclusive, will be found to\r\nbe two millions and a half of pounds. From 1801 to 1812, inclusive, the\r\naverage was three millions seven hundred thousand; and the average of\r\nthe last three years, to wit, 1821, 1822, and 1823, was five millions\r\nand a half. Having made a just allowance for the increase of our\r\nnumbers, we shall still find, I think, from these statements, that there\r\nis no distress which has limited our means of subsistence and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nIn forming an opinion of the degree of general prosperity, we may\r\nregard, likewise, the progress of internal improvements, the investment\r\nof capital in roads, bridges, and canals. All these prove a balance of\r\nincome over expenditure; they afford evidence that there is a surplus of\r\nprofits, which the present generation is usefully vesting for the\r\nbenefit of the next. It cannot be denied, that, in this particular, the\r\nprogress of the country is steady and rapid.\r\n\r\nWe may look, too, to the sums expended for education. Are our colleges\r\ndeserted? Do fathers find themselves less able than usual to educate\r\ntheir children? It will be found, I imagine, that the amount paid for\r\nthe purpose of education is constantly increasing, and that the schools\r\nand colleges were never more full than at the present moment. I may add,\r\nthat the endowment of public charities, the contributions to objects of\r\ngeneral benevolence, whether foreign or domestic, the munificence of\r\nindividuals towards whatever promises to benefit the community, are all\r\nso many proofs of national prosperity. And, finally, there is no\r\ndefalcation of revenue, no pressure of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe general result, therefore, of a fair examination of the present\r\ncondition of things, seems to me to be, that there is a considerable\r\ndepression of prices, and curtailment of profit; and in some parts of\r\nthe country, it must be admitted, there is a great degree of pecuniary\r\nembarrassment, arising from the difficulty of paying debts which were\r\ncontracted when prices were high. With these qualifications, the general\r\nstate of the country may be said to be prosperous; and these are not\r\nsufficient to give to the whole face of affairs any appearance of\r\ngeneral distress.\r\n\r\nSupposing the evil, then, to be a depression of prices, and a partial\r\npecuniary pressure, the next inquiry is into the causes of that evil;\r\nand it appears to me that there are several; and in this respect, I\r\nthink, too much has been imputed by Mr. Speaker to the single cause of\r\nthe diminution of exports. Connected, as we are, with all the commercial\r\nnations of the world, and having observed great changes to take place\r\nelsewhere, we should consider whether the causes of those changes have\r\nnot reached us, and whether we are not suffering by the operation of\r\nthem, in common with others. Undoubtedly, there has been a great fall in\r\nthe price of all commodities throughout the commercial world, in\r\nconsequence of the restoration of a state of peace. When the Allies\r\nentered France in 1814, prices rose astonishingly fast, and very high.\r\nColonial produce, for instance, in the ports of this country, as well as\r\nelsewhere, sprung up suddenly from the lowest to the highest extreme. A\r\nnew and vast demand was created for the commodities of trade. These were\r\nthe natural consequences of the great political changes which then took\r\nplace in Europe.\r\n\r\nWe are to consider, too, that our own war created new demand, and that a\r\ngovernment expenditure of twenty-five or thirty million dollars a year\r\nhad the usual effect of enhancing prices. We are obliged to add, that\r\nthe paper issues of our banks carried the same effect still further. A\r\ndepreciated currency existed in a great part of the country; depreciated\r\nto such an extent, that, at one time, exchange between the centre and\r\nthe North was as high as twenty per cent. The Bank of the United States\r\nwas instituted to correct this evil; but, for causes which it is not\r\nnecessary now to enumerate, it did not for some years bring back the\r\ncurrency of the country to a sound state. This depreciation of the\r\ncirculating currency was so much, of course, added to the nominal prices\r\nof commodities, and these prices, thus unnaturally high, seemed, to\r\nthose who looked only at the appearance, to indicate great prosperity.\r\nBut such prosperity is more specious than real. It would have been\r\nbetter, probably, as the shock would have been less, if prices had\r\nfallen sooner. At length, however, they fell; and as there is little\r\ndoubt that certain events in Europe had an influence in determining the\r\ntime at which this fall took place, I will advert shortly to some of the\r\nprincipal of those events.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1819, the British House of Commons decided, by a unanimous vote,\r\nthat the resumption of cash payments by the Bank of England should not\r\nbe deferred beyond the ensuing February. The restriction had been\r\ncontinued from time to time, and from year to year, Parliament always\r\nprofessing to look to the restoration of a specie currency whenever it\r\nshould be found practicable. Having been, in July, 1818, continued to\r\nJuly, 1819, it was understood that, in the interim, the important\r\nquestion of the time at which cash payments should be resumed should be\r\nfinally settled. In the latter part of the year 1818, the circulation of\r\nthe bank had been greatly reduced, and a severe scarcity of money was\r\nfelt in the London market. Such was the state of things in England. On\r\nthe Continent, other important events took place. The French Indemnity\r\nLoan had been negotiated in the summer of 1818, and the proportion of it\r\nbelonging to Austria, Russia, and Prussia had been sold. This created an\r\nunusual demand for gold and silver in those countries. It has been\r\nstated, that the amount of the precious metals transmitted to Austria\r\nand Russia in that year was at least twenty millions sterling. Other\r\nlarge sums were sent to Prussia and to Denmark. The effect of this\r\nsudden drain of specie, felt first at Paris, was communicated to\r\nAmsterdam and Hamburg, and all other commercial places in the North of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe paper system of England had certainly communicated an artificial\r\nvalue to property. It had encouraged speculation, and excited\r\nover-trading. When the shock therefore came, and this violent pressure\r\nfor money acted at the same moment on the Continent and in England,\r\ninflated and unnatural prices could be kept up no longer. A reduction\r\ntook place, which has been estimated to have been at least equal to a\r\nfall of thirty, if not forty per cent. The depression was universal; and\r\nthe change was felt in the United States severely, though not equally so\r\nin every part. There are those, I am aware, who maintain that the events\r\nto which I have alluded did not cause the great fall of prices, but that\r\nthat fall was natural and inevitable, from the previously existing state\r\nof things, the abundance of commodities, and the want of demand. But\r\nthat would only prove that the effect was produced in another way,\r\nrather than by another cause. If these great and sudden calls for money\r\ndid not reduce prices, but prices fell, as of themselves, to their\r\nnatural state, still the result is the same; for we perceive that, after\r\nthese new calls for money, prices could not be kept longer at their\r\nunnatural height.\r\n\r\nAbout the time of these foreign events, our own bank system underwent a\r\nchange; and all these causes, in my view of the subject, concurred to\r\nproduce the great shock which took place in our commercial cities, and\r\nin many parts of the country. The year 1819 was a year of numerous\r\nfailures, and very considerable distress, and would have furnished far\r\nbetter grounds than exist at present for that gloomy representation of\r\nour condition which has been presented. Mr. Speaker has alluded to the\r\nstrong inclination which exists, or has existed, in various parts of the\r\ncountry, to issue paper money, as a proof of great existing\r\ndifficulties. I regard it rather as a very productive cause of those\r\ndifficulties; and the committee will not fail to observe, that there is,\r\nat this moment, much the loudest complaint of distress precisely where\r\nthere has been the greatest attempt to relieve it by systems of paper\r\ncredit. And, on the other hand, content, prosperity, and happiness are\r\nmost observable in those parts of the country where there has been the\r\nleast endeavor to administer relief by law. In truth, nothing is so\r\nbaneful, so utterly ruinous to all true industry, as interfering with\r\nthe legal value of money, or attempting to raise artificial standards to\r\nsupply its place. Such remedies suit well the spirit of extravagant\r\nspeculation, but they sap the very foundation of all honest acquisition.\r\nBy weakening the security of property, they take away all motive for\r\nexertion. Their effect is to transfer property. Whenever a debt is\r\nallowed to be paid by any thing less valuable than the legal currency in\r\nrespect to which it was contracted, the difference between the value of\r\nthe paper given in payment and the legal currency is precisely so much\r\nproperty taken from one man and given to another, by legislative\r\nenactment.\r\n\r\nWhen we talk, therefore, of protecting industry, let us remember that\r\nthe first measure for that end is to secure it in its earnings; to\r\nassure it that it shall receive its own. Before we invent new modes of\r\nraising prices, let us take care that existing prices are not rendered\r\nwholly unavailable, by making them capable of being paid in depreciated\r\npaper. I regard, Sir, this issue of irredeemable paper as the most\r\nprominent and deplorable cause of whatever pressure still exists in the\r\ncountry; and, further, I would put the question to the members of this\r\ncommittee, whether it is not from that part of the people who have tried\r\nthis paper system, and tried it to their cost, that this bill receives\r\nthe most earnest support? And I cannot forbear to ask, further, whether\r\nthis support does not proceed rather from a general feeling of\r\nuneasiness under the present condition of things, than from the clear\r\nperception of any benefit which the measure itself can confer? Is not\r\nall expectation of advantage centred in a sort of vague hope, that\r\nchange may produce relief? Debt certainly presses hardest where prices\r\nhave been longest kept up by artificial means. They find the shock\r\nlightest who take it soonest; and I fully believe that, if those parts\r\nof the country which now suffer most had not augmented the force of the\r\nblow by deferring it, they would have now been in a much better\r\ncondition than they are. We may assure ourselves, once for all, Sir,\r\nthat there can be no such thing as payment of debts by legislation. We\r\nmay abolish debts indeed; we may transfer property by visionary and\r\nviolent laws. But we deceive both ourselves and our constituents, if we\r\nflatter either ourselves or them with the hope that there is any relief\r\nagainst whatever pressure exists, but in economy and industry. The\r\ndepression of prices and the stagnation of business have been in truth\r\nthe necessary result of circumstances. No government could prevent them,\r\nand no government can altogether relieve the people from their effect.\r\nWe have enjoyed a day of extraordinary prosperity; we had been neutral\r\nwhile the world was at war, and had found a great demand for our\r\nproducts, our navigation, and our labor. We had no right to expect that\r\nthat state of things would continue always. With the return of peace,\r\nforeign nations would struggle for themselves, and enter into\r\ncompetition with us in the great objects of pursuit.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, what is the remedy for existing evils? What is the course of\r\npolicy suited to our actual condition? Certainly it is not our wisdom to\r\nadopt any system that may be offered to us, without examination, and in\r\nthe blind hope that whatever changes our condition may improve it. It is\r\nbetter that we should\r\n\r\n                \"bear those ills we have,\r\n    Than fly to others that we know not of.\"\r\n\r\nWe are bound to see that there is a fitness and an aptitude in whatever\r\nmeasures may be recommended to relieve the evils that afflict us; and\r\nbefore we adopt a system that professes to make great alterations, it is\r\nour duty to look carefully to each leading interest of the community,\r\nand see how it may probably be affected by our proposed legislation.\r\n\r\nAnd, in the first place, what is the condition of our commerce? Here we\r\nmust clearly perceive, that it is not enjoying that rich harvest which\r\nfell to its fortune during the continuance of the European wars. It has\r\nbeen greatly depressed, and limited to small profits. Still, it is\r\nelastic and active, and seems capable of recovering itself in some\r\nmeasure from its depression. The shipping interest, also, has suffered\r\nseverely, still more severely, probably, than commerce. If any thing\r\nshould strike us with astonishment, it is that the navigation of the\r\nUnited States should be able to sustain itself. Without any government\r\nprotection whatever, it goes abroad to challenge competition with the\r\nwhole world; and, in spite of all obstacles, it has yet been able to\r\nmaintain eight hundred thousand tons in the employment of foreign trade.\r\nHow, Sir, do the ship-owners and navigators accomplish this? How is it\r\nthat they are able to meet, and in some measure overcome, universal\r\ncompetition? It is not, Sir, by protection and bounties: but by\r\nunwearied exertion, by extreme economy, by unshaken perseverance, by\r\nthat manly and resolute spirit which relies on itself to protect itself.\r\nThese causes alone enable American ships still to keep their element,\r\nand show the flag of their country in distant seas. The rates of\r\ninsurance may teach us how thoroughly our ships are built, and how\r\nskilfully and safely they are navigated. Risks are taken, as I learn,\r\nfrom the United States to Liverpool, at one per cent; and from the\r\nUnited States to Canton and back, as low as three per cent. But when we\r\nlook to the low rate of freight, and when we consider, also, that the\r\narticles entering into the composition of a ship, with the exception of\r\nwood, are dearer here than in other countries, we cannot but be utterly\r\nsurprised that the shipping interest has been able to sustain itself at\r\nall. I need not say that the navigation of the country is essential to\r\nits honor and its defence. Yet, instead of proposing benefits for it in\r\nthis hour of its depression, we threaten by this measure to lay upon it\r\nnew and heavy burdens. In the discussion, the other day, of that\r\nprovision of the bill which proposes to tax tallow for the benefit of\r\nthe oil-merchants and whalemen, we had the pleasure of hearing eloquent\r\neulogiums upon that portion of our shipping employed in the\r\nwhale-fishery, and strong statements of its importance to the public\r\ninterest. But the same bill proposes a severe tax upon that interest,\r\nfor the benefit of the iron-manufacturer and the hemp-grower. So that\r\nthe tallow-chandlers and soapboilers are sacrificed to the\r\noil-merchants, in order that these again may contribute to the\r\nmanufacturers of iron and the growers of hemp.\r\n\r\nIf such be the state of our commerce and navigation, what is the\r\ncondition of our home manufactures? How are they amidst the general\r\ndepression? Do they need further protection? and if any, how much? On\r\nall these points, we have had much general statement, but little\r\nprecise information. In the very elaborate speech of Mr. Speaker, we are\r\nnot supplied with satisfactory grounds of judging with respect to these\r\nvarious particulars. Who can tell, from any thing yet before the\r\ncommittee, whether the proposed duty be too high or too low on any one\r\narticle? Gentlemen tell us, that they are in favor of domestic industry;\r\nso am I. They would give it protection; so would I. But then all\r\ndomestic industry is not confined to manufactures. The employments of\r\nagriculture, commerce, and navigation are all branches of the same\r\ndomestic industry; they all furnish employment for American capital and\r\nAmerican labor. And when the question is, whether new duties shall be\r\nlaid, for the purpose of giving further encouragement to particular\r\nmanufactures, every reasonable man must ask himself, both whether the\r\nproposed new encouragement be necessary, and whether it can be given\r\nwithout injustice to other branches of industry.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to know, also, somewhat more distinctly, how the\r\nproposed means will produce the intended effect. One great object\r\nproposed, for example, is the increase of the home market for the\r\nconsumption of agricultural products. This certainly is much to be\r\ndesired; but what provisions of the bill are expected wholly or\r\nprincipally to produce this, is not stated. I would not deny that some\r\nincrease of the home market may follow, from the adoption of this bill,\r\nbut all its provisions have not an equal tendency to produce this\r\neffect. Those manufactures which employ most labor, create, of course,\r\nmost demand for articles of consumption; and those create least in the\r\nproduction of which capital and skill enter as the chief ingredients of\r\ncost. I cannot, Sir, take this bill merely because a committee has\r\nrecommended it. I cannot espouse a side, and fight under a flag. I\r\nwholly repel the idea that we must take this law, or pass no law on the\r\nsubject. What should hinder us from exercising our own judgments upon\r\nthese provisions, singly and severally? Who has the power to place us,\r\nor why should we place ourselves, in a condition where we cannot give to\r\nevery measure, that is distinct and separate in itself, a separate and\r\ndistinct consideration? Sir, I presume no member of the committee will\r\nwithhold his assent from what he thinks right, until others will yield\r\ntheir assent to what they think wrong. There are many things in this\r\nbill acceptable, probably, to the general sense of the House. Why should\r\nnot these provisions be passed into a law, and others left to be decided\r\nupon their own merits, as a majority of the House shall see fit? To some\r\nof these provisions I am myself decidedly favorable; to others I have\r\ngreat objections; and I should have been very glad of an opportunity of\r\ngiving my own vote distinctly on propositions which are, in their own\r\nnature, essentially and substantially distinct from one another.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, before expressing my own opinion upon the several provisions\r\nof this bill, I will advert for a moment to some other general topics.\r\nWe have heard much of the policy of England, and her example has been\r\nrepeatedly urged upon us, as proving, not only the expediency of\r\nencouragement and protection, but of exclusion and direct prohibition\r\nalso. I took occasion the other day to remark, that more liberal notions\r\nwere becoming prevalent on this subject; that the policy of restraints\r\nand prohibitions was getting out of repute, as the true nature of\r\ncommerce became better understood; and that, among public men, those\r\nmost distinguished were most decided in their reprobation of the broad\r\nprinciple of exclusion and prohibition. Upon the truth of this\r\nrepresentation, as matter of fact, I supposed there could not be two\r\nopinions among those who had observed the progress of political\r\nsentiment in other countries, and were acquainted with its present\r\nstate. In this respect, however, it would seem that I was greatly\r\nmistaken. We have heard it again and again declared, that the English\r\ngovernment still adheres, with immovable firmness, to its old doctrines\r\nof prohibition; that although journalists, theorists, and scientific\r\nwriters advance other doctrines, yet the practical men, the legislators,\r\nthe government of the country, are too wise to follow them. It has even\r\nbeen most sagaciously hinted, that the promulgation of liberal opinions\r\non these subjects is intended only to delude other governments, to\r\ncajole them into the folly of liberal ideas, while England retains to\r\nherself all the benefits of the admirable old system of prohibition. We\r\nhave heard from Mr. Speaker a warm commendation of the complex mechanism\r\nof this system. The British empire, it is said, is, in the first place,\r\nto be protected against the rest of the world; then the British Isles\r\nagainst the colonies; next, the isles respectively against each other,\r\nEngland herself, as the heart of the empire, being protected most of\r\nall, and against all.\r\n\r\nTruly, Sir, it appears to me that Mr. Speaker's imagination has seen\r\nsystem, and order, and beauty, in that which is much more justly\r\nconsidered as the result of ignorance, partiality, or violence. This\r\npart of English legislation has resulted, partly from considering\r\nIreland as a conquered country, partly from the want of a complete\r\nunion, even with Scotland, and partly from the narrow views of colonial\r\nregulation, which in early and uninformed periods influenced the\r\nEuropean states.\r\n\r\nNothing, I imagine, would strike the public men of England more\r\nsingularly, than to find gentlemen of real information and much weight\r\nin the councils of this country expressing sentiments like these, in\r\nregard to the existing state of these English laws. I have never said,\r\nindeed, that prohibitory laws do not exist in England; we all know they\r\ndo; but the question is, Does she owe her prosperity and greatness to\r\nthese laws? I venture to say, that such is not the opinion of public men\r\nnow in England, and the continuance of the laws, even without any\r\nalteration, would not be evidence that their opinion is different from\r\nwhat I have represented it; because the laws having existed long, and\r\ngreat interests having been built up on the faith of them, they cannot\r\nnow be repealed without great and overwhelming inconvenience. Because a\r\nthing has been wrongly done, it does not therefore follow that it can\r\nnow be undone; and this is the reason, as I understand it, for which\r\nexclusion, prohibition, and monopoly are suffered to remain in any\r\ndegree in the English system; and for the same reason, it will be wise\r\nin us to take our measures, on all subjects of this kind, with great\r\ncaution. We may not be able, but at the hazard of much injury to\r\nindividuals, hereafter to retrace our steps. And yet, whatever is\r\nextravagant or unreasonable is not likely to endure. There may come a\r\nmoment of strong reaction; and if no moderation be shown in laying on\r\nduties, there may be as little scruple in taking them off.\r\n\r\nIt may be here observed, that there is a broad and marked distinction\r\nbetween entire prohibition and reasonable encouragement. It is one\r\nthing, by duties or taxes on foreign articles, to awaken a home\r\ncompetition in the production of the same articles; it is another thing\r\nto remove all competition by a total exclusion of the foreign article;\r\nand it is quite another thing still, by total prohibition, to raise up\r\nat home manufactures not suited to the climate, the nature of the\r\ncountry, or the state of the population. These are substantial\r\ndistinctions, and although it may not be easy in every case to determine\r\nwhich of them applies to a given article, yet the distinctions\r\nthemselves exist, and in most cases will be sufficiently clear to\r\nindicate the true course of policy; and, unless I have greatly mistaken\r\nthe prevailing sentiment in the councils of England, it grows every day\r\nmore and more favorable to the diminution of restrictions, and to the\r\nwisdom of leaving much (I do not say every thing, for that would not be\r\ntrue) to the enterprise and the discretion of individuals. I should\r\ncertainly not have taken up the time of the committee to state at any\r\nlength the opinions of other governments, or of the public men of other\r\ncountries, upon a subject like this; but an occasional remark made by me\r\nthe other day, having been so directly controverted, especially by Mr.\r\nSpeaker, in his observations yesterday, I must take occasion to refer to\r\nsome proofs of what I have stated.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the state of English opinion? Everybody knows that, after\r\nthe termination of the late European war, there came a time of great\r\npressure in England. Since her example has been quoted, let it be asked\r\nin what mode her government sought relief. Did it aim to maintain\r\nartificial and unnatural prices? Did it maintain a swollen and\r\nextravagant paper circulation? Did it carry further the laws of\r\nprohibition and exclusion? Did it draw closer the cords of colonial\r\nrestraint? No, Sir, but precisely the reverse. Instead of relying on\r\nlegislative contrivances and artificial devices, it trusted to the\r\nenterprise and industry of the people, which it sedulously sought to\r\nexcite, not by imposing restraint, but by removing it, wherever its\r\nremoval was practicable. In May, 1820, the attention of the government\r\nhaving been much turned to the state of foreign trade, a distinguished\r\nmember[2] of the House of Peers brought forward a Parliamentary motion\r\nupon that subject, followed by an ample discussion and a full statement\r\nof his own opinions. In the course of his remarks, he observed, \"that\r\nthere ought to be no prohibitory duties as such; for that it was\r\nevident, that, where a manufacture could not be carried on, or a\r\nproduction raised, but under the protection of a prohibitory duty, that\r\nmanufacture, or that produce, could not be brought to market but at a\r\nloss. In his opinion, the name of strict prohibition might, therefore,\r\nin commerce, be got rid of altogether; but he did not see the same\r\nobjection to protecting duties, which, while they admitted of the\r\nintroduction of commodities from abroad similar to those which we\r\nourselves manufactured, placed them so much on a level as to allow a\r\ncompetition between them.\" \"No axiom,\" he added, \"was more true than\r\nthis: that it was by growing what the territory of a country could grow\r\nmost cheaply, and by receiving from other countries what it could not\r\nproduce except at too great an expense, that the greatest degree of\r\nhappiness was to be communicated to the greatest extent of population.\"\r\n\r\nIn assenting to the motion, the first minister[3] of the crown expressed\r\nhis own opinion of the great advantage resulting from unrestricted\r\nfreedom of trade. \"Of the soundness of that general principle,\" he\r\nobserved, \"I can entertain no doubt. I can entertain no doubt of what\r\nwould have been the great advantages to the civilized world, if the\r\nsystem of unrestricted trade had been acted upon by every nation from\r\nthe earliest period of its commercial intercourse with its neighbors. If\r\nto those advantages there could have been any exceptions, I am persuaded\r\nthat they would have been but few; and I am also persuaded that the\r\ncases to which they would have referred would not have been, in\r\nthemselves, connected with the trade and commerce of England. But we are\r\nnow in a situation in which, I will not say that a reference to the\r\nprinciple of unrestricted trade can be of no use, because such a\r\nreference may correct erroneous reasoning, but in which it is impossible\r\nfor us, or for any country in the world but the United States of\r\nAmerica, to act unreservedly on that principle. The commercial\r\nregulations of the European world have been long established, and cannot\r\nsuddenly be departed from.\" Having supposed a proposition to be made to\r\nEngland by a foreign state for free commerce and intercourse, and an\r\nunrestricted exchange of agricultural products and of manufactures, he\r\nproceeds to observe: \"It would be impossible to accede to such a\r\nproposition. We have risen to our present greatness under a different\r\nsystem. Some suppose that we have risen in consequence of that system;\r\n_others, of whom I am one, believe that we have risen in spite of that\r\nsystem_. But, whichever of these hypotheses be true, certain it is that\r\nwe have risen under a very different system than that of free and\r\nunrestricted trade. It is utterly impossible, with our debt and\r\ntaxation, even if they were but half their existing amount, that we can\r\nsuddenly adopt the system of free trade.\"\r\n\r\nLord Ellenborough, in the same debate, said, \"that he attributed the\r\ngeneral distress then existing in Europe to the regulations that had\r\ntaken place since the destruction of the French power. Most of the\r\nstates on the Continent had surrounded themselves as with walls of\r\nbrass, to inhibit intercourse with other states. Intercourse was\r\nprohibited, even in districts of the same state, as was the case in\r\nAustria and Sardinia. Thus, though the taxes on the people had been\r\nlightened, the severity of their condition had been increased. He\r\nbelieved that the discontent which pervaded most parts of Europe, and\r\nespecially Germany, was more owing to commercial restrictions than to\r\nany theoretical doctrines on government; and that a free communication\r\namong them would do more to restore tranquillity, than any other step\r\nthat could be adopted. He objected to all attempts to frustrate the\r\nbenevolent intentions of Providence, which had given to various\r\ncountries various wants, in order to bring them together. He objected to\r\nit as anti-social; he objected to it as making commerce the means of\r\nbarbarizing instead of enlightening nations. The state of the trade with\r\nFrance was most disgraceful to both countries; the two greatest\r\ncivilized nations of the world, placed at a distance of scarcely twenty\r\nmiles from each other, had contrived, by their artificial regulations,\r\nto reduce their commerce with each other to a mere nullity.\" Every\r\nmember speaking on this occasion agreed in the general sentiments\r\nfavorable to unrestricted intercourse, which had thus been advanced; one\r\nof them remarking, at the conclusion of the debate, that \"the principles\r\nof free trade, which he was happy to see so fully recognized, were of\r\nthe utmost consequence; for, though, in the present circumstances of the\r\ncountry, a free trade was unattainable, yet their task hereafter was to\r\napproximate to it. Considering the prejudices and interests which were\r\nopposed to the recognition of that principle, it was no small indication\r\nof the firmness and liberality of government to have so fully conceded\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nSir, we have seen, in the course of this discussion, that several\r\ngentlemen have expressed their high admiration of the _silk manufacture_\r\nof England. Its commendation was begun, I think, by the honorable member\r\nfrom Vermont, who sits near me, who thinks that that alone gives\r\nconclusive evidence of the benefits produced by attention to\r\nmanufactures, inasmuch as it is a great source of wealth to the nation,\r\nand has amply repaid all the cost of its protection. Mr. Speaker's\r\napprobation of this part of the English example was still warmer. Now,\r\nSir, it does so happen, that both these gentlemen differ very widely on\r\nthis point from the opinions entertained in England, by persons of the\r\nfirst rank, both as to knowledge and power. In the debate to which I\r\nhave already referred, the proposer of the motion urged the expediency\r\nof providing for the admission of the silks of France into England. \"He\r\nwas aware,\" he said, \"that there was a poor and industrious body of\r\nmanufacturers, whose interests must suffer by such an arrangement; and\r\ntherefore he felt that it would be the duty of Parliament to provide for\r\nthe present generation by a large Parliamentary grant. It was\r\nconformable to every principle of sound justice to do so, when the\r\ninterests of a particular class were sacrificed to the good of the\r\nwhole.\" In answer to these observations, Lord Liverpool said that, with\r\nreference to several branches of manufactures, time, and the change of\r\ncircumstances, had rendered the system of protecting duties merely\r\nnominal; and that, in his opinion, if all the protecting laws which\r\nregarded both the woollen and cotton manufactures were to be repealed,\r\nno injurious effects would thereby be occasioned. \"But,\" he observes,\r\n\"with respect to silk, that manufacture in this kingdom is so completely\r\nartificial, that any attempt to introduce the principles of free trade\r\nwith reference to it might put an end to it altogether. I allow that the\r\nsilk manufacture is not natural to this country. _I wish we had never\r\nhad a silk manufactory._ I allow that it is natural to France; I allow\r\nthat it might have been better, had each country adhered exclusively to\r\nthat manufacture in which each is superior; and had the silks of France\r\nbeen exchanged for British cottons. But I must look at things as they\r\nare; and when I consider the extent of capital, and the immense\r\npopulation, consisting, I believe, of about fifty thousand persons,\r\nengaged in our silk manufacture, I can only say, that one of the few\r\npoints in which I totally disagree with the proposer of the motion is\r\nthe expediency, under existing circumstances, of holding out any idea\r\nthat it would be possible to relinquish the silk manufacture, and to\r\nprovide for those who live by it, by Parliamentary enactment. Whatever\r\nobjections there may be to the continuance of the protecting system, I\r\nrepeat, that it is impossible altogether to relinquish it. I may regret\r\nthat the system was ever commenced; but as I cannot recall that act, I\r\nmust submit to the inconvenience by which it is attended, rather than\r\nexpose the country to evils of greater magnitude.\" Let it be remembered,\r\nSir, that these are not the sentiments of a theorist, nor the fancies of\r\nspeculation; but the operative opinions of the first minister of\r\nEngland, acknowledged to be one of the ablest and most practical\r\nstatesmen of his country.\r\n\r\nGentlemen could have hardly been more unfortunate than in the selection\r\nof the silk manufacture in England as an example of the beneficial\r\neffects of that system which they would recommend. It is, in the\r\nlanguage which I have quoted, completely artificial. It has been\r\nsustained by I know not how many laws, breaking in upon the plainest\r\nprinciples of general expediency. At the last session of Parliament, the\r\nmanufacturers petitioned for the repeal of three or four of these\r\nstatutes, complaining of the vexatious restrictions which they impose on\r\nthe wages of labor; setting forth, that a great variety of orders has\r\nfrom time to time been issued by magistrates under the authority of\r\nthese laws, interfering in an oppressive manner with the minutest\r\ndetails of the manufacture,--such as limiting the number of threads to\r\nan inch, restricting the widths of many sorts of work, and determining\r\nthe quantity of labor not to be exceeded without extra wages; that by\r\nthe operation of these laws, the rate of wages, instead of being left to\r\nthe recognized principles of regulation, has been arbitrarily fixed by\r\npersons whose ignorance renders them incompetent to a just decision;\r\nthat masters are compelled by law to pay an equal price for all work,\r\nwhether well or ill performed; and that they are wholly prevented from\r\nusing improved machinery, it being ordered, that work, in the weaving of\r\nwhich machinery is employed, shall be paid precisely at the same rate as\r\nif done by hand; that these acts have frequently given rise to the most\r\nvexatious regulations, the unintentional breach of which has subjected\r\nmanufacturers to ruinous penalties; and that the introduction of all\r\nmachinery being prevented, by which labor might be cheapened, and the\r\nmanufacturers being compelled to pay at a fixed price, under all\r\ncircumstances, they are unable to afford employment to their workmen, in\r\ntimes of stagnation of trade, and are compelled to stop their looms. And\r\nfinally, they complain that, notwithstanding these grievances under\r\nwhich they labor, while carrying on their manufacture in London, the law\r\nstill prohibits them, while they continue to reside there, from\r\nemploying any portion of their capital in the same business in any other\r\npart of the kingdom, where it might be more beneficially conducted.\r\nNow, Sir, absurd as these laws must appear to be to every man, the\r\nattempt to repeal them did not, as far as I recollect, altogether\r\nsucceed. The weavers were too numerous, their interests too great, or\r\ntheir prejudices too strong; and this notable instance of protection and\r\nmonopoly still exists, to be lamented in England with as much sincerity\r\nas it seems to be admired here.\r\n\r\nIn order further to show the prevailing sentiment of the English\r\ngovernment, I would refer to a report of a select committee of the House\r\nof Commons, at the head of which was the Vice-President of the Board of\r\nTrade (Mr. Wallace), in July, 1820. \"The time,\" say that committee,\r\n\"when monopolies could be successfully supported, or would be patiently\r\nendured, either in respect to subjects against subjects, or particular\r\ncountries against the rest of the world, seems to have passed away.\r\nCommerce, to continue undisturbed and secure, must be, as it was\r\nintended to be, a source of reciprocal amity between nations, and an\r\ninterchange of productions to promote the industry, the wealth, and the\r\nhappiness of mankind.\" In moving for the re-appointment of the committee\r\nin February, 1823, the same gentleman said: \"We must also get rid of\r\nthat feeling of appropriation which exhibited itself in a disposition to\r\nproduce every thing necessary for our own consumption, and to render\r\nourselves independent of the world. No notion could be more absurd or\r\nmischievous; it led, even in peace, to an animosity and rancor greater\r\nthan existed in time of war. Undoubtedly there would be great prejudices\r\nto combat, both in this country and elsewhere, in the attempt to remove\r\nthe difficulties which are most obnoxious. It would be impossible to\r\nforget the attention which was in some respects due to the present\r\nsystem of protections, although that attention ought certainly not to be\r\ncarried beyond the absolute necessity of the case.\" And in a second\r\nreport of the committee, drawn by the same gentleman, in that part of it\r\nwhich proposes a diminution of duties on timber from the North of\r\nEurope, and the policy of giving a legislative preference to the\r\nimportation of such timber in the log, and a discouragement of the\r\nimportation of deals, it is stated that the committee reject this\r\npolicy, because, among other reasons, \"it is founded on a principle of\r\nexclusion, which they are most averse to see brought into operation, in\r\nany _new instance_, without the warrant of some evident and great\r\npolitical expediency.\" And on many subsequent occasions the same\r\ngentleman has taken occasion to observe, that he differed from those who\r\nthought that manufactures could not nourish without restrictions on\r\ntrade; that old prejudices of that sort were dying away, and that more\r\nliberal and just sentiments were taking their place.\r\n\r\nThese sentiments appear to have been followed by important legal\r\nprovisions, calculated to remove restrictions and prohibitions where\r\nthey were most severely felt; that is to say, in several branches of\r\nnavigation and trade. They have relaxed their colonial system, they have\r\nopened the ports of their islands, and have done away the restriction\r\nwhich limited the trade of the colony to the mother country. Colonial\r\nproducts can now be carried directly from the islands to any part of\r\nEurope; and it may not be improbable, considering our own high duties on\r\nspirits, that that article may be exchanged hereafter by the English\r\nWest India colonies directly for the timber and deals of the Baltic. It\r\nmay be added, that Mr. Lowe, whom the gentleman has cited, says, that\r\nnobody supposes that the three great staples of English manufactures,\r\ncotton, woollen, and hardware, are benefited by any existing protecting\r\nduties; and that one object of all these protecting laws is usually\r\noverlooked, and that is, that they have been intended to reconcile the\r\nvarious interests to taxation; the corn law, for example, being designed\r\nas some equivalent to the agricultural interest for the burden of tithes\r\nand of poor-rates.\r\n\r\nIn fine, Sir, I think it is clear, that, if we now embrace the system of\r\nprohibitions and restrictions, we shall show an affection for what\r\nothers have discarded, and be attempting to ornament ourselves with\r\ncast-off apparel.\r\n\r\nSir, I should not have gone into this prolix detail of opinions from any\r\nconsideration of their special importance on the present occasion; but\r\nhaving happened to state that such was the actual opinion of the\r\ngovernment of England at the present time, and the accuracy of this\r\nrepresentation having been so confidently denied, I have chosen to put\r\nthe matter beyond doubt or cavil, although at the expense of these\r\ntedious citations. I shall have occasion hereafter to refer more\r\nparticularly to sundry recent British enactments, by way of showing the\r\ndiligence and spirit with which that government strives to sustain its\r\nnavigating interest, by opening the widest possible range to the\r\nenterprise of individual adventurers. I repeat, that I have not alluded\r\nto these examples of a foreign state as being fit to control our own\r\npolicy. In the general principle, I acquiesce. Protection, when carried\r\nto the point which is now recommended, that is, to entire prohibition,\r\nseems to me destructive of all commercial intercourse between nations.\r\nWe are urged to adopt the system upon general principles; and what would\r\nbe the consequence of the universal application of such a general\r\nprinciple, but that nations would abstain entirely from all intercourse\r\nwith one another? I do not admit the general principle; on the contrary,\r\nI think freedom of trade to be the general principle, and restriction\r\nthe exception. And it is for every state, taking into view its own\r\ncondition, to judge of the propriety, in any case, of making an\r\nexception, constantly preferring, as I think all wise governments will,\r\nnot to depart without urgent reason from the general rule.\r\n\r\nThere is another point in the existing policy of England to which I\r\nwould most earnestly invite the attention of the committee; I mean the\r\nwarehouse system, or what we usually call the system of drawback. Very\r\ngreat prejudices appear to me to exist with us on that subject. We seem\r\naverse to the extension of the principle. The English government, on the\r\ncontrary, appear to have carried it to the extreme of liberality. They\r\nhave arrived, however, at their present opinions and present practice by\r\nslow degrees. The transit system was commenced about the year 1803, but\r\nthe first law was partial and limited. It admitted the importation of\r\nraw materials for exportation, but it excluded almost every sort of\r\nmanufactured goods. This was done for the same reason that we propose to\r\nprevent the transit of Canadian wheat through the United States, the\r\nfear of aiding the competition of the foreign article with our own in\r\nforeign markets. Better reflection or more experience has induced them\r\nto abandon that mode of reasoning, and to consider all such means of\r\ninfluencing foreign markets as nugatory; since, in the present active\r\nand enlightened state of the world, nations will supply themselves from\r\nthe best sources, and the true policy of all producers, whether of raw\r\nmaterials or of manufactured articles, is, not vainly to endeavor to\r\nkeep other vendors out of the market, but to conquer them in it by the\r\nquality and the cheapness of their articles. The present policy of\r\nEngland, therefore, is to allure the importation of commodities into\r\nEngland, there to be deposited in English warehouses, thence to be\r\nexported in assorted cargoes, and thus enabling her to carry on a\r\ngeneral export trade to all quarters of the globe. Articles of all\r\nkinds, with the single exception of tea, may be brought into England,\r\nfrom any part of the world, in foreign as well as British ships, there\r\nwarehoused, and again exported, at the pleasure of the owner, without\r\nthe payment of any duty or government charge whatever.\r\n\r\nWhile I am upon this subject, I would take notice also of the recent\r\nproposition in the English Parliament to abolish the tax on imported\r\nwool; and it is observable that those who support this proposition give\r\nthe same reasons that have been offered here, within the last week,\r\nagainst the duty which we propose on the same article. They say that\r\ntheir manufacturers require a cheap and coarse wool, for the supply of\r\nthe Mediterranean and Levant trade, and that, without a more free\r\nadmission of the wool of the Continent, that trade will all fall into\r\nthe hands of the Germans and Italians, who will carry it on through\r\nLeghorn and Trieste. While there is this duty on foreign wool to protect\r\nthe wool-growers of England, there is, on the other hand, a prohibition\r\non the exportation of the native article in aid of the manufacturers.\r\nThe opinion seems to be gaining strength, that the true policy is to\r\nabolish both.\r\n\r\nLaws have long existed in England preventing the emigration of artisans\r\nand the exportation of machinery; but the policy of these, also, has\r\nbecome doubted, and an inquiry has been instituted in Parliament into\r\nthe expediency of repealing them. As to the emigration of artisans, say\r\nthose who disapprove the laws, if that were desirable, no law could\r\neffect it; and as to the exportation of machinery, let us make it and\r\nexport it as we would any other commodity. If France is determined to\r\nspin and weave her own cotton, let us, if we may, still have the benefit\r\nof furnishing the machinery.\r\n\r\nI have stated these things, Sir, to show what seems to be the general\r\ntone of thinking and reasoning on these subjects in that country, the\r\nexample of which has been so much pressed upon us. Whether the present\r\npolicy of England be right or wrong, wise or unwise, it cannot, as it\r\nseems clearly to me, be quoted as an authority for carrying further the\r\nrestrictive and exclusive system, either in regard to manufactures or\r\ntrade. To re-establish a sound currency, to meet at once the shock,\r\ntremendous as it was, of the fall of prices, to enlarge her capacity for\r\nforeign trade, to open wide the field of individual enterprise and\r\ncompetition, and to say plainly and distinctly that the country must\r\nrelieve itself from the embarrassments which it felt, by economy,\r\nfrugality, and renewed efforts of enterprise,--these appear to be the\r\ngeneral outline of the policy which England has pursued.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, I will now proceed to say a few words upon a topic, but\r\nfor the introduction of which into this debate I should not have given\r\nthe committee on this occasion the trouble of hearing me. Some days ago,\r\nI believe it was when we were settling the controversy between the\r\noil-merchants and the tallow-chandlers, the _balance of trade_ made its\r\nappearance in debate, and I must confess, Sir, that I spoke of it, or\r\nrather spoke to it, somewhat freely and irreverently. I believe I used\r\nthe hard names which have been imputed to me, and I did it simply for\r\nthe purpose of laying the spectre, and driving it back to its tomb.\r\nCertainly, Sir, when I called the old notion on this subject nonsense, I\r\ndid not suppose that I should offend any one, unless the dead should\r\nhappen to hear me. All the living generation, I took it for granted,\r\nwould think the term very properly applied. In this, however, I was\r\nmistaken. The dead and the living rise up together to call me to\r\naccount, and I must defend myself as well as I am able.\r\n\r\nLet us inquire, then, Sir, what is meant by an unfavorable balance of\r\ntrade, and what the argument is, drawn from that source. By an\r\nunfavorable balance of trade, I understand, is meant that state of\r\nthings in which importation exceeds exportation. To apply it to our own\r\ncase, if the value of goods imported exceed the value of those exported,\r\nthen the balance of trade is said to be against us, inasmuch as we have\r\nrun in debt to the amount of this difference. Therefore it is said,\r\nthat, if a nation continue long in a commerce like this, it must be\r\nrendered absolutely bankrupt. It is in the condition of a man that buys\r\nmore than he sells; and how can such a traffic be maintained without\r\nruin? Now, Sir, the whole fallacy of this argument consists in\r\nsupposing, that, whenever the value of imports exceeds that of exports,\r\na debt is necessarily created to the extent of the difference, whereas,\r\nordinarily, the import is no more than the result of the export,\r\naugmented in value by the labor of transportation. The excess of imports\r\nover exports, in truth, usually shows the gains, not the losses, of\r\ntrade; or, in a country that not only buys and sells goods, but employs\r\nships in carrying goods also, it shows the profits of commerce, and the\r\nearnings of navigation. Nothing is more certain than that, in the usual\r\ncourse of things, and taking a series of years together, the value of\r\nour imports is the aggregate of our exports and our freights. If the\r\nvalue of commodities imported in a given instance did not exceed the\r\nvalue of the outward cargo, with which they were purchased, then it\r\nwould be clear to every man's common sense, that the voyage had not been\r\nprofitable. If such commodities fell far short in value of the cost of\r\nthe outward cargo, then the voyage would be a very losing one; and yet\r\nit would present exactly that state of things, which, according to the\r\nnotion of a balance of trade, can alone indicate a prosperous commerce.\r\nOn the other hand, if the return cargo were found to be worth much more\r\nthan the outward cargo, while the merchant, having paid for the goods\r\nexported, and all the expenses of the voyage, finds a handsome sum yet\r\nin his hands, which he calls profits, the balance of trade is still\r\nagainst him, and, whatever he may think of it, he is in a very bad way.\r\nAlthough one individual or all individuals gain, the nation loses; while\r\nall its citizens grow rich, the country grows poor. This is the doctrine\r\nof the balance of trade.\r\n\r\nAllow me, Sir, to give an instance tending to show how unaccountably\r\nindividuals deceive themselves, and imagine themselves to be somewhat\r\nrapidly mending their condition, while they ought to be persuaded that,\r\nby that infallible standard, the balance of trade, they are on the high\r\nroad to ruin. Some years ago, in better times than the present, a ship\r\nleft one of the towns of New England with 70,000 specie dollars. She\r\nproceeded to Mocha, on the Red Sea, and there laid out these dollars in\r\ncoffee, drugs, spices, and other articles procured in that market. With\r\nthis new cargo she proceeded to Europe; two thirds of it were sold in\r\nHolland for $130,000, which the ship brought back, and placed in the\r\nsame bank from the vaults of which she had taken her original outfit.\r\nThe other third was sent to the ports of the Mediterranean, and produced\r\na return of $25,000 in specie, and $15,000 in Italian merchandise. These\r\nsums together make $170,000 imported, which is $100,000 more than was\r\nexported, and is therefore proof of an unfavorable balance of trade, to\r\nthat amount, in this adventure. We should find no great difficulty, Sir,\r\nin paying off our balances, if this were the nature of them all.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, Mr. Chairman, that all these obsolete and exploded notions\r\nhad their origin in very mistaken ideas of the true nature of commerce.\r\nCommerce is not a gambling among nations for a stake, to be won by some\r\nand lost by others. It has not the tendency necessarily to impoverish\r\none of the parties to it, while it enriches the other; all parties gain,\r\nall parties make profits, all parties grow rich, by the operations of\r\njust and liberal commerce. If the world had but one clime and but one\r\nsoil; if all men had the same wants and the same means, on the spot of\r\ntheir existence, to gratify those wants,--then, indeed, what one\r\nobtained from the other by exchange would injure one party in the same\r\ndegree that it benefited the other; then, indeed, there would be some\r\nfoundation for the balance of trade. But Providence has disposed our lot\r\nmuch more kindly. We inhabit a various earth. We have reciprocal wants,\r\nand reciprocal means for gratifying one another's wants. This is the\r\ntrue origin of commerce, which is nothing more than an exchange of\r\nequivalents, and, from the rude barter of its primitive state, to the\r\nrefined and complex condition in which we see it, its principle is\r\nuniformly the same, its only object being, in every stage, to produce\r\nthat exchange of commodities between individuals and between nations\r\nwhich shall conduce to the advantage and to the happiness of both.\r\nCommerce between nations has the same essential character as commerce\r\nbetween individuals, or between parts of the same nation. Cannot two\r\nindividuals make an interchange of commodities which shall prove\r\nbeneficial to both, or in which the balance of trade shall be in favor\r\nof both? If not, the tailor and the shoemaker, the farmer and the smith,\r\nhave hitherto very much misunderstood their own interests. And with\r\nregard to the internal trade of a country, in which the same rule would\r\napply as between nations, do we ever speak of such an intercourse as\r\nprejudicial to one side because it is useful to the other? Do we ever\r\nhear that, because the intercourse between New York and Albany is\r\nadvantageous to one of those places, it must therefore be ruinous to the\r\nother?\r\n\r\nMay I be allowed, Sir, to read a passage on this subject from the\r\nobservations of a gentleman, in my opinion one of the most clear and\r\nsensible writers and speakers of the age upon subjects of this sort?[4]\r\n\"There is no political question on which the prevalence of false\r\nprinciples is so general, as in what relates to the nature of commerce\r\nand to the pretended balance of trade; and there are few which have led\r\nto a greater number of practical mistakes, attended with consequences\r\nextensively prejudicial to the happiness of mankind. In this country,\r\nour Parliamentary proceedings, our public documents, and the works of\r\nseveral able and popular writers, have combined to propagate the\r\nimpression, that we are indebted for much of our riches to what is\r\ncalled the balance of trade.\" \"Our true policy would surely be to\r\nprofess, as the object and guide of our commercial system, that which\r\nevery man who has studied the subject must know to be the true principle\r\nof commerce, the interchange of reciprocal and equivalent benefit. We\r\nmay rest assured that it is not in the nature of commerce to enrich one\r\nparty at the expense of the other. This is a purpose at which, if it\r\nwere practicable, we ought not to aim; and which, if we aimed at, we\r\ncould not accomplish.\" These remarks, I believe, Sir, were written some\r\nten or twelve years ago. They are in perfect accordance with the\r\nopinions, advanced in more elaborate treatises, and now that the world\r\nhas returned to a state of peace, and commerce has resumed its natural\r\nchannels, and different nations are enjoying, or seeking to enjoy, their\r\nrespective portions of it, all see the justness of these ideas,--all\r\nsee, that, in this day of knowledge and of peace, there can be no\r\ncommerce between nations but that which shall benefit all who are\r\nparties to it.\r\n\r\nIf it were necessary, Mr. Chairman, I might ask the attention of the\r\ncommittee to refer to a document before us, on this subject of the\r\nbalance of trade. It will be seen by reference to the accounts, that, in\r\nthe course of the last year, our total export to Holland exceeded two\r\nmillions and a half; our total import from the same country was but\r\nseven hundred thousand dollars. Now, can any man be wild enough to make\r\nany inference from this as to the gain or loss of our trade with Holland\r\nfor that year? Our trade with Russia for the same year produced a\r\nbalance the other way, our import being two millions, and our export but\r\nhalf a million. But this has no more tendency to show the Russian trade\r\na losing trade, than the other statement has to show that the Dutch\r\ntrade has been a gainful one. Neither of them, by itself, proves any\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nSpringing out of this notion of a balance of trade, there is another\r\nidea, which has been much dwelt upon in the course of this debate; that\r\nis, that we ought not to buy of nations who do not buy of us; for\r\nexample, that the Russian trade is a trade disadvantageous to the\r\ncountry, and ought to be discouraged, because, in the ports of Russia,\r\nwe buy more than we sell. Now allow me to observe, in the first place,\r\nSir, that we have no account showing how much we do sell in the ports of\r\nRussia. Our official returns show us only what is the amount of our\r\ndirect trade with her ports. But then we all know that the proceeds of\r\nanother portion of our exports go to the same market, though indirectly.\r\nWe send our own products, for example, to Cuba, or to Brazil; we there\r\nexchange them for the sugar and the coffee of those countries, and these\r\narticles we carry to St. Petersburg, and there sell them. Again; our\r\nexports to Holland and Hamburg are connected directly or indirectly with\r\nour imports from Russia. What difference does it make, in sense or\r\nreason, whether a cargo of iron be bought at St. Petersburg, by the\r\nexchange of a cargo of tobacco, or whether the tobacco has been sold on\r\nthe way, in a better market, in a port of Holland, the money remitted to\r\nEngland, and the iron paid for by a bill on London? There might indeed\r\nhave been an augmented freight, there might have been some saving of\r\ncommissions, if tobacco had been in brisk demand in the Russian market.\r\nBut still there is nothing to show that the whole voyage may not have\r\nbeen highly profitable. That depends upon the original cost of the\r\narticle here, the amount of freight and insurance to Holland, the price\r\nobtained there, the rate of exchange between Holland and England, the\r\nexpense, then, of proceeding to St. Petersburg, the price of iron there,\r\nthe rate of exchange between that place and England, the amount of\r\nfreight and insurance at home, and, finally, the value of the iron when\r\nbrought to our own market. These are the calculations which determine\r\nthe fortune of the adventure; and nothing can be judged of it, one way\r\nor the other, by the relative state of our imports or exports with\r\nHolland, England, or Russia.\r\n\r\nI would not be understood to deny, that it may often be our interest to\r\ncultivate a trade with countries that require most of such commodities\r\nas we can furnish, and which are capable also of directly supplying our\r\nown wants. This is the original and the simplest form of all commerce,\r\nand is no doubt highly beneficial. Some countries are so situated, that\r\ncommerce, in this original form, or something near it, may be all that\r\nthey can, without considerable inconvenience, carry on. Our trade, for\r\nexample, with Madeira and the Western Islands has been useful to the\r\ncountry, as furnishing a demand for some portion of our agricultural\r\nproducts, which probably could not have been bought had we not received\r\ntheir products in return. Countries situated still farther from the\r\ngreat marts and highways of the commercial world may afford still\r\nstronger instances of the necessity and utility of conducting commerce\r\non the original principle of barter, without much assistance from the\r\noperations of credit and exchange. All I would be understood to say is,\r\nthat it by no means follows that we can carry on nothing but a losing\r\ntrade with a country from which we receive more of her products than she\r\nreceives of ours. Since I was supposed, the other day, in speaking upon\r\nthis subject, to advance opinions which not only this country ought to\r\nreject, but which also other countries, and those the most distinguished\r\nfor skill and success in commercial intercourse, do reject, I will ask\r\nleave to refer again to the discussion which I first mentioned in the\r\nEnglish Parliament, relative to the foreign trade of that country. \"With\r\nregard,\" says the mover[5] of the proposition, \"to the argument employed\r\nagainst renewing our intercourse with the North of Europe, namely, that\r\nthose who supplied us with timber from that quarter would not receive\r\nBritish manufactures in return, it appeared to him futile and\r\nungrounded. If they did not send direct for our manufactures at home,\r\nthey would send for them to Leipsic and other fairs of Germany. Were not\r\nthe Russian and Polish merchants purchasers there to a great amount? But\r\nhe would never admit the principle, that a trade was not profitable\r\nbecause we were obliged to carry it on with the precious metals, or that\r\nwe ought to renounce it, because our manufactures were not received by\r\nthe foreign nation in return for its produce. Whatever we received must\r\nbe paid for in the produce of our land and labor, directly or\r\ncircuitously, and he was glad to have the noble Earl's[6] marked\r\nconcurrence in this principle.\"\r\n\r\nReferring ourselves again, Sir, to the analogies of common life, no one\r\nwould say that a farmer or a mechanic should buy _only_ where he can do\r\nso by the exchange of his own produce, or of his own manufacture. Such\r\nexchange may be often convenient; and, on the other hand, the cash\r\npurchase may be often more convenient. It is the same in the intercourse\r\nof nations. Indeed, Mr. Speaker has placed this argument on very clear\r\ngrounds. It was said, in the early part of the debate, that, if we cease\r\nto import English cotton fabrics, England will no longer continue to\r\npurchase our cotton. To this Mr. Speaker replied, with great force and\r\njustice, that, as she must have cotton in large quantities, she will buy\r\nthe article where she can find it best and cheapest; and that it would\r\nbe quite ridiculous in her, manufacturing as she still would be, for her\r\nown vast consumption and the consumption of millions in other countries,\r\nto reject our uplands because we had learned to manufacture a part of\r\nthem for ourselves. Would it not be equally ridiculous in us, if the\r\ncommodities of Russia were both cheaper and better suited to our wants\r\nthan could be found elsewhere, to abstain from commerce with her,\r\nbecause she will not receive in return other commodities which we have\r\nto sell, but which she has no occasion to buy?\r\n\r\nIntimately connected, Sir, with this topic, is another which has been\r\nbrought into the debate; I mean the evil so much complained of, the\r\nexportation of specie. We hear gentlemen imputing the loss of market at\r\nhome to a want of money, and this want of money to the exportation of\r\nthe precious metals. We hear the India and China trade denounced, as a\r\ncommerce conducted on our side, in a great measure, with gold and\r\nsilver. These opinions, Sir, are clearly void of all just foundation,\r\nand we cannot too soon get rid of them. There are no shallower reasoners\r\nthan those political and commercial writers who would represent it to be\r\nthe only true and gainful end of commerce, to accumulate the precious\r\nmetals. These are articles of use, and articles of merchandise, with\r\nthis additional circumstance belonging to them, that they are made, by\r\nthe general consent of nations, the standard by which the value of all\r\nother merchandise is to be estimated. In regard to weights and measures,\r\nsomething drawn from external nature is made a common standard, for the\r\npurposes of general convenience: and this is precisely the office\r\nperformed by the precious metals, in addition to those uses to which, as\r\nmetals, they are capable of being applied. There may be of these too\r\nmuch or too little in a country at a particular time, as there may be of\r\nany other articles. When the market is overstocked with them, as it\r\noften is, their exportation becomes as proper and as useful as that of\r\nother commodities, under similar circumstances. We need no more repine,\r\nwhen the dollars which have been brought here from South America are\r\ndespatched to other countries, than when coffee and sugar take the same\r\ndirection. We often deceive ourselves, by attributing to a scarcity of\r\nmoney that which is the result of other causes. In the course of this\r\ndebate, the honorable member from Pennsylvania[7] has represented the\r\ncountry as full of every thing but money. But this I take to be a\r\nmistake. The agricultural products, so abundant in Pennsylvania, will\r\nnot, he says, sell for money; but they will sell for money as quick as\r\nfor any other article which happens to be in demand. They will sell for\r\nmoney, for example, as easily as for coffee or for tea, at the prices\r\nwhich properly belong to those articles. The mistake lies in imputing\r\nthat to want of money which arises from want of demand. Men do not buy\r\nwheat because they have money, but because they want wheat. To decide\r\nwhether money be plenty or not, that is, whether there be a large\r\nportion of capital unemployed or not, when the currency of a country is\r\nmetallic, we must look, not only to the prices of commodities, but also\r\nto the rate of interest. A low rate of interest, a facility of obtaining\r\nmoney on loans, a disposition to invest in permanent stocks, all of\r\nwhich are proofs that money is plenty, may nevertheless often denote a\r\nstate not of the highest prosperity. They may, and often do, show a want\r\nof employment for capital; and the accumulation of specie shows the same\r\nthing. We have no occasion for the precious metals as money, except for\r\nthe purposes of circulation, or rather of sustaining a safe paper\r\ncirculation. And whenever there is a prospect of a profitable investment\r\nabroad, all the gold and silver, except what these purposes require,\r\nwill be exported. For the same reason, if a demand exist abroad for\r\nsugar and coffee, whatever amount of those articles might exist in the\r\ncountry, beyond the wants of its own consumption, would be sent abroad\r\nto meet that demand.\r\n\r\nBesides, Sir, how should it ever occur to anybody, that we should\r\ncontinue to export gold and silver, if we did not continue to import\r\nthem also? If a vessel take our own products to the Havana, or\r\nelsewhere, exchange them for dollars, proceed to China, exchange them\r\nfor silks and teas, bring these last to the ports of the Mediterranean,\r\nsell them there for dollars, and return to the United States,--this\r\nwould be a voyage resulting in the importation of the precious metals.\r\nBut if she had returned from Cuba, and the dollars obtained there had\r\nbeen shipped direct from the United States to China, the China goods\r\nsold in Holland, and the proceeds brought home in the hemp and iron of\r\nRussia, this would be a voyage in which they were exported. Yet\r\neverybody sees that both might be equally beneficial to the individual\r\nand to the public. I believe, Sir, that, in point of fact, we have\r\nenjoyed great benefit in our trade with India and China, from the\r\nliberty of going from place to place all over the world, without being\r\nobliged in the mean time to return home, a liberty not heretofore\r\nenjoyed by the private traders of England, in regard to India and China.\r\nSuppose the American ship to be at Brazil, for example; she could\r\nproceed with her dollars direct to India, and, in return, could\r\ndistribute her cargo in all the various ports of Europe or America;\r\nwhile an English ship, if a private trader, being at Brazil, must first\r\nreturn to England, and then could only proceed in the direct line from\r\nEngland to India. This advantage our countrymen have not been backward\r\nto improve; and in the debate to which I have already so often referred,\r\nit was stated, not without some complaint of the inconvenience of\r\nexclusion, and the natural sluggishness of monopoly, that American ships\r\nwere at that moment fitting out in the Thames, to supply France,\r\nHolland, and other countries on the Continent, with tea; while the East\r\nIndia Company would not do this of themselves, nor allow any of their\r\nfellow-countrymen to do it for them.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another subject, Mr. Chairman, upon which I would wish to\r\nsay something, if I might presume upon the continued patience of the\r\ncommittee. We hear sometimes in the House, and continually out of it, of\r\nthe rate of exchange, as being one proof that we are on the downward\r\nroad to ruin. Mr. Speaker himself has adverted to that topic, and I am\r\nafraid that his authority may give credit to opinions clearly unfounded,\r\nand which lead to very false and erroneous conclusions. Sir, let us see\r\nwhat the facts are. Exchange on England has recently risen one or one\r\nand a half per cent, partly owing, perhaps, to the introduction of this\r\nbill into Congress. Before this recent rise, and for the last six\r\nmonths, I understand its average may have been about seven and a half\r\nper cent advance. Now, supposing this to be the _real_, and not merely,\r\nas it is, the nominal, par of exchange between us and England, what\r\nwould it prove? Nothing, except that funds were wanted by American\r\ncitizens in England for commercial operations, to be carried on either\r\nin England or elsewhere. It would not necessarily show that we were\r\nindebted to England; for, if we had occasion to pay debts in Russia or\r\nHolland, funds in England would naturally enough be required for such a\r\npurpose. Even if it did prove that a balance was due England at the\r\nmoment, it would have no tendency to explain to us whether our commerce\r\nwith England had been profitable or unprofitable.\r\n\r\nBut it is not true, in point of fact, that the _real_ price of exchange\r\nis seven and a half per cent advance, nor, indeed, that there is at the\r\npresent moment any advance at all. That is to say, it is not true that\r\nmerchants will give such an advance, or any advance, for _money_ in\r\nEngland, beyond what they would give for the same amount, in the same\r\ncurrency, here. It will strike every one who reflects upon it, that, if\r\nthere were a real difference of seven and a half per cent, money would\r\nbe immediately shipped to England; because the expense of transportation\r\nwould be far less than that difference. Or commodities of trade would be\r\nshipped to Europe, and the proceeds remitted to England. If it could so\r\nhappen, that American merchants should be willing to pay ten per cent\r\npremium for money in England, or, in other words, that a real difference\r\nto that amount in the exchange should exist, its effects would be\r\nimmediately seen in new shipments of our own commodities to Europe,\r\nbecause this state of things would create new motives. A cargo of\r\ntobacco, for example, might sell at Amsterdam for the same price as\r\nbefore; but if its proceeds, when remitted to London, were advanced, as\r\nthey would be in such case, ten per cent by the state of exchange, this\r\nwould be so much added to the price, and would operate therefore as a\r\nmotive for the exportation; and in this way national balances are, and\r\nalways will be, adjusted.\r\n\r\nTo form any accurate idea of the true state of exchange between two\r\ncountries, we must look at their currencies, and compare the quantities\r\nof gold and silver which they may respectively represent. This usually\r\nexplains the state of the exchanges; and this will satisfactorily\r\naccount for the apparent advance now existing on bills drawn on England.\r\nThe English standard of value is gold; with us that office is performed\r\nby gold, and by silver also, at a fixed relation to each other. But our\r\nestimate of silver is rather higher, in proportion to gold, than most\r\nnations give it; it is higher, especially, than in England, at the\r\npresent moment. The consequence is, that silver, which remains a legal\r\ncurrency with us, stays here, while the gold has gone abroad; verifying\r\nthe universal truth, that, if _two_ currencies be allowed to exist, of\r\ndifferent values, that which is cheapest will fill up the whole\r\ncirculation. For as much gold as will suffice to pay here a debt of a\r\ngiven amount, we can buy in England more silver than would be necessary\r\nto pay the same debt here; and from this difference in the value of\r\nsilver arises wholly or in a great measure the present apparent\r\ndifference in exchange. Spanish dollars sell now in England for four\r\nshillings and nine pence sterling per ounce, equal to one dollar and six\r\ncents. By our standard the same ounce is worth one dollar and sixteen\r\ncents, being a difference of about nine per cent. The true par of\r\nexchange, therefore, is nine per cent. If a merchant here pay one\r\nhundred Spanish dollars for a bill on England, at nominal par, in\r\nsterling money, that is for a bill of £22 10s., the proceeds of this\r\nbill, when paid in England in the legal currency, will there purchase,\r\nat the present price of silver, one hundred and nine Spanish dollars.\r\nTherefore, if the nominal advance on English bills do not exceed nine\r\nper cent, the real exchange is not against this country; in other words,\r\nit does not show that there is any pressing or particular occasion for\r\nthe remittance of funds to England.\r\n\r\nAs little can be inferred from the occasional transfer of United States\r\nstock to England. Considering the interest paid on our stocks, the\r\nentire stability of our credit, and the accumulation of capital in\r\nEngland, it is not at all wonderful that investments should occasionally\r\nbe made in our funds. As a sort of countervailing fact, it may be\r\nstated that English stocks are now actually held in this country,\r\nthough probably not to any considerable amount.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed, Sir, to state some objections of a more general\r\nnature to the course of Mr. Speaker's observations.\r\n\r\nHe seems to me to argue the question as if all domestic industry were\r\nconfined to the production of manufactured articles; as if the\r\nemployment of our own capital and our own labor, in the occupations of\r\ncommerce and navigation, were not as emphatically domestic industry as\r\nany other occupation. Some other gentlemen, in the course of the debate,\r\nhave spoken of the price paid for every foreign manufactured article as\r\nso much given for the encouragement of foreign labor, to the prejudice\r\nof our own. But is not every such article the product of our own labor\r\nas truly as if we had manufactured it ourselves? Our labor has earned\r\nit, and paid the price for it. It is so much added to the stock of\r\nnational wealth. If the commodity were dollars, nobody would doubt the\r\ntruth of this remark; and it is precisely as correct in its application\r\nto any other commodity as to silver. One man makes a yard of cloth at\r\nhome; another raises agricultural products and buys a yard of imported\r\ncloth. Both these are equally the earnings of domestic industry, and the\r\nonly questions that arise in the case are two: the first is, which is\r\nthe best mode, under all the circumstances, of obtaining the article;\r\nthe second is, how far this first question is proper to be decided by\r\ngovernment, and how far it is proper to be left to individual\r\ndiscretion. There is no foundation for the distinction which attributes\r\nto certain employments the peculiar appellation of American industry;\r\nand it is, in my judgment, extremely unwise to attempt such\r\ndiscriminations.\r\n\r\nWe are asked, What nations have ever attained eminent prosperity without\r\nencouraging manufactures? I may ask, What nation ever reached the like\r\nprosperity without promoting foreign trade? I regard these interests as\r\nclosely connected, and am of opinion that it should be our aim to cause\r\nthem to flourish together. I know it would be very easy to promote\r\nmanufactures, at least for a time, but probably for a short time only,\r\nif we might act in disregard of other interests. We could cause a sudden\r\ntransfer of capital, and a violent change in the pursuits of men. We\r\ncould exceedingly benefit some classes by these means. But what, then,\r\nbecomes of the interests of others? The power of collecting revenue by\r\nduties on imports, and the habit of the government of collecting almost\r\nits whole revenue in that mode, will enable us, without exceeding the\r\nbounds of moderation, to give great advantages to those classes of\r\nmanufactures which we may think most useful to promote at home. What I\r\nobject to is the immoderate use of the power,--exclusions and\r\nprohibitions; all of which, as I think, not only interrupt the pursuits\r\nof individuals, with great injury to themselves and little or no benefit\r\nto the country, but also often divert our own labor, or, as it may very\r\nproperly be called, our own domestic industry, from those occupations in\r\nwhich it is well employed and well paid, to others in which it will be\r\nworse employed and worse paid. For my part, I see very little relief to\r\nthose who are likely to be deprived of their employments, or who find\r\nthe prices of the commodities which they need raised, in any of the\r\nalternatives which Mr. Speaker has presented. It is nothing to say that\r\nthey may, if they choose, continue to buy the foreign article; the\r\nanswer is, the price is augmented: nor that they may use the domestic\r\narticle; the price of that also is increased. Nor can they supply\r\nthemselves by the substitution of their own fabric. How can the\r\nagriculturist make his own iron? How can the ship-owner grow his own\r\nhemp?\r\n\r\nBut I have a yet stronger objection to the course of Mr. Speaker's\r\nreasoning; which is, that he leaves out of the case all that has been\r\nalready done for the protection of manufactures, and argues the question\r\nas if those interests were now for the first time to receive aid from\r\nduties on imports. I can hardly express the surprise I feel that Mr.\r\nSpeaker should fall into the common mode of expression used elsewhere,\r\nand ask if we will give our manufacturers no protection. Sir, look to\r\nthe history of our laws; look to the present state of our laws. Consider\r\nthat our whole revenue, with a trifling exception, is collected at the\r\ncustom-house, and always has been; and then say what propriety there is\r\nin calling on the government for protection, as if no protection had\r\nheretofore been afforded. The real question before us, in regard to all\r\nthe important clauses of the bill, is not whether we will _lay_ duties,\r\nbut whether we will _augment_ duties. The demand is for something more\r\nthan exists, and yet it is pressed as if nothing existed. It is wholly\r\nforgotten that iron and hemp, for example, already pay a very heavy and\r\nburdensome duty; and, in short, from the general tenor of Mr. Speaker's\r\nobservations, one would infer that, hitherto, we had rather taxed our\r\nown manufactures than fostered them by taxes on those of other\r\ncountries. We hear of the fatal policy of the tariff of 1816; and yet\r\nthe law of 1816 was passed avowedly for the benefit of manufacturers,\r\nand, with very few exceptions, imposed on imported articles very great\r\nadditions of tax; in some important instances, indeed, amounting to a\r\nprohibition.\r\n\r\nSir, on this subject, it becomes us at least to understand the real\r\nposture of the question. Let us not suppose that we are _beginning_ the\r\nprotection of manufactures, by duties on imports. What we are asked to\r\ndo is, to render those duties much higher, and therefore, instead of\r\ndealing in general commendations of the benefits of protection, the\r\nfriends of the bill, I think, are bound to make out a fair case for each\r\nof the manufactures which they propose to benefit. The government has\r\nalready done much for their protection, and it ought to be presumed to\r\nhave done enough, unless it be shown, by the facts and considerations\r\napplicable to each, that there is a necessity for doing more.\r\n\r\nOn the general question, Sir, allow me to ask if the doctrine of\r\nprohibition, as a general doctrine, be not preposterous. Suppose all\r\nnations to act upon it; they would be prosperous, then, according to the\r\nargument, precisely in the proportion in which they abolished\r\nintercourse with one another. The less of mutual commerce the better,\r\nupon this hypothesis. Protection and encouragement may be, and doubtless\r\nare, sometimes, wise and beneficial, if kept within proper limits; but\r\nwhen carried to an extravagant height, or the point of prohibition, the\r\nabsurd character of the system manifests itself. Mr. Speaker has\r\nreferred to the late Emperor Napoleon, as having attempted to naturalize\r\nthe manufacture of cotton in France. He did not cite a more extravagant\r\npart of the projects of that ruler, that is, his attempt to naturalize\r\nthe growth of that plant itself, in France; whereas, we have understood\r\nthat considerable districts in the South of France, and in Italy, of\r\nrich and productive lands, were at one time withdrawn from profitable\r\nuses, and devoted to raising, at great expense, a little bad cotton. Nor\r\nhave we been referred to the attempts, under the same system, to make\r\nsugar and coffee from common culinary vegetables; attempts which served\r\nto fill the print-shops of Europe, and to show us how easy is the\r\ntransition from what some think sublime to that which all admit to be\r\nridiculous. The folly of some of these projects has not been surpassed,\r\nnor hardly equalled, unless it be by the philosopher in one of the\r\nsatires of Swift, who so long labored to extract sunbeams from\r\ncucumbers.\r\n\r\nThe poverty and unhappiness of Spain have been attributed to the want of\r\nprotection to her own industry. If by this it be meant that the poverty\r\nof Spain is owing to bad government and bad laws, the remark is, in a\r\ngreat measure, just. But these very laws are bad because they are\r\nrestrictive, partial, and prohibitory. If prohibition were protection,\r\nSpain would seem to have had enough of it. Nothing can exceed the\r\nbarbarous rigidity of her colonial system, or the folly of her early\r\ncommercial regulations. Unenlightened and bigoted legislation, the\r\nmultitude of holidays, miserable roads, monopolies on the part of\r\ngovernment, restrictive laws, that ought long since to have been\r\nabrogated, are generally, and I believe truly, reckoned the principal\r\ncauses of the bad state of the productive industry of Spain. Any partial\r\nimprovement in her condition, or increase of her prosperity, has been,\r\nin all cases, the result of relaxation, and the abolition of what was\r\nintended for favor and protection.\r\n\r\nIn short, Sir, the general sense of this age sets, with a strong\r\ncurrent, in favor of freedom of commercial intercourse, and unrestrained\r\nindividual action. Men yield up their notions of monopoly and\r\nrestriction, as they yield up other prejudices, slowly and reluctantly;\r\nbut they cannot withstand the general tide of opinion.\r\n\r\nLet me now ask, Sir, what relief this bill proposes to some of those\r\ngreat and essential interests of the country, the condition of which has\r\nbeen referred to as proof of national distress; and which condition,\r\nalthough I do not think it makes out a case of _distress_, yet does\r\nindicate depression.\r\n\r\nAnd first, Sir, as to our foreign trade. Mr. Speaker has stated that\r\nthere has been a considerable falling off in the tonnage employed in\r\nthat trade. This is true, lamentably true. In my opinion, it is one of\r\nthose occurrences which ought to arrest our immediate, our deep, our\r\nmost earnest attention. What does this bill propose for its relief? It\r\nproposes nothing but new burdens. It proposes to diminish its\r\nemployment, and it proposes, at the same time, to augment its expense,\r\nby subjecting it to heavier taxation. Sir, there is no interest, in\r\nregard to which a stronger case for protection can be made out, than the\r\nnavigating interest. Whether we look at its present condition, which is\r\nadmitted to be depressed, the number of persons connected with it, and\r\ndependent upon it for their daily bread, or its importance to the\r\ncountry in a political point of view, it has claims upon our attention\r\nwhich cannot be surpassed. But what do we propose to do for it? I\r\nrepeat, Sir, simply to burden and to tax it. By a statement which I have\r\nalready submitted to the committee, it appears that the shipping\r\ninterest pays, annually, more than half a million of dollars in duties\r\non articles used in the construction of ships. We propose to add nearly,\r\nor quite, fifty per cent to this amount, at the very moment that we\r\nappeal to the languishing state of this interest as a proof of national\r\ndistress. Let it be remembered that our shipping employed in foreign\r\ncommerce has, at this moment, not the shadow of government protection.\r\nIt goes abroad upon the wide sea to make its own way, and earn its own\r\nbread, in a professed competition with the whole world. Its resources\r\nare its own frugality, its own skill, its own enterprise. It hopes to\r\nsucceed, if it shall succeed at all, not by extraordinary aid of\r\ngovernment, but by patience, vigilance, and toil. This right arm of the\r\nnation's safety strengthens its own muscle by its own efforts, and by\r\nunwearied exertion in its own defence becomes strong for the defence of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nNo one acquainted with this interest can deny that its situation, at\r\nthis moment, is extremely critical. We have left it hitherto to maintain\r\nitself or perish; to swim if it can, and to sink if it must. But at this\r\nmoment of its apparent struggle, can we as men, can we as patriots, add\r\nanother stone to the weight that threatens to carry it down? Sir, there\r\nis a limit to human power, and to human effort. I know the commercial\r\nmarine of this country can do almost every thing, and bear almost every\r\nthing. Yet some things are impossible to be done, and some burdens may\r\nbe impossible to be borne; and as it was the last ounce that broke the\r\nback of the camel, so the last tax, although it were even a small one,\r\nmay be decisive as to the power of our marine to sustain the conflict in\r\nwhich it is now engaged with all the commercial nations on the globe.\r\n\r\nAgain, Mr. Chairman, the failures and the bankruptcies which have taken\r\nplace in our large cities have been mentioned as proving the little\r\nsuccess attending _commerce_, and its general decline. But this bill has\r\nno balm for those wounds. It is very remarkable, that when the losses\r\nand disasters of certain manufacturers, those of iron, for instance, are\r\nmentioned, it is done for the purpose of invoking aid for the\r\ndistressed. Not so with the losses and disasters of commerce; these last\r\nare narrated, and not unfrequently much exaggerated, to prove the\r\nruinous nature of the employment, and to show that it ought to be\r\nabandoned, and the capital engaged in it turned to other objects.\r\n\r\nIt has been often said, Sir, that our manufacturers have to contend, not\r\nonly against the natural advantages of those who produce similar\r\narticles in foreign countries, but also against the action of foreign\r\ngovernments, who have great political interest in aiding their own\r\nmanufactures to suppress ours. But have not these governments as great\r\nan interest to cripple our marine, by preventing the growth of our\r\ncommerce and navigation? What is it that makes us the object of the\r\nhighest respect, or the most suspicious jealousy, to foreign states?\r\nWhat is it that most enables us to take high relative rank among the\r\nnations? I need not say that this results, more than from any thing\r\nelse, from that quantity of military power which we can cause to be\r\nwater-borne, and from that extent of commerce which we are able to\r\nmaintain throughout the world.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, I am conscious of having detained the committee much too\r\nlong with these observations. My apology for now proceeding to some\r\nremarks upon the particular clauses of the bill is, that, representing a\r\ndistrict at once commercial and highly manufacturing, and being called\r\nupon to vote upon a bill containing provisions so numerous and so\r\nvarious, I am naturally desirous to state as well what I approve, as\r\nwhat I would reject.\r\n\r\nThe first section proposes an augmented duty upon woollen manufactures.\r\nThis, if it were unqualified, would no doubt be desirable to those who\r\nare engaged in that business. I have myself presented a petition from\r\nthe woollen manufacturers of Massachusetts, praying an augmented _ad\r\nvalorem_ duty upon imported woollen cloths; and I am prepared to accede\r\nto that proposition, to a reasonable extent. But then this bill\r\nproposes, also, a very high duty upon imported wool; and, as far as I\r\ncan learn, a majority of the manufacturers are at least extremely\r\ndoubtful whether, taking these two provisions together, the state of the\r\nlaw is not better for them now than it would be if this bill should\r\npass. It is said, this tax on raw wool will benefit the agriculturist;\r\nbut I know it to be the opinion of some of the best informed of that\r\nclass, that it will do them more hurt than good. They fear it will check\r\nthe manufacturer, and consequently check his demand for their article.\r\nThe argument is, that a certain quantity of coarse wool, cheaper than we\r\ncan possibly furnish, is necessary to enable the manufacturer to carry\r\non the general business, and that if this cannot be had, the consequence\r\nwill be, not a greater, but a less, manufacture of our own wool. I am\r\naware that very intelligent persons differ upon this point; but if we\r\nmay safely infer from that difference of opinion, that the proposed\r\nbenefit is at least doubtful, it would be prudent perhaps to abstain\r\nfrom the experiment. Certain it is, that the same reasoning has been\r\nemployed, as I have before stated, on the same subject, when a renewed\r\napplication was made to the English Parliament to repeal the duty on\r\nimported wool, I believe scarcely two months ago; those who supported\r\nthe application pressing urgently the necessity of an unrestricted use\r\nof the cheap, imported raw material, with a view to supply with coarse\r\ncloths the markets of warm climates, such as those of Egypt and Turkey,\r\nand especially a vast newly created demand in the South American states.\r\n\r\nAs to the manufactures of cotton, it is agreed, I believe, that they are\r\ngenerally successful. It is understood that the present existing duty\r\noperates pretty much as a prohibition over those descriptions of fabrics\r\nto which it applies. The proposed alteration would probably enable the\r\nAmerican manufacturer to commence competition with higher-priced\r\nfabrics; and so, perhaps, would an augmentation less than is here\r\nproposed. I consider the cotton manufactures not only to have reached,\r\nbut to have passed, the point of competition. I regard their success as\r\ncertain, and their growth as rapid as the most impatient could well\r\nexpect. If, however, a provision of the nature of that recommended here\r\nwere thought necessary, to commence new operations in the same line of\r\nmanufacture, I should cheerfully agree to it, if it were not at the cost\r\nof sacrificing other great interests of the country. I need hardly say,\r\nthat whatever promotes the cotton and woollen manufactures promotes most\r\nimportant interests of my constituents. They have a great stake in the\r\nsuccess of those establishments, and, as far as those manufactures are\r\nconcerned, would be as much benefited by the provisions of this bill as\r\nany part of the community. It is obvious, too, I should think, that, for\r\nsome considerable time, manufactures of this sort, to whatever magnitude\r\nthey may rise, will be principally established in those parts of the\r\ncountry where population is most dense, capital most abundant, and where\r\nthe most successful beginnings have already been made.\r\n\r\nBut if these be thought to be advantages, they are greatly\r\ncounterbalanced by other advantages enjoyed by other portions of the\r\ncountry. I cannot but regard the situation of the West as highly\r\nfavorable to human happiness. It offers, in the abundance of its new and\r\nfertile lands, such assurances of permanent property and respectability\r\nto the industrious, it enables them to lay such sure foundations for a\r\ncompetent provision for their families, it makes such a nation of\r\nfreeholders, that it need not envy the happiest and most prosperous of\r\nthe manufacturing communities. We may talk as we will of well-fed and\r\nwell-clothed day-laborers or journeymen; they are not, after all, to be\r\ncompared, either for happiness or respectability, with him who sleeps\r\nunder his own roof and cultivates his own fee-simple inheritance.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the proposed duty on glass, I would observe, that, upon\r\nthe best means of judging which I possess, I am of opinion that the\r\nchairman of the committee is right in stating that there is in effect a\r\nbounty upon the exportation of the British article. I think it entirely\r\nproper, therefore, to raise our own duty by such an amount as shall be\r\nequivalent to that bounty.\r\n\r\nAnd here, Mr. Chairman, before proceeding to those parts of the bill to\r\nwhich I most strenuously object, I will be so presumptuous as to take up\r\na challenge which Mr. Speaker has thrown down. He has asked us, in a\r\ntone of interrogatory indicative of the feeling of anticipated triumph,\r\nto mention any country in which manufactures have flourished without the\r\naid of prohibitory laws. He has demanded if it be not policy,\r\nprotection, ay, and prohibition, that have carried other states to the\r\nheight of their prosperity, and whether any one has succeeded with such\r\ntame and inert legislation as ours. Sir, I am ready to answer this\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nThere is a country, not undistinguished among the nations, in which the\r\nprogress of manufactures has been far more rapid than in any other, and\r\nyet unaided by prohibitions or unnatural restrictions. That country, the\r\nhappiest which the sun shines on, is our own.\r\n\r\nThe woollen manufactures of England have existed from the early ages of\r\nthe monarchy. Provisions designed to aid and foster them are in the\r\nblack-letter statutes of the Edwards and the Henrys. Ours, on the\r\ncontrary, are but of yesterday; and yet, with no more than the\r\nprotection of existing laws, they are already at the point of close and\r\npromising competition. Sir, nothing is more unphilosophical than to\r\nrefer us, on these subjects, to the policy adopted by other nations in a\r\nvery different state of society, or to infer that what was judged\r\nexpedient by them, in their early history, must also be expedient for\r\nus, in this early part of our own. This would be reckoning our age\r\nchronologically, and estimating our advance by our number of years;\r\nwhen, in truth, we should regard only the state of society, the\r\nknowledge, the skill, the capital, and the enterprise which belong to\r\nour times. We have been transferred from the stock of Europe, in a\r\ncomparatively enlightened age, and our civilization and improvement date\r\nas far back as her own. Her original history is also our original\r\nhistory; and if, since the moment of separation, she has gone ahead of\r\nus in some respects, it may be said, without violating truth, that we\r\nhave kept up in others, and, in others again, are ahead ourselves. We\r\nare to legislate, then, with regard to the present actual state of\r\nsociety; and our own experience shows us, that, commencing manufactures\r\nat the present highly enlightened and emulous moment, we need not resort\r\nto the clumsy helps with which, in less auspicious times, governments\r\nhave sought to enable the ingenuity and industry of their people to\r\nhobble along.\r\n\r\nThe English cotton manufactures began about the commencement of the last\r\nreign. Ours can hardly be said to have commenced with any earnestness,\r\nuntil the application of the power-loom, in 1814, not more than ten\r\nyears ago. Now, Sir, I hardly need again speak of its progress, its\r\npresent extent, or its assurance of future enlargement. In some sorts of\r\nfabrics we are already exporters, and the products of our factories are,\r\nat this moment, in the South American markets. We see, then, what _can_\r\nbe done without prohibition or extraordinary protection, because we see\r\nwhat _has_ been done; and I venture to predict, that, in a few years, it\r\nwill be thought wonderful that these branches of manufactures, at least,\r\nshould have been thought to require additional aid from government.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, the best apology for laws of prohibition and laws of\r\nmonopoly will be found in that state of society, not only unenlightened\r\nbut sluggish, in which they are most generally established. Private\r\nindustry, in those days, required strong provocatives, which governments\r\nwere seeking to administer by these means. Something was wanted to\r\nactuate and stimulate men, and the prospects of such profits as would,\r\nin our times, excite unbounded competition, would hardly move the sloth\r\nof former ages. In some instances, no doubt, these laws produced an\r\neffect, which, in that period, would not have taken place without them.\r\nBut our age is of a wholly different character, and its legislation\r\ntakes another turn. Society is full of excitement; competition comes in\r\nplace of monopoly; and intelligence and industry ask only for fair play\r\nand an open field. Profits, indeed, in such a state of things, will be\r\nsmall, but they will be extensively diffused; prices will be low, and\r\nthe great body of the people prosperous and happy. It is worthy of\r\nremark, that, from the operation of these causes, commercial wealth,\r\nwhile it is increased beyond calculation in its general aggregate, is,\r\nat the same time, broken and diminished in its subdivisions. Commercial\r\nprosperity should be judged of, therefore, rather from the extent of\r\ntrade, than from the magnitude of its apparent profits. It has been\r\nremarked, that Spain, certainly one of the poorest nations, made very\r\ngreat profits on the amount of her trade; but with little other benefit\r\nthan the enriching of a few individuals and companies. Profits to the\r\nEnglish merchants engaged in the Levant and Turkey trade were formerly\r\nvery great, and there were richer merchants in England some centuries\r\nago, considering the comparative value of money, than at the present\r\nhighly commercial period. When the diminution of profits arises from the\r\nextent of competition, it indicates rather a salutary than an injurious\r\nchange.[8]\r\n\r\nThe true course then, Sir, for us to pursue, is, in my opinion, to\r\nconsider what our situation is; what our means are; and how they can be\r\nbest applied. What amount of population have we in comparison with our\r\nextent of soil, what amount of capital, and labor at what price? As to\r\nskill, knowledge, and enterprise, we may safely take it for granted that\r\nin these particulars we are on an equality with others. Keeping these\r\nconsiderations in view, allow me to examine two or three of those\r\nprovisions of the bill to which I feel the strongest objections.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the article of iron. Our whole annual consumption of this\r\narticle is supposed by the chairman of the committee to be forty-eight\r\nor fifty thousand tons. Let us suppose the latter. The amount of our own\r\nmanufacture he estimates, I think, at seventeen thousand tons. The\r\npresent duty on the imported article is $15 per ton, and as this duty\r\ncauses, of course, an equivalent augmentation of the price of the home\r\nmanufacture, the whole increase of price is equal to $750,000 annually.\r\nThis sum we pay on a raw material, and on an absolute necessary of life.\r\nThe bill proposes to raise the duty from $15 to $22.50 per ton, which\r\nwould be equal to $1,125,000 on the whole annual consumption. So that,\r\nsuppose the point of prohibition which is aimed at by some gentlemen to\r\nbe attained, the consumers of the article would pay this last-mentioned\r\nsum every year to the producers of it, over and above the price at which\r\nthey could supply themselves with the same article from other sources.\r\nThere would be no mitigation of this burden, except from the prospect,\r\nwhatever that might be, that iron would fall in value, by domestic\r\ncompetition, after the importation should be prohibited. It will be\r\neasy, I think, to show that it cannot fall; and supposing for the\r\npresent that it shall not, the result will be, that we shall pay\r\nannually the sum of $1,125,000, constantly augmented, too, by increased\r\nconsumption of the article, _to support a business that cannot support\r\nitself_.\r\n\r\nIt is of no consequence to the argument, that this sum is expended at\r\nhome; so it would be if we taxed the people to support any other useless\r\nand expensive establishment, to build another Capitol, for example, or\r\nincur an unnecessary expense of any sort. The question still is, Are the\r\nmoney, time, and labor well laid out in these cases? The present price\r\nof iron at Stockholm, I am assured by importers, is $53 per ton on\r\nboard, $48 in the yard before loading, and probably not far from $40 at\r\nthe mines. Freight, insurance, &c. may be fairly estimated at $15, to\r\nwhich add our present duty of $15 more, and these two last sums,\r\ntogether with the cost on board at Stockholm, give $83 as the cost of\r\nSwedes iron in our market. In fact, it is said to have been sold last\r\nyear at $81.50 to $82 per ton. We perceive, by this statement, that the\r\ncost of the iron is doubled in reaching us from the mine in which it is\r\nproduced. In other words, our present duty, with the expense of\r\ntransportation, gives an advantage to the American over the foreign\r\nmanufacturer of one hundred per cent. Why, then, cannot the iron be\r\nmanufactured at home? Our ore is said to be as good, and some of it\r\nbetter. It is under our feet, and the chairman of the committee tells us\r\nthat it might be wrought by persons who otherwise will not be employed.\r\nWhy, then, is it not wrought? Nothing could be more sure of constant\r\nsale. It is not an article of changeable fashion, but of absolute,\r\npermanent necessity, and such, therefore, as would always meet a steady\r\ndemand. Sir, I think it would be well for the chairman of the committee\r\nto revise his premises, for I am persuaded that there is an ingredient\r\nproperly belonging to the calculation which he has misstated or\r\nomitted. Swedes iron in England pays a duty, I think, of about $27 per\r\nton; yet it is imported in considerable quantities, notwithstanding the\r\nvast capital, the excellent coal, and, more important than all perhaps,\r\nthe highly improved state of inland navigation in England; although I am\r\naware that the English use of Swedes iron may be thought to be owing in\r\nsome degree to its superior quality.\r\n\r\nSir, the true explanation of this appears to me to lie in the different\r\nprices _of labor_; and here I apprehend is the grand mistake in the\r\nargument of the chairman of the committee. He says it would cost the\r\nnation, as a nation, nothing, to make our ore into iron. Now, I think it\r\nwould cost us precisely that which we can worst afford; that is, great\r\n_labor_. Although bar-iron is very properly considered a raw material in\r\nrespect to its various future uses, yet, as bar-iron, the principal\r\ningredient in its cost is labor. Of manual labor, no nation has more\r\nthan a certain quantity, nor can it be increased at will. As to some\r\noperations, indeed, its place may be supplied by machinery; but there\r\nare other services which machinery cannot perform for it, and which it\r\nmust perform for itself. A most important question for every nation, as\r\nwell as for every individual, to propose to itself, is, how it can best\r\napply that quantity of labor which it is able to perform. Labor is the\r\ngreat producer of wealth; it moves all other causes. If it call\r\nmachinery to its aid, it is still employed, not only in using the\r\nmachinery, but in making it. Now, with respect to the quantity of labor,\r\nas we all know, different nations are differently circumstanced. Some\r\nneed, more than any thing, work for hands, others require hands for\r\nwork; and if we ourselves are not absolutely in the latter class, we are\r\nstill most fortunately very near it. I cannot find that we have those\r\nidle hands, of which the chairman of the committee speaks. The price of\r\nlabor is a conclusive and unanswerable refutation of that idea; it is\r\nknown to be higher with us than in any other civilized state, and this\r\nis the greatest of all proofs of general happiness. Labor in this\r\ncountry is independent and proud. It has not to ask the patronage of\r\ncapital, but capital solicits the aid of labor. This is the general\r\ntruth in regard to the condition of our whole population, although in\r\nthe large cities there are doubtless many exceptions. The mere capacity\r\nto labor in common agricultural employments, gives to our young men the\r\nassurance of independence. We have been asked, Sir, by the chairman of\r\nthe committee, in a tone of some pathos, whether we will allow to the\r\nserfs of Russia and Sweden the benefit of making iron for us. Let me\r\ninform the gentleman, Sir, that those same serfs do not earn more than\r\nseven cents a day, and that they work in these mines for that\r\ncompensation because they are serfs. And let me ask the gentleman\r\nfurther, whether we have any labor in this country that cannot be better\r\nemployed than in a business which does not yield the laborer more than\r\nseven cents a day? This, it appears to me, is the true question for our\r\nconsideration. There is no reason for saying that we will work iron\r\nbecause we have mountains that contain the ore. We might for the same\r\nreason dig among our rocks for the scattered grains of gold and silver\r\nwhich might be found there. The true inquiry is, Can we produce the\r\narticle in a useful state at the same cost, or nearly at the same cost,\r\nor at any reasonable approximation towards the same cost, at which we\r\ncan import it?\r\n\r\nSome general estimates of the price and profits of labor, in those\r\ncountries from which we import our iron, might be formed by comparing\r\nthe reputed products of different mines, and their prices, with the\r\nnumber of hands employed. The mines of Danemora are said to yield about\r\n4,000 tons, and to employ in the mines twelve hundred workmen. Suppose\r\nthis to be worth $50 per ton; any one will find by computation, that the\r\nwhole product would not pay, in this country, for one quarter part of\r\nthe necessary labor. The whole export of Sweden was estimated, a few\r\nyears ago, at 400,000 ship pounds, or about 54,000 tons. Comparing this\r\nproduct with the number of workmen usually supposed to be employed in\r\nthe mines which produce iron for exportation, the result will not\r\ngreatly differ from the foregoing. These estimates are general, and\r\nmight not conduct us to a precise result; but we know, from intelligent\r\ntravellers, and eye-witnesses, that the price of labor in the Swedish\r\nmines does not exceed seven cents a day.[9]\r\n\r\nThe true reason, Sir, why it is not our policy to compel our citizens to\r\nmanufacture our own iron, is that they are far better employed. It is an\r\nunproductive business, and they are not poor enough to be obliged to\r\nfollow it. If we had more of poverty, more of misery, and something of\r\nservitude, if we had an ignorant, idle, starving population, we might\r\nset up for iron makers against the world.\r\n\r\nThe committee will take notice, Mr. Chairman, that, under our present\r\nduty, together with the expense of transportation, our manufacturers are\r\nable to supply their own immediate neighborhood; and this proves the\r\nmagnitude of that substantial encouragement which these two causes\r\nconcur to give. There is little or no foreign iron, I presume, used in\r\nthe county of Lancaster. This is owing to the heavy expense of land\r\ncarriage; and as we recede farther from the coast, the manufacturers are\r\nstill more completely secured, as to their own immediate market, against\r\nthe competition of the imported article. But what they ask is to be\r\nallowed to supply the sea-coast, at such a price as shall be formed by\r\nadding to the cost at the mines the expense of land carriage to the sea;\r\nand this appears to me most unreasonable. The effect of it would be to\r\ncompel the consumer to pay the cost of two land transportations; for, in\r\nthe first place, the price of iron at the inland furnaces will always be\r\nfound to be at, or not much below, the price of the imported article in\r\nthe seaport, and the cost of transportation to the neighborhood of the\r\nfurnace; and to enable the home product to hold a competition with the\r\nimported in the seaport, the cost of another transportation downward,\r\nfrom the furnace to the coast, must be added. Until our means of inland\r\ncommerce be improved, and the charges of transportation by that means\r\nlessened, it appears to me wholly impracticable, with such duties as any\r\none would think of proposing, to meet the wishes of the manufacturers of\r\nthis article. Suppose we were to add the duty proposed by this bill,\r\nalthough it would benefit the capital invested in works near the sea and\r\nthe navigable rivers, yet the benefit would not extend far in the\r\ninterior. Where, then, are we to stop, or what limit is proposed to us?\r\n\r\nThe freight of iron has been afforded from Sweden to the United States\r\nas low as eight dollars per ton. This is not more than the price of\r\nfifty miles of land carriage. Stockholm, therefore, for the purpose of\r\nthis argument, may be considered as within fifty miles of Philadelphia.\r\nNow, it is at once a just and a strong view of this case, to consider,\r\nthat there are, within fifty miles of our market, vast multitudes of\r\npersons who are willing to labor in the production of this article for\r\nus, at the rate of seven cents per day, while we have no labor which\r\nwill not command, upon the average, at least five or six times that\r\namount. The question is, then, shall we buy this article of these\r\nmanufacturers, and suffer our own labor to earn its greater reward, or\r\nshall we employ our own labor in a similar manufacture, and make up to\r\nit, by a tax on consumers, the loss which it must necessarily sustain.\r\n\r\nI proceed, Sir, to the article of hemp. Of this we imported last year,\r\nin round numbers, 6,000 tons, paying a duty of $30 a ton, or $180,000 on\r\nthe whole amount; and this article, it is to be remembered, is consumed\r\nalmost entirely in the uses of navigation. The whole burden may be said\r\nto fall on one interest. It is said we can produce this article if we\r\nwill raise the duties. But why is it not produced now? or why, at least,\r\nhave we not seen some specimens? for the present is a very high duty,\r\nwhen expenses of importation are added. Hemp was purchased at St.\r\nPetersburg, last year, at $101.67 per ton. Charges attending shipment,\r\n&c., $14.25. Freight may be stated at $30 per ton, and our existing duty\r\n$30 more. These three last sums, being the charges of transportation,\r\namount to a protection of near seventy-five per cent in favor of the\r\nhome manufacturer, if there be any such. And we ought to consider, also,\r\nthat the price of hemp at St. Petersburg is increased by all the expense\r\nof transportation from the place of growth to that port; so that\r\nprobably the whole cost of transportation, from the place of growth to\r\nour market, including our duty, is equal to the first cost of the\r\narticle; or, in other words, is a protection in favor of our own product\r\nof one hundred per cent.\r\n\r\nAnd since it is stated that we have great quantities of fine land for\r\nthe production of hemp, of which I have no doubt, the question recurs,\r\nWhy is it not produced? I speak of the water-rotted hemp, for it is\r\nadmitted that that which is dew-rotted is not sufficiently good for the\r\nrequisite purposes. I cannot say whether the cause be in climate, in the\r\nprocess of rotting, or what else, but the fact is certain, that there is\r\nno American water-rotted hemp in the market. We are acting, therefore,\r\nupon an hypothesis. Is it not reasonable that those who say that they\r\n_can_ produce the article shall at least prove the truth of that\r\nallegation, before new taxes are laid on those who use the foreign\r\ncommodity? Suppose this bill passes; the price of hemp is immediately\r\nraised $14.80 per ton, and this burden falls immediately on the\r\nship-builder; and no part of it, for the present, will go for the\r\nbenefit of the American grower, because he has none of the article than\r\ncan be used, nor is it expected that much of it will be produced for a\r\nconsiderable time. Still the tax takes effect upon the imported article;\r\nand the ship-owners, to enable the Kentucky farmer to receive an\r\nadditional $14 on his ton of hemp, whenever he may be able to raise and\r\nmanufacture it, pay, in the mean time, an equal sum per ton into the\r\ntreasury on all the imported hemp which they are still obliged to use;\r\nand this is called \"protection\"! Is this just or fair? A particular\r\ninterest is here burdened, not only for the benefit of another\r\nparticular interest, but burdened also beyond that, for the benefit of\r\nthe treasury. It is said to be important for the country that this\r\narticle should be raised in it; then let the country bear the expense,\r\nand pay the bounty. If it be for the good of the whole, let the\r\nsacrifice be made by the whole, and not by a part. If it be thought\r\nuseful and necessary, from political considerations, to encourage the\r\ngrowth and manufacture of hemp, government has abundant means of doing\r\nit. It might give a direct bounty, and such a measure would, at least,\r\ndistribute the burden equally; or, as government itself is a great\r\nconsumer of this article, it might stipulate to confine its own\r\npurchases to the home product, so soon as it should be shown to be of\r\nthe proper quality. I see no objection to this proceeding, if it be\r\nthought to be an object to encourage the production. It might easily,\r\nand perhaps properly, be provided by law, that the navy should be\r\nsupplied with American hemp, the quality being good, at any price not\r\nexceeding, by more than a given amount, the current price of foreign\r\nhemp in our market. Every thing conspires to render some such course\r\npreferable to the one now proposed. The encouragement in that way would\r\nbe ample, and, if the experiment should succeed, the whole object would\r\nbe gained; and, if it should fail, no considerable loss or evil would be\r\nfelt by any one.\r\n\r\nI stated, some days ago, and I wish to renew the statement, what was the\r\namount of the proposed augmentation of the duties on iron and hemp, in\r\nthe cost of a vessel. Take the case of a common ship of three hundred\r\ntons, not coppered, nor copper-fastened. It would stand thus, by the\r\npresent duties:--\r\n\r\n14-1/2 tons of iron, for hull, rigging, and\r\n     and anchors, at $15 per ton,          $217.50\r\n10 tons of hemp, at $30,                    300.00\r\n40 bolts Russia duck, at $2,                 80.00\r\n20 bolts Ravens duck, at $1.25,              25.00\r\nOn articles of ship-chandlery, cabin\r\n     furniture, hard-ware, &c.,              40.00\r\n                                           _______\r\n                                           $662.50\r\n                                           -------\r\n\r\nThe bill proposes to add,--\r\n\r\n$7.40 per ton on iron, which will be       $107.30\r\n$14.80 per ton on hemp, equal to            148.00\r\nAnd on duck, by the late amendment\r\n     of the bill, say 25 per cent,           25.00\r\n                                           _______\r\n                                           $280.30\r\n                                           _______\r\n\r\nBut to the duties on iron and hemp should be added those paid on copper,\r\nwhenever that article is used. By the statement which I furnished the\r\nother day, it appeared that the duties received by government on\r\narticles used in the construction of a vessel of three hundred and\r\nfifty-nine tons, with copper fastenings, amounted to $1,056. With the\r\naugmentations of this bill, they would be equal to $1,400.\r\n\r\nNow I cannot but flatter myself, Mr. Chairman, that, before the\r\ncommittee will consent to this new burden upon the shipping interest, it\r\nwill very deliberately weigh the probable consequences. I would again\r\nurgently solicit its attention to the condition of that interest. We are\r\ntold that government has protected it, by discriminating duties, and by\r\nan exclusive right to the coasting trade. But it would retain the\r\ncoasting trade by its own natural efforts, in like manner, and with more\r\ncertainty, than it now retains any portion of foreign trade. The\r\ndiscriminating duties are now abolished, and while they existed, they\r\nwere nothing more than countervailing measures; not so much designed to\r\ngive our navigation an advantage over that of other nations, as to put\r\nit upon an equality; and we have, accordingly, abolished ours, when they\r\nhave been willing to abolish theirs. Look to the rate of freights. Were\r\nthey ever lower, or even so low? I ask gentlemen who know, whether the\r\nharbor of Charleston, and the river of Savannah, be not crowded with\r\nships seeking employment, and finding none? I would ask the gentlemen\r\nfrom New Orleans, if their magnificent Mississippi does not exhibit, for\r\nfurlongs, a forest of masts? The condition, Sir, of the shipping\r\ninterest is not that of those who are insisting on high profits, or\r\nstruggling for monopoly; but it is the condition of men content with the\r\nsmallest earnings, and anxious for their bread. The freight of cotton\r\nhas formerly been three pence sterling, from Charleston to Liverpool, in\r\ntime of peace. It is now I know not what, or how many fractions of a\r\npenny; I think, however, it is stated at five eighths. The producers,\r\nthen, of this great staple, are able, by means of this navigation, to\r\nsend it, for a cent a pound, from their own doors to the best market in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman, I will now only remind the committee that, while we are\r\nproposing to add new burdens to the shipping interest, a very different\r\nline of policy is followed by our great commercial and maritime rival.\r\nIt seems to be announced as the sentiment of the government of England,\r\nand undoubtedly it is its real sentiment, that the first of all\r\nmanufactures is the manufacture of ships. A constant and wakeful\r\nattention is paid to this interest, and very important regulations,\r\nfavorable to it, have been adopted within the last year, some of which I\r\nwill beg leave to refer to, with the hope of exciting the notice, not\r\nonly of the committee, but of all others who may feel, as I do, a deep\r\ninterest in this subject. In the first place, a general amendment has\r\ntaken place in the register acts, introducing many new provisions, and,\r\namong others, the following:--\r\n\r\nA direct mortgage of the interest of a ship is allowed, without\r\nsubjecting the mortgagee to the responsibility of an owner.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of interest held by each owner is exhibited in the\r\nregister, thereby facilitating both sales and mortgages, and giving a\r\nnew value to shipping among the moneyed classes.\r\n\r\nShares, in the ships of copartnerships, may be registered as joint\r\nproperty, and subject to the same rules as other partnership effects.\r\n\r\nShips may be registered in the name of trustees, for the benefit of\r\njoint-stock companies.\r\n\r\nAnd many other regulations are adopted, with the same general view of\r\nrendering the mode of holding the property as convenient and as\r\nfavorable as possible.\r\n\r\nBy another act, British registered vessels, of every description, are\r\nallowed to enter into the general and the coasting trade in the India\r\nseas, and may now trade to and from India, with any part of the world\r\nexcept China.\r\n\r\nBy a third, all limitations and restrictions, as to latitude and\r\nlongitude, are removed from ships engaged in the Southern whale-fishery.\r\nThese regulations, I presume, have not been made without first obtaining\r\nthe consent of the East India Company; so true is it found, that real\r\nencouragement of enterprise oftener consists, in our days, in\r\nrestraining or buying off monopolies and prohibitions, than in imposing\r\nor extending them.\r\n\r\nThe trade with Ireland is turned into a free coasting trade; light\r\nduties have been reduced, and various other beneficial arrangements\r\nmade, and still others proposed. I might add, that, in favor of general\r\ncommerce, and as showing their confidence in the principles of liberal\r\nintercourse, the British government has perfected the warehouse system,\r\nand authorized a reciprocity of duties with foreign states, at the\r\ndiscretion of the Privy Council.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is the attention which our great rival is paying to these\r\nimportant subjects, and we may assure ourselves that, if we do not\r\ncherish a proper sense of our own interests, she will not only beat us,\r\nbut will deserve to beat us.\r\n\r\nSir, I will detain you no longer. There are some parts of this bill\r\nwhich I highly approve; there are others in which I should acquiesce;\r\nbut those to which I have now stated my objections appear to me so\r\ndestitute of all justice, so burdensome and so dangerous to that\r\ninterest which has steadily enriched, gallantly defended, and proudly\r\ndistinguished us, that nothing can prevail upon me to give it my\r\nsupport.[10]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThis is commonly called Mr. Webster's \"Free Trade\" speech. It has been\r\nfound difficult to select one among his many speeches in support of the\r\npolicy of Protection which would fully represent his views on the\r\nsubject; but the reasons for his change of opinion, and for his advocacy\r\nof Protection, are fully stated in many of the speeches printed in this\r\nvolume, delivered after the year 1830. Perhaps as good a statement as\r\ncan be selected from his many speeches on the Tariff, in explanation of\r\nhis change of position as to the need, policy, and duty of protection to\r\nAmerican manufactures, may be found in his speech delivered in the\r\nSenate of the United States, on the 25th and 26th of July, 1846, on the\r\nBill \"To reduce the Duties on Imports, and for other Purposes.\" In this\r\nspeech, he made the following frank avowal of the reasons which induced\r\nhim to reconsider and reverse his original opinions on the subject:--\r\n\r\n     \"But, Sir, before I proceed further with this part of the case, I\r\n     will take notice of what appears, latterly, to be an attempt, by\r\n     the republication of opinions and expressions, arguments and\r\n     speeches of mine, at an earlier and later period of life, to found\r\n     against me a charge of inconsistency, on this subject of the\r\n     protective policy of the country. Mr. President, if it be an\r\n     inconsistency to hold an opinion upon a subject at one time and in\r\n     one state of circumstances, and to hold a different opinion upon\r\n     the same subject at another time and in a different state of\r\n     circumstances, I admit the charge. Nay, Sir, I will go further; and\r\n     in regard to questions which, from their nature, do not depend upon\r\n     circumstances for their true and just solution, I mean\r\n     constitutional questions, if it be an inconsistency to hold an\r\n     opinion to-day, even upon such a question, and on that same\r\n     question to hold a different opinion a quarter of a century\r\n     afterwards, upon a more comprehensive view of the whole subject,\r\n     with a more thorough investigation into the original purposes and\r\n     objects of that Constitution, and especially after a more thorough\r\n     exposition of those objects and purposes by those who framed it,\r\n     and have been trusted to administer it, I should not shrink even\r\n     from that imputation. I hope I know more of the Constitution of my\r\n     country than I did when I was twenty years old. I hope I have\r\n     contemplated its great objects more broadly. I hope I have read\r\n     with deeper interest the sentiments of the great men who framed it.\r\n     I hope I have studied with more care the condition of the country\r\n     when the convention assembled to form it. And yet I do not know\r\n     that I have much to retract or to change on these points.\r\n\r\n     \"But, Sir, I am of the opinion of a very eminent person, who had\r\n     occasion, not long since, to speak of this topic in another place.\r\n     Inconsistencies of opinion, arising from changes of circumstances,\r\n     are often justifiable. But there is one sort of inconsistency which\r\n     is culpable. It is the inconsistency between a man's conviction and\r\n     his vote; between his conscience and his conduct. No man shall ever\r\n     charge me with an inconsistency like that. And now, Sir, allow me\r\n     to say, that I am quite indifferent, or rather thankful, to those\r\n     conductors of the public press who think they cannot do better than\r\n     now and then to spread my poor opinions before the public.\r\n\r\n     \"I have said many times, and it is true, that, up to the year 1824,\r\n     the people of that part of the country to which I belong, being\r\n     addicted to commerce, having been successful in commerce, their\r\n     capital being very much engaged in commerce, were averse to\r\n     entering upon a system of manufacturing operations. Every member in\r\n     Congress from the State of Massachusetts, with the exception, I\r\n     think, of one, voted against the act of 1824. But what were we to\r\n     do? Were we not bound, after 1817 and 1824, to consider that the\r\n     policy of the country was settled, had become settled, as a policy,\r\n     to protect the domestic industry of the country by solemn laws? The\r\n     leading speech[11] which ushered in the act of 1824 was called a\r\n     speech for the 'American System.' The bill was carried principally\r\n     by the Middle States. Pennsylvania and New York would have it so;\r\n     and what were we to do? Were we to stand aloof from the occupations\r\n     which others were pursuing around us? Were we to pick clean teeth\r\n     on a constitutional doubt which a majority in the councils of the\r\n     nation had overruled? No, Sir; we had no option. All that was left\r\n     us was to fall in with the settled policy of the country; because,\r\n     if any thing can ever settle the policy of the country, or if any\r\n     thing can ever settle the practical construction of the\r\n     Constitution of the country, it must be these repeated decisions of\r\n     Congress, and enactments of successive laws conformable to these\r\n     decisions. New England, then, did fall in. She went into\r\n     manufacturing operations, not from original choice, but from the\r\n     necessity of the circumstances in which the legislation of the\r\n     country had placed her. And, for one, I resolved then, and have\r\n     acted upon the resolution ever since, that, having compelled the\r\n     Eastern States to go into these pursuits for a livelihood, the\r\n     country was bound to fulfil the just expectations which it had\r\n     inspired.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Clay.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Lord Lansdowne.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Lord Liverpool.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Mr. Huskisson, President of the English Board of Trade.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The Marquess of Lansdowne.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Lord Liverpool.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Mr. Tod.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: \"The present equable diffusion of moderate wealth cannot be\r\nbetter illustrated, than by remarking that in this age many palaces and\r\nsuperb mansions have been pulled down, or converted to other purposes,\r\nwhile none have been erected on a like scale.

The provisions which they receive\r\nfrom the magazines are deducted from this pay.\" The value of the rouble\r\nat that time (1799) was about twenty-four pence sterling, or forty-five\r\ncents of our money.\r\n\r\n\"By the edict of 1799,\" it is added, \"a laborer with a horse shall\r\nreceive, daily, in summer, twenty, and in winter, twelve copecks; a\r\nlaborer without a horse, in summer, ten, in winter, eight copecks.\"\r\n\r\nA copeck is the hundredth part of a rouble, or about half a cent of our\r\nmoney.

Aaron Ogden filed his\r\nbill in the Court of Chancery of that State, against Thomas Gibbons,\r\nsetting forth the several acts of the legislature thereof, enacted for\r\nthe purpose of securing to Robert R. Livingston and Robert Fulton the\r\nexclusive navigation of all the waters within the jurisdiction of that\r\nState, with boats moved by fire or steam, for a term of years which had\r\nnot then expired; and authorizing the Chancellor to award an injunction,\r\nrestraining any person whatever from navigating those waters with boats\r\nof that description. The bill stated an assignment from Livingston and\r\nFulton to one John R. Livingston, and from him to the complainant,\r\nOgden, of the right to navigate the waters between Elizabethtown, and\r\nother places in New Jersey, and the city of New York; and that Gibbons,\r\nthe defendant below, was in possession of two steamboats, called the\r\nStoudinger and the Bellona, which were actually employed in running\r\nbetween New York and Elizabethtown, in violation of the exclusive\r\nprivilege conferred on the complainant, and praying an injunction to\r\nrestrain the said Gibbons from using the said boats, or any other\r\npropelled by fire or steam, in navigating the waters within the\r\nterritory of New York.\r\n\r\nThe injunction having been awarded, the answer of Gibbons was filed, in\r\nwhich he stated, that the boats employed by him were duly enrolled and\r\nlicensed to be employed in carrying on the coasting trade, under the act\r\nof Congress, passed the 18th of February, 1793, ch. 8, entitled, \"An Act\r\nfor enrolling and licensing ships and vessels to be employed in the\r\ncoasting trade and fisheries, and for regulating the same.\" And the\r\ndefendant insisted on his right, in virtue of such licenses, to navigate\r\nthe waters between Elizabethtown and the city of New York, the said acts\r\nof the legislature of the State of New York to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding. At the hearing, the Chancellor perpetuated the\r\ninjunction, being of the opinion that the said acts were not repugnant\r\nto the Constitution and laws of the United States, and were valid. This\r\ndecree was affirmed in the Court for the Trial of Impeachments and\r\nCorrection of Errors, which is the highest court of law and equity in\r\nthe State of New York before which the cause could be carried, and it\r\nwas thereupon carried up to the Supreme Court of the United States by\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nThe following argument was made by Mr. Webster, for the plaintiff in\r\nerror.]\r\n\r\nIt is admitted, that there is a very respectable weight of authority in\r\nfavor of the decision which is sought to be reversed. The laws in\r\nquestion, I am aware, have been deliberately re-enacted by the\r\nlegislature of New York; and they have also received the sanction, at\r\ndifferent times, of all her judicial tribunals, than which there are\r\nfew, if any, in the country, more justly entitled to respect and\r\ndeference. The disposition of the court will be, undoubtedly, to\r\nsupport, if it can, laws so passed and so sanctioned. I admit,\r\ntherefore, that it is justly expected of us that we should make out a\r\nclear case; and unless we do so, we cannot hope for a reversal. It\r\nshould be remembered, however, that the whole of this branch of power,\r\nas exercised by this court, is a power of revision. The question must be\r\ndecided by the State courts, and decided in a particular manner, before\r\nit can be brought here at all. Such decisions alone give this court\r\njurisdiction; and therefore, while they are to be respected as the\r\njudgments of learned judges, they are yet in the condition of all\r\ndecisions from which the law allows an appeal.\r\n\r\nIt will not be a waste of time to advert to the existing state of the\r\nfacts connected with the subject of this litigation. The use of\r\nsteamboats on the coasts and in the bays and rivers of the country, has\r\nbecome very general. The intercourse of its different parts essentially\r\ndepends upon this mode of conveyance and transportation. Rivers and\r\nbays, in many cases, form the divisions between States; and thence it is\r\nobvious, that, if the States should make regulations for the navigation\r\nof these waters, and such regulations should be repugnant and hostile,\r\nembarrassment would necessarily be caused to the general intercourse of\r\nthe community. Such events have actually occurred, and have created the\r\nexisting state of things.\r\n\r\nBy the law of New York, no one can navigate the bay of New York, the\r\nNorth River, the Sound, the lakes, or any of the waters of that State,\r\nby steam-vessels, without a license from the grantees of New York, under\r\npenalty of forfeiture of the vessel.\r\n\r\nBy the law of the neighboring State of Connecticut, no one can enter her\r\nwaters with a steam-vessel having such license.\r\n\r\nBy the law of New Jersey, if any citizen of that State shall be\r\nrestrained, under the New York law, from using steamboats between the\r\nancient shores of New Jersey and New York, he shall be entitled to an\r\naction for damages, in New Jersey, with treble costs against the party\r\nwho thus restrains or impedes him under the law of New York! This act of\r\nNew Jersey is called an act of retortion against the illegal and\r\noppressive legislation of New York; and seems to be defended on those\r\ngrounds of public law which justify reprisals between independent\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt will hardly be contended, that all these acts are consistent with the\r\nlaws and Constitution of the United States. If there is no power in the\r\ngeneral government to control this extreme belligerent legislation of\r\nthe States, the powers of the government are essentially deficient in a\r\nmost important and interesting particular. The present controversy\r\nrespects the earliest of these State laws, those of New York. On these,\r\nthis court is now to pronounce; and if they should be declared to be\r\nvalid and operative, I hope somebody will point out where the State\r\nright stops, and on what grounds the acts of other States are to be held\r\ninoperative and void.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to advert more particularly to the laws of New\r\nYork, as they are stated in the record. The first was passed March 19th,\r\n1787. By this act, a sole and exclusive right was granted to John Fitch,\r\nof making and using every kind of boat or vessel impelled by steam, in\r\nall creeks, rivers, bays, and waters within the territory and\r\njurisdiction of New York for fourteen years.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of March, 1798, an act was passed, on the suggestion that\r\nFitch was dead, or had withdrawn from the State without having made any\r\nattempt to use his privilege, repealing the grant to him, and conferring\r\nsimilar privileges on Robert R. Livingston, for the term of twenty\r\nyears, on a suggestion, made by him, that he was possessor of a mode of\r\napplying the steam-engine to propel a boat, on new and advantageous\r\nprinciples. On the 5th of April, 1803, another act was passed, by which\r\nit was declared, that the rights and privileges granted to Robert R.\r\nLivingston by the last act should be extended to him and Robert Fulton,\r\nfor twenty years from the passing of the act. Then there is the act of\r\nApril 11, 1808, purporting to extend the monopoly, in point of time,\r\nfive years for every additional boat, the whole duration, however, not\r\nto exceed thirty years; and forbidding any and all persons to navigate\r\nthe waters of the State with any steam boat or vessel, without the\r\nlicense of Livingston and Fulton, under penalty of forfeiture of the\r\nboat or vessel. And lastly comes the act of April 9, 1811, for enforcing\r\nthe provisions of the last-mentioned act, and declaring, that the\r\nforfeiture of the boat or vessel found navigating against the provisions\r\nof the previous acts shall be deemed to accrue on the day on which such\r\nboat or vessel should navigate the waters of the State; and that\r\nLivingston and Fulton might immediately have an action for such boat or\r\nvessel, in like manner as if they themselves had been dispossessed\r\nthereof by force; and that, on bringing any such suit, the defendant\r\ntherein should be prohibited, by injunction, from removing the boat or\r\nvessel out of the State, or using it within the State. There are one or\r\ntwo other acts mentioned in the pleadings, which principally respect the\r\ntime allowed for complying with the condition of the grant, and are not\r\nmaterial to the discussion of the case.\r\n\r\nBy these acts, then, an exclusive right is given to Livingston and\r\nFulton to use steam navigation on all the waters of New York, for thirty\r\nyears from 1808.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to recite the several conveyances and agreements,\r\nstated in the record, by which Ogden, the plaintiff below, derives title\r\nunder Livingston and Fulton to the exclusive use of part of these waters\r\nfor steam navigation.\r\n\r\nThe appellant being owner of a steamboat, and being found navigating the\r\nwaters between New Jersey and the city of New York, over which waters\r\nOgden, the plaintiff below, claims an exclusive right, under Livingston\r\nand Fulton, this bill was filed against him by Ogden, in October, 1818,\r\nand an injunction granted, restraining him from such use of his boat.\r\nThis injunction was made perpetual, on the final hearing of the cause,\r\nin the Court of Chancery; and the decree of the Chancellor has been duly\r\naffirmed in the Court of Errors. The right, therefore, which the\r\nplaintiff below asserts, to have and maintain his injunction, depends\r\nobviously on the general validity of the New York laws, and especially\r\non their force and operation as against the right set up by the\r\ndefendant. This right he states in his answer to be, that he is a\r\ncitizen of New Jersey, and owner of the steamboat in question; that the\r\nboat is a vessel of more than twenty tons burden, duly enrolled and\r\nlicensed for carrying on the coasting trade, and intended to be employed\r\nby him in that trade, between Elizabethtown, in New Jersey, and the city\r\nof New York; and that it was actually employed in navigating between\r\nthose places at the time of, and until notice of, the injunction from\r\nthe Court of Chancery was served on him.\r\n\r\nOn these pleadings the substantial question is raised, Are these laws\r\nsuch as the legislature of New York has a right to pass? If so, do they,\r\nsecondly, in their operation, interfere with any right enjoyed under the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States, and are they therefore void,\r\nas far as such interference extends?\r\n\r\nIt may be well to state again their general purport and effect, and the\r\npurport and effect of the other State laws which have been enacted by\r\nway of retaliation.\r\n\r\nA steam-vessel, of any description, going to New York, is forfeited to\r\nthe representatives of Livingston and Fulton, unless she have their\r\nlicense. Going from New York or elsewhere to Connecticut, she is\r\nprohibited from entering the waters of that State if she have such\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\nIf the representatives of Livingston and Fulton in New York carry into\r\neffect, by judicial process, the provision of the New York laws, against\r\nany citizen of New Jersey, they expose themselves to a statute action in\r\nNew Jersey for all damages, and treble costs.\r\n\r\nThe New York laws extend to all steam-vessels; to steam frigates, steam\r\nferry-boats, and all intermediate classes. They extend to public as well\r\nas private ships; and to vessels employed in foreign commerce, as well\r\nas to those employed in the coasting trade.\r\n\r\nThe remedy is as summary as the grant itself is ample; for immediate\r\nconfiscation, without seizure, trial, or judgment, is the penalty of\r\ninfringement.\r\n\r\nIn regard to these acts, I shall contend, in the first place, that they\r\nexceed the power of the legislature; and, secondly, that, if they could\r\nbe considered valid for any purpose, they are void still, as against any\r\nright enjoyed under the laws of the United States with which they come\r\nin collision; and that in this case they are found interfering with such\r\nrights.\r\n\r\nI shall contend that the power of Congress to regulate commerce is\r\ncomplete and entire, and, to a certain extent, necessarily exclusive;\r\nthat the acts in question are regulations of commerce, in a most\r\nimportant particular, affecting it in those respects in which it is\r\nunder the exclusive authority of Congress. I state this first\r\nproposition guardedly. I do not mean to say, that all regulations which\r\nmay, in their operation, affect commerce, are exclusively in the power\r\nof Congress; but that such power as has been exercised in this case does\r\nnot remain with the States. Nothing is more complex than commerce; and\r\nin such an age as this, no words embrace a wider field than _commercial\r\nregulation_. Almost all the business and intercourse of life may be\r\nconnected incidentally, more or less, with commercial regulations. But\r\nit is only necessary to apply to this part of the Constitution the\r\nwell-settled rules of construction. Some powers are held to be exclusive\r\nin Congress, from the use of exclusive words in the grant; others, from\r\nthe prohibitions on the States to exercise similar powers; and others,\r\nagain, from the nature of the powers themselves. It has been by this\r\nmode of reasoning that the court has adjudicated many important\r\nquestions; and the same mode is proper here. And, as some powers have\r\nbeen held to be exclusive, and others not so, under the same form of\r\nexpression, from the nature of the different powers respectively; so\r\nwhere the power, on any one subject, is given in general words, like the\r\npower to regulate commerce, the true method of construction will be to\r\nconsider of what parts the grant is composed, and which of those, from\r\nthe nature of the thing, ought to be considered exclusive. The right set\r\nup in this case, under the laws of New York, is a monopoly. Now I think\r\nit very reasonable to say, that the Constitution never intended to leave\r\nwith the States the power of granting monopolies either of trade or of\r\nnavigation; and therefore, that, as to this, the commercial power is\r\nexclusive in Congress.\r\n\r\nIt is in vain to look for a precise and exact _definition_ of the powers\r\nof Congress on several subjects. The Constitution does not undertake the\r\ntask of making such exact definitions. In conferring powers, it proceeds\r\nby the way of _enumeration_, stating the powers conferred, one after\r\nanother, in few words and where the power is general or complex in its\r\nnature, the extent of the grant must necessarily be judged of, and\r\nlimited, by its object, and by the nature of the power.\r\n\r\nFew things are better known than the immediate causes which led to the\r\nadoption of the present Constitution; and there is nothing, as I think,\r\nclearer, than that the prevailing motive was _to regulate commerce_; to\r\nrescue it from the embarrassing and destructive consequences resulting\r\nfrom the legislation of so many different States, and to place it under\r\nthe protection of a uniform law. The great objects were commerce and\r\nrevenue; and they were objects indissolubly connected. By the\r\nConfederation, divers restrictions had been imposed on the States; but\r\nthese had not been found sufficient. No State, it is true, could send or\r\nreceive an embassy; nor make any treaty; nor enter into any compact with\r\nanother State, or with a foreign power; nor lay duties interfering with\r\ntreaties which had been entered into by Congress. But all these were\r\nfound to be far short of what the actual condition of the country\r\nrequired. The States could still, each for itself, regulate commerce,\r\nand the consequence was a perpetual jarring and hostility of commercial\r\nregulation.\r\n\r\nIn the history of the times, it is accordingly found, that the great\r\ntopic, urged on all occasions, as showing the necessity of a new and\r\ndifferent government, was the state of trade and commerce. To benefit\r\nand improve these was a great object in itself; and it became greater\r\nwhen it was regarded as the only means of enabling the country to pay\r\nthe public debt, and to do justice to those who had most effectually\r\nlabored for its independence. The leading state papers of the time are\r\nfull of this topic. The New Jersey resolutions[1] complain that the\r\nregulation of trade was in the power of the several States, within their\r\nseparate jurisdiction, to such a degree as to involve many difficulties\r\nand embarrassments; and they express an earnest opinion, that the sole\r\nand exclusive power of regulating trade with foreign states ought to be\r\nin Congress. Mr. Witherspoon's motion in Congress, in 1781, is of the\r\nsame general character; and the report of a committee of that body, in\r\n1785, is still more emphatic. It declares that Congress ought to possess\r\nthe sole and exclusive power of regulating trade, as well with foreign\r\nnations as between the States.[2] The resolutions of Virginia, in\r\nJanuary, 1786, which were the immediate cause of the Convention, put\r\nforth this same great object. Indeed, it is the only object stated in\r\nthose resolutions. There is not another idea in the whole document. The\r\nsole purpose for which the delegates assembled at Annapolis was to\r\ndevise means for the uniform regulation of trade. They found no means\r\nbut in a general government; and they recommended a convention to\r\naccomplish that purpose. Over whatever other interests of the country\r\nthis government may diffuse its benefits and its blessings, it will\r\nalways be true, as matter of historical fact, that it had its immediate\r\norigin in the necessities of commerce; and for its immediate object, the\r\nrelief of those necessities, by removing their causes, and by\r\nestablishing a uniform and steady system. It will be easy to show, by\r\nreference to the discussions in the several State conventions, the\r\nprevalence of the same general topics; and if any one would look to the\r\nproceedings of several of the States, especially to those of\r\nMassachusetts and New York, he would see very plainly, by the recorded\r\nlists of votes, that wherever this commercial necessity was most\r\nstrongly felt, there the proposed new Constitution had most friends. In\r\nthe New York convention, the argument arising from this consideration\r\nwas strongly pressed, by the distinguished person[3] whose name is\r\nconnected with the present question.\r\n\r\nWe do not find, in the history of the formation and adoption of the\r\nConstitution, that any man speaks of a general concurrent power, in the\r\nregulation of foreign and domestic trade, as still residing in the\r\nStates. The very object intended, more than any other, was to take away\r\nsuch power. If it had not so provided, the Constitution would not have\r\nbeen worth accepting.\r\n\r\nI contend, therefore, that the people intended, in establishing the\r\nConstitution, to transfer from the several States to a general\r\ngovernment those high and important powers over commerce, which, in\r\ntheir exercise, were to maintain a uniform and general system. From the\r\nvery nature of the case, these powers must be exclusive; that is, the\r\nhigher branches of commercial regulation must be exclusively committed\r\nto a single hand. What is it that is to be regulated? Not the commerce\r\nof the several States, respectively, but the commerce of the United\r\nStates. Henceforth, the commerce of the States was to be a _unit_, and\r\nthe system by which it was to exist and be governed must necessarily be\r\ncomplete, entire, and uniform. Its character was to be described in the\r\nflag which waved over it, E PLURIBUS UNUM. Now, how could individual\r\nStates assert a right of concurrent legislation, in a case of this sort,\r\nwithout manifest encroachment and confusion? It should be repeated, that\r\nthe words used in the Constitution, \"to regulate commerce,\" are so very\r\ngeneral and extensive, that they may be construed to cover a vast field\r\nof legislation, part of which has always been occupied by State laws;\r\nand therefore the words must have a reasonable construction, and the\r\npower should be considered as exclusively vested in Congress so far, and\r\nso far only, as the nature of the power requires. And I insist, that the\r\nnature of the case, and of the power, did imperiously require, that such\r\nimportant authority as that of granting monopolies of trade and\r\nnavigation should not be considered as still retained by the States.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the prohibitions on the power of the States, that\r\nthe general concurrent power was not supposed to be left with them. And\r\nthe exception out of these prohibitions of the inspection laws proves\r\nthis still more clearly. Which most concerns the commerce of this\r\ncountry, that New York and Virginia should have an uncontrolled power to\r\nestablish their inspection of flour and tobacco, or that they should\r\nhave an uncontrolled power of granting either a monopoly of trade in\r\ntheir own ports, or a monopoly of navigation over all the waters leading\r\nto those ports? Yet the argument on the other side must be, that,\r\nalthough the Constitution has sedulously guarded and limited the first\r\nof these powers, it has left the last wholly unlimited and uncontrolled.\r\n\r\nBut although much has been said, in the discussion on former occasions,\r\nabout this supposed concurrent power in the States, I find great\r\ndifficulty in understanding what is meant by it. It is generally\r\nqualified by saying, that it is a power by which the States could pass\r\nlaws on subjects of commercial regulation, which would be valid until\r\nCongress should pass other laws controlling them, or inconsistent with\r\nthem, and that then the State laws must yield. What sort of concurrent\r\npowers are these, which cannot exist together? Indeed, the very reading\r\nof the clause in the Constitution must put to flight this notion of a\r\ngeneral concurrent power. The Constitution was formed for all the\r\nStates; and Congress was to have power to regulate commerce. Now, what\r\nis the import of this, but that Congress is to give the rule, to\r\nestablish the system, to exercise the control over the subject? And can\r\nmore than one power, in cases of this sort, give the rule, establish the\r\nsystem, or exercise the control? As it is not contended that the power\r\nof Congress is to be exercised by a supervision of State legislation,\r\nand as it is clear that Congress is to give the general rule, I contend\r\nthat this power of giving the general rule is transferred, by the\r\nConstitution, from the States to Congress, to be exercised as that body\r\nmay see fit; and consequently, that all those high exercises of power,\r\nwhich might be considered as giving the rule, or establishing the\r\nsystem, in regard to great commercial interests, are necessarily left\r\nwith Congress alone. Of this character I consider monopolies of trade or\r\nnavigation; embargoes; the system of navigation laws; the countervailing\r\nlaws, as against foreign states; and other important enactments\r\nrespecting our connection with such states. It appears to me a most\r\nreasonable construction to say, that in these respects the power of\r\nCongress is exclusive, from the nature of the power. If it be not so,\r\nwhere is the limit, or who shall fix a boundary for the exercise of the\r\npower of the States? Can a State grant a monopoly of trade? Can New York\r\nshut her ports to all but her own citizens? Can she refuse admission to\r\nships of particular nations? The argument on the other side is, and must\r\nbe, that she might do all these things, until Congress should revoke her\r\nenactments. And this is called _concurrent_ legislation! What confusion\r\nsuch notions lead to is obvious enough. A power in the States to do any\r\nthing, and every thing, in regard to commerce, till Congress shall undo\r\nit, would suppose a state of things at least as bad as that which\r\nexisted before the present Constitution. It is the true wisdom of these\r\ngovernments to keep their action as distinct as possible. The general\r\ngovernment should not seek to operate where the States can operate with\r\nmore advantage to the community; nor should the States encroach on\r\nground which the public good, as well as the Constitution, refers to the\r\nexclusive control of Congress.\r\n\r\nIf the present state of things, these laws of New York, the laws of\r\nConnecticut, and the laws of New Jersey, had been all presented, in the\r\nconvention of New York, to the eminent person whose name is on this\r\nrecord, and who acted on that occasion so important a part; if he had\r\nbeen told, that, after all he had said in favor of the new government,\r\nand of its salutary effects on commercial regulations, the time would\r\nyet come when the North River would be shut up by a monopoly from New\r\nYork, the Sound interdicted by a penal law of Connecticut, reprisals\r\nauthorized by New Jersey against citizens of New York, and when one\r\ncould not cross a ferry without transshipment, does any one suppose he\r\nwould have admitted all this as compatible with the government which he\r\nwas recommending?\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of a general concurrent power in the States is insidious\r\nand dangerous. If it be admitted, no one can say where it will stop. The\r\nStates may legislate, it is said, wherever Congress has not made a\r\nplenary exercise of its power. But who is to judge whether Congress has\r\nmade this plenary exercise of power? Congress has acted on this power;\r\nit has done all that it deemed wise; and are the States now to do\r\nwhatever Congress has left undone? Congress makes such rules as, in its\r\njudgment, the case requires; and those rules, whatever they are,\r\nconstitute the system.\r\n\r\nAll useful regulation does not consist in restraint; and that which\r\nCongress sees fit to leave free is a part of its regulation, as much as\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nThe practice under the Constitution sufficiently evinces, that this\r\nportion of the commercial power is exclusive in Congress. When, before\r\nthis instance, have the States granted monopolies? When, until now, have\r\nthey interfered with the navigation of the country? The pilot laws, the\r\nhealth laws, or quarantine laws, and various regulations of that class,\r\nwhich have been recognized by Congress, are no arguments to prove, even\r\nif they are to be called commercial regulations (which they are not),\r\nthat other regulations, more directly and strictly commercial, are not\r\nsolely within the power of Congress. There is a singular fallacy, as I\r\nventure to think, in the argument of very learned and most respectable\r\npersons on this subject. That argument alleges, that the States have a\r\nconcurrent power with Congress of regulating commerce; and the proof of\r\nthis position is, that the States have, without any question of their\r\nright, passed acts respecting turnpike roads, toll-bridges, and ferries.\r\nThese are declared to be acts of commercial regulation, affecting not\r\nonly the interior commerce of the State itself, but also commerce\r\nbetween different States. Therefore, as all these are commercial\r\nregulations, and are yet acknowledged to be rightfully established by\r\nthe States, it follows, as is supposed, that the States must have a\r\nconcurrent power to regulate commerce.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the inevitable consequence of this mode of reasoning? Does\r\nit not admit the power of Congress, at once, upon all these minor\r\nobjects of legislation? If all these be regulations of commerce, within\r\nthe meaning of the Constitution, then certainly Congress, having a\r\nconcurrent power to regulate commerce, may establish ferries,\r\nturnpike-roads, and bridges, and provide for all this detail of interior\r\nlegislation. To sustain the interference of the State in a high concern\r\nof maritime commerce, the argument adopts a principle which acknowledges\r\nthe right of Congress over a vast scope of internal legislation, which\r\nno one has heretofore supposed to be within its powers. But this is not\r\nall; for it is admitted that, when Congress and the States have power to\r\nlegislate over the same subject, the power of Congress, when exercised,\r\ncontrols or extinguishes the State power; and therefore the consequence\r\nwould seem to follow, from the argument, that all State legislation over\r\nsuch subjects as have been mentioned is, at all times, liable to the\r\nsuperior power of Congress; a consequence which no one would admit for a\r\nmoment. The truth is, in my judgment, that all these things are, in\r\ntheir general character, rather regulations of police than of commerce,\r\nin the constitutional understanding of that term. A road, indeed, may be\r\na matter of great commercial concern. In many cases it is so; and when\r\nit is so, there is no doubt of the power of Congress to make it. But,\r\ngenerally speaking, roads, and bridges, and ferries, though of course\r\nthey affect commerce and intercourse, do not possess such importance and\r\nelevation as to be deemed commercial regulations. A reasonable\r\nconstruction must be given to the Constitution; and such construction is\r\nas necessary to the just power of the States, as to the authority of\r\nCongress. Quarantine laws, for example, may be considered as affecting\r\ncommerce; yet they are, in their nature, health laws. In England, we\r\nspeak of the power of regulating commerce as in Parliament, or the king,\r\nas arbiter of commerce; yet the city of London enacts health laws. Would\r\nany one infer from that circumstance, that the city of London had\r\nconcurrent power with Parliament or the crown to regulate commerce? or\r\nthat it might grant a monopoly of the navigation of the Thames? While a\r\nhealth law is reasonable, it is a health law; but if, under color of it,\r\nenactments should be made for other purposes, such enactments might be\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion in the New York courts, no small reliance was placed\r\non the law of that State prohibiting the importation of slaves, as an\r\nexample of a commercial regulation enacted by State authority. That law\r\nmay or may not be constitutional and valid. It has been referred to\r\ngenerally, but its particular provisions have not been stated. When they\r\nare more clearly seen, its character may be better determined.\r\n\r\nIt might further be argued, that the power of Congress over these high\r\nbranches of commerce is exclusive, from the consideration that Congress\r\npossesses an exclusive admiralty jurisdiction. That it does possess such\r\nexclusive jurisdiction will hardly be contested. No State pretends to\r\nexercise any jurisdiction of that kind. The States abolished their\r\ncourts of admiralty, when the Constitution went into operation. Over\r\nthese waters, therefore, or at least some of them, which are the subject\r\nof this monopoly, New York has no jurisdiction whatever. They are a part\r\nof the high seas, and not within the body of any county. The authorities\r\nof that State could not punish for a murder, committed on board one of\r\nthese boats, in some places within the range of this exclusive grant.\r\nThis restraining of the States from all jurisdiction out of the body of\r\ntheir own counties, shows plainly enough that navigation on the high\r\nseas was understood to be a matter to be regulated only by Congress. It\r\nis not unreasonable to say, that what are called the waters of New York\r\nare, for purposes of navigation and commercial regulation, the waters of\r\nthe United States. There is no cession, indeed, of the waters\r\nthemselves, but their use for those purposes seems to be intrusted to\r\nthe exclusive power of Congress. Several States have enacted laws which\r\nwould appear to imply their conviction of the power of Congress over\r\nnavigable waters to a greater extent.\r\n\r\nIf there be a concurrent power of regulating commerce on the high seas,\r\nthere must be a concurrent admiralty jurisdiction, and a concurrent\r\ncontrol of the waters. It is a common principle, that arms of the sea,\r\nincluding navigable rivers, belong to the sovereign, so far as\r\nnavigation is concerned. Their use is navigation. The United States\r\npossess the general power over navigation, and, of course, ought to\r\ncontrol, in general, the use of navigable waters. If it be admitted\r\nthat, for purposes of trade and navigation, the North River and its bay\r\nare the river and bay of New York and the Chesapeake the bay of\r\nVirginia, very great inconveniences and much confusion might be the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIt may now be well to take a nearer view of these laws, to see more\r\nexactly what their provisions are, what consequences have followed from\r\nthem, and what would and might follow from other similar laws.\r\n\r\nThe first grant to John Fitch gave him the sole and exclusive right of\r\nmaking, employing, and navigating all boats impelled by fire or steam,\r\n\"in all creeks, rivers, bays, and waters within the territory and\r\njurisdiction of the State.\" Any other person navigating such boat, was\r\nto forfeit it, and to pay a penalty of a hundred pounds. The subsequent\r\nacts repeal this, and grant similar privileges to Livingston and Fulton;\r\nand the act of 1811 provides the extraordinary and summary remedy which\r\nhas been already stated. The river, the bay, and the marine league along\r\nthe shore, are all within the scope of this grant. Any vessel,\r\ntherefore, of this description, coming into any of those waters, without\r\na license, whether from another State or from abroad, whether it be a\r\npublic or private vessel, is instantly forfeited to the grantees of the\r\nmonopoly.\r\n\r\nNow it must be remembered that this grant is made as an exercise of\r\nsovereign political power. It is not an inspection law, nor a health\r\nlaw, nor passed by any derivative authority; it is professedly an act of\r\nsovereign power. Of course, there is no limit to the power, to be\r\nderived from the purpose for which it is exercised. If exercised for one\r\npurpose, it may be also for another. No one can inquire into the motives\r\nwhich influence sovereign authority. It is enough that such power\r\nmanifests its will. The motive alleged in this case is, to remunerate\r\nthe grantees for a benefit conferred by them on the public. But there is\r\nno necessary connection between that benefit and this mode of rewarding\r\nit; and if the State could grant this monopoly for that purpose, it\r\ncould also grant it for any other purpose. It could make the grant for\r\nmoney; and so make the monopoly of navigation over those waters a direct\r\nsource of revenue. When this monopoly shall expire, in 1838, the State\r\nmay continue it, for any pecuniary consideration which the holders may\r\nsee fit to offer, and the State to receive.\r\n\r\nIf the State may grant this monopoly, it may also grant another, for\r\nother descriptions of vessels; for instance, for all sloops.\r\n\r\nIf it can grant these exclusive privileges to a few, it may grant them\r\nto many; that is, it may grant them to all its own citizens, to the\r\nexclusion of everybody else.\r\n\r\nBut the waters of New York are no more the subject of exclusive grants\r\nby that State, than the waters of other States are subjects of such\r\ngrants by those other States. Virginia may well exercise, over the\r\nentrance of the Chesapeake, all the power that New York can exercise\r\nover the bay of New York, and the waters on her shores. The Chesapeake,\r\ntherefore, upon the principle of these laws, may be the subject of State\r\nmonopoly; and so may the bay of Massachusetts. But this is not all. It\r\nrequires no greater power to grant a monopoly of trade, than a monopoly\r\nof navigation. Of course, New York, if these acts can be maintained, may\r\ngive an exclusive right of entry of vessels into her ports; and the\r\nother States may do the same. These are not extreme cases. We have only\r\nto suppose that other States should do what New York has already done,\r\nand that the power should be carried to its full extent.\r\n\r\nTo all this, no answer is to be given but one, that the concurrent power\r\nof the States, concurrent though it be, is yet subordinate to the\r\nlegislation of Congress; and that therefore Congress may, whenever it\r\npleases, annul the State legislation; but until it does so annul it, the\r\nState legislation is valid and effectual. What is there to recommend a\r\nconstruction which leads to a result like this? Here would be a\r\nperpetual hostility; one legislature enacting laws, till another\r\nlegislature should repeal them; one sovereign power giving the rule,\r\ntill another sovereign power should abrogate it; and all this under the\r\nidea of concurrent legislation!\r\n\r\nBut, further, under this concurrent power, the State does that which\r\nCongress cannot do; that is, it gives preferences to the citizens of\r\nsome States over those of others. I do not mean here the advantages\r\nconferred by the grant on the grantees; but the disadvantages to which\r\nit subjects all the other citizens of New York. To impose an\r\nextraordinary tax on steam navigation visiting the ports of New York,\r\nand leaving it free everywhere else, is giving a preference to the\r\ncitizens of other States over those of New York. This Congress could not\r\ndo; and yet the State does it; so that this power, at first subordinate,\r\nthen concurrent, now becomes paramount.\r\n\r\nThe people of New York have a right to be protected against this\r\nmonopoly. It is one of the objects for which they agreed to this\r\nConstitution, that they should stand on an equality in commercial\r\nregulations; and if the government should not insure them that, the\r\npromises made to them in its behalf would not be performed.\r\n\r\nI contend, therefore, in conclusion on this point, that the power of\r\nCongress over these high branches of commercial regulation is shown to\r\nbe exclusive, by considering what was wished and intended to be done,\r\nwhen the convention for forming the Constitution was called; by what was\r\nunderstood, in the State conventions, to have been accomplished by the\r\ninstrument; by the prohibitions on the States, and the express exception\r\nrelative to inspection laws; by the nature of the power itself; by the\r\nterms used, as connected with the nature of the power; by the subsequent\r\nunderstanding and practice, both of Congress and the States; by the\r\ngrant of exclusive admiralty jurisdiction to the federal government; by\r\nthe manifest danger of the opposite doctrine, and the ruinous\r\nconsequences to which it directly leads.\r\n\r\nLittle is now required to be said, to prove that this exclusive grant is\r\na law regulating commerce; although, in some of the discussions\r\nelsewhere, it has been called a law of police. If it be not a regulation\r\nof commerce, then it follows, against the constant admission on the\r\nother side, that Congress, even by an express act, cannot annul or\r\ncontrol it. For if it be not a regulation of commerce, Congress has no\r\nconcern with it. But the granting of monopolies of this kind is always\r\nreferred to the power over commerce. It was as arbiter of commerce that\r\nthe king formerly granted such monopolies.[4] This is a law regulating\r\ncommerce, inasmuch as it imposes new conditions and terms on the\r\ncoasting trade, on foreign trade generally, and on foreign trade as\r\nregulated by treaties; and inasmuch as it interferes with the free\r\nnavigation of navigable waters.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the power of commercial regulation possessed by Congress be,\r\nin regard to the great branches of it, exclusive; and if this grant of\r\nNew York be a commercial regulation, affecting commerce in respect to\r\nthese great branches, then the grant is void, whether any case of actual\r\ncollision has happened or not.\r\n\r\nBut I contend, in the second place, that whether the grant were to be\r\nregarded as wholly void or not, it must, at least, be inoperative, when\r\nthe rights claimed under it come in collision with other rights, enjoyed\r\nand secured under the laws of the United States; and such collision, I\r\nmaintain, clearly exists in this case. It will not be denied that the\r\nlaw of Congress is paramount. The Constitution has expressly provided\r\nfor that. So that the only question in this part of the case is, whether\r\nthe two rights be inconsistent with each other. The appellant has a\r\nright to go from New Jersey to New York, in a vessel owned by himself,\r\nof the proper legal description, and enrolled and licensed according to\r\nlaw. This right belongs to him as a citizen of the United States. It is\r\nderived under the laws of the United States, and no act of the\r\nlegislature of New York can deprive him of it, any more than such act\r\ncould deprive him of the right of holding lands in that State, or of\r\nsuing in its courts. It appears from the record, that the boat in\r\nquestion was regularly enrolled at Perth Amboy, and properly licensed\r\nfor carrying on the coasting trade. Under this enrolment, and with this\r\nlicense, she was proceeding to New York, when she was stopped by the\r\ninjunction of the Chancellor, on the application of the New York\r\ngrantees. There can be no doubt that here is a collision, in fact; that\r\nwhich the appellant claimed as a right, the respondent resisted; and\r\nthere remains nothing now but to determine whether the appellant had, as\r\nhe contends, a right to navigate these waters; because, if he had such\r\nright, it must prevail.\r\n\r\nNow, this right is expressly conferred by the laws of the United States.\r\nThe first section of the act of February, 1793, ch. 8, regulating the\r\ncoasting trade and fisheries, declares, that all ships and vessels,\r\nenrolled and licensed as that act provides, \"and no others, shall be\r\ndeemed ships or vessels of the United States, entitled to the privileges\r\nof ships or vessels employed in the coasting trade or fisheries.\" The\r\nfourth section of the same act declares, \"that, in order to the\r\nlicensing of any ship or vessel, for carrying on the coasting trade or\r\nfisheries,\" bond shall be given, according to the provisions of the act.\r\nAnd the same section declares, that, the owner having complied with the\r\nrequisites of the law, \"it shall be the duty of the collector to grant a\r\nlicense for carrying on the coasting trade\"; and the act proceeds to\r\ngive the form and words of the license, which is, therefore, of course,\r\nto be received as a part of the act; and the words of the license, after\r\nthe necessary recitals, are, \"License is hereby granted for the said\r\nvessel to be employed in carrying on the coasting trade.\" Words could\r\nnot make this authority more express.\r\n\r\nThe court below seems to me, with great deference, to have mistaken the\r\nobject and nature of the license. It seems to have been of opinion, that\r\nthe license has no other intent or effect than to ascertain the\r\nownership and character of the vessel. But this is the peculiar office\r\nand object of the enrolment. That document ascertains that the regular\r\nproof of ownership and character has been given; and the license is\r\ngiven to confer the right to which the party has shown himself entitled.\r\nIt is the authority which the master carries with him, to prove his\r\nright to navigate freely the waters of the United States, and to carry\r\non the coasting trade.\r\n\r\nIn some of the discussions which have been had on this question, it has\r\nbeen said, that Congress has only provided for ascertaining the\r\nownership and property of vessels, but has not prescribed to what use\r\nthey may be applied. But this is an obvious error. The whole object of\r\nthe act regulating the coasting trade is to declare what vessels shall\r\nenjoy the benefit of being employed in that trade. To secure this use to\r\ncertain vessels, and to deny it to others, is precisely the purpose for\r\nwhich the act was passed. The error, or what I humbly suppose to be the\r\nerror, in the judgment of the court below, consists in that court's\r\nhaving thought, that, although Congress might act, it had not yet acted,\r\nin such a way as to confer a right on the appellant; whereas, if a right\r\nwas not given by this law, it never could be given. No law can be more\r\nexpress. It has been admitted, that, supposing there is a provision in\r\nthe act of Congress, that all vessels duly licensed shall be at liberty\r\nto navigate, for the purpose of trade and commerce, all the navigable\r\nharbors, bays, rivers, and lakes within the several States, any law of\r\nthe States creating particular privileges as to any particular class of\r\nvessels to the contrary notwithstanding, the only question that could\r\narise, in such a case, would be, whether the law was constitutional; and\r\nthat, if that was to be granted or decided, it would certainly, in all\r\ncourts and places, overrule and set aside the State grant.\r\n\r\nNow, I do not see that such supposed case could be distinguished from\r\nthe present. We show a provision in an act of Congress, that all\r\nvessels, duly licensed, may carry on the coasting trade; nobody doubts\r\nthe constitutional validity of that law; and we show that this vessel\r\nwas duly licensed according to its provisions. This is all that is\r\nessential in the case supposed. The presence or absence of a _non\r\nobstante_ clause cannot affect the extent or operation of the act of\r\nCongress. Congress has no power of revoking State laws, as a distinct\r\npower. It legislates over subjects; and over those subjects which are\r\nwithin its power, its legislation is supreme, and necessarily overrules\r\nall inconsistent or repugnant State legislation. If Congress were to\r\npass an act expressly revoking or annulling, in whole or in part, this\r\nNew York grant, such an act would be wholly useless and inoperative. If\r\nthe New York grant be opposed to, or inconsistent with, any\r\nconstitutional power which Congress has exercised, then, so far as the\r\nincompatibility exists, the grant is nugatory and void, necessarily, and\r\nby reason of the supremacy of the law of Congress. But if the grant be\r\nnot inconsistent with any exercise of the powers of Congress, then,\r\ncertainly, Congress has no authority to revoke or annul it. Such an act\r\nof Congress, therefore, would be either unconstitutional or\r\nsupererogatory. The laws of Congress need no _non obstante_ clause. The\r\nConstitution makes them supreme, when State laws come into opposition to\r\nthem. So that in these cases there is no question except this; whether\r\nthere be, or be not, a repugnancy or hostility between the law of\r\nCongress and the law of the State. Nor is it at all material, in this\r\nview, whether the law of the State be a law regulating commerce, or a\r\nlaw of police, nor by what other name or character it may be designated.\r\nIf its provisions be inconsistent with an act of Congress, they are\r\nvoid, so far as that inconsistency extends. The whole argument,\r\ntherefore, is substantially and effectually given up, when it is\r\nadmitted that Congress might, by express terms, abrogate the State\r\ngrant, or declare that it should not stand in the way of its own\r\nlegislation; because such express terms would add nothing to the effect\r\nand operation of an act of Congress.\r\n\r\nI contend, therefore, upon the whole of this point, that a case of\r\nactual collision has been made out between the State grant and the act\r\nof Congress; and as the act of Congress is entirely unexceptionable, and\r\nclearly in pursuance of its constitutional powers, the State grant must\r\nyield.\r\n\r\nThere are other provisions of the Constitution of the United States,\r\nwhich have more or less bearing on this question. \"No State shall,\r\nwithout the consent of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage.\" Under color\r\nof grants like this, that prohibition might be wholly evaded. This grant\r\nauthorizes Messrs. Livingston and Fulton to license navigation in the\r\nwaters of New York. They, of course, license it on their own terms. They\r\nmay require a pecuniary consideration, ascertained by the tonnage of the\r\nvessel, or in any other manner. Probably, in fact, they govern\r\nthemselves, in this respect, by the size or tonnage of the vessels to\r\nwhich they grant licenses. Now, what is this but substantially a tonnage\r\nduty, under the law of the State? Or does it make any difference,\r\nwhether the receipts go directly into her own treasury, or into the\r\nhands of those to whom she has made the grant?\r\n\r\nThere is, lastly, that provision of the Constitution which gives\r\nCongress power to promote the progress of science and the useful arts,\r\nby securing to authors and inventors, for a limited time, an exclusive\r\nright to their own writings and discoveries. Congress has exercised this\r\npower, and made all the provisions which it deemed useful or necessary.\r\nThe States may, indeed, like munificent individuals, exercise their own\r\nbounty towards authors and inventors, at their own discretion. But to\r\nconfer reward by exclusive grants, even if it were but a part of the use\r\nof the writing or invention, is not supposed to be a power properly to\r\nbe exercised by the States. Much less can they, under the notion of\r\nconferring rewards in such cases, grant monopolies, the enjoyment of\r\nwhich is essentially incompatible with the exercise of rights possessed\r\nunder the laws of the United States. I shall insist, however, the less\r\non these points, as they are open to counsel who will come after me on\r\nthe same side, and as I have said so much upon what appears to me the\r\nmore important and interesting part of the argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 1 Laws U.S., p. 28, Bioren and Duane's ed.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 1 Laws U.S., p. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Chancellor Livingston.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: 1 Black.

The Massachusetts Lodge of\r\nMasons, over which he presided, applied to the provisional government of\r\nMassachusetts, for permission to take up his remains and to bury them\r\nwith the usual solemnities. The Council granted this request, on\r\ncondition that it should be carried into effect in such a manner that\r\nthe government of _the Colony_ might have an opportunity to erect a\r\nmonument to his memory. A funeral procession was had, and a Eulogy on\r\nGeneral Warren was delivered by Perez Morton, but no measures were taken\r\ntoward building a monument.\r\n\r\nA resolution was adopted by the Congress of the United States on the 8th\r\nof April, 1777, directing that monuments should be erected to the memory\r\nof General Warren, in Boston, and of General Mercer, at Fredericksburg;\r\nbut this resolution has remained to the present time unexecuted.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of November, 1794, a committee was appointed by King\r\nSolomon's Lodge, at Charlestown,[1] to take measures for the erection of\r\na monument to the memory of General Joseph Warren at the expense of the\r\nLodge. This resolution was promptly carried into effect. The land for\r\nthis purpose was presented to the Lodge by the Hon. James Russell, of\r\nCharlestown, and it was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies on the 2d\r\nof December, 1794. It was a wooden pillar of the Tuscan order, eighteen\r\nfeet in height, raised on a pedestal eight feet square, and of an\r\nelevation of ten feet from the ground. The pillar was surmounted by a\r\ngilt urn. An appropriate inscription was placed on the south side of the\r\npedestal.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1818, a committee of the legislature of Massachusetts was\r\nappointed to consider the expediency of building a monument of American\r\nmarble of the memory of General Warren, but this proposal was not\r\ncarried into effect.\r\n\r\nAs the half-century from the date of the battle drew toward a close, a\r\nstronger feeling of the duty of commemorating it began to be awakened in\r\nthe community. Among those who from the first manifested the greatest\r\ninterest in the subject, was the late William Tudor, Esq. He expressed\r\nthe wish, in a letter still preserved, to see upon the battle-ground\r\n\"the noblest monument in the world,\" and he was so ardent and\r\npersevering in urging the project, that it has been stated that he first\r\nconceived the idea of it. The steps taken in execution of the project,\r\nfrom the earliest private conferences among the gentlemen first engaged\r\nin it to its final completion, are accurately sketched by Mr. Richard\r\nFrothingham, Jr., in his valuable History of the Siege of Boston. All\r\nthe material facts contained in this note are derived from his chapter\r\non the Bunker Hill Monument. After giving an account of the organization\r\nof the society, the measures adopted for the collection of funds, and\r\nthe deliberations on the form of the monument, Mr. Frothingham proceeds\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"It was at this stage of the enterprise that the directors proposed\r\n     to lay the corner-stone of the monument, and ground was broken\r\n     (June 7th) for this purpose. As a mark of respect to the liberality\r\n     and patriotism of King Solomon's Lodge, they invited the Grand\r\n     Master of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts to perform the ceremony.\r\n     They also invited General Lafayette to accompany the President of\r\n     the Association, Hon. Daniel Webster, and assist in it.\r\n\r\n     \"This celebration was unequalled in magnificence by any thing of\r\n     the kind that had been seen in New England. The morning proved\r\n     propitious. The air was cool, the sky was clear, and timely showers\r\n     the previous day had brightened the vesture of nature into its\r\n     loveliest hue. Delighted thousands flocked into Boston to bear a\r\n     part in the proceedings, or to witness the spectacle. At about ten\r\n     o'clock a procession moved from the State House towards Bunker\r\n     Hill. The military, in their fine uniforms, formed the van. About\r\n     two hundred veterans of the Revolution, of whom forty were\r\n     survivors of the battle, rode in barouches next to the escort.\r\n     These venerable men, the relics of a past generation, with\r\n     emaciated frames, tottering limbs, and trembling voices,\r\n     constituted a touching spectacle. Some wore, as honorable\r\n     decorations, their old fighting equipments, and some bore the scars\r\n     of still more honorable wounds. Glistening eyes constituted their\r\n     answer to the enthusiastic cheers of the grateful multitudes who\r\n     lined their pathway and cheered their progress. To this patriot\r\n     band succeeded the Bunker Hill Monument Association. Then the\r\n     Masonic fraternity, in their splendid regalia, thousands in number.\r\n     Then Lafayette, continually welcomed by tokens of love and\r\n     gratitude, and the invited guests. Then a long array of societies,\r\n     with their various badges and banners. It was a splendid\r\n     procession, and of such length that the front nearly reached\r\n     Charlestown Bridge ere the rear had left Boston Common. It\r\n     proceeded to Breed's Hill, where the Grand Master of the\r\n     Freemasons, the President of the Monument Association, and General\r\n     Lafayette, performed the ceremony of laying the corner-stone, in\r\n     the presence of a vast concourse of people.\"\r\n\r\nThe procession then moved to a spacious amphitheatre on the northern\r\ndeclivity of the hill, when the following address was delivered by Mr.\r\nWebster, in the presence of as great a multitude as was ever perhaps\r\nassembled within the sound of a human voice.]\r\n\r\nThis uncounted multitude before me and around me proves the feeling\r\nwhich the occasion has excited. These thousands of human faces, glowing\r\nwith sympathy and joy, and from the impulses of a common gratitude\r\nturned reverently to heaven in this spacious temple of the firmament,\r\nproclaim that the day, the place, and the purpose of our assembling have\r\nmade a deep impression on our hearts.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, there be any thing in local association fit to affect the\r\nmind of man, we need not strive to repress the emotions which agitate us\r\nhere. We are among the sepulchres of our fathers. We are on ground,\r\ndistinguished by their valor, their constancy, and the shedding of their\r\nblood. We are here, not to fix an uncertain date in our annals, nor to\r\ndraw into notice an obscure and unknown spot. If our humble purpose had\r\nnever been conceived, if we ourselves had never been born, the 17th of\r\nJune, 1775, would have been a day on which all subsequent history would\r\nhave poured its light, and the eminence where we stand a point of\r\nattraction to the eyes of successive generations. But we are Americans.\r\nWe live in what may be called the early age of this great continent; and\r\nwe know that our posterity, through all time, are here to enjoy and\r\nsuffer the allotments of humanity. We see before us a probable train of\r\ngreat events; we know that our own fortunes have been happily cast; and\r\nit is natural, therefore, that we should be moved by the contemplation\r\nof occurrences which have guided our destiny before many of us were\r\nborn, and settled the condition in which we should pass that portion of\r\nour existence which God allows to men on earth.\r\n\r\nWe do not read even of the discovery of this continent, without feeling\r\nsomething of a personal interest in the event; without being reminded\r\nhow much it has affected our own fortunes and our own existence. It\r\nwould be still more unnatural for us, therefore, than for others, to\r\ncontemplate with unaffected minds that interesting, I may say that most\r\ntouching and pathetic scene, when the great discoverer of America stood\r\non the deck of his shattered bark, the shades of night falling on the\r\nsea, yet no man sleeping; tossed on the billows of an unknown ocean, yet\r\nthe stronger billows of alternate hope and despair tossing his own\r\ntroubled thoughts; extending forward his harassed frame, straining\r\nwestward his anxious and eager eyes, till Heaven at last granted him a\r\nmoment of rapture and ecstasy, in blessing his vision with the sight of\r\nthe unknown world.\r\n\r\nNearer to our times, more closely connected with our fates, and\r\ntherefore still more interesting to our feelings and affections, is the\r\nsettlement of our own country by colonists from England. We cherish\r\nevery memorial of these worthy ancestors; we celebrate their patience\r\nand fortitude; we admire their daring enterprise; we teach our children\r\nto venerate their piety; and we are justly proud of being descended from\r\nmen who have set the world an example of founding civil institutions on\r\nthe great and united principles of human freedom and human knowledge. To\r\nus, their children, the story of their labors and sufferings can never\r\nbe without its interest. We shall not stand unmoved on the shore of\r\nPlymouth, while the sea continues to wash it; nor will our brethren in\r\nanother early and ancient Colony forget the place of its first\r\nestablishment, till their river shall cease to flow by it.[2] No vigor\r\nof youth, no maturity of manhood, will lead the nation to forget the\r\nspots where its infancy was cradled and defended.\r\n\r\nBut the great event in the history of the continent, which we are now\r\nmet here to commemorate, that prodigy of modern times, at once the\r\nwonder and the blessing of the world, is the American Revolution. In a\r\nday of extraordinary prosperity and happiness, of high national honor,\r\ndistinction, and power, we are brought together, in this place, by our\r\nlove of country, by our admiration of exalted character, by our\r\ngratitude for signal services and patriotic devotion.\r\n\r\nThe Society whose organ I am[3] was formed for the purpose of rearing\r\nsome honorable and durable monument to the memory of the early friends\r\nof American Independence. They have thought, that for this object no\r\ntime could be more propitious than the present prosperous and peaceful\r\nperiod; that no place could claim preference over this memorable spot;\r\nand that no day could be more auspicious to the undertaking, than the\r\nanniversary of the battle which was here fought. The foundation of that\r\nmonument we have now laid. With solemnities suited to the occasion, with\r\nprayers to Almighty God for his blessing, and in the midst of this cloud\r\nof witnesses, we have begun the work. We trust it will be prosecuted,\r\nand that, springing from a broad foundation, rising high in massive\r\nsolidity and unadorned grandeur, it may remain as long as Heaven permits\r\nthe works of man to last, a fit emblem, both of the events in memory of\r\nwhich it is raised, and of the gratitude of those who have reared it.\r\n\r\nWe know, indeed, that the record of illustrious actions is most safely\r\ndeposited in the universal remembrance of mankind. We know, that if we\r\ncould cause this structure to ascend, not only till it reached the\r\nskies, but till it pierced them, its broad surfaces could still contain\r\nbut part of that which, in an age of knowledge, hath already been spread\r\nover the earth, and which history charges itself with making known to\r\nall future times. We know that no inscription on entablatures less broad\r\nthan the earth itself can carry information of the events we commemorate\r\nwhere it has not already gone; and that no structure, which shall not\r\noutlive the duration of letters and knowledge among men, can prolong the\r\nmemorial. But our object is, by this edifice, to show our own deep sense\r\nof the value and importance of the achievements of our ancestors; and,\r\nby presenting this work of gratitude to the eye, to keep alive similar\r\nsentiments, and to foster a constant regard for the principles of the\r\nRevolution. Human beings are composed, not of reason only, but of\r\nimagination also, and sentiment; and that is neither wasted nor\r\nmisapplied which is appropriated to the purpose of giving right\r\ndirection to sentiments, and opening proper springs of feeling in the\r\nheart. Let it not be supposed that our object is to perpetuate national\r\nhostility, or even to cherish a mere military spirit. It is higher,\r\npurer, nobler. We consecrate our work to the spirit of national\r\nindependence, and we wish that the light of peace may rest upon it for\r\never. We rear a memorial of our conviction of that unmeasured benefit\r\nwhich has been conferred on our own land, and of the happy influences\r\nwhich have been produced, by the same events, on the general interests\r\nof mankind. We come, as Americans, to mark a spot which must for ever be\r\ndear to us and our posterity. We wish that whosoever, in all coming\r\ntime, shall turn his eye hither, may behold that the place is not\r\nundistinguished where the first great battle of the Revolution was\r\nfought. We wish that this structure may proclaim the magnitude and\r\nimportance of that event to every class and every age. We wish that\r\ninfancy may learn the purpose of its erection from maternal lips, and\r\nthat weary and withered age may behold it, and be solaced by the\r\nrecollections which it suggests. We wish that labor may look up here,\r\nand be proud, in the midst of its toil. We wish that, in those days of\r\ndisaster, which, as they come upon all nations, must be expected to come\r\nupon us also, desponding patriotism may turn its eyes hitherward, and be\r\nassured that the foundations of our national power are still strong. We\r\nwish that this column, rising towards heaven among the pointed spires of\r\nso many temples dedicated to God, may contribute also to produce, in all\r\nminds, a pious feeling of dependence and gratitude. We wish, finally,\r\nthat the last object to the sight of him who leaves his native shore,\r\nand the first to gladden his who revisits it, may be something which\r\nshall remind him of the liberty and the glory of his country. Let it\r\nrise! let it rise, till it meet the sun in his coming; let the earliest\r\nlight of the morning gild it, and parting day linger and play on its\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\nWe live in a most extraordinary age. Events so various and so important\r\nthat they might crowd and distinguish centuries are, in our times,\r\ncompressed within the compass of a single life. When has it happened\r\nthat history has had so much to record, in the same term of years, as\r\nsince the 17th of June, 1775? Our own Revolution, which, under other\r\ncircumstances, might itself have been expected to occasion a war of half\r\na century, has been achieved; twenty-four sovereign and independent\r\nStates erected; and a general government established over them, so safe,\r\nso wise, so free, so practical, that we might well wonder its\r\nestablishment should have been accomplished so soon, were it not for the\r\ngreater wonder that it should have been established at all. Two or three\r\nmillions of people have been augmented to twelve, the great forests of\r\nthe West prostrated beneath the arm of successful industry, and the\r\ndwellers on the banks of the Ohio and the Mississippi become the\r\nfellow-citizens and neighbors of those who cultivate the hills of New\r\nEngland.[4] We have a commerce, that leaves no sea unexplored; navies,\r\nwhich take no law from superior force; revenues, adequate to all the\r\nexigencies of government, almost without taxation; and peace with all\r\nnations, founded on equal rights and mutual respect.\r\n\r\nEurope, within the same period, has been agitated by a mighty\r\nrevolution, which, while it has been felt in the individual condition\r\nand happiness of almost every man, has shaken to the centre her\r\npolitical fabric, and dashed against one another thrones which had stood\r\ntranquil for ages. On this, our continent, our own example has been\r\nfollowed, and colonies have sprung up to be nations.[5] Unaccustomed\r\nsounds of liberty and free government have reached us from beyond the\r\ntrack of the sun; and at this moment the dominion of European power in\r\nthis continent, from the place where we stand to the south pole, is\r\nannihilated for ever.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, both in Europe and America, such has been the general\r\nprogress of knowledge, such the improvement in legislation, in commerce,\r\nin the arts, in letters, and, above all, in liberal ideas and the\r\ngeneral spirit of the age, that the whole world seems changed.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding that this is but a faint abstract of the things\r\nwhich have happened since the day of the battle of Bunker Hill, we are\r\nbut fifty years removed from it; and we now stand here to enjoy all the\r\nblessings of our own condition, and to look abroad on the brightened\r\nprospects of the world, while we still have among us some of those who\r\nwere active agents in the scenes of 1775, and who are now here, from\r\nevery quarter of New England, to visit once more, and under\r\ncircumstances so affecting, I had almost said so overwhelming, this\r\nrenowned theatre of their courage and patriotism.\r\n\r\nVENERABLE MEN! you have come down to us from a former generation. Heaven\r\nhas bounteously lengthened out your lives, that you might behold this\r\njoyous day. You are now where you stood fifty years ago, this very hour,\r\nwith your brothers and your neighbors, shoulder to shoulder, in the\r\nstrife for your country. Behold, how altered! The same heavens are\r\nindeed over your heads; the same ocean rolls at your feet; but all else\r\nhow changed! You hear now no roar of hostile cannon, you see no mixed\r\nvolumes of smoke and flame rising from burning Charlestown. The ground\r\nstrewed with the dead and the dying; the impetuous charge; the steady\r\nand successful repulse; the loud call to repeated assault; the summoning\r\nof all that is manly to repeated resistance; a thousand bosoms freely\r\nand fearlessly bared in an instant to whatever of terror there may be in\r\nwar and death;--all these you have witnessed, but you witness them no\r\nmore. All is peace. The heights of yonder metropolis, its towers and\r\nroofs, which you then saw filled with wives and children and countrymen\r\nin distress and terror, and looking with unutterable emotions for the\r\nissue of the combat, have presented you to-day with the sight of its\r\nwhole happy population, come out to welcome and greet you with a\r\nuniversal jubilee. Yonder proud ships, by a felicity of position\r\nappropriately lying at the foot of this mount, and seeming fondly to\r\ncling around it, are not means of annoyance to you, but your country's\r\nown means of distinction and defence.[6] All is peace; and God has\r\ngranted you this sight of your country's happiness, ere you slumber in\r\nthe grave. He has allowed you to behold and to partake the reward of\r\nyour patriotic toils; and he has allowed us, your sons and countrymen,\r\nto meet you here, and in the name of the present generation, in the name\r\nof your country, in the name of liberty, to thank you!\r\n\r\nBut, alas! you are not all here! Time and the sword have thinned your\r\nranks. Prescott, Putnam, Stark, Brooks, Read, Pomeroy, Bridge! our eyes\r\nseek for you in vain amid this broken band. You are gathered to your\r\nfathers, and live only to your country in her grateful remembrance and\r\nyour own bright example. But let us not too much grieve, that you have\r\nmet the common fate of men. You lived at least long enough to know that\r\nyour work had been nobly and successfully accomplished. You lived to see\r\nyour country's independence established, and to sheathe your swords from\r\nwar. On the light of Liberty you saw arise the light of Peace, like\r\n\r\n                \"another morn,\r\n    Risen on mid-noon\";\r\n\r\nand the sky on which you closed your eyes was cloudless.\r\n\r\nBut ah! Him! the first great martyr in this great cause! Him! the\r\npremature victim of his own self-devoting heart! Him! the head of our\r\ncivil councils, and the destined leader of our military bands, whom\r\nnothing brought hither but the unquenchable fire of his own spirit! Him!\r\ncut off by Providence in the hour of overwhelming anxiety and thick\r\ngloom; falling ere he saw the star of his country rise; pouring out his\r\ngenerous blood like water, before he knew whether it would fertilize a\r\nland of freedom or of bondage!--how shall I struggle with the emotions\r\nthat stifle the utterance of thy name![7] Our poor work may perish; but\r\nthine shall endure! This monument may moulder away; the solid ground it\r\nrests upon may sink down to a level with the sea; but thy memory shall\r\nnot fail! Wheresoever among men a heart shall be found that beats to the\r\ntransports of patriotism and liberty, its aspirations shall be to claim\r\nkindred with thy spirit!\r\n\r\nBut the scene amidst which we stand does not permit us to confine our\r\nthoughts or our sympathies to those fearless spirits who hazarded or\r\nlost their lives on this consecrated spot. We have the happiness to\r\nrejoice here in the presence of a most worthy representation of the\r\nsurvivors of the whole Revolutionary army.\r\n\r\nVETERANS! you are the remnant of many a well-fought field. You bring\r\nwith you marks of honor from Trenton and Monmouth, from Yorktown,\r\nCamden, Bennington, and Saratoga. VETERANS OF HALF A CENTURY! when in\r\nyour youthful days you put every thing at hazard in your country's\r\ncause, good as that cause was, and sanguine as youth is, still your\r\nfondest hopes did not stretch onward to an hour like this! At a period\r\nto which you could not reasonably have expected to arrive, at a moment\r\nof national prosperity such as you could never have foreseen, you are\r\nnow met here to enjoy the fellowship of old soldiers, and to receive the\r\noverflowings of a universal gratitude.\r\n\r\nBut your agitated countenances and your heaving breasts inform me that\r\neven this is not an unmixed joy. I perceive that a tumult of contending\r\nfeelings rushes upon you. The images of the dead, as well as the persons\r\nof the living, present themselves before you. The scene overwhelms you,\r\nand I turn from it. May the Father of all mercies smile upon your\r\ndeclining years, and bless them! And when you shall here have exchanged\r\nyour embraces, when you shall once more have pressed the hands which\r\nhave been so often extended to give succor in adversity, or grasped in\r\nthe exultation of victory, then look abroad upon this lovely land which\r\nyour young valor defended, and mark the happiness with which it is\r\nfilled; yea, look abroad upon the whole earth, and see what a name you\r\nhave contributed to give to your country, and what a praise you have\r\nadded to freedom, and then rejoice in the sympathy and gratitude which\r\nbeam upon your last days from the improved condition of mankind!\r\n\r\nThe occasion does not require of me any particular account of the battle\r\nof the 17th of June, 1775, nor any detailed narrative of the events\r\nwhich immediately preceded it. These are familiarly known to all. In the\r\nprogress of the great and interesting controversy, Massachusetts and the\r\ntown of Boston had become early and marked objects of the displeasure of\r\nthe British Parliament. This had been manifested in the act for altering\r\nthe government of the Province, and in that for shutting up the port of\r\nBoston. Nothing sheds more honor on our early history, and nothing\r\nbetter shows how little the feelings and sentiments of the Colonies were\r\nknown or regarded in England, than the impression which these measures\r\neverywhere produced in America. It had been anticipated, that, while the\r\nColonies in general would be terrified by the severity of the punishment\r\ninflicted on Massachusetts, the other sea-ports would be governed by a\r\nmere spirit of gain; and that, as Boston was now cut off from all\r\ncommerce, the unexpected advantage which this blow on her was calculated\r\nto confer on other towns would be greedily enjoyed. How miserably such\r\nreasoners deceived themselves! How little they knew of the depth, and\r\nthe strength, and the intenseness of that feeling of resistance to\r\nillegal acts of power, which possessed the whole American people!\r\nEverywhere the unworthy boon was rejected with scorn. The fortunate\r\noccasion was seized, everywhere, to show to the whole world that the\r\nColonies were swayed by no local interest, no partial interest, no\r\nselfish interest. The temptation to profit by the punishment of Boston\r\nwas strongest to our neighbors of Salem. Yet Salem was precisely the\r\nplace where this miserable proffer was spurned, in a tone of the most\r\nlofty self-respect and the most indignant patriotism. \"We are deeply\r\naffected,\" said its inhabitants, \"with the sense of our public\r\ncalamities; but the miseries that are now rapidly hastening on our\r\nbrethren in the capital of the Province greatly excite our\r\ncommiseration. By shutting up the port of Boston, some imagine that the\r\ncourse of trade might be turned hither and to our benefit; but we must\r\nbe dead to every idea of justice, lost to all feelings of humanity,\r\ncould we indulge a thought to seize on wealth and raise our fortunes on\r\nthe ruin of our suffering neighbors.\" These noble sentiments were not\r\nconfined to our immediate vicinity. In that day of general affection and\r\nbrotherhood, the blow given to Boston smote on every patriotic heart\r\nfrom one end of the country to the other. Virginia and the Carolinas, as\r\nwell as Connecticut and New Hampshire, felt and proclaimed the cause to\r\nbe their own. The Continental Congress, then holding its first session\r\nin Philadelphia, expressed its sympathy for the suffering inhabitants of\r\nBoston, and addresses were received from all quarters, assuring them\r\nthat the cause was a common one, and should be met by common efforts and\r\ncommon sacrifices. The Congress of Massachusetts responded to these\r\nassurances; and in an address to the Congress at Philadelphia, bearing\r\nthe official signature, perhaps among the last, of the immortal Warren,\r\nnotwithstanding the severity of its suffering and the magnitude of the\r\ndangers which threatened it, it was declared, that this Colony \"is\r\nready, at all times, to spend and to be spent in the cause of America.\"\r\n\r\nBut the hour drew nigh which was to put professions to the proof, and to\r\ndetermine whether the authors of these mutual pledges were ready to seal\r\nthem in blood. The tidings of Lexington and Concord had no sooner\r\nspread, than it was universally felt that the time was at last come for\r\naction. A spirit pervaded all ranks, not transient, not boisterous, but\r\ndeep, solemn, determined,\r\n\r\n               \"totamque infusa per artus\r\n    Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.\"\r\n\r\nWar, on their own soil and at their own doors, was, indeed, a strange\r\nwork to the yeomanry of New England; but their consciences were\r\nconvinced of its necessity, their country called them to it, and they\r\ndid not withhold themselves from the perilous trial. The ordinary\r\noccupations of life were abandoned; the plough was staid in the\r\nunfinished furrow; wives gave up their husbands, and mothers gave up\r\ntheir sons, to the battles of a civil war. Death might come, in honor,\r\non the field; it might come, in disgrace, on the scaffold. For either\r\nand for both they were prepared. The sentiment of Quincy was full in\r\ntheir hearts. \"Blandishments,\" said that distinguished son of genius and\r\npatriotism, \"will not fascinate us, nor will threats of a halter\r\nintimidate; for, under God, we are determined that, wheresoever,\r\nwhensoever, or howsoever we shall be called to make our exit, we will\r\ndie free men.\"\r\n\r\nThe 17th of June saw the four New England Colonies standing here, side\r\nby side, to triumph or to fall together; and there was with them from\r\nthat moment to the end of the war, what I hope will remain with them for\r\never, one cause, one country, one heart.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Bunker Hill was attended with the most important effects\r\nbeyond its immediate results as a military engagement. It created at\r\nonce a state of open, public war. There could now be no longer a\r\nquestion of proceeding against individuals, as guilty of treason or\r\nrebellion. That fearful crisis was past. The appeal lay to the sword,\r\nand the only question was, whether the spirit and the resources of the\r\npeople would hold out, till the object should be accomplished. Nor were\r\nits general consequences confined to our own country. The previous\r\nproceedings of the Colonies, their appeals, resolutions, and addresses,\r\nhad made their cause known to Europe. Without boasting, we may say, that\r\nin no age or country has the public cause been maintained with more\r\nforce of argument, more power of illustration, or more of that\r\npersuasion which excited feeling and elevated principle can alone\r\nbestow, than the Revolutionary state papers exhibit. These papers will\r\nfor ever deserve to be studied, not only for the spirit which they\r\nbreathe, but for the ability with which they were written.\r\n\r\nTo this able vindication of their cause, the Colonies had now added a\r\npractical and severe proof of their own true devotion to it, and given\r\nevidence also of the power which they could bring to its support. All\r\nnow saw, that, if America fell, she would not fall without a struggle.\r\nMen felt sympathy and regard, as well as surprise, when they beheld\r\nthese infant states, remote, unknown, unaided, encounter the power of\r\nEngland, and, in the first considerable battle, leave more of their\r\nenemies dead on the field, in proportion to the number of combatants,\r\nthan had been recently known to fall in the wars of Europe.\r\n\r\nInformation of these events, circulating throughout the world, at length\r\nreached the ears of one who now hears me.[8] He has not forgotten the\r\nemotion which the fame of Bunker Hill, and the name of Warren, excited\r\nin his youthful breast.\r\n\r\nSIR, we are assembled to commemorate the establishment of great public\r\nprinciples of liberty, and to do honor to the distinguished dead. The\r\noccasion is too severe for eulogy of the living. But, Sir, your\r\ninteresting relation to this country, the peculiar circumstances which\r\nsurround you and surround us, call on me to express the happiness which\r\nwe derive from your presence and aid in this solemn commemoration.\r\n\r\nFortunate, fortunate man! with what measure of devotion will you not\r\nthank God for the circumstances of your extraordinary life! You are\r\nconnected with both hemispheres and with two generations. Heaven saw fit\r\nto ordain, that the electric spark of liberty should be conducted,\r\nthrough you, from the New World to the Old; and we, who are now here to\r\nperform this duty of patriotism, have all of us long ago received it in\r\ncharge from our fathers to cherish your name and your virtues. You will\r\naccount it an instance of your good fortune, Sir, that you crossed the\r\nseas to visit us at a time which enables you to be present at this\r\nsolemnity. You now behold the field, the renown of which reached you in\r\nthe heart of France, and caused a thrill in your ardent bosom. You see\r\nthe lines of the little redoubt thrown up by the incredible diligence of\r\nPrescott; defended, to the last extremity, by his lion-hearted valor;\r\nand within which the corner-stone of our monument has now taken its\r\nposition. You see where Warren fell, and where Parker, Gardner,\r\nMcCleary, Moore, and other early patriots, fell with him. Those who\r\nsurvived that day, and whose lives have been prolonged to the present\r\nhour, are now around you. Some of them you have known in the trying\r\nscenes of the war. Behold! they now stretch forth their feeble arms to\r\nembrace you. Behold! they raise their trembling voices to invoke the\r\nblessing of God on you and yours for ever.\r\n\r\nSir, you have assisted us in laying the foundation of this structure.\r\nYou have heard us rehearse, with our feeble commendation, the names of\r\ndeparted patriots. Monuments and eulogy belong to the dead. We give them\r\nthis day to Warren and his associates. On other occasions they have been\r\ngiven to your more immediate companions in arms, to Washington, to\r\nGreene, to Gates, to Sullivan, and to Lincoln. We have become reluctant\r\nto grant these, our highest and last honors, further. We would gladly\r\nhold them yet back from the little remnant of that immortal band. _Serus\r\nin coelum redeas._ Illustrious as are your merits, yet far, O very far\r\ndistant be the day, when any inscription shall bear your name, or any\r\ntongue pronounce its eulogy!\r\n\r\nThe leading reflection to which this occasion seems to invite us,\r\nrespects the great changes which have happened in the fifty years since\r\nthe battle of Bunker Hill was fought. And it peculiarly marks the\r\ncharacter of the present age, that, in looking at these changes, and in\r\nestimating their effect on our condition, we are obliged to consider,\r\nnot what has been done in our own country only, but in others also. In\r\nthese interesting times, while nations are making separate and\r\nindividual advances in improvement, they make, too, a common progress;\r\nlike vessels on a common tide, propelled by the gales at different\r\nrates, according to their several structure and management, but all\r\nmoved forward by one mighty current, strong enough to bear onward\r\nwhatever does not sink beneath it.\r\n\r\nA chief distinction of the present day is a community of opinions and\r\nknowledge amongst men in different nations, existing in a degree\r\nheretofore unknown. Knowledge has, in our time, triumphed, and is\r\ntriumphing, over distance, over difference of languages, over diversity\r\nof habits, over prejudice, and over bigotry. The civilized and Christian\r\nworld is fast learning the great lesson, that difference of nation does\r\nnot imply necessary hostility, and that all contact need not be war. The\r\nwhole world is becoming a common field for intellect to act in. Energy\r\nof mind, genius, power, wheresoever it exists, may speak out in any\r\ntongue, and the _world_ will hear it. A great chord of sentiment and\r\nfeeling runs through two continents, and vibrates over both. Every\r\nbreeze wafts intelligence from country to country; every wave rolls it;\r\nall give it forth, and all in turn receive it. There is a vast commerce\r\nof ideas; there are marts and exchanges for intellectual discoveries,\r\nand a wonderful fellowship of those individual intelligences which make\r\nup the mind and opinion of the age. Mind is the great lever of all\r\nthings; human thought is the process by which human ends are ultimately\r\nanswered; and the diffusion of knowledge, so astonishing in the last\r\nhalf-century, has rendered innumerable minds, variously gifted by\r\nnature, competent to be competitors or fellow-workers on the theatre of\r\nintellectual operation.\r\n\r\nFrom these causes important improvements have taken place in the\r\npersonal condition of individuals. Generally speaking, mankind are not\r\nonly better fed and better clothed, but they are able also to enjoy more\r\nleisure; they possess more refinement and more self-respect. A superior\r\ntone of education, manners, and habits prevails. This remark, most true\r\nin its application to our own country, is also partly true when applied\r\nelsewhere. It is proved by the vastly augmented consumption of those\r\narticles of manufacture and of commerce which contribute to the comforts\r\nand the decencies of life; an augmentation which has far outrun the\r\nprogress of population. And while the unexampled and almost incredible\r\nuse of machinery would seem to supply the place of labor, labor still\r\nfinds its occupation and its reward; so wisely has Providence adjusted\r\nmen's wants and desires to their condition and their capacity.\r\n\r\nAny adequate survey, however, of the progress made during the last\r\nhalf-century in the polite and the mechanic arts, in machinery and\r\nmanufactures, in commerce and agriculture, in letters and in science,\r\nwould require volumes. I must abstain wholly from these subjects, and\r\nturn for a moment to the contemplation of what has been done on the\r\ngreat question of politics and government. This is the master topic of\r\nthe age; and during the whole fifty years it has intensely occupied the\r\nthoughts of men. The nature of civil government, its ends and uses, have\r\nbeen canvassed and investigated; ancient opinions attacked and defended;\r\nnew ideas recommended and resisted, by whatever power the mind of man\r\ncould bring to the controversy. From the closet and the public halls the\r\ndebate has been transferred to the field; and the world has been shaken\r\nby wars of unexampled magnitude, and the greatest variety of fortune. A\r\nday of peace has at length succeeded; and now that the strife has\r\nsubsided, and the smoke cleared away, we may begin to see what has\r\nactually been done, permanently changing the state and condition of\r\nhuman society. And, without dwelling on particular circumstances, it is\r\nmost apparent, that, from the before-mentioned causes of augmented\r\nknowledge and improved individual condition, a real, substantial, and\r\nimportant change has taken place, and is taking place, highly favorable,\r\non the whole, to human liberty and human happiness.\r\n\r\nThe great wheel of political revolution began to move in America. Here\r\nits rotation was guarded, regular, and safe. Transferred to the other\r\ncontinent, from unfortunate but natural causes, it received an irregular\r\nand violent impulse; it whirled along with a fearful celerity; till at\r\nlength, like the chariot-wheels in the races of antiquity, it took fire\r\nfrom the rapidity of its own motion, and blazed onward, spreading\r\nconflagration and terror around.\r\n\r\nWe learn from the result of this experiment, how fortunate was our own\r\ncondition, and how admirably the character of our people was calculated\r\nfor setting the great example of popular governments. The possession of\r\npower did not turn the heads of the American people, for they had long\r\nbeen in the habit of exercising a great degree of self-control. Although\r\nthe paramount authority of the parent state existed over them, yet a\r\nlarge field of legislation had always been open to our Colonial\r\nassemblies. They were accustomed to representative bodies and the forms\r\nof free government; they understood the doctrine of the division of\r\npower among different branches, and the necessity of checks on each. The\r\ncharacter of our countrymen, moreover, was sober, moral, and religious;\r\nand there was little in the change to shock their feelings of justice\r\nand humanity, or even to disturb an honest prejudice. We had no domestic\r\nthrone to overturn, no privileged orders to cast down, no violent\r\nchanges of property to encounter. In the American Revolution, no man\r\nsought or wished for more than to defend and enjoy his own. None hoped\r\nfor plunder or for spoil. Rapacity was unknown to it; the axe was not\r\namong the instruments of its accomplishment; and we all know that it\r\ncould not have lived a single day under any well-founded imputation of\r\npossessing a tendency adverse to the Christian religion.\r\n\r\nIt need not surprise us, that, under circumstances less auspicious,\r\npolitical revolutions elsewhere, even when well intended, have\r\nterminated differently. It is, indeed, a great achievement, it is the\r\nmaster-work of the world, to establish governments entirely popular on\r\nlasting foundations; nor is it easy, indeed, to introduce the popular\r\nprinciple at all into governments to which it has been altogether a\r\nstranger. It cannot be doubted, however, that Europe has come out of the\r\ncontest, in which she has been so long engaged, with greatly superior\r\nknowledge, and, in many respects, in a highly improved condition.\r\nWhatever benefit has been acquired is likely to be retained, for it\r\nconsists mainly in the acquisition of more enlightened ideas. And\r\nalthough kingdoms and provinces may be wrested from the hands that hold\r\nthem, in the same manner they were obtained; although ordinary and\r\nvulgar power may, in human affairs, be lost as it has been won; yet it\r\nis the glorious prerogative of the empire of knowledge, that what it\r\ngains it never loses. On the contrary, it increases by the multiple of\r\nits own power; all its ends become means; all its attainments, helps to\r\nnew conquests. Its whole abundant harvest is but so much seed wheat, and\r\nnothing has limited, and nothing can limit, the amount of ultimate\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this rapidly increasing knowledge, the people\r\nhave begun, in all forms of government, to think and to reason, on\r\naffairs of state. Regarding government as an institution for the public\r\ngood, they demand a knowledge of its operations, and a participation in\r\nits exercise. A call for the representative system, wherever it is not\r\nenjoyed, and where there is already intelligence enough to estimate its\r\nvalue, is perseveringly made. Where men may speak out, they demand it;\r\nwhere the bayonet is at their throats, they pray for it.\r\n\r\nWhen Louis the Fourteenth said, \"I am the state,\" he expressed the\r\nessence of the doctrine of unlimited power. By the rules of that system,\r\nthe people are disconnected from the state; they are its subjects; it is\r\ntheir lord. These ideas, founded in the love of power, and long\r\nsupported by the excess and the abuse of it, are yielding, in our age,\r\nto other opinions; and the civilized world seems at last to be\r\nproceeding to the conviction of that fundamental and manifest truth,\r\nthat the powers of government are but a trust, and that they cannot be\r\nlawfully exercised but for the good of the community. As knowledge is\r\nmore and more extended, this conviction becomes more and more general.\r\nKnowledge, in truth, is the great sun in the firmament. Life and power\r\nare scattered with all its beams. The prayer of the Grecian champion,\r\nwhen enveloped in unnatural clouds and darkness, is the appropriate\r\npolitical supplication for the people of every country not yet blessed\r\nwith free institutions:--\r\n\r\n    \"Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore,\r\n    Give me TO SEE,--and Ajax asks no more.\"\r\n\r\nWe may hope that the growing influence of enlightened sentiment will\r\npromote the permanent peace of the world. Wars to mantain family\r\nalliances, to uphold or to cast down dynasties, and to regulate\r\nsuccessions to thrones, which have occupied so much room in the history\r\nof modern times, if not less likely to happen at all, will be less\r\nlikely to become general and involve many nations, as the great\r\nprinciple shall be more and more established, that the interest of the\r\nworld is peace, and its first great statute, that every nation possesses\r\nthe power of establishing a government for itself. But public opinion\r\nhas attained also an influence over governments which do not admit the\r\npopular principle into their organization. A necessary respect for the\r\njudgment of the world operates, in some measure, as a control over the\r\nmost unlimited forms of authority. It is owing, perhaps, to this truth,\r\nthat the interesting struggle of the Greeks has been suffered to go on\r\nso long, without a direct interference, either to wrest that country\r\nfrom its present masters, or to execute the system of pacification by\r\nforce, and, with united strength, lay the neck of Christian and\r\ncivilized Greek at the foot of the barbarian Turk. Let us thank God that\r\nwe live in an age when something has influence besides the bayonet, and\r\nwhen the sternest authority does not venture to encounter the scorching\r\npower of public reproach. Any attempt of the kind I have mentioned\r\nshould be met by one universal burst of indignation; the air of the\r\ncivilized world ought to be made too warm to be comfortably breathed by\r\nany one who would hazard it.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, a touching reflection, that, while, in the fulness of our\r\ncountry's happiness, we rear this monument to her honor, we look for\r\ninstruction in our undertaking to a country which is now in fearful\r\ncontest, not for works of art or memorials of glory, but for her own\r\nexistence. Let her be assured, that she is not forgotten in the world;\r\nthat her efforts are applauded, and that constant prayers ascend for her\r\nsuccess. And let us cherish a confident hope for her final triumph. If\r\nthe true spark of religious and civil liberty be kindled, it will burn.\r\nHuman agency cannot extinguish it. Like the earth's central fire, it\r\nmay be smothered for a time; the ocean may overwhelm it; mountains may\r\npress it down; but its inherent and unconquerable force will heave both\r\nthe ocean and the land, and at some time or other, in some place or\r\nother, the volcano will break out and flame up to heaven.\r\n\r\nAmong the great events of the half-century, we must reckon, certainly,\r\nthe revolution of South America; and we are not likely to overrate the\r\nimportance of that revolution, either to the people of the country\r\nitself or to the rest of the world. The late Spanish colonies, now\r\nindependent states, under circumstances less favorable, doubtless, than\r\nattended our own revolution, have yet successfully commenced their\r\nnational existence. They have accomplished the great object of\r\nestablishing their independence; they are known and acknowledged in the\r\nworld; and although in regard to their systems of government, their\r\nsentiments on religious toleration, and their provisions for public\r\ninstruction, they may have yet much to learn, it must be admitted that\r\nthey have risen to the condition of settled and established states more\r\nrapidly than could have been reasonably anticipated. They already\r\nfurnish an exhilarating example of the difference between free\r\ngovernments and despotic misrule. Their commerce, at this moment,\r\ncreates a new activity in all the great marts of the world. They show\r\nthemselves able, by an exchange of commodities, to bear a useful part in\r\nthe intercourse of nations.\r\n\r\nA new spirit of enterprise and industry begins to prevail; all the great\r\ninterests of society receive a salutary impulse; and the progress of\r\ninformation not only testifies to an improved condition, but itself\r\nconstitutes the highest and most essential improvement.\r\n\r\nWhen the battle of Bunker Hill was fought, the existence of South\r\nAmerica was scarcely felt in the civilized world. The thirteen little\r\nColonies of North America habitually called themselves the \"Continent.\"\r\nBorne down by colonial subjugation, monopoly, and bigotry, these vast\r\nregions of the South were hardly visible above the horizon. But in our\r\nday there has been, as it were, a new creation. The southern hemisphere\r\nemerges from the sea. Its lofty mountains begin to lift themselves into\r\nthe light of heaven; its broad and fertile plains stretch out, in\r\nbeauty, to the eye of civilized man, and at the mighty bidding of the\r\nvoice of political liberty the waters of darkness retire.\r\n\r\nAnd, now, let us indulge an honest exultation in the conviction of the\r\nbenefit which the example of our country has produced, and is likely to\r\nproduce, on human freedom and human happiness. Let us endeavor to\r\ncomprehend in all its magnitude, and to feel in all its importance, the\r\npart assigned to us in the great drama of human affairs. We are placed\r\nat the head of the system of representative and popular governments.\r\nThus far our example shows that such governments are compatible, not\r\nonly with respectability and power, but with repose, with peace, with\r\nsecurity of personal rights, with good laws, and a just administration.\r\n\r\nWe are not propagandists. Wherever other systems are preferred, either\r\nas being thought better in themselves, or as better suited to existing\r\ncondition, we leave the preference to be enjoyed. Our history hitherto\r\nproves, however, that the popular form is practicable, and that with\r\nwisdom and knowledge men may govern themselves; and the duty incumbent\r\non us is, to preserve the consistency of this cheering example, and take\r\ncare that nothing may weaken its authority with the world. If, in our\r\ncase, the representative system ultimately fail, popular governments\r\nmust be pronounced impossible. No combination of circumstances more\r\nfavorable to the experiment can ever be expected to occur. The last\r\nhopes of mankind, therefore, rest with us; and if it should be\r\nproclaimed, that our example had become an argument against the\r\nexperiment, the knell of popular liberty would be sounded throughout the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nThese are excitements to duty; but they are not suggestions of doubt.\r\nOur history and our condition, all that is gone before us, and all that\r\nsurrounds us, authorize the belief, that popular governments, though\r\nsubject to occasional variations, in form perhaps not always for the\r\nbetter, may yet, in their general character, be as durable and permanent\r\nas other systems. We know, indeed, that in our country any other is\r\nimpossible. The _principle_ of free governments adheres to the American\r\nsoil. It is bedded in it, immovable as its mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd let the sacred obligations which have devolved on this generation,\r\nand on us, sink deep into our hearts. Those who established our liberty\r\nand our government are daily dropping from among us. The great trust now\r\ndescends to new hands. Let us apply ourselves to that which is presented\r\nto us, as our appropriate object. We can win no laurels in a war for\r\nindependence. Earlier and worthier hands have gathered them all. Nor are\r\nthere places for us by the side of Solon, and Alfred, and other founders\r\nof states. Our fathers have filled them. But there remains to us a great\r\nduty of defence and preservation; and there is opened to us, also, a\r\nnoble pursuit, to which the spirit of the times strongly invites us. Our\r\nproper business is improvement. Let our age be the age of improvement.\r\nIn a day of peace, let us advance the arts of peace and the works of\r\npeace. Let us develop the resources of our land, call forth its powers,\r\nbuild up its institutions, promote all its great interests, and see\r\nwhether we also, in our day and generation, may not perform something\r\nworthy to be remembered. Let us cultivate a true spirit of union and\r\nharmony. In pursuing the great objects which our condition points out to\r\nus, let us act under a settled conviction, and an habitual feeling, that\r\nthese twenty-four States are one country. Let our conceptions be\r\nenlarged to the circle of our duties. Let us extend our ideas over the\r\nwhole of the vast field in which we are called to act. Let our object\r\nbe, OUR COUNTRY, OUR WHOLE COUNTRY, AND NOTHING BUT OUR COUNTRY. And, by\r\nthe blessing of God, may that country itself become a vast and splendid\r\nmonument, not of oppression and terror, but of Wisdom, of Peace, and of\r\nLiberty, upon which the world may gaze with admiration for ever!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: General Warren, at the time of his decease, was Grand\r\nMaster of the Masonic Lodges in America.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: An interesting account of the voyage of the early emigrants\r\nto the Maryland Colony, and of its settlement, is given in the official\r\nreport of Father White, written probably within the first month after\r\nthe landing at St. Mary's.

The same valuable work (pp. 345-352) relates the obstacles which\r\npresented themselves to the rapid execution of the design, and the means\r\nby which they were overcome. In this narrative, Mr. Frothingham has done\r\njustice to the efforts and exertions of the successive boards of\r\ndirection and officers of the Association, to the skill and\r\ndisinterestedness of the architect, to the liberality of distinguished\r\nindividuals, to the public spirit of the Massachusetts Charitable\r\nMechanic Association, in promoting a renewed subscription, and to the\r\npatriotic zeal of the ladies of Boston and the vicinity, in holding a\r\nmost successful fair. As it would be difficult farther to condense the\r\ninformation contained in this interesting summary, we must refer the\r\nreader to Mr. Frothingham's work for an adequate account of the causes\r\nwhich delayed the completion of the monument for nearly seventeen years,\r\nand of the resources and exertions by which the desired end was finally\r\nattained. The last stone was raised to its place on the morning of the\r\n23d of July, 1842.\r\n\r\nIt was determined by the directors of the Association, that the\r\ncompletion of the work should be celebrated in a manner not less\r\nimposing than that in which the laying of the corner-stone had been\r\ncelebrated, seventeen years before. The co-operation of Mr. Webster was\r\nagain invited, and, notwithstanding the pressure of his engagements as\r\nSecretary of State at Washington, was again patriotically yielded. Many\r\ncircumstances conspired to increase the interest of the occasion. The\r\ncompletion of the monument had been long delayed, but in the interval\r\nthe subject had been kept much before the public mind. Mr. Webster's\r\naddress on the 17th of June, 1825, had obtained the widest circulation\r\nthroughout the country; passages from it had passed into household words\r\nthroughout the Union. Wherever they were repeated, they made the Bunker\r\nHill Monument a familiar thought with the people. Meantime, Boston and\r\nCharlestown had doubled their population, and the multiplication of rail\r\nroads in every direction enabled a person, in almost any part of New\r\nEngland, to reach the metropolis in a day. The President of the United\r\nStates and his Cabinet had accepted invitations to be present;\r\ndelegations of the descendants of New England were present from the\r\nremotest parts of the Union; one hundred and eight surviving veterans of\r\nthe Revolution, among whom were some who were in the battle of Bunker\r\nHill, imparted a touching interest to the scene.\r\n\r\nEvery thing conspired to promote the success of the ceremonial. The day\r\nwas uncommonly fine; cool for the season, and clear. A large volunteer\r\nforce from various parts of the country had assembled for the occasion,\r\nand formed a brilliant escort to an immense procession, as it moved from\r\nBoston to the battle-ground on the hill. The bank which slopes down from\r\nthe obelisk on the eastern side of Monument Square was covered with\r\nseats, rising in the form of an amphitheatre, under the open sky. These\r\nhad been prepared for ladies, who had assembled in great numbers,\r\nawaiting the arrival of the procession. When it arrived, it was received\r\ninto a large open area in front of these seats. Mr. Webster was\r\nstationed upon an elevated platform, in front of the audience and of the\r\nmonument towering in the background. According to Mr. Frothingham's\r\nestimate, a hundred thousand persons were gathered about the spot, and\r\nnearly half that number are supposed to have been within the reach of\r\nthe orator's voice. The ground rises slightly between the platform and\r\nthe Monument Square, so that the whole of this immense concourse,\r\ncompactly crowded together, breathless with attention, swayed by one\r\nsentiment of admiration and delight, was within the full view of the\r\nspeaker. The position and the occasion were the height of the moral\r\nsublime. \"When, after saying, 'It is not from my lips, it could not be\r\nfrom any human lips, that that strain of eloquence is this day to flow\r\nmost competent to move and excite the vast multitude around me,--the\r\npowerful speaker stands motionless before us,'--he paused, and pointed\r\nin silent admiration to the sublime structure, the audience burst into\r\nlong and loud applause. It was some moments before the speaker could go\r\non with the address.\"]\r\n\r\nA duty has been performed. A work of gratitude and patriotism is\r\ncompleted. This structure, having its foundations in soil which drank\r\ndeep of early Revolutionary blood, has at length reached its destined\r\nheight, and now lifts its summit to the skies.\r\n\r\nWe have assembled to celebrate the accomplishment of this undertaking,\r\nand to indulge afresh in the recollection of the great event which it is\r\ndesigned to commemorate. Eighteen years, more than half the ordinary\r\nduration of a generation of mankind, have elapsed since the corner-stone\r\nof this monument was laid. The hopes of its projectors rested on\r\nvoluntary contributions, private munificence, and the general favor of\r\nthe public. These hopes have not been disappointed. Donations have been\r\nmade by individuals, in some cases of large amount, and smaller sums\r\nhave been contributed by thousands. All who regard the object itself as\r\nimportant, and its accomplishment, therefore, as a good attained, will\r\nentertain sincere respect and gratitude for the unwearied efforts of the\r\nsuccessive presidents, boards of directors, and committees of the\r\nAssociation which has had the general control of the work. The\r\narchitect, equally entitled to our thanks and commendation, will find\r\nother reward, also, for his labor and skill, in the beauty and elegance\r\nof the obelisk itself, and the distinction which, as a work of art, it\r\nconfers upon him.\r\n\r\nAt a period when the prospects of further progress in the undertaking\r\nwere gloomy and discouraging, the Mechanic Association, by a most\r\npraiseworthy and vigorous effort, raised new funds for carrying it\r\nforward, and saw them applied with fidelity, economy, and skill. It is a\r\ngrateful duty to make public acknowledgments of such timely and\r\nefficient aid.\r\n\r\nThe last effort and the last contribution were from a different source.\r\nGarlands of grace and elegance were destined to crown a work which had\r\nits commencement in manly patriotism. The winning power of the sex\r\naddressed itself to the public, and all that was needed to carry the\r\nmonument to its proposed height, and to give to it its finish, was\r\npromptly supplied. The mothers and the daughters of the land contributed\r\nthus, most successfully, to whatever there is of beauty in the monument\r\nitself, or whatever of utility and public benefit and gratification\r\nthere is in its completion.\r\n\r\nOf those with whom the plan originated of erecting on this spot a\r\nmonument worthy of the event to be commemorated, many are now present;\r\nbut others, alas! have themselves become subjects of monumental\r\ninscription. William Tudor, an accomplished scholar, a distinguished\r\nwriter, a most amiable man, allied both by birth and sentiment to the\r\npatriots of the Revolution, died while on public service abroad, and now\r\nlies buried in a foreign land.[1] William Sullivan, a name fragrant of\r\nRevolutionary merit, and of public service and public virtue, who\r\nhimself partook in a high degree of the respect and confidence of the\r\ncommunity, and yet was always most loved where best known, has also been\r\ngathered to his fathers. And last, George Blake, a lawyer of learning\r\nand eloquence, a man of wit and of talent, of social qualities the most\r\nagreeable and fascinating, and of gifts which enabled him to exercise\r\nlarge sway over public assemblies, has closed his human career.[2] I\r\nknow that in the crowds before me there are those from whose eyes tears\r\nwill flow at the mention of these names. But such mention is due to\r\ntheir general character, their public and private virtues, and\r\nespecially, on this occasion, to the spirit and zeal with which they\r\nentered into the undertaking which is now completed.\r\n\r\nI have spoken only of those who are no longer numbered with the living.\r\nBut a long life, now drawing towards its close, always distinguished by\r\nacts of public spirit, humanity, and charity, forming a character which\r\nhas already become historical, and sanctified by public regard and the\r\naffection of friends, may confer even on the living the proper immunity\r\nof the dead, and be the fit subject of honorable mention and warm\r\ncommendation. Of the early projectors of the design of this monument,\r\none of the most prominent, the most zealous, and the most efficient, is\r\nThomas H. Perkins. It was beneath his ever-hospitable roof that those\r\nwhom I have mentioned, and others yet living and now present, having\r\nassembled for the purpose, adopted the first step towards erecting a\r\nmonument on Bunker Hill. Long may he remain, with unimpaired faculties,\r\nin the wide field of his usefulness! His charities have distilled, like\r\nthe dews of heaven; he has fed the hungry, and clothed the naked; he has\r\ngiven sight to the blind; and for such virtues there is a reward on\r\nhigh, of which all human memorials, all language of brass and stone, are\r\nbut humble types and attempted imitations.\r\n\r\nTime and nature have had their course, in diminishing the number of\r\nthose whom we met here on the 17th of June, 1825. Most of the\r\nRevolutionary characters then present have since deceased; and Lafayette\r\nsleeps in his native land. Yet the name and blood of Warren are with us;\r\nthe kindred of Putnam are also here; and near me, universally beloved\r\nfor his character and his virtues, and now venerable for his years, sits\r\nthe son of the noble-hearted and daring Prescott.[3] Gideon Foster of\r\nDanvers, Enos Reynolds of Boxford, Phineas Johnson, Robert Andrews,\r\nElijah Dresser, Josiah Cleaveland, Jesse Smith, Philip Bagley, Needham\r\nMaynard, Roger Plaisted, Joseph Stephens, Nehemiah Porter, and James\r\nHarvey, who bore arms for their country either at Concord and Lexington,\r\non the 19th of April, or on Bunker Hill, all now far advanced in age,\r\nhave come here to-day, to look once more on the field where their valor\r\nwas proved, and to receive a hearty outpouring of our respect.\r\n\r\nThey have long outlived the troubles and dangers of the Revolution; they\r\nhave outlived the evils arising from the want of a united and efficient\r\ngovernment; they have outlived the menace of imminent dangers to the\r\npublic liberty; they have outlived nearly all their contemporaries;--but\r\nthey have not outlived, they cannot outlive, the affectionate gratitude\r\nof their country. Heaven has not allotted to this generation an\r\nopportunity of rendering high services, and manifesting strong personal\r\ndevotion, such as they rendered and manifested, and in such a cause as\r\nthat which roused the patriotic fires of their youthful breasts, and\r\nnerved the strength of their arms. But we may praise what we cannot\r\nequal, and celebrate actions which we were not born to perform.\r\n_Pulchrum est benefacere reipublica, etiam bene dicere haud absurdum\r\nest._\r\n\r\nThe Bunker Hill Monument is finished. Here it stands. Fortunate in the\r\nhigh natural eminence on which it is placed, higher, infinitely higher\r\nin its objects and purpose, it rises over the land and over the sea;\r\nand, visible, at their homes, to three hundred thousand of the people of\r\nMassachusetts, it stands a memorial of the last, and a monitor to the\r\npresent, and to all succeeding generations. I have spoken of the\r\nloftiness of its purpose. If it had been without any other design than\r\nthe creation of a work of art, the granite of which it is composed would\r\nhave slept in its native bed. It has a purpose, and that purpose gives\r\nit its character. That purpose enrobes it with dignity and moral\r\ngrandeur. That well-known purpose it is which causes us to look up to it\r\nwith a feeling of awe. It is itself the orator of this occasion. It is\r\nnot from my lips, it could not be from any human lips, that that strain\r\nof eloquence is this day to flow most competent to move and excite the\r\nvast multitudes around me. The powerful speaker stands motionless before\r\nus. It is a plain shaft. It bears no inscriptions, fronting to the\r\nrising sun, from which the future antiquary shall wipe the dust. Nor\r\ndoes the rising sun cause tones of music to issue from its summit. But\r\nat the rising of the sun, and at the setting of the sun; in the blaze of\r\nnoonday, and beneath the milder effulgence of lunar light; it looks, it\r\nspeaks, it acts, to the full comprehension of every American mind, and\r\nthe awakening of glowing enthusiasm in every American heart. Its silent,\r\nbut awful utterance; its deep pathos, as it brings to our contemplation\r\nthe 17th of June, 1775, and the consequences which have resulted to us,\r\nto our country, and to the world, from the events of that day, and which\r\nwe know must continue to rain influence on the destinies of mankind to\r\nthe end of time; the elevation with which it raises us high above the\r\nordinary feelings of life,--surpass all that the study of the closet, or\r\neven the inspiration of genius, can produce. To-day it speaks to us. Its\r\nfuture auditories will be the successive generations of men, as they\r\nrise up before it and gather around it. Its speech will be of patriotism\r\nand courage; of civil and religious liberty; of free government; of the\r\nmoral improvement and elevation of mankind; and of the immortal memory\r\nof those who, with heroic devotion, have sacrificed their lives for\r\ntheir country.[4]\r\n\r\nIn the older world, numerous fabrics still exist, reared by human hands,\r\nbut whose object has been lost in the darkness of ages. They are now\r\nmonuments of nothing but the labor and skill which constructed them.\r\n\r\nThe mighty pyramid itself, half buried in the sands of Africa, has\r\nnothing to bring down and report to us, but the power of kings and the\r\nservitude of the people. If it had any purpose beyond that of a\r\nmausoleum, such purpose has perished from history and from tradition. If\r\nasked for its moral object, its admonition, its sentiment, its\r\ninstruction to mankind, or any high end in its erection, it is silent;\r\nsilent as the millions which lie in the dust at its base, and in the\r\ncatacombs which surround it. Without a just moral object, therefore,\r\nmade known to man, though raised against the skies, it excites only\r\nconviction of power, mixed with strange wonder. But if the civilization\r\nof the present race of men, founded, as it is, in solid science, the\r\ntrue knowledge of nature, and vast discoveries in art, and which is\r\nelevated and purified by moral sentiment and by the truths of\r\nChristianity, be not destined to destruction before the final\r\ntermination of human existence on earth, the object and purpose of this\r\nedifice will be known till that hour shall come. And even if\r\ncivilization should be subverted, and the truths of the Christian\r\nreligion obscured by a new deluge of barbarism, the memory of Bunker\r\nHill and the American Revolution will still be elements and parts of the\r\nknowledge which shall be possessed by the last man to whom the light of\r\ncivilization and Christianity shall be extended.\r\n\r\nThis celebration is honored by the presence of the chief executive\r\nmagistrate of the Union. An occasion so national in its object and\r\ncharacter, and so much connected with that Revolution from which the\r\ngovernment sprang at the head of which he is placed, may well receive\r\nfrom him this mark of attention and respect. Well acquainted with\r\nYorktown, the scene of the last great military struggle of the\r\nRevolution, his eye now surveys the field of Bunker Hill, the theatre\r\nof the first of those important conflicts. He sees where Warren fell,\r\nwhere Putnam, and Prescott, and Stark, and Knowlton, and Brooks fought.\r\nHe beholds the spot where a thousand trained soldiers of England were\r\nsmitten to the earth, in the first effort of revolutionary war, by the\r\narm of a bold and determined yeomanry, contending for liberty and their\r\ncountry. And while all assembled here entertain towards him sincere\r\npersonal good wishes and the high respect due to his elevated office and\r\nstation, it is not to be doubted that he enters, with true American\r\nfeeling, into the patriotic enthusiasm kindled by the occasion which\r\nanimates the multitudes that surround him.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency, the Governor of the Commonwealth, the Governor of Rhode\r\nIsland, and the other distinguished public men whom we have the honor to\r\nreceive as visitors and guests to-day, will cordially unite in a\r\ncelebration connected with the great event of the Revolutionary war.\r\n\r\nNo name in the history of 1775 and 1776 is more distinguished than that\r\nborne by an ex-President of the United States, whom we expected to see\r\nhere, but whose ill health prevents his attendance. Whenever popular\r\nrights were to be asserted, an Adams was present; and when the time came\r\nfor the formal Declaration of Independence, it was the voice of an Adams\r\nthat shook the halls of Congress. We wish we could have welcomed to us\r\nthis day the inheritor of Revolutionary blood, and the just and worthy\r\nrepresentative of high Revolutionary names, merit, and services.\r\n\r\nBanners and badges, processions and flags, announce to us, that amidst\r\nthis uncounted throng are thousands of natives of New England now\r\nresidents in other States. Welcome, ye kindred names, with kindred\r\nblood! From the broad savannas of the South, from the newer regions of\r\nthe West, from amidst the hundreds of thousands of men of Eastern origin\r\nwho cultivate the rich valley of the Genesee or live along the chain of\r\nthe Lakes, from the mountains of Pennsylvania, and from the thronged\r\ncities of the coast, welcome, welcome! Wherever else you may be\r\nstrangers, here you are all at home. You assemble at this shrine of\r\nliberty, near the family altars at which your earliest devotions were\r\npaid to Heaven, near to the temples of worship first entered by you, and\r\nnear to the schools and colleges in which your education was received.\r\nYou come hither with a glorious ancestry of liberty. You bring names\r\nwhich are on the rolls of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill. You come,\r\nsome of you, once more to be embraced by an aged Revolutionary father,\r\nor to receive another, perhaps a last, blessing, bestowed in love and\r\ntears, by a mother, yet surviving to witness and to enjoy your\r\nprosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nBut if family associations and the recollections of the past bring you\r\nhither with greater alacrity, and mingle with your greeting much of\r\nlocal attachment and private affection, greeting also be given, free and\r\nhearty greeting, to every American citizen who treads this sacred soil\r\nwith patriotic feeling, and respires with pleasure in an atmosphere\r\nperfumed with the recollections of 1775! This occasion is respectable,\r\nnay, it is grand, it is sublime, by the nationality of its sentiment.\r\nAmong the seventeen millions of happy people who form the American\r\ncommunity, there is not one who has not an interest in this monument, as\r\nthere is not one that has not a deep and abiding interest in that which\r\nit commemorates.\r\n\r\nWoe betide the man who brings to this day's worship feeling less than\r\nwholly American! Woe betide the man who can stand here with the fires of\r\nlocal resentments burning, or the purpose of fomenting local jealousies\r\nand the strifes of local interests festering and rankling in his heart!\r\nUnion, established in justice, in patriotism, and the most plain and\r\nobvious common interest,--union, founded on the same love of liberty,\r\ncemented by blood shed in the same common cause,--union has been the\r\nsource of all our glory and greatness thus far, and is the ground of\r\nall our highest hopes. This column stands on Union. I know not that it\r\nmight not keep its position, if the American Union, in the mad conflict\r\nof human passions, and in the strife of parties and factions, should be\r\nbroken up and destroyed. I know not that it would totter and fall to the\r\nearth, and mingle its fragments with the fragments of Liberty and the\r\nConstitution, when State should be separated from State, and faction and\r\ndismemberment obliterate for ever all the hopes of the founders of our\r\nrepublic, and the great inheritance of their children. It might stand.\r\nBut who, from beneath the weight of mortification and shame that would\r\noppress him, could look up to behold it? Whose eyeballs would not be\r\nseared by such a spectacle? For my part, should I live to such a time, I\r\nshall avert my eyes from it for ever.\r\n\r\nIt is not as a mere military encounter of hostile armies that the battle\r\nof Bunker Hill presents its principal claim to attention. Yet, even as a\r\nmere battle, there were circumstances attending it extraordinary in\r\ncharacter, and entitling it to peculiar distinction. It was fought on\r\nthis eminence; in the neighborhood of yonder city; in the presence of\r\nmany more spectators than there were combatants in the conflict. Men,\r\nwomen, and children, from every commanding position, were gazing at the\r\nbattle, and looking for its results with all the eagerness natural to\r\nthose who knew that the issue was fraught with the deepest consequences\r\nto themselves, personally, as well as to their country. Yet, on the 16th\r\nof June, 1775, there was nothing around this hill but verdure and\r\nculture. There was, indeed, the note of awful preparation in Boston.\r\nThere was the Provincial army at Cambridge, with its right flank resting\r\non Dorchester, and its left on Chelsea. But here all was peace.\r\nTranquillity reigned around. On the 17th, every thing was changed. On\r\nthis eminence had arisen, in the night, a redoubt, built by Prescott,\r\nand in which he held command. Perceived by the enemy at dawn, it was\r\nimmediately cannonaded from the floating batteries in the river, and\r\nfrom the opposite shore. And then ensued the hurried movement in Boston,\r\nand soon the troops of Britain embarked in the attempt to dislodge the\r\nColonists. In an hour every thing indicated an immediate and bloody\r\nconflict. Love of liberty on one side, proud defiance of rebellion on\r\nthe other, hopes and fears, and courage and daring, on both sides,\r\nanimated the hearts of the combatants as they hung on the edge of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nI suppose it would be difficult, in a military point of view, to ascribe\r\nto the leaders on either side any just motive for the engagement which\r\nfollowed. On the one hand, it could not have been very important to the\r\nAmericans to attempt to hem the British within the town, by advancing\r\none single post a quarter of a mile; while, on the other hand, if the\r\nBritish found it essential to dislodge the American troops, they had it\r\nin their power at no expense of life. By moving up their ships and\r\nbatteries, they could have completely cut off all communication with the\r\nmainland over the Neck, and the forces in the redoubt would have been\r\nreduced to a state of famine in forty-eight hours.\r\n\r\nBut that was not the day for any such consideration on either side! Both\r\nparties were anxious to try the strength of their arms. The pride of\r\nEngland would not permit the rebels, as she termed them, to defy her to\r\nthe teeth; and, without for a moment calculating the cost, the British\r\ngeneral determined to destroy the fort immediately. On the other side,\r\nPrescott and his gallant followers longed and thirsted for a decisive\r\ntrial of strength and of courage. They wished a battle, and wished it at\r\nonce. And this is the true secret of the movements on this hill.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to describe that battle. The cannonading; the landing\r\nof the British; their advance; the coolness with which the charge was\r\nmet; the repulse; the second attack; the second repulse; the burning of\r\nCharlestown; and, finally, the closing assault, and the slow retreat of\r\nthe Americans,--the history of all these is familiar.\r\n\r\nBut the consequences of the battle of Bunker Hill were greater than\r\nthose of any ordinary conflict, although between armies of far greater\r\nforce, and terminating with more immediate advantage on the one side or\r\nthe other. It was the first great battle of the Revolution; and not only\r\nthe first blow, but the blow which determined the contest. It did not,\r\nindeed, put an end to the war, but in the then existing hostile state of\r\nfeeling, the difficulties could only be referred to the arbitration of\r\nthe sword. And one thing is certain: that after the New England troops\r\nhad shown themselves able to face and repulse the regulars, it was\r\ndecided that peace never could be established, but upon the basis of the\r\nindependence of the Colonies. When the sun of that day went down, the\r\nevent of Independence was no longer doubtful. In a few days Washington\r\nheard of the battle, and he inquired if the militia had stood the fire\r\nof the regulars. When told that they had not only stood that fire, but\r\nreserved their own till the enemy was within eight rods, and then poured\r\nit in with tremendous effect, \"Then,\" exclaimed he, \"the liberties of\r\nthe country are safe!\"\r\n\r\nThe consequences of this battle were just of the same importance as the\r\nRevolution itself.\r\n\r\nIf there was nothing of value in the principles of the American\r\nRevolution, then there is nothing valuable in the battle of Bunker Hill\r\nand its consequences. But if the Revolution was an era in the history of\r\nman favorable to human happiness, if it was an event which marked the\r\nprogress of man all over the world from despotism to liberty, then this\r\nmonument is not raised without cause. Then the battle of Bunker Hill is\r\nnot an event undeserving; celebrations, commemorations, and rejoicings,\r\nnow and in all coming times.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the true and peculiar principle of the American\r\nRevolution, and of the systems of government which it has confirmed and\r\nestablished? The truth is, that the American Revolution was not caused\r\nby the instantaneous discovery of principles of government before\r\nunheard of, or the practical adoption of political ideas such as had\r\nnever before entered into the minds of men. It was but the full\r\ndevelopment of principles of government, forms of society, and political\r\nsentiments, the origin of all which lay back two centuries in English\r\nand American history.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America, its colonization by the nations of Europe, the\r\nhistory and progress of the colonies, from their establishment to the\r\ntime when the principal of them threw off their allegiance to the\r\nrespective states by which they had been planted, and founded\r\ngovernments of their own, constitute one of the most interesting\r\nportions of the annals of man. These events occupied three hundred\r\nyears; during which period civilization and knowledge made steady\r\nprogress in the Old World; so that Europe, at the commencement of the\r\nnineteenth century, had become greatly changed from that Europe which\r\nbegan the colonization of America at the close of the fifteenth, or the\r\ncommencement of the sixteenth. And what is most material to my present\r\npurpose is, that in the progress of the first of these centuries, that\r\nis to say, from the discovery of America to the settlements of Virginia\r\nand Massachusetts, political and religious events took place, which most\r\nmaterially affected the state of society and the sentiments of mankind,\r\nespecially in England and in parts of Continental Europe. After a few\r\nfeeble and unsuccessful efforts by England, under Henry the Seventh, to\r\nplant colonies in America, no designs of that kind were prosecuted for a\r\nlong period, either by the English government or any of its subjects.\r\nWithout inquiring into the causes of this delay, its consequences are\r\nsufficiently clear and striking. England, in this lapse of a century,\r\nunknown to herself, but under the providence of God and the influence of\r\nevents, was fitting herself for the work of colonizing North America, on\r\nsuch principles, and by such men, as should spread the English name and\r\nEnglish blood, in time, over a great portion of the Western hemisphere.\r\nThe commercial spirit was greatly fostered by several laws passed in\r\nthe reign of Henry the Seventh; and in the same reign encouragement was\r\ngiven to arts and manufactures in the eastern counties, and some not\r\nunimportant modifications of the feudal system took place, by allowing\r\nthe breaking of entails. These and other measures, and other\r\noccurrences, were making way for a new class of society to emerge, and\r\nshow itself, in a military and feudal age; a middle class, between the\r\nbarons or great landholders and the retainers of the crown, on the one\r\nside, and the tenants of the crown and barons, and agricultural and\r\nother laborers, on the other side. With the rise and growth of this new\r\nclass of society, not only did commerce and the arts increase, but\r\nbetter education, a greater degree of knowledge, juster notions of the\r\ntrue ends of government, and sentiments favorable to civil liberty,\r\nbegan to spread abroad, and become more and more common. But the plants\r\nspringing from these seeds were of slow growth. The character of English\r\nsociety had indeed begun to undergo a change; but changes of national\r\ncharacter are ordinarily the work of time. Operative causes were,\r\nhowever, evidently in existence, and sure to produce, ultimately, their\r\nproper effect. From the accession of Henry the Seventh to the breaking\r\nout of the civil wars, England enjoyed much greater exemption from war,\r\nforeign and domestic, than for a long period before, and during the\r\ncontroversy between the houses of York and Lancaster. These years of\r\npeace were favorable to commerce and the arts. Commerce and the arts\r\naugmented general and individual knowledge; and knowledge is the only\r\nfountain, both of the love and the principles of human liberty.\r\n\r\nOther powerful causes soon came into active play. The Reformation of\r\nLuther broke out, kindling up the minds of men afresh, leading to new\r\nhabits of thought, and awakening in individuals energies before unknown\r\neven to themselves. The religious controversies of this period changed\r\nsociety, as well as religion; indeed, it would be easy to prove, if this\r\noccasion were proper for it, that they changed society to a considerable\r\nextent, where they did not change the religion of the state. They\r\nchanged man himself, in his modes of thought, his consciousness of his\r\nown powers, and his desire of intellectual attainment. The spirit of\r\ncommercial and foreign adventure, therefore, on the one hand, which had\r\ngained so much strength and influence since the time of the discovery of\r\nAmerica, and, on the other, the assertion and maintenance of religious\r\nliberty, having their source indeed in the Reformation, but continued,\r\ndiversified, and constantly strengthened by the subsequent divisions of\r\nsentiment and opinion among the Reformers themselves, and this love of\r\nreligious liberty drawing after it, or bringing along with it, as it\r\nalways does, an ardent devotion to the principle of civil liberty also,\r\nwere the powerful influences under which character was formed, and men\r\ntrained, for the great work of introducing English civilization, English\r\nlaw, and, what is more than all, Anglo-Saxon blood, into the wilderness\r\nof North America. Raleigh and his companions may be considered as the\r\ncreatures, principally, of the first of these causes. High-spirited,\r\nfull of the love of personal adventure, excited, too, in some degree, by\r\nthe hopes of sudden riches from the discovery of mines of the precious\r\nmetals, and not unwilling to diversify the labors of settling a colony\r\nwith occasional cruising against the Spaniards in the West Indian seas,\r\nthey crossed and recrossed the ocean, with a frequency which surprises\r\nus, when we consider the state of navigation, and which evinces a most\r\ndaring spirit.\r\n\r\nThe other cause peopled New England. The Mayflower sought our shores\r\nunder no high-wrought spirit of commercial adventure, no love of gold,\r\nno mixture of purpose warlike or hostile to any human being. Like the\r\ndove from the ark, she had put forth only to find rest. Solemn\r\nsupplications on the shore of the sea, in Holland, had invoked for her,\r\nat her departure, the blessings of Providence. The stars which guided\r\nher were the unobscured constellations of civil and religious liberty.\r\nHer deck was the altar of the living God. Fervent prayers on bended\r\nknees mingled, morning and evening, with the voices of ocean, and the\r\nsighing of the wind in her shrouds. Every prosperous breeze, which,\r\ngently swelling her sails, helped the Pilgrims onward in their course,\r\nawoke new anthems of praise; and when the elements were wrought into\r\nfury, neither the tempest, tossing their fragile bark like a feather,\r\nnor the darkness and howling of the midnight storm, ever disturbed, in\r\nman or woman, the firm and settled purpose of their souls, to undergo\r\nall, and to do all, that the meekest patience, the boldest resolution,\r\nand the highest trust in God, could enable human beings to suffer or to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nSome differences may, doubtless, be traced at this day between the\r\ndescendants of the early colonists of Virginia and those of New England,\r\nowing to the different influences and different circumstances under\r\nwhich the respective settlements were made; but only enough to create a\r\npleasing variety in the midst of a general family resemblance.\r\n\r\n                 \"Facies, non omnibus una,\r\n    Nec diversa tamen, qualem decet esse sororum.\"\r\n\r\nBut the habits, sentiments, and objects of both soon became modified by\r\nlocal causes, growing out of their condition in the New World; and as\r\nthis condition was essentially alike in both, and as both at once\r\nadopted the same general rules and principles of English jurisprudence,\r\nand became accustomed to the authority of representative bodies, these\r\ndifferences gradually diminished. They disappeared by the progress of\r\ntime, and the influence of intercourse. The necessity of some degree of\r\nunion and co-operation to defend themselves against the savage tribes,\r\ntended to excite in them mutual respect and regard. They fought together\r\nin the wars against France. The great and common cause of the Revolution\r\nbound them to one another by new links of brotherhood; and at length the\r\npresent constitution of government united them happily and gloriously,\r\nto form the great republic of the world, and bound up their interests\r\nand fortunes, till the whole earth sees that there is now for them, in\r\npresent possession as well as in future hope, but \"One Country, One\r\nConstitution, and One Destiny.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonization of the tropical region, and the whole of the southern\r\nparts of the continent, by Spain and Portugal, was conducted on other\r\nprinciples, under the influence of other motives, and followed by far\r\ndifferent consequences. From the time of its discovery, the Spanish\r\ngovernment pushed forward its settlements in America, not only with\r\nvigor, but with eagerness; so that long before the first permanent\r\nEnglish settlement had been accomplished in what is now the United\r\nStates, Spain had conquered Mexico, Peru, and Chili, and stretched her\r\npower over nearly all the territory she ever acquired on this continent.\r\nThe rapidity of these conquests is to be ascribed in a great degree to\r\nthe eagerness, not to say the rapacity, of those numerous bands of\r\nadventurers, who were stimulated by individual interests and private\r\nhopes to subdue immense regions, and take possession of them in the name\r\nof the crown of Spain. The mines of gold and silver were the incitements\r\nto these efforts, and accordingly settlements were generally made, and\r\nSpanish authority established immediately on the subjugation of\r\nterritory, that the native population might be set to work by their new\r\nSpanish masters in the mines. From these facts, the love of gold--gold,\r\nnot produced by industry, nor accumulated by commerce, but gold dug from\r\nits native bed in the bowels of the earth, and that earth ravished from\r\nits rightful possessors by every possible degree of enormity, cruelty,\r\nand crime--was long the governing passion in Spanish wars and Spanish\r\nsettlements in America. Even Columbus himself did not wholly escape the\r\ninfluence of this base motive. In his early voyages we find him passing\r\nfrom island to island, inquiring everywhere for gold; as if God had\r\nopened the New World to the knowledge of the Old, only to gratify a\r\npassion equally senseless and sordid, and to offer up millions of an\r\nunoffending race of men to the destruction of the sword, sharpened both\r\nby cruelty and rapacity. And yet Columbus was far above his age and\r\ncountry. Enthusiastic, indeed, but sober, religious, and magnanimous;\r\nborn to great things and capable of high sentiments, as his noble\r\ndiscourse before Ferdinand and Isabella, as well as the whole history of\r\nhis life, shows. Probably he sacrificed much to the known sentiments of\r\nothers, and addressed to his followers motives likely to influence them.\r\nAt the same time, it is evident that he himself looked upon the world\r\nwhich he discovered as a world of wealth, all ready to be seized and\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe conquerors and the European settlers of Spanish America were mainly\r\nmilitary commanders and common soldiers. The monarchy of Spain was not\r\ntransferred to this hemisphere, but it acted in it, as it acted at home,\r\nthrough its ordinary means, and its true representative, military force.\r\nThe robbery and destruction of the native race was the achievement of\r\nstanding armies, in the right of the king, and by his authority,\r\nfighting in his name, for the aggrandizement of his power and the\r\nextension of his prerogatives, with military ideas under arbitrary\r\nmaxims,--a portion of that dreadful instrumentality by which a perfect\r\ndespotism governs a people. As there was no liberty in Spain, how could\r\nliberty be transmitted to Spanish colonies?\r\n\r\nThe colonists of English America were of the people, and a people\r\nalready free. They were of the middle, industrious, and already\r\nprosperous class, the inhabitants of commercial and manufacturing\r\ncities, among whom liberty first revived and respired, after a sleep of\r\na thousand years in the bosom of the Dark Ages. Spain descended on the\r\nNew World in the armed and terrible image of her monarchy and her\r\nsoldiery; England approached it in the winning and popular garb of\r\npersonal rights, public protection, and civil freedom. England\r\ntransplanted liberty to America; Spain transplanted power. England,\r\nthrough the agency of private companies and the efforts of individuals,\r\ncolonized this part of North America by industrious individuals, making\r\ntheir own way in the wilderness, defending themselves against the\r\nsavages, recognizing their right to the soil, and with a general honest\r\npurpose of introducing knowledge as well as Christianity among them.\r\nSpain stooped on South America, like a vulture on its prey. Every thing\r\nwas force. Territories were acquired by fire and sword. Cities were\r\ndestroyed by fire and sword. Hundreds of thousands of human beings fell\r\nby fire and sword. Even conversion to Christianity was attempted by fire\r\nand sword.\r\n\r\nBehold, then, fellow-citizens, the difference resulting from the\r\noperation of the two principles! Here, to-day, on the summit of Bunker\r\nHill, and at the foot of this monument, behold the difference! I would\r\nthat the fifty thousand voices present could proclaim it with a shout\r\nwhich should be heard over the globe. Our inheritance was of liberty,\r\nsecured and regulated by law, and enlightened by religion and knowledge;\r\nthat of South America was of power, stern, unrelenting, tyrannical,\r\nmilitary power. And now look to the consequences of the two principles\r\non the general and aggregate happiness of the human race. Behold the\r\nresults, in all the regions conquered by Cortéz and Pizarro, and the\r\ncontrasted results here. I suppose the territory of the United States\r\nmay amount to one eighth, or one tenth, of that colonized by Spain on\r\nthis continent; and yet in all that vast region there are but between\r\none and two millions of people of European color and European blood,\r\nwhile in the United States there are fourteen millions who rejoice in\r\ntheir descent from the people of the more northern part of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut we may follow the difference in the original principle of\r\ncolonization, and in its character and objects, still further. We must\r\nlook to moral and intellectual results; we must consider consequences,\r\nnot only as they show themselves in hastening or retarding the increase\r\nof population and the supply of physical wants, but in their\r\ncivilization, improvement, and happiness. We must inquire what progress\r\nhas been made in the true science of liberty, in the knowledge of the\r\ngreat principles of self-government, and in the progress of man, as a\r\nsocial, moral, and religious being.\r\n\r\nI would not willingly say any thing on this occasion discourteous to the\r\nnew governments founded on the demolition of the power of the Spanish\r\nmonarchy. They are yet on their trial, and I hope for a favorable\r\nresult. But truth, sacred truth, and fidelity to the cause of civil\r\nliberty, compel me to say, that hitherto they have discovered quite too\r\nmuch of the spirit of that monarchy from which they separated\r\nthemselves. Quite too frequent resort is made to military force; and\r\nquite too much of the substance of the people is consumed in maintaining\r\narmies, not for defence against foreign aggression, but for enforcing\r\nobedience to domestic authority. Standing armies are the oppressive\r\ninstruments for governing the people, in the hands of hereditary and\r\narbitrary monarchs. A military republic, a government founded on mock\r\nelections and supported only by the sword, is a movement indeed, but a\r\nretrograde and disastrous movement, from the regular and old-fashioned\r\nmonarchical systems. If men would enjoy the blessings of republican\r\ngovernment, they must govern themselves by reason, by mutual counsel and\r\nconsultation, by a sense and feeling of general interest, and by the\r\nacquiescence of the minority in the will of the majority, properly\r\nexpressed; and, above all, the military must be kept, according to the\r\nlanguage of our Bill of Rights, in strict subordination to the civil\r\nauthority. Wherever this lesson is not both learned and practised, there\r\ncan be no political freedom. Absurd, preposterous is it, a scoff and a\r\nsatire on free forms of constitutional liberty, for frames of government\r\nto be prescribed by military leaders, and the right of suffrage to be\r\nexercised at the point of the sword.\r\n\r\nMaking all allowance for situation and climate, it cannot be doubted by\r\nintelligent minds, that the difference now existing between North and\r\nSouth America is justly attributable, in a great degree, to political\r\ninstitutions in the Old World and in the New. And how broad that\r\ndifference is! Suppose an assembly, in one of the valleys or on the side\r\nof one of the mountains of the southern half of the hemisphere, to be\r\nheld, this day, in the neighborhood of a large city;--what would be the\r\nscene presented? Yonder is a volcano, flaming and smoking, but shedding\r\nno light, moral or intellectual. At its foot is the mine, sometimes\r\nyielding, perhaps, large gains to capital, but in which labor is\r\ndestined to eternal and unrequited toil, and followed only by penury and\r\nbeggary. The city is filled with armed men; not a free people, armed and\r\ncoming forth voluntarily to rejoice in a public festivity, but hireling\r\ntroops, supported by forced loans, excessive impositions on commerce, or\r\ntaxes wrung from a half-fed and a half-clothed population. For the great\r\nthere are palaces covered with gold; for the poor there are hovels of\r\nthe meanest sort. There is an ecclesiastical hierarchy, enjoying the\r\nwealth of princes; but there are no means of education for the people.\r\nDo public improvements favor intercourse between place and place? So far\r\nfrom this, the traveller cannot pass from town to town, without danger,\r\nevery mile, of robbery and assassination. I would not overcharge or\r\nexaggerate this picture; but its principal features are all too truly\r\nsketched.\r\n\r\nAnd how does it contrast with the scene now actually before us? Look\r\nround upon these fields; they are verdant and beautiful, well\r\ncultivated, and at this moment loaded with the riches of the early\r\nharvest. The hands which till them are those of the free owners of the\r\nsoil, enjoying equal rights, and protected by law from oppression and\r\ntyranny. Look to the thousand vessels in our sight, filling the harbor,\r\nor covering the neighboring sea. They are the vehicles of a profitable\r\ncommerce, carried on by men who know that the profits of their hardy\r\nenterprise, when they make them, are their own; and this commerce is\r\nencouraged and regulated by wise laws, and defended, when need be, by\r\nthe valor and patriotism of the country. Look to that fair city, the\r\nabode of so much diffused wealth, so much general happiness and comfort,\r\nso much personal independence, and so much general knowledge, and not\r\nundistinguished, I may be permitted to add, for hospitality and social\r\nrefinement. She fears no forced contributions, no siege or sacking from\r\nmilitary leaders of rival factions. The hundred temples in which her\r\ncitizens worship God are in no danger of sacrilege. The regular\r\nadministration of the laws encounters no obstacle. The long processions\r\nof children and youth, which you see this day, issuing by thousands from\r\nher free schools, prove the care and anxiety with which a popular\r\ngovernment provides for the education and morals of the people.\r\nEverywhere there is order; everywhere there is security. Everywhere the\r\nlaw reaches to the highest and reaches to the lowest, to protect all in\r\ntheir rights, and to restrain all from wrong; and over all hovers\r\nliberty,--that liberty for which our fathers fought and fell on this\r\nvery spot, with her eye ever watchful, and her eagle wing ever wide\r\noutspread.\r\n\r\nThe colonies of Spain, from their origin to their end, were subject to\r\nthe sovereign authority of the mother country. Their government, as well\r\nas their commerce, was a strict home monopoly. If we add to this the\r\nestablished usage of filling important posts in the administration of\r\nthe colonies exclusively by natives of Old Spain, thus cutting off for\r\never all hopes of honorable preferment from every man born in the\r\nWestern hemisphere, causes enough rise up before us at once to account\r\nfully for the subsequent history and character of these provinces. The\r\nviceroys and provincial governors of Spain were never at home in their\r\ngovernments in America. They did not feel that they were of the people\r\nwhom they governed. Their official character and employment have a good\r\ndeal of resemblance to those of the proconsuls of Rome, in Asia, Sicily,\r\nand Gaul; but obviously no resemblance to those of Carver and Winthrop,\r\nand very little to those of the governors of Virginia after that Colony\r\nhad established a popular House of Burgesses.\r\n\r\nThe English colonists in America, generally speaking, were men who were\r\nseeking new homes in a new world. They brought with them their families\r\nand all that was most dear to them. This was especially the case with\r\nthe colonists of Plymouth and Massachusetts. Many of them were educated\r\nmen, and all possessed their full share, according to their social\r\ncondition, of the knowledge and attainments of that age. The distinctive\r\ncharacteristic of their settlement is the introduction of the\r\ncivilization of Europe into a wilderness, without bringing with it the\r\npolitical institutions of Europe. The arts, sciences, and literature of\r\nEngland came over with the settlers. That great portion of the common\r\nlaw which regulates the social and personal relations and conduct of\r\nmen, came also. The jury came; the _habeas corpus_ came; the\r\ntestamentary power came; and the law of inheritance and descent came\r\nalso, except that part of it which recognizes the rights of\r\nprimogeniture, which either did not come at all, or soon gave way to the\r\nrule of equal partition of estates among children. But the monarchy did\r\nnot come, nor the aristocracy, nor the church, as an estate of the\r\nrealm. Political institutions were to be framed anew, such as should be\r\nadapted to the state of things. But it could not be doubtful what should\r\nbe the nature and character of these institutions. A general social\r\nequality prevailed among the settlers, and an equality of political\r\nrights seemed the natural, if not the necessary consequence. After forty\r\nyears of revolution, violence, and war, the people of France have placed\r\nat the head of the fundamental instrument of their government, as the\r\ngreat boon obtained by all their sufferings and sacrifices, the\r\ndeclaration that all Frenchmen are equal before the law. What France\r\nhas reached only by the expenditure of so much blood and treasure, and\r\nthe perpetration of so much crime, the English colonists obtained by\r\nsimply changing their place, carrying with them the intellectual and\r\nmoral culture of Europe, and the personal and social relations to which\r\nthey were accustomed, but leaving behind their political institutions.\r\nIt has been said with much vivacity, that the felicity of the American\r\ncolonists consisted in their escape from the past. This is true so far\r\nas respects political establishments, but no further. They brought with\r\nthem a full portion of all the riches of the past, in science, in art,\r\nin morals, religion, and literature. The Bible came with them. And it is\r\nnot to be doubted, that to the free and universal reading of the Bible,\r\nin that age, men were much indebted for right views of civil liberty.\r\nThe Bible is a book of faith, and a book of doctrine, and a book of\r\nmorals, and a book of religion, of especial revelation from God; but it\r\nis also a book which teaches man his own individual responsibility, his\r\nown dignity, and his equality with his fellow-man.\r\n\r\nBacon and Locke, and Shakspeare and Milton, also came with the\r\ncolonists. It was the object of the first settlers to form new political\r\nsystems, but all that belonged to cultivated man, to family, to\r\nneighborhood, to social relations, accompanied them. In the Doric phrase\r\nof one of our own historians, \"they came to settle on bare creation\";\r\nbut their settlement in the wilderness, nevertheless, was not a\r\nlodgement of nomadic tribes, a mere resting-place of roaming savages. It\r\nwas the beginning of a permanent community, the fixed residence of\r\ncultivated men. Not only was English literature read, but English, good\r\nEnglish, was spoken and written, before the axe had made way to let in\r\nthe sun upon the habitations and fields of Plymouth and Massachusetts.\r\nAnd whatever may be said to the contrary, a correct use of the English\r\nlanguage is, at this day, more general throughout the United States,\r\nthan it is throughout England herself.\r\n\r\nBut another grand characteristic is, that, in the English colonies,\r\npolitical affairs were left to be managed by the colonists themselves.\r\nThis is another fact wholly distinguishing them in character, as it has\r\ndistinguished them in fortune, from the colonists of Spain. Here lies\r\nthe foundation of that experience in self-government, which has\r\npreserved order, and security, and regularity, amidst the play of\r\npopular institutions. Home government was the secret of the prosperity\r\nof the North American settlements. The more distinguished of the New\r\nEngland colonists, with a most remarkable sagacity and a long-sighted\r\nreach into futurity, refused to come to America unless they could bring\r\nwith them charters providing for the administration of their affairs in\r\nthis country.[5] They saw from the first the evils of being governed in\r\nthe New World by a power fixed in the Old. Acknowledging the general\r\nsuperiority of the crown, they still insisted on the right of passing\r\nlocal laws, and of local administration. And history teaches us the\r\njustice and the value of this determination in the example of Virginia.\r\nThe early attempts to settle that Colony failed, sometimes with the most\r\nmelancholy and fatal consequences, from want of knowledge, care, and\r\nattention on the part of those who had the charge of their affairs in\r\nEngland; and it was only after the issuing of the third charter, that\r\nits prosperity fairly commenced. The cause was, that by that third\r\ncharter the people of Virginia, for by this time they deserved to be so\r\ncalled, were allowed to constitute and establish the first popular\r\nrepresentative assembly which ever convened on this continent, the\r\nVirginia House of Burgesses.\r\n\r\nThe great elements, then, of the American system of government,\r\noriginally introduced by the colonists, and which were early in\r\noperation, and ready to be developed, more and more, as the progress of\r\nevents should justify or demand, were,--\r\n\r\nEscape from the existing political systems of Europe, including its\r\nreligious hierarchies, but the continued possession and enjoyment of its\r\nscience and arts, its literature, and its manners;\r\n\r\nHome government, or the power of making in the colony the municipal laws\r\nwhich were to govern it;\r\n\r\nEquality of rights;\r\n\r\nRepresentative assemblies, or forms of government founded on popular\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nFew topics are more inviting, or more fit for philosophical discussion,\r\nthan the effect on the happiness of mankind of institutions founded upon\r\nthese principles; or, in other words, the influence of the New World\r\nupon the Old.\r\n\r\nHer obligations to Europe for science and art, laws, literature, and\r\nmanners, America acknowledges as she ought, with respect and gratitude.\r\nThe people of the United States, descendants of the English stock,\r\ngrateful for the treasures of knowledge derived from their English\r\nancestors, admit also, with thanks and filial regard, that among those\r\nancestors, under the culture of Hampden and Sydney and other assiduous\r\nfriends, that seed of popular liberty first germinated, which on our\r\nsoil has shot up to its full height, until its branches overshadow all\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nBut America has not failed to make returns. If she has not wholly\r\ncancelled the obligation, or equalled it by others of like weight, she\r\nhas, at least, made respectable advances towards repaying the debt. And\r\nshe admits, that, standing in the midst of civilized nations, and in a\r\ncivilized age, a nation among nations, there is a high part which she is\r\nexpected to act, for the general advancement of human interests and\r\nhuman welfare.\r\n\r\nAmerican mines have filled the mints of Europe with the precious metals.\r\nThe productions of the American soil and climate have poured out their\r\nabundance of luxuries for the tables of the rich, and of necessaries for\r\nthe sustenance of the poor. Birds and animals of beauty and value have\r\nbeen added to the European stocks; and transplantations from the\r\nunequalled riches of our forests have mingled themselves profusely with\r\nthe elms, and ashes, and Druidical oaks of England.\r\n\r\nAmerica has made contributions to Europe far more important. Who can\r\nestimate the amount, or the value, of the augmentation of the commerce\r\nof the world that has resulted from America? Who can imagine to himself\r\nwhat would now be the shock to the Eastern Continent, if the Atlantic\r\nwere no longer traversable, or if there were no longer American\r\nproductions, or American markets?\r\n\r\nBut America exercises influences, or holds out examples, for the\r\nconsideration of the Old World, of a much higher, because they are of a\r\nmoral and political character.\r\n\r\nAmerica has furnished to Europe proof of the fact, that popular\r\ninstitutions, founded on equality and the principle of representation,\r\nare capable of maintaining governments, able to secure the rights of\r\nperson, property, and reputation.\r\n\r\nAmerica has proved that it is practicable to elevate the mass of\r\nmankind,--that portion which in Europe is called the laboring, or lower\r\nclass,--to raise them to self-respect, to make them competent to act a\r\npart in the great right and great duty of self-government; and she has\r\nproved that this may be done by education and the diffusion of\r\nknowledge. She holds out an example, a thousand times more encouraging\r\nthan ever was presented before, to those nine tenths of the human race\r\nwho are born without hereditary fortune or hereditary rank.\r\n\r\nAmerica has furnished to the world the character of Washington! And if\r\nour American institutions had done nothing else, that alone would have\r\nentitled them to the respect of mankind.\r\n\r\nWashington! \"First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of\r\nhis countrymen!\" Washington is all our own! The enthusiastic veneration\r\nand regard in which the people of the United States hold him, prove\r\nthem to be worthy of such a countryman; while his reputation abroad\r\nreflects the highest honor on his country. I would cheerfully put the\r\nquestion to-day to the intelligence of Europe and the world, what\r\ncharacter of the century, upon the whole, stands out in the relief of\r\nhistory, most pure, most respectable, most sublime; and I doubt not,\r\nthat, by a suffrage approaching to unanimity, the answer would be\r\nWashington!\r\n\r\nThe structure now standing before us, by its uprightness, its solidity,\r\nits durability, is no unfit emblem of his character. His public virtues\r\nand public principles were as firm as the earth on which it stands; his\r\npersonal motives, as pure as the serene heaven in which its summit is\r\nlost. But, indeed, though a fit, it is an inadequate emblem. Towering\r\nhigh above the column which our hands have builded, beheld, not by the\r\ninhabitants of a single city or a single State, but by all the families\r\nof man, ascends the colossal grandeur of the character and life of\r\nWashington. In all the constituents of the one, in all the acts of the\r\nother, in all its titles to immortal love, admiration, and renown, it is\r\nan American production. It is the embodiment and vindication of our\r\nTransatlantic liberty. Born upon our soil, of parents also born upon it;\r\nnever for a moment having had sight of the Old World; instructed,\r\naccording to the modes of his time, only in the spare, plain, but\r\nwholesome elementary knowledge which our institutions provide for the\r\nchildren of the people; growing up beneath and penetrated by the genuine\r\ninfluences of American society; living from infancy to manhood and age\r\namidst our expanding, but not luxurious civilization; partaking in our\r\ngreat destiny of labor, our long contest with unreclaimed nature and\r\nuncivilized man, our agony of glory, the war of Independence, our great\r\nvictory of peace, the formation of the Union, and the establishment of\r\nthe Constitution,--he is all, all our own! Washington is ours. That\r\ncrowded and glorious life,\r\n\r\n    \"Where multitudes of virtues passed along,\r\n    Each pressing foremost, in the mighty throng\r\n    Ambitious to be seen, then making room\r\n    For greater multitudes that were to come,\"--\r\n\r\nthat life was the life of an American citizen.\r\n\r\nI claim him for America. In all the perils, in every darkened moment of\r\nthe state, in the midst of the reproaches of enemies and the misgiving\r\nof friends, I turn to that transcendent name for courage and for\r\nconsolation. To him who denies or doubts whether our fervid liberty can\r\nbe combined with law, with order, with the security of property, with\r\nthe pursuits and advancement of happiness; to him who denies that our\r\nforms of government are capable of producing exaltation of soul, and the\r\npassion of true glory; to him who denies that we have contributed any\r\nthing to the stock of great lessons and great examples;--to all these I\r\nreply by pointing to Washington!\r\n\r\nAnd now, friends and fellow-citizens, it is time to bring this discourse\r\nto a close.\r\n\r\nWe have indulged in gratifying recollections of the past, in the\r\nprosperity and pleasures of the present, and in high hopes for the\r\nfuture. But let us remember that we have duties and obligations to\r\nperform, corresponding to the blessings which we enjoy. Let us remember\r\nthe trust, the sacred trust, attaching to the rich inheritance which we\r\nhave received from our fathers. Let us feel our personal responsibility,\r\nto the full extent of our power and influence, for the preservation of\r\nthe principles of civil and religious liberty. And let us remember that\r\nit is only religion, and morals, and knowledge, that can make men\r\nrespectable and happy, under any form of government. Let us hold fast\r\nthe great truth, that communities are responsible, as well as\r\nindividuals; that no government is respectable, which is not just; that\r\nwithout unspotted purity of public faith, without sacred public\r\nprinciple, fidelity, and honor, no mere forms of government, no\r\nmachinery of laws, can give dignity to political society. In our day\r\nand generation let us seek to raise and improve the moral sentiment, so\r\nthat we may look, not for a degraded, but for an elevated and improved\r\nfuture. And when both we and our children shall have been consigned to\r\nthe house appointed for all living, may love of country and pride of\r\ncountry glow with equal fervor among those to whom our names and our\r\nblood shall have descended! And then, when honored and decrepit age\r\nshall lean against the base of this monument, and troops of ingenuous\r\nyouth shall be gathered round it, and when the one shall speak to the\r\nother of its objects, the purposes of its construction, and the great\r\nand glorious events with which it is connected, there shall rise from\r\nevery youthful breast the ejaculation, \"Thank God, I--I also--AM AN\r\nAMERICAN!\"\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nPage 139.\r\n\r\nThe following description of the Bunker Hill Monument and Square is from\r\nMr. Frothingham's History of the Siege of Boston, pp. 355, 356.\r\n\r\n     \"Monument Square is four hundred and seventeen feet from north to\r\n     south, and four hundred feet from east to west, and contains nearly\r\n     six acres. It embraces the whole site of the redoubt, and a part of\r\n     the site of the breastwork. According to the most accurate plan of\r\n     the town and the battle (Page's), the monument stands where the\r\n     southwest angle of the redoubt was, and the whole of the redoubt\r\n     was between the monument and the street that bounds it on the west.\r\n     The small mound in the northeast corner of the square is supposed\r\n     to be the remains of the breastwork. Warren fell about two hundred\r\n     feet west of the monument. An iron fence encloses the square, and\r\n     another surrounds the monument. The square has entrances on each of\r\n     its sides, and at each of its corners, and is surrounded by a walk\r\n     and rows of trees.\r\n\r\n     \"The obelisk is thirty feet in diameter at the base, about fifteen\r\n     feet at the top of the truncated part, and was designed to be two\r\n     hundred and twenty feet high; but the mortar and the seams between\r\n     the stones make the precise height two hundred and twenty-one feet.\r\n     Within the shaft is a hollow cone, with a spiral stairway winding\r\n     round it to its summit, which enters a circular chamber at the top.\r\n     There are ninety courses of stone in the shaft,--six of them below\r\n     the ground, and eighty-four above the ground. The capstone, or\r\n     apex, is a single stone four feet square at the base, and three\r\n     feet six inches in height, weighing two and half tons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: William Tudor died at Rio de Janeiro, as Chargé d'Affaires\r\nof the United States, in 1830.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: William Sullivan died in Boston in 1839, George Blake in\r\n1841, both gentlemen of great political and legal eminence.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: William Prescott (since deceased, in 1844), son of Colonel\r\nWilliam Prescott, who commanded on the 17th of June, 1775, and father of\r\nWilliam H.

Sir, I deny that there is\r\nan acknowledged departure, or any departure at all, from the neutral\r\npolicy of the country. What do we mean by our neutral policy? Not, I\r\nsuppose, a blind and stupid indifference to whatever is passing around\r\nus; not a total disregard to approaching events, or approaching evils,\r\ntill they meet us full in the face. Nor do we mean, by our neutral\r\npolicy, that we intend never to assert our rights by force. No, Sir. We\r\nmean by our policy of neutrality, that the great objects of national\r\npursuit with us are connected with peace. We covet no provinces; we\r\ndesire no conquests; we entertain no ambitious projects of\r\naggrandizement by war. This is our policy. But it does not follow from\r\nthis, that we rely less than other nations on our own power to vindicate\r\nour own rights. We know that the last logic of kings is also our last\r\nlogic; that our own interests must be defended and maintained by our own\r\narm; and that peace or war may not always be of our own choosing. Our\r\nneutral policy, therefore, not only justifies, but requires, our anxious\r\nattention to the political events which take place in the world, a\r\nskilful perception of their relation to our own concerns, and an early\r\nanticipation of their consequences, and firm and timely assertion of\r\nwhat we hold to be our own rights and our own interests. Our neutrality\r\nis not a predetermined abstinence, either from remonstrances, or from\r\nforce. Our neutral policy is a policy that protects neutrality, that\r\ndefends neutrality, that takes up arms, if need be, for neutrality. When\r\nit is said, therefore, that this measure departs from our neutral\r\npolicy, either that policy, or the measure itself, is misunderstood. It\r\nimplies either that the object or the tendency of the measure is to\r\ninvolve us in the war of other states, which I think cannot be shown, or\r\nthat the assertion of our own sentiments, on points affecting deeply our\r\nown interests, may place us in a hostile attitude toward other states,\r\nand that therefore we depart from neutrality; whereas the truth is, that\r\nthe decisive assertion and the firm support of these sentiments may be\r\nmost essential to the maintenance of neutrality.\r\n\r\nAn honorable member from Pennsylvania thinks this congress will bring a\r\ndark day over the United States. Doubtless, Sir, it is an interesting\r\nmoment in our history; but I see no great proofs of thick-coming\r\ndarkness. But the object of the remark seemed to be to show that the\r\nPresident himself saw difficulties on all sides, and, making a choice of\r\nevils, preferred rather to send ministers to this congress, than to run\r\nthe risk of exciting the hostility of the states by refusing to send. In\r\nother words, the gentleman wished to prove that the President intended\r\nan alliance; although such intention is expressly disclaimed.\r\n\r\nMuch commentary has been bestowed on the letters of invitation from the\r\nministers. I shall not go through with verbal criticisms on these\r\nletters. Their general import is plain enough. I shall not gather\r\ntogether small and minute quotations, taking a sentence here, a word\r\nthere, and a syllable in a third place, dovetailing them into the course\r\nof remark, till the printed discourse bristles in every line with\r\ninverted commas. I look to the general tenor of the invitations, and I\r\nfind that we are asked to take part only in such things as concern\r\nourselves. I look still more carefully to the answers, and I see every\r\nproper caution and proper guard. I look to the message, and I see that\r\nnothing is there contemplated likely to involve us in other men's\r\nquarrels, or that may justly give offence to any foreign state. With\r\nthis I am satisfied.\r\n\r\nI must now ask the indulgence of the committee to an important point in\r\nthe discussion, I mean the declaration of the President in 1823.[1] Not\r\nonly as a member of the House, but as a citizen of the country, I have\r\nan anxious desire that this part of our public history should stand in\r\nits proper light. The country has, in my judgment, a very high honor\r\nconnected with that occurrence, which we may maintain, or which we may\r\nsacrifice. I look upon it as a part of its treasures of reputation; and,\r\nfor one, I intend to guard it.\r\n\r\nSir, let us recur to the important political events which led to that\r\ndeclaration, or accompanied it. In the fall of 1822, the allied\r\nsovereigns held their congress at Verona. The great subject of\r\nconsideration was the condition of Spain, that country then being under\r\nthe government of the Cortes. The question was, whether Ferdinand should\r\nbe reinstated in all his authority, by the intervention of foreign\r\nforce. Russia, Prussia, France, and Austria were inclined to that\r\nmeasure; England dissented and protested; but the course was agreed on,\r\nand France, with the consent of these other Continental powers, took the\r\nconduct of the operation into her own hands. In the spring of 1823, a\r\nFrench army was sent into Spain. Its success was complete. The popular\r\ngovernment was overthrown, and Ferdinand re-established in all his\r\npower. This invasion, Sir, was determined on, and undertaken, precisely\r\non the doctrines which the allied monarchs had proclaimed the year\r\nbefore, at Laybach; that is, that they had a right to interfere in the\r\nconcerns of another state, and reform its government, in order to\r\nprevent the effects of its bad example; this bad example, be it\r\nremembered, always being the example of free government. Now, Sir,\r\nacting on this principle of supposed dangerous example, and having put\r\ndown the example of the Cortes in Spain, it was natural to inquire with\r\nwhat eyes they would look on the colonies of Spain, that were following\r\nstill worse examples. Would King Ferdinand and his allies be content\r\nwith what had been done in Spain itself, or would he solicit their aid,\r\nand was it likely they would grant it, to subdue his rebellious American\r\nprovinces?\r\n\r\nSir, it was in this posture of affairs, on an occasion which has already\r\nbeen alluded to, that I ventured to say, early in the session of\r\nDecember, 1823, that these allied monarchs might possibly turn their\r\nattention to America; that America came within their avowed doctrine,\r\nand that her examples might very possibly attract their notice. The\r\ndoctrines of Laybach were not limited to any continent. Spain had\r\ncolonies in America, and having reformed Spain herself to the true\r\nstandard, it was not impossible that they might see fit to complete the\r\nwork by reconciling, in their way, the colonies to the mother country.\r\nNow, Sir, it did so happen, that, as soon as the Spanish king was\r\ncompletely re-established, he invited the co-operation of his allies in\r\nregard to South America. In the same month of December, of 1823, a\r\nformal invitation was addressed by Spain to the courts of St.\r\nPetersburg, Vienna, Berlin, and Paris, proposing to establish a\r\nconference at Paris, in order that the plenipotentiaries there assembled\r\nmight aid Spain in adjusting the affairs of her revolted provinces.\r\nThese affairs were proposed to be adjusted in such manner as should\r\nretain the sovereignty of Spain over them; and though the co-operation\r\nof the allies by force of arms was not directly solicited, such was\r\nevidently the object aimed at. The king of Spain, in making this request\r\nto the members of the Holy Alliance, argued as it has been seen he might\r\nargue. He quoted their own doctrines of Laybach; he pointed out the\r\npernicious example of America; and he reminded them that their success\r\nin Spain itself had paved the way for successful operations against the\r\nspirit of liberty on this side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe proposed meeting, however, did not take place. England had already\r\ntaken a decided course; for as early as October, Mr. Canning, in a\r\nconference with the French minister in London, informed him distinctly\r\nand expressly, that England would consider any foreign interference, by\r\nforce or by menace, in the dispute between Spain and the colonies, as a\r\nmotive for recognizing the latter without delay. It is probable this\r\ndetermination of the English government was known here at the\r\ncommencement of the session of Congress; and it was under these\r\ncircumstances, it was in this crisis, that Mr. Monroe's declaration was\r\nmade. It was not then ascertained whether a meeting of the Allies would\r\nor would not take place, to concert with Spain the means of\r\nre-establishing her power; but it was plain enough they would be pressed\r\nby Spain to aid her operations; and it was plain enough, also, that they\r\nhad no particular liking to what was taking place on this side of the\r\nAtlantic, nor any great disinclination to interfere. This was the\r\nposture of affairs; and, Sir, I concur entirely in the sentiment\r\nexpressed in the resolution of a gentleman from Pennsylvania,[2] that\r\nthis declaration of Mr. Monroe was wise, seasonable, and patriotic.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, in the course of this debate, to have been a loose and\r\nvague declaration. It was, I believe, sufficiently studied. I have\r\nunderstood, from good authority, that it was considered, weighed, and\r\ndistinctly and decidedly approved, by every one of the President's\r\nadvisers at that time. Our government could not adopt on that occasion\r\nprecisely the course which England had taken. England threatened the\r\nimmediate recognition of the provinces, if the Allies should take part\r\nwith Spain against them. We had already recognized them. It remained,\r\ntherefore, only for our government to say how we should consider a\r\ncombination of the Allied Powers, to effect objects in America, as\r\naffecting ourselves; and the message was intended to say, what it does\r\nsay, that we should regard such combination as dangerous to us. Sir, I\r\nagree with those who maintain the proposition, and I contend against\r\nthose who deny it, that the message did mean something; that it meant\r\nmuch; and I maintain, against both, that the declaration effected much\r\ngood, answered the end designed by it, did great honor to the foresight\r\nand the spirit of the government, and that it cannot now be taken back,\r\nretracted, or annulled, without disgrace. It met, Sir, with the entire\r\nconcurrence and the hearty approbation of the country. The tone which it\r\nuttered found a corresponding response in the breasts of the free people\r\nof the United States. That people saw, and they rejoiced to see, that,\r\non a fit occasion, our weight had been thrown into the right scale, and\r\nthat, without departing from our duty, we had done something useful, and\r\nsomething effectual, for the cause of civil liberty. One general glow of\r\nexultation, one universal feeling of the gratified love of liberty, one\r\nconscious and proud perception of the consideration which the country\r\npossessed, and of the respect and honor which belonged to it, pervaded\r\nall bosoms. Possibly the public enthusiasm went too far; it certainly\r\ndid go far. But, Sir, the sentiment which this declaration inspired was\r\nnot confined to ourselves. Its force was felt everywhere, by all those\r\nwho could understand its object and foresee its effect. In that very\r\nHouse of Commons of which the gentleman from South Carolina has spoken\r\nwith such commendation, how was it received? Not only, Sir, with\r\napprobation, but, I may say, with no little enthusiasm. While the\r\nleading minister[3] expressed his entire concurrence in the sentiments\r\nand opinions of the American President, his distinguished competitor[4]\r\nin that popular body, less restrained by official decorum, and more at\r\nliberty to give utterance to all the feeling of the occasion, declared\r\nthat no event had ever created greater joy, exultation, and gratitude\r\namong all the free men in Europe; that he felt pride in being connected\r\nby blood and language with the people of the United States; that the\r\npolicy disclosed by the message became a great, a free, and an\r\nindependent nation; and that he hoped his own country would be prevented\r\nby no mean pride, or paltry jealousy, from following so noble and\r\nglorious an example.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true, as I took occasion to observe the other day, that\r\nthis declaration must be considered as founded on our rights, and to\r\nspring mainly from a regard to their preservation. It did not commit us,\r\nat all events, to take up arms on any indication of hostile feeling by\r\nthe powers of Europe towards South America. If, for example, all the\r\nstates of Europe had refused to trade with South America until her\r\nstates should return to their former allegiance, that would have\r\nfurnished no cause of interference to us. Or if an armament had been\r\nfurnished by the Allies to act against provinces the most remote from\r\nus, as Chili or Buenos Ayres, the distance of the scene of action\r\ndiminishing our apprehension of danger, and diminishing also our means\r\nof effectual interposition, might still have left us to content\r\nourselves with remonstrance. But a very different case would have\r\narisen, if an army, equipped and maintained by these powers, had been\r\nlanded on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, and commenced the war in our\r\nown immediate neighborhood. Such an event might justly be regarded as\r\ndangerous to ourselves, and, on that ground, call for decided and\r\nimmediate interference by us. The sentiments and the policy announced by\r\nthe declaration, thus understood, were, therefore, in strict conformity\r\nto our duties and our interest.\r\n\r\nSir, I look on the message of December, 1823, as forming a bright page\r\nin our history. I will help neither to erase it nor tear it out; nor\r\nshall it be, by any act of mine, blurred or blotted. It did honor to the\r\nsagacity of the government, and I will not diminish that honor. It\r\nelevated the hopes, and gratified the patriotism, of the people. Over\r\nthose hopes I will not bring a mildew; nor will I put that gratified\r\npatriotism to shame.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the message of President Monroe to Congress at the\r\ncommencement of the session of 1823-24, the following passage\r\noccurs:--\"In the wars of the European powers, in matters relating to\r\nthemselves, we have never taken any part, nor does it comport with our\r\npolicy so to do. It is only when our rights are invaded, or seriously\r\nmenaced, that we resent injuries or make preparations for defence. With\r\nthe movements in this hemisphere we are of necessity more immediately\r\nconnected, and by causes which must be obvious to all enlightened and\r\nimpartial observers. The political system of the Allied Powers is\r\nessentially different, in this respect, from that of America. This\r\ndifference proceeds from that which exists in their respective\r\ngovernments. And to the defence of our own, which has been achieved by\r\nthe loss of so much blood and treasure, and matured by the wisdom of\r\ntheir most enlightened citizens, and under which we have enjoyed such\r\nunexampled felicity, this whole nation is devoted. We owe it, therefore,\r\nto candor, and to the amicable relations existing between the United\r\nStates and those powers, to declare that we should consider any attempt\r\non their part to extend their system to any portion of this hemisphere\r\nas dangerous to our peace and safety. With the existing colonies or\r\ndependencies of any European power, we have not interfered, and shall\r\nnot interfere. But with the governments who have declared their\r\nindependence and maintained it, and whose independence we have on great\r\nconsideration and on just principles acknowledged, we could not view any\r\ninterposition for the purpose of oppressing them, or controlling in any\r\nother manner their destiny, in any other light than as the manifestation\r\nof an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. Markley.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mr. Canning.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Mr. Brougham.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADAMS AND JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\nDISCOURSE IN COMMEMORATION OF THE LIVES AND SERVICES OF JOHN ADAMS AND\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON, DELIVERED IN FANEUIL HALL, BOSTON, ON THE 2D OF\r\nAUGUST, 1826.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Since the decease of General Washington, on the 14th of December, 1799,\r\nthe public mind has never been so powerfully affected in this part of\r\nthe country by any similar event, as by the death of John Adams, on the\r\n4th of July, 1826. The news reached Boston in the evening of that day.\r\nThe decease of this venerable fellow-citizen must at all times have\r\nappealed with much force to the patriotic sympathies of the people of\r\nMassachusetts. It acquired a singular interest from the year and the day\r\non which it took place;--the 4th of July of the year completing the\r\nhalf-century from that ever memorable era in the history of this country\r\nand the world, the Declaration of Independence; a measure in which Mr.\r\nAdams himself had taken so distinguished a part. The emotions of the\r\npublic were greatly increased by the indications given by Mr. Adams in\r\nhis last hours, that he was fully aware that the day was the anniversary\r\nof Independence, and by his dying allusion to the supposed fact that his\r\ncolleague, Jefferson, survived him. When, in the course of a few days,\r\nthe news arrived from Virginia, that he also had departed this life, on\r\nthe same day and a few hours before Mr. Adams, the sensibility of the\r\ncommunity, as of the country at large, was touched beyond all example.\r\nThe occurrence was justly deemed without a parallel in history. The\r\nvarious circumstances of association and coincidence which marked the\r\ncharacters and careers of these great men, and especially those of their\r\nsimultaneous decease on the 4th of July, were dwelt upon with melancholy\r\nbut untiring interest. The circles of private life, the press, public\r\nbodies, and the pulpit, were for some time almost engrossed with the\r\ntopic; and solemn rites of commemoration were performed throughout the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAn early day was appointed for this purpose by the City Council of\r\nBoston. The whole community manifested its sympathy in the extraordinary\r\nevent; and on the 2d of August, 1826, at the request of the municipal\r\nauthorities, and in the presence of an immense audience, the following\r\nDiscourse was delivered in Faneuil Hall.]\r\n\r\nThis is an unaccustomed spectacle. For the first time, fellow-citizens,\r\nbadges of mourning shroud the columns and overhang the arches of this\r\nhall. These walls, which were consecrated, so long ago, to the cause of\r\nAmerican liberty, which witnessed her infant struggles, and rung with\r\nthe shouts of her earliest victories, proclaim, now, that distinguished\r\nfriends and champions of that great cause have fallen. It is right that\r\nit should be thus. The tears which flow, and the honors that are paid,\r\nwhen the founders of the republic die, give hope that the republic\r\nitself may be immortal. It is fit that, by public assembly and solemn\r\nobservance, by anthem and by eulogy, we commemorate the services of\r\nnational benefactors, extol their virtues, and render thanks to God for\r\neminent blessings, early given and long continued, through their agency,\r\nto our favored country.\r\n\r\nADAMS and JEFFERSON are no more; and we are assembled, fellow-citizens,\r\nthe aged, the middle-aged, and the young, by the spontaneous impulse of\r\nall, under the authority of the municipal government, with the presence\r\nof the chief magistrate of the Commonwealth, and others its official\r\nrepresentatives, the University, and the learned societies, to bear our\r\npart in those manifestations of respect and gratitude which pervade the\r\nwhole land. ADAMS and JEFFERSON are no more. On our fiftieth\r\nanniversary, the great day of national jubilee, in the very hour of\r\npublic rejoicing, in the midst of echoing and re-echoing voices of\r\nthanksgiving, while their own names were on all tongues, they took their\r\nflight together to the world of spirits.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that no one can safely be pronounced happy while he lives,\r\nif that event which terminates life can alone crown its honors and its\r\nglory, what felicity is here! The great epic of their lives, how happily\r\nconcluded! Poetry itself has hardly terminated illustrious lives, and\r\nfinished the career of earthly renown, by such a consummation. If we had\r\nthe power, we could not wish to reverse this dispensation of the Divine\r\nProvidence. The great objects of life were accomplished, the drama was\r\nready to be closed. It has closed; our patriots have fallen; but so\r\nfallen, at such age, with such coincidence, on such a day, that we\r\ncannot rationally lament that that end has come, which we knew could not\r\nbe long deferred.\r\n\r\nNeither of these great men, fellow-citizens, could have died, at any\r\ntime, without leaving an immense void in our American society. They have\r\nbeen so intimately, and for so long a time, blended with the history of\r\nthe country, and especially so united, in our thoughts and\r\nrecollections, with the events of the Revolution, that the death of\r\neither would have touched the chords of public sympathy. We should have\r\nfelt that one great link, connecting us with former times, was broken;\r\nthat we had lost something more, as it were, of the presence of the\r\nRevolution itself, and of the act of independence, and were driven on,\r\nby another great remove from the days of our country's early\r\ndistinction, to meet posterity, and to mix with the future. Like the\r\nmariner, whom the currents of the ocean and the winds carry along, till\r\nhe sees the stars which have directed his course and lighted his\r\npathless way descend, one by one, beneath the rising horizon, we should\r\nhave felt that the stream of time had borne us onward till another great\r\nluminary, whose light had cheered us and whose guidance we had followed,\r\nhad sunk away from our sight.\r\n\r\nBut the concurrence of their death on the anniversary of Independence\r\nhas naturally awakened stronger emotions. Both had been Presidents, both\r\nhad lived to great age, both were early patriots, and both were\r\ndistinguished and ever honored by their immediate agency in the act of\r\nindependence. It cannot but seem striking and extraordinary, that these\r\ntwo should live to see the fiftieth year from the date of that act; that\r\nthey should complete that year; and that then, on the day which had fast\r\nlinked for ever their own fame with their country's glory, the heavens\r\nshould open to receive them both at once. As their lives themselves were\r\nthe gifts of Providence, who is not willing to recognize in their happy\r\ntermination, as well as in their long continuance, proofs that our\r\ncountry and its benefactors are objects of His care?\r\n\r\nADAMS and JEFFERSON, I have said, are no more. As human beings, indeed,\r\nthey are no more. They are no more, as in 1776, bold and fearless\r\nadvocates of independence; no more, as at subsequent periods, the head\r\nof the government; no more, as we have recently seen them, aged and\r\nvenerable objects of admiration and regard. They are no more. They are\r\ndead. But how little is there of the great and good which can die! To\r\ntheir country they yet live, and live for ever. They live in all that\r\nperpetuates the remembrance of men on earth; in the recorded proofs of\r\ntheir own great actions, in the offspring of their intellect, in the\r\ndeep-engraved lines of public gratitude, and in the respect and homage\r\nof mankind. They live in their example; and they live, emphatically, and\r\nwill live, in the influence which their lives and efforts, their\r\nprinciples and opinions, now exercise, and will continue to exercise, on\r\nthe affairs of men, not only in their own country, but throughout the\r\ncivilized world. A superior and commanding human intellect, a truly\r\ngreat man, when Heaven vouchsafes so rare a gift, is not a temporary\r\nflame, burning brightly for a while, and then giving place to returning\r\ndarkness. It is rather a spark of fervent heat, as well as radiant\r\nlight, with power to enkindle the common mass of human mind; so that\r\nwhen it glimmers in its own decay, and finally goes out in death, no\r\nnight follows, but it leaves the world all light, all on fire, from the\r\npotent contact of its own spirit. Bacon died; but the human\r\nunderstanding, roused by the touch of his miraculous wand to a\r\nperception of the true philosophy and the just mode of inquiring after\r\ntruth, has kept on its course successfully and gloriously. Newton died;\r\nyet the courses of the spheres are still known, and they yet move on by\r\nthe laws which he discovered, and in the orbits which he saw, and\r\ndescribed for them, in the infinity of space.\r\n\r\nNo two men now live, fellow-citizens, perhaps it may be doubted whether\r\nany two men have ever lived in one age, who, more than those we now\r\ncommemorate, have impressed on mankind their own sentiments in regard to\r\npolitics and government, infused their own opinions more deeply into the\r\nopinions of others, or given a more lasting direction to the current of\r\nhuman thought. Their work doth not perish with them. The tree which they\r\nassisted to plant will flourish, although they water it and protect it\r\nno longer; for it has struck its roots deep, it has sent them to the\r\nvery centre; no storm, not of force to burst the orb, can overturn it;\r\nits branches spread wide; they stretch their protecting arms broader and\r\nbroader, and its top is destined to reach the heavens. We are not\r\ndeceived. There is no delusion here. No age will come in which the\r\nAmerican Revolution will appear less than it is, one of the greatest\r\nevents in human history. No age will come in which it shall cease to be\r\nseen and felt, on either continent, that a mighty step, a great advance,\r\nnot only in American affairs, but in human affairs, was made on the 4th\r\nof July, 1776. And no age will come, we trust, so ignorant or so unjust\r\nas not to see and acknowledge the efficient agency of those we now honor\r\nin producing that momentous event.\r\n\r\nWe are not assembled, therefore, fellow-citizens, as men overwhelmed\r\nwith calamity by the sudden disruption of the ties of friendship or\r\naffection, or as in despair for the republic by the untimely blighting\r\nof its hopes. Death has not surprised us by an unseasonable blow. We\r\nhave, indeed, seen the tomb close, but it has closed only over mature\r\nyears, over long-protracted public service, over the weakness of age,\r\nand over life itself only when the ends of living had been fulfilled.\r\nThese suns, as they rose slowly and steadily, amidst clouds and storms,\r\nin their ascendant, so they have not rushed from their meridian to sink\r\nsuddenly in the west. Like the mildness, the serenity, the continuing\r\nbenignity of a summer's day, they have gone down with slow-descending,\r\ngrateful, long-lingering light; and now that they are beyond the visible\r\nmargin of the world, good omens cheer us from \"the bright track of their\r\nfiery car\"!\r\n\r\nThere were many points of similarity in the lives and fortunes of these\r\ngreat men. They belonged to the same profession, and had pursued its\r\nstudies and its practice, for unequal lengths of time indeed, but with\r\ndiligence and effect. Both were learned and able lawyers. They were\r\nnatives and inhabitants, respectively, of those two of the Colonies\r\nwhich at the Revolution were the largest and most powerful, and which\r\nnaturally had a lead in the political affairs of the times. When the\r\nColonies became in some degree united, by the assembling of a general\r\nCongress, they were brought to act together in its deliberations, not\r\nindeed at the same time, but both at early periods. Each had already\r\nmanifested his attachment to the cause of the country, as well as his\r\nability to maintain it, by printed addresses, public speeches,\r\nextensive correspondence, and whatever other mode could be adopted for\r\nthe purpose of exposing the encroachments of the British Parliament and\r\nanimating the people to a manly resistance. Both were not only decided,\r\nbut early, friends of Independence. While others yet doubted, they were\r\nresolved; where others hesitated, they pressed forward. They were both\r\nmembers of the committee for preparing the Declaration of Independence,\r\nand they constituted the sub-committee appointed by the other members to\r\nmake the draft. They left their seats in Congress, being called to other\r\npublic employments, at periods not remote from each other, although one\r\nof them returned to it afterwards for a short time. Neither of them was\r\nof the assembly of great men which formed the present Constitution, and\r\nneither was at any time a member of Congress under its provisions. Both\r\nhave been public ministers abroad, both Vice-Presidents and both\r\nPresidents of the United States. These coincidences are now singularly\r\ncrowned and completed. They have died together; and they died on the\r\nanniversary of liberty.\r\n\r\nWhen many of us were last in this place, fellow-citizens, it was on the\r\nday of that anniversary. We were met to enjoy the festivities belonging\r\nto the occasion, and to manifest our grateful homage to our political\r\nfathers. We did not, we could not here, forget our venerable neighbor of\r\nQuincy. We knew that we were standing, at a time of high and palmy\r\nprosperity, where he had stood in the hour of utmost peril; that we saw\r\nnothing but liberty and security, where he had met the frown of power;\r\nthat we were enjoying every thing, where he had hazarded every thing;\r\nand just and sincere plaudits rose to his name, from the crowds which\r\nfilled this area, and hung over these galleries. He whose grateful duty\r\nit was to speak to us,[1] on that day, of the virtues of our fathers,\r\nhad, indeed, admonished us that time and years were about to level his\r\nvenerable frame with the dust. But he bade us hope that \"the sound of a\r\nnation's joy, rushing from our cities, ringing from our valleys, echoing\r\nfrom our hills, might yet break the silence of his aged ear; that the\r\nrising blessings of grateful millions might yet visit with glad light\r\nhis decaying vision.\" Alas! that vision was then closing for ever. Alas!\r\nthe silence which was then settling on that aged ear was an everlasting\r\nsilence! For, lo! in the very moment of our festivities, his freed\r\nspirit ascended to God who gave it! Human aid and human solace terminate\r\nat the grave; or we would gladly have borne him upward, on a nation's\r\noutspread hands; we would have accompanied him, and with the blessings\r\nof millions and the prayers of millions, commended him to the Divine\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nWhile still indulging our thoughts, on the coincidence of the death of\r\nthis venerable man with the anniversary of Independence, we learn that\r\nJefferson, too, has fallen; and that these aged patriots, these\r\nillustrious fellow-laborers, have left our world together. May not such\r\nevents raise the suggestion that they are not undesigned, and that\r\nHeaven does so order things, as sometimes to attract strongly the\r\nattention and excite the thoughts of men? The occurrence has added new\r\ninterest to our anniversary, and will be remembered in all time to come.\r\n\r\nThe occasion, fellow-citizens, requires some account of the lives and\r\nservices of JOHN ADAMS and THOMAS JEFFERSON. This duty must necessarily\r\nbe performed with great brevity, and in the discharge of it I shall be\r\nobliged to confine myself, principally, to those parts of their history\r\nand character which belonged to them as public men.\r\n\r\nJOHN ADAMS was born at Quincy, then part of the ancient town of\r\nBraintree, on the 19th day of October (old style), 1735. He was a\r\ndescendant of the Puritans, his ancestors having early emigrated from\r\nEngland, and settled in Massachusetts. Discovering in childhood a strong\r\nlove of reading and of knowledge, together with marks of great strength\r\nand activity of mind, proper care was taken by his worthy father to\r\nprovide for his education. He pursued his youthful studies in Braintree,\r\nunder Mr. Marsh, a teacher whose fortune it was that Josiah Quincy, Jr.,\r\nas well as the subject of these remarks, should receive from him his\r\ninstruction in the rudiments of classical literature. Having been\r\nadmitted, in 1751, a member of Harvard College, Mr. Adams was graduated,\r\nin course, in 1755; and on the catalogue of that institution, his name,\r\nat the time of his death, was second among the living Alumni, being\r\npreceded only by that of the venerable Holyoke. With what degree of\r\nreputation he left the University is not now precisely known. We know\r\nonly that he was distinguished in a class which numbered Locke and\r\nHemmenway among its members. Choosing the law for his profession, he\r\ncommenced and prosecuted its studies at Worcester, under the direction\r\nof Samuel Putnam, a gentleman whom he has himself described as an acute\r\nman, an able and learned lawyer, and as being in large professional\r\npractice at that time. In 1758 he was admitted to the bar, and entered\r\nupon the practice of the law in Braintree. He is understood to have made\r\nhis first considerable effort, or to have attained his first signal\r\nsuccess, at Plymouth, on one of those occasions which furnish the\r\nearliest opportunity for distinction to many young men of the\r\nprofession, a jury trial, and a criminal cause. His business naturally\r\ngrew with his reputation, and his residence in the vicinity afforded the\r\nopportunity, as his growing eminence gave the power, of entering on a\r\nlarger field of practice in the capital. In 1766 he removed his\r\nresidence to Boston, still continuing his attendance on the neighboring\r\ncircuits, and not unfrequently called to remote parts of the Province.\r\nIn 1770 his professional firmness was brought to a test of some\r\nseverity, on the application of the British officers and soldiers to\r\nundertake their defence, on the trial of the indictments found against\r\nthem on account of the transactions of the memorable 5th of March. He\r\nseems to have thought, on this occasion, that a man can no more abandon\r\nthe proper duties of his profession, than he can abandon other duties.\r\nThe event proved, that, as he judged well for his own reputation, so,\r\ntoo, he judged well for the interest and permanent fame of his country.\r\nThe result of that trial proved, that, notwithstanding the high degree\r\nof excitement then existing in consequence of the measures of the\r\nBritish government, a jury of Massachusetts would not deprive the most\r\nreckless enemies, even the officers of that standing army quartered\r\namong them, which they so perfectly abhorred, of any part of that\r\nprotection which the law, in its mildest and most indulgent\r\ninterpretation, affords to persons accused of crimes.\r\n\r\nWithout following Mr. Adams's professional course further, suffice it to\r\nsay, that on the first establishment of the judicial tribunals under the\r\nauthority of the State, in 1776, he received an offer of the high and\r\nresponsible station of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of\r\nMassachusetts. But he was destined for another and a different career.\r\nFrom early life the bent of his mind was toward politics; a propensity\r\nwhich the state of the times, if it did not create, doubtless very much\r\nstrengthened. Public subjects must have occupied the thoughts and filled\r\nup the conversation in the circles in which he then moved; and the\r\ninteresting questions at that time just arising could not but seize on a\r\nmind like his, ardent, sanguine, and patriotic. A letter, fortunately\r\npreserved, written by him at Worcester, so early as the 12th of October,\r\n1755, is a proof of very comprehensive views, and uncommon depth of\r\nreflection, in a young man not yet quite twenty. In this letter he\r\npredicted the transfer of power, and the establishment of a new seat of\r\nempire in America; he predicted, also, the increase of population in the\r\nColonies; and anticipated their naval distinction, and foretold that all\r\nEurope combined could not subdue them. All this is said, not on a public\r\noccasion or for effect, but in the style of sober and friendly\r\ncorrespondence, as the result of his own thoughts. \"I sometimes retire,\"\r\nsaid he, at the close of the letter, \"and, laying things together, form\r\nsome reflections pleasing to myself. The produce of one of these\r\nreveries you have read above.\" This prognostication so early in his own\r\nlife, so early in the history of the country, of independence, of vast\r\nincrease of numbers, of naval force, of such augmented power as might\r\ndefy all Europe, is remarkable. It is more remarkable that its author\r\nshould live to see fulfilled to the letter what could have seemed to\r\nothers, at the time, but the extravagance of youthful fancy. His\r\nearliest political feelings were thus strongly American, and from this\r\nardent attachment to his native soil he never departed.\r\n\r\nWhile still living at Quincy, and at the age of twenty-four, Mr. Adams\r\nwas present, in this town, at the argument before the Supreme Court\r\nrespecting _Writs of Assistance_, and heard the celebrated and patriotic\r\nspeech of JAMES OTIS. Unquestionably, that was a masterly performance.\r\nNo flighty declamation about liberty, no superficial discussion of\r\npopular topics, it was a learned, penetrating, convincing,\r\nconstitutional argument, expressed in a strain of high and resolute\r\npatriotism. He grasped the question then pending between England and her\r\nColonies with the strength of a lion; and if he sometimes sported, it\r\nwas only because the lion himself is sometimes playful. Its success\r\nappears to have been as great as its merits, and its impression was\r\nwidely felt. Mr. Adams himself seems never to have lost the feeling it\r\nproduced, and to have entertained constantly the fullest conviction of\r\nits important effects. \"I do say,\" he observes, \"in the most solemn\r\nmanner, that Mr. Otis's Oration against Writs of Assistance breathed\r\ninto this nation the breath of life.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIn 1765 Mr. Adams laid before the public, anonymously, a series of\r\nessays, afterwards collected in a volume in London, under the title of\r\n\"A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law.\"[3] The object of this work\r\nwas to show that our New England ancestors, in consenting to exile\r\nthemselves from their native land, were actuated mainly by the desire of\r\ndelivering themselves from the power of the hierarchy, and from the\r\nmonarchical and aristocratical systems of the other continent; and to\r\nmake this truth bear with effect on the politics of the times. Its tone\r\nis uncommonly bold and animated for that period. He calls on the people,\r\nnot only to defend, but to study and understand, their rights and\r\nprivileges; urges earnestly the necessity of diffusing general\r\nknowledge; invokes the clergy and the bar, the colleges and academies,\r\nand all others who have the ability and the means to expose the\r\ninsidious designs of arbitrary power, to resist its approaches, and to\r\nbe persuaded that there is a settled design on foot to enslave all\r\nAmerica. \"Be it remembered,\" says the author, \"that liberty must, at all\r\nhazards, be supported. We have a right to it, derived from our Maker.\r\nBut if we had not, our fathers have earned and bought it for us, at the\r\nexpense of their ease, their estates, their pleasure, and their blood.\r\nAnd liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the\r\npeople, who have a right, from the frame of their nature, to knowledge,\r\nas their great Creator, who does nothing in vain, has given them\r\nunderstandings and a desire to know. But, besides this, they have a\r\nright, an indisputable unalienable, indefeasible, divine right, to that\r\nmost dreaded and envied kind of knowledge, I mean of the characters and\r\nconduct of their rulers. Rulers are no more than attorneys, agents, and\r\ntrustees for the people; and if the cause, the interest and trust, is\r\ninsidiously betrayed, or wantonly trifled away, the people have a right\r\nto revoke the authority that they themselves have deputed, and to\r\nconstitute abler and better agents, attorneys, and trustees.\"\r\n\r\nThe citizens of this town conferred on Mr. Adams his first political\r\ndistinction, and clothed him with his first political trust, by electing\r\nhim one of their representatives, in 1770. Before this time he had\r\nbecome extensively known throughout the Province, as well by the part he\r\nhad acted in relation to public affairs, as by the exercise of his\r\nprofessional ability. He was among those who took the deepest interest\r\nin the controversy with England, and, whether in or out of the\r\nlegislature, his time and talents were alike devoted to the cause. In\r\nthe years 1773 and 1774 he was chosen a Councillor by the members of the\r\nGeneral Court, but rejected by Governor Hutchinson in the former of\r\nthose years, and by Governor Gage in the latter.\r\n\r\nThe time was now at hand, however, when the affairs of the Colonies\r\nurgently demanded united counsels throughout the country. An open\r\nrupture with the parent state appeared inevitable, and it was but the\r\ndictate of prudence that those who were united by a common interest and\r\na common danger should protect that interest and guard against that\r\ndanger by united efforts. A general Congress of Delegates from all the\r\nColonies having been proposed and agreed to, the House of\r\nRepresentatives, on the 17th of June, 1774, elected James Bowdoin,\r\nThomas Cushing, Samuel Adams, John Adams, and Robert Treat Paine,\r\ndelegates from Massachusetts. This appointment was made at Salem, where\r\nthe General Court had been convened by Governor Gage, in the last hour\r\nof the existence of a House of Representatives under the Provincial\r\nCharter. While engaged in this important business, the Governor, having\r\nbeen informed of what was passing, sent his secretary with a message\r\ndissolving the General Court. The secretary, finding the door locked,\r\ndirected the messenger to go in and inform the Speaker that the\r\nsecretary was at the door with a message from the Governor. The\r\nmessenger returned, and informed the secretary that the orders of the\r\nHouse were that the doors should be kept fast; whereupon the secretary\r\nsoon after read upon the stairs a proclamation dissolving the General\r\nCourt. Thus terminated, for ever, the actual exercise of the political\r\npower of England in or over Massachusetts. The four last-named delegates\r\naccepted their appointments, and took their seats in Congress the first\r\nday of its meeting, the 5th of September, 1774, in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the first Congress are well known, and have been\r\nuniversally admired. It is in vain that we would look for superior\r\nproofs of wisdom, talent, and patriotism. Lord Chatham said, that, for\r\nhimself, he must declare that he had studied and admired the free states\r\nof antiquity, the master states of the world, but that for solidity of\r\nreasoning, force of sagacity, and wisdom of conclusion, no body of men\r\ncould stand in preference to this Congress. It is hardly inferior praise\r\nto say, that no production of that great man himself can be pronounced\r\nsuperior to several of the papers published as the proceedings of this\r\nmost able, most firm, most patriotic assembly. There is, indeed, nothing\r\nsuperior to them in the range of political disquisition. They not only\r\nembrace, illustrate, and enforce every thing which political philosophy,\r\nthe love of liberty, and the spirit of free inquiry had antecedently\r\nproduced, but they add new and striking views of their own, and apply\r\nthe whole, with irresistible force, in support of the cause which had\r\ndrawn them together.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams was a constant attendant on the deliberations of this body,\r\nand bore an active part in its important measures. He was of the\r\ncommittee to state the rights of the Colonies, and of that also which\r\nreported the Address to the King.\r\n\r\nAs it was in the Continental Congress, fellow-citizens, that those whose\r\ndeaths have given rise to this occasion were first brought together, and\r\ncalled upon to unite their industry and their ability in the service of\r\nthe country, let us now turn to the other of these distinguished men,\r\nand take a brief notice of his life up to the period when he appeared\r\nwithin the walls of Congress.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON, descended from ancestors who had been settled in\r\nVirginia for some generations, was born near the spot on which he died,\r\nin the county of Albemarle, on the 2d of April (old style), 1743. His\r\nyouthful studies were pursued in the neighborhood of his father's\r\nresidence until he was removed to the College of William and Mary, the\r\nhighest honors of which he in due time received. Having left the College\r\nwith reputation, he applied himself to the study of the law under the\r\ntuition of George Wythe, one of the highest judicial names of which that\r\nState can boast. At an early age he was elected a member of the\r\nlegislature, in which he had no sooner appeared than he distinguished\r\nhimself by knowledge, capacity, and promptitude.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson appears to have been imbued with an early love of letters\r\nand science, and to have cherished a strong disposition to pursue these\r\nobjects. To the physical sciences, especially, and to ancient classic\r\nliterature, he is understood to have had a warm attachment, and never\r\nentirely to have lost sight of them in the midst of the busiest\r\noccupations. But the times were times for action, rather than for\r\ncontemplation. The country was to be defended, and to be saved, before\r\nit could be enjoyed. Philosophic leisure and literary pursuits, and even\r\nthe objects of professional attention, were all necessarily postponed to\r\nthe urgent calls of the public service. The exigency of the country made\r\nthe same demand on Mr. Jefferson that it made on others who had the\r\nability and the disposition to serve it; and he obeyed the call;\r\nthinking and feeling in this respect with the great Roman orator: \"Quis\r\nenim est tam cupidus in perspicienda cognoscendaque rerum natura, ut, si\r\nei tractanti contemplantique res cognitione dignissimas subito sit\r\nallatum periculum discrimenque patriae, cui subvenire opitularique\r\npossit, non illa omnia relinquat atque abjiciat, etiam si dinumerare se\r\nstellas, aut metiri mundi magnitudinem posse arbitretur?\"[4]\r\n\r\nEntering with all his heart into the cause of liberty, his ability,\r\npatriotism, and power with the pen naturally drew upon him a large\r\nparticipation in the most important concerns. Wherever he was, there was\r\nfound a soul devoted to the cause, power to defend and maintain it, and\r\nwillingness to incur all its hazards. In 1774 he published a \"Summary\r\nView of the Rights of British America,\" a valuable production among\r\nthose intended to show the dangers which threatened the liberties of the\r\ncountry, and to encourage the people in their defence. In June, 1775, he\r\nwas elected a member of the Continental Congress, as successor to Peyton\r\nRandolph, who had resigned his place on account of ill health, and took\r\nhis seat in that body on the 21st of the same month.\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, without pursuing the biography of these\r\nillustrious men further, for the present, let us turn our attention to\r\nthe most prominent act of their lives, their participation in the\r\nDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\nPreparatory to the introduction of that important measure, a committee,\r\nat the head of which was Mr. Adams, had reported a resolution, which\r\nCongress adopted on the 10th of May, recommending, in substance, to all\r\nthe Colonies which had not already established governments suited to the\r\nexigencies of their affairs, _to adopt such government as would, in the\r\nopinion of the representatives of the people, best conduce to the\r\nhappiness and safety of their constituents in particular, and America in\r\ngeneral_.\r\n\r\nThis significant vote was soon followed by the direct proposition which\r\nRichard Henry Lee had the honor to submit to Congress, by resolution,\r\non the 7th day of June. The published journal does not expressly state\r\nit, but there is no doubt, I suppose, that this resolution was in the\r\nsame words, when originally submitted by Mr. Lee, as when finally\r\npassed. Having been discussed on Saturday, the 8th, and Monday, the 10th\r\nof June, this resolution was on the last-mentioned day postponed for\r\nfurther consideration to the first day of July; and at the same time it\r\nwas voted, that a committee be appointed to prepare a Declaration to the\r\neffect of the resolution. This committee was elected by ballot, on the\r\nfollowing day, and consisted of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin\r\nFranklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston.\r\n\r\nIt is usual, when committees are elected by ballot, that their members\r\nshould be arranged in order, according to the number of votes which each\r\nhas received. Mr. Jefferson, therefore, had received the highest, and\r\nMr. Adams the next highest number of votes. The difference is said to\r\nhave been but of a single vote. Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Adams, standing\r\nthus at the head of the committee, were requested by the other members\r\nto act as a subcommittee to prepare the draft; and Mr. Jefferson drew up\r\nthe paper. The original draft, as brought by him from his study, and\r\nsubmitted to the other members of the committee, with interlineations in\r\nthe handwriting of Dr. Franklin, and others in that of Mr. Adams, was in\r\nMr. Jefferson's possession at the time of his death.[5] The merit of\r\nthis paper is Mr. Jefferson's. Some changes were made in it at the\r\nsuggestion of other members of the committee, and others by Congress\r\nwhile it was under discussion. But none of them altered the tone, the\r\nframe, the arrangement, or the general character of the instrument. As a\r\ncomposition, the Declaration is Mr. Jefferson's. It is the production of\r\nhis mind, and the high honor of it belongs to him, clearly and\r\nabsolutely.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been said, as if it were a derogation from the merits\r\nof this paper, that it contains nothing new; that it only states grounds\r\nof proceeding, and presses topics of argument, which had often been\r\nstated and pressed before. But it was not the object of the Declaration\r\nto produce any thing new. It was not to invent reasons for independence,\r\nbut to state those which governed the Congress. For great and sufficient\r\ncauses, it was proposed to declare independence; and the proper business\r\nof the paper to be drawn was to set forth those causes, and justify the\r\nauthors of the measure, in any event of fortune, to the country and to\r\nposterity. The cause of American independence, moreover, was now to be\r\npresented to the world in such manner, if it might so be, as to engage\r\nits sympathy, to command its respect, to attract its admiration; and in\r\nan assembly of most able and distinguished men, THOMAS JEFFERSON had the\r\nhigh honor of being the selected advocate of this cause. To say that he\r\nperformed his great work well, would be doing him injustice. To say that\r\nhe did excellently well, admirably well, would be inadequate and halting\r\npraise. Let us rather say, that he so discharged the duty assigned him,\r\nthat all Americans may well rejoice that the work of drawing the\r\ntitle-deed of their liberties devolved upon him.\r\n\r\nWith all its merits, there are those who have thought that there was one\r\nthing in the Declaration to be regretted; and that is, the asperity and\r\napparent anger with which it speaks of the person of the king; the\r\nindustrious ability with which it accumulates and charges upon him all\r\nthe injuries which the Colonies had suffered from the mother country.\r\nPossibly some degree of injustice, now or hereafter, at home or abroad,\r\nmay be done to the character of Mr. Jefferson, if this part of the\r\nDeclaration be not placed in its proper light. Anger or resentment,\r\ncertainly much less personal reproach and invective, could not properly\r\nfind place in a composition of such high dignity, and of such lofty and\r\npermanent character.\r\n\r\nA single reflection on the original ground of dispute between England\r\nand the Colonies is sufficient to remove any unfavorable impression in\r\nthis respect.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of all the Colonies, while Colonies, admitted themselves\r\nbound by their allegiance to the king; but they disclaimed altogether\r\nthe authority of Parliament; holding themselves, in this respect, to\r\nresemble the condition of Scotland and Ireland before the respective\r\nunions of those kingdoms with England, when they acknowledged allegiance\r\nto the same king, but had each its separate legislature. The tie,\r\ntherefore, which our Revolution was to break did not subsist between us\r\nand the British Parliament, or between us and the British government in\r\nthe aggregate, but directly between us and the king himself. The\r\nColonies had never admitted themselves subject to Parliament. That was\r\nprecisely the point of the original controversy. They had uniformly\r\ndenied that Parliament had authority to make laws for them. There was,\r\ntherefore, no subjection to Parliament to be thrown off.[6] But\r\nallegiance to the king did exist, and had been uniformly acknowledged;\r\nand down to 1775 the most solemn assurances had been given that it was\r\nnot intended to break that allegiance, or to throw it off. Therefore, as\r\nthe direct object and only effect of the Declaration, according to the\r\nprinciples on which the controversy had been maintained on our part,\r\nwere to sever the tie of allegiance which bound us to the king, it was\r\nproperly and necessarily founded on acts of the crown itself, as its\r\njustifying causes. Parliament is not so much as mentioned in the whole\r\ninstrument. When odious and oppressive acts are referred to, it is done\r\nby charging the king with confederating with others \"in pretended acts\r\nof legislation\"; the object being constantly to hold the king himself\r\ndirectly responsible for those measures which were the grounds of\r\nseparation. Even the precedent of the English Revolution was not\r\noverlooked, and in this case, as well as in that, occasion was found to\r\nsay that the king had _abdicated_ the government. Consistency with the\r\nprinciples upon which resistance began, and with all the previous state\r\npapers issued by Congress, required that the Declaration should be\r\nbottomed on the misgovernment of the king; and therefore it was properly\r\nframed with that aim and to that end. The king was known, indeed, to\r\nhave acted, as in other cases, by his ministers, and with his\r\nParliament; but as our ancestors had never admitted themselves subject\r\neither to ministers or to Parliament, there were no reasons to be given\r\nfor now refusing obedience to their authority. This clear and obvious\r\nnecessity of founding the Declaration on the misconduct of the king\r\nhimself, gives to that instrument its personal application, and its\r\ncharacter of direct and pointed accusation.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration having been reported to Congress by the committee, the\r\nresolution itself was taken up and debated on the first day of July, and\r\nagain on the second, on which last day it was agreed to and adopted, in\r\nthese words:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That these united Colonies are, and of right ought to be,\r\nfree and independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance\r\nto the British crown, and that all political connection between them\r\nand the state of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus passed the main resolution, Congress proceeded to consider\r\nthe reported draught of the Declaration. It was discussed on the second,\r\nand third, and FOURTH days of the month, in committee of the whole; and\r\non the last of those days, being reported from that committee, it\r\nreceived the final approbation and sanction of Congress. It was ordered,\r\nat the same time, that copies be sent to the several States, and that it\r\nbe proclaimed at the head of the army. The Declaration thus published\r\ndid not bear the names of the members, for as yet it had not been signed\r\nby them. It was authenticated, like other papers of the Congress, by the\r\nsignatures of the President and Secretary. On the 19th of July, as\r\nappears by the secret journal, Congress \"_Resolved_, That the\r\nDeclaration, passed on the fourth, be fairly engrossed on parchment,\r\nwith the title and style of 'THE UNANIMOUS DECLARATION OF THE THIRTEEN\r\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA'; and that the same, when engrossed, be signed\r\nby every member of Congress.\" And on the SECOND DAY OF AUGUST following,\r\n\"the Declaration, being engrossed and compared at the table, was signed\r\nby the members.\" So that it happens, fellow-citizens, that we pay these\r\nhonors to their memory on the anniversary of that day (2d of August) on\r\nwhich these great men actually signed their names to the Declaration.\r\nThe Declaration was thus made, that is, it passed and was adopted as an\r\nact of Congress, on the fourth of July; it was then signed, and\r\ncertified by the President and Secretary, like other acts. The FOURTH OF\r\nJULY, therefore, is the ANNIVERSARY OF THE DECLARATION. But the\r\nsignatures of the members present were made to it, being then engrossed\r\non parchment, on the second day of August. Absent members afterwards\r\nsigned, as they came in; and indeed it bears the names of some who were\r\nnot chosen members of Congress until after the fourth of July. The\r\ninterest belonging to the subject will be sufficient, I hope, to justify\r\nthese details.[7]\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the Revolution, fellow-citizens, sat with closed doors,\r\nand no report of its debates was ever made. The discussion, therefore,\r\nwhich accompanied this great measure, has never been preserved, except\r\nin memory and by tradition. But it is, I believe, doing no injustice to\r\nothers to say, that the general opinion was, and uniformly has been,\r\nthat in debate, on the side of independence, JOHN ADAMS had no equal.\r\nThe great author of the Declaration himself has expressed that opinion\r\nuniformly and strongly. \"JOHN ADAMS,\" said he, in the hearing of him who\r\nhas now the honor to address you, \"JOHN ADAMS was our colossus on the\r\nfloor. Not graceful, not elegant, not always fluent, in his public\r\naddresses, he yet came out with a power, both of thought and of\r\nexpression, which moved us from our seats.\"\r\n\r\nFor the part which he was here to perform, Mr. Adams doubtless was\r\neminently fitted. He possessed a bold spirit, which disregarded danger,\r\nand a sanguine reliance on the goodness of the cause, and the virtues of\r\nthe people, which led him to overlook all obstacles. His character, too,\r\nhad been formed in troubled times. He had been rocked in the early\r\nstorms of the controversy, and had acquired a decision and a hardihood\r\nproportioned to the severity of the discipline which he had undergone.\r\n\r\nHe not only loved the American cause devoutly, but had studied and\r\nunderstood it. It was all familiar to him. He had tried his powers on\r\nthe questions which it involved, often and in various ways; and had\r\nbrought to their consideration whatever of argument or illustration the\r\nhistory of his own country, the history of England, or the stores of\r\nancient or of legal learning, could furnish. Every grievance enumerated\r\nin the long catalogue of the Declaration had been the subject of his\r\ndiscussion, and the object of his remonstrance and reprobation. From\r\n1760, the Colonies, the rights of the Colonies, the liberties of the\r\nColonies, and the wrongs inflicted on the Colonies, had engaged his\r\nconstant attention; and it has surprised those who have had the\r\nopportunity of witnessing it, with what full remembrance and with what\r\nprompt recollection he could refer, in his extreme old age, to every act\r\nof Parliament affecting the Colonies, distinguishing and stating their\r\nrespective titles, sections, and provisions; and to all the Colonial\r\nmemorials, remonstrances, and petitions, with whatever else belonged to\r\nthe intimate and exact history of the times from that year to 1775. It\r\nwas, in his own judgment, between these years that the American people\r\ncame to a full understanding and thorough knowledge of their rights, and\r\nto a fixed resolution of maintaining them; and bearing himself an active\r\npart in all important transactions, the controversy with England being\r\nthen in effect the business of his life, facts, dates, and particulars\r\nmade an impression which was never effaced. He was prepared, therefore,\r\nby education and discipline, as well as by natural talent and natural\r\ntemperament, for the part which he was now to act.\r\n\r\nThe eloquence of Mr. Adams resembled his general character, and formed,\r\nindeed, a part of it. It was bold, manly, and energetic; and such the\r\ncrisis required. When public bodies are to be addressed on momentous\r\noccasions, when great interests are at stake, and strong passions\r\nexcited, nothing is valuable in speech farther than as it is connected\r\nwith high intellectual and moral endowments. Clearness, force, and\r\nearnestness are the qualities which produce conviction. True eloquence,\r\nindeed, does not consist in speech. It cannot be brought from far. Labor\r\nand learning may toil for it, but they will toil in vain. Words and\r\nphrases may be marshalled in every way, but they cannot compass it. It\r\nmust exist in the man, in the subject, and in the occasion. Affected\r\npassion, intense expression, the pomp of declamation, all may aspire to\r\nit; they cannot reach it. It comes, if it come at all, like the\r\noutbreaking of a fountain from the earth, or the bursting forth of\r\nvolcanic fires, with spontaneous, original, native force. The graces\r\ntaught in the schools, the costly ornaments and studied contrivances of\r\nspeech, shock and disgust men, when their own lives, and the fate of\r\ntheir wives, their children, and their country, hang on the decision of\r\nthe hour. Then words have lost their power, rhetoric is vain, and all\r\nelaborate oratory contemptible. Even genius itself then feels rebuked\r\nand subdued, as in the presence of higher qualities. Then patriotism is\r\neloquent; then self-devotion is eloquent. The clear conception,\r\noutrunning the deductions of logic, the high purpose, the firm resolve,\r\nthe dauntless spirit, speaking on the tongue, beaming from the eye,\r\ninforming every feature, and urging the whole man onward, right onward\r\nto his object,--this, this is eloquence; or rather, it is something\r\ngreater and higher than all eloquence,--it is action, noble, sublime,\r\ngodlike action.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1776, the controversy had passed the stage of argument. An\r\nappeal had been made to force, and opposing armies were in the field.\r\nCongress, then, was to decide whether the tie which had so long bound us\r\nto the parent state was to be severed at once, and severed for ever. All\r\nthe Colonies had signified their resolution to abide by this decision,\r\nand the people looked for it with the most intense anxiety. And surely,\r\nfellow-citizens, never, never were men called to a more important\r\npolitical deliberation. If we contemplate it from the point where they\r\nthen stood, no question could be more full of interest; if we look at it\r\nnow, and judge of its importance by its effects, it appears of still\r\ngreater magnitude.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, bring before us the assembly, which was about to decide a\r\nquestion thus big with the fate of empire. Let us open their doors and\r\nlook in upon their deliberations. Let us survey the anxious and careworn\r\ncountenances, let us hear the firm-toned voices, of this band of\r\npatriots.\r\n\r\nHANCOCK presides over the solemn sitting; and one of those not yet\r\nprepared to pronounce for absolute independence is on the floor, and is\r\nurging his reasons for dissenting from the Declaration.\r\n\r\n\"Let us pause! This step, once taken, cannot be retraced. This\r\nresolution, once passed, will cut off all hope of reconciliation. If\r\nsuccess attend the arms of England, we shall then be no longer Colonies,\r\nwith charters and with privileges; these will all be forfeited by this\r\nact; and we shall be in the condition of other conquered people, at the\r\nmercy of the conquerors. For ourselves, we may be ready to run the\r\nhazard; but are we ready to carry the country to that length? Is success\r\nso probable as to justify it? Where is the military, where the naval\r\npower, by which we are to resist the whole strength of the arm of\r\nEngland,--for she will exert that strength to the utmost? Can we rely on\r\nthe constancy and perseverance of the people? or will they not act as\r\nthe people of other countries have acted, and, wearied with a long war,\r\nsubmit, in the end, to a worse oppression? While we stand on our old\r\nground, and insist on redress of grievances, we know we are right, and\r\nare not answerable for consequences. Nothing, then, can be imputed to\r\nus. But if we now change our object, carry our pretensions farther, and\r\nset up for absolute independence, we shall lose the sympathy of mankind.\r\nWe shall no longer be defending what we possess, but struggling for\r\nsomething which we never did possess, and which we have solemnly and\r\nuniformly disclaimed all intention of pursuing, from the very outset of\r\nthe troubles. Abandoning thus our old ground, of resistance only to\r\narbitrary acts of oppression, the nations will believe the whole to have\r\nbeen mere pretence, and they will look on us, not as injured, but as\r\nambitious subjects. I shudder before this responsibility. It will be on\r\nus, if, relinquishing the ground on which we have stood so long, and\r\nstood so safely, we now proclaim independence, and carry on the war for\r\nthat object, while these cities burn, these pleasant fields whiten and\r\nbleach with the bones of their owners, and these streams run blood. It\r\nwill be upon us, it will be upon us, if, failing to maintain this\r\nunseasonable and ill-judged declaration, a sterner despotism, maintained\r\nby military power, shall be established over our posterity, when we\r\nourselves, given up by an exhausted, a harassed, a misled people, shall\r\nhave expiated our rashness and atoned for our presumption on the\r\nscaffold.\"\r\n\r\nIt was for Mr. Adams to reply to arguments like these. We know his\r\nopinions, and we know his character. He would commence with his\r\naccustomed directness and earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and my\r\nheart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that in the beginning we aimed\r\nnot at independence. But there's a Divinity which shapes our ends. The\r\ninjustice of England has driven us to arms; and, blinded to her own\r\ninterest for our good, she has obstinately persisted, till independence\r\nis now within our grasp. We have but to reach forth to it, and it is\r\nours. Why, then, should we defer the Declaration? Is any man so weak as\r\nnow to hope for a reconciliation with England, which shall leave either\r\nsafety to the country and its liberties, or safety to his own life and\r\nhis own honor? Are not you, Sir, who sit in that chair,--is not he, our\r\nvenerable colleague near you,--are you not both already the proscribed\r\nand predestined objects of punishment and of vengeance? Cut off from all\r\nhope of royal clemency, what are you, what can you be, while the power\r\nof England remains, but outlaws? If we postpone independence, do we mean\r\nto carry on, or to give up, the war? Do we mean to submit to the\r\nmeasures of Parliament, Boston Port Bill and all? Do we mean to submit,\r\nand consent that we ourselves shall be ground to powder, and our country\r\nand its rights trodden down in the dust? I know we do not mean to\r\nsubmit. We never shall submit. Do we intend to violate that most solemn\r\nobligation ever entered into by men, that plighting, before God, of our\r\nsacred honor to Washington, when, putting him forth to incur the dangers\r\nof war, as well as the political hazards of the times, we promised to\r\nadhere to him, in every extremity, with our fortunes and our lives? I\r\nknow there is not a man here, who would not rather see a general\r\nconflagration sweep over the land, or an earthquake sink it, than one\r\njot or tittle of that plighted faith fall to the ground. For myself,\r\nhaving, twelve months ago, in this place, moved you, that George\r\nWashington be appointed commander of the forces raised, or to be raised,\r\nfor defence of American liberty,[8] may my right hand forget her\r\ncunning, and my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I hesitate or\r\nwaver in the support I give him.\r\n\r\n\"The war, then, must go on. We must fight it through. And if the war\r\nmust go on, why put off longer the Declaration of Independence? That\r\nmeasure will strengthen us. It will give us character abroad. The\r\nnations will then treat with us, which they never can do while we\r\nacknowledge ourselves subjects, in arms against our sovereign. Nay, I\r\nmaintain that England herself will sooner treat for peace with us on the\r\nfooting of independence, than consent, by repealing her acts, to\r\nacknowledge that her whole conduct towards us has been a course of\r\ninjustice and oppression. Her pride will be less wounded by submitting\r\nto that course of things which now predestinates our independence, than\r\nby yielding the points in controversy to her rebellious subjects. The\r\nformer she would regard as the result of fortune; the latter she would\r\nfeel as her own deep disgrace. Why, then, why then, Sir, do we not as\r\nsoon as possible change this from a civil to a national war? And since\r\nwe must fight it through, why not put ourselves in a state to enjoy all\r\nthe benefits of victory, if we gain the victory?\r\n\r\n\"If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall not fail. The cause\r\nwill raise up armies; the cause will create navies. The people, the\r\npeople, if we are true to them, will carry us, and will carry\r\nthemselves, gloriously, through this struggle. I care not how fickle\r\nother people have been found. I know the people of these Colonies, and I\r\nknow that resistance to British aggression is deep and settled in their\r\nhearts and cannot be eradicated. Every Colony, indeed, has expressed its\r\nwillingness to follow, if we but take the lead. Sir, the Declaration\r\nwill inspire the people with increased courage. Instead of a long and\r\nbloody war for the restoration of privileges, for redress of grievances,\r\nfor chartered immunities, held under a British king, set before them the\r\nglorious object of entire independeuce, and it will breathe into them\r\nanew the breath of life. Read this Declaration at the head of the army;\r\nevery sword will be drawn from its scabbard, and the solemn vow uttered,\r\nto maintain it, or to perish on the bed of honor. Publish it from the\r\npulpit; religion will approve it, and the love of religious liberty will\r\ncling round it, resolved to stand with it, or fall with it. Send it to\r\nthe public halls; proclaim it there; let them hear it who heard the\r\nfirst roar of the enemy's cannon; let them see it who saw their brothers\r\nand their sons fall on the field of Bunker Hill, and in the streets of\r\nLexington and Concord, and the very walls will cry out in its support.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I see, I see clearly,\r\nthrough this day's business. You and I, indeed, may rue it. We may not\r\nlive to the time when this Declaration shall be made good. We may die;\r\ndie colonists; die slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously and on the\r\nscaffold. Be it so. Be it so. If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my\r\ncountry shall require the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be\r\nready, at the appointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But\r\nwhile I do live, let me have a country, or at least the hope of a\r\ncountry, and that a free country.\r\n\r\n\"But whatever may be our fate, be assured, be assured that this\r\nDeclaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood; but\r\nit will stand, and it will richly compensate for both. Through the thick\r\ngloom of the present, I see the brightness of the future, as the sun in\r\nheaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day. When we are in\r\nour graves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate it with\r\nthanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires, and illuminations. On its\r\nannual return they will shed tears, copious, gushing tears, not of\r\nsubjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of\r\ngratitude, and of joy. Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come. My\r\njudgment approves this measure, and my whole heart is in it. All that I\r\nhave, and all that I am, and all that I hope, in this life, I am now\r\nready here to stake upon it; and I leave off as I begun, that live or\r\ndie, survive or perish, I am for the Declaration. It is my living\r\nsentiment, and by the blessing of God it shall be my dying sentiment,\r\nIndependence _now_, and INDEPENDENCE FOR EVER.\"[9]\r\n\r\nAnd so that day shall be honored, illustrious prophet and patriot! so\r\nthat day shall be honored, and as often as it returns, thy renown shall\r\ncome along with it, and the glory of thy life, like the day of thy\r\ndeath, shall not fail from the remembrance of men.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust, fellow-citizens, on this occasion, while we express\r\nour veneration for him who is the immediate subject of these remarks,\r\nwere we to omit a most respectful, affectionate, and grateful mention of\r\nthose other great men, his colleagues, who stood with him, and with the\r\nsame spirit, the same devotion, took part in the interesting\r\ntransaction. HANCOCK, the proscribed HANCOCK, exiled from his home by a\r\nmilitary governor, cut off by proclamation from the mercy of the\r\ncrown,--Heaven reserved for him the distinguished honor of putting this\r\ngreat question to the vote, and of writing his own name first, and most\r\nconspicuously, on that parchment which spoke defiance to the power of\r\nthe crown of England. There, too, is the name of that other proscribed\r\npatriot, SAMUEL ADAMS, a man who hungered and thirsted for the\r\nindependence of his country, who thought the Declaration halted and\r\nlingered, being himself not only ready, but eager, for it, long before\r\nit was proposed; a man of the deepest sagacity, the clearest foresight,\r\nand the profoundest judgment in men. And there is GERRY, himself among\r\nthe earliest and the foremost of the patriots, found, when the battle of\r\nLexington summoned them to common counsels, by the side of WARREN; a man\r\nwho lived to serve his country at home and abroad, and to die in the\r\nsecond place in the government. There, too, is the inflexible, the\r\nupright, the Spartan character, ROBERT TREAT PAINE. He also lived to\r\nserve his country through the struggle, and then withdrew from her\r\ncouncils, only that he might give his labors and his life to his native\r\nState, in another relation. These names, fellow-citizens, are the\r\ntreasures of the Commonwealth; and they are treasures which grow\r\nbrighter by time.\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to resume the narrative, and to finish with great\r\nbrevity the notice of the lives of those whose virtues and services we\r\nhave met to commemorate.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams remained in Congress from its first meeting till November,\r\n1777, when he was appointed Minister to France. He proceeded on that\r\nservice in the February following, embarking in the frigate Boston, from\r\nthe shore of his native town, at the foot of Mount Wollaston. The year\r\nfollowing, he was appointed commissioner to treat of peace with England.\r\nReturning to the United States, he was a delegate from Braintree in the\r\nConvention for framing the Constitution of this Commonwealth, in\r\n1780.[10] At the latter end of the same year, he again went abroad in\r\nthe diplomatic service of the country, and was employed at various\r\ncourts, and occupied with various negotiations, until 1788. The\r\nparticulars of these interesting and important services this occasion\r\ndoes not allow time to relate. In 1782 he concluded our first treaty\r\nwith Holland. His negotiations with that republic, his efforts to\r\npersuade the States-General to recognize our independence, his incessant\r\nand indefatigable exertions to represent the American cause favorably on\r\nthe Continent, and to counteract the designs of its enemies, open and\r\nsecret, and his successful undertaking to obtain loans on the credit of\r\na nation yet new and unknown, are among his most arduous, most useful,\r\nmost honorable services. It was his fortune to bear a part in the\r\nnegotiation for peace with England, and in something more than six years\r\nfrom the Declaration which he had so strenuously supported, he had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the minister plenipotentiary of the crown\r\nsubscribe his name to the instrument which declared that his \"Britannic\r\nMajesty acknowledged the United States to be free, sovereign, and\r\nindependent.\" In these important transactions, Mr. Adams's conduct\r\nreceived the marked approbation of Congress and of the country.\r\n\r\nWhile abroad, in 1787, he published his \"Defence of the American\r\nConstitutions\"; a work of merit and ability, though composed with haste,\r\non the spur of a particular occasion, in the midst of other occupations,\r\nand under circumstances not admitting of careful revision. The immediate\r\nobject of the work was to counteract the weight of opinions advanced by\r\nseveral popular European writers of that day, M. Turgot, the Abbé de\r\nMably, and Dr. Price, at a time when the people of the United States\r\nwere employed in forming and revising their systems of government.\r\n\r\nReturning to the United States in 1788, he found the new government\r\nabout going into operation, and was himself elected the first\r\nVice-President, a situation which he filled with reputation for eight\r\nyears, at the expiration of which he was raised to the Presidential\r\nchair, as immediate successor to the immortal Washington. In this high\r\nstation he was succeeded by Mr. Jefferson, after a memorable controversy\r\nbetween their respective friends, in 1801; and from that period his\r\nmanner of life has been known to all who hear me. He has lived, for\r\nfive-and-twenty years, with every enjoyment that could render old age\r\nhappy. Not inattentive to the occurrences of the times, political cares\r\nhave yet not materially, or for any long time, disturbed his repose. In\r\n1820 he acted as Elector of President and Vice-President, and in the\r\nsame year we saw him, then at the age of eighty-five, a member of the\r\nConvention of this Commonwealth called to revise the Constitution. Forty\r\nyears before, he had been one of those who formed that Constitution; and\r\nhe had now the pleasure of witnessing that there was little which the\r\npeople desired to change.[11] Possessing all his faculties to the end of\r\nhis long life, with an unabated love of reading and contemplation, in\r\nthe centre of interesting circles of friendship and affection, he was\r\nblessed in his retirement with whatever of repose and felicity the\r\ncondition of man allows. He had, also, other enjoyments. He saw around\r\nhim that prosperity and general happiness which had been the object of\r\nhis public cares and labors. No man ever beheld more clearly, and for a\r\nlonger time, the great and beneficial effects of the services rendered\r\nby himself to his country. That liberty which he so early defended, that\r\nindependence of which he was so able an advocate and supporter, he saw,\r\nwe trust, firmly and securely established. The population of the country\r\nthickened around him faster, and extended wider, than his own sanguine\r\npredictions had anticipated; and the wealth, respectability, and power\r\nof the nation sprang up to a magnitude which it is quite impossible he\r\ncould have expected to witness in his day. He lived also to behold those\r\nprinciples of civil freedom which had been developed, established, and\r\npractically applied in America, attract attention, command respect, and\r\nawaken imitation, in other regions of the globe; and well might, and\r\nwell did, he exclaim, \"Where will the consequences of the American\r\nRevolution end?\"\r\n\r\nIf any thing yet remain to fill this cup of happiness, let it be added,\r\nthat he lived to see a great and intelligent people bestow the highest\r\nhonor in their gift where he had bestowed his own kindest parental\r\naffections and lodged his fondest hopes. Thus honored in life, thus\r\nhappy at death, he saw the JUBILEE, and he died; and with the last\r\nprayers which trembled on his lips was the fervent supplication for his\r\ncountry, \"Independence for ever!\"[12]\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson, having been occupied in the years 1778 and 1779 in the\r\nimportant service of revising the laws of Virginia, was elected Governor\r\nof that State, as successor to Patrick Henry, and held the situation\r\nwhen the State was invaded by the British arms. In 1781 he published his\r\nNotes on Virginia, a work which attracted attention in Europe as well as\r\nAmerica, dispelled many misconceptions respecting this continent, and\r\ngave its author a place among men distinguished for science. In\r\nNovember, 1783, he again took his seat in the Continental Congress, but\r\nin the May following was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary, to act\r\nabroad, in the negotiation of commercial treaties, with Dr. Franklin and\r\nMr. Adams. He proceeded to France, in execution of this mission,\r\nembarking at Boston; and that was the only occasion on which he ever\r\nvisited this place. In 1785 he was appointed Minister to France, the\r\nduties of which situation he continued to perform until October, 1789,\r\nwhen he obtained leave to retire, just on the eve of that tremendous\r\nrevolution which has so much agitated the world in our times. Mr.\r\nJefferson's discharge of his diplomatic duties was marked by great\r\nability, diligence, and patriotism; and while he resided at Paris, in\r\none of the most interesting periods, his character for intelligence, his\r\nlove of knowledge and of the society of learned men, distinguished him\r\nin the highest circles of the French capital. No court in Europe had at\r\nthat time in Paris a representative commanding or enjoying higher\r\nregard, for political knowledge or for general attainments, than the\r\nminister of this then infant republic. Immediately on his return to his\r\nnative country, at the organization of the government under the present\r\nConstitution, his talents and experience recommended him to President\r\nWashington for the first office in his gift. He was placed at the head\r\nof the Department of State. In this situation, also, he manifested\r\nconspicuous ability. His correspondence with the ministers of other\r\npowers residing here, and his instructions to our own diplomatic agents\r\nabroad, are among our ablest state papers. A thorough knowledge of the\r\nlaws and usages of nations, perfect acquaintance with the immediate\r\nsubject before him, great felicity, and still greater facility, in\r\nwriting, show themselves in whatever effort his official situation\r\ncalled on him to make. It is believed by competent judges, that the\r\ndiplomatic intercourse of the government of the United States, from the\r\nfirst meeting of the Continental Congress in 1774 to the present time,\r\ntaken together, would not suffer, in respect to the talent with which it\r\nhas been conducted, by comparison with any thing which other and older\r\ngovernments can produce; and to the attainment of this respectability\r\nand distinction Mr. Jefferson has contributed his full part.\r\n\r\nOn the retirement of General Washington from the Presidency, and the\r\nelection of Mr. Adams to that office in 1797, he was chosen\r\nVice-President. While presiding in this capacity over the deliberations\r\nof the Senate, he compiled and published a Manual of Parliamentary\r\nPractice, a work of more labor and more merit than is indicated by its\r\nsize. It is now received as the general standard by which proceedings\r\nare regulated, not only in both Houses of Congress, but in most of the\r\nother legislative bodies in the country. In 1801 he was elected\r\nPresident, in opposition to Mr. Adams, and re-elected in 1805, by a vote\r\napproaching towards unanimity.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of his final retirement from public life, in 1809, Mr.\r\nJefferson lived as became a wise man. Surrounded by affectionate\r\nfriends, his ardor in the pursuit of knowledge undiminished, with\r\nuncommon health and unbroken spirits, he was able to enjoy largely the\r\nrational pleasures of life, and to partake in that public prosperity\r\nwhich he had so much contributed to produce. His kindness and\r\nhospitality, the charm of his conversation, the ease of his manners, the\r\nextent of his acquirements, and, especially, the full store of\r\nRevolutionary incidents which he had treasured in his memory, and which\r\nhe knew when and how to dispense, rendered his abode in a high degree\r\nattractive to his admiring countrymen, while his high public and\r\nscientific character drew towards him every intelligent and educated\r\ntraveller from abroad. Both Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson had the pleasure\r\nof knowing that the respect which they so largely received was not paid\r\nto their official stations. They were not men made great by office; but\r\ngreat men, on whom the country for its own benefit had conferred office.\r\nThere was that in them which office did not give, and which the\r\nrelinquishment of office did not, and could not, take away. In their\r\nretirement, in the midst of their fellow-citizens, themselves private\r\ncitizens, they enjoyed as high regard and esteem as when filling the\r\nmost important places of public trust.\r\n\r\nThere remained to Mr. Jefferson yet one other work of patriotism and\r\nbeneficence, the establishment of a university in his native State. To\r\nthis object he devoted years of incessant and anxious attention, and by\r\nthe enlightened liberality of the Legislature of Virginia, and the\r\nco-operation of other able and zealous friends, he lived to see it\r\naccomplished. May all success attend this infant seminary; and may those\r\nwho enjoy its advantages, as often as their eyes shall rest on the\r\nneighboring height, recollect what they owe to their disinterested and\r\nindefatigable benefactor; and may letters honor him who thus labored in\r\nthe cause of letters![13]\r\n\r\nThus useful, and thus respected, passed the old age of Thomas Jefferson.\r\nBut time was on its ever-ceaseless wing, and was now bringing the last\r\nhour of this illustrious man. He saw its approach with undisturbed\r\nserenity. He counted the moments as they passed, and beheld that his\r\nlast sands were falling. That day, too, was at hand which he had helped\r\nto make immortal. One wish, one hope, if it were not presumptuous, beat\r\nin his fainting breast. Could it be so, might it please God, he would\r\ndesire once more to see the sun, once more to look abroad on the scene\r\naround him, on the great day of liberty. Heaven, in its mercy, fulfilled\r\nthat prayer. He saw that sun, he enjoyed its sacred light, he thanked\r\nGod for this mercy, and bowed his aged head to the grave. \"Felix, non\r\nvitae tantum claritate, sed etiam opportunitate mortis.\"\r\n\r\nThe last public labor of Mr. Jefferson naturally suggests the expression\r\nof the high praise which is due, both to him and to Mr. Adams, for their\r\nuniform and zealous attachment to learning, and to the cause of general\r\nknowledge. Of the advantages of learning, indeed, and of literary\r\naccomplishments, their own characters were striking recommendations and\r\nillustrations. They were scholars, ripe and good scholars; widely\r\nacquainted with ancient, as well as modern literature, and not\r\naltogether uninstructed in the deeper sciences. Their acquirements,\r\ndoubtless, were different, and so were the particular objects of their\r\nliterary pursuits; as their tastes and characters, in these respects,\r\ndiffered like those of other men. Being, also, men of busy lives, with\r\ngreat objects requiring action constantly before them, their attainments\r\nin letters did not become showy or obtrusive. Yet I would hazard the\r\nopinion, that, if we could now ascertain all the causes which gave them\r\neminence and distinction in the midst of the great men with whom they\r\nacted, we should find not among the least their early acquisitions in\r\nliterature, the resources which it furnished, the promptitude and\r\nfacility which it communicated, and the wide field it opened for analogy\r\nand illustration; giving them thus, on every subject, a larger view and\r\na broader range, as well for discussion as for the government of their\r\nown conduct.\r\n\r\nLiterature sometimes disgusts, and pretension to it much oftener\r\ndisgusts, by appearing to hang loosely on the character, like something\r\nforeign or extraneous, not a part, but an ill-adjusted appendage; or by\r\nseeming to overload and weigh it down by its unsightly bulk, like the\r\nproductions of bad taste in architecture, where there is massy and\r\ncumbrous ornament without strength or solidity of column. This has\r\nexposed learning, and especially classical learning, to reproach. Men\r\nhave seen that it might exist without mental superiority, without vigor,\r\nwithout good taste, and without utility. But in such cases classical\r\nlearning has only not inspired natural talent; or, at most, it has but\r\nmade original feebleness of intellect, and natural bluntness of\r\nperception, something more conspicuous. The question, after all, if it\r\nbe a question, is, whether literature, ancient as well as modern, does\r\nnot assist a good understanding, improve natural good taste, add\r\npolished armor to native strength, and render its possessor, not only\r\nmore capable of deriving private happiness from contemplation and\r\nreflection, but more accomplished also for action in the affairs of\r\nlife, and especially for public action. Those whose memories we now\r\nhonor were learned men; but their learning was kept in its proper place,\r\nand made subservient to the uses and objects of life. They were\r\nscholars, not common nor superficial; but their scholarship was so in\r\nkeeping with their character, so blended and inwrought, that careless\r\nobservers, or bad judges, not seeing an ostentatious display of it,\r\nmight infer that it did not exist; forgetting, or not knowing, that\r\nclassical learning in men who act in conspicuous public stations,\r\nperform duties which exercise the faculty of writing, or address\r\npopular, deliberative, or judicial bodies, is often felt where it is\r\nlittle seen, and sometimes felt more effectually because it is not seen\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nBut the cause of knowledge, in a more enlarged sense, the cause of\r\ngeneral knowledge and of popular education, had no warmer friends, nor\r\nmore powerful advocates, than Mr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson. On this\r\nfoundation they knew the whole republican system rested; and this great\r\nand all-important truth they strove to impress, by all the means in\r\ntheir power. In the early publication already referred to, Mr. Adams\r\nexpresses the strong and just sentiment, that the education of the poor\r\nis more important, even to the rich themselves, than all their own\r\nriches. On this great truth, indeed, is founded that unrivalled, that\r\ninvaluable political and moral institution, our own blessing and the\r\nglory of our fathers, the New England system of free schools.\r\n\r\nAs the promotion of knowledge had been the object of their regard\r\nthrough life, so these great men made it the subject of their\r\ntestamentary bounty. Mr. Jefferson is understood to have bequeathed his\r\nlibrary to the University of Virginia, and that of Mr. Adams is bestowed\r\non the inhabitants of Quincy.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams and Mr. Jefferson, fellow-citizens, were successively\r\nPresidents of the United States. The comparative merits of their\r\nrespective administrations for a long time agitated and divided public\r\nopinion. They were rivals, each supported by numerous and powerful\r\nportions of the people, for the highest office. This contest, partly the\r\ncause and partly the consequence of the long existence of two great\r\npolitical parties in the country, is now part of the history of our\r\ngovernment. We may naturally regret that any thing should have occurred\r\nto create difference and discord between those who had acted\r\nharmoniously and efficiently in the great concerns of the Revolution.\r\nBut this is not the time, nor this the occasion, for entering into the\r\ngrounds of that difference, or for attempting to discuss the merits of\r\nthe questions which it involves. As practical questions, they were\r\ncanvassed when the measures which they regarded were acted on and\r\nadopted; and as belonging to history, the time has not come for their\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, not wonderful, that, when the Constitution of the United\r\nStates first went into operation, different opinions should be\r\nentertained as to the extent of the powers conferred by it. Here was a\r\nnatural source of diversity of sentiment. It is still less wonderful,\r\nthat that event, nearly contemporary with our government under the\r\npresent Constitution, which so entirely shocked all Europe, and\r\ndisturbed our relations with her leading powers, should be thought, by\r\ndifferent men, to have different bearings on our own prosperity; and\r\nthat the early measures adopted by the government of the United States,\r\nin consequence of this new state of things, should be seen in opposite\r\nlights. It is for the future historian, when what now remains of\r\nprejudice and misconception shall have passed away, to state these\r\ndifferent opinions, and pronounce impartial judgment. In the mean time,\r\nall good men rejoice, and well may rejoice, that the sharpest\r\ndifferences sprung out of measures which, whether right or wrong, have\r\nceased with the exigencies that gave them birth, and have left no\r\npermanent effect, either on the Constitution or on the general\r\nprosperity of the country. This remark, I am aware, may be supposed to\r\nhave its exception in one measure, the alteration of the Constitution as\r\nto the mode of choosing President; but it is true in its general\r\napplication. Thus the course of policy pursued towards France in 1798,\r\non the one hand, and the measures of commercial restriction commenced in\r\n1807, on the other, both subjects of warm and severe opposition, have\r\npassed away and left nothing behind them. They were temporary, and,\r\nwhether wise or unwise, their consequences were limited to their\r\nrespective occasions. It is equally clear, at the same time, and it is\r\nequally gratifying, that those measures of both administrations which\r\nwere of durable importance, and which drew after them momentous and long\r\nremaining consequences, have received general approbation. Such was the\r\norganization, or rather the creation, of the navy, in the administration\r\nof Mr. Adams; such the acquisition of Louisiana in that of Mr.\r\nJefferson. The country, it may safely be added, is not likely to be\r\nwilling either to approve, or to reprobate, indiscriminately, and in the\r\naggregate, all the measures of either, or of any, administration. The\r\ndictate of reason and of justice is, that, holding each one his own\r\nsentiments on the points of difference, we imitate the great men\r\nthemselves in the forbearance and moderation which they have cherished,\r\nand in the mutual respect and kindness which they have been so much\r\ninclined to feel and to reciprocate.\r\n\r\nNo men, fellow-citizens, ever served their country with more entire\r\nexemption from every imputation of selfish and mercenary motives, than\r\nthose to whose memory we are paying these proofs of respect. A suspicion\r\nof any disposition to enrich themselves or to profit by their public\r\nemployments, never rested on either. No sordid motive approached them.\r\nThe inheritance which they have left to their children is of their\r\ncharacter and their fame.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, I will detain you no longer by this faint and feeble\r\ntribute to the memory of the illustrious dead. Even in other hands,\r\nadequate justice could not be done to them, within the limits of this\r\noccasion. Their highest, their best praise, is your deep conviction of\r\ntheir merits, your affectionate gratitude for their labors and their\r\nservices. It is not my voice, it is this cessation of ordinary pursuits,\r\nthis arresting of all attention, these solemn ceremonies, and this\r\ncrowded house, which speak their eulogy. Their fame, indeed, is safe.\r\nThat is now treasured up beyond the reach of accident. Although no\r\nsculptured marble should rise to their memory, nor engraved stone bear\r\nrecord of their deeds, yet will their remembrance be as lasting as the\r\nland they honored. Marble columns may, indeed, moulder into dust, time\r\nmay erase all impress from the crumbling stone, but their fame remains;\r\nfor with AMERICAN LIBERTY it rose, and with AMERICAN LIBERTY ONLY can it\r\nperish. It was the last swelling peal of yonder choir, \"THEIR BODIES ARE\r\nBURIED IN PEACE, BUT THEIR NAME LIVETH EVERMORE.\" I catch that solemn\r\nsong, I echo that lofty strain of funeral triumph, \"THEIR NAME LIVETH\r\nEVERMORE.\"\r\n\r\nOf the illustrious signers of the Declaration of Independence there now\r\nremains only CHARLES CARROLL. He seems an aged oak, standing alone on\r\nthe plain, which time has spared a little longer after all its\r\ncontemporaries have been levelled with the dust. Venerable object! we\r\ndelight to gather round its trunk, while yet it stands, and to dwell\r\nbeneath its shadow. Sole survivor of an assembly of as great men as the\r\nworld has witnessed, in a transaction one of the most important that\r\nhistory records, what thoughts, what interesting reflections, must fill\r\nhis elevated and devout soul! If he dwell on the past, how touching its\r\nrecollections; if he survey the present, how happy, how joyous, how full\r\nof the fruition of that hope which his ardent patriotism indulged; if he\r\nglance at the future, how does the prospect of his country's advancement\r\nalmost bewilder his weakened conception! Fortunate, distinguished\r\npatriot! Interesting relic of the past! Let him know that, while we\r\nhonor the dead, we do not forget the living; and that there is not a\r\nheart here which does not fervently pray that Heaven may keep him yet\r\nback from the society of his companions.\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, let us not retire from this occasion without a\r\ndeep and solemn conviction of the duties which have devolved upon us.\r\nThis lovely land, this glorious liberty, these benign institutions, the\r\ndear purchase of our fathers, are ours; ours to enjoy, ours to preserve,\r\nours to transmit. Generations past and generations to come hold us\r\nresponsible for this sacred trust. Our fathers, from behind, admonish\r\nus, with their anxious paternal voices; posterity calls out to us, from\r\nthe bosom of the future; the world turns hither its solicitous eyes;\r\nall, all conjure us to act wisely, and faithfully, in the relation which\r\nwe sustain. We can never, indeed, pay the debt which is upon us; but by\r\nvirtue, by morality, by religion, by the cultivation of every good\r\nprinciple and every good habit, we may hope to enjoy the blessing,\r\nthrough our day, and to leave it unimpaired to our children. Let us feel\r\ndeeply how much of what we are and of what we possess we owe to this\r\nliberty, and to these institutions of government. Nature has, indeed,\r\ngiven us a soil which yields bounteously to the hand of industry, the\r\nmighty and fruitful ocean is before us, and the skies over our heads\r\nshed health and vigor. But what are lands, and seas, and skies, to\r\ncivilized man, without society, without knowledge, without morals,\r\nwithout religious culture; and how can these be enjoyed, in all their\r\nextent and all their excellence, but under the protection of wise\r\ninstitutions and a free government? Fellow-citizens, there is not one of\r\nus, there is not one of us here present, who does not, at this moment,\r\nand at every moment, experience, in his own condition, and in the\r\ncondition of those most near and dear to him, the influence and the\r\nbenefits of this liberty and these institutions. Let us then\r\nacknowledge the blessing, let us feel it deeply and powerfully, let us\r\ncherish a strong affection for it, and resolve to maintain and\r\nperpetuate it. The blood of our fathers, let it not have been shed in\r\nvain; the great hope of posterity, let it not be blasted.\r\n\r\nThe striking attitude, too, in which we stand to the world around us, a\r\ntopic to which, I fear, I advert too often, and dwell on too long,\r\ncannot be altogether omitted here. Neither individuals nor nations can\r\nperform their part well, until they understand and feel its importance,\r\nand comprehend and justly appreciate all the duties belonging to it. It\r\nis not to inflate national vanity, nor to swell a light and empty\r\nfeeling of self-importance, but it is that we may judge justly of our\r\nsituation, and of our own duties, that I earnestly urge upon you this\r\nconsideration of our position and our character among the nations of the\r\nearth. It cannot be denied, but by those who would dispute against the\r\nsun, that with America, and in America, a new era commences in human\r\naffairs. This era is distinguished by free representative governments,\r\nby entire religious liberty, by improved systems of national\r\nintercourse, by a newly awakened and an unconquerable spirit of free\r\ninquiry, and by a diffusion of knowledge through the community, such as\r\nhas been before altogether unknown and unheard of. America, America, our\r\ncountry, fellow-citizens, our own dear and native land, is inseparably\r\nconnected, fast bound up, in fortune and by fate, with these great\r\ninterests. If they fall, we fall with them; if they stand, it will be\r\nbecause we have maintained them. Let us contemplate, then, this\r\nconnection, which binds the prosperity of others to our own; and let us\r\nmanfully discharge all the duties which it imposes. If we cherish the\r\nvirtues and the principles of our fathers, Heaven will assist us to\r\ncarry on the work of human liberty and human happiness. Auspicious omens\r\ncheer us. Great examples are before us. Our own firmament now shines\r\nbrightly upon our path. WASHINGTON is in the clear, upper sky. These\r\nother stars have now joined the American constellation; they circle\r\nround their centre, and the heavens beam with new light. Beneath this\r\nillumination let us walk the course of life, and at its close devoutly\r\ncommend our beloved country, the common parent of us all, to the Divine\r\nBenignity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nPage 170.\r\n\r\nThe question has often been asked, whether the anonymous speech against\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, and the speech in support of it\r\nascribed to John Adams in the preceding Discourse, are a portion of the\r\ndebates which actually took place in 1776 in the Continental Congress.\r\nNot only has this inquiry been propounded in the public papers, but\r\nseveral letters on the subject have been addressed to Mr. Webster and\r\nhis friends. For this reason, it may be proper to state, that those\r\nspeeches were composed by Mr. Webster, after the manner of the ancient\r\nhistorians, as embodying in an impressive form the arguments relied upon\r\nby the friends and opponents of the measure, respectively. They of\r\ncourse represent the speeches that were actually made on both sides, but\r\nno report of the debates of this period has been preserved, and the\r\norator on the present occasion had no aid in framing these addresses,\r\nbut what was furnished by general tradition and the known line of\r\nargument pursued by the speakers and writers of that day for and against\r\nthe measure of Independence. The first sentence of the speech ascribed\r\nto Mr. Adams was of course suggested by the parting scene with Jonathan\r\nSewall, as described by Mr. Adams himself, in the Preface to the Letters\r\nof Novanglus and Massachusettensis.\r\n\r\nSo much interest has been taken in this subject, that it has been\r\nthought proper, by way of settling the question in the most authentic\r\nmanner, to give publicity to the following answer, written by Mr.\r\nWebster to one of the letters of inquiry above alluded to.\r\n\r\n\"_Washington, 22 January, 1846._\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--\r\n\r\n\"I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th\r\ninstant. Its contents hardly surprise me, as I have received very many\r\nsimilar communications.\r\n\r\n\"Your inquiry is easily answered. The Congress of the Revolution sat\r\nwith closed doors. Its proceedings were made known to the public from\r\ntime to time, by printing its journal; but the debates were not\r\npublished. So far as I know, there is not existing, in print or\r\nmanuscript, the speech, or any part or fragment of the speech, delivered\r\nby Mr. Adams on the question of the Declaration of Independence. We only\r\nknow, from the testimony of his auditors, that he spoke with remarkable\r\nability and characteristic earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"The day after the Declaration was made, Mr. Adams, in writing to a\r\nfriend,[14] declared the event to be one that 'ought to be commemorated,\r\nas the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.\r\nIt ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games,\r\nsports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this\r\ncontinent to the other, from this time forward, for evermore.'\r\n\r\n\"And on the day of his death, hearing the noise of bells and cannon, he\r\nasked the occasion. On being reminded that it was 'Independent day,' he\r\nreplied, 'Independence for ever!' These expressions were introduced into\r\nthe speech _supposed_ to have been made by him. For the rest I must be\r\nanswerable. The speech was written by me, in my house in Boston, the day\r\nbefore the delivery of the Discourse in Faneuil Hall; a poor substitute,\r\nI am sure it would appear to be, if we could now see the speech actually\r\nmade by Mr. Adams on that transcendently important occasion.\r\n\r\n\"I am, respectfully,\r\n\r\n\"Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n\"DANIEL WEBSTER.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Hon.

The plaintiff below declared upon certain bills of\r\nexchange, drawn on the 30th of September, 1806, by one Jordan, at\r\nLexington, in the State of Kentucky, upon the defendant below, Ogden, in\r\nthe city of New York, (the defendant then being a citizen and resident\r\nof the State of New York,) accepted by him at the city of New York, and\r\nprotested for non-payment.\r\n\r\nThe defendant below pleaded several pleas, among which was a certificate\r\nof discharge under the act of the legislature of the State of New York,\r\nof April 3d, 1801, for the relief of insolvent debtors, commonly called\r\nthe Three-Fourths Act.\r\n\r\nThe jury found the facts in the form of a special verdict, on which the\r\ncourt rendered a judgment for the plaintiff below, and the cause was\r\nbrought by writ of error before this court. The question which arose\r\nunder this plea, as to the validity of the law of New York as being\r\nrepugnant to the Constitution of the United States, was argued at\r\nFebruary term, 1824, by Mr. Clay, Mr. D.B. Ogden, and Mr. Haines, for\r\nthe plaintiff in error, and by Mr. Webster and Mr. Wheaton, for the\r\ndefendant in error, and the cause was continued for advisement until the\r\npresent term. It was again argued at the present term, by Mr. Webster\r\nand Mr. Wheaton, against the validity, and by the Attorney-General, Mr.\r\nE. Livingston, Mr. D.B. Ogden, Mr. Jones, and Mr. Sampson, for the\r\nvalidity.\r\n\r\nMr. Wheaton opened the argument for the defendant in error; he was\r\nfollowed by the counsel for the plaintiff in error; and Mr. Webster\r\nreplied as follows.]\r\n\r\nThe question arising in this case is not more important, nor so\r\nimportant even, in its bearing on individual cases of private right, as\r\nin its character of a public political question. The Constitution was\r\nintended to accomplish a great political object. Its design was not so\r\nmuch to prevent injustice or injury in one case, or in successive single\r\ncases, as it was to make general salutary provisions, which, in their\r\noperation, should give security to all contracts, stability to credit,\r\nuniformity among all the States in those things which materially concern\r\nthe foreign commerce of the country, and their own credit, trade, and\r\nintercourse with each other. The real question, is, therefore, a much\r\nbroader one than has been argued. It is this: Whether the Constitution\r\nhas not, for general political purposes, ordained that bankrupt laws\r\nshould be established only by national authority? We contend that such\r\nwas the intention of the Constitution; an intention, as we think,\r\nplainly manifested in several of its provisions.\r\n\r\nThe act of New York, under which this question arises, provides that a\r\ndebtor may be discharged from all his debts, upon assigning his property\r\nto trustees for the use of his creditors. When applied to the discharge\r\nof debts contracted before the date of the law, this court has decided\r\nthat the act is invalid.[1] The act itself makes no distinction between\r\npast and future debts, but provides for the discharge of both in the\r\nsame manner. In the case, then, of a debt already existing, it is\r\nadmitted that the act does impair the obligation of contracts. We wish\r\nthe full extent of this decision to be well considered. It is not merely\r\nthat the legislature of the State cannot interfere by law, in the\r\nparticular case of A or B, to injure or impair rights which have become\r\nvested under contracts; but it is, that they have no power by general\r\nlaw to regulate the manner in which all debtors may be discharged from\r\nsubsisting contracts; in other wrords, they cannot pass general bankrupt\r\nlaws to be applied _in presenti_. Now, it is not contended that such\r\nlaws are unjust, and ought not to be passed by any legislature. It is\r\nnot said that they are unwise or impolitic. On the contrary, we know the\r\ngeneral practice to be, that, when bankrupt laws are established, they\r\nmake no distinction between present and future debts. While all agree\r\nthat special acts, made for individual cases, are unjust, all admit that\r\na general law, made for all cases, may be both just and politic. The\r\nquestion, then, which meets us on the threshold is this: If the\r\nConstitution meant to leave the States the power of establishing systems\r\nof bankruptcy to act upon future debts, what great or important object\r\nof a political nature is answered by denying the power of making such\r\nsystems applicable to existing debts?\r\n\r\nThe argument used in _Sturges v. Crowninshield_ was, at least, a\r\nplausible and consistent argument. It maintained that the prohibition of\r\nthe Constitution was levelled only against interferences in individual\r\ncases, and did not apply to general laws, whether those laws were\r\nretrospective or prospective in their operation. But the court rejected\r\nthat conclusion. It decided that the Constitution was intended to apply\r\nto general laws or systems of bankruptcy; that an act providing that all\r\ndebtors might be discharged from all creditors, upon certain conditions,\r\nwas of no more validity than an act providing that a particular debtor,\r\nA, should be discharged on the same conditions from his particular\r\ncreditor, B.\r\n\r\nIt being thus decided that general laws are within the prohibition of\r\nthe Constitution, it is for the plaintiff in error now to show on what\r\nground, consistent with the general objects of the Constitution, he can\r\nestablish a distinction which can give effect to those general laws in\r\ntheir application to future debts, while it denies them effect in their\r\napplication to subsisting debts. The words are, that \"no State shall\r\npass any law impairing the obligation of contracts.\" The general\r\noperation of all such laws is to impair that obligation; that is, to\r\ndischarge the obligation without fulfilling it. This is admitted; and\r\nthe only ground taken for the distinction to stand on is, that, when the\r\nlaw was in existence at the time of the making of the contract, the\r\nparties must be supposed to have reference to it, or, as it is usually\r\nexpressed, the law is made a part of the contract. Before considering\r\nwhat foundation there is for this argument, it may be well to inquire\r\nwhat is that obligation of contracts of which the Constitution speaks,\r\nand whence is it derived.\r\n\r\nThe definition given by the court in _Sturges v. Crowninshield_ is\r\nsufficient for our present purpose. \"A contract,\" say the court, \"is an\r\nagreement to do some particular thing; the law binds the party to\r\nperform this agreement, and this is the obligation of the contract.\"\r\n\r\nIt is indeed probable that the Constitution used the words in a somewhat\r\nmore popular sense. We speak, for example, familiarly of a usurious\r\ncontract, and yet we say, speaking technically, that a usurious\r\nagreement is no contract.\r\n\r\nBy the obligation of a contract, we should understand the Constitution\r\nto mean, the duty of performing a legal agreement. If the contract be\r\nlawful, the party is bound to perform it. But bound by what? What is it\r\nthat binds him? And this leads us to what we regard as a principal\r\nfallacy in the argument on the other side. That argument supposes, and\r\ninsists, that the whole obligation of a contract has its origin in the\r\nmunicipal law. This position we controvert. We do not say that it is\r\nthat obligation which springs from conscience merely; but we deny that\r\nit is only such as springs from the particular law of the place where\r\nthe contract is made. It must be a lawful contract, doubtless; that is,\r\npermitted and allowed; because society has a right to prohibit all such\r\ncontracts, as well as all such actions, as it deems to be mischievous or\r\ninjurious. But if the contract be such as the law of society tolerates,\r\nin other words, if it be lawful, then we say, the duty of performing it\r\nsprings from universal law. And this is the concurrent sense of all the\r\nwriters of authority.\r\n\r\nThe duty of performing promises is thus shown to rest on universal law;\r\nand if, departing from this well-established principle, we now follow\r\nthe teachers who instruct us that the obligation of a contract has its\r\norigin in the law of a particular State, and is in all cases what that\r\nlaw makes it, and no more, and no less, we shall probably find ourselves\r\ninvolved in inextricable difficulties. A man promises, for a valuable\r\nconsideration, to pay money in New York. Is the obligation of that\r\ncontract created by the laws of that State, or does it subsist\r\nindependent of those laws? We contend that the obligation of a contract,\r\nthat is, the duty of performing it, is not created by the law of the\r\nparticular place where it is made, and dependent on that law for its\r\nexistence; but that it may subsist, and does subsist, without that law,\r\nand independent of it. The obligation is in the contract itself, in the\r\nassent of the parties, and in the sanction of universal law. This is the\r\ndoctrine of Grotius, Vattel, Burlamaqui, Pothier, and Rutherforth. The\r\ncontract, doubtless, is necessarily to be enforced by the municipal law\r\nof the place where performance is demanded. The municipal law acts on\r\nthe contract after it is made, to compel its execution, or give damages\r\nfor its violation. But this is a very different thing from the same law\r\nbeing the origin or fountain of the contract.\r\n\r\nLet us illustrate this matter by an example. Two persons contract\r\ntogether in New York for the delivery, by one to the other, of a\r\ndomestic animal, a utensil of husbandry, or a weapon of war. This is a\r\nlawful contract, and, while the parties remain in New York, it is to be\r\nenforced by the laws of that State. But if they remove with the article\r\nto Pennsylvania or Maryland, there a new law comes to act upon the\r\ncontract, and to apply other remedies if it be broken. Thus far the\r\nremedies are furnished by the laws of society. But suppose the same\r\nparties to go together to a savage wilderness, or a desert island,\r\nbeyond the reach of the laws of any society. The obligation of the\r\ncontract still subsists, and is as perfect as ever, and is now to be\r\nenforced by another law, that is, the law of nature; and the party to\r\nwhom the promise was made has a right to take by force the animal, the\r\nutensil, or the weapon that was promised him. The right is as perfect\r\nhere as it was in Pennsylvania, or even in New York; but this could not\r\nbe so if the obligation were created by the law of New York, or were\r\ndependent on that law for its existence, because the laws of that State\r\ncan have no operation beyond its territory. Let us reverse this example.\r\nSuppose a contract to be made between two persons cast ashore on an\r\nuninhabited territory, or in a place over which no law of society\r\nextends. There are such places, and contracts have been made by\r\nindividuals casually there, and these contracts have been enforced in\r\ncourts of law in civilized communities. Whence do such contracts derive\r\ntheir obligation, if not from universal law?\r\n\r\nIf these considerations show us that the obligation of a lawful contract\r\ndoes not derive its force from the particular law of the place where\r\nmade, but may exist where that law does not exist, and be enforced\r\nwhere that law has no validity, then it follows, we contend, that any\r\nstatute which diminishes or lessens its obligation does impair it,\r\nwhether it precedes or succeeds the contract in date. The contract\r\nhaving an independent origin, whenever the law comes to exist together\r\nwith it, and interferes with it, it lessens, we say, and impairs, its\r\nown original and independent obligation. In the case before the court,\r\nthe contract did not owe its existence to the particular law of New\r\nYork; it did not depend on that law, but could be enforced without the\r\nterritory of that State, as well as within it. Nevertheless, though\r\nlegal, though thus independently existing, though thus binding the party\r\neverywhere, and capable of being enforced everywhere, yet the statute of\r\nNew York says that it shall be discharged without payment. This, we say,\r\nimpairs the obligation of that contract. It is admitted to have been\r\nlegal in its inception, legal in its full extent, and capable of being\r\nenforced by other tribunals according to its terms. An act, then,\r\npurporting to discharge it without payment, is, as we contend, an act\r\nimpairing its obligation.\r\n\r\nHere, however, we meet the opposite argument, stated on different\r\noccasions in different terms, but usually summed up in this, that the\r\nlaw itself is a part of the contract, and therefore cannot impair it.\r\nWhat does this mean? Let us seek for clear ideas. It does not mean that\r\nthe law gives any particular construction to the terms of the contract,\r\nor that it makes the promise, or the consideration, or the time of\r\nperformance, other than is expressed in the instrument itself. It can\r\nonly mean, that it is to be taken as a part of the contract, or\r\nunderstanding of the parties, that the contract itself shall be enforced\r\nby such laws and regulations, respecting remedy and for the enforcement\r\nof contracts, as are in being in the State where it is made at the time\r\nof entering into it. This is meant, or nothing very clearly intelligible\r\nis meant, by saying the law is part of the contract.\r\n\r\nThere is no authority in adjudged cases for the plaintiff in error but\r\nthe State decisions which have been cited, and, as has already been\r\nstated, they all rest on this reason, that the law is part of the\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nAgainst this we contend,--\r\n\r\n1st. That, if the proposition were true, the consequence would not\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n2d. That the proposition itself cannot be maintained.\r\n\r\n1. If it were true that the law is to be considered as part of the\r\ncontract, the consequence contended for would not follow; because, if\r\nthis statute be part of the contract, so is every other legal or\r\nconstitutional provision existing at the time which affects the\r\ncontract, or which is capable of affecting it; and especially this very\r\narticle of the Constitution of the United States is part of the\r\ncontract. The plaintiff in error argues in a complete circle. He\r\nsupposes the parties to have had reference to it because it was a\r\nbinding law, and yet he proves it to be a binding law only upon the\r\nground that such reference was made to it. We come before the court\r\nalleging the law to be void, as unconstitutional; they stop the inquiry\r\nby opposing to us the law itself. Is this logical? Is it not precisely\r\n_objectio ejus, cujus dissolutio petitur_? If one bring a bill to set\r\naside a judgment, is that judgment itself a good plea in bar to the\r\nbill? We propose to inquire if this law is of force to control our\r\ncontract, or whether, by the Constitution of the United States, such\r\nforce be not denied to it. The plaintiff in error stops us by saying\r\nthat it does control the contract, and so arrives shortly at the end of\r\nthe debate. Is it not obvious, that, supposing the act of New York to be\r\na part of the contract, the question still remains as undecided as ever.\r\nWhat is that act? Is it a law, or is it a nullity? a thing of force, or\r\na thing of no force? Suppose the parties to have contemplated this act,\r\nwhat did they contemplate? its words only, or its legal effect? its\r\nwords, or the force which the Constitution of the United States allows\r\nto it? If the parties contemplated any law, they contemplated all the\r\nlaw that bore on their contract, the aggregate of all the statute and\r\nconstitutional provisions. To suppose that they had in view one statute\r\nwithout regarding others, or that they contemplated a statute without\r\nconsidering that paramount constitutional provisions might control or\r\nqualify that statute, or abrogate it altogether, is unreasonable and\r\ninadmissible. \"This contract,\" says one of the authorities relied on,\r\n\"is to be construed as if the law were specially recited in it.\" Let it\r\nbe so for the sake of argument. But it is also to be construed as if the\r\nprohibitory clause of the Constitution were recited in it, and this\r\nbrings us back again to the precise point from which we departed.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution always accompanies the law, and the latter can have no\r\nforce which the former does not allow to it. If the reasoning were\r\nthrown into the form of special pleading, it would stand thus: the\r\nplaintiff declares on his debt; the defendant pleads his discharge under\r\nthe law; the plaintiff alleges the law unconstitutional; but the\r\ndefendant says, You knew of its existence; to which the answer is\r\nobvious and irresistible, I knew its existence on the statute-book of\r\nNew York, but I knew, at the same time, it was null and void under the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe language of another leading decision is, \"A law in force at the time\r\nof making the contract does not violate that contract\"; but the very\r\nquestion is, whether there be any such law \"in force\"; for if the States\r\nhave no authority to pass such laws, then no such law can be in force.\r\nThe Constitution is a part of the contract as much as the law, and was\r\nas much in the contemplation of the parties. So that the proposition, if\r\nit be admitted that the law is part of the contract, leaves us just\r\nwhere it found us: that is to say, under the necessity of comparing the\r\nlaw with the Constitution, and of deciding by such comparison whether it\r\nbe valid or invalid. If the law be unconstitutional, it is void, and no\r\nparty can be supposed to have had reference to a void law. If it be\r\nconstitutional, no reference to it need be supposed.\r\n\r\n2. But the proposition itself cannot be maintained. The law is no part\r\nof the contract. What part is it? the promise? the consideration? the\r\ncondition? Clearly, it is neither of these. It is no term of the\r\ncontract. It acts upon the contract only when it is broken, or to\r\ndischarge the party from its obligation after it is broken. The\r\nmunicipal law is the force of society employed to compel the performance\r\nof contracts. In every judgment in a suit on contract, the damages are\r\ngiven, and the imprisonment of the person or sale of goods awarded, not\r\nin performance of the contract, or as part of the contract, but as an\r\nindemnity for the breach of the contract. Even interest, which is a\r\nstrong case, where it is not expressed in the contract itself, can only\r\nbe given as damages. It is all but absurd to say that a man's goods are\r\nsold on a _fieri facias_, or that he himself goes to jail, in pursuance\r\nof his contract. These are the penalties which the law inflicts for the\r\nbreach of his contract. Doubtless, parties, when they enter into\r\ncontracts, may well consider both what their rights and what their\r\nliabilities will be by the law, if such contracts be broken; but this\r\ncontemplation of consequences which can ensue only when the contract is\r\nbroken, is no part of the contract itself. The law has nothing to do\r\nwith the contract till it be broken; how, then, can it be said to form a\r\npart of the contract itself?\r\n\r\nBut there are other cogent and more specific reasons against considering\r\nthe law as part of the contract. (1.) If the law be part of the\r\ncontract, it cannot be repealed or altered; because, in such case, the\r\nrepealing or modifying law itself would impair the obligation of the\r\ncontract. The insolvent law of New York, for example, authorizes the\r\ndischarge of a debtor on the consent of two thirds of his creditors. A\r\nsubsequent act requires the consent of three fourths; but if the\r\nexisting law be part of the contract, this latter law would be void. In\r\nshort, nothing which is part of the contract can be varied but by\r\nconsent of the parties; therefore the argument runs _in absurdum_; for\r\nit proves that no laws for enforcing the contract, or giving remedies\r\nupon it, or any way affecting it, can be changed or modified between its\r\ncreation and its end. If the law in question binds one party on the\r\nground of assent to it, it binds both, and binds them until they agree\r\nto terminate its operation. (2.) If the party be bound by an implied\r\nassent to the law, as thereby making the law a part of the contract, how\r\nwould it be if the parties had expressly dissented, and agreed that the\r\nlaw should make no part of the contract? Suppose the promise to have\r\nbeen, that the promisor would pay at all events, and not take advantage\r\nof the statute; still, would not the statute operate on the whole,--on\r\nthis particular agreement and all? and does not this show that the law\r\nis no part of the contract, but something above it? (3.) If the law of\r\nthe place be part of the contract, one of its terms and conditions, how\r\ncould it be enforced, as we all know it might be, in another\r\njurisdiction, which should have no regard to the law of the place?\r\nSuppose the parties, after the contract, to remove to another State, do\r\nthey carry the law with them as part of their contract? We all know they\r\ndo not. Or take a common case. Some States have laws abolishing\r\nimprisonment for debt; these laws, according to the argument, are all\r\nparts of the contract; how, then, can the party, when sued in another\r\nState, be imprisoned contrary to the terms of his contract? (4.) The\r\nargument proves too much, inasmuch as it applies as strongly to prior as\r\nto subsequent contracts. It is founded on a supposed assent to the\r\nexercise of legislative authority, without considering whether that\r\nexercise be legal or illegal. But it is equally fair to found the\r\nargument on an implied assent to the potential exercise of that\r\nauthority. The implied reference to the control of legislative power is\r\nas reasonable and as strong when that power is dormant, as while it is\r\nin exercise. In one case, the argument is, \"The law existed, you knew\r\nit, and acquiesced.\" In the other it is, \"The power to pass the law\r\nexisted, you knew it, and took your chance.\" There is as clear an assent\r\nin one instance as in the other. Indeed, it is more reasonable and more\r\nsensible to imply a general assent to all the laws of society, present\r\nand to come, from the fact of living in it, than it is to imply a\r\nparticular assent to a particular existing enactment. The true view of\r\nthe matter is, that every man is presumed to submit to all power which\r\nmay be lawfully exercised over him or his right, and no one should be\r\npresumed to submit to illegal acts of power, whether actual or\r\ncontingent. (5.) But a main objection to this argument is, that it would\r\nrender the whole constitutional provision idle and inoperative; and no\r\nexplanatory words, if such words had been added in the Constitution,\r\ncould have prevented this consequence. The law, it is said, is part of\r\nthe contract; it cannot, therefore, impair the contract, because a\r\ncontract cannot impair itself. Now, if this argument be sound, the case\r\nwould have been the same, whatever words the Constitution had used. If,\r\nfor example, it had declared that no State should pass any law impairing\r\ncontracts _prospectively_ or _retrospectively_; or any law impairing\r\ncontracts, whether existing or future; or, whatever terms it had used to\r\nprohibit precisely such a law as is now before the court,--the\r\nprohibition would be totally nugatory if the law is to be taken as part\r\nof the contract; and the result would be, that, whatever may be the laws\r\nwhich the States by this clause of the Constitution are prohibited from\r\npassing, yet, if they in fact do pass such laws, those laws are valid,\r\nand bind parties by a supposed assent.\r\n\r\nBut further, this idea, if well founded, would enable the States to\r\ndefeat the whole constitutional provision by a general enactment.\r\nSuppose a State should declare, by law, that all contracts entered into\r\ntherein should be subject to such laws as the legislature, at any time,\r\nor from time to time, might see fit to pass. This law, according to the\r\nargument, would enter into the contract, become a part of it, and\r\nauthorize the interference of the legislative power with it, for any\r\nand all purposes, wholly uncontrolled by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nSo much for the argument that the law is a part of the contract. We\r\nthink it is shown to be not so; and if it were, the expected consequence\r\nwould not follow.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry, then, recurs, whether the law in question be such a law as\r\nthe legislature of New York had authority to pass. The question is\r\ngeneral. We differ from our learned adversaries on general principles.\r\nWe differ as to the main scope and end of this constitutional provision.\r\nThey think it entirely remedial; we regard it as preventive. They think\r\nit adopted to secure redress for violated private rights; to us, it\r\nseems intended to guard against great public mischiefs. They argue it as\r\nif it were designed as an indemnity or protection for injured private\r\nrights, in individual cases of _meum_ and _tuum_; we look upon it as a\r\ngreat political provision, favorable to the commerce and credit of the\r\nwhole country. Certainly we do not deny its application to cases of\r\nviolated private right. Such cases are clearly and unquestionably within\r\nits operation. Still, we think its main scope to be general and\r\npolitical. And this, we think, is proved by reference to the history of\r\nthe country, and to the great objects which were sought to be attained\r\nby the establishment of the present government. Commerce, credit, and\r\nconfidence were the principal things which did not exist under the old\r\nConfederation, and which it was a main object of the present\r\nConstitution to create and establish. A vicious system of legislation, a\r\nsystem of paper money and tender laws, had completely paralyzed\r\nindustry, threatened to beggar every man of property, and ultimately to\r\nruin the country. The relation between debtor and creditor, always\r\ndelicate, and always dangerous whenever it divides society, and draws\r\nout the respective parties into different ranks and classes, was in such\r\na condition in the years 1787, 1788, and 1789, as to threaten the\r\noverthrow of all government; and a revolution was menaced, much more\r\ncritical and alarming than that through which the country had recently\r\npassed. The object of the new Constitution was to arrest these evils; to\r\nawaken industry by giving security to property; to establish confidence,\r\ncredit, and commerce, by salutary laws, to be enforced by the power of\r\nthe whole community. The Revolutionary War was over, the country had\r\npeace, but little domestic tranquillity; it had liberty, but few of its\r\nenjoyments, and none of its security. The States had struggled together,\r\nbut their union was imperfect. They had freedom, but not an established\r\ncourse of justice. The Constitution was therefore framed, as it\r\nprofesses, \"to form a more perfect union, to establish justice, to\r\nsecure the blessings of liberty, and to insure domestic tranquillity.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not pertinent to this occasion to advert to all the means by which\r\nthese desirable ends were to be obtained. Some of them, closely\r\nconnected with the subject now under consideration, are obvious and\r\nprominent. The objects were commerce, credit, and mutual confidence in\r\nmatters of property; and these required, among other things, a uniform\r\nstandard of value or medium of payments. One of the first powers given\r\nto Congress, therefore, is that of coining money and fixing the value of\r\nforeign coins; and one of the first restraints imposed on the States is\r\nthe total prohibition to coin money. These two provisions are\r\nindustriously followed up and completed by denying to the States all\r\npower to emit bills of credit, or to make any thing but gold and silver\r\na tender in the payment of debts. The whole control, therefore, over the\r\nstandard of value and medium of payments is vested in the general\r\ngovernment. And here the question instantly suggests itself. Why should\r\nsuch pains be taken to confide to Congress alone this exclusive power of\r\nfixing on a standard of value, and of prescribing the medium in which\r\ndebts shall be paid, if it is, after all, to be left to every State to\r\ndeclare that debts may be discharged, and to prescribe how they may be\r\ndischarged, without any payment at all? Why say that no man shall be\r\nobliged to take, in discharge of a debt, paper money issued by the\r\nauthority of a State, and yet say that by the same authority the debt\r\nmay be discharged without any payment whatever?\r\n\r\nWe contend, that the Constitution has not left its work thus unfinished.\r\nWe contend, that, taking its provisions together, it is apparent it was\r\nintended to provide for two things, intimately connected with each\r\nother. These are,--\r\n\r\n1. A medium for the payment of debts; and,\r\n\r\n2. A uniform manner of discharging debts, when they are to be discharged\r\nwithout payment.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the grants and prohibitions contained in the\r\nConstitution is fit to be regarded on this occasion. The grant to\r\nCongress and the prohibition on the States, though they are certainly to\r\nbe construed together, are not contained in the same clauses. The powers\r\ngranted to Congress are enumerated one after another in the eighth\r\nsection; the principal limitations on those powers, in the ninth\r\nsection; and the prohibitions to the States, in the tenth section. Now,\r\nin order to understand whether any particular power be exclusively\r\nvested in Congress, it is necessary to read the terms of the grant,\r\ntogether with the terms of the prohibition. Take an example from that\r\npower of which we have been speaking, the coinage power. Here the grant\r\nto Congress is, \"To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of\r\nforeign coins.\" Now, the correlative prohibition on the States, though\r\nfound in another section, is undoubtedly to be taken in immediate\r\nconnection with the foregoing, as much as if it had been found in the\r\nsame clause. The only just reading of these provisions, therefore, is\r\nthis: \"Congress shall have power to coin money, regulate the value\r\nthereof, and of foreign coin; but no State shall coin money, emit bills\r\nof credit, or make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in\r\npayment of debts.\"\r\n\r\nThese provisions respect the medium of payment, or standard of value,\r\nand, thus collated, their joint result is clear and decisive. We think\r\nthe result clear, also, of those provisions which respect the discharge\r\nof debts without payment. Collated in like manner, they stand thus:\r\n\"Congress shall have power to establish uniform laws on the subject of\r\nbankruptcies throughout the United States, but no State shall pass any\r\nlaw impairing the obligation of contracts.\" This collocation cannot be\r\nobjected to, if they refer to the same subject-matter; and that they do\r\nrefer to the same subject-matter we have the authority of this court for\r\nsaying, because this court solemnly determined, in _Sturges v.\r\nCrowninshield_, that this prohibition on the States did apply to systems\r\nof bankruptcy. It must be now taken, therefore, that State bankrupt laws\r\nwere in the mind of the Convention when the prohibition was adopted, and\r\ntherefore the grant to Congress on the subject of bankrupt laws, and the\r\nprohibition to the States on the same subject, are properly to be taken\r\nand read together; and being thus read together, is not the intention\r\nclear to take away from the States the power of passing bankrupt laws,\r\nsince, while enacted by them, such laws would not be uniform, and to\r\nconfer the power exclusively on Congress, by whom uniform laws could be\r\nestablished?\r\n\r\nSuppose the order of arrangement in the Constitution had been otherwise\r\nthan it is, and that the prohibitions to the States had preceded the\r\ngrants of power to Congress, the two powers, when collated, would then\r\nhave read thus: \"No State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of\r\ncontracts; but Congress may establish uniform laws on the subject of\r\nbankruptcies.\" Could any man have doubted, in that case, that the\r\nmeaning was, that the States should not pass laws discharging debts\r\nwithout payment, but that Congress might establish uniform bankrupt\r\nacts? And yet this inversion of the order of the clauses does not alter\r\ntheir sense. We contend, that Congress alone possesses the power of\r\nestablishing bankrupt laws; and although we are aware that, in _Sturges\r\nv. Crowninshield_, the court decided that such an exclusive power could\r\nnot be inferred from the words of the grant in the seventh section, we\r\nyet would respectfully request the bench to reconsider this point. We\r\nthink it could not have been intended that both the States and general\r\ngovernment should exercise this power; and therefore, that a grant to\r\none implies a prohibition on the other. But not to press a topic which\r\nthe court has already had under its consideration, we contend, that,\r\neven without reading the clauses of the Constitution in the connection\r\nwhich we have suggested, and which is believed to be the true one, the\r\nprohibition in the tenth section, taken by itself, does forbid the\r\nenactment of State bankrupt laws, as applied to future as well as\r\npresent debts. We argue this from the words of the prohibition, from the\r\nassociation they are found in, and from the objects intended.\r\n\r\n1. The words are general. The States can pass no law impairing\r\ncontracts; that is, any contract. In the nature of things a law may\r\nimpair a future contract, and therefore such contract is within the\r\nprotection of the Constitution. The words being general, it is for the\r\nother side to show a limitation; and this, it is submitted, they have\r\nwholly failed to do, unless they shall have established the doctrine\r\nthat the law itself is part of the contract. It may be added, that the\r\nparticular expression of the Constitution is worth regarding. The thing\r\nprohibited is called a _law_, not an _act_. A law, in its general\r\nacceptation, is a rule prescribed for future conduct, not a legislative\r\ninterference with existing rights. The framers of the Constitution would\r\nhardly have given the appellation of _law_ to violent invasions of\r\nindividual right, or individual property, by acts of legislative power.\r\nAlthough, doubtless, such acts fall within this prohibition, yet they\r\nare prohibited also by general principles, and by the constitutions of\r\nthe States, and therefore further provision against such acts was not so\r\nnecessary as against other mischiefs.\r\n\r\n2. The most conclusive argument, perhaps, arises from the connection in\r\nwhich the clause stands. The words of the prohibition, so far as it\r\napplies to civil rights, or rights of property, are, that \"no State\r\nshall coin money, emit bills of credit, make any thing but gold and\r\nsilver coin a tender in the payment of debts, or pass any law impairing\r\nthe obligation of contracts.\" The prohibition of attainders, and _ex\r\npost facto_ laws, refers entirely to criminal proceedings, and therefore\r\nshould be considered as standing by itself; but the other parts of the\r\nprohibition are connected by the subject-matter, and ought, therefore,\r\nto be construed together. Taking the words thus together, according to\r\ntheir natural connection, how is it possible to give a more limited\r\nconstruction to the term \"contracts,\" in the last branch of the\r\nsentence, than to the word \"debts,\" in that immediately preceding? Can a\r\nState make any thing but gold and silver a tender in payment of future\r\ndebts? This nobody pretends. But what ground is there for a distinction?\r\nNo State shall make any thing but gold and silver a tender in the\r\npayment of debts, nor pass any law impairing the obligation of\r\ncontracts. Now, by what reasoning is it made out that the debts here\r\nspoken of are any debts, either existing or future, but that the\r\ncontracts spoken of are subsisting contracts only? Such a distinction\r\nseems to us wholly arbitrary. We see no ground for it. Suppose the\r\narticle, where it uses the word _debts_, had used the word _contracts_.\r\nThe sense would have been the same then that it now is; but the identity\r\nof terms would have made the nature of the distinction now contended for\r\nsomewhat more obvious. Thus altered, the clause would read, that no\r\nState should make any thing but gold and silver a tender in discharge of\r\n_contracts_, nor pass any law impairing the obligation of _contracts_;\r\nyet the first of these expressions would have been held to apply to all\r\ncontracts, and the last to subsisting contracts only. This shows the\r\nconsequence of what is now contended for in a strong light. It is\r\ncertain that the substitution of the word _contracts_ for _debts_ would\r\nnot alter the sense; and an argument that could not be sustained, if\r\nsuch substitution were made, cannot be sustained now. We maintain,\r\ntherefore, that, if tender laws may not be made for future debts,\r\nneither can bankrupt laws be made for future contracts. All the\r\narguments used here may be applied with equal force to tender laws for\r\nfuture debts. It may be said, for instance, that, when it speaks of\r\n_debts_, the Constitution means existing debts, and not mere\r\npossibilities of future debt; that the object was to preserve vested\r\nrights; and that if a man, after a tender law had passed, had contracted\r\na debt, the manner in which that tender law authorized that debt to be\r\ndischarged became part of the contract, and that the whole debt, or\r\nwhole obligation, was thus qualified by the pre-existing law, and was no\r\nmore than a contract to deliver so much paper money, or whatever other\r\narticle might be made a tender, as the original bargain expressed.\r\nArguments of this sort will not be found wanting in favor of tender\r\nlaws, if the court yield to similar arguments in favor of bankrupt laws.\r\n\r\nThese several prohibitions of the Constitution stand in the same\r\nparagraph; they have the same purpose, and were introduced for the same\r\nobject; they are expressed in words of similar import, in grammar, and\r\nin sense; they are subject to the same construction, and we think no\r\nreason has yet been given for imposing an important restriction on one\r\npart of them, which does not equally show that the same restriction\r\nmight be imposed also on the other part.\r\n\r\nWe have already endeavored to maintain, that one great political object\r\nintended by the Constitution would be defeated, if this construction\r\nwere allowed to prevail. As an object of political regulation, it was\r\nnot important to prevent the States from passing bankrupt laws\r\napplicable to present debts, while the power was left to them in regard\r\nto future debts; nor was it at all important, in a political point of\r\nview, to prohibit tender laws as to future debts, while it was yet left\r\nto the States to pass laws for the discharge of such debts, which, after\r\nall, are little different in principle from tender laws. Look at the law\r\nbefore the court in this view. It provides, that, if the debtor will\r\nsurrender, offer, or tender to trustees, for the benefit of his\r\ncreditors, all his estate and effects, he shall be discharged from all\r\nhis debts. If it had authorized a tender of any thing but money to any\r\none creditor, though it were of a value equal to the debt, and thereupon\r\nprovided for a discharge, it would have been clearly invalid. Yet it is\r\nmaintained to be good, merely because it is made for all creditors, and\r\nseeks a discharge from all debts; although the thing tendered may not be\r\nequivalent to a shilling in the pound of those debts. This shows, again,\r\nvery clearly, how the Constitution has failed of its purpose, if, having\r\nin terms prohibited all tender laws, and taken so much pains to\r\nestablish a uniform medium of payment, it has yet left the States the\r\npower of discharging debts, as they may see fit, without any payment at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate what has been said, we maintain, first, that the\r\nConstitution, by its grants to Congress and its prohibitions on the\r\nStates, has sought to establish one uniform standard of value, or medium\r\nof payment. Second, that, by like means, it has endeavored to provide\r\nfor one uniform mode of discharging debts, when they are to be\r\ndischarged without payment. Third, that these objects are connected, and\r\nthat the first loses much of its importance, if the last, also, be not\r\naccomplished. Fourth, that, reading the grant to Congress and the\r\nprohibition on the States together, the inference is strong that the\r\nConstitution intended to confer an exclusive power to pass bankrupt laws\r\non Congress. Fifth, that the prohibition in the tenth section reaches to\r\nall contracts, existing or future, in the same way that the other\r\nprohibition in the same section extends to all debts existing or\r\nfuture. Sixthly, that, upon any other construction, one great political\r\nobject of the Constitution will fail of its accomplishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. Rep. 122.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MURDER OF CAPTAIN JOSEPH WHITE.\r\n\r\nAN ARGUMENT ON THE TRIAL OF JOHN FRANCIS KNAPP, FOR THE MURDER OF JOSEPH\r\nWHITE, OF SALEM, IN ESSEX COUNTY, MASSACHUSETTS, ON THE NIGHT OF THE 6TH\r\nOF APRIL, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following argument was addressed to the jury at a trial for a\r\nremarkable murder. A more extraordinary case never occurred in this\r\ncountry, nor is it equalled in strange interest by any trial in the\r\nFrench _Causes Célèbres_ or the English _State Trials_. Deep sensation\r\nand intense curiosity were excited through the whole country, at the\r\ntime of the occurrence of the event, not only by the atrocity of the\r\ncrime, but by the position of the victim, and the romantic incidents in\r\nthe detection and fate of the assassin and his accomplices.\r\n\r\nThe following outline of the facts will assist the reader to understand\r\nthe bearings of the argument.\r\n\r\nJoseph White, Esq. was found murdered in his bed, in his mansion-house,\r\non the morning of the 7th of April, 1830. He was a wealthy merchant of\r\nSalem, eighty-two years of age, and had for many years given up active\r\nbusiness. His servant-man rose that morning at six o'clock, and on going\r\ndown into the kitchen, and opening the shutters of the window, saw that\r\nthe back window of the east parlor was open, and that a plank was raised\r\nto the window from the back yard; he then went into the parlor, but saw\r\nno trace of any person having been there. He went to the apartment of\r\nthe maid-servant, and told her, and then into Mr. White's chamber by its\r\nback door, and saw that the door of his chamber, leading into the front\r\nentry, was open. On approaching the bed, he found the bed-clothes turned\r\ndown, and Mr. White dead, his countenance pallid, and his night-clothes\r\nand bed drenched in blood. He hastened to the neighboring houses to make\r\nknown the event. He and the maid-servant were the only persons who slept\r\nin the house that night, except Mr. White himself, whose niece, Mrs.\r\nBeckford, his house-keeper, was then absent on a visit to her daughter,\r\nat Wenham.\r\n\r\nThe physicians and the coroner's jury, who were called to examine the\r\nbody, found on it thirteen deep stabs, made as if by a sharp dirk or\r\nponiard, and the appearance of a heavy blow on the left temple, which\r\nhad fractured the skull, but not broken the skin. The body was cold, and\r\nappeared to have been lifeless many hours.\r\n\r\nOn examining the apartments of the house, it did not appear that any\r\nvaluable articles had been taken, or the house ransacked for them; there\r\nwas a _rouleau_ of doubloons in an iron chest in his chamber, and costly\r\nplate in other apartments, none of which was missing.\r\n\r\nThe perpetration of such an atrocious crime, in the most populous and\r\ncentral part of the town and in the most compactly built street, and\r\nunder circumstances indicating the utmost coolness, deliberation, and\r\naudacity, deeply agitated and aroused the whole community; ingenuity was\r\nbaffled in attempting even to conjecture a _motive_ for the deed; and\r\nall the citizens were led to fear that the same fate might await them in\r\nthe defenceless and helpless hours of slumber. For several days, persons\r\npassing through the streets might hear the continual sound of the\r\nhammer, while carpenters and smiths were fixing bolts to doors and\r\nfastenings to windows. Many, for defence, furnished themselves with\r\ncutlasses, fire-arms, and watch-dogs. Large rewards for the detection of\r\nthe author or authors of the murder were offered by the heirs of the\r\ndeceased, by the selectmen of the town, and by the Governor of the\r\nState. The citizens held a public meeting, and appointed a Committee of\r\nVigilance, of twenty-seven members, to make all possible exertions to\r\nferret out the offenders.\r\n\r\nWhile the public mind was thus excited and anxious, it was announced\r\nthat a bold attempt at highway robbery was made in Wenham, by three\r\nfootpads, on Joseph J. Knapp, Jr. and John Francis Knapp, on the evening\r\nof the 27th of April, while they were returning in a chaise from Salem\r\nto their residence in Wenham. They appeared before the investigating\r\ncommittee, and testified that, after nine o'clock, near the Wenham Pond,\r\nthey discovered three men approaching. One came near, seized the bridle,\r\nand stopped the horse, while the other two came, one on each side, and\r\nseized a trunk in the bottom of the chaise. Frank Knapp drew a sword\r\nfrom his cane and made a thrust at one, and Joseph with the but-end of\r\nhis whip gave the other a heavy blow across the face. This bold\r\nresistance made them fall back. Joseph sprung from the chaise to assail\r\nthe robbers. One of them then gave a shrill whistle, when they fled,\r\nand, leaping over the wall, were soon lost in the darkness. One had a\r\nweapon like an ivory dirk-handle, was clad in a sailor's short jacket,\r\ncap, and had whiskers; another wore a long coat, with bright buttons;\r\nall three were good-sized men. Frank, too, sprung from the chaise, and\r\npursued with vigor, but all in vain.\r\n\r\nThe account of this unusual and bold attempt at robbery, thus given by\r\nthe Knapps was immediately published in the Salem newspapers, with the\r\neditorial remark, that \"these gentlemen are well known in this town, and\r\ntheir respectability and veracity are not questioned by any of our\r\ncitizens.\"\r\n\r\nNot the slightest clew to the murder could be found for several weeks,\r\nand the mystery seemed to be impenetrable. At length a rumor reached the\r\near of the committee that a prisoner in the jail at New Bedford, seventy\r\nmiles from Salem, confined there on a charge of shoplifting, had\r\nintimated that he could make important disclosures. A confidential\r\nmessenger was immediately sent, to ascertain what he knew on the\r\nsubject. The prisoner's name was Hatch; he had been committed before the\r\nmurder. He stated that, some months before the murder, while he was at\r\nlarge, he had associated in Salem with Richard Crowninshield, Jr., of\r\nDanvers, and had often heard Crowninshield express his intention to\r\ndestroy the life of Mr. White. Crowninshield was a young man, of bad\r\nreputation; though he had never been convicted of any offence, he was\r\nstrongly suspected of several heinous robberies. He was of dark and\r\nreserved deportment, temperate and wicked, daring and wary, subtle and\r\nobdurate, of great adroitness, boldness, and self-command. He had for\r\nseveral years frequented the haunts of vice in Salem; and though he was\r\noften spoken of as a dangerous man, his person was known to few, for he\r\nnever walked the streets by daylight. Among his few associates he was a\r\nleader and a despot.\r\n\r\nThe disclosures of Hatch received credit. When the Supreme Court met at\r\nIpswich, the Attorney-General, Morton, moved for a writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus ad testif._, and Hatch was carried in chains from New Bedford\r\nbefore the grand jury, and on his testimony an indictment was found\r\nagainst Crowninshield. Other witnesses testified that, on the night of\r\nthe murder, his brother, George Crowninshield, Colonel Benjamin Selman,\r\nof Marblehead, and Daniel Chase, of Lynn, were together in Salem, at a\r\ngambling-house usually frequented by Richard; these were indicted as\r\naccomplices in the crime. They were all arrested on the 2d of May,\r\narraigned on the indictment, and committed to prison to await the\r\nsitting of a court that should have jurisdiction of the offence.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Vigilance, however, continued to hold frequent meetings\r\nin order to discover further proof, for it was doubted by many whether\r\nthe evidence already obtained would be sufficient to convict the\r\naccused.\r\n\r\nA fortnight afterwards, on the 15th of May, Captain Joseph J. Knapp, a\r\nshipmaster and merchant, a man of good character, received by mail the\r\nfollowing letter:--\r\n\r\nCHARLES GRANT, JR., TO JOSEPH J. KNAPP.\r\n\r\n\"_Belfast, May 12, 1830._\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir,--I have taken the pen at this time to address an utter\r\nstranger, and, strange as it may seem to you, it is for the purpose of\r\nrequesting the loan of three hundred and fifty-dollars, for which I can\r\ngive you no security but my word, and in this case consider this to be\r\nsufficient. My call for money at this time is pressing, or I would not\r\ntrouble you; but with that sum, I have the prospect of turning it to so\r\nmuch advantage, as to be able to refund it with interest in the course\r\nof six months. At all events, I think it will be for your interest to\r\ncomply with my request, and that immediately,--that is, not to put off\r\nany longer than you receive this. Then set down and enclose me the money\r\nwith as much despatch as possible, for your own interest. This, Sir, is\r\nmy advice; and if you do not comply with it, the short period between\r\nnow and November will convince you that you have denied a request, the\r\ngranting of which will never injure you, the refusal of which will ruin\r\nyou. Are you surprised at this assertion--rest assured that I make it,\r\nreserving to myself the reasons and a series of facts, which are founded\r\non such a bottom as will bid defiance to property or quality. It is\r\nuseless for me to enter into a discussion of facts which must inevitably\r\nharrow up your soul. No, I will merely tell you that I am acquainted\r\nwith your brother Franklin, and also the business that he was\r\ntransacting for you on the 2d of April last; and that I think that you\r\nwas very extravagant in giving one thousand dollars to the person that\r\nwould execute the business for you. But you know best about that; you\r\nsee that such things will leak out. To conclude, Sir, I will inform you\r\nthat there is a gentleman of my acquaintance in Salem, that will observe\r\nthat you do not leave town before the first of June, giving you\r\nsufficient time between now and then to comply with my request: and if I\r\ndo not receive a line from you, together with the above sum, before the\r\n22d of this month, I shall wait upon you with an assistant. I have said\r\nenough to convince you of my knowledge, and merely inform you that you\r\ncan, when you answer, be as brief as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Direct yours to\r\n\r\n\"CHARLES GRANT, Jr., of Prospect, Maine.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was an unintelligible enigma to Captain Knapp; he knew no\r\nman of the name of Charles Grant, Jr., and had no acquaintance at\r\nBelfast, a town in Maine, two hundred miles distant from Salem. After\r\nporing over it in vain, he handed it to his son, Nathaniel Phippen\r\nKnapp, a young lawyer; to him also the letter was an inexplicable\r\nriddle. The receiving of such a _threatening_ letter, at a time when so\r\nmany felt insecure, and were apprehensive of danger, demanded their\r\nattention. Captain Knapp and his son Phippen, therefore, concluded to\r\nride to Wenham, seven miles distant, and show the letter to Captain\r\nKnapp's other two sons, Joseph J. Knapp, Jr. and John Francis Knapp, who\r\nwere then residing at Wenham with Mrs. Beckford, the niece and late\r\nhouse-keeper of Mr. White, and the mother of the wife of J.J. Knapp, Jr.\r\nThe latter perused the letter, told his father it \"contained a devilish\r\nlot of trash,\" and requested him to hand it to the Committee of\r\nVigilance. Captain Knapp, on his return to Salem that evening,\r\naccordingly delivered the letter to the chairman of the Committee.\r\n\r\nThe next day J.J. Knapp, Jr. went to Salem, and requested one of his\r\nfriends to drop into the Salem post-office the two following\r\npseudonymous letters.\r\n\r\n\"_May 13, 1830._\r\n\r\n\"GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE OF VIGILANCE,--Hearing that you have taken\r\nup four young men on suspicion of being concerned in the murder of Mr.\r\nWhite, I think it time to inform you that Steven White came to me one\r\nnight and told me, if I would _remove_ the old gentleman, he would give\r\nme five thousand dollars; he said he was afraid he would alter his will\r\nif he lived any longer. I told him I would do it, but I was afeared to\r\ngo into the house, so he said he would go with me, that he would try to\r\nget into the house in the evening and open the window, would then go\r\nhome and go to bed and meet me again about eleven. I found him, and we\r\nboth went into his chamber. I struck him on the head with a heavy piece\r\nof lead, and then stabbed him with a dirk; he made the finishing strokes\r\nwith another. He promised to send me the money next evening, and has not\r\nsent it yet which is the reason that I mention this.\r\n\r\n\"Yours, &c.,\r\n\r\n\"GRANT.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was directed on the outside to the \"Hon. Gideon Barstow,\r\nSalem,\" and put into the post-office on Sunday evening, May 16, 1830.\r\n\r\n\"_Lynn, May 12, 1830._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. White will send the $5,000, or a part of it, before to-morrow\r\nnight, or suffer the painful consequences.\r\n\r\n\"N. CLAXTON, 4TH.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was addressed to the \"Hon. Stephen White, Salem, Mass.,\" and\r\nwas also put into the post-office in Salem on Sunday evening.\r\n\r\nWhen Knapp delivered these letters to his friend, he said his father had\r\nreceived an anonymous letter, and \"What I want you for is to put these\r\nin the post-office in order to nip this silly affair in the bud.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Stephen White, mentioned in these letters, was a nephew of\r\nJoseph White, and the legatee of the principal part of his large\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nWhen the Committee of Vigilance read and considered the letter,\r\npurporting to be signed by Charles Grant, Jr., which had been delivered\r\nto them by Captain Knapp, they were impressed with the belief that it\r\ncontained a clew which might lead to important disclosures. As they had\r\nspared no pains or expense in their investigations, they immediately\r\ndespatched a discreet messenger to Prospect, in Maine; he explained his\r\nbusiness confidentially to the postmaster there, deposited a letter\r\naddressed to Charles Grant, Jr., and awaited the call of Grant to\r\nreceive it. He soon called for it, when an officer, stationed in the\r\nhouse, stepped forward and arrested Grant. On examining him, it appeared\r\nthat his true name was Palmer, a young man of genteel appearance,\r\nresident in the adjoining town of Belfast. He had been a convict in\r\nMaine, and had served a term in the State's prison in that State.\r\nConscious that the circumstances justified the belief that he had had a\r\nhand in the murder, he readily made known, while he protested his own\r\ninnocence, that he could unfold the whole mystery. He then disclosed\r\nthat he had been an associate of R. Crowninshield, Jr. and George\r\nCrowninshield; had spent part of the winter at Danvers and Salem, under\r\nthe name of Carr; part of the time he had been their inmate, concealed\r\nin their father's house in Danvers; that on the 2d of April he saw from\r\nthe windows of the house Frank Knapp and a young man named Allen ride up\r\nto the house; that George walked away with Frank, and Richard with\r\nAllen; that on their return, George told Richard that Frank wished them\r\nto undertake to kill Mr. White, and that J.J. Knapp, Jr. would pay one\r\nthousand dollars for the job. They proposed various modes of executing\r\nit, and asked Palmer to be concerned, which he declined. George said the\r\nhouse-keeper would be away at the time; that the object of Joseph J.\r\nKnapp, Jr. was to destroy the will, because it gave most of the property\r\nto Stephen White; that Joseph J. Knapp, Jr. was first to destroy the\r\nwill; that he could get from the house-keeper the keys of the iron chest\r\nin which it was kept; that Frank called again the same day, in a\r\nchaise, and rode away with Richard; and that on the night of the murder\r\nPalmer stayed at the Half-way House, in Lynn.\r\n\r\nThe messenger, on obtaining this disclosure from Palmer, without delay\r\ncommunicated it by mail to the Committee, and on the 26th of May, a\r\nwarrant was issued against Joseph J. Knapp, Jr. and John Francis Knapp,\r\nand they were taken into custody at Wenham, where they were residing in\r\nthe family of Mrs. Beckford, mother of the wife of Joseph J. Knapp, Jr.\r\nThey were then imprisoned to await the arrival of Palmer, for their\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe two Knapps were young shipmasters, of a respectable family.\r\n\r\nJoseph J. Knapp, Jr., on the third day of his imprisonment, made a full\r\nconfession that he projected the murder. He knew that Mr. White had made\r\nhis will, and given to Mrs. Beckford a legacy of fifteen thousand\r\ndollars; but if he died without leaving a will, he expected she would\r\ninherit nearly two hundred thousand dollars. In February he made known\r\nto his brother his desire to make way with Mr. White, intending first to\r\nabstract and destroy the will. Frank agreed to employ an assassin, and\r\nnegotiated with R. Crowninshield, Jr., who agreed to do the deed for a\r\nreward of one thousand dollars; Joseph agreed to pay that sum, and, as\r\nhe had access to the house at his pleasure, he was to unbar and unfasten\r\nthe back window, so that Crowninshield might gain easy entrance. Four\r\ndays before the murder, while they were deliberating on the mode of\r\ncompassing it, he went into Mr. White's chamber, and, finding the key in\r\nthe iron chest, unlocked it, took the will, put it in his chaise-box,\r\ncovered it with hay, carried it to Wenham, kept it till after the\r\nmurder, and then burned it. After securing the will, he gave notice to\r\nCrowninshield that all was ready. In the evening of that day he had a\r\nmeeting with Crowninshield at the centre of the common, who showed him a\r\nbludgeon and dagger, with which the murder was to be committed. Knapp\r\nasked him if he meant to do it that night; Crowninshield said he thought\r\nnot, he did not feel like it; Knapp then went to Wenham. Knapp\r\nascertained on Sunday, the 4th of April, that Mr. White had gone to take\r\ntea with a relative in Chestnut Street. Crowninshield intended to dirk\r\nhim on his way home in the evening, but Mr. White returned before dark.\r\nIt was next arranged for the night of the 6th, and Knapp was on some\r\npretext to prevail on Mrs. Beckford to visit her daughters at Wenham,\r\nand to spend the night there. He said that, all preparations being thus\r\ncomplete, Crowninshield and Frank met about ten o'clock in the evening\r\nof the 6th, in Brown Street, which passes the rear of the garden of Mr.\r\nWhite, and stood some time in a spot from which they could observe the\r\nmovements in the house, and perceive when Mr. White and his two servants\r\nretired to bed. Crowninshield requested Frank to go home; he did so, but\r\nsoon returned to the same spot. Crowninshield, in the mean time, had\r\nstarted and passed round through Newbury Street and Essex Street to the\r\nfront of the house, entered the postern gate, passed to the rear of the\r\nhouse, placed a plank against the house, climbed to the window, opened\r\nit, entered the house alone, passed up the staircase, opened the door of\r\nthe sleeping-chamber, approached the bedside, gave Mr. White a heavy and\r\nmortal blow on the head with a bludgeon, and then with a dirk gave him\r\nmany stabs in his body. Crowninshield said, that, after he had \"done for\r\nthe old man,\" he put his fingers on his pulse to make certain he was\r\ndead. He then retired from the house, hurried back through Brown Street,\r\nwhere he met Frank, waiting to learn the event. Crowninshield ran down\r\nHoward Street, a solitary place, and hid the club under the steps of a\r\nmeeting-house. He then went home to Danvers.\r\n\r\nJoseph confessed further that the account of the Wenham robbery, on the\r\n27th of April, was a sheer fabrication. After the murder Crowninshield\r\nwent to Wenham in company with Frank to call for the one thousand\r\ndollars. He was not able to pay the whole, but gave him one hundred\r\nfive-franc pieces. Crowninshield related to him the particulars of the\r\nmurder, told him where the club was hid, and said he was sorry Joseph\r\nhad not got the right will, for if he had known there was another, he\r\nwould have got it. Joseph sent Frank afterwards to find and destroy the\r\nclub, but he said he could not find it. When Joseph made the confession,\r\nhe told the place where the club was concealed, and it was there found;\r\nit was heavy, made of hickory, twenty-two and a half inches long, of a\r\nsmooth surface and large oval head, loaded with lead, and of a form\r\nadapted to give a mortal blow on the skull without breaking the skin;\r\nthe handle was suited for a firm grasp. Crowninshield said he turned it\r\nin a lathe. Joseph admitted he wrote the two anonymous letters.\r\n\r\nCrowninshield had hitherto maintained a stoical composure of feeling;\r\nbut when he was informed of Knapp's arrest, his knees smote beneath him,\r\nthe sweat started out on his stern and pallid face, and he subsided upon\r\nhis bunk.\r\n\r\nPalmer was brought to Salem in irons on the 3d of June, and committed to\r\nprison. Crowninshield saw him taken from the carriage. He was put in the\r\ncell directly under that in which Crowninshield was kept. Several\r\nmembers of the Committee entered Palmer's cell to talk with him; while\r\nthey were talking, they heard a loud whistle, and, on looking up, saw\r\nthat Crowninshield had picked away the mortar from the crevice between\r\nthe blocks of the granite floor of his cell. After the loud whistle, he\r\ncried out, \"Palmer! Palmer!\" and soon let down a string, to which were\r\ntied a pencil and a slip of paper. Two lines of poetry were written on\r\nthe paper, in order that, if Palmer was really there, he should make it\r\nknown by capping the verses. Palmer shrunk away into a corner, and was\r\nsoon transferred to another cell. He seemed to stand in awe of\r\nCrowninshield.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of June a quantity of stolen goods was found concealed in\r\nthe barn of Crowninshield, in consequence of information from Palmer.\r\n\r\nCrowninshield, thus finding the proofs of his guilt and depravity\r\nthicken, on the 15th of June committed suicide by hanging himself to the\r\nbars of his cell with a handkerchief. He left letters to his father and\r\nbrother, expressing in general terms the viciousness of his life, and\r\nhis hopelessness of escape from punishment. When his associates in guilt\r\nheard his fate, they said it was not unexpected by them, for they had\r\noften heard him say he would never live to submit to an ignominious\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nA special term of the Supreme Court was held at Salem on the 20th of\r\nJuly, for the trial of the prisoners charged with the murder; it\r\ncontinued in session till the 20th of August, with a few days'\r\nintermission. An indictment for the murder was found against John\r\nFrancis Knapp, as principal, and Joseph J. Knapp, Jr. and George\r\nCrowninshield, as accessories. Selman and Chase were discharged by the\r\nAttorney-General.\r\n\r\nThe principal, John Francis Knapp, was first put on trial. As the law\r\nthen stood, an accessory in a murder could not be tried until a\r\nprincipal had been convicted. He was defended by Messrs. Franklin Dexter\r\nand William H. Gardiner, advocates of high reputation for ability and\r\neloquence; the trial was long and arduous, and the witnesses numerous.\r\nHis brother Joseph, who had made a full confession, on the government's\r\npromise of impunity if he would in good faith testify the truth, was\r\nbrought into court, called to the stand as a witness, but declined to\r\ntestify. To convict the prisoner, it was necessary for the government to\r\nprove that he was _present_, actually or constructively, as an aider or\r\nabettor in the murder. The evidence was strong that there was a\r\nconspiracy to commit the murder, that the prisoner was one of the\r\nconspirators, that at the time of the murder he was in Brown Street at\r\nthe rear of Mr. White's garden, and the jury were satisfied that he was\r\nin that place to aid and abet in the murder, ready to afford assistance,\r\nif necessary. He was convicted.\r\n\r\nJoseph J. Knapp, Jr. was afterwards tried as an accessory before the\r\nfact, and convicted.\r\n\r\nGeorge Crowninshield proved an _alibi_, and was discharged.\r\n\r\nThe execution of John Francis Knapp and Joseph J. Knapp, Jr. closed the\r\ntragedy.\r\n\r\nIf Joseph, after turning State's evidence, had not changed his mind,\r\nneither he nor his brother, nor any of the conspirators, could have been\r\nconvicted; if he had testified, and disclosed the whole truth, it would\r\nhave appeared that John Francis Knapp was in Brown Street, not to render\r\nassistance to the assassin; but that Crowninshield, when he started to\r\ncommit the murder, requested Frank to go home and go to bed; that Frank\r\ndid go home, retire to bed, soon after arose, secretly left his father's\r\nhouse, and hastened to Brown Street, to await the coming out of the\r\nassassin, in order to learn whether the deed was accomplished, and all\r\nthe particulars. If Frank had not been convicted as principal, none of\r\nthe accessories could by law have been convicted. Joseph would not have\r\nbeen even tried, for the government stipulated, that, if he would be a\r\nwitness for the State, he should go clear.\r\n\r\nThe whole history of this occurrence is of romantic interest. The murder\r\nitself, the _corpus delicti_, was strange; planned with deliberation and\r\nsagacity, and executed with firmness and vigor. While conjecture was\r\nbaffled in ascertaining either the motive or the perpetrator, it was\r\ncertain that the assassin had acted upon design, and not at random. He\r\nmust have had knowledge of the house, for the window had been unfastened\r\nfrom within. He had entered stealthily, threaded his way in silence\r\nthrough the apartments, corridors, and staircases, and coolly given the\r\nmortal blow. To make assurance doubly sure, he inflicted many fatal\r\nstabs, \"the least a death to nature,\" and stayed not his hand till he\r\nhad deliberately felt the pulse of his victim, to make certain that life\r\nwas extinct.\r\n\r\nIt was strange that Crowninshield, the real assassin, should have been\r\nindicted and arrested on the testimony of Hatch, who was himself in\r\nprison, in a distant part of the State, at the time of the murder, and\r\nhad no actual knowledge on the subject.\r\n\r\nIt was very strange that J.J. Knapp, Jr. should have been the instrument\r\nof bringing to light the mystery of the whole murderous conspiracy; for\r\nwhen he received from the hand of his father the threatening letter of\r\nPalmer, consciousness of guilt so confounded his faculties, that,\r\ninstead of destroying it, he stupidly handed it back and requested his\r\nfather to deliver it to the Committee of Vigilance.\r\n\r\nIt was strange that the murder should have been committed on a mistake\r\nin law. Joseph, some time previous to the murder, had made inquiry how\r\nMr. White's estate would be distributed in case he died without a will,\r\nand had been erroneously told that Mrs. Beckford, his mother-in-law, the\r\nsole issue and representative of a deceased sister of Mr. White, would\r\ninherit half of the estate, and that the four children and\r\nrepresentatives of a deceased brother of Mr. White, of whom the Hon.\r\nStephen White was one, would inherit the other half. Joseph had\r\nprivately read the will, and knew that Mr. White had bequeathed to Mrs.\r\nBeckford much less than half.\r\n\r\nIt was strange that the murder should have been committed on a mistake\r\nin fact also. Joseph furtively abstracted _a_ will, and expected Mr.\r\nWhite would die intestate; but, after the decease, _the_ will, the\r\n_last_ will, was found by his heirs in its proper place; and it could\r\nnever have been known, or conjectured, without the aid of Joseph's\r\nconfession, that he had made either of those blunders.\r\n\r\nFinally, it was a strange fact that Knapp should, on the night following\r\nthe murder, have watched with the mangled corpse, and at the funeral\r\nfollowed the hearse as one of the chief mourners, without betraying on\r\neither occasion the slightest emotion which could awaken a suspicion of\r\nhis guilt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following note was prefixed to this argument in the former\r\nedition:--\r\n\r\nMr. White, a highly respectable and wealthy citizen of Salem, about\r\neighty years of age, was found, on the morning of the 7th of April,\r\n1830, in his bed, murdered, under such circumstances as to create a\r\nstrong sensation in that town and throughout the community.\r\n\r\nRichard Crowninshield, George Crowninshield, Joseph J. Knapp, and John\r\nF. Knapp were, a few weeks after, arrested on a charge of having\r\nperpetrated the murder, and committed for trial. Joseph J. Knapp, soon\r\nafter, under the promise of favor from government, made a full\r\nconfession of the crime and the circumstances attending it. In a few\r\ndays after this disclosure was made, Richard Crowninshield, who was\r\nsupposed to have been the principal assassin, committed suicide.\r\n\r\nA special session of the Supreme Court was ordered by the legislature,\r\nfor the trial of the prisoners, at Salem, in July. At that time, John F.\r\nKnapp was indicted as principal in the murder, and George Crowninshield\r\nand Joseph J. Knapp as accessories.\r\n\r\nOn account of the death of Chief Justice Parker, which occurred on the\r\n26th of July, the court adjourned to Tuesday, the third day of August,\r\nwhen it proceeded in the trial of John F. Knapp. Joseph J. Knapp, being\r\ncalled upon, refused to testify, and the pledge of the government was\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the prosecuting officers of the government, Mr.\r\nWebster appeared as counsel, and assisted in the trial.\r\n\r\nMr. Franklin Dexter addressed the jury on behalf of the prisoner, and\r\nwas succeeded by Mr. Webster in the following speech.]\r\n\r\nI am little accustomed, Gentlemen, to the part which I am now attempting\r\nto perform. Hardly more than once or twice has it happened to me to be\r\nconcerned on the side of the government in any criminal prosecution\r\nwhatever; and never, until the present occasion, in any case affecting\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut I very much regret that it should have been thought necessary to\r\nsuggest to you that I am brought here to \"hurry you against the law and\r\nbeyond the evidence.\" I hope I have too much regard for justice, and too\r\nmuch respect for my own character, to attempt either; and were I to make\r\nsuch attempt, I am sure that in this court nothing can be carried\r\nagainst the law, and that gentlemen, intelligent and just as you are,\r\nare not, by any power, to be hurried beyond the evidence. Though I could\r\nwell have wished to shun this occasion, I have not felt at liberty to\r\nwithhold my professional assistance, when it is supposed that I may be\r\nin some degree useful in investigating and discovering the truth\r\nrespecting this most extraordinary murder. It has seemed to be a duty\r\nincumbent on me, as on every other citizen, to do my best and my utmost\r\nto bring to light the perpetrators of this crime. Against the prisoner\r\nat the bar, as an individual, I cannot have the slightest prejudice. I\r\nwould not do him the smallest injury or injustice. But I do not affect\r\nto be indifferent to the discovery and the punishment of this deep\r\nguilt. I cheerfully share in the opprobrium, how great soever it may be,\r\nwhich is cast on those who feel and manifest an anxious concern that all\r\nwho had a part in planning, or a hand in executing, this deed of\r\nmidnight assassination, may be brought to answer for their enormous\r\ncrime at the bar of public justice.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is a most extraordinary case. In some respects, it has\r\nhardly a precedent anywhere; certainly none in our New England history.\r\nThis bloody drama exhibited no suddenly excited, ungovernable rage. The\r\nactors in it were not surprised by any lion-like temptation springing\r\nupon their virtue, and overcoming it, before resistance could begin. Nor\r\ndid they do the deed to glut savage vengeance, or satiate long-settled\r\nand deadly hate. It was a cool, calculating, money-making murder. It was\r\nall \"hire and salary, not revenge.\" It was the weighing of money against\r\nlife; the counting out of so many pieces of silver against so many\r\nounces of blood.\r\n\r\nAn aged man, without an enemy in the world, in his own house, and in his\r\nown bed, is made the victim of a butcherly murder, for mere pay. Truly,\r\nhere is a new lesson for painters and poets. Whoever shall hereafter\r\ndraw the portrait of murder, if he will show it as it has been\r\nexhibited, where such example was last to have been looked for, in the\r\nvery bosom of our New England society, let him not give it the grim\r\nvisage of Moloch, the brow knitted by revenge, the face black with\r\nsettled hate, and the bloodshot eye emitting livid fires of malice. Let\r\nhim draw, rather, a decorous, smooth-faced, bloodless demon; a picture\r\nin repose, rather than in action; not so much an example of human nature\r\nin its depravity, and in its paroxysms of crime, as an infernal being, a\r\nfiend, in the ordinary display and development of his character.\r\n\r\nThe deed was executed with a degree of self-possession and steadiness\r\nequal to the wickedness with which it was planned. The circumstances now\r\nclearly in evidence spread out the whole scene before us. Deep sleep had\r\nfallen on the destined victim, and on all beneath his roof. A healthful\r\nold man, to whom sleep was sweet, the first sound slumbers of the night\r\nheld him in their soft but strong embrace. The assassin enters, through\r\nthe window already prepared, into an unoccupied apartment. With\r\nnoiseless foot he paces the lonely hall, half lighted by the moon; he\r\nwinds up the ascent of the stairs, and reaches the door of the chamber.\r\nOf this, he moves the lock, by soft and continued pressure, till it\r\nturns on its hinges without noise; and he enters, and beholds his victim\r\nbefore him. The room is uncommonly open to the admission of light. The\r\nface of the innocent sleeper is turned from the murderer, and the beams\r\nof the moon, resting on the gray locks of his aged temple, show him\r\nwhere to strike. The fatal blow is given! and the victim passes, without\r\na struggle or a motion, from the repose of sleep to the repose of death!\r\nIt is the assassin's purpose to make sure work; and he plies the dagger,\r\nthough it is obvious that life has been destroyed by the blow of the\r\nbludgeon. He even raises the aged arm, that he may not fail in his aim\r\nat the heart, and replaces it again over the wounds of the poniard! To\r\nfinish the picture, he explores the wrist for the pulse! He feels for\r\nit, and ascertains that it beats no longer! It is accomplished. The deed\r\nis done. He retreats, retraces his steps to the window, passes out\r\nthrough it as he came in, and escapes. He has done the murder. No eye\r\nhas seen him, no ear has heard him. The secret is his own, and it is\r\nsafe!\r\n\r\nAh! Gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a secret can be safe\r\nnowhere. The whole creation of God has neither nook nor corner where the\r\nguilty can bestow it, and say it is safe. Not to speak of that eye which\r\npierces through all disguises, and beholds every thing as in the\r\nsplendor of noon, such secrets of guilt are never safe from detection,\r\neven by men. True it is, generally speaking, that \"murder will out.\"\r\nTrue it is, that Providence hath so ordained, and doth so govern things,\r\nthat those who break the great law of Heaven by shedding man's blood\r\nseldom succeed in avoiding discovery. Especially, in a case exciting so\r\nmuch attention as this, discovery must come, and will come, sooner or\r\nlater. A thousand eyes turn at once to explore every man, every thing,\r\nevery circumstance, connected with the time and place; a thousand ears\r\ncatch every whisper; a thousand excited minds intensely dwell on the\r\nscene, shedding all their light, and ready to kindle the slightest\r\ncircumstance into a blaze of discovery. Meantime the guilty soul cannot\r\nkeep its own secret. It is false to itself; or rather it feels an\r\nirresistible impulse of conscience to be true to itself. It labors under\r\nits guilty possession, and knows not what to do with it. The human heart\r\nwas not made for the residence of such an inhabitant. It finds itself\r\npreyed on by a torment, which it dares not acknowledge to God or man. A\r\nvulture is devouring it, and it can ask no sympathy or assistance,\r\neither from heaven or earth. The secret which the murderer possesses\r\nsoon comes to possess him; and, like the evil spirits of which we read,\r\nit overcomes him, and leads him whithersoever it will. He feels it\r\nbeating at his heart, rising to his throat, and demanding disclosure. He\r\nthinks the whole world sees it in his face, reads it in his eyes, and\r\nalmost hears its workings in the very silence of his thoughts. It has\r\nbecome his master. It betrays his discretion, it breaks down his\r\ncourage, it conquers his prudence. When suspicions from without begin to\r\nembarrass him, and the net of circumstance to entangle him, the fatal\r\nsecret struggles with still greater violence to burst forth. It must be\r\nconfessed, it will be confessed; there is no refuge from confession but\r\nsuicide, and suicide is confession.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said, on this occasion, of the excitement which has\r\nexisted, and still exists, and of the extraordinary measures taken to\r\ndiscover and punish the guilty. No doubt there has been, and is, much\r\nexcitement, and strange indeed it would be had it been otherwise. Should\r\nnot all the peaceable and well-disposed naturally feel concerned, and\r\nnaturally exert themselves to bring to punishment the authors of this\r\nsecret assassination? Was it a thing to be slept upon or forgotten? Did\r\nyou, Gentlemen, sleep quite as quietly in your beds after this murder as\r\nbefore? Was it not a case for rewards, for meetings, for committees, for\r\nthe united efforts of all the good, to find out a band of murderous\r\nconspirators, of midnight ruffians, and to bring them to the bar of\r\njustice and law? If this be excitement, is it an unnatural or an\r\nimproper excitement?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, Gentlemen, that there are appearances of another\r\nfeeling, of a very different nature and character; not very extensive, I\r\nwould hope, but still there is too much evidence of its existence. Such\r\nis human nature, that some persons lose their abhorrence of crime in\r\ntheir admiration of its magnificent exhibitions. Ordinary vice is\r\nreprobated by them, but extraordinary guilt, exquisite wickedness, the\r\nhigh flights and poetry of crime, seize on the imagination, and lead\r\nthem to forget the depths of the guilt, in admiration of the excellence\r\nof the performance, or the unequalled atrocity of the purpose. There are\r\nthose in our day who have made great use of this infirmity of our\r\nnature, and by means of it done infinite injury to the cause of good\r\nmorals. They have affected not only the taste, but I fear also the\r\nprinciples, of the young, the heedless, and the imaginative, by the\r\nexhibition of interesting and beautiful monsters. They render depravity\r\nattractive, sometimes by the polish of its manners, and sometimes by its\r\nvery extravagance; and study to show off crime under all the advantages\r\nof cleverness and dexterity. Gentlemen, this is an extraordinary murder,\r\nbut it is still a murder. We are not to lose ourselves in wonder at its\r\norigin, or in gazing on its cool and skilful execution. We are to detect\r\nand to punish it; and while we proceed with caution against the\r\nprisoner, and are to be sure that we do not visit on his head the\r\noffences of others, we are yet to consider that we are dealing with a\r\ncase of most atrocious crime, which has not the slightest circumstance\r\nabout it to soften its enormity. It is murder; deliberate, concerted,\r\nmalicious murder.\r\n\r\nAlthough the interest of this case may have diminished by the repeated\r\ninvestigation of the facts; still, the additional labor which it imposes\r\nupon all concerned is not to be regretted, if it should result in\r\nremoving all doubts of the guilt of the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe learned counsel for the prisoner has said truly, that it is your\r\nindividual duty to judge the prisoner; that it is your individual duty\r\nto determine his guilt or innocence; and that you are to weigh the\r\ntestimony with candor and fairness. But much at the same time has been\r\nsaid, which, although it would seem to have no distinct bearing on the\r\ntrial, cannot be passed over without some notice.\r\n\r\nA tone of complaint so peculiar has been indulged, as would almost lead\r\nus to doubt whether the prisoner at the bar, or the managers of this\r\nprosecution, are now on trial. Great pains have been taken to complain\r\nof the manner of the prosecution. We hear of getting up a case; of\r\nsetting in motion trains of machinery; of foul testimony; of\r\ncombinations to overwhelm the prisoner; of private prosecutors; that the\r\nprisoner is hunted, persecuted, driven to his trial; that everybody is\r\nagainst him; and various other complaints, as if those who would bring\r\nto punishment the authors of this murder were almost as bad as they who\r\ncommitted it.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my whole life, I have never heard before so much said\r\nabout the particular counsel who happen to be employed; as if it were\r\nextraordinary that other counsel than the usual officers of the\r\ngovernment should assist in the management of a case on the part of the\r\ngovernment. In one of the last criminal trials in this county, that of\r\nJackman for the \"Goodridge robbery\" (so called), I remember that the\r\nlearned head of the Suffolk Bar, Mr. Prescott, came down in aid of the\r\nofficers of the government. This was regarded as neither strange nor\r\nimproper. The counsel for the prisoner, in that case, contented\r\nthemselves with answering his arguments, as far as they were able,\r\ninstead of carping at his presence.\r\n\r\nComplaint is made that rewards were offered, in this case, and\r\ntemptations held out to obtain testimony. Are not rewards always\r\noffered, when great and secret offences are committed? Rewards were\r\noffered in the case to which I have alluded; and every other means taken\r\nto discover the offenders, that ingenuity or the most persevering\r\nvigilance could suggest. The learned counsel have suffered their zeal to\r\nlead them into a strain of complaint at the manner in which the\r\nperpetrators of this crime were detected, almost indicating that they\r\nregard it as a positive injury to them to have found out their guilt.\r\nSince no man witnessed it, since they do not now confess it, attempts to\r\ndiscover it are half esteemed as officious intermeddling and impertinent\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that here even a Committee of Vigilance was appointed. This\r\nis a subject of reiterated remark. This committee are pointed at, as\r\nthough they had been officiously intermeddling with the administration\r\nof justice. They are said to have been \"laboring for months\" against the\r\nprisoner. Gentlemen, what must we do in such a case? Are people to be\r\ndumb and still, through fear of overdoing? Is it come to this, that an\r\neffort cannot be made, a hand cannot be lifted, to discover the guilty,\r\nwithout its being said there is a combination to overwhelm innocence?\r\nHas the community lost all moral sense? Certainly, a community that\r\nwould not be roused to action upon an occasion such as this was, a\r\ncommunity which should not deny sleep to their eyes, and slumber to\r\ntheir eyelids, till they had exhausted all the means of discovery and\r\ndetection, must indeed be lost to all moral sense, and would scarcely\r\ndeserve protection from the laws. The learned counsel have endeavored to\r\npersuade you, that there exists a prejudice against the persons accused\r\nof this murder. They would have you understand that it is not confined\r\nto this vicinity alone; but that even the legislature have caught this\r\nspirit. That through the procurement of the gentleman here styled\r\nprivate prosecutor, who is a member of the Senate, a special session of\r\nthis court was appointed for the trial of these offenders. That the\r\nordinary movements of the wheels of justice were too slow for the\r\npurposes devised. But does not everybody see and know, that it was\r\nmatter of absolute necessity to have a special session of the court?\r\nWhen or how could the prisoners have been tried without a special\r\nsession? In the ordinary arrangement of the courts, but one week in a\r\nyear is allotted for the whole court to sit in this county. In the trial\r\nof all capital offences a majority of the court, at least, is required\r\nto be present. In the trial of the present case alone, three weeks have\r\nalready been taken up. Without such special session, then, three years\r\nwould not have been sufficient for the purpose. It is answer sufficient\r\nto all complaints on this subject to say, that the law was drawn by the\r\nlate Chief Justice himself,[1] to enable the court to accomplish its\r\nduties, and to afford the persons accused an opportunity for trial\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is said that it was not thought of making Francis Knapp, the\r\nprisoner at the bar, a PRINCIPAL till after the death of Richard\r\nCrowninshield, Jr.; that the present indictment is an after-thought;\r\nthat \"testimony was got up\" for the occasion. It is not so. There is no\r\nauthority for this suggestion. The case of the Knapps had not then been\r\nbefore the grand jury. The officers of the government did not know what\r\nthe testimony would be against them. They could not, therefore, have\r\ndetermined what course they should pursue. They intended to arraign all\r\nas principals who should appear to have been principals, and all as\r\naccessories who should appear to have been accessories. All this could\r\nbe known only when the evidence should be produced.\r\n\r\nBut the learned counsel for the defendant take a somewhat loftier flight\r\nstill. They are more concerned, they assure us, for the law itself, than\r\neven for their client. Your decision in this case, they say, will stand\r\nas a precedent. Gentlemen, we hope it will. We hope it will be a\r\nprecedent both of candor and intelligence, of fairness and of firmness;\r\na precedent of good sense and honest purpose pursuing their\r\ninvestigation discreetly, rejecting loose generalities, exploring all\r\nthe circumstances, weighing each, in search of truth, and embracing and\r\ndeclaring the truth when found.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that \"laws are made, not for the punishment of the guilty,\r\nbut for the protection of the innocent.\" This is not quite accurate,\r\nperhaps, but if so, we hope they will be so administered as to give that\r\nprotection. But who are the innocent whom the law would protect?\r\nGentlemen, Joseph White was innocent. They are innocent who, having\r\nlived in the fear of God through the day, wish to sleep in his peace\r\nthrough the night, in their own beds. The law is established that those\r\nwho live quietly may sleep quietly; that they who do no harm may feel\r\nnone. The gentleman can think of none that are innocent except the\r\nprisoner at the bar, not yet convicted. Is a proved conspirator to\r\nmurder innocent? Are the Crowninshields and the Knapps innocent? What is\r\ninnocence? How deep stained with blood, how reckless in crime, how deep\r\nin depravity may it be, and yet retain innocence? The law is made, if we\r\nwould speak with entire accuracy, to protect the innocent by punishing\r\nthe guilty. But there are those innocent out of a court, as well as in;\r\ninnocent citizens not suspected of crime, as well as innocent prisoners\r\nat the bar. The criminal law is not founded in a principle of vengeance.\r\nIt does not punish that it may inflict suffering. The humanity of the\r\nlaw feels and regrets every pain it causes, every hour of restraint it\r\nimposes, and more deeply still every life it forfeits. But it uses evil\r\nas the means of preventing greater evil. It seeks to deter from crime by\r\nthe example of punishment. This is its true, and only true main object.\r\nIt restrains the liberty of the few offenders, that the many who do not\r\noffend may enjoy their liberty. It takes the life of the murderer, that\r\nother murders may not be committed. The law might open the jails, and at\r\nonce set free all persons accused of offences, and it ought to do so if\r\nit could be made certain that no other offences would hereafter be\r\ncommitted, because it punishes, not to satisfy any desire to inflict\r\npain, but simply to prevent the repetition of crimes. When the guilty,\r\ntherefore, are not punished, the law has so far failed of its purpose;\r\nthe safety of the innocent is so far endangered. Every unpunished\r\nmurder takes away something from the security of every man's life.\r\nWhenever a jury, through whimsical and ill-founded scruples, suffer the\r\nguilty to escape, they make themselves answerable for the augmented\r\ndanger of the innocent.\r\n\r\nWe wish nothing to be strained against this defendant. Why, then, all\r\nthis alarm? Why all this complaint against the manner in which the crime\r\nis discovered? The prisoner's counsel catch at supposed flaws of\r\nevidence, or bad character of witnesses, without meeting the case. Do\r\nthey mean to deny the conspiracy? Do they mean to deny that the two\r\nCrowninshields and the two Knapps were conspirators? Why do they rail\r\nagainst Palmer, while they do not disprove, and hardly dispute, the\r\ntruth of any one fact sworn to by him? Instead of this, it is made\r\nmatter of sentimentality that Palmer has been prevailed upon to betray\r\nhis bosom companions and to violate the sanctity of friendship. Again I\r\nask, Why do they not meet the case? If the fact is out, why not meet it?\r\nDo they mean to deny that Captain White is dead? One would have almost\r\nsupposed even that, from some remarks that have been made. Do they mean\r\nto deny the conspiracy? Or, admitting a conspiracy, do they mean to deny\r\nonly that Frank Knapp, the prisoner at the bar, was abetting in the\r\nmurder, being present, and so deny that he was a principal? If a\r\nconspiracy is proved, it bears closely upon every subsequent subject of\r\ninquiry. Why do they not come to the fact? Here the defence is wholly\r\nindistinct. The counsel neither take the ground, nor abandon it. They\r\nneither fly, nor light. They hover. But they must come to a closer mode\r\nof contest. They must meet the facts, and either deny or admit them. Had\r\nthe prisoner at the bar, then, a knowledge of this conspiracy or not?\r\nThis is the question. Instead of laying out their strength in\r\ncomplaining of the _manner_ in which the deed is discovered, of the\r\nextraordinary pains taken to bring the prisoner's guilt to light, would\r\nit not be better to show there was no guilt? Would it not be better to\r\nshow his innocence? They say, and they complain, that the community feel\r\na great desire that he should be punished for his crimes. Would it not\r\nbe better to convince you that he has committed no crime?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, let us now come to the case. Your first inquiry, on the\r\nevidence, will be, Was Captain White murdered in pursuance of a\r\nconspiracy, and was the defendant one of this conspiracy? If so, the\r\nsecond inquiry is, Was he so connected with the murder itself as that he\r\nis liable to be convicted as a _principal_? The defendant is indicted as\r\na _principal_. If not guilty _as such_, you cannot convict him. The\r\nindictment contains three distinct classes of counts. In the first, he\r\nis charged as having done the deed with his own hand; in the second, as\r\nan aider and abettor to Richard Crowninshield, Jr., who did the deed; in\r\nthe third, as an aider and abettor to some person unknown. If you\r\nbelieve him guilty on either of these counts, or in either of these\r\nways, you must convict him.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to say, as a preliminary remark, that there are two\r\nextraordinary circumstances attending this trial. One is, that Richard\r\nCrowninshield, Jr., the supposed immediate perpetrator of the murder,\r\nsince his arrest, has committed suicide. He has gone to answer before a\r\ntribunal of perfect infallibility. The other is, that Joseph Knapp, the\r\nsupposed originator and planner of the murder, having once made a full\r\ndisclosure of the facts, under a promise of indemnity, is, nevertheless,\r\nnot now a witness. Notwithstanding his disclosure and his promise of\r\nindemnity, he now refuses to testify. He chooses to return to his\r\noriginal state, and now stands answerable himself, when the time shall\r\ncome for his trial. These circumstances it is fit you should remember,\r\nin your investigation of the case.\r\n\r\nYour decision may affect more than the life of this defendant. If he be\r\nnot convicted as principal, no one can be. Nor can any one be convicted\r\nof a participation in the crime as accessory. The Knapps and George\r\nCrowninshield will be again on the community. This shows the importance\r\nof the duty you have to perform, and serves to remind you of the care\r\nand wisdom necessary to be exercised in its performance. But certainly\r\nthese considerations do not render the prisoner's guilt any clearer, nor\r\nenhance the weight of the evidence against him. No one desires you to\r\nregard consequences in that light. No one wishes any thing to be\r\nstrained, or too far pressed against the prisoner. Still, it is fit you\r\nshould see the full importance of the duty which devolves upon you.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Gentlemen, in examining this evidence, let us begin at the\r\nbeginning, and see first what we know independent of the disputed\r\ntestimony. This is a case of circumstantial evidence. And these\r\ncircumstances, we think, are full and satisfactory. The case mainly\r\ndepends upon them, and it is common that offences of this kind must be\r\nproved in this way. Midnight assassins take no witnesses. The evidence\r\nof the facts relied on has been somewhat sneeringly denominated, by the\r\nlearned counsel, \"circumstantial stuff,\" but it is not such stuff as\r\ndreams are made of. Why does he not rend this stuff? Why does he not\r\nscatter it to the winds? He dismisses it a little too summarily. It\r\nshall be my business to examine this stuff, and try its cohesion.\r\n\r\nThe letter from Palmer at Belfast, is that no more than flimsy stuff?\r\n\r\nThe fabricated letters from Knapp to the committee and to Mr. White, are\r\nthey nothing but stuff?\r\n\r\nThe circumstance, that the house-keeper was away at the time the murder\r\nwas committed, as it was agreed she would be, is that, too, a useless\r\npiece of the same stuff?\r\n\r\nThe facts, that the key of the chamber door was taken out and secreted;\r\nthat the window was unbarred and unbolted; are these to be so slightly\r\nand so easily disposed of?\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, Gentlemen, to settle now, at the commencement, the\r\ngreat question of a conspiracy. If there was none, or the defendant was\r\nnot a party, then there is no evidence here to convict him. If there was\r\na conspiracy, and he is proved to have been a party, then these two\r\nfacts have a strong bearing on others, and all the great points of\r\ninquiry. The defendant's counsel take no distinct ground, as I have\r\nalready said, on this point, either to admit or to deny. They choose to\r\nconfine themselves to a hypothetical mode of speech. They say, supposing\r\nthere was a conspiracy, _non sequitur_ that the prisoner is guilty as\r\nprincipal. Be it so. But still, if there was a conspiracy, and if he was\r\na conspirator, and helped to plan the murder, this may shed much light\r\non the evidence which goes to charge him with the execution of that\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nWe mean to make out the conspiracy; and that the defendant was a party\r\nto it; and then to draw all just inferences from these facts.\r\n\r\nLet me ask your attention, then, in the first place, to those\r\nappearances, on the morning after the murder, which have a tendency to\r\nshow that it was done in pursuance of a preconcerted plan of operation.\r\nWhat are they? A man was found murdered in his bed. No stranger had done\r\nthe deed, no one unacquainted with the house had done it. It was\r\napparent that somebody within had opened, and that somebody without had\r\nentered. There had obviously and certainly been concert and\r\nco-operation. The inmates of the house were not alarmed when the murder\r\nwas perpetrated. The assassin had entered without any riot or any\r\nviolence. He had found the way prepared before him. The house had been\r\npreviously opened. The window was unbarred from within, and its\r\nfastening unscrewed. There was a lock on the door of the chamber in\r\nwhich Mr. White slept, but the key was gone. It had been taken away and\r\nsecreted. The footsteps of the murderer were visible, out-doors, tending\r\ntoward the window. The plank by which he entered the window still\r\nremained. The road he pursued had been thus prepared for him. The victim\r\nwas slain, and the murderer had escaped. Every thing indicated that\r\nsomebody within had co-operated with somebody without. Every thing\r\nproclaimed that some of the inmates, or somebody having access to the\r\nhouse, had had a hand in the murder. On the face of the circumstances,\r\nit was apparent, therefore, that this was a premeditated, concerted\r\nmurder; that there had been a conspiracy to commit it. Who, then, were\r\nthe conspirators? If not now found out, we are still groping in the\r\ndark, and the whole tragedy is still a mystery.\r\n\r\nIf the Knapps and the Crowninshields were not the conspirators in this\r\nmurder, then there is a whole set of conspirators not yet discovered.\r\nBecause, independent of the testimony of Palmer and Leighton,\r\nindependent of all disputed evidence, we know, from uncontroverted\r\nfacts, that this murder was, and must have been, the result of concert\r\nand co-operation between two or more. We know it was not done without\r\nplan and deliberation; we see, that whoever entered the house, to strike\r\nthe blow, was favored and aided by some one who had been previously in\r\nthe house, without suspicion, and who had prepared the way. This is\r\nconcert, this is co-operation, this is conspiracy. If the Knapps and the\r\nCrowninshields, then, were not the conspirators, who were? Joseph Knapp\r\nhad a motive to desire the death of Mr. White, and that motive has been\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nHe was connected by marriage with the family of Mr. White. His wife was\r\nthe daughter of Mrs. Beckford, who was the only child of a sister of the\r\ndeceased. The deceased was more than eighty years old, and had no\r\nchildren. His only heirs were nephews and nieces. He was supposed to be\r\npossessed of a very large fortune, which would have descended, by law,\r\nto his several nephews and nieces in equal shares; or, if there was a\r\nwill, then according to the will. But as he had but two branches of\r\nheirs, the children of his brother, Henry White, and of Mrs. Beckford,\r\neach of these branches, according to the common idea, would have shared\r\none half of his property.\r\n\r\nThis popular idea is not legally correct. But it is common, and very\r\nprobably was entertained by the parties. According to this idea, Mrs.\r\nBeckford, on Mr. White's death without a will, would have been entitled\r\nto one half of his ample fortune; and Joseph Knapp had married one of\r\nher three children. There was a will, and this will gave the bulk of the\r\nproperty to others; and we learn from Palmer that one part of the design\r\nwas to destroy the will before the murder was committed. There had been\r\na previous will, and that previous will was known or believed to have\r\nbeen more favorable than the other to the Beckford family. So that, by\r\ndestroying the last will, and destroying the life of the testator at the\r\nsame time, either the first and more favorable will would be set up, or\r\nthe deceased would have no will, which would be, as was supposed, still\r\nmore favorable. But the conspirators not having succeeded in obtaining\r\nand destroying the last will, though they accomplished the murder, that\r\nwill being found in existence and safe, and that will bequeathing the\r\nmass of the property to others, it seemed at the time impossible for\r\nJoseph Knapp, as for any one else, indeed, but the principal devisee, to\r\nhave any motive which should lead to the murder. The key which unlocks\r\nthe whole mystery is the knowledge of the intention of the conspirators\r\nto steal the will. This is derived from Palmer, and it explains all. It\r\nsolves the whole marvel. It shows the motive which actuated those,\r\nagainst whom there is much evidence, but who, without the knowledge of\r\nthis intention, were not seen to have had a motive. This intention is\r\nproved, as I have said, by Palmer; and it is so congruous with all the\r\nrest of the case, it agrees so well with all facts and circumstances,\r\nthat no man could well withhold his belief, though the facts were stated\r\nby a still less credible witness. If one desirous of opening a lock\r\nturns over and tries a bunch of keys till he finds one that will open\r\nit, he naturally supposes he has found _the_ key of _that_ lock. So, in\r\nexplaining circumstances of evidence which are apparently irreconcilable\r\nor unaccountable, if a fact be suggested which at once accounts for all,\r\nand reconciles all, by whomsoever it may be stated, it is still\r\ndifficult not to believe that such fact is the true fact belonging to\r\nthe case. In this respect, Palmer's testimony is singularly confirmed.\r\nIf it were false, his ingenuity could not furnish us such clear\r\nexposition of strange appearing circumstances. Some truth not before\r\nknown can alone do that.\r\n\r\nWhen we look back, then, to the state of things immediately on the\r\ndiscovery of the murder, we see that suspicion would naturally turn at\r\nonce, not to the heirs at law, but to those principally benefited by the\r\nwill. They, and they alone, would be supposed or seem to have a direct\r\nobject for wishing Mr. White's life to be terminated. And, strange as it\r\nmay seem, we find counsel now insisting, that, if no apology, it is yet\r\nmitigation of the atrocity of the Knapps' conduct in attempting to\r\ncharge this foul murder on Mr. White, the nephew and principal devisee,\r\nthat public suspicion was already so directed! As if assassination of\r\ncharacter were excusable in proportion as circumstances may render it\r\neasy. Their endeavors, when they knew they were suspected themselves, to\r\nfix the charge on others, by foul means and by falsehood, are fair and\r\nstrong proof of their own guilt. But more of that hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe counsel say that they might safely admit that Richard Crowninshield,\r\nJr. was the perpetrator of this murder.\r\n\r\nBut how could they safely admit that? If that were admitted, every thing\r\nelse would follow. For why should Richard Crowninshield, Jr. kill Mr.\r\nWhite? He was not his heir, nor his devisee; nor was he his enemy. What\r\ncould be his motive? If Richard Crowninshield, Jr. killed Mr. White, he\r\ndid it at some one's procurement who himself had a motive. And who,\r\nhaving any motive, is shown to have had any intercourse with Richard\r\nCrowninshield, Jr., but Joseph Knapp, and this principally through the\r\nagency of the prisoner at the bar? It is the infirmity, the distressing\r\ndifficulty of the prisoner's case, that his counsel cannot and dare not\r\nadmit what they yet cannot disprove, and what all must believe. He who\r\nbelieves, on this evidence, that Richard Crowninshield, Jr. was the\r\nimmediate murderer, cannot doubt that both the Knapps were conspirators\r\nin that murder. The counsel, therefore, are wrong, I think, in saying\r\nthey might safely admit this. The admission of so important and so\r\nconnected a fact would render it impossible to contend further against\r\nthe proof of the entire conspiracy, as we state it.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was this conspiracy? J.J. Knapp, Jr., desirous of destroying\r\nthe will, and of taking the life of the deceased, hired a ruffian, who,\r\nwith the aid of other ruffians, was to enter the house, and murder him\r\nin his bed.\r\n\r\nAs far back as January this conspiracy began. Endicott testifies to a\r\nconversation with J.J. Knapp at that time, in which Knapp told him that\r\nCaptain White had made a will, and given the principal part of his\r\nproperty to Stephen White. When asked how he knew, he said, \"Black and\r\nwhite don't lie.\" When asked if the will was not locked up, he said,\r\n\"There is such a thing as two keys to the same lock.\" And speaking of\r\nthe then late illness of Captain White, he said, that Stephen White\r\nwould not have been sent for if _he_ had been there.\r\n\r\nHence it appears, that as early as January Knapp had a knowledge of the\r\nwill, and that he had access to it by means of false keys. This\r\nknowledge of the will, and an intent to destroy it, appear also from\r\nPalmer's testimony, a fact disclosed to him by the other conspirators.\r\nHe says that he was informed of this by the Crowninshields on the 2d of\r\nApril. But then it is said, that Palmer is not to be credited; that by\r\nhis own confession he is a felon; that he has been in the State prison\r\nin Maine; and, above all, that he was intimately associated with these\r\nconspirators themselves. Let us admit these facts. Let us admit him to\r\nbe as bad as they would represent him to be; still, in law, he is a\r\ncompetent witness. How else are the secret designs of the wicked to be\r\nproved, but by their wicked companions, to whom they have disclosed\r\nthem? The government does not select its witnesses. The conspirators\r\nthemselves have chosen Palmer. He was the confidant of the prisoners.\r\nThe fact, however, does not depend on his testimony alone. It is\r\ncorroborated by other proof; and, taken in connection with the other\r\ncircumstances, it has strong probability. In regard to the testimony of\r\nPalmer, generally, it may be said that it is less contradicted, in all\r\nparts of it, either by himself or others, than that of any other\r\nmaterial witness, and that every thing he has told is corroborated by\r\nother evidence, so far as it is susceptible of confirmation. An attempt\r\nhas been made to impair his testimony, as to his being at the Half-way\r\nHouse on the night of the murder; you have seen with what success. Mr.\r\nBabb is called to contradict him. You have seen how little he knows, and\r\neven that not certainly; for he himself is proved to have been in an\r\nerror by supposing Palmer to have been at the Half-way House on the\r\nevening of the 9th of April. At that time he is proved to have been at\r\nDustin's, in Danvers. If, then, Palmer, bad as he is, has disclosed the\r\nsecrets of the conspiracy, and has told the truth, there is no reason\r\nwhy it should not be believed. Truth is truth, come whence it may.\r\n\r\nThe facts show that this murder had been long in agitation; that it was\r\nnot a new proposition on the 2d of April; that it had been contemplated\r\nfor five or six weeks. Richard Crowninshield was at Wenham in the latter\r\npart of March, as testified by Starrett. Frank Knapp was at Danvers in\r\nthe latter part of February, as testified by Allen. Richard\r\nCrowninshield inquired whether Captain Knapp was about home, when at\r\nWenham. The probability is, that they would open the case to Palmer as a\r\nnew project. There are other circumstances that show it to have been\r\nsome weeks in agitation. Palmer's testimony as to the transaction on the\r\n2d of April is corroborated by Allen, and by Osborn's books. He says\r\nthat Frank Knapp came there in the afternoon, and again in the evening.\r\nSo the book shows. He says that Captain White had gone out to his farm\r\non that day. So others prove. How could this fact, or these facts, have\r\nbeen known to Palmer, unless Frank Knapp had brought the knowledge? And\r\nwas it not the special object of this visit to give information of this\r\nfact, that they might meet him and execute their purpose on his return\r\nfrom his farm? The letter of Palmer, written at Belfast, bears intrinsic\r\nmarks of genuineness. It was mailed at Belfast, May 13th. It states\r\nfacts that he could not have known, unless his testimony be true. This\r\nletter was not an after-thought; it is a genuine narrative. In fact, it\r\nsays, \"I know the business your brother Frank was transacting on the 2d\r\nof April.\" How could he have possibly known this, unless he had been\r\nthere? The \"one thousand dollars that was to be paid,\"--where could he\r\nhave obtained this knowledge? The testimony of Endicott, of Palmer, and\r\nthese facts, are to be taken together; and they most clearly show that\r\nthe death of Captain White was caused by somebody interested in putting\r\nan end to his life.\r\n\r\nAs to the testimony of Leighton, as far as manner of testifying goes, he\r\nis a bad witness; but it does not follow from this that he is not to be\r\nbelieved. There are some strange things about him. It is strange, that\r\nhe should make up a story against Captain Knapp, the person with whom he\r\nlived; that he never voluntarily told any thing: all that he has said\r\nwas screwed out of him. But the story could not have been invented by\r\nhim; his character for truth is unimpeached; and he intimated to another\r\nwitness, soon after the murder happened, that he knew something he\r\nshould not tell. There is not the least contradiction in his testimony,\r\nthough he gives a poor account of withholding it. He says that he was\r\nextremely _bothered_ by those who questioned him. In the main story that\r\nhe relates, he is entirely consistent with himself. Some things are for\r\nhim, and some against him. Examine the intrinsic probability of what he\r\nsays. See if some allowance is not to be made for him, on account of\r\nhis ignorance of things of this kind. It is said to be extraordinary,\r\nthat he should have heard just so much of the conversation, and no more;\r\nthat he should have heard just what was necessary to be proved, and\r\nnothing else. Admit that this is extraordinary; still, this does not\r\nprove it untrue. It is extraordinary that you twelve gentlemen should be\r\ncalled upon, out of all the men in the county, to decide this case; no\r\none could have foretold this three weeks since. It is extraordinary that\r\nthe first clew to this conspiracy should have been derived from\r\ninformation given by the father of the prisoner at the bar. And in every\r\ncase that comes to trial there are many things extraordinary. The murder\r\nitself is a most extraordinary one; but still we do not doubt its\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nIt is argued, that this conversation between Joseph and Frank could not\r\nhave been as Leighton has testified, because they had been together for\r\nseveral hours before; this subject must have been uppermost in their\r\nminds, whereas this appears to have been the commencement of their\r\nconversation upon it. Now this depends altogether upon the tone and\r\nmanner of the expression; upon the particular word in the sentence which\r\nwas emphatically spoken. If he had said, \"When did you _see_ Dick,\r\nFrank?\" this would not seem to be the beginning of the conversation.\r\nWith what emphasis it was uttered, it is not possible to learn; and\r\ntherefore nothing can be made of this argument. If this boy's testimony\r\nstood alone, it should be received with caution. And the same may be\r\nsaid of the testimony of Palmer. But they do not stand alone. They\r\nfurnish a clew to numerous other circumstances, which, when known,\r\nmutually confirm what would have been received with caution without such\r\ncorroboration. How could Leighton have made up this conversation? \"When\r\ndid you see Dick?\" \"I saw him this morning.\" \"When is he going to kill\r\nthe old man?\" \"I don't know.\" \"Tell him, if he don't do it soon, I won't\r\npay him.\" Here is a vast amount in few words. Had he wit enough to\r\ninvent this? There is nothing so powerful as truth; and often nothing so\r\nstrange. It is not ever suggested that the story was made for him. There\r\nis nothing so extraordinary in the whole matter, as it would have been\r\nfor this ignorant country boy to invent this story.\r\n\r\nThe acts of the parties themselves furnish strong presumption of their\r\nguilt. What was done on the receipt of the letter from Maine? This\r\nletter was signed by Charles Grant, Jr., a person not known to either of\r\nthe Knapps, nor was it known to them that any other person beside the\r\nCrowninshields knew of the conspiracy. This letter, by the accidental\r\nomission of the word Jr., fell into the hands of the father, when\r\nintended for the son. The father carried it to Wenham, where both the\r\nsons were. They both read it. Fix your eye steadily on this part of the\r\n_circumstantial stuff_ which is in the case, and see what can be made of\r\nit. This was shown to the two brothers on Saturday, the 15th of May.\r\nNeither of them knew Palmer. And if they had known him, they could not\r\nhave known him to have been the writer of this letter. It was mysterious\r\nto them how any one at Belfast could have had knowledge of this affair.\r\nTheir conscious guilt prevented due circumspection. They did not see the\r\nbearing of its publication. They advised their father to carry it to the\r\nCommittee of Vigilance, and it was so carried. On the Sunday following,\r\nJoseph began to think there might be something in it. Perhaps, in the\r\nmean time, he had seen one of the Crowninshields. He was apprehensive\r\nthat they might be suspected; he was anxious to turn attention from\r\ntheir family. What course did he adopt to effect this? He addressed one\r\nletter, with a false name, to Mr. White, and another to the Committee;\r\nand to complete the climax of his folly, he signed the letter addressed\r\nto the Committee, \"Grant,\" the same name as that which was signed to the\r\nletter received from Belfast. It was in the knowledge of the Committee,\r\nthat no person but the Knapps had seen this letter from Belfast; and\r\nthat no other person knew its signature. It therefore must have been\r\nirresistibly plain to them that one of the Knapps was the writer of the\r\nletter received by the Committee, charging the murder on Mr. White. Add\r\nto this the fact of its having been dated at Lynn, and mailed at Salem\r\nfour days after it was dated, and who could doubt respecting it? Have\r\nyou ever read or known of folly equal to this? Can you conceive of crime\r\nmore odious and abominable? Merely to explain the apparent mysteries of\r\nthe letter from Palmer, they excite the basest suspicions against a man,\r\nwhom, if they were innocent, they had no reason to believe guilty; and\r\nwhom, if they were guilty, they most certainly knew to be innocent.\r\nCould they have adopted a more direct method of exposing their own\r\ninfamy? The letter to the Committee has intrinsic marks of a knowledge\r\nof this transaction. It tells the _time_ and the _manner_ in which the\r\nmurder was committed. Every line speaks the writer's condemnation. In\r\nattempting to divert attention from his family, and to charge the guilt\r\nupon another, he indelibly fixes it upon himself.\r\n\r\nJoseph Knapp requested Allen to put these letters into the post-office,\r\nbecause, said he, \"I wish to nip this silly affair in the bud.\" If this\r\nwere not the order of an overruling Providence, I should say that it was\r\nthe silliest piece of folly that was ever practised. Mark the destiny of\r\ncrime. It is ever obliged to resort to such subterfuges; it trembles in\r\nthe broad light; it betrays itself in seeking concealment. He alone\r\nwalks safely who walks uprightly. Who for a moment can read these\r\nletters and doubt of Joseph Knapp's guilt? The constitution of nature is\r\nmade to inform against him. There is no corner dark enough to conceal\r\nhim. There is no turnpike-road broad enough or smooth enough for a man\r\nso guilty to walk in without stumbling. Every step proclaims his secret\r\nto every passenger. His own acts come out to fix his guilt. In\r\nattempting to charge another with his own crime, he writes his own\r\nconfession. To do away the effect of Palmer's letter, signed Grant, he\r\nwrites a letter himself and affixes to it the name of Grant. He writes\r\nin a disguised hand; but could it happen that the same Grant should be\r\nin Salem that was at Belfast? This has brought the whole thing out.\r\nEvidently he did it, because he has adopted the same style. Evidently he\r\ndid it, because he speaks of the price of blood, and of other\r\ncircumstances connected with the murder, that no one but a conspirator\r\ncould have known.\r\n\r\nPalmer says he made a visit to the Crowninshields, on the 9th of April.\r\nGeorge then asked him whether he had heard of the murder. Richard\r\ninquired whether he had heard the music at Salem. They said that they\r\nwere suspected, that a committee had been appointed to search houses;\r\nand that they had melted up the dagger, the day after the murder,\r\nbecause it would be a suspicious circumstance to have it found in their\r\npossession. Now this committee was not appointed, in fact, until Friday\r\nevening. But this proves nothing against Palmer; it does not prove that\r\nGeorge did not tell him so; it only proves that he gave a false reason\r\nfor a fact. They had heard that they were suspected; how could they have\r\nheard this, unless it were from the whisperings of their own\r\nconsciences? Surely this rumor was not then public.\r\n\r\nAbout the 27th of April, another attempt was made by the Knapps to give\r\na direction to public suspicion. They reported themselves to have been\r\nrobbed, in passing from Salem to Wenham, near Wenham Pond. They came to\r\nSalem and stated the particulars of the adventure. They described\r\npersons, their dress, size, and appearance, who had been suspected of\r\nthe murder. They would have it understood that the community was\r\ninfested by a band of ruffians, and that they themselves were the\r\nparticular objects of their vengeance. Now this turns out to be all\r\nfictitious, all false. Can you conceive of any thing more enormous, any\r\nwickedness greater, than the circulation of such reports? than the\r\nallegation of crimes, if committed, capital? If no such crime had been\r\ncommitted, then it reacts with double force upon themselves, and goes\r\nvery far to show their guilt. How did they conduct themselves on this\r\noccasion? Did they make hue and cry? Did they give information that they\r\nhad been assaulted that night at Wenham? No such thing. They rested\r\nquietly that night; they waited to be called on for the particulars of\r\ntheir adventure; they made no attempt to arrest the offenders; this was\r\nnot their object. They were content to fill the thousand mouths of\r\nrumor, to spread abroad false reports, to divert the attention of the\r\npublic from themselves; for they thought every man suspected them,\r\nbecause they knew they ought to be suspected.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the compensation for this murder was paid is a\r\ncircumstance worthy of consideration. By examining the facts and dates,\r\nit will satisfactorily appear that Joseph Knapp paid a sum of money to\r\nRichard Crowninshield, in five-franc pieces, on the 24th of April. On\r\nthe 21st of April, Joseph Knapp received five hundred five-franc pieces,\r\nas the proceeds of an adventure at sea. The remainder of this species of\r\ncurrency that came home in the vessel was deposited in a bank at Salem.\r\nOn Saturday, the 24th of April, Frank and Richard rode to Wenham. They\r\nwere there with Joseph an hour or more, and appeared to be negotiating\r\nprivate business. Richard continued in the chaise; Joseph came to the\r\nchaise and conversed with him. These facts are proved by Hart and\r\nLeighton, and by Osborn's books. On Saturday evening, about this time,\r\nRichard Crowninshield is proved, by Lummus, to have been at Wenham, with\r\nanother person whose appearance corresponds with Frank's. Can any one\r\ndoubt this being the same evening? What had Richard Crowninshield to do\r\nat Wenham, with Joseph, unless it were this business? He was there\r\nbefore the murder; he was there after the murder; he was there\r\nclandestinely, unwilling to be seen. If it were not upon this business,\r\nlet it be told what it was for. Joseph Knapp could explain it; Frank\r\nKnapp might explain it. But they do not explain it; and the inference is\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this, Richard passes five-franc pieces; on the same\r\nevening, one to Lummus, five to Palmer; and near this time George passes\r\nthree or four in Salem. Here are nine of these pieces passed by them in\r\nfour days; this is extraordinary. It is an unusual currency; in ordinary\r\nbusiness, few men would pass nine such pieces in the course of a year.\r\nIf they were not received in this way, why not explain how they came by\r\nthem? Money was not so flush in their pockets that they could not tell\r\nwhence it came, if it honestly came there. It is extremely important to\r\nthem to explain whence this money came, and they would do it if they\r\ncould. If, then, the price of blood was paid at this time, in the\r\npresence and with the knowledge of this defendant, does not this prove\r\nhim to have been connected with this conspiracy?\r\n\r\nObserve, also, the effect on the mind of Richard of Palmer's being\r\narrested and committed to prison; the various efforts he makes to\r\ndiscover the fact; the lowering, through the crevices of the rock, the\r\npencil and paper for him to write upon; the sending two lines of poetry,\r\nwith the request that he would return the corresponding lines; the\r\nshrill and peculiar whistle; the inimitable exclamations of \"Palmer!\r\nPalmer! Palmer!\" All these things prove how great was his alarm; they\r\ncorroborate Palmer's story, and tend to establish the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nJoseph Knapp had a part to act in this matter. He must have opened the\r\nwindow, and secreted the key; he had free access to every part of the\r\nhouse; he was accustomed to visit there; he went in and out at his\r\npleasure; he could do this without being suspected. He is proved to have\r\nbeen there the Saturday preceding.\r\n\r\nIf all these things, taken in connection, do not prove that Captain\r\nWhite was murdered in pursuance of a conspiracy, then the case is at an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nSavary's testimony is wholly unexpected. He was called for a different\r\npurpose. When asked who the person was that he saw come out of Captain\r\nWhite's yard between three and four o'clock in the morning, he answered,\r\nFrank Knapp. It is not clear that this is not true. There may be many\r\ncircumstances of importance connected with this, though we believe the\r\nmurder to have been committed between ten and eleven o'clock. The letter\r\nto Dr. Barstow states it to have been done about eleven o'clock; it\r\nstates it to have been done with a blow on the head, from a weapon\r\nloaded with lead. Here is too great a correspondence with the reality\r\nnot to have some meaning in it. Dr. Peirson was always of the opinion,\r\nthat the two classes of wounds were made with different instruments, and\r\nby different hands. It is possible that one class was inflicted at one\r\ntime, and the other at another. It is possible that on the last visit\r\nthe pulse might not have entirely ceased to beat, and then the finishing\r\nstroke was given. It is said, that, when the body was discovered, some\r\nof the wounds wept, while the others did not. They may have been\r\ninflicted from mere wantonness. It was known that Captain White was\r\naccustomed to keep specie by him in his chamber; this perhaps may\r\nexplain the last visit. It is proved, that this defendant was in the\r\nhabit of retiring to bed, and leaving it afterwards, without the\r\nknowledge of his family; perhaps he did so on this occasion. We see no\r\nreason to doubt the fact; and it does not shake our belief that the\r\nmurder was committed early in the night.\r\n\r\nWhat are the probabilities as to the time of the murder? Mr. White was\r\nan aged man; he usually retired to bed at about half-past nine. He slept\r\nsoundest in the early part of the night; usually awoke in the middle and\r\nlatter part; and his habits were perfectly well known. When would\r\npersons, with a knowledge of these facts, be most likely to approach\r\nhim? Most certainly, in the first hour of his sleep. This would be the\r\nsafest time. If seen then going to or from the house, the appearance\r\nwould be least suspicious. The earlier hour would then have been most\r\nprobably selected.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I shall dwell no longer on the evidence which tends to prove\r\nthat there was a conspiracy, and that the prisoner was a conspirator.\r\nAll the circumstances concur to make out this point. Not only Palmer\r\nswears to it, in effect, and Leighton, but Allen mainly supports Palmer,\r\nand Osborn's books lend confirmation, so far as possible, from such a\r\nsource. Palmer is contradicted in nothing, either by any other witness,\r\nor any proved circumstance or occurrence. Whatever could be expected to\r\nsupport him does support him. All the evidence clearly manifests, I\r\nthink, that there was a conspiracy; that it originated with Joseph\r\nKnapp; that defendant became a party to it, and was one of its\r\nconductors, from first to last. One of the most powerful circumstances\r\nis Palmer's letter from Belfast. The amount of this is a direct charge\r\non the Knapps of the authorship of this murder. How did they treat this\r\ncharge; like honest men, or like guilty men? We have seen how it was\r\ntreated. Joseph Knapp fabricated letters, charging another person, and\r\ncaused them to be put into the post-office.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed on the supposition, that it is proved that there was\r\na conspiracy to murder Mr. White, and that the prisoner was party to it.\r\n\r\nThe second and the material inquiry is, Was the prisoner present at the\r\nmurder, aiding and abetting therein?\r\n\r\nThis leads to the legal question in the case. What does the law mean,\r\nwhen it says, that, in order to charge him as a principal, \"he must be\r\npresent aiding and abetting in the murder\"?\r\n\r\nIn the language of the late Chief Justice, \"It is not required that the\r\nabettor shall be actually upon the spot when the murder is committed, or\r\neven in sight of the more immediate perpetrator of the victim, to make\r\nhim a principal. If he be at a distance, co-operating in the act, by\r\nwatching to prevent relief, or to give an alarm, or to assist his\r\nconfederate in escape, having knowledge of the purpose and object of the\r\nassassin, this in the eye of the law is being present, aiding and\r\nabetting, so as to make him a principal in the murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he be at a distance co-operating.\" This is not a distance to be\r\nmeasured by feet or rods; if the intent to lend aid combine with a\r\nknowledge that the murder is to be committed, and the person so\r\nintending be so situate that he can by any possibility lend this aid in\r\nany manner, then he is present in legal contemplation. He need not lend\r\nany actual aid; to be ready to assist is assisting.\r\n\r\nThere are two sorts of murder; the distinction between them it is of\r\nessential importance to bear in mind: 1. Murder in an affray, or upon\r\nsudden and unexpected provocation. 2. Murder secretly, with a\r\ndeliberate, predetermined intention to commit the crime. Under the first\r\nclass, the question usually is, whether the offence be murder or\r\nmanslaughter, in the person who commits the deed. Under the second\r\nclass, it is often a question whether others than he who actually did\r\nthe deed were present, aiding and assisting therein. Offences of this\r\nkind ordinarily happen when there is nobody present except those who go\r\non the same design. If a riot should happen in the court-house, and one\r\nshould kill another, this may be murder, or it may not, according to the\r\nintention with which it was done; which is always matter of fact, to be\r\ncollected from the circumstances at the time. But in secret murders,\r\npremeditated and determined on, there can be no doubt of the murderous\r\nintention; there can be no doubt, if a person be present, knowing a\r\nmurder is to be done, of his concurring in the act. His being there is a\r\nproof of his intent to aid and abet; else, why is he there?\r\n\r\nIt has been contended, that proof must be given that the person accused\r\ndid actually afford aid, did lend a hand in the murder itself; and\r\nwithout this proof, although he may be near by, he may be presumed to be\r\nthere for an innocent purpose; he may have crept silently there to hear\r\nthe news, or from mere curiosity to see what was going on.[2]\r\nPreposterous, absurd! Such an idea shocks all common sense. A man is\r\nfound to be a conspirator to commit a murder; he has planned it; he has\r\nassisted in arranging the time, the place and the means; and he is found\r\nin the place, and at the time, and yet it is suggested that he might\r\nhave been there, not for co-operation and concurrence, but from\r\ncuriosity! Such an argument deserves no answer. It would be difficult to\r\ngive it one, in decorous terms. Is it not to be taken for granted, that\r\na man seeks to accomplish his own purposes? When he has planned a\r\nmurder, and is present at its execution, is he there to forward or to\r\nthwart his own design? is he there to assist, or there to prevent? But\r\n\"Curiosity\"! He may be there from mere \"curiosity\"! Curiosity to witness\r\nthe success of the execution of his own plan of murder! The very walls\r\nof a court-house ought not to stand, the ploughshare should run through\r\nthe ground it stands on, where such an argument could find\r\ntoleration.[3]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary that the abettor should actually lend a hand, that\r\nhe should take a part in the act itself; if he be present ready to\r\nassist, that is assisting. Some of the doctrines advanced would acquit\r\nthe defendant, though he had gone to the bedchamber of the deceased,\r\nthough he had been standing by when the assassin gave the blow. This is\r\nthe argument we have heard to-day.\r\n\r\n     The court here said, they did not so understand the argument of the\r\n     counsel for defendant. Mr. Dexter said, \"The intent and power alone\r\n     must co-operate.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt the law is, that being ready to assist is assisting, if the\r\nparty has the power to assist, in case of need. It is so stated by\r\nFoster, who is a high authority. \"If A happeneth to be present at a\r\nmurder, for instance, and taketh no part in it, nor endeavoreth to\r\nprevent it, nor apprehendeth the murderer, nor levyeth hue and cry after\r\nhim, this strange behavior of his, though highly criminal, will not of\r\nitself render him either principal or accessory.\" \"But if a fact\r\namounting to murder should be committed in prosecution of some unlawful\r\npurpose, though it were but a bare trespass, to which A in the case last\r\nstated had consented, and he had gone in order to give assistance, if\r\nneed were, for carrying it into execution, this would have amounted to\r\nmurder in him, and in every person present and joining with him.\" \"If\r\nthe fact was committed in prosecution of the original purpose which was\r\nunlawful, the whole party will be involved in the guilt of him who gave\r\nthe blow. For in combinations of this kind, the mortal stroke, though\r\ngiven by one of the party, is considered in the eye of the law, and of\r\nsound reason too, as given by every individual present and abetting. The\r\nperson actually giving the stroke is no more than the hand or instrument\r\nby which the others strike.\" The author, in speaking of being present,\r\nmeans actual presence; not actual in opposition to constructive, for the\r\nlaw knows no such distinction. There is but one presence, and this is\r\nthe situation from which aid, or supposed aid, may be rendered. The law\r\ndoes not say where the person is to go, or how near he is to go, but\r\nthat he must be where he may give assistance, or where the perpetrator\r\nmay believe that he may be assisted by him. Suppose that he is\r\nacquainted with the design of the murderer, and has a knowledge of the\r\ntime when it is to be carried into effect, and goes out with a view to\r\nrender assistance, if need be; why, then, even though the murderer does\r\nnot know of this, the person so going out will be an abettor in the\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\nIt is contended that the prisoner at the bar could not be a principal,\r\nhe being in Brown Street, because he could not there render assistance;\r\nand you are called upon to determine this case, according as you may be\r\nof opinion whether Brown Street was, or was not, a suitable, convenient,\r\nwell-chosen place to aid in this murder. This is not the true question.\r\nThe inquiry is not whether you would have selected this place in\r\npreference to all others, or whether you would have selected it at all.\r\nIf the parties chose it, why should we doubt about it? How do we know\r\nthe use they intended to make of it, or the kind of aid that he was to\r\nafford by being there? The question for you to consider is, Did the\r\ndefendant go into Brown Street in aid of this murder? Did he go there by\r\nagreement, by appointment with the perpetrator?[4] If so, every thing\r\nelse follows. The main thing, indeed the only thing, is to inquire\r\nwhether he was in Brown Street by appointment with Richard\r\nCrowninshield. It might be to keep general watch; to observe the lights,\r\nand advise as to time of access; to meet the murderer on his return, to\r\nadvise him as to his escape; to examine his clothes, to see if any marks\r\nof blood were upon them; to furnish exchange of clothes, or new\r\ndisguise, if necessary; to tell him through what streets he could safely\r\nretreat, or whether he could deposit the club in the place designed; or\r\nit might be without any distinct object, but merely to afford that\r\nencouragement which would proceed from Richard Crowninshield's\r\nconsciousness that he was near. It is of no consequence whether, in your\r\nopinion, the place was well chosen or not, to afford aid; if it was so\r\nchosen, if it was by appointment that he was there, it is enough.\r\nSuppose Richard Crowninshield, when applied to to commit the murder, had\r\nsaid, \"I won't do it unless there can be some one near by to favor my\r\nescape; I won't go unless you will stay in Brown Street.\" Upon the\r\ngentleman's argument, he would not be an aider and abettor in the\r\nmurder, because the place was not well chosen; though it is apparent\r\nthat the being in the place chosen was a condition, without which the\r\nmurder would never have happened.\r\n\r\nYou are to consider the defendant as one in the league, in the\r\ncombination to commit the murder. If he was there by appointment with\r\nthe perpetrator, he is an abettor. The concurrence of the perpetrator in\r\nhis being there is proved by the previous evidence of the conspiracy. If\r\nRichard Crowninshield, for any purpose whatsoever, made it a condition\r\nof the agreement, that Frank Knapp should stand as backer, then Frank\r\nKnapp was an aider and abettor; no matter what the aid was, or what sort\r\nit was, or degree, be it ever so little; even if it were to judge of the\r\nhour when it was best to go, or to see when the lights were\r\nextinguished, or to give an alarm if any one approached. Who better\r\ncalculated to judge of these things than the murderer himself? and if he\r\nso determined them, that is sufficient.\r\n\r\nNow as to the facts. Frank Knapp knew that the murder was that night to\r\nbe committed; he was one of the conspirators, he knew the object, he\r\nknew the time. He had that day been to Wenham to see Joseph, and\r\nprobably to Danvers to see Richard Crowninshield, for he kept his\r\nmotions secret. He had that day hired a horse and chaise of Osborn, and\r\nattempted to conceal the purpose for which it was used; he had\r\nintentionally left the _place_ and the _price_ blank on Osborn's books.\r\nHe went to Wenham by the way of Danvers; he had been told the week\r\nbefore to hasten Dick; he had seen the Crowninshields several times\r\nwithin a few days; he had a saddle-horse the Saturday night before; he\r\nhad seen Mrs. Beckford at Wenham, and knew she would not return that\r\nnight. She had not been away before for six weeks, and probably would\r\nnot soon be again. He had just come from Wenham. Every day, for the week\r\nprevious, he had visited one or another of these conspirators, save\r\nSunday, and then probably he saw them in town. When he saw Joseph on the\r\n6th, Joseph had prepared the house, and would naturally tell him of it;\r\nthere were constant communications between them; daily and nightly\r\nvisitation; too much knowledge of these parties and this transaction, to\r\nleave a particle of doubt on the mind of any one, that Frank Knapp knew\r\nthe murder was to be committed this night. The hour was come, and he\r\nknew it; if so, and he was in Brown Street, without explaining why he\r\nwas there, can the jury for a moment doubt whether he was there to\r\ncountenance, aid, or support; or for curiosity alone; or to learn how\r\nthe wages of sin and death were earned by the perpetrator?\r\n\r\n     Here Mr. Webster read the law from Hawkins. 1 Hawk. 204, Lib. 1,\r\n     ch. 32 sec. 7.\r\n\r\nThe perpetrator would derive courage, and strength, and confidence, from\r\nthe knowledge that one of his associates was near by. If he was in Brown\r\nStreet, he could have been there for no other purpose. If there for this\r\npurpose, then he was, in the language of the law, _present_, aiding and\r\nabetting in the murder.\r\n\r\nHis interest lay in being somewhere else. If he had nothing to do with\r\nthe murder, no part to act, why not stay at home? Why should he jeopard\r\nhis own life, if it was not agreed that he should be there? He would not\r\nvoluntarily go where the very place would cause him to swing if\r\ndetected. He would not voluntarily assume the place of danger. His\r\ntaking this place proves that he went to give aid. His staying away\r\nwould have made an _alibi_. If he had nothing to do with the murder, he\r\nwould be at home, where he could prove his _alibi_. He knew he was in\r\ndanger, because he was guilty of the conspiracy, and, if he had nothing\r\nto do, would not expose himself to suspicion or detection.\r\n\r\nDid the prisoner at the bar countenance this murder? Did he concur, or\r\ndid he non-concur, in what the perpetrator was about to do? Would he\r\nhave tried to shield him? Would he have furnished his cloak for\r\nprotection? Would he have pointed out a safe way of retreat? As you\r\nwould answer these questions, so you should answer the general question,\r\nwhether he was there consenting to the murder, or whether he was there\r\nas a spectator only.\r\n\r\nOne word more on this presence, called constructive presence. What aid\r\nis to be rendered? Where is the line to be drawn, between acting, and\r\nomitting to act? Suppose he had been in the house, suppose he had\r\nfollowed the perpetrator to the chamber, what could he have done? This\r\nwas to be a murder by stealth; it was to be a secret assassination. It\r\nwas not their purpose to have an open combat; they were to approach\r\ntheir victim unawares, and silently give the fatal blow. But if he had\r\nbeen in the chamber, no one can doubt that he would have been an\r\nabettor; because of his presence, and ability to render services, if\r\nneeded. What service could he have rendered, if there? Could he have\r\nhelped him to fly? Could he have aided the silence of his movements?\r\nCould he have facilitated his retreat, on the first alarm? Surely, this\r\nwas a case where there was more of safety in going alone than with\r\nanother; where company would only embarrass. Richard Crowninshield would\r\nprefer to go alone. He knew his errand too well. His nerves needed no\r\ncollateral support. He was not the man to take with him a trembling\r\ncompanion. He would prefer to have his aid at a distance. He would not\r\nwish to be encumbered by his presence. He would prefer to have him out\r\nof the house. He would prefer that he should be in Brown Street. But\r\nwhether in the chamber, in the house, in the garden, or in the street,\r\nwhatsoever is aiding in _actual presence_ is aiding in _constructive\r\npresence_; any thing that is aid in one case is aid in the other.[5]\r\n\r\nIf, then, the aid be anywhere, so as to embolden the perpetrator, to\r\nafford him hope or confidence in his enterprise, it is the same as\r\nthough the person stood at his elbow with his sword drawn. His being\r\nthere ready to act, with the power to act, is what makes him an abettor.\r\n\r\n     Here Mr. Webster referred to the cases of Kelly, of Hyde, and\r\n     others, cited by counsel for the defendant, and showed that they\r\n     did not militate with the doctrine for which he contended. The\r\n     difference is, in those cases there was open violence; this was a\r\n     case of secret assassination. The aid must meet the occasion. Here\r\n     no _acting_ was necessary, but watching, concealment of escape,\r\n     management.\r\n\r\nWhat are the _facts_ in relation to this presence? Frank Knapp is proved\r\nto have been a conspirator, proved to have known that the deed was now\r\nto be done. Is it not probable that he was in Brown Street to concur in\r\nthe murder? There were four conspirators. It was natural that some one\r\nof them should go with the perpetrator. Richard Crowninshield was to be\r\nthe perpetrator; he was to give the blow. There is no evidence of any\r\ncasting of the parts for the others. The defendant would probably be the\r\nman to take the second part. He was fond of exploits, he was accustomed\r\nto the use of sword-canes and dirks. If any aid was required, he was the\r\nman to give it. At least, there is no evidence to the contrary of this.\r\n\r\nAid could not have been received from Joseph Knapp, or from George\r\nCrowninshield. Joseph Knapp was at Wenham, and took good care to prove\r\nthat he was there. George Crowninshield has proved satisfactorily where\r\nhe was; that he was in other company, such as it was, until eleven\r\no'clock. This narrows the inquiry. This demands of the prisoner to show,\r\nif he was not in this place, where he was. It calls on him loudly to\r\nshow this, and to show it truly. If he could show it, he would do it. If\r\nhe does not tell, and that truly, it is against him. The defence of an\r\n_alibi_ is a double-edged sword. He knew that he was in a situation\r\nwhere he might be called upon to account for himself. If he had had no\r\nparticular appointment or business to attend to, he would have taken\r\ncare to be able so to account. He would have been out of town, or in\r\nsome good company. Has he accounted for himself on that night to your\r\nsatisfaction?\r\n\r\nThe prisoner has attempted to prove an _alibi_ in two ways. In the\r\nfirst place, by four young men with whom he says he was in company, on\r\nthe evening of the murder, from seven o'clock till near ten o'clock.\r\nThis depends upon the certainty of the night. In the second place, by\r\nhis family, from ten o'clock afterwards. This depends upon the certainty\r\nof the time of the night. These two classes of proof have no connection\r\nwith each other. One may be true, and the other false; or they may both\r\nbe true, or both be false. I shall examine this testimony with some\r\nattention, because, on a former trial, it made more impression on the\r\nminds of the court than on my own mind. I think, when carefully sifted\r\nand compared, it will be found to have in it more of plausibility than\r\nreality.\r\n\r\nMr. Page testifies, that on the evening of the 6th of April he was in\r\ncompany with Burchmore, Balch, and Forrester, and that he met the\r\ndefendant about seven o'clock, near the Salem Hotel; that he afterwards\r\nmet him at Remond's, about nine o'clock, and that he was in company with\r\nhim a considerable part of the evening. This young gentleman is a member\r\nof college, and says that he came to town the Saturday evening previous;\r\nthat he is now able to say that it was the night of the murder when he\r\nwalked with Frank Knapp, from the recollection of the fact, that he\r\ncalled himself to an account, on the morning after the murder, as it is\r\nnatural for men to do when an extraordinary occurrence happens.\r\nGentlemen, this kind of evidence is not satisfactory; general\r\nimpressions as to time are not to be relied on. If I were called on to\r\nstate the particular day on which any witness testified in this cause, I\r\ncould not do it. Every man will notice the same thing in his own mind.\r\nThere is no one of these young men that could give an account of himself\r\nfor any _other_ day in the month of April. They are made to remember the\r\nfact, and then they think they remember the time. The witness has no\r\nmeans of knowing it was Tuesday rather than any other time. He did not\r\nknow it at first; he could not know it afterwards. He says he called\r\nhimself to an account. This has no more to do with the murder than with\r\nthe man in the moon. Such testimony is not worthy to be relied on in any\r\nforty-shilling cause. What occasion had he to call himself to an\r\naccount? Did he suppose that he should be suspected? Had he any\r\nintimation of this conspiracy?\r\n\r\nSuppose, Gentlemen, you were either of you asked where you were, or what\r\nyou were doing, on the fifteenth day of June; you could not answer this\r\nquestion without calling to mind some events to make it certain. Just as\r\nwell may you remember on what you dined each day of the year past. Time\r\nis identical. Its subdivisions are all alike. No man knows one day from\r\nanother, or one hour from another, but by some fact connected with it.\r\nDays and hours are not visible to the senses, nor to be apprehended and\r\ndistinguished by the understanding. The flow of time is known only by\r\nsomething which marks it; and he who speaks of the date of occurrences\r\nwith nothing to guide his recollection speaks at random, and is not to\r\nbe relied on. This young gentleman remembers the facts and occurrences;\r\nhe knows nothing why they should not have happened on the evening of the\r\n6th; but he knows no more. All the rest is evidently conjecture or\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nMr. White informs you, that he told him he could not tell what night it\r\nwas. The first thoughts are all that are valuable in such case. They\r\nmiss the mark by taking second aim.\r\n\r\nMr. Balch believes, but is not sure, that he was with Frank Knapp on the\r\nevening of the murder. He has given different accounts of the time. He\r\nhas no means of making it certain. All he knows is, that it was some\r\nevening before Fast-day. But whether Monday, Tuesday, or Saturday, he\r\ncannot tell.\r\n\r\nMr. Burchmore says, to the best of his belief, it was the evening of the\r\nmurder. Afterwards he attempts to speak positively, from recollecting\r\nthat he mentioned the circumstance to William Peirce, as he went to the\r\nMineral Spring on Fast-day. Last Monday morning he told Colonel Putnam\r\nhe could not fix the time. This witness stands in a much worse plight\r\nthan either of the others. It is difficult to reconcile all he has said\r\nwith any belief in the accuracy of his recollections.\r\n\r\nMr. Forrester does not speak with any certainty as to the night; and it\r\nis very certain that he told Mr. Loring and others, that he did not know\r\nwhat night it was.\r\n\r\nNow, what does the testimony of these four young men amount to? The only\r\ncircumstance by which they approximate to an identifying of the night\r\nis, that three of them say it was cloudy; they think their walk was\r\neither on Monday or Tuesday evening, and it is admitted that Monday\r\nevening was clear, whence they draw the inference that it must have been\r\nTuesday.\r\n\r\nBut, fortunately, there is one _fact_ disclosed in their testimony that\r\nsettles the question. Balch says, that on the evening, whenever it was,\r\nhe saw the prisoner; the prisoner told him he was going out of town on\r\nhorseback, for a distance of about twenty minutes' drive, and that he\r\nwas going to get a horse at Osborn's. This was about seven o'clock. At\r\nabout nine, Balch says he saw the prisoner again, and was then told by\r\nhim that he had had his ride, and had returned. Now it appears by\r\nOsborn's books, that the prisoner had a saddle-horse from his stable,\r\nnot on Tuesday evening, the night of the murder, but on the Saturday\r\nevening previous. This fixes the time about which these young men\r\ntestify, and is a complete answer and refutation of the attempted\r\n_alibi_ on Tuesday evening.\r\n\r\nI come now to speak of the testimony adduced by the defendant to explain\r\nwhere he was after ten o'clock on the night of the murder. This comes\r\nchiefly from members of the family; from his father and brothers.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed that the affidavit of the prisoner should be received as\r\nevidence of what his brother, Samuel H. Knapp, would testify if present.\r\nSamuel H. Knapp says, that, about ten minutes past ten o'clock, his\r\nbrother, Frank Knapp, on his way to bed, opened his chamber door, made\r\nsome remarks, closed the door, and went to his chamber; and that he did\r\nnot hear him leave it afterwards. How is this witness able to fix the\r\ntime at ten minutes past ten? There is no circumstance mentioned by\r\nwhich he fixes it. He had been in bed, probably asleep, and was aroused\r\nfrom his sleep by the opening of the door. Was he in a situation to\r\nspeak of time with precision? Could he know, under such circumstances,\r\nwhether it was ten minutes past ten, or ten minutes before eleven, when\r\nhis brother spoke to him? What would be the natural result in such a\r\ncase? But we are not left to conjecture this result. We have positive\r\ntestimony on this point. Mr. Webb tells you that Samuel told him, on the\r\n8th of June, \"that he did not know what time his brother Frank came\r\nhome, and that he was not at home when _he_ went to bed.\" You will\r\nconsider this testimony of Mr. Webb as indorsed upon this affidavit; and\r\nwith this indorsement upon it, you will give it its due weight. This\r\nstatement was made to him after Frank was arrested.\r\n\r\nI come to the testimony of the father. I find myself incapable of\r\nspeaking of him or his testimony with severity. Unfortunate old man!\r\nAnother Lear, in the conduct of his children; another Lear, I apprehend,\r\nin the effect of his distress upon his mind and understanding. He is\r\nbrought here to testify, under circumstances that disarm severity, and\r\ncall loudly for sympathy. Though it is impossible not to see that his\r\nstory cannot be credited, yet I am unable to speak of him otherwise than\r\nin sorrow and grief. Unhappy father! he strives to remember, perhaps\r\npersuades himself that he does remember, that on the evening of the\r\nmurder he was himself at home at ten o'clock. He thinks, or seems to\r\nthink, that his son came in at about five minutes past ten. He fancies\r\nthat he remembers his conversation; he thinks he spoke of bolting the\r\ndoor; he thinks he asked the time of night; he seems to remember his\r\nthen going to his bed. Alas! these are but the swimming fancies of an\r\nagitated and distressed mind. Alas! they are but the dreams of hope, its\r\nuncertain lights, flickering on the thick darkness of parental distress.\r\nAlas! the miserable father knows nothing, in reality, of all these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nMr. Shepard says that the first conversation he had with Mr. Knapp was\r\nsoon after the murder, and _before_ the arrest of his sons. Mr. Knapp\r\nsays it was _after_ the arrest of his sons. His own fears led him to say\r\nto Mr. Shepard, that his \"son Frank was at home that night; and so\r\nPhippen told him,\" or \"as Phippen told him.\" Mr. Shepard says that he\r\nwas struck with the remark at the time; that it made an unfavorable\r\nimpression on his mind; he does not tell you what that impression was,\r\nbut when you connect it with the previous inquiry he had made, whether\r\nFrank had continued to associate with the Crowninshields, and recollect\r\nthat the Crowninshields were then known to be suspected of this crime,\r\ncan you doubt what this impression was? can you doubt as to the fears he\r\nthen had?\r\n\r\nThis poor old man tells you, that he was greatly perplexed at the time;\r\nthat he found himself in embarrassed circumstances; that on this very\r\nnight he was engaged in making an assignment of his property to his\r\nfriend, Mr. Shepard. If ever charity should furnish a mantle for error,\r\nit should be here. Imagination cannot picture a more deplorable,\r\ndistressed condition.\r\n\r\nThe same general remarks may be applied to his conversation with Mr.\r\nTreadwell, as have been made upon that with Mr. Shepard. He told him,\r\nthat he believed Frank was at home about the usual time. In his\r\nconversations with either of these persons, he did not pretend to know,\r\nof his own knowledge, the time that he came home. He now tells you\r\npositively that he recollects the time, and that he so told Mr. Shepard.\r\nHe is directly contradicted by both these witnesses, as respectable men\r\nas Salem affords.\r\n\r\nThis idea of an _alibi_ is of recent origin. Would Samuel Knapp have\r\ngone to sea if it were then thought of? His testimony, if true, was too\r\nimportant to be lost. If there be any truth in this part of the _alibi_,\r\nit is so near in point or time that it cannot be relied on. The mere\r\nvariation of half an hour would avoid it. The mere variations of\r\ndifferent timepieces would explain it.\r\n\r\nHas the defendant proved where he was on that night? If you doubt about\r\nit, there is an end of it. The burden is upon him to satisfy you beyond\r\nall reasonable doubt. Osborn's books, in connection with what the young\r\nmen state, are conclusive, I think, on this point. He has not, then,\r\naccounted for himself; he has attempted it, and has failed. I pray you\r\nto remember, Gentlemen, that this is a case in which the prisoner would,\r\nmore than any other, be rationally able to account for himself on the\r\nnight of the murder, if he could do so. He was in the conspiracy, he\r\nknew the murder was then to be committed, and if he himself was to have\r\nno hand in its actual execution, he would of course, as a matter of\r\nsafety and precaution, be somewhere else, and be able to prove\r\nafterwards that he had been somewhere else. Having this motive to prove\r\nhimself elsewhere, and the power to do it if he were elsewhere, his\r\nfailing in such proof must necessarily leave a very strong inference\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, let us now consider what is the evidence produced on the\r\npart of the government to prove that John Francis Knapp, the prisoner at\r\nthe bar, was in Brown Street on the night of the murder. This is a point\r\nof vital importance in this cause. Unless this be made out, beyond\r\nreasonable doubt, the law of _presence_ does not apply to the case. The\r\ngovernment undertake to prove that he was present aiding in the murder,\r\nby proving that he was in Brown Street for this purpose. Now, what are\r\nthe undoubted facts? They are, that two persons were seen in that\r\nstreet, several times during that evening, under suspicious\r\ncircumstances; under such circumstances as induced those who saw them to\r\nwatch their movements. Of this there can be no doubt. Mirick saw a man\r\nstanding at the post opposite his store from fifteen minutes before nine\r\nuntil twenty minutes after, dressed in a full frock-coat, glazed cap,\r\nand so forth, in size and general appearance answering to the prisoner\r\nat the bar. This person was waiting there; and whenever any one\r\napproached him, he moved to and from the corner, as though he would\r\navoid being suspected or recognized. Afterwards, two persons were seen\r\nby Webster, walking in Howard Street, with a slow, deliberate movement\r\nthat attracted his attention. This was about half-past nine. One of\r\nthese he took to be the prisoner at the bar, the other he did not know.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past ten a person is seen sitting on the rope-walk steps,\r\nwrapped in a cloak. He drops his head when passed, to avoid being known.\r\nShortly after, two persons are seen to meet in this street, without\r\nceremony or salutation, and in a hurried manner to converse for a short\r\ntime; then to separate, and run off with great speed. Now, on this same\r\nnight a gentleman is slain, murdered in his bed, his house being entered\r\nby stealth from without; and his house situated within three hundred\r\nfeet of this street. The windows of his chamber were in plain sight from\r\nthis street; a weapon of death is afterwards found in a place where\r\nthese persons were seen to pass, in a retired place, around which they\r\nhad been seen lingering. It is now known that this murder was committed\r\nby four persons, conspiring together for this purpose. No account is\r\ngiven who these suspected persons thus seen in Brown Street and its\r\nneighborhood were. Now, I ask, Gentlemen, whether you or any man can\r\ndoubt that this murder was committed by the persons who were thus in and\r\nabout Brown Street. Can any person doubt that they were there for\r\npurposes connected with this murder? If not for this purpose, what were\r\nthey there for? When there is a cause so near at hand, why wander into\r\nconjecture for an explanation? Common-sense requires you to take the\r\nnearest adequate cause for a known effect. Who were these suspicious\r\npersons in Brown Street? There was something extraordinary about them;\r\nsomething noticeable, and noticed at the time; something in their\r\nappearance that aroused suspicion. And a man is found the next morning\r\nmurdered in the near vicinity.\r\n\r\nNow, so long as no other account shall be given of those suspicious\r\npersons, so long the inference must remain irresistible that they were\r\nthe murderers. Let it be remembered, that it is already shown that this\r\nmurder was the result of conspiracy and of concert; let it be\r\nremembered, that the house, having been opened from within, was entered\r\nby stealth from without. Let it be remembered that Brown Street, where\r\nthese persons were repeatedly seen under such suspicious circumstances,\r\nwas a place from which every occupied room in Mr. White's house is\r\nclearly seen; let it be remembered, that the place, though thus very\r\nnear to Mr. White's house, is a retired and lonely place; and let it be\r\nremembered that the instrument of death was afterwards found concealed\r\nvery near the same spot.\r\n\r\nMust not every man come to the conclusion, that these persons thus seen\r\nin Brown Street were the murderers? Every man's own judgment, I think,\r\nmust satisfy him that this must be so. It is a plain deduction of common\r\nsense. It is a point on which each one of you may reason like a Hale or\r\na Mansfield. The two occurrences explain each other. The murder shows\r\nwhy these persons were thus lurking, at that hour, in Brown Street; and\r\ntheir lurking in Brown Street shows who committed the murder.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the persons in and about Brown Street were the plotters and\r\nexecuters of the murder of Captain White, we know who they were, and you\r\nknow that _there_ is one of them.\r\n\r\nThis fearful concatenation of circumstances puts him to an account. He\r\nwas a conspirator. He had entered into this plan of murder. The murder\r\nis committed, and he is known to have been within three minutes' walk of\r\nthe place. He must account for himself, He has attempted this, and\r\nfailed. Then, with all these general reasons to show he was actually in\r\nBrown Street, and his failures in his _alibi_, let us see what is the\r\ndirect proof of his being there. But first, let me ask, is it not very\r\nremarkable that there is no attempt to show where Richard Crowninshield,\r\nJr. was on that night? We hear nothing of him. He was seen in none of\r\nhis usual haunts about the town. Yet, if he was the actual perpetrator\r\nof the murder, which nobody doubts, he was in the town somewhere. Can\r\nyou, therefore, entertain a doubt that he was one of the persons seen in\r\nBrown Street? And as to the prisoner, you will recollect, that, since\r\nthe testimony of the young men has failed to show where he was on that\r\nevening, the last we hear or know of him, on the day preceding the\r\nmurder, is, that at four o'clock, P.M., he was at his brother's in\r\nWenham. He had left home, after dinner, in a manner doubtless designed\r\nto avoid observation, and had gone to Wenham, probably by way of\r\nDanvers. As we hear nothing of him after four o'clock, P.M., for the\r\nremainder of the day and evening; as he was one of the conspirators; as\r\nRichard Crowninshield, Jr. was another; as Richard Crowninshield, Jr.\r\nwas in town in the evening, and yet seen in no usual place of\r\nresort,--the inference is very fair, that Richard Crowninshield, Jr. and\r\nthe prisoner were together, acting in execution of their conspiracy. Of\r\nthe four conspirators, J.J. Knapp, Jr. was at Wenham, and George\r\nCrowninshield has been accounted for; so that if the persons seen in\r\nBrown Street were the murderers, one of them must have been Richard\r\nCrowninshield, Jr., and the other must have been the prisoner at the\r\nbar.\r\n\r\nNow, as to the proof of his identity with one of the persons seen in\r\nBrown Street, Mr. Mirick, a cautious witness, examined the person he\r\nsaw, closely, in a light night, and says that he thinks the prisoner at\r\nthe bar is the person; and that he should not hesitate at all, if he\r\nwere seen in the same dress. His opinion is formed partly from his own\r\nobservation, and partly from the description of others. But this\r\ndescription turns out to be only in regard to the dress. It is said,\r\nthat he is now more confident than on the former trial. If he has varied\r\nin his testimony make such allowance as you may think proper. I do not\r\nperceive any material variance. He thought him the same person, when he\r\nwas first brought to court, and as he saw him get out of the chaise.\r\nThis is one of the cases in which a witness is permitted to give an\r\nopinion. This witness is as honest as yourselves, neither willing nor\r\nswift; but he says, he believes it was the man. His words are, \"This is\r\nmy opinion \"; and this opinion it is proper for him to give. If partly\r\nfounded on what he has _heard_, then this opinion is not to be taken;\r\nbut if on what he _saw_, then you can have no better evidence. I lay no\r\nstress on similarity of dress. No man will ever lose his life by my\r\nvoice on such evidence. But then it is proper to notice, that no\r\ninferences drawn from any _dissimilarity_ of dress can be given in the\r\nprisoner's favor; because, in fact, the person seen by Mirick was\r\ndressed like the prisoner.\r\n\r\nThe description of the person seen by Mirick answers to that of the\r\nprisoner at the bar. In regard to the supposed discrepancy of\r\nstatements, before and now, there would be no end to such minute\r\ninquiries. It would not be strange if witnesses should vary. I do not\r\nthink much of slight shades of variation. If I believe the witness is\r\nhonest, that is enough. If he has expressed himself more strongly now\r\nthan then, this does not prove him false.\r\n\r\nPeter E. Webster saw the prisoner at the bar, as he then thought, and\r\nstill thinks, walking in Howard Street at half-past nine o'clock. He\r\nthen thought it was Frank Knapp, and has not altered his opinion since.\r\nHe knew him well; he had long known him. If he then thought it was he,\r\nthis goes far to prove it. He observed him the more, as it was unusual\r\nto see gentlemen walk there at that hour. It was a retired, lonely\r\nstreet. Now, is there reasonable doubt that Mr. Webster did see him\r\nthere that night? How can you have more proof than this? He judged by\r\nhis walk, by his general appearance, by his deportment. We all judge in\r\nthis manner. If you believe he is right, it goes a great way in this\r\ncase. But then this person, it is said, had a cloak on, and that he\r\ncould not, therefore, be the same person that Mirick saw. If we were\r\ntreating of men that had no occasion to disguise themselves or their\r\nconduct, there might be something in this argument. But as it is, there\r\nis little in it. It may be presumed that they would change their dress.\r\nThis would help their disguise. What is easier than to throw off a\r\ncloak, and again put it on? Perhaps he was less fearful of being known\r\nwhen alone, than when with the perpetrator.\r\n\r\nMr. Southwick swears all that a man can swear. He has the best means of\r\njudging that could be had at the time. He tells you that he left his\r\nfather's house at half-past ten o'clock, and as he passed to his own\r\nhouse in Brown Street he saw a man sitting on the steps of the\r\nrope-walk; that he passed him three times, and each time he held down\r\nhis head, so that he did not see his face. That the man had on a cloak,\r\nwhich was not wrapped around him, and a glazed cap. That he took the man\r\nto be Frank Knapp at the time; that, when he went into his house, he\r\ntold his wife that he thought it was Frank Knapp; that he knew him well,\r\nhaving known him from a boy. And his wife swears that he did so tell her\r\nwhen he came home. What could mislead this witness at the time? He was\r\nnot then suspecting Frank Knapp of any thing. He could not then be\r\ninfluenced by any prejudice. If you believe that the witness saw Frank\r\nKnapp in this position at this time, it proves the case. Whether you\r\nbelieve it or not depends upon the credit of the witness. He swears it.\r\nIf true, it is solid evidence. Mrs. Southwick supports her husband. Are\r\nthey true? Are they worthy of belief? If he deserves the epithets\r\napplied to him, then he ought not to be believed. In this fact they\r\ncannot be mistaken; they are right, or they are perjured. As to his not\r\nspeaking to Frank Knapp, that depends upon their intimacy. But a very\r\ngood reason is, Frank chose to disguise himself. This makes nothing\r\nagainst his credit. But it is said that he should not be believed. And\r\nwhy? Because, it is said, he himself now tells you, that, when he\r\ntestified before the grand jury at Ipswich, he did not then say that he\r\nthought the person he saw in Brown Street was Frank Knapp, but that \"the\r\nperson was about the size of Selman.\" The means of attacking him,\r\ntherefore, come from himself. If he is a false man, why should he tell\r\ntruths against himself? They rely on his veracity to prove that he is a\r\nliar. Before you can come to this conclusion, you will consider whether\r\nall the circumstances are now known, that should have a bearing on this\r\npoint. Suppose that, when he was before the grand jury, he was asked by\r\nthe attorney this question, \"Was the person you saw in Brown Street\r\nabout the size of Selman?\" and he answered Yes. This was all true.\r\nSuppose, also, that he expected to be inquired of further, and no\r\nfurther questions were put to him. Would it not be extremely hard to\r\nimpute to him perjury for this? It is not uncommon for witnesses to\r\nthink that they have done all their duty, when they have answered the\r\nquestions put to them. But suppose that we admit that he did not then\r\ntell all he knew, this does not affect the _fact_ at all; because he did\r\ntell, at the time, in the hearing of others, that the person he saw was\r\nFrank Knapp. There is not the slightest suggestion against the veracity\r\nor accuracy of Mrs. Southwick. Now she swears positively, that her\r\nhusband came into the house and told her that he had seen a person on\r\nthe rope-walk steps, and believed it was Frank Knapp.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Mr. Southwick is contradicted, also, by Mr. Shillaber. I\r\ndo not so understand Mr. Shillaber's testimony. I think what they both\r\ntestify is reconcilable, and consistent. My learned brother said, on a\r\nsimilar occasion, that there is more probability, in such cases, that\r\nthe persons hearing should misunderstand, than that the person speaking\r\nshould contradict himself. I think the same remark applicable here.\r\n\r\nYou have all witnessed the uncertainty of testimony, when witnesses are\r\ncalled to testify what other witnesses said. Several respectable\r\ncounsellors have been summoned, on this occasion, to give testimony of\r\nthat sort. They have, every one of them, given different versions. They\r\nall took minutes at the time, and without doubt intend to state the\r\ntruth. But still they differ. Mr. Shillaber's version is different from\r\nevery thing that Southwick has stated elsewhere. But little reliance is\r\nto be placed on slight variations in testimony, unless they are\r\nmanifestly intentional. I think that Mr. Shillaber must be satisfied\r\nthat he did not rightly understand Mr. Southwick. I confess I\r\nmisunderstood Mr. Shillaber on the former trial, if I now rightly\r\nunderstand him. I, therefore, did not then recall Mr. Southwick to the\r\nstand. Mr. Southwick, as I read it, understood Mr. Shillaber as asking\r\nhim about a person coming out of Newbury Street, and whether, for aught\r\nhe knew, it might not be Richard Crowninshield, Jr. He answered, that he\r\ncould not tell. He did not understand Mr. Shillaber as questioning him\r\nas to the person whom he saw sitting on the steps of the rope-walk.\r\nSouthwick, on this trial, having heard Mr. Shillaber, has been recalled\r\nto the stand, and states that Mr. Shillaber entirely misunderstood him.\r\nThis is certainly most probable, because the controlling fact in the\r\ncase is not controverted; that is, that Southwick did tell his wife, at\r\nthe very moment he entered his house, that he had seen a person on the\r\nrope-walk steps, whom he believed to be Frank Knapp. Nothing can prove\r\nwith more certainty than this, that Southwick, at the time, _thought_\r\nthe person whom he thus saw to be the prisoner at the bar.\r\n\r\nMr. Bray is an acknowledged accurate and intelligent witness. He was\r\nhighly complimented by my brother on the former trial, although he now\r\ncharges him with varying his testimony. What could be his motive? You\r\nwill be slow in imputing to him any design of this kind. I deny\r\naltogether that there is any contradiction. There may be differences,\r\nbut not contradiction. These arise from the difference in the questions\r\nput; the difference between believing and knowing. On the first trial,\r\nhe said he did not know the person, and now says the same. Then, we did\r\nnot do all we had a right to do. We did not ask him who he thought it\r\nwas. Now, when so asked, he says he believes it was the prisoner at the\r\nbar. If he had then been asked this question, he would have given the\r\nsame answer. That he has expressed himself more strongly, I admit; but\r\nhe has not contradicted himself. He is more confident now; and that is\r\nall. A man may not assert a thing, and still may have no doubt upon it.\r\nCannot every man see this distinction to be consistent? I leave him in\r\nthat attitude; that only is the difference. On questions of identity,\r\nopinion is evidence. We may ask the witness, either if he knew who the\r\nperson seen was, or who he thinks he was. And he may well answer, as\r\nCaptain Bray has answered, that he does not know who it was, but that he\r\nthinks it was the prisoner.\r\n\r\nWe have offered to produce witnesses to prove, that, as soon as Bray saw\r\nthe prisoner, he pronounced him the same person. We are not at liberty\r\nto call them to corroborate our own witness. How, then, could this fact\r\nof the prisoner's being in Brown Street be better proved? If ten\r\nwitnesses had testified to it, it would be no better. Two men, who knew\r\nhim well, took it to be Frank Knapp, and one of them so said, when there\r\nwas nothing to mislead them. Two others, who examined him closely, now\r\nswear to their opinion that he is the man.\r\n\r\nMiss Jaqueth saw three persons pass by the rope-walk, several evenings\r\nbefore the murder. She saw one of them pointing towards Mr. White's\r\nhouse. She noticed that another had something which appeared to be like\r\nan instrument of music; that he put it behind him and attempted to\r\nconceal it. Who were these persons? This was but a few steps from the\r\nplace where this apparent instrument of music (of _music_ such as\r\nRichard Crowninshield, Jr. spoke of to Palmer) was afterwards found.\r\nThese facts prove this a point of rendezvous for these parties. They\r\nshow Brown Street to have been the place for consultation and\r\nobservation; and to this purpose it was well suited.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns's testimony is also important. What was the defendant's object\r\nin his private conversation with Burns? He knew that Burns was out that\r\nnight; that he lived near Brown Street, and that he had probably seen\r\nhim; and he wished him to say nothing. He said to Burns, \"If you saw any\r\nof your friends out that night, say nothing about it; my brother Joe and\r\nI are your friends.\" This is plain proof that he wished to say to him,\r\nif you saw me in Brown Street that night, say nothing about it.\r\n\r\nBut it is said that Burns ought not to be believed, because he mistook\r\nthe color of the dagger, and because he has varied in his description of\r\nit. These are slight circumstances, if his general character be good. To\r\nmy mind they are of no importance. It is for you to make what deduction\r\nyou may think proper, on this account, from the weight of his evidence.\r\nHis conversation with Burns, if Burns is believed, shows two things;\r\nfirst, that he desired Burns not to mention it, if he had seen him on\r\nthe night of the murder; second, that he wished to fix the charge of\r\nmurder on Mr. Stephen White. Both of these prove his own guilt.\r\n\r\nI think you will be of opinion, that Brown Street was a probable place\r\nfor the conspirators to assemble, and for an aid to be stationed. If we\r\nknew their whole plan, and if we were skilled to judge in such a case,\r\nthen we could perhaps determine on this point better. But it is a\r\nretired place, and still commands a full view of the house; a lonely\r\nplace, but still a place of observation. Not so lonely that a person\r\nwould excite suspicion to be seen walking there in an ordinary manner;\r\nnot so public as to be noticed by many. It is near enough to the scene\r\nof action in point of law. It was their point of centrality. The club\r\nwas found near the spot, in a place provided for it, in a place that had\r\nbeen previously hunted out, in a concerted place of concealment. _Here\r\nwas their point of rendezvous._ Here might the lights be seen. Here\r\nmight an aid be secreted. Here was he within call. Here might he be\r\naroused by the sound of the whistle. Here might he carry the weapon.\r\nHere might he receive the murderer after the murder.\r\n\r\nThen, Gentlemen, the general question occurs, Is it satisfactorily\r\nproved, by all these facts and circumstances, that the defendant was in\r\nand about Brown Street on the night of the murder? Considering that the\r\nmurder was effected by a conspiracy; considering that he was one of the\r\nfour conspirators; considering that two of the conspirators have\r\naccounted for themselves on the night of the murder, and were not in\r\nBrown Street; considering that the prisoner does not account for\r\nhimself, nor show where he was; considering that Richard Crowninshield,\r\nthe other conspirator and the perpetrator, is not accounted for, nor\r\nshown to be elsewhere; considering that it is now past all doubt that\r\ntwo persons were seen lurking in and about Brown Street at different\r\ntimes, avoiding observation, and exciting so much suspicion that the\r\nneighbors actually watched them; considering that, if these persons thus\r\nlurking in Brown Street at that hour were not the murderers, it remains\r\nto this day wholly unknown who they were or what their business was;\r\nconsidering the testimony of Miss Jaqueth, and that the club was\r\nafterwards found near this place; considering, finally, that Webster and\r\nSouthwick saw these persons, and then took one of them for the\r\ndefendant, and that Southwick then told his wife so, and that Bray and\r\nMirick examined them closely, and now swear to their belief that the\r\nprisoner was one of them;--it is for you to say, putting these\r\nconsiderations together, whether you believe the prisoner was actually\r\nin Brown Street at the time of the murder.\r\n\r\nBy the counsel for the prisoner, much stress has been laid upon the\r\nquestion, whether Brown Street was a place in which aid could be given,\r\na place in which actual assistance could be rendered in this\r\ntransaction. This must be mainly decided by their own opinion who\r\nselected the place; by what they thought at the time, according to their\r\nplan of operation.\r\n\r\nIf it was agreed that the prisoner should be there to assist, it is\r\nenough. If they thought the place proper for their purpose, according to\r\ntheir plan, it is sufficient. Suppose we could prove expressly that they\r\nagreed that Frank should be there, and he was there, and you should\r\nthink it not a well-chosen place for aiding and abetting, must he be\r\nacquitted? No! It is not what _I_ think or _you_ think of the\r\nappropriateness of the place; it is what _they_ thought _at the time_.\r\nIf the prisoner was in Brown Street by appointment and agreement with\r\nthe perpetrator, for the purpose of giving assistance if assistance\r\nshould be needed, it may safely be presumed that the place was suited to\r\nsuch assistance as it was supposed by the parties might chance to become\r\nrequisite.\r\n\r\nIf in Brown Street, was he there by appointment? was he there to aid, if\r\naid were necessary? was he there for, or against, the murderer? to\r\nconcur, or to oppose? to favor, or to thwart? Did the perpetrator know\r\nhe was there, there waiting? If so, then it follows that he was there by\r\nappointment. He was at the post half an hour; he was waiting for\r\nsomebody. This proves appointment, arrangement, previous agreement; then\r\nit follows that he was there to aid, to encourage, to embolden the\r\nperpetrator; and that is enough. If he were in such a situation as to\r\nafford aid, or that he was relied upon for aid, then he was aiding and\r\nabetting. It is enough that the conspirator desired to have him there.\r\nBesides, it may be well said, that he could afford just as much aid\r\nthere as if he had been in Essex Street, as if he had been standing even\r\nat the gate, or at the window. It was not an act of power against power\r\nthat was to be done; it was a secret act, to be done by stealth. The aid\r\nwas to be placed in a position secure from observation. It was important\r\nto the security of both that he should be in a lonely place. Now it is\r\nobvious that there are many purposes for which he might be in Brown\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n1. Richard Crowninshield might have been secreted in the garden, and\r\nwaiting for a signal;\r\n\r\n2. Or he might be in Brown Street to advise him as to the time of making\r\nhis entry into the house;\r\n\r\n3. Or to favor his escape;\r\n\r\n4. Or to see if the street was clear when he came out;\r\n\r\n5. Or to conceal the weapon or the clothes;\r\n\r\n6. To be ready for any unforeseen contingency.\r\n\r\nRichard Crowninshield lived in Danvers. He would retire by the most\r\nsecret way. Brown Street is that way. If you find him there, can you\r\ndoubt why he was there?\r\n\r\nIf, Gentlemen, the prisoner went into Brown Street, by appointment with\r\nthe perpetrator, to render aid or encouragement in any of these ways, he\r\nwas _present_, in legal contemplation, aiding and abetting in this\r\nmurder. It is not necessary that he should have done any thing; it is\r\nenough that he was ready to act, and in a place to act. If his being in\r\nBrown Street, by appointment, at the time of the murder, emboldened the\r\npurpose and encouraged the heart of the murderer, by the hope of instant\r\naid, if aid should become necessary, then, without doubt, he was\r\npresent, aiding and abetting, and was a principal in the murder.\r\n\r\nI now proceed, Gentlemen, to the consideration of the testimony of Mr.\r\nColman. Although this evidence bears on every material part of the\r\ncause, I have purposely avoided every comment on it till the present\r\nmoment, when I have done with the other evidence in the case. As to the\r\nadmission of this evidence, there has been a great struggle, and its\r\nimportance demanded it. The general rule of law is, that confessions are\r\nto be received as evidence. They are entitled to great or to little\r\nconsideration, according to the circumstances under which they are made.\r\nVoluntary, deliberate confessions are the most important and\r\nsatisfactory evidence, but confessions hastily made, or improperly\r\nobtained, are entitled to little or no consideration. It is always to be\r\ninquired, whether they were purely voluntary, or were made under any\r\nundue influence of hope or fear; for, in general, if any influence were\r\nexerted on the mind of the person confessing, such confessions are not\r\nto be submitted to a jury.\r\n\r\nWho is Mr. Colman? He is an intelligent, accurate, and cautious witness;\r\na gentleman of high and well-known character, and of unquestionable\r\nveracity; as a clergyman, highly respectable; as a man, of fair name and\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nWhy was Mr. Colman with the prisoner? Joseph J. Knapp was his\r\nparishioner; he was the head of a family, and had been married by Mr.\r\nColman. The interests of that family were dear to him. He felt for their\r\nafflictions, and was anxious to alleviate their sufferings. He went from\r\nthe purest and best of motives to visit Joseph Knapp. He came to save,\r\nnot to destroy; to rescue, not to take away life. In this family he\r\nthought there might be a chance to save one. It is a misconstruction of\r\nMr. Colman's motives, at once the most strange and the most\r\nuncharitable, a perversion of all just views of his conduct and\r\nintentions the most unaccountable, to represent him as acting, on this\r\noccasion, in hostility to any one, or as desirous of injuring or\r\nendangering any one. He has stated his own motives, and his own conduct,\r\nin a manner to command universal belief and universal respect. For\r\nintelligence, for consistency, for accuracy, for caution, for candor,\r\nnever did witness acquit himself better, or stand fairer. In all that he\r\ndid as a man, and all he has said as a witness, he has shown himself\r\nworthy of entire regard.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, very important confessions made by the prisoner are\r\nsworn to by Mr. Colman. They were made in the prisoner's cell, where Mr.\r\nColman had gone with the prisoner's brother, N. Phippen Knapp. Whatever\r\nconversation took place was in the presence of N.P. Knapp. Now, on the\r\npart of the prisoner, two things are asserted; first, that such\r\ninducements were suggested to the prisoner, in this interview, that no\r\nconfessions made by him ought to be received; second, that, in point of\r\nfact, he made no such confessions as Mr. Colman testifies to, nor,\r\nindeed, any confessions at all. These two propositions are attempted to\r\nbe supported by the testimony of N.P. Knapp. These two witnesses, Mr.\r\nColman and N.P. Knapp, differ entirely. There is no possibility of\r\nreconciling them. No charity can cover both. One or the other has sworn\r\nfalsely. If N.P. Knapp be believed, Mr. Colman's testimony must be\r\nwholly disregarded. It is, then, a question of credit, a question of\r\nbelief between the two witnesses. As you decide between these, so you\r\nwill decide on all this part of the case.\r\n\r\nMr. Colman has given you a plain narrative, a consistent account, and\r\nhas uniformly stated the same things. He is not contradicted, except by\r\nthe testimony of Phippen Knapp. He is influenced, as far as we can see,\r\nby no bias, or prejudice, any more than other men, except so far as his\r\ncharacter is now at stake. He has feelings on this point, doubtless, and\r\nought to have. If what he has stated be not true, I cannot see any\r\nground for his escape. If he be a true man, he must have heard what he\r\ntestifies. No treachery of memory brings to memory things that never\r\ntook place. There is no reconciling his evidence with good intention, if\r\nthe facts in it are not as he states them. He is on trial as to his\r\nveracity.\r\n\r\nThe relation in which the other witness stands deserves your careful\r\nconsideration. He is a member of the family. He has the lives of two\r\nbrothers depending, as he may think, on the effect of his evidence;\r\ndepending on every word he speaks. I hope he has not another\r\nresponsibility resting upon him. By the advice of a friend, and that\r\nfriend Mr. Colman, J. Knapp made a full and free confession, and\r\nobtained a promise of pardon. He has since, as you know, probably by the\r\nadvice of other friends, retracted that confession, and rejected the\r\noffered pardon. Events will show who of these friends and advisers\r\nadvised him best, and befriended him most. In the mean time, if this\r\nbrother, the witness, be one of these advisers, and advised the\r\nretraction, he has, most emphatically, the lives of his brothers resting\r\nupon his evidence and upon his conduct. Compare the situation of these\r\ntwo witnesses. Do you not see mighty motive enough on the one side, and\r\nwant of all motive on the other? I would gladly find an apology for that\r\nwitness, in his agonized feelings, in his distressed situation; in the\r\nagitation of that hour, or of this. I would gladly impute it to error,\r\nor to want of recollection, to confusion of mind, or disturbance of\r\nfeeling. I would gladly impute to any pardonable source that which\r\ncannot be reconciled to facts and to truth; but, even in a case calling\r\nfor so much sympathy, justice must yet prevail, and we must come to the\r\nconclusion, however reluctantly, which that demands from us.\r\n\r\nIt is said, Phippen Knapp was probably correct, because he knew he\r\nshould probably be called as a witness. Witness to what? When he says\r\nthere was no confession, what could he expect to bear witness of? But I\r\ndo not put it on the ground that he did not hear; I am compelled to put\r\nit on the other ground, that he did hear, and does not now truly tell\r\nwhat he heard.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Colman were out of the case, there are other reasons why the\r\nstory of Phippen Knapp should not be believed. It has in it inherent\r\nimprobabilities. It is unnatural, and inconsistent with the accompanying\r\ncircumstances. He tells you that they went \"to the cell of Frank, to see\r\nif he had any objection to taking a trial, and suffering his brother to\r\naccept the offer of pardon\"; in other words, to obtain Frank's consent\r\nto Joseph's making a confession; and in case this consent was not\r\nobtained, that the pardon would be offered to Frank. Did they bandy\r\nabout the chance of life, between these two, in this way? Did Mr.\r\nColman, after having given this pledge to Joseph, and after having\r\nreceived a disclosure from Joseph, go to the cell of Frank for such a\r\npurpose as this? It is impossible; it cannot be so.\r\n\r\nAgain, we know that Mr. Colman found the club the next day; that he went\r\ndirectly to the place of deposit, and found it at the first attempt,\r\nexactly where he says he had been informed it was. Now Phippen Knapp\r\nsays, that Frank had stated nothing respecting the club; that it was not\r\nmentioned in that conversation. He says, also, that he was present in\r\nthe cell of Joseph all the time that Mr. Colman was there; that he\r\nbelieves he heard all that was said in Joseph's cell; and that he did\r\nnot himself know where the club was, and never had known where it was,\r\nuntil he heard it stated in court. Now it is certain that Mr. Colman\r\nsays he did not learn the particular place of deposit of the club from\r\nJoseph; that he only learned from him that it was deposited under the\r\nsteps of the Howard Street meeting-house, without defining the\r\nparticular steps. It is certain, also, that he had more knowledge of the\r\nposition of the club than this; else how could he have placed his hand\r\non it so readily? and where else could he have obtained this knowledge,\r\nexcept from Frank?\r\n\r\n     Here Mr. Dexter said that Mr. Colman had had other interviews with\r\n     Joseph, and might have derived the information from him at previous\r\n     visits. Mr. Webster replied, that Mr. Colman had testified that he\r\n     learned nothing in relation to the club until this visit. Mr.\r\n     Dexter denied there being any such testimony. Mr. Colman's evidence\r\n     was read, from the notes of the judges, and several other persons,\r\n     and Mr. Webster then proceeded.\r\n\r\nMy point is to show that Phippen Knapp's story is not true, is not\r\nconsistent with itself; that, taking it for granted, as he says, that he\r\nheard all that was said to Mr. Colman in both cells, by Joseph and by\r\nFrank; and that Joseph did not state particularly where the club was\r\ndeposited; and that he knew as much about the place of deposit of the\r\nclub as Mr. Colman knew; why, then Mr. Colman must either have been\r\nmiraculously informed respecting the club, or Phippen Knapp has not told\r\nyou the whole truth. There is no reconciling this, without supposing\r\nthat Mr. Colman has misrepresented what took place in Joseph's cell, as\r\nwell as what took place in Frank's cell.\r\n\r\nAgain, Phippen Knapp is directly contradicted by Mr. Wheatland. Mr.\r\nWheatland tells the same story, as coming from Phippen Knapp, that\r\nColman now tells. Here there are two against one. Phippen Knapp says\r\nthat Frank made no confessions, and that he said he had none to make. In\r\nthis he is contradicted by Wheatland. He, Phippen Knapp, told Wheatland,\r\nthat Mr. Colman did ask Frank some questions, and that Frank answered\r\nthem. He told him also what these answers were. Wheatland does not\r\nrecollect the questions or answers, but recollects his reply; which was,\r\n\"Is not this _premature_? I think this answer is sufficient to make\r\nFrank a principal.\" Here Phippen Knapp opposes himself to Wheatland, as\r\nwell as to Mr. Colman. Do you believe Phippen Knapp against these two\r\nrespectable witnesses, or them against him?\r\n\r\nIs not Mr. Colman's testimony credible, natural, and proper? To judge of\r\nthis, you must go back to that scene.\r\n\r\nThe murder had been committed; the two Knapps were now arrested; four\r\npersons were already in jail supposed to be concerned in it, the\r\nCrowninshields, and Selman, and Chase. Another person at the Eastward\r\nwas supposed to be in the plot; it was important to learn the facts. To\r\ndo this, some one of those suspected must be admitted to turn state's\r\nwitness. The contest was, Who should have this privilege? It was\r\nunderstood that it was about to be offered to Palmer, then in Maine;\r\nthere was no good reason why he should have the preference. Mr. Colman\r\nfelt interested for the family of the Knapps, and particularly for\r\nJoseph. He was a young man who had hitherto maintained a fair standing\r\nin society; he was a husband. Mr. Colman was particularly intimate with\r\nhis family. With these views he went to the prison. He believed that he\r\nmight safely converse with the prisoner, because he thought confessions\r\nmade to a clergyman were sacred, and that he could not be called upon to\r\ndisclose them. He went, the first time, in the morning, and was\r\nrequested to come again. He went again at three o'clock; and was\r\nrequested to call again at five o'clock. In the mean time he saw the\r\nfather and Phippen, and they wished he would not go again, because it\r\nwould be said the prisoners were making confession. He said he had\r\nengaged to go again at five o'clock; but would not, if Phippen would\r\nexcuse him to Joseph. Phippen engaged to do this, and to meet him at his\r\noffice at five o'clock. Mr. Colman went to the office at the time, and\r\nwaited; but, as Phippen was not there, he walked down street, and saw\r\nhim coming from the jail. He met him, and while in conversation near the\r\nchurch, he saw Mrs. Beckford and Mrs. Knapp going in a chaise towards\r\nthe jail. He hastened to meet them, as he thought it not proper for them\r\nto go in at that time. While conversing with them near the jail, he\r\nreceived two distinct messages from Joseph, that he wished to see him.\r\nHe thought it proper to go; and accordingly went to Joseph's cell, and\r\nit was while there that the disclosures were made. Before Joseph had\r\nfinished his statement, Phippen came to the door; he was soon after\r\nadmitted. A short interval ensued, and they went together to the cell of\r\nFrank. Mr. Colman went in by invitation of Phippen; he had come directly\r\nfrom the cell of Joseph, where he had for the first time learned the\r\nincidents of the tragedy. He was incredulous as to some of the facts\r\nwhich he had learned, they were so different from his previous\r\nimpressions. He was desirous of knowing whether he could place\r\nconfidence in what Joseph had told him. He, therefore, put the questions\r\nto Frank, as he has testified before you; in answer to which Frank Knapp\r\ninformed him,--\r\n\r\n1. \"That the murder took place between ten and eleven o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n2. \"That Richard Crowninshield was alone in the house.\"\r\n\r\n3. \"That he, Frank Knapp, went home afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"That the club was deposited under the steps of the Howard Street\r\nmeeting-house, and under the part nearest the burying-ground, in a rat\r\nhole.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"That the dagger or daggers had been worked up at the factory.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that these five answers just fit the case; that they are just\r\nwhat was wanted, and neither more nor less. True, they are; but the\r\nreason is, because truth always fits. Truth is always congruous and\r\nagrees with itself: every truth in the universe agrees with every other\r\ntruth in the universe, whereas falsehoods not only disagree with truths,\r\nbut usually quarrel among themselves. Surely Mr. Colman is influenced by\r\nno bias, no prejudice; he has no feelings to warp him, except, now that\r\nhe is contradicted, he may feel an interest to be believed.\r\n\r\nIf you believe Mr. Colman, then the evidence is fairly in the case.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed on the ground that you do believe Mr. Colman.\r\n\r\nWhen told that Joseph had determined to confess, the defendant said, \"It\r\nis hard, or unfair, that Joseph should have the benefit of confessing,\r\nsince the thing was done for his benefit.\" What thing was done for his\r\nbenefit? Does not this carry an implication of the guilt of the\r\ndefendant? Does it not show that he had a knowledge of the object and\r\nhistory of the murder?\r\n\r\nThe defendant said, \"I told Joseph, when he proposed it, that it was a\r\nsilly business, and would get us into trouble.\" He knew, then, what this\r\nbusiness was; he knew that Joseph proposed it, and that he agreed to it,\r\nelse he could not get _us_ into trouble; he understood its bearing and\r\nits consequences. Thus much was said, under circumstances that make it\r\nclearly evidence against him, before there is any pretence of an\r\ninducement held out. And does not this prove him to have had a knowledge\r\nof the conspiracy?\r\n\r\nHe knew the daggers had been destroyed, and he knew who committed the\r\nmurder. How could he have innocently known these facts? Why, if by\r\nRichard's story, this shows him guilty of a knowledge of the murder, and\r\nof the conspiracy. More than all, he knew when the deed was done, and\r\nthat he went home afterwards. This shows his participation in that deed.\r\n\"Went home afterwards\"! Home, from what scene? home, from what fact?\r\nhome, from what transaction? home, from what place? This confirms the\r\nsupposition that the prisoner was in Brown Street for the purposes\r\nascribed to him. These questions were directly put, and directly\r\nanswered. He does not intimate that he received the information from\r\nanother. Now, if he knows the time, and went home afterwards, and does\r\nnot excuse himself, is not this an admission that he had a hand in this\r\nmurder? Already proved to be a conspirator in the murder, he now\r\nconfesses that he knew who did it, at what time it was done, that he was\r\nhimself out of his own house at the time, and went home afterwards. Is\r\nnot this conclusive, if not explained? Then comes the club. He told\r\nwhere it was. This is like possession of stolen goods. He is charged\r\nwith the guilty knowledge of this concealment. He must show, not say,\r\nhow he came by this knowledge. If a man be found with stolen goods, he\r\nmust prove how he came by them. The place of deposit of the club was\r\npremeditated and selected, and he knew where it was.\r\n\r\nJoseph Knapp was an accessory, and an accessory only; he knew only what\r\nwas told him. But the prisoner knew the particular spot in which the\r\nclub might be found. This shows his knowledge something more than that\r\nof an accessory. This presumption must be rebutted by evidence, or it\r\nstands strong against him. He has too much knowledge of this transaction\r\nto have come innocently by it. It must stand against him until he\r\nexplains it.\r\n\r\nThis testimony of Mr. Colman is represented as new matter, and therefore\r\nan attempt has been made to excite a prejudice against it. It is not\r\nso. How little is there in it, after all, that did not appear from other\r\nsources? It is mainly confirmatory. Compare what you learn from this\r\nconfession with what you before knew.\r\n\r\nAs to its being proposed by Joseph, was not that known?\r\n\r\nAs to Richard's being alone in the house, was not that known?\r\n\r\nAs to the daggers, was not that known?\r\n\r\nAs to the time of the murder, was not that known?\r\n\r\nAs to his being out that night, was not that known?\r\n\r\nAs to his returning afterwards, was not that known?\r\n\r\nAs to the club, was not that known?\r\n\r\nSo this information confirms what was known before, and fully confirms\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOne word as to the interview between Mr. Colman and Phippen Knapp on the\r\nturnpike. It is said that Mr. Colman's conduct in this matter is\r\ninconsistent with his testimony. There does not appear to me to be any\r\ninconsistency. He tells you that his object was to save Joseph, and to\r\nhurt no one, and least of all the prisoner at the bar. He had probably\r\ntold Mr. White the substance of what he heard at the prison. He had\r\nprobably told him that Frank confirmed what Joseph had confessed. He was\r\nunwilling to be the instrument of harm to Frank. He therefore, at the\r\nrequest of Phippen Knapp, wrote a note to Mr. White, requesting him to\r\nconsider Joseph as authority for the information he had received. He\r\ntells you that this is the only thing he has to regret, as it may seem\r\nto be an evasion, as he doubts whether it was entirely correct. If it\r\nwas an evasion, if it was a deviation, if it was an error, it was an\r\nerror of mercy, an error of kindness,--an error that proves he had no\r\nhostility to the prisoner at the bar. It does not in the least vary his\r\ntestimony, or affect its correctness. Gentlemen, I look on the evidence\r\nof Mr. Colman as highly important; not as bringing into the cause new\r\nfacts, but as confirming, in a very satisfactory manner, other evidence.\r\nIt is incredible that he can be false, and that he is seeking the\r\nprisoner's life through false swearing. If he is true, it is incredible\r\nthat the prisoner can be innocent.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have gone through with the evidence in this case, and have\r\nendeavored to state it plainly and fairly before you. I think there are\r\nconclusions to be drawn from it, the accuracy of which you cannot doubt.\r\nI think you cannot doubt that there was a conspiracy formed for the\r\npurpose of committing this murder, and who the conspirators were:\r\n\r\nThat you cannot doubt that the Crowninshields and the Knapps were the\r\nparties in this conspiracy:\r\n\r\nThat you cannot doubt that the prisoner at the bar knew that the murder\r\nwas to be done on the night of the 6th of April:\r\n\r\nThat you cannot doubt that the murderers of Captain White were the\r\nsuspicious persons seen in and about Brown Street on that night:\r\n\r\nThat you cannot doubt that Richard Crowninshield was the perpetrator of\r\nthat crime:\r\n\r\nThat you cannot doubt that the prisoner at the bar was in Brown Street\r\non that night.\r\n\r\nIf there, then it must be by agreement, to countenance, to aid the\r\nperpetrator. And if so, then he is guilty as PRINCIPAL.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, your whole concern should be to do your duty, and leave\r\nconsequences to take care of themselves. You will receive the law from\r\nthe court. Your verdict, it is true, may endanger the prisoner's life,\r\nbut then it is to save other lives. If the prisoner's guilt has been\r\nshown and proved beyond all reasonable doubt, you will convict him. If\r\nsuch reasonable doubts of guilt still remain, you will acquit him. You\r\nare the judges of the whole case. You owe a duty to the public, as well\r\nas to the prisoner at the bar. You cannot presume to be wiser than the\r\nlaw. Your duty is a plain, straightforward one. Doubtless we would all\r\njudge him in mercy. Towards him, as an individual, the law inculcates no\r\nhostility; but towards him, if proved to be a murderer, the law, and the\r\noaths you have taken, and public justice, demand that you do your duty.\r\n\r\nWith consciences satisfied with the discharge of duty, no consequences\r\ncan harm you. There is no evil that we cannot either face or fly from,\r\nbut the consciousness of duty disregarded. A sense of duty pursues us\r\never. It is omnipresent, like the Deity. If we take to ourselves the\r\nwings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, duty\r\nperformed, or duty violated, is still with us, for our happiness or our\r\nmisery. If we say the darkness shall cover us, in the darkness as in the\r\nlight our obligations are yet with us. We cannot escape their power, nor\r\nfly from their presence. They are with us in this life, will be with us\r\nat its close; and in that scene of inconceivable solemnity, which lies\r\nyet farther onward, we shall still find ourselves surrounded by the\r\nconsciousness of duty, to pain us wherever it has been violated, and to\r\nconsole us so far as God may have given us grace to perform it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Chief Justice Parker.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This seems to have been actually the case as regards J.F.\r\nKnapp.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: And yet this argument, so absurd in Mr. Webster's opinion,\r\nwas based on the exact fact.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: He did not.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: 4 Hawk. 201, Lib. 4, ch. 29, sec. 8.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPLY TO HAYNE.\r\n\r\nSECOND SPEECH ON \"FOOT'S RESOLUTION,\" DELIVERED IN THE SENATE OF THE\r\nUNITED STATES, ON THE 26TH AND 27TH OF JANUARY, 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mr. Webster having completed on January 20th his first speech on Foot's\r\nresolution, Mr. Benton spoke in reply, on the 20th and 21st of January,\r\n1830. Mr. Hayne of South Carolina followed on the same side, but, after\r\nsome time, gave way for a motion for adjournment. On Monday, the 25th,\r\nMr. Hayne resumed, and concluded his argument. Mr. Webster immediately\r\nrose in reply, but yielded the floor for a motion for adjournment.\r\n\r\nThe next day (26th January, 1830) Mr. Webster took the floor and\r\ndelivered the following speech, which has given such great celebrity to\r\nthe debate. The circumstances connected with this remarkable effort of\r\nparliamentary eloquence are vividly set forth in Mr. Everett's Memoir,\r\nprefixed to the first volume of Mr. Webster's Works.]\r\n\r\nMr. President,--When the mariner has been tossed for many days in thick\r\nweather, and on an unknown sea, he naturally avails himself of the first\r\npause in the storm, the earliest glance of the sun, to take his\r\nlatitude, and ascertain how far the elements have driven him from his\r\ntrue course. Let us imitate this prudence, and, before we float farther\r\non the waves of this debate, refer to the point from which we departed,\r\nthat we may at least be able to conjecture where we now are. I ask for\r\nthe reading of the resolution before the Senate.\r\n\r\n     The Secretary read the resolution, as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the Committee on Public Lands be instructed to\r\n     inquire and report the quantity of public lands remaining unsold\r\n     within each State and Territory, and whether it be expedient to\r\n     limit for a certain period the sales of the public lands to such\r\n     lands only as have heretofore been offered for sale, and are now\r\n     subject to entry at the minimum price. And, also, whether the\r\n     office of Surveyor-General, and some of the land offices, may not\r\n     be abolished without detriment to the public interest; or whether\r\n     it be expedient to adopt measures to hasten the sales and extend\r\n     more rapidly the surveys of the public lands.\"\r\n\r\nWe have thus heard, Sir, what the resolution is which is actually before\r\nus for consideration; and it will readily occur to every one, that it is\r\nalmost the only subject about which something has not been said in the\r\nspeech, running through two days, by which the Senate has been\r\nentertained by the gentleman from South Carolina. Every topic in the\r\nwide range of our public affairs, whether past or present,--every thing,\r\ngeneral or local, whether belonging to national politics or party\r\npolitics,--seems to have attracted more or less of the honorable\r\nmember's attention, save only the resolution before the Senate. He has\r\nspoken of every thing but the public lands; they have escaped his\r\nnotice. To that subject, in all his excursions, he has not paid even the\r\ncold respect of a passing glance.\r\n\r\nWhen this debate, Sir, was to be resumed, on Thursday morning, it so\r\nhappened that it would have been convenient for me to be elsewhere. The\r\nhonorable member, however, did not incline to put off the discussion to\r\nanother day. He had a shot, he said, to return, and he wished to\r\ndischarge it. That shot, Sir, which he thus kindly informed us was\r\ncoming, that we might stand out of the way, or prepare ourselves to fall\r\nby it and die with decency, has now been received. Under all advantages,\r\nand with expectation awakened by the tone which preceded it, it has been\r\ndischarged, and has spent its force. It may become me to say no more of\r\nits effect, than that, if nobody is found, after all, either killed or\r\nwounded, it is not the first time, in the history of human affairs, that\r\nthe vigor and success of the war have not quite come up to the lofty and\r\nsounding phrase of the manifesto.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, Sir, in declining to postpone the debate, told the\r\nSenate, with the emphasis of his hand upon his heart, that there was\r\nsomething rankling _here_, which he wished to relieve. [Mr. Hayne rose,\r\nand disclaimed having used the word _rankling_.] It would not, Mr.\r\nPresident, be safe for the honorable member to appeal to those around\r\nhim, upon the question whether he did in fact make use of that word. But\r\nhe may have been unconscious of it. At any rate, it is enough that he\r\ndisclaims it. But still, with or without the use of that particular\r\nword, he had yet something _here_, he said, of which he wished to rid\r\nhimself by an immediate reply. In this respect, Sir, I have a great\r\nadvantage over the honorable gentleman. There is nothing _here_, Sir,\r\nwhich gives me the slightest uneasiness; neither fear, nor anger, nor\r\nthat which is sometimes more troublesome than either, the consciousness\r\nof having been in the wrong. There is nothing, either originating\r\n_here_, or now received _here_ by the gentleman's shot. Nothing\r\noriginating here, for I had not the slightest feeling of unkindness\r\ntowards the honorable member. Some passages, it is true, had occurred\r\nsince our acquaintance in this body, which I could have wished might\r\nhave been otherwise; but I had used philosophy and forgotten them. I\r\npaid the honorable member the attention of listening with respect to his\r\nfirst speech; and when he sat down, though surprised, and I must even\r\nsay astonished, at some of his opinions, nothing was farther from my\r\nintention than to commence any personal warfare. Through the whole of\r\nthe few remarks I made in answer, I avoided, studiously and carefully,\r\nevery thing which I thought possible to be construed into disrespect.\r\nAnd, Sir, while there is thus nothing originating _here_ which I have\r\nwished at any time, or now wish, to discharge, I must repeat, also, that\r\nnothing has been received _here_ which _rankles_, or in any way gives me\r\nannoyance. I will not accuse the honorable member of violating the rules\r\nof civilized war; I will not say, that he poisoned his arrows. But\r\nwhether his shafts were, or were not, dipped in that which would have\r\ncaused rankling if they had reached their destination, there was not, as\r\nit happened, quite strength enough in the bow to bring them to their\r\nmark. If he wishes now to gather up those shafts, he must look for them\r\nelsewhere; they will not be found fixed and quivering in the object at\r\nwhich they were aimed.\r\n\r\nThe honorable member complained that I had slept on his speech. I must\r\nhave slept on it, or not slept at all. The moment the honorable member\r\nsat down, his friend from Missouri rose, and, with much honeyed\r\ncommendation of the speech, suggested that the impressions which it had\r\nproduced were too charming and delightful to be disturbed by other\r\nsentiments or other sounds, and proposed that the Senate should adjourn.\r\nWould it have been quite amiable in me, Sir, to interrupt this excellent\r\ngood feeling? Must I not have been absolutely malicious, if I could have\r\nthrust myself forward, to destroy sensations thus pleasing? Was it not\r\nmuch better and kinder, both to sleep upon them myself, and to allow\r\nothers also the pleasure of sleeping upon them? But if it be meant, by\r\nsleeping upon his speech, that I took time to prepare a reply to it, it\r\nis quite a mistake. Owing to other engagements, I could not employ even\r\nthe interval between the adjournment of the Senate and its meeting the\r\nnext morning, in attention to the subject of this debate. Nevertheless,\r\nSir, the mere matter of fact is undoubtedly true. I did sleep on the\r\ngentleman's speech, and slept soundly. And I slept equally well on his\r\nspeech of yesterday, to which I am now replying. It is quite possible\r\nthat in this respect, also, I possess some advantage over the honorable\r\nmember, attributable, doubtless, to a cooler temperament on my part;\r\nfor, in truth, I slept upon his speeches remarkably well.\r\n\r\nBut the gentleman inquires why _he_ was made the object of such a reply.\r\nWhy was _he_ singled out? If an attack has been made on the East, he, he\r\nassures us, did not begin it; it was made by the gentleman from\r\nMissouri. Sir, I answered the gentleman's speech because I happened to\r\nhear it; and because, also, I chose to give an answer to that speech,\r\nwhich, if unanswered, I thought most likely to produce injurious\r\nimpressions. I did not stop to inquire who was the original drawer of\r\nthe bill. I found a responsible indorser before me, and it was my\r\npurpose to hold him liable, and to bring him to his just responsibility,\r\nwithout delay. But, Sir, this interrogatory of the honorable member was\r\nonly introductory to another. He proceeded to ask me whether I had\r\nturned upon him, in this debate, from the consciousness that I should\r\nfind an overmatch, if I ventured on a contest with his friend from\r\nMissouri. If, Sir, the honorable member, _modestiae gratia_, had chosen\r\nthus to defer to his friend, and to pay him a compliment, without\r\nintentional disparagement to others, it would have been quite according\r\nto the friendly courtesies of debate, and not at all ungrateful to my\r\nown feelings. I am not one of those, Sir, who esteem any tribute of\r\nregard, whether light and occasional, or more serious and deliberate,\r\nwhich may be bestowed on others, as so much unjustly withholden from\r\nthemselves. But the tone and manner of the gentleman's question forbid\r\nme thus to interpret it. I am not at liberty to consider it as nothing\r\nmore than a civility to his friend. It had an air of taunt and\r\ndisparagement, something of the loftiness of asserted superiority, which\r\ndoes not allow me to pass it over without notice. It was put as a\r\nquestion for me to answer, and so put as if it were difficult for me to\r\nanswer, whether I deemed the member from Missouri an overmatch for\r\nmyself in debate here. It seems to me, Sir, that this is extraordinary\r\nlanguage, and an extraordinary tone, for the discussions of this body.\r\n\r\nMatches and overmatches! Those terms are more applicable elsewhere than\r\nhere, and fitter for other assemblies than this. Sir, the gentleman\r\nseems to forget where and what we are. This is a Senate, a Senate of\r\nequals, of men of individual honor and personal character, and of\r\nabsolute independence. We know no masters, we acknowledge no dictators.\r\nThis is a hall for mutual consultation and discussion; not an arena for\r\nthe exhibition of champions. I offer myself, Sir, as a match for no man;\r\nI throw the challenge of debate at no man's feet. But then, Sir, since\r\nthe honorable member has put the question in a manner that calls for an\r\nanswer, I will give him an answer; and I tell him, that, holding myself\r\nto be the humblest of the members here, I yet know nothing in the arm of\r\nhis friend from Missouri, either alone or when aided by the arm of _his_\r\nfriend from South Carolina, that need deter even me from espousing\r\nwhatever opinions I may choose to espouse, from debating whenever I may\r\nchoose to debate, or from speaking whatever I may see fit to say, on the\r\nfloor of the Senate. Sir, when uttered as matter of commendation or\r\ncompliment, I should dissent from nothing which the honorable member\r\nmight say of his friend. Still less do I put forth any pretensions of my\r\nown. But when put to me as matter of taunt, I throw it back, and say to\r\nthe gentleman, that he could possibly say nothing less likely than such\r\na comparison to wound my pride of personal character. The anger of its\r\ntone rescued the remark from intentional irony, which otherwise,\r\nprobably, would have been its general acceptation. But, Sir, if it be\r\nimagined that by this mutual quotation and commendation; if it be\r\nsupposed that, by casting the characters of the drama assigning to each\r\nhis part, to one the attack, to another the cry of onset; or if it be\r\nthought that, by a loud and empty vaunt of anticipated victory, any\r\nlaurels are to be won here; if it be imagined, especially, that any or\r\nall these things will shake any purpose of mine,--I can tell the\r\nhonorable member, once for all, that he is greatly mistaken, and that he\r\nis dealing with one of whose temper and character he has yet much to\r\nlearn. Sir, I shall not allow myself, on this occasion, I hope on no\r\noccasion, to be betrayed into any loss of temper; but if provoked, as I\r\ntrust I never shall be, into crimination and recrimination, the\r\nhonorable member may perhaps find, that, in that contest, there will be\r\nblows to take as well as blows to give; that others can state\r\ncomparisons as significant, at least, as his own, and that his impunity\r\nmay possibly demand of him whatever powers of taunt and sarcasm he may\r\npossess. I commend him to a prudent husbandry of his resources.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the Coalition! The Coalition! Ay, \"the murdered Coalition!\"\r\nThe gentleman asks, if I were led or frighted into this debate by the\r\nspectre of the Coalition. \"Was it the ghost of the murdered Coalition,\"\r\nhe exclaims, \"which haunted the member from Massachusetts; and which,\r\nlike the ghost of Banquo, would never down?\" \"The murdered Coalition!\"\r\nSir, this charge of a coalition, in reference to the late\r\nadministration, is not original with the honorable member. It did not\r\nspring up in the Senate. Whether as a fact, as an argument, or as an\r\nembellishment, it is all borrowed. He adopts it, indeed, from a very low\r\norigin, and a still lower present condition. It is one of the thousand\r\ncalumnies with which the press teemed, during an excited political\r\ncanvass. It was a charge, of which there was not only no proof or\r\nprobability, but which was in itself wholly impossible to be true. No\r\nman of common information ever believed a syllable of it. Yet it was of\r\nthat class of falsehoods, which, by continued repetition, through all\r\nthe organs of detraction and abuse, are capable of misleading those who\r\nare already far misled, and of further fanning passion already kindling\r\ninto flame. Doubtless it served in its day, and in greater or less\r\ndegree, the end designed by it. Having done that, it has sunk into the\r\ngeneral mass of stale and loathed calumnies. It is the very cast-off\r\nslough of a polluted and shameless press. Incapable of further mischief,\r\nit lies in the sewer, lifeless and despised. It is not now, Sir, in the\r\npower of the honorable member to give it dignity or decency, by\r\nattempting to elevate it, and to introduce it into the Senate. He cannot\r\nchange it from what it is, an object of general disgust and scorn. On\r\nthe contrary, the contact, if he choose to touch it, is more likely to\r\ndrag him down, down, to the place where it lies itself.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the honorable member was not, for other reasons, entirely\r\nhappy in his allusion to the story of Banquo's murder and Banquo's\r\nghost. It was not, I think, the friends, but the enemies of the murdered\r\nBanquo, at whose bidding his spirit would not _down_. The honorable\r\ngentleman is fresh in his reading of the English classics, and can put\r\nme right if I am wrong: but, according to my poor recollection, it was\r\nat those who had begun with caresses and ended with foul and treacherous\r\nmurder that the gory locks were shaken. The ghost of Banquo, like that\r\nof Hamlet, was an honest ghost. It disturbed no innocent man. It knew\r\nwhere its appearance would strike terror, and who would cry out, A\r\nghost! It made itself visible in the right quarter, and compelled the\r\nguilty and the conscience-smitten, and none others, to start, with,\r\n\r\n    \"Pr'ythee, see there! behold!--look! lo,\r\n    If I stand here, I saw him!\"\r\n\r\nTHEIR eyeballs were seared (was it not so, Sir?) who had thought to\r\nshield themselves by concealing their own hand, and laying the\r\nimputation of the crime on a low and hireling agency in wickedness; who\r\nhad vainly attempted to stifle the workings of their own coward\r\nconsciences by ejaculating through white lips and chattering teeth,\r\n\"Thou canst not say I did it!\" I have misread the great poet if those\r\nwho had no way partaken in the deed of the death, either found that they\r\nwere, or _feared that they should be_, pushed from their stools by the\r\nghost of the slain, or exclaimed to a spectre created by their own fears\r\nand their own remorse, \"Avaunt! and quit our sight!\"\r\n\r\nThere is another particular, Sir, in which the honorable member's quick\r\nperception of resemblances might, I should think, have seen something in\r\nthe story of Banquo, making it not altogether a subject of the most\r\npleasant contemplation. Those who murdered Banquo, what did they win by\r\nit? Substantial good? Permanent power? Or disappointment, rather, and\r\nsore mortification,--dust and ashes, the common fate of vaulting\r\nambition overleaping itself? Did not even-handed justice erelong commend\r\nthe poisoned chalice to their own lips? Did they not soon find that for\r\nanother they had \"filed their mind\"? that their ambition, though\r\napparently for the moment successful, had but put a barren sceptre in\r\ntheir grasp? Ay, Sir,\r\n\r\n                \"a barren sceptre in their gripe,\r\n    _Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand,\r\n    No son of theirs succeeding_.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I need pursue the allusion no farther. I leave the honorable\r\ngentleman to run it out at his leisure, and to derive from it all the\r\ngratification it is calculated to administer. If he finds himself\r\npleased with the associations, and prepared to be quite satisfied,\r\nthough the parallel should be entirely completed, I had almost said, I\r\nam satisfied also; but that I shall think of. Yes, Sir, I will think of\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my observations the other day, Mr. President, I paid a\r\npassing tribute of respect to a very worthy man, Mr. Dane of\r\nMassachusetts. It so happened that he drew the Ordinance of 1787, for\r\nthe government of the Northwestern Territory. A man of so much ability,\r\nand so little pretence; of so great a capacity to do good, and so\r\nunmixed a disposition to do it for its own sake; a gentleman who had\r\nacted an important part, forty years ago, in a measure the influence of\r\nwhich is still deeply felt in the very matter which was the subject of\r\ndebate,--might, I thought, receive from me a commendatory recognition.\r\nBut the honorable member was inclined to be facetious on the subject. He\r\nwas rather disposed to make it matter of ridicule, that I had introduced\r\ninto the debate the name of one Nathan Dane, of whom he assures us he\r\nhad never before heard. Sir, if the honorable member had never before\r\nheard of Mr. Dane, I am sorry for it. It shows him less acquainted with\r\nthe public men of the country than I had supposed. Let me tell him,\r\nhowever, that a sneer from him at the mention of the name of Mr. Dane is\r\nin bad taste. It may well be a high mark of ambition, Sir, either with\r\nthe honorable gentleman or myself, to accomplish as much to make our\r\nnames known to advantage, and remembered with gratitude, as Mr. Dane has\r\naccomplished. But the truth is, Sir, I suspect, that Mr. Dane lives a\r\nlittle too far north. He is of Massachusetts, and too near the north\r\nstar to be reached by the honorable gentleman's telescope. If his sphere\r\nhad happened to range south of Mason and Dixon's line, he might,\r\nprobably, have come within the scope of his vision.\r\n\r\nI spoke, Sir, of the Ordinance of 1787, which prohibits slavery, in all\r\nfuture times, northwest of the Ohio, as a measure of great wisdom and\r\nforesight, and one which had been attended with highly beneficial and\r\npermanent consequences. I supposed that, on this point, no two gentlemen\r\nin the Senate could entertain different opinions. But the simple\r\nexpression of this sentiment has led the gentleman, not only into a\r\nlabored defence of slavery, in the abstract, and on principle, but also\r\ninto a warm accusation against me, as having attacked the system of\r\ndomestic slavery now existing in the Southern States. For all this,\r\nthere was not the slightest foundation, in any thing said or intimated\r\nby me. I did not utter a single word which any ingenuity could torture\r\ninto an attack on the slavery of the South. I said, only, that it was\r\nhighly wise and useful, in legislating for the Northwestern country\r\nwhile it was yet a wilderness, to prohibit the introduction of slaves;\r\nand I added, that I presumed there was no reflecting and intelligent\r\nperson, in the neighboring State of Kentucky, who would doubt that, if\r\nthe same prohibition had been extended, at the same early period, over\r\nthat commonwealth, her strength and population would, at this day, have\r\nbeen far greater than they are. If these opinions be thought doubtful,\r\nthey are nevertheless, I trust, neither extraordinary nor disrespectful.\r\nThey attack nobody and menace nobody. And yet, Sir, the gentleman's\r\noptics have discovered, even in the mere expression of this sentiment,\r\nwhat he calls the very spirit of the Missouri question! He represents me\r\nas making an onset on the whole South, and manifesting a spirit which\r\nwould interfere with, and disturb, their domestic condition!\r\n\r\nSir, this injustice no otherwise surprises me, than as it is committed\r\nhere, and committed without the slightest pretence of ground for it. I\r\nsay it only surprises me as being done here; for I know full well, that\r\nit is, and has been, the settled policy of some persons in the South,\r\nfor years, to represent the people of the North as disposed to interfere\r\nwith them in their own exclusive and peculiar concerns. This is a\r\ndelicate and sensitive point in Southern feeling; and of late years it\r\nhas always been touched, and generally with effect, whenever the object\r\nhas been to unite the whole South against Northern men or Northern\r\nmeasures. This feeling, always carefully kept alive, and maintained at\r\ntoo intense a heat to admit discrimination or reflection, is a lever of\r\ngreat power in our political machine. It moves vast bodies, and gives to\r\nthem one and the same direction. But it is without adequate cause, and\r\nthe suspicion which exists is wholly groundless. There is not, and never\r\nhas been, a disposition in the North to interfere with these interests\r\nof the South. Such interference has never been supposed to be within the\r\npower of government; nor has it been in any way attempted. The slavery\r\nof the South has always been regarded as a matter of domestic policy,\r\nleft with the States themselves, and with which the Federal government\r\nhad nothing to do. Certainly, Sir, I am, and ever have been, of that\r\nopinion. The gentleman, indeed, argues that slavery, in the abstract, is\r\nno evil. Most assuredly I need not say I differ with him, altogether and\r\nmost widely, on that point. I regard domestic slavery as one of the\r\ngreatest evils, both moral and political. But whether it be a malady,\r\nand whether it be curable, and if so, by what means; or, on the other\r\nhand, whether it be the _vulnus immedicabile_ of the social system, I\r\nleave it to those whose right and duty it is to inquire and to decide.\r\nAnd this I believe, Sir, is, and uniformly has been, the sentiment of\r\nthe North. Let us look a little at the history of this matter.\r\n\r\nWhen the present Constitution was submitted for the ratification of the\r\npeople, there were those who imagined that the powers of the government\r\nwhich it proposed to establish might, in some possible mode, be exerted\r\nin measures tending to the abolition of slavery. This suggestion would\r\nof course attract much attention in the Southern conventions. In that of\r\nVirginia, Governor Randolph said:--\r\n\r\n\"I hope there is none here, who, considering the subject in the calm\r\nlight of philosophy, will make an objection dishonorable to Virginia;\r\nthat, at the moment they are securing the rights of their citizens, an\r\nobjection is started, that there is a spark of hope that those\r\nunfortunate men now held in bondage may, by the operation of the general\r\ngovernment, be made free.\"\r\n\r\nAt the very first Congress, petitions on the subject were presented, if\r\nI mistake not, from different States. The Pennsylvania society for\r\npromoting the abolition of slavery took a lead, and laid before Congress\r\na memorial, praying Congress to promote the abolition by such powers as\r\nit possessed. This memorial was referred, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, to a select committee, consisting of Mr. Foster of New\r\nHampshire, Mr. Gerry of Massachusetts, Mr. Huntington of Connecticut,\r\nMr. Lawrence of New York, Mr. Sinnickson of New Jersey, Mr. Hartley of\r\nPennsylvania, and Mr. Parker of Virginia,--all of them, Sir, as you will\r\nobserve, Northern men but the last. This committee made a report, which\r\nwas referred to a committee of the whole House, and there considered and\r\ndiscussed for several days; and being amended, although without material\r\nalteration, it was made to express three distinct propositions, on the\r\nsubject of slavery and the slave-trade. First, in the words of the\r\nConstitution, that Congress could not, prior to the year 1808, prohibit\r\nthe migration or importation of such persons as any of the States then\r\nexisting should think proper to admit; and, secondly, that Congress had\r\nauthority to restrain the citizens of the United States from carrying on\r\nthe African slave-trade, for the purpose of supplying foreign countries.\r\nOn this proposition, our early laws against those who engage in that\r\ntraffic are founded. The third proposition, and that which bears on the\r\npresent question, was expressed in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That Congress have no authority to interfere in the\r\nemancipation of slaves, or in the treatment of them in any of the\r\nStates; it remaining with the several States alone to provide rules and\r\nregulations therein which humanity and true policy may require.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution received the sanction of the House of Representatives so\r\nearly as March, 1790. And now, Sir, the honorable member will allow me\r\nto remind him, that not only were the select committee who reported the\r\nresolution, with a single exception, all Northern men, but also that, of\r\nthe members then composing the House of Representatives, a large\r\nmajority, I believe nearly two thirds, were Northern men also.\r\n\r\nThe House agreed to insert these resolutions in its journal; and from\r\nthat day to this it has never been maintained or contended at the North,\r\nthat Congress had any authority to regulate or interfere with the\r\ncondition of slaves in the several States. No Northern gentleman, to my\r\nknowledge, has moved any such question in either House of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe fears of the South, whatever fears they might have entertained, were\r\nallayed and quieted by this early decision; and so remained till they\r\nwere excited afresh, without cause, but for collateral and indirect\r\npurposes. When it became necessary, or was thought so, by some political\r\npersons, to find an unvarying ground for the exclusion of Northern men\r\nfrom confidence and from lead in the affairs of the republic, then, and\r\nnot till then, the cry was raised, and the feeling industriously\r\nexcited, that the influence of Northern men in the public counsels would\r\nendanger the relation of master and slave. For myself, I claim no other\r\nmerit than that this gross and enormous injustice towards the whole\r\nNorth has not wrought upon me to change my opinions or my political\r\nconduct. I hope I am above violating my principles, even under the smart\r\nof injury and false imputations. Unjust suspicions and undeserved\r\nreproach, whatever pain I may experience from them, will not induce me,\r\nI trust, to overstep the limits of constitutional duty, or to encroach\r\non the rights of others. The domestic slavery of the Southern States I\r\nleave where I find it,--in the hands of their own governments. It is\r\ntheir affair, not mine. Nor do I complain of the peculiar effect which\r\nthe magnitude of that population has had in the distribution of power\r\nunder this Federal government. We know, Sir, that the representation of\r\nthe States in the other house is not equal. We know that great advantage\r\nin that respect is enjoyed by the slave-holding States; and we know,\r\ntoo, that the intended equivalent for that advantage, that is to say,\r\nthe imposition of direct taxes in the same ratio, has become merely\r\nnominal, the habit of the government being almost invariably to collect\r\nits revenue from other sources and in other modes. Nevertheless, I do\r\nnot complain; nor would I countenance any movement to alter this\r\narrangement of representation. It is the original bargain, the compact;\r\nlet it stand; let the advantage of it be fully enjoyed. The Union itself\r\nis too full of benefit to be hazarded in propositions for changing its\r\noriginal basis. I go for the Constitution as it is, and for the Union as\r\nit is. But I am resolved not to submit in silence to accusations, either\r\nagainst myself individually or against the North, wholly unfounded and\r\nunjust,--accusations which impute to us a disposition to evade the\r\nconstitutional compact, and to extend the power of the government over\r\nthe internal laws and domestic condition of the States. All such\r\naccusations, wherever and whenever made, all insinuations of the\r\nexistence of any such purposes, I know and feel to be groundless and\r\ninjurious. And we must confide in Southern gentlemen themselves; we must\r\ntrust to those whose integrity of heart and magnanimity of feeling will\r\nlead them to a desire to maintain and disseminate truth, and who possess\r\nthe means of its diffusion with the Southern public; we must leave it to\r\nthem to disabuse that public of its prejudices. But in the mean time,\r\nfor my own part, I shall continue to act justly, whether those towards\r\nwhom justice is exercised receive it with candor or with contumely.\r\n\r\nHaving had occasion to recur to the Ordinance of 1787, in order to\r\ndefend myself against the inferences which the honorable member has\r\nchosen to draw from my former observations on that subject, I am not\r\nwilling now entirely to take leave of it without another remark. It need\r\nhardly be said, that that paper expresses just sentiments on the great\r\nsubject of civil and religious liberty. Such sentiments were common, and\r\nabound in all our state papers of that day. But this Ordinance did that\r\nwhich was not so common, and which is not even now universal; that is,\r\nit set forth and declared it to be a high and binding duty of government\r\nitself to support schools and advance the means of education, on the\r\nplain reason that religion, morality, and knowledge are necessary to\r\ngood government, and to the happiness of mankind. One observation\r\nfurther. The important provision incorporated into the Constitution of\r\nthe United States, and into several of those of the States, and\r\nrecently, as we have seen, adopted into the reformed constitution of\r\nVirginia, restraining legislative power in questions of private right,\r\nand from impairing the obligation of contracts, is first introduced and\r\nestablished, as far as I am informed, as matter of express written\r\nconstitutional law, in this Ordinance of 1787. And I must add, also, in\r\nregard to the author of the Ordinance, who has not had the happiness to\r\nattract the gentleman's notice heretofore, nor to avoid his sarcasm now,\r\nthat he was chairman of that select committee of the old Congress, whose\r\nreport first expressed the strong sense of that body, that the old\r\nConfederation was not adequate to the exigencies of the country, and\r\nrecommended to the States to send delegates to the convention which\r\nformed the present Constitution.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to transfer from the North to the South the\r\nhonor of this exclusion of slavery from the Northwestern Territory. The\r\njournal, without argument or comment, refutes such attempts. The cession\r\nby Virginia was made in March, 1784. On the 19th of April following, a\r\ncommittee, consisting of Messrs. Jefferson, Chase, and Howell, reported\r\na plan for a temporary government of the territory, in which was this\r\narticle: \"That, after the year 1800, there shall be neither slavery nor\r\ninvoluntary servitude in any of the said States, otherwise than in\r\npunishment of crimes, whereof the party shall have been convicted.\" Mr.\r\nSpaight of North Carolina moved to strike out this paragraph. The\r\nquestion was put, according to the form then practised, \"Shall these\r\nwords stand as a part of the plan?\" New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, seven\r\nStates, voted in the affirmative; Maryland, Virginia, and South\r\nCarolina, in the negative. North Carolina was divided. As the consent of\r\nnine States was necessary, the words could not stand, and were struck\r\nout accordingly. Mr. Jefferson voted for the clause, but was overruled\r\nby his colleagues.\r\n\r\nIn March of the next year (1785), Mr. King of Massachusetts, seconded by\r\nMr. Ellery of Rhode Island, proposed the formerly rejected article, with\r\nthis addition: \"And that this regulation shall be an article of compact,\r\nand remain a fundamental principle of the constitutions between the\r\nthirteen original States, and each of the States described in the\r\nresolve.\" On this clause, which provided the adequate and thorough\r\nsecurity, the eight Northern States at that time voted affirmatively,\r\nand the four Southern States negatively. The votes of nine States were\r\nnot yet obtained, and thus the provision was again rejected by the\r\nSouthern States. The perseverance of the North held out, and two years\r\nafterwards the object was attained. It is no derogation from the credit,\r\nwhatever that may be, of drawing the Ordinance, that its principles had\r\nbefore been prepared and discussed, in the form of resolutions. If one\r\nshould reason in that way, what would become of the distinguished honor\r\nof the author of the Declaration of Independence? There is not a\r\nsentiment in that paper which had not been voted and resolved in the\r\nassemblies, and other popular bodies in the country, over and over\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut the honorable member has now found out that this gentleman, Mr.\r\nDane, was a member of the Hartford Convention. However uninformed the\r\nhonorable member may be of characters and occurrences at the North, it\r\nwould seem that he has at his elbow, on this occasion, some high-minded\r\nand lofty spirit, some magnanimous and true-hearted monitor, possessing\r\nthe means of local knowledge, and ready to supply the honorable member\r\nwith every thing, down even to forgotten and moth-eaten two-penny\r\npamphlets, which may be used to the disadvantage of his own country. But\r\nas to the Hartford Convention, Sir, allow me to say, that the\r\nproceedings of that body seem now to be less read and studied in New\r\nEngland than farther South. They appear to be looked to, not in New\r\nEngland, but elsewhere, for the purpose of seeing how far they may serve\r\nas a precedent. But they will not answer the purpose, they are quite too\r\ntame. The latitude in which they originated was too cold. Other\r\nconventions, of more recent existence, have gone a whole bar's length\r\nbeyond it. The learned doctors of Colleton and Abbeville have pushed\r\ntheir commentaries on the Hartford collect so far, that the original\r\ntext-writers are thrown entirely into the shade. I have nothing to do,\r\nSir, with the Hartford Convention. Its journal, which the gentleman has\r\nquoted, I never read. So far as the honorable member may discover in its\r\nproceedings a spirit in any degree resembling that which was avowed and\r\njustified in those other conventions to which I have alluded, or so far\r\nas those proceedings can be shown to be disloyal to the Constitution, or\r\ntending to disunion, so far I shall be as ready as any one to bestow on\r\nthem reprehension and censure.\r\n\r\nHaving dwelt long on this convention, and other occurrences of that day,\r\nin the hope, probably, (which will not be gratified,) that I should\r\nleave the course of this debate to follow him at length in those\r\nexcursions, the honorable member returned, and attempted another object.\r\nHe referred to a speech of mine in the other house, the same which I had\r\noccasion to allude to myself, the other day; and has quoted a passage or\r\ntwo from it, with a bold, though uneasy and laboring, air of confidence,\r\nas if he had detected in me an inconsistency. Judging from the\r\ngentleman's manner, a stranger to the course of the debate and to the\r\npoint in discussion would have imagined, from so triumphant a tone, that\r\nthe honorable member was about to overwhelm me with a manifest\r\ncontradiction. Any one who heard him, and who had not heard what I had,\r\nin fact, previously said, must have thought me routed and discomfited,\r\nas the gentleman had promised. Sir, a breath blows all this triumph\r\naway. There is not the slightest difference in the purport of my remarks\r\non the two occasions. What I said here on Wednesday is in exact\r\naccordance with the opinion expressed by me in the other house in 1825.\r\nThough the gentleman had the metaphysics of Hudibras, though he were\r\nable\r\n\r\n                     \"to sever and divide\r\n    A hair 'twixt north and northwest side,\"\r\n\r\nhe yet could not insert his metaphysical scissors between the fair\r\nreading of my remarks in 1825, and what I said here last week. There is\r\nnot only no contradiction, no difference, but, in truth, too exact a\r\nsimilarity, both in thought and language, to be entirely in just taste.\r\nI had myself quoted the same speech; had recurred to it, and spoke with\r\nit open before me; and much of what I said was little more than a\r\nrepetition from it. In order to make finishing work with this alleged\r\ncontradiction, permit me to recur to the origin of this debate, and\r\nreview its course. This seems expedient, and may be done as well now as\r\nat any time.\r\n\r\nWell, then, its history is this. The honorable member from Connecticut\r\nmoved a resolution, which constitutes the first branch of that which is\r\nnow before us; that is to say, a resolution, instructing the committee\r\non public lands to inquire into the expediency of limiting, for a\r\ncertain period, the sales of the public lands, to such as have\r\nheretofore been offered for sale; and whether sundry offices connected\r\nwith the sales of the lands might not be abolished without detriment to\r\nthe public service. In the progress of the discussion which arose on\r\nthis resolution, an honorable member from New Hampshire moved to amend\r\nthe resolution, so as entirely to reverse its object; that is, to strike\r\nit all out, and insert a direction to the committee to inquire into the\r\nexpediency of adopting measures to hasten the sales, and expend more\r\nrapidly the surveys, of the lands.\r\n\r\nThe honorable member from Maine[1] suggested that both those\r\npropositions might well enough go for consideration to the committee;\r\nand in this state of the question, the member from South Carolina\r\naddressed the Senate in his first speech. He rose, he said, to give us\r\nhis own free thoughts on the public lands. I saw him rise with pleasure,\r\nand listened with expectation, though before he concluded I was filled\r\nwith surprise. Certainly, I was never more surprised, than to find him\r\nfollowing up, to the extent he did, the sentiments and opinions which\r\nthe gentleman from Missouri had put forth, and which it is known he has\r\nlong entertained.\r\n\r\nI need not repeat at large the general topics of the honorable\r\ngentleman's speech. When he said yesterday that he did not attack the\r\nEastern States, he certainly must have forgotten, not only particular\r\nremarks, but the whole drift and tenor of his speech; unless he means by\r\nnot attacking, that he did not commence hostilities, but that another\r\nhad preceded him in the attack. He, in the first place, disapproved of\r\nthe whole course of the government, for forty years, in regard to its\r\ndisposition of the public lands; and then, turning northward and\r\neastward, and fancying he had found a cause for alleged narrowness and\r\nniggardliness in the \"accursed policy of the tariff\", to which he\r\nrepresented the people of New England as wedded, he went on for a full\r\nhour with remarks, the whole scope of which was to exhibit the results\r\nof this policy, in feelings and in measures unfavorable to the West. I\r\nthought his opinions unfounded and erroneous, as to the general course\r\nof the government, and ventured to reply to them.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman had remarked on the analogy of other cases, and quoted the\r\nconduct of European governments towards their own subjects settling on\r\nthis continent, as in point, to show that we had been harsh and rigid in\r\nselling, when we should have given the public lands to settlers without\r\nprice. I thought the honorable member had suffered his judgment to be\r\nbetrayed by a false analogy; that he was struck with an appearance of\r\nresemblance where there was no real similitude. I think so still. The\r\nfirst settlers of North America were enterprising spirits, engaged in\r\nprivate adventure, or fleeing from tyranny at home. When arrived here,\r\nthey were forgotten by the mother country, or remembered only to be\r\noppressed. Carried away again by the appearance of analogy, or struck\r\nwith the eloquence of the passage, the honorable member yesterday\r\nobserved, that the conduct of government towards the Western emigrants,\r\nor my representation of it, brought to his mind a celebrated speech in\r\nthe British Parliament. It was, Sir, the speech of Colonel Barre. On the\r\nquestion of the stamp act, or tea tax, I forget which, Colonel Barre had\r\nheard a member on the treasury bench argue, that the people of the\r\nUnited States, being British colonists, planted by the maternal care,\r\nnourished by the indulgence, and protected by the arms of England, would\r\nnot grudge their mite to relieve the mother country from the heavy\r\nburden under which she groaned. The language of Colonel Barre, in reply\r\nto this, was: \"They planted by your care? Your oppression planted them\r\nin America. They fled from your tyranny, and grew by your neglect of\r\nthem. So soon as you began to care for them, you showed your care by\r\nsending persons to spy out their liberties, misrepresent their\r\ncharacter, prey upon them, and eat out their substance.\"\r\n\r\nAnd how does the honorable gentleman mean to maintain, that language\r\nlike this is applicable to the conduct of the government of the United\r\nStates towards the Western emigrants, or to any representation given by\r\nme of that conduct? Were the settlers in the West driven thither by our\r\noppression? Have they flourished only by our neglect of them? Has the\r\ngovernment done nothing but prey upon them, and eat out their substance?\r\nSir, this fervid eloquence of the British speaker, just when and where\r\nit was uttered, and fit to remain an exercise for the schools, is not a\r\nlittle out of place, when it is brought thence to be applied here to the\r\nconduct of our own country towards her own citizens. From America to\r\nEngland, it may be true; from Americans to their own government, it\r\nwould be strange language. Let us leave it, to be recited and declaimed\r\nby our boys against a foreign nation; not introduce it here, to recite\r\nand declaim ourselves against our own.\r\n\r\nBut I come to the point of the alleged contradiction. In my remarks on\r\nWednesday, I contended that we could not give away gratuitously all the\r\npublic lands; that we held them in trust; that the government had\r\nsolemnly pledged itself to dispose of them as a common fund for the\r\ncommon benefit, and to sell and settle them as its discretion should\r\ndictate. Now, Sir, what contradiction does the gentleman find to this\r\nsentiment in the speech of 1825? He quotes me as having then said, that\r\nwe ought not to hug these lands as a very great treasure. Very well,\r\nSir, supposing me to be accurately reported in that expression, what is\r\nthe contradiction? I have not now said, that we should hug these lands\r\nas a favorite source of pecuniary income. No such thing. It is not my\r\nview. What I have said, and what I do say, is, that they are a common\r\nfund, to be disposed of for the common benefit, to be sold at low prices\r\nfor the accommodation of settlers, keeping the object of settling the\r\nlands as much in view as that of raising money from them. This I say\r\nnow, and this I have always said. Is this hugging them as a favorite\r\ntreasure? Is there no difference between hugging and hoarding this fund,\r\non the one hand, as a great treasure, and, on the other, of disposing of\r\nit at low prices, placing the proceeds in the general treasury of the\r\nUnion? My opinion is, that as much is to be made of the land as fairly\r\nand reasonably may be, selling it all the while at such rates as to give\r\nthe fullest effect to settlement. This is not giving it all away to the\r\nStates, as the gentleman would propose; nor is it hugging the fund\r\nclosely and tenaciously, as a favorite treasure; but it is, in my\r\njudgment, a just and wise policy, perfectly according with all the\r\nvarious duties which rest on government. So much for my contradiction.\r\nAnd what is it? Where is the ground of the gentleman's triumph? What\r\ninconsistency in word or doctrine has he been able to detect? Sir, if\r\nthis be a sample of that discomfiture with which the honorable gentleman\r\nthreatened me, commend me to the word _discomfiture_ for the rest of my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, this is not the point of the debate; and I must now\r\nbring the gentleman back to what is the point.\r\n\r\nThe real question between me and him is, Has the doctrine been advanced\r\nat the South or the East, that the population of the West should be\r\nretarded, or at least need not be hastened, on account of its effect to\r\ndrain off the people from the Atlantic States? Is this doctrine, as has\r\nbeen alleged, of Eastern origin? That is the question. Has the gentleman\r\nfound any thing by which he can make good his accusation? I submit to\r\nthe Senate, that he has entirely failed; and, as far as this debate has\r\nshown, the only person who has advanced such sentiments is a gentleman\r\nfrom South Carolina, and a friend of the honorable member himself. The\r\nhonorable gentleman has given no answer to this; there is none which can\r\nbe given. The simple fact, while it requires no comment to enforce it,\r\ndefies all argument to refute it. I could refer to the speeches of\r\nanother Southern gentleman, in years before, of the same general\r\ncharacter, and to the same effect, as that which has been quoted; but I\r\nwill not consume the time of the Senate by the reading of them.\r\n\r\nSo then, Sir, New England is guiltless of the policy of retarding\r\nWestern population, and of all envy and jealousy of the growth of the\r\nnew States. Whatever there be of that policy in the country, no part of\r\nit is hers. If it has a local habitation, the honorable member has\r\nprobably seen by this time where to look for it; and if it now has\r\nreceived a name, he has himself christened it.\r\n\r\nWe approach, at length, Sir, to a more important part of the honorable\r\ngentleman's observations. Since it does not accord with my views of\r\njustice and policy to give away the public lands altogether, as a mere\r\nmatter of gratuity, I am asked by the honorable gentleman on what ground\r\nit is that I consent to vote them away in particular instances. How, he\r\ninquires, do I reconcile with these professed sentiments, my support of\r\nmeasures appropriating portions of the lands to particular roads,\r\nparticular canals, particular rivers, and particular institutions of\r\neducation in the West? This leads, Sir, to the real and wide difference\r\nin political opinion between the honorable gentleman and myself. On my\r\npart, I look upon all these objects as connected with the common good,\r\nfairly embraced in its object and its terms; he, on the contrary, deems\r\nthem all, if good at all, only local good. This is our difference. The\r\ninterrogatory which he proceeded to put at once explains this\r\ndifference. \"What interest,\" asks he, \"has South Carolina in a canal in\r\nOhio?\" Sir, this very question is full of significance. It develops the\r\ngentleman's whole political system; and its answer expounds mine. Here\r\nwe differ. I look upon a road over the Alleghanies, a canal round the\r\nfalls of the Ohio, or a canal or railway from the Atlantic to the\r\nWestern waters, as being an object large and extensive enough to be\r\nfairly said to be for the common benefit. The gentleman thinks\r\notherwise, and this is the key to his construction of the powers of the\r\ngovernment. He may well ask what interest has South Carolina in a canal\r\nin Ohio. On his system, it is true, she has no interest. On that system,\r\nOhio and Carolina are different governments, and different countries;\r\nconnected here, it is true, by some slight and ill-defined bond of\r\nunion, but in all main respects separate and diverse. On that system,\r\nCarolina has no more interest in a canal in Ohio than in Mexico. The\r\ngentleman, therefore, only follows out his own principles; he does no\r\nmore than arrive at the natural conclusions of his own doctrines; he\r\nonly announces the true results of that creed which he has adopted\r\nhimself, and would persuade others to adopt, when he thus declares that\r\nSouth Carolina has no interest in a public work in Ohio.\r\n\r\nSir, we narrow-minded people of New England do not reason thus. Our\r\n_notion_ of things is entirely different. We look upon the States, not\r\nas separated, but as united. We love to dwell on that union, and on the\r\nmutual happiness which it has so much promoted, and the common renown\r\nwhich it has so greatly contributed to acquire. In our contemplation,\r\nCarolina and Ohio are parts of the same country; States, united under\r\nthe same general government, having interests, common, associated,\r\nintermingled. In whatever is within the proper sphere of the\r\nconstitutional power of this government, we look upon the States as one.\r\nWe do not impose geographical limits to our patriotic feeling or regard;\r\nwe do not follow rivers and mountains, and lines of latitude, to find\r\nboundaries, beyond which public improvements do not benefit us. We who\r\ncome here, as agents and representatives of these narrow-minded and\r\nselfish men of New England, consider ourselves as bound to regard with\r\nan equal eye the good of the whole, in whatever is within our powers of\r\nlegislation. Sir, if a railroad or canal, beginning in South Carolina\r\nand ending in South Carolina, appeared to me to be of national\r\nimportance and national magnitude, believing, as I do, that the power of\r\ngovernment extends to the encouragement of works of that description, if\r\nI were to stand up here and ask, What interest has Massachusetts in a\r\nrailroad in South Carolina? I should not be willing to face my\r\nconstituents. These same narrow-minded men would tell me, that they had\r\nsent me to act for the whole country, and that one who possessed too\r\nlittle comprehension, either of intellect or feeling, one who was not\r\nlarge enough, both in mind and in heart, to embrace the whole, was not\r\nfit to be intrusted with the interest of any part.\r\n\r\nSir, I do not desire to enlarge the powers of the government by\r\nunjustifiable construction, nor to exercise any not within a fair\r\ninterpretation. But when it is believed that a power does exist, then it\r\nis, in my judgment, to be exercised for the general benefit of the\r\nwhole. So far as respects the exercise of such a power, the States are\r\none. It was the very object of the Constitution to create unity of\r\ninterests to the extent of the powers of the general government. In war\r\nand peace we are one; in commerce, one; because the authority of the\r\ngeneral government reaches to war and peace, and to the regulation of\r\ncommerce. I have never seen any more difficulty in erecting light-houses\r\non the lakes, than on the ocean; in improving the harbors of inland\r\nseas, than if they were within the ebb and flow of the tide; or in\r\nremoving obstructions in the vast streams of the West, more than in any\r\nwork to facilitate commerce on the Atlantic coast. If there be any power\r\nfor one, there is power also for the other; and they are all and equally\r\nfor the common good of the country.\r\n\r\nThere are other objects, apparently more local, or the benefit of which\r\nis less general, towards which, nevertheless, I have concurred with\r\nothers, to give aid by donations of land. It is proposed to construct a\r\nroad, in or through one of the new States, in which this government\r\npossesses large quantities of land. Have the United States no right, or,\r\nas a great and untaxed proprietor, are they under no obligation to\r\ncontribute to an object thus calculated to promote the common good of\r\nall the proprietors, themselves included? And even with respect to\r\neducation, which is the extreme case, let the question be considered. In\r\nthe first place, as we have seen, it was made matter of compact with\r\nthese States, that they should do their part to promote education. In\r\nthe next place, our whole system of land laws proceeds on the idea that\r\neducation is for the common good; because, in every division, a certain\r\nportion is uniformly reserved and appropriated for the use of schools.\r\nAnd, finally, have not these new States singularly strong claims,\r\nfounded on the ground already stated, that the government is a great\r\nuntaxed proprietor, in the ownership of the soil? It is a consideration\r\nof great importance, that probably there is in no part of the country,\r\nor of the world, so great call for the means of education, as in these\r\nnew States, owing to the vast numbers of persons within those ages in\r\nwhich education and instruction are usually received, if received at\r\nall. This is the natural consequence of recency of settlement and rapid\r\nincrease. The census of these States shows how great a proportion of the\r\nwhole population occupies the classes between infancy and manhood. These\r\nare the wide fields, and here is the deep and quick soil for the seeds\r\nof knowledge and virtue; and this is the favored season, the very\r\nspring-time for sowing them. Let them be disseminated without stint. Let\r\nthem be scattered with a bountiful hand, broadcast. Whatever the\r\ngovernment can fairly do towards these objects, in my opinion, ought to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are the grounds, succinctly stated, on which my votes for\r\ngrants of lands for particular objects rest; while I maintain, at the\r\nsame time, that it is all a common fund, for the common benefit. And\r\nreasons like these, I presume, have influenced the votes of other\r\ngentlemen from New England. Those who have a different view of the\r\npowers of the government, of course, come to different conclusions, on\r\nthese, as on other questions. I observed, when speaking on this subject\r\nbefore, that if we looked to any measure, whether for a road, a canal,\r\nor any thing else, intended for the improvement of the West, it would be\r\nfound that, if the New England _ayes_ were struck out of the lists of\r\nvotes, the Southern _noes_ would always have rejected the measure. The\r\ntruth of this has not been denied, and cannot be denied. In stating\r\nthis, I thought it just to ascribe it to the constitutional scruples of\r\nthe South, rather than to any other less favorable or less charitable\r\ncause. But no sooner had I done this, than the honorable gentleman asks\r\nif I reproach him and his friends with their constitutional scruples.\r\nSir, I reproach nobody. I stated a fact, and gave the most respectful\r\nreason for it that occurred to me. The gentleman cannot deny the fact;\r\nhe may, if he choose, disclaim the reason. It is not long since I had\r\noccasion, in presenting a petition from his own State, to account for\r\nits being intrusted to my hands, by saying, that the constitutional\r\nopinions of the gentleman and his worthy colleague prevented them from\r\nsupporting it. Sir, did I state this as matter of reproach? Far from it.\r\nDid I attempt to find any other cause than an honest one for these\r\nscruples? Sir, I did not. It did not become me to doubt or to insinuate\r\nthat the gentleman had either changed his sentiments, or that he had\r\nmade up a set of constitutional opinions accommodated to any particular\r\ncombination of political occurrences. Had I done so, I should have felt,\r\nthat, while I was entitled to little credit in thus questioning other\r\npeople's motives, I justified the whole world in suspecting my own. But\r\nhow has the gentleman returned this respect for others' opinions? His\r\nown candor and justice, how have they been exhibited towards the motives\r\nof others, while he has been at so much pains to maintain, what nobody\r\nhas disputed, the purity of his own? Why, Sir, he has asked _when_, and\r\n_how_, and _why_ New England votes were found going for measures\r\nfavorable to the West. He has demanded to be informed whether all this\r\ndid not begin in 1825, and while the election of President was still\r\npending.\r\n\r\nSir, to these questions retort would be justified; and it is both cogent\r\nand at hand. Nevertheless, I will answer the inquiry, not by retort, but\r\nby facts. I will tell the gentleman _when_, and _how_, and _why_ New\r\nEngland has supported measures favorable to the West. I have already\r\nreferred to the early history of the government, to the first\r\nacquisition of the lands, to the original laws for disposing of them,\r\nand for governing the territories where they lie; and have shown the\r\ninfluence of New England men and New England principles in all these\r\nleading measures. I should not be pardoned were I to go over that ground\r\nagain. Coming to more recent times, and to measures of a less general\r\ncharacter, I have endeavored to prove that every thing of this kind,\r\ndesigned for Western improvement, has depended on the votes of New\r\nEngland; all this is true beyond the power of contradiction. And now,\r\nSir, there are two measures to which I will refer, not so ancient as to\r\nbelong to the early history of the public lands, and not so recent as to\r\nbe on this side of the period when the gentleman charitably imagines a\r\nnew direction may have been given to New England feeling and New England\r\nvotes. These measures, and the New England votes in support of them, may\r\nbe taken as samples and specimens of all the rest.\r\n\r\nIn 1820 (observe, Mr. President, in 1820) the people of the West\r\nbesought Congress for a reduction in the price of lands. In favor of\r\nthat reduction, New England, with a delegation of forty members in the\r\nother house, gave thirty-three votes, and one only against it. The four\r\nSouthern States, with more than fifty members, gave thirty-two votes for\r\nit, and seven against it. Again, in 1821, (observe again, Sir, the\r\ntime,) the law passed for the relief of the purchasers of the public\r\nlands. This was a measure of vital importance to the West, and more\r\nespecially to the Southwest. It authorized the relinquishment of\r\ncontracts for lands which had been entered into at high prices, and a\r\nreduction in other cases of not less than thirty-seven and a half per\r\ncent on the purchase-money. Many millions of dollars, six or seven, I\r\nbelieve, probably much more, were relinquished by this law. On this\r\nbill, New England, with her forty members, gave more affirmative votes\r\nthan the four Southern States, with their fifty-two or fifty-three\r\nmembers. These two are far the most important general measures\r\nrespecting the public lands which have been adopted within the last\r\ntwenty years. They took place in 1820 and 1821. That is the time _when_.\r\n\r\nAs to the manner _how_, the gentleman already sees that it was by voting\r\nin solid column for the required relief; and, lastly, as to the cause\r\n_why_, I tell the gentleman it was because the members from New England\r\nthought the measures just and salutary; because they entertained towards\r\nthe West neither envy, hatred, nor malice; because they deemed it\r\nbecoming them, as just and enlightened public men, to meet the exigency\r\nwhich had arisen in the West with the appropriate measure of relief;\r\nbecause they felt it due to their own characters, and the characters of\r\ntheir New England predecessors in this government, to act towards the\r\nnew States in the spirit of a liberal, patronizing, magnanimous policy.\r\nSo much, Sir, for the cause _why_; and I hope that by this time, Sir,\r\nthe honorable gentleman is satisfied; if not, I do not know _when_, or\r\n_how_, or _why_ he ever will be.\r\n\r\nHaving recurred to these two important measures, in answer to the\r\ngentleman's inquiries, I must now beg permission to go back to a period\r\nsomewhat earlier, for the purpose of still further showing how much, or\r\nrather how little, reason there is for the gentleman's insinuation that\r\npolitical hopes or fears, or party associations, were the grounds of\r\nthese New England votes. And after what has been said, I hope it may be\r\nforgiven me if I allude to some political opinions and votes of my own,\r\nof very little public importance certainly, but which, from the time at\r\nwhich they were given and expressed, may pass for good witnesses on this\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nThis government, Mr. President, from its origin to the peace of 1815,\r\nhad been too much engrossed with various other important concerns to be\r\nable to turn its thoughts inward, and look to the development of its\r\nvast internal resources. In the early part of President Washington's\r\nadministration, it was fully occupied with completing its own\r\norganization, providing for the public debt, defending the frontiers,\r\nand maintaining domestic peace. Before the termination of that\r\nadministration, the fires of the French Revolution blazed forth, as\r\nfrom a new-opened volcano, and the whole breadth of the ocean did not\r\nsecure us from its effects. The smoke and the cinders reached us, though\r\nnot the burning lava. Difficult and agitating questions, embarrassing to\r\ngovernment and dividing public opinion, sprung out of the new state of\r\nour foreign relations, and were succeeded by others, and yet again by\r\nothers, equally embarrassing and equally exciting division and discord,\r\nthrough the long series of twenty years, till they finally issued in the\r\nwar with England. Down to the close of that war, no distinct, marked,\r\nand deliberate attention had been given, or could have been given, to\r\nthe internal condition of the country, its capacities of improvement, or\r\nthe constitutional power of the government in regard to objects\r\nconnected with such improvement.\r\n\r\nThe peace, Mr. President, brought about an entirely new and a most\r\ninteresting state of things; it opened to us other prospects and\r\nsuggested other duties. We ourselves were changed, and the whole world\r\nwas changed. The pacification of Europe, after June, 1815, assumed a\r\nfirm and permanent aspect. The nations evidently manifested that they\r\nwere disposed for peace. Some agitation of the waves might be expected,\r\neven after the storm had subsided; but the tendency was, strongly and\r\nrapidly, towards settled repose.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, Sir, that I was at that time a member of Congress, and,\r\nlike others, naturally turned my thoughts to the contemplation of the\r\nrecently altered condition of the country and of the world. It appeared\r\nplainly enough to me, as well as to wiser and more experienced men, that\r\nthe policy of the government would naturally take a start in a new\r\ndirection; because new directions would necessarily be given to the\r\npursuits and occupations of the people. We had pushed our commerce far\r\nand fast, under the advantage of a neutral flag. But there were now no\r\nlonger flags, either neutral or belligerent. The harvest of neutrality\r\nhad been great, but we had gathered it all. With the peace of Europe, it\r\nwas obvious there would spring up in her circle of nations a revived and\r\ninvigorated spirit of trade, and a new activity in all the business and\r\nobjects of civilized life. Hereafter, our commercial gains were to be\r\nearned only by success in a close and intense competition. Other nations\r\nwould produce for themselves, and carry for themselves, and manufacture\r\nfor themselves, to the full extent of their abilities. The crops of our\r\nplains would no longer sustain European armies, nor our ships longer\r\nsupply those whom war had rendered unable to supply themselves. It was\r\nobvious, that, under these circumstances, the country would begin to\r\nsurvey itself, and to estimate its own capacity of improvement.\r\n\r\nAnd this improvement,--how was it to be accomplished, and who was to\r\naccomplish it? We were ten or twelve millions of people, spread over\r\nalmost half a world. We were more than twenty States, some stretching\r\nalong the same seaboard, some along the same line of inland frontier,\r\nand others on opposite banks of the same vast rivers. Two considerations\r\nat once presented themselves with great force, in looking at this state\r\nof things. One was, that that great branch of improvement which\r\nconsisted in furnishing new facilities of intercourse necessarily ran\r\ninto different States in every leading instance, and would benefit the\r\ncitizens of all such States. No one State, therefore, in such cases,\r\nwould assume the whole expense, nor was the co-operation of several\r\nStates to be expected. Take the instance of the Delaware breakwater. It\r\nwill cost several millions of money. Would Pennsylvania alone ever have\r\nconstructed it? Certainly never, while this Union lasts, because it is\r\nnot for her sole benefit. Would Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware\r\nhave united to accomplish it at their joint expense? Certainly not, for\r\nthe same reason. It could not be done, therefore, but by the general\r\ngovernment. The same may be said of the large inland undertakings,\r\nexcept that, in them, government, instead of bearing the whole expense,\r\nco-operates with others who bear a part. The other consideration is,\r\nthat the United States have the means. They enjoy the revenues derived\r\nfrom commerce, and the States have no abundant and easy sources of\r\npublic income. The custom-houses fill the general treasury, while the\r\nStates have scanty resources, except by resort to heavy direct taxes.\r\n\r\nUnder this view of things, I thought it necessary to settle, at least\r\nfor myself, some definite notions with respect to the powers of the\r\ngovernment in regard to internal affairs. It may not savor too much of\r\nself-commendation to remark, that, with this object, I considered the\r\nConstitution, its judicial construction, its contemporaneous exposition,\r\nand the whole history of the legislation of Congress under it; and I\r\narrived at the conclusion, that government had power to accomplish\r\nsundry objects, or aid in their accomplishment, which are now commonly\r\nspoken of as INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS. That conclusion, Sir, may have been\r\nright, or it may have been wrong. I am not about to argue the grounds of\r\nit at large. I say only, that it was adopted and acted on even so early\r\nas in 1816. Yes, Mr. President, I made up my opinion, and determined on\r\nmy intended course of political conduct, on these subjects, in the\r\nFourteenth Congress, in 1816. And now, Mr. President, I have further to\r\nsay, that I made up these opinions, and entered on this course of\r\npolitical conduct, _Teucro duce_.[2] Yes, Sir, I pursued in all this a\r\nSouth Carolina track on the doctrines of internal improvement. South\r\nCarolina, as she was then represented in the other house, set forth in\r\n1816 under a fresh and leading breeze, and I was among the followers.\r\nBut if my leader sees new lights and turns a sharp corner, unless I see\r\nnew lights also, I keep straight on in the same path. I repeat, that\r\nleading gentlemen from South Carolina were first and foremost in behalf\r\nof the doctrines of internal improvements, when those doctrines came\r\nfirst to be considered and acted upon in Congress. The debate on the\r\nbank question, on the tariff of 1816, and on the direct tax, will show\r\nwho was who, and what was what, at that time.\r\n\r\nThe tariff of 1816, (one of the plain cases of oppression and\r\nusurpation, from which, if the government does not recede, individual\r\nStates may justly secede from the government,) is, Sir, in truth, a\r\nSouth Carolina tariff, supported by South Carolina votes. But for those\r\nvotes, it could not have passed in the form in which it did pass;\r\nwhereas, if it had depended on Massachusetts votes, it would have been\r\nlost. Does not the honorable gentleman well know all this? There are\r\ncertainly those who do, full well, know it all. I do not say this to\r\nreproach South Carolina. I only state the fact; and I think it will\r\nappear to be true, that among the earliest and boldest advocates of the\r\ntariff, as a measure of protection, and on the express ground of\r\nprotection, were leading gentlemen of South Carolina in Congress. I did\r\nnot then, and cannot now, understand their language in any other sense.\r\nWhile this tariff of 1816 was under discussion in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, an honorable gentleman from Georgia, now of this\r\nhouse,[3] moved to reduce the proposed duty on cotton. He failed, by\r\nfour votes, South Carolina giving three votes (enough to have turned the\r\nscale) against his motion. The act, Sir, then passed, and received on\r\nits passage the support of a majority of the Representatives of South\r\nCarolina present and voting. This act is the first in the order of those\r\nnow denounced as plain usurpations. We see it daily in the list, by the\r\nside of those of 1824 and 1828, as a case of manifest oppression,\r\njustifying disunion. I put it home to the honorable member from South\r\nCarolina, that his own State was not only \"art and part\" in this\r\nmeasure, but the _causa causans_. Without her aid, this seminal\r\nprinciple of mischief, this root of Upas, could not have been planted. I\r\nhave already said, and it is true, that this act proceeded on the ground\r\nof protection. It interfered directly with existing interests of great\r\nvalue and amount. It cut up the Calcutta cotton trade by the roots; but\r\nit passed, nevertheless, and it passed on the principle of protecting\r\nmanufactures, on the principle against free trade, on the principle\r\nopposed to that _which lets us alone_.\r\n\r\nSuch, Mr. President, were the opinions of important and leading\r\ngentlemen from South Carolina, on the subject of internal improvement,\r\nin 1816. I went out of Congress the next year, and, returning again in\r\n1823, thought I found South Carolina where I had left her. I really\r\nsupposed that all things remained as they were, and that the South\r\nCarolina doctrine of internal improvements would be defended by the same\r\neloquent voices, and the same strong arms, as formerly. In the lapse of\r\nthese six years, it is true, political associations had assumed a new\r\naspect and new divisions. A strong party had arisen in the South hostile\r\nto the doctrine of internal improvements. Anti-consolidation was the\r\nflag under which this party fought; and its supporters inveighed against\r\ninternal improvements, much after the manner in which the honorable\r\ngentleman has now inveighed against them, as part and parcel of the\r\nsystem of consolidation. Whether this party arose in South Carolina\r\nitself, or in the neighborhood, is more than I know. I think the latter.\r\nHowever that may have been, there were those found in South Carolina\r\nready to make war upon it, and who did make intrepid war upon it. Names\r\nbeing regarded as things in such controversies, they bestowed on the\r\nanti-improvement gentlemen the appellation of Radicals. Yes, Sir, the\r\nappellation of Radicals, as a term of distinction applicable and applied\r\nto those who denied the liberal doctrines of internal improvement,\r\noriginated, according to the best of my recollection, somewhere between\r\nNorth Carolina and Georgia. Well, Sir, these mischievous Radicals were\r\nto be put down, and the strong arm of South Carolina was stretched out\r\nto put them down. About this time I returned to Congress. The battle\r\nwith the Radicals had been fought, and our South Carolina champions of\r\nthe doctrines of internal improvement had nobly maintained their ground,\r\nand were understood to have achieved a victory. We looked upon them as\r\nconquerors. They had driven back the enemy with discomfiture, a thing,\r\nby the way, Sir, which is not always performed when it is promised. A\r\ngentleman to whom I have already referred in this debate had come into\r\nCongress, during my absence from it, from South Carolina, and had\r\nbrought with him a high reputation for ability. He came from a school\r\nwith which we had been acquainted, _et noscitur a sociis_. I hold in my\r\nhand, Sir, a printed speech of this distinguished gentleman,[4] \"ON\r\nINTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS,\" delivered about the period to which I now refer,\r\nand printed with a few introductory remarks upon _consolidation_; in\r\nwhich, Sir, I think he quite consolidated the arguments of his\r\nopponents, the Radicals, if to _crush_ be to consolidate. I give you a\r\nshort but significant quotation from these remarks. He is speaking of a\r\npamphlet, then recently published, entitled \"Consolidation\"; and, having\r\nalluded to the question of renewing the charter of the former Bank of\r\nthe United States, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Moreover, in the early history of parties, and when Mr. Crawford\r\n     advocated a renewal of the old charter, it was considered a Federal\r\n     measure; which internal improvement _never was_, as this author\r\n     erroneously states. This latter measure originated in the\r\n     administration of Mr. Jefferson, with the appropriation for the\r\n     Cumberland Road; and was first proposed, _as a system_, by Mr.\r\n     Calhoun, and carried through the House of Representatives by a\r\n     large majority of the Republicans, including almost every one of\r\n     the leading men who carried us through the late war.\"\r\n\r\nSo, then, internal improvement is not one of the Federal heresies. One\r\nparagraph more, Sir:--\r\n\r\n     \"The author in question, not content with denouncing as\r\n     Federalists, General Jackson, Mr. Adams, Mr. Calhoun, and the\r\n     majority of the South Carolina delegation in Congress, modestly\r\n     extends the denunciation to Mr. Monroe and the whole Republican\r\n     party. Here are his words: 'During the administration of Mr. Monroe\r\n     much has passed which the Republican party would be glad to approve\r\n     if they could!! But the principal feature, and that which has\r\n     chiefly elicited these observations, is the renewal of the SYSTEM\r\n     OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS.' Now this measure was adopted by a vote\r\n     of 115 to 86 of a Republican Congress, and sanctioned by a\r\n     Republican President. Who, then, is this author, who assumes the\r\n     high prerogative of denouncing, in the name of the Republican\r\n     party, the Republican administration of the country? A denunciation\r\n     including within its sweep _Calhoun, Lowndes, and Cheves_, men who\r\n     will be regarded as the brightest ornaments of South Carolina, and\r\n     the strongest pillars of the Republican party, as long as the late\r\n     war shall be remembered, and talents and patriotism shall be\r\n     regarded as the proper objects of the admiration and gratitude of a\r\n     free people!!\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the opinions, Sir, which were maintained by South Carolina\r\ngentlemen, in the House of Representatives, on the subject of internal\r\nimprovements, when I took my seat there as a member from Massachusetts\r\nin 1823. But this is not all. We had a bill before us, and passed it in\r\nthat house, entitled, \"An Act to procure the necessary surveys, plans,\r\nand estimates upon the subject of roads and canals.\" It authorized the\r\nPresident to cause surveys and estimates to be made of the routes of\r\nsuch roads and canals as he might deem of national importance in a\r\ncommercial or military point of view, or for the transportation of the\r\nmail, and appropriated thirty thousand dollars out of the treasury to\r\ndefray the expense. This act, though preliminary in its nature, covered\r\nthe whole ground. It took for granted the complete power of internal\r\nimprovement, as far as any of its advocates had ever contended for it.\r\nHaving passed the other house, the bill came up to the Senate, and was\r\nhere considered and debated in April, 1824. The honorable member from\r\nSouth Carolina was a member of the Senate at that time. While the bill\r\nwas under consideration here, a motion was made to add the following\r\nproviso: \"_Provided_, That nothing herein contained shall be construed\r\nto affirm _or admit_ a power in Congress, on their own authority, to\r\nmake roads or canals within any of the States of the Union.\" The yeas\r\nand nays were taken on this proviso, and the honorable member voted _in\r\nthe negative_! The proviso failed.\r\n\r\nA motion was then made to add this proviso, viz.: \"_Provided_, That the\r\nfaith of the United States is hereby pledged, that no money shall ever\r\nbe expended for roads or canals, except it shall be among the several\r\nStates, and in the same proportion as direct taxes are laid and assessed\r\nby the provisions of the Constitution.\" The honorable member voted\r\n_against this proviso_ also, and it failed. The bill was then put on its\r\npassage, and the honorable member voted _for it_, and it passed, and\r\nbecame a law.\r\n\r\nNow, it strikes me, Sir, that there is no maintaining these votes, but\r\nupon the power of internal improvement, in its broadest sense. In truth,\r\nthese bills for surveys and estimates have always been considered as\r\ntest questions; they show who is for and who against internal\r\nimprovement. This law itself went the whole length, and assumed the full\r\nand complete power. The gentleman's votes sustained that power, in every\r\nform in which the various propositions to amend presented it. He went\r\nfor the entire and unrestrained authority, without consulting the\r\nStates, and without agreeing to any proportionate distribution. And now\r\nsuffer me to remind you, Mr. President, that it is this very same power,\r\nthus sanctioned, in every form, by the gentleman's own opinion, which is\r\nso plain and manifest a usurpation, that the State of South Carolina is\r\nsupposed to be justified in refusing submission to any laws carrying the\r\npower into effect. Truly, Sir, is not this a little too hard? May we not\r\ncrave some mercy, under favor and protection of the gentleman's own\r\nauthority? Admitting that a road, or a canal, must be written down flat\r\nusurpation as was ever committed, may we find no mitigation in our\r\nrespect for his place, and his vote, as one that knows the law?\r\n\r\nThe tariff, which South Carolina had an efficient hand in establishing,\r\nin 1816, and this asserted power of internal improvement, advanced by\r\nher in the same year, and, as we have seen, approved and sanctioned by\r\nher Representatives in 1824,--these two measures are the great grounds\r\non which she is now thought to be justified in breaking up the Union, if\r\nshe sees fit to break it up!\r\n\r\nI may now safely say, I think, that we have had the authority of leading\r\nand distinguished gentlemen from South Carolina in support of the\r\ndoctrine of internal improvement. I repeat, that, up to 1824, I for one\r\nfollowed South Carolina; but when that star, in its ascension, veered\r\noff in an unexpected direction, I relied on its light no longer.\r\n\r\n     Here the Vice-President said, \"Does the chair understand the\r\n     gentleman from Massachusetts to say that the person now occupying\r\n     the chair of the Senate has changed his opinions on the subject of\r\n     internal improvements?\"\r\n\r\nFrom nothing ever said to me, Sir, have I had reason to know of any\r\nchange in the opinions of the person filling the chair of the Senate. If\r\nsuch change has taken place, I regret it. I speak generally of the State\r\nof South Carolina. Individuals we know there are who hold opinions\r\nfavorable to the power. An application for its exercise, in behalf of a\r\npublic work in South Carolina itself, is now pending, I believe, in the\r\nother house, presented by members from that State.\r\n\r\nI have thus, Sir, perhaps not without some tediousness of detail, shown,\r\nif I am in error on the subject of internal improvement, how, and in\r\nwhat company, I fell into that error. If I am wrong, it is apparent who\r\nmisled me.\r\n\r\nI go to other remarks of the honorable member; and I have to complain of\r\nan entire misapprehension of what I said on the subject of the national\r\ndebt, though I can hardly perceive how any one could misunderstand me.\r\nWhat I said was, not that I wished to put off the payment of the debt,\r\nbut, on the contrary, that I had always voted for every measure for its\r\nreduction, as uniformly as the gentleman himself. He seems to claim the\r\nexclusive merit of a disposition to reduce the public charge. I do not\r\nallow it to him. As a debt, I was, I am for paying it, because it is a\r\ncharge on our finances, and on the industry of the country. But I\r\nobserved, that I thought I perceived a morbid fervor on that subject, an\r\nexcessive anxiety to pay off the debt, not so much because it is a debt\r\nsimply, as because, while it lasts, it furnishes one objection to\r\ndisunion. It is, while it continues, a tie of common interest. I did not\r\nimpute such motives to the honorable member himself, but that there is\r\nsuch a feeling in existence I have not a particle of doubt. The most I\r\nsaid was, that, if one effect of the debt was to strengthen our Union,\r\nthat effect itself was not regretted by me, however much others might\r\nregret it. The gentleman has not seen how to reply to this, otherwise\r\nthan by supposing me to have advanced the doctrine that a national debt\r\nis a national blessing. Others, I must hope, will find much less\r\ndifficulty in understanding me. I distinctly and pointedly cautioned the\r\nhonorable member not to understand me as expressing an opinion favorable\r\nto the continuance of the debt. I repeated this caution, and repeated it\r\nmore than once; but it was thrown away.\r\n\r\nOn yet another point, I was still more unaccountably misunderstood. The\r\ngentleman had harangued against \"consolidation.\" I told him, in reply,\r\nthat there was one kind of consolidation to which I was attached, and\r\nthat was the consolidation of our Union; that this was precisely that\r\nconsolidation to which I feared others were not attached, and that such\r\nconsolidation was the very end of the Constitution, the leading object,\r\nas they had informed us themselves, which its framers had kept in view.\r\nI turned to their communication,[5] and read their very words, \"the\r\nconsolidation of the Union,\" and expressed my devotion to this sort of\r\nconsolidation. I said, in terms, that I wished not in the slightest\r\ndegree to augment the powers of this government; that my object was to\r\npreserve, not to enlarge; and that by consolidating the Union I\r\nunderstood no more than the strengthening of the Union, and perpetuating\r\nit. Having been thus explicit, having thus read from the printed book\r\nthe precise words which I adopted, as expressing my own sentiments, it\r\npasses comprehension how any man could understand me as contending for\r\nan extension of the powers of the government, or for consolidation in\r\nthat odious sense in which it means an accumulation, in the federal\r\ngovernment, of the powers properly belonging to the States.\r\n\r\nI repeat, Sir, that, in adopting the sentiment of the framers of the\r\nConstitution, I read their language audibly, and word for word; and I\r\npointed out the distinction, just as fully as I have now done, between\r\nthe consolidation of the Union and that other obnoxious consolidation\r\nwhich I disclaimed. And yet the honorable member misunderstood me. The\r\ngentleman had said that he wished for no fixed revenue,--not a shilling.\r\nIf by a word he could convert the Capitol into gold, he would not do it.\r\nWhy all this fear of revenue? Why, Sir, because, as the gentleman told\r\nus, it tends to consolidation. Now this can mean neither more nor less\r\nthan that a common revenue is a common interest, and that all common\r\ninterests tend to preserve the union of the States. I confess I like\r\nthat tendency; if the gentleman dislikes it, he is right in deprecating\r\na shilling of fixed revenue. So much, Sir, for consolidation.\r\n\r\nAs well as I recollect the course of his remarks, the honorable\r\ngentleman next recurred to the subject of the tariff. He did not doubt\r\nthe word must be of unpleasant sound to me, and proceeded, with an\r\neffort neither new nor attended with new success, to involve me and my\r\nvotes in inconsistency and contradiction. I am happy the honorable\r\ngentleman has furnished me an opportunity of a timely remark or two on\r\nthat subject. I was glad he approached it, for it is a question I enter\r\nupon without fear from anybody. The strenuous toil of the gentleman has\r\nbeen to raise an inconsistency between my dissent to the tariff in 1824,\r\nand my vote in 1828. It is labor lost. He pays undeserved compliment to\r\nmy speech in 1824; but this is to raise me high, that my fall, as he\r\nwould have it, in 1828, may be more signal. Sir, there was no fall.\r\nBetween the ground I stood on in 1824 and that I took in 1828, there was\r\nnot only no precipice, but no declivity. It was a change of position to\r\nmeet new circumstances, but on the same level. A plain tale explains the\r\nwhole matter. In 1816 I had not acquiesced in the tariff, then supported\r\nby South Carolina. To some parts of it, especially, I felt and expressed\r\ngreat repugnance. I held the same opinions in 1820, at the meeting in\r\nFaneuil Hall, to which the gentleman has alluded. I said then, and say\r\nnow, that, as an original question, the authority of Congress to\r\nexercise the revenue power, with direct reference to the protection of\r\nmanufactures, is a questionable authority, far more questionable, in my\r\njudgment, than the power of internal improvements. I must confess, Sir,\r\nthat in one respect some impression has been made on my opinions lately.\r\nMr. Madison's publication has put the power in a very strong light. He\r\nhas placed it, I must acknowledge, upon grounds of construction and\r\nargument which seem impregnable. But even if the power were doubtful, on\r\nthe face of the Constitution itself, it had been assumed and asserted in\r\nthe first revenue law ever passed under that same Constitution and on\r\nthis ground, as a matter settled by contemporaneous practice, I had\r\nrefrained from expressing the opinion that the tariff laws transcended\r\nconstitutional limits, as the gentleman supposes. What I did say at\r\nFaneuil Hall, as far as I now remember, was, that this was originally\r\nmatter of doubtful construction. The gentleman himself, I suppose,\r\nthinks there is no doubt about it, and that the laws are plainly against\r\nthe Constitution. Mr. Madison's letters, already referred to, contain,\r\nin my judgment, by far the most able exposition extant of this part of\r\nthe Constitution. He has satisfied me, so far as the practice of the\r\ngovernment had left it an open question.\r\n\r\nWith a great majority of the Representatives of Massachusetts, I voted\r\nagainst the tariff of 1824. My reasons were then given, and I will not\r\nnow repeat them. But, notwithstanding our dissent, the great States of\r\nNew York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Kentucky went for the bill, in almost\r\nunbroken column, and it passed. Congress and the President sanctioned\r\nit, and it became the law of the land. What, then, were we to do? Our\r\nonly option was, either to fall in with this settled course of public\r\npolicy, and accommodate ourselves to it as well as we could, or to\r\nembrace the South Carolina doctrine, and talk of nullifying the statute\r\nby State interference.\r\n\r\nThis last alternative did not suit our principles, and of course we\r\nadopted the former. In 1827, the subject came again before Congress, on\r\na proposition to afford some relief to the branch of wool and woollens.\r\nWe looked upon the system of protection as being fixed and settled. The\r\nlaw of 1824 remained. It had gone into full operation, and, in regard to\r\nsome objects intended by it, perhaps most of them, had produced all its\r\nexpected effects. No man proposed to repeal it; no man attempted to\r\nrenew the general contest on its principle. But, owing to subsequent and\r\nunforeseen occurrences, the benefit intended by it to wool and woollen\r\nfabrics had not been realized. Events not known here when the law passed\r\nhad taken place, which defeated its object in that particular respect. A\r\nmeasure was accordingly brought forward to meet this precise deficiency,\r\nto remedy this particular defect. It was limited to wool and woollens.\r\nWas ever any thing more reasonable? If the policy of the tariff laws had\r\nbecome established in principle, as the permanent policy of the\r\ngovernment, should they not be revised and amended, and made equal, like\r\nother laws, as exigencies should arise, or justice require? Because we\r\nhad doubted about adopting the system, were we to refuse to cure its\r\nmanifest defects, after it had been adopted, and when no one attempted\r\nits repeal? And this, Sir, is the inconsistency so much bruited. I had\r\nvoted against the tariff of 1824, but it passed; and in 1827 and 1828 I\r\nvoted to amend it, in a point essential to the interest of my\r\nconstituents. Where is the inconsistency? Could I do otherwise? Sir,\r\ndoes political consistency consist in always giving negative votes? Does\r\nit require of a public man to refuse to concur in amending laws, because\r\nthey passed against his consent? Having voted against the tariff\r\noriginally, does consistency demand that I should do all in my power to\r\nmaintain an unequal tariff, burdensome to my own constituents in many\r\nrespects, favorable in none? To consistency of that sort, I lay no\r\nclaim. And there is another sort to which I lay as little, and that is,\r\na kind of consistency by which persons feel themselves as much bound to\r\noppose a proposition after it has become a law of the land as before.\r\n\r\nThe bill of 1827, limited, as I have said, to the single object in which\r\nthe tariff of 1824 had manifestly failed in its effect, passed the House\r\nof Representatives, but was lost here. We had then the act of 1828. I\r\nneed not recur to the history of a measure so recent. Its enemies spiced\r\nit with whatsoever they thought would render it distasteful; its friends\r\ntook it, drugged as it was. Vast amounts of property, many millions, had\r\nbeen invested in manufactures, under the inducements of the act of 1824.\r\nEvents called loudly, as I thought, for further regulation to secure the\r\ndegree of protection intended by that act. I was disposed to vote for\r\nsuch regulation, and desired nothing more; but certainly was not to be\r\nbantered out of my purpose by a threatened augmentation of duty on\r\nmolasses, put into the bill for the avowed purpose of making it\r\nobnoxious. The vote may have been right or wrong, wise or unwise; but\r\nit is little less than absurd to allege against it an inconsistency with\r\nopposition to the former law.\r\n\r\nSir, as to the general subject of the tariff, I have little now to say.\r\nAnother opportunity may be presented. I remarked the other day, that\r\nthis policy did not begin with us in New England; and yet, Sir, New\r\nEngland is charged with vehemence as being favorable, or charged with\r\nequal vehemence as being unfavorable, to the tariff policy, just as best\r\nsuits the time, place, and occasion for making some charge against her.\r\nThe credulity of the public has been put to its extreme capacity of\r\nfalse impression relative to her conduct in this particular. Through all\r\nthe South, during the late contest, it was New England policy and a New\r\nEngland administration that were afflicting the country with a tariff\r\nbeyond all endurance; while on the other side of the Alleghanies even\r\nthe act of 1828 itself, the very sublimated essence of oppression,\r\naccording to Southern opinions, was pronounced to be one of those\r\nblessings for which the West was indebted to the \"generous South.\"\r\n\r\nWith large investments in manufacturing establishments, and many and\r\nvarious interests connected with and dependent on them, it is not to be\r\nexpected that New England, any more than other portions of the country,\r\nwill now consent to any measure destructive or highly dangerous. The\r\nduty of the government, at the present moment, would seem to be to\r\npreserve, not to destroy; to maintain the position which it has assumed;\r\nand, for one, I shall feel it an indispensable obligation to hold it\r\nsteady, as far as in my power, to that degree of protection which it has\r\nundertaken to bestow. No more of the tariff.\r\n\r\nProfessing to be provoked by what he chose to consider a charge made by\r\nme against South Carolina, the honorable member, Mr. President, has\r\ntaken up a new crusade against New England. Leaving altogether the\r\nsubject of the public lands, in which his success, perhaps, had been\r\nneither distinguished nor satisfactory, and letting go, also, of the\r\ntopic of the tariff, he sallied forth in a general assault on the\r\nopinions, politics, and parties of New England, as they have been\r\nexhibited in the last thirty years. This is natural. The \"narrow policy\"\r\nof the public lands had proved a legal settlement in South Carolina, and\r\nwas not to be removed. The \"accursed policy\" of the tariff, also, had\r\nestablished the fact of its birth and parentage in the same State. No\r\nwonder, therefore, the gentleman wished to carry the war, as he\r\nexpressed it, into the enemy's country. Prudently willing to quit these\r\nsubjects, he was, doubtless, desirous of fastening on others, which\r\ncould not be transferred south of Mason and Dixon's line. The politics\r\nof New England became his theme; and it was in this part of his speech,\r\nI think, that he menaced me with such sore discomfiture. Discomfiture!\r\nWhy, Sir, when he attacks any thing which I maintain, and overthrows it,\r\nwhen he turns the right or left of any position which I take up, when he\r\ndrives me from any ground I choose to occupy, he may then talk of\r\ndiscomfiture, but not till that distant day. What has he done? Has he\r\nmaintained his own charges? Has he proved what he alleged? Has he\r\nsustained himself in his attack on the government, and on the history of\r\nthe North, in the matter of the public lands? Has he disproved a fact,\r\nrefuted a proposition, weakened an argument, maintained by me? Has he\r\ncome within beat of drum of any position of mine? O, no; but he has\r\n\"carried the war into the enemy's country\"! Carried the war into the\r\nenemy's country! Yes, Sir, and what sort of a war has he made of it?\r\nWhy, Sir, he has stretched a drag-net over the whole surface of perished\r\npamphlets, indiscreet sermons, frothy paragraphs, and fuming popular\r\naddresses,--over whatever the pulpit in its moments of alarm, the press\r\nin its heats, and parties in their extravagance, have severally thrown\r\noff in times of general excitement and violence. He has thus swept\r\ntogether a mass of such things as, but that they are now old and cold,\r\nthe public health would have required him rather to leave in their\r\nstate of dispersion. For a good long hour or two, we had the unbroken\r\npleasure of listening to the honorable member, while he recited with his\r\nusual grace and spirit, and with evident high gusto, speeches,\r\npamphlets, addresses, and all the _et caeteras_ of the political press,\r\nsuch as warm heads produce in warm times; and such as it would be\r\n\"discomfiture\" indeed for any one, whose taste did not delight in that\r\nsort of reading, to be obliged to peruse. This is his war. This it is to\r\ncarry war into the enemy's country. It is in an invasion of this sort,\r\nthat he flatters himself with the expectation of gaining laurels fit to\r\nadorn a Senator's brow!\r\n\r\nMr. President, I shall not, it will not, I trust, be expected that I\r\nshould, either now or at any time, separate this farrago into parts, and\r\nanswer and examine its components. I shall barely bestow upon it all a\r\ngeneral remark or two. In the run of forty years, Sir, under this\r\nConstitution, we have experienced sundry successive violent party\r\ncontests. Party arose, indeed, with the Constitution itself, and, in\r\nsome form or other, has attended it through the greater part of its\r\nhistory. Whether any other constitution than the old Articles of\r\nConfederation was desirable, was itself a question on which parties\r\ndivided; if a new constitution were framed, what powers should be given\r\nto it was another question; and when it had been formed, what was, in\r\nfact, the just extent of the powers actually conferred was a third.\r\nParties, as we know, existed under the first administration, as\r\ndistinctly marked as those which have manifested themselves at any\r\nsubsequent period. The contest immediately preceding the political\r\nchange in 1801, and that, again, which existed at the commencement of\r\nthe late war, are other instances of party excitement, of something more\r\nthan usual strength and intensity. In all these conflicts there was, no\r\ndoubt, much of violence on both and all sides. It would be impossible,\r\nif one had a fancy for such employment, to adjust the relative _quantum_\r\nof violence between these contending parties. There was enough in each,\r\nas must always be expected in popular governments. With a great deal of\r\npopular and decorous discussion, there was mingled a great deal, also,\r\nof declamation, virulence, crimination, and abuse. In regard to any\r\nparty, probably, at one of the leading epochs in the history of parties,\r\nenough may be found to make out another inflamed exhibition, not unlike\r\nthat with which the honorable member has edified us. For myself, Sir, I\r\nshall not rake among the rubbish of bygone times, to see what I can\r\nfind, or whether I cannot find something by which I can fix a blot on\r\nthe escutcheon of any State, any party, or any part of the country.\r\nGeneral Washington's administration was steadily and zealously\r\nmaintained, as we all know, by New England. It was violently opposed\r\nelsewhere. We know in what quarter he had the most earnest, constant,\r\nand persevering support, in all his great and leading measures. We know\r\nwhere his private and personal character was held in the highest degree\r\nof attachment and veneration; and we know, too, where his measures were\r\nopposed, his services slighted, and his character vilified. We know, or\r\nwe might know, if we turned to the journals, who expressed respect,\r\ngratitude, and regret, when he retired from the chief magistracy, and\r\nwho refused to express either respect, gratitude, or regret. I shall not\r\nopen those journals. Publications more abusive or scurrilous never saw\r\nthe light, than were sent forth against Washington, and all his leading\r\nmeasures, from presses south of New England. But I shall not look them\r\nup. I employ no scavengers, no one is in attendance on me, furnishing\r\nsuch means of retaliation; and if there were, with an ass's load of\r\nthem, with a bulk as huge as that which the gentleman himself has\r\nproduced, I would not touch one of them. I see enough of the violence of\r\nour own times, to be no way anxious to rescue from forgetfulness the\r\nextravagances of times past.\r\n\r\nBesides, what is all this to the present purpose? It has nothing to do\r\nwith the public lands, in regard to which the attack was begun; and it\r\nhas nothing to do with those sentiments and opinions which, I have\r\nthought, tend to disunion and all of which the honorable member seems to\r\nhave adopted himself, and undertaken to defend. New England has, at\r\ntimes, so argues the gentleman, held opinions as dangerous as those\r\nwhich he now holds. Suppose this were so; why should _he_ therefore\r\nabuse New England? If he finds himself countenanced by acts of hers, how\r\nis it that, while he relies on these acts, he covers, or seeks to cover,\r\ntheir authors with reproach? But, Sir, if, in the course of forty years,\r\nthere have been undue effervescences of party in New England, has the\r\nsame thing happened nowhere else? Party animosity and party outrage, not\r\nin New England, but elsewhere, denounced President Washington, not only\r\nas a Federalist, but as a Tory, a British agent, a man who, in his high\r\noffice, sanctioned corruption. But does the honorable member suppose, if\r\nI had a tender here who should put such an effusion of wickedness and\r\nfolly into my hand, that I would stand up and read it against the South?\r\nParties ran into great heats again in 1799 and 1800. What was said, Sir,\r\nor rather what was not said, in those years, against John Adams, one of\r\nthe committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence, and its\r\nadmitted ablest defender on the floor of Congress? If the gentleman\r\nwishes to increase his stores of party abuse and frothy violence, if he\r\nhas a determined proclivity to such pursuits, there are treasures of\r\nthat sort south of the Potomac, much to his taste, yet untouched. I\r\nshall not touch them.\r\n\r\nThe parties which divided the country at the commencement of the late\r\nwar were violent. But then there was violence on both sides, and\r\nviolence in every State. Minorities and majorities were equally violent.\r\nThere was no more violence against the war in New England, than in other\r\nStates; nor any more appearance of violence, except that, owing to a\r\ndense population, greater facility of assembling, and more presses,\r\nthere may have been more in quantity spoken and printed there than in\r\nsome other places. In the article of sermons, too, New England is\r\nsomewhat more abundant than South Carolina; and for that reason the\r\nchance of finding here and there an exceptionable one may be greater. I\r\nhope, too, there are more good ones. Opposition may have been more\r\nformidable in New England, as it embraced a larger portion of the whole\r\npopulation; but it was no more unrestrained in principle, or violent in\r\nmanner. The minorities dealt quite as harshly with their own State\r\ngovernments as the majorities dealt with the administration here. There\r\nwere presses on both sides, popular meetings on both sides, ay, and\r\npulpits on both sides also. The gentleman's purveyors have only catered\r\nfor him among the productions of one side. I certainly shall not supply\r\nthe deficiency by furnishing samples of the other. I leave to him, and\r\nto them, the whole concern.\r\n\r\nIt is enough for me to say, that if, in any part of this their grateful\r\noccupation, if, in all their researches, they find any thing in the\r\nhistory of Massachusetts, or New England, or in the proceedings of any\r\nlegislative or other public body, disloyal to the Union, speaking\r\nslightingly of its value, proposing to break it up, or recommending\r\nnon-intercourse with neighboring States, on account of difference of\r\npolitical opinion, then, Sir, I give them all up to the honorable\r\ngentleman's unrestrained rebuke; expecting, however, that he will extend\r\nhis buffetings in like manner _to all similar proceedings, wherever else\r\nfound_.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, Sir, has spoken at large of former parties, now no longer\r\nin being, by their received appellations, and has undertaken to instruct\r\nus, not only in the knowledge of their principles, but of their\r\nrespective pedigrees also. He has ascended to their origin, and run out\r\ntheir genealogies. With most exemplary modesty, he speaks of the party\r\nto which he professes to have himself belonged, as the true Pure, the\r\nonly honest, patriotic party, derived by regular descent, from father to\r\nson, from the time of the virtuous Romans! Spreading before us the\r\n_family tree_ of political parties, he takes especial care to show\r\nhimself snugly perched on a popular bough! He is wakeful to the\r\nexpediency of adopting such rules of descent as shall bring him in, to\r\nthe exclusion of others, as an heir to the inheritance of all public\r\nvirtue, and all true political principle. His party and his opinions are\r\nsure to be orthodox; heterodoxy is confined to his opponents. He spoke,\r\nSir, of the Federalists, and I thought I saw some eyes begin to open and\r\nstare a little, when he ventured on that ground. I expected he would\r\ndraw his sketches rather lightly, when he looked on the circle round\r\nhim, and especially if he should cast his thoughts to the high places\r\nout of the Senate. Nevertheless, he went back to Rome, _ad annum urbis\r\nconditae_, and found the fathers of the Federalists in the primeval\r\naristocrats of that renowned city! He traced the flow of Federal blood\r\ndown through successive ages and centuries, till he brought it into the\r\nveins of the American Tories, of whom, by the way, there were twenty in\r\nthe Carolinas for one in Massachusetts. From the Tories he followed it\r\nto the Federalists; and, as the Federal party was broken up, and there\r\nwas no possibility of transmitting it further on this side the Atlantic,\r\nhe seems to have discovered that it has gone off collaterally, though\r\nagainst all the canons of descent, into the Ultras of France, and\r\nfinally become extinguished, like exploded gas, among the adherents of\r\nDon Miguel! This, Sir, is an abstract of the gentleman's history of\r\nFederalism. I am not about to controvert it. It is not, at present,\r\nworth the pains of refutation; because, Sir, if at this day any one\r\nfeels the sin of Federalism lying heavily on his conscience, he can\r\neasily procure remission. He may even obtain an indulgence, if he be\r\ndesirous of repeating the same transgression. It is an affair of no\r\ndifficulty to get into this same right line of patriotic descent. A man\r\nnow-a-days is at liberty to choose his political parentage. He may elect\r\nhis own father. Federalist or not, he may, if he choose, claim to belong\r\nto the favored stock, and his claim will be allowed. He may carry back\r\nhis pretensions just as far as the honorable gentleman himself; nay, he\r\nmay make himself out the honorable gentleman's cousin, and prove,\r\nsatisfactorily, that he is descended from the same political\r\ngreat-grandfather. All this is allowable. We all know a process, Sir, by\r\nwhich the whole Essex Junto could, in one hour, be all washed white from\r\ntheir ancient Federalism, and come out, every one of them, original\r\nDemocrats, dyed in the wool! Some of them have actually undergone the\r\noperation, and they say it is quite easy. The only inconvenience it\r\noccasions, as they tell us, is a slight tendency of the blood to the\r\nface, a soft suffusion, which, however, is very transient, since nothing\r\nis said by those whom they join calculated to deepen the red on the\r\ncheek, but a prudent silence is observed in regard to all the past.\r\nIndeed, Sir, some smiles of approbation have been bestowed, and some\r\ncrumbs of comfort have fallen, not a thousand miles from the door of the\r\nHartford Convention itself. And if the author of the Ordinance of 1787\r\npossessed the other requisite qualifications, there is no knowing,\r\nnotwithstanding his Federalism, to what heights of favor he might not\r\nyet attain.\r\n\r\nMr. President, in carrying his warfare, such as it is, into New England,\r\nthe honorable gentleman all along professes to be acting on the\r\ndefensive. He chooses to consider me as having assailed South Carolina,\r\nand insists that he comes forth only as her champion, and in her\r\ndefence. Sir, I do not admit that I made any attack whatever on South\r\nCarolina. Nothing like it. The honorable member, in his first speech,\r\nexpressed opinions, in regard to revenue and some other topics, which I\r\nheard both with pain and with surprise. I told the gentleman I was aware\r\nthat such sentiments were entertained _out_ of the government, but had\r\nnot expected to find them advanced in it; that I knew there were persons\r\nin the South who speak of our Union with indifference or doubt, taking\r\npains to magnify its evils, and to say nothing of its benefits; that\r\nthe honorable member himself, I was sure, could never be one of these;\r\nand I regretted the expression of such opinions as he had avowed,\r\nbecause I thought their obvious tendency was to encourage feelings of\r\ndisrespect to the Union, and to impair its strength. This, Sir, is the\r\nsum and substance of all I said on the subject. And this constitutes the\r\nattack which called on the chivalry of the gentleman, in his own\r\nopinion, to harry us with such a foray among the party pamphlets and\r\nparty proceedings of Massachusetts! If he means that I spoke with\r\ndissatisfaction or disrespect of the ebullitions of individuals in South\r\nCarolina, it is true. But if he means that I assailed the character of\r\nthe State, her honor, or patriotism, that I reflected on her history or\r\nher conduct, he has not the slightest ground for any such assumption. I\r\ndid not even refer, I think, in my observations, to any collection of\r\nindividuals. I said nothing of the recent conventions. I spoke in the\r\nmost guarded and careful manner, and only expressed my regret for the\r\npublication of opinions, which I presumed the honorable member\r\ndisapproved as much as myself. In this, it seems, I was mistaken. I do\r\nnot remember that the gentleman has disclaimed any sentiment, or any\r\nopinion, of a supposed anti-union tendency, which on all or any of the\r\nrecent occasions has been expressed. The whole drift of his speech has\r\nbeen rather to prove, that, in divers times and manners, sentiments\r\nequally liable to my objection have been avowed in New England. And one\r\nwould suppose that his object, in this reference to Massachusetts, was\r\nto find a precedent to justify proceedings in the South, were it not for\r\nthe reproach and contumely with which he labors, all along, to load\r\nthese his own chosen precedents. By way of defending South Carolina from\r\nwhat he chooses to think an attack on her, he first quotes the example\r\nof Massachusetts, and then denounces that example in good set terms.\r\nThis twofold purpose, not very consistent, one would think, with itself,\r\nwas exhibited more than once in the course of his speech. He referred,\r\nfor instance, to the Hartford Convention. Did he do this for authority,\r\nor for a topic of reproach? Apparently for both, for he told us that he\r\nshould find no fault with the mere fact of holding such a convention,\r\nand considering and discussing such questions as he supposes were then\r\nand there discussed; but what rendered it obnoxious was its being held\r\nat the time, and under the circumstances of the country then existing.\r\nWe were in a war, he said, and the country needed all our aid: the hand\r\nof government required to be strengthened, not weakened; and patriotism\r\nshould have postponed such proceedings to another day. The thing itself,\r\nthen, is a precedent; the time and manner of it only, a subject of\r\ncensure.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I go much further, on this point, than the honorable member.\r\nSupposing, as the gentleman seems to do, that the Hartford Convention\r\nassembled for any such purpose as breaking up the Union, because they\r\nthought unconstitutional laws had been passed, or to consult on that\r\nsubject, or _to calculate the value of the Union_; supposing this to be\r\ntheir purpose, or any part of it, then I say the meeting itself was\r\ndisloyal, and was obnoxious to censure, whether held in time of peace or\r\ntime of war, or under whatever circumstances. The material question is\r\nthe _object_. Is dissolution the _object_? If it be, external\r\ncircumstances may make it a more or less aggravated case, but cannot\r\naffect the principle. I do not hold, therefore, Sir, that the Hartford\r\nConvention was pardonable, even to the extent of the gentleman's\r\nadmission, if its objects were really such as have been imputed to it.\r\nSir, there never was a time, under any degree of excitement, in which\r\nthe Hartford Convention, or any other convention, could have maintained\r\nitself one moment in New England, if assembled for any such purpose as\r\nthe gentleman says would have been an allowable purpose. To hold\r\nconventions to decide constitutional law! To try the binding validity of\r\nstatutes by votes in a convention! Sir, the Hartford Convention, I\r\npresume, would not desire that the honorable gentleman should be their\r\ndefender or advocate, if he puts their case upon such untenable and\r\nextravagant grounds.\r\n\r\nThen, Sir, the gentleman has no fault to find with these recently\r\npromulgated South Carolina opinions. And certainly he need have none;\r\nfor his own sentiments, as now advanced, and advanced on reflection, as\r\nfar as I have been able to comprehend them, go the full length of all\r\nthese opinions. I propose, Sir, to say something on these, and to\r\nconsider how far they are just and constitutional. Before doing that,\r\nhowever, let me observe that the eulogium pronounced by the honorable\r\ngentleman on the character of the State of South Carolina, for her\r\nRevolutionary and other merits, meets my hearty concurrence. I shall not\r\nacknowledge that the honorable member goes before me in regard for\r\nwhatever of distinguished talent, or distinguished character, South\r\nCarolina has produced. I claim part of the honor, I partake in the\r\npride, of her great names. I claim them for countrymen, one and all, the\r\nLaurenses, the Rutledges, the Pinckneys, the Sumpters, the Marions,\r\nAmericans all, whose fame is no more to be hemmed in by State lines,\r\nthan their talents and patriotism were capable of being circumscribed\r\nwithin the same narrow limits. In their day and generation, they served\r\nand honored the country, and the whole country; and their renown is of\r\nthe treasures of the whole country. Him whose honored name the gentleman\r\nhimself bears,--does he esteem me less capable of gratitude for his\r\npatriotism, or sympathy for his sufferings, than if his eyes had first\r\nopened upon the light of Massachusetts, instead of South Carolina? Sir,\r\ndoes he suppose it in his power to exhibit a Carolina name so bright as\r\nto produce envy in my bosom? No, Sir, increased gratification and\r\ndelight, rather. I thank God, that, if I am gifted with little of the\r\nspirit which is able to raise mortals to the skies, I have yet none, as\r\nI trust, of that other spirit, which would drag angels down. When I\r\nshall be found, Sir, in my place here in the Senate, or elsewhere, to\r\nsneer at public merit, because it happens to spring up beyond the little\r\nlimits of my own State or neighborhood; when I refuse, for any such\r\ncause or for any cause, the homage due to American talent, to elevated\r\npatriotism, to sincere devotion to liberty and the country; or, if I see\r\nan uncommon endowment of Heaven, if I see extraordinary capacity and\r\nvirtue, in any son of the South, and if, moved by local prejudice or\r\ngangrened by State jealousy, I get up here to abate the tithe of a hair\r\nfrom his just character and just fame, may my tongue cleave to the roof\r\nof my mouth!\r\n\r\nSir, let me recur to pleasing recollections; let me indulge in\r\nrefreshing remembrance of the past; let me remind you that, in early\r\ntimes, no States cherished greater harmony, both of principle and\r\nfeeling, than Massachusetts and South Carolina. Would to God that\r\nharmony might again return. Shoulder to shoulder they went through the\r\nRevolution, hand in hand they stood round the administration of\r\nWashington, and felt his own great arm lean on them for support. Unkind\r\nfeeling, if it exist, alienation, and distrust are the growth, unnatural\r\nto such soils, of false principles since sown. They are weeds, the seeds\r\nof which that same great arm never scattered.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I shall enter on no encomium upon Massachusetts; she\r\nneeds none. There she is. Behold her, and judge for yourselves. There is\r\nher history; the world knows it by heart. The past, at least, is secure.\r\nThere is Boston, and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill; and there\r\nthey will remain for ever. The bones of her sons, falling in the great\r\nstruggle for Independence, now lie mingled with the soil of every State\r\nfrom New England to Georgia; and there they will lie for ever. And, Sir,\r\nwhere American Liberty raised its first voice, and where its youth was\r\nnurtured and sustained, there it still lives, in the strength of its\r\nmanhood and full of its original spirit. If discord and disunion shall\r\nwound it, if party strife and blind ambition shall hawk at and tear it,\r\nif folly and madness, if uneasiness under salutary and necessary\r\nrestraint, shall succeed in separating it from that Union, by which\r\nalone its existence is made sure, it will stand, in the end, by the side\r\nof that cradle in which its infancy was rocked; it will stretch forth\r\nits arm with whatever of vigor it may still retain over the friends who\r\ngather round it; and it will fall at last, if fall it must, amidst the\r\nproudest monuments of its own glory, and on the very spot of its origin.\r\n\r\nThere yet remains to be performed, Mr. President, by far the most grave\r\nand important duty, which I feel to be devolved on me by this occasion.\r\nIt is to state, and to defend, what I conceive to be the true principles\r\nof the Constitution under which we are here assembled. I might well have\r\ndesired that so weighty a task should have fallen into other and abler\r\nhands. I could have wished that it should have been executed by those\r\nwhose character and experience give weight and influence to their\r\nopinions, such as cannot possibly belong to mine. But, Sir, I have met\r\nthe occasion, not sought it; and I shall proceed to state my own\r\nsentiments, without challenging for them any particular regard, with\r\nstudied plainness, and as much precision as possible.\r\n\r\nI understand the honorable gentleman from South Carolina to maintain,\r\nthat it is a right of the State legislatures to interfere, whenever, in\r\ntheir judgment, this government transcends its constitutional limits,\r\nand to arrest the operation of its laws.\r\n\r\nI understand him to maintain this right, as a right existing _under_ the\r\nConstitution, not as a right to overthrow it on the ground of extreme\r\nnecessity, such as would justify violent revolution.\r\n\r\nI understand him to maintain an authority, on the part of the States,\r\nthus to interfere, for the purpose of correcting the exercise of power\r\nby the general government, of checking it, and of compelling it to\r\nconform to their opinion of the extent of its powers.\r\n\r\nI understand him to maintain, that the ultimate power of judging of the\r\nconstitutional extent of its own authority is not lodged exclusively in\r\nthe general government, or any branch of it; but that, on the contrary,\r\nthe States may lawfully decide for themselves, and each State for\r\nitself, whether, in a given case, the act of the general government\r\ntranscends its power.\r\n\r\nI understand him to insist, that, if the exigency of the case, in the\r\nopinion of any State government, require it, such State government may,\r\nby its own sovereign authority, annul an act of the general government\r\nwhich it deems plainly and palpably unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThis is the sum of what I understand from him to be the South Carolina\r\ndoctrine, and the doctrine which he maintains. I propose to consider it,\r\nand compare it with the Constitution. Allow me to say, as a preliminary\r\nremark, that I call this the South Carolina doctrine only because the\r\ngentleman himself has so denominated it. I do not feel at liberty to say\r\nthat South Carolina, as a State, has ever advanced these sentiments. I\r\nhope she has not, and never may. That a great majority of her people are\r\nopposed to the tariff laws, is doubtless true. That a majority, somewhat\r\nless than that just mentioned, conscientiously believe these laws\r\nunconstitutional, may probably also be true. But that any majority holds\r\nto the right of direct State interference at State discretion, the right\r\nof nullifying acts of Congress by acts of State legislation, is more\r\nthan I know, and what I shall be slow to believe.\r\n\r\nThat there are individuals besides the honorable gentleman who do\r\nmaintain these opinions, is quite certain. I recollect the recent\r\nexpression of a sentiment, which circumstances attending its utterance\r\nand publication justify us in supposing was not unpremeditated. \"The\r\nsovereignty of the State,--never to be controlled, construed, or decided\r\non, but by her own feelings of honorable justice.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Hayne here rose and said, that, for the purpose of being\r\n     clearly understood he would state that his proposition was in the\r\n     words of the Virginia resolution, as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"That this assembly doth explicitly and peremptorily declare, that\r\n     it views the powers of the federal government as resulting from the\r\n     compact to which the States are parties, as limited by the plain\r\n     sense and intention of the instrument constituting that compact, as\r\n     no farther valid than they are authorized by the grants enumerated\r\n     in that compact; and that, in case of a deliberate, palpable, and\r\n     dangerous exercise of other powers not granted by the said compact,\r\n     the States who are parties thereto have the right, and are in duty\r\n     bound, to interpose, for arresting the progress of the evil, and\r\n     for maintaining within their respective limits the authorities,\r\n     rights, and liberties appertaining to them.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Webster\r\nresumed:--#/\r\n\r\nI am quite aware, Mr. President, of the existence of the resolution\r\nwhich the gentleman read, and has now repeated, and that he relies on it\r\nas his authority. I know the source, too, from which it is understood to\r\nhave proceeded. I need not say that I have much respect for the\r\nconstitutional opinions of Mr. Madison; they would weigh greatly with me\r\nalways. But before the authority of his opinion be vouched for the\r\ngentleman's proposition, it will be proper to consider what is the fair\r\ninterpretation of that resolution, to which Mr. Madison is understood to\r\nhave given his sanction. As the gentleman construes it, it is an\r\nauthority for him. Possibly he may not have adopted the right\r\nconstruction. That resolution declares, that, _in the case of the\r\ndangerous exercise of powers not granted by the general government, the\r\nStates may interpose to arrest the progress of the evil_. But how\r\ninterpose, and what does this declaration purport? Does it mean no more\r\nthan that there may be extreme cases, in which the people, in any mode\r\nof assembling, may resist usurpation, and relieve themselves from a\r\ntyrannical government? No one will deny this. Such resistance is not\r\nonly acknowledged to be just in America, but in England also Blackstone\r\nadmits as much, in the theory, and practice, too, of the English\r\nconstitution. We, Sir, who oppose the Carolina doctrine, do not deny\r\nthat the people may, if they choose, throw off any government when it\r\nbecomes oppressive and intolerable, and erect a better in its stead. We\r\nall know that civil institutions are established for the public benefit,\r\nand that when they cease to answer the ends of their existence they may\r\nbe changed. But I do not understand the doctrine now contended for to be\r\nthat, which, for the sake of distinction, we may call the right of\r\nrevolution. I understand the gentleman to maintain, that, without\r\nrevolution, without civil commotion, without rebellion, a remedy for\r\nsupposed abuse and transgression of the powers of the general government\r\nlies in a direct appeal to the interference of the State governments.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Hayne here rose and said: He did not contend for the mere right\r\n     of revolution, but for the right of constitutional resistance. What\r\n     he maintained was, that in case of a plain, palpable violation of\r\n     the Constitution by the general government, a State may interpose;\r\n     and that this interposition is constitutional.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Webster\r\nresumed:--#/\r\n\r\nSo, Sir, I understood the gentleman, and am happy to find that I did not\r\nmisunderstand him. What he contends for is, that it is constitutional to\r\ninterrupt the administration of the Constitution itself, in the hands of\r\nthose who are chosen and sworn to administer it, by the direct\r\ninterference, in form of law, of the States, in virtue of their\r\nsovereign capacity. The inherent right in the people to reform their\r\ngovernment I do not deny; and they have another right, and that is, to\r\nresist unconstitutional laws, without overturning the government. It is\r\nno doctrine of mine that unconstitutional laws bind the people. The\r\ngreat question is, Whose prerogative is it to decide on the\r\nconstitutionality or unconstitutionality of the laws? On that, the main\r\ndebate hinges. The proposition, that, in case of a supposed violation of\r\nthe Constitution by Congress, the States have a constitutional right to\r\ninterfere and annul the law of Congress, is the proposition of the\r\ngentleman. I do not admit it. If the gentleman had intended no more than\r\nto assert the right of revolution for justifiable cause, he would have\r\nsaid only what all agree to. But I cannot conceive that there can be a\r\nmiddle course, between submission to the laws, when regularly pronounced\r\nconstitutional, on the one hand, and open resistance, which is\r\nrevolution or rebellion, on the other. I say, the right of a State to\r\nannul a law of Congress cannot be maintained, but on the ground of the\r\ninalienable right of man to resist oppression; that is to say, upon the\r\nground of revolution. I admit that there is an ultimate violent remedy,\r\nabove the Constitution and in defiance of the Constitution, which may be\r\nresorted to when a revolution is to be justified. But I do not admit,\r\nthat, under the Constitution and in conformity with it, there is any\r\nmode in which a State government, as a member of the Union, can\r\ninterfere and stop the progress of the general government, by force of\r\nher own laws, under any circumstances whatever.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to inquire into the origin of this government and the\r\nsource of its power. Whose agent is it? Is it the creature of the State\r\nlegislatures, or the creature of the people? If the government of the\r\nUnited States be the agent of the State governments, then they may\r\ncontrol it, provided they can agree in the manner of controlling it; if\r\nit be the agent of the people, then the people alone can control it,\r\nrestrain it, modify, or reform it. It is observable enough, that the\r\ndoctrine for which the honorable gentleman contends leads him to the\r\nnecessity of maintaining, not only that this general government is the\r\ncreature of the States, but that it is the creature of each of the\r\nStates severally, so that each may assert the power for itself of\r\ndetermining whether it acts within the limits of its authority. It is\r\nthe servant of four-and-twenty masters, of different wills and different\r\npurposes, and yet bound to obey all. This absurdity (for it seems no\r\nless) arises from a misconception as to the origin of this government\r\nand its true character. It is, Sir, the people's Constitution, the\r\npeople's government, made for the people, made by the people, and\r\nanswerable to the people. The people of the United States have declared\r\nthat this Constitution shall be the supreme law. We must either admit\r\nthe proposition, or dispute their authority. The States are,\r\nunquestionably, sovereign, so far as their sovereignty is not affected\r\nby this supreme law. But the State legislatures, as political bodies,\r\nhowever sovereign, are yet not sovereign over the people. So far as the\r\npeople have given power to the general government, so far the grant is\r\nunquestionably good, and the government holds of the people, and not of\r\nthe State governments. We are all agents of the same supreme power, the\r\npeople. The general government and the State governments derive their\r\nauthority from the same source. Neither can, in relation to the other,\r\nbe called primary, though one is definite and restricted, and the other\r\ngeneral and residuary. The national government possesses those powers\r\nwhich it can be shown the people have conferred on it, and no more. All\r\nthe rest belongs to the State governments, or to the people themselves.\r\nSo far as the people have restrained State sovereignty, by the\r\nexpression of their will, in the Constitution of the United States, so\r\nfar, it must be admitted, State sovereignty is effectually controlled. I\r\ndo not contend that it is, or ought to be, controlled farther. The\r\nsentiment to which I have referred propounds that State sovereignty is\r\nonly to be controlled by its own \"feeling of justice\"; that is to say,\r\nit is not to be controlled at all, for one who is to follow his own\r\nfeelings is under no legal control. Now, however men may think this\r\nought to be, the fact is, that the people of the United States have\r\nchosen to impose control on State sovereignties. There are those,\r\ndoubtless, who wish they had been left without restraint; but the\r\nConstitution has ordered the matter differently. To make war, for\r\ninstance, is an exercise of sovereignty; but the Constitution declares\r\nthat no State shall make war. To coin money is another exercise of\r\nsovereign power; but no State is at liberty to coin money. Again, the\r\nConstitution says that no sovereign State shall be so sovereign as to\r\nmake a treaty. These prohibitions, it must be confessed, are a control\r\non the State sovereignty of South Carolina, as well as of the other\r\nStates, which does not arise \"from her own feelings of honorable\r\njustice.\" The opinion referred to, therefore, is in defiance of the\r\nplainest provisions of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThere are other proceedings of public bodies which have already been\r\nalluded to, and to which I refer again for the purpose of ascertaining\r\nmore fully what is the length and breadth of that doctrine, denominated\r\nthe Carolina doctrine, which the honorable member has now stood up on\r\nthis floor to maintain. In one of them I find it resolved, that \"the\r\ntariff of 1828, and every other tariff designed to promote one branch of\r\nindustry at the expense of others, is contrary to the meaning and\r\nintention of the federal compact; and such a dangerous, palpable, and\r\ndeliberate usurpation of power, by a determined majority, wielding the\r\ngeneral government beyond the limits of its delegated powers, as calls\r\nupon the States which compose the suffering minority, in their sovereign\r\ncapacity, to exercise the powers which, as sovereigns, necessarily\r\ndevolve upon them, when their compact is violated.\"\r\n\r\nObserve, Sir, that this resolution holds the tariff of 1828, and every\r\nother tariff designed to promote one branch of industry at the expense\r\nof another, to be such a dangerous, palpable, and deliberate usurpation\r\nof power, as calls upon the States, in their sovereign capacity, to\r\ninterfere by their own authority. This denunciation, Mr. President, you\r\nwill please to observe, includes our old tariff of 1816, as well as all\r\nothers; because that was established to promote the interest of the\r\nmanufacturers of cotton, to the manifest and admitted injury of the\r\nCalcutta cotton trade. Observe, again, that all the qualifications are\r\nhere rehearsed and charged upon the tariff, which are necessary to bring\r\nthe case within the gentleman's proposition. The tariff is a usurpation;\r\nit is a dangerous usurpation; it is a palpable usurpation; it is a\r\ndeliberate usurpation. It is such a usurpation, therefore, as calls upon\r\nthe States to exercise their right of interference. Here is a case,\r\nthen, within the gentleman's principles, and all his qualifications of\r\nhis principles. It is a case for action. The Constitution is plainly,\r\ndangerously, palpably, and deliberately violated; and the States must\r\ninterpose their own authority to arrest the law. Let us suppose the\r\nState of South Carolina to express this same opinion, by the voice of\r\nher legislature. That would be very imposing; but what then? Is the\r\nvoice of one State conclusive? It so happens that, at the very moment\r\nwhen South Carolina resolves that the tariff laws are unconstitutional,\r\nPennsylvania and Kentucky resolve exactly the reverse. _They_ hold those\r\nlaws to be both highly proper and strictly constitutional. And now, Sir,\r\nhow does the honorable member propose to deal with this case? How does\r\nhe relieve us from this difficulty, upon any principle of his? His\r\nconstruction gets us into it; how does he propose to get us out?\r\n\r\nIn Carolina, the tariff is a palpable, deliberate usurpation; Carolina,\r\ntherefore, may nullify it, and refuse to pay the duties. In\r\nPennsylvania, it is both clearly constitutional and highly expedient;\r\nand there the duties are to be paid. And yet we live under a government\r\nof uniform laws, and under a Constitution too, which contains an express\r\nprovision, as it happens, that all duties shall be equal in all the\r\nStates. Does not this approach absurdity?\r\n\r\nIf there be no power to settle such questions, independent of either of\r\nthe States, is not the whole Union a rope of sand? Are we not thrown\r\nback again, precisely, upon the old Confederation?\r\n\r\nIt is too plain to be argued. Four-and-twenty interpreters of\r\nconstitutional law, each with a power to decide for itself, and none\r\nwith authority to bind anybody else, and this constitutional law the\r\nonly bond of their union! What is such a state of things but a mere\r\nconnection during pleasure, or, to use the phraseology of the times,\r\n_during feeling_? And that feeling, too, not the feeling of the people,\r\nwho established the Constitution, but the feeling of the State\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\nIn another of the South Carolina addresses, having premised that the\r\ncrisis requires \"all the concentrated energy of passion,\" an attitude of\r\nopen resistance to the laws of the Union is advised. Open resistance to\r\nthe laws, then, is the constitutional remedy, the conservative power of\r\nthe State, which the South Carolina doctrines teach for the redress of\r\npolitical evils, real or imaginary. And its authors further say, that,\r\nappealing with confidence to the Constitution itself, to justify their\r\nopinions, they cannot consent to try their accuracy by the courts of\r\njustice. In one sense, indeed, Sir, this is assuming an attitude of open\r\nresistance in favor of liberty. But what sort of liberty? The liberty of\r\nestablishing their own opinions, in defiance of the opinions of all\r\nothers; the liberty of judging and of deciding exclusively themselves,\r\nin a matter in which others have as much right to judge and decide as\r\nthey; the liberty of placing their own opinions above the judgment of\r\nall others, above the laws, and above the Constitution. This is their\r\nliberty, and this is the fair result of the proposition contended for by\r\nthe honorable gentleman. Or, it may be more properly said, it is\r\nidentical with it, rather than a result from it.\r\n\r\nIn the same publication we find the following: \"Previously to our\r\nRevolution, when the arm of oppression was stretched over New England,\r\nwhere did our Northern brethren meet with a braver sympathy than that\r\nwhich sprung from the bosoms of Carolinians? We had no extortion, no\r\noppression, no collision with the king's ministers, no navigation\r\ninterests springing up, in envious rivalry of England.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems extraordinary language. South Carolina no collision with the\r\nking's ministers in 1775! No extortion! No oppression! But, Sir, it is\r\nalso most significant language. Does any man doubt the purpose for which\r\nit was penned? Can anyone fail to see that it was designed to raise in\r\nthe reader's mind the question, whether, _at this time_,--that is to\r\nsay, in 1828,--South Carolina has any collision with the king's\r\nministers, any oppression, or extortion, to fear from England? whether,\r\nin short, England is not as naturally the friend of South Carolina as\r\nNew England, with her navigation interests springing up in envious\r\nrivalry of England?\r\n\r\nIs it not strange, Sir, that an intelligent man in South Carolina, in\r\n1828, should thus labor to prove that, in 1775, there was no hostility,\r\nno cause of war, between South Carolina and England? That she had no\r\noccasion, in reference to her own interest, or from a regard to her own\r\nwelfare, to take up arms in the Revolutionary contest? Can any one\r\naccount for the expression of such strange sentiments, and their\r\ncirculation through the State, otherwise than by supposing the object to\r\nbe what I have already intimated, to raise the question, if they had no\r\n\"_collision_\" (mark the expression) with the ministers of King George\r\nthe Third, in 1775, what _collision_ have they, in 1828, with the\r\nministers of King George the Fourth? What is there now, in the existing\r\nstate of things, to separate Carolina from _Old_, more, or rather, than\r\nfrom _New_ England?\r\n\r\nResolutions, Sir, have been recently passed by the legislature of South\r\nCarolina. I need not refer to them; they go no farther than the\r\nhonorable gentleman himself has gone, and I hope not so far. I content\r\nmyself, therefore, with debating the matter with him.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, what I have first to say on this subject is, that at no\r\ntime, and under no circumstances, has New England, or any State in New\r\nEngland, or any respectable body of persons in New England, or any\r\npublic man of standing in New England, put forth such a doctrine as this\r\nCarolina doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman has found no case, he can find none, to support his own\r\nopinions by New England authority. New England has studied the\r\nConstitution in other schools, and under other teachers. She looks upon\r\nit with other regards, and deems more highly and reverently both of its\r\njust authority and its utility and excellence. The history of her\r\nlegislative proceedings may be traced. The ephemeral effusions of\r\ntemporary bodies, called together by the excitement of the occasion, may\r\nbe hunted up; they have been hunted up. The opinions and votes of her\r\npublic men, in and out of Congress, may be explored. It will all be in\r\nvain. The Carolina doctrine can derive from her neither countenance nor\r\nsupport. She rejects it now; she always did reject it; and till she\r\nloses her senses, she always will reject it. The honorable member has\r\nreferred to expressions on the subject of the embargo law, made in this\r\nplace, by an honorable and venerable gentleman,[6] now favoring us with\r\nhis presence. He quotes that distinguished Senator as saying, that, in\r\nhis judgment, the embargo law was unconstitutional, and that therefore,\r\nin his opinion, the people were not bound to obey it. That, Sir, is\r\nperfectly constitutional language. An unconstitutional law is not\r\nbinding; _but then it does not rest with a resolution or a law of a\r\nState legislature to decide whether an act of Congress be or be not\r\nconstitutional_. An unconstitutional act of Congress would not bind the\r\npeople of this District, although they have no legislature to interfere\r\nin their behalf; and, on the other hand, a constitutional law of\r\nCongress does bind the citizens of every State, although all their\r\nlegislatures should undertake to annul it by act or resolution. The\r\nvenerable Connecticut Senator is a constitutional lawyer, of sound\r\nprinciples and enlarged knowledge; a statesman practised and\r\nexperienced, bred in the company of Washington, and holding just views\r\nupon the nature of our governments. He believed the embargo\r\nunconstitutional, and so did others; but what then? Who did he suppose\r\nwas to decide that question? The State legislatures? Certainly not. No\r\nsuch sentiment ever escaped his lips.\r\n\r\nLet us follow up, Sir, this New England opposition to the embargo laws;\r\nlet us trace it, till we discern the principle which controlled and\r\ngoverned New England throughout the whole course of that opposition. We\r\nshall then see what similarity there is between the New England school\r\nof constitutional opinions, and this modern Carolina school. The\r\ngentleman, I think, read a petition from some single individual\r\naddressed to the legislature of Massachusetts, asserting the Carolina\r\ndoctrine; that is, the right of State interference to arrest the laws of\r\nthe Union. The fate of that petition shows the sentiment of the\r\nlegislature. It met no favor. The opinions of Massachusetts were very\r\ndifferent. They had been expressed in 1798, in answer to the resolutions\r\nof Virginia, and she did not depart from them, nor bend them to the\r\ntimes. Misgoverned, wronged, oppressed, as she felt herself to be, she\r\nstill held fast her integrity to the Union. The gentleman may find in\r\nher proceedings much evidence of dissatisfaction with the measures of\r\ngovernment, and great and deep dislike to the embargo; all this makes\r\nthe case so much the stronger for her; for, notwithstanding all this\r\ndissatisfaction and dislike, she still claimed no right to sever the\r\nbonds of the Union. There was heat, and there was anger in her political\r\nfeeling. Be it so; but neither her heat nor her anger betrayed her into\r\ninfidelity to the government. The gentleman labors to prove that she\r\ndisliked the embargo as much as South Carolina dislikes the tariff, and\r\nexpressed her dislike as strongly. Be it so; but did she propose the\r\nCarolina remedy? did she threaten to interfere, by State authority, to\r\nannul the laws of the Union? That is the question for the gentleman's\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, Sir, a great majority of the people of New England\r\nconscientiously believed the embargo law of 1807 unconstitutional; as\r\nconscientiously, certainly, as the people of South Carolina hold that\r\nopinion of the tariff. They reasoned thus: Congress has power to\r\nregulate commerce; but here is a law, they said, stopping all commerce,\r\nand stopping it indefinitely. The law is perpetual; that is, it is not\r\nlimited in point of time, and must of course continue until it shall be\r\nrepealed by some other law. It is as perpetual, therefore, as the law\r\nagainst treason or murder. Now, is this regulating commerce, or\r\ndestroying it? Is it guiding, controlling, giving the rule to commerce,\r\nas a subsisting thing or is it putting an end to it altogether? Nothing\r\nis more certain, than that a majority in New England deemed this law a\r\nviolation of the Constitution. The very case required by the gentleman\r\nto justify State interference had then arisen. Massachusetts believed\r\nthis law to be \"a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of a\r\npower not granted by the Constitution.\" Deliberate it was, for it was\r\nlong continued; palpable she thought it, as no words in the Constitution\r\ngave the power, and only a construction, in her opinion most violent,\r\nraised it; dangerous it was, since it threatened utter ruin to her most\r\nimportant interests. Here, then, was a Carolina case. How did\r\nMassachusetts deal with it? It was, as she thought, a plain, manifest,\r\npalpable violation of the Constitution, and it brought ruin to her\r\ndoors. Thousands of families, and hundreds of thousands of individuals,\r\nwere beggared by it. While she saw and felt all this, she saw and felt\r\nalso, that, as a measure of national policy, it was perfectly futile;\r\nthat the country was no way benefited by that which caused so much\r\nindividual distress; that it was efficient only for the production of\r\nevil, and all that evil inflicted on ourselves. In such a case, under\r\nsuch circumstances, how did Massachusetts demean herself? Sir, she\r\nremonstrated, she memorialized, she addressed herself to the general\r\ngovernment, not exactly \"with the concentrated energy of passion,\" but\r\nwith her own strong sense, and the energy of sober conviction. But she\r\ndid not interpose the arm of her own power to arrest the law, and break\r\nthe embargo. Far from it. Her principles bound her to two things; and\r\nshe followed her principles, lead where they might. First, to submit to\r\nevery constitutional law of Congress, and secondly, if the\r\nconstitutional validity of the law be doubted, to refer that question to\r\nthe decision of the proper tribunals. The first principle is vain and\r\nineffectual without the second. A majority of us in New England believed\r\nthe embargo law unconstitutional; but the great question was, and always\r\nwill be in such cases, Who is to decide this? Who is to judge between\r\nthe people and the government? And, Sir, it is quite plain, that the\r\nConstitution of the United States confers on the government itself, to\r\nbe exercised by its appropriate department, and under its own\r\nresponsibility to the people, this power of deciding ultimately and\r\nconclusively upon the just extent of its own authority. If this had not\r\nbeen done, we should not have advanced a single step beyond the old\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nBeing fully of opinion that the embargo law was unconstitutional, the\r\npeople of New England were yet equally clear in the opinion, (it was a\r\nmatter they did doubt upon,) that the question, after all, must be\r\ndecided by the judicial tribunals of the United States. Before those\r\ntribunals, therefore, they brought the question. Under the provisions of\r\nthe law, they had given bonds to millions in amount, and which were\r\nalleged to be forfeited. They suffered the bonds to be sued, and thus\r\nraised the question. In the old-fashioned way of settling disputes, they\r\nwent to law. The case came to hearing and solemn argument; and he who\r\nespoused their cause, and stood up for them against the validity of the\r\nembargo act, was none other than that great man, of whom the gentleman\r\nhas made honorable mention, Samuel Dexter. He was then, Sir, in the\r\nfulness of his knowledge, and the maturity of his strength. He had\r\nretired from long and distinguished public service here, to the renewed\r\npursuit of professional duties, carrying with him all that enlargement\r\nand expansion, all the new strength and force, which an acquaintance\r\nwith the more general subjects discussed in the national councils is\r\ncapable of adding to professional attainment, in a mind of true\r\ngreatness and comprehension. He was a lawyer, and he was also a\r\nstatesman. He had studied the Constitution, when he filled public\r\nstation, that he might defend it; he had examined its principles that he\r\nmight maintain them. More than all men, or at least as much as any man,\r\nhe was attached to the general government and to the union of the\r\nStates. His feelings and opinions all ran in that direction. A question\r\nof constitutional law, too, was, of all subjects, that one which was\r\nbest suited to his talents and learning. Aloof from technicality, and\r\nunfettered by artificial rule, such a question gave opportunity for that\r\ndeep and clear analysis, that mighty grasp of principle, which so much\r\ndistinguished his higher efforts. His very statement was argument; his\r\ninference seemed demonstration. The earnestness of his own conviction\r\nwrought conviction in others. One was convinced, and believed, and\r\nassented, because it was gratifying, delightful, to think, and feel, and\r\nbelieve, in unison with an intellect of such evident superiority.\r\n\r\nMr. Dexter, Sir, such as I have described him, argued the New England\r\ncause. He put into his effort his whole heart, as well as all the powers\r\nof his understanding; for he had avowed, in the most public manner, his\r\nentire concurrence with his neighbors on the point in dispute. He argued\r\nthe cause; it was lost, and New England submitted. The established\r\ntribunals pronounced the law constitutional, and New England acquiesced.\r\nNow, Sir, is not this the exact opposite of the doctrine of the\r\ngentleman from South Carolina? According to him, instead of referring to\r\nthe judicial tribunals, we should have broken up the embargo by laws of\r\nour own; we should have repealed it, _quoad_ New England; for we had a\r\nstrong, palpable, and oppressive case. Sir, we believed the embargo\r\nunconstitutional; but still that was matter of opinion, and who was to\r\ndecide it? We thought it a clear case; but, nevertheless, we did not\r\ntake the law into our own hands, because we did not wish to bring about\r\na revolution, nor to break up the Union; for I maintain, that between\r\nsubmission to the decision of the constituted tribunals, and revolution,\r\nor disunion, there is no middle ground; there is no ambiguous condition,\r\nhalf allegiance and half rebellion. And, Sir, how futile, how very\r\nfutile it is, to admit the right of State interference, and then attempt\r\nto save it from the character of unlawful resistance, by adding terms of\r\nqualification to the causes and occasions, leaving all these\r\nqualifications, like the case itself, in the discretion of the State\r\ngovernments. It must be a clear case, it is said, a deliberate case, a\r\npalpable case, a dangerous case. But then the State is still left at\r\nliberty to decide for herself what is clear, what is deliberate, what is\r\npalpable, what is dangerous. Do adjectives and epithets avail any thing?\r\n\r\nSir, the human mind is so constituted, that the merits of both sides of\r\na controversy appear very clear, and very palpable, to those who\r\nrespectively espouse them; and both sides usually grow clearer as the\r\ncontroversy advances. South Carolina sees unconstitutionality in the\r\ntariff; she sees oppression there also, and she sees danger.\r\nPennsylvania, with a vision not less sharp, looks at the same tariff,\r\nand sees no such thing in it; she sees it all constitutional, all\r\nuseful, all safe. The faith of South Carolina is strengthened by\r\nopposition, and she now not only sees, but _resolves_, that the tariff\r\nis palpably unconstitutional, oppressive, and dangerous; but\r\nPennsylvania, not to be behind her neighbors, and equally willing to\r\nstrengthen her own faith by a confident asseveration, _resolves_ also,\r\nand gives to every warm affirmative of South Carolina, a plain,\r\ndownright, Pennsylvania negative. South Carolina, to show the strength\r\nand unity of her opinion, brings her assembly to a unanimity, within\r\nseven voices; Pennsylvania, not to be outdone in this respect any more\r\nthan in others, reduces her dissentient fraction to a single vote. Now,\r\nSir, again, I ask the gentleman, What is to be done? Are these States\r\nboth right? Is he bound to consider them both right? If not, which is in\r\nthe wrong? or rather, which has the best right to decide? And if he, and\r\nif I, are not to know what the Constitution means, and what it is, till\r\nthose two State legislatures, and the twenty-two others, shall agree in\r\nits construction, what have we sworn to, when we have sworn to maintain\r\nit? I was forcibly struck, Sir, with one reflection, as the gentleman\r\nwent on in his speech. He quoted Mr. Madison's resolutions, to prove\r\nthat a State may interfere, in a case of deliberate, palpable, and\r\ndangerous exercise of a power not granted. The honorable member supposes\r\nthe tariff law to be such an exercise of power; and that consequently a\r\ncase has arisen in which the State may, if it see fit, interfere by its\r\nown law. Now it so happens, nevertheless, that Mr. Madison deems this\r\nsame tariff law quite constitutional. Instead of a clear and palpable\r\nviolation, it is, in his judgment, no violation at all. So that, while\r\nthey use his authority for a hypothetical case, they reject it in the\r\nvery case before them. All this, Sir, shows the inherent futility, I had\r\nalmost used a stronger word, of conceding this power of interference to\r\nthe State, and then attempting to secure it from abuse by imposing\r\nqualifications of which the States themselves are to judge. One of two\r\nthings is true; either the laws of the Union are beyond the discretion\r\nand beyond the control of the States; or else we have no constitution of\r\ngeneral government, and are thrust back again to the days of the\r\nConfederation.\r\n\r\nLet me here say, Sir, that if the gentleman's doctrine had been received\r\nand acted upon in New England, in the times of the embargo and\r\nnon-intercourse, we should probably not now have been here. The\r\ngovernment would very likely have gone to pieces, and crumbled into\r\ndust. No stronger case can ever arise than existed under those laws; no\r\nStates can ever entertain a clearer conviction than the New England\r\nStates then entertained; and if they had been under the influence of\r\nthat heresy of opinion, as I must call it, which the honorable member\r\nespouses, this Union would, in all probability, have been scattered to\r\nthe four winds. I ask the gentleman, therefore, to apply his principles\r\nto that case; I ask him to come forth and declare, whether, in his\r\nopinion, the New England States would have been justified in interfering\r\nto break up the embargo system under the conscientious opinions which\r\nthey held upon it? Had they a right to annul that law? Does he admit or\r\ndeny? If what is thought palpably unconstitutional in South Carolina\r\njustifies that State in arresting the progress of the law, tell me\r\nwhether that which was thought palpably unconstitutional also in\r\nMassachusetts would have justified her in doing the same thing. Sir, I\r\ndeny the whole doctrine. It has not a foot of ground in the Constitution\r\nto stand on. No public man of reputation ever advanced it in\r\nMassachusetts in the warmest times, or could maintain himself upon it\r\nthere at any time.\r\n\r\nI wish now, Sir, to make a remark upon the Virginia resolutions of 1798.\r\nI cannot undertake to say how these resolutions were understood by those\r\nwho passed them. Their language is not a little indefinite. In the case\r\nof the exercise by Congress of a dangerous power not granted to them,\r\nthe resolutions assert the right, on the part of the State, to interfere\r\nand arrest the progress of the evil. This is susceptible of more than\r\none interpretation. It may mean no more than that the States may\r\ninterfere by complaint and remonstrance, or by proposing to the people\r\nan alteration of the Federal Constitution. This would all be quite\r\nunobjectionable. Or it may be that no more is meant than to assert the\r\ngeneral right of revolution, as against all governments, in cases of\r\nintolerable oppression. This no one doubts, and this, in my opinion, is\r\nall that he who framed the resolutions could have meant by it; for I\r\nshall not readily believe that he was ever of opinion that a State,\r\nunder the Constitution and in conformity with it, could, upon the ground\r\nof her own opinion of its unconstitutionality, however clear and\r\npalpable she might think the case, annul a law of Congress, so far as it\r\nshould operate on herself by her own legislative power.\r\n\r\nI must now beg to ask, Sir, Whence is this supposed right of the States\r\nderived? Where do they find the power to interfere with the laws of the\r\nUnion? Sir, the opinion which the honorable gentleman maintains is a\r\nnotion founded in a total misapprehension, in my judgment, of the origin\r\nof this government, and of the foundation on which it stands. I hold it\r\nto be a popular government, erected by the people; those who administer\r\nit, responsible to the people; and itself capable of being amended and\r\nmodified, just as the people may choose it should be. It is as popular,\r\njust as truly emanating from the people, as the State governments. It is\r\ncreated for one purpose; the State governments for another. It has its\r\nown powers; they have theirs. There is no more authority with them to\r\narrest the operation of a law of Congress, than with Congress to arrest\r\nthe operation of their laws. We are here to administer a Constitution\r\nemanating immediately from the people, and trusted by them to our\r\nadministration. It is not the creature of the State governments. It is\r\nof no moment to the argument, that certain acts of the State\r\nlegislatures are necessary to fill our seats in this body. That is not\r\none of their original State powers, a part of the sovereignty of the\r\nState. It is a duty which the people, by the Constitution itself, have\r\nimposed on the State legislatures; and which they might have left to be\r\nperformed elsewhere, if they had seen fit. So they have left the choice\r\nof President with electors; but all this does not affect the proposition\r\nthat this whole government, President, Senate, and House of\r\nRepresentatives, is a popular government. It leaves it still all its\r\npopular character. The governor of a State (in some of the States) is\r\nchosen, not directly by the people, but by those who are chosen by the\r\npeople, for the purpose of performing, among other duties, that of\r\nelecting a governor. Is the government of the State, on that account,\r\nnot a popular government? This government, Sir, is the independent\r\noffspring of the popular will. It is not the creature of State\r\nlegislatures; nay, more, if the whole truth must be told, the people\r\nbrought it into existence, established it, and have hitherto supported\r\nit, for the very purpose, amongst others, of imposing certain salutary\r\nrestraints on State sovereignties. The States cannot now make war; they\r\ncannot contract alliances; they cannot make, each for itself, separate\r\nregulations of commerce; they cannot lay imposts; they cannot coin\r\nmoney. If this Constitution, Sir, be the creature of State legislatures,\r\nit must be admitted that it has obtained a strange control over the\r\nvolitions of its creators.\r\n\r\nThe people, then, Sir, erected this government. They gave it a\r\nConstitution, and in that Constitution they have enumerated the powers\r\nwhich they bestow on it. They have made it a limited government. They\r\nhave defined its authority. They have restrained it to the exercise of\r\nsuch powers as are granted; and all others, they declare, are reserved\r\nto the States or the people. But, Sir, they have not stopped here. If\r\nthey had, they would have accomplished but half their work. No\r\ndefinition can be so clear, as to avoid possibility of doubt; no\r\nlimitation so precise as to exclude all uncertainty. Who, then, shall\r\nconstrue this grant of the people? Who shall interpret their will, where\r\nit may be supposed they have left it doubtful? With whom do they repose\r\nthis ultimate right of deciding on the powers of the government? Sir,\r\nthey have settled all this in the fullest manner. They have left it with\r\nthe government itself, in its appropriate branches. Sir, the very chief\r\nend, the main design, for which the whole Constitution was framed and\r\nadopted, was to establish a government that should not be obliged to act\r\nthrough State agency, or depend on State opinion and State discretion.\r\nThe people had had quite enough of that kind of government under the\r\nConfederation. Under that system, the legal action, the application of\r\nlaw to individuals, belonged exclusively to the States. Congress could\r\nonly recommend; their acts were not of binding force, till the States\r\nhad adopted and sanctioned them. Are we in that condition still? Are we\r\nyet at the mercy of State discretion and State construction? Sir, if we\r\nare, then vain will be our attempt to maintain the Constitution under\r\nwhich we sit.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the people have wisely provided, in the Constitution itself, a\r\nproper, suitable mode and tribunal for settling questions of\r\nconstitutional law. There are in the Constitution grants of powers to\r\nCongress, and restrictions on these powers. There are, also,\r\nprohibitions on the States. Some authority must, therefore, necessarily\r\nexist, having the ultimate jurisdiction to fix and ascertain the\r\ninterpretation of these grants, restrictions, and prohibitions. The\r\nConstitution has itself pointed out, ordained, and established that\r\nauthority. How has it accomplished this great and essential end? By\r\ndeclaring, Sir, that \"_the Constitution, and the laws of the United\r\nStates made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land,\r\nany thing in the constitution or laws of any State to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding_.\"\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, was the first great step. By this the supremacy of the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States is declared. The people so\r\nwill it. No State law is to be valid which comes in conflict with the\r\nConstitution, or any law of the United States passed in pursuance of it.\r\nBut who shall decide this question of interference? To whom lies the\r\nlast appeal? This, Sir, the Constitution itself decides also, by\r\ndeclaring, \"_that the judicial power shall extend to all cases arising\r\nunder the Constitution and laws of the United States_.\" These two\r\nprovisions cover the whole ground. They are, in truth, the keystone of\r\nthe arch! With these it is a government; without them it is a\r\nconfederation. In pursuance of these clear and express provisions,\r\nCongress established, at its very first session, in the judicial act, a\r\nmode for carrying them into full effect, and for bringing all questions\r\nof constitutional power to the final decision of the Supreme Court. It\r\nthen, Sir, became a government. It then had the means of\r\nself-protection; and but for this, it would, in all probability, have\r\nbeen now among things which are past. Having constituted the government,\r\nand declared its powers, the people have further said, that, since\r\nsomebody must decide on the extent of these powers, the government shall\r\nitself decide; subject, always, like other popular governments, to its\r\nresponsibility to the people. And now, Sir, I repeat, how is it that a\r\nState legislature acquires any power to interfere? Who, or what, gives\r\nthem the right to say to the people, \"We, who are your agents and\r\nservants for one purpose, will undertake to decide, that your other\r\nagents and servants, appointed by you for another purpose, have\r\ntranscended the authority you gave them!\" The reply would be, I think,\r\nnot impertinent, \"Who made you a judge over another's servants? To their\r\nown masters they stand or fall.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I deny this power of State legislatures altogether. It cannot stand\r\nthe test of examination. Gentlemen may say, that, in an extreme case, a\r\nState government might protect the people from intolerable oppression.\r\nSir, in such a case, the people might protect themselves, without the\r\naid of the State governments. Such a case warrants revolution. It must\r\nmake, when it comes, a law for itself. A nullifying act of a State\r\nlegislature cannot alter the case, nor make resistance any more lawful.\r\nIn maintaining these sentiments, Sir, I am but asserting the rights of\r\nthe people. I state what they have declared, and insist on their right\r\nto declare it. They have chosen to repose this power in the general\r\ngovernment, and I think it my duty to support it, like other\r\nconstitutional powers.\r\n\r\nFor myself, Sir, I do not admit the competency of South Carolina, or any\r\nother State, to prescribe my constitutional duty; or to settle, between\r\nme and the people, the validity of laws of Congress for which I have\r\nvoted. I decline her umpirage. I have not sworn to support the\r\nConstitution according to her construction of its clauses. I have not\r\nstipulated, by my oath of office or otherwise, to come under any\r\nresponsibility, except to the people, and those whom they have appointed\r\nto pass upon the question, whether laws, supported by my votes, conform\r\nto the Constitution of the country. And, Sir, if we look to the general\r\nnature of the case, could any thing have been more preposterous, than to\r\nmake a government for the whole Union, and yet leave its powers subject,\r\nnot to one interpretation, but to thirteen or twenty-four\r\ninterpretations? Instead of one tribunal, established by all,\r\nresponsible to all, with power to decide for all, shall constitutional\r\nquestions be left to four-and-twenty popular bodies, each at liberty to\r\ndecide for itself, and none bound to respect the decisions of\r\nothers,--and each at liberty, too, to give a new construction on every\r\nnew election of its own members? Would any thing, with such a principle\r\nin it, or rather with such a destitution of all principle, be fit to be\r\ncalled a government? No, Sir. It should not be denominated a\r\nConstitution. It should be called, rather, a collection of topics for\r\neverlasting controversy; heads of debate for a disputatious people. It\r\nwould not be a government. It would not be adequate to any practical\r\ngood, or fit for any country to live under.\r\n\r\nTo avoid all possibility of being misunderstood, allow me to repeat\r\nagain, in the fullest manner, that I claim no powers for the government\r\nby forced or unfair construction. I admit that it is a government of\r\nstrictly limited powers; of enumerated, specified, and particularized\r\npowers; and that whatsoever is not granted, is withheld. But\r\nnotwithstanding all this, and however the grant of powers may be\r\nexpressed, its limit and extent may yet, in some cases, admit of doubt;\r\nand the general government would be good for nothing, it would be\r\nincapable of long existing, if some mode had not been provided in which\r\nthose doubts, as they should arise, might be peaceably, but\r\nauthoritatively, solved.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. President, let me run the honorable gentleman's doctrine a\r\nlittle into its practical application. Let us look at his probable\r\n_modus operandi_. If a thing can be done, an ingenious man can tell\r\n_how_ it is to be done, and I wish to be informed _how_ this State\r\ninterference is to be put in practice, without violence, bloodshed, and\r\nrebellion. We will take the existing case of the tariff law. South\r\nCarolina is said to have made up her opinion upon it. If we do not\r\nrepeal it, (as we probably shall not,) she will then apply to the case\r\nthe remedy of her doctrine. She will, we must suppose, pass a law of her\r\nlegislature, declaring the several acts of Congress usually called the\r\ntariff laws null and void, so far as they respect South Carolina, or the\r\ncitizens thereof. So far, all is a paper transaction, and easy enough.\r\nBut the collector at Charleston is collecting the duties imposed by\r\nthese tariff laws. He, therefore, must be stopped. The collector will\r\nseize the goods if the tariff duties are not paid. The State authorities\r\nwill undertake their rescue, the marshal, with his posse, will come to\r\nthe collector's aid, and here the contest begins. The militia of the\r\nState will be called out to sustain the nullifying act. They will march,\r\nSir, under a very gallant leader; for I believe the honorable member\r\nhimself commands the militia of that part of the State. He will raise\r\nthe NULLIFYING ACT on his standard, and spread it out as his banner! It\r\nwill have a preamble, setting forth that the tariff laws are palpable,\r\ndeliberate, and dangerous violations of the Constitution! He will\r\nproceed, with this banner flying, to the custom-house in Charleston,\r\n\r\n                        \"All the while\r\n    Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds.\"\r\n\r\nArrived at the custom-house, he will tell the collector that he must\r\ncollect no more duties under any of the tariff laws. This he will be\r\nsomewhat puzzled to say, by the way, with a grave countenance,\r\nconsidering what hand South Carolina herself had in that of 1816. But,\r\nSir, the collector would not, probably, desist, at his bidding. He would\r\nshow him the law of Congress, the treasury instruction, and his own oath\r\nof office. He would say, he should perform his duty, come what come\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nHere would ensue a pause; for they say that a certain stillness precedes\r\nthe tempest. The trumpeter would hold his breath awhile, and before all\r\nthis military array should fall on the custom-house, collector, clerks,\r\nand all, it is very probable some of those composing it would request of\r\ntheir gallant commander-in-chief to be informed a little upon the point\r\nof law; for they have, doubtless, a just respect for his opinions as a\r\nlawyer, as well as for his bravery as a soldier. They know he has read\r\nBlackstone and the Constitution, as well as Turenne and Vauban. They\r\nwould ask him, therefore, something concerning their rights in this\r\nmatter. They would inquire, whether it was not somewhat dangerous to\r\nresist a law of the United States. What would be the nature of their\r\noffence, they would wish to learn, if they, by military force and array,\r\nresisted the execution in Carolina of a law of the United States, and it\r\nshould turn out, after all, that the law _was constitutional_? He would\r\nanswer, of course, Treason. No lawyer could give any other answer. John\r\nFries, he would tell them, had learned that, some years ago. How, then,\r\nthey would ask, do you propose to defend us? We are not afraid of\r\nbullets, but treason has a way of taking people off that we do not much\r\nrelish. How do you propose to defend us? \"Look at my floating banner,\"\r\nhe would reply; \"see there the _nullifying law_!\" Is it your opinion,\r\ngallant commander, they would then say, that, if we should be indicted\r\nfor treason, that same floating banner of yours would make a good plea\r\nin bar? \"South Carolina is a sovereign State,\" he would reply. That is\r\ntrue; but would the judge admit our plea? \"These tariff laws,\" he would\r\nrepeat, \"are unconstitutional, palpably, deliberately, dangerously.\"\r\nThat may all be so; but if the tribunal should not happen to be of that\r\nopinion, shall we swing for it? We are ready to die for our country, but\r\nit is rather an awkward business, this dying without touching the\r\nground! After all, that is a sort of hemp tax worse than any part of the\r\ntariff.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the honorable gentleman would be in a dilemma, like that\r\nof another great general. He would have a knot before him which he could\r\nnot untie. He must cut it with his sword. He must say to his followers,\r\n\"Defend yourselves with your bayonets\"; and this is war,--civil war.\r\n\r\nDirect collision, therefore, between force and force, is the unavoidable\r\nresult of that remedy for the revision of unconstitutional laws which\r\nthe gentleman contends for. It must happen in the very first case to\r\nwhich it is applied. Is not this the plain result? To resist by force\r\nthe execution of a law, generally, is treason. Can the courts of the\r\nUnited States take notice of the indulgence of a State to commit\r\ntreason? The common saying, that a State cannot commit treason herself,\r\nis nothing to the purpose. Can she authorize others to do it? If John\r\nFries had produced an act of Pennsylvania, annulling the law of\r\nCongress, would it have helped his case? Talk about it as we will, these\r\ndoctrines go the length of revolution. They are incompatible with any\r\npeaceable administration of the government. They lead directly to\r\ndisunion and civil commotion; and therefore it is, that at their\r\ncommencement, when they are first found to be maintained by respectable\r\nmen, and in a tangible form, I enter my public protest against them all.\r\n\r\nThe honorable gentleman argues, that, if this government be the sole\r\njudge of the extent of its own powers, whether that right of judging be\r\nin Congress or the Supreme Court, it equally subverts State\r\nsovereignty. This the gentleman sees, or thinks he sees, although he\r\ncannot perceive how the right of judging, in this matter, if left to the\r\nexercise of State legislatures, has any tendency to subvert the\r\ngovernment of the Union. The gentleman's opinion may be, that the right\r\n_ought not_ to have been lodged with the general government; he may like\r\nbetter such a constitution as we should have under the right of State\r\ninterference; but I ask him to meet me on the plain matter of fact. I\r\nask him to meet me on the Constitution itself. I ask him if the power is\r\nnot found there, clearly and visibly found there?\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, what is this danger, and what are the grounds of it? Let it be\r\nremembered, that the Constitution of the United States is not\r\nunalterable. It is to continue in its present form no longer than the\r\npeople who established it shall choose to continue it. If they shall\r\nbecome convinced that they have made an injudicious or inexpedient\r\npartition and distribution of power between the State governments and\r\nthe general government, they can alter that distribution at will.\r\n\r\nIf any thing be found in the national Constitution, either by original\r\nprovision or subsequent interpretation, which ought not to be in it, the\r\npeople know how to get rid of it. If any construction, unacceptable to\r\nthem, be established, so as to become practically a part of the\r\nConstitution, they will amend it, at their own sovereign pleasure. But\r\nwhile the people choose to maintain it as it is, while they are\r\nsatisfied with it, and refuse to change it, who has given, or who can\r\ngive, to the State legislatures a right to alter it, either by\r\ninterference, construction, or otherwise? Gentlemen do not seem to\r\nrecollect that the people have any power to do any thing for themselves.\r\nThey imagine there is no safety for them, any longer than they are under\r\nthe close guardianship of the State legislatures. Sir, the people have\r\nnot trusted their safety, in regard to the general Constitution, to\r\nthese hands. They have required other security, and taken other bonds.\r\nThey have chosen to trust themselves, first, to the plain words of the\r\ninstrument, and to such construction as the government themselves, in\r\ndoubtful cases, should put on their own powers, under their oaths of\r\noffice, and subject to their responsibility to them; just as the people\r\nof a State trust their own State governments with a similar power.\r\nSecondly, they have reposed their trust in the efficacy of frequent\r\nelections, and in their own power to remove their own servants and\r\nagents whenever they see cause. Thirdly, they have reposed trust in the\r\njudicial power, which, in order that it might be trustworthy, they have\r\nmade as respectable, as disinterested, and as independent as was\r\npracticable. Fourthly, they have seen fit to rely, in case of necessity,\r\nor high expediency, on their known and admitted power to alter or amend\r\nthe Constitution, peaceably and quietly, whenever experience shall point\r\nout defects or imperfections. And, finally, the people of the United\r\nStates have at no time, in no way, directly or indirectly, authorized\r\nany State legislature to construe or interpret _their_ high instrument\r\nof government; much less, to interfere, by their own power, to arrest\r\nits course and operation.\r\n\r\nIf, Sir, the people in these respects had done otherwise than they have\r\ndone, their Constitution could neither have been preserved, nor would it\r\nhave been worth preserving. And if its plain provisions shall now be\r\ndisregarded, and these new doctrines interpolated in it, it will become\r\nas feeble and helpless a being as its enemies, whether early or more\r\nrecent, could possibly desire. It will exist in every State but as a\r\npoor dependent on State permission. It must borrow leave to be; and will\r\nbe, no longer than State pleasure, or State discretion, sees fit to\r\ngrant the indulgence, and to prolong its poor existence.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, although there are fears, there are hopes also. The people\r\nhave preserved this, their own chosen Constitution, for forty years, and\r\nhave seen their happiness, prosperity, and renown grow with its growth,\r\nand strengthen with its strength. They are now, generally, strongly\r\nattached to it. Overthrown by direct assault, it cannot be; evaded,\r\nundermined, NULLIFIED, it will not be, if we and those who shall succeed\r\nus here, as agents and representatives of the people, shall\r\nconscientiously and vigilantly discharge the two great branches of our\r\npublic trust, faithfully to preserve, and wisely to administer it.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have thus stated the reasons of my dissent to the\r\ndoctrines which have been advanced and maintained. I am conscious of\r\nhaving detained you and the Senate much too long. I was drawn into the\r\ndebate with no previous deliberation, such as is suited to the\r\ndiscussion of so grave and important a subject. But it is a subject of\r\nwhich my heart is full, and I have not been willing to suppress the\r\nutterance of its spontaneous sentiments. I cannot, even now, persuade\r\nmyself to relinquish it, without expressing once more my deep\r\nconviction, that, since it respects nothing less than the Union of the\r\nStates, it is of most vital and essential importance to the public\r\nhappiness. I profess, Sir, in my career hitherto, to have kept steadily\r\nin view the prosperity and honor of the whole country, and the\r\npreservation of our Federal Union. It is to that Union we owe our safety\r\nat home, and our consideration and dignity abroad. It is to that Union\r\nthat we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes us most proud of our\r\ncountry. That Union we reached only by the discipline of our virtues in\r\nthe severe school of adversity. It had its origin in the necessities of\r\ndisordered finance, prostrate commerce, and ruined credit. Under its\r\nbenign influences, these great interests immediately awoke, as from the\r\ndead, and sprang forth with newness of life. Every year of its duration\r\nhas teemed with fresh proofs of its utility and its blessings; and\r\nalthough our territory has stretched out wider and wider, and our\r\npopulation spread farther and farther, they have not outrun its\r\nprotection or its benefits. It has been to us all a copious fountain of\r\nnational, social, and personal happiness.\r\n\r\nI have not allowed myself, Sir, to look beyond the Union, to see what\r\nmight lie hidden in the dark recess behind. I have not coolly weighed\r\nthe chances of preserving liberty when the bonds that unite us together\r\nshall be broken asunder. I have not accustomed myself to hang over the\r\nprecipice of disunion, to see whether, with my short sight, I can fathom\r\nthe depth of the abyss below; nor could I regard him as a safe\r\ncounsellor in the affairs of this government, whose thoughts should be\r\nmainly bent on considering, not how the Union may be best preserved, but\r\nhow tolerable might be the condition of the people when it should be\r\nbroken up and destroyed. While the Union lasts, we have high, exciting,\r\ngratifying prospects spread out before us, for us and our children.\r\nBeyond that I seek not to penetrate the veil. God grant that, in my day,\r\nat least, that curtain may not rise! God grant that on my vision never\r\nmay be opened what lies behind! When my eyes shall be turned to behold\r\nfor the last time the sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the\r\nbroken and dishonored fragments of a once glorious Union; on States\r\ndissevered, discordant, belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or\r\ndrenched, it may be, in fraternal blood! Let their last feeble and\r\nlingering glance rather behold the gorgeous ensign of the republic, now\r\nknown and honored throughout the earth, still full high advanced, its\r\narms and trophies streaming in their original lustre, not a stripe\r\nerased or polluted, nor a single star obscured, bearing for its motto,\r\nno such miserable interrogatory as \"What is all this worth?\" nor those\r\nother words of delusion and folly, \"Liberty first and Union afterwards\";\r\nbut everywhere, spread all over in characters of living light, blazing\r\non all its ample folds, as they float over the sea and over the land,\r\nand in every wind under the whole heavens, that other sentiment, dear to\r\nevery true American heart,--Liberty _and_ Union, now and for ever, one\r\nand inseparable!\r\n\r\n     Mr. Hayne having rejoined to Mr. Webster, especially on the\r\n     constitutional question, Mr. Webster rose, and, in conclusion,\r\nsaid:--#/\r\n\r\nA few words, Mr. President, on this constitutional argument, which the\r\nhonorable gentleman has labored to reconstruct.\r\n\r\nHis argument consists of two propositions and an inference. His\r\npropositions are,--\r\n\r\n1. That the Constitution is a compact between the States.\r\n\r\n2. That a compact between two, with authority reserved to one to\r\ninterpret its terms, would be a surrender to that one of all power\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n3. Therefore, (such is his inference,) the general government does not\r\npossess the authority to construe its own powers.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, who does not see, without the aid of exposition or detection,\r\nthe utter confusion of ideas involved in this so elaborate and\r\nsystematic argument.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, it is said, is a compact _between States_; the States,\r\nthen, and the States only, _are parties_ to the compact. How comes the\r\ngeneral government itself _a party_? Upon the honorable gentleman's\r\nhypothesis, the general government is the result of the compact, the\r\ncreature of the compact, not one of the parties to it. Yet the argument,\r\nas the gentleman has now stated it, makes the government itself one of\r\nits own creators. It makes it a party to that compact to which it owes\r\nits own existence.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of erecting the Constitution on the basis of a compact,\r\nthe gentleman considers the States as parties to that compact; but as\r\nsoon as his compact is made, then he chooses to consider the general\r\ngovernment, which is the offspring of that compact, not its offspring,\r\nbut one of its parties; and so, being a party, without the power of\r\njudging on the terms of compact. Pray, Sir, in what school is such\r\nreasoning as this taught?\r\n\r\nIf the whole of the gentleman's main proposition were conceded to\r\nhim,--that is to say, if I admit, for the sake of the argument, that the\r\nConstitution is a compact between States,--the inferences which he draws\r\nfrom that proposition are warranted by no just reasoning. If the\r\nConstitution be a compact between States, still that Constitution, or\r\nthat compact, has established a government, with certain powers; and\r\nwhether it be one of those powers, that it shall construe and interpret\r\nfor itself the terms of the compact, in doubtful cases, is a question\r\nwhich can only be decided by looking to the compact, and inquiring what\r\nprovisions it contains on this point. Without any inconsistency with\r\nnatural reason, the government even thus created might be trusted with\r\nthis power of construction. The extent of its powers, therefore, must\r\nstill be sought for in the instrument itself.\r\n\r\nIf the old Confederation had contained a clause, declaring that\r\nresolutions of the Congress should be the supreme law of the land, any\r\nState law or constitution to the contrary notwithstanding, and that a\r\ncommittee of Congress, or any other body created by it, should possess\r\njudicial powers, extending to all cases arising under resolutions of\r\nCongress, then the power of ultimate decision would have been vested in\r\nCongress under the Confederation, although that Confederation was a\r\ncompact between States; and for this plain reason,--that it would have\r\nbeen competent to the States, who alone were parties to the compact, to\r\nagree who should decide in cases of dispute arising on the construction\r\nof the compact.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason, Sir, if I were now to concede to the gentleman his\r\nprincipal proposition, namely, that the Constitution is a compact\r\nbetween States, the question would still be, What provision is made, in\r\nthis compact, to settle points of disputed construction, or contested\r\npower, that shall come into controversy? And this question would still\r\nbe answered, and conclusively answered, by the Constitution itself.\r\n\r\nWhile the gentleman is contending against construction, he himself is\r\nsetting up the most loose and dangerous construction. The Constitution\r\ndeclares, that _the laws of Congress passed in pursuance of the\r\nConstitution shall be the supreme law of the land_. No construction is\r\nnecessary here. It declares, also, with equal plainness and precision,\r\n_that the judicial power of the United States shall extend to every case\r\narising under the laws of Congress_. This needs no construction. Here is\r\na law, then, which is declared to be supreme; and here is a power\r\nestablished, which is to interpret that law. Now, Sir, how has the\r\ngentleman met this? Suppose the Constitution to be a compact, yet here\r\nare its terms; and how does the gentleman get rid of them? He cannot\r\nargue the _seal off the bond_, nor the words out of the instrument. Here\r\nthey are; what answer does he give to them? None in the world, Sir,\r\nexcept, that the effect of this would be to place the States in a\r\ncondition of inferiority; and that it results from the very nature of\r\nthings, there being no superior, that the parties must be their own\r\njudges! Thus closely and cogently does the honorable gentleman reason on\r\nthe words of the Constitution. The gentleman says, if there be such a\r\npower of final decision in the general government, he asks for the grant\r\nof that power. Well, Sir, I show him the grant. I turn him to the very\r\nwords. I show him that the laws of Congress are made supreme; and that\r\nthe judicial power extends, by express words, to the interpretation of\r\nthese laws. Instead of answering this, he retreats into the general\r\nreflection, that it must result _from the nature of things_, that the\r\nStates, being parties, must judge for themselves.\r\n\r\nI have admitted, that, if the Constitution were to be considered as the\r\ncreature of the State governments, it might be modified, interpreted, or\r\nconstrued according to their pleasure. But, even in that case, it would\r\nbe necessary that they should _agree_. One alone could not interpret it\r\nconclusively; one alone could not construe it; one alone could not\r\nmodify it. Yet the gentleman's doctrine is, that Carolina alone may\r\nconstrue and interpret that compact which equally binds all, and gives\r\nequal rights to all.\r\n\r\nSo, then, Sir, even supposing the Constitution to be a compact between\r\nthe States, the gentleman's doctrine, nevertheless, is not maintainable;\r\nbecause, first, the general government is not a party to that compact,\r\nbut a _government_ established by it, and vested by it with the powers\r\nof trying and deciding doubtful questions; and secondly, because, if the\r\nConstitution be regarded as a compact, not one State only, but all the\r\nStates, are parties to that compact, and one can have no right to fix\r\nupon it her own peculiar construction.\r\n\r\nSo much, Sir, for the argument, even if the premises of the gentleman\r\nwere granted, or could be proved. But, Sir, the gentleman has failed to\r\nmaintain his leading proposition. He has not shown, it cannot be shown,\r\nthat the Constitution is a compact between State governments. The\r\nConstitution itself, in its very front, refutes that idea; it declares\r\nthat it is ordained and established _by the people of the United\r\nStates_. So far from saying that it is established by the governments of\r\nthe several States, it does not even say that it is established by the\r\npeople _of the several States_; but it pronounces that it is established\r\nby the people of the United States, in the aggregate. The gentleman\r\nsays, it must mean no more than the people of the several States.\r\nDoubtless, the people of the several States, taken collectively,\r\nconstitute the people of the United States; but it is in this, their\r\ncollective capacity, it is as all the people of the United States, that\r\nthey establish the Constitution. So they declare; and words cannot be\r\nplainer than the words used.\r\n\r\nWhen the gentleman says the Constitution is a compact between the\r\nStates, he uses language exactly applicable to the old Confederation. He\r\nspeaks as if he were in Congress before 1789. He describes fully that\r\nold state of things then existing. The Confederation was, in strictness,\r\na compact; the States, as States, were parties to it. We had no other\r\ngeneral government. But that was found insufficient, and inadequate to\r\nthe public exigencies. The people were not satisfied with it, and\r\nundertook to establish a better. They undertook to form a general\r\ngovernment, which should stand on a new basis; not a confederacy, not a\r\nleague, not a compact between States, but a _Constitution_; a popular\r\ngovernment, founded in popular election, directly responsible to the\r\npeople themselves, and divided into branches with prescribed limits of\r\npower, and prescribed duties. They ordained such a government, they gave\r\nit the name of a _Constitution_, and therein they established a\r\ndistribution of powers between this, their general government, and their\r\nseveral State governments. When they shall become dissatisfied with this\r\ndistribution, they can alter it. Their own power over their own\r\ninstrument remains. But until they shall alter it, it must stand as\r\ntheir will, and is equally binding on the general government and on the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman, Sir, finds analogy where I see none. He likens it to the\r\ncase of a treaty, in which, there being no common superior, each party\r\nmust interpret for itself, under its own obligation of good faith. But\r\nthis is not a treaty, but a constitution of government, with powers to\r\nexecute itself, and fulfil its duties.\r\n\r\nI admit, Sir, that this government is a government of checks and\r\nbalances; that is, the House of Representatives is a check on the\r\nSenate, and the Senate is a check on the House, and the President a\r\ncheck on both. But I cannot comprehend him, or, if I do, I totally\r\ndiffer from him, when he applies the notion of checks and balances to\r\nthe interference of different governments. He argues, that, if we\r\ntransgress our constitutional limits, each State, as a State, has a\r\nright to check us. Does he admit the converse of the proposition, that\r\nwe have a right to check the States? The gentleman's doctrines would\r\ngive us a strange jumble of authorities and powers, instead of\r\ngovernments of separate and defined powers. It is the part of wisdom, I\r\nthink, to avoid this; and to keep the general government and the State\r\ngovernment each in its proper sphere, avoiding as carefully as possible\r\nevery kind of interference.\r\n\r\nFinally, Sir, the honorable gentleman says, that the States will only\r\ninterfere, by their power, to preserve the Constitution. They will not\r\ndestroy it, they will not impair it; they will only save, they will only\r\npreserve, they will only strengthen it! Ah! Sir, this is but the old\r\nstory. All regulated governments, all free governments, have been broken\r\nby similar disinterested and well-disposed interference. It is the\r\ncommon pretence. But I take leave of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Sprague.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. Calhoun, when this speech was made, was President of\r\nthe Senate, and Vice-President of the United States.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mr. Forsyth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Mr. McDuffie.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The letter of the Federal Convention to the Congress of the\r\nConfederation transmitting the plan of the Constitution.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Mr. Hillhouse, of Connecticut.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION NOT A COMPACT BETWEEN SOVEREIGN STATES.\r\n\r\nA SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, ON THE 16TH OF\r\nFEBRUARY, 1833, IN REPLY TO MR. CALHOUN'S SPEECH ON THE BILL \"FURTHER TO\r\nPROVIDE FOR THE COLLECTION OF DUTIES ON IMPORTS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[On the 21st of January, 1833, Mr. Wilkins, chairman of the Judiciary\r\nCommittee of the Senate, introduced the bill further to provide for the\r\ncollection of duties. On the 22d day of the same month, Mr. Calhoun\r\nsubmitted the following resolutions:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the people of the several States composing these\r\n     United States are united as parties to a constitutional compact, to\r\n     which the people of each State acceded as a separate govereign\r\n     community, each binding itself by its own particular ratification;\r\n     and that the union, of which the said compact is the bond, is a\r\n     union _between the States_ ratifying the same.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the people of the several States thus united by\r\n     the constitutional compact, in forming that instrument, and in\r\n     creating a general government to carry into effect the objects for\r\n     which they were formed, delegated to that government, for that\r\n     purpose, certain definite powers, to be exercised jointly,\r\n     reserving, at the same time, each State to itself, the residuary\r\n     mass of powers, to be exercised by its own separate government; and\r\n     that whenever the general government assumes the exercise of powers\r\n     not delegated by the compact, its acts are unauthorized, and are of\r\n     no effect; and that the same government is not made the final judge\r\n     of the powers delegated to it, since that would make its\r\n     discretion, and not the Constitution, the measure of its powers;\r\n     but that, as in all other cases of compact among sovereign parties,\r\n     without any common judge, each has an equal right to judge for\r\n     itself, as well of the infraction as of the mode and measure of\r\n     redress.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the assertions, that the people of these United\r\n     States, taken collectively as individuals, are now, or ever have\r\n     been, united on the principle of the social compact, and, as such,\r\n     are now formed into one nation or people, or that they have ever\r\n     been so united in any one stage of their political existence; that\r\n     the people of the several States composing the Union have not, as\r\n     members thereof, retained their sovereignty; that the allegiance of\r\n     their citizens has been transferred to the general government; that\r\n     they have parted with the right of punishing treason through their\r\n     respective State governments; and that they have not the right of\r\n     judging in the last resort as to the extent of the powers reserved,\r\n     and of consequence of those delegated,--are not only without\r\n     foundation in truth, but are contrary to the most certain and plain\r\n     historical facts, and the clearest deductions of reason; and that\r\n     all exercise of power on the part of the general government, or any\r\n     of its departments, claiming authority from such erroneous\r\n     assumptions, must of necessity be unconstitutional,--must tend,\r\n     directly and inevitably, to subvert the sovereignty of the States,\r\n     to destroy the federal character of the Union, and to rear on its\r\n     ruins a consolidated government, without constitutional check or\r\n     limitation, and which must necessarily terminate in the loss of\r\n     liberty itself.\"\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 16th of February, Mr. Calhoun spoke in opposition to\r\nthe bill, and in support of these resolutions. He was followed by Mr.\r\nWebster in this speech.]\r\n\r\nMr. President,--The gentleman from South Carolina has admonished us to\r\nbe mindful of the opinions of those who shall come after us. We must\r\ntake our chance, Sir, as to the light in which posterity will regard us.\r\nI do not decline its judgment, nor withhold myself from its scrutiny.\r\nFeeling that I am performing my public duty with singleness of heart and\r\nto the best of my ability, I fearlessly trust myself to the country, now\r\nand hereafter, and leave both my motives and my character to its\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman has terminated his speech in a tone of threat and defiance\r\ntowards this bill, even should it become a law of the land, altogether\r\nunusual in the halls of Congress. But I shall not suffer myself to be\r\nexcited into warmth by his denunciation of the measure which I support.\r\nAmong the feelings which at this moment fill my breast, not the least\r\nis that of regret at the position in which the gentleman has placed\r\nhimself. Sir, he does himself no justice. The cause which he has\r\nespoused finds no basis in the Constitution, no succor from public\r\nsympathy, no cheering from a patriotic community. He has no foothold on\r\nwhich to stand while he might display the powers of his acknowledged\r\ntalents. Every thing beneath his feet is hollow and treacherous. He is\r\nlike a strong man struggling in a morass: every effort to extricate\r\nhimself only sinks him deeper and deeper. And I fear the resemblance may\r\nbe carried still farther; I fear that no friend can safely come to his\r\nrelief, that no one can approach near enough to hold out a helping hand,\r\nwithout danger of going down himself, also, into the bottomless depths\r\nof this Serbonian bog.\r\n\r\nThe honorable gentleman has declared, that on the decision of the\r\nquestion now in debate may depend the cause of liberty itself. I am of\r\nthe same opinion; but then, Sir, the liberty which I think is staked on\r\nthe contest is not political liberty, in any general and undefined\r\ncharacter, but our own well-understood and long-enjoyed _American_\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nSir, I love Liberty no less ardently than the gentleman himself, in\r\nwhatever form she may have appeared in the progress of human history. As\r\nexhibited in the master states of antiquity, as breaking out again from\r\namidst the darkness of the Middle Ages, and beaming on the formation of\r\nnew communities in modern Europe, she has, always and everywhere, charms\r\nfor me. Yet, Sir, it is our own liberty, guarded by constitutions and\r\nsecured by union, it is that liberty which is our paternal inheritance,\r\nit is our established, dear-bought, peculiar American liberty, to which\r\nI am chiefly devoted, and the cause of which I now mean, to the utmost\r\nof my power, to maintain and defend.\r\n\r\nMr. President, if I considered the constitutional question now before us\r\nas doubtful as it is important, and if I supposed that its decision,\r\neither in the Senate or by the country, was likely to be in any degree\r\ninfluenced by the manner in which I might now discuss it, this would be\r\nto me a moment of deep solicitude. Such a moment has once existed. There\r\nhas been a time, when, rising in this place, on the same question, I\r\nfelt, I must confess, that something for good or evil to the\r\nConstitution of the country might depend on an effort of mine. But\r\ncircumstances are changed. Since that day, Sir, the public opinion has\r\nbecome awakened to this great question; it has grasped it; it has\r\nreasoned upon it, as becomes an intelligent and patriotic community, and\r\nhas settled it, or now seems in the progress of settling it, by an\r\nauthority which none can disobey, the authority of the people\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nI shall not, Mr. President, follow the gentleman, step by step, through\r\nthe course of his speech. Much of what he has said he has deemed\r\nnecessary to the just explanation and defence of his own political\r\ncharacter and conduct. On this I shall offer no comment. Much, too, has\r\nconsisted of philosophical remark upon the general nature of political\r\nliberty, and the history of free institutions; and upon other topics, so\r\ngeneral in their nature as to possess, in my opinion, only a remote\r\nbearing on the immediate subject of this debate.\r\n\r\nBut the gentleman's speech made some days ago, upon introducing his\r\nresolutions, those resolutions themselves, and parts of the speech now\r\njust concluded, may, I presume, be justly regarded as containing the\r\nwhole South Carolina doctrine. That doctrine it is my purpose now to\r\nexamine, and to compare it with the Constitution of the United States. I\r\nshall not consent, Sir, to make any new constitution, or to establish\r\nanother form of government. I will not undertake to say what a\r\nconstitution for these United States ought to be. That question the\r\npeople have decided for themselves; and I shall take the instrument as\r\nthey have established it, and shall endeavor to maintain it, in its\r\nplain sense and meaning, against opinions and notions which, in my\r\njudgment, threaten its subversion.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions introduced by the gentleman were apparently drawn up\r\nwith care, and brought forward upon deliberation. I shall not be in\r\ndanger, therefore, of misunderstanding him, or those who agree with him,\r\nif I proceed at once to these resolutions, and consider them as an\r\nauthentic statement of those opinions upon the great constitutional\r\nquestion by which the recent proceedings in South Carolina are attempted\r\nto be justified.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions are three in number.\r\n\r\nThe third seems intended to enumerate, and to deny, the several opinions\r\nexpressed in the President's proclamation, respecting the nature and\r\npowers of this government. Of this third resolution, I purpose, at\r\npresent, to take no particular notice.\r\n\r\nThe first two resolutions of the honorable member affirm these\r\npropositions, viz.:--\r\n\r\n1. That the political system under which we live, and under which\r\nCongress is now assembled, is a _compact_, to which the people of the\r\nseveral States, as separate and sovereign communities, are _the\r\nparties_.\r\n\r\n2. That these sovereign parties have a right to judge, each for itself,\r\nof any alleged violation of the Constitution by Congress; and, in case\r\nof such violation, to choose, each for itself, its own mode and measure\r\nof redress.\r\n\r\nIt is true, Sir, that the honorable member calls this a \"constitutional\"\r\ncompact; but still he affirms it to be a compact between sovereign\r\nStates. What precise meaning, then, does he attach to the term\r\n_constitutional_? When applied to compacts between sovereign States, the\r\nterm _constitutional_ affixes to the word _compact_ no definite idea.\r\nWere we to hear of a constitutional league or treaty between England and\r\nFrance, or a constitutional convention between Austria and Russia, we\r\nshould not understand what could be intended by such a league, such a\r\ntreaty, or such a convention. In these connections, the word is void of\r\nall meaning; and yet, Sir, it is easy, quite easy, to see why the\r\nhonorable gentleman has used it in these resolutions. He cannot open the\r\nbook, and look upon our written frame of government, without seeing that\r\nit is called a _constitution_. This may well be appalling to him. It\r\nthreatens his whole doctrine of compact, and its darling derivatives,\r\nnullification and secession, with instant confutation. Because, if he\r\nadmits our instrument of government to be a _constitution_, then, for\r\nthat very reason, it is not a compact between sovereigns; a constitution\r\nof government and a compact between sovereign powers being things\r\nessentially unlike in their very natures, and incapable of ever being\r\nthe same. Yet the word _constitution_ is on the very front of the\r\ninstrument. He cannot overlook it. He seeks, therefore, to compromise\r\nthe matter, and to sink all the substantial sense of the word, while he\r\nretains a resemblance of its sound. He introduces a new word of his own,\r\nviz. _compact_, as importing the principal idea, and designed to play\r\nthe principal part, and degrades _constitution_ into an insignificant,\r\nidle epithet, attached to _compact_. The whole then stands as a\r\n\"_constitutional compact_\"! And in this way he hopes to pass off a\r\nplausible gloss, as satisfying the words of the instrument. But he will\r\nfind himself disappointed. Sir, I must say to the honorable gentleman,\r\nthat, in our American political grammar, CONSTITUTION is a noun\r\nsubstantive; it imports a distinct and clear idea of itself; and it is\r\nnot to lose its importance and dignity, it is not to be turned into a\r\npoor, ambiguous, senseless, unmeaning adjective, for the purpose of\r\naccommodating any new set of political notions. Sir, we reject his new\r\nrules of syntax altogether. We will not give up our forms of political\r\nspeech to the grammarians of the school of nullification. By the\r\nConstitution, we mean, not a \"constitutional compact,\" but, simply and\r\ndirectly, the Constitution, the fundamental law; and if there be one\r\nword in the language which the people of the United States understand,\r\nthis is that word. We know no more of a constitutional compact between\r\nsovereign powers, than we know of a _constitutional_ indenture of\r\ncopartnership, a _constitutional_ deed of conveyance, or a\r\n_constitutional_ bill of exchange. But we know what the _Constitution_\r\nis; we know what the plainly written fundamental law is; we know what\r\nthe bond of our Union and the security of our liberties is; and we mean\r\nto maintain and to defend it, in its plain sense and unsophisticated\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nThe sense of the gentleman's proposition, therefore, is not at all\r\naffected, one way or the other, by the use of this word. That\r\nproposition still is, that our system of government is but a _compact_\r\nbetween the people of separate and sovereign States.\r\n\r\nWas it Mirabeau, Mr. President, or some other master of the human\r\npassions, who has told us that words are things? They are indeed things,\r\nand things of mighty influence, not only in addresses to the passions\r\nand high-wrought feelings of mankind, but in the discussion of legal and\r\npolitical questions also; because a just conclusion is often avoided, or\r\na false one reached, by the adroit substitution of one phrase, or one\r\nword, for another. Of this we have, I think, another example in the\r\nresolutions before us.\r\n\r\nThe first resolution declares that the people of the several States\r\n\"_acceded_\" to the Constitution, or to the constitutional compact, as it\r\nis called. This word \"accede,\" not found either in the Constitution\r\nitself, or in the ratification of it by any one of the States, has been\r\nchosen for use here, doubtless, not without a well-considered purpose.\r\n\r\nThe natural converse of _accession_ is _secession_; and, therefore, when\r\nit is stated that the people of the States acceded to the Union, it may\r\nbe more plausibly argued that they may secede from it. If, in adopting\r\nthe Constitution, nothing was done but acceding to a compact, nothing\r\nwould seem necessary, in order to break it up, but to secede from the\r\nsame compact. But the term is wholly out of place. _Accession_, as a\r\nword applied to political associations, implies coming into a league,\r\ntreaty, or confederacy, by one hitherto a stranger to it; and\r\n_secession_ implies departing from such league or confederacy. The\r\npeople of the United States have used no such form of expression in\r\nestablishing the present government. They do not say that they _accede_\r\nto a league, but they declare that they _ordain_ and _establish_ a\r\nConstitution, Such are the very words of the instrument itself; and in\r\nall the States, without an exception, the language used by their\r\nconventions was, that they \"_ratified the Constitution_\"; some of them\r\nemploying the additional words \"assented to\" and \"adopted,\" but all of\r\nthem \"ratifying.\"\r\n\r\nThere is more importance than may, at first sight, appear, in the\r\nintroduction of this new word, by the honorable mover of these\r\nresolutions. Its adoption and use are indispensable to maintain those\r\npremises from which his main conclusion is to be afterwards drawn. But\r\nbefore showing that, allow me to remark, that this phraseology tends to\r\nkeep out of sight the just view of a previous political history, as well\r\nas to suggest wrong ideas as to what was actually done when the present\r\nConstitution was agreed to. In 1789, and before this Constitution was\r\nadopted, the United States had already been in a union, more or less\r\nclose, for fifteen years. At least as far back as the meeting of the\r\nfirst Congress, in 1774, they had been in some measure, and for some\r\nnational purposes, united together. Before the Confederation of 1781,\r\nthey had declared independence jointly, and had carried on the war\r\njointly, both by sea and land; and this not as separate States, but as\r\none people. When, therefore, they formed that Confederation, and adopted\r\nits articles as articles of perpetual union, they did not come together\r\nfor the first time; and therefore they did not speak of the States as\r\n_acceding_ to the Confederation, although it was a league, and nothing\r\nbut a league, and rested on nothing but plighted faith for its\r\nperformance. Yet, even then, the States were not strangers to each\r\nother; there was a bond of union already subsisting between them; they\r\nwere associated, united States; and the object of the Confederation was\r\nto make a stronger and better bond of union. Their representatives\r\ndeliberated together on these proposed Articles of Confederation, and,\r\nbeing authorized by their respective States, finally \"_ratified and\r\nconfirmed_\" them. Inasmuch as they were already in union, they did not\r\nspeak of _acceding_ to the new Articles of Confederation, but of\r\n_ratifying and confirming_ them; and this language was not used\r\ninadvertently, because, in the same instrument, _accession_ is used in\r\nits proper sense, when applied to Canada, which was altogether a\r\nstranger to the existing union. \"Canada,\" says the eleventh article,\r\n\"_acceding_ to this Confederation, and joining in the measures of the\r\nUnited States, shall be admitted into the Union.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus used the terms _ratify_ and _confirm_, even in regard to the\r\nold Confederation, it would have been strange indeed, if the people of\r\nthe United States, after its formation, and when they came to establish\r\nthe present Constitution, had spoken of the States, or the people of the\r\nStates, as _acceding_ to this Constitution. Such language would have\r\nbeen ill-suited to the occasion. It would have implied an existing\r\nseparation or disunion among the States, such as never has existed since\r\n1774. No such language, therefore, was used. The language actually\r\nemployed is, _adopt, ratify, ordain, establish_.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Sir, since any State, before she can prove her right to\r\ndissolve the Union, must show her authority to undo what has been done,\r\nno State is at liberty to _secede_, on the ground that she and other\r\nStates have done nothing but _accede_. She must show that she has a\r\nright to _reverse_ what has been _ordained_, to _unsettle_ and\r\n_overthrow_ what has been _established_, to _reject_ what the people\r\nhave _adopted_, and to _break up_ what they have _ratified_; because\r\nthese are the terms which express the transactions which have actually\r\ntaken place. In other words, she must show her right to make a\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIf, Mr. President, in drawing these resolutions, the honorable member\r\nhad confined himself to the use of constitutional language, there would\r\nhave been a wide and awful _hiatus_ between his premises and his\r\nconclusion. Leaving out the two words _compact_ and _accession_, which\r\nare not constitutional modes of expression, and stating the matter\r\nprecisely as the truth is, his first resolution would have affirmed that\r\n_the people of the several States ratified this Constitution, or form of\r\ngovernment_. These are the very words of South Carolina herself, in her\r\nact of ratification. Let, then, his first resolution tell the exact\r\ntruth; let it state the fact precisely as it exists; let it say that the\r\npeople of the several States ratified a constitution, or form of\r\ngovernment, and then, Sir, what will become of his inference in his\r\nsecond resolution, which is in these words, viz. \"that, as in all other\r\ncases of compact among sovereign parties, each has an equal right to\r\njudge for itself, as well of the infraction as of the mode and measure\r\nof redress\"? It is obvious, is it not, Sir? that this conclusion\r\nrequires for its support quite other premises; it requires premises\r\nwhich speak of _accession_ and of _compact_ between sovereign powers;\r\nand, without such premises, it is altogether unmeaning.\r\n\r\nMr. President, if the honorable member will truly state what the people\r\ndid in forming this Constitution, and then state what they must do if\r\nthey would now undo what they then did, he will unavoidably state a case\r\nof revolution. Let us see if it be not so. He must state, in the first\r\nplace, that the people of the several States adopted and ratified this\r\nConstitution, or form of government; and, in the next place, he must\r\nstate that they have a right to undo this; that is to say, that they\r\nhave a right to discard the form of government which they have adopted,\r\nand to break up the Constitution which they have ratified. Now, Sir,\r\nthis is neither more nor less than saying that they have a right to make\r\na revolution. To reject an established government, to break up a\r\npolitical constitution, is revolution.\r\n\r\nI deny that any man can state accurately what was done by the people, in\r\nestablishing the present Constitution, and then state accurately what\r\nthe people, or any part of them, must now do to get rid of its\r\nobligations, without stating an undeniable case of the overthrow of\r\ngovernment. I admit, of course, that the people may, if they choose,\r\noverthrow the government. But, then, that is revolution. The doctrine\r\nnow contended for is, that, by _nullification_, or _secession_, the\r\nobligations and authority of the government may be set aside or\r\nrejected, without revolution. But that is what I deny; and what I say\r\nis, that no man can state the case with historical accuracy, and in\r\nconstitutional language, without showing that the honorable gentleman's\r\nright, as asserted in his conclusion, is a revolutionary right merely;\r\nthat it does not and cannot exist under the Constitution, or agreeably\r\nto the Constitution, but can come into existence only when the\r\nConstitution is overthrown. This is the reason, Sir, which makes it\r\nnecessary to abandon the use of constitutional language for a new\r\nvocabulary, and to substitute, in the place of plain historical facts, a\r\nseries of assumptions. This is the reason why it is necessary to give\r\nnew names to things, to speak of the Constitution, not as a\r\nconstitution, but as a compact, and of the ratifications by the people,\r\nnot as ratifications, but as acts of accession.\r\n\r\nSir, I intend to hold the gentleman to the written record. In the\r\ndiscussion of a constitutional question, I intend to impose upon him the\r\nrestraints of constitutional language. The people have ordained a\r\nConstitution; can they reject it without revolution? They have\r\nestablished a form of government; can they overthrow it without\r\nrevolution? These are the true questions.\r\n\r\nAllow me now, Mr. President, to inquire further into the extent of the\r\npropositions contained in the resolutions, and their necessary\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nWhere sovereign communities are parties, there is no essential\r\ndifference between a compact, a confederation, and a league. They all\r\nequally rest on the plighted faith of the sovereign party. A league, or\r\nconfederacy, is but a subsisting or continuing treaty.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman's resolutions, then, affirm, in effect, that these\r\ntwenty-four United States are held together only by a subsisting treaty,\r\nresting for its fulfilment and continuance on no inherent power of its\r\nown, but on the plighted faith of each State; or, in other words, that\r\nour Union is but a league; and, as a consequence from this proposition,\r\nthey further affirm that, as sovereigns are subject to no superior\r\npower, the States must judge, each for itself, of any alleged violation\r\nof the league; and if such violation be supposed to have occurred, each\r\nmay adopt any mode or measure of redress which it shall think proper.\r\n\r\nOther consequences naturally follow, too, from the main proposition. If\r\na league between sovereign powers have no limitation as to the time of\r\nits duration, and contain nothing making it perpetual, it subsists only\r\nduring the good pleasure of the parties, although no violation be\r\ncomplained of. If, in the opinion of either party, it be violated, such\r\nparty may say that he will no longer fulfil its obligations on his part,\r\nbut will consider the whole league or compact at an end, although it\r\nmight be one of its stipulations that it should be perpetual. Upon this\r\nprinciple, the Congress of the United States, in 1798, declared null and\r\nvoid the treaty of alliance between the United States and France, though\r\nit professed to be a perpetual alliance.\r\n\r\nIf the violation of the league be accompanied with serious injuries, the\r\nsuffering party, being sole judge of his own mode and measure of\r\nredress, has a right to indemnify himself by reprisals on the offending\r\nmembers of the league; and reprisals, if the circumstances of the case\r\nrequire it, may be followed by direct, avowed, and public war.\r\n\r\nThe necessary import of the resolution, therefore, is, that the United\r\nStates are connected only by a league; that it is in the good pleasure\r\nof every State to decide how long she will choose to remain a member of\r\nthis league; that any State may determine the extent of her own\r\nobligations under it, and accept or reject what shall be decided by the\r\nwhole; that she may also determine whether her rights have been\r\nviolated, what is the extent of the injury done her, and what mode and\r\nmeasure of redress her wrongs may make it fit and expedient for her to\r\nadopt. The result of the whole is, that any State may secede at\r\npleasure; that any State may resist a law which she herself may choose\r\nto say exceeds the power of Congress; and that, as a sovereign power,\r\nshe may redress her own grievances, by her own arm, at her own\r\ndiscretion. She may make reprisals; she may cruise against the property\r\nof other members of the league; she may authorize captures, and make\r\nopen war.\r\n\r\nIf, Sir, this be our political condition, it is time the people of the\r\nUnited States understood it. Let us look for a moment to the practical\r\nconsequences of these opinions. One State, holding an embargo law\r\nunconstitutional, may declare her opinion, and withdraw from the Union.\r\n_She_ secedes. Another, forming and expressing the same judgment on a\r\nlaw laying duties on imports, may withdraw also. _She_ secedes. And as,\r\nin her opinion, money has been taken out of the pockets of her citizens\r\nillegally, under pretence of this law, and as she has power to redress\r\ntheir wrongs, she may demand satisfaction: and, if refused, she may take\r\nit with a strong hand. The gentleman has himself pronounced the\r\ncollection of duties, under existing laws, to be nothing but robbery.\r\nRobbers, of course, may be rightfully dispossessed of the fruits of\r\ntheir flagitious crimes; and therefore, reprisals, impositions on the\r\ncommerce of other States, foreign alliances against them, or open war,\r\nare all modes of redress justly open to the discretion and choice of\r\nSouth Carolina; for she is to judge of her own rights, and to seek\r\nsatisfaction for her own wrongs, in her own way.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, a _third_ State is of opinion, not only that these laws of\r\nimposts are constitutional, but that it is the absolute duty of Congress\r\nto pass and to maintain such laws; and that, by omitting to pass and\r\nmaintain them, its constitutional obligations would be grossly\r\ndisregarded. She herself relinquished the power of protection, she might\r\nallege, and allege truly, and gave it up to Congress, on the faith that\r\nCongress would exercise it. If Congress now refuse to exercise it,\r\nCongress does, as she may insist, break the condition of the grant, and\r\nthus manifestly violate the Constitution; and for this violation of the\r\nConstitution, _she_ may threaten to secede also. Virginia may secede,\r\nand hold the fortresses in the Chesapeake. The Western States may\r\nsecede, and take to their own use the public lands. Louisiana may\r\nsecede, if she choose, form a foreign alliance, and hold the mouth of\r\nthe Mississippi. If one State may secede, ten may do so, twenty may do\r\nso, twenty-three may do so. Sir, as these secessions go on, one after\r\nanother, what is to constitute the United States? Whose will be the\r\narmy? Whose the navy? Who will pay the debts? Who fulfil the public\r\ntreaties? Who perform the constitutional guaranties? Who govern this\r\nDistrict and the Territories? Who retain the public property?\r\n\r\nMr. President, every man must see that these are all questions which can\r\narise only _after a revolution_. They presuppose the breaking up of the\r\ngovernment. While the Constitution lasts, they are repressed; they\r\nspring up to annoy and startle us only from its grave.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution does not provide for events which must be preceded by\r\nits own destruction. SECESSION, therefore, since it must bring these\r\nconsequences with it, is REVOLUTIONARY, and NULLIFICATION is equally\r\nREVOLUTIONARY. What is revolution? Why, Sir, that is revolution which\r\noverturns, or controls, or successfully resists, the existing public\r\nauthority; that which arrests the exercise of the supreme power; that\r\nwhich introduces a new paramount authority into the rule of the State.\r\nNow, Sir, this is the precise object of nullification. It attempts to\r\nsupersede the supreme legislative authority. It arrests the arm of the\r\nexecutive magistrate. It interrupts the exercise of the accustomed\r\njudicial power. Under the name of an ordinance, it declares null and\r\nvoid, within the State, all the revenue laws of the United States. Is\r\nnot this revolutionary? Sir, so soon as this ordinance shall be carried\r\ninto effect, _a revolution_ will have commenced in South Carolina. She\r\nwill have thrown off the authority to which her citizens have heretofore\r\nbeen subject. She will have declared her own opinions and her own will\r\nto be above the laws and above the power of those who are intrusted with\r\ntheir administration. If she makes good these declarations, she is\r\nrevolutionized. As to her, it is as distinctly a change of the supreme\r\npower as the American Revolution of 1776. That revolution did not\r\nsubvert government in all its forms. It did not subvert local laws and\r\nmunicipal administrations. It only threw off the dominion of a power\r\nclaiming to be superior, and to have a right, in many important\r\nrespects, to exercise legislative authority. Thinking this authority to\r\nhave been usurped or abused, the American Colonies, now the United\r\nStates, bade it defiance, and freed themselves from it by means of a\r\nrevolution. But that revolution left them with their own municipal laws\r\nstill, and the forms of local government. If Carolina now shall\r\neffectually resist the laws of Congress; if she shall be her own judge,\r\ntake her remedy into her own hands, obey the laws of the Union when she\r\npleases and disobey them when she pleases, she will relieve herself from\r\na paramount power as distinctly as the American Colonies did the same\r\nthing in 1776. In other words, she will achieve, as to herself, a\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, while practical nullification in South Carolina would be, as\r\nto herself, actual and distinct revolution, its necessary tendency must\r\nalso be to spread revolution, and to break up the Constitution, as to\r\nall the other States. It strikes a deadly blow at the vital principle of\r\nthe whole Union. To allow State resistance to the laws of Congress to be\r\nrightful and proper, to admit nullification in some States, and yet not\r\nexpect to see a dismemberment of the entire government, appears to me\r\nthe wildest illusion, and the most extravagant folly. The gentleman\r\nseems not conscious of the direction or the rapidity of his own course.\r\nThe current of his opinions sweeps him along, he knows not whither. To\r\nbegin with nullification, with the avowed intent, nevertheless, not to\r\nproceed to secession, dismemberment, and general revolution, is as if\r\none were to take the plunge of Niagara, and cry out that he would stop\r\nhalf-way down. In the one case, as in the other, the rash adventurer\r\nmust go to the bottom of the dark abyss below, were it not that that\r\nabyss has no discovered bottom.\r\n\r\nNullification, if successful, arrests the power of the law, absolves\r\ncitizens from their duty, subverts the foundation both of protection and\r\nobedience, dispenses with oaths and obligations of allegiance, and\r\nelevates another authority to supreme command. Is not this revolution?\r\nAnd it raises to supreme command four-and-twenty distinct powers, each\r\nprofessing to be under a general government, and yet each setting its\r\nlaws at defiance at pleasure. Is not this anarchy, as well as\r\nrevolution? Sir, the Constitution of the United States was received as a\r\nwhole, and for the whole country. If it cannot stand altogether, it\r\ncannot stand in parts; and if the laws cannot be executed everywhere,\r\nthey cannot long be executed anywhere. The gentleman very well knows\r\nthat all duties and imposts must be uniform throughout the country. He\r\nknows that we cannot have one rule or one law for South Carolina, and\r\nanother for other States. He must see, therefore, and does see, and\r\nevery man sees, that the only alternative is a repeal of the laws\r\nthroughout the whole Union, or their execution in Carolina as well as\r\nelsewhere. And this repeal is demanded because a single State interposes\r\nher veto, and threatens resistance! The result of the gentleman's\r\nopinion, or rather the very text of his doctrine, is, that no act of\r\nCongress can bind all the States, the constitutionality of which is not\r\nadmitted by all; or, in other words, that no single State is bound,\r\nagainst its own dissent, by a law of imposts. This is precisely the evil\r\nexperienced under the old Confederation, and for remedy of which this\r\nConstitution was adopted. The leading object in establishing this\r\ngovernment, an object forced on the country by the condition of the\r\ntimes and the absolute necessity of the law, was to give to Congress\r\npower to lay and collect imposts _without the consent of particular\r\nStates_. The Revolutionary debt remained unpaid; the national treasury\r\nwas bankrupt; the country was destitute of credit; Congress issued its\r\nrequisitions on the States, and the States neglected them; there was no\r\npower of coercion but war, Congress could not lay imposts, or other\r\ntaxes, by its own authority; the whole general government, therefore,\r\nwas little more than a name. The Articles of Confederation, as to\r\npurposes of revenue and finance, were nearly a dead letter. The country\r\nsought to escape from this condition, at once feeble and disgraceful, by\r\nconstituting a government which should have power, of itself, to lay\r\nduties and taxes, and to pay the public debt, and provide for the\r\ngeneral welfare; and to lay these duties and taxes in all the States,\r\nwithout asking the consent of the State governments. This was the very\r\npower on which the new Constitution was to depend for all its ability to\r\ndo good; and without it, it can be no government, now or at any time.\r\nYet, Sir, it is precisely against this power, so absolutely\r\nindispensable to the very being of the government, that South Carolina\r\ndirects her ordinance. She attacks the government in its authority to\r\nraise revenue, the very main-spring of the whole system; and if she\r\nsucceed, every movement of that system must inevitably cease. It is of\r\nno avail that she declares that she does not resist the law as a revenue\r\nlaw, but as a law for protecting manufactures. It is a revenue law; it\r\nis the very law by force of which the revenue is collected; if it be\r\narrested in any State, the revenue ceases in that State; it is, in a\r\nword, the sole reliance of the government for the means of maintaining\r\nitself and performing its duties.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the alleged right of a State to decide constitutional\r\nquestions for herself necessarily leads to force, because other States\r\nmust have the same right, and because different States will decide\r\ndifferently; and when these questions arise between States, if there be\r\nno superior power, they can be decided only by the law of force. On\r\nentering into the Union, the people of each State gave up a part of\r\ntheir own power to make laws for themselves, in consideration, that, as\r\nto common objects, they should have a part in making laws for other\r\nStates. In other words, the people of all the States agreed to create a\r\ncommon government, to be conducted by common counsels. Pennsylvania, for\r\nexample, yielded the right of laying imposts in her own ports, in\r\nconsideration that the new government, in which she was to have a share,\r\nshould possess the power of laying imposts on all the States. If South\r\nCarolina now refuses to submit to this power, she breaks the condition\r\non which other States entered into the Union. She partakes of the common\r\ncounsels, and therein assists to bind others, while she refuses to be\r\nbound herself. It makes no difference in the case, whether she does all\r\nthis without reason or pretext, or whether she sets up as a reason,\r\nthat, in her judgment, the acts complained of are unconstitutional. In\r\nthe judgment of other States, they are not so. It is nothing to them\r\nthat she offers some reason or some apology for her conduct, if it be\r\none which they do not admit. It is not to be expected that any State\r\nwill violate her duty without some plausible pretext. That would be too\r\nrash a defiance of the opinion of mankind. But if it be a pretext which\r\nlies in her own breast, if it be no more than an opinion which she says\r\nshe has formed, how can other States be satisfied with this? How can\r\nthey allow her to be judge of her own obligations? Or, if she may judge\r\nof her obligations, may they not judge of their rights also? May not the\r\ntwenty-three entertain an opinion as well as the twenty-fourth? And if\r\nit be their right, in their own opinion, as expressed in the common\r\ncouncil, to enforce the law against her, how is she to say that her\r\nright and her opinion are to be every thing, and their right and their\r\nopinion nothing?\r\n\r\nMr. President, if we are to receive the Constitution as the text, and\r\nthen to lay down in its margin the contradictory commentaries which have\r\nbeen, and which maybe, made by different States, the whole page would be\r\na polyglot indeed. It would speak with as many tongues as the builders\r\nof Babel, and in dialects as much confused, and mutually as\r\nunintelligible. The very instance now before us presents a practical\r\nillustration. The law of the last session is declared unconstitutional\r\nin South Carolina, and obedience to it is refused. In other States, it\r\nis admitted to be strictly constitutional. You walk over the limit of\r\nits authority, therefore, when you pass a State line. On one side it is\r\nlaw, on the other side a nullity; and yet it is passed by a common\r\ngovernment, having the same authority in all the States.\r\n\r\nSuch, Sir, are the inevitable results of this doctrine. Beginning with\r\nthe original error, that the Constitution of the United States is\r\nnothing but a compact between sovereign States; asserting, in the next\r\nstep, that each State has a right to be its own sole judge of the extent\r\nof its own obligations, and consequently of the constitutionality of\r\nlaws of Congress; and, in the next, that it may oppose whatever it sees\r\nfit to declare unconstitutional, and that it decides for itself on the\r\nmode and measure of redress,--the argument arrives at once at the\r\nconclusion, that what a State dissents from, it may nullify; what it\r\nopposes, it may oppose by force; what it decides for itself, it may\r\nexecute by its own power; and that, in short, it is itself supreme over\r\nthe legislation of Congress, and supreme over the decisions of the\r\nnational judicature; supreme over the constitution of the country,\r\nsupreme over the supreme law of the land. However it seeks to protect\r\nitself against these plain inferences, by saying that an\r\nunconstitutional law is no law, and that it only opposes such laws as\r\nare unconstitutional, yet this does not in the slightest degree vary the\r\nresult; since it insists on deciding this question for itself; and, in\r\nopposition to reason and argument, in opposition to practice and\r\nexperience, in opposition to the judgment of others, having an equal\r\nright to judge, it says, only, \"Such is my opinion, and my opinion shall\r\nbe my law, and I will support it by my own strong hand. I denounce the\r\nlaw; I declare it unconstitutional; that is enough; it shall not be\r\nexecuted. Men in arms are ready to resist its execution. An attempt to\r\nenforce it shall cover the land with blood. Elsewhere it may be binding;\r\nbut here it is trampled underfoot.\"\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is practical nullification.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, against all these theories and opinions, I maintain,--\r\n\r\n1. That the Constitution of the United States is not a league,\r\nconfederacy, or compact between the people of the several States in\r\ntheir sovereign capacities; but a government proper, founded on the\r\nadoption of the people, and creating direct relations between itself and\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\n2. That no State authority has power to dissolve these relations; that\r\nnothing can dissolve them but revolution; and that, consequently, there\r\ncan be no such thing as secession without revolution.\r\n\r\n3. That there is a supreme law, consisting of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, and acts of Congress passed in pursuance of it, and\r\ntreaties; and that, in cases not capable of assuming the character of a\r\nsuit in law or equity, Congress must judge of, and finally interpret,\r\nthis supreme law so often as it has occasion to pass acts of\r\nlegislation; and in cases capable of assuming, and actually assuming,\r\nthe character of a suit, the Supreme Court of the United States is the\r\nfinal interpreter.\r\n\r\n4. That an attempt by a State to abrogate, annul, or nullify an act of\r\nCongress, or to arrest its operation within her limits, on the ground\r\nthat, in her opinion, such law is unconstitutional, is a direct\r\nusurpation on the just powers of the general government, and on the\r\nequal rights of other States; a plain violation of the Constitution, and\r\na proceeding essentially revolutionary in its character and tendency.\r\n\r\nWhether the Constitution be a compact between States in their sovereign\r\ncapacities, is a question which must be mainly argued from what is\r\ncontained in the instrument itself. We all agree that it is an\r\ninstrument which has been in some way clothed with power. We all admit\r\nthat it speaks with authority. The first question then is, What does it\r\nsay of itself? What does it purport to be? Does it style itself a\r\nleague, confederacy, or compact between sovereign States? It is to be\r\nremembered, Sir, that the Constitution began to speak only after its\r\nadoption. Until it was ratified by nine States, it was but a proposal,\r\nthe mere draught of an instrument. It was like a deed drawn, but not\r\nexecuted. The Convention had framed it; sent it to Congress, then\r\nsitting under the Confederation; Congress had transmitted it to the\r\nState legislatures; and by these last it was laid before conventions of\r\nthe people in the several States. All this while it was inoperative\r\npaper. It had received no stamp of authority, no sanction; it spoke no\r\nlanguage. But when ratified by the people in their respective\r\nconventions, then it had a voice, and spoke authentically. Every word in\r\nit had then received the sanction of the popular will, and was to be\r\nreceived as the expression of that will. What the Constitution says of\r\nitself, therefore, is as conclusive as what it says on any other point.\r\nDoes it call itself a \"compact\"? Certainly not. It uses the word\r\n_compact_ but once, and that is when it declares that the States shall\r\nenter into no compact. Does it call itself a \"league,\" a \"confederacy,\"\r\na \"subsisting treaty between the States\"? Certainly not. There is not a\r\nparticle of such language in all its pages. But it declares itself a\r\nCONSTITUTION. What is a _constitution_? Certainly not a league, compact,\r\nor confederacy, but _a fundamental law_. That fundamental regulation\r\nwhich determines the manner in which the public authority is to be\r\nexecuted, is what forms the _constitution_ of a state. Those primary\r\nrules which concern the body itself, and the very being of the political\r\nsociety, the form of government, and the manner in which power is to be\r\nexercised,--all, in a word, which form together the _constitution of a\r\nstate_,--these are the fundamental laws. This, Sir, is the language of\r\nthe public writers. But do we need to be informed, in this country, what\r\na _constitution_ is? Is it not an idea perfectly familiar, definite, and\r\nwell settled? We are at no loss to understand what is meant by the\r\nconstitution of one of the States; and the Constitution of the United\r\nStates speaks of itself as being an instrument of the same nature. It\r\nsays this _Constitution_ shall be the law of the land, any thing in any\r\nState _constitution_ to the contrary notwithstanding. And it speaks of\r\nitself, too, in plain contradistinction from a confederation; for it\r\nsays that all debts contracted, and all engagements entered into, by the\r\nUnited States, shall be as valid under this _Constitution_ as under the\r\n_Confederation_. It does not say, as valid under this _compact_, or this\r\nleague, or this confederation, as under the former confederation, but as\r\nvalid under this _Constitution_.\r\n\r\nThis, then, Sir, is declared to be a _constitution_. A constitution is\r\nthe fundamental law of the state; and this is expressly declared to be\r\nthe supreme law. It is as if the people had said, \"We prescribe this\r\nfundamental law,\" or \"this supreme law,\" for they do say that they\r\nestablish this Constitution, and that it shall be the supreme law. They\r\nsay that they _ordain and establish_ it. Now, Sir, what is the common\r\napplication of these words? We do not speak of _ordaining_ leagues and\r\ncompacts. If this was intended to be a compact or league, and the States\r\nto be parties to it, why was it not so said? Why is there found no one\r\nexpression in the whole instrument indicating such intent? The old\r\nConfederation was expressly called a _league_, and into this league it\r\nwas declared that the States, as States, severally entered. Why was not\r\nsimilar language used in the Constitution, if a similar intention had\r\nexisted? Why was it not said, \"the States enter into this new league,\"\r\n\"the States form this new confederation,\" or \"the States agree to this\r\nnew compact\"? Or why was it not said, in the language of the gentleman's\r\nresolution, that the people of the several States acceded to this\r\ncompact in their sovereign capacities? What reason is there for\r\nsupposing that the framers of the Constitution rejected expressions\r\nappropriate to their own meaning, and adopted others wholly at war with\r\nthat meaning?\r\n\r\nAgain, Sir, the Constitution speaks of that political system which is\r\nestablished as \"the government of the United States.\" Is it not doing\r\nstrange violence to language to call a league or a compact between\r\nsovereign powers a _government_? The government of a state is that\r\norganization in which the political power resides. It is the political\r\nbeing created by the constitution or fundamental law. The broad and\r\nclear difference between a government and a league or compact is, that a\r\ngovernment is a body politic; it has a will of its own; and it possesses\r\npowers and faculties to execute its own purposes. Every compact looks to\r\nsome power to enforce its stipulations. Even in a compact between\r\nsovereign communities, there always exists this ultimate reference to a\r\npower to insure its execution; although, in such case, this power is but\r\nthe force of one party against the force of another; that is to say, the\r\npower of war. But a _government_ executes its decisions by its own\r\nsupreme authority. Its use of force in compelling obedience to its own\r\nenactments is not war. It contemplates no opposing party having a right\r\nof resistance. It rests on its own power to enforce its own will; and\r\nwhen it ceases to possess this power, it is no longer a government.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I concur so generally in the very able speech of the\r\ngentleman from Virginia near me,[1] that it is not without diffidence\r\nand regret that I venture to differ with him on any point. His opinions,\r\nSir, are redolent of the doctrines of a very distinguished school, for\r\nwhich I have the highest regard, of whose doctrines I can say, what I\r\ncan also say of the gentleman's speech, that, while I concur in the\r\nresults, I must be permitted to hesitate about some of the premises. I\r\ndo not agree that the Constitution is a compact between States in their\r\nsovereign capacities. I do not agree, that, in strictness of language,\r\nit is a compact at all. But I do agree that it is founded on consent or\r\nagreement, or on compact, if the gentleman prefers that word, and means\r\nno more by it than voluntary consent or agreement. The Constitution,\r\nSir, is not a contract, but the result of a contract; meaning by\r\ncontract no more than assent. Founded on consent, it is a government\r\nproper. Adopted by the agreement of the people of the United States,\r\nwhen adopted, it has become a Constitution. The people have agreed to\r\nmake a Constitution; but when made, that Constitution becomes what its\r\nname imports. It is no longer a mere agreement. Our laws, Sir, have\r\ntheir foundation in the agreement or consent of the two houses of\r\nCongress. We say, habitually, that one house proposes a bill, and the\r\nother agrees to it; but the result of this agreement is not a compact,\r\nbut a law. The law, the statute, is not the agreement, but something\r\ncreated by the agreement; and something which, when created, has a new\r\ncharacter, and acts by its own authority. So the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, founded in or on the consent of the people, may be said\r\nto rest on compact or consent; but it is not itself the compact, but its\r\nresult. When the people agree to erect a government, and actually erect\r\nit, the thing is done, and the agreement is at an end. The compact is\r\nexecuted, and the end designed by it attained. Henceforth, the fruit of\r\nthe agreement exists, but the agreement itself is merged in its own\r\naccomplishment; since there can be no longer a subsisting agreement or\r\ncompact _to form_ a constitution or government, after that constitution\r\nor government has been actually formed and established.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me, Mr. President, that the plainest account of the\r\nestablishment of this government presents the most just and\r\nphilosophical view of its foundation. The people of the several States\r\nhad their separate State governments; and between the States there also\r\nexisted a Confederation. With this condition of things the people were\r\nnot satisfied, as the Confederation had been found not to fulfil its\r\nintended objects. It was _proposed_, therefore, to erect a new, common\r\ngovernment, which should possess certain definite powers, such as\r\nregarded the prosperity of the people of all the States, and to be\r\nformed upon the general model of American constitutions. This proposal\r\nwas assented to, and an instrument was presented to the people of the\r\nseveral States for their consideration. They approved it, and agreed to\r\nadopt it, as a Constitution. They executed that agreement; they adopted\r\nthe Constitution as a Constitution, and henceforth it must stand as a\r\nConstitution until it shall be altogether destroyed. Now, Sir, is not\r\nthis the truth of the whole matter? And is not all that we have heard of\r\ncompact between sovereign States the mere effect of a theoretical and\r\nartificial mode of reasoning upon the subject? a mode of reasoning which\r\ndisregards plain facts for the sake of hypothesis?\r\n\r\nMr. President, the nature of sovereignty or sovereign power has been\r\nextensively discussed by gentlemen on this occasion, as it generally is\r\nwhen the origin of our government is debated. But I confess myself not\r\nentirely satisfied with arguments and illustrations drawn from that\r\ntopic. The sovereignty of government is an idea belonging to the other\r\nside of the Atlantic. No such thing is known in North America. Our\r\ngovernments are all limited. In Europe, sovereignty is of feudal origin,\r\nand imports no more than the state of the sovereign. It comprises his\r\nrights, duties, exemptions, prerogatives, and powers. But with us, all\r\npower is with the people. They alone are sovereign; and they erect what\r\ngovernments they please, and confer on them such powers as they please.\r\nNone of these governments is sovereign, in the European sense of the\r\nword, all being restrained by written constitutions. It seems to me,\r\ntherefore, that we only perplex ourselves when we attempt to explain the\r\nrelations existing between the general government and the several State\r\ngovernments, according to those ideas of sovereignty which prevail under\r\nsystems essentially different from our own.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, to return to the Constitution itself; let me inquire what it\r\nrelies upon for its own continuance and support. I hear it often\r\nsuggested, that the States, by refusing to appoint Senators and\r\nElectors, might bring this government to an end. Perhaps that is true;\r\nbut the same may be said of the State governments themselves. Suppose\r\nthe legislature of a State, having the power to appoint the governor and\r\nthe judges, should omit that duty, would not the State government remain\r\nunorganized? No doubt, all elective governments may be broken up by a\r\ngeneral abandonment, on the part of those intrusted with political\r\npowers, of their appropriate duties. But one popular government has, in\r\nthis respect, as much security as another. The maintenance of this\r\nConstitution does not depend on the plighted faith of the States, as\r\nStates, to support it; and this again shows that it is not a league. It\r\nrelies on individual duty and obligation.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States creates direct relations between\r\nthis government and individuals. This government may punish individuals\r\nfor treason, and all other crimes in the code, when committed against\r\nthe United States. It has power, also, to tax individuals, in any mode,\r\nand to any extent; and it possesses the further power of demanding from\r\nindividuals military service. Nothing, certainly, can more clearly\r\ndistinguish a government from a confederation of states than the\r\npossession of these powers. No closer relations can exist between\r\nindividuals and any government.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the government owes high and solemn duties to every\r\ncitizen of the country. It is bound to protect him in his most important\r\nrights and interests. It makes war for his protection, and no other\r\ngovernment in the country can make war. It makes peace for his\r\nprotection, and no other government can make peace. It maintains armies\r\nand navies for his defence and security, and no other government is\r\nallowed to maintain them. He goes abroad beneath its flag, and carries\r\nover all the earth a rational character imparted to him by this\r\ngovernment, and which no other government can impart. In whatever\r\nrelates to war, to peace, to commerce, he knows no other government. All\r\nthese, Sir, are connections as dear and as sacred as can bind\r\nindividuals to any government on earth. It is not, therefore, a compact\r\nbetween States, but a government proper, operating directly upon\r\nindividuals, yielding to them protection on the one hand, and demanding\r\nfrom them obedience on the other.\r\n\r\nThere is no language in the whole Constitution applicable to a\r\nconfederation of States. If the States be parties, as States, what are\r\ntheir rights, and what their respective covenants and stipulations? And\r\nwhere are their rights, covenants, and stipulations expressed? The\r\nStates engage for nothing, they promise nothing. In the Articles of\r\nConfederation, they did make promises, and did enter into engagements,\r\nand did plight the faith of each State for their fulfilment; but in the\r\nConstitution there is nothing of that kind. The reason is, that, in the\r\nConstitution, it is the _people_ who speak, and not the States. The\r\npeople ordain the Constitution, and therein address themselves to the\r\nStates, and to the legislatures of the States, in the language of\r\ninjunction and prohibition. The Constitution utters its behests in the\r\nname and by authority of the people, and it does not exact from States\r\nany plighted public faith to maintain it. On the contrary, it makes its\r\nown preservation depend on individual duty and individual obligation.\r\nSir, the States cannot omit to appoint Senators and Electors. It is not\r\na matter resting in State discretion or State pleasure. The Constitution\r\nhas taken better care of its own preservation. It lays its hand on\r\nindividual conscience and individual duty. It incapacitates any man to\r\nsit in the legislature of a State, who shall not first have taken his\r\nsolemn oath to support the Constitution of the United States. From the\r\nobligation of this oath, no State power can discharge him. All the\r\nmembers of all the State legislatures are as religiously bound to\r\nsupport the Constitution of the United States as they are to support\r\ntheir own State constitution. Nay, Sir, they are as solemnly sworn to\r\nsupport it as we ourselves are, who are members of Congress.\r\n\r\nNo member of a State legislature can refuse to proceed, at the proper\r\ntime, to elect Senators to Congress, or to provide for the choice of\r\nElectors of President and Vice-President, any more than the members of\r\nthis Senate can refuse, when the appointed day arrives, to meet the\r\nmembers of the other house, to count the votes for those officers, and\r\nascertain who are chosen. In both cases, the duty binds, and with equal\r\nstrength, the conscience of the individual member, and it is imposed on\r\nall by an oath in the same words. Let it then never be said, Sir, that\r\nit is a matter of discretion with the States whether they will continue\r\nthe government, or break it up by refusing to appoint Senators and to\r\nelect Electors. They have no discretion in the matter. The members of\r\ntheir legislatures cannot avoid doing either, so often as the time\r\narrives, without a direct violation of their duty and their oaths; such\r\na violation as would break up any other government.\r\n\r\nLooking still further to the provisions of the Constitution itself, in\r\norder to learn its true character, we find its great apparent purpose\r\nto be, to unite the people of all the States under one general\r\ngovernment, for certain definite objects, and, to the extent of this\r\nunion, to restrain the separate authority of the States. Congress only\r\ncan declare war; therefore, when one State is at war with a foreign\r\nnation, all must be at war. The President and the Senate only can make\r\npeace; when peace is made for one State, therefore, it must be made for\r\nall.\r\n\r\nCan any thing be conceived more preposterous, than that any State should\r\nhave power to nullify the proceedings of the general government\r\nrespecting peace and war? When war is declared by a law of Congress, can\r\na single State nullify that law, and remain at peace? And yet she may\r\nnullify that law as well as any other. If the President and Senate make\r\npeace, may one State, nevertheless, continue the war? And yet, if she\r\ncan nullify a law, she may quite as well nullify a treaty.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, Mr. President, and no ingenuity of argument, no subtilty\r\nof distinction can evade it, that, as to certain purposes, the people of\r\nthe United States are one people. They are one in making war, and one in\r\nmaking peace; they are one in regulating commerce, and one in laying\r\nduties of imposts. The very end and purpose of the Constitution was, to\r\nmake them one people in these particulars; and it has effectually\r\naccomplished its object. All this is apparent on the face of the\r\nConstitution itself. I have already said, Sir, that to obtain a power of\r\ndirect legislation over the people, especially in regard to imposts, was\r\nalways prominent as a reason for getting rid of the Confederation, and\r\nforming a new Constitution. Among innumerable proofs of this, before the\r\nassembling of the Convention, allow me to refer only to the report of\r\nthe committee of the old Congress, July, 1785.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, let us go to the actual formation of the Constitution; let us\r\nopen the journal of the Convention itself, and we shall see that the\r\nvery first resolution which the Convention adopted was, \"THAT A NATIONAL\r\nGOVERNMENT OUGHT TO BE ESTABLISHED, CONSISTING OF A SUPREME LEGISLATURE,\r\nJUDICIARY, AND EXECUTIVE.\"\r\n\r\nThis itself completely negatives all idea of league, and compact, and\r\nconfederation. Terms could not be chosen more fit to express an\r\nintention to establish a national government, and to banish for ever all\r\nnotion of a compact between sovereign States.\r\n\r\nThis resolution was adopted on the 30th of May, 1787. Afterwards, the\r\nstyle was altered, and, instead of being called a national government,\r\nit was called the government of the United States; but the substance of\r\nthis resolution was retained, and was at tha head of that list of\r\nresolutions which was afterwards sent to the committee who were to frame\r\nthe instrument.\r\n\r\nIt is true, there were gentlemen in the Convention, who were for\r\nretaining the Confederation, and amending its Articles; but the majority\r\nwas against this, and was for a national government. Mr. Patterson's\r\npropositions, which were for continuing the Articles of Confederation\r\nwith additional powers, were submitted to the Convention on the 15th of\r\nJune, and referred to the committee of the whole. The resolutions\r\nforming the basis of a national government, which had once been agreed\r\nto in the committee of the whole, and reported, were recommitted to the\r\nsame committee, on the same day. The Convention, then, in committee of\r\nthe whole, on the 19th of June, had both these plans before them; that\r\nis to say, the plan of a confederacy, or compact, between States, and\r\nthe plan of a national government. Both these plans were considered and\r\ndebated, and the committee reported, \"That they do not agree to the\r\npropositions offered by the honorable Mr. Patterson, but that they again\r\nsubmit the resolutions formerly reported.\" If, Sir, any historical fact\r\nin the world be plain and undeniable, it is that the Convention\r\ndeliberated on the expediency of continuing the Confederation, with some\r\namendments, and rejected that scheme, and adopted the plan of a\r\nnational government, with a legislature, an executive, and a judiciary\r\nof its own. They were asked to preserve the league; they rejected the\r\nproposition. They were asked to continue the existing compact between\r\nStates; they rejected it. They rejected compact, league, and\r\nconfederation, and set themselves about framing the constitution of a\r\nnational government; and they accomplished what they undertook.\r\n\r\nIf men will open their eyes fairly to the lights of history, it is\r\nimpossible to be deceived on this point. The great object was to\r\nsupersede the Confederation by a regular government; because, under the\r\nConfederation, Congress had power only to make requisitions on States;\r\nand if States declined compliance, as they did, there was no remedy but\r\nwar against such delinquent States. It would seem, from Mr. Jefferson's\r\ncorrespondence, in 1786 and 1787, that he was of opinion that even this\r\nremedy ought to be tried. \"There will be no money in the treasury,\" said\r\nhe, \"till the confederacy shows its teeth\"; and he suggests that a\r\nsingle frigate would soon levy, on the commerce of a delinquent State,\r\nthe deficiency of its contribution. But this would be war; and it was\r\nevident that a confederacy could not long hold together, which should be\r\nat war with its members. The Constitution was adopted to avoid this\r\nnecessity. It was adopted that there might be a government which should\r\nact directly on individuals, without borrowing aid from the State\r\ngovernments. This is clear as light itself on the very face of the\r\nprovisions of the Constitution, and its whole history tends to the same\r\nconclusion. Its framers gave this very reason for their work in the most\r\ndistinct terms. Allow me to quote but one or two proofs, out of\r\nhundreds. That State, so small in territory, but so distinguished for\r\nlearning and talent, Connecticut, had sent to the general Convention,\r\namong other members, Samuel Johnston and Oliver Ellsworth. The\r\nConstitution having been framed, it was submitted to a convention of the\r\npeople of Connecticut for ratification on the part of that State; and\r\nMr. Johnston and Mr. Ellsworth were also members of this convention. On\r\nthe first day of the debates, being called on to explain the reasons\r\nwhich led the Convention at Philadelphia to recommend such a\r\nConstitution, after showing the insufficiency of the existing\r\nconfederacy, inasmuch as it applied to States, as States, Mr. Johnston\r\nproceeded to say:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Convention saw this imperfection in attempting to legislate\r\n     for States in their political capacity, that the coercion of law\r\n     can he exercised by nothing but a military force. They have,\r\n     therefore, gone upon entirely new ground. They have formed one new\r\n     nation out of the individual States. The Constitution vests in the\r\n     general legislature a power to make laws in matters of national\r\n     concern; to appoint judges to decide upon these laws; and to\r\n     appoint officers to carry them into execution. This excludes the\r\n     idea of an armed force. The power which is to enforce these laws is\r\n     to be a legal power, vested in proper magistrates. The force which\r\n     is to be employed is the energy of law; and this force is to\r\n     operate only upon individuals who fail in their duty to their\r\n     country. This is the peculiar glory of the Constitution, that it\r\n     depends upon the mild and equal energy of the magistracy for the\r\n     execution of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nIn the further course of the debate, Mr. Ellsworth said:--\r\n\r\n     \"In republics it is a fundamental principle, that the majority\r\n     govern, and that the minority comply with the general voice. How\r\n     contrary, then, to republican principles, how humiliating, is our\r\n     present situation! A single State can rise up, and put a _veto_\r\n     upon the most important public measures. We have seen this actually\r\n     take place; a single State has controlled the general voice of the\r\n     Union; a minority, a very small minority, has governed us. So far\r\n     is this from being consistent with republican principles, that it\r\n     is, in effect, the worst species of monarchy.\r\n\r\n     \"Hence we see how necessary for the Union is a coercive principle.\r\n     No man pretends the contrary. We all see and feel this necessity.\r\n     The only question is, Shall it be a coercion of law, or a coercion\r\n     of arms? There is no other possible alternative. Where will those\r\n     who oppose a coercion of law come out? Where will they end? A\r\n     necessary consequence of their principles is a war of the States\r\n     one against another. I am for coercion by law; that coercion which\r\n     acts only upon delinquent individuals. This Constitution does not\r\n     attempt to coerce sovereign bodies, States, in their political\r\n     capacity. No coercion is applicable to such bodies, but that of an\r\n     armed force. If we should attempt to execute the laws of the Union\r\n     by sending an armed force against a delinquent State, it would\r\n     involve the good and bad, the innocent and guilty, in the same\r\n     calamity. But this legal coercion singles out the guilty\r\n     individual, and punishes him for breaking the laws of the Union.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, Sir, if we look to all contemporary history, to the numbers of\r\nthe Federalist, to the debates in the conventions, to the publications\r\nof friends and foes, they all agree, that a change had been made from a\r\nconfederacy of States to a different system; they all agree, that the\r\nConvention had formed a Constitution for a national government. With\r\nthis result some were satisfied, and some were dissatisfied; but all\r\nadmitted that the thing had been done. In none of these various\r\nproductions and publications did any one intimate that the new\r\nConstitution was but another compact between States in their sovereign\r\ncapacities. I do not find such an opinion advanced in a single instance.\r\nEverywhere, the people were told that the old Confederation was to be\r\nabandoned, and a new system to be tried; that a proper government was\r\nproposed, to be founded in the name of the people, and to have a regular\r\norganization of its own. Everywhere, the people were told that it was to\r\nbe a government with direct powers to make laws over individuals, and to\r\nlay taxes and imposts without the consent of the States. Everywhere, it\r\nwas understood to be a popular Constitution. It came to the people for\r\ntheir adoption, and was to rest on the same deep foundation as the State\r\nconstitutions themselves. Its most distinguished advocates, who had been\r\nthemselves members of the Convention, declared that the very object of\r\nsubmitting the Constitution to the people was, to preclude the\r\npossibility of its being regarded as a mere compact. \"However gross a\r\nheresy,\" say the writers of the Federalist, \"it may be to maintain that\r\na party to a _compact_ has a right to revoke that _compact_, the\r\ndoctrine itself has had respectable advocates. The possibility of a\r\nquestion of this nature proves the necessity of laying the foundations\r\nof our national government deeper than in the mere sanction of delegated\r\nauthority. The fabric of American empire ought to rest on the solid\r\nbasis of THE CONSENT OF THE PEOPLE.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the language, Sir, addressed to the people, while they yet had\r\nthe Constitution under consideration. The powers conferred on the new\r\ngovernment were perfectly well understood to be conferred, not by any\r\nState, or the people of any State, but by the people of the United\r\nStates. Virginia is more explicit, perhaps, in this particular, than any\r\nother State. Her convention, assembled to ratify the Constitution, \"in\r\nthe name and behalf of the people of Virginia, declare and make known,\r\nthat the powers granted under the Constitution, _being derived from the\r\npeople of the United States_, may be resumed by them whenever the same\r\nshall be perverted to their injury or oppression.\"\r\n\r\nIs this language which describes the formation of a compact between\r\nStates? or language describing the grant of powers to a new government,\r\nby the whole people of the United States?\r\n\r\nAmong all the other ratifications, there is not one which speaks of the\r\nConstitution as a compact between States. Those of Massachusetts and New\r\nHampshire express the transaction, in my opinion, with sufficient\r\naccuracy. They recognize the Divine goodness \"in affording THE PEOPLE OF\r\nTHE UNITED STATES an opportunity of entering into an explicit and solemn\r\ncompact with each other, _by assenting to and ratifying a new\r\nConstitution_.\" You will observe, Sir, that it is the PEOPLE, and not\r\nthe States, who have entered into this compact; and it is the PEOPLE of\r\nall the United States. These conventions, by this form of expression,\r\nmeant merely to say, that the people of the United States had, by the\r\nblessing of Providence, enjoyed the opportunity of establishing a new\r\nConstitution, _founded in the consent of the people_. This consent of\r\nthe people has been called, by European writers, the _social compact_;\r\nand, in conformity to this common mode of expression, these conventions\r\nspeak of that assent, on which the new Constitution was to rest, as an\r\nexplicit and solemn compact, not which the States had entered into with\r\neach other, but which the _people_ of the United States had entered\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nFinally, Sir, how can any man get over the words of the Constitution\r\nitself?--\"WE, THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES, DO ORDAIN AND ESTABLISH\r\nTHIS CONSTITUTION.\" These words must cease to be a part of the\r\nConstitution, they must be obliterated from the parchment on which they\r\nare written, before any human ingenuity or human argument can remove the\r\npopular basis on which that Constitution rests, and turn the instrument\r\ninto a mere compact between sovereign States.\r\n\r\nThe second proposition, Sir, which I propose to maintain, is, that no\r\nState authority can dissolve the relations subsisting between the\r\ngovernment of the United States and individuals; that nothing can\r\ndissolve these relations but revolution; and that, therefore, there can\r\nbe no such thing as _secession_ without revolution. All this follows, as\r\nit seems to me, as a just consequence, if it be first proved that the\r\nConstitution of the United States is a government proper, owing\r\nprotection to individuals, and entitled to their obedience.\r\n\r\nThe people, Sir, in every State, live under two governments. They owe\r\nobedience to both. These governments, though distinct, are not adverse.\r\nEach has its separate sphere, and its peculiar powers and duties. It is\r\nnot a contest between two sovereigns for the same power, like the wars\r\nof the rival houses in England; nor is it a dispute between a government\r\n_de facto_ and a government _de jure_. It is the case of a division of\r\npowers between two governments, made by the people, to whom both are\r\nresponsible. Neither can dispense with the duty which individuals owe to\r\nthe other; neither can call itself master of the other: the people are\r\nmasters of both. This division of power, it is true, is in a great\r\nmeasure unknown in Europe. It is the peculiar system of America; and,\r\nthough new and singular, it is not incomprehensible. The State\r\nconstitutions are established by the people of the States. This\r\nConstitution is established by the people of all the States. How, then,\r\ncan a State secede? How can a State undo what the whole people have\r\ndone? How can she absolve her citizens from their obedience to the laws\r\nof the United States? How can she annul their obligations and oaths? How\r\ncan the members of her legislature renounce their own oaths? Sir,\r\nsecession, as a revolutionary right, is intelligible; as a right to be\r\nproclaimed in the midst of civil commotions, and asserted at the head of\r\narmies, I can understand it. But as a practical right, existing under\r\nthe Constitution, and in conformity with its provisions, it seems to me\r\nto be nothing but a plain absurdity; for it supposes resistance to\r\ngovernment, under the authority of government itself; it supposes\r\ndismemberment, without violating the principles of union; it supposes\r\nopposition to law, without crime; it supposes the violation of oaths,\r\nwithout responsibility; it supposes the total overthrow of government,\r\nwithout revolution.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution, Sir, regards itself as perpetual and immortal. It\r\nseeks to establish a union among the people of the States, which shall\r\nlast through all time. Or, if the common fate of things human must be\r\nexpected at some period to happen to it, yet that catastrophe is not\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nThe instrument contains ample provisions for its amendment, at all\r\ntimes; none for its abandonment, at any time. It declares that new\r\nStates may come into the Union, but it does not declare that old States\r\nmay go out. The Union is not a temporaly partnership of States. It is\r\nthe association of the people, under a constitution of government,\r\nuniting their power, joining together their highest interests, cementing\r\ntheir present enjoyments, and blending, in one indivisible mass, all\r\ntheir hopes for the future. Whatsoever is steadfast in just political\r\nprinciples; whatsoever is permanent in the structure of human society;\r\nwhatsoever there is which can derive an enduring character from being\r\nfounded on deep-laid principles of constitutional liberty and on the\r\nbroad foundations of the public will,--all these unite to entitle this\r\ninstrument to be regarded as a permanent constitution of government.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, Mr. President, I contend that there is a supreme law\r\nof the land, consisting of the Constitution, acts of Congress passed in\r\npursuance of it, and the public treaties. This will not be denied,\r\nbecause such are the very words of the Constitution. But I contend,\r\nfurther, that it rightfully belongs to Congress, and to the courts of\r\nthe United States, to settle the construction of this supreme law, in\r\ndoubtful cases. This is denied; and here arises the great practical\r\nquestion, _Who is to construe finally the Constitution of the United\r\nStates_? We all agree that the Constitution is the supreme law; but who\r\nshall interpret that law? In our system of the division of powers\r\nbetween different governments, controversies will necessarily sometimes\r\narise, respecting the extent of the powers of each. Who shall decide\r\nthese controversies? Does it rest with the general government, in all or\r\nany of its departments, to exercise the office of final interpreter? Or\r\nmay each of the States, as well as the general government, claim this\r\nright of ultimate decision? The practical result of this whole debate\r\nturns on this point. The gentleman contends that each State may judge\r\nfor itself of any alleged violation of the Constitution, and may finally\r\ndecide for itself, and may execute its own decisions by its own power.\r\nAll the recent proceedings in South Carolina are founded on this claim\r\nof right. Her convention has pronounced the revenue laws of the United\r\nStates unconstitutional; and this decision she does not allow any\r\nauthority of the United States to overrule or reverse. Of course she\r\nrejects the authority of Congress, because the very object of the\r\nordinance is to reverse the decision of Congress; and she rejects, too,\r\nthe authority of the courts of the United States, because she expressly\r\nprohibits all appeal to those courts. It is in order to sustain this\r\nasserted right of being her own judge, that she pronounces the\r\nConstitution of the United States to be but a compact, to which she is a\r\nparty, and a sovereign party. If this be established, then the inference\r\nis supposed to follow, that, being sovereign, there is no power to\r\ncontrol her decision; and her own judgment on her own compact is, and\r\nmust be, conclusive.\r\n\r\nI have already endeavored, Sir, to point out the practical consequences\r\nof this doctrine, and to show how utterly inconsistent it is with all\r\nideas of regular government, and how soon its adoption would involve the\r\nwhole country in revolution and absolute anarchy. I hope it is easy now\r\nto show, Sir, that a doctrine bringing such consequences with it is not\r\nwell founded; that it has nothing to stand on but theory and assumption;\r\nand that it is refuted by plain and express constitutional provisions. I\r\nthink the government of the United States does possess, in its\r\nappropriate departments, the authority of final decision on questions of\r\ndisputed power. I think it possesses this authority, both by necessary\r\nimplication and by express grant.\r\n\r\nIt will not be denied, Sir, that this authority naturally belongs to all\r\ngovernments. They all exercise it from necessity, and as a consequence\r\nof the exercise of other powers. The State governments themselves\r\npossess it, except in that class of questions which may arise between\r\nthem and the general government, and in regard to which they have\r\nsurrendered it, as well by the nature of the case as by clear\r\nconstitutional provisions. In other and ordinary cases, whether a\r\nparticular law be in conformity to the constitution of the State is a\r\nquestion which the State legislature or the State judiciary must\r\ndetermine. We all know that these questions arise daily in the State\r\ngovernments, and are decided by those governments; and I know no\r\ngovernment which does not exercise a similar power.\r\n\r\nUpon general principles, then, the government of the United States\r\npossesses this authority; and this would hardly be denied were it not\r\nthat there are other governments. But since there are State governments,\r\nand since these, like other governments, ordinarily construe their own\r\npowers, if the government of the United States construes its own powers\r\nalso, which construction is to prevail in the case of opposite\r\nconstructions? And again, as in the case now actually before us, the\r\nState governments may undertake, not only to construe their own powers,\r\nbut to decide directly on the extent of the powers of Congress. Congress\r\nhas passed a law as being within its just powers; South Carolina denies\r\nthat this law is within its just powers, and insists that she has the\r\nright so to decide this point, and that her decision is final. How are\r\nthese questions to be settled?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Sir, even if the Constitution of the United States had\r\nmade no express provision for such cases, it would yet be difficult to\r\nmaintain, that, in a Constitution existing over four-and-twenty States,\r\nwith equal authority over all, _one_ could claim a right of construing\r\nit for the whole. This would seem a manifest impropriety; indeed, an\r\nabsurdity. If the Constitution is a government existing over all the\r\nStates, though with limited powers, it necessarily follows, that, to the\r\nextent of those powers, it must be supreme. If it be not superior to the\r\nauthority of a particular State, it is not a national government. But as\r\nit is a government, as it has a legislative power of its own, and a\r\njudicial power coextensive with the legislative, the inference is\r\nirresistible that this government, thus created _by_ the whole and _for_\r\nthe whole, must have an authority superior to that of the particular\r\ngovernment of any one part. Congress is the legislature of all the\r\npeople of the United States; the judiciary of the general government is\r\nthe judiciary of all the people of the United States. To hold,\r\ntherefore, that this legislature and this judiciary are subordinate in\r\nauthority to the legislature and judiciary of a single State, is doing\r\nviolence to all common sense, and overturning all established\r\nprinciples. Congress must judge of the extent of its own powers so often\r\nas it is called on to exercise them, or it cannot act at all; and it\r\nmust also act independent of State control, or it cannot act at all.\r\n\r\nThe right of State interposition strikes at the very foundation of the\r\nlegislative power of Congress. It possesses no effective legislative\r\npower, if such right of State interposition exists; because it can pass\r\nno law not subject to abrogation. It cannot make laws for the Union, if\r\nany part of the Union may pronounce its enactments void and of no\r\neffect. Its forms of legislation would be an idle ceremony, if, after\r\nall, any one of four-and-twenty States might bid defiance to its\r\nauthority. Without express provision in the Constitution, therefore,\r\nSir, this whole question is necessarily decided by those provisions\r\nwhich create a legislative power and a judicial power. If these exist in\r\na government intended for the whole, the inevitable consequence is, that\r\nthe laws of this legislative power and the decisions of this judicial\r\npower must be binding on and over the whole. No man can form the\r\nconception of a government existing over four-and-twenty States, with a\r\nregular legislative and judicial power, and of the existence at the same\r\ntime of an authority, residing elsewhere, to resist, at pleasure or\r\ndiscretion, the enactments and the decisions of such a government. I\r\nmaintain, therefore, Sir, that, from the nature of the case, and as an\r\ninference wholly unavoidable, the acts of Congress and the decisions of\r\nthe national courts must be of higher authority than State laws and\r\nState decisions. If this be not so, there is, there can be, no general\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nBut, Mr. President, the Constitution has not left this cardinal point\r\nwithout full and explicit provisions. First, as to the authority of\r\nCongress. Having enumerated the specific powers conferred on Congress,\r\nthe Constitution adds, as a distinct and substantive clause, the\r\nfollowing, viz.: \"To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper\r\nfor carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers\r\nvested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or\r\nin any department or officer thereof.\" If this means any thing, it means\r\nthat Congress may judge of the true extent and just interpretation of\r\nthe specific powers granted to it, and may judge also of what is\r\nnecessary and proper for executing those powers. If Congress is to judge\r\nof what is necessary for the execution of its powers, it must, of\r\nnecessity, judge of the extent and interpretation of those powers.\r\n\r\nAnd in regard, Sir, to the judiciary, the Constitution is still more\r\nexpress and emphatic. It declares that the judicial power shall extend\r\nto all _cases_ in law or equity arising under the Constitution, laws of\r\nthe United States, and treaties; that there shall be _one_ Supreme\r\nCourt, and that this Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction of\r\nall these cases, subject to such exceptions as Congress may make. It is\r\nimpossible to escape from the generality of these words. If a case\r\narises under the Constitution, that is, if a case arises depending on\r\nthe construction of the Constitution, the judicial power of the United\r\nStates extends to it. It reaches _the case, the question_; it attaches\r\nthe power of the national judicature to the _case_ itself, in whatever\r\ncourt it may arise or exist; and in this _case_ the Supreme Court has\r\nappellate jurisdiction over all courts whatever. No language could\r\nprovide with more effect and precision than is here done, for subjecting\r\nconstitutional questions to the ultimate decision of the Supreme Court.\r\nAnd, Sir, this is exactly what the Convention found it necessary to\r\nprovide for, and intended to provide for. It is, too, exactly what the\r\npeople were universally told was done when they adopted the\r\nConstitution. One of the first resolutions adopted by the Convention was\r\nin these words, viz.: \"That the jurisdiction of the national judiciary\r\nshall extend to cases which respect _the collection of the national\r\nrevenue_, and questions which involve the national peace and harmony.\"\r\nNow, Sir, this either had no sensible meaning at all, or else it meant\r\nthat the jurisdiction of the national judiciary should extend to these\r\nquestions, _with a paramount authority_. It is not to be supposed that\r\nthe Convention intended that the power of the national judiciary should\r\nextend to these questions, and that the power of the judicatures of the\r\nStates should also extend to them, _with equal power of final decision_.\r\nThis would be to defeat the whole object of the provision. There were\r\nthirteen judicatures already in existence. The evil complained of, or\r\nthe danger to be guarded against, was contradiction and repugnance in\r\nthe decisions of these judicatures. If the framers of the Constitution\r\nmeant to create a fourteenth, and yet not to give it power to revise and\r\ncontrol the decisions of the existing thirteen, then they only intended\r\nto augment the existing evil and the apprehended danger by increasing\r\nstill further the chances of discordant judgments. Why, Sir, has it\r\nbecome a settled axiom in politics that every government must have a\r\njudicial power coextensive with its legislative power? Certainly, there\r\nis only this reason, namely, that the laws may receive a uniform\r\ninterpretation and a uniform execution. This object cannot be otherwise\r\nattained. A statute is what it is judicially interpreted to be; and if\r\nit be construed one way in New Hampshire, and another way in Georgia,\r\nthere is no uniform law. One supreme court, with appellate and final\r\njurisdiction, is the natural and only adequate means, in any government,\r\nto secure this uniformity. The Convention saw all this clearly; and the\r\nresolution which I have quoted, never afterwards rescinded, passed\r\nthrough various modifications, till it finally received the form which\r\nthe article now bears in the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniably true, then, that the framers of the Constitution\r\nintended to create a national judicial power, which should be paramount\r\non national subjects. And after the Constitution was framed, and while\r\nthe whole country was engaged in discussing its merits, one of its most\r\ndistinguished advocates, Mr. Madison, told the people that it _was true,\r\nthat, in controversies relating to the boundary between the two\r\njurisdictions, the tribunal which is ultimately to decide is to be\r\nestablished under the general government_. Mr. Martin, who had been a\r\nmember of the Convention, asserted the same thing to the legislature of\r\nMaryland, and urged it as a reason for rejecting the Constitution. Mr.\r\nPinckney, himself also a leading member of the Convention, declared it\r\nto the people of South Carolina. Everywhere it was admitted, by friends\r\nand foes, that this power was in the Constitution. By some it was\r\nthought dangerous, by most it was thought necessary; but by all it was\r\nagreed to be a power actually contained in the instrument. The\r\nConvention saw the absolute necessity of some control in the national\r\ngovernment over State laws. Different modes of establishing this control\r\nwere suggested and considered. At one time, it was proposed that the\r\nlaws of the States should, from time to time, be laid before Congress,\r\nand that Congress should possess a negative over them. But this was\r\nthought inexpedient and inadmissible; and in its place, and expressly as\r\na substitute for it, the existing provision was introduced; that is to\r\nsay, a provision by which the federal courts should have authority to\r\noverrule such State laws as might be in manifest contravention of the\r\nConstitution. The writers of the Federalist, in explaining the\r\nConstitution, while it was yet pending before the people, and still\r\nunadopted, give this account of the matter in terms, and assign this\r\nreason for the article as it now stands. By this provision Congress\r\nescaped the necessity of any revision of State laws, left the whole\r\nsphere of State legislation quite untouched, and yet obtained a security\r\nagainst any infringement of the constitutional power of the general\r\ngovernment. Indeed, Sir, allow me to ask again, if the national\r\njudiciary was not to exercise a power of revision on constitutional\r\nquestions over the judicatures of the States, why was any national\r\njudicature erected at all? Can any man give a sensible reason for having\r\na judicial power in this government, unless it be for the sake of\r\nmaintaining a uniformity of decision on questions arising under the\r\nConstitution and laws of Congress, and insuring its execution? And does\r\nnot this very idea of uniformity necessarily imply that the construction\r\ngiven by the national courts is to be the prevailing construction? How\r\nelse, Sir, is it possible that uniformity can be preserved?\r\n\r\nGentlemen appear to me, Sir, to look at but one side of the question.\r\nThey regard only the supposed danger of trusting a government with the\r\ninterpretation of its own powers. But will they view the question in its\r\nother aspect? Will they show us how it is possible for a government to\r\nget along with four-and-twenty interpreters of its laws and powers?\r\nGentlemen argue, too, as if, in these cases, the State would be always\r\nright, and the general government always wrong. But suppose the\r\nreverse,--suppose the State wrong (and, since they differ, some of them\r\nmust be wrong),--are the most important and essential operations of the\r\ngovernment to be embarrassed and arrested, because one State holds the\r\ncontrary opinion? Mr. President, every argument which refers the\r\nconstitutionality of acts of Congress to State decision appeals from the\r\nmajority to the minority; it appeals from the common interest to a\r\nparticular interest; from the counsels of all to the counsel of one; and\r\nendeavors to supersede the judgment of the whole by the judgment of a\r\npart.\r\n\r\nI think it is clear. Sir, that the Constitution, by express provision,\r\nby definite and unequivocal words, as well as by necessary implication,\r\nhas constituted the Supreme Court of the United States the appellate\r\ntribunal in all cases of a constitutional nature which assume the shape\r\nof a suit, in law or equity. And I think I cannot do better than to\r\nleave this part of the subject by reading the remarks made upon it in\r\nthe convention of Connecticut, by Mr. Ellsworth; a gentleman, Sir, who\r\nhas left behind him, on the records of the government of his country,\r\nproofs of the clearest intelligence and of the deepest sagacity, as well\r\nas of the utmost purity and integrity of character. \"This Constitution,\"\r\nsays he, \"defines the extent of the powers of the general government. If\r\nthe general legislature should, at any time, overleap their limits, the\r\njudicial department is a constitutional check. If the United States go\r\nbeyond their powers, if they make a law which the Constitution does not\r\nauthorize, it is void; and the judiciary power, the national judges,\r\nwho, to secure their impartiality, are to be made independent, will\r\ndeclare it to be void. On the other hand, if the States go beyond their\r\nlimits, if they make a law which is a usurpation upon the general\r\ngovernment, the law is void; and upright, independent judges will\r\ndeclare it to be so.\" Nor did this remain merely matter of private\r\nopinion. In the very first session of the first Congress, with all these\r\nwell-known objects, both of the Convention and the people, full and\r\nfresh in his mind, Mr. Ellsworth, as is generally understood, reported\r\nthe bill for the organization of the judicial department, and in that\r\nbill made provision for the exercise of this appellate power of the\r\nSupreme Court, in all the proper cases, in whatsoever court arising; and\r\nthis appellate power has now been exercised for more than forty years,\r\nwithout interruption, and without doubt.\r\n\r\nAs to the cases, Sir, which do not come before the courts, those\r\npolitical questions which terminate with the enactments of Congress, it\r\nis of necessity that these should be ultimately decided by Congress\r\nitself. Like other legislatures, it must be trusted with this power. The\r\nmembers of Congress are chosen by the people, and they are answerable to\r\nthe people; like other public agents, they are bound by oath to support\r\nthe Constitution. These are the securities that they will not violate\r\ntheir duty, nor transcend their powers. They are the same securities\r\nthat prevail in other popular governments; nor is it easy to see how\r\ngrants of power can be more safely guarded, without rendering them\r\nnugatory. If the case cannot come before the courts, and if Congress be\r\nnot trusted with its decision, who shall decide it? The gentleman says,\r\neach State is to decide it for herself. If so, then, as I have already\r\nurged, what is law in one State is not law in another. Or, if the\r\nresistance of one State compels an entire repeal of the law, then a\r\nminority, and that a small one, governs the whole country.\r\n\r\nSir, those who espouse the doctrines of nullification reject, as it\r\nseems to me, the first great principle of all republican liberty; that\r\nis, that the majority _must_ govern. In matters of common concern, the\r\njudgment of a majority _must_ stand as the judgment of the whole. This\r\nis a law imposed on us by the absolute necessity of the case; and if we\r\ndo not act upon it, there is no possibility of maintaining any\r\ngovernment but despotism. We hear loud and repeated denunciations\r\nagainst what is called _majority government_. It is declared, with much\r\nwarmth, that a majority government cannot be maintained in the United\r\nStates. What, then, do gentlemen wish? Do they wish to establish a\r\n_minority_ government? Do they wish to subject the will of the many to\r\nthe will of the few? The honorable gentleman from South Carolina has\r\nspoken of absolute majorities and majorities concurrent; language wholly\r\nunknown to our Constitution, and to which it is not easy to affix\r\ndefinite ideas. As far as I understand it, it would teach us that the\r\nabsolute majority may be found in Congress, but the majority concurrent\r\nmust be looked for in the States; that is to say, Sir, stripping the\r\nmatter of this novelty of phrase, that the dissent of one or more\r\nStates, as States, renders void the decision of a majority of Congress,\r\nso far as that State is concerned. And so this doctrine, running but a\r\nshort career, like other dogmas of the day, terminates in nullification.\r\n\r\nIf this vehement invective against _majorities_ meant no more than that,\r\nin the construction of government, it is wise to provide checks and\r\nbalances, so that there should be various limitations on the power of\r\nthe mere majority, it would only mean what the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States has already abundantly provided. It is full of such checks\r\nand balances. In its very organization, it adopts a broad and most\r\neffective principle in restraint of the power of mere majorities. A\r\nmajority of the people elects the House of Representatives, but it does\r\nnot elect the Senate. The Senate is elected by the States, each State\r\nhaving, in this respect, an equal power. No law, therefore, can pass,\r\nwithout the assent of the representatives of the people, and a majority\r\nof the representatives of the States also. A majority of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people must concur, and a majority of the States\r\nmust concur, in every act of Congress; and the President is elected on a\r\nplan compounded of both these principles. But having composed one house\r\nof representatives chosen by the people in each State, according to\r\ntheir numbers, and the other of an equal number of members from every\r\nState, whether larger or smaller, the Constitution gives to majorities\r\nin these houses thus constituted the full and entire power of passing\r\nlaws, subject always to the constitutional restrictions and to the\r\napproval of the President. To subject them to any other power is clear\r\nusurpation. The majority of one house may be controlled by the majority\r\nof the other; and both may be restrained by the President's negative.\r\nThese are checks and balances provided by the Constitution, existing in\r\nthe government itself, and wisely intended to secure deliberation and\r\ncaution in legislative proceedings. But to resist the will of the\r\nmajority in both houses, thus constitutionally exercised, to insist on\r\nthe lawfulness of interposition by an extraneous power; to claim the\r\nright of defeating the will of Congress, by setting up against it the\r\nwill of a single State,--is neither more nor less, as it strikes me,\r\nthan a plain attempt to overthrow the government. The constituted\r\nauthorities of the United States are no longer a government, if they be\r\nnot masters of their own will; they are no longer a government, if an\r\nexternal power may arrest their proceedings; they are no longer a\r\ngovernment, if acts passed by both houses, and approved by the\r\nPresident, may be nullified by State vetoes or State ordinances. Does\r\nany one suppose it could make any difference, as to the binding\r\nauthority of an act of Congress, and of the duty of a State to respect\r\nit, whether it passed by a mere majority of both houses, or by three\r\nfourths of each, or the unanimous vote of each? Within the limits and\r\nrestrictions of the Constitution, the government of the United States,\r\nlike all other populpr governments, acts by majorities. It can act no\r\notherwise. Whoever, therefore, denounces the government of majorities,\r\ndenounces the government of his own country, and denounces all free\r\ngovernments. And whoever would restrain these majorities, while acting\r\nwithin their constitutional limits, by an external power, whatever he\r\nmay intend, asserts principles which, if adopted, can lead to nothing\r\nelse than the destruction of the government itself.\r\n\r\nDoes not the gentleman perceive, Sir, how his argument against\r\nmajorities might here be retorted upon him? Does he not see how cogently\r\nhe might be asked, whether it be the character of nullification to\r\npractise what it preaches? Look to South Carolina, at the present\r\nmoment. How far are the rights of minorities there respected? I confess,\r\nSir, I have not known, in peaceable times, the power of the majority\r\ncarried with a higher hand, or upheld with more relentless disregard of\r\nthe rights, feelings and principles of the minority;--a minority\r\nembracing, as the gentleman himself will admit, a large portion of the\r\nworth and respectability of the State;--a minority comprehending in its\r\nnumbers men who have been associated with him, and with us, in these\r\nhalls of legislation; men who have served their country at home and\r\nhonored it abroad; men who would cheerfully lay down their lives for\r\ntheir native State, in any cause which they could regard as the cause of\r\nhonor and duty; men above fear, and above reproach, whose deepest grief\r\nand distress spring from the conviction, that the present proceedings of\r\nthe State must ultimately reflect discredit upon her. How is this\r\nminority, how are these men, regarded? They are enthralled and\r\ndisfranchised by ordinances and acts of legislation; subjected to tests\r\nand oaths, incompatible, as they conscientiously think, with oaths\r\nalready taken, and obligations already assumed; they are proscribed and\r\ndenounced as recreants to duty and patriotism, and slaves to a foreign\r\npower. Both the spirit which pursues them, and the positive measures\r\nwhich emanate from that spirit, are harsh and proscriptive beyond all\r\nprecedent within my knowledge, except in periods of professed\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIt is not, Sir, one would think, for those who approve these proceedings\r\nto complain of the power of majorities.\r\n\r\nMr. President, all popular governments rest on two principles, or two\r\nassumptions:--\r\n\r\nFirst, That there is so far a common interest among those over whom the\r\ngovernment extends, as that it may provide for the defence, protection,\r\nand good government of the whole, without injustice or oppression to\r\nparts; and\r\n\r\nSecondly, That the representatives of the people, and especially the\r\npeople themselves, are secure against general corruption, and may be\r\ntrusted, therefore, with the exercise of power.\r\n\r\nWhoever argues against these principles argues against the\r\npracticability of all free governments. And whoever admits these, must\r\nadmit, or cannot deny, that power is as safe in the hands of Congress as\r\nin those of other representative bodies. Congress is not irresponsible.\r\nIts members are agents of the people, elected by them, answerable to\r\nthem, and liable to be displaced or superseded, at their pleasure; and\r\nthey possess as fair a claim to the confidence of the people, while they\r\ncontinue to deserve it, as any other public political agents.\r\n\r\nIf, then, Sir, the manifest intention of the Convention, and the\r\ncontemporary admission of both friends and foes, prove any thing; if the\r\nplain text of the instrument itself, as well as the necessary\r\nimplication from other provisions, prove any thing; if the early\r\nlegislation of Congress, the course of judicial decisions, acquiesced in\r\nby all the States for forty years, prove any thing,--then it is proved\r\nthat there is a supreme law, and a final interpreter.\r\n\r\nMy fourth and last proposition, Mr. President, was, that any attempt by\r\na State to abrogate or nullify acts of Congress is a usurpation on the\r\npowers of the general government and on the equal rights of other\r\nStates, a violation of the Constitution, and a proceeding essentially\r\nrevolutionary. This is undoubtedly true, if the preceding propositions\r\nbe regarded as proved. If the government of the United States be trusted\r\nwith the duty, in any department, of declaring the extent of its own\r\npowers, then a State ordinance, or act of legislation, authorizing\r\nresistance to an act of Congress, on the alleged ground of its\r\nunconstitutionally, is manifestly a usurpation upon its powers. If the\r\nStates have equal rights in matters concerning the whole, then for one\r\nState to set up her judgment against the judgment of the rest, and to\r\ninsist on executing that judgment by force, is also a manifest\r\nusurpation on the rights of other States. If the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States be a government proper, with authority to pass laws, and\r\nto give them a uniform interpretation and execution, then the\r\ninterposition of a State, to enforce her own construction, and to\r\nresist, as to herself, that law which binds the other States, is a\r\nviolation of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIf that be revolutionary which arrests the legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial power of government, dispenses with existing oaths and\r\nobligations of obedience, and elevates another power to supreme\r\ndominion, then nullification is revolutionary. Or if that be\r\nrevolutionary the natural tendency and practical effect of which are to\r\nbreak the Union into fragments, to sever all connection among the people\r\nof the respective States, and to prostrate this general government in\r\nthe dust, then nullification is revolutionary.\r\n\r\nNullification, Sir, is as distinctly revolutionary as secession; but I\r\ncannot say that the revolution which it seeks is one of so respectable a\r\ncharacter. Secession would, it is true, abandon the Constitution\r\naltogether; but then it would profess to abandon it. Whatever other\r\ninconsistencies it might run into, one, at least, it would avoid. It\r\nwould not belong to a government, while it rejected its authority. It\r\nwould not repel the burden, and continue to enjoy the benefits. It would\r\nnot aid in passing laws which others are to obey, and yet reject their\r\nauthority as to itself. It would not undertake to reconcile obedience to\r\npublic authority with an asserted right of command over that same\r\nauthority. It would not be in the government, and above the government,\r\nat the same time. But though secession may be a more respectable mode of\r\nattaining the object than nullification, it is not more truly\r\nrevolutionary. Each, and both, resist the constitutional authorities;\r\neach, and both, would sever the Union and subvert the government.\r\n\r\nMr. President, having detained the Senate so long already, I will not\r\nnow examine at length the ordinance and laws of South Carolina. These\r\npapers are well drawn for their purpose. Their authors understood their\r\nown objects. They are called a peaceable remedy, and we have been told\r\nthat South Carolina, after all, intends nothing but a lawsuit. A very\r\nfew words, Sir, will show the nature of this peaceable remedy, and of\r\nthe lawsuit which South Carolina contemplates.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the ordinance declares the law of last July, and all\r\nother laws of the United States laying duties, to be absolutely null and\r\nvoid, and makes it unlawful for the constituted authorities of the\r\nUnited States to enforce the payment of such duties. It is therefore,\r\nSir, an indictable offence, at this moment, in South Carolina, for any\r\nperson to be concerned in collecting revenue under the laws of the\r\nUnited States. It being declared, by what is considered a fundamental\r\nlaw of the State, unlawful to collect these duties, an indictment lies,\r\nof course, against any one concerned in such collection; and he is, on\r\ngeneral principles, liable to be punished by fine and imprisonment. The\r\nterms, it is true, are, that it is unlawful \"to enforce the payment of\r\nduties\"; but every custom-house officer enforces payment while he\r\ndetains the goods in order to obtain such payment. The ordinance,\r\ntherefore, reaches everybody concerned in the collection of the duties.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step in the prosecution of the peaceable remedy. The\r\nsecond is more decisive. By the act commonly called the _replevin_ law,\r\nany person whose goods are seized or detained by the collector for the\r\npayment of duties may sue out a writ of replevin, and, by virtue of that\r\nwrit, the goods are to be restored to him. A writ of replevin is a writ\r\nwhich the sheriff is bound to execute, and for the execution of which he\r\nis bound to employ force, if necessary. He may call out the _posse_, and\r\nmust do so, if resistance be made. This _posse_ may be armed or unarmed.\r\nIt may come forth with military array, and under the lead of military\r\nmen. Whatever number of troops may be assembled in Charleston, they may\r\nbe summoned, with the governor, or commander-in-chief, at their head, to\r\ncome in aid of the sheriff. It is evident, then, Sir, that the whole\r\nmilitary power of the State is to be employed, if necessary, in\r\ndispossessing the custom-house officers, and in seizing and holding the\r\ngoods, without paying the duties. This is the second step in the\r\npeaceable remedy.\r\n\r\nSir, whatever pretences may be set up to the contrary, this is the\r\ndirect application of force, and of military force. It is unlawful, in\r\nitself, to replevy goods in the custody of the collectors. But this\r\nunlawful act is to be done, and it is to be done by power. Here is a\r\nplain interposition, by physical force, to resist the laws of the Union.\r\nThe legal mode of collecting duties is to detain the goods till such\r\nduties are paid or secured. But force comes, and overpowers the\r\ncollector and his assistants, and takes away the goods, leaving the\r\nduties unpaid. There cannot be a clearer case of forcible resistance to\r\nlaw. And it is provided that the goods thus seized shall be held against\r\nany attempt to retake them, by the same force which seized them.\r\n\r\nHaving thus dispossessed the officers of the government of the goods,\r\nwithout payment of duties, and seized and secured them by the strong arm\r\nof the State, only one thing more remains to be done, and that is, to\r\ncut off all possibility of legal redress; and that, too, is\r\naccomplished, or thought to be accomplished. The ordinance declares,\r\n_that all judicial proceedings, founded on the revenue laws_ (including,\r\nof course, proceedings in the courts of the United States), _shall be\r\nnull and void_. This nullifies the judicial power of the United States.\r\nThen comes the test-oath act. This requires all State judges and jurors\r\nin the State courts to swear that they will execute the ordinance, and\r\nall acts of the legislature passed in pursuance thereof. The ordinance\r\ndeclares, that no appeal shall be allowed from the decision of the State\r\ncourts to the Supreme Court of the United States; and the replevin act\r\nmakes it an indictable offence for any clerk to furnish a copy of the\r\nrecord, for the purpose of such appeal.\r\n\r\nThe two principal provisions on which South Carolina relies, to resist\r\nthe laws of the United States, and nullify the authority of this\r\ngovernment, are, therefore, these:--\r\n\r\n1. A forcible seizure of goods, before duties are paid or secured, by\r\nthe power of the State, civil and military.\r\n\r\n2. The taking away, by the most effectual means in her power, of all\r\nlegal redress in the courts of the United States; the confining of\r\njudicial proceedings to her own State tribunals; and the compelling of\r\nher judges and jurors of these her own courts to take an oath,\r\nbeforehand, that they will decide all cases according to the ordinance,\r\nand the acts passed under it; that is, that they will decide the cause\r\none way. They do not swear to _try_ it, on its own merits; they only\r\nswear to _decide_ it as nullification requires.\r\n\r\nThe character, Sir, of these provisions defies comment. Their object is\r\nas plain as their means are extraordinary. They propose direct\r\nresistance, by the whole power of the State, to laws of Congress, and\r\ncut off, by methods deemed adequate, any redress by legal and judicial\r\nauthority. They arrest legislation, defy the executive, and banish the\r\njudicial power of this government. They authorize and command acts to be\r\ndone, and done by force, both of numbers and of arms, which, if done,\r\nand done by force, are clearly acts of rebellion and treason.\r\n\r\nSuch, Sir, are the laws of South Carolina; such, Sir, is the peaceable\r\nremedy of nullification. Has not nullification reached, Sir, even thus\r\nearly, that point of direct and forcible resistance to law to which I\r\nintimated, three years ago, it plainly tended?\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. President, what is the reason for passing laws like these?\r\nWhat are the oppressions experienced under the Union, calling for\r\nmeasures which thus threaten to sever and destroy it? What invasions of\r\npublic liberty, what ruin to private happiness, what long list of rights\r\nviolated, or wrongs unredressed, is to justify to the country, to\r\nposterity, and to the world, this assault upon the free Constitution of\r\nthe United States, this great and glorious work of our fathers? At this\r\nvery moment, Sir, the whole land smiles in peace, and rejoices in\r\nplenty. A general and a high prosperity pervades the country; and,\r\njudging by the common standard, by increase of population and wealth,\r\nor judging by the opinions of that portion of her people not embarked in\r\nthese dangerous and desperate measures, this prosperity overspreads\r\nSouth Carolina herself.\r\n\r\nThus happy at home, our country, at the same time, holds high the\r\ncharacter of her institutions, her power, her rapid growth, and her\r\nfuture destiny, in the eyes of all foreign states. One danger only\r\ncreates hesitation; one doubt only exists, to darken the otherwise\r\nunclouded brightness of that aspect which she exhibits to the view and\r\nto the admiration of the world. Need I say, that that doubt respects the\r\npermanency of our Union? and need I say, that that doubt is now caused,\r\nmore than any thing else, by these very proceedings of South Carolina?\r\nSir, all Europe is, at this moment, beholding us, and looking for the\r\nissue of this controversy; those who hate free institutions, with\r\nmalignant hope; those who love them, with deep anxiety and shivering\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nThe cause, then, Sir, the cause! Let the world know the cause which has\r\nthus induced one State of the Union to bid defiance to the power of the\r\nwhole, and openly to talk of secession. Sir, the world will scarcely\r\nbelieve that this whole controversy, and all the desperate measures\r\nwhich its support requires, have no other foundation than a difference\r\nof opinion upon a provision of the Constitution, between a majority of\r\nthe people of South Carolina, on one side, and a vast majority of the\r\nwhole people of the United States, on the other. It will not credit the\r\nfact, it will not admit the possibility, that, in an enlightened age, in\r\na free, popular republic, under a constitution where the people govern,\r\nas they must always govern under such systems, by majorities, at a time\r\nof unprecedented prosperity, without practical oppression, without evils\r\nsuch as may not only be pretended, but felt and experienced,--evils not\r\nslight or temporary, but deep, permanent, and intolerable,--a single\r\nState should rush into conflict with all the rest, attempt to put down\r\nthe power of the Union by her own laws, and to support those laws by her\r\nmilitary power, and thus break up and destroy the world's last hope. And\r\nwell the world may be incredulous. We, who see and hear it, can\r\nourselves hardly yet believe it. Even after all that had preceded it,\r\nthis ordinance struck the country with amazement. It was incredible and\r\ninconceivable that South Carolina should plunge headlong into resistance\r\nto the laws on a matter of opinion, and on a question in which the\r\npreponderance of opinion, both of the present day and of all past time,\r\nwas so overwhelmingly against her. The ordinance declares that Congress\r\nhas exceeded its just power by laying duties on imports, intended for\r\nthe protection of manufactures. This is the opinion of South Carolina;\r\nand on the strength of that opinion she nullifies the laws. Yet has the\r\nrest of the country no right to its opinion also? Is one State to sit\r\nsole arbitress? She maintains that those laws are plain, deliberate, and\r\npalpable violations of the Constitution; that she has a sovereign right\r\nto decide this matter; and that, having so decided, she is authorized to\r\nresist their execution by her own sovereign power; and she declares that\r\nshe will resist it, though such resistance should shatter the Union into\r\natoms.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I do not intend to discuss the propriety of these laws at\r\nlarge; but I will ask, How are they shown to be thus plainly and\r\npalpably unconstitutional? Have they no countenance at all in the\r\nConstitution itself? Are they quite new in the history of the\r\ngovernment? Are they a sudden and violent usurpation on the rights of\r\nthe States? Sir, what will the civilized world say, what will posterity\r\nsay, when they learn that similar laws have existed from the very\r\nfoundation of the government, that for thirty years the power was never\r\nquestioned, and that no State in the Union has more freely and\r\nunequivocally admitted it than South Carolina herself?\r\n\r\nTo lay and collect duties and imposts is an _express power_ granted by\r\nthe Constitution to Congress. It is, also, an _exclusive power_; for the\r\nConstitution as expressly prohibits all the States from exercising it\r\nthemselves. This express and exclusive power is unlimited in the terms\r\nof the grant, but is attended with two specific restrictions: first,\r\nthat all duties and imposts shall be equal in all the States; second,\r\nthat no duties shall be laid on exports. The power, then, being granted,\r\nand being attended with these two restrictions, and no more, who is to\r\nimpose a third restriction on the general words of the grant? If the\r\npower to lay duties, as known among all other nations, and as known in\r\nall our history, and as it was perfectly understood when the\r\nConstitution was adopted, includes a right of discriminating while\r\nexercising the power, and of laying some duties heavier and some\r\nlighter, for the sake of encouraging our own domestic products, what\r\nauthority is there for giving to the words used in the Constitution a\r\nnew, narrow, and unusual meaning? All the limitations which the\r\nConstitution intended, it has expressed; and what it has left\r\nunrestricted is as much a part of its will as the restraints which it\r\nhas imposed.\r\n\r\nBut these laws, it is said, are unconstitutional on account of the\r\n_motive_. How, Sir, can a law be examined on any such ground? How is the\r\nmotive to be ascertained? One house, or one member, may have one motive;\r\nthe other house, or another member, another. One motive may operate\r\nto-day, and another to-morrow. Upon any such mode of reasoning as this,\r\none law might be unconstitutional now, and another law, in exactly the\r\nsame words, perfectly constitutional next year. Besides, articles may\r\nnot only be taxed for the purpose of protecting home products, but other\r\narticles may be left free, for the same purpose and with the same\r\nmotive. A law, therefore, would become unconstitutional from what it\r\nomitted, as well as from what it contained. Mr. President, it is a\r\nsettled principle, acknowledged in all legislative halls, recognized\r\nbefore all tribunals, sanctioned by the general sense and understanding\r\nof mankind, that there can be no inquiry into the motives of those who\r\npass laws, for the purpose of determining on their validity. If the law\r\nbe within the fair meaning of the words in the grant of the power, its\r\nauthority must be admitted until it is repealed. This rule, everywhere\r\nacknowledged, everywhere admitted, is so universal and so completely\r\nwithout exception, that even an allegation of fraud, in the majority of\r\na legislature, is not allowed as a ground to set aside a law.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, is it true that the motive for these laws is such as is\r\nstated? I think not. The great object of all these laws is,\r\nunquestionably, revenue. If there were no occasion for revenue, the laws\r\nwould not have been passed; and it is notorious that almost the entire\r\nrevenue of the country is derived from them. And as yet we have\r\ncollected none too much revenue. The treasury has not been more reduced\r\nfor many years than it is at the present moment. All that South Carolina\r\ncan say is, that, in passing the laws which she now undertakes to\r\nnullify, _particular imported articles were taxed, from a regard to the\r\nprotection of certain articles of domestic manufacture, higher than they\r\nwould have been had no such regard been entertained_. And she insists,\r\nthat, according to the Constitution, no such discrimination can be\r\nallowed; that duties should be laid for revenue, and revenue only; and\r\nthat it is unlawful to have reference, in any case, to protection. In\r\nother words, she denies the power of DISCRIMINATION. She does not, and\r\ncannot, complain of excessive taxation; on the contrary, she professes\r\nto be willing to pay any amount for revenue, merely as revenue; and up\r\nto the present moment there is no surplus of revenue. Her grievance,\r\nthen, that plain and palpable violation of the Constitution which she\r\ninsists has taken place, is simply the exercise of the power of\r\nDISCRIMINATION. Now, Sir, is the exercise of this power of\r\ndiscrimination plainly and palpably unconstitutional?\r\n\r\nI have already said, the power to lay duties is given by the\r\nConstitution in broad and general terms. There is also conferred on\r\nCongress the whole power of regulating commerce, in another distinct\r\nprovision. Is it clear and palpable, Sir, can any man say it is a case\r\nbeyond doubt, that, under these two powers, Congress may not justly\r\n_discriminate_, in laying duties, _for the purpose of countervailing the\r\npolicy of foreign nations, or of favoring our own home productions_?\r\nSir, what ought to conclude this question for ever, as it would seem to\r\nme, is, that the regulation of commerce and the imposition of duties\r\nare, in all commercial nations, powers avowedly and constantly exercised\r\nfor this very end. That undeniable truth ought to settle the question;\r\nbecause the Constitution ought to be considered, when it uses well-known\r\nlanguage, as using it in its well-known sense. But it is equally\r\nundeniable, that it has been, from the very first, fully believed that\r\nthis power of discrimination was conferred on Congress; and the\r\nConstitution was itself recommended, urged upon the people, and\r\nenthusiastically insisted on in some of the States, for that very\r\nreason. Not that, at that time, the country was extensively engaged in\r\nmanufactures, especially of the kinds now existing. But the trades and\r\ncrafts of the seaport towns, the business of the artisans and manual\r\nlaborers,--those employments, the work in which supplies so great a\r\nportion of the daily wants of all classes,--all these looked to the new\r\nConstitution as a source of relief from the severe distress which\r\nfollowed the war. It would, Sir, be unpardonable, at so late an hour, to\r\ngo into details on this point; but the truth is as I have stated. The\r\npapers of the day, the resolutions of public meetings, the debates in\r\nthe contentions, all that we open our eyes upon in the history of the\r\ntimes, prove it.\r\n\r\nSir, the honorable gentleman from South Carolina has referred to two\r\nincidents connected with the proceedings of the Convention at\r\nPhiladelphia, which he thinks are evidence to show that the power of\r\nprotecting manufactures by laying duties, and by commercial regulations,\r\nwas not intended to be given to Congress. The first is, as he says, that\r\na power to protect manufactures was expressly proposed, but not granted.\r\nI think, Sir, the gentleman is quite mistaken in relation to this part\r\nof the proceedings of the Convention. The whole history of the\r\noccurrence to which he alludes is simply this. Towards the conclusion of\r\nthe Convention, after the provisions of the Constitution had been mainly\r\nagreed upon, after the power to lay duties and the power to regulate\r\ncommerce had both been granted, a long list of propositions was made and\r\nreferred to the committee, containing various miscellaneous powers, some\r\nor all of which it was thought might be properly vested in Congress.\r\nAmong these was a power to establish a university; to grant charters of\r\nincorporation; to regulate stage-coaches on the post-roads, and also the\r\npower to which the gentleman refers, and which is expressed in these\r\nwords: \"To establish public institutions, rewards, and immunities, for\r\nthe promotion of agriculture, commerce, trades, and manufactures.\" The\r\ncommittee made no report on this or various other propositions in the\r\nsame list. But the only inference from this omission is, that neither\r\nthe committee nor the Convention thought it proper to authorize Congress\r\n\"to establish public institutions, rewards, and immunities,\" for the\r\npromotion of manufactures, and other interests. The Convention supposed\r\nit had done enough,--at any rate, it had done all it intended,--when it\r\nhad given to Congress, in general terms, the power to lay imposts and\r\nthe power to regulate trade. It is not to be argued, from its omission\r\nto give more, that it meant to take back what it had already given. It\r\nhad given the impost power; it had given the regulation of trade; and it\r\ndid not deem it necessary to give the further and distinct power of\r\nestablishing public institutions.\r\n\r\nThe other fact, Sir, on which the gentleman relies, is the declaration\r\nof Mr. Martin to the legislature of Maryland. The gentleman supposes Mr.\r\nMartin to have urged against the Constitution, that it did not contain\r\nthe power of protection. But if the gentleman will look again at what\r\nMr. Martin said, he will find, I think, that what Mr. Martin complained\r\nof was, that the Constitution, by its prohibitions on the States, had\r\ntaken away from the States themselves the power of protecting their own\r\nmanufactures by duties on imports. This is undoubtedly true; but I find\r\nno expression of Mr. Martin intimating that the Constitution had not\r\nconferred on Congress the same power which it had thus taken from the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, let us go to the first Congress; let us look in upon this and\r\nthe other house, at the first session of their organization.\r\n\r\nWe see, in both houses, men distinguished among the framers, friends,\r\nand advocates of the Constitution. We see in both, those who had drawn,\r\ndiscussed, and matured the instrument in the Convention, explained and\r\ndefended it before the people, and were now elected members of Congress,\r\nto put the new government into motion, and to carry the powers of the\r\nConstitution into beneficial execution. At the head of the government\r\nwas WASHINGTON himself, who had been President of the Convention; and in\r\nhis cabinet were others most thoroughly acquainted with the history of\r\nthe Constitution, and distinguished for the part taken in its\r\ndiscussion. If these persons were not acquainted with the meaning of the\r\nConstitution, if they did not understand the work of their own hands,\r\nwho can understand it, or who shall now interpret it to us?\r\n\r\nSir, the volume which records the proceedings and debates of the first\r\nsession of the House of Representatives lies before me. I open it, and I\r\nfind that, having provided for the administration of the necessary\r\noaths, the very first measure proposed for consideration is, the laying\r\nof imposts; and in the very first committee of the whole into which the\r\nHouse of Representatives ever resolved itself, on this its earliest\r\nsubject, and in this its very first debate, the duty of so laying the\r\nimposts as to encourage manufactures was advanced and enlarged upon by\r\nalmost every speaker, and doubted or denied by none. The first gentleman\r\nwho suggests this as the clear duty of Congress, and as an object\r\nnecessary to be attended to, is Mr. Fitzsimons, of Pennsylvania; the\r\nsecond, Mr. White, of VIRGINIA; the third, Mr. Tucker, of SOUTH\r\nCAROLINA.\r\n\r\nBut the great leader, Sir, on this occasion, was Mr. Madison. Was _he_\r\nlikely to know the intentions of the Convention and the people? Was _he_\r\nlikely to understand the Constitution? At the second sitting of the\r\ncommittee, Mr. Madison explained his own opinions of the duty of\r\nCongress, fully and explicitly. I must not detain you, Sir, with more\r\nthan a few short extracts from these opinions, but they are such as are\r\nclear, intelligible, and decisive. \"The States,\" says he, \"that are most\r\nadvanced in population, and ripe for manufactures, ought to have their\r\nparticular interest attended to, in some degree. While these States\r\nretained the power of making regulations of trade, they had the power to\r\ncherish such institutions. By adopting the present Constitution, they\r\nhave thrown the exercise of this power into other hands; they must have\r\ndone this with an expectation that those interests would not be\r\nneglected here.\" In another report of the same speech, Mr. Madison is\r\nrepresented as using still stronger language; as saying that, the\r\nConstitution having taken this power away from the States and conferred\r\nit on Congress, it would be a _fraud_ on the States and on the people\r\nwere Congress to refuse to exercise it.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison argues, Sir, on this early and interesting occasion, very\r\njustly and liberally, in favor of the general principles of unrestricted\r\ncommerce. But he argues, also, with equal force and clearness, for\r\ncertain important exceptions to these general principles. The first,\r\nSir, respects those manufactures which had been brought forward under\r\nencouragement by the State governments. \"It would be cruel,\" says Mr.\r\nMadison, \"to neglect them, and to divert their industry into other\r\nchannels; for it is not possible for the hand of man to shift from one\r\nemployment to another without being injured by the change.\" Again:\r\n\"There may be some manufactures which, being once formed, can advance\r\ntowards perfection without any adventitious aid; while others, for want\r\nof the fostering hand of government, will be unable to go on at all.\r\nLegislative provision, therefore, will be necessary to collect the\r\nproper objects for this purpose; and this will form another exception to\r\nmy general principle.\" And again: \"The next exception that occurs is one\r\non which great stress is laid by some well-informed men, and this with\r\ngreat plausibility; that each nation should have, within itself, the\r\nmeans of defence, independent of foreign supplies; that, in whatever\r\nrelates to the operations of war, no State ought to depend upon a\r\nprecarious supply from any part of the world. There may be some truth in\r\nthis remark; and therefore it is proper for legislative attention.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same debate, Sir, Mr. Burk, from SOUTH CAROLINA, supported a duty\r\non hemp, for the express purpose of encouraging its growth on the strong\r\nlands of South Carolina. \"Cotton,\" he said, \"was also in contemplation\r\namong them, and, if good seed could be procured, he hoped might\r\nsucceed.\" Afterwards, Sir, the cotton was obtained, its culture was\r\nprotected, and it did succeed. Mr. Smith, a very distinguished member\r\nfrom the SAME STATE, observed: \"It has been said, and justly, that the\r\nStates which adopted this Constitution expected its administration would\r\nbe conducted with a favorable hand. The manufacturing States wished the\r\nencouragement of manufactures, the maritime States the encouragement of\r\nship-building, and the agricultural States the encouragement of\r\nagriculture.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I will detain the Senate by reading no more extracts from these\r\ndebates. I have already shown a majority of the members of SOUTH\r\nCAROLINA, in this very first session, acknowledging this power of\r\nprotection, voting for its exercise, and proposing its extension to\r\ntheir own products. Similar propositions came from Virginia; and,\r\nindeed, Sir, in the whole debate, at whatever page you open the volume,\r\nyou find the power admitted, and you find it applied to the protection\r\nof particular articles, or not applied, according to the discretion of\r\nCongress. No man denied the power, no man doubted it; the only questions\r\nwere, in regard to the several articles proposed to be taxed, whether\r\nthey were fit subjects for protection, and what the amount of that\r\nprotection ought to be. Will gentlemen, Sir, now answer the argument\r\ndrawn from these proceedings of the first Congress? Will they undertake\r\nto deny that that Congress did act on the avowed principle of\r\nprotection? Or, if they admit it, will they tell us how those who framed\r\nthe Constitution fell, thus early, into this great mistake about its\r\nmeaning? Will they tell us how it should happen that they had so soon\r\nforgotten their own sentiments and their own purposes? I confess I have\r\nseen no answer to this argument, nor any respectable attempt to answer\r\nit. And, Sir, how did this debate terminate? What law was passed? There\r\nit stands, Sir, among the statutes, the second law in the book. It has a\r\n_preamble_, and that preamble expressly recites, that the duties which\r\nit imposes are laid \"for the support of government, for the discharge of\r\nthe debts of the United States, and _the encouragement and protection of\r\nmanufactures_.\" Until, Sir, this early legislation, thus coeval with the\r\nConstitution itself, thus full and explicit, can be explained away, no\r\nman can doubt of the meaning of that instrument in this respect.\r\n\r\nMr. President, this power of _discrimination_, thus admitted, avowed,\r\nand practised upon in the first revenue act, has never been denied or\r\ndoubted until within a few years past. It was not at all doubted in\r\n1816, when it became necessary to adjust the revenue to a state of\r\npeace. On the contrary, the power was then exercised, not without\r\nopposition as to its expediency, but, as far as I remember or have\r\nunderstood, without the slightest opposition founded on any supposed\r\nwant of constitutional authority. Certainly, SOUTH CAROLINA did not\r\ndoubt it. The tariff of 1816 was introduced, carried through, and\r\nestablished, under the lead of South Carolina. Even the minimum policy\r\nis of South Carolina origin. The honorable gentleman himself supported,\r\nand ably supported, the tariff of 1816. He has informed us, Sir, that\r\nhis speech on that occasion was sudden and off-hand, he being called up\r\nby the request of a friend. I am sure the gentleman so remembers it, and\r\nthat it was so; but there is, nevertheless, much method, arrangement,\r\nand clear exposition in that extempore speech. It is very able, very,\r\nvery much to the point, and very decisive. And in another speech,\r\ndelivered two months earlier, on the proposition to repeal the internal\r\ntaxes, the honorable gentleman had touched the same subject, and had\r\ndeclared \"_that a certain encouragement ought to be extended at least to\r\nour woollen and cotton manufactures_.\" I do not quote these speeches,\r\nSir, for the purpose of showing that the honorable gentleman has changed\r\nhis opinion: my object is other and higher. I do it for the sake of\r\nsaying that that cannot be so plainly and palpably unconstitutional as\r\nto warrant resistance to law, nullification, and revolution, which the\r\nhonorable gentleman and his friends have heretofore agreed to and acted\r\nupon without doubt and without hesitation. Sir, it is no answer to say\r\nthat the tariff of 1816 was a revenue bill. So are they all revenue\r\nbills. The point is, and the truth is, that the tariff of 1816, like the\r\nrest, _did discriminate_; it did distinguish one article from another;\r\nit did lay duties for protection. Look to the case of coarse cottons\r\nunder the minimum calculation: the duty on these was from sixty to\r\neighty per cent. Something beside revenue, certainly, was intended in\r\nthis; and, in fact, the law cut up our whole commerce with India in that\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nIt is, Sir, only within a few years that Carolina has denied the\r\nconstitutionality of these protective laws. The gentleman himself has\r\nnarrated to us the true history of her proceedings on this point. He\r\nsays, that, after the passing of the law of 1828, despairing then of\r\nbeing able to abolish the system of protection, political men went forth\r\namong the people, and set up the doctrine that the system was\r\nunconstitutional. \"_And the people_,\" says the honorable gentleman,\r\n\"_received the doctrine_.\" This, I believe, is true, Sir. The people did\r\nthen receive the doctrine; they had never entertained it before. Down to\r\nthat period, the constitutionality of these laws had been no more\r\ndoubted in South Carolina than elsewhere. And I suspect it is true, Sir,\r\nand I deem it a great misfortune, that, to the present moment, a great\r\nportion of the people of the State have never yet seen more than one\r\nside of the argument. I believe that thousands of honest men are\r\ninvolved in scenes now passing, led away by one-sided views of the\r\nquestion, and following their leaders by the impulses of an unlimited\r\nconfidence. Depend upon it, Sir, if we can avoid the shock of arms, a\r\nday for reconsideration and reflection will come; truth and reason will\r\nact with their accustomed force, and the public opinion of South\r\nCarolina will be restored to its usual constitutional and patriotic\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, I hold South Carolina to her ancient, her cool, her\r\nuninfluenced, her deliberate opinions. I hold her to her own admissions,\r\nnay, to her own claims and pretensions, in 1789, in the first Congress,\r\nand to her acknowledgments and avowed sentiments through a long series\r\nof succeeding years. I hold her to the principles on which she led\r\nCongress to act in 1816; or, if she have changed her own opinions, I\r\nclaim some respect for those who still retain the same opinions. I say\r\nshe is precluded from asserting that doctrines, which she has herself so\r\nlong and so ably sustained, are plain, palpable, and dangerous\r\nviolations of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMr. President, if the friends of nullification should be able to\r\npropagate their opinions, and give them practical effect, they would, in\r\nmy judgment, prove themselves the most skilful \"architects of ruin,\" the\r\nmost effectual extinguishers of high-raised expectation, the greatest\r\nblasters of human hopes, that any age has produced. They would stand up\r\nto proclaim, in tones which would pierce the ears of half the human\r\nrace, that the last great experiment of representative government had\r\nfailed. They would send forth sounds, at the hearing of which the\r\ndoctrine of the divine right of kings would feel, even in its grave, a\r\nreturning sensation of vitality and resuscitation. Millions of eyes, of\r\nthose who now feed their inherent love of liberty on the success of the\r\nAmerican example, would turn away from beholding our dismemberment, and\r\nfind no place on earth whereon to rest their gratified sight. Amidst the\r\nincantations and orgies of nullification, secession, disunion, and\r\nrevolution, would be celebrated the funeral rites of constitutional and\r\nrepublican liberty.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, if the government do its duty, if it act with firmness and\r\nwith moderation, these opinions cannot prevail. Be assured, Sir, be\r\nassured, that, among the political sentiments of this people, the love\r\nof union is still uppermost. They will stand fast by the Constitution,\r\nand by those who defend it. I rely on no temporary expedients, on no\r\npolitical combination; but I rely on the true American feeling, the\r\ngenuine patriotism of the people, and the imperative decision of the\r\npublic voice. Disorder and confusion, indeed, may arise; scenes of\r\ncommotion and contest are threatened, and perhaps may come. With my\r\nwhole heart, I pray for the continuance of the domestic peace and quiet\r\nof the country. I desire, most ardently, the restoration of affection\r\nand harmony to all its parts. I desire that every citizen of the whole\r\ncountry may look to this government with no other sentiments than those\r\nof grateful respect and attachment. But I cannot yield even to kind\r\nfeelings the cause of the Constitution, the true glory of the country,\r\nand the great trust which we hold in our hands for succeeding ages. If\r\nthe Constitution cannot be maintained without meeting these scenes of\r\ncommotion and contest, however unwelcome, they must come. We cannot, we\r\nmust not, we dare not, omit to do that which, in our judgment, the\r\nsafety of the Union requires. Not regardless of consequences, we must\r\nyet meet consequences; seeing the hazards which surround the discharge\r\nof public duty, it must yet be discharged. For myself, Sir, I shun no\r\nresponsibility justly devolving on me, here or elsewhere, in attempting\r\nto maintain the cause. I am bound to it by indissoluble ties of\r\naffection and duty, and I shall cheerfully partake in its fortunes and\r\nits fate. I am ready to perform my own appropriate part, whenever and\r\nwherever the occasion may call on me, and to take my chance among those\r\nupon whom blows may fall first and fall thickest. I shall exert every\r\nfaculty I possess in aiding to prevent the Constitution from being\r\nnullified, destroyed, or impaired; and even should I see it fall, I will\r\nstill, with a voice feeble, perhaps, but earnest as ever issued from\r\nhuman lips, and with fidelity and zeal which nothing shall extinguish,\r\ncall on the PEOPLE to come to its rescue.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Rives.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC DINNER AT NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nA SPEECH DELIVERED AT A PUBLIC DINNER GIVEN BY A LARGE NUMBER OF\r\nCITIZENS OF NEW YORK, IN HONOR OF MR. WEBSTER, ON MARCH 10TH, 1831.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In February, 1831, several distinguished gentlemen of the city of New\r\nYork, in behalf of themselves and a large number of other citizens,\r\ninvited Mr. Webster to a public dinner, as a mark of their respect for\r\nthe value and success of his efforts, in the preceding session of\r\nCongress, in defence of the Constitution of the United States. His\r\nspeech in reply to Mr. Hayne (contained in an earlier part of this\r\nvolume), which, by that time, had been circulated and read through the\r\ncountry to a greater extent than any speech ever before delivered in\r\nCongress, was the particular effort which led to this invitation.\r\n\r\nThe dinner took place at the City Hotel, on the 10th of March, and was\r\nattended by a very large assembly.\r\n\r\nChancellor Kent presided, and, in proposing to the company the health of\r\ntheir guest, made the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n     \"New England has been long fruitful in great men, the necessary\r\n     consequence of the admirable discipline of her institutions; and we\r\n     are this day honored with the presence of one of those cherished\r\n     objects of her attachment and pride, who has an undoubted and\r\n     peculiar title to our regard. It is a plain truth, that he who\r\n     defends the constitution of his country by his wisdom in council is\r\n     entitled to share her gratitude with those who protect it by valor\r\n     in the field. Peace has its victories as well as war. We all\r\n     recollect a late memorable occasion, when the exalted talents and\r\n     enlightened patriotism of the gentleman to whom I have alluded were\r\n     exerted in the support of our national Union and the sound\r\n     interpretation of its charter.\r\n\r\n     \"If there be any one political precept pre-eminent above all others\r\n     and acknowledged by all, it is that which dictates the absolute\r\n     necessity of a union of the States under one government, and that\r\n     government clothed with those attributes and powers with which the\r\n     existing Constitution has invested it. We are indebted, under\r\n     Providence, to the operation and influence of the powers of that\r\n     Constitution for our national honor abroad and for unexampled\r\n     prosperity at home. Its future stability depends upon the firm\r\n     support and due exercise of its legitimate powers in all their\r\n     branches. A tendency to disunion, to anarchy among the members\r\n     rather than to tyranny in the head, has been heretofore the\r\n     melancholy fate of all the federal governments of ancient and\r\n     modern Europe. Our Union and national Constitution were formed, as\r\n     we have hitherto been led to believe, under better auspices and\r\n     with improved wisdom. But there was a deadly principle of disease\r\n     inherent in the system. The assumption by any member of the Union\r\n     of the right to question and resist, or annul, as its own judgment\r\n     should dictate, either the laws of Congress, or the treaties, or\r\n     the decisions of the federal courts, or the mandates of the\r\n     executive power, duly made and promulgated as the Constitution\r\n     prescribes, was a most dangerous assumption of power, leading to\r\n     collision and the destruction of the system. And if, contrary to\r\n     all our expectations, we should hereafter fail in the grand\r\n     experiment of a confederate government extending over some of the\r\n     fairest portions of this continent, and destined to act, at the\r\n     same time, with efficiency and harmony, we should most grievously\r\n     disappoint the hopes of mankind, and blast for ever the fruits of\r\n     the Revolution.\r\n\r\n     \"But, happily for us, the refutation of such dangerous pretensions,\r\n     on the occasion referred to, was signal and complete. The false\r\n     images and delusive theories which had perplexed the thoughts and\r\n     disturbed the judgments of men, were then dissipated in like manner\r\n     as spectres disappear at the rising of the sun. The inestimable\r\n     value of the Union, and the true principles of the Constitution,\r\n     were explained by clear and accurate reasonings, and enforced by\r\n     pathetic and eloquent illustrations. The result was the more\r\n     auspicious, as the heretical doctrines which were then fairly\r\n     reasoned down had been advanced by a very respectable portion of\r\n     the Union, and urged on the floor of the Senate by the polished\r\n     mind, manly zeal, and honored name of a distinguished member from\r\n     the South.\r\n\r\n     \"The consequences of that discussion have been extremely\r\n     beneficial. It turned the attention of the public to the great\r\n     doctrines of national rights and national union. Constitutional law\r\n     ceased to remain wrapped up in the breasts, and taught only by the\r\n     responses, of the living oracles of the law. Socrates was said to\r\n     have drawn down philosophy from the skies, and scattered it among\r\n     the schools. It may with equal truth be said, that constitutional\r\n     law, by means of those senatorial discussions and the master genius\r\n     that guided them, was rescued from the archives of our tribunals\r\n     and the libraries of lawyers, and placed under the eye, and\r\n     submitted to the judgment, of the American people. _Their verdict\r\n     is with us, and from it, there lies no appeal._\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the immense cheering and acclamations with which this address\r\nand toast were received had subsided, Mr. Webster rose and addressed the\r\ncompany as follows.]\r\n\r\nI owe the honor of this occasion, Gentlemen, to your patriotic and\r\naffectionate attachment to the Constitution of our country. For an\r\neffort, well intended, however otherwise of unpretending character, made\r\nin the discharge of public duty, and designed to maintain the\r\nConstitution and vindicate its just powers, you have been pleased to\r\ntender me this token of your respect. It would be idle affectation to\r\ndeny that it gives me singular gratification. Every public man must\r\nnaturally desire the approbation of his fellow-citizens; and though it\r\nmay be supposed that I should be anxious, in the first place, not to\r\ndisappoint the expectations of those whose immediate representative I\r\nam, it is not possible but that I should feel, nevertheless, the high\r\nvalue of such a mark of esteem as is here offered. But, Gentlemen, I am\r\nconscious that the main purpose of this occasion is higher than mere\r\nmanifestation of personal regard. It is to evince your devotion to the\r\nConstitution, your sense of its transcendent value, and your just alarm\r\nat whatever threatens to weaken its proper authority, or endanger its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this could hardly be otherwise. It would be strange, indeed,\r\nif the members of this vast commercial community should not be first and\r\nforemost to rally for the Constitution, whenever opinions and doctrines\r\nare advanced hostile to its principles. Where sooner than here, where\r\nlouder than here, may we expect a patriotic voice to be raised, when the\r\nunion of the States is threatened? In this great emporium, at this\r\ncentral point of the united commerce of the United States, of all\r\nplaces, we may expect the warmest, the most determined and universal\r\nfeeling of attachment to the national government. Gentlemen, no one can\r\nestimate more highly than I do the natural advantages of your city. No\r\none entertains a higher opinion than myself, also, of that spirit of\r\nwise and liberal policy, which has actuated the government of your own\r\ngreat State in the accomplishment of high objects, important to the\r\ngrowth and prosperity both of the State and the city. But all these\r\nlocal advantages, and all this enlightened state policy, could never\r\nhave made your city what it now is, without the aid and protection of a\r\ngeneral government, extending over all the States, and establishing for\r\nall a common and uniform system of commercial regulation. Without\r\nnational character, without public credit, without systematic finance,\r\nwithout uniformity of commercial laws, all other advantages possessed by\r\nthis city would have decayed and perished, like unripe fruit. A general\r\ngovernment was, for years before it was instituted, the great object of\r\ndesire to the inhabitants of this city. New York, at a very early day,\r\nwas conscious of her local advantages for commerce; she saw her destiny,\r\nand was eager to embrace it; but nothing else than a general government\r\ncould make free her path before her, and set her forward on her\r\nbrilliant career. She early saw all this, and to the accomplishment of\r\nthis great and indispensable object she bent every faculty, and exerted\r\nevery effort. She was not mistaken. She formed no false judgment. At the\r\nmoment of the adoption of the Constitution, New York was the capital of\r\none State, and contained thirty-two or three thousand people. It now\r\ncontains more than two hundred thousand people, and is justly regarded\r\nas the commercial capital, not only of all the United States, but of the\r\nwhole continent also, from the pole to the South Sea. Every page of her\r\nhistory, for the last forty years, bears high and irresistible testimony\r\nto the benefits and blessings of the general government. Her astonishing\r\ngrowth is referred to, and quoted, all the world over, as one of the\r\nmost striking proofs of the effects of our Federal Union. To suppose her\r\nnow to be easy and indifferent, when notions are advanced tending to its\r\ndissolution, would be to suppose her equally forgetful of the past and\r\nblind to the present, alike ignorant of her own history and her own\r\ninterest, metamorphosed, from all that she has been, into a being tired\r\nof its prosperity, sick of its own growth and greatness, and infatuated\r\nfor its own destruction. Every blow aimed at the union of the States\r\nstrikes on the tenderest nerve of her interest and her happiness. To\r\nbring the Union into debate is to bring her own future prosperity into\r\ndebate also. To speak of arresting the laws of the Union, of interposing\r\nState power in matters of commerce and revenue, of weakening the full\r\nand just authority of the general government, would be, in regard to\r\nthis city, but another mode of speaking of commercial ruin, of abandoned\r\nwharfs, of vacated houses, of diminished and dispersing population, of\r\nbankrupt merchants, of mechanics without employment, and laborers\r\nwithout bread. The growth of this city and the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States are coevals and contemporaries. They began together, they\r\nhave flourished together, and if rashness and folly destroy one, the\r\nother will follow it to the tomb.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is true, indeed, that the growth of this city is\r\nextraordinary, and almost unexampled. It is now, I believe, sixteen or\r\nseventeen years since I first saw it. Within that comparatively short\r\nperiod, it has added to its number three times the whole amount of its\r\npopulation when the Constitution was adopted. Of all things having power\r\nto check this prosperity, of all things potent to blight and blast it,\r\nof all things capable of compelling this city to recede as fast as she\r\nhas advanced, a disturbed government, an enfeebled public authority, a\r\nbroken or a weakened union of the States, would be most efficacious.\r\nThis would be cause efficient enough. Every thing else, in the common\r\nfortune of communities, she may hope to resist or to prevent; but this\r\nwould be fatal as the arrow of death.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, you have personal recollections and associations, connected\r\nwith the establishment and adoption of the Constitution, which are\r\nnecessarily called up on an occasion like this. It is impossible to\r\nforget the prominent agency exercised by eminent citizens of your own,\r\nin regard to that great measure. Those great men are now recorded among\r\nthe illustrious dead; but they have left names never to be forgotten,\r\nand never to be remembered without respect and veneration. Least of all\r\ncan they be forgotten by you, when assembled here for the purpose of\r\nsignifying your attachment to the Constitution, and your sense of its\r\ninestimable importance to the happiness of the people.\r\n\r\nI should do violence to my own feelings, Gentlemen, I think I should\r\noffend yours, if I omitted respectful mention of distinguished names yet\r\nfresh in your recollections. How can I stand here, to speak of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, of the wisdom of its provisions, of\r\nthe difficulties attending its adoption, of the evils from which it\r\nrescued the country, and of the prosperity and power to which it has\r\nraised it, and yet pay no tribute to those who were highly instrumental\r\nin accomplishing the work? While we are here to rejoice that it yet\r\nstands firm and strong, while we congratulate one another that we live\r\nunder its benign influence, and cherish hopes of its long duration, we\r\ncannot forget who they were that, in the day of our national infancy, in\r\nthe times of despondency and despair, mainly assisted to work out our\r\ndeliverance. I should feel that I was unfaithful to the strong\r\nrecollections which the occasion presses upon us, that I was not true to\r\ngratitude, not true to patriotism, not true to the living or the dead,\r\nnot true to your feelings or my own, if I should forbear to make mention\r\nof ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nComing from the military service of the country yet a youth, but with\r\nknowledge and maturity, even in civil affairs far beyond his years, he\r\nmade this city the place of his adoption; and he gave the whole powers\r\nof his mind to the contemplation of the weak and distracted condition of\r\nthe country. Daily increasing in acquaintance and confidence with the\r\npeople of New York, he saw, what they also saw, the absolute necessity\r\nof some closer bond of union for the States. This was the great object\r\nof desire. He never appears to have lost sight of it, but was found in\r\nthe lead whenever any thing was to be attempted for its accomplishment.\r\nOne experiment after another, as is well known, was tried, and all\r\nfailed. The States were urgently called on to confer such further powers\r\non the old Congress as would enable it to redeem the public faith, or to\r\nadopt, themselves, some general and common principle of commercial\r\nregulation. But the States had not agreed, and were not likely to agree.\r\nIn this posture of affairs, so full of public difficulty and public\r\ndistress, commissioners from five or six of the States met, on the\r\nrequest of Virginia, at Annapolis, in September, 1786. The precise\r\nobject of their appointment was to take into consideration the trade of\r\nthe United States; to examine the relative situations and trade of the\r\nseveral States; and to consider how far a uniform system of commercial\r\nregulations was necessary to their common interest and permanent\r\nharmony. Mr. Hamilton was one of these commissioners; and I have\r\nunderstood, though I cannot assert the fact, that their report was drawn\r\nby him. His associate from this State was the venerable Judge Benson,\r\nwho has lived long, and still lives, to see the happy results of the\r\ncounsels which originated in this meeting. Of its members, he and Mr.\r\nMadison are, I believe, now the only survivors. These commissioners\r\nrecommended, what took place the next year, a general Convention of all\r\nthe States, to take into serious deliberation the condition of the\r\ncountry, and devise such provisions as should render the constitution of\r\nthe federal government adequate to the exigencies of the Union. I need\r\nnot remind you, that of this Convention Mr. Hamilton was an active and\r\nefficient member. The Constitution was framed, and submitted to the\r\ncountry. And then another great work was to be undertaken. The\r\nConstitution would naturally find, and did find, enemies and opposers.\r\nObjections to it were numerous, and powerful, and spirited. They were to\r\nbe answered; and they were effectually answered. The writers of the\r\nnumbers of the Federalist, Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Madison, and Mr. Jay, so\r\ngreatly distinguished themselves in their discussions of the\r\nConstitution, that those numbers are generally received as important\r\ncommentaries on the text, and accurate expositions, in general, of its\r\nobjects and purposes. Those papers were all written and published in\r\nthis city. Mr. Hamilton was elected one of the distinguished delegation\r\nfrom the city to the State Convention at Poughkeepsie, called to ratify\r\nthe new Constitution. Its debates are published. Mr. Hamilton appears to\r\nhave exerted, on this occasion, to the utmost, every power and faculty\r\nof his mind.\r\n\r\nThe whole question was likely to depend on the decision of New York. He\r\nfelt the full importance of the crisis; and the reports of his speeches,\r\nimperfect as they probably are, are yet lasting monuments to his genius\r\nand patriotism. He saw at last his hopes fulfilled; he saw the\r\nConstitution adopted, and the government under it established and\r\norganized. The discerning eye of Washington immediately called him to\r\nthat post, which was far the most important in the administration of the\r\nnew system. He was made Secretary of the Treasury; and how he fulfilled\r\nthe duties of such a place, at such a time, the whole country perceived\r\nwith delight and the whole world saw with admiration. He smote the rock\r\nof the national resources, and abundant streams of revenue gushed forth.\r\nHe touched the dead corpse of the Public Credit, and it sprung upon its\r\nfeet. The fabled birth of Minerva, from the brain of Jove, was hardly\r\nmore sudden or more perfect than the financial system of the United\r\nStates, as it burst forth from the conceptions of ALEXANDER HAMILTON.\r\n\r\nYour recollections, Gentlemen, your respect, and your affections, all\r\nconspire to bring before you, at such a time as this, another great man,\r\nnow too numbered with the dead. I mean the pure, the disinterested, the\r\npatriotic JOHN JAY. His character is a brilliant jewel in the sacred\r\ntreasures of national reputation. Leaving his profession at an early\r\nperiod, yet not before he had singularly distinguished himself in it,\r\nhis whole life, from the commencement of the Revolution until his final\r\nretirement, was a life of public service. A member of the first\r\nCongress, he was the author of that political paper which is generally\r\nacknowledged to stand first among the incomparable productions of that\r\nbody;[1] productions which called forth that decisive strain of\r\ncommendation from the great Lord Chatham, in which he pronounced them\r\nnot inferior to the finest productions of the master states of the\r\nworld. Mr. Jay had been abroad, and he had also been long intrusted with\r\nthe difficult duties of our foreign correspondence at home. He had seen\r\nand felt, in the fullest measure and to the greatest possible extent,\r\nthe difficulty of conducting our foreign affairs honorably and usefully,\r\nwithout a stronger and more perfect domestic union. Though not a member\r\nof the Convention which framed the Constitution, he was yet present\r\nwhile it was in session, and looked anxiously for its result. By the\r\nchoice of this city, he had a seat in the State Convention, and took an\r\nactive and zealous part for the adoption of the Constitution. On the\r\norganization of the new government, he was selected by Washington to be\r\nthe first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States; and\r\nsurely the high and most responsible duties of that station could not\r\nhave been trusted to abler or safer hands. It is the duty of that\r\ntribunal, one of equal importance and delicacy, to decide constitutional\r\nquestions, occasionally arising on State laws. The general learning and\r\nability, and especially the prudence, the mildness, and the firmness of\r\nhis character, eminently fitted Mr. Jay to be the head of such a court.\r\nWhen the spotless ermine of the judicial robe fell on John Jay, it\r\ntouched nothing less spotless than itself.\r\n\r\nThese eminent men, Gentlemen, the contemporaries of some of you, known\r\nto most, and revered by all, were so conspicuous in the framing and\r\nadopting of the Constitution, and called so early to important stations\r\nunder it, that a tribute, better, indeed, than I have given, or am able\r\nto give, seemed due to them from us, on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another, of whom mention is to be made. In the\r\nRevolutionary history of the country, the name of CHANCELLOR LIVINGSTON\r\nbecame early prominent. He was a member of that Congress which declared\r\nIndependence; and a member, too, of the committee which drew and\r\nreported the immortal Declaration. At the period of the adoption of the\r\nConstitution, he was its firm friend and able advocate. He was a member\r\nof the State Convention, being one of that list of distinguished and\r\ngifted men who represented this city in that body; and he threw the\r\nwhole weight of his talents and influence into the doubtful scale of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, as connected with the Constitution, you have also local\r\nrecollections which must bind it still closer to your attachment and\r\naffection. It commenced its being and its blessings here. It was in this\r\ncity, in the midst of friends, anxious, hopeful, and devoted, that the\r\nnew government started in its course. To us, Gentlemen, who are younger,\r\nit has come down by tradition; but some around me are old enough to have\r\nwitnessed, and did witness, the interesting scene of the first\r\ninauguration. They remember what voices of gratified patriotism, what\r\nshouts of enthusiastic hope, what acclamations rent the air, how many\r\neyes were suffused with tears of joy, how cordially each man pressed the\r\nhand of him who was next to him, when, standing in the open air, in the\r\ncentre of the city, in the view of assembled thousands, the first\r\nPresident of the United States was heard solemnly to pronounce the\r\nwords of his official oath, repeating them from the lips of Chancellor\r\nLivingston. You then thought, Gentlemen, that the great work of the\r\nRevolution was accomplished. You then felt that you had a government;\r\nthat the United States were then, indeed, united. Every benignant star\r\nseemed to shed its selectest influence on that auspicious hour. Here\r\nwere heroes of the Revolution; here were sages of the Convention; here\r\nwere minds, disciplined and schooled in all the various fortunes of the\r\ncountry, acting now in several relations, but all co-operating to the\r\nsame great end, the successful administration of the new and untried\r\nConstitution. And he,--how shall I speak of him?--he was at the head,\r\nwho was already first in war, who was already first in the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen, and who was now shown also, by the unanimous suffrage of the\r\ncountry, to be first in peace.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, how gloriously have the hopes then indulged been fulfilled!\r\nWhose expectation was then so sanguine, I may almost ask, whose\r\nimagination then so extravagant, as to run forward, and contemplate as\r\nprobable, the one half of what has been accomplished in forty years? Who\r\namong you can go back to 1789, and see what this city, and this country,\r\ntoo, then were; and, beholding what they now are, can be ready to\r\nconsent that the Constitution of the United States shall be\r\nweakened,--dishonored,--_nullified_?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, before I leave these pleasant recollections, I feel it an\r\nirresistible impulse of duty to pay a tribute of respect to another\r\ndistinguished person, not, indeed, a fellow-citizen of your own, but\r\nassociated with those I have already mentioned in important labors, and\r\nan early and indefatigable friend and advocate in the great cause of the\r\nConstitution. I refer to MR. MADISON. I am aware, Gentlemen, that a\r\ntribute of regard from me to him is of little importance; but if it\r\nshall receive your approbation and sanction, it will become of value.\r\nMr. Madison, thanks to a kind Providence, is yet among the living, and\r\nthere is certainly no other individual living, to whom the country is so\r\nmuch indebted for the blessings of the Constitution. He was one of the\r\ncommissioners who met at Annapolis, in 1786, to which meeting I have\r\nalready referred, and which, to the great credit of Virginia, had its\r\norigin in a proceeding of that State. He was a member of the Convention\r\nof 1787, and of that of Virginia in the following year. He was thus\r\nintimately acquainted with the whole progress of the formation of the\r\nConstitution, from its very first step to its final adoption. If ever\r\nman had the means of understanding a written instrument, Mr. Madison has\r\nthe means of understanding the Constitution. If it be possible to know\r\nwhat was designed by it, he can tell us. It was in this city, that, in\r\nconjunction with Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Jay, he wrote the numbers of the\r\nFederalist; and it was in this city that he commenced his brilliant\r\ncareer under the new Constitution, having been elected into the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the first Congress. The recorded votes and debates of\r\nthose times show his active and efficient agency in every important\r\nmeasure of that Congress. The necessary organization of the government,\r\nthe arrangement of the departments, and especially the paramount subject\r\nof revenue, engaged his attention, and divided his labors.\r\n\r\nThe legislative history of the first two or three years of the\r\ngovernment is full of instruction. It presents, in striking light, the\r\nevils intended to be remedied by the Constitution, and the provisions\r\nwhich were deemed essential to the remedy of those evils. It exhibits\r\nthe country, in the moment of its change from a weak and ill-defined\r\nconfederacy of States, into a general, efficient, but still restrained\r\nand limited government. It shows the first working of our peculiar\r\nsystem, moved, as it then was, by master hands.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, for one, I confess I like to dwell on this part of our\r\nhistory. It is good for us to be here. It is good for us to study the\r\nsituation of the country at this period, to survey its difficulties, to\r\nlook at the conduct of its public men, to see how they struggled with\r\nobstacles, real and formidable, and how gloriously they brought the\r\nUnion out of its state of depression and distress. Truly, Gentlemen,\r\nthese founders and fathers of the Constitution were great men, and\r\nthoroughly furnished for every good work. All that reading and learning\r\ncould do; all that talent and intelligence could do; and, what perhaps\r\nis still more, all that long experience in difficult and troubled times\r\nand a deep and intimate practical knowledge of the condition of the\r\ncountry could do,--conspired to fit them for the great business of\r\nforming a general, but limited government, embracing common objects,\r\nextending over all the States, and yet touching the power of the States\r\nno further than those common objects require. I confess I love to linger\r\naround these original fountains, and to drink deep of their waters. I\r\nlove to imbibe, in as full measure as I may, the spirit of those who\r\nlaid the foundations of the government, and so wisely and skilfully\r\nbalanced and adjusted its bearings and proportions.\r\n\r\nHaving been afterwards, for eight years, Secretary of State, and as long\r\nPresident, Mr. Madison has had an experience in the affairs of the\r\nConstitution, certainly second to no man. More than any other man\r\nliving, and perhaps more than any other who has lived, his whole public\r\nlife has been incorporated, as it were, into the Constitution; in the\r\noriginal conception and project of attempting to form it, in its actual\r\nframing, in explaining and recommending it, by speaking and writing, in\r\nassisting at the first organization of the government under it, and in a\r\nlong administration of its executive powers,--in these various ways he\r\nhas lived near the Constitution, and with the power of imbibing its true\r\nspirit, and inhaling its very breath, from its first pulsation of life.\r\nAgain, therefore, I ask, If he cannot tell us what the Constitution is,\r\nand what it means, who can? He had retired with the respect and regard\r\nof the community, and might naturally be supposed not willing to\r\ninterfere again in matters of political concern. He has, nevertheless,\r\nnot withholden his opinions on the vital question discussed on that\r\noccasion, which has caused this meeting. He has stated, with an accuracy\r\nalmost peculiar to himself, and so stated as, in my opinion, to place\r\nalmost beyond further controversy, the true doctrines of the\r\nConstitution. He has stated, not notions too loose and irregular to be\r\ncalled even a theory, not ideas struck out by the feeling of present\r\ninconvenience or supposed maladministration, not suggestions of\r\nexpediency, or evasions of fair and straightforward construction, but\r\nelementary principles, clear and sound distinctions, and indisputable\r\ntruths. I am sure, Gentlemen, that I speak your sentiments, as well as\r\nmy own, when I say, that, for making public so clearly and distinctly as\r\nhe has done his own opinions on these vital questions of constitutional\r\nlaw, Mr. Madison has founded a new and strong claim on the gratitude of\r\na grateful country. You will think, with me, that, at his advanced age,\r\nand in the enjoyment of general respect and approbation for a long\r\ncareer of public services, it was an act of distinguished patriotism,\r\nwhen he saw notions promulgated and maintained which he deemed unsound\r\nand dangerous, not to hesitate to come forward and to place the weight\r\nof his own opinion in what he deemed the right scale, come what come\r\nmight. I am sure, Gentlemen, it cannot be doubted,--the manifestation is\r\nclear,--that the country feels deeply the force of this new\r\nobligation.[2]\r\n\r\nGentlemen, what I have said of the benefits of the Constitution to your\r\ncity might be said, with little change, in respect to every other part\r\nof the country. Its benefits are not exclusive. What has it left undone,\r\nwhich any government could do, for the whole country? In what condition\r\nhas it placed us? Where do we now stand? Are we elevated, or degraded,\r\nby its operation? What is our condition under its influence, at the very\r\nmoment when some talk of arresting its power and breaking its unity? Do\r\nwe not feel ourselves on an eminence? Do we not challenge the respect of\r\nthe whole world? What has placed us thus high? What has given us this\r\njust pride? What else is it, but the unrestrained and free operation of\r\nthat same Federal Constitution, which it has been proposed now to\r\nhamper, and manacle, and nullify? Who is there among us, that, should he\r\nfind himself on any spot of the earth where human beings exist, and\r\nwhere the existence of other nations is known, would not be proud to\r\nsay, I am an American? I am a countryman of Washington? I am a citizen\r\nof that republic, which, although it has suddenly sprung up, yet there\r\nare none on the globe who have ears to hear, and have not heard of it;\r\nwho have eyes to see, and have not read of it; who know any thing, and\r\nyet do not know of its existence and its glory? And, Gentlemen, let me\r\nnow reverse the picture. Let me ask, who there is among us, if he were\r\nto be found to-morrow in one of the civilized countries of Europe, and\r\nwere there to learn that this goodly form of government had been\r\noverthrown, that the United States were no longer united, that a\r\ndeath-blow had been struck upon their bond of union, that they\r\nthemselves had destroyed their chief good and their chief honor,--who is\r\nthere whose heart would not sink within him? Who is there who would not\r\ncover his face for very shame?\r\n\r\nAt this very moment, Gentlemen, our country is a general refuge for the\r\ndistressed and the persecuted of other nations. Whoever is in affliction\r\nfrom political occurrences in his own country looks here for shelter.\r\nWhether he be republican, flying from the oppression of thrones, or\r\nwhether he be monarch or monarchist, flying from thrones that crumble\r\nand fall under or around him, he feels equal assurance, that, if he get\r\nfoothold on our soil, his person will be safe, and his rights will be\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\nAnd who will venture to say, that, in any government now existing in the\r\nworld, there is greater security for persons or property than in that of\r\nthe United States? We have tried these popular institutions in times of\r\ngreat excitement and commotion, and they have stood, substantially, firm\r\nand steady, while the fountains of the great political deep have been\r\nelsewhere broken up; while thrones, resting on ages of prescription,\r\nhave tottered and fallen; and while, in other countries, the earthquake\r\nof unrestrained popular commotion has swallowed up all law, and all\r\nliberty, and all right together. Our government has been tried in peace,\r\nand it has been tried in war, and has proved itself fit for both. It has\r\nbeen assailed from without, and it has successfully resisted the shock;\r\nit has been disturbed within, and it has effectually quieted the\r\ndisturbance. It can stand trial, it can stand assault, it can stand\r\nadversity, it can stand every thing, but the marring of its own beauty,\r\nand the weakening of its own strength. It can stand every thing but the\r\neffects of our own rashness and our own folly. It can stand every thing\r\nbut disorganization, disunion, and nullification.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking fact, and as true as it is striking, that at this very\r\nmoment, among all the principal civilized states of the world, _that_\r\ngovernment is most secure against the danger of popular commotion which\r\nis itself entirely popular. It seems, indeed, that the submission of\r\nevery thing to the public will, under constitutional restraints, imposed\r\nby the people themselves, furnishes itself security that they will\r\ndesire nothing wrong.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, that popular, constitutional liberty, as we enjoy it,\r\nappears, in the present state of the world, as sure and stable a basis\r\nfor government to rest upon, as any government of enlightened states can\r\nfind, or does find. Certain it is, that, in these times of so much\r\npopular knowledge, and so much popular activity, those governments which\r\ndo not admit the people to partake in their administration, but keep\r\nthem under and beneath, sit on materials for an explosion, which may\r\ntake place at any moment, and blow them into a thousand atoms.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, let any man who would degrade and enfeeble the national\r\nConstitution, let any man who would nullify its laws, stand forth and\r\ntell us what he would wish. What does he propose? Whatever he may be,\r\nand whatever substitute he may hold forth, I am sure the people of this\r\ncountry will decline his kind interference, and hold on by the\r\nConstitution which they possess. Any one who would willingly destroy it,\r\nI rejoice to know, would be looked upon with abhorrence. It is deeply\r\nintrenched in the regards of the people. Doubtless it may be undermined\r\nby artful and long-continued hostility; it may be imperceptibly weakened\r\nby secret attack; it may be insidiously shorn of its powers by slow\r\ndegrees; the public vigilance may be lulled, and when it awakes, it may\r\nfind the Constitution frittered away. In these modes, or some of them,\r\nit is possible that the union of the States may be dissolved.\r\n\r\nBut if the general attention of the people be kept alive, if they see\r\nthe intended mischief before it is effected, they will prevent it by\r\ntheir own sovereign power. They will interpose themselves between the\r\nmeditated blow and the object of their regard and attachment. Next to\r\nthe controlling authority of the people themselves, the preservation of\r\nthe government is mainly committed to those who administer it. If\r\nconducted in wisdom, it cannot but stand strong. Its genuine, original\r\nspirit is a patriotic, liberal, and generous spirit; a spirit of\r\nconciliation, of moderation, of candor, and charity; a spirit of\r\nfriendship, and not a spirit of hostility toward the States; a spirit\r\ncareful not to exceed, and equally careful not to relinquish, its just\r\npowers. While no interest can or ought to feel itself shut out from the\r\nbenefits of the Constitution, none should consider those benefits as\r\nexclusively its own. The interests of all must be consulted, and\r\nreconciled, and provided for, as far as possible, that all may perceive\r\nthe benefits of a united government.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, we are to remember that new States have arisen,\r\npossessing already an immense population, spreading and thickening over\r\nvast regions which were a wilderness when the Constitution was adopted.\r\nThose States are not, like New York, directly connected with maritime\r\ncommerce. They are entirely agricultural, and need markets for\r\nconsumption; and they need, too, access to those markets. It is the duty\r\nof the government to bring the interests of these new States into the\r\nUnion, and incorporate them closely in the family compact. Gentlemen, it\r\nis not impracticable to reconcile these various interests, and so to\r\nadminister the government as to make it useful to all. It was never\r\neasier to administer the government than it is now. We are beset with\r\nnone, or with few, of its original difficulties; and it is a time of\r\ngreat general prosperity and happiness. Shall we admit ourselves\r\nincompetent to carry on the government, so as to be satisfactory to the\r\nwhole country? Shall we admit that there has so little descended to us\r\nof the wisdom and prudence of our fathers? If the government could be\r\nadministered in Washington's time, when it was yet new, when the country\r\nwas heavily in debt, when foreign relations were in a threatening\r\ncondition, and when Indian wars pressed on the frontiers, can it not be\r\nadministered now? Let us not acknowledge ourselves so unequal to our\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, on the occasion referred to by the chair, it became necessary\r\nto consider the judicial power, and its proper functions under the\r\nConstitution. In every free and balanced government, this is a most\r\nessential and important power. Indeed, I think it is a remark of Mr.\r\nHume, that the administration of justice seems to be the leading object\r\nof institutions of government; that legislatures assemble, that armies\r\nare embodied, that both war and peace are made, with a sort of ultimate\r\nreference to the proper administration of laws, and the judicial\r\nprotection of private rights. The judicial power comes home to every\r\nman. If the legislature passes incorrect or unjust general laws, its\r\nmembers bear the evil as well as others. But judicature acts on\r\nindividuals. It touches every private right, every private interest, and\r\nalmost every private feeling. What we possess is hardly fit to be called\r\nour own, unless we feel secure in its possession; and this security,\r\nthis feeling of perfect safety, cannot exist under a wicked, or even\r\nunder a weak and ignorant, administration of the laws. There is no\r\nhappiness, there is no liberty, there is no enjoyment of life, unless a\r\nman can say when he rises in the morning, I shall be subject to the\r\ndecision of no unjust judge to-day.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, the judicial department, under the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, possesses still higher duties. It is true, that it may be\r\ncalled on, and is occasionally called on, to decide questions which are,\r\nin one sense, of a political nature. The general and State governments,\r\nboth established by the people, are established for different purposes,\r\nand with different powers. Between those powers questions may arise; and\r\nwho shall decide them? Some provision for this end is absolutely\r\nnecessary. What shall it be? This was the question before the\r\nConvention; and various schemes were suggested. It was foreseen that the\r\nStates might inadvertently pass laws inconsistent with the Constitution\r\nof the United States, or with acts of Congress. At least, laws might be\r\npassed which would be charged with such inconsistency. How should these\r\nquestions be disposed of? Where shall the power of judging, in cases of\r\nalleged interference, be lodged? One suggestion in the Convention was,\r\nto make it an executive power, and to lodge it in the hands of the\r\nPresident, by requiring all State laws to be submitted to him, that he\r\nmight negative such as he thought appeared repugnant to the general\r\nConstitution. This idea, perhaps, may have been borrowed from the power\r\nexercised by the crown over the laws of the Colonies. It would evidently\r\nhave been, not only an inconvenient and troublesome proceeding, but\r\ndangerous also to the powers of the States. It was not pressed. It was\r\nthought wiser and safer, on the whole, to require State legislatures and\r\nState judges to take an oath to support the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and then leave the States at liberty to pass whatever laws they\r\npleased, and if interference, in point of fact, should arise, to refer\r\nthe question to judicial decision. To this end, the judicial power,\r\nunder the Constitution of the United States, was made coextensive with\r\nthe legislative power. It was extended to all cases arising under the\r\nConstitution and the laws of Congress. The judiciary became thus\r\npossessed of the authority of deciding, in the last resort, in all cases\r\nof alleged interference, between State laws and the Constitution and\r\nlaws of Congress.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, this is the actual Constitution, this is the law of the land.\r\nThere may be those who think it unnecessary, or who would prefer a\r\ndifferent mode of deciding such questions. But this is the established\r\nmode, and, till it be altered, the courts can no more decline their duty\r\non these occasions than on other occasions. But can any reasonable man\r\ndoubt the expediency of this provision, or suggest a better? Is it not\r\nabsolutely essential to the peace of the country that this power should\r\nexist somewhere? Where can it exist, better than where it now does\r\nexist? The national judiciary is the common tribunal of the whole\r\ncountry. It is organized by the common authority, and its places filled\r\nby the common agent. This is a plain and practical provision. It was\r\nframed by no bunglers, nor by any wild theorists. And who can say that\r\nit has failed? Who can find substantial fault with its operation or its\r\nresults? The great question is, whether we shall provide for the\r\npeaceable decision of cases of collision. Shall they be decided by law,\r\nor by force? Shall the decisions be decisions of peace, or decisions of\r\nwar?\r\n\r\nOn the occasion which has given rise to this meeting, the proposition\r\ncontended for in opposition to the doctrine just stated was that every\r\nState, under certain supposed exigencies, and in certain supposed cases,\r\nmight decide for itself, and act for itself, and oppose its own force to\r\nthe execution of the laws. By what argument, do you imagine, Gentlemen,\r\nwas such a proposition maintained? I should call it metaphysical and\r\nsubtle; but these terms would imply at least ingenuity, and some degree\r\nof plausibility; whereas the argument appears to me plain assumption,\r\nmere perverse construction of plain language in the body of the\r\nConstitution itself. As I understand it, when put forth in its revised\r\nand most authentic shape, it is this: that the Constitution provides\r\nthat any amendments may be made to it which shall be agreed to by three\r\nfourths of the States; there is, therefore, to be nothing in the\r\nConstitution to which three fourths of the States have not agreed. All\r\nthis is true; but then comes this inference, namely, that, when one\r\nState denies the constitutionality of any law of Congress, she may\r\narrest its execution as to herself, and keep it arrested, till the\r\nStates can all be consulted by their conventions, and three fourths of\r\nthem shall have decided that the law is constitutional. Indeed, the\r\ninference is still stranger than this; for State conventions have no\r\nauthority to construe the Constitution, though they have authority to\r\namend it; therefore the argument must prove, if it prove any thing,\r\nthat, when any one State denies that any particular power is included in\r\nthe Constitution, it is to be considered as not included, and cannot be\r\nfound there till three fourths of the States agree to insert it. In\r\nshort, the result of the whole is, that, though it requires three\r\nfourths of the States to insert any thing in the Constitution, yet any\r\none State can strike any thing out of it. For the power to strike out,\r\nand the power of deciding, without appeal, upon the construction of what\r\nis already in, are substantially and practically the same.\r\n\r\nAnd, Gentlemen, what a spectacle should we have exhibited under the\r\nactual operation of notions like these! At the very moment when our\r\ngovernment was quoted, praised, and commended all over the world, when\r\nthe friends of republican liberty everywhere were gazing at it with\r\ndelight, and were in perfect admiration at the harmony of its movements,\r\none State steps forth, and, by the power of nullification, breaks up the\r\nwhole system, and scatters the bright chain of the Union into as many\r\nsundered links as there are separate States!\r\n\r\nSeeing the true grounds of the Constitution thus attacked, I raised my\r\nvoice in its favor, I must confess with no preparation or previous\r\nintention. I can hardly say that I embarked in the contest from a sense\r\nof duty. It was an instantaneous impulse of inclination, not acting\r\nagainst duty, I trust, but hardly waiting for its suggestions. I felt it\r\nto be a contest for the integrity of the Constitution, and I was ready\r\nto enter into it, not thinking, or caring, personally, how I might come\r\nout.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have true pleasure in saying that I trust the crisis has in\r\nsome measure passed by. The doctrines of nullification have received a\r\nsevere and stern rebuke from public opinion. The general reprobation of\r\nthe country has been cast upon them. Recent expressions of the most\r\nnumerous branch of the national legislature are decisive and imposing.\r\nEverywhere, the general tone of public feeling is for the Constitution.\r\nWhile much will be yielded--every thing, almost, but the integrity of\r\nthe Constitution, and the essential interests of the country--to the\r\ncause of mutual harmony and mutual conciliation, no ground can be\r\ngranted, not an inch, to menace and bluster. Indeed, menace and bluster,\r\nand the putting forth of daring, unconstitutional doctrines, are, at\r\nthis very moment, the chief obstacles to mutual harmony and satisfactory\r\naccommodation. Men cannot well reason, and confer, and take counsel\r\ntogether, about the discreet exercise of a power, with those who deny\r\nthat any such power rightfully exists, and who threaten to blow up the\r\nwhole Constitution if they cannot otherwise get rid of its operation. It\r\nis matter of sincere gratification, Gentlemen, that the voice of this\r\ngreat State has been so clear and strong, and her vote all but\r\nunanimous, on the most interesting of these occasions, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Certainly, such respect to the Union becomes New York.\r\nIt is consistent with her interests and her character. That singularly\r\nprosperous State, which now is, and is likely to continue to be, the\r\ngreatest link in the chain of the Union, will ever be, I am sure, the\r\nstrongest link also. The great States which lie in her neighborhood\r\nagreed with her fully in this matter. Pennsylvania, I believe, was loyal\r\nto the Union, to a man; and Ohio raises her voice, like that of a lion,\r\nagainst whatsoever threatens disunion and dismemberment. This harmony of\r\nsentiment is truly gratifying. It is not to be gainsaid, that the union\r\nof opinion in this great central mass of our population, on this\r\nmomentous point of the Constitution, augurs well for our future\r\nprosperity and security.\r\n\r\nI have said, Gentlemen, what I verily believe to be true, that there is\r\nno danger to the Union from open and avowed attacks on its essential\r\nprinciples. Nothing is to be feared from those who will march up boldly\r\nto their own propositions, and tell us that they mean to annihilate\r\npowers exercised by Congress. But, certainly, there are dangers to the\r\nConstitution, and we ought not to shut our eyes to them. We know the\r\nimportance of a firm and intelligent judiciary; but how shall we secure\r\nthe continuance of a firm and intelligent judiciary? Gentlemen, the\r\njudiciary is in the appointment of the executive power. It cannot\r\ncontinue or renew itself. Its vacancies are to be filled in the ordinary\r\nmodes of executive appointment. If the time shall ever come (which\r\nHeaven avert), when men shall be placed in the supreme tribunal of the\r\ncountry, who entertain opinions hostile to the just powers of the\r\nConstitution, we shall then be visited by an evil defying all remedy.\r\nOur case will be past surgery. From that moment the Constitution is at\r\nan end. If they who are appointed to defend the castle shall betray it,\r\nwoe betide those within! If I live to see that day come, I shall despair\r\nof the country. I shall be prepared to give it back to all its former\r\nafflictions in the days of the Confederation. I know no security against\r\nthe possibility of this evil, but an awakened public vigilance. I know\r\nno safety, but in that state of public opinion which shall lead it to\r\nrebuke and put down every attempt, either to gratify party by judicial\r\nappointments, or to dilute the Constitution by creating a court which\r\nshall construe away its provisions. If members of Congress betray their\r\ntrust, the people will find it out before they are ruined. If the\r\nPresident should at any time violate his duty, his term of office is\r\nshort, and popular elections may supply a seasonable remedy. But the\r\njudges of the Supreme Court possess, for very good reasons, an\r\nindependent tenure of office. No election reaches them. If, with this\r\ntenure, they betray their trusts, Heaven save us! Let us hope for better\r\nresults. The past, certainly, may encourage us. Let us hope that we\r\nshall never see the time when there shall exist such an awkward posture\r\nof affairs, as that the government shall be found in opposition to the\r\nConstitution, and when the guardians of the Union shall become its\r\nbetrayers.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, our country stands, at the present time, on commanding\r\nground. Older nations, with different systems of government, may be\r\nsomewhat slow to acknowledge all that justly belongs to us. But we may\r\nfeel without vanity, that America is doing her part in the great work of\r\nimproving human affairs. There are two principles, Gentlemen, strictly\r\nand purely American, which are now likely to prevail throughout the\r\ncivilized world. Indeed, they seem the necessary result of the progress\r\nof civilization and knowledge. These are, first, popular governments,\r\nrestrained by written constitutions; and, secondly, universal\r\neducation. Popular governments and general education, acting and\r\nreacting, mutually producing and reproducing each other, are the mighty\r\nagencies which in our days appear to be exciting, stimulating, and\r\nchanging civilized societies. Man, everywhere, is now found demanding a\r\nparticipation in government,--and he will not be refused; and he demands\r\nknowledge as necessary to self-government. On the basis of these two\r\nprinciples, liberty and knowledge, our own American systems rest. Thus\r\nfar we have not been disappointed in their results. Our existing\r\ninstitutions, raised on these foundations, have conferred on us almost\r\nunmixed happiness. Do we hope to better our condition by change? When we\r\nshall have nullified the present Constitution, what are we to receive in\r\nits place? As fathers, do we wish for our children better government, or\r\nbetter laws? As members of society, as lovers of our country, is there\r\nany thing we can desire for it better than that, as ages and centuries\r\nroll over it, it may possess the same invaluable institutions which it\r\nnow enjoys? For my part, Gentlemen, I can only say, that I desire to\r\nthank the beneficent Author of all good for being born _where_ I was\r\nborn, and _when_ I was born; that the portion of human existence\r\nallotted to me has been meted out to me in this goodly land, and at this\r\ninteresting period. I rejoice that I have lived to see so much\r\ndevelopment of truth, so much progress of liberty, so much diffusion of\r\nvirtue and happiness. And, through good report and evil report, it will\r\nbe my consolation to be a citizen of a republic unequalled in the annals\r\nof the world for the freedom of its institutions, its high prosperity,\r\nand the prospects of good which yet lie before it. Our course,\r\nGentlemen, is onward, straight onward, and forward. Let us not turn to\r\nthe right hand, nor to the left. Our path is marked out for us, clear,\r\nplain, bright, distinctly defined, like the milky way across the\r\nheavens. If we are true to our country, in our day and generation, and\r\nthose who come after us shall be true to it also, assuredly, assuredly,\r\nwe shall elevate her to a pitch of prosperity and happiness, of honor\r\nand power, never yet reached by any nation beneath the sun.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, before I resume my seat, a highly gratifying duty remains to\r\nbe performed. In signifying your sentiments of regard, you have kindly\r\nchosen to select as your organ for expressing them the eminent person[3]\r\nnear whom I stand. I feel, I cannot well say how sensibly, the manner in\r\nwhich he has seen fit to speak on this occasion. Gentlemen, if I may be\r\nsupposed to have made any attainment in the knowledge of constitutional\r\nlaw, he is among the masters in whose schools I have been taught. You\r\nsee near him a distinguished magistrate,[4] long associated with him in\r\njudicial labors, which have conferred lasting benefits and lasting\r\ncharacter, not only on the State, but on the whole country. Gentlemen, I\r\nacknowledge myself much their debtor. While yet a youth, unknown, and\r\nwith little expectation of becoming known beyond a very limited circle,\r\nI have passed days and nights, not of tedious, but of happy and\r\ngratified labor, in the study of the judicature of the State of New\r\nYork. I am most happy to have this public opportunity of acknowledging\r\nthe obligation, and of repaying it, as far as it can be repaid, by the\r\npoor tribute of my profound regard, and the earnest expression of my\r\nsincere respect.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I will no longer detain you than to propose a toast:--\r\n\r\nThe City of New York; herself the noblest eulogy on the Union of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Address to the People of Great Britain.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The reference is to Mr. Madison's letter on the subject of\r\n_Nullification_, in the North American Review, Vol. XXXI. p. 537.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Chancellor Kent, the presiding officer.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Judge Spencer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL VETO OF THE UNITED STATES BANK BILL.\r\n\r\nA SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, ON THE 11TH OF\r\nJULY, 1832, ON THE PRESIDENT'S VETO OF THE BANK BILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President,--No one will deny the high importance of the subject now\r\nbefore us. Congress, after full deliberation and discussion, has passed\r\na bill, by decisive majorities, in both houses, for extending the\r\nduration of the Bank of the United States. It has not adopted this\r\nmeasure until its attention had been called to the subject, in three\r\nsuccessive annual messages of the President. The bill having been thus\r\npassed by both houses, and having been duly presented to the President,\r\ninstead of signing and approving it, he has returned it with objections.\r\nThese objections go against the whole substance of the law originally\r\ncreating the bank. They deny, in effect, that the bank is\r\nconstitutional; they deny that it is expedient; they deny that it is\r\nnecessary for the public service.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be doubted, that the Constitution gives the President the\r\npower which he has now exercised; but while the power is admitted, the\r\ngrounds upon which it has been exerted become fit subjects of\r\nexamination. The Constitution makes it the duty of Congress, in cases\r\nlike this, to reconsider the measure which they have passed, to weigh\r\nthe force of the President's objections to that measure, and to take a\r\nnew vote upon the question.\r\n\r\nBefore the Senate proceeds to this second vote, I propose to make some\r\nremarks upon those objections. And, in the first place, it is to be\r\nobserved, that they are such as to extinguish all hope that the present\r\nbank, or any bank at all resembling it, or resembling any known similar\r\ninstitution, can ever receive his approbation. He states no terms, no\r\nqualifications, no conditions, no modifications, which can reconcile him\r\nto the essential provisions of the existing charter. He is against the\r\nbank, and against any bank constituted in a manner known either to this\r\nor any other country. One advantage, therefore, is certainly obtained by\r\npresenting him the bill. It has caused the President's sentiments to be\r\nmade known. There is no longer any mystery, no longer a contest between\r\nhope and fear, or between those prophets who predicted a _veto_ and\r\nthose who foretold an approval. The bill is negatived; the President has\r\nassumed the responsibility of putting an end to the bank; and the\r\ncountry must prepare itself to meet that change in its concerns which\r\nthe expiration of the charter will produce. Mr. President, I will not\r\nconceal my opinion that the affairs of the country are approaching an\r\nimportant and dangerous crisis. At the very moment of almost\r\nunparalleled general prosperity, there appears an unaccountable\r\ndisposition to destroy the most useful and most approved institutions of\r\nthe government. Indeed, it seems to be in the midst of all this national\r\nhappiness that some are found openly to question the advantages of the\r\nConstitution itself and many more ready to embarrass the exercise of its\r\njust power, weaken its authority, and undermine its foundations. How\r\nfar these notions may be carried, it is impossible yet to say. We have\r\nbefore us the practical result of one of them. The bank has fallen, or\r\nis to fall.\r\n\r\nIt is now certain, that, without a change in our public counsels, this\r\nbank will not be continued, nor will any other be established, which,\r\naccording to the general sense and language of mankind, can be entitled\r\nto the name. Within three years and nine months from the present moment,\r\nthe charter of the bank expires; within that period, therefore, it must\r\nwind up its concerns. It must call in its debts, withdraw its bills from\r\ncirculation, and cease from all its ordinary operations. All this is to\r\nbe done in three years and nine months; because, although there is a\r\nprovision in the charter rendering it lawful to use the corporate name\r\nfor two years after the expiration of the charter, yet this is allowed\r\nonly for the purpose of suits and for the sale of the estate belonging\r\nto the bank, and for no other purpose whatever. The whole active\r\nbusiness of the bank, its custody of public deposits, its transfer of\r\npublic moneys, its dealing in exchange, all its loans and discounts, and\r\nall its issues of bills for circulation, must cease and determine on or\r\nbefore the third day of March, 1836; and within the same period its\r\ndebts must be collected, as no new contract can be made with it, as a\r\ncorporation, for the renewal of loans, or discount of notes or bills,\r\nafter that time.\r\n\r\nThe President is of opinion, that this time is long enough to close the\r\nconcerns of the institution without inconvenience. His language is, \"The\r\ntime allowed the bank to close its concerns is ample, and if it has been\r\nwell managed, its pressure will be light, and heavy only in case its\r\nmanagement has been bad. If, therefore, it shall produce distress, the\r\nfault will be its own.\" Sir, this is all no more than general statement,\r\nwithout fact or argument to support it. We know what the management of\r\nthe bank has been, and we know the present state of its affairs. We can\r\njudge, therefore, whether it be probable that its capital can be all\r\ncalled in, and the circulation of its bills withdrawn, in three years\r\nand nine months, by any discretion or prudence in management, without\r\nproducing distress. The bank has discounted liberally, in compliance\r\nwith the wants of the community. The amount due to it on loans and\r\ndiscounts, in certain large divisions of the country, is great; so\r\ngreat, that I do not perceive how any man can believe that it can be\r\npaid, within the time now limited, without distress. Let us look at\r\nknown facts. Thirty millions of the capital of the bank are now out, on\r\nloans and discounts, in the States on the Mississippi and its waters;\r\nten millions of which are loaned on the discount of bills of exchange,\r\nforeign and domestic, and twenty millions on promissory notes. Now, Sir,\r\nhow is it possible that this vast amount can be collected in so short a\r\nperiod without suffering, by any management whatever? We are to\r\nremember, that, when the collection of this debt begins, at that same\r\ntime the existing medium of payment, that is, the circulation of the\r\nbills of the bank, will begin also to be restrained and withdrawn; and\r\nthus the means of payment must be limited just when the necessity of\r\nmaking payment becomes pressing. The whole debt is to be paid, and\r\nwithin the same time the whole circulation withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe local banks, where there are such, will be able to afford little\r\nassistance; because they themselves will feel a full share of the\r\npressure. They will not be in a condition to extend their discounts,\r\nbut, in all probability, obliged to curtail them. Whence, then, are the\r\nmeans to come for paying this debt? and in what medium is payment to be\r\nmade? If all this may be done with but slight pressure on the community,\r\nwhat course of conduct is to accomplish it? How is it to be done? What\r\nother thirty millions are to supply the place of these thirty millions\r\nnow to be called in? What other circulation or medium of payment is to\r\nbe adopted in the place of the bills of the bank? The message, following\r\na singular train of argument, which had been used in this house, has a\r\nloud lamentation upon the suffering of the Western States on account of\r\ntheir being obliged to pay even interest on this debt. This payment of\r\ninterest is itself represented as exhausting their means and ruinous to\r\ntheir prosperity. But if the interest cannot be paid without pressure,\r\ncan both interest and principal be paid in four years without pressure?\r\nThe truth is, the interest has been paid, is paid, and may continue to\r\nbe paid, without any pressure at all; because the money borrowed is\r\nprofitably employed by those who borrow it, and the rate of interest\r\nwhich they pay is at least two per cent lower than the actual value of\r\nmoney in that part of the country. But to pay the whole principal in\r\nless than four years, losing, at the same time, the existing and\r\naccustomed means and facilities of payment created by the bank itself,\r\nand to do this without extreme embarrassment, without absolute distress,\r\nis, in my judgment, impossible. I hesitate not to say, that, as this\r\n_veto_ travels to the West, it will depreciate the value of every man's\r\nproperty from the Atlantic States to the capital of Missouri. Its\r\neffects will be felt in the price of lands, the great and leading\r\narticle of Western property, in the price of crops, in the products of\r\nlabor, in the repression of enterprise, and in embarrassment to every\r\nkind of business and occupation. I state this opinion strongly, because\r\nI have no doubt of its truth, and am willing its correctness should be\r\njudged by the event. Without personal acquaintance with the Western\r\nStates, I know enough of their condition to be satisfied that what I\r\nhave predicted must happen. The people of the West are rich, but their\r\nriches consist in their immense quantities of excellent land, in the\r\nproducts of these lands, and in their spirit of enterprise. The actual\r\nvalue of money, or rate of interest, with them is high, because their\r\npecuniary capital bears little proportion to their landed interest. At\r\nan average rate, money is not worth less than eight per cent per annum\r\nthroughout the whole Western country, notwithstanding that it has now a\r\nloan or an advance from the bank of thirty millions, at six per cent. To\r\ncall in this loan, at the rate of eight millions a year, in addition to\r\nthe interest on the whole, and to take away, at the same time, that\r\ncirculation which constitutes so great a portion of the medium of\r\npayment throughout that whole region, is an operation, which, however\r\nwisely conducted, cannot but inflict a blow on the community of\r\ntremendous force and frightful consequences. The thing cannot be done\r\nwithout distress, bankruptcy, and ruin, to many. If the President had\r\nseen any practical manner in which this change might be effected without\r\nproducing these consequences, he would have rendered infinite service to\r\nthe community by pointing it out. But he has pointed out nothing, he has\r\nsuggested nothing; he contents himself with saying, without giving any\r\nreason, that, if the pressure be heavy, the fault will be the bank's. I\r\nhope this is not merely an attempt to forestall opinion, and to throw on\r\nthe bank the responsibility of those evils which threaten the country,\r\nfor the sake of removing it from himself.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility justly lies with him, and there it ought to remain. A\r\ngreat majority of the people are satisfied with the bank as it is, and\r\ndesirous that it should be continued. They wished no change. The\r\nstrength of this public sentiment has carried the bill through Congress,\r\nagainst all the influence of the administration, and all the power of\r\norganized party. But the President has undertaken, on his own\r\nresponsibility, to arrest the measure, by refusing his assent to the\r\nbill. He is answerable for the consequences, therefore, which\r\nnecessarily follow the change which the expiration of the bank charter\r\nmay produce; and if these consequences shall prove disastrous, they can\r\nfairly be ascribed to his policy only, and the policy of his\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nAlthough, Sir, I have spoken of the effects of this _veto_ in the\r\nWestern country, it has not been because I considered that part of the\r\nUnited States exclusively affected by it. Some of the Atlantic States\r\nmay feel its consequences, perhaps, as sensibly as those of the West,\r\nthough not for the same reasons. The concern manifested by Pennsylvania\r\nfor the renewal of the charter shows her sense of the importance of the\r\nbank to her own interest, and that of the nation. That great and\r\nenterprising State has entered into an extensive system of internal\r\nimprovements, which necessarily makes heavy demands on her credit and\r\nher resources; and by the sound and acceptable currency which the bank\r\naffords, by the stability which it gives to private credit, and by\r\noccasional advances, made in anticipation of her revenues, and in aid of\r\nher great objects, she has found herself benefited, doubtless, in no\r\ninconsiderable degree. Her legislature has instructed her Senators here\r\nto advocate the renewal of the charter, at this session. They have\r\nobeyed her voice, and yet they have the misfortune to find that, in the\r\njudgment of the President, _the measure is unconstitutional,\r\nunnecessary, dangerous to liberty, and is, moreover, ill-timed_.\r\n\r\nBut, Mr. President, it is not the local interest of the West, nor the\r\nparticular interest of Pennsylvania, or any other State, which has\r\ninfluenced Congress in passing this bill. It has been governed by a wise\r\nforesight, and by a desire to avoid embarrassment in the pecuniary\r\nconcerns of the country, to secure the safe collection and convenient\r\ntransmission of public moneys, to maintain the circulation of the\r\ncountry, sound and safe as it now happily is, against the possible\r\neffects of a wild spirit of speculation. Finding the bank highly useful,\r\nCongress has thought fit to provide for its continuance.\r\n\r\nAs to the _time_ of passing this bill, it would seem to be the last\r\nthing to be thought of, as a ground of objection, by the President;\r\nsince, from the date of his first message to the present time, he has\r\nnever failed to call our attention to the subject with all possible\r\napparent earnestness. So early as December, 1829, in his message to the\r\ntwo houses, he declares, that he \"cannot, in justice to the parties\r\ninterested, too soon present the subject to the deliberate consideration\r\nof the legislature, in order to avoid the evils resulting from\r\nprecipitancy, in a measure involving such important principles and such\r\ndeep pecuniary interests.\" Aware of this early invitation given to\r\nCongress to take up the subject, by the President himself, the writer of\r\nthe message seems to vary the ground of objection, and, instead of\r\ncomplaining that the time of bringing forward this measure was\r\npremature, to insist, rather, that, after the report of the committee of\r\nthe other house, the bank should have withdrawn its application for the\r\npresent! But that report offers no just ground, surely, for such\r\nwithdrawal. The subject was before Congress; it was for Congress to\r\ndecide upon it, with all the light shed by the report; and the question\r\nof postponement, having been made in both houses, was lost, by clear\r\nmajorities, in each. Under such circumstances, it would have been\r\nsomewhat singular, to say the least, if the bank itself had withdrawn\r\nits application. It is indeed known to everybody, that neither the\r\nreport of the committee, nor any thing contained in that report, was\r\nrelied on by the opposers of the renewal. If it has been discovered\r\nelsewhere, that that report contained matter important in itself, or\r\nwhich should have led to further inquiry, this may be proof of superior\r\nsagacity; for certainly no such thing was discerned by either house of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, do we not now see that it was time, and high time, to press\r\nthis bill, and to send it to the President? Does not the event teach us,\r\nthat the measure was not brought forward one moment too early? The time\r\nhad come when the people wished to know the decision of the\r\nadministration on the question of the bank? Why conceal it, or postpone\r\nits declaration? Why, as in regard to the tariff, give out one set of\r\nopinions for the North, and another for the South?\r\n\r\nAn important election is at hand, and the renewal of the bank charter is\r\na pending object of great interest, and some excitement. Should not the\r\nopinions of men high in office, and candidates for re-election, be\r\nknown on this, as on other important public questions? Certainly, it is\r\nto be hoped that the people of the United States are not yet mere\r\nman-worshippers, that they do not choose their rulers without some\r\nregard to their political principles, or political opinions. Were they\r\nto do this, it would be to subject themselves voluntarily to the evils\r\nwhich the hereditary transmission of power, independent of all personal\r\nqualifications, inflicts on other nations. They will judge their public\r\nservants by their acts, and continue or withhold their confidence, as\r\nthey shall think it merited, or as they shall think it forfeited. In\r\nevery point of view, therefore, the moment had arrived, when it became\r\nthe duty of Congress to come to a result, in regard to this highly\r\nimportant measure. The interests of the government, the interests of the\r\npeople, the clear and indisputable voice of public opinion, all called\r\nupon Congress to act without further loss of time. It has acted, and its\r\nact has been negatived by the President; and this result of the\r\nproceedings here places the question, with all its connections and all\r\nits incidents, fully before the people.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the constitutional question, there are some other\r\ntopics, treated in the message, which ought to be noticed. It commences\r\nby an inflamed statement of what it calls the \"favor\" bestowed upon the\r\noriginal bank by the government, or, indeed, as it is phrased, the\r\n\"monopoly of its favor and support\"; and through the whole message all\r\npossible changes are rung on the \"gratuity,\" the \"exclusive privileges,\"\r\nand \"monopoly,\" of the bank charter. Now, Sir, the truth is, that the\r\npowers conferred on the bank are such, and no others, as are usually\r\nconferred on similar institutions. They constitute no monopoly, although\r\nsome of them are of necessity, and with propriety, exclusive privileges.\r\n\"The original act,\" says the message, \"operated as a gratuity of many\r\nmillions to the stockholders.\" What fair foundation is there for this\r\nremark? The stockholders received their charter, not gratuitously, but\r\nfor a valuable consideration in money, prescribed by Congress, and\r\nactually paid. At some times the stock has been above _par_, at other\r\ntimes below _par_, according to prudence in management, or according to\r\ncommercial occurrences. But if, by a judicious administration of its\r\naffairs, it had kept its stock always above _par_, what pretence would\r\nthere be, nevertheless, for saying that such augmentation of its value\r\nwas a \"gratuity\" from government? The message proceeds to declare, that\r\nthe present act proposes another donation, another gratuity, to the same\r\nmen, of at least seven millions more. It seems to me that this is an\r\nextraordinary statement, and an extraordinary style of argument, for\r\nsuch a subject and on such an occasion. In the first place, the facts\r\nare all assumed; they are taken for true without evidence. There are no\r\nproofs that any benefit to that amount will accrue to the stockholders,\r\nnor any experience to justify the expectation of it. It rests on random\r\nestimates, or mere conjecture. But suppose the continuance of the\r\ncharter should prove beneficial to the stockholders; do they not pay for\r\nit? They give twice as much for a charter of fifteen years, as was given\r\nbefore for one of twenty. And if the proposed _bonus_, or premium, be\r\nnot, in the President's judgment, large enough, would he, nevertheless,\r\non such a mere matter of opinion as that, negative the whole bill? May\r\nnot Congress be trusted to decide even on such a subject as the amount\r\nof the money premium to be received by government for a charter of this\r\nkind?\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, there is a larger and a much more just view of this subject.\r\nThe bill was not passed for the purpose of benefiting the present\r\nstockholders. Their benefit, if any, is incidental and collateral. Nor\r\nwas it passed on any idea that they had a _right_ to a renewed charter,\r\nalthough the message argues against such right, as if it had been\r\nsomewhere set up and asserted. No such right has been asserted by\r\nanybody. Congress passed the bill, not as a bounty or a favor to the\r\npresent stockholders, nor to comply with any demand of right on their\r\npart; but to promote great public interests, for great public objects.\r\nEvery bank must have some stockholders, unless it be such a bank as the\r\nPresident has recommended, and in regard to which he seems not likely to\r\nfind much concurrence of other men's opinions; and if the stockholders,\r\nwhoever they may be, conduct the affairs of the bank prudently, the\r\nexpectation is always, of course, that they will make it profitable to\r\nthemselves, as well as useful to the public. If a bank charter is not to\r\nbe granted, because, to some extent, it may be profitable to the\r\nstockholders, no charter can be granted. The objection lies against all\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\nSir, the object aimed at by such institutions is to connect the public\r\nsafety and convenience with private interests. It has been found by\r\nexperience, that banks are safest under private management, and that\r\ngovernment banks are among the most dangerous of all inventions. Now,\r\nSir, the whole drift of the message is to reverse the settled judgment\r\nof all the civilized world, and to set up government banks, independent\r\nof private interest or private control. For this purpose the message\r\nlabors, even beyond the measure of all its other labors, to create\r\njealousies and prejudices, on the ground of the alleged benefit which\r\nindividuals will derive from the renewal of this charter. Much less\r\neffort is made to show that government, or the public, will be injured\r\nby the bill, than that individuals will profit by it. Following up the\r\nimpulses of the same spirit, the message goes on gravely to allege, that\r\nthe act, as passed by Congress, proposes to make a _present_ of some\r\nmillions of dollars to foreigners, because a portion of the stock is\r\nheld by foreigners. Sir, how would this sort of argument apply to other\r\ncases? The President has shown himself not only willing, but anxious, to\r\npay off the three per cent stock of the United States at _par_,\r\nnotwithstanding that it is notorious that foreigners are owners of the\r\ngreater part of it. Why should he not call that a donation to foreigners\r\nof many millions?\r\n\r\nI will not dwell particularly on this part of the message. Its tone and\r\nits arguments are all in the same strain. It speaks of the certain gain\r\nof the present stockholders, of the value of the monopoly; it says that\r\nall monopolies are granted at the expense of the public; that the many\r\nmillions which this bill bestows on the stockholders come out of the\r\nearnings of the people; that, if government sells monopolies, it ought\r\nto sell them in open market; that it is an erroneous idea, that the\r\npresent stockholders have a prescriptive right either to the favor or\r\nthe bounty of government; that the stock is in the hands of a few, and\r\nthat the whole American people are excluded from competition in the\r\npurchase of the monopoly. To all this I say, again, that much of it is\r\nassumption without proof; much of it is an argument against that which\r\nnobody has maintained or asserted; and the rest of it would be equally\r\nstrong against any charter, at any time. These objections existed in\r\ntheir full strength, whatever that was, against the first bank. They\r\nexisted, in like manner, against the present bank at its creation, and\r\nwill always exist against all banks. Indeed, all the fault found with\r\nthe bill now before us is, that it proposes to continue the bank\r\nsubstantially as it now exists. \"All the objectionable principles of the\r\nexisting corporation,\" says the message, \"and most of its odious\r\nfeatures, are retained without alleviation\"; so that the message is\r\naimed against the bank, as it has existed from the first, and against\r\nany and all others resembling it in its general features.\r\n\r\nAllow me, now, Sir, to take notice of an argument founded on the\r\npractical operation of the bank. That argument is this. Little of the\r\nstock of the bank is held in the West, the capital being chiefly owned\r\nby citizens of the Southern and Eastern States, and by foreigners. But\r\nthe Western and Southwestern States owe the bank a heavy debt, so heavy\r\nthat the interest amounts to a million six hundred thousand a year. This\r\ninterest is carried to the Eastern States, or to Europe, annually, and\r\nits payment is a burden on the people of the West, and a drain of their\r\ncurrency, which no country can bear without inconvenience and distress.\r\nThe true character and the whole value of this argument are manifest by\r\nthe mere statement of it. The people of the West are, from their\r\nsituation, necessarily large borrowers. They need money, capital, and\r\nthey borrow it, because they can derive a benefit from its use, much\r\nbeyond the interest which they pay. They borrow at six per cent of the\r\nbank, although the value of money with them is at least as high as\r\neight. Nevertheless, although they borrow at this low rate of interest,\r\nand although they use all they borrow thus profitably, yet they cannot\r\npay the interest without \"inconvenience and distress\"; and then, Sir,\r\nfollows the logical conclusion, that, although they cannot pay even the\r\ninterest without inconvenience and distress, yet less than four years is\r\nample time for the bank to call in the whole, both principal and\r\ninterest, without causing more than a light pressure. This is the\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nThen follows another, which may be thus stated. It is competent to the\r\nStates to tax the property of their citizens vested in the stock of this\r\nbank; but the power is denied of taxing the stock of foreigners;\r\ntherefore the stock will be worth ten or fifteen per cent more to\r\nforeigners than to residents, and will of course inevitably leave the\r\ncountry, and make the American people debtors to aliens in nearly the\r\nwhole amount due the bank, and send across the Atlantic from two to five\r\nmillions of specie every year, to pay the bank dividends.\r\n\r\nMr. President, arguments like these might be more readily disposed of,\r\nwere it not that the high and official source from which they proceed\r\nimposes the necessity of treating them with respect. In the first place,\r\nit may safely be denied that the stock of the bank is any more valuable\r\nto foreigners than to our own citizens, or an object of greater desire\r\nto them, except in so far as capital may be more abundant in the foreign\r\ncountry, and therefore its owners more in want of opportunity of\r\ninvestment. The foreign stockholder enjoys no exemption from taxation.\r\nHe is, of course, taxed by his own government for his incomes, derived\r\nfrom this as well as other property; and this is a full answer to the\r\nwhole statement. But it may be added, in the second place, that it is\r\nnot the practice of civilized states to tax the property of foreigners\r\nunder such circumstances. Do we tax, or did we ever tax, the foreign\r\nholders of our public debt? Does Pennsylvania, New York, or Ohio tax the\r\nforeign holders of stock in the loans contracted by either of these\r\nStates? Certainly not. Sir, I must confess I had little expected to see,\r\non such an occasion as the present, a labored and repeated attempt to\r\nproduce an impression on the public opinion unfavorable to the bank,\r\nfrom the circumstance that foreigners are among its stockholders. I have\r\nno hesitation in saying, that I deem such a train of remark as the\r\nmessage contains on this point, coming from the President of the United\r\nStates, to be injurious to the credit and character of the country\r\nabroad; because it manifests a jealousy, a lurking disposition not to\r\nrespect the property, of foreigners invited hither by our own laws. And,\r\nSir, what is its tendency but to excite this jealousy, and create\r\ngroundless prejudices?\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the government, it has been thought desirable\r\nto invite, rather than to repel, the introduction of foreign capital.\r\nOur stocks have all been open to foreign subscriptions; and the State\r\nbanks, in like manner, are free to foreign ownership. Whatever State has\r\ncreated a debt has been willing that foreigners should become\r\npurchasers, and desirous of it. How long is it, Sir, since Congress\r\nitself passed a law vesting new powers in the President of the United\r\nStates over the cities in this District, for the very purpose of\r\nincreasing their credit abroad, the better to enable them to borrow\r\nmoney to pay their subscriptions to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal? It is\r\neasy to say that there is danger to liberty, danger to independence, in\r\na bank open to foreign stockholders, because it is easy to say any\r\nthing. But neither reason nor experience proves any such danger. The\r\nforeign stockholder cannot be a director. He has no voice even in the\r\nchoice of directors. His money is placed entirely in the management of\r\nthe directors appointed by the President and Senate and by the American\r\nstockholders. So far as there is dependence or influence either way, it\r\nis to the disadvantage of the foreign stockholder. He has parted with\r\nthe control over his own property, instead of exercising control over\r\nthe property or over the actions of others. And, Sir, let it now be\r\nadded, in further answer to this class of objections, that experience\r\nhas abundantly confuted them all. This government has existed\r\nforty-three years, and has maintained, in full being and operation, a\r\nbank, such as is now proposed to be renewed, for thirty-six years out of\r\nthe forty-three. We have never for a moment had a bank not subject to\r\nevery one of these objections. Always, foreigners might be stockholders;\r\nalways, foreign stock has been exempt from State taxation, as much as at\r\npresent; always, the same power and privileges; always, all that which\r\nis now called a \"monopoly,\" a \"gratuity,\" a \"present,\" have been\r\npossessed by the bank. And yet there has been found no danger to\r\nliberty, no introduction of foreign influence, and no accumulation of\r\nirresponsible power in a few hands. I cannot but hope, therefore, that\r\nthe people of the United States will not now yield up their judgment to\r\nthose notions which would reverse all our best experience, and persuade\r\nus to discontinue a useful institution from the influence of vague and\r\nunfounded declamation against its danger to the public liberties. Our\r\nliberties, indeed, must stand upon very frail foundations, if the\r\ngovernment cannot, without endangering them, avail itself of those\r\ncommon facilities, in the collection of its revenues and the management\r\nof its finances, which all other governments, in commercial countries,\r\nfind useful and necessary.\r\n\r\nIn order to justify its alarm for the security of our independence, the\r\nmessage supposes a case. It supposes that the bank should pass\r\nprincipally into the hands of the subjects of a foreign country, and\r\nthat we should be involved in war with that country, and then it\r\nexclaims, \"What would be our condition?\" Why, Sir, it is plain that all\r\nthe advantages would be on our side. The bank would still be our\r\ninstitution, subject to our own laws, and all its directors elected by\r\nourselves; and our means would be enhanced, not by the confiscation and\r\nplunder, but by the proper use, of the foreign capital in our hands.\r\nAnd, Sir, it is singular enough that this very state of war, from which\r\nthis argument against a bank is drawn, is the very thing which, more\r\nthan all others, convinced the country and the government of the\r\nnecessity of a national bank. So much was the want of such an\r\ninstitution felt in the late war, that the subject engaged the attention\r\nof Congress, constantly, from the declaration of that war down to the\r\ntime when the existing bank was actually established; so that in this\r\nrespect, as well as in others, the argument of the message is directly\r\nopposed to the whole experience of the government, and to the general\r\nand long-settled convictions of the country.\r\n\r\nI now proceed, Sir, to a few remarks upon the President's constitutional\r\nobjections to the bank; and I cannot forbear to say, in regard to them,\r\nthat he appears to me to have assumed very extraordinary grounds of\r\nreasoning. He denies that the constitutionality of the bank is a settled\r\nquestion. If it be not, will it ever become so, or what disputed\r\nquestion ever can be settled? I have already observed, that for\r\nthirty-six years out of the forty-three during which the government has\r\nbeen in being, a bank has existed, such as is now proposed to be\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1791, after great deliberation, the first bank charter was\r\npassed by Congress, and approved by President Washington. It established\r\nan institution, resembling, in all things now objected to, the present\r\nbank. That bank, like this, could take lands in payment of its debts;\r\nthat charter, like the present, gave the States no power of taxation; it\r\nallowed foreigners to hold stock; it restrained Congress from creating\r\nother banks. It gave also exclusive privileges, and in all particulars\r\nit was, according to the doctrine of the message, as objectionable as\r\nthat now existing. That bank continued twenty years. In 1816, the\r\npresent institution was established, and has been ever since in full\r\noperation. Now, Sir, the question of the power of Congress to create\r\nsuch institutions has been contested in every manner known to our\r\nConstitution and laws. The forms of the government furnish no new mode\r\nin which to try this question. It has been discussed over and over\r\nagain, in Congress; it has been argued and solemnly adjudged in the\r\nSupreme Court; every President, except the present, has considered it a\r\nsettled question; many of the State legislatures have instructed their\r\nSenators to vote for the bank; the tribunals of the States, in every\r\ninstance, have supported its constitutionality; and, beyond all doubt\r\nand dispute, the general public opinion of the country has at all times\r\ngiven, and does now give, its full sanction and approbation to the\r\nexercise of this power, as being a constitutional power. There has been\r\nno opinion questioning the power expressed or intimated, at any time, by\r\neither house of Congress, by any President, or by any respectable\r\njudicial tribunal. Now, Sir, if this practice of near forty years, if\r\nthese repeated exercises of the power, if this solemn adjudication of\r\nthe Supreme Court, with the concurrence and approbation of public\r\nopinion, do not settle the question, how is any question ever to be\r\nsettled, about which any one may choose to raise a doubt?\r\n\r\nThe argument of the message upon the Congressional precedents is either\r\na bold and gross fallacy, or else it is an assertion without proofs, and\r\nagainst known facts. The message admits, that, in 1791, Congress decided\r\nin favor of a bank; but it adds, that another Congress, in 1811, decided\r\nagainst it. Now, if it be meant that, in 1811, Congress decided against\r\nthe bank on constitutional ground, then the assertion is wholly\r\nincorrect, and against notorious fact. It is perfectly well known, that\r\nmany members, in both houses, voted against the bank in 1811, who had no\r\ndoubt at all of the constitutional power of Congress. They were entirely\r\ngoverned by other reasons given at the time. I appeal, Sir, to the\r\nhonorable member from Maryland, who was then a member of the Senate, and\r\nvoted against the bank, whether he, and others who were on the same\r\nside, did not give those votes on other well-known grounds, and not at\r\nall on constitutional ground?\r\n\r\n     General Smith here rose, and said, that he voted against the bank\r\n     in 1811, but not at all on constitutional grounds, and had no doubt\r\n     such was the case with other members.\r\n\r\nWe all know, Sir, the fact to be as the gentleman from Maryland has\r\nstated it. Every man who recollects, or who has read, the political\r\noccurrences of that day, knows it. Therefore, if the message intends to\r\nsay, that in 1811 Congress denied the existence of any such\r\nconstitutional power, the declaration is unwarranted, and altogether at\r\nvariance with the facts. If, on the other hand, it only intends to say,\r\nthat Congress decided against the proposition then before it on some\r\nother grounds, then it alleges that which is nothing at all to the\r\npurpose. The argument, then, either assumes for truth that which is not\r\ntrue, or else the whole statement is immaterial and futile.\r\n\r\nBut whatever value others may attach to this argument, the message\r\nthinks so highly of it, that it proceeds to repeat it. \"One Congress,\"\r\nit says, \"in 1815, decided against a bank, another, in 1816, decided in\r\nits favor. There is nothing in precedent, therefore, which, if its\r\nauthority were admitted, ought to weigh in favor of the act before me.\"\r\nNow, Sir, since it is known to the whole country, one cannot but wonder\r\nhow it should remain unknown to the President, that Congress _did not_\r\ndecide against a bank in 1815. On the contrary, that very Congress\r\npassed a bill for erecting a bank, by very large majorities. In one\r\nform, it is true, the bill failed in the House of Representatives; but\r\nthe vote was reconsidered, the bill recommitted, and finally passed by a\r\nvote of one hundred and twenty to thirty-nine. There is, therefore, not\r\nonly no solid ground, but not even any plausible pretence, for the\r\nassertion, that Congress in 1815 decided against the bank. That very\r\nCongress passed a bill to create a bank, and its decision, therefore, is\r\nprecisely the other way, and is a direct practical precedent in favor of\r\nthe constitutional power. What are we to think of a constitutional\r\nargument which deals in this way with historical facts? When the message\r\ndeclares, as it does declare, that there is nothing in precedent which\r\nought to weigh in favor of the power, it sets at naught repeated acts of\r\nCongress affirming the power, and it also states other acts, which were\r\nin fact, and which are well known to have been, directly the reverse of\r\nwhat the message represents them. There is not, Sir, the slightest\r\nreason to think that any Senate or any House of Representatives, ever\r\nassembled under the Constitution, contained a majority that doubted the\r\nconstitutional existence of the power of Congress to establish a bank.\r\nWhenever the question has arisen, and has been decided, it has always\r\nbeen decided one way. The legislative precedents all assert and maintain\r\nthe power; and these legislative precedents have been the law of the\r\nland for almost forty years. They settle the construction of the\r\nConstitution, and sanction the exercise of the power in question, so far\r\nas these effects can ever be produced by any legislative precedents\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nBut the President does not admit the authority of precedent. Sir, I have\r\nalways found, that those who habitually deny most vehemently the general\r\nforce of precedent, and assert most strongly the supremacy of private\r\nopinion, are yet, of all men, most tenacious of that very authority of\r\nprecedent, whenever it happens to be in their favor. I beg leave to ask,\r\nSir, upon what ground, except that of precedent, and precedent alone,\r\nthe President's friends have placed his power of removal from office. No\r\nsuch power is given by the Constitution, in terms, nor anywhere\r\nintimated, throughout the whole of it; no paragraph or clause of that\r\ninstrument recognizes such a power. To say the least, it is as\r\nquestionable, and has been as often questioned, as the power of Congress\r\nto create a bank; and, enlightened by what has passed under our own\r\nobservation, we now see that it is of all powers the most capable of\r\nflagrant abuse. Now, Sir, I ask again, What becomes of this power, if\r\nthe authority of precedent be taken away? It has all along been denied\r\nto exist; it is nowhere found in the Constitution; and its recent\r\nexercise, or, to call things by their right names, its recent abuse,\r\nhas, more than any other single cause, rendered good men either cool in\r\ntheir affections toward the government of their country, or doubtful of\r\nits long continuance. Yet there is _precedent_ in favor of this power,\r\nand the President exercises it. We know, Sir, that, without the aid of\r\nthat _precedent_, his acts could never have received the sanction of\r\nthis body, even at a time when his voice was somewhat more potential\r\nhere than it now is, or, as I trust, ever again will be. Does the\r\nPresident, then, reject the authority of all precedent except what it is\r\nsuitable to his own purpose to use? And does he use, without stint or\r\nmeasure, all precedents which may augment his own power, or gratify his\r\nown wishes?\r\n\r\nBut if the President thinks lightly of the authority of Congress in\r\nconstruing the Constitution, he thinks still more lightly of the\r\nauthority of the Supreme Court. He asserts a right of individual\r\njudgment on constitutional questions, which is totally inconsistent with\r\nany proper administration of the government, or any regular execution of\r\nthe laws. Social disorder, entire uncertainty in regard to individual\r\nrights and individual duties, the cessation of legal anthority,\r\nconfusion, the dissolution of free government,--all these are the\r\ninevitable consequences of the principles adopted by the message,\r\nwhenever they shall be carried to their full extent. Hitherto it has\r\nbeen thought that the final decision of constitutional questions\r\nbelonged to the supreme judicial tribunal. The very nature of free\r\ngovernment, it has been supposed, enjoins this; and our Constitution,\r\nmoreover, has been understood so to provide, clearly and expressly. It\r\nis true, that each branch of the legislature has an undoubted right, in\r\nthe exercise of its functions, to consider the constitutionality of a\r\nlaw proposed to be passed. This is naturally a part of its duty; and\r\nneither branch can be compelled to pass any law, or do any other act,\r\nwhich it deems to be beyond the reach of its constitutional power. The\r\nPresident has the same right, when a bill is presented for his approval;\r\nfor he is, doubtless, bound to consider, in all cases, whether such bill\r\nbe compatible with the Constitution, and whether he can approve it\r\nconsistently with his oath of office. But when a law has been passed by\r\nCongress, and approved by the President, it is now no longer in the\r\npower, either of the same President, or his successors, to say whether\r\nthe law is constitutional or not. He is not at liberty to disregard it;\r\nhe is not at liberty to feel or to affect \"constitutional scruples,\" and\r\nto sit in judgment himself on the validity of a statute of the\r\ngovernment, and to nullify it, if he so chooses. After a law has passed\r\nthrough all the requisite forms; after it has received the requisite\r\nlegislative sanction and the executive approval, the question of its\r\nconstitutionality then becomes a judicial question, and a judicial\r\nquestion alone. In the courts that question may be raised, argued, and\r\nadjudged; it can be adjudged nowhere else.\r\n\r\nThe President is as much bound by the law as any private citizen, and\r\ncan no more contest its validity than any private citizen. He may refuse\r\nto obey the law, and so may a private citizen; but both do it at their\r\nown peril, and neither of them can settle the question of its validity.\r\nThe President may _say_ a law is unconstitutional, but he is not the\r\njudge. Who is to decide that question? The judiciary alone possesses\r\nthis unquestionable and hitherto unquestioned right. The judiciary is\r\nthe constitutional tribunal of appeal for the citizens, against both\r\nCongress and the executive, in regard to the constitutionality of laws.\r\nIt has this jurisdiction expressly conferred upon it, and when it has\r\ndecided the question, its judgment must, from the very nature of all\r\njudgments that are final, and from which there is no appeal, be\r\nconclusive. Hitherto, this opinion, and a correspondent practice, have\r\nprevailed, in America, with all wise and considerate men. If it were\r\notherwise, there would be no government of laws; but we should all live\r\nunder the government, the rule, the caprices, of individuals. If we\r\ndepart from the observance of these salutary principles, the executive\r\npower becomes at once purely despotic; for the President, if the\r\nprinciple and the reasoning of the message be sound, may either execute\r\nor not execute the laws of the land, according to his sovereign\r\npleasure. He may refuse to put into execution one law, pronounced valid\r\nby all branches of the government, and yet execute another, which may\r\nhave been by constitutional authority pronounced void.\r\n\r\nOn the argument of the message, the President of the United States\r\nholds, under a new pretence and a new name, a _dispensing power_ over\r\nthe laws as absolute as was claimed by James the Second of England, a\r\nmonth before he was compelled to fly the kingdom. That which is now\r\nclaimed by the President is in truth nothing less, and nothing else,\r\nthan the old dispensing power asserted by the kings of England in the\r\nworst of times; the very climax, indeed, of all the preposterous\r\npretensions of the Tudor and the Stuart races. According to the\r\ndoctrines put forth by the President, although Congress may have passed\r\na law, and although the Supreme Court may have pronounced it\r\nconstitutional, yet it is, nevertheless, no law at all, if he, in his\r\ngood pleasure, sees fit to deny it effect; in other words, to repeal\r\nand annul it. Sir, no President and no public man ever before advanced\r\nsuch doctrines in the face of the nation. There never before was a\r\nmoment in which any President would have been tolerated in asserting\r\nsuch a claim to despotic power. After Congress has passed the law, and\r\nafter the Supreme Court has pronounced its judgment on the very point in\r\ncontroversy, the President has set up his own private judgment against\r\nits constitutional interpretation. It is to be remembered, Sir, that it\r\nis the present law, it is the act of 1816, it is the present charter of\r\nthe bank, which the President pronounces to be unconstitutional. It is\r\nno bank _to be created_, it is no law proposed to be passed, which he\r\ndenounces; it is the _law now existing_, passed by Congress, approved by\r\nPresident Madison, and sanctioned by a solemn judgment of the Supreme\r\nCourt, which he now declares unconstitutional, and which, of course, so\r\nfar as it may depend on him, cannot be executed. If these opinions of\r\nthe President be maintained, there is an end of all law and all judicial\r\nauthority. Statutes are but recommendations, judgments no more than\r\nopinions. Both are equally destitute of binding force. Such a universal\r\npower as is now claimed for him, a power of judging over the laws and\r\nover the decisions of the judiciary, is nothing else but pure despotism.\r\nIf conceded to him, it makes him at once what Louis the Fourteenth\r\nproclaimed himself to be when he said, \"I am the State.\"\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has unanimously declared and adjudged that the\r\nexisting bank _is_ created by a constitutional law of Congress. As has\r\nbeen before observed, this bank, so far as the present question is\r\nconcerned, is like that which was established in 1791 by Washington, and\r\nsanctioned by the great men of that day. In every form, therefore, in\r\nwhich the question can be raised, it has been raised and has been\r\nsettled. Every process and every mode of trial known to the Constitution\r\nand laws have been exhausted, and always and without exception the\r\ndecision has been in favor of the validity of the law. But all this\r\npractice, all this precedent, all this public approbation, all this\r\nsolemn adjudication directly on the point, is to be disregarded and\r\nrejected, and the constitutional power flatly denied. And, Sir, if we\r\nare startled at this conclusion, our surprise will not be lessened when\r\nwe examine the argument by which it is maintained.\r\n\r\nBy the Constitution, Congress is authorized to pass all laws \"necessary\r\nand proper\" for carrying its own legislative powers into effect.\r\nCongress has deemed a bank to be \"necessary and proper\" for these\r\npurposes, and it has therefore established a bank. But although the law\r\nhas been passed, and the bank established, and the constitutional\r\nvalidity of its charter solemnly adjudged, yet the President pronounces\r\nit unconstitutional, because some of the powers bestowed on the bank\r\nare, in his opinion, not necessary or proper. It would appear that\r\npowers which in 1791 and in 1816, in the time of Washington and in the\r\ntime of Madison, were deemed \"necessary and proper,\" are no longer to be\r\nso regarded, and therefore the bank is unconstitutional. It has really\r\ncome to this, that the constitutionality of a bank is to depend upon the\r\nopinion which one particular man may form of the utility or necessity of\r\nsome of the clauses in its charter! If that individual chooses to think\r\nthat a particular power contained in the charter is not necessary to the\r\nproper constitution of the bank, then the act is unconstitutional!\r\n\r\nHitherto it has always been supposed that the question was of a very\r\ndifferent nature. It has been thought that the policy of granting a\r\nparticular charter may be materially dependent on the structure and\r\norganization and powers of the proposed institution. But its general\r\nconstitutionality has never before been understood to turn on such\r\npoints. This would be making its constitutionality depend on subordinate\r\nquestions; on questions of expediency and questions of detail; upon that\r\nwhich one man may think necessary, and another may not. If the\r\nconstitutional question were made to hinge on matters of this kind, how\r\ncould it ever be decided? All would depend on conjecture; on the\r\ncomplexional feeling, on the prejudices, on the passions, of\r\nindividuals; on more or less practical skill or correct judgment in\r\nregard to banking operations among those who should be the judges; on\r\nthe impulse of momentary interests, party objects, or personal purposes.\r\nPut the question in this manner to a court of seven judges, to decide\r\nwhether a particular bank was constitutional, and it might be doubtful\r\nwhether they could come to any result, as they might well hold very\r\nvarious opinions on the practical utility of many clauses of the\r\ncharter.\r\n\r\nThe question in that case would be, not whether the bank, in its general\r\nframe, character, and objects, was a proper instrument to carry into\r\neffect the powers of the government, but whether the particular powers,\r\ndirect or incidental, conferred on a particular bank, were better\r\ncalculated than all others to give success to its operations. For if\r\nnot, then the charter, according to this sort of reasoning, would be\r\nunwarranted by the Constitution. This mode of construing the\r\nConstitution is certainly a novel discovery. Its merits belong entirely\r\nto the President and his advisers. According to this rule of\r\ninterpretation, if the President should be of opinion, that the capital\r\nof the bank was larger, by a thousand dollars, than it ought to be; or\r\nthat the time for the continuance of the charter was a year too long; or\r\nthat it was unnecessary to require it, under penalty, to pay specie; or\r\nneedless to provide for punishing, as forgery, the counterfeiting of its\r\nbills,--either of these reasons would be sufficient to render the\r\ncharter, in his opinion, unconstitutional, invalid, and nugatory. This\r\nis a legitimate conclusion from the argument. Such a view of the subject\r\nhas certainly never before been taken. This train of reasoning has\r\nhitherto not been heard within the halls of Congress, nor has any one\r\nventured upon it before the tribunals of justice. The first exhibition,\r\nits first appearance, as an argument, is in a message of the President\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nAccording to that mode of construing the Constitution which was adopted\r\nby Congress in 1791, and approved by Washington, and which has been\r\nsanctioned by the judgment of the Supreme Court, and affirmed by the\r\npractice of nearly forty years, the question upon the constitutionality\r\nof the bank involves two inquiries. First, whether a bank, in its\r\ngeneral character, and with regard to the general objects with which\r\nbanks are usually connected, be, in itself, a fit means, a suitable\r\ninstrument, to carry into effect the powers granted to the government.\r\nIf it be so, then the second, and the only other question is, whether\r\nthe powers given in a particular charter are appropriate for a bank. If\r\nthey are powers which are appropriate for a bank, powers which Congress\r\nmay fairly consider to be useful to the bank or the country, then\r\nCongress may confer these powers; because the discretion to be exercised\r\nin framing the constitution of the bank belongs to Congress. One man may\r\nthink the granted powers not indispensable to the particular bank;\r\nanother may suppose them injudicious, or injurious; a third may imagine\r\nthat other powers, if granted in their stead, would be more beneficial;\r\nbut all these are matters of expediency, about which men may differ; and\r\nthe power of deciding upon them belongs to Congress.\r\n\r\nI again repeat, Sir, that if, for reasons of this kind, the President\r\nsees fit to negative a bill, on the ground of its being inexpedient or\r\nimpolitic, he has a right to do so. But remember, Sir, that we are now\r\non the constitutional question; remember that the argument of the\r\nPresident is, that, because powers were given to the bank by the charter\r\nof 1816 which he thinks unnecessary, that charter is unconstitutional.\r\nNow, Sir, it will hardly be denied, or rather it was not denied or\r\ndoubted before this message came to us, that, if there was to be a bank,\r\nthe powers and duties of that bank must be prescribed in the law\r\ncreating it. Nobody but Congress, it has been thought, could grant\r\nthese powers and privileges, or prescribe their limitations. It is true,\r\nindeed, that the message pretty plainly intimates, that the President\r\nshould have been _first_ consulted, and that he should have had the\r\nframing of the bill; but we are not yet accustomed to that order of\r\nthings in enacting laws, nor do I know a parallel to this claim, thus\r\nnow brought forward, except that, in some peculiar cases in England,\r\nhighly affecting the royal prerogative, the assent of the monarch is\r\nnecessary before either the House of Peers, or his Majesty's faithful\r\nCommons, are permitted to act upon the subject, or to entertain its\r\nconsideration. But supposing, Sir, that our accustomed forms and our\r\nrepublican principles are still to be followed, and that a law creating\r\na bank is, like all other laws, to originate with Congress, and that the\r\nPresident has nothing to do with it till it is presented for his\r\napproval, then it is clear that the powers and duties of a proposed\r\nbank, and all the terms and conditions annexed to it, must, in the first\r\nplace, be settled by Congress.\r\n\r\nThis power, if constitutional at all, is only constitutional in the\r\nhands of Congress. Anywhere else, its exercise would be plain\r\nusurpation. If, then, the authority to decide what powers ought to be\r\ngranted to a bank belong to Congress, and Congress shall have exercised\r\nthat power, it would seem little better than absurd to say, that its\r\nact, nevertheless would be unconstitutional and invalid, if, in the\r\nopinion of a third party, it had misjudged, on a question of expediency,\r\nin the arrangement of details. According to such a mode of reasoning, a\r\nmistake in the exercise of jurisdiction takes away the jurisdiction. If\r\nCongress decide right, its decision may stand; if it decide wrong, its\r\ndecision is nugatory; and whether its decision be right or wrong,\r\nanother is to judge, although the original power of making the decision\r\nmust be allowed to be exclusively in Congress. This is the end to which\r\nthe argument of the message will conduct its followers.\r\n\r\nSir, in considering the authority of Congress to invest the bank with\r\nthe particular powers granted to it, the inquiry is not, and cannot be,\r\nhow appropriate these powers are, but whether they be at all\r\nappropriate; whether they come within the range of a just and honest\r\ndiscretion; whether Congress may fairly esteem them to be necessary. The\r\nquestion is not, Are they the fittest means, the best means? or whether\r\nthe bank might not be established without them; but the question is, Are\r\nthey such as Congress, _bona fide_, may have regarded as appropriate to\r\nthe end? If any other rule were to be adopted, nothing could ever be\r\nsettled. A law would be constitutional to-day and unconstitutional\r\nto-morrow. Its constitutionality would altogether depend upon individual\r\nopinion on a matter of mere expediency. Indeed, such a case as that is\r\nnow actually before us. Mr. Madison deemed the powers given to the bank,\r\nin its present charter, proper and necessary. He held the bank,\r\ntherefore, to be constitutional. But the present President, not\r\nacknowledging that the power of deciding on these points rests with\r\nCongress, nor with Congress and the then President, but setting up his\r\nown opinion as the standard, declares the law now in being\r\nunconstitutional, because the powers granted by it are, in his\r\nestimation, not necessary and proper. I pray to be informed, Sir,\r\nwhether, upon similar grounds of reasoning, the President's own scheme\r\nfor a bank, if Congress should do so unlikely a thing as to adopt it,\r\nwould not become unconstitutional also, if it should so happen that his\r\nsuccessor should hold his bank in as light esteem as he holds those\r\nestablished under the auspices of Washington and Madison?\r\n\r\nIf the reasoning of the message be well founded, it is clear that the\r\ncharter of the existing bank is not a law. The bank has no legal\r\nexistence; it is not responsible to government; it has no authority to\r\nact; it is incapable of being an agent; the President may treat it as a\r\nnullity to-morrow, withdraw from it all the public deposits, and set\r\nafloat all the existing national arrangements of revenue and finance.\r\nIt is enough to state these monstrous consequences, to show that the\r\ndoctrine, principles, and pretensions of the message are entirely\r\ninconsistent with a government of laws. If that which Congress has\r\nenacted, and the Supreme Court has sanctioned, be not the law of the\r\nland, then the reign of law has ceased, and the reign of individual\r\nopinion has already begun.\r\n\r\nThe President, in his commentary on the details of the existing bank\r\ncharter, undertakes to prove that one provision, and another provision,\r\nis not necessary and proper; because, as he thinks, the same objects\r\nproposed to be accomplished by them might have been better attained in\r\nanother mode; and therefore such provisions are not necessary, and so\r\nnot warranted by the Constitution. Does not this show, that, according\r\nto his own mode of reasoning, his _own_ scheme would not be\r\nconstitutional, since another scheme, which probably most people would\r\nthink a better one, might be substituted for it? Perhaps, in any bank\r\ncharter, there may be no provisions which may be justly regarded as\r\nabsolutely indispensable; since it is probable that for any of them some\r\nothers might be substituted. No bank, therefore, ever could be\r\nestablished; because there never has been, and never could be, any\r\ncharter, of which every provision should appear to be indispensable, or\r\nnecessary and proper, in the judgment of every individual. To admit,\r\ntherefore, that there may be a constitutional bank, and yet to contend\r\nfor such a mode of judging of its provisions and details as the message\r\nadopts, involves an absurdity. Any charter which may be framed may be\r\ntaken up, and each power conferred by it successively denied, on the\r\nground, that, in regard to each, either no such power is \"necessary or\r\nproper\" in a bank, or, which is the same thing in effect, some other\r\npower might be substituted for it, and supply its place. That can never\r\nbe necessary, in the sense in which the message understands that term,\r\nwhich may be dispensed with; and it cannot be said that any power may\r\nnot be dispensed with, if there be some other which might be substituted\r\nfor it, and which would accomplish the same end. Therefore, no bank\r\ncould ever be constitutional, because none could be established which\r\nshould not contain some provisions which might have been omitted, and\r\ntheir place supplied by others.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have understood the true and well-established doctrine\r\nto be, that, after it has been decided that it is competent for Congress\r\nto establish a bank, then it follows that it may create such a bank as\r\nit judges, in its discretion, to be best, and invest it with all such\r\npower as it may deem fit and suitable; with this limitation, always,\r\nthat all is to be done in the _bona fide_ execution of the power to\r\ncreate a bank. If the granted powers are appropriate to the professed\r\nend, so that the granting of them cannot be regarded as usurpation of\r\nauthority by Congress, or an evasion of constitutional restrictions,\r\nunder color of establishing a bank, then the charter is constitutional,\r\nwhether these powers be thought indispensable by others or not, or\r\nwhether even Congress itself deemed them absolutely indispensable, or\r\nonly thought them fit and suitable, or whether they are more or less\r\nappropriate to their end. It is enough that they are appropriate; it is\r\nenough that they are suited to produce the effects designed; and no\r\ncomparison is to be instituted, in order to try their constitutionality,\r\nbetween them and others which may be suggested. A case analogous to the\r\npresent is found in the constitutional power of Congress over the mail.\r\nThe Constitution says no more than that \"Congress shall have power to\r\nestablish post-offices and post-roads\"; and, in the general clause, \"all\r\npowers necessary and proper\" to give effect to this. In the execution of\r\nthis power, Congress has protected the mail, by providing that robbery\r\nof it shall be punished with death. Is this infliction of capital\r\npunishment constitutional? Certainly it is not, unless it be both\r\n\"proper and necessary.\" The President may not think it necessary or\r\nproper; the law, then, according to the system of reasoning enforced by\r\nthe message, is of no binding force, and the President may disobey it,\r\nand refuse to see it executed.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, Mr. President, that if the general object, the\r\nsubject-matter, properly belong to Congress, all its incidents belong to\r\nCongress also. If Congress is to establish post-offices and post-roads,\r\nit may, for that end, adopt one set of regulations or another; and\r\neither would be constitutional. So the details of one bank are as\r\nconstitutional as those of another, if they are confined fairly and\r\nhonestly to the purpose of organizing the institution, and rendering it\r\nuseful. One _bank_ is as constitutional as another _bank_. If Congress\r\npossesses the power to make a bank, it possesses the power to make it\r\nefficient, and competent to produce the good expected from it. It may\r\nclothe it with all such power and privileges, not otherwise inconsistent\r\nwith the Constitution, as may be necessary, in its own judgment, to make\r\nit what government deems it should be. It may confer on it such\r\nimmunities as may induce individuals to become stockholders, and to\r\nfurnish the capital; and since the extent of these immunities and\r\nprivileges is matter of discretion, and matter of opinion, Congress only\r\ncan decide it, because Congress alone can frame or grant the charter. A\r\ncharter, thus granted to individuals, becomes a contract with them, upon\r\ntheir compliance with its terms. The bank becomes an agent, bound to\r\nperform certain duties, and entitled to certain stipulated rights and\r\nprivileges, in compensation for the proper discharge of these duties;\r\nand all these stipulations, so long as they are appropriate to the\r\nobject professed, and not repugnant to any other constitutional\r\ninjunction, are entirely within the competency of Congress. And yet,\r\nSir, the message of the President toils through all the commonplace\r\ntopics of monopoly, the right of taxation, the suffering of the poor,\r\nand the arrogance of the rich, with as much painful effort, as if one,\r\nor another, or all of them, had something to do with the constitutional\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nWhat is called the \"monopoly\" is made the subject of repeated rehearsal,\r\nin terms of special complaint. By this \"monopoly,\" I suppose, is\r\nunderstood the restriction contained in the charter, that Congress shall\r\nnot, during the twenty years, create another bank. Now, Sir, let me ask,\r\nWho would think of creating a bank, inviting stockholders into it, with\r\nlarge investments, imposing upon it heavy duties, as connected with the\r\ngovernment, receiving some millions of dollars as a _bonus_ or premium,\r\nand yet retaining the power of granting, the next day, another charter,\r\nwhich would destroy the whole value of the first? If this be an\r\nunconstitutional restraint on Congress, the Constitution must be\r\nstrangely at variance with the dictates both of good sense and sound\r\nmorals. Did not the first Bank of the United States contain a similar\r\nrestriction? And have not the States granted bank charters with a\r\ncondition, that, if the charter should be accepted, they would not grant\r\nothers? States have certainly done so; and, in some instances, where no\r\n_bonus_ or premium was paid at all; but from the mere desire to give\r\neffect to the charter, by inducing individuals to accept it and organize\r\nthe institution. The President declares that this restriction is not\r\nnecessary to the efficiency of the bank; but that is the very thing\r\nwhich Congress and his predecessor in office were called on to decide,\r\nand which they did decide, when the one passed and the other approved\r\nthe act. And he has now no more authority to pronounce his judgment on\r\nthat act than any other individual in society. It is not his province to\r\ndecide on the constitutionality of statutes which Congress has passed,\r\nand his predecessors approved.\r\n\r\nThere is another sentiment in this part of the message, which we should\r\nhardly have expected to find in a paper which is supposed, whoever may\r\nhave drawn it up, to have passed under the review of professional\r\ncharacters. The message declares, that this limitation to create no\r\nother bank is unconstitutional, because, although Congress may use the\r\ndiscretion vested in them, \"they may not limit the discretion of their\r\nsuccessors.\" This reason is almost too superficial to require an answer.\r\nEvery one at all accustomed to the consideration of such subjects knows\r\nthat every Congress can bind its successors to the same extent that it\r\ncan bind itself. The power of Congress is always the same; the authority\r\nof law always the same. It is true, we speak of the Twentieth Congress\r\nand the Twenty-first Congress, but this is only to denote the period of\r\ntime, or to mark the successive organizations of the House of\r\nRepresentatives under the successive periodical election of its members.\r\nAs a politic body, as the legislative power of the government, Congress\r\nis always continuous, always identical. A particular Congress, as we\r\nspeak of it, for instance, the present Congress, can no farther restrain\r\nitself from doing what it may choose to do at the next session, than it\r\ncan restrain any succeeding Congress from doing what it may choose. Any\r\nCongress may repeal the act or law of its predecessor, if in its nature\r\nit be repealable, just as it may repeal its own act; and if a law or an\r\nact be irrepealable in its nature, it can no more be repealed by a\r\nsubsequent Congress than by that which passed it. All this is familiar\r\nto everybody. And Congress, like every other legislature, often passes\r\nacts which, being in the nature of grants or contracts, are irrepealable\r\never afterwards. The message, in a strain of argument which it is\r\ndifficult to treat with ordinary respect, declares that this restriction\r\non the power of Congress, as to the establishment of other banks, is a\r\npalpable attempt to amend the Constitution by an act of legislation. The\r\nreason on which this observation purports to be founded is, that\r\nCongress, by the Constitution, is to have exclusive legislation over the\r\nDistrict of Columbia; and when the bank charter declares that Congress\r\nwill create no new bank within the District, it annuls this power of\r\nexclusive legislation! I must say, that this reasoning hardly rises high\r\nenough to entitle it to a passing notice. It would be doing it too much\r\ncredit to call it plausible. No one needs to be informed that exclusive\r\npower of legislation is not unlimited power of legislation; and if it\r\nwere, how can that legislative power be unlimited that cannot restrain\r\nitself, that cannot bind itself by contract? Whether as a government or\r\nas an individual, that being is fettered and restrained which is not\r\ncapable of binding itself by ordinary obligation. Every legislature\r\nbinds itself, whenever it makes a grant, enters into a contract, bestows\r\nan office, or does any other act or thing which is in its nature\r\nirrepealable. And this, instead of detracting from its legislative\r\npower, is one of the modes of exercising that power. The legislative\r\npower of Congress over the District of Columbia would not be full and\r\ncomplete, if it might not make just such a stipulation as the bank\r\ncharter contains.\r\n\r\nAs to the taxing power of the States, about which the message says so\r\nmuch, the proper answer to all it says is, that the States possess no\r\npower to tax any instrument of the government of the United States. It\r\nwas no part of their power before the Constitution, and they derive no\r\nsuch power from any of its provisions. It is nowhere given to them.\r\nCould a State tax the _coin_ of the United States at the mint? Could a\r\nState lay a stamp tax on the process of the courts of the United States,\r\nand on custom-house papers? Could it tax the transportation of the mail,\r\nor the ships of war, or the ordnance, or the muniments of war, of the\r\nUnited States? The reason that these cannot be taxed by a State is, that\r\nthey are means and instruments of the government of the United States.\r\nThe establishment of a bank exempt from State taxation takes away no\r\nexisting right in a State. It leaves it all it ever possessed. But the\r\ncomplaint is, that the bank charter does not _confer_ the power of\r\ntaxation. This, certainly, though not a new, (for the same argument was\r\nurged here,) appears to me to be a strange, mode of asserting and\r\nmaintaining State rights. The power of taxation is a sovereign power;\r\nand the President and those who think with him are of opinion, in a\r\ngiven case, that this sovereign power should be conferred on the States\r\nby an act of Congress. There is, if I mistake not, Sir, as little\r\ncompliment to State sovereignty in this idea, as there is of sound\r\nconstitutional doctrine. Sovereign rights held under the grant of an act\r\nof Congress present a proposition quite new in constitutional law.\r\n\r\nThe President himself even admits that an instrument of the government\r\nof the United States ought not, as such, to be taxed by the States; yet\r\nhe contends for such a power of taxing property connected with this\r\ninstrument, and essential to its very being, as places its whole\r\nexistence in the pleasure of the States. It is not enough that the\r\nStates may tax all the property of all their own citizens, wherever\r\ninvested or however employed. The complaint is, that the power of State\r\ntaxation does not reach so far as to take cognizance over persons out of\r\nthe State, and to tax them for a franchise lawfully exercised under the\r\nauthority of the United States. Sir, when did the power of the States,\r\nor indeed of any government, go to such an extent as that? Clearly\r\nnever. The taxing power of all communities is necessarily and justly\r\nlimited to the property of its own citizens, and to the property of\r\nothers, having a distinct local existence as property, within its\r\njurisdiction; it does not extend to rights and franchises, rightly\r\nexercised, under the authority of other governments, nor to persons\r\nbeyond its jurisdiction. As the Constitution has left the taxing power\r\nof the States, so the bank charter leaves it. Congress has not\r\nundertaken either to take away, or to confer, a taxing power; nor to\r\nenlarge, or to restrain it; if it were to do either, I hardly know which\r\nof the two would be the least excusable.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to repeat, Mr. President, that what I have now been\r\nconsidering are the President's objections, not to the policy or\r\nexpediency, but to the constitutionality, of the bank; and not to the\r\nconstitutionality of any new or proposed bank, but of the bank as it now\r\nis, and as it has long existed. If the President had declined to approve\r\nthis bill because he thought the original charter unwisely granted, and\r\nthe bank, in point of policy and expediency, objectionable or\r\nmischievous, and in that view only had suggested the reasons now urged\r\nby him, his argument, however inconclusive, would have been\r\nintelligible, and not, in its whole frame and scope, inconsistent with\r\nall well-established first principles. His rejection of the bill, in\r\nthat case, would have been, no doubt, an extraordinary exercise of\r\npower; but it would have been, nevertheless, the exercise of a power\r\nbelonging to his office, and trusted by the Constitution to his\r\ndiscretion. But when he puts forth an array of arguments such as the\r\nmessage employs, not against the expediency of the bank, but against its\r\nconstitutional existence, he confounds all distinctions, mixes questions\r\nof policy and questions of right together, and turns all constitutional\r\nrestraints into mere matters of opinion. As far as its power extends,\r\neither in its direct effects or as a precedent, the message not only\r\nunsettles every thing which has been settled under the Constitution, but\r\nwould show, also, that the Constitution itself is utterly incapable of\r\nany fixed construction or definite interpretation, and that there is no\r\npossibility of establishing, by its authority, any practical limitations\r\non the powers of the respective branches of the government.\r\n\r\nWhen the message denies, as it does, the authority of the Supreme Court\r\nto decide on constitutional questions, it effects, so far as the opinion\r\nof the President and his authority can effect it, a complete change in\r\nour government. It does two things: first, it converts constitutional\r\nlimitations of power into mere matters of opinion, and then it strikes\r\nthe judicial department, as an efficient department, out of our system.\r\nBut the message by no means stops even at this point. Having denied to\r\nCongress the authority of judging what powers may be constitutionally\r\nconferred on a bank, and having erected the judgment of the President\r\nhimself into a standard by which to try the constitutional character of\r\nsuch powers, and having denounced the authority of the Supreme Court to\r\ndecide finally on constitutional questions, the message proceeds to\r\nclaim for the President, not the power of approval, but the primary\r\npower, the power of originating laws. The President informs Congress,\r\nthat _he_ would have sent them such a charter, if it had been properly\r\nasked for, as they ought to confer. He very plainly intimates, that, in\r\nhis opinion, the establishment of all laws, of this nature at least,\r\nbelongs to the functions of the executive government; and that Congress\r\nought to have waited for the manifestation of the executive will, before\r\nit presumed to touch the subject. Such, Mr. President, stripped of their\r\ndisguises, are the real pretences set up in behalf of the executive\r\npower in this most extraordinary paper.\r\n\r\nMr. President, we have arrived at a new epoch. We are entering on\r\nexperiments, with the government and the Constitution of the country,\r\nhitherto untried, and of fearful and appalling aspect. This message\r\ncalls us to the contemplation of a future which little resembles the\r\npast. Its principles are at war with all that public opinion has\r\nsustained, and all which the experience of the government has\r\nsanctioned. It denies first principles; it contradicts truths,\r\nheretofore received as indisputable. It denies to the judiciary the\r\ninterpretation of law, and claims to divide with Congress the power of\r\noriginating statutes. It extends the grasp of executive pretension over\r\nevery power of the government. But this is not all. It presents the\r\nchief magistrate of the Union in the attitude of arguing away the powers\r\nof that government over which he has been chosen to preside; and\r\nadopting for this purpose modes of reasoning which, even under the\r\ninfluence of all proper feeling towards high official station, it is\r\ndifficult to regard as respectable. It appeals to every prejudice which\r\nmay betray men into a mistaken view of their own interests, and to every\r\npassion which may lead them to disobey the impulses of their\r\nunderstanding. It urges all the specious topics of State rights and\r\nnational encroachment against that which a great majority of the States\r\nhave affirmed to be rightful, and in which all of them have acquiesced.\r\nIt sows, in an unsparing manner, the seeds of jealousy and ill-will\r\nagainst that government of which its author is the official head. It\r\nraises a cry, that liberty is in danger, at the very moment when it puts\r\nforth claims to powers heretofore unknown and unheard of. It affects\r\nalarm for the public freedom, when nothing endangers that freedom so\r\nmuch as its own unparalleled pretences. This, even, is not all. It\r\nmanifestly seeks to inflame the poor against the rich; it wantonly\r\nattacks whole classes of the people, for the purpose of turning against\r\nthem the prejudices and the resentments of other classes. It is a state\r\npaper which finds no topic too exciting for its use, no passion too\r\ninflammable for its address and its solicitation.\r\n\r\nSuch is this message. It remains now for the people of the United States\r\nto choose between the principles here avowed and their government. These\r\ncannot subsist together. The one or the other must be rejected. If the\r\nsentiments of the message shall receive general approbation, the\r\nConstitution will have perished even earlier than the moment which its\r\nenemies originally allowed for the termination of its existence. It will\r\nnot have survived to its fiftieth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON\r\n\r\nA SPEECH DELIVERED AT A PUBLIC DINNER IN THE CITY OF WASHINGTON ON THE\r\n22D OF FEBRUARY, 1832, THE CENTENNIAL ANNIVERSARY OF WASHINGTON'S\r\nBIRTHDAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[On the 22d of February, 1832, being the centennial birthday of GEORGE\r\nWASHINGTON, a number of gentlemen, members of Congress and others, from\r\ndifferent parts of the Union, united in commemorating the occasion by a\r\npublic dinner in the city of Washington.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the Committee of Arrangements, Mr. Webster, then a\r\nSenator from Massachusetts, occupied the chair. After the cloth was\r\nremoved, he addressed the company in the following manner.]\r\n\r\nI rise, Gentlemen, to propose to you the name of that great man, in\r\ncommemoration of whose birth, and in honor of whose character and\r\nservices, we are here assembled.\r\n\r\nI am sure that I express a sentiment common to every one present, when I\r\nsay that there is something more than ordinarily solemn and affecting in\r\nthis occasion.\r\n\r\nWe are met to testify our regard for him whose name is intimately\r\nblended with whatever belongs most essentially to the prosperity, the\r\nliberty, the free institutions, and the renown of our country. That name\r\nwas of power to rally a nation, in the hour of thick-thronging public\r\ndisasters and calamities; that name shone, amid the storm of war, a\r\nbeacon light, to cheer and guide the country's friends; it flamed, too,\r\nlike a meteor, to repel her foes. That name, in the days of peace, was a\r\nloadstone, attracting to itself a whole people's confidence, a whole\r\npeople's love, and the whole world's respect. That name, descending with\r\nall time, spreading over the whole earth, and uttered in all the\r\nlanguages belonging to the tribes and races of men, will for ever be\r\npronounced with affectionate gratitude by every one in whose breast\r\nthere shall arise an aspiration for human rights and human liberty.\r\n\r\nWe perform this grateful duty, Gentlemen, at the expiration of a hundred\r\nyears from his birth, near the place, so cherished and beloved by him,\r\nwhere his dust now reposes, and in the capital which bears his own\r\nimmortal name.\r\n\r\nAll experience evinces that human sentiments are strongly influenced by\r\nassociations. The recurrence of anniversaries, or of longer periods of\r\ntime, naturally freshens the recollection, and deepens the impression,\r\nof events with which they are historically connected. Renowned places,\r\nalso, have a power to awaken feeling, which all acknowledge. No American\r\ncan pass by the fields of Bunker Hill, Monmouth, and Camden, as if they\r\nwere ordinary spots on the earth's surface. Whoever visits them feels\r\nthe sentiment of love of country kindling anew, as if the spirit that\r\nbelonged to the transactions which have rendered these places\r\ndistinguished still hovered round, with power to move and excite all who\r\nin future time may approach them.\r\n\r\nBut neither of these sources of emotion equals the power with which\r\ngreat moral examples affect the mind. When sublime virtues cease to be\r\nabstractions, when they become embodied in human character, and\r\nexemplified in human conduct, we should be false to our own nature, if\r\nwe did not indulge in the spontaneous effusions of our gratitude and our\r\nadmiration. A true lover of the virtue of patriotism delights to\r\ncontemplate its purest models; and that love of country may be well\r\nsuspected which affects to soar so high into the regions of sentiment as\r\nto be lost and absorbed in the abstract feeling, and becomes too\r\nelevated or too refined to glow with fervor in the commendation or the\r\nlove of individual benefactors. All this is unnatural. It is as if one\r\nshould be so enthusiastic a lover of poetry, as to care nothing for\r\nHomer or Milton; so passionately attached to eloquence as to be\r\nindifferent to Tully and Chatham; or such a devotee to the arts, in such\r\nan ecstasy with the elements of beauty, proportion, and expression, as\r\nto regard the masterpieces of Raphael and Michael Angelo with coldness\r\nor contempt. We may be assured, Gentlemen, that he who really loves the\r\nthing itself, loves its finest exhibitions. A true friend of his country\r\nloves her friends and benefactors, and thinks it no degradation to\r\ncommend and commemorate them. The voluntary outpouring of the public\r\nfeeling, made to-day, from the North to the South, and from the East to\r\nthe West, proves this sentiment to be both just and natural. In the\r\ncities and in the villages, in the public temples and in the family\r\ncircles, among all ages and sexes, gladdened voices to-day bespeak\r\ngrateful hearts and a freshened recollection of the virtues of the\r\nFather of his Country. And it will be so, in all time to come, so long\r\nas public virtue is itself an object of regard. The ingenuous youth of\r\nAmerica will hold up to themselves the bright model of Washington's\r\nexample, and study to be what they behold; they will contemplate his\r\ncharacter till all its virtues spread out and display themselves to\r\ntheir delighted vision; as the earliest astronomers, the shepherds on\r\nthe plains of Babylon, gazed at the stars till they saw them form into\r\nclusters and constellations, overpowering at length the eyes of the\r\nbeholders with the united blaze of a thousand lights.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, we are at a point of a century from the birth of Washington;\r\nand what a century it has been! During its course, the human mind has\r\nseemed to proceed with a sort of geometric velocity, accomplishing for\r\nhuman intelligence and human freedom more than had been done in fives or\r\ntens of centuries preceding. Washington stands at the commencement of a\r\nnew era, as well as at the head of the New World. A century from the\r\nbirth of Washington has changed the world. The country of Washington has\r\nbeen the theatre on which a great part of that change has been wrought,\r\nand Washington himself a principal agent by which it has been\r\naccomplished. His age and his country are equally full of wonders; and\r\nof both he is the chief.\r\n\r\nIf the poetical prediction, uttered a few years before his birth, be\r\ntrue; if indeed it be designed by Providence that the grandest\r\nexhibition of human character and human affairs shall be made on this\r\ntheatre of the Western world; if it be true that,\r\n\r\n    \"The four first acts already past,\r\n    A fifth shall close the drama with the day,\r\n    Time's noblest offspring is the last\";--\r\n\r\nhow could this imposing, swelling, final scene be appropriately opened,\r\nhow could its intense interest be adequately sustained, but by the\r\nintroduction of just such a character as our Washington?\r\n\r\nWashington had attained his manhood when that spark of liberty was\r\nstruck out in his own country, which has since kindled into a flame, and\r\nshot its beams over the earth. In the flow of a century from his birth,\r\nthe world has changed in science, in arts, in the extent of commerce, in\r\nthe improvement of navigation, and in all that relates to the\r\ncivilization of man. But it is the spirit of human freedom, the new\r\nelevation of individual man, in his moral, social, and political\r\ncharacter, leading the whole long train of other improvements, which has\r\nmost remarkably distinguished the era. Society, in this century, has\r\nnot made its progress, like Chinese skill, by a greater acuteness of\r\ningenuity in trifles; it has not merely lashed itself to an increased\r\nspeed round the old circles of thought and action; but it has assumed a\r\nnew character; it has raised itself from _beneath_ governments to a\r\nparticipation _in_ governments; it has mixed moral and political objects\r\nwith the daily pursuits of individual men; and, with a freedom and\r\nstrength before altogether unknown, it has applied to these objects the\r\nwhole power of the human understanding. It has been the era, in short,\r\nwhen the social principle has triumphed over the feudal principle; when\r\nsociety has maintained its rights against military power, and\r\nestablished, on foundations never hereafter to be shaken, its competency\r\nto govern itself.\r\n\r\nIt was the extraordinary fortune of Washington, that, having been\r\nintrusted, in revolutionary times, with the supreme military command,\r\nand having fulfilled that trust with equal renown for wisdom and for\r\nvalor, he should be placed at the head of the first government in which\r\nan attempt was to be made on a large scale to rear the fabric of social\r\norder on the basis of a written constitution and of a pure\r\nrepresentative principle. A government was to be established, without a\r\nthrone, without an aristocracy, without castes, orders, or privileges;\r\nand this government, instead of being a democracy, existing and acting\r\nwithin the walls of a single city, was to be extended over a vast\r\ncountry, of different climates, interests, and habits, and of various\r\ncommunions of our common Christian faith. The experiment certainly was\r\nentirely new. A popular government of this extent, it was evident, could\r\nbe framed only by carrying into full effect the principle of\r\nrepresentation or of delegated power; and the world was to see whether\r\nsociety could, by the strength of this principle, maintain its own peace\r\nand good government, carry forward its own great interests, and conduct\r\nitself to political renown and glory.\r\n\r\nBy the benignity of Providence, this experiment, so full of interest to\r\nus and to our posterity for ever, so full of interest, indeed, to the\r\nworld in its present generation and in all its generations to come, was\r\nsuffered to commence under the guidance of Washington. Destined for this\r\nhigh career, he was fitted for it by wisdom, by virtue, by patriotism,\r\nby discretion, by whatever can inspire confidence in man toward man. In\r\nentering on the untried scenes, early disappointment and the premature\r\nextinction of all hope of success would have been certain, had it not\r\nbeen that there did exist throughout the country, in a most\r\nextraordinary degree, an unwavering trust in him who stood at the helm.\r\n\r\nI remarked, Gentlemen, that the whole world was and is interested in the\r\nresult of this experiment. And is it not so? Do we deceive ourselves, or\r\nis it true that at this moment the career which this government is\r\nrunning is among the most attractive objects to the civilized world? Do\r\nwe deceive ourselves, or is it true that at this moment that love of\r\nliberty and that understanding of its true principles which are flying\r\nover the whole earth, as on the wings of all the winds, are really and\r\ntruly of American origin?\r\n\r\nAt the period of the birth of Washington, there existed in Europe no\r\npolitical liberty in large communities, except in the provinces of\r\nHolland, and except that England herself had set a great example, so far\r\nas it went, by her glorious Revolution of 1688. Everywhere else,\r\ndespotic power was predominant, and the feudal or military principle\r\nheld the mass of mankind in hopeless bondage. One half of Europe was\r\ncrushed beneath the Bourbon sceptre, and no conception of political\r\nliberty, no hope even of religious toleration, existed among that nation\r\nwhich was America's first ally. The king was the state, the king was the\r\ncountry, the king was all. There was one king, with power not derived\r\nfrom his people, and too high to be questioned; and the rest were all\r\nsubjects, with no political right but obedience. All above was\r\nintangible power, all below quiet subjection. A recent occurrence in the\r\nFrench Chambers shows us how public opinion on these subjects is\r\nchanged. A minister had spoken of the \"king's subjects.\" \"There are no\r\nsubjects,\" exclaimed hundreds of voices at once, \"in a country where the\r\npeople make the king!\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the spirit of human liberty and of free government, nurtured\r\nand grown into strength and beauty in America, has stretched its course\r\ninto the midst of the nations. Like an emanation from Heaven, it has\r\ngone forth, and it will not return void. It must change, it is fast\r\nchanging, the face of the earth. Our great, our high duty is to show, in\r\nour own example, that this spirit is a spirit of health as well as a\r\nspirit of power; that its benignity is as great as its strength; that\r\nits efficiency to secure individual rights, social relations, and moral\r\norder, is equal to the irresistible force with which it prostrates\r\nprincipalities and powers. The world, at this moment, is regarding us\r\nwith a willing, but something of a fearful admiration. Its deep and\r\nawful anxiety is to learn whether free states may be stable, as well as\r\nfree; whether popular power may be trusted, as well as feared; in short,\r\nwhether wise, regular, and virtuous self-government is a vision for the\r\ncontemplation of theorists, or a truth established, illustrated, and\r\nbrought into practice in the country of Washington.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, for the earth which we inhabit, and the whole circle of the\r\nsun, for all the unborn races of mankind, we seem to hold in our hands,\r\nfor their weal or woe, the fate of this experiment. If we fail, who\r\nshall venture the repetition? If our example shall prove to be one, not\r\nof encouragement, but of terror, not fit to be imitated, but fit only to\r\nbe shunned, where else shall the world look for free models? If this\r\ngreat _Western Sun_ be struck out of the firmament, at what other\r\nfountain shall the lamp of liberty hereafter be lighted? What other orb\r\nshall emit a ray to glimmer, even, on the darkness of the world?\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of our overrating or overstating the important part\r\nwhich we are now acting in human affairs. It should not flatter our\r\npersonal self-respect, but it should reanimate our patriotic virtues,\r\nand inspire us with a deeper and more solemn sense, both of our\r\nprivileges and of our duties. We cannot wish better for our country, nor\r\nfor the world, than that the same spirit which influenced Washington may\r\ninfluence all who succeed him; and that the same blessing from above,\r\nwhich attended his efforts, may also attend theirs.\r\n\r\nThe principles of Washington's administration are not left doubtful.\r\nThey are to be found in the Constitution itself, in the great measures\r\nrecommended and approved by him, in his speeches to Congress, and in\r\nthat most interesting paper, his Farewell Address to the People of the\r\nUnited States. The success of the government under his administration is\r\nthe highest proof of the soundness of these principles. And, after an\r\nexperience of thirty-five years, what is there which an enemy could\r\ncondemn? What is there which either his friends, or the friends of the\r\ncountry, could wish to have been otherwise? I speak, of course, of great\r\nmeasures and leading principles.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, all his measures were right in their intent. He\r\nstated the whole basis of his own great character, when he told the\r\ncountry, in the homely phrase of the proverb, that honesty is the best\r\npolicy. One of the most striking things ever said of him is, that \"_he\r\nchanged mankind's ideas of political greatness_.\"[1] To commanding\r\ntalents, and to success, the common elements of such greatness, he added\r\na disregard of self, a spotlessness of motive, a steady submission to\r\nevery public and private duty, which threw far into the shade the whole\r\ncrowd of vulgar great. The object of his regard was the whole country.\r\nNo part of it was enough to fill his enlarged patriotism. His love of\r\nglory, so far as that may be supposed to have influenced him at all,\r\nspurned every thing short of general approbation. It would have been\r\nnothing to him, that his partisans or his favorites outnumbered, or\r\noutvoted, or outmanaged, or outclamored, those of other leaders. He had\r\nno favorites; he rejected all partisanship; and, acting honestly for the\r\nuniversal good, he deserved, what he has so richly enjoyed, the\r\nuniversal love.\r\n\r\nHis principle it was to act right, and to trust the people for support;\r\nhis principle it was not to follow the lead of sinister and selfish\r\nends, nor to rely on the little arts of party delusion to obtain public\r\nsanction for such a course. Born for his country and for the world, he\r\ndid not give up to party what was meant for mankind. The consequence is,\r\nthat his fame is as durable as his principles, as lasting as truth and\r\nvirtue themselves. While the hundreds whom party excitement, and\r\ntemporary circumstances, and casual combinations, have raised into\r\ntransient notoriety, sink again, like thin bubbles, bursting and\r\ndissolving into the great ocean, Washington's fame is like the rock\r\nwhich bounds that ocean, and at whose feet its billows are destined to\r\nbreak harmlessly for ever.\r\n\r\nThe maxims upon which Washington conducted our foreign relations were\r\nfew and simple. The first was an entire and indisputable impartiality\r\ntowards foreign states. He adhered to this rule of public conduct,\r\nagainst very strong inducements to depart from it, and when the\r\npopularity of the moment seemed to favor such a departure. In the next\r\nplace, he maintained true dignity and unsullied honor in all\r\ncommunications with foreign states. It was among the high duties\r\ndevolved upon him, to introduce our new government into the circle of\r\ncivilized states and powerful nations. Not arrogant or assuming, with no\r\nunbecoming or supercilious bearing, he yet exacted for it from all\r\nothers entire and punctilious respect. He demanded, and he obtained at\r\nonce, a standing of perfect equality for his country in the society of\r\nnations; nor was there a prince or potentate of his day, whose personal\r\ncharacter carried with it, into the intercourse of other states, a\r\ngreater degree of respect and veneration.\r\n\r\nHe regarded other nations only as they stood in political relations to\r\nus. With their internal affairs, their political parties and\r\ndissensions, he scrupulously abstained from all interference; and, on\r\nthe other hand, he repelled with spirit all such interference by others\r\nwith us or our concerns. His sternest rebuke, the most indignant measure\r\nof his whole administration, was aimed against such an attempted\r\ninterference. He felt it as an attempt to wound the national honor, and\r\nresented it accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe reiterated admonitions in his Farewell Address show his deep fears\r\nthat foreign influence would insinuate itself into our counsels through\r\nthe channels of domestic dissension, and obtain a sympathy with our own\r\ntemporary parties. Against all such dangers, he most earnestly entreats\r\nthe country to guard itself. He appeals to its patriotism, to its\r\nself-respect, to its own honor, to every consideration connected with\r\nits welfare and happiness, to resist, at the very beginning, all\r\ntendencies towards such connection of foreign interests with our own\r\naffairs. With a tone of earnestness nowhere else found, even in his last\r\naffectionate farewell advice to his countrymen, he says, \"Against the\r\ninsidious wiles of foreign influence, (I conjure you to believe me,\r\nfellow-citizens,) the jealousy of a free people ought to be _constantly_\r\nawake; since history and experience prove, that foreign influence is one\r\nof the most baneful foes of republican government.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, on the subject of foreign relations, Washington never forgot\r\nthat we had interests peculiar to ourselves. The primary political\r\nconcerns of Europe, he saw, did not affect us. We had nothing to do with\r\nher balance of power, her family compacts, or her successions to\r\nthrones. We were placed in a condition favorable to neutrality during\r\nEuropean wars, and to the enjoyment of all the great advantages of that\r\nrelation. \"Why, then,\" he asks us, \"why forego the advantages of so\r\npeculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground?\r\nWhy, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe,\r\nentangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition,\r\nrivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, Gentlemen, Washington's Farewell Address is full of truths\r\nimportant at all times, and particularly deserving consideration at the\r\npresent. With a sagacity which brought the future before him, and made\r\nit like the present, he saw and pointed out the dangers that even at\r\nthis moment most imminently threaten us. I hardly know how a greater\r\nservice of that kind could now be done to the community, than by a\r\nrenewed and wide diffusion of that admirable paper, and an earnest\r\ninvitation to every man in the country to reperuse and consider it. Its\r\npolitical maxims are invaluable; its exhortations to love of country and\r\nto brotherly affection among citizens, touching; and the solemnity with\r\nwhich it urges the observance of moral duties, and impresses the power\r\nof religious obligation, gives to it the highest character of truly\r\ndisinterested, sincere, parental advice.\r\n\r\nThe domestic policy of Washington found its pole-star in the avowed\r\nobjects of the Constitution itself. He sought so to administer that\r\nConstitution, as to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure\r\ndomestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the\r\ngeneral welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty. These were objects\r\ninteresting, in the highest degree, to the whole country, and his policy\r\nembraced the whole country.\r\n\r\nAmong his earliest and most important duties was the organization of the\r\ngovernment itself, the choice of his confidential advisers, and the\r\nvarious appointments to office. This duty, so important and delicate,\r\nwhen a whole government was to be organized, and all its offices for the\r\nfirst time filled, was yet not difficult to him; for he had no sinister\r\nends to accomplish, no clamorous partisans to gratify, no pledges to\r\nredeem, no object to be regarded but simply the public good. It was a\r\nplain, straightforward matter, a mere honest choice of men for the\r\npublic service.\r\n\r\nHis own singleness of purpose, his disinterested patriotism, were\r\nevinced by the selection of his first Cabinet, and by the manner in\r\nwhich he filled the seats of justice, and other places of high trust. He\r\nsought for men fit for offices; not for offices which might suit men.\r\nAbove personal considerations, above local considerations, above party\r\nconsiderations, he felt that he could only discharge the sacred trust\r\nwhich the country had placed in his hands, by a diligent inquiry after\r\nreal merit, and a conscientious preference of virtue and talent. The\r\nwhole country was the field of his selection. He explored that whole\r\nfield, looking only for whatever it contained most worthy and\r\ndistinguished. He was, indeed, most successful, and he deserved success\r\nfor the purity of his motives, the liberality of his sentiments, and his\r\nenlarged and manly policy.\r\n\r\nWashington's administration established the national credit, made\r\nprovision for the public debt, and for that patriotic army whose\r\ninterests and welfare were always so dear to him; and, by laws wisely\r\nframed, and of admirable effect, raised the commerce and navigation of\r\nthe country, almost at once, from depression and ruin to a state of\r\nprosperity. Nor were his eyes open to these interests alone. He viewed\r\nwith equal concern its agriculture and manufactures, and, so far as they\r\ncame within the regular exercise of the powers of this government, they\r\nexperienced regard and favor.\r\n\r\nIt should not be omitted, even in this slight reference to the general\r\nmeasures and general principles of the first President, that he saw and\r\nfelt the full value and importance of the judicial department of the\r\ngovernment. An upright and able administration of the laws he held to be\r\nalike indispensable to private happiness and public liberty. The temple\r\nof justice, in his opinion, was a sacred place, and he would profane and\r\npollute it who should call any to minister in it, not spotless in\r\ncharacter, not incorruptible in integrity, not competent by talent and\r\nlearning, not a fit object of unhesitating trust.\r\n\r\nAmong other admonitions, Washington has left us, in his last\r\ncommunication to his country, an exhortation against the excesses of\r\nparty spirit. A fire not to be quenched, he yet conjures us not to fan\r\nand feed the flame. Undoubtedly, Gentlemen, it is the greatest danger of\r\nour system and of our time. Undoubtedly, if that system should be\r\noverthrown, it will be the work of excessive party spirit, acting on the\r\ngovernment, which is dangerous enough, or acting _in_ the government,\r\nwhich is a thousand times more dangerous; for government then becomes\r\nnothing but organized party, and, in the strange vicissitudes of human\r\naffairs, it may come at last, perhaps, to exhibit the singular paradox\r\nof government itself being in opposition to its own powers, at war with\r\nthe very elements of its own existence. Such cases are hopeless. As men\r\nmay be protected against murder, but cannot be guarded against suicide,\r\nso government may be shielded from the assaults of external foes, but\r\nnothing can save it when it chooses to lay violent hands on itself.\r\n\r\nFinally, Gentlemen, there was in the breast of Washington one sentiment\r\nso deeply felt, so constantly uppermost, that no proper occasion escaped\r\nwithout its utterance. From the letter which he signed in behalf of the\r\nConvention when the Constitution was sent out to the people, to the\r\nmoment when he put his hand to that last paper in which he addressed his\r\ncountrymen, the Union,--the Union was the great object of his thoughts.\r\nIn that first letter he tells them that, to him and his brethren of the\r\nConvention, union appears to be the greatest interest of every true\r\nAmerican; and in that last paper he conjures them to regard that unity\r\nof government which constitutes them one people as the very palladium of\r\ntheir prosperity and safety, and the security of liberty itself. He\r\nregarded the union of these States less as one of our blessings, than as\r\nthe great treasure-house which contained them all. Here, in his\r\njudgment, was the great magazine of all our means of prosperity; here,\r\nas he thought, and as every true American still thinks, are deposited\r\nall our animating prospects, all our solid hopes for future greatness.\r\nHe has taught us to maintain this union, not by seeking to enlarge the\r\npowers of the government, on the one hand, nor by surrendering them, on\r\nthe other; but by an administration of them at once firm and moderate,\r\npursuing objects truly national, and carried on in a spirit of justice\r\nand equity.\r\n\r\nThe extreme solicitude for the preservation of the Union, at all times\r\nmanifested by him, shows not only the opinion he entertained of its\r\nimportance, but his clear perception of those causes which were likely\r\nto spring up to endanger it, and which, if once they should overthrow\r\nthe present system, would leave little hope of any future beneficial\r\nreunion. Of all the presumptions indulged by presumptuous man, that is\r\none of the rashest which looks for repeated and favorable opportunities\r\nfor the deliberate establishment of a united government over distinct\r\nand widely extended communities. Such a thing has happened once in human\r\naffairs, and but once; the event stands out as a prominent exception to\r\nall ordinary history; and unless we suppose ourselves running into an\r\nage of miracles, we may not expect its repetition.\r\n\r\nWashington, therefore, could regard, and did regard, nothing as of\r\nparamount political interest, but the integrity of the Union itself.\r\nWith a united government, well administered, he saw that we had nothing\r\nto fear; and without it, nothing to hope. The sentiment is just, and its\r\nmomentous truth should solemnly impress the whole country. If we might\r\nregard our country as personated in the spirit of Washington, if we\r\nmight consider him as representing her, in her past renown, her present\r\nprosperity, and her future career, and as in that character demanding of\r\nus all to account for our conduct, as political men or as private\r\ncitizens, how should he answer him who has ventured to talk of disunion\r\nand dismemberment? Or how should he answer him who dwells perpetually on\r\nlocal interests, and fans every kindling flame of local prejudice? How\r\nshould he answer him who would array State against State, interest\r\nagainst interest, and party against party, careless of the continuance\r\nof that _unity of government which constitutes us one people_?\r\n\r\nThe political prosperity which this country has attained, and which it\r\nnow enjoys, has been acquired mainly through the instrumentality of the\r\npresent government. While this agent continues, the capacity of\r\nattaining to still higher degrees of prosperity exists also. We have,\r\nwhile this lasts, a political life capable of beneficial exertion, with\r\npower to resist or overcome misfortunes, to sustain us against the\r\nordinary accidents of human affairs, and to promote, by active efforts,\r\nevery public interest. But dismemberment strikes at the very being which\r\npreserves these faculties. It would lay its rude and ruthless hand on\r\nthis great agent itself. It would sweep away, not only what we possess,\r\nbut all power of regaining lost, or acquiring new possessions. It would\r\nleave the country, not only bereft of its prosperity and happiness, but\r\nwithout limbs, or organs, or faculties, by which to exert itself\r\nhereafter in the pursuit of that prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nOther misfortunes may be borne, or their effects overcome. If disastrous\r\nwar should sweep our commerce from the ocean, another generation may\r\nrenew it; if it exhaust our treasury, future industry may replenish it;\r\nif it desolate and lay waste our fields, still, under a new cultivation,\r\nthey will grow green again, and ripen to future harvests. It were but a\r\ntrifle even if the walls of yonder Capitol were to crumble, if its lofty\r\npillars should fall, and its gorgeous decorations be all covered by the\r\ndust of the valley. All these might be rebuilt. But who shall\r\nreconstruct the fabric of demolished government? Who shall rear again\r\nthe well-proportioned columns of constitutional liberty? Who shall frame\r\ntogether the skilful architecture which unites national sovereignty with\r\nState rights, individual security, and public prosperity? No, if these\r\ncolumns fall, they will be raised not again. Like the Coliseum and the\r\nParthenon, they will be destined to a mournful, a melancholy\r\nimmortality. Bitterer tears, however, will flow over them, than were\r\never shed over the monuments of Roman or Grecian art; for they will be\r\nthe remnants of a more glorious edifice than Greece or Rome ever saw,\r\nthe edifice of constitutional American liberty.\r\n\r\nBut let us hope for better things. Let us trust in that gracious Being\r\nwho has hitherto held our country as in the hollow of his hand. Let us\r\ntrust to the virtue and the intelligence of the people, and to the\r\nefficacy of religious obligation. Let us trust to the influence of\r\nWashington's example. Let us hope that that fear of Heaven which expels\r\nall other fear, and that regard to duty which transcends all other\r\nregard, may influence public men and private citizens, and lead our\r\ncountry still onward in her happy career. Full of these gratifying\r\nanticipations and hopes, let us look forward to the end of that century\r\nwhich is now commenced. A hundred years hence, other disciples of\r\nWashington will celebrate his birth, with no less of sincere admiration\r\nthan we now commemorate it. When they shall meet, as we now meet, to do\r\nthemselves and him that honor, so surely as they shall see the blue\r\nsummits of his native mountains rise in the horizon, so surely as they\r\nshall behold the river on whose banks he lived, and on whose banks he\r\nrests, still flowing on toward the sea, so surely may they see, as we\r\nnow see, the flag of the Union floating on the top of the Capitol; and\r\nthen, as now, may the sun in his course visit no land more free, more\r\nhappy, more lovely, than this our own country!\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I propose--\"THE MEMORY OF GEORGE WASHINGTON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Works of Fisher Ames, pp. 122, 123.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE PATRONAGE AND REMOVALS FROM OFFICE.\r\n\r\nFROM A SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN CONVENTION HELD AT\r\nWORCESTER (MASS.), ON THE 12th OF OCTOBER, 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\nI begin, Sir, with the subject of removals from office for opinion's\r\nsake, one of the most signal instances, as I think, of the attempt to\r\nextend executive power. This has been a leading measure, a cardinal\r\npoint, in the course of the administration. It has proceeded, from the\r\nfirst, on a settled proscription for political opinions; and this system\r\nit has carried into operation to the full extent of its ability. The\r\nPresident has not only filled all vacancies with his own friends,\r\ngenerally those most distinguished as personal partisans, but he has\r\nturned out political opponents, and thus created vacancies, in order\r\nthat he might fill them with his own friends. I think the number of\r\nremovals and appointments is said to be _two thousand_. While the\r\nadministration and its friends have been attempting to circumscribe and\r\nto decry the powers belonging to other branches, it has thus seized into\r\nits own hands a patronage most pernicious and corrupting, an authority\r\nover men's means of living most tyrannical and odious, and a power to\r\npunish free men for political opinions altogether intolerable.\r\n\r\nYou will remember, Sir, that the Constitution says not one word about\r\nthe President's power of removal from office. It is a power raised\r\nentirely by construction. It is a constructive power, introduced at\r\nfirst to meet cases of extreme public necessity. It has now become\r\ncoextensive with the executive will, calling for no necessity, requiring\r\nno exigency for its exercise; to be employed at all times, without\r\ncontrol, without question, without responsibility. When the question of\r\nthe President's power of removal was debated in the first Congress,\r\nthose who argued for it limited it to _extreme cases_. Cases, they said,\r\nmight arise, in which it would be _absolutely necessary_ to remove an\r\nofficer before the Senate could be assembled. An officer might become\r\ninsane; he might abscond; and from these and other supposable cases, it\r\nwas said, the public service might materially suffer if the President\r\ncould not remove the incumbent. And it was further said, that there was\r\nlittle or no danger of the abuse of the power for party or personal\r\nobjects. No President, it was thought, would ever commit such an outrage\r\non public opinion. Mr. Madison, who thought the power ought to exist,\r\nand to be exercised in cases of high necessity, declared, nevertheless,\r\nthat if a President should resort to the power when not required by any\r\npublic exigency, and merely for personal objects, _he would deserve to\r\nbe impeached_. By a very small majority,--I think, in the Senate, by the\r\ncasting vote of the Vice-President,--Congress decided in favor of the\r\nexistence of the power of removal, upon the grounds which I have\r\nmentioned; granting the power in a case of clear and absolute necessity,\r\nand denying its existence everywhere else.\r\n\r\nMr. President, we should recollect that this question was discussed,\r\nand thus decided, when Washington was in the executive chair. Men knew\r\nthat in his hands the power would not be abused; nor did they conceive\r\nit possible that any of his successors could so far depart from his\r\ngreat and bright example, as, by abuse of the power, and by carrying\r\nthat abuse to its utmost extent, to change the essential character of\r\nthe executive from that of an impartial guardian and executor of the\r\nlaws into that of the chief dispenser of party rewards. Three or four\r\ninstances of removal occurred in the first twelve years of the\r\ngovernment. At the commencement of Mr. Jefferson's administration, he\r\nmade several others, not without producing much dissatisfaction; so much\r\nso, that he thought it expedient to give reasons to the people, in a\r\npublic paper, for even the limited extent to which he had exercised the\r\npower. He rested his justification on particular circumstances and\r\npeculiar grounds; which, whether substantial or not, showed, at least,\r\nthat he did not regard the power of removal as an ordinary power, still\r\nless as a mere arbitrary one, to be used as he pleased, for whatever\r\nends he pleased, and without responsibility. As far as I remember, Sir,\r\nafter the early part of Mr. Jefferson's administration, hardly an\r\ninstance occurred for near thirty years. If there were any instances,\r\nthey were few. But at the commencement of the present administration,\r\nthe precedent of these previous cases was seized on, and a _system_, a\r\nregular _plan of government_, a well-considered scheme for the\r\nmaintenance of party power by the patronage of office, and this\r\npatronage to be created by general removal, was adopted, and has been\r\ncarried into full operation. Indeed, before General Jackson's\r\ninauguration, the party put the system into practice. In the last\r\nsession of Mr. Adams's administration, the friends of General Jackson\r\nconstituted a majority in the Senate; and nominations, made by Mr. Adams\r\nto fill vacancies which had occurred in the ordinary way, were\r\npostponed, by this majority, beyond the 3d of March, _for the purpose,\r\nopenly avowed, of giving the nominations to General Jackson_. A\r\nnomination for a judge of the Supreme Court, and many others of less\r\nmagnitude, were thus disposed of.\r\n\r\nAnd what did we witness, Sir, when the administration actually\r\ncommenced, in the full exercise of its authority? One universal sweep,\r\none undistinguishing blow, levelled against all who were not of the\r\nsuccessful party. No worth, public or private, no service, civil or\r\nmilitary, was of power to resist the relentless greediness of\r\nproscription. Soldiers of the late war, soldiers of the Revolutionary\r\nwar, the very contemporaries of the independence of the country, all\r\nlost their situations. No office was too high, and none too low; for\r\n_office_ was the spoil, and \"_all the spoils_,\" it is said, \"belong to\r\nthe _victors_\"! If a man holding an office necessary for his daily\r\nsupport had presented himself covered with the scars of wounds received\r\nin every battle, from Bunker Hill to Yorktown, these would not have\r\nprotected him against this reckless rapacity. Nay, Sir, if Warren\r\nhimself had been among the living, and had possessed any office under\r\ngovernment, high or low, he would not have been suffered to hold it a\r\nsingle hour, unless he could show that he had strictly complied with the\r\nparty statutes, and had put a well-marked party collar round his own\r\nneck. Look, Sir, to the case of the late venerable Major Melville. He\r\nwas a personification of the spirit of 1776, one of the earliest to\r\nventure in the cause of liberty. He was of the Tea Party; one of the\r\nvery first to expose himself to British power. And his whole life was\r\nconsonant with this, its beginning. Always ardent in the cause of\r\nliberty, always a zealous friend to his country, always acting with the\r\nparty which he supposed cherished the genuine republican spirit most\r\nfervently, always estimable and respectable in private life, he seemed\r\narmed against this miserable petty tyranny of party as far as man could\r\nbe. But he felt its blow, and he fell. He held an office in the\r\ncustom-house, and had held it for a long course of years; and he was\r\ndeprived of it, as if unworthy to serve the country which he loved, and\r\nfor whose liberties, in the vigor of his early manhood, he had thrust\r\nhimself into the very jaws of its enemies. There was no mistake in the\r\nmatter. His character, his standing, his Revolutionary services, were\r\nall well known; but they were known to no purpose; they weighed not one\r\nfeather against party pretensions. It cost no pains to remove him; it\r\ncost no compunction to wring his aged heart with this retribution from\r\nhis country for his services, his zeal, and his fidelity. Sir, you will\r\nbear witness,[1] that, when his successor was nominated to the Senate,\r\nand the Senate were informed who had been removed to make way for that\r\nnomination, its members were struck with horror. They had not conceived\r\nthe administration to be capable of such a thing; and yet they said,\r\nWhat can _we_ do? The man is removed; _we_ cannot recall him; we can\r\nonly act upon the nomination before us. Sir, you and I thought\r\notherwise; and I rejoice that we did think otherwise. We thought it our\r\nduty to resist the nomination to fill a vacancy thus created. We thought\r\nit our duty to oppose this proscription, when, and where, and as, we\r\nconstitutionally could. We besought the Senate to go with us, and to\r\ntake a stand before the country on this great question. We invoked them\r\nto try the deliberate sense of the people; to trust themselves before\r\nthe tribunal of public opinion; to resist at first, to resist at last,\r\nto resist always, the introduction of this unsocial, this mischievous,\r\nthis dangerous, this belligerent principle into the practice of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMr. President, as far as I know, there is no civilized country on earth,\r\nin which, on a change of rulers, there is such an _inquisition for\r\nspoil_ as we have witnessed in this free republic. The Inaugural Address\r\nof 1829 spoke of a _searching operation_ of government. The most\r\nsearching operation, Sir, of the present administration, has been its\r\nsearch for office and place. When, Sir, did any English minister, Whig\r\nor Tory, ever make such an inquest? When did he ever go down to\r\nlow-water mark, to make an ousting of tide-waiters? When did he ever\r\ntake away the daily bread of weighers, and gaugers, and measurers? When\r\ndid he ever go into the villages, to disturb the little post-offices,\r\nthe mail contracts, and every thing else in the remotest degree\r\nconnected with government? Sir, a British minister who should do this,\r\nand should afterwards show his head in a British House of Commons, would\r\nbe received by a universal hiss.\r\n\r\nI have little to say of the selections made to fill vacancies thus\r\ncreated. It is true, however, and it is a natural consequence of the\r\nsystem which has been acted on, that, within the last three years, more\r\nnominations have been rejected on the ground of _unfitness_, than in all\r\nthe preceding forty years of the government. And these nominations, you\r\nknow, Sir, could not have been rejected but by votes of the President's\r\nown friends. The cases were too strong to be resisted. Even party\r\nattachment could not stand them In some not a third of the Senate, in\r\nothers not ten votes, and in others not a single vote, could be\r\nobtained; and this for no particular reason known only to the Senate,\r\nbut on general grounds of the want of character and qualifications; on\r\ngrounds known to everybody else, as well as to the Senate. All this,\r\nSir, is perfectly natural and consistent. The same party selfishness\r\nwhich drives good men out of office will push bad men in. Political\r\nproscription leads necessarily to the filling of offices with\r\nincompetent persons, and to a consequent malexecution of official\r\nduties. And in my opinion, Sir, this principle of claiming a monopoly of\r\noffice by the right of conquest, unless the public shall effectually\r\nrebuke and restrain it, will entirely change the character of our\r\ngovernment. It elevates party above country; it forgets the common weal\r\nin the pursuit of personal emolument; it tends to form, it does form,\r\nwe see that it has formed, a political combination, united by no common\r\nprinciples or opinions among its members, either upon the powers of the\r\ngovernment, or the true policy of the country; but held together simply\r\nas an association, under the charm of a popular head, seeking to\r\nmaintain possession of the government by a _vigorous exercise of its\r\npatronage_; and for this purpose agitating, and alarming, and\r\ndistressing social life by the exercise of a tyrannical party\r\nproscription. Sir, if this course of things cannot be checked, good men\r\nwill grow tired of the exercise of political privileges. They will have\r\nnothing to do with popular elections. They will see that such elections\r\nare but a mere selfish contest for office; and they will abandon the\r\ngovernment to the scramble of the bold, the daring, and the desperate.\r\n\r\nIt seems, Mr. President, to be a peculiar and singular characteristic of\r\nthe present administration, that it came into power on a cry against\r\nabuses, _which did not exist_, and then, as soon as it was in, as if in\r\nmockery of the perception and intelligence of the people, _it created\r\nthose very abuses_, and carried them to a great length. Thus the chief\r\nmagistrate himself, before he came into the chair, in a formal public\r\npaper, denounced the practice of appointing members of Congress to\r\noffice. He said, that, if that practice continued, _corruption would\r\nbecome the order of the day_; and, as if to fasten and nail down his own\r\nconsistency to that point, he declared that it was _due to himself to\r\npractise what he recommended to others_. Yet, Sir, as soon as he was in\r\npower, these fastenings gave way, the nails all flew, and the promised\r\n_consistency_ remains a striking proof of the manner in which political\r\nassurances are sometimes fulfilled. He has already appointed more\r\nmembers of Congress to office than any of his predecessors, in the\r\nlongest period of administration. Before his time, there was no reason\r\nto complain of these appointments. They had not been numerous under any\r\nadministration. Under this, they have been numerous, and some of them\r\nsuch as may well justify complaint.\r\n\r\nAnother striking instance of the exhibition of the same characteristics\r\nmay be found in the sentiments of the Inaugural Address, and in the\r\nsubsequent practice, on the subject of _interfering with the freedom of\r\nelections_. The Inaugural Address declares, that it is necessary to\r\nreform abuses which have _brought the patronage of the government into\r\nconflict with the freedom of elections_. And what has been the\r\nsubsequent practice? Look to the newspapers; look to the published\r\nletters of officers of the government, advising, exhorting, soliciting,\r\nfriends and partisans to greater exertions in the cause of the party;\r\nsee all done, everywhere, which patronage and power can do, to affect,\r\nnot only elections in the general government, but also in every State\r\ngovernment, and then say how well _this_ promise of reforming abuses has\r\nbeen kept. At what former period, under what former administration, did\r\npublic officers of the United States thus interfere in elections?\r\nCertainly, Sir, never. In this respect, then, as well as in others, that\r\nwhich was not true as a charge against previous administrations would\r\nhave been true, if it had assumed the form of a prophecy respecting the\r\nacts of the present.\r\n\r\nBut there is another attempt to grasp and to wield a power over public\r\nopinion, of a still more daring character, and far more dangerous\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIn all popular governments, a FREE PRESS is the most important of all\r\nagents and instruments. It not only expresses public opinion, but, to a\r\nvery great degree, it contributes to form that opinion. It is an engine\r\nfor good or for evil, as it may be directed; but an engine of which\r\nnothing can resist the force. The conductors of the press, in popular\r\ngovernments, occupy a place, in the social and political system, of the\r\nvery highest consequence. They wear the character of public instructors.\r\nTheir daily labors bear directly on the intelligence, the morals, the\r\ntaste, and the public spirit of the country. Not only are they\r\njournalists, recording political occurrences, but they discuss\r\nprinciples, they comment on measures, they canvass characters; they hold\r\na power over the reputation, the feelings, the happiness of individuals.\r\nThe public ear is always open to their addresses, the public sympathy\r\neasily made responsive to their sentiments. It is indeed, Sir, a\r\ndistinction of high honor, that theirs is the only profession expressly\r\nprotected and guarded by constitutional enactments. Their employment\r\nsoars so high, in its general consequences it is so intimately connected\r\nwith the public happiness, that its security is provided for by the\r\nfundamental law. While it acts in a manner worthy of this distinction,\r\nthe press is a fountain of light, and a source of gladdening warmth. It\r\ninstructs the public mind, and animates the spirit of patriotism. Its\r\nloud voice suppresses every thing which would raise itself against the\r\npublic liberty; and its blasting rebuke causes incipient despotism to\r\nperish in the bud.\r\n\r\nBut remember, Sir, that these are the attributes of a FREE press only.\r\nAnd is a press that is purchased or pensioned more free than a press\r\nthat is fettered? Can the people look for truths to partial sources,\r\nwhether rendered partial through fear or through favor? Why shall not a\r\nmanacled press be trusted with the maintenance and defence of popular\r\nrights? Because it is supposed to be under the influence of a power\r\nwhich may prove greater than the love of truth. Such a press may screen\r\nabuses in government, or be silent. It may fear to speak. And may it not\r\nfear to speak, too, when its conductors, if they speak in any but one\r\nway, may lose their means of livelihood? Is dependence on government for\r\nbread no temptation to screen its abuses? Will the press always speak\r\nthe truth, when the truth, if spoken, may be the means of silencing it\r\nfor the future? Is the truth in no danger, is the watchman under no\r\ntemptation, when he can neither proclaim the approach of national evils,\r\nnor seem to descry them, without the loss of his place?\r\n\r\nMr. President, an open attempt to secure the aid and friendship of the\r\npublic press, by bestowing the emoluments of office on its active\r\nconductors, seems to me, of every thing we have witnessed, to be the\r\nmost reprehensible. It degrades both the government and the press. As\r\nfar as its natural effect extends, it turns the palladium of liberty\r\ninto an engine of party. It brings the agency, activity, energy, and\r\npatronage of government all to bear, with united force, on the means of\r\ngeneral intelligence, and on the adoption or rejection of political\r\nopinions. It so completely perverts the true object of government, it so\r\nentirely revolutionizes our whole system, that the chief business of\r\nthose in power is directed rather to the propagation of opinions\r\nfavorable to themselves, than to the execution of the laws. This\r\npropagation of opinions, through the press, becomes the main\r\nadministrative duty. Some fifty or sixty editors of leading journals\r\nhave been appointed to office by the present executive. A stand has been\r\nmade against this proceeding, in the Senate, with partial success; but,\r\nby means of appointments which do not come before the Senate, or other\r\nmeans, the number has been carried to the extent I have mentioned.\r\nCertainly, Sir, the editors of the public journals are not to be\r\ndisfranchised. Certainly they are fair candidates, either for popular\r\nelections, or a just participation in office. Certainly they reckon in\r\ntheir number some of the first geniuses, the best scholars, and the most\r\nhonest and well-principled men in the country. But the complaint is\r\nagainst the _system_, against the _practice_, against the undisguised\r\nattempt to secure the favor of the press by means addressed to its\r\npecuniary interest, and these means, too, drawn from the public\r\ntreasury, being no other than the appointed compensations for the\r\nperformance of official duties. Sir, the press itself should resent\r\nthis. Its own character for purity and independence is at stake. It\r\nshould resist a connection rendering it obnoxious to so many\r\nimputations. It should point to its honorable denomination in our\r\nconstitutions of government, and it should maintain the character, there\r\nascribed to it, of a FREE PRESS.\r\n\r\nThere can, Sir, be no objection to the appointment of an editor to\r\noffice, if he is the fittest man. There can be no objection to\r\nconsidering the services which, in that or in any other capacity, he may\r\nhave rendered his country. He may have done much to maintain her rights\r\nagainst foreign aggression, and her character against insult. He may\r\nhave honored, as well as defended her; and may, therefore, be justly\r\nregarded and selected, in the choice of faithful public agents. But the\r\nground of complaint is, that the aiding, by the press, of the election\r\nof an individual, is rewarded, by that same individual, with the gift of\r\nmoneyed offices. Men are turned out of office, and others put in, and\r\nreceive salaries from the public treasury, on the ground, either openly\r\navowed or falsely denied, that they have rendered service in the\r\nelection of the very individual who makes this removal and makes this\r\nappointment. Every man, Sir, must see that this is a vital stab at the\r\npurity of the press. It not only assails its independence, by addressing\r\nsinister motives to it, but it furnishes from the public treasury the\r\nmeans of exciting these motives. It extends the executive power over the\r\npress in a most daring manner. It operates to give a direction to\r\nopinion, not favorable to the government, in the aggregate; not\r\nfavorable to the Constitution and laws; not favorable to the\r\nlegislature; but favorable to the executive alone. The consequence often\r\nis, just what might be looked for, that the portion of the press thus\r\nmade fast to the executive interest denounces Congress, denounces the\r\njudiciary, complains of the laws, and quarrels with the Constitution.\r\nThis exercise of the right of appointment to this end is an\r\naugmentation, and a vast one, of the executive power, singly and alone.\r\nIt uses that power strongly against all other branches of the\r\ngovernment, and it uses it strongly, too, for any struggle which it may\r\nbe called on to make with the public opinion of the country. Mr.\r\nPresident, I will quit this topic. There is much in it, in my judgment,\r\naffecting, not only the purity and independence of the press, but also\r\nthe character and honor, the peace and security, of the government. I\r\nleave it, in all its bearings, to the consideration of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Hon. Nathaniel Silsbee, President of the Convention, was\r\nMr. Webster's colleague in the Senate at the time referred to.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE USURPATION.\r\n\r\nFROM THE SAME SPEECH AT WORCESTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President, the executive has not only used these unaccustomed means\r\nto prevent the passage of laws, but it has also refused to enforce the\r\nexecution of laws actually passed. An eminent instance of this is found\r\nin the course adopted relative to the Indian intercourse law of 1802.\r\nUpon being applied to, in behalf of the MISSIONARIES, to execute that\r\nlaw, for their relief and protection, the President replied, that _the\r\nState of Georgia having extended her laws over the Indian territory, the\r\nlaws of Congress had thereby been superseded_. This is the substance of\r\nhis answer, as communicated through the Secretary of War. He holds,\r\nthen, that the law of the State is paramount to the law of Congress. The\r\nSupreme Court has adjudged this act of Georgia to be void, as being\r\nrepugnant to a constitutional law of the United States. But the\r\nPresident pays no more regard to this decision than to the act of\r\nCongress itself. The missionaries remain in prison, held there by a\r\ncondemnation under a law of a State which the supreme judicial tribunal\r\nhas pronounced to be null and void. The Supreme Court have decided that\r\nthe act of Congress is constitutional; that it is a binding statute;\r\nthat it has the same force as other laws, and is as much entitled to be\r\nobeyed and executed as other laws. The President, on the contrary,\r\ndeclares that the law of Congress has been superseded by the law of the\r\nState, and therefore he will not carry its provisions into effect. Now\r\nwe know, Sir, that the Constitution of the United States declares, that\r\nthat Constitution, and all acts of Congress passed in pursuance of it,\r\nshall be the supreme law of the land, any thing in any State law to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding. This would seem to be a plain case, then, in\r\nwhich the law should be executed. It has been solemnly decided to be in\r\nactual force, by the highest judicial authority; its execution is\r\ndemanded for the relief of free citizens, now suffering the pains of\r\nunjust and unlawful imprisonment; yet the President refuses to execute\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Chicago Road, some sessions ago, the President\r\napproved the bill, but accompanied his approval by a message, saying how\r\nfar he deemed it a proper law, and how far, therefore, it ought to be\r\ncarried into execution.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the harbor bill of the late session, being applied to by\r\na member of Congress for directions for carrying parts of the law into\r\neffect, he declined giving them, and made a distinction between such\r\nparts of the law as he should cause to be executed, and such as he\r\nshould not; and his right to make this distinction has been openly\r\nmaintained, by those who habitually defend his measures. Indeed, Sir,\r\nthese, and other instances of liberties taken with plain statute laws,\r\nflow naturally from the principles expressly avowed by the President,\r\nunder his own hand. In that important document, Sir, upon which it seems\r\nto be his fate to stand or to fall before the American people, the veto\r\nmessage, he holds the following language: \"Each public officer who\r\ntakes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support\r\nit as he understands it, and not as it is understood by others.\" Mr.\r\nPresident, the general adoption of the sentiments expressed in this\r\nsentence would dissolve our government. It would raise every man's\r\nprivate opinions into a standard for his own conduct; and there\r\ncertainly is, there can be, no government, where every man is to judge\r\nfor himself of his own rights and his own obligations. Where every one\r\nis his own arbiter, force, and not law, is the governing power. He who\r\nmay judge for himself, and decide for himself, must execute his own\r\ndecisions; and this is the law of force. I confess, Sir, it strikes me\r\nwith astonishment, that so wild, so disorganizing, a sentiment should be\r\nuttered by a President of the United States. I should think it must have\r\nescaped from its author through want of reflection, or from the habit of\r\nlittle reflection on such subjects, if I could suppose it possible,\r\nthat, on a question exciting so much public attention, and of so much\r\nnational importance, any such extraordinary doctrine could find its way,\r\nthrough inadvertence, into a formal and solemn public act. Standing as\r\nit does, it affirms a proposition which would effectually repeal all\r\nconstitutional and all legal obligations. The Constitution declares,\r\nthat every public officer, in the State governments as well as in the\r\ngeneral government, shall take an oath to support the Constitution of\r\nthe United States. This is all. Would it not have cast an air of\r\nridicule on the whole provision, if the Constitution had gone on to add\r\nthe words, \"as he understands it\"? What could come nearer to a solemn\r\nfarce, than to bind a man by oath, and still leave him to be his own\r\ninterpreter of his own obligation? Sir, those who are to execute the\r\nlaws have no more a license to construe them for themselves, than those\r\nwhose only duty is to obey them. Public officers are bound to support\r\nthe Constitution; private citizens are bound to obey it; and there is no\r\nmore indulgence granted to the public officer to support the\r\nConstitution only _as he understands it_, than to a private citizen to\r\nobey it only _as he understands it_, and what is true of the\r\nConstitution, in this respect, is equally true of any law. Laws are to\r\nbe executed, and to be obeyed, not as individuals may interpret them,\r\nbut according to public, authoritative interpretation and adjudication.\r\nThe sentiment of the message would abrogate the obligation of the whole\r\ncriminal code. If every man is to judge of the Constitution and the laws\r\nfor himself, if he is to obey and support them only as he may say he\r\nunderstands them, a revolution, I think, would take place in the\r\nadministration of justice; and discussions about the law of treason,\r\nmurder, and arson should be addressed, not to the judicial bench, but to\r\nthose who might stand charged with such offences. The object of\r\ndiscussion should be, if we run out this notion to its natural extent,\r\nto enlighten the culprit himself how he ought to understand the law.\r\n\r\nMr. President, how is it possible that a sentiment so wild, and so\r\ndangerous, so encouraging to all who feel a desire to oppose the laws,\r\nand to impair the Constitution, should have been uttered by the\r\nPresident of the United States at this eventful and critical moment? Are\r\nwe not threatened with dissolution of the Union? Are we not told that\r\nthe laws of the government shall be openly and directly resisted? Is not\r\nthe whole country looking, with the utmost anxiety, to what may be the\r\nresult of these threatened courses? And at this very moment, so full of\r\nperil to the state, the chief magistrate puts forth opinions and\r\nsentiments as truly subversive of all government, as absolutely in\r\nconflict with the authority of the Constitution, as the wildest theories\r\nof nullification. Mr. President, I have very little regard for the law,\r\nor the logic, of nullification. But there is not an individual in its\r\nranks, capable of putting two ideas together, who, if you will grant him\r\nthe principles of the veto message, cannot defend all that nullification\r\nhas ever threatened.\r\n\r\nTo make this assertion good, Sir, let us see how the case stands. The\r\nLegislature of South Carolina, it is said, will nullify the late revenue\r\nor tariff law, because, _they say_, it is not warranted by the\r\nConstitution of the United States, _as they understand the\r\nConstitution_. They, as well as the President of the United States, have\r\nsworn to support the Constitution. Both he and they have taken the same\r\noath, in the same words. Now, Sir, since he claims the right to\r\ninterpret the Constitution as he pleases, how can he deny the same right\r\nto them? Is his oath less stringent than theirs? Has he a prerogative of\r\ndispensation which they do not possess? How can he answer them, when\r\nthey tell him, that the revenue laws are unconstitutional, _as they\r\nunderstand the Constitution_, and that therefore they will nullify them?\r\nWill he reply to them, according to the doctrines of his annual message\r\nin 1830, that _precedent_ has settled the question, if it was ever\r\ndoubtful? They will answer him in his own words in the veto message,\r\nthat, in such a case, _precedent_ is not binding. Will he say to them,\r\nthat the revenue law is a law of Congress, which must be executed until\r\nit shall be declared void? They will answer him, that, in other cases,\r\nhe has himself refused to execute laws of Congress which had not been\r\ndeclared void, but which had been, on the contrary, declared valid. Will\r\nhe urge the force of judicial decisions? They will answer, that he\r\nhimself does not admit the binding obligation of such decisions. Sir,\r\nthe President of the United States is of opinion, that an individual,\r\ncalled on to execute a law, may himself judge of its constitutional\r\nvalidity. Does nullification teach any thing more revolutionary than\r\nthat? The President is of opinion, that judicial interpretations of the\r\nConstitution and the laws do not bind the consciences, and ought not to\r\nbind the conduct, of men. Is nullification at all more disorganizing\r\nthan that? The President is of opinion, that every officer is bound to\r\nsupport the Constitution only according to what ought to be, in his\r\nprivate opinion, its construction. Has nullification, in its wildest\r\nflight, ever reached to an extravagance like that? No, Sir, never. The\r\ndoctrine of nullification, in my judgment a most false, dangerous, and\r\nrevolutionary doctrine, is this: that _the State_, or _a State_, may\r\ndeclare the extent of the obligations which its citizens are under to\r\nthe United States; in other words, that a State, by State laws and State\r\njudicatures, may conclusively construe the Constitution for its own\r\ncitizens. But that every individual may construe it for himself is a\r\nrefinement on the theory of resistance to constitutional power, a\r\nsublimation of the right of being disloyal to the Union, a free charter\r\nfor the elevation of private opinion above the authority of the\r\nfundamental law of the state, such as was never presented to the public\r\nview, and the public astonishment, even by nullification itself. Its\r\nfirst appearance is in the veto message. Melancholy, lamentable, indeed,\r\nSir, is our condition, when, at a moment of serious danger and\r\nwide-spread alarm, such sentiments are found to proceed from the chief\r\nmagistrate of the government. Sir, I cannot feel that the Constitution\r\nis safe in such hands. I cannot feel that the present administration is\r\nits fit and proper guardian.\r\n\r\nBut let me ask, Sir, what evidence there is, that the President is\r\nhimself opposed to the doctrines of nullification: I do not say to the\r\npolitical party which now pushes these doctrines, but to the doctrines\r\nthemselves. Has he anywhere rebuked them? Has he anywhere discouraged\r\nthem? Has his influence been exerted to inspire respect for the\r\nConstitution, and to produce obedience to the laws? Has he followed the\r\nbright example of his predecessors? Has he held fast by the institutions\r\nof the country? Has he summoned the good and the wise around him? Has he\r\nadmonished the country that the Union is in danger, and called on all\r\nthe patriotic to come out in its support? Alas! Sir, we have seen\r\nnothing, nothing, of all this.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I shall not discuss the doctrine of nullification. I am\r\nsure it can have no friends here. Gloss it and disguise it as we may, it\r\nis a pretence incompatible with the authority of the Constitution. If\r\ndirect separation be not its only mode of operation, separation is,\r\nnevertheless, its direct consequence. That a State may nullify a law of\r\nthe Union, and still remain _in_ the Union; that she may have Senators\r\nand Representatives in the government, and yet be at liberty to disobey\r\nand resist that government; that she may partake in the common councils,\r\nand yet not be bound by their results; that she may control a law of\r\nCongress, so that it shall be one thing with her, while it is another\r\nthing with the rest of the States;--all these propositions seem to me so\r\nabsolutely at war with common sense and reason, that I do not understand\r\nhow any intelligent person can yield the slightest assent to them.\r\nNullification, it is in vain to attempt to conceal it, is dissolution;\r\nit is dismemberment; it is the breaking up of the Union. If it shall\r\npractically succeed in any one State, from that moment there are\r\ntwenty-four States in the Union no longer. Now, Sir, I think it\r\nexceedingly probable that the President may come to an open rupture with\r\nthat portion of his original party which now constitutes what is called\r\nthe Nullification party. I think it likely he will oppose the\r\nproceedings of that party, if they shall adopt measures coming directly\r\nin conflict with the laws of the United States. But how will he oppose?\r\nWhat will be his course of remedy? Sir, I wish to call the attention of\r\nthe Convention, and of the people, earnestly to this question,--How will\r\nthe President attempt to put down nullification, if he shall attempt it\r\nat all?\r\n\r\nSir, for one, I protest in advance against such remedies as I have heard\r\nhinted. The administration itself keeps a profound silence, but its\r\nfriends have spoken for it. We are told, Sir, that the President will\r\nimmediately employ the military force, and at once blockade Charleston!\r\nA military remedy, a remedy by direct belligerent operation, has been\r\nthus suggested, and nothing else has been suggested, as the intended\r\nmeans of preserving the Union. Sir, there is no little reason to think,\r\nthat this suggestion is true. We cannot be altogether unmindful of the\r\npast, and therefore we cannot be altogether unapprehensive for the\r\nfuture. For one, Sir, I raise my voice beforehand against the\r\nunauthorized employment of military power, and against superseding the\r\nauthority of the laws, by an armed force, under pretence of putting down\r\nnullification. The President has no authority to blockade Charleston;\r\nthe President has no authority to employ military force, till he shall\r\nbe duly required so to do, by law, and by the civil authorities. His\r\nduty is to cause the laws to be executed. His duty is to support the\r\ncivil authority. His duty is, if the laws be resisted, to employ the\r\nmilitary force of the country, if necessary, for their support and\r\nexecution; but to do all this in compliance only with law, and with\r\ndecisions of the tribunals. If, by any ingenious devices, those who\r\nresist the laws escape from the reach of judicial authority, as it is\r\nnow provided to be exercised, it is entirely competent to Congress to\r\nmake such new provisions as the exigency of the case may demand. These\r\nprovisions undoubtedly would be made. With a constitutional and\r\nefficient head of the government, with an administration really and\r\ntruly in favor of the Constitution, the country can grapple with\r\nnullification. By the force of reason, by the progress of enlightened\r\nopinion, by the natural, genuine patriotism of the country, and by the\r\nsteady and well-sustained operations of law, the progress of\r\ndisorganization may be successfully checked, and the Union maintained.\r\nLet it be remembered, that, where nullification is most powerful, it is\r\nnot unopposed. Let it be remembered, that they who would break up the\r\nUnion by force have to march toward that object through thick ranks of\r\nas brave and good men as the country can show,--men strong in character,\r\nstrong in intelligence, strong in the purity of their own motives, and\r\nready, always ready, to sacrifice their fortunes and their lives to the\r\npreservation of the constitutional union of the States. If we can\r\nrelieve the country from an administration which denies to the\r\nConstitution those powers which are the breath of its life; if we can\r\nplace the government in the hands of its friends; if we can secure it\r\nagainst the dangers of irregular and unlawful military force; if it can\r\nbe under the lead of an administration whose moderation, firmness, and\r\nwisdom shall inspire confidence and command respect,--we may yet\r\nsurmount the dangers, numerous and formidable as they are, which\r\nsurround us.\r\n\r\nSir, I see little prospect of overcoming these dangers without a change\r\nof men. After all that has passed, the re-election of the present\r\nexecutive will give the national sanction to sentiments and to measures\r\nwhich will effectually change the government; which, in short, must\r\ndestroy the government. If the President be re-elected, with concurrent\r\nand co-operating majorities in both houses of Congress, I do not see,\r\nthat, in four years more, all the power which is suffered to remain in\r\nthe government will not be held by the executive hand. Nullification\r\nwill proceed, or will be put down by a power as unconstitutional as\r\nitself. The revenues will be managed by a treasury bank. The use of the\r\nveto will be considered as sanctioned by the public voice. The Senate,\r\nif not \"cut down,\" will be bound down, and, the President commanding the\r\narmy and the navy, and holding all places of trust to be party property,\r\nwhat will then be left, Sir, for constitutional reliance?\r\n\r\nSir, we have been accustomed to venerate the judiciary, and to repose\r\nhopes of safety on that branch of the government. But let us not deceive\r\nourselves. The judicial power cannot stand for a long time against the\r\nexecutive power. The judges, it is true, hold their places by an\r\nindependent tenure; but they are mortal. That which is the common lot of\r\nhumanity must make it necessary to renew the benches of justice. And how\r\nwill they be filled? Doubtless, Sir, they will be filled by judges\r\nagreeing with the President in his constitutional opinions. If the court\r\nis felt as an obstacle, the first opportunity and every opportunity will\r\ncertainly be embraced to give it less and less the character of an\r\nobstacle. Sir, without pursuing these suggestions, I only say that the\r\ncountry must prepare itself for any change in the judicial department\r\nsuch as it shall deliberately sanction in other departments.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, what is the prospect of change? Is there any hope that the\r\nnational sentiment will recover its accustomed tone, and restore to the\r\ngovernment a just and efficient administration?\r\n\r\nSir, if there be something of doubt on this point, there is also\r\nsomething, perhaps much, of hope. The popularity of the present chief\r\nmagistrate, springing from causes not connected with his administration\r\nof the government, has been great. Public gratitude for military service\r\nhas remained fast to him, in defiance of many things in his civil\r\nadministration calculated to weaken its hold. At length there are\r\nindications, not to be mistaken, of new sentiments and new impressions.\r\nAt length, a conviction of danger to important interests, and to the\r\nsecurity of the government, has made its lodgement in the public mind.\r\nAt length, public sentiment begins to have its free course and to\r\nproduce its just effects. I fully believe, Sir, that a great majority of\r\nthe nation desire a change in the administration; and that it will be\r\ndifficult for party organization or party denunciation to suppress the\r\neffective utterance of that general wish. There are unhappy differences,\r\nit is true, about the fit person to be successor to the present\r\nincumbent in the chief magistracy; and it is possible that this disunion\r\nmay, in the end, defeat the will of the majority. But so far as we agree\r\ntogether, let us act together. Wherever our sentiments concur, let our\r\nhands co-operate. If we cannot at present agree who should be\r\nPresident, we are at least agreed who ought not to be. I fully believe,\r\nSir, that gratifying intelligence is already on the wing. While we are\r\nyet deliberating in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania is voting. This week,\r\nshe elects her members to the next Congress. I doubt not the result of\r\nthat election will show an important change in public sentiment in that\r\nState; nor can I doubt that the great States adjoining her, holding\r\nsimilar constitutional principles and having similar interests, will\r\nfeel the impulse of the same causes which affect her. The people of the\r\nUnited States, by a countless majority, are attached to the\r\nConstitution. If they shall be convinced that it is in danger, they will\r\ncome to its rescue, and will save it. It cannot be destroyed, even now,\r\nif THEY will undertake its guardianship and protection.\r\n\r\nBut suppose, Sir, there was less hope than there is, would that\r\nconsideration weaken the force of our obligations? Are we at a post\r\nwhich we are at liberty to desert when it becomes difficult to hold it?\r\nMay we fly at the approach of danger? Does our fidelity to the\r\nConstitution require no more of us than to enjoy its blessings, to bask\r\nin the prosperity which it has shed around us and our fathers? and are\r\nwe at liberty to abandon it in the hour of its peril, or to make for it\r\nbut a faint and heartless struggle, for the want of encouragement and\r\nthe want of hope? Sir, if no State come to our succor, if everywhere\r\nelse the contest should be given up, here let it be protracted to the\r\nlast moment. Here, where the first blood of the Revolution was shed, let\r\nthe last effort be made for that which is the greatest blessing obtained\r\nby the Revolution, a free and united government. Sir, in our endeavors\r\nto maintain our existing forms of government, we are acting not for\r\nourselves alone, but for the great cause of constitutional liberty all\r\nover the globe. We are trustees holding a sacred treasure, in which all\r\nthe lovers of freedom have a stake. Not only in revolutionized France,\r\nwhere there are no longer subjects, where the monarch can no longer say,\r\nI am the state; not only in reformed England, where our principles, our\r\ninstitutions, our practice of free government, are now daily quoted and\r\ncommended; but in the depths of Germany, also, and among the desolated\r\nfields and the still smoking ashes of Poland, prayers are uttered for\r\nthe preservation of our union and happiness. We are surrounded, Sir, by\r\na cloud of witnesses. The gaze of the sons of liberty, everywhere, is\r\nupon us, anxiously, intently, upon us. They may see us fall in the\r\nstruggle for our Constitution and government, but Heaven forbid that\r\nthey should see us recreant.\r\n\r\nAt least, Sir, let the star of Massachusetts be the last which shall be\r\nseen to fall from heaven, and to plunge into the utter darkness of\r\ndisunion. Let her shrink back, let her hold others back if she can, at\r\nany rate, let her keep herself back, from this gulf, full at once of\r\nfire and of blackness; yes, Sir, as far as human foresight can scan, or\r\nhuman imagination fathom, full of the fire and the blood of civil war,\r\nand of the thick darkness of general political disgrace, ignominy, and\r\nruin. Though the worst may happen that can happen, and though she may\r\nnot be able to prevent the catastrophe, yet let her maintain her own\r\nintegrity, her own high honor, her own unwavering fidelity, so that with\r\nrespect and decency, though with a broken and a bleeding heart, she may\r\npay the last tribute to a glorious, departed, free Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL HATRED OF THE POOR TO THE RICH.\r\n\r\nFROM A SPEECH IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, JANUARY 31st 1834, ON\r\n\"THE REMOVAL OF THE DEPOSITS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSir, there is one other subject on which I wish to raise my voice. There\r\nis a topic which I perceive is to become the general war-cry of party,\r\non which I take the liberty to warn the country against delusion. Sir,\r\nthe cry is to be raised that this is a question between the poor and the\r\nrich. I know, Sir, it has been proclaimed, that one thing was certain,\r\nthat there was always a hatred on the part of the poor toward the rich;\r\nand that this hatred would support the late measures, and the putting\r\ndown of the bank. Sir, I will not be silent at the threat of such a\r\ndetestable fraud on public opinion. If but ten men, or one man, in the\r\nnation will hear my voice, I will still warn them against this attempted\r\nimposition.\r\n\r\nMr. President, this is an eventful moment. On the great questions which\r\noccupy us, we all look for some decisive movement of public opinion. As\r\nI wish that movement to be free, intelligent, and unbiassed, the true\r\nmanifestation of the public will, I desire to prepare the country for\r\nanother appeal, which I perceive is about to be made to popular\r\nprejudice, another attempt to obscure all distinct views of the public\r\ngood, to overwhelm all patriotism and all enlightened self-interest, by\r\nloud cries against false danger, and by exciting the passions of one\r\nclass against another. I am not mistaken in the omen; I see the magazine\r\nwhence the weapons of this warfare are to be drawn. I hear already the\r\ndin of the hammering of arms preparatory to the combat. They may be such\r\narms, perhaps, as reason, and justice, and honest patriotism cannot\r\nresist. Every effort at resistance, it is possible, may be feeble and\r\npowerless; but, for one, I shall make an effort,--an effort to be begun\r\nnow, and to be carried on and continued, with untiring zeal, till the\r\nend of the contest.\r\n\r\nSir, I see, in those vehicles which carry to the people sentiments from\r\nhigh places, plain declarations that the present controversy is but a\r\nstrife between one part of the community and another. I hear it boasted\r\nas the unfailing security, the solid ground, never to be shaken, on\r\nwhich recent measures rest, _that the poor naturally hate the rich_. I\r\nknow that, under the cover of the roofs of the Capitol, within the last\r\ntwenty-four hours, among men sent here to devise means for the public\r\nsafety and the public good, it has been vaunted forth, as matter of\r\nboast and triumph, that one cause existed powerful enough to support\r\nevery thing and to defend every thing; and that was, _the natural hatred\r\nof the poor to the rich_.\r\n\r\nSir, I pronounce the author of such sentiments to be guilty of\r\nattempting a detestable fraud on the community; a double fraud; a fraud\r\nwhich is to cheat men out of their property, and out of the earnings of\r\ntheir labor, by first cheating them out of their understandings.\r\n\r\n\"The natural hatred of the poor to the rich!\" Sir, it shall not be till\r\nthe last moment of my existence,--it shall be only when I am drawn to\r\nthe verge of oblivion, when I shall cease to have respect or affection\r\nfor any thing on earth,--that I will believe the people of the United\r\nStates capable of being effectually deluded, cajoled, and _driven about\r\nin herds_, by such abominable frauds as this. If they shall sink to that\r\npoint, if they so far cease to be men, thinking men, intelligent men, as\r\nto yield to such pretences and such clamor, they will be slaves already;\r\nslaves to their own passions, slaves to the fraud and knavery of\r\npretended friends. They will deserve to be blotted out of all the\r\nrecords of freedom; they ought not to dishonor the cause of\r\nself-government, by attempting any longer to exercise it; they ought to\r\nkeep their unworthy hands entirely off from the cause of republican\r\nliberty, if they are capable of being the victims of artifices so\r\nshallow, of tricks so stale, so threadbare, so often practised, so much\r\nworn out, on serfs and slaves.\r\n\r\n\"The natural hatred of the poor against the rich!\" \"The danger of a\r\nmoneyed aristocracy!\" \"A power as great and dangerous as that resisted\r\nby the Revolution!\" \"A call to a new declaration of independence!\" Sir,\r\nI admonish the people against the object of outcries like these. I\r\nadmonish every industrious laborer in the country to be on his guard\r\nagainst such delusion. I tell him the attempt is to play off his\r\npassions against his interests, and to prevail on him, in the name of\r\nliberty, to destroy all the fruits of liberty; in the name of\r\npatriotism, to injure and afflict his country; and in the name of his\r\nown independence, to destroy that very independence, and make him a\r\nbeggar and a slave. Has he a dollar? He is advised to do that which will\r\ndestroy half its value. Has he hands to labor? Let him rather fold them,\r\nand sit still, than be pushed on, by fraud and artifice, to support\r\nmeasures which will render his labor useless and hopeless.\r\n\r\nSir, the very man, of all others, who has the deepest interest in a\r\nsound currency, and who suffers most by mischievous legislation in money\r\nmatters, is the man who earns his daily bread by his daily toil. A\r\ndepreciated currency, sudden changes of prices, paper money, falling\r\nbetween morning and noon, and falling still lower between noon and\r\nnight,--these things constitute the very harvest-time of speculators,\r\nand of the whole race of those who are at once idle and crafty; and of\r\nthat other race, too, the Catilines of all times, marked, so as to be\r\nknown for ever by one stroke of the historian's pen, _those greedy of\r\nother men's property and prodigal of their own_. Capitalists, too, may\r\noutlive such times. They may either prey on the earnings of labor, by\r\ntheir _cent. per cent._, or they may hoard. But the laboring man, what\r\ncan he hoard? Preying on nobody, he becomes the prey of all. His\r\nproperty is in his hands. His reliance, his fund, his productive\r\nfreehold, his all, is his labor. Whether he work on his own small\r\ncapital, or another's, his living is still earned by his industry; and\r\nwhen the money of the country becomes depreciated and debased, whether\r\nit be adulterated coin or paper without credit, that industry is robbed\r\nof its reward. He then labors for a country whose laws cheat him out of\r\nhis bread. I would say to every owner of every quarter-section of land\r\nin the West, I would say to every man in the East who follows his own\r\nplough, and to every mechanic, artisan, and laborer in every city in the\r\ncountry,--I would say to every man, everywhere, who wishes by honest\r\nmeans to gain an honest living, \"Beware of wolves in sheep's clothing.\r\nWhoever attempts, under whatever popular cry, to shake the stability of\r\nthe public currency, bring on distress in money matters, and drive the\r\ncountry into the use of paper money, stabs your interest and your\r\nhappiness to the heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe herd of hungry wolves who live on other men's earnings will rejoice\r\nin such a state of things. A system which absorbs into their pockets the\r\nfruits of other men's industry is the very system for them. A government\r\nthat produces or countenances uncertainty, fluctuations, violent\r\nrisings and fallings in prices, and, finally, paper money, is a\r\ngovernment exactly after their own heart. Hence these men are always for\r\nchange. They will never let well enough alone. A condition of public\r\naffairs in which property is safe, industry certain of its reward, and\r\nevery man secure in his own hard-earned gains, is no paradise for them.\r\nGive them just the reverse of this state of things; bring on change, and\r\nchange after change; let it not be known to-day what will be the value\r\nof property to-morrow; let no man be able to say whether the money in\r\nhis pockets at night will be money or worthless rags in the morning; and\r\ndepress labor till double work shall earn but half a living,--give them\r\nthis state of things, and you give them the consummation of their\r\nearthly bliss.\r\n\r\nSir, the great interest of this great country, the producing cause of\r\nall its prosperity, is labor! labor! labor! We are a laboring community.\r\nA vast majority of us all live by industry and actual employment in some\r\nof their forms. The Constitution was made to protect this industry, to\r\ngive it both encouragement and security; but, above all, security. To\r\nthat very end, with that precise object in view, power was given to\r\nCongress over the currency, and over the money system of the country. In\r\nforty years' experience, we have found nothing at all adequate to the\r\nbeneficial execution of this trust but a well-conducted national bank.\r\nThat has been tried, returned to, tried again, and always found\r\nsuccessful. If it be not the proper thing for us, let it be soberly\r\nargued against; let something better be proposed; let the country\r\nexamine the matter coolly, and decide for itself. But whoever shall\r\nattempt to carry a question of this kind by clamor, and violence, and\r\nprejudice; whoever would rouse the people by appeals, false and\r\nfraudulent appeals, to their love of independence, to resist the\r\nestablishment of a useful institution, because it is a bank, and deals\r\nin money, and who artfully urges these appeals wherever he thinks there\r\nis more of honest feeling than of enlightened judgment,--means nothing\r\nbut deception. And whoever has the wickedness to conceive, and the\r\nhardihood to avow, a purpose to break down what has been found, in forty\r\nyears' experience, essential to the protection of all interests, by\r\narraying one class against another, and by acting on such a principle as\r\n_that the poor always hate the rich_, shows himself the reckless enemy\r\nof all. An enemy to his whole country, to all classes, and to every man\r\nin it, he deserves to be marked especially _as the poor man's curse_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA REDEEMABLE PAPER CURRENCY.\r\n\r\nFROM A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, ON THE 22D\r\nOF FEBRUARY, 1834.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President,--The honorable member from Georgia stated yesterday, more\r\ndistinctly than I have before learned it, what that experiment is which\r\nthe government is now trying on the revenues and the currency, and, I\r\nmay add, on the commerce, manufactures, and agriculture of this country.\r\nIf I rightly apprehend him, this experiment is an attempt to return to\r\nan exclusive specie currency, first, by employing the State banks as a\r\nsubstitute for the Bank of the United States; and then by dispensing\r\nwith the use of the State banks themselves.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is the experiment. I thank the gentleman for thus stating its\r\ncharacter. He has done his duty, and dealt fairly with the people, by\r\nthis exhibition of what the views of the executive government are, at\r\nthis interesting moment. It is certainly most proper that the people\r\nshould see distinctly to what end or for what object it is that so much\r\nsuffering is already upon them, and so much more already in visible and\r\nnear prospect.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, is it possible,--is it possible that twelve millions of\r\nintelligent people can be expected voluntarily to subject themselves to\r\nsevere distress, of unknown duration, for the purpose of making trial of\r\nan experiment like this? Will a nation that is intelligent, well\r\ninformed of its own interest, enlightened, and capable of\r\nself-government, submit to suffer embarrassment in all its pursuits,\r\nloss of capital, loss of employment, and a sudden and dead stop in its\r\nonward movement in the path of prosperity and wealth, until it shall be\r\nascertained whether this new-hatched theory shall answer the hopes of\r\nthose who have devised it? Is the country to be persuaded to bear every\r\nthing, and bear patiently, until the operation of such an experiment,\r\nadopted for such an avowed object, and adopted, too, without the\r\nco-operation or consent of Congress, and by the executive power alone,\r\nshall exhibit its results?\r\n\r\nIn the name of the hundreds of thousands of our suffering\r\nfellow-citizens, I ask, for what reasonable end is this experiment to be\r\ntried? What great and good object, worth so much cost, is it to\r\naccomplish? What enormous evil is to be remedied by all this\r\ninconvenience and all this suffering? What great calamity is to be\r\naverted? Have the people thronged our doors, and loaded our tables with\r\npetitions for relief against the pressure of some political mischief,\r\nsome notorious misrule, which this experiment is to redress? Has it been\r\nresorted to in an hour of misfortune, calamity, or peril, to save the\r\nstate? Is it a measure of remedy, yielded to the importunate cries of an\r\nagitated and distressed nation? Far, Sir, very far from all this. There\r\nwas no calamity, there was no suffering, there was no peril, when these\r\nmeasures began. At the moment when this experiment was entered upon,\r\nthese twelve millions of people were prosperous and happy, not only\r\nbeyond the example of all others, but even beyond their own example in\r\ntimes past.\r\n\r\nThere was no pressure of public or private distress throughout the whole\r\nland. All business was prosperous, all industry was rewarded, and\r\ncheerfulness and content universally prevailed. Yet, in the midst of all\r\nthis enjoyment, with so much to heighten and so little to mar it, this\r\nexperiment comes upon us, to harass and oppress us at present, and to\r\naffright us for the future. Sir, it is incredible; the world abroad will\r\nnot believe it; it is difficult even for us to credit, who see it with\r\nour own eyes, that the country, at such a moment, should put itself upon\r\nan experiment fraught with such immediate and overwhelming evils, and\r\nthreatening the property and the employments of the people, and all\r\ntheir social and political blessings, with severe and long-enduring\r\nfuture inflictions.\r\n\r\nAnd this experiment, with all its cost, is to be tried, for what? Why,\r\nsimply, Sir, to enable us to try another \"experiment\"; and that other\r\nexperiment is, to see whether an exclusive specie currency may not be\r\nbetter than a currency partly specie and partly bank paper! The object\r\nwhich it is hoped we may effect, by patiently treading this path of\r\nendurance, is to banish all bank paper, of all kinds, and to have coined\r\nmoney, and coined money only, as the actual currency of the country!\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I altogether deny that such an object is at all desirable,\r\neven if it could be attained. I know, indeed, that all paper ought to\r\ncirculate on a specie basis; that all bank-notes, to be safe, must be\r\nconvertible into gold and silver at the will of the holder; and I admit,\r\ntoo, that the issuing of very small notes by many of the State banks has\r\ntoo much reduced the amount of specie actually circulating. It may be\r\nremembered that I called the attention of Congress to this subject in\r\n1832, and that the bill which then passed both houses for renewing the\r\nbank charter contained a provision designed to produce some restraint on\r\nthe circulation of very small notes. I admit there are conveniences in\r\nmaking small payments in specie; and I have always, not only admitted,\r\nbut contended, that, if all issues of bank-notes under five dollars were\r\ndiscontinued, much more specie would be retained in the country, and in\r\nthe circulation; and that great security would result from this. But we\r\nare now debating about an _exclusive_ specie currency; and I deny that\r\nan exclusive specie currency is the best currency for any highly\r\ncommercial country; and I deny, especially, that such a currency would\r\nbe best suited to the condition and circumstances of the United States.\r\nWith the enlightened writers and practical statesmen of all commercial\r\ncommunities in modern times, I have supposed it to be admitted that a\r\nwell regulated, properly restrained, safely limited paper currency,\r\ncirculating on an adequate specie basis, was a thing to be desired, a\r\npolitical public advantage to be obtained, if it might be obtained; and,\r\nmore especially, I have supposed that in a new country, with resources\r\nnot yet half developed, with a rapidly increasing population and a\r\nconstant demand for more and more capital,--that is to say, in just such\r\na country as the United States are, I have supposed that it was admitted\r\nthat there are particular and extraordinary advantages in a safe and\r\nwell regulated paper currency; because in such a country well regulated\r\nbank paper not only supplies a convenient medium of payments and of\r\nexchange, but also, by the expansion of that medium in a reasonable and\r\nsafe degree, the amount of circulation is kept more nearly commensurate\r\nwith the constantly increasing amount of property; and an extended\r\ncapital, in the shape of credit, comes to the aid of the enterprising\r\nand the industrious. It is precisely on this credit, created by\r\nreasonable expansion of the currency in a new country, that men of small\r\ncapital carry on their business. It is exactly by means of this, that\r\nindustry and enterprise are stimulated. If we were driven back to an\r\nexclusively metallic currency, the necessary and inevitable consequence\r\nwould be, that all trade would fall into the hands of large capitalists.\r\nThis is so plain, that no man of reflection can doubt it. I know not,\r\ntherefore, in what words to express my astonishment, when I hear it said\r\nthat the present measures of government are intended for the good of the\r\nmany instead of the few, for the benefit of the poor, and against the\r\nrich; and when I hear it proposed, at the same moment, to do away with\r\nthe whole system of credit, and place all trade and commerce, therefore,\r\nin the hands of those who have adequate capital to carry them on without\r\nthe use of any credit at all. This, Sir, would be dividing society, by a\r\nprecise, distinct, and well-defined line, into two classes; first, the\r\nsmall class, who have competent capital for trade, when credit is out of\r\nthe question; and, secondly, the vastly numerous class of those whose\r\nliving must become, in such a state of things, a mere manual occupation,\r\nwithout the use of capital or of any substitute for it.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, it is the effect of a well-regulated system of paper credit to\r\nbreak in upon this line thus dividing the many from the few, and to\r\nenable more or less of the more numerous class to pass over it, and to\r\nparticipate in the profits of capital by means of a safe and convenient\r\nsubstitute for capital; and thus to diffuse far more widely the general\r\nearnings, and therefore the general prosperity and happiness, of\r\nsociety. Every man of observation must have witnessed, in this country,\r\nthat men of heavy capital have constantly complained of bank\r\ncirculation, and a consequent credit system, as injurious to the rights\r\nof capital. They undoubtedly feel its effects. All that is gained by the\r\nuse of credit is just so much subtracted from the amount of their own\r\naccumulations, and so much the more has gone to the benefit of those who\r\nbestow their own labor and industry on capital in small amounts. To the\r\ngreat majority, this has been of incalculable benefit in the United\r\nStates; and therefore, Sir, whoever attempts the entire overthrow of the\r\nsystem of bank credit aims a deadly blow at the interest of that great\r\nand industrious class, who, having some capital, cannot, nevertheless,\r\ntransact business without some credit. He can mean nothing else, if he\r\nhave any intelligible meaning at all, than to turn all such persons over\r\nto the long list of mere manual laborers. What else can they do, with\r\nnot enough of absolute capital, and with no credit? This, Sir, this is\r\nthe true tendency and the unavoidable result of these measures, which\r\nhave been undertaken with the patriotic object of assisting the poor\r\nagainst the rich!\r\n\r\nI am well aware that bank credit may be abused. I know that there is\r\nanother extreme, exactly the opposite of that of which I have now been\r\nspeaking, and no less sedulously to be avoided. I know that the issue of\r\nbank paper may become excessive; that depreciation will then follow; and\r\nthat the evils, the losses, and the frauds consequent on a disordered\r\ncurrency fall on the rich and the poor together, but with especial\r\nweight of ruin on the poor. I know that the system of bank credit must\r\nalways rest on a specie basis, and that it constantly needs to be\r\nstrictly guarded and properly restrained; and it may be so guarded and\r\nrestrained. We need not give up the good which belongs to it, through\r\nfear of the evils which may follow from its abuse. We have the power to\r\ntake security against these evils. It is our business, as statesmen, to\r\nadopt that security; it is our business not to prostrate, or attempt to\r\nprostrate, the system, but to use those means of precaution, restraint,\r\nand correction which experience has sanctioned, and which are ready at\r\nour hands.\r\n\r\nIt would be to our everlasting reproach, it would be placing us below\r\nthe general level of the intelligence of civilized states, to admit that\r\nwe cannot contrive means to enjoy the benefits of bank circulation, and\r\nof avoiding, at the same time, its dangers. Indeed, Sir, no contrivance\r\nis necessary. It is _contrivance_, and the love of contrivance, that\r\nspoil all. We are destroying ourselves by a remedy which no evil called\r\nfor. We are ruining perfect health by nostrums and quackery. We have\r\nlived hitherto under a well constructed, practical, and beneficial\r\nsystem; a system not surpassed by any in the world; and it seems to me\r\nto be presuming largely, largely indeed, on the credulity and\r\nself-denial of the people, to rush with such sudden and impetuous haste\r\ninto new schemes and new theories, to overturn and annihilate all that\r\nwe have so long found useful.\r\n\r\nOur system has hitherto been one in which paper has been circulating on\r\nthe strength of a specie basis; that is to say, when every bank-note was\r\nconvertible into specie at the will of the holder. This has been our\r\nguard against excess. While banks are bound to redeem their bills by\r\npaying gold and silver on demand, and are at all times able to do this,\r\nthe currency is safe and convenient. Such a currency is not paper money,\r\nin its odious sense. It is not like the Continental paper of\r\nRevolutionary times; it is not like the worthless bills of banks which\r\nhave suspended specie payments. On the contrary, it is the\r\nrepresentative of gold and silver, and convertible into gold and silver\r\non demand, and therefore answers the purposes of gold and silver; and so\r\nlong as its credit is in this way sustained, it is the cheapest, the\r\nbest, and the most convenient circulating medium. I have already\r\nendeavored to warn the country against irredeemable paper; against the\r\npaper of banks which do not pay specie for their own notes; against that\r\nmiserable, abominable, and fraudulent policy, which attempts to give\r\nvalue to any paper, of any bank, one single moment longer than such\r\npaper is redeemable on demand in gold and silver. I wish most solemnly\r\nand earnestly to repeat that warning. I see danger of that state of\r\nthings ahead. I see imminent danger that a portion of the State banks\r\nwill stop specie payments. The late measure of the Secretary, and the\r\ninfatuation with which it seems to be supported, tend directly and\r\nstrongly to that result. Under pretence, then, of a design to return to\r\na currency which shall be all specie, we are likely to have a currency\r\nin which there shall be no specie at all. We are in danger of being\r\noverwhelmed with irredeemable paper, mere paper, representing not gold\r\nnor silver; no, Sir, representing nothing but broken promises, bad\r\nfaith, bankrupt corporations, cheated creditors, and a ruined people.\r\nThis, I fear, Sir, may be the consequence, already alarmingly near, of\r\nthis attempt, unwise if it be real, and grossly fraudulent if it be only\r\npretended, of establishing an exclusively hard-money currency.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, if this shock could be avoided, and if we could reach the\r\nobject of an exclusive metallic circulation, we should find in that very\r\nsuccess serious and insurmountable inconveniences. We require neither\r\nirredeemable paper, nor yet exclusively hard money. We require a mixed\r\nsystem. We require specie, and we require, too, good bank paper, founded\r\non specie, representing specie, and convertible into specie on demand.\r\nWe require, in short, just such a currency as we have long enjoyed, and\r\nthe advantages of which we seem now, with unaccountable rashness, about\r\nto throw away.\r\n\r\nI avow myself, therefore, decidedly against the object of a return to an\r\nexclusive specie currency. I find great difficulty, I confess, in\r\nbelieving any man serious in avowing such an object. It seems to me\r\nrather a subject for ridicule, at this age of the world, than for sober\r\nargument. But if it be true that any are serious for the return of the\r\ngold and silver age, I am seriously against it.\r\n\r\nLet us, Sir, anticipate, in imagination, the accomplishment of this\r\ngrand experiment. Let us suppose that, at this moment, all bank paper\r\nwere out of existence, and the country full of specie. Where, Sir,\r\nshould we put it, and what should we do with it? Should we ship it, by\r\ncargoes, every day, from New York to New Orleans, and from New Orleans\r\nback to New York? Should we encumber the turnpikes, the railroads, and\r\nthe steamboats with it, whenever purchases and sales were to be made in\r\none place of articles to be transported to another? The carriage of the\r\nmoney would, in some cases, cost half as much as the carriage of the\r\ngoods. Sir, the very first day, under such a state of things, we should\r\nset ourselves about the creation of banks. This would immediately become\r\nnecessary and unavoidable. We may assure ourselves, therefore, without\r\ndanger of mistake, that the idea of an exclusively metallic currency is\r\ntotally incompatible, in the existing state of the world, with an active\r\nand extensive commerce. It is inconsistent, too, with the greatest good\r\nof the greatest number; and therefore I oppose it.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, how are we to get through the first experiment, so as to be\r\nable to try that which is to be final and ultimate, that is to say, how\r\nare we to get rid of the State banks? How is this to be accomplished? Of\r\nthe Bank of the United States, indeed, we may free ourselves readily;\r\nbut how are we to annihilate the State banks? We did not speak them into\r\nbeing; we cannot speak them out of being. They did not originate in any\r\nexercise of our power; nor do they owe their continuance to our\r\nindulgence. They are responsible to the States; to us they are\r\nirresponsible. We cannot act upon them; we can only act with them; and\r\nthe expectation, as it would appear, is, that, by zealously co-operating\r\nwith the government in carrying into operation its new theory, they may\r\ndisprove the necessity of their own existence, and fairly work\r\nthemselves out of the world! Sir, I ask once more, Is a great and\r\nintelligent community to endure patiently all sorts of suffering for\r\nfantasies like these? How charmingly practicable, how delightfully\r\nprobable, all this looks!\r\n\r\nI find it impossible, Mr. President, to believe that the removal of the\r\ndeposits arose in any such purpose as is now avowed. I believe all this\r\nto be an after-thought. The removal was resolved on as a strong measure\r\nagainst the bank; and now that it has been attended with consequences\r\nnot at all apprehended from it, instead of being promptly retracted, as\r\nit should have been, it is to be justified on the ground of a grand\r\nexperiment, above the reach of common sagacity, and dropped down, as it\r\nwere, from the clouds, \"to witch the world with noble policy.\" It is not\r\ncredible, not possible, Sir, that, six months ago, the administration\r\nsuddenly started off to astonish mankind with its new inventions in\r\npolitics, and that it then began its magnificent project by removing the\r\ndeposits as its first operation. No, Sir, no such thing. The removal of\r\nthe deposits was a blow at the bank, and nothing more; and if it had\r\nsucceeded, we should have heard nothing of any project for the final\r\nputting down of all State banks. No, Sir, not one word. We should have\r\nheard, on the contrary, only of their usefulness, their excellence, and\r\ntheir exact adaptation to the uses and necessities of this government.\r\nBut the experiment of making successful use of State banks having\r\nfailed, completely failed, in this the very first endeavor; the State\r\nbanks having already proved themselves not able to fill the place and\r\nperform the duties of a national bank, although highly useful in their\r\nappropriate sphere; and the disastrous consequences of the measures of\r\ngovernment coming thick and fast upon us, the professed object of the\r\nwhole movement is at once changed, and the cry now is, Down with all the\r\nState banks! Down with all the State banks! and let us return to our\r\nembraces of solid gold and solid silver!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL PROTEST.\r\n\r\nA SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, ON THE 7th OF\r\nMAY, 1834, ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PRESIDENT'S PROTEST AGAINST THE\r\nRESOLUTION OF THE SENATE OF THE 28TH OF MARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President,--I feel the magnitude of this question. We are coming to\r\na vote which cannot fail to produce important effects on the character\r\nof the Senate, and the character of the government.\r\n\r\nUnhappily, Sir, the Senate finds itself involved in a controversy with\r\nthe President of the United States; a man who has rendered most\r\ndistinguished services to his country, who has hitherto possessed a\r\ndegree of popular favor perhaps never exceeded, and whose honesty of\r\nmotive and integrity of purpose are still admitted by those who maintain\r\nthat his administration has fallen into lamentable errors.\r\n\r\nOn some of the interesting questions in regard to which the President\r\nand Senate hold opposite opinions, the more popular branch of the\r\nlegislature concurs with the executive. It is not to be concealed that\r\nthe Senate is engaged against imposing odds. It can sustain itself only\r\nby its own prudence and the justice of its cause. It has no patronage by\r\nwhich to secure friends; it can raise up no advocates through the\r\ndispensation of favors, for it has no favors to dispense. Its very\r\nconstitution, as a body whose members are elected for a long term, is\r\ncapable of being rendered obnoxious, and is daily made the subject of\r\nopprobrious remark. It is already denounced as independent of the\r\npeople, and aristocratic. Nor is it, like the other house, powerful in\r\nits numbers; not being, like that, so large as that its members come\r\nconstantly in direct and extensive contact with the whole people. Under\r\nthese disadvantages, Sir, which, we may be assured, will be pressed and\r\nurged to the utmost length, there is but one course for us. The Senate\r\nmust stand on its rendered reasons. It must put forth the grounds of its\r\nproceedings, and it must then rely on the intelligence and patriotism of\r\nthe people to carry it through the contest.\r\n\r\nAs an individual member of the Senate, it gives me great pain to be\r\nengaged in such a conflict with the executive government. The\r\noccurrences of the last session are fresh in the recollection of all of\r\nus; and having felt it to be my duty, at that time, to give my cordial\r\nsupport to highly important measures of the administration, I ardently\r\nhoped that nothing might occur to place me afterwards in an attitude of\r\nopposition. In all respects, and in every way, it would have been far\r\nmore agreeable to me to find nothing in the measures of the executive\r\ngovernment which I could not cheerfully support. The present occasion of\r\ndifference has not been sought or made by me. It is thrust upon me, in\r\nopposition to strong opinions and wishes, on my part not concealed. The\r\ninterference with the public deposits dispelled all hope of continued\r\nconcurrence with the administration, and was a measure so uncalled for,\r\nso unnecessary, and, in my judgment, so illegal and indefensible, that,\r\nwith whatever reluctance it might be opposed by me, opposition was\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\nThe paper before us has grown out of this interference. It is a paper\r\nwhich cannot be treated with indifference. The doctrines which it\r\nadvances, the circumstances which have attended its transmission to the\r\nSenate, and the manner in which the Senate may now dispose of it, will\r\nform a memorable era in the history of the government. We are either to\r\nenter it on our journals, concur in its sentiments, and submit to its\r\nrebuke, or we must answer it, with the respect due to the chief\r\nmagistrate, but with such animadversion on its doctrines as they\r\ndeserve, and with the firmness imposed upon us by our public duties.\r\n\r\nI shall proceed, then, Sir, to consider the circumstances which gave\r\nrise to this Protest; to examine the principles which it attempts to\r\nestablish; and to compare those principles with the Constitution and the\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th day of March, the Senate adopted a resolution declaring\r\nthat, \"in the late executive proceedings in relation to the public\r\nrevenue, the President had assumed a power not conferred by the\r\nConstitution and laws, but in derogation of both.\" In that resolution I\r\nconcurred.\r\n\r\nIt is not a direct question, now again before us, whether the President\r\nreally had assumed such illegal power; that point is decided, so far as\r\nthe Senate ever can decide it. But the Protest denies that, supposing\r\nthe President to have assumed such illegal power, the Senate could\r\nproperly pass the resolution; or, what is the same thing, it denies that\r\nthe Senate could, in this way, express any opinion about it. It denies\r\nthat the Senate has any right, by resolution, in this or any other case,\r\nto express disapprobation of the President's conduct, let that conduct\r\nbe what it may; and this, one of the leading doctrines of the Protest, I\r\npropose to consider. But as I concurred in the resolution of the 28th of\r\nMarch, and did not trouble the Senate, at that time, with any statement\r\nof my own reasons, I will avail myself of this opportunity to explain,\r\nshortly, what those reasons were.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, I have to say, that I did not vote for the\r\nresolution on the mere ground of the removal of Mr. Duane from the\r\noffice of Secretary of the Treasury. Although I disapprove of the\r\nremoval altogether, yet the power of removal does exist in the\r\nPresident, according to the established construction of the\r\nConstitution; and therefore, although in a particular case it may be\r\nabused, and, in my opinion, was abused in this case, yet its exercise\r\ncannot be justly said to be an assumption or usurpation. We must all\r\nagree that Mr. Duane is out of office. He has, therefore, been removed\r\nby a power constitutionally competent to remove him, whatever may be\r\nthought of the exercise of that power under the circumstances of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the act of removing the Secretary be not the assumption of\r\npower which the resolution declares, in what is that assumption found?\r\nBefore giving a precise answer to this inquiry, allow me to recur to\r\nsome of the principal previous events.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the last session of Congress, the public moneys of the\r\nUnited States were still in their proper place. That place was fixed by\r\nthe law of the land, and no power of change was conferred on any other\r\nhuman being than the Secretary of the Treasury. On him the power of\r\nchange was conferred, to be exercised by himself, if emergency should\r\narise, and to be exercised for reasons which he was bound to lay before\r\nCongress. No other officer of the government had the slightest pretence\r\nof authority to lay his hand on these moneys for the purpose of changing\r\nthe place of their custody. All the other heads of departments together\r\ncould not touch them. The President could not touch them. The power of\r\nchange was a trust confided to the discretion of the Secretary, and to\r\nhis discretion alone. The President had no more authority to take upon\r\nhimself this duty, thus assigned expressly by law to the Secretary, than\r\nhe had to make the annual report to Congress, or the annual commercial\r\nstatements, or to perform any other service which the law specially\r\nrequires of the Secretary. He might just as well sign the warrants for\r\nmoneys, in the ordinary daily disbursements of government, instead of\r\nthe Secretary. The statute had assigned the especial duty of removing\r\nthe deposits, if removed at all, to the Secretary of the Treasury, and\r\nto him alone. The consideration of the propriety or necessity of removal\r\nmust be the consideration of the Secretary; the decision to remove, his\r\ndecision; and the act of removal, his act.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, on the 18th day of September last, a resolution was taken to\r\nremove these deposits from their legislative, that is to say, their\r\nlegal custody. _Whose resolution was this?_ On the 1st of October, they\r\nwere removed. _By whose power was this done?_ The papers necessary to\r\naccomplish the removal (that is, the orders and drafts) are, it is true,\r\nsigned by the Secretary. The President's name is not subscribed to them;\r\nnor does the Secretary, in any of them, recite or declare that he does\r\nthe act by direction of the President, or on the President's\r\nresponsibility. In form, the whole proceeding is the proceeding of the\r\nSecretary, and, as such, had the legal effect. The deposits were\r\nremoved. But whose act was it, in truth and reality? Whose will\r\naccomplished it? On whose responsibility was it adopted?\r\n\r\nThese questions are all explicitly answered by the President himself, in\r\nthe paper, under his own hand, read to the Cabinet on the 18th of\r\nSeptember, and published by his authority. In this paper the President\r\ndeclares, in so many words, that he begs his Cabinet to consider the\r\nproposed measure as his own; that its responsibility has been assumed by\r\nhim; and that he names the first day of October as a period proper for\r\nits execution.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, it is precisely this which I deem an assumption of power not\r\nconferred by the Constitution and laws. I think the law did not give\r\nthis authority to the President, nor impose on him the responsibility of\r\nits exercise. It is evident that, in this removal, the Secretary was in\r\nreality nothing but the scribe; he was the pen in the President's hand,\r\nand no more. Nothing depended on his discretion, his judgment, or his\r\nresponsibility. The removal, indeed, has been admitted and defended in\r\nthe Senate, as the direct act of the President himself. This, Sir, is\r\nwhat I call assumption of power. If the President had issued an order\r\nfor the removal of the deposits in his own name, and under his own hand,\r\nit would have been an illegal order, and the bank would not have been at\r\nliberty to obey it. For the same reason, if the Secretary's order had\r\nrecited that it was issued by the President's direction, and on the\r\nPresident's authority, it would have shown on its face that it was\r\nillegal and invalid. No one can doubt that. The act of removal, to be\r\nlawful, must be the _bonâ fide_ act of the Secretary; _his_ judgment,\r\nthe result of _his_ deliberations, the volition of _his_ mind. All are\r\nable to see the difference between the power to remove the Secretary\r\nfrom office, and the power to control him, in all or any of his duties,\r\nwhile in office. The law charges the officer, whoever he may be, with\r\nthe performance of certain duties. The President, with the consent of\r\nthe Senate, appoints an individual to be such officer; and this\r\nindividual he may remove, if he so please; but, until removed, he is the\r\nofficer, and remains charged with the duties of his station, duties\r\nwhich nobody else can perform, and for the neglect or violation of which\r\nhe is liable to be impeached.\r\n\r\nThe distinction is visible and broad between the power of removal and\r\nthe power to control an officer not removed. The President, it is true,\r\nmay terminate his political life; but he cannot control his powers and\r\nfunctions, and act upon him as a mere machine, while he is allowed to\r\nlive. The power of control and direction, nowhere given, certainly, by\r\nany express provision of the Constitution or laws, is derived, by those\r\nwho maintain it, from the right of removal; that is to say, it is a\r\nconstructive power; it has no express warrant in the Constitution. A\r\nvery important power, then, is raised by construction in the first\r\nplace; and being thus raised, it becomes a fountain out of which other\r\nimportant powers, raised also by construction, are to be supplied. There\r\nis no little danger that such a mode of reasoning may be carried too\r\nfar. It cannot be maintained that the power of direct control\r\nnecessarily flows from the power of removal. Suppose it had been decided\r\nin 1789, when the question was debated, that the President does not\r\npossess the power of removal; will it be contended, that, in that case,\r\nhis right of interference with the acts and duties of executive officers\r\nwould be less than it now is? The reason of the thing would seem to be\r\nthe other way. If the President may remove an incumbent when he becomes\r\nsatisfied of his unfaithfulness and incapacity, there would appear to be\r\nless necessity to give him also a right of control, than there would be\r\nif he could not remove him.\r\n\r\nWe may try this question by supposing it to arise in a judicial\r\nproceeding. If the Secretary of the Treasury were impeached for removing\r\nthe deposits, could he justify himself by saying that he did it by the\r\nPresident's direction? If he could, then no executive officer could ever\r\nbe impeached who obeys the President; and the whole notion of making\r\nsuch officers impeachable at all would be farcical. If he could not so\r\njustify himself, (and all will allow he could not,) the reason can only\r\nbe that the act of removal is his own act; the power, a power confided\r\nto him, for the just exercise of which the law looks to his discretion,\r\nhis honesty, and his direct responsibility.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, the President wishes the world to understand that he himself\r\ndecided on the question of the removal of the deposits; that he took the\r\nwhole responsibility of the measure upon himself; that he wished it to\r\nbe considered _his own act_; that he not only himself decided that the\r\nthing should be done, but regulated its details also, and named the day\r\nfor carrying it into effect.\r\n\r\nI have always entertained a very erroneous view of the partition of\r\npowers, and of the true nature of official responsibility under our\r\nConstitution, if this be not a plain case of the assumption of power.\r\n\r\nThe legislature had fixed a place, by law, for the keeping of the public\r\nmoney. They had, at the same time and by the same law, created and\r\nconferred a power of removal, to be exercised contingently. This power\r\nthey had vested in the Secretary, by express words. The law did not say\r\nthat the deposits should be made in the bank, unless the President\r\nshould order otherwise; but it did say that they should be made there,\r\nunless the Secretary of the Treasury should order otherwise. I put it to\r\nthe plain sense and common candor of all men, whether the discretion\r\nthus to be exercised over the subject was not the Secretary's own\r\npersonal discretion; and whether, therefore, the interposition of the\r\nauthority of another, acting directly and conclusively on the subject,\r\ndeciding the whole question, even in its particulars and details, be not\r\nan assumption of power?\r\n\r\nThe Senate regarded this interposition as an encroachment by the\r\nexecutive on other branches of the government; as an interference with\r\nthe legislative disposition of the public treasure. It was strongly and\r\nforcibly urged, yesterday, by the honorable member from South Carolina,\r\nthat the true and only mode of preserving any balance of power, in mixed\r\ngovernments, is to keep an exact balance. This is very true, and to this\r\nend encroachment must be resisted at the first step. The question is,\r\ntherefore, whether, upon the true principles of the Constitution, this\r\nexercise of power by the President can be justified. Whether the\r\nconsequences be prejudicial or not, if there be an illegal exercise of\r\npower, it is to be resisted in the proper manner. Even if no harm or\r\ninconvenience result from transgressing the boundary, the intrusion is\r\nnot to be suffered to pass unnoticed. Every encroachment, great or\r\nsmall, is important enough to awaken the attention of those who are\r\nintrusted with the preservation of a constitutional government. We are\r\nnot to wait till great public mischiefs come, till the government is\r\noverthrown, or liberty itself put into extreme jeopardy. We should not\r\nbe worthy sons of our fathers were we so to regard great questions\r\naffecting the general freedom. Those fathers accomplished the Revolution\r\non a strict question of principle. The Parliament of Great Britain\r\nasserted a right to tax the Colonies in all cases whatsoever; and it was\r\nprecisely on this question that they made the Revolution turn. The\r\namount of taxation was trifling, but the claim itself was inconsistent\r\nwith liberty; and that was, in their eyes, enough. It was against the\r\nrecital of an act of Parliament, rather than against any suffering under\r\nits enactments, that they took up arms. They went to war against a\r\npreamble. They fought seven years against a declaration. They poured out\r\ntheir treasures and their blood like water, in a contest against an\r\nassertion which those less sagacious and not so well schooled in the\r\nprinciples of civil liberty would have regarded as barren phraseology,\r\nor mere parade of words. They saw in the claim of the British Parliament\r\na seminal principle of mischief, the germ of unjust power; they detected\r\nit, dragged it forth from underneath its plausible disguises, struck at\r\nit; nor did it elude either their steady eye or their well-directed blow\r\ntill they had extirpated and destroyed it, to the smallest fibre. On\r\nthis question of principle, while actual suffering was yet afar off,\r\nthey raised their flag against a power, to which, for purposes of\r\nforeign conquest and subjugation, Rome, in the height of her glory, is\r\nnot to be compared; a power which has dotted over the surface of the\r\nwhole globe with her possessions and military posts, whose morning\r\ndrum-beat, following the sun, and keeping company with the hours,\r\ncircles the earth with one continuous and unbroken strain of the martial\r\nairs of England.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of holding strictly to the principle upon which free\r\ngovernments are constructed, and to those precise lines which fix the\r\npartitions of power between different branches, is as plain, if not as\r\ncogent, as that of resisting, as our fathers did, the strides of the\r\nparent country against the rights of the Colonies; because, whether the\r\npower which exceeds its just limits be foreign or domestic, whether it\r\nbe the encroachment of all branches on the rights of the people, or that\r\nof one branch on the rights of others, in either case the balanced and\r\nwell-adjusted machinery of free government is disturbed, and, if the\r\nderangement go on, the whole system must fall.\r\n\r\nBut the case before us is not a case of merely theoretic infringement;\r\nnor is it one of trifling importance. Far otherwise. It respects one of\r\nthe highest and most important of all the powers of government; that is\r\nto say, the custody and control of the public money. The act of removing\r\nthe deposits, which I now consider as the President's act, and which his\r\nfriends on this floor defend as his act, took the national purse from\r\nbeneath the security and guardianship of the law, and disposed of its\r\ncontents, in parcels, in such places of deposit as he chose to select.\r\nAt this very moment, every dollar of the public treasure is subject, so\r\nfar as respects its custody and safe-keeping, to his unlimited control.\r\nWe know not where it is to-day; still less do we know where it may be\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nBut, Mr. President, this is not all. There is another part of the case,\r\nwhich has not been so much discussed, but which appears to me to be\r\nstill more indefensible in its character. It is something which may well\r\nteach us the tendency of power to move forward with accelerated pace, if\r\nit be allowed to take the first step. The Bank of the United States, in\r\naddition to the services rendered to the treasury, gave for its charter,\r\nand for the use of the public deposits, a _bonus_ or outright sum of one\r\nmillion and a half of dollars. This sum was paid by the bank into the\r\ntreasury soon after the commencement of its charter. In the act which\r\npassed both houses for renewing the charter, in 1832, it was provided\r\nthat the bank, for the same consideration, should pay two hundred\r\nthousand dollars a year during the period for which it was proposed to\r\nrenew it. A similar provision is in the bill which I asked leave to\r\nintroduce some weeks ago. Now, Sir, this shows that the custody of the\r\ndeposits is a benefit for which a bank may well afford to pay a large\r\nannual sum. The banks which now hold the deposits pay nothing to the\r\npublic; they give no _bonus_, they pay no annuity. But this loss of so\r\nmuch money is not the worst part of the case, nor that which ought most\r\nto alarm us. Although they pay nothing to the public, they do pay,\r\nnevertheless, such sums, and for such uses, as may be agreed upon\r\nbetween themselves and the executive government. We are officially\r\ninformed that an officer is appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury\r\nto inspect or superintend these selected banks; and this officer is\r\ncompensated by a salary fixed by the executive, agreed to by the banks,\r\nand paid by them. I ask, Sir, if there can be a more irregular or a more\r\nillegal transaction than this? Whose money is it out of which this\r\nsalary is paid? Is it not money justly due to the United States, and\r\npaid, because it is so due, for the advantage of holding the deposits?\r\nIf a dollar is received on that account, is not its only true\r\ndestination into the general treasury of the government? And who has\r\nauthority, without law, to create an office, to fix a salary, and to pay\r\nthat salary out of this money? Here is an inspector or supervisor of the\r\ndeposit banks. But what law has provided for such an officer? What\r\ncommission has he received? Who concurred in his appointment? What oath\r\ndoes he take? How is he to be punished or impeached if he colludes with\r\nany of these banks to embezzle the public money or defraud the\r\ngovernment? The value of the use of this public money to the deposit\r\nbanks is probably two hundred thousand dollars a year; or, if less than\r\nthat, it is yet, certainly, a very great sum. May the President appoint\r\nwhatever officers he pleases, with whatever duties he pleases, and pay\r\nthem as much as he pleases, out of the moneys thus paid by the banks,\r\nfor the sake of having the deposits?\r\n\r\nMr. President, the executive claim of power is exactly this, that the\r\nPresident may keep the money of the public in whatever banks he chooses,\r\non whatever terms he chooses, and apply the sums which these banks are\r\nwilling to pay for its use to whatever purposes he chooses. These sums\r\nare not to come into the general treasury. They are to be appropriated\r\nbefore they get there; they are never to be brought under the control of\r\nCongress; they are to be paid to officers and agents not known to the\r\nlaw, not nominated to the Senate, and responsible to nobody but the\r\nexecutive itself. I ask gentlemen if all this be lawful. Are they\r\nprepared to defend it? Will they stand up and justify it? In my opinion,\r\nSir, it is a clear and most dangerous assumption of power. It is the\r\ncreation of office without law; the appointment to office without\r\nconsulting the Senate; the establishment of a salary without law; and\r\nthe payment of that salary out of a fund which itself is derived from\r\nthe use of the public treasures. This, Sir, is my other reason for\r\nconcurring in the vote of the 28th of March; and on these grounds I\r\nleave the propriety of that vote, so far as I am concerned with it, to\r\nbe judged of by the country.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the President denies the power of the Senate to pass any such\r\nresolution, on any ground whatever. Suppose the declaration contained in\r\nthe resolution to be true; suppose the President had, in fact, assumed\r\npowers not granted to him; does the Senate possess the right to declare\r\nits opinion, affirming this fact, or does it not? I maintain that the\r\nSenate does possess such a power; the President denies it.\r\n\r\nMr. President, we need not look far, nor search deep, for the foundation\r\nof this right in the Senate. It is close at hand, and clearly visible.\r\nIn the first place, it is the right of self-defence. In the second\r\nplace, it is a right founded on the duty of representative bodies, in a\r\nfree government, to defend the public liberty against encroachment. We\r\nmust presume that the Senate honestly entertained the opinion expressed\r\nin the resolution of the 28th of March; and, entertaining that opinion,\r\nits right to express it is but the necessary consequence of its right to\r\ndefend its own constitutional authority, as one branch of the\r\ngovernment. This is its clear right, and this, too, is its imperative\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nIf one or both the other branches of the government happen to do that\r\nwhich appears to us inconsistent with the constitutional rights of the\r\nSenate, will any one say that the Senate is yet bound to be passive, and\r\nto be silent? to do nothing, and to say nothing? Or, if one branch\r\nappears to encroach on the rights of the other two, have these two no\r\npower of remonstrance, complaint, or resistance? Sir, the question may\r\nbe put in a still more striking form. Has the Senate a right _to have an\r\nopinion_ in a case of this kind? If it may have an opinion, how is that\r\nopinion to be ascertained but by resolution and vote? The objection must\r\ngo the whole length; it must maintain that the Senate has not only no\r\nright to express opinions, but no right to form opinions, on the conduct\r\nof the executive government, though in matters intimately affecting the\r\npowers and duties of the Senate itself. It is not possible, Sir, that\r\nsuch a doctrine can be maintained for a single moment. All political\r\nbodies resist what they deem encroachments by resolutions expressive of\r\ntheir sentiments, and their purpose to resist such encroachments. When\r\nsuch a resolution is presented for its consideration, the question is,\r\nwhether it be true; not whether the body has authority to pass it,\r\nadmitting it to be true. The Senate, like other public bodies, is\r\nperfectly justifiable in defending, in this mode, either its legislative\r\nor executive authority. The usages of Parliament, the practice in our\r\nState legislatures and assemblies, both before and since the Revolution,\r\nand precedents in the Senate itself, fully maintain this right. The case\r\nof the Panama mission is in point. In that case, Mr. Branch, from North\r\nCarolina, introduced a resolution, which, after reciting that the\r\nPresident, in his annual message and in his communication to the Senate,\r\nhad asserted that he possessed an authority to make certain\r\nappointments, _although the appointments had not been made_, went on to\r\ndeclare that \"_a silent acquiescence on the part of this body may, at\r\nsome future time, be drawn into dangerous precedent_\"; and to resolve,\r\ntherefore, that the President does not possess the right or power said\r\nto be claimed by him. This resolution was discussed, and finally laid on\r\nthe table. But the question discussed was, whether the resolution was\r\ncorrect, in fact and principle; not whether the Senate had any right to\r\npass such resolution. So far as I remember, no one pretended that, if\r\nthe President had exceeded his authority, the Senate might not so\r\ndeclare by resolution. No one ventured to contend that, whether the\r\nrights of the Senate were invaded or not, the Senate must hold its\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThe Protest labors strenuously to show that the Senate adopted the\r\nresolution of the 28th of March, under its _judicial_ authority. The\r\nreason of this attempt is obvious enough. If the Senate, in its judicial\r\ncharacter, has been trying the President, then he has not had a regular\r\nand formal trial; and, on that ground, it is hoped the public sympathy\r\nmay be moved. But the Senate has acted not in its judicial, but in its\r\nlegislative capacity. As a legislative body, it has defended its own\r\njust authority, and the authority of the other branch of the\r\nlegislature. Whatever attacks our own rights and privileges, or whatever\r\nencroaches on the power of both houses, we may oppose and resist, by\r\ndeclaration, resolution, or other similar proceedings. If we look to the\r\nbooks of precedents, if we examine the journals of legislative bodies,\r\nwe find everywhere instances of such proceedings.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, Sir, that the Protest imposes silence on the House\r\nof Representatives as well as on the Senate. It declares that no power\r\nis conferred on either branch of the legislature, to consider or decide\r\nupon official acts of the executive, for the purpose of censure, and\r\nwithout a view to legislation or impeachment. This, I think, Sir, is\r\npretty high-toned pretension. According to this doctrine, neither house\r\ncould assert its own rights, however the executive might assail them;\r\nneither house could point out the danger to the people, however fast\r\nexecutive encroachment might be extending itself, or whatever danger it\r\nmight threaten to the public liberties. If the two houses of Congress\r\nmay not express an opinion of executive conduct by resolution, there is\r\nthe same reason why they should not express it in any other form, or by\r\nany other mode of proceeding. Indeed, the Protest limits both houses,\r\nexpressly, to the case of impeachment. If the House of Representatives\r\nare not about to impeach the President, they have nothing to say of his\r\nmeasures or of his conduct; and unless the Senate are engaged in trying\r\nan impeachment, their mouths, too, are stopped. It is the practice of\r\nthe President to send us an annual message, in which he rehearses the\r\ngeneral proceedings of the executive for the past year. This message we\r\nrefer to our committees for consideration. But, according to the\r\ndoctrine of the Protest, they can express no opinion upon any executive\r\nproceeding upon which it gives information. Suppose the President had\r\ntold us, in his last annual message, what he had previously told us in\r\nhis cabinet paper, that the removal of the deposits was _his_ act, done\r\non _his_ responsibility; and that the Secretary of the Treasury had\r\nexercised no discretion, formed no judgment, presumed to have no opinion\r\nwhatever, on the subject. This part of the message would have been\r\nreferred to the committee on finance; but what could they say? They\r\nthink it shows a plain violation of the Constitution and the laws; but\r\nthe President is not impeached; therefore they can express no censure.\r\nThey think it a direct invasion of legislative power, but they must not\r\nsay so. They may, indeed, commend, if they can. The grateful business of\r\npraise is lawful to them; but if, instead of commendation and applause,\r\nthey find cause for disapprobation, censure, or alarm, the Protest\r\nenjoins upon them absolute silence.\r\n\r\nFormerly, Sir, it was a practice for the President to meet both houses,\r\nat the opening of the session, and deliver a speech, as is still the\r\nusage of some of the State legislatures. To this speech there was an\r\nanswer from each house$ and those answers expressed, freely, the\r\nsentiments of the house upon all the merits and faults of the\r\nadministration. The discussion of the topics contained in the speech,\r\nand the debate on the answers, usually drew out the whole force of\r\nparties, and lasted sometimes a week. President Washington's conduct, in\r\nevery year of his administration, was thus freely and publicly\r\ncanvassed. He did not complain of it; he did not doubt that both houses\r\nhad a perfect right to comment, with the utmost latitude, consistent\r\nwith decorum, upon all his measures. Answers, or amendments to answers,\r\nwere not unfrequently proposed, very hostile to his own course of public\r\npolicy, if not sometimes bordering on disrespect. And when they did\r\nexpress respect and regard, there were votes ready to be recorded\r\nagainst the expression of those sentiments. To all this President\r\nWashington took no exception; for he well knew that these, and similar\r\nproceedings, belonged to the power of popular bodies. But if the\r\nPresident were now to meet us with a speech, and should inform us of\r\nmeasures, adopted by himself in the recess, which should appear to us\r\nthe most plain, palpable, and dangerous violations of the Constitution,\r\nwe must, nevertheless, either keep respectful silence, or fill our\r\nanswer merely with courtly phrases of approbation.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I know not who wrote this Protest, but I confess I am\r\nastonished, truly astonished, as well at the want of knowledge which it\r\ndisplays of constitutional law, as at the high and dangerous pretensions\r\nwhich it puts forth. Neither branch of the legislature can express\r\ncensure upon the President's conduct! Suppose, Sir, that we should see\r\nhim enlisting troops and raising an army, can we say nothing, and do\r\nnothing? Suppose he were to declare war against a foreign power, and put\r\nthe army and the fleet in action; are we still to be silent? Suppose we\r\nshould see him borrowing money on the credit of the United States; are\r\nwe yet to wait for impeachment? Indeed, Sir, in regard to this borrowing\r\nmoney on the credit of the United States, I wish to call the attention\r\nof the Senate, not only to what might happen, but to what has actually\r\nhappened. We are informed that the Post-Office Department, a department\r\nover which the President claims the same control as over the rest, _has\r\nactually borrowed near half a million of money on the credit of the\r\nUnited States_.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the first power granted to Congress by the Constitution\r\nis the power to lay taxes; the second, the power to borrow money on the\r\ncredit of the United States. Now, Sir, where does the executive find its\r\nauthority, in or through any department, to borrow money without\r\nauthority of Congress? This proceeding appears to me wholly illegal, and\r\nreprehensible in a very high degree. It may be said that it is not true\r\nthat this money is borrowed on the credit of the United States, but that\r\nit is borrowed on the credit of the Post-Office Department. But that\r\nwould be mere evasion. The department is but a name. It is an office,\r\nand nothing more. The banks have not lent this money to any officer. If\r\nCongress should abolish the whole department to-morrow, would the banks\r\nnot expect the United States to replace this borrowed money? The money,\r\nthen, is borrowed on the credit of the United States, an act which\r\nCongress alone is competent to authorize. If the Post-Office Department\r\nmay borrow money, so may the War Department and the Navy Department. If\r\nhalf a million may be borrowed, ten millions may be borrowed. What,\r\nthen, if this transaction shall be justified, is to hinder the executive\r\nfrom borrowing money to maintain fleets and armies, or for any other\r\npurpose, at his pleasure, without any authority of law? Yet even this,\r\naccording to the doctrine of the Protest, we have no right to complain\r\nof. We have no right to declare that an executive department has\r\nviolated the Constitution and broken the law, by borrowing money on the\r\ncredit of the United States. Nor could we make a similar declaration, if\r\nwe were to see the executive, by means of this borrowed money, enlisting\r\narmies and equipping fleets. And yet, Sir, the President has found no\r\ndifficulty, heretofore, in expressing his opinions, _in a paper not\r\ncalled for by the exercise of any official duty_, upon the conduct and\r\nproceedings of the two houses of Congress. At the commencement of this\r\nsession, he sent us a message, commenting on the land bill which the two\r\nhouses passed at the end of the last session. That bill he had not\r\napproved, nor had he returned it with objections. Congress was\r\ndissolved; and the bill, therefore, was completely dead, and could not\r\nbe revived. No communication from him could have the least possible\r\neffect as an official act. Yet he saw fit to send a message on the\r\nsubject, and in that message he very freely declares his opinion that\r\nthe bill which had passed both houses _began with an entire subversion\r\nof every one of the compacts by which the United States became possessed\r\nof their Western domain_; that one of its provisions _was in direct and\r\nundisguised violation of the pledge given by Congress to the States_;\r\nthat the Constitution provides that these compacts shall be untouched by\r\nthe legislative power, which can only make needful rules and\r\nregulations; and that all beyond that is _an assumption of undelegated\r\npower_.\r\n\r\nThese are the terms in which the President speaks of an act of the two\r\nhouses; not in an official paper, not in a communication which it was\r\nnecessary for him to make to them; but in a message, adopted only as a\r\nmode through which to make public these opinions. After this, it would\r\nseem too late to enjoin on the houses of Congress a total forbearance\r\nfrom all comment on the measures of the executive.\r\n\r\nNot only is it the right of both houses, or of either, to resist, by\r\nvote, declaration, or resolution, whatever it may deem an encroachment\r\nof executive power, but it is also undoubtedly the right of either house\r\nto oppose, in like manner, any encroachment by the other. The two houses\r\nhave each its own appropriate powers and authorities, which it is bound\r\nto preserve. They have, too, different constituents. The members of the\r\nSenate are representatives of States; and it is in the Senate alone that\r\nthe four-and-twenty States, as political bodies, have a direct influence\r\nin the legislative and executive powers of this government. He is a\r\nstrange advocate of State rights, who maintains that this body, thus\r\nrepresenting the States, and thus being the strictly federal branch of\r\nthe legislature, may not assert and maintain all and singular its own\r\npowers and privileges, against either or both of the other branches.\r\n\r\nIf any thing be done or threatened derogatory to the rights of the\r\nStates, as secured by the organization of the Senate, may we not lift up\r\nour voices against it? Suppose the House of Representatives should vote\r\nthat the Senate ought not to propose amendments to revenue bills; would\r\nit be the duty of the Senate to take no notice of such proceeding? Or,\r\nif we were to see the President issuing commissions to office to persons\r\nwho had never been nominated to the Senate, are we not to remonstrate?\r\n\r\nSir, there is no end of cases, no end of illustrations. The doctrines of\r\nthe Protest, in this respect, cannot stand the slightest scrutiny; they\r\nare blown away by the first breath of discussion.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, Sir, it is easy to perceive why this right of declaring its\r\nsentiments respecting the conduct of the executive is denied to either\r\nhouse, in its legislative capacity. It is merely that the Senate might\r\nbe presented in the odious light of _trying_ the President, judicially,\r\nwithout regular accusation or hearing. The Protest declares that the\r\nPresident is _charged with a crime, and, without hearing or trial, found\r\nguilty and condemned_. This is evidently an attempt to appeal to popular\r\nfeeling, and to represent the President as unjustly treated and unfairly\r\ntried. Sir, it is a false appeal. The President has not been tried at\r\nall; he has not been accused; he has not been charged with crime; he has\r\nnot been condemned. Accusation, trial, and sentence are terms belonging\r\nto judicial proceedings. But the Senate has been engaged in no such\r\nproceeding. The resolution of the 28th of March was not an exercise of\r\njudicial power, either in form, in substance, or in intent. Everybody\r\nknows that the Senate can exercise no judicial power until articles of\r\nimpeachment are brought before it. It is then to proceed, by accusation\r\nand answer, hearing, trial, and judgment. But there has been no\r\nimpeachment, no answer, no hearing, no judgment. All that the Senate did\r\nwas to pass a resolution, in legislative form, declaring its opinion of\r\ncertain acts of the executive. This resolution imputed no crime; it\r\ncharged no corrupt motive; it proposed no punishment. It was directed,\r\nnot against the President personally, but against the act; and that act\r\nit declared to be, in its judgment, an assumption of authority not\r\nwarranted by the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIt is in vain that the Protest attempts to shift the resolution to the\r\njudicial character of the Senate. The case is too plain for such an\r\nargument to be plausible. But, in order to lay some foundation for it,\r\nthe Protest, as I have already said, contends that neither the Senate\r\nnor the House of Representatives can express its opinions on the conduct\r\nof the President, except in some form connected with impeachment; so\r\nthat if the power of impeachment did not exist, these two houses, though\r\nthey be representative bodies, though one of them be filled by the\r\nimmediate representatives of the people, though they be constituted like\r\nother popular and representative bodies, could not utter a syllable,\r\nalthough they saw the executive either trampling on their own rights and\r\nprivileges, or grasping at absolute authority and dominion over the\r\nliberties of the country! Sir, I hardly know how to speak of such claims\r\nof impunity for executive encroachment. I am amazed that any American\r\ncitizen should draw up a paper containing such lofty pretensions;\r\npretensions which would have been met with scorn in England, at any time\r\nsince the Revolution of 1688. A man who should stand up, in either house\r\nof the British Parliament, to maintain that the house could not, by vote\r\nor resolution, maintain its own rights and privileges, would make even\r\nthe Tory benches hang their heads for very shame.\r\n\r\nThere was, indeed, a time when such proceedings were not allowed. Some\r\nof the kings of the Stuart race would not tolerate them. A signal\r\ninstance of royal displeasure with the proceedings of Parliament\r\noccurred in the latter part of the reign of James the First. The House\r\nof Commons had spoken, on some occasion, \"of its own undoubted rights\r\nand privileges.\" The king thereupon sent them a letter, declaring that\r\n_he would not allow that they had any undoubted rights; but that what\r\nthey enjoyed they might still hold by his own royal grace and\r\npermission_. Sir Edward Coke and Mr. Granville were not satisfied with\r\nthis title to their privileges; and, under their lead, the house entered\r\non its journals a resolution asserting its privileges, _as its own\r\nundoubted right_, and manifesting a determination to maintain them as\r\nsuch. This, says the historian, so enraged his Majesty, that he sent for\r\nthe journal, had it brought into the Council, and there, in the presence\r\nof his lords and great officers of state, tore out the offensive\r\nresolution with his own royal hand. He then dissolved Parliament, and\r\nsent its most refractory members to the Tower. I have no fear,\r\ncertainly, Sir, that this English example will be followed, on this\r\noccasion, to its full extent; nor would I insinuate that any thing\r\noutrageous has been thought of, or intended, except outrageous\r\npretensions; but such pretensions I must impute to the author of this\r\nProtest, whoever that author may be.\r\n\r\nWhen this and the other house shall lose the freedom of speech and\r\ndebate; when they shall surrender the rights of publicly and freely\r\ncanvassing all important measures of the executive; when they shall not\r\nbe allowed to maintain their own authority and their own privileges by\r\nvote, declaration, or resolution,--they will then be no longer free\r\nrepresentatives of a free people, but slaves themselves, and fit\r\ninstruments to make slaves of others.\r\n\r\nThe Protest, Mr. President, concedes what it doubtless regards as a\r\nliberal right of discussion to the people themselves. But its language,\r\neven in acknowledging this right of the _people_ to discuss the conduct\r\nof their servants, is qualified and peculiar. The free people of the\r\nUnited States, it declares, have an undoubted right to discuss the\r\nofficial conduct of the President in such language and form as they may\r\nthink proper, \"subject only to the restraints of truth and justice.\"\r\nBut, then, who is to be judge of this truth and justice? Are the people\r\nto judge for themselves, or are others to judge for them? The Protest is\r\nhere speaking of _political_ rights, and not moral rights; and if\r\nrestraints are imposed on _political_ rights, it must follow, of course,\r\nthat others are to decide whenever the case arises whether these\r\nrestraints have been violated. It is strange that the writer of the\r\nProtest did not perceive that, by using this language, he was pushing\r\nthe President into a direct avowal of the doctrines of 1798. The text of\r\nthe Protest and the text of the obnoxious act[1] of that year are nearly\r\nidentical.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, if the people have a right to discuss the official conduct of\r\nthe executive, so have their representatives. We have been taught to\r\nregard a representative of the people as a sentinel on the watch-tower\r\nof liberty. Is he to be blind, though visible danger approaches? Is he\r\nto be deaf, though sounds of peril fill the air? Is he to be dumb, while\r\na thousand duties impel him to raise the cry of alarm? Is he not,\r\nrather, to catch the lowest whisper which breathes intention or purpose\r\nof encroachment on the public liberties, and to give his voice breath\r\nand utterance at the first appearance of danger? Is not his eye to\r\ntraverse the whole horizon with the keen and eager vision of an\r\nunhooded hawk, detecting, through all disguises, every enemy advancing,\r\nin any form, towards the citadel which he guards? Sir, this watchfulness\r\nfor public liberty; this duty of foreseeing danger and proclaiming it;\r\nthis promptitude and boldness in resisting attacks on the Constitution\r\nfrom any quarter; this defence of established landmarks; this fearless\r\nresistance of whatever would transcend or remove them,--all belong to\r\nthe representative character, are interwoven with its very nature. If\r\ndeprived of them, an active, intelligent, faithful agent of the people\r\nwill be converted into an unresisting and passive instrument of power. A\r\nrepresentative body, which gives up these rights and duties, gives\r\nitself up. It is a representative body no longer. It has broken the tie\r\nbetween itself and its constituents, and henceforth is fit only to be\r\nregarded as an inert, self-sacrificed mass, from which all appropriate\r\nprinciple of vitality has departed for ever.\r\n\r\nI have thus endeavored to vindicate the right of the Senate to pass the\r\nresolution of the 28th of March, notwithstanding the denial of that\r\nright in the Protest.\r\n\r\nBut there are other sentiments and opinions expressed in the Protest, of\r\nthe very highest importance, and which demand nothing less than our\r\nutmost attention.\r\n\r\nThe first object of a free people is the preservation of their liberty;\r\nand liberty is only to be preserved by maintaining constitutional\r\nrestraints and just divisions of political power. Nothing is more\r\ndeceptive or more dangerous than the pretence of a desire to simplify\r\ngovernment. The simplest governments are despotisms; the next simplest,\r\nlimited monarchies; but all republics, all governments of law, must\r\nimpose numerous limitations and qualifications of authority, and give\r\nmany positive and many qualified rights. In other words, they must be\r\nsubject to rule and regulation. This is the very essence of free\r\npolitical institutions. The spirit of liberty is, indeed, a bold and\r\nfearless spirit; but it is also a sharp-sighted spirit, it is a\r\ncautious, sagacious, discriminating, far-seeing intelligence; it is\r\njealous of encroachment, jealous of power, jealous of man. It demands\r\nchecks; it seeks for guards; it insists on securities; it intrenches\r\nitself behind strong defences, and fortifies itself with all possible\r\ncare against the assaults of ambition and passion. It does not trust the\r\namiable weaknesses of human nature, and therefore it will not permit\r\npower to overstep its prescribed limits, though benevolence, good\r\nintent, and patriotic purpose come along with it. Neither does it\r\nsatisfy itself with flashy and temporary resistance to illegal\r\nauthority. Far otherwise. It seeks for duration and permanence. It looks\r\nbefore and after; and, building on the experience of ages which are\r\npast, it labors diligently for the benefit of ages to come. This is the\r\nnature of constitutional liberty; and this is _our_ liberty, if we will\r\nrightly understand and preserve it. Every free government is necessarily\r\ncomplicated, because all such governments establish restraints, as well\r\non the power of government itself as on that of individuals. If we will\r\nabolish the distinction of branches, and have but one branch; if we will\r\nabolish jury trials, and leave all to the judge; if we will then ordain\r\nthat the legislator shall himself be that judge; and if we will place\r\nthe executive power in the same hands, we may readily simplify\r\ngovernment. We may easily bring it to the simplest of all possible\r\nforms, a pure despotism. But a separation of departments, so far as\r\npracticable, and the preservation of clear lines of division between\r\nthem, is the fundamental idea in the creation of all our constitutions;\r\nand, doubtless, the continuance of regulated liberty depends on\r\nmaintaining these boundaries.\r\n\r\nIn the progress, Sir, of the governments of the United States, we seem\r\nexposed to two classes of dangers or disturbances; one external, the\r\nother internal. It may happen that collisions arise between this\r\ngovernment and the governments of the States. That case belongs to the\r\nfirst class. A memorable instance of this kind occurred last year. It\r\nwas my conscientious opinion, on that occasion, that the authority\r\nclaimed by an individual State[2] was subversive of the just powers of\r\nthis government, and, indeed, incompatible with its existence. I gave a\r\nhearty co-operation, therefore, to measures which the crisis seemed to\r\nrequire. We have now before us what appears, to my judgment, to be an\r\ninstance of the latter kind. A contest has arisen between different\r\nbranches of the same government, interrupting their harmony, and\r\nthreatening to disturb their balance. It is of the highest importance,\r\ntherefore, to examine the question carefully, and to decide it justly.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the powers of government into three departments,\r\nthough all our constitutions profess to be founded on it, has,\r\nnevertheless, never been perfectly established in any government of the\r\nworld, and perhaps never can be. The general principle is of inestimable\r\nvalue, and the leading lines of distinction sufficiently plain; yet\r\nthere are powers of so undecided a character, that they do not seem\r\nnecessarily to range themselves under either head. And most of our\r\nconstitutions, too, having laid down the general principle, immediately\r\ncreate exceptions. There do not exist, in the general science of\r\ngovernment, or the received maxims of political law, such precise\r\ndefinitions as enable us always to say of a given power whether it be\r\nlegislative, executive, or judicial. And this is one reason, doubtless,\r\nwhy the Constitution, in conferring power on all the departments,\r\nproceeds not by general definition, but by specific enumeration. And,\r\nagain, it grants a power in general terms, but yet, in the same or some\r\nother article or section, imposes a limitation or qualification on the\r\ngrant; and the grant and the limitation must, of course, be construed\r\ntogether. Thus the Constitution says that all legislative power, therein\r\ngranted, shall be vested in Congress, which Congress shall consist of a\r\nSenate and a House of Representatives; and yet, in another article, it\r\ngives to the President a qualified negative over all acts of Congress.\r\nSo the Constitution declares that the judicial power shall be vested in\r\none Supreme Court, and such inferior courts as Congress may establish.\r\nIt gives, nevertheless, in another provision, judicial power to the\r\nSenate; and, in like manner, though it declares that the executive power\r\nshall be vested in the President, using, in the immediate context, no\r\nwords of limitation, yet it elsewhere subjects the treaty-making power,\r\nand the appointing power, to the concurrence of the Senate. The\r\nirresistible inference from these considerations is, that the mere\r\nnomination of a department, as one of the three great and commonly\r\nacknowledged departments of government, does not confer on that\r\ndepartment any power at all. Notwithstanding the departments are called\r\nthe legislative, the executive, and the judicial, we must yet look into\r\nthe provisions of the Constitution itself, in order to learn, first,\r\nwhat powers the Constitution regards as legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial; and, in the next place, what portions or quantities of these\r\npowers are conferred on the respective departments; because no one will\r\ncontend that _all_ legislative power belongs to Congress, _all_\r\nexecutive power to the President, or _all_ judicial power to the courts\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first three articles of the Constitution, as all know, are taken up\r\nin prescribing the organization, and enumerating the powers, of the\r\nthree departments. The first article treats of the legislature, and its\r\nfirst section is, \"All legislative power, _herein granted_, shall be\r\nvested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a\r\nSenate and House of Representatives.\" The second article treats of the\r\nexecutive power, and its first section declares that \"the executive\r\npower shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\"\r\nThe third article treats of the judicial power, and its first section\r\ndeclares that \"the judicial power of the United States shall be vested\r\nin one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may,\r\nfrom time to time, ordain and establish.\"\r\n\r\nIt is too plain to be doubted, I think, Sir, that these descriptions of\r\nthe persons or officers in whom the executive and the judicial powers\r\nare to be vested no more define the extent of the grant of those powers,\r\nthan the words quoted from the first article describe the extent of the\r\nlegislative grant to Congress. All these several titles, heads of\r\narticles, or introductory clauses, with the general declarations which\r\nthey contain, serve to designate the departments, and to mark the\r\ngeneral distribution of powers; but in all the departments, in the\r\nexecutive and judicial as well as in the legislative, it would be unsafe\r\nto contend for any specific power under such clauses.\r\n\r\nIf we look into the State constitutions, we shall find the line of\r\ndistinction between the departments still less perfectly drawn, although\r\nthe general principle of the distinction is laid down in most of them,\r\nand in some of them in very positive and emphatic terms. In some of\r\nthese States, notwithstanding the principle of distribution is adopted\r\nand sanctioned, the legislature appoints the judges; and in others it\r\nappoints both the governor and the judges; and in others, again, it\r\nappoints not only the judges, but all other officers.\r\n\r\nThe inferences which, I think, follow from these views of the subject,\r\nare two: first, that the denomination of a department does not fix the\r\nlimits of the powers conferred on it, nor even their exact nature; and,\r\nsecond (which, indeed, follows from the first), that in our American\r\ngovernments, the chief executive magistrate does not necessarily, and by\r\nforce of his general character of supreme executive, possess the\r\nappointing power. He may have it, or he may not, according to the\r\nparticular provisions applicable to each case in the respective\r\nconstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe President appears to have taken a different view of this subject. He\r\nseems to regard the appointing power as originally and inherently in the\r\nexecutive, and as remaining absolute in his hands, except so far as the\r\nConstitution restrains it. This I do not agree to, and I shall have\r\noccasion hereafter to examine the question further. I have intended thus\r\nfar only to insist on the high and indispensable duty of maintaining the\r\ndivision of power _as the Constitution has marked out that division_,\r\nand to oppose claims of authority not founded on express grants or\r\nnecessary implication, but sustained merely by argument or inference\r\nfrom names or denominations given to departments.\r\n\r\nMr. President, the resolutions now before us declare, that the Protest\r\nasserts powers as belonging to the President inconsistent with the\r\nauthority of the two houses of Congress, and inconsistent with the\r\nConstitution; and that the Protest itself is a breach of privilege. I\r\nbelieve all this to be true.\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of the Protest are inconsistent with the authority of the\r\ntwo houses, because, in my judgment, they deny the just extent of the\r\nlaw-making power. I take the Protest as it was sent to us, without\r\ninquiring how far the subsequent message has modified or explained it.\r\nIt is singular, indeed, that a paper, so long in preparation, so\r\nelaborate in composition, and which is put forth for so high a purpose\r\nas the Protest avows, should not be able to stand an hour's discussion\r\nbefore it became evident that it was indispensably necessary to alter or\r\nexplain its contents. Explained or unexplained, however, the paper\r\ncontains sentiments which justify us, as I think, in adopting these\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I think the Protest a clear breach of privilege. It\r\nis a reproof or rebuke of the Senate, in language hardly respectful, for\r\nthe exercise of a power clearly belonging to it as a legislative body.\r\nIt entirely misrepresents the proceedings of the Senate. I find this\r\nparagraph in it, among others of a similar tone and character: \"A\r\nmajority of the Senate, whose interference with the preliminary question\r\nhas, for the best of all reasons, been studiously excluded, anticipate\r\nthe action of the House of Representatives, assume not only the\r\nfunction which belongs exclusively to that body, but convert themselves\r\ninto accusers, witnesses, counsel, and judges, and prejudge the whole\r\ncase; thus presenting the appalling spectacle, in a free state, of\r\njudges going through a labored preparation for an impartial hearing and\r\ndecision, by a previous _ex parte_ investigation and sentence against\r\nthe supposed offender.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, this paragraph, I am bound to say, is a total\r\nmisrepresentation of the proceedings of the Senate. A majority of the\r\nSenate have not anticipated the House of Representatives; they have not\r\nassumed the functions of that body; they have not converted themselves\r\ninto accusers, witnesses, counsel, or judges; they have made no _ex\r\nparte_ investigation; they have given no sentence. This paragraph is an\r\nelaborate perversion of the whole design and the whole proceedings of\r\nthe Senate. A Protest, sent to us by the President, against votes which\r\nthe Senate has an unquestionable right to pass, and containing, too,\r\nsuch a misrepresentation of these votes as this paragraph manifests, is\r\na breach of privilege.\r\n\r\nBut there is another breach of privilege. The President interferes\r\nbetween the members of the Senate and their constituents, and charges\r\nthem with acting contrary to the will of those constituents. He says it\r\nis his right and duty to look to the journals of the Senate to ascertain\r\nwho voted for the resolution of the 28th of March, and then to show that\r\nindividual Senators have, by their votes on that resolution, disobeyed\r\nthe instructions or violated the known will of the legislatures who\r\nappointed them. All this he claims as his right and his duty. And where\r\ndoes he find any such right or any such duty? What right has he to send\r\na message to either house of Congress telling its members that they\r\ndisobey the will of their constituents? Has any English sovereign since\r\nCromwell's time dared to send such a message to Parliament? Sir, if he\r\ncan tell us that some of us disobey our constituents, he can tell us\r\nthat all do so; and if we consent to receive this language from him,\r\nthere is but one remaining step, and that is, that since we thus disobey\r\nthe will of our constituents, he should disperse us and send us home. In\r\nmy opinion, the first step in this process is as distinct a breach of\r\nprivilege as the last. If Cromwell's example shall be followed out, it\r\nwill not be more clear then than it is now that the privileges of the\r\nSenate have been violated. There is yet something, Sir, which surpasses\r\nall this; and that is, that, after this direct interference, after\r\npointing out those Senators whom he would represent as having disobeyed\r\nthe known will of their constituents, _he disclaims all design of\r\ninterfering at all_! Sir, who could be the writer of a message, which,\r\nin the first place, makes the President assert such monstrous\r\npretensions, and, in the next line, affront the understanding of the\r\nSenate by disavowing all right to do that very thing which he is doing?\r\nIf there be any thing, Sir, in this message, more likely than the rest\r\nof it to move one from his equanimity, it is this disclaimer of all\r\ndesign to interfere with the responsibility of members of the Senate to\r\ntheir constituents, after such interference had already been made, in\r\nthe same paper, in the most objectionable and offensive form. If it were\r\nnot for the purpose of telling these Senators that they disobeyed the\r\nwill of the legislatures of the States they represent, _for what purpose\r\nwas it_ that the Protest has pointed out the four Senators, and paraded\r\nagainst them the sentiments of their legislatures? There can be no other\r\npurpose. The Protest says, indeed, that \"these facts belong to the\r\nhistory of these proceedings\"! To the history of what proceedings? To\r\nany proceeding to which the President was party? To any proceeding to\r\nwhich the Senate was party? Have they any thing to do with the\r\nresolution of the 28th of March? But it adds, that these facts _are\r\nimportant to the just development of the principles and interests\r\ninvolved in the proceedings_. All this might be said of any other facts.\r\nIt is mere words. To what principles, to what interests, are these facts\r\nimportant? They can be important but in one point of view; and that is\r\nas proof, or evidence, that the Senators have disobeyed instructions, or\r\nacted against the known will of their constituents in disapproving the\r\nPresident's conduct. They have not the slightest bearing in any other\r\nway. They do not make the resolution of the Senate more or less true,\r\nnor its right to pass it more or less clear. Sir, these proceedings of\r\nthe legislatures were introduced into this Protest for the very purpose,\r\nand no other, of showing that members of the Senate have acted contrary\r\nto the will of their constituents. Every man sees and knows this to have\r\nbeen the sole design; and any other pretence is a mockery to our\r\nunderstandings. And this purpose is, in my opinion, an unlawful purpose;\r\nit is an unjustifiable intervention between us and our constituents; and\r\nis, therefore, a manifest and flagrant breach of privilege.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the assertions of the Protest are inconsistent with\r\nthe just authority of Congress, because they claim for the President a\r\npower, independent of Congress, to possess the custody and control of\r\nthe public treasures. Let this point be accurately examined; and, in\r\norder to avoid mistake, I will read the precise words of the Protest.\r\n\r\n     \"The custody of the public property, under such regulations as may\r\n     be prescribed by legislative authority, has always been considered\r\n     an appropriate function of the executive department in this and all\r\n     other governments. In accordance with this principle, every species\r\n     of property belonging to the United States, (excepting that which\r\n     is in the use of the several co-ordinate departments of the\r\n     government, as means to aid them in performing their appropriate\r\n     functions,) is in charge of officers appointed by the President,\r\n     whether it be lands, or buildings, or merchandise, or provisions,\r\n     or clothing, or arms and munitions of war. The superintendents and\r\n     keepers of the whole are appointed by the President, and removable\r\n     at his will.\r\n\r\n     \"Public money is but a species of public property. It cannot be\r\n     raised by taxation or customs, nor brought into the treasury in any\r\n     other way except by law; but whenever or howsoever obtained, its\r\n     custody always has been, and always must be, unless the\r\n     Constitution be changed, intrusted to the executive department. No\r\n     officer can be created by Congress, for the purpose of taking\r\n     charge of it, whose appointment would not, by the Constitution, at\r\n     once devolve on the President, and who would not be responsible to\r\n     him for the faithful performance of his duties.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in another place, it declares that \"Congress cannot, therefore,\r\ntake out of the hands of the executive department the custody of the\r\npublic property or money, without an assumption of executive power, and\r\na subversion of the first principles of the Constitution.\" These, Sir,\r\nare propositions which cannot receive too much attention. They affirm,\r\nthat the custody of the public money constitutionally and necessarily\r\nbelongs to the executive; and that, until the Constitution is changed,\r\nCongress cannot take it out of his hands, nor make any provision for its\r\ncustody, except by such superintendents and keepers as are appointed by\r\nthe President and removable at his will. If these assertions be correct,\r\nwe have, indeed, a singular constitution for a republican government;\r\nfor we give the executive the control, the custody, and the possession\r\nof the public treasury, by original constitutional provision; and when\r\nCongress appropriates, it appropriates only what is already in the\r\nPresident's hands.\r\n\r\nSir, I hold these propositions to be sound in neither branch. I maintain\r\nthat the custody of the public money does not necessarily belong to the\r\nexecutive, under this government; and I hold that Congress may so\r\ndispose of it, that it shall be under the superintendence of keepers not\r\nappointed by the President, nor removable at his will. I think it\r\ncompetent for Congress to declare, as Congress did declare in the bank\r\ncharter, that the public deposits should be made in the bank. When in\r\nthe bank, they were not kept by persons appointed by the President, or\r\nremovable at his will. He could not change that custody; nor could it be\r\nchanged at all, but according to provisions made in the law itself.\r\nThere was, indeed, a provision in the law authorizing the _Secretary_\r\nto change the custody. But suppose there had been no such provision;\r\nsuppose the contingent power had not been given to the Secretary; would\r\nit not have been a lawful enactment? Might not the law have provided\r\nthat the public moneys should remain in the bank, until Congress itself\r\nshould otherwise order, leaving no power of removal anywhere else? And\r\nif such provision had been made, what power, or custody, or control,\r\nwould the President have possessed over them? Clearly, none at all. The\r\nact of May, 1800, directed custom-house bonds, in places where the bank\r\nwhich was then in existence was situated, or in which it had branches,\r\nto be deposited in the bank or its branches for collection, without the\r\nreservation to the Secretary, or anybody else, of any power of removal.\r\nNow, Sir, this was an unconstitutional law, if the Protest, in the part\r\nnow under consideration, be correct; because it placed the public money\r\nin a custody beyond the control of the President, and in the hands of\r\nkeepers not appointed by him, nor removable at his pleasure. One may\r\nreadily discern, Sir, the process of reasoning by which the author of\r\nthe Protest brought himself to the conclusion that Congress could not\r\nplace the public moneys beyond the President's control. It is all\r\nfounded on the power of appointment and the power of removal. These\r\npowers, it is supposed, must give the President complete control and\r\nauthority over those who actually hold the money, and therefore must\r\nnecessarily subject its custody, at all times, to his own individual\r\nwill. This is the argument.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that the appointment of all public officers, with some\r\nexceptions, is, by the Constitution, given to the President, with the\r\nconsent of the Senate; and as, in most cases, public property must be\r\nheld by some officer, its keepers will generally be persons so\r\nappointed. But this is only the common, not a necessary consequence, of\r\ngiving the appointing power to the President and Senate. Congress may\r\nstill, if it shall so see fit, place the public treasure in the hand of\r\nno officer appointed by the President, or removable by him, but in hands\r\nquite beyond his control. Subject to one contingency only, it did this\r\nvery thing by the charter of the present bank; and it did the same thing\r\nabsolutely, and subject to no contingency, by the law of 1800. The\r\nProtest, in the first place, seizes on the fact that all officers must\r\nbe appointed by the President, or on his nomination; it then assumes the\r\nnext step, that all officers are, and _must be_, removable at his\r\npleasure; and then, insisting that public money, like other public\r\nproperty, must be kept by _some public officer_, it thus arrives at the\r\nconclusion that it _must_ always be in the hands of those who are\r\nappointed by the President, and who are removable at his pleasure. And\r\nit is very clear that the Protest means to maintain that the _tenure of\r\noffice cannot be so regulated by law, as that public officers shall not\r\nbe removable at the pleasure of the President_.\r\n\r\nThe President considers the right of removal as a fixed, vested,\r\nconstitutional right, which Congress cannot limit, control, or qualify,\r\nuntil the Constitution shall be altered. This, Sir, is doctrine which I\r\nam not prepared to admit. I shall not now discuss the question, whether\r\nthe law may not place the tenure of office beyond the reach of executive\r\npleasure; but I wish merely to draw the attention of the Senate to the\r\nfact, that any such power in Congress is denied by the principles and by\r\nthe words of the Protest. According to that paper, we live under a\r\nconstitution by the provisions of which the public treasures are,\r\nnecessarily and unavoidably, always under executive control; and as the\r\nexecutive may remove all officers, and appoint others, at least\r\ntemporarily, without the concurrence of the Senate, he may hold those\r\ntreasures, in the hands of persons appointed by himself alone, in\r\ndefiance of any law which Congress has passed or can pass. It is to be\r\nseen, Sir, how far such claims of power will receive the approbation of\r\nthe country. It is to be seen whether a construction will be readily\r\nadopted which thus places the public purse out of the guardianship of\r\nthe immediate representatives of the people.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, there is, in this paper, something even yet more strange than\r\nthese extraordinary claims of power. There is a strong disposition,\r\nrunning through the whole Protest, to represent the executive department\r\nof this government as the peculiar protector of the public liberty, the\r\nchief security on which the people are to rely against the encroachment\r\nof other branches of the government. Nothing can be more manifest than\r\nthis purpose. To this end, the Protest spreads out the President's\r\nofficial oath, reciting all its words in a formal quotation; and yet the\r\noath of members of Congress is exactly equivalent. The President is to\r\nswear that he will \"preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution\"; and\r\nmembers of Congress are to swear that they will \"support the\r\nConstitution.\" There are more words in one oath than the other, but the\r\nsense is precisely the same. Why, then, this reference to his official\r\noath, and this ostentatious quotation of it? Would the writer of the\r\nProtest argue that the oath itself is any grant of power; or that,\r\nbecause the President is to \"preserve, protect, and defend the\r\nConstitution,\" he is therefore to use what means he pleases for such\r\npreservation, protection, and defence, or any means except those which\r\nthe Constitution and laws have specifically given him? Such an argument\r\nwould be absurd; but if the oath be not cited for this preposterous\r\npurpose, with what design is it thus displayed on the face of the\r\nProtest, unless it be to support the general idea that the maintenance\r\nof the Constitution and the preservation of the public liberties are\r\nespecially confided to the safe discretion, the sure moderation, the\r\npaternal guardianship, of executive power? The oath of the President\r\ncontains three words, all of equal import; that is, that he will\r\n_preserve_, _protect_, and _defend_ the Constitution. The oath of\r\nmembers of Congress is expressed in shorter phrase; it is, that they\r\nwill _support_ the Constitution. If there be any difference in the\r\nmeaning of the two oaths, I cannot discern it; and yet the Protest\r\nsolemnly and formally argues thus: \"The duty of defending, so far as in\r\nhim lies, the integrity of the Constitution, would, indeed, have\r\nresulted from the very nature of his office; but by thus expressing it\r\nin the official oath or affirmation, which, in this respect, differs\r\nfrom that of every other functionary, the founders of our republic have\r\nattested their sense of its importance, and have given to it a peculiar\r\nsolemnity and force.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I deny the proposition, and I dispute the proof. I deny that the\r\nduty of defending the integrity of the Constitution is, in any peculiar\r\nsense, confided to the President; and I deny that the words of his oath\r\nfurnish any argument to make good that proposition. Be pleased, Sir, to\r\nremember _against whom it is_ that the President holds it _his_ peculiar\r\nduty to defend the integrity of the Constitution. It is not against\r\nexternal force; it is not against a foreign foe; no such thing; _but it\r\nis against the representatives of the people and the representatives of\r\nthe States_! It is against these that the founders of our republic have\r\nimposed on him the duty of defending the integrity of the Constitution;\r\na duty, he says, of the importance of which they have attested their\r\nsense, and to which they have given peculiar solemnity and force, by\r\nexpressing it in his official oath!\r\n\r\nLet us pause, Sir, and consider this most strange proposition. The\r\nPresident is the chief executive magistrate. He is commander-in-chief of\r\nthe army and navy; nominates all persons to office; claims a right to\r\nremove all at will, and to control all, while yet in office; dispenses\r\nall favors; and wields the whole patronage of the government. And the\r\nproposition is, that the duty of defending the integrity of the\r\nConstitution against the representatives of the States and against the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, _results to him from the very nature of\r\nhis office_; and that the founders of our republic have given to this\r\nduty, thus confided to him, peculiar solemnity and force!\r\n\r\nMr. President, the contest, for ages, has been to rescue Liberty from\r\nthe grasp of executive power. Whoever has engaged in her sacred cause,\r\nfrom the days of the downfall of those great aristocracies which had\r\nstood between the king and the people to the time of our own\r\nindependence, has struggled for the accomplishment of that single\r\nobject. On the long list of the champions of human freedom, there is not\r\none name dimmed by the reproach of advocating the extension of executive\r\nauthority; on the contrary, the uniform and steady purpose of all such\r\nchampions has been to limit and restrain it. To this end the spirit of\r\nliberty, growing more and more enlightened and more and more vigorous\r\nfrom age to age, has been battering, for centuries, against the solid\r\nbutments of the feudal system. To this end, all that could be gained\r\nfrom the imprudence, snatched from the weakness, or wrung from the\r\nnecessities of crowned heads, has been carefully gathered up, secured,\r\nand hoarded, as the rich treasures, the very jewels of liberty. To this\r\nend, popular and representative right has kept up its warfare against\r\nprerogative, with various success; sometimes writing the history of a\r\nwhole age in blood, sometimes witnessing the martyrdom of Sidneys and\r\nRussells, often baffled and repulsed, but still gaining, on the whole,\r\nand holding what it gained with a grasp which nothing but the complete\r\nextinction of its own being could compel it to relinquish. At length,\r\nthe great conquest over executive power, in the leading western states\r\nof Europe, has been accomplished. The feudal system, like other\r\nstupendous fabrics of past ages, is known only by the rubbish which it\r\nhas left behind it. Crowned heads have been compelled to submit to the\r\nrestraints of law, and the PEOPLE, with that intelligence and that\r\nspirit which make their voice resistless, have been able to say to\r\nprerogative, \"Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther.\" I need hardly\r\nsay, Sir, that into the full enjoyment of all which Europe has reached\r\nonly through such slow and painful steps we sprang at once, by the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and by the establishment of free\r\nrepresentative governments; governments borrowing more or less from the\r\nmodels of other free states, but strengthened, secured, improved in\r\ntheir symmetry, and deepened in their foundation, by those great men of\r\nour own country whose names will be as familiar to future times as if\r\nthey were written on the arch of the sky.\r\n\r\nThrough all this history of the contest for liberty, executive power has\r\nbeen regarded as a lion which must be caged. So far from being the\r\nobject of enlightened popular trust, so far from being considered the\r\nnatural protector of popular right, it has been dreaded, uniformly,\r\nalways dreaded, as the great source of its danger.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, who is he, so ignorant of the history of liberty, at home\r\nand abroad; who is he, yet dwelling in his contemplations among the\r\nprinciples and dogmas of the Middle Ages; who is he, from whose bosom\r\nall original infusion of American spirit has become so entirely\r\nevaporated and exhaled, that he shall put into the mouth of the\r\nPresident of the United States the doctrine that the defence of liberty\r\n_naturally results to_ executive power, and is its peculiar duty? Who is\r\nhe, that, generous and confiding towards power where it is most\r\ndangerous, and jealous only of those who can restrain it,--who is he,\r\nthat, reversing the order of the state, and upheaving the base, would\r\npoise the pyramid of the political system upon its apex? Who is he,\r\nthat, overlooking with contempt the guardianship of the representatives\r\nof the people, and with equal contempt the higher guardianship of the\r\npeople themselves,--who is he that declares to us, through the\r\nPresident's lips, that the security for freedom rests in executive\r\nauthority? Who is he that belies the blood and libels the fame of his\r\nown ancestors, by declaring that _they_, with solemnity of form, and\r\nforce of manner, have invoked the executive power to come to the\r\nprotection of liberty? Who is he that thus charges them with the\r\ninsanity, or the recklessness, of putting the lamb beneath the lion's\r\npaw? No, Sir. No, Sir. Our security is in our watchfulness of executive\r\npower. It was the constitution of this department which was infinitely\r\nthe most difficult part in the great work of creating our present\r\ngovernment. To give to the executive department such power as should\r\nmake it useful, and yet not such as should render it dangerous; to make\r\nit efficient, independent, and strong, and yet to prevent it from\r\nsweeping away every thing by its union of military and civil authority,\r\nby the influence of patronage, and office, and favor,--this, indeed, was\r\ndifficult. They who had the work to do saw the difficulty, and we see\r\nit; and if we would maintain our system, we shall act wisely to that\r\nend, by preserving every restraint and every guard which the\r\nConstitution has provided. And when we, and those who come after us,\r\nhave done all that we can do, and all that they can do, it will be well\r\nfor us and for them, if some popular executive, by the power of\r\npatronage and party, and the power, too, of that very popularity, shall\r\nnot hereafter prove an overmatch for all other branches of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nI do not wish, Sir, to impair the power of the President, as it stands\r\nwritten down in the Constitution, and as great and good men have\r\nhitherto exercised it. In this, as in other respects, I am for the\r\nConstitution as it is. But I will not acquiesce in the reversal of all\r\njust ideas of government; I will not degrade the character of popular\r\nrepresentation; I will not blindly confide, where all experience\r\nadmonishes me to be jealous; I will not trust executive power, vested in\r\nthe hands of a single magistrate, to be the guardian of liberty.\r\n\r\nHaving claimed for the executive the especial guardianship of the\r\nConstitution, the Protest proceeds to present a summary view of the\r\npowers which are supposed to be conferred on the executive by that\r\ninstrument. And it is to this part of the message, Sir, that I would,\r\nmore than to all others, call the particular attention of the Senate. I\r\nconfess that it was only upon careful reperusal of the paper that I\r\nperceived the extent to which its assertions of power reach. I do not\r\nspeak now of the President's claims of power as opposed to legislative\r\nauthority, but of his opinions as to his own authority, duty, and\r\nresponsibility, as connected with all other officers under the\r\ngovernment. He is of opinion that the whole executive power is vested in\r\nhim, and that he is responsible for its entire exercise; that among the\r\nduties imposed on him is that of \"taking care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed\"; and that, \"being thus made responsible for the\r\nentire action of the executive department, it is but reasonable that the\r\npower of appointing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the\r\nlaws, a power in its nature executive, should remain in his hands. It\r\nis, therefore, not only his right, but the Constitution makes it his\r\nduty, to 'nominate, and, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate, appoint,' all 'officers of the United States whose appointments\r\nare not in the Constitution otherwise provided for,' with a proviso that\r\nthe appointment of inferior officers may be vested in the President\r\nalone, in the courts of justice, or in the heads of departments.\"\r\n\r\nThe first proposition, then, which the Protest asserts, in regard to the\r\nPresident's powers as executive magistrate, is, that, the general duty\r\nbeing imposed on him by the Constitution of taking care that the laws be\r\nfaithfully executed, _he thereby becomes himself responsible for the\r\nconduct of every person employed in the government_; \"for the entire\r\naction,\" as the paper expresses it, \"of the executive department.\" This,\r\nSir, is very dangerous logic. I reject the inference altogether. No such\r\nresponsibility, nor any thing like it, follows from the general\r\nprovision of the Constitution making it his duty to see the laws\r\nexecuted. If it did, we should have, in fact, but one officer in the\r\nwhole government. The President would be everybody. And the Protest\r\nassumes to the President this whole responsibility for every other\r\nofficer, for the very purpose of making the President everybody, of\r\nannihilating every thing like independence, responsibility, or\r\n_character_, in all other public agents. The whole responsibility is\r\nassumed, in order that it may be more plausibly argued that all officers\r\nof government are not agents of the law, but the President's agents, and\r\ntherefore responsible to him alone. If he be responsible for the conduct\r\nof all officers, and they be responsible to him only, then it may be\r\nmaintained that such officers are but his own agents, his substitutes,\r\nhis deputies. The first thing to be done, therefore, is to assume the\r\nresponsibility for all; and this you will perceive, Sir, is done, in the\r\nfullest manner, in the passages which I have read. Having thus assumed\r\nfor the President the entire responsibility of the whole government, the\r\nProtest advances boldly to its conclusion, and claims, at once, absolute\r\npower over all individuals in office, as being merely the President's\r\nagents. This is the language: \"The whole executive power being vested in\r\nthe President, who is responsible for its exercise, it is a necessary\r\nconsequence that he should have a right to employ agents of his own\r\nchoice to aid him in the performance of his duties, and to discharge\r\nthem when he is no longer willing to be responsible for their acts.\"\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, completes the work. This handsomely rounds off the whole\r\nexecutive system of executive authority. First, the President has the\r\nwhole responsibility; and then, being thus responsible for all, he has,\r\nand ought to have, the whole power. We have heard of political _units_,\r\nand our American executive, as here represented, is indeed a _unit_. We\r\nhave a charmingly simple government! Instead of many officers, in\r\ndifferent departments, each having appropriate duties, and each\r\nresponsible for his own duties, we are so fortunate as to have to deal\r\nwith but one officer. The President carries on the government; all the\r\nrest are but sub-contractors. Sir, whatever _name_ we give him, we have\r\nbut ONE EXECUTIVE OFFICER. A Briareus sits in the centre of our system,\r\nand with his hundred hands touches every thing, moves every thing,\r\ncontrols every thing. I ask, Sir, Is this republicanism? Is this a\r\ngovernment of laws? Is this legal responsibility?\r\n\r\nAccording to the Protest, the very duties which every officer under the\r\ngovernment performs are the duties of the President himself. It says\r\nthat the President has a right to employ _agents_ of his _own choice_,\r\nto aid HIM in the performance of HIS duties.\r\n\r\nMr. President, if these doctrines be true, it is idle for us any longer\r\nto talk about any such thing as a government of laws. We have no\r\ngovernment of laws, not even the semblance or shadow of it; we have no\r\nlegal responsibility. We have an executive, consisting of one person,\r\nwielding all official power, and which is, to every effectual purpose,\r\ncompletely _irresponsible_. The President declares that he is\r\n\"responsible for the entire action of the executive department.\"\r\nResponsible? What does he mean by being \"responsible\"? Does he mean\r\nlegal responsibility? Certainly not. No such thing. Legal responsibility\r\nsignifies liability to punishment for misconduct or maladministration.\r\nBut the Protest does not mean that the President is liable to be\r\nimpeached and punished if a secretary of state should commit treason, if\r\na collector of the customs should be guilty of bribery, or if a\r\ntreasurer should embezzle the public money. It does not mean, and cannot\r\nmean, that he should be answerable for any such crime or such\r\ndelinquency. What then, is its notion of that _responsibility_ which it\r\nsays the President is under for all officers, and which authorizes him\r\nto consider all officers as his own personal agents? Sir, it is merely\r\nresponsibility to public opinion. It is a liability to be blamed; it is\r\nthe chance of becoming unpopular, the danger of losing a re-election.\r\nNothing else is meant in the world. It is the hazard of failing in any\r\nattempt or enterprise of ambition. This is all the responsibility to\r\nwhich the doctrines of the Protest hold the President subject.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely the _responsibility_ under which Cromwell acted when he\r\ndispersed Parliament, telling its members, not in so many words, indeed,\r\nthat they disobeyed the will of their constituents, but telling them\r\nthat the people were sick of them, and that he drove them out \"for the\r\nglory of God and the good of the nation.\" It is precisely the\r\nresponsibility upon which Bonaparte broke up the popular assembly of\r\nFrance. I do not mean, Sir, certainly, by these illustrations, to\r\ninsinuate designs of violent usurpation against the President; far from\r\nit; but I do mean to maintain, that such responsibility as that with\r\nwhich the Protest clothes him is no legal responsibility, no\r\nconstitutional responsibility, no republican responsibility, but a mere\r\nliability to loss of office, loss of character, and loss of fame, if he\r\nshall choose to violate the laws and overturn the liberties of the\r\ncountry. It is such a responsibility as leaves every thing in his\r\ndiscretion and his pleasure.\r\n\r\nSir, it exceeds human belief that any man should put sentiments such as\r\nthis paper contains into a public communication from the President to\r\nthe Senate. They are sentiments which give us all one master. The\r\nProtest asserts an absolute right to remove all persons from office at\r\npleasure; and for what reason? Because they are incompetent? Because\r\nthey are incapable? Because they are remiss, negligent, or inattentive?\r\nNo, Sir; these are not the reasons. But he may discharge them, one and\r\nall, simply because \"he is no longer willing to be responsible for their\r\nacts\"! It insists on an absolute right in the President to _direct and\r\ncontrol_ every act of every officer of the government, except the\r\njudges. It asserts this right of direct _control_ over and over again.\r\nThe President may go into the treasury, among the auditors and\r\ncomptrollers, and _direct_ them how to settle every man's account; what\r\nabatements to make from one, what additions to another. He may go into\r\nthe custom-house, among collectors and appraisers, and may _control_\r\nestimates, reductions, and appraisements. It is true that these officers\r\nare sworn to discharge the duties of their respective offices honestly\r\nand fairly, according to their _own_ best abilities; it is true, that\r\nmany of them are liable to indictment for official misconduct, and\r\nothers responsible, in suits of individuals, for damages and penalties,\r\nif such official misconduct be proved; but notwithstanding all this, the\r\nProtest avers that all these officers are but the _President's agents_;\r\nthat they are but aiding _him_ in the discharge of _his_ duties; that\r\n_he_ is responsible for their conduct, and that they are removable at\r\nhis will and pleasure. And it is under this view of his own authority\r\nthat the President calls the Secretaries _his_ Secretaries, not once\r\nonly, but repeatedly. After half a century's administration of this\r\ngovernment, Sir;--after we have endeavored, by statute upon statute, and\r\nby provision following provision, to define and limit official\r\nauthority; to assign particular duties to particular public servants; to\r\ndefine those duties; to create penalties for their violation; to adjust\r\naccurately the responsibility of each agent with his own powers and his\r\nown duties; to establish the prevalence of equal rule; to make the law,\r\nas far as possible, every thing, and individual will, as far as\r\npossible, nothing;--after all this, the astounding assertion rings in\r\nour ears, that, throughout the whole range of official agency, in its\r\nsmallest ramifications as well as in its larger masses, there is but ONE\r\nRESPONSIBILITY, ONE DISCRETION, ONE WILL! True indeed is it, Sir, if\r\nthese sentiments be maintained,--true indeed is it that a President of\r\nthe United States may well repeat from Napoleon what he repeated from\r\nLouis the Fourteenth, \"I am the state\"!\r\n\r\nThe argument by which the writer of the Protest endeavors to establish\r\nthe President's claim to this vast mass of accumulated authority, is\r\nfounded on the provision of the Constitution that the executive power\r\nshall be vested in the President. No doubt the executive power is vested\r\nin the President; but what and how much executive power, and how\r\nlimited? To this question I should answer, \"Look to the Constitution,\r\nand see; examine the particulars of the grant, and learn what that\r\nexecutive power is which is given to the President, either by express\r\nwords or by necessary implication.\" But so the writer of this Protest\r\ndoes not reason. He takes these words of the Constitution as being, of\r\nthemselves, a general original grant of all executive power to the\r\nPresident, subject only to such express limitations as the Constitution\r\nprescribes. This is clearly the writer's view of the subject, unless,\r\nindeed, he goes behind the Constitution altogether, as some expressions\r\nwould intimate, to search elsewhere for sources of executive power.\r\nThus, the Protest says that it is not only the _right_ of the President,\r\nbut that the Constitution makes it his _duty_, to appoint persons to\r\noffice; as if the _right_ existed before the Constitution had created\r\nthe _duty_. It speaks, too, of the power of removal, not as a power\r\n_granted_ by the Constitution, but expressly as \"an original executive\r\npower, _left_ unchecked by the Constitution.\" How original? Coming from\r\nwhat source higher than the Constitution? I should be glad to know how\r\nthe President gets possession of any power by a title earlier, or more\r\n_original_, than the grant of the Constitution; or what is meant by an\r\n_original_ power, which the President possesses, and which the\r\nConstitution has _left_ unchecked in his hands. The truth is, Sir, most\r\nassuredly, that the writer of the Protest, in these passages, was\r\nreasoning upon the British constitution, and not upon the Constitution\r\nof the United States. Indeed, he professes to found himself on authority\r\ndrawn from the constitution of England. I will read, Sir, the whole\r\npassage. It is this:--\r\n\r\n     \"In strict accordance with this principle, the power of removal,\r\n     which, like that of appointment, is an original executive power, is\r\n     left unchecked by the Constitution in relation to all executive\r\n     officers, for whose conduct the President is responsible; while it\r\n     is taken from him in relation to judicial officers, for whose acts\r\n     he is not responsible. _In the government from which many of the\r\n     fundamental principles of our system are derived, the head of the\r\n     executive department originally had power to appoint and remove at\r\n     will all officers, executive and judicial._ It was to take the\r\n     judges out of this general power of removal, and thus make them\r\n     independent of the executive, that the tenure of their offices was\r\n     changed to good behavior. Nor is it conceivable why they are\r\n     placed, in our Constitution, upon a tenure different from that of\r\n     all other officers appointed by the executive, unless it be for the\r\n     same purpose.\"\r\n\r\nMr. President, I do most solemnly protest (if I, too, may be permitted\r\nto make a protest) against this mode of reasoning. The analogy between\r\nthe British constitution and ours, in this respect, is not close enough\r\nto guide us safely; it can only mislead us. It has entirely misled the\r\nwriter of the Protest. The President is made to argue, upon this\r\nsubject, as if he had some right _anterior_ to the Constitution, which\r\nright is by that instrument checked, in some respects, and in other\r\nrespects is left unchecked, but which, nevertheless, still derives its\r\nbeing from another source; just as the British king had, in the early\r\nages of the monarchy, an uncontrolled right of appointing and removing\r\nall officers at pleasure, but which right, so far as it respects the\r\njudges, has since been checked and controlled by act of Parliament; the\r\nright being original and inherent, the _check_ only imposed by law. Sir,\r\nI distrust altogether British precedents, authorities, and analogies, on\r\nsuch questions as this. We are not inquiring how far our Constitution\r\nhas imposed checks on a pre-existing authority. We are inquiring what\r\nextent of power that Constitution has _granted_. The grant of power, the\r\nwhole source of power, as well as the restrictions and limitations which\r\nare imposed on it, is made in and by the Constitution. It has no other\r\norigin. And it is this, Sir, which distinguishes our system so very\r\nwidely and materially from the systems of Europe. _Our_ governments are\r\nlimited governments; limited in their origin, in their very creation;\r\nlimited, because none but specific powers were ever granted, either to\r\nany department of government, or to the whole: _theirs_ are limited,\r\nwhenever limited at all, by reason of restraints imposed at different\r\ntimes on governments originally unlimited and despotic. Our American\r\nquestions, therefore, must be discussed, reasoned on, decided, and\r\nsettled, on the appropriate principles of our own constitutions, and not\r\nby inapplicable precedents and loose analogies drawn from foreign\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nMr. President, in one of the French comedies, as you know, in which the\r\ndulness and prolixity of legal argument is intended to be severely\r\nsatirized, while the advocate is tediously groping among ancient lore\r\nhaving nothing to do with his case, the judge grows impatient, and at\r\nlast cries out to him to _come down to the flood_! I really wish, Sir,\r\nthat the writer of this Protest, since he was discussing matters of the\r\nhighest importance to us as Americans, and which arise out of our own\r\npeculiar Constitution, had kept himself, not only on this side the\r\ngeneral deluge, but also on this side the Atlantic. I desire that the\r\nbroad waves of that wide sea should continue to roll between us and the\r\ninfluence of those foreign principles and foreign precedents which he so\r\neagerly adopts.\r\n\r\nIn asserting power for an American President, I prefer that he should\r\nattempt to maintain his assertions on American reasons. I know not, Sir,\r\nwho the writer was (I wish I did); but whoever he was, it is manifest\r\nthat he argues this part of his case, throughout, on the principles of\r\nthe constitution of England. It is true, that, in England, the king is\r\nregarded as the original fountain of all honor and all office; and that\r\nanciently, indeed, he possessed all political power of every kind. It is\r\ntrue that this mass of authority, in the progress of that government,\r\nhas been diminished, restrained, and controlled, by charters, by\r\nimmunities, by grants, and by various modifications, which the friends\r\nof liberty have, at different periods, been able to obtain or to impose.\r\nAll liberty, as we know, all popular privileges, as indeed the word\r\nitself imports, were formerly considered as favors and concessions from\r\nthe monarch. But whenever and wherever civil freedom could get a\r\nfoothold, and could maintain itself, these favors were turned into\r\nrights. Before and during the reigns of the princes of the Stuart\r\nfamily, they were acknowledged only as favors or privileges graciously\r\nallowed, although, even then, whenever opportunity offered, as in the\r\ninstance to which I alluded just now, they were contended for as rights;\r\nand by the Revolution of 1688 they were acknowledged as the rights of\r\nEnglishmen, by the prince who then ascended the throne, and as the\r\ncondition on which he was allowed to sit upon it. But with us there\r\nnever was a time when we acknowledged original, unrestrained, sovereign\r\npower over us. Our constitutions are not made to limit and restrain\r\npre-existing authority. They are the instruments by which the people\r\nconfer power on their own servants. If I may use a legal phrase, the\r\npeople are grantors, not grantees. They give to the government, and to\r\neach branch of it, all the power it possesses, or can possess; and what\r\nis not given they retain. In England, before her revolution, and in the\r\nrest of Europe since, if we would know the extent of liberty or popular\r\nright, we must go to grants, to charters, to allowances and indulgences.\r\nBut with us, we go to grants and to constitutions to learn the extent of\r\nthe powers of government. No political power is more original than the\r\nConstitution; none is possessed which is not there granted; and the\r\ngrant, and the limitations in the grant, are in the same instrument.\r\n\r\nThe powers, therefore, belonging to any branch of our government, are to\r\nbe construed and settled, not by remote analogies drawn from other\r\ngovernments, but from the words of the grant itself, in their plain\r\nsense and necessary import, and according to an interpretation\r\nconsistent with our own history and the spirit of our own institutions.\r\nI will never agree that a President of the United States holds the whole\r\nundivided power of office in his own hands, upon the theory that he is\r\nresponsible for the entire action of the whole body of those engaged in\r\ncarrying on the government and executing the laws. Such a responsibility\r\nis purely ideal, delusive, and vain. There is, there can be, no\r\nsubstantial responsibility, any further than every individual is\r\nanswerable, not merely in his reputation, not merely in the opinion of\r\nmankind, but _to the law_, for the faithful discharge of his own\r\nappropriate duties. Again and again we hear it said that the President\r\nis responsible to the American people! that he is responsible to the bar\r\nof public opinion! For whatever he does, he assumes accountability to\r\nthe American people! For whatever he omits, he expects to be brought to\r\nthe high bar of public opinion! And this is thought enough for a\r\nlimited, restrained, republican government! an undefined, undefinable,\r\nideal responsibility to the public judgment!\r\n\r\nSir, if all this mean any thing, if it be not empty sound, it means no\r\nless than that the President may do any thing and every thing which he\r\nmay expect to be tolerated in doing. He may go just so far as he thinks\r\nit safe to go; and Cromwell and Bonaparte went no farther. I ask again,\r\nSir, is this legal responsibility? Is this the true nature of a\r\ngovernment with written laws and limited powers? And allow me, Sir, to\r\nask, too, if an executive magistrate, while professing to act under the\r\nConstitution, is restrained only by this responsibility to public\r\nopinion, what prevents him, on the same responsibility, from proposing a\r\nchange in that Constitution? Why may he not say, \"I am about to\r\nintroduce new forms, new principles, and a new spirit; I am about to try\r\na political experiment on a great scale; and when I get through with it,\r\nI shall be responsible to the American people, I shall be answerable to\r\nthe bar of public opinion\"?\r\n\r\nConnected, Sir, with the idea of this airy and unreal responsibility to\r\nthe public is another sentiment, which of late we hear frequently\r\nexpressed; and that is, _that the President is the direct representative\r\nof the American people_. This is declared in the Protest in so many\r\nwords. \"The President,\" it says, \"_is the direct representative of the\r\nAmerican people_.\" Now, Sir, this is not the language of the\r\nConstitution. The Constitution nowhere calls him the representative of\r\nthe American people; still less, their direct representative. It could\r\nnot do so with the least propriety. He is not chosen directly by the\r\npeople, but by a body of electors, some of whom are chosen by the\r\npeople, and some of whom are appointed by the State legislatures. Where,\r\nthen, is the authority for saying that the President is the _direct\r\nrepresentative of the people_? The Constitution calls the members of the\r\nother house Representatives, and declares that they shall be chosen by\r\nthe people; and there are no other direct or immediate representatives\r\nof the people in this government. The Constitution denominates the\r\nPresident simply the President of the United States; it points out the\r\ncomplex mode of electing him, defines his powers and duties, and imposes\r\nlimits and restraints on his authority. With these powers and duties,\r\nand under these restraints, he becomes, when chosen, President of the\r\nUnited States. That is his character, and the denomination of his\r\noffice. How is it, then, that, on this official character, thus\r\ncautiously created, limited, and defined, he is to engraft another and a\r\nvery imposing character, namely, the character _of the direct\r\nrepresentative of the American people_? I hold this, Sir, to be mere\r\nassumption, and dangerous assumption. If he is the representative of\r\n_all_ the American people, he is the only representative which they all\r\nhave. Nobody else presumes to represent all the people. And if he may be\r\nallowed to consider himself as the SOLE REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL THE\r\nAMERICAN PEOPLE, and is to act under no other responsibility than such\r\nas I have already described, then I say, Sir, that the government (I\r\nwill not say the people) has already a master. I deny the sentiment,\r\ntherefore, and I protest against the language; neither the sentiment nor\r\nthe language is to be found in the Constitution of the country; and\r\nwhoever is not satisfied to describe the powers of the President in the\r\nlanguage of the Constitution may be justly suspected of being as little\r\nsatisfied with the powers themselves. The President is President. His\r\noffice and his name of office are known, and both are fixed and\r\ndescribed by law. Being commander of the army and navy, holding the\r\npower of nominating to office and removing from office, and being by\r\nthese powers the fountain of all patronage and all favor, what does he\r\nnot become if he be allowed to superadd to all this the character of\r\nsingle representative of the American people? Sir, he becomes what\r\nAmerica has not been accustomed to see, what this Constitution has never\r\ncreated, and what I cannot contemplate but with profound alarm. He who\r\nmay call himself the single representative of a nation may speak in the\r\nname of the nation, may undertake to wield the power of the nation; and\r\nwho shall gainsay him in whatsoever he chooses to pronounce to be the\r\nnation's will?\r\n\r\nI will now, Sir, ask leave to recapitulate the general doctrines of this\r\nProtest, and to present them together. They are,--\r\n\r\nThat neither branch of the legislature can take up, or consider, for the\r\npurpose of censure, any official act of the President, without some view\r\nto legislation or impeachment;\r\n\r\nThat not only the passage, but the discussion, of the resolution of the\r\nSenate of the 28th of March, was unauthorized by the Constitution, and\r\nrepugnant to its provisions;\r\n\r\nThat the custody of the public treasury always must be intrusted to the\r\nexecutive; that Congress cannot take it out of his hands, nor place it\r\nanywhere under such superintendents and keepers as are appointed by him,\r\nresponsible to him, and removable at his will;\r\n\r\nThat the whole executive power is in the President, and that therefore\r\nthe duty of defending the integrity of the Constitution _results to him\r\nfrom the very nature of his office_; and that the founders of our\r\nrepublic have attested their sense of the importance of this duty, and,\r\nby expressing it in his official oath, have given to it peculiar\r\nsolemnity and force;\r\n\r\nThat, as he is to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, he is\r\nthereby made responsible for the entire action of the executive\r\ndepartment, with the power of appointing, overseeing, and _controlling_\r\nthose who execute the laws;\r\n\r\nThat the power of removal from office, like that of appointment, is an\r\n_original_ executive power, and is _left_ in his hands _unchecked_ by\r\nthe Constitution, except in the case of judges; that, being responsible\r\nfor the exercise of the whole executive power, he has a right to employ\r\nagents of his own choice to assist _him_ in the performance of _his_\r\nduties, and to discharge them when he is no longer willing to be\r\nresponsible for their acts;\r\n\r\nThat the Secretaries are _his_ Secretaries, and all persons appointed to\r\noffices created by law, except the judges, _his_ agents, responsible to\r\nhim, and removable at his pleasure;\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, that he is the _direct representative of the American\r\npeople_.\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are some of the leading propositions contained in the\r\nProtest; and if they be true, then the government under which we live is\r\nan elective monarchy. It is not yet absolute; there are yet some checks\r\nand limitations in the Constitution and laws; but, in its essential and\r\nprevailing character, it is an elective monarchy.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I have spoken freely of this Protest, and of the\r\ndoctrines which it advances; but I have spoken deliberately. On these\r\nhigh questions of constitutional law, respect for my own character, as\r\nwell as a solemn and profound sense of duty, restrains me from giving\r\nutterance to a single sentiment which does not flow from entire\r\nconviction. I feel that I am not wrong. I feel that an inborn and inbred\r\nlove of constitutional liberty, and some study of our political\r\ninstitutions, have not on this occasion misled me. But I have desired to\r\nsay nothing that should give pain to the chief magistrate personally. I\r\nhave not sought to fix arrows in his breast; but I believe him mistaken,\r\naltogether mistaken, in the sentiments which he has expressed; and I\r\nmust concur with others in placing on the records of the Senate my\r\ndisapprobation of those sentiments. On a vote which is to remain so long\r\nas any proceeding of the Senate shall last, and on a question which can\r\nnever cease to be important while the Constitution of the country\r\nendures, I have desired to make public my reasons. They will now be\r\nknown, and I submit them to the judgment of the present and of after\r\ntimes. Sir, the occasion is full of interest. It cannot pass off without\r\nleaving strong impressions on the character of public men. A collision\r\nhas taken place which I could have most anxiously wished to avoid; but\r\nit was not to be shunned. We have not sought this controversy; it has\r\nmet us, and been forced upon us. In my judgment, the law has been\r\ndisregarded, and the Constitution transgressed; the fortress of liberty\r\nhas been assaulted, and circumstances have placed the Senate in the\r\nbreach; and, although we may perish in it, I know we shall not fly from\r\nit. But I am fearless of consequences. We shall hold on, Sir, and hold\r\nout, till the people themselves come to its defence. We shall raise the\r\nalarm, and maintain the post, till they whose right it is shall decide\r\nwhether the Senate be a faction, wantonly resisting lawful power, or\r\nwhether it be opposing, with firmness and patriotism, violations of\r\nliberty and inroads upon the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Commonly called the Sedition Act, approved 14th July,\r\n1798.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: South Carolina.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPOINTING AND REMOVING POWER.\r\n\r\nDELIVERED IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, ON THE 16TH OF FEBRUARY,\r\n1835, ON THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL, ENTITLED \"AN ACT TO REPEAL THE FIRST\r\nAND SECOND SECTIONS OF THE ACT TO LIMIT THE TERM OF SERVICE OF CERTAIN\r\nOFFICERS THEREIN NAMED.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. President,--The professed object of this bill is the reduction of\r\nexecutive influence and patronage. I concur in the propriety of that\r\nobject. Having no wish to diminish or to control, in the slightest\r\ndegree, the constitutional and legal authority of the presidential\r\noffice, I yet think that the indirect and rapidly increasing influence\r\nwhich it possesses, and which arises from the power of bestowing office\r\nand of taking it away again at pleasure, and from the manner in which\r\nthat power seems now to be systematically exercised, is productive of\r\nserious evils.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the patronage springing from this power of appointment and\r\nremoval is so great, that it brings a dangerous mass of private and\r\npersonal interest into operation in all great public elections and\r\npublic questions. This is a mischief which has reached, already, an\r\nalarming height. The principle of republican governments, we are taught,\r\nis public virtue; and whatever tends either to corrupt this principle,\r\nto debase it, or to weaken its force, tends, in the same degree, to the\r\nfinal overthrow of such governments. Our representative systems suppose,\r\nthat, in exercising the high right of suffrage, the greatest of all\r\npolitical rights, and in forming opinions on great public measures, men\r\nwill act conscientiously, under the influence of public principle and\r\npatriotic duty; and that, in supporting or opposing men or measures,\r\nthere will be a general prevalence of honest, intelligent judgment and\r\nmanly independence. These presumptions lie at the foundation of all hope\r\nof maintaining governments entirely popular. Whenever personal,\r\nindividual, or selfish motives influence the conduct of individuals on\r\npublic questions, they affect the safety of the whole system. When these\r\nmotives run deep and wide, and come in serious conflict with higher,\r\npurer, and more patriotic purposes, they greatly endanger that system;\r\nand all will admit that, if they become general and overwhelming, so\r\nthat all public principle is lost sight of, and every election becomes a\r\nmere scramble for office, the system inevitably must fall. Every wise\r\nman, in and out of government, will endeavor, therefore, to promote the\r\nascendency of public virtue and public principle, and to restrain as far\r\nas practicable, in the actual operation of our institutions, the\r\ninfluence of selfish and private interests.\r\n\r\nI concur with those who think, that, looking to the present, and looking\r\nalso to the future, and regarding all the probabilities that await us in\r\nreference to the character and qualities of those who may fill the\r\nexecutive chair, it is important to the stability of government and the\r\nwelfare of the people that there should be a check to the progress of\r\nofficial influence and patronage. The unlimited power to grant office,\r\nand to take it away, gives a command over the hopes and fears of a vast\r\nmultitude of men. It is generally true, that he who controls another\r\nman's means of living controls his will. Where there are favors to be\r\ngranted, there are usually enough to solicit for them; and when favors\r\nonce granted may be withdrawn at pleasure, there is ordinarily little\r\nsecurity for personal independence of character. The power of giving\r\noffice thus affects the fears of all who are in, and the hopes of all\r\nwho are out. Those who are _out_ endeavor to distinguish themselves by\r\nactive political friendship, by warm personal devotion, by clamorous\r\nsupport of men in whose hands is the power of reward; while those who\r\nare _in_ ordinarily take care that others shall not surpass them in such\r\nqualities or such conduct as are most likely to secure favor. They\r\nresolve not to be outdone in any of the works of partisanship. The\r\nconsequence of all this is obvious. A competition ensues, not of\r\npatriotic labors; not of rough and severe toils for the public good; not\r\nof manliness, independence, and public spirit; but of complaisance, of\r\nindiscriminate support of executive measures, of pliant subserviency and\r\ngross adulation. All throng and rush together to the altar of\r\nman-worship; and there they offer sacrifices, and pour out libations,\r\ntill the thick fumes of their incense turn their own heads, and turn,\r\nalso, the head of him who is the object of their idolatry.\r\n\r\nThe existence of parties in popular governments is not to be avoided;\r\nand if they are formed on constitutional questions, or in regard to\r\ngreat measures of public policy, and do not run to excessive length, it\r\nmay be admitted that, on the whole, they do no great harm. But the\r\npatronage of office, the power of bestowing place and emoluments,\r\ncreates parties, not upon any principle or any measure, but upon the\r\nsingle ground of personal interest. Under the direct influence of this\r\nmotive, they form round a leader, and they go for \"the spoils of\r\nvictory.\" And if the party chieftain becomes the national chieftain, he\r\nis still but too apt to consider all who have opposed him as enemies to\r\nbe punished, and all who have supported him as friends to be rewarded.\r\nBlind devotion to party, and to the head of a party, thus takes place of\r\nthe sentiment of generous patriotism and a high and exalted sense of\r\npublic duty.\r\n\r\nLet it not be said, Sir, that the danger from executive patronage cannot\r\nbe great, since the persons who hold office, or can hold office,\r\nconstitute so small a portion of the whole people.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is to be remembered that patronage acts, not only\r\non those who actually possess office, but on those also who expect it,\r\nor hope for it; and in the next place, office-holders, by their very\r\nsituation, their public station, their connection with the business of\r\nindividuals, their activity, their ability to help or to hurt according\r\nto their pleasure, their acquaintance with public affairs, and their\r\nzeal and devotion, exercise a degree of influence out of all proportion\r\nto their numbers.\r\n\r\nSir, we cannot disregard our own experience. We cannot shut our eyes to\r\nwhat is around us and upon us. No candid man can deny that a great, a\r\nvery great change has taken place, within a few years, in the practice\r\nof the executive government, which has produced a corresponding change\r\nin our political condition. No one can deny that office, of every kind,\r\nis now sought with extraordinary avidity, and that the condition, well\r\nunderstood to be attached to every officer, high or low, is\r\nindiscriminate support of executive measures and implicit obedience to\r\nexecutive will. For these reasons, Sir, I am for arresting the further\r\nprogress of this executive patronage, if we can arrest it; I am for\r\nstaying the further contagion of this plague.\r\n\r\nThe bill proposes two measures. One is to alter the duration of certain\r\noffices, now limited absolutely to four years; so that the limitation\r\nshall be qualified or conditional. If the officer is in default, if his\r\naccounts are not settled, if he retains or misapplies the public money,\r\ninformation is to be given thereof, and thereupon his commission is to\r\ncease. But if his accounts are all regularly settled, if he collects and\r\ndisburses the public money faithfully, then he is to remain in office,\r\nunless, for some other cause, the President sees fit to remove him. This\r\nis the provision of the bill. It applies only to certain enumerated\r\nofficers, who may be called accounting officers; that is to say,\r\nofficers who receive and disburse the public money. Formerly, all these\r\nofficers held their places at the pleasure of the President. If he saw\r\nno just cause for removing them, they continued in their situations, no\r\nfixed period being assigned for the expiration of their commissions. But\r\nthe act of 1820 limited the commissions of these officers to four years.\r\nAt the end of four years, they were to go out, without any removal,\r\nhowever well they might have conducted themselves, or however useful to\r\nthe public their further continuance in office might be. They might be\r\nnominated again, or might not; but their commissions expired.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I freely admit that considerable benefit has arisen from this\r\nlaw. I agree that it has, in some instances, secured promptitude,\r\ndiligence, and a sense of responsibility. These were the benefits which\r\nthose who passed the law expected from it; and these benefits have, in\r\nsome measure, been realized. But I think that this change in the tenure\r\nof office, together with some good, has brought along a far more than\r\nequivalent amount of evil. By the operation of this law, the President\r\ncan deprive a man of office without taking the responsibility of\r\nremoving him. The law itself vacates the office, and gives the means of\r\nrewarding a friend without the exercise of the power of removal at all.\r\nHere is increased power, with diminished responsibility. Here is a still\r\ngreater dependence, for the means of living, on executive favor, and, of\r\ncourse, a new dominion acquired over opinion and over conduct. The power\r\nof removal is, or at least formerly was, a suspected and odious power.\r\nPublic opinion would not always tolerate it; and still less frequently\r\ndid it approve it. Something of character, something of the respect of\r\nthe intelligent and patriotic part of the community, was lost by every\r\ninstance of its unnecessary exercise. This was some restraint. But the\r\nlaw of 1820 took it all away. It vacated offices periodically, by its\r\nown operation, and thus added to the power of removal, which it left\r\nstill existing in full force, a new and extraordinary facility for the\r\nextension of patronage, influence, and favoritism.\r\n\r\nI would ask every member of the Senate if he does not perceive, daily,\r\neffects which may be fairly traced to this cause. Does he not see a\r\nunion of purpose, a devotion to power, a co-operation in action, among\r\nall who hold office, quite unknown in the earlier periods of the\r\ngovernment? Does he not behold, every hour, a stronger development of\r\nthe principle of personal attachment, and a corresponding diminution of\r\ngenuine and generous public feeling? Was indiscriminate support of party\r\nmeasures, was unwavering fealty, was regular suit and service, ever\r\nbefore esteemed such important and essential parts of official duty?\r\n\r\nSir, the theory of our institutions is plain; it is, that government is\r\nan agency created for the good of the people, and that every person in\r\noffice is the agent and servant of the people. Offices are created, not\r\nfor the benefit of those who are to fill them, but for the public\r\nconvenience; and they ought to be no more in number, nor should higher\r\nsalaries be attached to them, than the public service requires. This is\r\nthe theory. But the difficulty in practice is, to prevent a direct\r\nreversal of all this; to prevent public offices from being considered as\r\nintended for the use and emolument of those who can obtain them. There\r\nis a headlong tendency to this, and it is necessary to restrain it by\r\nwise and effective legislation. There is still another, and perhaps a\r\ngreatly more mischievous result, of extensive patronage in the hands of\r\na single magistrate, to which I have already incidentally alluded; and\r\nthat is, that men in office have begun to think themselves mere agents\r\nand servants of the appointing power, and not agents of the government\r\nor the country. It is, in an especial manner, important, if it be\r\npracticable, to apply some corrective to this kind of feeling and\r\nopinion. It is necessary to bring back public officers to the\r\nconviction, that they belong to the country, and not to any\r\nadministration, nor to any one man. The army is the army of the country;\r\nthe navy is the navy of the country; neither of them is either the mere\r\ninstrument of the administration for the time being, nor of him who is\r\nat the head of it. The post-office, the land-office, the custom-house,\r\nare, in like manner, institutions of the country, established for the\r\ngood of the people: and it may well alarm the lovers of free\r\ninstitutions, when all the offices in these several departments are\r\nspoken of, in high places, as being but \"spoils of victory,\" to be\r\nenjoyed by those who are successful in a contest, in which they profess\r\nthis grasping of the spoils to have been the object of their efforts.\r\n\r\nThis part of the bill, therefore, Sir, is a subject for fair comparison.\r\nWe have gained something, doubtless, by limiting the commissions of\r\nthese officers to four years. But have we gained as much as we have\r\nlost? And may not the good be preserved, and the evil still avoided? Is\r\nit not enough to say, that if, at the end of four years, moneys are\r\nretained, accounts unsettled, or other duties unperformed, the office\r\nshall be held to be vacated, without any positive act of removal?\r\n\r\nFor one, I think the balance of advantage is decidedly in favor of the\r\npresent bill. I think it will make men more dependent on their own good\r\nconduct, and less dependent on the will of others. I believe it will\r\ncause them to regard their country more, their own duty more, and the\r\nfavor of individuals less. I think it will contribute to official\r\nrespectability, to freedom of opinion, to independence of character; and\r\nI think it will tend, in no small degree, to prevent the mixture of\r\nselfish and personal motives with the exercise of high political duties.\r\nIt will promote true and genuine republicanism, by causing the opinion\r\nof the people respecting the measures of government, and the men in\r\ngovernment, to be formed and expressed without fear or favor, and with a\r\nmore entire regard to their true and real merits or demerits. It will\r\nbe, so far as its effects reach, an auxiliary to patriotism and public\r\nvirtue, in their warfare against selfishness and cupidity.\r\n\r\nThe second check on executive patronage contained in this bill is of\r\nstill greater importance than the first. This provision is, that,\r\nwhenever the President removes any of these officers from office, he\r\nshall state to the Senate the reasons for such removal. This part of the\r\nbill has been opposed, both on constitutional grounds and on grounds of\r\nexpediency.\r\n\r\nThe bill, it is to be observed, expressly recognizes and admits the\r\nactual existence of the power of removal. I do not mean to deny, and the\r\nbill does not deny, that, at the present moment, the President may\r\nremove these officers at will, because the early decision adopted that\r\nconstruction, and the laws have since uniformly sanctioned it. The law\r\nof 1820, intended to be repealed by this bill, expressly affirms the\r\npower. I consider it, therefore, a settled point; settled by\r\nconstruction, settled by precedent, settled by the practice of the\r\ngovernment, and settled by statute. At the same time, after considering\r\nthe question again and again within the last six years, I am very\r\nwilling to say, that, in my deliberate judgment, the original decision\r\nwas wrong. I cannot but think that those who denied the power in 1789\r\nhad the best of the argument; and yet I will not say that I know myself\r\nso thoroughly as to affirm, that this opinion may not have been\r\nproduced, in some measure, by that abuse of the power which has been\r\npassing before our eyes for several years. It is possible that this\r\nexperience of the evil may have affected my view of the constitutional\r\nargument. It appears to me, however, after thorough and repeated and\r\nconscientious examination, that an erroneous interpretation was given to\r\nthe Constitution, in this respect, by the decision of the first\r\nCongress; and I will ask leave to state, shortly, the reasons for that\r\nopinion, although there is nothing in this bill which proposes to\r\ndisturb that decision.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution nowhere says one word of the power of removal from\r\noffice, except in the case of conviction on impeachment. Wherever the\r\npower exists, therefore, except in cases of impeachment, it must exist\r\nas a constructive or incidental power. If it exists in the President\r\nalone, it must exist in him because it is attached to something else, or\r\nincluded in something else, or results from something else, which is\r\ngranted to the President. There is certainly no specific grant; it is a\r\npower, therefore, the existence of which, if proved at all, is to be\r\nproved by inference and argument. In the only instance in which the\r\nConstitution speaks of removal from office, as I have already said, it\r\nspeaks of it as the exercise of _judicial_ power; that is to say, it\r\nspeaks of it as one part of the judgment of the Senate, in cases of\r\nconviction on impeachment. No other mention is made, in the whole\r\ninstrument, of any power of removal. Whence, then, is the power derived\r\nto the President?\r\n\r\nIt is usually said, by those who maintain its existence in the single\r\nhands of the President, that the power is derived from that clause of\r\nthe Constitution which says, \"The executive power shall be vested in a\r\nPresident.\" The power of removal, they argue, is, in its nature, an\r\nexecutive power; and, as the executive power is thus vested in the\r\nPresident, the power of removal is necessarily included.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that the Constitution declares that the executive power\r\nshall be vested in the President; but the first question which then\r\narises is, _What is executive power? What is the degree, and what are\r\nthe limitations?_ Executive power is not a thing so well known, and so\r\naccurately defined, as that the written constitution of a limited\r\ngovernment can be supposed to have conferred it in the lump. What _is_\r\nexecutive power? What are its boundaries? What model or example had the\r\nframers of the Constitution in their minds, when they spoke of\r\n\"executive power\"? Did they mean executive power as known in England, or\r\nas known in France, or as known in Russia? Did they take it as defined\r\nby Montesquieu, by Burlamaqui, or by De Lolme? All these differ from one\r\nanother as to the extent of the executive power of government. What,\r\nthen, was intended by \"the executive power\"? Now, Sir, I think it\r\nperfectly plain and manifest, that, although the framers of the\r\nConstitution meant to confer executive power on the President, yet they\r\nmeant to define and limit that power, and to confer no more than they\r\ndid thus define and limit. When they say it shall be vested in a\r\nPresident, they mean that one magistrate, to be called a President,\r\nshall hold the executive authority; but they mean, further, that he\r\nshall hold this authority according to the grants and limitations of the\r\nConstitution itself.\r\n\r\nThey did not intend, certainly, a sweeping gift of prerogative. They did\r\nnot intend to grant to the President whatever might be construed, or\r\nsupposed, or imagined to be executive power; and the proof that they\r\nmeant no such thing is, that, immediately after using these general\r\nwords, they proceed specifically to enumerate his several distinct and\r\nparticular authorities; to fix and define them; to give the Senate an\r\nessential control over the exercise of some of them, and to leave others\r\nuncontrolled. By the executive power conferred on the President, the\r\nConstitution means no more than that portion which itself creates, and\r\nwhich it qualifies, limits, and circumscribes.\r\n\r\nA general survey of the frame of the Constitution will satisfy us of\r\nthis. That instrument goes all along upon the idea of dividing the\r\npowers of government, so far as practicable, into three great\r\ndepartments. It describes the powers and duties of these departments in\r\nan article allotted to each. As first in importance and dignity, it\r\nbegins with the legislative department. The first article of the\r\nConstitution, therefore, commences with the declaration, that \"all\r\nlegislative power herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the\r\nUnited States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives,\" The article goes on to prescribe the manner in which\r\nCongress is to be constituted and organized, _and then proceeds to\r\nenumerate, specifically, the powers intended to be granted_; and adds\r\nthe general clause, conferring such authority as may be necessary to\r\ncarry granted powers into effect. Now, Sir, no man doubts that this is a\r\nlimited legislature; that it possesses no powers but such as are granted\r\nby express words or necessary implication; and that it would be quite\r\npreposterous to insist that Congress possesses any particular\r\nlegislative power, merely because it is, in its nature, a legislative\r\nbody, if no grant can be found for it in the Constitution itself.\r\n\r\nThen comes, Sir, the second article, creating an executive power; and it\r\ndeclares, that \"the executive power shall be vested in a President of\r\nthe United States.\" After providing for the mode of choosing him, it\r\nimmediately proceeds to enumerate, specifically, the powers which he\r\nshall possess and exercise, and the duties which he shall perform. I\r\nconsider the language of this article, therefore, precisely analogous to\r\nthat in which the legislature is created; that is to say, I understand\r\nthe Constitution as saying that \"the executive power _herein granted_\r\nshall be vested in a President of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the third article, or that which is intended to arrange\r\nthe judicial system, begins by declaring that \"the judicial power of the\r\nUnited States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior\r\ncourts as the Congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish.\"\r\nBut these general words do not show _what extent_ of judicial power is\r\nvested in the courts of the United States. All that is left to be done,\r\nand is done, in the following sections, by express and well-guarded\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\nI think, therefore, Sir, that very great caution is to be used, and the\r\nground well considered, before we admit that the President derives any\r\ndistinct and specific power from those general words which vest the\r\nexecutive authority in him. The Constitution itself does not rest\r\nsatisfied with these general words. It immediately goes into\r\nparticulars, and carefully enumerates the several authorities which the\r\nPresident shall possess. The very first of the enumerated powers is the\r\ncommand of the army and navy. This, most certainly, is an executive\r\npower. And why is it particularly set down and expressed, if any power\r\nwas intended to be granted under the general words? This would pass, if\r\nany thing would pass, under those words. But enumeration, specification,\r\nparticularization, was evidently the design of the framers of the\r\nConstitution, in this as in other parts of it. I do not, therefore,\r\nregard the declaration that the executive power shall be vested in a\r\nPresident as being any grant at all; any more than the declaration that\r\nthe legislative power shall be vested in Congress constitutes, by\r\nitself, a grant of such power. In the one case, as in the other, I think\r\nthe object was to describe and denominate the department, which should\r\nhold, respectively, the legislative and the executive authority; very\r\nmuch as we see, in some of the State constitutions, that the several\r\narticles are headed with the titles \"legislative power,\" \"executive\r\npower,\" \"judicial power\"; and this entitling of the articles with the\r\nname of the power has never been supposed, of itself, to confer any\r\nauthority whatever. It amounts to no more than naming the departments.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the power of removal be admitted to be an executive power,\r\nstill it must be sought for and found among the enumerated executive\r\npowers, or fairly implied from some one or more of them. It cannot be\r\nimplied from the general words. The power of appointment was not left to\r\nbe so implied; why, then, should the power of removal have been so left?\r\nThey are both closely connected; one is indispensable to the other; why,\r\nthen, was one carefully expressed, defined, and limited, and not one\r\nword said about the other? Sir, I think the whole matter is sufficiently\r\nplain. Nothing is said in the Constitution about the power of removal,\r\nbecause it is not a separate and distinct power. It is part of the power\r\nof appointment, naturally going with it or necessarily resulting from\r\nit. The Constitution or the laws may separate these powers, it is true,\r\nin a particular case, as is done in respect to the judges, who, though\r\nappointed by the President and Senate, cannot be removed at the pleasure\r\nof either or of both. So a statute, in prescribing the tenure of any\r\nother office, may place the officer beyond the reach of the appointing\r\npower. But where no other tenure is prescribed, and officers hold their\r\nplaces at will, that will is necessarily the will of the appointing\r\npower; because the exercise of the power of appointment at once\r\ndisplaces such officers. The power of placing one man in office\r\nnecessarily implies the power of turning another out. If one man be\r\nSecretary of State, and another be appointed, the first goes out by the\r\nmere force of the appointment of the other, without any previous act of\r\nremoval whatever. And this is the practice of the government, and has\r\nbeen, from the first. In all the removals which have been made, they\r\nhave generally been effected simply by making other appointments. I\r\ncannot find a case to the contrary. There is no such thing as any\r\ndistinct official act of removal. I have looked into the practice, and\r\ncaused inquiries to be made in the departments, and I do not learn that\r\nany such proceeding is known as an entry or record of the removal of an\r\nofficer from office; and the President could only act, in such cases, by\r\ncausing some proper record or entry to be made, as proof of the fact of\r\nremoval. I am aware that there have been some cases in which notice has\r\nbeen sent to persons in office that their services are, or will be,\r\nafter a given day, dispensed with. These are usually cases in which the\r\nobject is, not to inform the incumbent that he is _removed_, but to tell\r\nhim that a successor either is, or by a day named will be, appointed. If\r\nthere be any instances in which such notice is given without express\r\nreference to the appointment of a successor, they are few; and even in\r\nthese, such reference must be implied; because in no case is there any\r\ndistinct official act of removal, that I can find, unconnected with the\r\nact of appointment. At any rate, it is the usual practice, and has been\r\nfrom the first, to consider the appointment as producing the removal of\r\nthe previous incumbent. When the President desires to remove a person\r\nfrom office, he sends a message to the Senate nominating some other\r\nperson. The message usually runs in this form: \"I nominate A.B. to be\r\ncollector of the customs, &c., in the place of C.D., removed.\" If the\r\nSenate advise and consent to this nomination, C.D. is effectually out of\r\noffice, and A.B. is in, in his place. The same effect would be produced,\r\nif the message should say nothing of any removal. Suppose A.B. to be\r\nSecretary of State, and the President to send us a message, saying\r\nmerely, \"I nominate C.D. to be Secretary of State.\" If we confirm this\r\nnomination, C.D. becomes Secretary of State, and A.B. is necessarily\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nI have gone into these details and particulars, Sir, for the purpose of\r\nshowing, that, not only in the nature of things, but also according to\r\nthe practice of the government, the power of removal is incident to the\r\npower of appointment. It belongs to it, is attached to it, forms a part\r\nof it, or results from it.\r\n\r\nIf this be true, the inference is manifest. If the power of removal,\r\nwhen not otherwise regulated by Constitution or law, be part and parcel\r\nof the power of appointment, or a necessary incident to it, then whoever\r\nholds the power of appointment holds also the power of removal. But it\r\nis the President and the Senate, and not the President alone, who hold\r\nthe power of appointment; and therefore, according to the true\r\nconstruction of the Constitution, it should be the President and Senate,\r\nand not the President alone, who hold the power of removal.\r\n\r\nThe decision of 1789 has been followed by a very strange and\r\nindefensible anomaly, showing that it does not rest on any just\r\nprinciple. The natural connection between the appointing power and the\r\nremoving power has, as I have already stated, always led the President\r\nto bring about a removal by the process of a new appointment. This is\r\nquite efficient for his purpose, when the Senate confirms the new\r\nnomination. One man is then turned out, and another put in. But the\r\nSenate sometimes _rejects_ the new nomination; and what then becomes of\r\nthe old incumbent? Is he out of office, or is he still in? He has not\r\nbeen turned out by any exercise of the power of appointment, for no\r\nappointment has been made. That power has not been exercised. He has not\r\nbeen removed by any distinct and separate act of removal, for no such\r\nact has been performed, or attempted. Is he still in, then, or is he\r\nout? Where is he? In this dilemma, Sir, those who maintain the power of\r\nremoval as existing in the President alone are driven to what seems to\r\nme very near absurdity. The incumbent has not been removed by the\r\nappointing power, since the appointing power has not been exercised. He\r\nhas not been removed by any distinct and independent act of removal,\r\nsince no such act has been performed.\r\n\r\nThey are forced to the necessity, therefore, of contending that the\r\nremoval has been accomplished by the mere _nomination_ of a successor;\r\nso that the removing power is made incident, not to the appointing\r\npower, but to one part of it; that is, to the _nominating_ power. The\r\nnomination, not having been assented to by the Senate, it is clear, has\r\nfailed, as the first step in the process of appointment. But though thus\r\nrendered null and void in its main object, as the first process in\r\nmaking an appointment, it is held to be good and valid, nevertheless, to\r\nbring about that which _results from an appointment_; that is, the\r\nremoval of the person actually in office. In other words, the nomination\r\nproduces the consequences of an appointment, or some of them, though it\r\nbe itself no appointment, and effect no appointment. This, Sir, appears\r\nto me to be any thing but sound reasoning and just construction.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. The President has sometimes sent us a nomination to\r\nan office already filled, and, before we have acted upon it, has seen\r\nfit to withdraw it. What is the effect of such a nomination? If a\r\n_nomination_, merely as such, turns out the present incumbent, then he\r\nis out, let what will become afterwards of the nomination. But I believe\r\nthe President has acted upon the idea that a nomination made, and at any\r\ntime afterwards withdrawn, does _not_ remove the actual incumbent.\r\n\r\nSir, even this is not the end of the inconsistencies into which the\r\nprevailing doctrine has led. There have been cases in which nominations\r\nto offices already filled have come to the Senate, remained here for\r\nweeks, or months, the incumbents all the while continuing to discharge\r\ntheir official duties, and relinquishing their offices only when the\r\nnominations of their successors have been confirmed, and commissions\r\nissued to them; so that, if a nomination be confirmed, the _nomination\r\nitself_ makes no removal; the removal then waits to be brought about by\r\nthe _appointment_. But if the nomination be _rejected_, then the\r\n_nomination itself_, it is contended, has effected the removal. Who can\r\ndefend opinions which lead to such results?\r\n\r\nThese reasons, Sir, incline me strongly to the opinion, that, upon a\r\njust construction of the Constitution, the power of removal is part of,\r\nor a necessary result from, the power of appointment, and, therefore,\r\nthat it _ought to have been_ exercised by the Senate concurrently with\r\nthe President.\r\n\r\nThe argument may be strengthened by various illustrations. The\r\nConstitution declares that Congress may vest the appointment of\r\ninferior officers in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in\r\nthe heads of departments; and Congress has passed various acts providing\r\nfor appointments, according to this regulation of the Constitution. Thus\r\nthe Supreme Court, and other courts of the United States, have authority\r\nto appoint their clerks; heads of departments also appoint their own\r\nclerks, according to statute provisions; and it has never been doubted\r\nthat these courts, and these heads of departments, may remove their\r\nclerks at pleasure, although nothing is said in the laws respecting such\r\npower of removal. Now, it is evident that neither the courts nor the\r\nheads of departments acquire the right of removal under a general grant\r\nof executive power, for none such is made to them; nor upon the ground\r\nof any general injunction to see the laws executed, for no such general\r\ninjunction is addressed to them. They nevertheless hold the power of\r\nremoval, as all admit, and they must hold it, therefore, simply as\r\nincident to, or belonging to, the power of appointment. There is no\r\nother clause under which they can possibly claim it.\r\n\r\nAgain, let us suppose that the Constitution had given to the President\r\nthe power of appointment, without consulting the Senate. Suppose it had\r\nsaid, \"The President shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers,\r\njudges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United\r\nStates.\" If the Constitution had stood thus, the President would\r\nunquestionably have possessed the power of removal, where the tenure of\r\noffice was not fixed; and no man, I imagine, would in that case have\r\nlooked for the removing power either in that clause which says the\r\nexecutive authority shall be vested in the President, or in that other\r\nclause which makes it his duty to see the laws faithfully executed.\r\nEverybody would have said, \"The President possesses an uncontrolled\r\npower of appointment, and that necessarily carries with it an\r\nuncontrolled power of removal, unless some permanent tenure be given to\r\nthe office by the Constitution, or by law.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, let me state, and examine, the main argument, on which the\r\ndecision of 1789 appears to rest it.\r\n\r\nThe most plausible reasoning brought forward on that occasion may be\r\nfairly stated thus: \"The executive power is vested in the President;\r\nthis is the general rule of the Constitution. The association of the\r\nSenate with the President in exercising a particular function belonging\r\nto the executive power, is an exception to this general rule, and\r\nexceptions to general rules are to be taken strictly; therefore, though\r\nthe Senate partakes of the appointing power, by express provision, yet,\r\nas nothing is said of its participation in the removing power, such\r\nparticipation is to be excluded.\"\r\n\r\nThe error of this argument, if I may venture to call it so, considering\r\nwho used it,[1] lies in this. It supposes the power of removal to be\r\nheld by the President under the general grant of executive power. Now,\r\nit is certain that the power of appointment is not held under that\r\ngeneral grant, because it is particularly provided for, and is\r\nconferred, in express terms, on the President and Senate. If, therefore,\r\nthe power of removal be a natural appendage to the power of appointment,\r\nthen it is not conferred by the general words granting executive power\r\nto the President, but is conferred by the special clause which gives the\r\nappointing power to the President and Senate. So that the spirit of the\r\nvery rule on which the argument of 1789, as I have stated it, relies,\r\nappears to me to produce a directly opposite result; for, if exceptions\r\nto a general rule are to be taken strictly, when expressed, it is still\r\nmore clear, when they are not expressed at all, that they are not to be\r\nimplied except on evident and clear grounds; and as the general power of\r\nappointment is confessedly given to the President and Senate, no\r\nexception is to be implied in favor of one part of that general power,\r\nnamely, the removing part, unless for some obvious and irresistible\r\nreason. In other words, this argument which I am answering is not sound\r\nin its premises, and therefore not sound in its conclusion, if the grant\r\nof the power of appointment does naturally include also the power of\r\nremoval, when this last power is not otherwise expressly provided for;\r\nbecause, if the power of removal belongs to the power of appointment, or\r\nnecessarily follows it, then it has gone with it into the hands of the\r\nPresident and Senate; and the President does not hold it alone, as an\r\nimplication or inference from the grant to him of general executive\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nThe true application of that rule of construction, thus relied on, would\r\npresent the argument, I think, in this form: \"The appointing power is\r\nvested in the President and Senate; this is the general rule of the\r\nConstitution. The removing power is part of the appointing power; it\r\ncannot be separated from the rest, but by supposing that an exception\r\nwas intended; but all exceptions to general rules are to be taken\r\nstrictly, even when expressed; and, for a much stronger reason, they are\r\nnot to be implied, when not expressed, unless inevitable necessity of\r\nconstruction requires it.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Sir, with the diffidence which becomes one who is\r\nreviewing the opinions of some of the ablest and wisest men of the age,\r\nI must still express my own conviction, that the decision of Congress in\r\n1789, which separated the power of removal from the power of\r\nappointment, was founded on an erroneous construction of the\r\nConstitution, and that it has led to great inconsistencies, as well as\r\nto great abuses, in the subsequent, and especially in the more recent,\r\nhistory of the government.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said now, and much was said formerly, about the\r\ninconvenience of denying this power to the President alone. I agree that\r\nan argument drawn from this source may have weight, in a doubtful case;\r\nbut it is not to be permitted that we shall presume the existence of a\r\npower merely because we think it would be convenient. Nor is there, I\r\nthink, any such glaring, striking, or certain inconvenience as has been\r\nsuggested. Sudden removals from office are seldom necessary; we see how\r\nseldom, by reference to the practice of the government under all\r\nadministrations which preceded the present. And if we look back over the\r\nremovals which have been made in the last six years, there is no man who\r\ncan maintain that there is one case in a hundred in which the country\r\nwould have suffered the least inconvenience if no removal had been made\r\nwithout the consent of the Senate. Party might have felt the\r\ninconvenience, but the country never. Many removals have been made (by\r\nnew appointments) during the session of the Senate; and if there has\r\noccurred one single case, in the whole six years, in which the public\r\nconvenience required the removal of an officer in the recess, such case\r\nhas escaped my recollection. Besides, it is worthy of being remembered,\r\nwhen we are seeking for the true intent of the Constitution on this\r\nsubject, that there is reason to suppose that its framers expected the\r\nSenate would be in session a much larger part of the year than the House\r\nof Representatives, so that its concurrence could generally be had, at\r\nonce, on any question of appointment or removal.\r\n\r\nBut this argument, drawn from the supposed inconvenience of denying an\r\nabsolute power of removal to the President, suggests still another view\r\nof the question. The argument asserts, that it must have been the\r\nintention of the framers of the Constitution to confer the power on the\r\nPresident, for the sake of convenience, and as an absolutely necessary\r\npower in his hands. Why, then, did they leave their intent doubtful?\r\n_Why did they not confer the power in express terms?_ Why were they thus\r\ntotally silent on a point of so much importance?\r\n\r\nSeeing that the removing power naturally belongs to the appointing\r\npower; seeing that, in other cases, in the same Constitution, its\r\nframers have left the one with the consequence of drawing the other\r\nafter it,--if, in this instance, they meant to do what was uncommon and\r\nextraordinary, that, is to say, if they meant to separate and divorce\r\nthe two powers, why did they not say so? Why did they not express their\r\nmeaning in plain words? Why should they take up the appointing power,\r\nand carefully define it, limit it, and restrain it, and yet leave to\r\nvague inference and loose construction an equally important power, which\r\nall must admit to be closely connected with it, if not a part of it? If\r\nothers can account for all this silence respecting the removing power,\r\nupon any other ground than that the framers of the Constitution regarded\r\nboth powers as one, and supposed they had provided for them together, I\r\nconfess I cannot. I have the clearest conviction, that they looked to no\r\nother mode of displacing an officer than by impeachment, or by the\r\nregular appointment of another person to the same place.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, whether the decision of 1789 were right or wrong, the bill\r\nbefore us applies to the actually existing state of things. It\r\nrecognizes the President's power of removal, in express terms, as it has\r\nbeen practically exercised, independently of the Senate. The present\r\nbill does not disturb the power; but I wish it not to be understood that\r\nthe power is, even now, beyond the reach of legislation. I believe it to\r\nbe within the just power of Congress to reverse the decision of 1789,\r\nand I mean to hold myself at liberty to act, hereafter, upon that\r\nquestion, as I shall think the safety of the government and of the\r\nConstitution may require. The present bill, however, proceeds upon the\r\nadmission that the power does at present exist. Its words are:--\r\n\r\n\"Sec. 3. _And be it further enacted_, That, in all nominations made by\r\nthe President to the Senate, to fill vacancies occasioned by the\r\nexercise of the President's power to remove the said officers mentioned\r\nin the second section of this act, the fact of the removal shall be\r\nstated to the Senate, at the same time that the nomination is made, with\r\na statement of the reasons for which such officer may have been\r\nremoved.\"\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this provision is entirely constitutional, and highly\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of the tenure of office is a common exercise of\r\nlegislative authority, and the power of Congress in this particular is\r\nnot at all restrained or limited by any thing contained in the\r\nConstitution, except in regard to judicial officers. All the rest is\r\nleft to the ordinary discretion of the legislature. Congress may give to\r\noffices which it creates (except those of judges) what duration it\r\npleases. When the office is created, and is to be filled, the President\r\nis to nominate the candidate to fill it; but when he comes into the\r\noffice, he comes into it upon the conditions and restrictions which the\r\nlaw may have attached to it. If Congress were to declare by law that the\r\nAttorney-General, or the Secretary of State, should hold his office\r\nduring good behavior, I am not aware of any ground on which such a law\r\ncould be held unconstitutional. A provision of that kind in regard to\r\nsuch officers might be unwise, but I do not perceive that it would\r\ntranscend the power of Congress.\r\n\r\nIf the Constitution had not prescribed the tenure of judicial office,\r\nCongress might have thought it expedient to give the judges just such a\r\ntenure as the Constitution has itself provided; that is to say, a right\r\nto hold during good behavior; and I am of opinion that such a law would\r\nhave been perfectly constitutional. It is by law, in England, that the\r\njudges are made independent of the removing power of the crown. I do not\r\nthink that the Constitution, by giving the power of appointment, or the\r\npower both of appointment and removal, to the President and Senate,\r\nintended to impose any restraint on the legislature, in regard to its\r\nauthority of regulating the duties, powers, duration, or responsibility\r\nof office. I agree, that Congress ought not to do any thing which shall\r\nessentially impair that right of nomination and appointment of certain\r\nofficers, such as ministers, judges, &c., which the Constitution has\r\nvested in the President and Senate. But while the power of nomination\r\nand appointment is left fairly where the Constitution has placed it, I\r\nthink the whole field of regulation is open to legislative discretion.\r\nIf a law were to pass, declaring that district attorneys, or collectors\r\nof customs, should hold their offices four years, unless removed on\r\nconviction for misbehavior, no one could doubt its constitutional\r\nvalidity; because the legislature is naturally competent to prescribe\r\nthe tenure of office. And is a reasonable check on the power of removal\r\nany thing more than a qualification of the tenure of office? Let it be\r\nalways remembered, that the President's removing power, as now\r\nexercised, is claimed and held under the general clause vesting in him\r\nthe executive authority. It is implied, or inferred, from that clause\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nNow, if it is properly derived from that source, since the Constitution\r\ndoes not say how it shall be limited, how defined, or how carried into\r\neffect, it seems especially proper for Congress, under the general\r\nprovision of the Constitution which gives it authority to pass all laws\r\nnecessary to carry into effect the powers conferred on any department,\r\nto regulate the subject of removal. And the regulation here required is\r\nof the gentlest kind. It only provides that the President shall make\r\nknown to the Senate his reasons for removal of officers of this\r\ndescription, when he does see fit to remove them. It might, I think,\r\nvery justly go farther. It might, and perhaps it ought, to prescribe the\r\nform of removal, and the proof of the fact. It might, I also think,\r\ndeclare that the President should only suspend officers, at pleasure,\r\ntill the next meeting of the Senate, according to the amendment\r\nsuggested by the honorable member from Kentucky; and, if the present\r\npractice cannot be otherwise checked, this provision, in my opinion,\r\nought hereafter to be adopted. But I am content with the slightest\r\ndegree of restraint which may be sufficient to arrest the totally\r\nunnecessary, unreasonable, and dangerous exercise of the power of\r\nremoval. I desire only, for the present at least, that, when the\r\nPresident turns a man out of office, he should give his reasons for it\r\nto the Senate, when he nominates another person to fill the place. Let\r\nhim give these reasons, and stand on them. If they are fair and honest,\r\nhe need have no fear in stating them. It is not to invite any trial; it\r\nis not to give the removed officer an opportunity of defence; it is not\r\nto excite controversy and debate; it is simply that the Senate, and\r\nultimately the public, may know the grounds of removal. I deem this\r\ndegree of regulation, at least, necessary; unless we are willing to\r\nsubmit all these officers to an absolute and a perfectly irresponsible\r\nremoving power; a power which, as recently exercised, tends to turn the\r\nwhole body of public officers into partisans, dependants, favorites,\r\nsycophants, and man-worshippers.\r\n\r\nMr. President, without pursuing the discussion further, I will detain\r\nthe Senate only while I recapitulate the opinions which I have\r\nexpressed; because I am far less desirous of influencing the judgment of\r\nothers, than of making clear the grounds of my own judgment.\r\n\r\nI think, then, Sir, that the power of appointment naturally and\r\nnecessarily includes the power of removal where no limitation is\r\nexpressed, nor any tenure but that at will declared. The power of\r\nappointment being conferred on the President _and Senate_, I think the\r\npower of removal went along with it, and should have been regarded as a\r\npart of it, and exercised by the same hands. I think, consequently, that\r\nthe decision of 1789, which _implied_ a power of removal separate from\r\nthe appointing power, was erroneous.\r\n\r\nBut I think the decision of 1789 has been established by practice, and\r\nrecognized by subsequent laws, as the settled construction of the\r\nConstitution, and that it is our duty to act upon the case accordingly,\r\nfor the present; without admitting that Congress may not, hereafter, if\r\nnecessity shall require it, reverse the decision of 1789. I think the\r\nlegislature possesses the power of regulating the condition, duration,\r\nqualification, and tenure of office, in all cases where the Constitution\r\nhas made no express provision on the subject.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, of opinion, that it is competent for Congress to\r\ndeclare by law, as one qualification of the tenure of office, that the\r\nincumbent shall remain in place till the President shall remove him, for\r\nreasons to be stated to the Senate. And I am of opinion that this\r\nqualification, mild and gentle as it is, will have _some_ effect in\r\narresting the evils which beset the progress of the government, and\r\nseriously threaten its future prosperity.\r\n\r\nThese are the reasons for which I give my support to this bill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThis speech is singular among the speeches of Mr. Webster, as it\r\nexhibits him as a \"Strict-Constructionist,\" and as a master of that\r\npeculiar kind of deductive reasoning which is commonly considered the\r\nspecial distinction of his great antagonist, Mr. Calhoun. In subtilty\r\nand refinement of argument it is fully the match of most of Mr.\r\nCalhoun's elaborate disquisitions. At the time of its delivery it\r\nexcited the almost savage ire of John Quincy Adams, as will be seen by\r\nreference to the latter's \"Diary.\" It was in connection with this speech\r\nthat Mr. Adams speaks of \"the rotten heart of Daniel Webster.\" How such\r\na purely intellectual feat as this, one so entirely passionless and\r\nimpersonal, should be referred to rottenness of heart, is one of the\r\nunexplained mysteries of the operations of Mr. Adams's understanding,\r\nwhen that understanding was misled by personal antipathy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Madison. See the discussion in Gales and Seaton's\r\nDebates in Congress, Vol. I. p. 473 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE LOSS OF THE FORTIFICATION BILL IN 1835.\r\n\r\nA SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, ON THE 14TH OF\r\nJANUARY, 1836, ON MR. BENTON'S RESOLUTIONS FOR APPROPRIATING THE SURPLUS\r\nREVENUE TO NATIONAL DEFENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose, Mr. President, to make any remark on the state of\r\nour affairs with France. The time for that discussion has not come, and\r\nI wait. We are in daily expectation of a communication from the\r\nPresident, which will give us light; and we are authorized to expect a\r\nrecommendation by him of such measures as he thinks it may be necessary\r\nand proper for Congress to adopt. I do not anticipate him. In this most\r\nimportant and delicate business, it is the proper duty of the executive\r\nto go forward, and I, for one, do not intend either to be drawn or\r\ndriven into the lead. When official information shall be before us, and\r\nwhen measures shall be recommended upon the proper responsibility, I\r\nshall endeavor to form the best judgment I can, and shall act according\r\nto its dictates.\r\n\r\nI rise, now, for another purpose. This resolution has drawn on a debate\r\nupon the general conduct of the Senate during the last session of\r\nCongress, and especially in regard to the proposed grant of the three\r\nmillions to the President on the last night of the session. My main\r\nobject is to tell the story of this transaction, and to exhibit the\r\nconduct of the Senate fairly to the public view. I owe this duty to the\r\nSenate. I owe it to the committee with which I am connected; and\r\nalthough whatever is personal to an individual is generally of too\r\nlittle importance to be made the subject of much remark, I hope I may be\r\npermitted to say a few words in defence of my own reputation, in\r\nreference to a matter which has been greatly misrepresented.\r\n\r\nThis vote for the three millions was proposed by the House of\r\nRepresentatives as an amendment to the fortification bill; and the loss\r\nof that bill, three millions and all, is the charge which has been made\r\nupon the Senate, sounded over all the land, and now again renewed. I\r\npropose to give the true history of this bill, its origin, its progress,\r\nand its loss.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting that, however, let me remark, for it is worthy to be\r\nremarked and remembered, that the business brought before the Senate\r\nlast session, important and various as it was, and both public and\r\nprivate, was all gone through with most uncommon despatch and\r\npromptitude. No session has witnessed a more complete clearing off and\r\nfinishing of the subjects before us. The communications from the other\r\nhouse, whether bills or whatever else, were especially attended to in a\r\nproper season, and with that ready respect which is due from one house\r\nto the other. I recollect nothing of any importance which came to us\r\nfrom the House of Representatives, which was neglected, overlooked, or\r\ndisregarded by the Senate.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was the misfortune of the Senate, and, as I think,\r\nthe misfortune of the country, that, owing to the state of business in\r\nthe House of Representatives towards the close of the session, several\r\nmeasures which had been matured in the Senate, and passed into bills,\r\ndid not receive attention, so as to be either agreed to or rejected, in\r\nthe other branch of the legislature. They fell, of course, by the\r\ntermination of the session.\r\n\r\nAmong these measures may be mentioned the following, viz.:--\r\n\r\nTHE POST-OFFICE REFORM BILL, which passed the Senate _unanimously_, and\r\nof the necessity for which the whole country is certainly now most\r\nabundantly satisfied;\r\n\r\nTHE CUSTOM-HOUSE REGULATIONS BILL, which also passed nearly unanimously,\r\nafter a very laborious preparation by the Committee on Commerce, and a\r\nfull discussion in the Senate;\r\n\r\nTHE JUDICIARY BILL, passed here by a majority of thirty-one to five, and\r\nwhich has again already passed the Senate at this session with only a\r\nsingle dissenting vote;\r\n\r\nTHE BILL INDEMNIFYING CLAIMANTS FOR FRENCH SPOLIATIONS BEFORE 1800;\r\n\r\nTHE BILL REGULATING THE DEPOSIT OF THE PUBLIC MONEY IN THE DEPOSIT\r\nBANKS;\r\n\r\nTHE BILL RESPECTING THE TENURE OF CERTAIN OFFICES, AND THE POWER OF\r\nREMOVAL FROM OFFICE; which has now again been passed to be engrossed, in\r\nthe Senate, by a decided majority.\r\n\r\nAll these important measures, matured and passed in the Senate in the\r\ncourse of the session, and many others of less importance, were sent to\r\nthe House of Representatives, and we never heard any thing more from\r\nthem. They there found their graves.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of being remarked, also, that the attendance of members of\r\nthe Senate was remarkably full, particularly toward the end of the\r\nsession. On the last day, every Senator was in his place till very near\r\nthe hour of adjournment, as the journal will show. We had no breaking up\r\nfor want of a quorum; no delay, no calls of the Senate; nothing which\r\nwas made necessary by the negligence or inattention of the members of\r\nthis body. On the vote of the three millions of dollars, which was taken\r\nat about eight o'clock in the evening, forty-eight votes were given,\r\nevery member of the Senate being in his place and answering to his name.\r\nThis is an instance of punctuality, diligence, and labor, continued to\r\nthe very end of an arduous session, wholly without example or parallel.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, then, Sir, must stand, in the judgment of every man, fully\r\nacquitted of all remissness, all negligence, all inattention, amidst the\r\nfatigue and exhaustion of the closing hours of Congress. Nothing passed\r\nunheeded, nothing was overlooked, nothing forgotten, and nothing\r\nslighted.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, I would proceed immediately to give the history of the\r\nfortification bill, if it were not necessary, as introductory to that\r\nhistory, and as showing the circumstances under which the Senate was\r\ncalled on to transact the public business, first to refer to another\r\nbill which was before us, and to the proceedings which were had upon it.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, Sir, that the annual appropriation bills always\r\noriginate in the House of Representatives. This is so much a matter of\r\ncourse, that no one ever looks to see such a bill first brought forward\r\nin the Senate. It is also well known, Sir, that it has been usual,\r\nheretofore, to make the annual appropriations for the Military Academy\r\nat West Point in the general bill which provides for the pay and support\r\nof the army. But last year the army bill did not contain any\r\nappropriation whatever for the support of West Point. I took notice of\r\nthis singular omission when the bill was before the Senate, but\r\npresumed, and indeed understood, that the House would send us a separate\r\nbill for the Military Academy. The army bill, therefore, passed; but no\r\nbill for the Academy at West Point appeared. We waited for it from day\r\nto day, and from week to week, but waited in vain. At length, the time\r\nfor sending bills from one house to the other, according to the joint\r\nrules of the two houses, expired, and no bill had made its appearance\r\nfor the support of the Military Academy. These joint rules, as is well\r\nknown, are sometimes suspended on the application of one house to the\r\nother, in favor of particular bills, whose progress has been\r\nunexpectedly delayed, but which the public interest requires to be\r\npassed. But the House of Representatives sent us no request to suspend\r\nthe rules in favor of a bill for the support of the Military Academy,\r\nnor made any other proposition to save the institution from immediate\r\ndissolution. Notwithstanding all the talk about a war, and the necessity\r\nof a vote for the three millions, the Military Academy, an institution\r\ncherished so long, and at so much expense, was on the very point of\r\nbeing entirely broken up.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened, Sir, that at this time there was another\r\nappropriation bill which had come from the House of Representatives, and\r\nwas before the Committee on Finance here. This bill was entitled \"An Act\r\nmaking appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of the\r\ngovernment for the year 1835.\"\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, several members of the House of Representatives\r\napplied to the committee, and besought us to save the Military Academy\r\nby annexing the necessary appropriations for its support to the bill for\r\ncivil and diplomatic service. We spoke to them, in reply, of the\r\nunfitness, the irregularity, the incongruity, of this forced union of\r\nsuch dissimilar subjects; but they told us it was a case of absolute\r\nnecessity, and that, without resorting to this mode, the appropriation\r\ncould not get through. We acquiesced, Sir, in these suggestions. We went\r\nout of our way. We agreed to do an extraordinary and an irregular thing,\r\nin order to save the public business from miscarriage. By direction of\r\nthe committee, I moved the Senate to add an appropriation for the\r\nMilitary Academy to the bill for defraying civil and diplomatic\r\nexpenses. The bill was so amended; and in this form the appropriation\r\nwas finally made.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. This bill for the civil and diplomatic service,\r\nbeing thus amended by tacking the Military Academy to it, was sent back\r\nby us to the House of Representatives, where its length of tail was to\r\nbe still much further increased. That house had before it several\r\nsubjects for provision, and for appropriation, upon which it had not\r\npassed any bill before the time for passing bills to be sent to the\r\nSenate had elapsed. I was anxious that these things should, in some way,\r\nbe provided for; and when the diplomatic bill came back, drawing the\r\nMilitary Academy after it, it was thought prudent to attach to it\r\nseveral of these other provisions. There were propositions to pave the\r\nstreets in the city of Washington, to repair the Capitol, and various\r\nother things, which it was necessary to provide for; and they,\r\ntherefore, were put into the same bill, by way of amendment to an\r\namendment; that is to say, Mr. President, we had been prevailed on to\r\namend their bill for defraying the salary of our ministers abroad, by\r\nadding an appropriation for the Military Academy, and they proposed to\r\namend this our amendment by adding matter as germane to it as it was\r\nitself to the original bill. There was also the President's gardener.\r\nHis salary was unprovided for; and there was no way of remedying this\r\nimportant omission, but by giving him place in the diplomatic service\r\nbill, among _chargés d'affaires_, envoys extraordinary, and ministers\r\nplenipotentiary. In and among these ranks, therefore, he was formally\r\nintroduced by the amendment of the House, and there he now stands, as\r\nyou will readily see by turning to the law.\r\n\r\nSir, I have not the pleasure to know this useful person; but should I\r\nsee him, some morning, overlooking the workmen in the lawns, walks,\r\ncopses, and parterres which adorn the grounds around the President's\r\nresidence, considering the company into which we have introduced him, I\r\nshould expect to see, at least, a small diplomatic button on his working\r\njacket.\r\n\r\nWhen these amendments came from the House, and were read at our table,\r\nthough they caused a smile, they were yet adopted, and the law passed,\r\nalmost with the rapidity of a comet, and with something like the same\r\nlength of tail.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, not one of these irregularities or incongruities, no part of\r\nthis jumbling together of distinct and different subjects, was in the\r\nslightest degree occasioned by any thing done, or omitted to be done, on\r\nthe part of the Senate. Their proceedings were all regular; their\r\ndecision was prompt, their despatch of the public business correct and\r\nreasonable. There was nothing of disorganization, nothing of\r\nprocrastination, nothing evincive of a temper to embarrass or obstruct\r\nthe public business. If the history which I have now truly given shows\r\nthat one thing was amended by another, which had no sort of connection\r\nwith it; that unusual expedients were resorted to; and that the laws,\r\ninstead of arrangement and symmetry, exhibit anomaly, confusion, and the\r\nmost grotesque associations, it is nevertheless true, that no part of\r\nall this was made necessary by us. We deviated from the accustomed modes\r\nof legislation only when we were supplicated to do so, in order to\r\nsupply bald and glaring deficiencies in measures which were before us.\r\n\r\nBut now, Mr. President, let me come to the fortification bill, the lost\r\nbill, which not only now, but on a graver occasion, has been lamented\r\nlike the lost Pleiad.\r\n\r\nThis bill, Sir, came from the House of Representatives to the Senate in\r\nthe usual way, and was referred to the Committee on Finance. Its\r\nappropriations were not large. Indeed, they appeared to the committee to\r\nbe quite too small. It struck a majority of the committee at once, that\r\nthere were several fortifications on the coast, either not provided for\r\nat all, or not adequately provided for, by this bill. The whole amount\r\nof its appropriations was four hundred or four hundred and thirty\r\nthousand dollars. It contained no grant of three millions, and if the\r\nSenate had passed it the very day it came from the House, not only would\r\nthere have been no appropriation of the three millions, but, Sir, none\r\nof these other sums which the Senate did insert in the bill. Others\r\nbesides ourselves saw the deficiencies of this bill. We had\r\ncommunications with and from the departments, and we inserted in the\r\nbill every thing which any department recommended to us. We took care to\r\nbe sure that nothing else was coming. And we then reported the bill to\r\nthe Senate with our proposed amendments. Among these amendments, there\r\nwas a sum of $75,000 for Castle Island in Boston harbor, $100,000 for\r\ndefences in Maryland, and so forth. These amendments were agreed to by\r\nthe Senate, and one or two others added, on the motion of members; and\r\nthe bill, as thus amended, was returned to the House.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, it becomes important to ask, When was this bill, thus\r\namended, returned to the House of Representatives? Was it unduly\r\ndetained here, so that the House was obliged afterwards to act upon it\r\nsuddenly? This question is material to be asked, and material to be\r\nanswered, too, and the journal does satisfactorily answer it; for it\r\nappears by the journal that the bill was returned to the House of\r\nRepresentatives on Tuesday, the 24th of February, _one whole week before\r\nthe close of the session_. And from Tuesday, the 24th of February, to\r\nTuesday, the 3d day of March, we heard not one word from this bill.\r\nTuesday, the 3d day of March, was, of course, the last day of the\r\nsession. We assembled here at ten or eleven o'clock in the morning of\r\nthat day, and sat until three in the afternoon, and still we were not\r\ninformed whether the House had finally passed the bill. As it was an\r\nimportant matter, and belonged to that part of the public business which\r\nusually receives particular attention from the Committee on Finance, I\r\nbore the subject in my mind, and felt some solicitude about it, seeing\r\nthat the session was drawing so near to a close. I took it for granted,\r\nhowever, as I had not heard any thing to the contrary, that the\r\namendments of the Senate would not be objected to, and that, when a\r\nconvenient time should arrive for taking up the bill in the House, it\r\nwould be passed at once into a law, and we should hear no more about it.\r\nNot the slightest intimation was given, either that the executive wished\r\nfor any larger appropriation, or that it was intended in the House to\r\ninsert such larger appropriation. Not a syllable escaped from anybody,\r\nand came to our knowledge, that any further alteration whatever was\r\nintended in the bill.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock in the afternoon of the 3d of March, the Senate took\r\nits recess, as is usual in that period of the session, until five\r\no'clock. At five o'clock we again assembled, and proceeded with the\r\nbusiness of the Senate until eight o'clock in the evening; and at eight\r\no'clock in the evening, and not before, the clerk of the House appeared\r\nat our door, and announced that the House of Representatives had\r\n_disagreed_ to one of the Senate's amendments, _agreed_ to others; and\r\nto two of those amendments, namely, the fourth and fifth, it had agreed,\r\n_with an amendment of its own_.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, these fourth and fifth amendments of ours were, one, a vote of\r\n$75,000 for Castle Island in Boston harbor, and the other, a vote of\r\n$100,000 for certain defences in Maryland. And what, Sir, was the\r\naddition which the House of Representatives proposed to make, by way of\r\n\"_amendment_\" to a vote of $75,000 for repairing the works in Boston\r\nharbor? Here, Sir, it is:--\r\n\r\n     \"_And be it further enacted_, That the sum of three millions of\r\n     dollars be, and the same is hereby, appropriated, out of any money\r\n     in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, to be expended, in\r\n     whole or in part, under the direction of the President of the\r\n     United States, for the military and naval service, including\r\n     fortifications and ordnance, and the increase of the navy:\r\n     _Provided_, such expenditures shall be rendered necessary for the\r\n     defence of the country prior to the next meeting of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nThis proposition, Sir, was thus unexpectedly and suddenly put to us, at\r\neight o'clock in the evening of the last day of the session. Unusual,\r\nunprecedented, extraordinary, as it obviously is, on the face of it, the\r\nmanner of presenting it was still more extraordinary. The President had\r\nasked for no such grant of money; no department had recommended it; no\r\nestimate had suggested it; no reason whatever was given for it. No\r\nemergency had happened, and nothing new had occurred; every thing known\r\nto the administration, at that hour, respecting our foreign relations,\r\nhad certainly been known to it for days and weeks.\r\n\r\nWith what propriety, then, could the Senate be called on to sanction a\r\nproceeding so entirely irregular and anomalous? Sir, I recollect the\r\noccurrences of the moment very well, and I remember the impression which\r\nthis vote of the House seemed to make all round the Senate. We had just\r\ncome out of executive session; the doors were but just opened; and I\r\nhardly remember that there was a single spectator in the hall or the\r\ngalleries. I had been at the clerk's table, and had not reached my seat,\r\nwhen the message was read. All the Senators were in the chamber. I heard\r\nthe message, certainly with great surprise and astonishment; and I\r\nimmediately moved the Senate to _disagree_ to this vote of the House. My\r\nrelation to the subject, in consequence of my connection with the\r\nCommittee on Finance, made it my duty to propose some course, and I had\r\nnot a moment's doubt or hesitation what that course ought to be. I took\r\nupon myself, then, Sir, the responsibility of moving that the Senate\r\nshould disagree to this vote, and I now acknowledge that responsibility.\r\nIt might be presumptuous to say that I took a leading part, but I\r\ncertainly took an early part, a decided part, and an earnest part, in\r\nrejecting this broad grant of three millions of dollars, without\r\nlimitation of purpose or specification of object, called for by no\r\nrecommendation, founded on no estimate, made necessary by no state of\r\nthings which was known to us. Certainly, Sir, I took a part in its\r\nrejection; and I stand here, in my place in the Senate, to-day, ready\r\nto defend the part so taken by me; or, rather, Sir, I disclaim all\r\ndefence, and all occasion of defence, and I assert it as meritorious to\r\nhave been among those who arrested, at the earliest moment, this\r\nextraordinary departure from all settled usage, and, as I think, from\r\nplain constitutional injunction,--this indefinite voting of a vast sum\r\nof money to mere executive discretion, without limit assigned, without\r\nobject specified, without reason given, and without the least control.\r\n\r\nSir, I am told, that, in opposing this grant, I spoke with warmth, and I\r\nsuppose I may have done so. If I did, it was a warmth springing from as\r\nhonest a conviction of duty as ever influenced a public man. It was\r\nspontaneous, unaffected, sincere. There had been among us, Sir, no\r\nconsultation, no concert. There could have been none. Between the\r\nreading of the message and my motion to disagree, there was not time\r\nenough for any two members of the Senate to exchange five words on the\r\nsubject. The proposition was sudden and perfectly unexpected. I resisted\r\nit, as irregular, as dangerous in itself, and dangerous in its\r\nprecedent; as wholly unnecessary, and as violating the plain intention,\r\nif not the express words, of the Constitution. Before the Senate, then,\r\nI avowed, and before the country I now avow, my part in this opposition.\r\nWhatsoever is to fall on those who sanctioned it, of that let me have my\r\nfull share.\r\n\r\nThe Senate, Sir, rejected this grant by a vote of TWENTY-NINE against\r\nnineteen. Those twenty-nine names are on the journal; and whensoever the\r\nEXPUNGING process may commence, or how far soever it may be carried, I\r\npray it, in mercy, not to erase mine from that record. I beseech it, in\r\nits sparing goodness, to leave me that proof of attachment to duty and\r\nto principle. It may draw around it, over it, or through it, black\r\nlines, or red lines, or any lines; it may mark it in any way which\r\neither the most prostrate and fantastical spirit of _man-worship_, or\r\nthe most ingenious and elaborate study of self-degradation, may devise,\r\nif only it will leave it so that those who inherit my blood, or who may\r\nhereafter care for my reputation, shall be able to behold it where it\r\nnow stands.\r\n\r\nThe House, Sir, insisted on this amendment. The Senate adhered to its\r\ndisagreement; the House asked a conference, to which request the Senate\r\nimmediately acceded. The committee of conference met, and in a very\r\nshort time came to an agreement. They agreed to recommend to their\r\nrespective houses, as a substitute for the vote proposed by the House,\r\nthe following:--\r\n\r\n\"As an additional appropriation for arming the fortifications of the\r\nUnited States, three hundred thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"As an additional appropriation for the repairs and equipment of ships\r\nof war of the United States, five hundred thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\nI immediately reported this agreement of the committee of conference to\r\nthe Senate; but, inasmuch as the bill was in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, the Senate could not act further on the matter until\r\nthe House should first have considered the report of the committee,\r\ndecided thereon, and sent us the bill. I did not myself take any note of\r\nthe particular hour of this part of the transaction. The honorable\r\nmember from Virginia[1] says he looked at his watch at the time, and he\r\nknows that I had come from the conference, and was in my seat, at a\r\nquarter past eleven. I have no reason to think that he is under any\r\nmistake on this particular. He says it so happened that he had occasion\r\nto take notice of the hour, and well remembers it. It could not well\r\nhave been later than this, as any one will be satisfied who will look at\r\nour journals, public and executive, and see what a mass of business was\r\ndespatched after I came from the committee, and before the adjournment\r\nof the Senate. Having made the report, Sir, I had no doubt that both\r\nhouses would concur in the result of the conference, and looked every\r\nmoment for the officer of the House bringing the bill. He did not come,\r\nhowever, and I pretty soon learned that there was doubt whether the\r\ncommittee on the part of the House would report to the House the\r\nagreement of the conferees. At first, I did not at all credit this; but\r\nwas confirmed by one communication after another, until I was obliged to\r\nthink it true. Seeing that the bill was thus in danger of being lost,\r\nand intending at any rate that no blame should justly attach to the\r\nSenate, I immediately moved the following resolution:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That a message be sent to the honorable the House of\r\nRepresentatives, respectfully to remind the House of the report of the\r\ncommittee of conference appointed on the disagreeing votes of the two\r\nhouses on the amendment of the House to the amendment of the Senate to\r\nthe bill respecting the fortifications of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nYou recollect this resolution, Sir, having, as I well remember, taken\r\nsome part on the occasion.[2]\r\n\r\nThis resolution was promptly passed; the secretary carried it to the\r\nHouse, and delivered it. What was done in the House on the receipt of\r\nthis message now appears from the printed journal. I have no wish to\r\ncomment on the proceedings there recorded; all may read them, and each\r\nbe able to form his own opinion. Suffice it to say, that the House of\r\nRepresentatives, having then possession of the bill, chose to retain\r\nthat possession, and never acted on the report of the committee of\r\nconference. The bill, therefore, was lost. It was lost in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. It died there, and there its remains are to be found.\r\nNo opportunity was given to the members of the House to decide whether\r\nthey would agree to the report of the committee or not. From a quarter\r\npast eleven, when the report was agreed to, until two or three o'clock\r\nin the morning, the House remained in session. If at any time there was\r\nnot a quorum of members present, the attendance of a quorum, we are to\r\npresume, might have been commanded, as there was undoubtedly a great\r\nmajority of members still in the city.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, there is one other transaction of the evening which I now feel\r\nbound to state, because I think it quite important on several accounts,\r\nthat it should be known.\r\n\r\nA nomination was pending before the Senate for a judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt. In the course of the sitting, that nomination was called up, and,\r\non motion, was indefinitely postponed. In other words, it was rejected;\r\nfor an indefinite postponement is a rejection. The office, of course,\r\nremained vacant, and the nomination of another person to fill it became\r\nnecessary. The President of the United States was then in the Capitol,\r\nas is usual on the evening of the last day of the session, in the\r\nchamber assigned to him, and with the heads of departments around him.\r\nWhen nominations are rejected under these circumstances, it has been\r\nusual for the President immediately to transmit a new nomination to the\r\nSenate; otherwise the office must remain vacant till the next session,\r\nas the vacancy in such case has not happened in the recess of Congress.\r\nThe vote of the Senate, indefinitely postponing this nomination, was\r\ncarried to the President's room by the secretary of the Senate. The\r\nPresident told the secretary that it was more than an hour past twelve\r\no'clock, and that he could receive no further communications from the\r\nSenate, and immediately after, as I have understood, left the Capitol.\r\nThe secretary brought back the paper containing the certified copy of\r\nthe vote of the Senate, and indorsed thereon the substance of the\r\nPresident's answer, and also added, that, according to his own watch, it\r\nwas quarter past one o'clock.\r\n\r\nThere are two views, Sir, in which this occurrence may well deserve to\r\nbe noticed. One is as to the connection which it may perhaps have had\r\nwith the loss of the fortification bill; the other is as to its general\r\nimportance, as introducing a new rule, or a new practice, respecting the\r\nintercourse between the President and the two houses of Congress on the\r\nlast day of the session.\r\n\r\nOn the first point, I shall only observe that the fact of the\r\nPresident's having declined to receive this communication from the\r\nSenate, and of his having left the Capitol, was immediately known in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. It was quite obvious, that, if he could not\r\nreceive a communication from the Senate, neither could he receive a bill\r\nfrom the House of Representatives for his signature. It was equally\r\nobvious, that, if, under these circumstances, the House of\r\nRepresentatives should agree to the report of the committee of\r\nconference, so that the bill should pass, it must, nevertheless, fail to\r\nbecome a law for want of the President's signature; and that, in that\r\ncase, the blame of losing the bill, on whomsoever else it might fall,\r\ncould not be laid upon the Senate.\r\n\r\nOn the more general point, I must say, Sir, that this decision of the\r\nPresident, not to hold communication with the houses of Congress after\r\ntwelve o'clock at night, on the 3d of March, is quite new. No such\r\nobjection has ever been made before by any President. No one of them has\r\never declined communicating with either house at any time during the\r\ncontinuance of its session on that day. All Presidents heretofore have\r\nleft with the houses themselves to fix their hour of adjournment, and to\r\nbring their session for the day to a close, whenever they saw fit.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious, in point of fact, that nothing is more common than for\r\nboth houses to sit later than twelve o'clock, for the purpose of\r\ncompleting measures which are in the last stages of their progress.\r\nAmendments are proposed and agreed to, bills passed, enrolled bills\r\nsigned by the presiding officers, and other important legislative acts\r\nperformed, often at two or three o'clock in the morning. All this is\r\nvery well known to gentlemen who have been for any considerable time\r\nmembers of Congress. And all Presidents have signed bills, and have also\r\nmade nominations to the Senate, without objection as to time, whenever\r\nbills have been presented for signature, or whenever it became necessary\r\nto make nominations to the Senate, at any time during the session of the\r\nrespective houses on that day.\r\n\r\nAnd all this, Sir, I suppose to be perfectly right, correct, and legal.\r\nThere is no clause of the Constitution, nor is there any law, which\r\ndeclares that the term of office of members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives shall expire at twelve o'clock at night on the 3d of\r\nMarch. They are to hold for two years, but the precise hour for the\r\ncommencement of that term of two years is nowhere fixed by\r\nconstitutional or legal provision. It has been established by usage and\r\nby inference, and very properly established, that, since the first\r\nCongress commenced its existence on the first Wednesday in March, 1789,\r\nwhich happened to be the fourth day of the month, therefore the 4th of\r\nMarch is the day of the commencement of each successive term; but no\r\nhour is fixed by law or practice. The true rule is, as I think, most\r\nundoubtedly, that the session held on the last day constitutes the last\r\nday for all legislative and legal purposes. While the session begun on\r\nthat day continues, the day itself continues, according to the\r\nestablished practice both of legislative and judicial bodies. This could\r\nnot well be otherwise. If the precise moment of actual time were to\r\nsettle such a matter, it would be material to ask, Who shall settle the\r\ntime? Shall it be done by public authority, or shall every man observe\r\nthe tick of his own watch? If absolute time is to furnish a precise\r\nrule, the excess of a minute, it is obvious, would be as fatal as the\r\nexcess of an hour. Sir, no bodies, judicial or legislative, have ever\r\nbeen so hypercritical, so astute to no purpose, so much more nice than\r\nwise, as to govern themselves by any such ideas. The session for the\r\nday, at whatever hour it commences, or at whatever hour it breaks up, is\r\nthe legislative day. Every thing has reference to the commencement of\r\nthat diurnal session. For instance, this is the 14th day of January; we\r\nassembled here to-day at twelve o'clock; our journal is dated January\r\n14th, and if we should remain here until five o'clock to-morrow morning\r\n(and the Senate has sometimes sat so late), our proceedings would still\r\nbear date of the 14th of January; they would be so stated upon the\r\njournal, and the journal is a record, and is a conclusive record, so far\r\nas respects the proceedings of the body.\r\n\r\nIt is so in judicial proceedings. If a man were on trial for his life,\r\nat a late hour on the last day allowed by law for the holding of the\r\ncourt, and the jury should acquit him, but happened to remain so long in\r\ndeliberation that they did not bring in their verdict till after twelve\r\no'clock, is it all to be held for naught, and the man to be tried over\r\nagain? Are all verdicts, judgments, and orders of courts null and void,\r\nif made after midnight on the day which the law prescribes as the last\r\nday? It would be easy to show by authority, if authority could be wanted\r\nfor a thing the reason of which is so clear, that the day lasts while\r\nthe daily session lasts. When the court or the legislative body adjourns\r\nfor that day, the day is over, and not before.\r\n\r\nI am told, indeed, Sir, that it is true that, on this same 3d day of\r\nMarch last, not only were other things transacted, but that the bill for\r\nthe repair of the Cumberland Road, an important and much litigated\r\nmeasure, actually received the signature of our presiding officer after\r\ntwelve o'clock, was then sent to the President, and signed by him. I do\r\nnot affirm this, because I took no notice of the time, or do not\r\nremember it if I did; but I have heard the matter so stated.\r\n\r\nI see no reason, Sir, for the introduction of this new practice; no\r\nprinciple on which it can be justified, no necessity for it, no\r\npropriety in it. As yet, it has been applied only to the President's\r\nintercourse with the Senate. Certainly it is equally applicable to his\r\nintercourse with both houses in legislative matters; and if it is to\r\nprevail hereafter, it is of much importance that it should be known.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, Sir, has alluded to this loss of the\r\nfortification bill in his message at the opening of the session, and he\r\nhas alluded, also, in the same message, to the rejection of the vote of\r\nthe three millions. On the first point, that is, the loss of the whole\r\nbill, and the causes of that loss, this is his language: \"Much loss and\r\ninconvenience have been experienced in consequence of the failure of the\r\nbill containing the ordinary appropriations for fortifications, which\r\npassed one branch of the national legislature at the last session, but\r\nwas lost in the other.\"\r\n\r\nIf the President intended to say that the bill, having originated in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, passed the Senate, and was yet afterwards lost\r\nin the House of Representatives, he was entirely correct. But he has\r\nbeen wholly misinformed, if he intended to state that the bill, having\r\npassed the House, was lost in the Senate. As I have already stated, the\r\nbill was lost in the House of Representatives. It drew its last breath\r\nthere. That House never let go its hold on it after the report of the\r\ncommittee of conference. But it held it, it retained it, and of course\r\nit died in its possession when the House adjourned. It is to be\r\nregretted that the President should have been misinformed in a matter of\r\nthis kind, when the slightest reference to the journals of the two\r\nhouses would have exhibited the correct history of the transaction.\r\n\r\nI recur again, Mr. President, to the proposed grant of the three\r\nmillions, for the purpose of stating somewhat more distinctly the true\r\ngrounds of objection to that grant.\r\n\r\nThese grounds of objection were two; the first was, that no such\r\nappropriation had been recommended by the President, or any of the\r\ndepartments. And what made this ground the stronger was, that the\r\nproposed grant was defended, so far as it was defended at all, upon an\r\nalleged necessity, growing out of our foreign relations. The foreign\r\nrelations of the country are intrusted by the Constitution to the lead\r\nand management of the executive government. The President not only is\r\nsupposed to be, but usually is, much better informed on these\r\ninteresting subjects than the houses of Congress. If there be danger of\r\na rupture with a foreign state, he sees it soonest. All our ministers\r\nand agents abroad are but so many eyes, and ears, and organs to\r\ncommunicate to him whatsoever occurs in foreign places, and to keep him\r\nwell advised of all which may concern the interests of the United\r\nStates. There is an especial propriety, therefore, that, in this branch\r\nof the public service, Congress should always be able to avail itself of\r\nthe distinct opinions and recommendations of the President. The two\r\nhouses, and especially the House of Representatives, are the natural\r\nguardians of the people's money. They are to keep it sacred, and to use\r\nit discreetly. They are not at liberty to spend it where it is not\r\nneeded, nor to offer it for any purpose till a reasonable occasion for\r\nthe expenditure be shown. Now, in this case, I repeat again, the\r\nPresident had sent us no recommendation for any such appropriation; no\r\ndepartment had recommended it; no estimate had contained it; in the\r\nwhole history of the session, from the morning of the first day, down to\r\neight o'clock in the evening of the last day, not one syllable had been\r\nsaid to us, not one hint suggested, showing that the President deemed\r\nany such measure either necessary or proper. I state this strongly, Sir,\r\nbut I state it truly. I state the matter as it is; and I wish to draw\r\nthe attention of the Senate and of the country strongly to this part of\r\nthe case. I say again, therefore, that, when this vote for the three\r\nmillions was proposed to the Senate, there was nothing before us showing\r\nthat the President recommended any such appropriation. You very well\r\nknow, Sir, that this objection was stated as soon as the message from\r\nthe House was read. We all well remember that this was the very point\r\nput forth by the honorable member from Tennessee,[3] as being, if I may\r\nsay so, the but-end of his argument in opposition to the vote. He said,\r\nvery significantly, and very forcibly, \"It is not asked for by those who\r\nbest know what the public service requires; how, then, are we to presume\r\nthat it is needed?\" This question, Sir, was not answered then; it never\r\nhas been answered since, it never can be answered satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nBut let me here again, Sir, recur to the message of the President.\r\nSpeaking of the loss of the bill, he uses these words: \"This failure was\r\nthe more regretted, not only because it necessarily interrupted and\r\ndelayed the progress of a system of national defence projected\r\nimmediately after the last war, and since steadily pursued, but also\r\nbecause it contained a contingent appropriation, inserted in accordance\r\nwith the views of the executive, in aid of this important object, and\r\nother branches of the national defence, some portions of which might\r\nhave been most usefully applied during the past season.\"\r\n\r\nTaking these words of the message, Sir, and connecting them with the\r\nfact that the President had made no recommendation to Congress of any\r\nsuch appropriation, it strikes me that they furnish matter for very\r\ngrave reflection. The President says that this proposed appropriation\r\nwas \"in accordance with the views of the executive\"; that it was \"in aid\r\nof an important object\"; and that \"some portions of it might have been\r\nmost usefully applied during the past season.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, I ask, if this be so, why was not this appropriation\r\nrecommended to Congress by the President? I ask this question in the\r\nname of the Constitution of the United States; I stand on its own clear\r\nauthority in asking it; and I invite all those who remember its\r\ninjunctions, and who mean to respect them, to consider well how the\r\nquestion is to be answered.\r\n\r\nSir, the Constitution is not yet an entire dead letter. There is yet\r\nsome form of observance of its requirements; and even while any degree\r\nof formal respect is paid to it, I must be permitted to continue the\r\nquestion, Why was not this appropriation recommended? It was in\r\naccordance with the President's views; it was for an important object;\r\nit might have been usefully expended. The President being of opinion,\r\ntherefore, that the appropriation was necessary and proper, how is it\r\nthat it was not recommended to Congress? For, Sir, we all know the plain\r\nand direct words in which the very first duty of the President is\r\nimposed by the Constitution. Here they are:--\r\n\r\n\"He shall, from time to time, give to the Congress information of the\r\nstate of the Union, and recommend to their consideration such measures\r\nas he shall judge necessary and expedient.\"\r\n\r\nAfter enumerating the _powers_ of the President, this is the first, the\r\nvery first _duty_ which the Constitution gravely enjoins upon him. And\r\nnow, Sir, in no language of taunt or reproach, in no language of party\r\nattack, in terms of no asperity or exaggeration, but called upon by the\r\nnecessity of defending my own vote upon the subject, as a public man, as\r\na member of Congress here in my place, and as a citizen who feels as\r\nwarm an attachment to the Constitution of the country as any other can,\r\nI demand of any who may choose to give it an answer to this question:\r\nWHY WAS NOT THIS MEASURE, WHICH THE PRESIDENT DECLARES THAT HE THOUGHT\r\nNECESSARY AND EXPEDIENT, RECOMMENDED TO CONGRESS? And why am I, and why\r\nare other members of Congress, whose path of duty the Constitution says\r\nshall be enlightened by the President's opinions and communications, to\r\nbe charged with want of patriotism and want of fidelity to the country,\r\nbecause we refused an appropriation which the President, though it was\r\nin accordance with his views, and though he believed it important, would\r\nnot, and did not, recommend to us? When these questions are answered to\r\nthe satisfaction of intelligent and impartial men, then, and not till\r\nthen, let reproach, let censure, let suspicion of any kind, rest on the\r\ntwenty-nine names which stand opposed to this appropriation.\r\n\r\nHow, Sir, were we to know that this appropriation \"was in accordance\r\nwith the views of the executive\"? He had not so told us, formally or\r\ninformally. He had not only not recommended it to Congress, or either\r\nhouse of Congress, but nobody on this floor had undertaken to speak in\r\nhis behalf. No man got up to say, \"The President desires it; he thinks\r\nit necessary, expedient, and proper.\" But, Sir, if any gentleman had\r\nrisen to say this, it would not have answered the requisition of the\r\nConstitution. Not at all. It is not by a hint, an intimation, the\r\nsuggestion of a friend, that the executive duty in this respect is to be\r\nfulfilled. By no means. The President is to make a recommendation,--a\r\npublic recommendation, an official recommendation, a responsible\r\nrecommendation, not to one house, but to both houses; it is to be a\r\nrecommendation to Congress. If, on receiving such recommendation,\r\nCongress fail to pay it proper respect, the fault is theirs. If, deeming\r\nthe measure necessary and expedient, the President fails to recommend\r\nit, the fault is his, clearly, distinctly, and exclusively his. This,\r\nSir, is the Constitution of the United States, or else I do not\r\nunderstand the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nDoes not every man see how entirely unconstitutional it is that the\r\nPresident should communicate his opinions or wishes to Congress, on such\r\ngrave and important subjects, otherwise than by a direct and responsible\r\nrecommendation, a public and open recommendation, equally addressed and\r\nequally known to all whose duty calls upon them to act on the subject?\r\nWhat would be the state of things, if he might communicate his wishes or\r\nopinions privately to members of one house, and make no such\r\ncommunication to the other? Would not the two houses be necessarily put\r\nin immediate collision? Would they stand on equal footing? Would they\r\nhave equal information? What could ensue from such a manner of\r\nconducting the public business, but quarrel, confusion, and conflict? A\r\nmember rises in the House of Representatives, and moves a very large\r\nappropriation of money for military purposes. If he says he does it upon\r\nexecutive recommendation, where is his voucher? The President is not\r\nlike the British king, whose ministers and secretaries are in the House\r\nof Commons, and who are authorized, in certain cases, to express the\r\nopinions and wishes of their sovereign. We have no king's servants; at\r\nleast, we have none known to the Constitution. Congress can know the\r\nopinions of the President only as he officially communicates them. It\r\nwould be a curious inquiry in either house, when a large appropriation\r\nis moved, if it were necessary to ask whether the mover represented the\r\nPresident, spoke his sentiments, or, in other words, whether what he\r\nproposed were \"in accordance with the views of the executive.\" How could\r\nthat be judged of? By the party he belongs to? Party is not quite\r\nstrongly enough marked for that. By the airs he gives himself? Many\r\nmight assume airs, if thereby they could give themselves such importance\r\nas to be esteemed authentic expositors of the executive will. Or is this\r\nwill to be circulated in whispers; made known to the meetings of party\r\nmen; intimated through the press; or communicated in any other form,\r\nwhich still leaves the executive completely irresponsible; so that,\r\nwhile executive purposes or wishes pervade the ranks of party friends,\r\ninfluence their conduct, and unite their efforts, the open, direct, and\r\nconstitutional responsibility is wholly avoided? Sir, this is not the\r\nConstitution of the United States, nor can it be consistent with any\r\nconstitution which professes to maintain separate departments in the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nHere, then, Sir, is abundant ground, in my judgment, for the vote of the\r\nSenate, and here I might rest it. But there is also another ground. The\r\nConstitution declares that no money shall be drawn from the treasury but\r\nin consequence of appropriations made by law. What is meant by\r\n\"_appropriations_\"? Does not this language mean that particular sums\r\nshall be assigned by law to particular objects? How far this pointing\r\nout and fixing the particular objects shall be carried, is a question\r\nthat cannot be settled by any precise rule. But \"specific\r\nappropriation,\" that is to say, the designation of every object for\r\nwhich money is voted, as far as such designation is practicable, has\r\nbeen thought to be a most important republican principle. In times past,\r\npopular parties have claimed great merit from professing to carry this\r\ndoctrine much farther, and to adhere to it much more strictly, than\r\ntheir adversaries. Mr. Jefferson, especially, was a great advocate for\r\nit, and held it to be indispensable to a safe and economical\r\nadministration and disbursement of the public revenues.\r\n\r\nBut what have the friends and admirers of Mr. Jefferson to say to this\r\n_appropriation_? Where do they find, in this proposed grant of three\r\nmillions, a constitutional designation of object, and a particular and\r\nspecific application of money? Have they forgotten, all forgotten, and\r\nwholly abandoned even all pretence for specific appropriation? If not,\r\nhow could they sanction such a vote as this? Let me recall its terms.\r\nThey are, that \"the sum of three millions of dollars be, and the same is\r\nhereby, appropriated, out of any money in the treasury not otherwise\r\nappropriated, to be expended, in whole or in part, under the direction\r\nof the President of the United States, for the military and naval\r\nservice, including fortifications and ordnance, and the increase of the\r\nnavy; provided such expenditures shall be rendered necessary for the\r\ndefence of the country prior to the next meeting of Congress.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is to be observed, that whether the money shall be\r\nused at all, or not, is made to depend on the discretion of the\r\nPresident. This is sufficiently liberal. It carries confidence far\r\nenough. But if there had been no other objections, if the objects of the\r\nappropriation had been sufficiently described, so that the President, if\r\nhe expended the money at all, must expend it for purposes authorized by\r\nthe legislature, and nothing had been left to his discretion but the\r\nquestion whether an emergency had arisen in which the authority ought to\r\nbe exercised, I might not have felt bound to reject the vote. There are\r\nsome precedents which might favor such a contingent provision, though\r\nthe practice is dangerous, and ought not to be followed except in cases\r\nof clear necessity.\r\n\r\nBut the insurmountable objection to the proposed grant was, that it\r\nspecified no objects. It was as general as language could make it. It\r\nembraced every expenditure that could be called either military or\r\nnaval. It was to include \"fortifications, ordnance, and the increase of\r\nthe navy,\" but it was not confined to these. It embraced the whole\r\ngeneral subject of military service. Under the authority of such a law,\r\nthe President might repair ships, build ships, buy ships, enlist seamen,\r\nand do any thing and every thing else touching the naval service,\r\nwithout restraint or control.\r\n\r\nHe might repair such fortifications as he saw fit, and neglect the rest;\r\narm such as he saw fit, and neglect the arming of others; or build new\r\nfortifications wherever he chose. But these unlimited powers over the\r\nfortifications and the navy constitute by no means the most dangerous\r\npart of the proposed authority; because, under that authority, his power\r\nto raise and employ land forces would be equally absolute and\r\nuncontrolled. He might levy troops, embody a new army, call out the\r\nmilitia in numbers to suit his own discretion, and employ them as he saw\r\nfit.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, does our legislation, under the Constitution, furnish any\r\nprecedent for all this?\r\n\r\nWe make appropriations for the army, and we understand what we are\r\ndoing, because it is \"the army,\" that is to say, the army established by\r\nlaw. We make appropriations for the navy; they, too, are for \"the navy,\"\r\nas provided for and established by law. We make appropriations for\r\nfortifications, but we say what fortifications, and we assign to each\r\nits intended amount of the whole sum. This is the usual course of\r\nCongress on such subjects; and why should it be departed from? Are we\r\nready to say that the power of fixing the places for new fortifications,\r\nand the sum allotted to each; the power of ordering new ships to be\r\nbuilt, and fixing the number of such new ships; the power of laying out\r\nmoney to raise men for the army; in short, every power, great or small,\r\nrespecting the military and naval service, shall be vested in the\r\nPresident, without specification of object or purpose, to the entire\r\nexclusion of the exercise of all judgment on the part of Congress? For\r\none, I am not prepared. The honorable member from Ohio, near me, has\r\nsaid, that if the enemy had been on our shores he would not have agreed\r\nto this vote. And I say, if the proposition were now before us, and the\r\nguns of the enemy were pointed against the walls of the Capitol, I would\r\nnot agree to it.\r\n\r\nThe people of this country have an interest, a property, an inheritance,\r\nin this INSTRUMENT, against the value of which forty capitols do not\r\nweigh the twentieth part of one poor scruple. There can never be any\r\nnecessity for such proceedings, but a feigned and false necessity; a\r\nmere idle and hollow pretence of necessity; least of all can it be said\r\nthat any such necessity actually existed on the 3d of March. There was\r\nno enemy on our shores; there were no guns pointed against the Capitol;\r\nwe were in no war, nor was there a reasonable probability that we should\r\nhave war, unless we made it ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut whatever was the state of our foreign relations, is it not\r\npreposterous to say, that it was necessary for Congress to adopt this\r\nmeasure, and yet not necessary for the President to recommend it? Why\r\nshould we thus run in advance of all our own duties, and leave the\r\nPresident completely shielded from his just responsibility? Why should\r\nthere be nothing but trust and confidence on our side, and nothing but\r\ndiscretion and power on his?\r\n\r\nSir, if there be any philosophy in history, if human blood still runs in\r\nhuman veins, if man still conforms to the identity of his nature, the\r\ninstitutions which secure constitutional liberty can never stand long\r\nagainst this excessive personal confidence, against this devotion to\r\nmen, in utter disregard both of principle and experience, which seem to\r\nme to be strongly characteristic of our times. This vote came to us,\r\nSir, from the popular branch of the legislature; and that such a vote\r\nshould come from such a branch of the legislature was amongst the\r\ncircumstances which excited in me the greatest surprise and the deepest\r\nconcern. Certainly, Sir, certainly I was not, on that account, the more\r\ninclined to concur. It was no argument with me, that others seemed to be\r\nrushing, with such heedless, headlong trust, such impetuosity of\r\nconfidence, into the arms of executive power. I held back the more\r\nstrongly, and would hold back the longer. I see, or I think I see,--it\r\nis either a true vision of the future, revealed by the history of the\r\npast, or, if it be an illusion, it is an illusion which appears to me in\r\nall the brightness and sunlight of broad noon,--that it is in this\r\ncareer of personal confidence, along this beaten track of _man-worship_,\r\nmarked at every stage by the fragments of other free governments, that\r\nour own system is making progress to its close. A personal popularity,\r\nhonorably earned at first by military achievements, and sustained now by\r\nparty, by patronage, and by enthusiasm which looks for no ill, because\r\nit means no ill itself, seems to render men willing to gratify power,\r\neven before its demands are made, and to surfeit executive discretion,\r\neven in anticipation of its own appetite.\r\n\r\nIf, Sir, on the 3d of March last, it had been the purpose of both houses\r\nof Congress to create a military dictator, what formula had been better\r\nsuited to their purpose than this vote of the House? It is true, we\r\nmight have given more money, if we had had it to give. We might have\r\nemptied the treasury; but as to the _form_ of the gift, we could not\r\nhave bettered it. Rome had no better models. When we give our money _for\r\nany military purpose whatever_, what remains to be done? If we leave it\r\nwith one man to decide, not only whether the military means of the\r\ncountry shall be used at all, but how they shall be used, and to what\r\nextent they shall be employed, what remains either for Congress or the\r\npeople but to sit still and see how this dictatorial power will be\r\nexercised? On the 3d of March, Sir, I had not forgotten, it was\r\nimpossible that I should have forgotten, the recommendation in the\r\nmessage at the opening of that session, that power should be vested in\r\nthe President to issue letters of marque and reprisal against France, at\r\nhis discretion, in the recess of Congress. Happily, this power was not\r\ngranted; but suppose it had been, what would then have been the true\r\ncondition of this government? Why, Sir, this condition is very shortly\r\ndescribed. The whole war power would have been in the hands of the\r\nPresident; for no man can doubt a moment that reprisals would bring on\r\nimmediate war; and the treasury, to the amount of this vote, in addition\r\nto all ordinary appropriations, would have been at his absolute disposal\r\nalso. And all this in a time of peace. I beseech all true lovers of\r\nconstitutional liberty to contemplate this state of things, and tell me\r\nwhether such be a truly republican administration of this government.\r\nWhether particular consequences had ensued or not, is such an\r\naccumulation of power in the hands of the executive according to the\r\nspirit of our system? Is it either wise or safe? Has it any warrant in\r\nthe practice of former times? Or are gentlemen ready to establish the\r\npractice, as an example for the benefit of those who are to come after\r\nus?\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, if the power to make reprisals, and this money from the\r\ntreasury, had both been granted, is there not great reason to believe\r\nthat we should have been now actually at war? I think there is great\r\nreason to believe this. It will be said, I know, that if we had armed\r\nthe President with this power of war, and supplied him with this grant\r\nof money, France would have taken it for such a proof of spirit on our\r\npart, that she would have paid the indemnity without further delay. This\r\nis the old story, and the old plea. It is the excuse of every one who\r\ndesires more power than the Constitution or the laws give him, that if\r\nhe had more power he could do more good. Power is always claimed for the\r\ngood of the people; and dictators are always made, when made at all, for\r\nthe good of the people. For my part, Sir, I was content, and am content,\r\nto show France that we are prepared to maintain our just rights against\r\nher by the exertion of our power, when need be, according to the forms\r\nof our own Constitution; that, if we make war, we will make it\r\nconstitutionally; and that we will trust all our interests, both in\r\npeace and war, to what the intelligence and the strength of the country\r\nmay do for them, without breaking down or endangering the fabric of our\r\nfree institutions.\r\n\r\nMr. President, it is the misfortune of the Senate to have differed with\r\nthe executive on many great questions during the last four or five\r\nyears. I have regretted this state of things deeply, both on personal\r\nand on public accounts; but it has been unavoidable. It is no pleasant\r\nemployment, it is no holiday business, to maintain opposition against\r\npower and against majorities, and to contend for stern and sturdy\r\nprinciple, against personal popularity, against a rushing and\r\noverwhelming confidence, that, by wave upon wave and cataract after\r\ncataract, seems to be bearing away and destroying whatsoever would\r\nwithstand it. How much longer we may be able to support this opposition\r\nin any degree, or whether we can possibly hold out till the public\r\nintelligence and the public patriotism shall be awakened to a due sense\r\nof the public danger, it is not for me to foretell. I shall not despair\r\nto the last, if, in the mean time, we are true to our own principles. If\r\nthere be a steadfast adherence to these principles, both here and\r\nelsewhere, if, one and all, they continue the rule of our conduct in the\r\nSenate, and the rallying-point of those who think with us and support us\r\nout of the Senate, I am content to hope on and to struggle on. While it\r\nremains a contest for the preservation of the Constitution, for the\r\nsecurity of public liberty, for the ascendency of principles over men, I\r\nam willing to bear my part of it. If we can maintain the Constitution,\r\nif we can preserve this security for liberty, if we can thus give to\r\ntrue principle its just superiority over party, over persons, over\r\nnames, our labors will be richly rewarded. If we fail in all this, they\r\nare already among the living who will write the history of this\r\ngovernment, from its commencement to its close.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Leigh.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. King, of Alabama, was in the chair.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mr. White.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AT NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nA SPEECH DELIVERED AT NIBLO'S SALOON, IN NEW YORK, ON THE 15TH OF MARCH,\r\n1837.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and Fellow-Citizens:--It would be idle in me to affect to\r\nbe indifferent to the circumstances under which I have now the honor of\r\naddressing you.\r\n\r\nI find myself in the commercial metropolis of the continent, in the\r\nmidst of a vast assembly of intelligent men, drawn from all the classes,\r\nprofessions, and pursuits of life.\r\n\r\nAnd you have been pleased, Gentlemen, to meet me, in this imposing\r\nmanner, and to offer me a warm and cordial welcome to your city. I thank\r\nyou. I feel the full force and importance of this manifestation of your\r\nregard. In the highly-flattering resolutions which invited me here, in\r\nthe respectability of this vast multitude of my fellow-citizens, and in\r\nthe approbation and hearty good-will which you have here manifested, I\r\nfeel cause for profound and grateful acknowledgment.\r\n\r\nTo every individual of this meeting, therefore, I would now most\r\nrespectfully make that acknowledgment; and with every one, as with hands\r\njoined in mutual greeting, I reciprocate friendly salutation, respect,\r\nand good wishes.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, although I am well assured of your personal regard, I\r\ncannot fail to know, that the times, the political and commercial\r\ncondition of things which exists among us, and an intelligent spirit,\r\nawakened to new activity and a new degree of anxiety, have mainly\r\ncontributed to fill these avenues and crowd these halls. At a moment of\r\ndifficulty, and of much alarm, you come here as Whigs of New York, to\r\nmeet one whom you believe to be bound to you by common principles and\r\ncommon sentiments, and pursuing, with you, a common object. Gentlemen, I\r\nam proud to admit this community of our principles, and this identity of\r\nour objects. You are for the Constitution of the country; so am I. You\r\nare for the Union of the States; so am I. You are for equal laws, for\r\nthe equal rights of all men, for constitutional and just restraints on\r\npower, for the substance and not the shadowy image only of popular\r\ninstitutions, for a government which has liberty for its spirit and\r\nsoul, as well as in its forms; and so am I. You feel that if, in warm\r\nparty times, the executive power is in hands distinguished for boldness,\r\nfor great success, for perseverance, and other qualities which strike\r\nmen's minds strongly, there is danger of derangement of the powers of\r\ngovernment, danger of a new division of those powers, in which the\r\nexecutive is likely to obtain the lion's part; and danger of a state of\r\nthings in which the more popular branches of the government, instead of\r\nbeing guards and sentinels against any encroachments from the executive,\r\nseek, rather, support from its patronage, safety against the complaints\r\nof the people in its ample and all-protecting favor, and refuge in its\r\npower; and so I feel, and so I have felt for eight long and anxious\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nYou believe that a very efficient and powerful cause in the production\r\nof the evils which now fall on the industrious and commercial classes\r\nof the community, is the derangement of the currency, the destruction of\r\nthe exchanges, and the unnatural and unnecessary _misplacement_ of the\r\nspecie of the country, by unauthorized and illegal treasury orders. So\r\ndo I believe. I predicted all this from the beginning, and from before\r\nthe beginning. I predicted it all, last spring, when that was attempted\r\nto be done by law which was afterwards done by executive authority; and\r\nfrom the moment of the exercise of that executive authority to the\r\npresent time, I have both foreseen and seen the regular progress of\r\nthings under it, from inconvenience and embarrassment, to pressure, loss\r\nof confidence, disorder, and bankruptcies.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I mean, on this occasion, to speak my sentiments freely on\r\nthe great topics of the day. I have nothing to conceal, and shall\r\ntherefore conceal nothing. In regard to political sentiments, purposes,\r\nor objects, there is nothing in my heart which I am ashamed of; I shall\r\nthrow it all open, therefore, to you, and to all men. [That is right,\r\nsaid some one in the crowd; let us have it, with no non-committal.] Yes,\r\nmy friend, without non-committal or evasion, without barren generalities\r\nor empty phrase, without _if_ or _but_, without a single touch, in all I\r\nsay, bearing the oracular character of an Inaugural, I shall, on this\r\noccasion, speak my mind plainly, freely, and independently, to men who\r\nare just as free to concur or not to concur in my sentiments, as I am to\r\nutter them. I think you are entitled to hear my opinions freely and\r\nfrankly spoken; but I freely acknowledge that you are still more clearly\r\nentitled to retain, and maintain, your own opinions, however they may\r\ndiffer or agree with mine.\r\n\r\nIt is true, Gentlemen, that I have contemplated the relinquishment of my\r\nseat in the Senate for the residue of the term, now two years, for which\r\nI was chosen. This resolution was not taken from disgust or\r\ndiscouragement, although some things have certainly happened which might\r\nexcite both those feelings. But in popular governments, men must not\r\nsuffer themselves to be permanently disgusted by occasional exhibitions\r\nof political harlequinism, or deeply discouraged, although their efforts\r\nto awaken the people to what they deem the dangerous tendency of public\r\nmeasures be not crowned with immediate success. It was altogether from\r\nother causes, and other considerations, that, after an uninterrupted\r\nservice of fourteen or fifteen years, I naturally desired a respite. But\r\nthose whose opinions I am bound to respect saw objections to a present\r\nwithdrawal from Congress; and I have yielded my own strong desire to\r\ntheir convictions of what the public good requires.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, in speaking here on the subjects which now so much interest\r\nthe community, I wish in the outset to disclaim all personal disrespect\r\ntowards individuals. He[1] whose character and fortune have exercised\r\nsuch a decisive influence on our politics for eight years, has now\r\nretired from public station. I pursue him with no personal reflections,\r\nno reproaches. Between him and myself there has always existed a\r\nrespectful personal intercourse. Moments have existed, indeed, critical\r\nand decisive upon the general success of his administration, in which he\r\nhas been pleased to regard my aid as not altogether unimportant. I now\r\nspeak of him respectfully, as a distinguished soldier, as one who, in\r\nthat character, has done the state much service; as a man, too, of\r\nstrong and decided character, of unsubdued resolution and perseverance\r\nin whatever he undertakes. In speaking of his civil administration, I\r\nspeak without censoriousness, or harsh imputation of motives; I wish him\r\nhealth and happiness in his retirement; but I must still speak as I\r\nthink of his public measures, and of their general bearing and tendency,\r\nnot only on the present interests of the country, but also on the\r\nwell-being and security of the government itself.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some topics of a less urgent present application and\r\nimportance, upon which I wish to say a few words, before I advert to\r\nthose which are more immediately connected with the present distressed\r\nstate of things.\r\n\r\nMy learned and highly-valued friend (Mr. Ogden) who has addressed me in\r\nyour behalf, has been kindly pleased to speak of my political career as\r\nbeing marked by a freedom from local interests and prejudices, and a\r\ndevotion to liberal and comprehensive views of public policy.\r\n\r\nI will not say that this compliment is deserved. I will only say, that I\r\nhave earnestly endeavored to deserve it. Gentlemen, the general\r\ngovernment, to the extent of its power, is national. It is not\r\nconsolidated, it does not embrace all powers of government. On the\r\ncontrary, it is delegated, restrained, strictly limited.\r\n\r\nBut what powers it does possess, it possesses for the general, not for\r\nany partial or local good. It extends over a vast territory, embracing\r\nnow six-and-twenty States, with interests various, but not\r\nirreconcilable, infinitely diversified, but capable of being all blended\r\ninto political harmony.\r\n\r\nHe, however, who would produce this harmony must survey the whole field,\r\nas if all parts were as interesting to himself as they are to others,\r\nand with that generous, patriotic feeling, prompter and better than the\r\nmere dictates of cool reason, which leads him to embrace the whole with\r\naffectionate regard, as constituting, altogether, that object which he\r\nis so much bound to respect, to defend, and to love,--his country. We\r\nhave around us, and more or less within the influence and protection of\r\nthe general government, all the great interests of agriculture,\r\nnavigation, commerce, manufactures, the fisheries, and the mechanic\r\narts. The duties of the government, then, certainly extend over all this\r\nterritory, and embrace all these vast interests. We have a maritime\r\nfrontier, a sea-coast of many thousand miles; and while no one doubts\r\nthat it is the duty of government to defend this coast by suitable\r\nmilitary preparations, there are those who yet suppose that the powers\r\nof government stop at this point; and that as to works of peace and\r\nworks of improvement, they are beyond our constitutional limits. I have\r\never thought otherwise. Congress has a right, no doubt, to declare war,\r\nand to provide armies and navies; and it has necessarily the right to\r\nbuild fortifications and batteries, to protect the coast from the\r\neffects of war. But Congress has authority also, and it is its duty, to\r\nregulate commerce, and it has the whole power of collecting duties on\r\nimports and tonnage. It must have ports and harbors, and dock-yards\r\nalso, for its navies. Very early in the history of the government, it\r\nwas decided by Congress, on the report of a highly respectable\r\ncommittee, that the transfer by the States to Congress of the power of\r\ncollecting tonnage and other duties, and the grant of the authority to\r\nregulate commerce, charged Congress, necessarily, with the duty of\r\nmaintaining such piers and wharves and lighthouses, and of making such\r\nimprovements, as might have been expected to be done by the States, if\r\nthey had retained the usual means, by retaining the power of collecting\r\nduties on imports. The States, it was admitted, had parted with this\r\npower; and the duty of protecting and facilitating commerce by these\r\nmeans had passed, along with this power, into other hands. I have never\r\nhesitated, therefore, when the state of the treasury would admit, to\r\nvote for reasonable appropriations, for breakwaters, lighthouses, piers,\r\nharbors, and similar public works, on any part of the whole Atlantic\r\ncoast or the Gulf of Mexico, from Maine to Louisiana.\r\n\r\nBut how stands the inland frontier? How is it along the vast lakes and\r\nthe mighty rivers of the North and West? Do our constitutional rights\r\nand duties terminate where the water ceases to be salt? or do they\r\nexist, in full vigor, on the shores of these inland seas? I never could\r\ndoubt about this; and yet, Gentlemen, I remember even to have\r\nparticipated in a warm debate, in the Senate, some years ago, upon the\r\nconstitutional right of Congress to make an appropriation for a pier in\r\nthe harbor of Buffalo. What! make a harbor at Buffalo, where Nature\r\nnever made any, and where therefore it was never intended any ever\r\nshould be made! Take money from the people to run out piers from the\r\nsandy shores of Lake Erie, or deepen the channels of her shallow rivers!\r\nWhere was the constitutional authority for this? Where would such\r\nstrides of power stop? How long would the States have any power at all\r\nleft, if their territory might be ruthlessly invaded for such unhallowed\r\npurposes, or how long would the people have any money in their pockets,\r\nif the government of the United States might tax them, at pleasure, for\r\nsuch extravagant projects as these? Piers, wharves, harbors, and\r\nbreakwaters in the Lakes! These arguments, Gentlemen, however earnestly\r\nput forth heretofore, do not strike us with great power, at the present\r\nday, if we stand on the shores of Lake Erie, and see hundreds of\r\nvessels, with valuable cargoes and thousands of valuable lives, moving\r\non its waters, with few shelters from the storm, except what is\r\nfurnished by the havens created, or made useful, by the aid of\r\ngovernment. These great lakes, stretching away many thousands of miles,\r\nnot in a straight line, but with turns and deflections, as if designed\r\nto reach, by water communication, the greatest possible number of\r\nimportant points through a region of vast extent, cannot but arrest the\r\nattention of any one who looks upon the map. They lie connected, but\r\nvariously placed; and interspersed, as if with studied variety of form\r\nand direction, over that part of the country. They were made for man,\r\nand admirably adapted for his use and convenience. Looking, Gentlemen,\r\nover our whole country, comprehending in our survey the Atlantic coast,\r\nwith its thick population, its advanced agriculture, its extended\r\ncommerce, its manufactures and mechanic arts, its varieties of\r\ncommunication, its wealth, and its general improvements; and looking,\r\nthen, to the interior, to the immense tracts of fresh, fertile, and\r\ncheap lands, bounded by so many lakes, and watered by so many\r\nmagnificent rivers, let me ask if such a MAP was ever before presented\r\nto the eye of any statesman, as the theatre for the exercise of his\r\nwisdom and patriotism? And let me ask, too, if any man is fit to act a\r\npart, on such a theatre, who does not comprehend the whole of it within\r\nthe scope of his policy, and embrace it all as his country?\r\n\r\nAgain, Gentlemen, we are one in respect to the glorious Constitution\r\nunder which we live. We are all united in the great brotherhood of\r\nAmerican liberty. Descending from the same ancestors, bred in the same\r\nschool, taught in infancy to imbibe the same general political\r\nsentiments, Americans all, by birth, education, and principle, what but\r\na narrow mind, or woful ignorance, or besotted selfishness, or prejudice\r\nten times blinded, can lead any of us to regard the citizens of any part\r\nof the country as strangers and aliens?\r\n\r\nThe solemn truth, moreover, is before us, that a common political fate\r\nattends us all.\r\n\r\nUnder the present Constitution, wisely and conscientiously administered,\r\nall are safe, happy, and renowned. The measure of our country's fame may\r\nfill all our breasts. It is fame enough for us all to partake in _her_\r\nglory, if we will carry her character onward to its true destiny. But if\r\nthe system is broken, its fragments must fall alike on all. Not only the\r\ncause of American liberty, but the grand cause of liberty throughout the\r\nwhole earth, depends, in a great measure, on upholding the Constitution\r\nand Union of these States. If shattered and destroyed, no matter by what\r\ncause, the peculiar and cherished idea of United American Liberty will\r\nbe no more for ever. There may be free states, it is possible, when\r\nthere shall be separate states. There may be many loose, and feeble, and\r\nhostile confederacies, where there is now one great and united\r\nconfederacy. But the noble idea of United American Liberty, of _our_\r\nliberty, such as our fathers established it, will be extinguished for\r\never. Fragments and shattered columns of the edifice may be found\r\nremaining; and melancholy and mournful ruins will they be. The august\r\ntemple itself will be prostrate in the dust. Gentlemen, the citizens of\r\nthis republic cannot sever their fortunes. A common fate awaits us. In\r\nthe honor of upholding, or in the disgrace of undermining the\r\nConstitution, we shall all necessarily partake. Let us then stand by the\r\nConstitution as it is, and by our country as it is, one, united, and\r\nentire; let it be a truth engraven on our hearts, let it be borne on the\r\nflag under which we rally, in every exigency, that we have ONE COUNTRY,\r\nONE CONSTITUTION, ONE DESTINY.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, of our interior administration, the public lands constitute a\r\nhighly important part. This is a subject of great interest, and it ought\r\nto attract much more attention than it has hitherto received, especially\r\nfrom the people of the Atlantic States. The public lands are public\r\nproperty. They belong to the people of all the States. A vast portion of\r\nthem is composed of territories which were ceded by individual States to\r\nthe United States, after the close of the Revolutionary war, and before\r\nthe adoption of the present Constitution. The history of these cessions,\r\nand the reasons for making them, are familiar to you. Some of the Old\r\nThirteen possessed large tracts of unsettled lands within their\r\nchartered limits. The Revolution had established their title to these\r\nlands, and as the Revolution had been brought about by the common\r\ntreasure and the common blood of all the Colonies, it was thought not\r\nunreasonable that these unsettled lands should be transferred to the\r\nUnited States, to pay the debt created by the war, and afterwards to\r\nremain as a fund for the use of all the States. This is the well-known\r\norigin of the title possessed by the United States to lands northwest of\r\nthe River Ohio.\r\n\r\nBy treaties with France and Spain, Louisiana and Florida, containing\r\nmany millions of acres of public land, have been since acquired. The\r\ncost of these acquisitions was paid, of course, by the general\r\ngovernment, and was thus a charge upon the whole people. The public\r\nlands, therefore, all and singular, are national property; granted to\r\nthe United States, purchased by the United States, paid for by all the\r\npeople of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe idea, that, when a new State is created, the public lands lying\r\nwithin her territory become the property of such new State in\r\nconsequence of her sovereignty, is too preposterous for serious\r\nrefutation. Such notions have heretofore been advanced in Congress, but\r\nnobody has sustained them. They were rejected and abandoned, although\r\none cannot say whether they may not be revived, in consequence of recent\r\npropositions which have been made in the Senate. The new States are\r\nadmitted on express conditions, recognizing, to the fullest extent, the\r\nright of the United States to the public lands within their borders; and\r\nit is no more reasonable to contend that some indefinite idea of State\r\nsovereignty overrides all these stipulations, and makes the lands the\r\nproperty of the States, against the provisions and conditions of their\r\nown constitution, and the Constitution of the United States, than it\r\nwould be, that a similar doctrine entitled the State of New York to the\r\nmoney collected at the custom-house in this city; since it is no more\r\ninconsistent with sovereignty that one government should hold lands, for\r\nthe purpose of sale, within the territory of another, than it is that it\r\nshould lay and collect taxes and duties within such territory. Whatever\r\nextravagant pretensions may have been set up heretofore, there was not,\r\nI suppose, an enlightened man in the whole West, who insisted on any\r\nsuch right in the States, when the proposition to cede the lands to the\r\nStates was made, in the late session of Congress. The public lands\r\nbeing, therefore, the common property of all the people of all the\r\nStates, I shall never consent to give them away to particular States, or\r\nto dispose of them otherwise than for the general good, and the general\r\nuse of the whole country.\r\n\r\nI felt bound, therefore, on the occasion just alluded to, to resist at\r\nthe threshold a proposition to cede the public lands to the States in\r\nwhich they lie, on certain conditions. I very much regretted the\r\nintroduction of such a measure, as its effect must be, I fear, only to\r\nagitate what was well settled, and to disturb that course of proceeding,\r\nin regard to the public lands, which forty years of experience have\r\nshown to be so wise, and so satisfactory in its operation, both to the\r\npeople of the old States and to those of the new.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, although the public lands are not to be given away, nor\r\nceded to particular States, a very liberal policy in regard to them\r\nought certainly to prevail. Such a policy has prevailed, and I have\r\nsteadily supported it, and shall continue to support it so long as I may\r\nremain in public life. The main object, in regard to these lands, is\r\nundoubtedly to settle them, so fast as the growth of our population, and\r\nits augmentation by emigration, may enable us to settle them.\r\n\r\nThe lands, therefore, should be sold, at a low price; and, for one, I\r\nhave never doubted the right or expediency of granting portions of the\r\nlands themselves, or of making grants of money for objects of internal\r\nimprovement connected with them.\r\n\r\nI have always supported liberal appropriations for the purpose of\r\nopening communications to and through these lands, by common roads,\r\ncanals, and railroads; and where lands of little value have been long in\r\nmarket, and, on account of their indifferent quality, are not likely to\r\ncommand a common price, I know no objection to a reduction of price, as\r\nto such lands, so that they may pass into private ownership. Nor do I\r\nfeel any objections to removing those restraints which prevent the\r\nStates from taxing the lands for five years after they are sold. But\r\nwhile, in these and all other respects, I am not only reconciled to a\r\nliberal policy, but espouse it and support it, and have constantly done\r\nso, I still hold the national domain to be the general property of the\r\ncountry, confined to the care of Congress, and which Congress is\r\nsolemnly bound to protect and preserve for the common good.\r\n\r\nThe benefit derived from the public lands, after all, is, and must be,\r\nin the greatest degree, enjoyed by those who buy them and settle upon\r\nthem. The original price paid to government constitutes but a small part\r\nof their actual value. Their immediate rise in value, in the hands of\r\nthe settler, gives him competence. He exercises a power of selection\r\nover a vast region of fertile territory, all on sale at the same price,\r\nand that price an exceedingly low one. Selection is no sooner made,\r\ncultivation is no sooner begun, and the first furrow turned, than he\r\nalready finds himself a man of property. These are the advantages of\r\nWestern emigrants and Western settlers; and they are such, certainly, as\r\nno country on earth ever before afforded to her citizens. This\r\nopportunity of purchase and settlement, this certainty of enhanced\r\nvalue, these sure means of immediate competence and ultimate\r\nwealth,--all these are the rights and the blessings of the people of the\r\nWest, and they have my hearty wishes for their full and perfect\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nI desire to see the public lands cultivated and occupied. I desire the\r\ngrowth and prosperity of the West, and the fullest development of its\r\nvast and extraordinary resources. I wish to bring it near to us, by\r\nevery species of useful communication. I see, not without admiration and\r\namazement, but yet without envy or jealousy, States of recent origin\r\nalready containing more people than Massachusetts. These people I know\r\nto be part of ourselves; they have proceeded from the midst of us, and\r\nwe may trust that they are not likely to separate themselves, in\r\ninterest or in feeling, from their kindred, whom they have left on the\r\nfarms and around the hearths of their common fathers.\r\n\r\nA liberal policy, a sympathy with its interests, an enlightened and\r\ngenerous feeling of participation in its prosperity, are due to the\r\nWest, and will be met, I doubt not, by a return of sentiments equally\r\ncordial and equally patriotic.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the general question of revenue is very much connected with\r\nthis subject of the public lands, and I will therefore, in a very few\r\nwords, express my views on that point.\r\n\r\nThe revenue involves, not only the supply of the treasury with money,\r\nbut the question of protection to manufactures. On these connected\r\nsubjects, therefore, Gentlemen, as I have promised to keep nothing back,\r\nI will state my opinions plainly, but very shortly.\r\n\r\nI am in favor of such a revenue as shall be equal to all the just and\r\nreasonable wants of the government; and I am decidedly opposed to all\r\ncollection or accumulation of revenue beyond this point. An extravagant\r\ngovernment expenditure, and unnecessary accumulation in the treasury,\r\nare both, of all things, to be most studiously avoided.\r\n\r\nI am in favor of protecting American industry and labor, not only as\r\nemployed in large manufactories, but also, and more especially, as\r\nemployed in the various mechanic arts, carried on by persons of small\r\ncapitals, and living by the earnings of their own personal industry.\r\nEvery city in the Union, and none more than this, would feel severely\r\nthe consequences of departing from the ancient and continued policy of\r\nthe government respecting this last branch of protection. If duties were\r\nto be abolished on hats, boots, shoes, and other articles of leather,\r\nand on the articles fabricated of brass, tin, and iron, and on\r\nready-made clothes, carriages, furniture, and many similar articles,\r\nthousands of persons would be immediately thrown out of employment in\r\nthis city, and in other parts of the Union. Protection, in this respect,\r\nof our own labor against the cheaper, ill-paid, half-fed, and pauper\r\nlabor of Europe, is, in my opinion, a duty which the country owes to its\r\nown citizens. I am, therefore, decidedly for protecting our own industry\r\nand our own labor.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, Gentlemen, I am of opinion, that, with no more than\r\nusual skill in the application of the well-tried principles of\r\ndiscriminating and specific duties, all the branches of national\r\nindustry may be protected, without imposing such duties on imports as\r\nshall overcharge the treasury.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the revenues arising from the sales of the public lands, I am\r\nof opinion that they ought to be set apart for the use of the States.\r\nThe States need the money. The government of the United States does not\r\nneed it. Many of the States have contracted large debts for objects of\r\ninternal improvement, and others of them have important objects which\r\nthey would wish to accomplish. The lands were originally granted for the\r\nuse of the several States; and now that their proceeds are not necessary\r\nfor the purposes of the general government, I am of opinion that they\r\nshould go to the States, and to the people of the States, upon an equal\r\nprinciple. Set apart, then, the proceeds of the public lands for the use\r\nof the States; supply the treasury from duties on imports; apply to\r\nthese duties a just and careful discrimination, in favor of articles\r\nproduced at home by our own labor, and thus support, to a fair extent,\r\nour own manufactures. These, Gentlemen, appear to me to be the general\r\noutlines of that policy which the present condition of the country\r\nrequires us to adopt.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, proposing to express opinions on the principal subjects of\r\ninterest at the present moment, it is impossible to overlook the\r\ndelicate question which has arisen from events which have happened in\r\nthe late Mexican province of Texas. The independence of that province\r\nhas now been recognized by the government of the United States. Congress\r\ngave the President the means, to be used when he saw fit, of opening a\r\ndiplomatic intercourse with its government, and the late President\r\nimmediately made use of those means.\r\n\r\nI saw no objection, under the circumstances, to voting an appropriation\r\nto be used when the President should think the proper time had come; and\r\nhe deemed, very promptly, it is true, that the time had already arrived.\r\nCertainly, Gentlemen, the history of Texas is not a little wonderful. A\r\nvery few people, in a very short time, have established a government for\r\nthemselves, against the authority of the parent state; and this\r\ngovernment, it is generally supposed, there is little probability, at\r\nthe present moment, of the parent state being able to overturn.\r\n\r\nThis government is, in form, a copy of our own. It is an American\r\nconstitution, substantially after the great American model. We all,\r\ntherefore, must wish it success; and there is no one who will more\r\nheartily rejoice than I shall, to see an independent community,\r\nintelligent, industrious, and friendly towards us, springing up, and\r\nrising into happiness, distinction, and power, upon our own principles\r\nof liberty and government.\r\n\r\nBut it cannot be disguised, Gentlemen, that a desire, or an intention,\r\nis already manifested to annex Texas to the United States. On a subject\r\nof such mighty magnitude as this, and at a moment when the public\r\nattention is drawn to it, I should feel myself wanting in candor, if I\r\ndid not express my opinion; since all must suppose that, on such a\r\nquestion, it is impossible that I should be without some opinion.\r\n\r\nI say then, Gentlemen, in all frankness, that I see objections, I think\r\ninsurmountable objections, to the annexation of Texas to the United\r\nStates. When the Constitution was formed, it is not probable that either\r\nits framers or the people ever looked to the admission of any States\r\ninto the Union, except such as then already existed, and such as should\r\nbe formed out of territories then already belonging to the United\r\nStates. Fifteen years after the adoption of the Constitution, however,\r\nthe case of Louisiana arose. Louisiana was obtained by treaty with\r\nFrance, who had recently obtained it from Spain; but the object of this\r\nacquisition, certainly, was not mere extension of territory. Other great\r\npolitical interests were connected with it. Spain, while she possessed\r\nLouisiana, had held the mouths of the great rivers which rise in the\r\nWestern States, and flow into the Gulf of Mexico. She had disputed our\r\nuse of these rivers already, and with a powerful nation in possession of\r\nthese outlets to the sea, it is obvious that the commerce of all the\r\nWest was in danger of perpetual vexation. The command of these rivers to\r\nthe sea was, therefore, the great object aimed at in the acquisition of\r\nLouisiana. But that acquisition necessarily brought territory along with\r\nit, and three States now exist, formed out of that ancient province.\r\n\r\nA similar policy, and a similar necessity, though perhaps not entirely\r\nso urgent, led to the acquisition of Florida.\r\n\r\nNow, no such necessity, no such policy, requires the annexation of\r\nTexas. The accession of Texas to our territory is not necessary to the\r\nfull and complete enjoyment of all which we already possess. Her case,\r\ntherefore, stands upon a footing entirely different from that of\r\nLouisiana and Florida. There being no necessity for extending the limits\r\nof the Union in that direction, we ought, I think, for numerous and\r\npowerful reasons, to be content with our present boundaries.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, we all see that, by whomsoever possessed, Texas is likely to\r\nbe a slave-holding country; and I frankly avow my entire unwillingness\r\nto do anything that shall extend the slavery of the African race on this\r\ncontinent, or add other slave-holding States to the Union. When I say\r\nthat I regard slavery in itself as a great moral, social, and political\r\nevil, I only use language which has been adopted by distinguished men,\r\nthemselves citizens of slave-holding States. I shall do nothing,\r\ntherefore, to favor or encourage its further extension. We have slavery\r\nalready amongst us. The Constitution found it in the Union; it\r\nrecognized it, and gave it solemn guaranties. To the full extent of\r\nthese guaranties we are all bound, in honor, in justice, and by the\r\nConstitution. All the stipulations contained in the Constitution in\r\nfavor of the slave-holding States which are already in the Union ought\r\nto be fulfilled, and, so far as depends on me, shall be fulfilled, in\r\nthe fulness of their spirit and to the exactness of their letter.\r\nSlavery, as it exists in the States, is beyond the reach of Congress. It\r\nis a concern of the States themselves; they have never submitted it to\r\nCongress, and Congress has no rightful power over it. I shall concur,\r\ntherefore, in no act, no measure, no menace, no indication of purpose,\r\nwhich shall interfere or threaten to interfere with the exclusive\r\nauthority of the several States over the subject of slavery as it exists\r\nwithin their respective limits. All this appears to me to be matter of\r\nplain and imperative duty.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to speak of admitting new States, the subject assumes\r\nan entirely different aspect. Our rights and our duties are then both\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nThe free States, and all the States, are then at liberty to accept or to\r\nreject. When it is proposed to bring new members into this political\r\npartnership, the old members have a right to say on what terms such new\r\npartners are to come in, and what they are to bring along with them. In\r\nmy opinion, the people of the United States will not consent to bring\r\ninto the Union a new, vastly extensive, and slave-holding country, large\r\nenough for half a dozen or a dozen States. In my opinion, they ought not\r\nto consent to it. Indeed, I am altogether at a loss to conceive what\r\npossible benefit any part of this country can expect to derive from such\r\nannexation. Any benefit to any part is at least doubtful and uncertain;\r\nthe objections are obvious, plain, and strong. On the general question\r\nof slavery, a great portion of the community is already strongly\r\nexcited. The subject has not only attracted attention as a question of\r\npolitics, but it has struck a far deeper-toned chord. It has arrested\r\nthe religious feeling of the country; it has taken strong hold on the\r\nconsciences of men. He is a rash man indeed, and little conversant with\r\nhuman nature, and especially has he a very erroneous estimate of the\r\ncharacter of the people of this country, who supposes that a feeling of\r\nthis kind is to be trifled with or despised. It will assuredly cause\r\nitself to be respected. It may be reasoned with, it may be made willing,\r\nI believe it is entirely willing, to fulfil all existing engagements and\r\nall existing duties, to uphold and defend the Constitution as it is\r\nestablished, with whatever regrets about some provisions which it does\r\nactually contain. But to coerce it into silence, to endeavor to restrain\r\nits free expression, to seek to compress and confine it, warm as it is,\r\nand more heated as such endeavors would inevitably render it,--should\r\nthis be attempted, I know nothing, even in the Constitution or in the\r\nUnion itself, which would not be endangered by the explosion which might\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nI see, therefore, no political necessity for the annexation of Texas to\r\nthe Union; no advantages to be derived from it; and objections to it of\r\na strong, and, in my judgment, decisive character.\r\n\r\nI believe it to be for the interest and happiness of the whole Union to\r\nremain as it is, without diminution and without addition.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I pass to other subjects. The rapid advancement of the\r\nexecutive authority is a topic which has already been alluded to.\r\n\r\nI believe there is serious cause of alarm from this source. I believe\r\nthe power of the executive has increased, is increasing, and ought now\r\nto be brought back within its ancient constitutional limits. I have\r\nnothing to do with the motives which have led to those acts, which I\r\nbelieve to have transcended the boundaries of the Constitution. Good\r\nmotives may always be assumed, as bad motives may always be imputed.\r\nGood intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption of power;\r\nbut they cannot justify it, even if we were sure that they existed. It\r\nis hardly too strong to say, that the Constitution was made to guard the\r\npeople against the dangers of good intention, real or pretended. When\r\nbad intentions are boldly avowed, the people will promptly take care of\r\nthemselves. On the other hand, they will always be asked why they should\r\nresist or question that exercise of power which is so fair in its\r\nobject, so plausible and patriotic in appearance, and which has the\r\npublic good alone confessedly in view? Human beings, we may be assured,\r\nwill generally exercise power when they can get it; and they will\r\nexercise it most undoubtedly, in popular governments, under pretences of\r\npublic safety or high public interest. It may be very possible that good\r\nintentions do really sometimes exist when constitutional restraints are\r\ndisregarded. There are men, in all ages, who mean to exercise power\r\nusefully; but who mean to exercise it. They mean to govern well; but\r\nthey mean to govern. They promise to be kind masters; but they mean to\r\nbe masters. They think there need be but little restraint upon\r\nthemselves. Their notion of the public interest is apt to be quite\r\nclosely connected with their own exercise of authority. They may not,\r\nindeed, always understand their own motives. The love of power may sink\r\ntoo deep in their own hearts even for their own scrutiny, and may pass\r\nwith themselves for mere patriotism and benevolence.\r\n\r\nA character has been drawn of a very eminent citizen of Massachusetts,\r\nof the last age, which, though I think it does not entirely belong to\r\nhim, yet very well describes a certain class of public men. It was said\r\nof this distinguished son of Massachusetts, that in matters of politics\r\nand government he cherished the most kind and benevolent feelings\r\ntowards the whole earth. He earnestly desired to see all nations well\r\ngoverned; and to bring about this happy result, he wished that the\r\nUnited States might govern the rest of the world; that Massachusetts\r\nmight govern the United States; that Boston might govern Massachusetts;\r\nand as for himself, his own humble ambition would be satisfied by\r\ngoverning the little town of Boston.\r\n\r\nI do not intend, Gentlemen, to commit so unreasonable a trespass on your\r\npatience as to discuss all those cases in which I think executive power\r\nhas been unreasonably extended. I shall only allude to some of them,\r\nand, as being earliest in the order of time, and hardly second to any\r\nother in importance, I mention the practice of removal from all offices,\r\nhigh and low, for opinion's sake, and on the avowed ground of giving\r\npatronage to the President; that is to say, of giving him the power of\r\ninfluencing men's political opinions and political conduct, by hopes and\r\nby fears addressed directly to their pecuniary interests. The great\r\nbattle on this point was fought, and was lost, in the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, in the last session of Congress under Mr. Adams's\r\nadministration. After General Jackson was known to be elected, and\r\nbefore his term of office began, many important offices became vacant by\r\nthe usual causes of death and resignation. Mr. Adams, of course,\r\nnominated persons to fill these vacant offices. But a majority of the\r\nSenate was composed of the friends of General Jackson; and, instead of\r\nacting on these nominations, and filling the vacant offices with\r\nordinary promptitude, the nominations were postponed to a day beyond the\r\n4th of March, for the purpose, openly avowed, of giving the patronage of\r\nthe appointments to the President who was then coming into office. When\r\nthe new President entered on his office, he withdrew these nominations,\r\nand sent in nominations of his own friends in their places. I was of\r\nopinion then, and am of opinion now, that that decision of the Senate\r\nwent far to unfix the proper balance of the government. It conferred on\r\nthe President the power of rewards for party purposes, or personal\r\npurposes, without limit or control. It sanctioned, manifestly and\r\nplainly, that exercise of power which Mr. Madison had said would deserve\r\nimpeachment; and it completely defeated one great object, which we are\r\ntold the framers of the Constitution contemplated, in the manner of\r\nforming the Senate; that is, that the Senate might be a body not\r\nchanging with the election of a President, and therefore likely to be\r\nable to hold over him some check or restraint in regard to bringing his\r\nown friends and partisans into power with him, and thus rewarding their\r\nservices to him at the public expense.\r\n\r\nThe debates in the Senate, on these questions, were long continued and\r\nearnest. They were of course in secret session, but the opinions of\r\nthose members who opposed this course have all been proved true by the\r\nresult. The contest was severe and ardent, as much so as any that I have\r\never partaken in; and I have seen some service in that sort of warfare.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, when I look back to that eventful moment, when I remember who\r\nthose were who upheld this claim for executive power, with so much zeal\r\nand devotion, as well as with such great and splendid abilities, and\r\nwhen I look round now, and inquire what has become of these gentlemen,\r\nwhere they have found themselves at last, under the power which they\r\nthus helped to establish, what has become now of all their respect,\r\ntrust, confidence, and attachment,--how many of them, indeed, have not\r\nescaped from being broken and crushed under the weight of the wheels of\r\nthat engine which they themselves set in motion,--I feel that an\r\nedifying lesson may be read by those who, in the freshness and fulness\r\nof party zeal, are ready to confer the most dangerous power, in the hope\r\nthat they and their friends may bask in its sunshine, while enemies only\r\nshall be withered by its frown.\r\n\r\nI will not go into the mention of names. I will give no enumeration of\r\npersons; but I ask you to turn your minds back, and recollect who the\r\ndistinguished men were who supported, in the Senate, General Jackson's\r\nadministration for the first two years; and I will ask you what you\r\nsuppose they think now of that power and that discretion which they so\r\nfreely confided to executive hands. What do they think of the whole\r\ncareer of that administration, the commencement of which, and indeed the\r\nexistence of which, owed so much to their own great exertions?\r\n\r\nIn addition to the establishment of this power of unlimited and\r\ncauseless removal, another doctrine has been put forth, more vague, it\r\nis true, but altogether unconstitutional, and tending to like dangerous\r\nresults. In some loose, indefinite, and unknown sense, the President has\r\nbeen called the _representative of the whole American people_. He has\r\ncalled himself so repeatedly, and been so denominated by his friends a\r\nthousand times. Acts, for which no specific authority has been found\r\neither in the Constitution or the laws, have been justified on the\r\nground that the President is the representative of the whole American\r\npeople. Certainly, this is not constitutional language. Certainly, the\r\nConstitution nowhere calls the President the universal representative of\r\nthe people. The constitutional representatives of the people are in the\r\nHouse of Representatives, exercising powers of legislation. The\r\nPresident is an executive officer, appointed in a particular manner, and\r\nclothed with prescribed and limited powers. It may be thought to be of\r\nno great consequence, that the President should call himself, or that\r\nothers should call him, the sole representative of all the people,\r\nalthough he has no such appellation or character in the Constitution.\r\nBut, in these matters, words are things. If he is the people's\r\nrepresentative, and as such may exercise power, without any other grant,\r\nwhat is the limit to that power? And what may not an unlimited\r\nrepresentative of the people do? When the Constitution expressly creates\r\nrepresentatives, as members of Congress, it regulates, defines, and\r\nlimits their authority. But if the executive chief magistrate, merely\r\nbecause he is the executive chief magistrate, may assume to himself\r\nanother character, and call himself the representative of the whole\r\npeople, what is to limit or restrain this representative power in his\r\nhands?\r\n\r\nI fear, Gentlemen, that if these pretensions should be continued and\r\njustified, we might have many instances of summary political logic, such\r\nas I once heard in the House of Representatives. A gentleman, not now\r\nliving, wished very much to vote for the establishment of a Bank of the\r\nUnited States, but he had always stoutly denied the constitutional power\r\nof Congress to create such a bank. The country, however, was in a state\r\nof great financial distress, from which such an institution, it was\r\nhoped, might help to extricate it; and this consideration led the worthy\r\nmember to review his opinions with care and deliberation. Happily, on\r\nsuch careful and deliberate review, he altered his former judgment. He\r\ncame, satisfactorily, to the conclusion that Congress might incorporate\r\na bank. The argument which brought his mind to this result was short,\r\nand so plain and obvious, that he wondered how he should so long have\r\noverlooked it. The power, he said, to create a bank, was either given to\r\nCongress, or it was not given. Very well. If it was given, Congress of\r\ncourse could exercise it; if it was not given, the people still retained\r\nit, and in that case, Congress, as the representatives of the people,\r\nmight, upon an emergency, make free to use it.\r\n\r\nArguments and conclusions in substance like these, Gentlemen, will not\r\nbe wanting, if men of great popularity, commanding characters, sustained\r\nby powerful parties, _and full of good intentions towards the public_,\r\nmay be permitted to call themselves the universal representatives of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, it is the _currency_, the currency of the country,--it\r\nis this great subject, so interesting, so vital, to all classes of the\r\ncommunity, which has been destined to feel the most violent assaults of\r\nexecutive power. The consequences are around us and upon us. Not\r\nunforeseen, not unforetold, here they come, bringing distress for the\r\npresent, and fear and alarm for the future. If it be denied that the\r\npresent condition of things has arisen from the President's interference\r\nwith the revenue, the first answer is, that, when he did interfere, just\r\nsuch consequences were predicted. It was then said, and repeated, and\r\npressed upon the public attention, that that interference must\r\nnecessarily produce derangement, embarrassment, loss of confidence, and\r\ncommercial distress. I pray you, Gentlemen, to recur to the debates of\r\n1832, 1833, and 1834, and then to decide whose opinions have proved to\r\nbe correct. When the treasury experiment was first announced, who\r\nsupported, and who opposed it? Who warned the country against it? Who\r\nwere they who endeavored to stay the violence of party, to arrest the\r\nhand of executive authority, and to convince the people that this\r\nexperiment was delusive; that its object was merely to increase\r\nexecutive power, and that its effect, sooner or later, must be injurious\r\nand ruinous? Gentlemen, it is fair to bring the opinions of political\r\nmen to the test of experience. It is just to judge of them by their\r\nmeasures, and their opposition to measures; and for myself, and those\r\npolitical friends with whom I have acted, on this subject of the\r\ncurrency, I am ready to abide the test.\r\n\r\nBut before the subject of the currency, and its present most\r\nembarrassing state, is discussed, I invite your attention, Gentlemen, to\r\nthe history of executive proceedings connected with it. I propose to\r\nstate to you a series of facts; not to argue upon them, not to _mystify_\r\nthem, nor to draw any unjust inference from them; but merely to state\r\nthe case, in the plainest manner, as I understand it. And I wish,\r\nGentlemen, that, in order to be able to do this in the best and most\r\nconvincing manner, I had the ability of my learned friend, (Mr. Ogden,)\r\nwhom you have all so often heard, and who usually states his case in\r\nsuch a manner that, when stated, it is already very well argued.\r\n\r\nLet us see, Gentlemen, what the train of occurrences has been in regard\r\nto our revenue and finances; and when these occurrences are stated, I\r\nleave to every man the right to decide for himself whether our present\r\ndifficulties have or have not arisen from attempts to extend the\r\nexecutive authority. In giving this detail, I shall be compelled to\r\nspeak of the late Bank of the United States; but I shall speak of it\r\nhistorically only. My opinion of its utility, and of the extraordinary\r\nability and success with which its affairs were conducted for many years\r\nbefore the termination of its charter, is well known. I have often\r\nexpressed it, and I have not altered it. But at present I speak of the\r\nbank only as it makes a necessary part in the history of events which I\r\nwish now to recapitulate.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams commenced his administration in March, 1825. He had been\r\nelected by the House of Representatives, and began his career as\r\nPresident under a powerful opposition. From the very first day, he was\r\nwarmly, even violently, opposed in all his measures; and this\r\nopposition, as we all know, continued without abatement, either in force\r\nor asperity, through his whole term of four years. Gentlemen, I am not\r\nabout to say whether this opposition was well or ill founded, just or\r\nunjust. I only state the fact as connected with other facts. The Bank of\r\nthe United States, during these four years of Mr. Adams's\r\nadministration, was in full operation. It was performing the fiscal\r\nduties enjoined on it by its charter; it had established numerous\r\noffices, was maintaining a large circulation, and transacting a vast\r\nbusiness in exchange. Its character, conduct, and manner of\r\nadministration were all well known to the whole country.\r\n\r\nNow there are two or three things worthy of especial notice. One is,\r\nthat during the whole of this heated political controversy, from 1825 to\r\n1829, the party which was endeavoring to produce a change of\r\nadministration in the general government brought no charge of political\r\ninterference against the Bank of the United States. If any thing, it was\r\nrather a favorite with that party generally. Certainly, the party, as a\r\nparty, did not ascribe to it undue attachment to other parties, or to\r\nthe then existing administration. Another important fact is, that,\r\nduring the whole of the same period, those who had espoused the cause of\r\nGeneral Jackson, and who sought to bring about a revolution under his\r\nname, did not propose the destruction of the bank, or its\r\ndiscontinuance, as one of the objects which were to be accomplished by\r\nthe intended revolution. They did not tell the country that the bank was\r\nunconstitutional; they did not declare it unnecessary; they did not\r\npropose to get along without it, when they should come into power\r\nthemselves. If individuals entertained any such purposes, they kept them\r\nmuch to themselves. The party, as a party, avowed none such. A third\r\nfact, worthy of all notice, is, that during this period there was no\r\ncomplaint about the state of the currency, either by the country\r\ngenerally or by the party then in opposition.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1829, General Jackson was inaugurated as President. He came\r\ninto power on professions of reform. He announced reform of all abuses\r\nto be the great and leading object of his future administration; and in\r\nhis inaugural address he pointed out the main subjects of this reform.\r\nBut the bank was not one of them. It was not said by him that the bank\r\nwas unconstitutional. It was not said that it was unnecessary or\r\nuseless. It was not said that it had failed to do all that had been\r\nhoped or expected from it in regard to the currency.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1829, then, the bank stood well, very well, with the new\r\nadministration. It was regarded, so far as appears, as entirely\r\nconstitutional, free from political or party taint, and highly useful.\r\nIt had as yet found no place in the catalogue of abuses to be reformed.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, nine months wrought a wonderful change. New lights broke\r\nforth before these months had rolled away; and the President, in his\r\nmessage to Congress in December, 1829, held a very unaccustomed language\r\nand manifested very unexpected purposes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the bank had then five or six years of its charter unexpired,\r\nhe yet called the attention of Congress very pointedly to the subject,\r\nand declared,--\r\n\r\n1. That the constitutionality of the bank was well doubted by many;\r\n\r\n2. That its utility or expediency was also well doubted;\r\n\r\n3. That all must admit that it had failed to establish or maintain a\r\nsound and uniform currency; and\r\n\r\n4. That the true bank for the use of the government of the United States\r\nwould be a bank which should be founded on the revenues and credit of\r\nthe government itself.\r\n\r\nThese propositions appeared to me, at the time, as very extraordinary,\r\nand the last one as very startling. A bank founded on the revenue and\r\ncredit of the government, and managed and administered by the executive,\r\nwas a conception which I had supposed no man holding the chief executive\r\npower in his own hands would venture to put forth.\r\n\r\nBut the question now is, what had wrought this great change of feeling\r\nand of purpose in regard to the bank. What events had occurred between\r\nMarch and December that should have caused the bank, so constitutional,\r\nso useful, so peaceful, and so safe an institution, in the first of\r\nthese months, to start up into the character of a monster, and become so\r\nhorrid and dangerous, in the last?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, let us see what the events were which had intervened. General\r\nJackson was elected in December, 1828. His term was to begin in March,\r\n1829. A session of Congress took place, therefore, between his election\r\nand the commencement of his administration.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, the truth is, that during this session, and a little\r\nbefore the commencement of the new administration, a disposition was\r\nmanifested by political men to interfere with the management of the\r\nbank. Members of Congress undertook to nominate or recommend individuals\r\nas directors in the branches or offices of the bank. They were kind\r\nenough, sometimes, to make out whole lists, or tickets, and to send them\r\nto Philadelphia, containing the names of those whose appointments would\r\nbe satisfactory to General Jackson's friends. Portions of the\r\ncorrespondence on these subjects have been published in some of the\r\nvoluminous reports and other documents connected with the bank, but\r\nperhaps have not been generally heeded or noticed. At first, the bank\r\nmerely declined, as gently as possible, complying with these and similar\r\nrequests. But like applications began to show themselves from many\r\nquarters, and a very marked case arose as early as June, 1829. Certain\r\nmembers of the Legislature of New Hampshire applied for a change in the\r\npresidency of the branch which was established in that State. A member\r\nof the Senate of the United States wrote both to the president of the\r\nbank and to the Secretary of the Treasury, strongly recommending a\r\nchange, and in his letter to the Secretary hinting very distinctly at\r\npolitical considerations as the ground of the movement. Other officers\r\nin the service of the government took an interest in the matter, and\r\nurged a change; and the Secretary himself wrote to the bank, suggesting\r\nand recommending it. The time had come, then, for the bank to take its\r\nposition. It did take it; and, in my judgment, if it had not acted as it\r\ndid act, not only would those who had the care of it have been most\r\nhighly censurable, but a claim would have been yielded to, entirely\r\ninconsistent with a government of laws, and subversive of the very\r\nfoundations of republicanism.\r\n\r\nA long correspondence between the Secretary of the Treasury and the\r\npresident of the bank ensued. The directors determined that they would\r\nnot surrender either their rights or their duties to the control or\r\nsupervision of the executive government. They said they had never\r\nappointed directors of their branches on political grounds, and they\r\nwould not remove them on such grounds. They had avoided politics. They\r\nhad sought for men of business, capacity, fidelity, and experience in\r\nthe management of pecuniary concerns. They owed duties, they said, to\r\nthe government, which they meant to perform, faithfully and impartially,\r\nunder all administrations; and they owed duties to the stockholders of\r\nthe bank, which required them to disregard political considerations in\r\ntheir appointments. This correspondence ran along into the fall of the\r\nyear, and finally terminated in a stern and unanimous declaration, made\r\nby the directors, and transmitted to the Secretary of the Treasury, that\r\nthe bank would continue to be independently administered, and that the\r\ndirectors once for all refused to submit to the supervision of the\r\nexecutive authority, in any of its branches, in the appointment of local\r\ndirectors and agents. This resolution decided the character of the\r\nfuture. Hostility towards the bank, thenceforward, became the settled\r\npolicy of the government; and the message of December, 1829, was the\r\nclear announcement of that policy. If the bank had appointed those\r\ndirectors, thus recommended by members of Congress; if it had submitted\r\nall its appointments to the supervision of the treasury; if it had\r\nremoved the president of the New Hampshire branch; if it had, in all\r\nthings, showed itself a complying, political, party machine, instead of\r\nan independent institution;--if it had done this, I leave all men to\r\njudge whether such an entire change of opinion, as to its\r\nconstitutionality, its utility, and its good effects on the currency,\r\nwould have happened between March and December.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment in which the bank asserted its independence of treasury\r\ncontrol, and its elevation above mere party purposes, down to the end of\r\nits charter, and down even to the present day, it has been the subject\r\nto which the selectest phrases of party denunciation have been\r\nplentifully applied.\r\n\r\nBut Congress manifested no disposition to establish a treasury bank. On\r\nthe contrary, it was satisfied, and so was the country, most\r\nunquestionably, with the bank then existing. In the summer of 1832,\r\nCongress passed an act for continuing the charter of the bank, by strong\r\nmajorities in both houses. In the House of Representatives, I think, two\r\nthirds of the members voted for the bill. The President gave it his\r\nnegative; and as there were not two thirds of the Senate, though a large\r\nmajority were for it, the bill failed to become a law.\r\n\r\nBut it was not enough that a continuance of the charter of the bank was\r\nthus refused. It had the deposit of the public money, and this it was\r\nentitled to, by law, for the few years which yet remained of its\r\nchartered term. But this it was determined it should not continue to\r\nenjoy. At the commencement of the session of 1832-33, a grave and sober\r\ndoubt was expressed by the Secretary of the Treasury, in his official\r\ncommunication, whether the public moneys were safe in the custody of the\r\nbank! I confess, Gentlemen, when I look back to this suggestion, thus\r\nofficially made, so serious in its import, so unjust, if not well\r\nfounded, and so greatly injurious to the credit of the bank, and\r\ninjurious, indeed, to the credit of the whole country, I cannot but\r\nwonder that any man of intelligence and character should have been\r\nwilling to make it. I read in it, however, the first lines of another\r\nchapter. I saw an attempt was now to be made to remove the deposits of\r\nthe public money from the bank, and such an attempt was made that very\r\nsession. But Congress was not to be prevailed upon to accomplish the end\r\nby its own authority. It was well ascertained that neither house would\r\nconsent to it. The House of Representatives, indeed, at the heel of the\r\nsession, decided against the proposition by a very large majority.\r\n\r\nThe legislative authority having been thus invoked, and invoked in vain,\r\nit was resolved to stretch farther the long arm of executive power, and\r\nby that arm to reach and strike the victim. It so happened that I was in\r\nthis city in May, 1833, and here learned, from a very authentic source,\r\nthat the deposits would be removed by the President's order; and in\r\nJune, as afterwards appeared, that order was given.\r\n\r\nNow it is obvious, Gentlemen, that thus far the changes in our financial\r\nand fiscal system were effected, not by Congress, but by the executive;\r\nnot by law, but by the will and the power of the President. Congress\r\nwould have continued the charter of the bank; but the President\r\nnegatived the bill. Congress was of opinion that the deposits ought not\r\nto be removed; but the President removed them. Nor was this all. The\r\npublic moneys being withdrawn from the custody which the law had\r\nprovided, by executive power alone, that same power selected the places\r\nfor their future keeping. Particular banks, existing under State\r\ncharters, were chosen. With these especial and particular arrangements\r\nwere made, and the public moneys were deposited in their vaults.\r\nHenceforward these selected banks were to operate on the revenue and\r\ncredit of the government; and thus the original scheme, promulgated in\r\nthe annual message of December, 1829, was substantially carried into\r\neffect. Here were banks chosen by the treasury; all the arrangements\r\nwith them made by the treasury; a set of duties to be performed by them\r\nto the treasury prescribed; and these banks were to hold the whole\r\nproceeds of the public revenue. In all this, Congress had neither part\r\nnor lot. No law had caused the removal of the deposits; no law had\r\nauthorized the selection of deposit State banks; no law had prescribed\r\nthe terms on which the revenues should be placed in such banks. From the\r\nbeginning of the chapter to the end, it was all executive edict. And\r\nnow, Gentlemen, I ask if it be not most remarkable, that, in a country\r\nprofessing to be under a government of laws, such great and important\r\nchanges in one of its most essential and vital interests should be\r\nbrought about without any change of law, without any enactment of the\r\nlegislature whatever? Is such a power trusted to the executive of any\r\ngovernment in which the executive is separated, by clear and\r\nwell-defined lines, from the legislative department? The currency of the\r\ncountry stands on the same general ground as the commerce of the\r\ncountry. Both are intimately connected, and both are subjects of legal,\r\nnot of executive, regulation.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice, that the writers of the Federalist, in\r\ndiscussing the powers which the Constitution conferred on the President,\r\nmade it matter of commendation, that it withdraws this subject\r\naltogether from his grasp. \"He can prescribe no rules,\" say they,\r\n\"concerning the commerce or _currency_ of the country.\" And so we have\r\nbeen all taught to think, under all former administrations. But we have\r\nnow seen that the President, and the President alone, does prescribe the\r\nrule concerning the currency. He makes it, and he alters it. He makes\r\none rule for one branch of the revenue, and another rule for another. He\r\nmakes one rule for the citizen of one State, and another for the citizen\r\nof another State. This, it is certain, is one part of the treasury order\r\nof July last.\r\n\r\nBut at last Congress interfered, and undertook to regulate the deposits\r\nof the public moneys. It passed the law of July, 1836, placing the\r\nsubject under legal control, restraining the power of the executive,\r\nsubjecting the banks to liabilities and duties, on the one hand, and\r\nsecuring them against executive favoritism, on the other. But this law\r\ncontained another important provision; which was, that all the money in\r\nthe treasury, beyond what was necessary for the current expenditures of\r\nthe government, should be deposited with the States. This measure passed\r\nboth houses by very unusual majorities, yet it hardly escaped a veto. It\r\nobtained only a cold assent, a slow, reluctant, and hesitating approval;\r\nand an early moment was seized to array against it a long list of\r\nobjections. But the law passed. The money in the treasury beyond the sum\r\nof five millions was to go to the States. It has so gone, and the\r\ntreasury for the present is relieved from the burden of a surplus. But\r\nnow observe other coincidences. In the annual message of December, 1835,\r\nthe President quoted the fact of the rapidly increasing sale of the\r\npublic lands as proof of high national prosperity. He alluded to that\r\nsubject, certainly with much satisfaction, and apparently in something\r\nof the tone of exultation. There was nothing said about monopoly, not a\r\nword about speculation, not a word about over-issues of paper, to pay\r\nfor the lands. All was prosperous, all was full of evidence of a wise\r\nadministration of government, all was joy and triumph.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of a deposit or distribution of the surplus money with the\r\npeople suddenly damped this effervescing happiness. The color of the\r\nrose was gone, and every thing now looked gloomy and black. Now no more\r\nfelicitation or congratulation, on account of the rapid sales of the\r\npublic lands; no more of this most decisive proof of national prosperity\r\nand happiness. The executive Muse takes up a melancholy strain. She\r\nsings of monopolies, of speculation, of worthless paper, of loss both of\r\nland and money, of the multiplication of banks, and the danger of paper\r\nissues; and the end of the canto, the catastrophe, is, that lands shall\r\nno longer be sold but for gold and silver alone. The object of all this\r\nis clear enough. It was to diminish the income from the public lands. No\r\ndesire for such a diminution had been manifested, so long as the money\r\nwas supposed to be likely to remain in the treasury. But a growing\r\nconviction that some other disposition must be made of the surplus,\r\nawakened attention to the means of preventing that surplus.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the last session, Gentlemen, a proposition was\r\nbrought forward in Congress for such an alteration of the law as should\r\nadmit payment for public lands to be made in nothing but gold and\r\nsilver. The mover voted for his own proposition; but I do not recollect\r\nthat any other member concurred in the vote. The proposition was\r\nrejected at once; but, as in other cases, that which Congress refused to\r\ndo, the executive power did. Ten days after Congress adjourned, having\r\nhad this matter before it, and having refused to act upon it by making\r\nany alteration in the existing laws, a treasury order was issued,\r\ncommanding that very thing to be done which Congress had been requested\r\nand had refused to do. Just as in the case of the removal of the\r\ndeposits, the executive power acted in this case also against the known,\r\nwell understood, and recently expressed will of the representatives of\r\nthe people. There never has been a moment when the legislative will\r\nwould have sanctioned the object of that order; probably never a moment\r\nin which any twenty individual members of Congress would have concurred\r\nin it. The act was done without the assent of Congress, and against the\r\nwell-known opinion of Congress. That act altered the law of the land, or\r\npurported to alter it, against the well-known will of the law-making\r\npower.\r\n\r\nFor one, I confess I see no authority whatever in the Constitution, or\r\nin any law, for this treasury order. Those who have undertaken to\r\nmaintain it have placed it on grounds, not only different, but\r\ninconsistent and contradictory. The reason which one gives, another\r\nrejects; one confutes what another argues. With one it is the joint\r\nresolution of 1816 which gave the authority; with another, it is the law\r\nof 1820; with a third, it is the general superintending power of the\r\nPresident; and this last argument, since it resolves itself into mere\r\npower, without stopping to point out the sources of that power, is not\r\nonly the shortest, but in truth the most just. He is the most sensible,\r\nas well as the most candid reasoner, in my opinion, who places this\r\ntreasury order on the ground of the pleasure of the executive, and stops\r\nthere. I regard the joint resolution of 1816 as mandatory; as\r\nprescribing a legal rule; as putting this subject, in which all have so\r\ndeep an interest, beyond the caprice, or the arbitrary pleasure, or the\r\ndiscretion, of the Secretary of the Treasury. I believe there is not the\r\nslightest legal authority, either in that officer or in the President,\r\nto make a distinction, and to say that paper may be received for debts\r\nat the custom-house, but that gold and silver only shall be received at\r\nthe land offices. And now for the sequel.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the last session, as you know, Gentlemen, a\r\nresolution was brought forward in the Senate for annulling and\r\nabrogating this order, by Mr. Ewing, of Ohio, a gentleman of much\r\nintelligence, of sound principles, of vigorous and energetic character,\r\nwhose loss from the service of the country I regard as a public\r\nmisfortune. The Whig members all supported this resolution, and all the\r\nmembers, I believe, with the exception of some five or six, were very\r\nanxious in some way to get rid of the treasury order. But Mr. Ewing's\r\nresolution was too direct. It was deemed a pointed and ungracious\r\nattack on executive policy. It must therefore be softened, modified,\r\nqualified, made to sound less harsh to the ears of men in power, and to\r\nassume a plausible, polished, inoffensive character. It was accordingly\r\nput into the plastic hands of friends of the executive to be moulded and\r\nfashioned, so that it might have the effect of ridding the country of\r\nthe obnoxious order, and yet not appear to question executive\r\ninfallibility. All this did not answer. The late President is not a man\r\nto be satisfied with soft words; and he saw in the measure, even as it\r\npassed the two houses, a substantial repeal of the order. He is a man of\r\nboldness and decision; and he respects boldness and decision in others.\r\nIf you are his friend, he expects no flinching; and if you are his\r\nadversary, he respects you none the less for carrying your opposition to\r\nthe full limits of honorable warfare. Gentlemen, I most sincerely regret\r\nthe course of the President in regard to this bill, and certainly most\r\nhighly disapprove it. But I do not suffer the mortification of having\r\nattempted to disguise and garnish it, in order to make it acceptable,\r\nand of still finding it thrown back in my face. All that was obtained by\r\nthis ingenious, diplomatic, and over-courteous mode of enacting a law,\r\nwas a response from the President and the Attorney-General, that the\r\nbill in question was obscure, ill penned, and not easy to be understood.\r\nThe bill, therefore, was neither approved nor negatived. If it had been\r\napproved, the treasury order would have been annulled, though in a\r\nclumsy and objectionable manner. If it had been negatived, and returned\r\nto Congress, no doubt it would have been passed by two thirds of both\r\nhouses, and in that way have become a law, and abrogated the order. But\r\nit was not approved, it was not returned; it was retained. It had passed\r\nthe Senate in season; it had been sent to the House in season; but there\r\nit was suffered to lie so long without being called up, that it was\r\ncompletely in the power of the President when it finally passed that\r\nbody; since he is not obliged to return bills which he does not approve,\r\nif not presented to him ten days before the end of the session. The bill\r\nwas lost, therefore, and the treasury order remains in force. Here again\r\nthe representatives of the people, in both houses of Congress, by\r\nmajorities almost unprecedented, endeavored to abolish this obnoxious\r\norder. On hardly any subject, indeed, has opinion been so unanimous,\r\neither in or out of Congress. Yet the order remains.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Gentlemen, I ask you, and I ask all men who have not\r\nvoluntarily surrendered all power and all right of thinking for\r\nthemselves, whether, from 1832 to the present moment, the executive\r\nauthority has not effectually superseded the power of Congress, thwarted\r\nthe will of the representatives of the people, and even of the people\r\nthemselves, and taken the whole subject of the currency into its own\r\ngrasp? In 1832, Congress desired to continue the bank of the United\r\nStates, and a majority of the people desired it also; but the President\r\nopposed it, and his will prevailed. In 1833, Congress refused to remove\r\nthe deposits; the President resolved upon it, however, and his will\r\nprevailed. Congress has never been willing to make a bank founded on the\r\nmoney and credit of the government, and administered, of course, by\r\nexecutive hands; but this was the President's object, and he attained\r\nit, in a great measure, by the treasury selection of deposit banks. In\r\nthis particular, therefore, to a great extent, his will prevailed. In\r\n1836, Congress refused to confine the receipts for public lands to gold\r\nand silver; but the President willed it, and his will prevailed. In\r\n1837, both houses of Congress, by more than two thirds, passed a bill\r\nfor restoring the former state of things by annulling the treasury\r\norder; but the President willed, notwithstanding, that the order should\r\nremain in force, and his will again prevailed. I repeat the question,\r\ntherefore, and I would put it earnestly to every intelligent man, to\r\nevery lover of our constitutional liberty, are we under the dominion of\r\nthe law? or has the effectual government of the country, at least in\r\nall that regards the great interest of the currency, been in a single\r\nhand?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have done with the narrative of events and measures. I have\r\ndone with the history of these successive steps, in the progress of\r\nexecutive power, towards a complete control over the revenue and the\r\ncurrency. The result is now all before us. These pretended reforms,\r\nthese extraordinary exercises of power from an extraordinary zeal for\r\nthe good of the people, what have they brought us to?\r\n\r\nIn 1829, the currency was declared to be _neither sound nor uniform_; a\r\nproposition, in my judgment, altogether at variance with the fact,\r\nbecause I do not believe there ever was a country of equal extent, in\r\nwhich paper formed any part of the circulation, that possessed a\r\ncurrency so sound, so uniform, so convenient, and so perfect in all\r\nrespects, as the currency of this country, at the moment of the delivery\r\nof that message, in 1829.\r\n\r\nBut how is it now? Where has the improvement brought it? What has reform\r\ndone? What has the great cry for hard money accomplished? Is the\r\ncurrency _uniform_ now? Is money in New Orleans now as good, or nearly\r\nso, as money in New York? Are exchanges at par, or only at the same low\r\nrates as in 1829 and other years? Every one here knows that all the\r\nbenefits of this experiment are but injury and oppression; all this\r\nreform, but aggravated distress.\r\n\r\nAnd as to the _soundness_ of the currency, how does that stand? Are the\r\ncauses of alarm less now than in 1829? Is there less bank paper in\r\ncirculation? Is there less fear of a general catastrophe? Is property\r\nmore secure, or industry more certain of its reward? We all know,\r\nGentlemen, that, during all this pretended warfare against all banks,\r\nbanks have vastly increased. Millions upon millions of bank paper have\r\nbeen added to the circulation. Everywhere, and nowhere so much as where\r\nthe present administration and its measures have been most zealously\r\nsupported, banks have multiplied under State authority, since the decree\r\nwas made that the Bank of the United States should be suffered to\r\nexpire. Look at Mississippi, Missouri, Louisiana, Virginia, and other\r\nStates. Do we not see that banking capital and bank paper are enormously\r\nincreasing? The opposition to banks, therefore, so much professed,\r\nwhether it be real or whether it be but pretended, has not restrained\r\neither their number or their issues of paper. Both have vastly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nAnd now a word or two, Gentlemen, upon this hard-money scheme, and the\r\nfancies and the delusions to which it has given birth. Gentlemen, this\r\nis a subject of delicacy, and one which it is difficult to treat with\r\nsufficient caution, in a popular and occasional address like this. I\r\nprofess to be a _bullionist_, in the usual and accepted sense of that\r\nword. I am for a solid specie basis for our circulation, and for specie\r\nas a part of the circulation, so far as it may be practicable and\r\nconvenient. I am for giving no value to paper, merely as paper. I abhor\r\npaper; that is to say, irredeemable paper, paper that may not be\r\nconverted into gold or silver at the will of the holder. But while I\r\nhold to all this, I believe, also, that an exclusive gold and silver\r\ncirculation is an utter impossibility in the present state of this\r\ncountry and of the world. We shall none of us ever see it; and it is\r\ncredulity and folly, in my opinion, to act under any such hope or\r\nexpectation. The States will make banks, and these will issue paper; and\r\nthe longer the government of the United States neglects its duty in\r\nregard to measures for regulating the currency, the greater will be the\r\namount of bank paper overspreading the country. Of this I entertain not\r\na particle of doubt.\r\n\r\nWhile I thus hold to the absolute and indispensable necessity of gold\r\nand silver, as the foundation of our circulation, I yet think nothing\r\nmore absurd and preposterous, than unnatural and strained efforts to\r\nimport specie. There is but so much specie in the world, and its amount\r\ncannot be greatly or suddenly increased. Indeed, there are reasons for\r\nsupposing that its amount has recently diminished, by the quantity used\r\nin manufactures, and by the diminished products of the mines. The\r\nexisting amount of specie, however, must support the paper circulations,\r\nand the systems of currency, not of the United States only, but of other\r\nnations also. One of its great uses is to pass from country to country,\r\nfor the purpose of settling occasional balances in commercial\r\ntransactions. It always finds its way, naturally and easily, to places\r\nwhere it is needed for these uses. But to take extraordinary pains to\r\nbring it where the course of trade does not bring it, where the state of\r\ndebt and credit does not require it to be, and then to endeavor, by\r\nunnecessary and injurious regulations, treasury orders, accumulations at\r\nthe mint, and other contrivances, there to retain it, is a course of\r\npolicy bordering, as it appears to me, on political insanity. It is\r\nboasted that we have seventy-five or eighty millions of specie now in\r\nthe country. But what more senseless, what more absurd, than this boast,\r\nif there is a balance against us abroad, of which payment is desired\r\nsooner than remittances of our own products are likely to make that\r\npayment? What more miserable than to boast of having that which is not\r\nours, which belongs to others, and which the convenience of others, and\r\nour own convenience also, require that they should possess? If Boston\r\nwere in debt to New York, would it be wise in Boston, instead of paying\r\nits debt, to contrive all possible means of obtaining specie from the\r\nNew York banks, and hoarding it at home? And yet this, as I think, would\r\nbe precisely as sensible as the course which the government of the\r\nUnited States at present pursues. We have, beyond all doubt, a great\r\namount of specie in the country, but it does not answer its accustomed\r\nend, it does not perform its proper duty. It neither goes abroad to\r\nsettle balances against us, and thereby quiet those who have demands\r\nupon us; nor is it so disposed of at home us to sustain the circulation\r\nto the extent which the circumstances of the times require. A great part\r\nof it is in the Western banks, in the land offices, on the roads through\r\nthe wilderness, on the passages over the Lakes, from the land offices to\r\nthe deposit banks, and from the deposit banks back to the land offices.\r\nAnother portion is in the hands of buyers and sellers of specie; of men\r\nin the West, who sell land-office money to the new settlers for a high\r\npremium Another portion, again, is kept in private hands, to be used\r\nwhen circumstances shall tempt to the purchase of lands. And, Gentlemen,\r\nI am inclined to think, so loud has been the cry about hard money, and\r\nso sweeping the denunciation of all paper, that private holding, or\r\nhoarding, prevails to some extent in different parts of the country.\r\nThese eighty millions of specie, therefore, really do us little good. We\r\nare weaker in our circulation, I have no doubt, our credit is feebler,\r\nmoney is scarcer with us, at this moment, than if twenty millions of\r\nthis specie were shipped to Europe, and general confidence thereby\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I will not say that some degree of pressure might not have\r\ncome upon us, if the treasury order had not issued. I will not say that\r\nthere has not been over-trading, and over-production, and a too great\r\nexpansion of bank circulation. This may all be so, and the\r\nlast-mentioned evil, it was easy to foresee, was likely to happen when\r\nthe United States discontinued their own bank. But what I do say is,\r\nthat, acting upon the state of things as it actually existed, and is now\r\nactually existing the treasury order has been, and now is productive of\r\ngreat distress. It acts upon a state of things which gives extraordinary\r\nforce to its stroke, and extraordinary point to its sting. It arrests\r\nspecie, when the free use and circulation of specie are most important;\r\nit cripples the banks, at a moment when the banks more than ever need\r\nall their means. It makes the merchant unable to remit, when remittance\r\nis necessary for his own credit, and for the general adjustment of\r\ncommercial balances. I am not now discussing the general question,\r\nwhether prices must not come down, and adjust themselves anew to the\r\namount of bullion existing in Europe and America. I am dealing only with\r\nthe measures of our own government on the subject of the currency, and I\r\ninsist that these measures have been most unfortunate, and most ruinous\r\nin their effects on the ordinary means of our circulation at home, and\r\non our ability of remittance abroad.\r\n\r\nTheir effects, too, on domestic exchanges, by deranging and misplacing\r\nthe specie which is in the country, are most disastrous. Let him who has\r\nlent an ear to all these promises of a more uniform currency see how he\r\ncan now sell his draft on New Orleans or Mobile. Let the Northern\r\nmanufacturers and mechanics, those who have sold the products of their\r\nlabor to the South, and heretofore realized the prices with little loss\r\nof exchange,--let them try present facilities. Let them see what reform\r\nof the currency has done for them. Let them inquire whether, in this\r\nrespect, their condition is better or worse than it was five or six\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I hold this disturbance of the measure of value, and the\r\nmeans of payment and exchange, this derangement, and, if I may so say,\r\nthis violation of the currency, to be one of the most unpardonable of\r\npolitical faults. He who tampers with the currency robs labor of its\r\nbread. He panders, indeed, to greedy capital, which is keen-sighted, and\r\nmay shift for itself; but he beggars labor, which is honest,\r\nunsuspecting, and too busy with the present to calculate for the future.\r\nThe prosperity of the working classes lives, moves, and has its being in\r\nestablished credit, and a steady medium of payment. All sudden changes\r\ndestroy it. Honest industry never comes in for any part of the spoils in\r\nthat scramble which takes place when the currency of a country is\r\ndisordered. Did wild schemes and projects ever benefit the industrious?\r\nDid irredeemable bank paper ever enrich the laborious? Did violent\r\nfluctuations ever do good to him who depends on his daily labor for his\r\ndaily bread? Certainly never. All these things may gratify greediness\r\nfor sudden gain, or the rashness of daring speculation; but they can\r\nbring nothing but injury and distress to the homes of patient industry\r\nand honest labor. Who are they that profit by the present state of\r\nthings? They are not the many, but the few. They are speculators,\r\nbrokers, dealers in money, and lenders of money at exorbitant interest.\r\nSmall capitalists are crushed, and, their means being dispersed, as\r\nusual, in various parts of the country, and this miserable policy having\r\ndestroyed exchanges, they have no longer either money or credit. And all\r\nclasses of labor partake, and must partake, in the same calamity. And\r\nwhat consolation for all this is it, that the public lands are paid for\r\nin specie? that, whatever embarrassment and distress pervade the\r\ncountry, the Western wilderness is thickly sprinkled over with eagles\r\nand dollars? that gold goes weekly from Milwaukie and Chicago to\r\nDetroit, and back again from Detroit to Milwaukie and Chicago, and\r\nperforms similar feats of egress and regress, in many other instances,\r\nin the Western States? It is remarkable enough, that, with all this\r\nsacrifice of general convenience, with all this sky-rending clamor for\r\ngovernment payments in specie, government, after all, never gets a\r\ndollar. So far as I know, the United States have not now a single specie\r\ndollar in the world. If they have, where is it? The gold and silver\r\ncollected at the land offices is sent to the deposit banks; it is there\r\nplaced to the credit of the government, and thereby becomes the property\r\nof the bank. The whole revenue of the government, therefore, after all,\r\nconsists in mere bank credits; that very sort of security which the\r\nfriends of the administration have so much denounced.\r\n\r\nRemember, Gentlemen, in the midst of this deafening din against all\r\nbanks, that, if it shall create such a panic as shall shut up the banks,\r\nit will shut up the treasury of the United States also.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I would not willingly be a prophet of ill. I most devoutly\r\nwish to see a better state of things; and I believe the repeal of the\r\ntreasury order would tend very much to bring about that better state of\r\nthings. And I am of opinion, that, sooner or later, the order will be\r\nrepealed. I think it must be repealed. I think the East, West, North,\r\nand South will demand its repeal. But, Gentlemen, I feel it my duty to\r\nsay, that, if I should be disappointed in this expectation, I see no\r\nimmediate relief to the distresses of the community. I greatly fear,\r\neven, that the worst is not yet.[2] I look for severer distresses; for\r\nextreme difficulties in exchange, for far greater inconveniences in\r\nremittance, and for a sudden fall in prices. Our condition is one which\r\nis not to be tampered with, and the repeal of the treasury order, being\r\nsomething which government can do, and which will do good, the public\r\nvoice is right in demanding that repeal. It is true, if repealed now,\r\nthe relief will come late. Nevertheless its repeal or abrogation is a\r\nthing to be insisted on, and pursued, till it shall be accomplished.\r\nThis executive control over the currency, this power of discriminating,\r\nby treasury order, between one man's debt and another man's debt, is a\r\nthing not to be endured in a free country; and it should be the\r\nconstant, persisting demand of all true Whigs, \"Rescind the illegal\r\ntreasury order, restore the rule of the law, place all branches of the\r\nrevenue on the same grounds, make men's rights equal, and leave the\r\ngovernment of the country where the Constitution leaves it, in the hands\r\nof the representatives of the people in Congress.\" This point should\r\nnever be surrendered or compromised. Whatever is established, let it be\r\nequal, and let it be legal. Let men know, to-day, what money may be\r\nrequired of them to-morrow. Let the rule be open and public, on the\r\npages of the statute-book, not a secret, in the executive breast.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, in the session which has now just closed, I have done my\r\nutmost to effect a direct and immediate repeal of the treasury order.\r\n\r\nI have voted for a bill anticipating the payment of the French and\r\nNeapolitan indemnities by an advance from the treasury.\r\n\r\nI have voted with great satisfaction for the restoration of duties on\r\ngoods destroyed in the great conflagration in this city.\r\n\r\nI have voted for a deposit with the States of the surplus which may be\r\nin the treasury at the end of the year. All these measures have failed;\r\nand it is for you, and for our fellow-citizens throughout the country,\r\nto decide whether the public interest would, or would not, have been\r\npromoted by their success.\r\n\r\nBut I find, Gentlemen, that I am committing an unpardonable trespass on\r\nyour indulgent patience. I will pursue these remarks no further. And yet\r\nI cannot persuade myself to take leave of you without reminding you,\r\nwith the utmost deference and respect, of the important part assigned to\r\nyou in the political concerns of your country, and of the great\r\ninfluence of your opinions, your example, and your efforts upon the\r\ngeneral prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nWhigs of New York! Patriotic citizens of this great metropolis! Lovers\r\nof constitutional liberty, bound by interest and by affection to the\r\ninstitutions of your country, Americans in heart and in principle!--you\r\nare ready, I am sure, to fulfil all the duties imposed upon you by your\r\nsituation, and demanded of you by your country. You have a central\r\nposition; your city is the point from which intelligence emanates, and\r\nspreads in all directions over the whole land. Every hour carries\r\nreports of your sentiments and opinions to the verge of the Union. You\r\ncannot escape the responsibility which circumstances have thrown upon\r\nyou. You must live and act, on a broad and conspicuous theatre, either\r\nfor good or for evil to your country. You cannot shrink from your public\r\nduties; you cannot obscure yourselves, nor bury your talent. In the\r\ncommon welfare, in the common prosperity, in the common glory of\r\nAmericans, you have a stake of value not to be calculated. You have an\r\ninterest in the preservation of the Union, of the Constitution, and of\r\nthe true principles of the government, which no man can estimate. You\r\nact for yourselves, and for the generations that are to come after you;\r\nand those who ages hence shall bear your names, and partake your blood,\r\nwill feel, in their political and social condition, the consequences of\r\nthe manner in which you discharge your political duties.\r\n\r\nHaving fulfilled, then, on your part and on mine, though feebly and\r\nimperfectly on mine, the offices of kindness and mutual regard required\r\nby this occasion, shall we not use it to a higher and nobler purpose?\r\nShall we not, by this friendly meeting, refresh our patriotism, rekindle\r\nour love of constitutional liberty, and strengthen our resolutions of\r\npublic duty? Shall we not, in all honesty and sincerity, with pure and\r\ndisinterested love of country, as Americans, looking back to the renown\r\nof our ancestors, and looking forward to the interests of our posterity,\r\nhere, to-night, pledge our mutual faith to hold on to the last to our\r\nprofessed principles, to the doctrines of true liberty, and to the\r\nConstitution of the country, let who will prove true, or who will prove\r\nrecreant? Whigs of New York! I meet you in advance, and give you my\r\npledge for my own performance of these duties, without qualification and\r\nwithout reserve. Whether in public life or in private life, in the\r\nCapitol or at home, I mean never to desert them. I mean never to forget\r\nthat I have a country, to which I am bound by a thousand ties; and the\r\nstone which is to lie on the ground that shall cover me, shall not bear\r\nthe name of a son ungrateful to his native land.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: President Jackson.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: On the 10th of June following the delivery of this speech,\r\nall the banks in the city of New York, by common consent, suspended the\r\npayment of their notes in specie.

CLAY AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE\r\nRESOLUTION OFFERED BY MR. CALHOUN ON THE SUBJECT OF SLAVERY IN THE\r\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[On the 27th of December, 1837, a series of resolutions was moved in the\r\nSenate by Mr. Calhoun, on the subject of slavery. The fifth of the\r\nseries was expressed in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the intermeddling of any State, or States, or their\r\ncitizens, to abolish slavery in this District, or any of the\r\nTerritories, on the ground, or under the pretext, that it is immoral or\r\nsinful, or the passage of any act or measure of Congress with that view,\r\nwould be a direct and dangerous attack on the institutions of all the\r\nslave-holding States.\"\r\n\r\nThese resolutions were taken up for discussion on several successive\r\ndays. On the 10th of January, 1838, Mr. Clay moved the following\r\nresolution, as a substitute for the fifth of Mr. Calhoun's series:--\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the interference, by the citizens of any of the\r\nStates, with the view to the abolition of slavery in this District, is\r\nendangering the rights and security of the people of the District; and\r\nthat any act or measure of Congress, designed to abolish slavery in this\r\nDistrict, would be a violation of the faith implied in the cessions by\r\nthe States of Virginia and Maryland, a just cause of alarm to the people\r\nof the slave-holding States, and have a direct and inevitable tendency\r\nto disturb and endanger the Union.\"\r\n\r\nOn the subject of this amendment, Mr. Webster addressed the Senate as\r\nfollows.]\r\n\r\nMr. President,--I cannot concur in this resolution. I do not know any\r\nmatter of fact, or any ground of argument, on which this affirmation of\r\nplighted faith can be sustained. I see nothing by which Congress has\r\ntied up its hands, either directly or indirectly, so as to put its clear\r\nconstitutional power beyond the exercise of its own discretion. I have\r\ncarefully examined the acts of cession by the States, the act of\r\nCongress, the proceedings and history of the times, and I find nothing\r\nto lead me to doubt that it was the intention of all parties to leave\r\nthis, like other subjects belonging to legislation for the ceded\r\nterritory, entirely to the discretion and wisdom of Congress. The words\r\nof the Constitution are clear and plain. None could be clearer or\r\nplainer. Congress, by that instrument, has power to exercise exclusive\r\njurisdiction over the ceded territory, in all cases whatsoever. The acts\r\nof cession contain no limitation, condition, or qualification whatever,\r\nexcept that, out of abundant caution, there is inserted a _proviso_ that\r\nnothing in the acts contained shall be construed to vest in the United\r\nStates any right of property in the soil, so as to affect the rights of\r\nindividuals therein, otherwise than as such individuals might themselves\r\ntransfer their right of soil to the United States. The acts of cession\r\ndeclare, that the tract of country \"is for ever ceded and relinquished\r\nto Congress and to the government of the United States, in full and\r\nabsolute right and exclusive jurisdiction, as well of soil as of persons\r\nresiding or to reside therein, pursuant to the tenor and effect of the\r\neighth section of the first article of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nNow, that section, to which reference is thus expressly made in these\r\ndeeds of cession, declares, that Congress shall have power \"to exercise\r\nexclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over such district, not\r\nexceeding ten miles square, as may, by cession of particular States and\r\nthe acceptance of Congress, become the seat of government of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nNothing, therefore, as it seems to me, can be clearer, than that the\r\nStates making the cession expected Congress to exercise over the\r\nDistrict precisely that power, and neither more nor less, which the\r\nConstitution had conferred upon it. I do not know how the provision, or\r\nthe intention, either of the Constitution in granting the power, or of\r\nthe States in making the cession, could be expressed in a manner more\r\nabsolutely free from all doubt or ambiguity.\r\n\r\nI see, therefore, nothing in the act of cession, and nothing in the\r\nConstitution, and nothing in the history of this transaction, and\r\nnothing in any other transaction, implying any limitation upon the\r\nauthority of Congress.\r\n\r\nIf the assertion contained in this resolution be true, a very strange\r\nresult, as it seems to me, must follow. The resolution affirms that the\r\nfaith of Congress is pledged, indefinitely. It makes no limitation of\r\ntime or circumstance. If this be so, then it is an obligation that binds\r\nus for ever, as much as if it were one of the prohibitions of the\r\nConstitution itself. And at all times hereafter, even if, in the course\r\nof their history, availing themselves of events, or changing their views\r\nof policy, the States themselves should make provision for the\r\nemancipation of their slaves, the existing state of things could not be\r\nchanged, nevertheless, in this District. It does really seem to me,\r\nthat, if this resolution, in its terms, be true, though slavery in every\r\nother part of the world may be abolished, yet in the metropolis of this\r\ngreat republic it is established in perpetuity. This appears to me to be\r\nthe result of the doctrine of plighted faith, as stated in the\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\n     In reply to Mr. Buchanan, Mr. Webster\r\nsaid:--#/\r\n\r\nThe words of the resolution speak for themselves. They require no\r\ncomment. They express an unlimited plighted faith. The honorable member\r\nwill so see if he will look at those words. The gentleman asks whether\r\nthose who made the cession could have expected that Congress would ever\r\nexercise such a power. To this I answer, that I see no reason to doubt\r\nthat the parties to the cession were as willing to leave this as to\r\nleave other powers to the discretion of Congress. I see not the\r\nslightest evidence of any especial fear, or any especial care or\r\nconcern, on the part of the ceding States, in regard to this particular\r\npart of the jurisdiction ceded to Congress. And I think I can ask, on\r\nthe other side, a very important question for the consideration of the\r\ngentleman himself, and for that of the Senate and the country; and that\r\nis, Would Congress have accepted the cession with any such restraint\r\nupon its constitutional power, either express or understood to be\r\nimplied? I think not. Looking back to the state of things then existing,\r\nand especially to what Congress had so recently done, when it accepted\r\nthe cession of the Northwestern Territory, I entertain no doubt whatever\r\nthat Congress would have refused the cession altogether, if offered with\r\nany condition or understanding that its constitutional authority to\r\nexercise exclusive legislation over the District in all cases whatsoever\r\nshould be abridged.\r\n\r\nThe Senate will observe that I am speaking solely to the point of\r\nplighted faith. Upon other parts of the resolution, and upon many other\r\nthings connected with it, I have said nothing. I only resist the\r\nimposition of new obligations, or a new prohibition, not to be found, as\r\nI think, either in the Constitution or any act of Congress. I have said\r\nnothing on the expediency of abolition, immediate or gradual, or the\r\nreasons which ought to weigh with Congress should that question be\r\nproposed. I can, however, well conceive what would, as I think, be a\r\nnatural and fair mode of reasoning on such an occasion.\r\n\r\nWhen it is said, for instance, by way of argument, that Congress,\r\nalthough it have the power, ought not to take a lead in the business of\r\nabolition, considering that the interest which the United States have in\r\nthe whole subject is vastly less than that which States have in it, I\r\ncan understand the propriety and pertinency of the observation. It is,\r\nas far as it goes, a pertinent and appropriate argument, and I shall\r\nalways be ready to give it the full weight belonging to it. When it is\r\nargued that, in a case so vital to the States, the States themselves\r\nshould be allowed to maintain their own policy, and that the government\r\nof the United States ought not to do any thing which shall, directly or\r\nindirectly, shake or disturb that policy, this is a line of argument\r\nwhich I can understand, whatever weight I may be disposed to give to it;\r\nfor I have always not only admitted, but insisted, that slavery within\r\nthe States is a subject belonging absolutely and exclusively to the\r\nStates themselves.\r\n\r\nBut the present is not an attempt to establish any such course of\r\nreasoning as this. The attempt is to set up a pledge of the public\r\nfaith, to do the same office that a constitutional prohibition in terms\r\nwould do; that is, to set up a direct bar, precluding all exercise of\r\nthe discretion of Congress over the subject. It has been often said, in\r\nthis debate, and I believe it is true, that a decided majority of the\r\nSenate do believe that Congress has a clear constitutional power over\r\nslavery in this District. But while this constitutional right is\r\nadmitted, it is at the same moment attempted effectually to counteract,\r\noverthrow, and do away with it, by the affirmation of plighted faith, as\r\nasserted in the resolution before us.\r\n\r\nNow, I have already said I know of nothing to support this affirmation.\r\nNeither in the acts of cession, nor in the act of Congress accepting it,\r\nnor in any other document, history, publication, or transaction, do I\r\nknow of a single fact or suggestion supporting this proposition, or\r\ntending to support it. Nor has any gentleman, so far as I know, pointed\r\nout, or attempted to point out, any such fact, document, transaction, or\r\nother evidence. All is left to the general and repeated statement, that\r\nsuch a condition must have been intended by the States. Of all this I\r\nsee no proof whatever. I see no evidence of any desire on the part of\r\nthe States thus to limit the power of Congress, or thus to require a\r\npledge against its exercise. And, indeed, if this were made out, the\r\nintention of Congress, as well as that of the States, must be inquired\r\ninto. Nothing short of a clear and manifest intention of both parties,\r\nproved by proper evidence, can amount to plighted faith. The expectation\r\nor intent of one party, founded on something not provided for nor hinted\r\nat in the transaction itself, cannot plight the faith of the other\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nIn short, I am altogether unable to see any ground for supposing that\r\neither party to the cession had any mental reservation, any unexpressed\r\nexpectation, or relied on any implied, but unmentioned and unsuggested\r\npledge, whatever. By the Constitution, if a district should be ceded to\r\nit for the seat of government, Congress was to have a right, in express\r\nterms, to exercise exclusive legislation, in all cases whatsoever. The\r\ncession was made and accepted in pursuance of this power. Both parties\r\nknew well what they were doing. Both parties knew that by the cession\r\nthe States surrendered all jurisdiction, and Congress acquired all\r\njurisdiction; and this is the whole transaction.\r\n\r\nAs to any provision in the acts of cession stipulating for the security\r\nof property, there is none, excepting only what I have already stated;\r\nthe condition, namely, that no right of individuals to the soil should\r\nbe construed to be transferred, but only the jurisdiction. But, no\r\ndoubt, all rights of property ought to be duly respected by Congress,\r\nand all other legislatures.\r\n\r\nAnd since the subject of compensation to the owners of emancipated\r\nslaves has been referred to, I take occasion to say, that if Congress\r\nshould think that a wise, just, and politic legislation for this\r\nDistrict required it to make compensation for slaves emancipated here,\r\nit has the same constitutional authority to make such compensation as to\r\nmake grants for roads and bridges, almshouses, penitentiaries, and other\r\nsimilar objects, in the District. A general and absolute power of\r\nlegislation carries with it all the necessary and just incidents\r\nbelonging to such legislation.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Clay having made some remarks in reply, Mr. Webster\r\nrejoined:--#/\r\n\r\nThe honorable member from Kentucky asks the Senate to suppose the\r\nopposite case; to suppose that the seat of government had been fixed in\r\na free State, Pennsylvania, for example; and that Congress had attempted\r\nto establish slavery in a district over which, as here, it had thus\r\nexclusive legislation. He asks whether, in that case, Congress could\r\nestablish slavery in such a place. This mode of changing the question\r\ndoes not, I think, vary the argument; and I answer, at once, that,\r\nhowever improbable or improper such an act might be, yet, if the power\r\nwere universal, absolute, and without restriction, it might\r\nunquestionably be so exercised. No limitation being expressed or\r\nintimated in the grant itself, or any other proceeding of the parties,\r\nnone could be implied.\r\n\r\nAnd in the other cases, of forts, arsenals, and dock-yards, if Congress\r\nhas exclusive and absolute legislative power, it must, of course, have\r\nthe power, if it could be supposed to be guilty of such folly, whether\r\nproposed to be exercised in a district within a free State, to establish\r\nslavery, or in a district in a slave State, to abolish or regulate it.\r\nIf it be a district over which Congress has, as it has in this District,\r\nunlimited power of legislation, it seems to me that whatever would stay\r\nthe exercise of this power, in either case, must be drawn from\r\ndiscretion, from reasons of justice and true policy, from those high\r\nconsiderations which ought to influence Congress in questions of such\r\nextreme delicacy and importance; and to all these considerations I am\r\nwilling, and always shall be willing, I trust, to give full weight. But\r\nI cannot, in conscience, say that the power so clearly conferred on\r\nCongress by the Constitution, as a power to be exercised, like others,\r\nat its own discretion, is immediately taken away again by an implied\r\nfaith that it shall not be exercised at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CREDIT SYSTEM AND THE LABOR OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nFROM THE SECOND SPEECH ON THE SUB-TREASURY, DELIVERED IN THE SENATE OF\r\nTHE UNITED STATES, ON THE 12th OF MARCH, 1838.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President, what I understand by the credit system is, that\r\nwhich thus connects labor and capital, by giving to labor the use of\r\ncapital. In other words, intelligence, good character, and good morals\r\nbestow on those who have not capital a power, a trust, a confidence,\r\nwhich enables them to obtain it, and to employ it usefully for\r\nthemselves and others. These active men of business build their hopes of\r\nsuccess on their attentiveness, their economy, and their integrity. A\r\nwider theatre for useful activity is under their feet, and around them,\r\nthan was ever open to the young and enterprising generations of men, on\r\nany other spot enlightened by the sun. Before them is the ocean. Every\r\nthing in that direction invites them to efforts of enterprise and\r\nindustry in the pursuits of commerce and the fisheries. Around them, on\r\nall hands, are thriving and prosperous manufactures, an improving\r\nagriculture, and the daily presentation of new objects of internal\r\nimprovement; while behind them is almost half a continent of the richest\r\nland, at the cheapest prices, under healthful climates, and washed by\r\nthe most magnificent rivers that on any part of the globe pay their\r\nhomage to the sea. In the midst of all these glowing and glorious\r\nprospects, they are neither restrained by ignorance, nor smitten down by\r\nthe penury of personal circumstances. They are not compelled to\r\ncontemplate, in hopelessness and despair, all the advantages thus\r\nbestowed on their condition by Providence. Capital they may have little\r\nor none, but CREDIT supplies its place; not as the refuge of the\r\nprodigal and the reckless; not as gratifying present wants with the\r\ncertainty of future absolute ruin; but as the genius of honorable trust\r\nand confidence; as the blessing voluntarily offered to good character\r\nand to good conduct as the beneficent agent, which assists honesty and\r\nenterprise in obtaining comfort and independence.\r\n\r\nMr. President, take away this credit, and what remains? I do not ask\r\nwhat remains to the few, but to the many? Take away this system of\r\ncredit, and then tell me what is left for labor and industry, but mere\r\nmanual toil and daily drudgery? If we adopt a system that withdraws\r\ncapital from active employment, do we not diminish the rate of wages? If\r\nwe curtail the general business of society, does not every laboring man\r\nfind his condition grow daily worse? In the politics of the day, Sir, we\r\nhear much said about divorcing the government from the banks; but when\r\nwe abolish credit, we shall divorce labor from capital; and depend upon\r\nit, Sir, when we divorce labor from capital, capital is hoarded, and\r\nlabor starves.\r\n\r\nThe declaration so often quoted, that \"all who trade on borrowed capital\r\nought to break,\" is the most aristocratic sentiment ever uttered in this\r\ncountry. It is a sentiment which, if carried out by political\r\narrangement, would condemn the great majority of mankind to the\r\nperpetual condition of mere day-laborers. It tends to take away from\r\nthem all that solace and hope which arise from possessing something\r\nwhich they can call their own. A man loves his own; it is fit and\r\nnatural that he should do so; and he will love his country and its\r\ninstitutions, if he have some stake in that country, although it be but\r\na very small part of the general mass of property. If it be but a\r\ncottage, an acre, a garden, its possession raises him, gives him\r\nself-respect, and strengthens his attachment to his native land. It is\r\nour happy condition, by the blessing of Providence, that almost every\r\nman of sound health, industrious habits, and good morals, can ordinarily\r\nattain, at least, to this degree of comfort and respectability; and it\r\nis a result devoutly to be wished, both for its individual and its\r\ngeneral consequences.\r\n\r\nBut even to this degree of acquisition that credit of which I have\r\nalready said so much is highly important, since its general effect is to\r\nraise the price of wages, and render industry productive. There is no\r\ncondition so low, if it be attended with industry and economy, that it\r\nis not benefited by credit, as any one will find, if he will examine and\r\nfollow out its operations.\r\n\r\nSir, if there be any aristocrats in Massachusetts, the people are all\r\naristocrats; because I do not believe there is on earth, in a highly\r\ncivilized society, a greater equality in the condition of men than\r\nexists there. If there be a man in the State who maintains what is\r\ncalled an equipage, has servants in livery, or drives four horses in his\r\ncoach, I am not acquainted with him. On the other hand, there are few\r\nwho are not able to carry their wives and daughters to church in some\r\ndecent conveyance. It is no matter of regret or sorrow to us that few\r\nare very rich; but it is our pride and glory that few are very poor. It\r\nis our still higher pride, and our just boast, as I think, that all her\r\ncitizens possess means of intelligence and education, and that, of all\r\nher productions, she reckons among the very chiefest those which spring\r\nfrom the culture of the mind and the heart.\r\n\r\nMr. President, one of the most striking characteristics of this age in\r\nthe extraordinary progress which it has witnessed in popular knowledge.\r\nA new and powerful impulse has been acting in the social system of late,\r\nproducing this effect in a most remarkable degree. In morals, in\r\npolitics, in art, in literature, there is a vast accession to the number\r\nof readers and to the number of proficients. The present state of\r\npopular knowledge is not the result of a slow and uniform progress,\r\nproceeding through a lapse of years, with the same regular degree of\r\nmotion. It is evidently the result of some new causes, brought into\r\npowerful action, and producing their consequences rapidly and\r\nstrikingly. What, Sir, are these causes?\r\n\r\nThis is not an occasion, Sir, for discussing such a question at length;\r\nallow me to say, however, that the improved state of popular knowledge\r\nis but the necessary result of the improved condition of the great mass\r\nof the people. Knowledge is not one of our merely physical wants. Life\r\nmay be sustained without it. But, in order to live, men must be fed and\r\nclothed and sheltered; and in a state of things in which one's whole\r\nlabor can do no more than procure clothes, food, and shelter, he can\r\nhave no time nor means for mental improvement. Knowledge, therefore, is\r\nnot attained, and cannot be attained, till there is some degree of\r\nrespite from daily manual toil and never-ending drudgery. Whenever a\r\nless degree of labor will produce the absolute necessaries of life, then\r\nthere come leisure and means both to teach and to learn.\r\n\r\nIf this great and wonderful extension of popular knowledge be the result\r\nof an improved condition, it may, in the next place, well be asked, What\r\nare the causes which have thus suddenly produced that great improvement?\r\nHow is it that the means of food, clothing, and shelter are now so much\r\nmore cheaply and abundantly procured than formerly? Sir, the main cause\r\nI take to be the progress of scientific art, or a new extension of the\r\napplication of science to art. This it is which has so much\r\ndistinguished the last half-century in Europe and in America, and its\r\neffects are everywhere visible, and especially among us. Man has found\r\nnew allies and auxiliaries in the powers of nature and in the inventions\r\nof mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe general doctrine of political economy is, that wealth consists in\r\nwhatever is useful or convenient to man, and that labor is the producing\r\ncause of all this wealth. This is very true. But, then, what is labor?\r\nIn the sense of political writers, and in common language, it means\r\nhuman industry; in a philosophical view, it may receive a much more\r\ncomprehensive meaning. It is not, in that view, human toil only, the\r\nmere action of thews and muscles; but it is any active agency which,\r\nworking upon the materials with which the world is supplied, brings\r\nforth products useful or convenient to man. The materials of wealth are\r\nin the earth, in the seas, and in their natural and unaided productions.\r\nLabor obtains these materials, works upon them, and fashions them to\r\nhuman use. Now it has been the object of scientific art, or of the\r\napplication of science to art, to increase this active agency, to\r\naugment its power, by creating millions of laborers in the form of\r\nmachines all but automatic, all to be diligently employed and kept at\r\nwork by the force of natural powers. To this end these natural powers,\r\nprincipally those of steam and falling water, are subsidized and taken\r\ninto human employment. Spinning-machines, power-looms, and all the\r\nmechanical devices, acting, among other operatives, in the factories and\r\nworkshops, are but so many laborers. They are usually denominated\r\nlabor-_saving_ machines, but it would be more just to call them\r\nlabor-_doing_ machines. They are made to be active agents; to have\r\nmotion, and to produce effect; and though without intelligence, they are\r\nguided by laws of science, which are exact and perfect, and they produce\r\nresults, therefore, in general, more accurate than the human hand is\r\ncapable of producing. When we look upon one of these, we behold a mute\r\nfellow-laborer, of immense power, of mathematical exactness, and of\r\never-during and unwearied effort. And while he is thus a most skilful\r\nand productive laborer, he is a non-consumer, at least beyond the wants\r\nof his mechanical being. He is not clamorous for food, raiment, or\r\nshelter, and makes no demands for the expenses of education. The eating\r\nand drinking, the reading and writing, and the clothes-wearing world,\r\nare benefited by the labors of these co-operatives, in the same way as\r\nif Providence had provided for their service millions of beings, like\r\nourselves in external appearance, able to labor and to toil, and yet\r\nrequiring little or nothing for their own consumption or subsistence; or\r\nrather, as if Providence had created a race of giants, each of whom,\r\ndemanding no more for his support and consumption than a common laborer,\r\nshould yet be able to perform the work of a hundred.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, turn back to the Massachusetts tables of production, and you\r\nwill see that it is these automatic allies and co-operators, and these\r\npowers of nature, thus employed and placed under human direction, which\r\nhave come, with such prodigious effect, to man's aid, in the great\r\nbusiness of procuring the means of living, of comfort, and of wealth,\r\nand which have so swollen the products of her skilful industry. Look at\r\nthese tables once more, Sir, and you will see the effects of labor,\r\nunited with and acting upon capital. Look yet again, and you will see\r\nthat credit, mutual trust, prompt and punctual dealings, and commercial\r\nconfidence, are all mixed up as indispensable elements in the general\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nI will ask you to look yet once more, Sir, and you will perceive that\r\ngeneral competence, great equality in human condition, a degree of\r\npopular knowledge and intelligence nowhere surpassed, if anywhere\r\nequalled, the prevalence of good moral sentiment, and extraordinary\r\ngeneral prosperity, are the result of the whole. Sir, I have done with\r\nMassachusetts. I do not praise the old \"Bay State\" of the Revolution; I\r\nonly present her as she is.\r\n\r\nMr. President, such is the state of things actually existing in the\r\ncountry, and of which I have now given you a sample. And yet there are\r\npersons who constantly clamor against this state of things. They call it\r\naristocracy. They excite the poor to make war upon the rich, while in\r\ntruth they know not who are either rich or poor. They complain of\r\noppression, speculation, and the pernicious influence of accumulated\r\nwealth. They cry out loudly against all banks and corporations, and all\r\nthe means by which small capitals become united, in order to produce\r\nimportant and beneficial results. They carry on a mad hostility against\r\nall established institutions. They would choke up the fountains of\r\nindustry, and dry all its streams.\r\n\r\nIn a country of unbounded liberty, they clamor against oppression. In a\r\ncountry of perfect equality, they would move heaven and earth against\r\nprivilege and monopoly. In a country where property is more equally\r\ndivided than anywhere else, they rend the air with the shouting of\r\nagrarian doctrines. In a country where the wages of labor are high\r\nbeyond all parallel, and where lands are cheap, and the means of living\r\nlow, they would teach the laborer that he is but an oppressed slave.\r\nSir, what can such men want? What do they mean? They can want nothing,\r\nSir, but to enjoy the fruits of other men's labor. They can mean nothing\r\nbut disturbance and disorder, the diffusion of corrupt principles, and\r\nthe destruction of the moral sentiments and moral habits of society. A\r\nlicentiousness of feeling and of action is sometimes produced by\r\nprosperity itself. Men cannot always resist the temptation to which they\r\nare exposed by the very abundance of the bounties of Providence, and the\r\nvery happiness of their own condition; as the steed, full of the\r\npasture, will sometimes throw himself against its enclosures, break away\r\nfrom its confinement, and, feeling now free from needless restraint,\r\nbetake himself to the moors and barrens, where want, erelong, brings him\r\nto his senses, and starvation and death close his career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON THE POLITICAL COURSE OF MR. CALHOUN, IN 1838.\r\n\r\nFROM THE SAME SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving had occasion, Mr. President, to speak of nullification and the\r\nnullifiers, I beg leave to say that I have not done so for any purpose\r\nof reproach. Certainly, Sir, I see no possible connection, myself,\r\nbetween their principles or opinions, and the support of this\r\nmeasure.[1] They, however, must speak for themselves. They may have\r\nintrusted the bearing of their standard, for aught I know, to the hands\r\nof the honorable member from South Carolina; and I perceived last\r\nsession what I perceive now, that in his opinion there is a connection\r\nbetween these projects of government and the doctrines of nullification.\r\nI can only say, Sir, that it will be marvellous to me, if that banner,\r\nthough it be said to be tattered and torn, shall yet be lowered in\r\nobeisance, and laid at the footstool of executive power. To the\r\nsustaining of that power, the passage of this bill is of the utmost\r\nimportance. The administration will regard its success as being to them,\r\nwhat Cromwell said the battle of Worcester was to him, \"a crowning\r\nmercy.\" Whether gentlemen, who have distinguished themselves so much by\r\ntheir extreme jealousy of this government, shall now find it consistent\r\nwith their principles to give their aid in effecting this consummation,\r\nremains to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe next exposition of the honorable gentleman's sentiments and opinions\r\nis in his letter of the 3d of November.\r\n\r\nThis letter, Sir, is a curiosity. As a paper describing political\r\noperations, and exhibiting political opinions, it is without a parallel.\r\nIts phrase is altogether military. It reads like a despatch, or a\r\nbulletin from head-quarters. It is full of attacks, assaults, and\r\nrepulses. It recounts movements and counter-movements; speaks of\r\noccupying one position, falling back upon another, and advancing to a\r\nthird; it has positions to cover enemies, and positions to hold allies\r\nin check. Meantime, the celerity of all these operations reminds one of\r\nthe rapidity of the military actions of the king of Prussia, in the\r\nSeven Years' war. Yesterday, he was in the South, giving battle to the\r\nAustrian; to-day he is in Saxony, or Silesia. Instantly he is found to\r\nhave traversed the Electorate, and is facing the Russian and the Swede\r\non his northern frontier. If you look for his place on the map, before\r\nyou find it he has quitted it. He is always marching, flying, falling\r\nback, wheeling, attacking, defending, surprising; fighting everywhere,\r\nand fighting all the time. In one particular, however, the campaigns\r\ndescribed in this letter are conducted in a different manner from those\r\nof the great Frederick. I think we nowhere read, in the narrative of\r\nFrederick's achievements, of his taking a position to cover an enemy, or\r\na position to hold an ally in check. These refinements in the science of\r\ntactics and of war are of more recent discovery.\r\n\r\nMr. President, public men must certainly be allowed to change their\r\nopinions, and their associations, whenever they see fit. No one doubts\r\nthis. Men may have grown wiser; they may have attained to better and\r\nmore correct views of great public subjects. It would be unfortunate, if\r\nthere were any code which should oblige men, in public or private life,\r\nto adhere to opinions once entertained, in spite of experience and\r\nbetter knowledge, and against their own convictions of their erroneous\r\ncharacter. Nevertheless, Sir, it must be acknowledged, that what appears\r\nto be a sudden, as well as a great change, naturally produces a shock. I\r\nconfess that, for one, I was shocked when the honorable gentleman, at\r\nthe last session, espoused this bill of the administration. And when I\r\nfirst read this letter of November, and, in the short space of a column\r\nand a half, ran through such a succession of political movements, all\r\nterminating in placing the honorable member in the ranks of our\r\nopponents, and entitling him to take his seat, as he has done, among\r\nthem, if not at their head, I confess I felt still greater surprise. All\r\nthis seemed a good deal too abrupt. Sudden movements of the affections,\r\nwhether personal or political, are a little out of nature.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, Sir, some of the wits of England wrote a mock play,\r\nintended to ridicule the unnatural and false feeling, the\r\n_sentimentality_ of a certain German school of literature. In this play,\r\ntwo strangers are brought together at an inn. While they are warming\r\nthemselves at the fire, and before their acquaintance is yet five\r\nminutes old, one springs up and exclaims to the other, \"A sudden thought\r\nstrikes me! Let us swear an eternal friendship!\" This affectionate offer\r\nwas instantly accepted, and the friendship duly sworn, unchangeable and\r\neternal! Now, Sir, how long this eternal friendship lasted, or in what\r\nmanner it ended, those who wish to know may learn by referring to the\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nBut it seerns to me, Sir, that the honorable member has carried his\r\npolitical sentimentality a good deal higher than the flight of the\r\nGerman school: for he appears to have fallen suddenly in love, not with\r\nstrangers, but with opponents. Here we all had been, Sir, contending\r\nagainst the progress of executive power, and more particularly, and most\r\nstrenuously, against the projects and experiments of the administration\r\nupon the currency. The honorable member stood among us, not only as an\r\nassociate, but as a leader. We thought we were making some headway. The\r\npeople appeared to be coming to our support and our assistance. The\r\ncountry had been roused, every successive election weakening the\r\nstrength of the adversary, and increasing our own. We were in this\r\ncareer of success carried strongly forward by the current of public\r\nopinion, and only needed to hear the cheering voice of the honorable\r\nmember,\r\n\r\n     \"Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more!\"\r\n\r\nand we should have prostrated for ever this anti-constitutional,\r\nanti-commercial, anti-republican, and anti-American policy of the\r\nadministration. But instead of these encouraging and animating accents,\r\nbehold! in the very crisis of our affairs, on the very eve of victory,\r\nthe honorable member cries out to the enemy,--not to us, his allies, but\r\nto the enemy: \"Hollo! A sudden thought strikes me! I abandon my allies!\r\nNow I think of it, they have always been my oppressors! I abandon them,\r\nand now let _you and me_ swear an eternal friendship!\" Such a\r\nproposition, from such a quarter, Sir, was not likely to be long\r\nwithstood. The other party was a little coy, but, upon the whole,\r\nnothing loath. After proper hesitation, and a little decorous blushing,\r\nit owned the soft impeachment, admitted an equally sudden sympathetic\r\nimpulse on its own side; and, since few words are wanted where hearts\r\nare already known, the honorable gentleman takes his place among his new\r\nfriends amidst greetings and caresses, and is already enjoying the\r\nsweets of an eternal friendship.\r\n\r\nIn this letter, Mr. President, the writer says, in substance, that he\r\nsaw, at the commencement of the last session, that affairs had reached\r\nthe point when he and his friends, according to the course they should\r\ntake, would reap the full harvest of their long and arduous struggle\r\nagainst the encroachments and abuses of the general government, or lose\r\nthe fruits of all their labors. At that time, he says, State\r\ninterposition (viz. Nullification) had overthrown the protective tariff\r\nand the American system, and put a stop to Congressional usurpation;\r\nthat he had previously been united with the National Republicans; but\r\nthat, in joining such allies, he was not insensible to the embarrassment\r\nof his position; that with them victory itself was dangerous, and that\r\ntherefore he had been waiting for events; that now (that is to say, in\r\nSeptember last) the joint attacks of the allies had brought down\r\nexecutive power; that the administration had become divested of power\r\nand influence, and that it was now clear that the combined attacks of\r\nthe allied forces would utterly overthrow and demolish it. All this he\r\nsaw. But he saw, too, as he says, that in that case the victory would\r\ninure, not to him or his cause, but to his allies and their cause. I do\r\nnot mean to say that he spoke of personal victories, or alluded to\r\npersonal objects, at all. He spoke of his cause.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to say, then, that never was there before, and never,\r\nprobably, will there be again, so fair an opportunity for himself and\r\nhis friends to carry out _their own principles and policy_, and to reap\r\nthe fruits of their long and arduous struggle. These principles and this\r\npolicy, Sir, be it remembered, he represents, all along, as identified\r\nwith the principles and policy of nullification. And he makes use of\r\nthis glorious opportunity by refusing to join his late allies in any\r\nfurther attack on those in power, and rallying anew the old State-rights\r\nparty to hold in check their old opponents, the National Republican\r\nparty. This, he says, would enable him to prevent the complete\r\nascendency of his allies, and to compel the Southern division of the\r\nadministration party to occupy the ground of which he proposes to take\r\npossession, to wit, the ground of the old State-rights party. They will\r\nhave, he says, no other alternative.\r\n\r\nMr. President, stripped of its military language, what is the amount of\r\nall this, but that, finding the administration weak, and likely to be\r\noverthrown, if the opposition continued with undiminished force, he went\r\nover to it, he joined it; intending to act, himself, upon nullification\r\nprinciples, and to compel the Southern members of the administration to\r\nmeet him on those principles?--in other words, to make a nullification\r\nadministration, and to take such part in it as should belong to him and\r\nhis friends. He confesses, Sir, that in thus abandoning his allies, and\r\ntaking a position to cover those in power, he perceived a shock would be\r\ncreated which would require some degree of resolution and firmness. In\r\nthis he was right. A shock, Sir, has been created; yet there he is.\r\n\r\nThis administration, Sir, is represented as succeeding to the last, by\r\nan inheritance of principle. It professes to tread in the footsteps of\r\nits illustrious predecessor. It adopts, generally, the sentiments,\r\nprinciples, and opinions of General Jackson, _proclamation and all_; and\r\nyet, though he be the very prince of nullifiers, and but lately regarded\r\nas the chiefest of sinners, it receives the honorable gentleman with the\r\nutmost complacency. To all appearance, the delight is mutual; they find\r\nhim an able leader, he finds them complying followers. But, Sir, in all\r\nthis movement he understands himself. He means to go ahead, and to take\r\nthem along. He is in the engine-car; he controls the locomotive. His\r\nhand regulates the steam, to increase or retard the speed at his\r\ndiscretion. And as to the occupants of the passenger-cars, Sir, they are\r\nas happy a set of gentlemen as one might desire to see of a summer's\r\nday. They feel that they are in progress; they hope they shall not be\r\nrun off the track; and when they reach the end of their journey, they\r\ndesire to be thankful!\r\n\r\nThe arduous struggle is now all over. Its richest fruits are all\r\nreaped; nullification embraces the sub-treasuries, and oppression and\r\nusurpation will be heard of no more.\r\n\r\nOn the broad surface of the country, Sir, there is a spot called \"the\r\nHermitage.\" In that residence is an occupant very well known, and not a\r\nlittle remarkable both in person and character. Suppose, Sir, the\r\noccupant of the Hermitage were now to open that door, enter the Senate,\r\nwalk forward, and look over the chamber to the seats on the other side.\r\nBe not frightened, gentlemen; it is but fancy's sketch. Suppose he\r\nshould thus come in among us, Sir, and see into whose hands has fallen\r\nthe chief support of that administration, which was, in so great a\r\ndegree, appointed by himself, and which he fondly relied on to maintain\r\nthe principles of his own. If gentlemen were now to see his steady\r\nmilitary step, his erect posture, his compressed lips, his\r\nfirmly-knitted brow, and his eye full of fire, I cannot help thinking,\r\nSir, they would all feel somewhat queer. There would be, I imagine, not\r\na little awkward moving and shifting in their seats. They would expect\r\nsoon to hear the roar of the lion, even if they did not feel his paw.\r\n\r\nSir, the spirit of union is particularly liable to temptation and\r\nseduction in moments of peace and prosperity. In war, this spirit is\r\nstrengthened by a sense of common danger, and by a thousand\r\nrecollections of ancient efforts and ancient glory in a common cause.\r\nBut in the calms of a long peace, and in the absence of all apparent\r\ncauses of alarm, things near gain an ascendency over things remote.\r\nLocal interests and feelings overshadow national sentiments. Our\r\nattention, our regard, and our attachment are every moment solicited to\r\nwhat touches us closest, and we feel less and less the attraction of a\r\ndistant orb. Such tendencies we are bound by true patriotism and by our\r\nlove of union to resist. This is our duty; and the moment, in my\r\njudgment, has arrived when that duty should be performed. We hear, every\r\nday, sentiments and arguments which would become a meeting of envoys,\r\nemployed by separate governments, more than they become the common\r\nlegislature of a united country. Constant appeals are made to local\r\ninterests, to geographical distinctions, and to the policy and the pride\r\nof particular States. It would sometimes appear as if it were a settled\r\npurpose to convince the people that our Union is nothing but a jumble of\r\ndifferent and discordant interests, which must, erelong, be all resolved\r\ninto their original state of separate existence; as if, therefore, it\r\nwas of no great value while it should last, and was not likely to last\r\nlong. The process of disintegration begins by urging as a fact the\r\nexistence of different interests.\r\n\r\nSir, is not the end to which all this leads us obvious? Who does not see\r\nthat, if convictions of this kind take possession of the public mind,\r\nour Union can hereafter be nothing, while it remains, but a connection\r\nwithout harmony; a bond without affection; a theatre for the angry\r\ncontests of local feelings, local objects, and local jealousies? Even\r\nwhile it continues to exist in name, it may by these means become\r\nnothing but the mere form of a united government. My children, and the\r\nchildren of those who sit around me, may meet, perhaps, in this chamber,\r\nin the next generation; but if tendencies now but too obvious be not\r\nchecked, they will meet as strangers and aliens. They will feel no sense\r\nof common interest or common country; they will cherish no common object\r\nof patriotic love. If the same Saxon language shall fall from their\r\nlips, it may be the chief proof that they belong to the same nation. Its\r\nvital principle exhausted and gone, its power of doing good terminated,\r\nthe Union itself, become productive only of strife and contention, must\r\nultimately fall, dishonored and unlamented.\r\n\r\nThe honorable member from Carolina himself habitually indulges in\r\ncharges of usurpation and oppression against the government of his\r\ncountry. He daily denounces its important measures, in the language in\r\nwhich our Revolutionary fathers spoke of the oppressions of the mother\r\ncountry. Not merely against executive usurpation, either real or\r\nsupposed, does he utter these sentiments, but against laws of Congress,\r\nlaws passed by large majorities, laws sanctioned for a course of years\r\nby the people. These laws he proclaims, every hour, to be but a series\r\nof acts of oppression. He speaks of them as if it were an admitted fact,\r\nthat such is their true character. This is the language he utters, these\r\nare the sentiments he expresses, to the rising generation around him.\r\nAre they sentiments and language which are likely to inspire our\r\nchildren with the love of union, to enlarge their patriotism, or to\r\nteach them, and to make them feel, that their destiny has made them\r\ncommon citizens of one great and glorious republic? A principal object\r\nin his late political movements, the gentleman himself tells us, was to\r\n_unite the entire South_; and against whom, or against what, does he\r\nwish to unite the entire South? Is not this the very essence of local\r\nfeeling and local regard? Is it not the acknowledgment of a wish and\r\nobject to create political strength by uniting political opinions\r\ngeographically? While the gentleman thus wishes to unite the entire\r\nSouth, I pray to know, Sir, if he expects me to turn toward the polar\r\nstar, and, acting on the same principle, to utter a cry of Rally! to the\r\nwhole North? Heaven forbid! To the day of my death, neither he nor\r\nothers shall hear such a cry from me.\r\n\r\nFinally, the honorable member declares that he shall now march off,\r\nunder the banner of State rights! March off from whom? March off from\r\nwhat? We have been contending for great principles. We have been\r\nstruggling to maintain the liberty and to restore the prosperity of the\r\ncountry; we have made these struggles here, in the national councils,\r\nwith the old flag, the true American flag, the Eagle, and the Stars and\r\nStripes, waving over the chamber in which we sit. He now tells us,\r\nhowever, that he marches off under the State-rights banner!\r\n\r\nLet him go. I remain. I am where I ever have been, and ever mean to be.\r\nHere, standing on the platform of the general Constitution, a platform\r\nbroad enough and firm enough to uphold every interest of the whole\r\ncountry, I shall still be found. Intrusted with some part in the\r\nadministration of that Constitution, I intend to act in its spirit, and\r\nin the spirit of those who framed it. Yes, Sir, I would act as if our\r\nfathers, who formed it for us and who bequeathed it to us, were looking\r\non me; as if I could see their venerable forms bending down to behold us\r\nfrom the abodes above. I would act, too, as if the eye of posterity was\r\ngazing on me.\r\n\r\nStanding thus, as in the full gaze of our ancestors and our posterity,\r\nhaving received this inheritance from the former, to be transmitted to\r\nthe latter, and feeling that, if I am born for any good, in my day and\r\ngeneration, it is for the good of the whole country, no local policy or\r\nlocal feeling, no temporary impulse, shall induce me to yield my\r\nfoothold on the Constitution of the Union. I move off under no banner\r\nnot known to the whole American people, and to their Constitution and\r\nlaws. No, Sir; these walls, these columns,\r\n\r\n                        \"shall fly\r\n    From their firm base as soon as I.\"\r\n\r\nI came into public life, Sir, in the service of the United States. On\r\nthat broad altar, my earliest, and all my public vows, have been made. I\r\npropose to serve no other master. So far as depends on any agency of\r\nmine, they shall continue united States; united in interest and in\r\naffection; united in every thing in regard to which the Constitution has\r\ndecreed their union; united in war, for the common defence, the common\r\nrenown, and the common glory; and united, compacted, knit firmly\r\ntogether in peace, for the common prosperity and happiness of ourselves\r\nand our children.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Sub-Treasury.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY TO MR. CALHOUN.\r\n\r\nSPEECH DELIVERED IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, ON THE 22D OF\r\nMARCH, 1838, IN ANSWER TO MR. CALHOUN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[On Thursday, the 22d of March, Mr. Calhoun spoke at length in answer to\r\nMr. Webster's speech of the 12th of March.\r\n\r\nWhen he had concluded, Mr. Webster immediately rose, and addressed the\r\nSenate as follows.]\r\n\r\nMr. President,--I came rather late to the Senate this morning, and,\r\nhappening to meet a friend on the Avenue, I was admonished to hasten my\r\nsteps, as \"the war was to be carried into Africa,\" and I was expected to\r\nbe annihilated. I lost no time in following the advice, Sir, since it\r\nwould be awkward for one to be annihilated without knowing any thing\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, the war has been carried into Africa. The honorable member\r\nhas made an expedition into regions as remote from the subject of this\r\ndebate as the orb of Jupiter from that of our earth. He has spoken of\r\nthe tariff, of slavery, and of the late war. Of all this I do not\r\ncomplain. On the contrary, if it be his pleasure to allude to all or any\r\nof these topics, for any purpose whatever, I am ready at all times to\r\nhear him.\r\n\r\nSir, this carrying the war into Africa, which has become so common a\r\nphrase among us, is, indeed, imitating a great example; but it is an\r\nexample which is not always followed with success. In the first place,\r\nevery man, though he be a man of talent and genius, is not a Scipio; and\r\nin the next place, as I recollect this part of Roman and Carthaginian\r\nhistory,--the gentleman may be more accurate, but, as I recollect it,\r\nwhen Scipio resolved upon carrying the war into Africa, Hannibal was not\r\nat home. Now, Sir, I am very little like Hannibal, but I am at home; and\r\nwhen Scipio Africanus South-Caroliniensis brings the war into my\r\nterritories, I shall not leave their defence to Asdrubal, nor Syphax,\r\nnor anybody else. I meet him on the shore, at his landing, and propose\r\nbut one contest.\r\n\r\n                      \"Concurritur; horae\r\n    Momento cita mors venit, aut victoria laeta.\"\r\n\r\nMr. President, I had made up my mind that, if the honorable gentleman\r\nshould confine himself to a reply in the ordinary way, I would not say\r\nanother syllable. But he has not done so. He has gone off into topics\r\nquite remote from all connection with revenue, commerce, finance, or\r\nsub-treasuries, and invites to a discussion which, however uninteresting\r\nto the public at the present moment, is too personal to be declined by\r\nme.\r\n\r\nHe says, Sir, that I undertook to compare my political character and\r\nconduct with his. Far from it. I attempted no such thing. I compared the\r\ngentleman's political opinions at different times with one another, and\r\nexpressed decided opposition to those which he now holds. And I did,\r\ncertainly, advert to the general tone and drift of the gentleman's\r\nsentiments and expressions for some years past, in their bearing on the\r\nUnion, with such remarks as I thought they deserved; but I instituted no\r\ncomparison between him and myself. He may institute one if he pleases,\r\nand when he pleases. Seeking nothing of this kind, I avoid nothing. Let\r\nit be remembered, that the gentleman began the debate, by attempting to\r\nexhibit a contrast between the present opinions and conduct of my\r\nfriends and myself, and our recent opinions and conduct. Here is the\r\nfirst charge of inconsistency; let the public judge whether he has made\r\nit good. He says, Sir, that on several questions I have taken different\r\nsides, at different times; let him show it. If he shows any change of\r\nopinion, I shall be called on to give a reason, and to account for it. I\r\nleave it to the country to say whether, as yet, he has shown any such\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, before attempting that, he has something else to say. He had\r\nprepared, it seems, to draw comparisons himself. He had intended to say\r\nsomething, if time had allowed, upon our respective opinions and conduct\r\nin regard to the war. If time had allowed! Sir, time does allow, time\r\nmust allow. A general remark of that kind ought not to be, cannot be,\r\nleft to produce its effect, when that effect is obviously intended to be\r\nunfavorable. Why did the gentleman allude to my votes or my opinions\r\nrespecting the war at all, unless he had something to say? Does he wish\r\nto leave an undefined impression that something was done, or something\r\nsaid, by me, not now capable of defence or justification? something not\r\nreconcilable with true patriotism? He means that, or nothing. And now,\r\nSir, let him bring the matter forth; let him take the responsibility of\r\nthe accusation; let him state his facts. I am here to answer; I am here,\r\nthis day, to answer. Now is the time, and now the hour. I think we read,\r\nSir, that one of the good spirits would not bring against the Arch-enemy\r\nof mankind a railing accusation; and what is railing but general\r\nreproach, an imputation without fact, time, or circumstance? Sir, I call\r\nfor particulars. The gentleman knows my whole conduct well; indeed, the\r\njournals show it all, from the moment I came into Congress till the\r\npeace. If I have done, then, Sir, any thing unpatriotic, any thing\r\nwhich, as far as love to country goes, will not bear comparison with his\r\nor any man's conduct, let it now be stated. Give me the fact, the time,\r\nthe manner. He speaks of the war; that which we call the late war,\r\nthough it is now twenty-five years since it terminated. He would leave\r\nan impression that I opposed it. How? I was not in Congress when war was\r\ndeclared, nor in public life anywhere. I was pursuing my profession,\r\nkeeping company with judges and jurors, and plaintiffs and defendants.\r\nIf I had been in Congress, and had enjoyed the benefit of hearing the\r\nhonorable gentleman's speeches, for aught I can say, I might have\r\nconcurred with him. But I was not in public life. I never had been, for\r\na single hour; and was in no situation, therefore, to oppose or to\r\nsupport the declaration of war. I am speaking to the fact, Sir; and if\r\nthe gentleman has any fact, let us know it. Well, Sir, I came into\r\nCongress during the war. I found it waged, and raging. And what did I do\r\nhere to oppose it? Look to the journals. Let the honorable gentleman tax\r\nhis memory. Bring up any thing, if there be any thing to bring up, not\r\nshowing error of opinion, but showing want of loyalty or fidelity to the\r\ncountry. I did not agree to all that was proposed, nor did the honorable\r\nmember. I did not approve of every measure, nor did he. The war had been\r\npreceded by the restrictive system and the embargo. As a private\r\nindividual, I certainly did not think well of these measures. It\r\nappeared to me that the embargo annoyed ourselves as much as our\r\nenemies, while it destroyed the business and cramped the spirits of the\r\npeople. In this opinion I may have been right or wrong, but the\r\ngentleman was himself of the same opinion. He told us the other day, as\r\na proof of his independence of party on great questions, that he\r\ndiffered with his friends on the subject of the embargo. He was\r\ndecidedly and unalterably opposed to it. It furnishes in his judgment,\r\ntherefore, no imputation either on my patriotism, or on the soundness of\r\nmy political opinions, that I was opposed to it also. I mean opposed in\r\nopinion; for I was not in Congress, and had nothing to do with the act\r\ncreating the embargo. And as to opposition to measures for carrying on\r\nthe war, after I came into Congress, I again say, let the gentleman\r\nspecify; let him lay his finger on any thing calling for an answer, and\r\nhe shall have an answer.\r\n\r\nMr. President, you were yourself in the House during a considerable part\r\nof this time. The honorable gentleman may make a witness of you. He may\r\nmake a witness of anybody else. He may be his own witness. Give us but\r\nsome fact, some charge, something capable in itself either of being\r\nproved or disproved. Prove any thing, state any thing, not consistent\r\nwith honorable and patriotic conduct, and I am ready to answer it. Sir,\r\nI am glad this subject has been alluded to in a manner which justifies\r\nme in taking public notice of it; because I am well aware that, for ten\r\nyears past, infinite pains has been taken to find something, in the\r\nrange of these topics, which might create prejudice against me in the\r\ncountry. The journals have all been pored over, and the reports\r\nransacked, and scraps of paragraphs and half-sentences have been\r\ncollected, fraudulently put together, and then made to flare out as if\r\nthere had been some discovery. But all this failed. The next resort was\r\nto supposed correspondence. My letters were sought for, to learn if, in\r\nthe confidence of private friendship, I had ever said any thing which an\r\nenemy could make use of. With this view, the vicinity of my former\r\nresidence has been searched, as with a lighted candle. New Hampshire has\r\nbeen explored, from the mouth of the Merrimack to the White Hills. In\r\none instance a gentleman had left the State, gone five hundred miles\r\noff, and died. His papers were examined; a letter was found, and I have\r\nunderstood it was brought to Washington; a conclave was held to consider\r\nit, and the result was, that, if there was nothing else against Mr.\r\nWebster, the matter had better be let alone. Sir, I hope to make\r\neverybody of that opinion who brings against me a charge of want of\r\npatriotism. Errors of opinion can be found, doubtless, on many subjects;\r\nbut as conduct flows from the feelings which animate the heart, I know\r\nthat no act of my life has had its origin in the want of ardent love of\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSir, when I came to Congress, I found the honorable gentleman a leading\r\nmember of the House of Representatives. Well, Sir, in what did we\r\ndiffer? One of the first measures of magnitude, after I came here, was\r\nMr. Dallas's[1] proposition for a bank. It was a war measure. It was\r\nurged as being absolutely necessary to enable government to carry on the\r\nwar. Government wanted revenue; such a bank, it was hoped, would furnish\r\nit; and on that account it was most warmly pressed and urged on\r\nCongress. You remember all this, Mr. President. You remember how much\r\nsome persons supposed the success of the war and the salvation of the\r\ncountry depended on carrying that measure. Yet the honorable member from\r\nSouth Carolina opposed this bill. He now takes to himself a good deal of\r\nmerit, none too much, but still a good deal of merit, for having\r\ndefeated it. Well, Sir, I agreed with him. It was a mere paper bank; a\r\nmachine for fabricating irredeemable paper. It was a new form for paper\r\nmoney; and instead of benefiting the country, I thought it would plunge\r\nit deeper and deeper in difficulty. I made a speech on the subject; it\r\nhas often been quoted. There it is; let whoever pleases read and examine\r\nit. I am not proud of it for any ability it exhibits; on the other hand,\r\nI am not ashamed of it for the spirit which it manifests. But, Sir, I\r\nsay again that the gentleman himself took the lead against this measure,\r\nthis darling measure of the administration. I followed him; if I was\r\nseduced into error, or into unjustifiable opposition, there sits my\r\nseducer.\r\n\r\nWhat, Sir, were other leading sentiments or leading measures of that\r\nday? On what other subjects did men differ? The gentleman has adverted\r\nto one, and that a most important one; I mean the navy. He says, and\r\nsays truly, that at the commencement of the war the navy was unpopular.\r\nIt was unpopular with his friends, who then controlled the politics of\r\nthe country. But he says he differed with his friends; in this respect\r\nhe resisted party influence and party connection, and was the friend and\r\nadvocate of the navy. Sir, I commend him for it. He showed his wisdom.\r\nThat gallant little navy soon fought itself into favor, and showed that\r\nno man who had placed reliance on it had been disappointed.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, in all this I was exactly of the opinion of the honorable\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nSir, I do not know when my opinion of the importance of a naval force to\r\nthe United States had its origin. I can give no date to my present\r\nsentiments on this subject, because I never entertained different\r\nsentiments. I remember, Sir, that immediately after coming into my\r\nprofession, at a period when the navy was most unpopular, when it was\r\ncalled by all sorts of hard names and designated by many coarse\r\nepithets, on one of those occasions on which young men address their\r\nneighbors, I ventured to put forth a boy's hand in defence of the navy.\r\nI insisted on its importance, its adaptation to our circumstances and to\r\nour national character, and its indispensable necessity, if we intended\r\nto maintain and extend our commerce. These opinions and sentiments I\r\nbrought into Congress; and the first time in which I presumed to speak\r\non the topics of the day, I attempted to urge on the House a greater\r\nattention to the naval service. There were divers modes of prosecuting\r\nthe war. On these modes, or on the degree of attention and expense which\r\nshould be bestowed on each, different men held different opinions. I\r\nconfess I looked with most hope to the results of naval warfare, and\r\ntherefore I invoked government to invigorate and strengthen that arm of\r\nthe national defence. I invoked it to seek its enemy upon the seas, to\r\ngo where every auspicious indication pointed, and where the whole heart\r\nand soul of the country would go with it.\r\n\r\nSir, we were at war with the greatest maritime power on earth. England\r\nhad gained an ascendency on the seas over all the combined powers of\r\nEurope. She had been at war twenty years. She had tried her fortunes on\r\nthe Continent, but generally with no success. At one time the whole\r\nContinent had been closed against her. A long line of armed exterior, an\r\nunbroken hostile array, frowned upon her from the Gulf of Archangel,\r\nround the promontory of Spain and Portugal, to the extreme point of\r\nItaly. There was not a port which an English ship could enter.\r\nEverywhere on the land the genius of her great enemy had triumphed. He\r\nhad defeated armies, crushed coalitions, and overturned thrones; but,\r\nlike the fabled giant, he was unconquerable only while he touched the\r\nland. On the ocean he was powerless. That field of fame was his\r\nadversary's, and her meteor flag was streaming in triumph over its whole\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nTo her maritime ascendency England owed every thing, and we were now at\r\nwar with her. One of the most charming of her poets had said of her,--\r\n\r\n    \"Her march is o'er the mountain waves,\r\n    Her home is on the deep.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, since we were at war with her, I was for intercepting this\r\nmarch; I was for calling upon her, and paying our respects to her, at\r\nhome; I was for giving her to know that we, too, had a right of way over\r\nthe seas, and that our marine officers and our sailors were not entire\r\nstrangers on the bosom of the deep. I was for doing something more with\r\nour navy than keeping it on our own shores, for the protection of our\r\ncoasts and harbors; I was for giving play to its gallant and burning\r\nspirit; for allowing it to go forth upon the seas, and to encounter, on\r\nan open and an equal field, whatever the proudest or the bravest of the\r\nenemy could bring against it. I knew the character of its officers and\r\nthe spirit of its seamen; and I knew that, in their hands, though the\r\nflag of the country might go down to the bottom, yet, while defended by\r\nthem, that it could never be dishonored or disgraced.\r\n\r\nSince she was our enemy, and a most powerful enemy, I was for touching\r\nher, if we could, in the very apple of her eye; for reaching the highest\r\nfeather in her cap; for clutching at the very brightest jewel in her\r\ncrown. There seemed to me to be a peculiar propriety in all this, as the\r\nwar was undertaken for the redress of maritime injuries alone. It was a\r\nwar declared for free trade and sailors' rights. The ocean, therefore,\r\nwas the proper theatre for deciding this controversy with our enemy, and\r\non that theatre it was my ardent wish that our own power should be\r\nconcentrated to the utmost.\r\n\r\nSo much, Sir, for the war, and for my conduct and opinions as connected\r\nwith it. And, as I do not mean to recur to this subject often, nor ever,\r\nunless indispensably necessary, I repeat the demand for any charge, any\r\naccusation, any allegation whatever, that throws me behind the honorable\r\ngentleman, or behind any other man, in honor, in fidelity, in devoted\r\nlove to that country in which I was born, which has honored me, and\r\nwhich I serve. I, who seldom deal in defiance, now, here, in my place,\r\nboldly defy the honorable member to put his insinuation in the form of a\r\ncharge, and to support that charge by any proof whatever.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman has adverted to the subject of slavery. On this subject,\r\nhe says, I have not proved myself a friend to the South. Why, Sir, the\r\nonly proof is, that I did not vote for his resolutions.\r\n\r\nSir, this is a very grave matter; it is a subject very exciting and\r\ninflammable. I take, of course, all the responsibility belonging to my\r\nopinions; but I desire these opinions to be understood, and fairly\r\nstated. If I am to be regarded as an enemy to the South, because I could\r\nnot support the gentleman's resolutions, be it so. I cannot purchase\r\nfavor from any quarter, by the sacrifice of clear and conscientious\r\nconvictions. The principal resolution declared that Congress had\r\nplighted its faith not to interfere either with slavery or the slave\r\ntrade in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, this is quite a new idea. I never heard it advanced until this\r\nsession. I have heard gentlemen contend that no such power was in the\r\nConstitution; but the notion, that, though the Constitution contained\r\nthe power, yet Congress had plighted its faith not to exercise such a\r\npower, is an entire novelty, so far as I know. I must say, Sir, it\r\nappeared to me little else than an attempt to put a prohibition into the\r\nConstitution, because there was none there already. For this supposed\r\nplighting of the public faith, or the faith of Congress, I saw no\r\nground, either in the history of the government, or in any one fact, or\r\nin any argument. I therefore could not vote for the proposition.\r\n\r\nSir, it is now several years since I took care to make my opinion known,\r\nthat this government has, constitutionally, nothing to do with slavery,\r\nas it exists in the States. That opinion is entirely unchanged. I stand\r\nsteadily by the resolution of the House of Representatives, adopted,\r\nafter much consideration, at the commencement of the government, which\r\nwas, that Congress has no authority to interfere in the emancipation of\r\nslaves, or in the treatment of them, within any of the States; it\r\nremaining with the several States alone to provide any regulations\r\ntherein, which humanity and true policy may require. This, in my\r\nopinion, is the Constitution and the law. I feel bound by it. I have\r\nquoted the resolution often. It expresses the judgment of men of all\r\nparts of the country, deliberately and coolly formed; and it expresses\r\nmy judgment, and I shall adhere to it. But this has nothing to do with\r\nthe other constitutional question; that is to say, the mere\r\nconstitutional question whether Congress has the power to regulate\r\nslavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nOn such a question, Sir, when I am asked what the Constitution is, or\r\nwhether any power granted by it has been compromised away, or, indeed,\r\ncould be compromised away, I must express my honest opinion, and always\r\nshall express it, if I say any thing, notwithstanding it may not meet\r\nconcurrence either in the South, or the North, or the East, or the West.\r\nI cannot express by my vote what I do not believe. The gentleman has\r\nchosen to bring that subject into this debate, with which it has no\r\nconcern; but he may make the most of it, if he thinks he can produce\r\nunfavorable impressions against me at the South from my negative to his\r\nfifth resolution. As to the rest of them, they were commonplaces,\r\ngenerally, or abstractions; in regard to which, one may well feel\r\nhimself not called on to vote at all.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, in regard to the tariff. That is a long chapter, but I am\r\nquite ready to go over it with the honorable member.\r\n\r\nHe charges me with inconsistency. That may depend on deciding what\r\ninconsistency is, in respect to such subjects, and how it is to be\r\nproved. I will state the facts, for I have them in my mind somewhat more\r\nfully than the honorable member has himself presented them. Let us begin\r\nat the beginning. In 1816 I voted against the tariff law which then\r\npassed. In 1824 I again voted against the tariff law which was then\r\nproposed, and which passed. A majority of New England votes, in 1824,\r\nwere against the tariff system. The bill received but one vote from\r\nMassachusetts; but it passed. The policy was established. New England\r\nacquiesced in it; conformed her business and pursuits to it; embarked\r\nher capital, and employed her labor, in manufactures; and I certainly\r\nadmit that, from that time, I have felt bound to support interests thus\r\ncalled into being, and into importance, by the settled policy of the\r\ngovernment. I have stated this often here, and often elsewhere. The\r\nground is defensible, and I maintain it.\r\n\r\nAs to the resolutions adopted in Boston in 1820, and which resolutions\r\nhe has caused to be read, and which he says he presumes I prepared, I\r\nhave no recollection of having drawn the resolutions, and do not believe\r\nI did. But I was at the meeting, and addressed the meeting, and what I\r\nsaid on that occasion was produced here, and read in the Senate, years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions, Sir, were opposed to the commencing of a high tariff\r\npolicy. I was opposed to it, and spoke against it; the city of Boston\r\nwas opposed to it; the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was opposed to it.\r\nRemember, Sir, that this was in 1820. This opposition continued till\r\n1824. The votes all show this. But in 1824 the question was decided; the\r\ngovernment entered upon the policy; it invited men to embark their\r\nproperty and their means of living in it. Individuals thus encouraged\r\nhave done this to a great extent; and therefore I say, so long as the\r\nmanufactures shall need reasonable and just protection from government,\r\nI shall be disposed to give it to them. What is there, Sir, in all this,\r\nfor the gentleman to complain of? Would he have us always oppose the\r\npolicy adopted by the country on a great question? Would he have\r\nminorities never submit to the will of majorities?\r\n\r\nI remember to have said, Sir, at the meeting in Faneuil Hall, that\r\nprotection appeared to be regarded as incidental to revenue, and that\r\nthe incident could not be carried fairly above the principal; in other\r\nwords, that duties ought not to be laid for the mere object of\r\nprotection. I believe that proposition to be substantially correct. I\r\nbelieve that, if the power of protection be inferred only from the\r\nrevenue power, the protection could only be incidental.\r\n\r\nBut I have said in this place before, and I repeat it now, that Mr.\r\nMadison's publication after that period, and his declaration that the\r\nConvention did intend to grant the power of protection under the\r\ncommercial clause, placed the subject in a new and a clear light. I will\r\nadd, Sir, that a paper drawn up apparently with the sanction of Dr.\r\nFranklin, and read to a circle of friends at his house, on the eve of\r\nthe assembling of the Convention, respecting the powers which the\r\nproposed new government ought to possess, shows plainly that, in\r\nregulating commerce, it was expected that Congress would adopt a course\r\nwhich should protect the manufactures of the North. He certainly went\r\ninto the Convention himself under that conviction.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, and now what does the gentleman make out against me in\r\nrelation to the tariff? What laurels does he gather in this part of\r\nAfrica? I opposed the _policy_ of the tariff, until it had become the\r\nsettled and established policy of the country. I have never questioned\r\nthe constitutional power of Congress to grant protection, except so far\r\nas the remark made in Faneuil Hall goes, which remark respects only the\r\nlength to which protection might properly be carried, so far as the\r\npower is derived from the authority to lay duties on imports. But the\r\npolicy being established, and a great part of the country having placed\r\nvast interests at stake in it, I have not disturbed it; on the contrary,\r\nI have insisted that it ought not to be disturbed. If there be\r\ninconsistency in all this, the gentleman is at liberty to blazon it\r\nforth; let him see what he can make of it.\r\n\r\nHere, Sir, I cease to speak of myself; and respectfully ask pardon of\r\nthe Senate for having so long detained it upon any thing so unimportant\r\nas what relates merely to my own public conduct and opinions.\r\n\r\nSir, the honorable member is pleased to suppose that our spleen is\r\nexcited, because he has interfered to snatch from us a victory over the\r\nadministration. If he means by this any personal disappointment, I shall\r\nnot think it worth while to make a remark upon it. If he means a\r\ndisappointment at his quitting us while we were endeavoring to arrest\r\nthe present policy of the administration, why then I admit, Sir, that I,\r\nfor one, felt that disappointment deeply. It is the policy of the\r\nadministration, its principles, and its measures, which I oppose. It is\r\nnot persons, but things; not men, but measures. I do wish most fervently\r\nto put an end to this anti-commercial policy; and if the overthrow of\r\nthe policy shall be followed by the political defeat of its authors,\r\nwhy, Sir, it is a result which I shall endeavor to meet with equanimity.\r\n\r\nSir, as to the honorable member's wresting the victory from us, or as to\r\nhis ability to sustain the administration in this policy, there may be\r\nsome doubt about that. I trust the citadel will yet be stormed, and\r\ncarried, by the force of public opinion, and that no Hector will be able\r\nto defend its walls.\r\n\r\nBut now, Sir, I must advert to a declaration of the honorable member,\r\nwhich, I confess, did surprise me. The honorable member says, that,\r\npersonally, he and myself have been on friendly terms, but that we\r\nalways differed on great constitutional questions. Sir, this is\r\nastounding. And yet I was partly prepared for it; for I sat here the\r\nother day, and held my breath, while the honorable gentleman declared,\r\nand repeated, that he had always belonged to the State-rights party. And\r\nhe means, by what he has declared to-day, that he has always given to\r\nthe Constitution a construction more limited, better guarded, less\r\nfavorable to the extension of the powers of this government, than that\r\nwhich I have given to it. He has always interpreted it according to the\r\nstrict doctrines of the school of State rights! Sir, if the honorable\r\nmember ever belonged, until very lately, to the State-rights party, the\r\nconnection was very much like a secret marriage. And never was secret\r\nbetter kept. Not only were the espousals not acknowledged, but all\r\nsuspicion was avoided. There was no known familiarity, or even kindness,\r\nbetween them. On the contrary, they acted like parties who were not at\r\nall fond of each other's company.\r\n\r\nSir, is there a man in my hearing, among all the gentlemen now\r\nsurrounding us, many of whom, of both houses, have been here many years,\r\nand know the gentleman and myself perfectly,--is there one who ever\r\nheard, supposed, or dreamed that the honorable member belonged to the\r\nState-rights party before the year 1825? Can any such connection be\r\nproved upon him, can he prove it upon himself, before that time?\r\n\r\nSir, I will show you, before I resume my seat, that it was not until\r\nafter the gentleman took his seat in the chair which you now occupy,\r\nthat any public manifestation, or intimation, was ever given by him of\r\nhis having embraced the peculiar doctrines of the State-rights party.\r\nThe truth is, Sir, the honorable gentleman had acted a very important\r\nand useful part during the war. But the war terminated. Toward the end\r\nof the session of 1814-15, we received the news of peace. This closed\r\nthe Thirteenth Congress. In the fall of 1815, the Fourteenth Congress\r\nassembled. It was full of ability, and the honorable gentleman stood\r\nhigh among its distinguished members. He remained in the House, Sir,\r\nthrough the whole of that Congress; and now, Sir, it is easy to show\r\nthat, during those two years, the honorable gentleman took a decided\r\nlead in all those great measures which he has since so often denounced\r\nas unconstitutional and oppressive, the bank, the tariff, and internal\r\nimprovements. The war being terminated, the gentleman's mind turned\r\nitself toward internal administration and improvement. He surveyed the\r\nwhole country, contemplated its resources, saw what it was capable of\r\nbecoming, and held a political faith not so narrow and contracted as to\r\nrestrain him from useful and efficient action. He was, therefore, at\r\nonce a full length ahead of all others in measures which were national,\r\nand which required a broad and liberal construction of the Constitution.\r\nThis is historic truth. Of his agency in the bank, and other measures\r\nconnected with the currency, I have already spoken, and I do not\r\nunderstand him to deny any thing I have said, in that particular.\r\nIndeed, I have said nothing capable of denial.\r\n\r\nNow allow me a few words upon the tariff. The tariff of 1816 was\r\ndistinctly a South Carolina measure. Look at the votes, and you will see\r\nit. It was a tariff for the benefit of South Carolina interests, and\r\ncarried through Congress by South Carolina votes and South Carolina\r\ninfluence. Even the _minimum_, Sir, the so-much-reproached, the\r\nabominable _minimum_, that subject of angry indignation and wrathful\r\nrhetoric, is of Southern origin, and has a South Carolina parentage.\r\n\r\nSir, the contest on that occasion was chiefly between the cotton-growers\r\nat home, and the importers of cotton fabrics from India. These India\r\nfabrics were made from the cotton of that country. The people of this\r\ncountry were using cotton fabrics not made of American cotton, and, so\r\nfar, they were diminishing the demand for such cotton. The importation\r\nof India cottons was then very large, and this bill was designed to put\r\nan end to it, and, with the help of the _minimum_, it did put an end to\r\nit. The cotton manufactures of the North were then in their infancy.\r\nThey had some friends in Congress, but, if I recollect, the majority of\r\nMassachusetts members and of New England members were against this\r\ncotton tariff of 1816. I remember well, that the main debate was between\r\nthe importers of India cottons, in the North, and the cotton-growers of\r\nthe South. The gentleman cannot deny the truth of this, or any part of\r\nit. Boston opposed this tariff, and Salem opposed it, warmly and\r\nvigorously. But the honorable member supported it, and the law passed.\r\nAnd now be it always remembered, Sir, that that act passed on the\r\nprofessed ground of protection; that it had in it the _minimum_\r\nprinciple, and that the honorable member, and other leading gentlemen\r\nfrom his own State, supported it, voted for it, and carried it through\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, we come to the doctrine of internal improvement, that\r\nother usurpation, that other oppression, which has come so near to\r\njustifying violent disruption of the government, and scattering the\r\nfragments of the Union to the four winds. Have the gentleman's\r\nState-rights opinions always kept him aloof from such unhallowed\r\ninfringements of the Constitution? He says he always differed with me\r\non constitutional questions. How was it in this most important\r\nparticular? Has he here stood on the ramparts, brandishing his\r\nglittering sword against assailants, and holding out a banner of\r\ndefiance? Sir, it is an indisputable truth, that he is himself the man,\r\nthe _ipse_ that first brought forward in Congress a scheme of general\r\ninternal improvement, at the expense and under the authority of this\r\ngovernment. He, Sir, is the very man, the _ipsissimus ipse_, who\r\nconsiderately, and on a settled system, began these unconstitutional\r\nmeasures, if they be unconstitutional. And now for the proof.\r\n\r\nThe act incorporating the Bank of the United States was passed in April,\r\n1816. For the privileges of the charter, the proprietors of the bank\r\nwere to pay to government a _bonus_, as it was called, of one million\r\nfive hundred thousand dollars, in certain instalments. Government also\r\ntook seven millions in the stock of the bank. Early in the next session\r\nof Congress, that is, in December, 1816, the honorable member moved, in\r\nthe House of Representatives, that a committee be appointed to consider\r\nthe propriety of setting apart this _bonus_, and also the dividends on\r\nthe stock belonging to the United States, as a permanent fund for\r\ninternal improvement. The committee was appointed, and the honorable\r\nmember was made its chairman. He thus originated the plan, and took the\r\nlead in its execution. Shortly afterwards, he reported a bill carrying\r\nout the objects for which the committee had been appointed. This bill\r\nprovided that the dividends on the seven millions of bank stock\r\nbelonging to government, and also the whole of the _bonus_, should be\r\npermanently pledged as a fund for constructing roads and canals; and\r\nthat this fund should be subject to such specific appropriations as\r\nCongress might subsequently make.\r\n\r\nThis was the bill; and this was the first project ever brought forward\r\nin Congress for a system of internal improvements. The bill goes the\r\nwhole doctrine at a single jump. The Cumberland Road, it is true, was\r\nalready in progress; and for that the gentleman had also voted. But\r\nthere were, and are now, peculiarities about that particular expenditure\r\nwhich sometimes satisfy scrupulous consciences; but this bill of the\r\ngentleman's, without equivocation or saving clause, without if, or and,\r\nor but, occupied the whole ground at once, and announced internal\r\nimprovement as one of the objects of this government, on a grand and\r\nsystematic plan. The bill, Sir, seemed indeed too strong. It was thought\r\nby persons not esteemed extremely jealous of State rights to evince too\r\nlittle regard to the will of the States. Several gentlemen opposed the\r\nmeasure in that shape, on that account; and among them Colonel\r\nPickering, then one of the Representatives from Massachusetts. Even\r\nTimothy Pickering could not quite sanction, or concur in, the honorable\r\ngentleman's doctrines to their full extent, although he favored the\r\nmeasure in its general character. He therefore prepared an amendment, as\r\na substitute; and his substitute provided for two very important things\r\nnot embraced in the original bill:--\r\n\r\nFirst, that the proportion of the fund to be expended in each State,\r\nrespectively, should be in proportion to the number of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nSecond, that the money should be applied in constructing such roads,\r\ncanals, and so forth, in the several States, as Congress might direct,\r\n_with the assent of the State_.\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, was Timothy Pickering's amendment to the gentleman's bill.\r\nAnd now, Sir, how did the honorable gentleman, who has always belonged\r\nto the State-rights party,--how did he treat this amendment, or this\r\nsubstitute? Which way do you think his State-rights doctrine led him?\r\nWhy, Sir, I will tell you. He immediately rose, and moved to strike out\r\nthe words \"_with the assent of the State_\"! Here is the journal under my\r\nhand, Sir; and here is the gentleman's motion. And certainly, Sir, it\r\nwill be admitted that this motion was not of a nature to intimate that\r\nhe was wedded to State rights. But the words were not struck out. The\r\nmotion did not prevail. Mr. Pickering's substitute was adopted, and the\r\nbill passed the House in that form.\r\n\r\nIn committee of the whole on this bill, Sir, the honorable member made a\r\nvery able speech both on the policy of internal improvements and the\r\npower of Congress over the subject. These points were fully argued by\r\nhim. He spoke of the importance of the system, the vast good it would\r\nproduce, and its favorable effect on the union of the States. \"Let us,\r\nthen,\" said he, \"bind the republic together with a perfect system of\r\nroads and canals. Let us conquer space. It is thus the most distant\r\nparts of the republic will be brought within a few days' travel of the\r\ncentre; it is thus that a citizen of the West will read the news of\r\nBoston still moist from the press.\"\r\n\r\nBut on the power of Congress to make internal improvements, ay, Sir, on\r\nthe power of Congress, hear him! What were then his rules of\r\nconstruction and interpretation? How did he at that time read and\r\nunderstand the Constitution? Why, Sir, he said that \"he was no advocate\r\nfor refined arguments on the Constitution. The instrument was not\r\nintended as a thesis for the logician to exercise his ingenuity on. It\r\nought to be construed with plain good-sense.\" This is all very just, I\r\nthink, Sir; and he said much more in the same strain. He quoted many\r\ninstances of laws passed, as he contended, on similar principles, and\r\nthen added, that \"he introduced these instances to prove the uniform\r\nsense of Congress and of the country (for they had not been objected to)\r\nas to our powers; and surely,\" said he, \"they furnish better evidence of\r\nthe true interpretation of the Constitution than the most refined and\r\nsubtile arguments.\"\r\n\r\nHere you see, Mr. President, how little original I am. You have heard me\r\nagain and again contending in my place here for the stability of that\r\nwhich has been long settled; you have heard me, till I dare say you have\r\nbeen tired, insisting that the sense of Congress, so often expressed,\r\nand the sense of the country, so fully shown and so firmly established,\r\nought to be regarded as having decided finally certain constitutional\r\nquestions. You see now, Sir, what authority I have for this mode of\r\nargument. But while the scholar is learning, the teacher renounces. Will\r\nhe apply his old doctrine now--I sincerely wish he would--to the\r\nquestion of the bank, to the question of the receiving of bank-notes by\r\ngovernment, to the power of Congress over the paper currency? Will he\r\nadmit that these questions ought to be regarded as decided by the\r\nsettled sense of Congress and of the country? O, no! Far otherwise. From\r\nthese rules of judgment, and from the influence of all considerations of\r\nthis practical nature, the honorable member now takes these questions\r\nwith him into the upper heights of metaphysics, into the regions of\r\nthose refinements and subtile arguments which he rejected with so much\r\ndecision in 1817, as appears by this speech. He quits his old ground of\r\ncommon-sense, experience, and the general understanding of the country,\r\nfor a flight among theories and ethereal abstractions.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, let me ask, when did the honorable member relinquish these\r\nearly opinions and principles of his? When did he make known his\r\nadhesion to the doctrines of the State-rights party? We have been\r\nspeaking of transactions in 1816 and 1817. What the gentleman's opinions\r\nthen were, we have seen. When did he announce himself a State-rights\r\nman? I have already said, Sir, that nobody knew of his claiming that\r\ncharacter until after the commencement of 1825; and I have said so,\r\nbecause I have before me an address of his to his neighbors at\r\nAbbeville, in May of that year, in which he recounts, very properly, the\r\nprincipal incidents in his career as a member of Congress, and as head\r\nof a department; and in which he says that, as a member of Congress, he\r\nhad given his zealous efforts in favor of a restoration of specie\r\ncurrency, of a due protection of those manufactures which had taken root\r\nduring the war, and, finally, of a system for connecting the various\r\nparts of the country by a judicious system of internal improvement. He\r\nadds, that it afterwards became his duty, as a member of the\r\nadministration, to aid in sustaining against the boldest assaults those\r\nvery measures which, as a member of Congress, he had contributed to\r\nestablish.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Sir, since the honorable gentleman says he has differed with me\r\non constitutional questions, will he be pleased to say what\r\nconstitutional opinion I have ever avowed for which I have not his\r\nexpress authority? Is it on the bank power? the tariff power? the power\r\nof internal improvement? I have shown his votes, his speeches, and his\r\nconduct, on all these subjects, up to the time when General Jackson\r\nbecame a candidate for the Presidency. From that time, Sir, I know we\r\nhave differed; but if there was any difference before that time, I call\r\nupon him to point it out, to declare what was the occasion, what the\r\nquestion, and what the difference. And if before that period, Sir, by\r\nany speech, any vote, any public proceeding, or by any mode of\r\nannouncement whatever, he gave the world to know that he belonged to the\r\nState-rights party, I hope he will now be kind enough to produce it, or\r\nto refer to it, or to tell us where we may look for it.\r\n\r\nSir, I will pursue this topic no farther. I would not have pursued it so\r\nfar, I would not have entered upon it at all, had it not been for the\r\nastonishment I felt, mingled, I confess, with something of warmer\r\nfeeling, when the honorable gentleman declared that he had always\r\ndiffered with me on constitutional questions. Sir, the honorable member\r\nread a quotation or two from a speech of mine in 1816, on the currency\r\nor bank question. With what intent, or to what end? What inconsistency\r\ndoes he show? Speaking of the _legal_ currency of the country, that is,\r\nthe coin, I then said it was in a good state. Was not that true? I was\r\nspeaking of the legal currency; of that which the law made a tender. And\r\nhow is that inconsistent with any thing said by me now, or ever said by\r\nme? I declared then, he says, that the framers of this government were\r\nhard-money men. Certainly they were. But are not the friends of a\r\nconvertible paper _hard-money men_, in every practical and sensible\r\nmeaning of the term? Did I, in that speech, or any other, insist on\r\nexcluding all convertible paper from the uses of society? Most assuredly\r\nI did not. I never quite so far lost my wits, I think. There is but a\r\nsingle sentence in that speech which I should qualify if I were to\r\ndeliver it again, and that the honorable member has not noticed. It is a\r\nparagraph respecting the power of Congress over the circulation of State\r\nbanks, which might perhaps need explanation or correction. Understanding\r\nit as applicable to the case then before Congress, all the rest is\r\nperfectly accordant with my present opinions. It is well known that I\r\nnever doubted the power of Congress to create a bank; that I was always\r\nin favor of a bank, constituted on proper principles; that I voted for\r\nthe bank bill of 1815; and that I opposed that of 1816 only on account\r\nof one or two of its provisions, which I and others hoped to be able to\r\nstrike out. I am a hard-money man, and always have been, and always\r\nshall be. But I know the great use of such bank paper as is convertible\r\ninto hard money on demand; which may be called specie paper, and which\r\nis equivalent to specie in value, and much more convenient and useful\r\nfor common purposes. On the other hand, I abhor all irredeemable paper;\r\nall old-fashioned paper money; all deceptive promises; every thing,\r\nindeed, in the shape of paper issued for circulation, whether by\r\ngovernment or individuals, which cannot be turned into gold and silver\r\nat the will of the holder.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, I have insisted that government is bound to protect and\r\nregulate the means of commerce, to see that there is a sound currency\r\nfor the use of the people. The honorable gentleman asks, What then is\r\nthe limit? Must Congress also furnish all means of commerce? Must it\r\nfurnish weights and scales and steelyards? Most undoubtedly, Sir, it\r\nmust regulate weights and measures, and it does so. But the answer to\r\nthe general question is very obvious. Government must furnish all that\r\nwhich none but government can furnish. Government must do that for\r\nindividuals which individuals cannot do for themselves. That is the very\r\nend of government. Why else have we a government? Can individuals make a\r\ncurrency? Can individuals regulate money? The distinction is as broad\r\nand plain as the Pennsylvania Avenue. No man can mistake it, or well\r\nblunder out of it. The gentleman asks if government must furnish for the\r\npeople ships, and boats, and wagons. Certainly not. The gentleman here\r\nonly recites the President's message of September. These things, and all\r\nsuch things, the people can furnish for themselves; but they cannot make\r\na currency; they cannot, individually, decide what shall be the money of\r\nthe country. That, everybody knows, is one of the prerogatives, and one\r\nof the duties, of government; and a duty which I think we are most\r\nunwisely and improperly neglecting. We may as well leave the people to\r\nmake war and to make peace, each man for himself, as to leave to\r\nindividuals the regulation of commerce and currency.\r\n\r\nMr. President, there are other remarks of the gentleman of which I might\r\ntake notice. But should I do so, I could only repeat what I have already\r\nsaid, either now or heretofore. I shall, therefore, not now allude to\r\nthem. My principal purpose in what I have said has been to defend\r\nmyself; that was my first object; and next, as the honorable member has\r\nattempted to take to himself the character of a strict constructionist,\r\nand a State-rights man, and on that basis to show a difference, not\r\nfavorable to me, between his constitutional opinions and my own,\r\nheretofore, it has been my intention to show that the power to create a\r\nbank, the power to regulate the currency by other and direct means, the\r\npower to enact a protective tariff, and the power of internal\r\nimprovement, in its broadest sense, are all powers which the honorable\r\ngentleman himself has supported, has acted on, and in the exercise of\r\nwhich, indeed, he has taken a distinguished lead in the counsels of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIf this has been done, my purpose is answered. I do not wish to prolong\r\nthe discussion, nor to spin it out into a colloquy. If the honorable\r\nmember has any thing new to bring forward; if he has any charge to make,\r\nany proof, or any specification; if he has any thing to advance against\r\nmy opinions or my conduct, my honor or patriotism, I am still at home. I\r\nam here. If not, then, so far as I am concerned, this discussion will\r\nhere terminate.\r\n\r\nI will say a few words, before I resume my seat, on the motion now\r\npending. That motion is to strike out the specie-paying part of the\r\nbill. I have a suspicion, Sir, that the motion will prevail. If it\r\nshould, it will leave a great vacuum; and how shall that vacuum be\r\nfilled?\r\n\r\nThe part proposed to be struck out is that which requires all debts to\r\ngovernment to be paid in specie. It makes a good provision for\r\ngovernment, and for public men, through all classes. The Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, in his letter at the last session, was still more watchful\r\nof the interests of the holders of office. He assured us, that, bad as\r\nthe times were, and notwithstanding the floods of bad paper which\r\ndeluged the country, members of Congress should get gold and silver. In\r\nmy opinion, Sir, this is beginning the use of good money in payments at\r\nthe wrong end of the list. If there be bad money in the country, I think\r\nthat Secretaries and other executive officers, and especially members of\r\nCongress, should be the last to receive any good money; because they\r\nhave the power, if they will do their duty, and exercise it, of making\r\nthe money of the country good for all. I think, Sir, it was a leading\r\nfeature in Mr. Burke's famous bill for economical reform, that he\r\nprovided, first of all, for those who are least able to secure\r\nthemselves. Everybody else was to be well paid all they were entitled\r\nto, before the ministers of the crown, and other political characters,\r\nshould have any thing. This seems to me very right. But we have a\r\nprecedent, Sir, in our own country, more directly to the purpose; and\r\nas that which we now hope to strike out is the part of the bill\r\nfurnished or proposed originally by the honorable member from South\r\nCarolina, it will naturally devolve on him to supply its place. I wish,\r\ntherefore, to draw his particular attention to this precedent, which I\r\nam now about to produce.\r\n\r\nMost members of the Senate will remember, that before the establishment\r\nof this government, and before or about the time that the territory\r\nwhich now constitutes the State of Tennessee was ceded to Congress, the\r\ninhabitants of the eastern part of that territory established a\r\ngovernment for themselves, and called it the State of Franklin. They\r\nadopted a very good constitution, providing for the usual branches of\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial power. They laid and collected\r\ntaxes, and performed other usual acts of legislation. They had, for the\r\npresent, it is true, no maritime possessions, yet they followed the\r\ncommon forms in constituting high officers; and their governor was not\r\nonly captain-general and commander-in-chief, but admiral also, so that\r\nthe navy might have a commander when there should be a navy.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, the currency in this State of Franklin became very much\r\nderanged. Specie was scarce, and equally scarce were the notes of\r\nspecie-paying banks. But the legislature did not propose any divorce of\r\ngovernment and people; they did not seek to establish two currencies,\r\none for men in office, and one for the rest of the community. They were\r\ncontent with neighbor's fare. It became necessary to pass what we should\r\ncall now-a-days the civil-list appropriation bill. They passed such a\r\nbill; and when we shall have made a void in the bill now before us by\r\nstriking out specie payments for government, I recommend to its friends\r\nto fill the gap, by inserting, if not the same provisions as were in the\r\nlaw of the State of Franklin, at least something in the same spirit.\r\n\r\nThe preamble of that law, Sir, begins by reciting, that the collection\r\nof taxes in specie had become very oppressive to the good people of the\r\ncommonwealth, for the want of a circulating medium. A parallel case to\r\nours, Sir, exactly. It recites further, that it is the duty of the\r\nlegislature to hear, at all times, the prayer of their constituents, and\r\napply as speedy a remedy as lies in their power. These sentiments are\r\nvery just, and I sincerely wish there was a thorough disposition here to\r\nadopt the like.\r\n\r\nActing under the influence of these sound opinions, Sir, the legislature\r\nof Franklin passed a law for the support of the civil list, which, as it\r\nis short, I will beg permission to read. It is as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Franklin,\r\n     and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same_, That, from\r\n     the first day of January, A.D. 1789, the salaries of the civil\r\n     officers of this commonwealth be as follows, to wit:\r\n\r\n     \"His excellency, the governor, _per annum_, one thousand\r\n     deer-skins; his honor, the chief justice, five hundred do. do.; the\r\n     attorney-general, five hundred do. do.; secretary to his excellency\r\n     the governor, five hundred raccoon do.; the treasurer of the State,\r\n     four hundred and fifty otter do.; each county clerk, three hundred\r\n     beaver do.; clerk of the house of commons, two hundred raccoon do.;\r\n     members of assembly, _per diem_, three do. do.; justice's fee for\r\n     signing a warrant, one muskrat do.; to the constable, for serving a\r\n     warrant, one mink do.\r\n\r\n     \"Enacted into a law this 18th day of October, 1788, under the great\r\n     seal of the State.\r\n\r\n     \"Witness his excellency, &c.\r\n\r\n     \"_Governor, captain-general, commander-in-chief, and admiral in and\r\n     over said State_.\"\r\n\r\nThis, Sir, is the law, the spirit of which I commend to gentlemen. I\r\nwill not speak of the appropriateness of these several allowances for\r\nthe civil list. But the example is good, and I am of opinion that, until\r\nCongress shall perform its duty, by seeing that the country enjoys a\r\ngood currency, the same medium which the people are obliged to use,\r\nwhether it be skins or rags, is good enough for its own members.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Secretary of the Treasury.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA UNIFORM SYSTEM OF BANKRUPTCY.\r\n\r\nFROM A SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, ON THE 18TH\r\nOF MAY, 1840, ON THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE BILL ESTABLISHING A\r\nUNIFORM SYSTEM OF BANKRUPTCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me remind you, then, in the first place, Sir, that, commercial as\r\nthe country is, and having experienced as it has done, and experiencing\r\nas it now does, great vicissitudes of trade and business, it is almost\r\nforty years since any law has been in force by which any honest man,\r\nfailing in business, could be effectually discharged from debt by\r\nsurrendering his property. The former bankrupt law was repealed on the\r\n19th of December, 1803. From that day to this, the condition of an\r\ninsolvent, however honest and worthy, has been utterly hopeless, so far\r\nas he depended on any legal mode of relief. This state of things has\r\narisen from the peculiar provisions of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and from the omission by Congress to exercise this branch of its\r\nconstitutional power. By the Constitution, the States are prohibited\r\nfrom passing laws impairing the obligation of contracts. Bankrupt laws\r\nimpair the obligation of contracts, if they discharge the bankrupt from\r\nhis debts without payment. The States, therefore, cannot pass such laws.\r\nThe power, then, is taken from the States, and placed in our hands. It\r\nis true that it has been decided, that, in regard to contracts entered\r\ninto after the passage of any State bankrupt law, between the citizens\r\nof the State having such law, and sued in the State courts, a State\r\ndischarge may prevail. So far, effect has been given to State laws. I\r\nhave great respect, habitually, for judicial decisions; but it has\r\nnevertheless, I must say, always appeared to me that the distinctions on\r\nwhich these decisions are founded are slender, and that they evade,\r\nwithout answering, the objections founded on the great political and\r\ncommercial objects intended to be secured by this part of the\r\nConstitution. But these decisions, whether right or wrong, afford no\r\neffectual relief. The qualifications and limitations which I have stated\r\nrender them useless, as to the purpose of a general discharge. So much\r\nof the concerns of every man of business is with citizens of other\r\nStates than his own, and with foreigners, that the partial extent to\r\nwhich the validity of State discharges reaches is of little benefit.\r\n\r\nThe States, then, cannot pass effectual bankrupt laws; that is,\r\neffectual for the discharge of the debtor. There is no doubt that most,\r\nif not all, the States would now pass such laws, if they had the power;\r\nalthough their legislation would be various, interfering, and full of\r\nall the evils which the Constitution of the United States intended to\r\nprovide against. But they have not the power; Congress, which has the\r\npower, does not exercise it. This is the peculiarity of our condition.\r\nThe States would pass bankrupt laws, but they cannot; we can, but we\r\nwill not. And between this want of power in the States and want of will\r\nin Congress, unfortunate insolvents are left to hopeless bondage. There\r\nare probably one or two hundred thousand debtors, honest, sober, and\r\nindustrious, who drag out lives useless to themselves, useless to their\r\nfamilies, and useless to their country, for no reason but that they\r\ncannot be legally discharged from debts in which misfortunes have\r\ninvolved them, and which there is no possibility of their ever paying. I\r\nrepeat, again, that these cases have now been accumulating for a whole\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nIt is true they are not imprisoned; but there may be, and there are,\r\nrestraint and bondage outside the walls of the jail, as well as in.\r\nTheir power of earning is, in truth, taken away, their faculty of useful\r\nemployment is paralyzed, and hope itself become extinguished. Creditors,\r\ngenerally, are not inhuman or unkind; but there will be found some who\r\nhold on, and the more a debtor struggles to free himself, the more they\r\nfeel encouraged to hold on. The mode of reasoning is, that, the more\r\nhonest the debtor may be, the more industrious, the more disposed to\r\nstruggle and bear up against his misfortunes, the greater the chance is,\r\nthat, in the end, especially if the humanity of others shall have led\r\nthem to release him, their own debts may be finally recovered.\r\n\r\nNow, in this state of our constitutional powers and duties, in this\r\nstate of our laws, and with this actually existing condition of so many\r\ninsolvents before us, it is not too serious to ask every member of the\r\nSenate to put it to his own conscience to say, whether we are not bound\r\nto exercise our constitutional duty. Can we abstain from exercising it?\r\nThe States give to their own laws all the effect they can. This shows\r\nthat they desire the power to be exercised. Several States have, in the\r\nmost solemn manner, made known their earnest wishes to Congress. If we\r\nstill refuse, what is to be done? Many of these insolvent persons are\r\nyoung men with young families. Like other men, they have capacities both\r\nfor action and enjoyment. Are we to stifle all these for ever? Are we to\r\nsuffer all these persons, many of them meritorious and respectable, to\r\nbe pressed to the earth for ever, by a load of hopeless debt? The\r\nexisting diversities and contradictions of State laws on the subject\r\nadmirably illustrate the objects of this part of the Constitution, as\r\nstated by Mr. Madison; and they form that precise case for which the\r\nclause was inserted. The very evil intended to be provided against is\r\nbefore us, and around us, and pressing us on all sides. How can we, how\r\ndare we, make a perfect dead letter of this part of the Constitution,\r\nwhich we have sworn to support? The insolvent persons have not the power\r\nof locomotion. They cannot travel from State to State. They are\r\nprisoners. To my certain knowledge, there are many who cannot even come\r\nhere to the seat of government, to present their petitions to Congress,\r\nso great is their fear that some creditor will dog their heels, and\r\narrest them in some intervening State, or in this District, in the hope\r\nthat friends will appear to save them, by payment of the debt, from\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\nThese are truths; not creditable to the country, but they are truths. I\r\nam sorry for their existence. Sir, there is one crime, quite too common,\r\nwhich the laws of man do not punish, but which cannot escape the justice\r\nof God; and that is, the arrest and confinement of a debtor by his\r\ncreditor, with no motive on earth but the hope that some friend, or some\r\nrelative, perhaps almost as poor as himself, his mother it may be, or\r\nhis sisters, or his daughters, will give up all their own little\r\npittance, and make beggars of themselves, to save him from the horrors\r\nof a loathsome jail. Human retribution cannot reach this guilt; human\r\nfeeling may not penetrate the flinty heart that perpetrates it; but an\r\nhour is surely coming, with more than human retribution on its wings,\r\nwhen that flint shall be melted, either by the power of penitence and\r\ngrace, or in the fires of remorse.\r\n\r\nSir, I verily believe that the power of perpetuating debts against\r\ndebtors, for no substantial good to the creditor himself, and the power\r\nof imprisonment for debt, at least as it existed in this country ten\r\nyears ago, have imposed more restraint on personal liberty than the law\r\nof debtor and creditor imposes in any other Christian and commercial\r\ncountry. If any public good were attained, any high political object\r\nanswered, by such laws, there might be some reason for counselling\r\nsubmission and sufferance to individuals. But the result is bad, every\r\nway. It is bad to the public and to the country, which loses the efforts\r\nand the industry of so many useful and capable citizens. It is bad to\r\ncreditors, because there is no security against preferences, no\r\nprinciple of equality, and no encouragement for honest, fair, and\r\nseasonable assignments of effects. As to the debtor, however good his\r\nintentions or earnest his endeavors, it subdues his spirit and degrades\r\nhim in his own esteem; and if he attempts any thing for the purpose of\r\nobtaining food and clothing for his family, he is driven to unworthy\r\nshifts and disguises, to the use of other persons' names, to the\r\nadoption of the character of agent, and various other contrivances, to\r\nkeep the little earnings of the day from the reach of his creditors.\r\nFathers act in the name of their sons, sons act in the name of their\r\nfathers; all constantly exposed to the greatest temptation to\r\nmisrepresent facts and to evade the law, if creditors should strike. All\r\nthis is evil, unmixed evil. And what is it all for? Of what benefit to\r\nanybody? Who likes it? Who wishes it? What class of creditors desire it?\r\nWhat consideration of public good demands it?\r\n\r\nSir, we talk much, and talk warmly, of political liberty; and well we\r\nmay, for it is among the chief of public blessings. But who can enjoy\r\npolitical liberty if he is deprived, permanently, of personal liberty,\r\nand the exercise of his own industry and his own faculties? To those\r\nunfortunate individuals, doomed to the everlasting bondage of debt, what\r\nis it that we have free institutions of government? What is it that we\r\nhave public and popular assemblies? What is even this Constitution\r\nitself to them, in its actual operation, and as we now administer it?\r\nWhat is its aspect to them, but an aspect of stern, implacable severity?\r\nan aspect of refusal, denial, and frowning rebuke? nay, more than that,\r\nan aspect not only of austerity and rebuke, but, as they must think it,\r\nof plain injustice also, since it will not relieve them, nor suffer\r\nothers to give them relief? What love can they feel towards the\r\nConstitution of their country, which has taken the power of striking off\r\ntheir bonds from their own paternal State governments, and yet,\r\ninexorable to all the cries of justice and of mercy, holds it\r\nunexercised in its own fast and unrelenting grasp? They find themselves\r\nbondsmen, because we will not execute the commands of the Constitution;\r\nbondsmen to debts they cannot pay, and which all know they cannot pay,\r\nand which take away the power of supporting themselves. Other slaves\r\nhave masters, charged with the duty of support and protection; but their\r\nmasters neither clothe, nor feed, nor shelter; they only bind.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, the fault is not in the Constitution. The Constitution is\r\nbeneficent as well as wise in all its provisions on this subject. The\r\nfault, I must be allowed to say, is in us, who have suffered ourselves\r\nquite too long to neglect the duty incumbent upon us. The time will\r\ncome, Sir, when we shall look back and wonder at the long delay of this\r\njust and salutary measure. We shall then feel as we now feel when we\r\nreflect on that progress of opinion which has already done so much on\r\nanother connected subject; I mean the abolition of imprisonment for\r\ndebt. What should we say at this day, if it were proposed to\r\nre-establish arrest and imprisonment for debt, as it existed in most of\r\nthe States even so late as twenty years ago? I mean for debt alone, for\r\nmere, pure debt, without charge or suspicion of fraud or falsehood.\r\n\r\nSir, it is about that length of time, I think, since you,[1] who now\r\npreside over our deliberations, began here your efforts for the\r\nabolition of imprisonment for debt; and a better work was never begun in\r\nthe Capitol. Ever remembered and ever honored be that noble effort! You\r\ndrew the attention of the public to the question, whether, in a\r\ncivilized and Christian country, debt incurred without fraud, and\r\nremaining unpaid without fault, is a crime, and a crime fit to be\r\npunished by denying to the offender the enjoyment of the light of\r\nheaven, and shutting him up within four walls. Your own good sense, and\r\nthat instinct of right feeling which often outruns sagacity, carried you\r\nat once to a result to which others were more slowly brought, but to\r\nwhich nearly all have at length been brought, by reason, reflection, and\r\nargument. Your movement led the way; it became an example, and has had a\r\npowerful effect on both sides of the Atlantic. Imprisonment for debt, or\r\neven arrest and holding to bail for mere debt, no longer exists in\r\nEngland; and former laws on the subject have been greatly modified and\r\nmitigated, as we all know, in our States. \"Abolition of imprisonment for\r\ndebt,\" your own words in the title of your own bill, has become the\r\ntitle of an act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nSir, I am glad of an occasion to pay you the tribute of my sincere\r\nrespect for these your labors in the cause of humanity and enlightened\r\npolicy. For these labors thousands of grateful hearts have thanked you;\r\nand other thousands of hearts, not yet full of joy for the\r\naccomplishment of their hopes, full, rather, at the present moment, of\r\ndeep and distressing anxiety, have yet the pleasure to know that your\r\nadvice, your counsel, and your influence will all be given in favor of\r\nwhat is intended for their relief in the bill before us.\r\n\r\nMr. President, let us atone for the omissions of the past by a prompt\r\nand efficient discharge of present duty. The demand for this measure is\r\nnot partial or local. It comes to us, earnest and loud, from all classes\r\nand all quarters. The time is come when we must answer it to our own\r\nconsciences, if we suffer longer delay or postponement. High hopes, high\r\nduties, and high responsibilities concentrate themselves on this measure\r\nand this moment. With a power to pass a bankrupt law, which no other\r\nlegislature in the country possesses, with a power of giving relief to\r\nmany, doing injustice to none, I again ask every man who hears me, if he\r\ncan content himself without an honest attempt to exercise that power. We\r\nmay think it would be better to leave the power with the States; but it\r\nwas not left with the States; they have it not, and we cannot give it to\r\nthem. It is in our hands, to be exercised by us, or to be for ever\r\nuseless and lifeless. Under these circumstances, does not every man's\r\nheart tell him that he has a duty to discharge? If the final vote shall\r\nbe given this day, and if that vote shall leave thousands of our\r\nfellow-citizens and their families, in hopeless and helpless distress,\r\nto everlasting subjection to irredeemable debt, can we go to our beds\r\nwith satisfied consciences? Can we lay our heads upon our pillows, and,\r\nwithout self-reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our\r\ndebts as we forgive our debtors? Sir, let us meet the unanimous wishes\r\nof the country, and proclaim relief to the unfortunate throughout the\r\nland. What should hinder? What should stay our hands from this good\r\nwork? Creditors do not oppose it,--they apply for it; debtors solicit\r\nit, with an importunity, earnestness, and anxiety not to be described;\r\nthe Constitution enjoins it; and all the considerations of justice,\r\npolicy, and propriety, which are wrapped up in the phrase Public Duty,\r\ndemand it, as I think, and demand it loudly and imperatively, at our\r\nhands. Sir, let us gratify the whole country, for once, with the joyous\r\nclang of chains, joyous because heard falling from the limbs of men. The\r\nwisest among those whom I address can desire nothing more beneficial\r\nthan this measure, or more universally desired; and he who is youngest\r\nmay not expect to live long enough to see a better opportunity of\r\ncausing new pleasures and a happiness long untasted to spring up in the\r\nhearts of the poor and the humble. How many husbands and fathers are\r\nlooking with hopes which they cannot suppress, and yet hardly dare to\r\ncherish, for the result of this debate! How many wives and mothers will\r\npass sleepless and feverish nights, until they know whether they and\r\ntheir families shall be raised from poverty, despondency, and despair,\r\nand restored again to the circles of industrious, independent, and happy\r\nlife!\r\n\r\nSir, let it be to the honor of Congress that, in these days of political\r\nstrife and controversy, we have laid aside for once the sin that most\r\neasily besets us, and, with unanimity of counsel, and with singleness of\r\nheart and of purpose, have accomplished for our country one measure of\r\nunquestionable good.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Hon. Richard M. Johnson, Vice-President of the United\r\nStates.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"THE LOG CABIN CANDIDATE.\"\r\n\r\nFROM A SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE GREAT MASS MEETING AT SARATOGA, NEW YORK,\r\nON THE 12TH OF AUGUST, 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it is the cry and effort of the times to stimulate those who are\r\ncalled poor against those who are called rich; and yet, among those who\r\nurge this cry, and seek to profit by it, there is betrayed sometimes an\r\noccasional sneer at whatever savors of humble life. Witness the reproach\r\nagainst a candidate now before the people for their highest honors, that\r\na log cabin, with plenty of hard cider, is good enough for him!\r\n\r\nIt appears to some persons, that a great deal too much use is made of\r\nthe symbol of the log cabin. No man of sense supposes, certainly, that\r\nthe having lived in a log cabin is any further proof of qualification\r\nfor the Presidency, than as it creates a presumption that any one who,\r\nrising from humble condition, or under unfavorable circumstances, has\r\nbeen able to attract a considerable degree of public attention, is\r\npossessed of reputable qualities, moral and intellectual.\r\n\r\nBut it is to be remembered, that this matter of the log cabin\r\noriginated, not with the friends of the Whig candidate, but with his\r\nenemies. Soon after his nomination at Harrisburg, a writer for one of\r\nthe leading administration papers spoke of his \"log cabin,\" and his use\r\nof \"hard cider,\" by way of sneer and reproach. As might have been\r\nexpected, (for pretenders are apt to be thrown off their guard,) this\r\ntaunt at humble life proceeded from the party which claims a monopoly of\r\nthe purest democracy. The whole party appeared to enjoy it, or, at\r\nleast, they countenanced it by silent acquiescence; for I do not know\r\nthat, to this day, any eminent individual or any leading newspaper\r\nattached to the administration has rebuked this scornful jeering at the\r\nsupposed humble condition or circumstances in life, past or present, of\r\na worthy man and a war-worn soldier. But it touched a tender point in\r\nthe public feeling. It naturally roused indignation. What was intended\r\nas reproach was immediately seized on as merit. \"Be it so! Be it so!\"\r\nwas the instant burst of the public voice. \"Let him be the log cabin\r\ncandidate. What you say in scorn, we will shout with all our lungs. From\r\nthis day forward, we have our cry of rally; and we shall see whether he\r\nwho has dwelt in one of the rude abodes of the West may not become the\r\nbest house in the country!\"\r\n\r\nAll this is natural, and springs from sources of just feeling. Other\r\nthings, Gentlemen, have had a similar origin. We all know that the term\r\n\"Whig\" was bestowed in derision, two hundred years ago, on those who\r\nwere thought too fond of liberty; and our national air of \"Yankee\r\nDoodle\" was composed by British officers, in ridicule of the American\r\ntroops. Yet, erelong, the last of the British armies laid down its arms\r\nat Yorktown, while this same air was playing in the ears of officers\r\nand men. Gentlemen, it is only shallow-minded pretenders who either make\r\ndistinguished origin matter of personal merit, or obscure origin matter\r\nof personal reproach. Taunt and scoffing at the humble condition of\r\nearly life affect nobody, in this country, but those who are foolish\r\nenough to indulge in them, and they are generally sufficiently punished\r\nby public rebuke. A man who is not ashamed of himself need not be\r\nashamed of his early condition.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it did not happen to me to be born in a log cabin; but my\r\nelder brothers and sisters were born in a log cabin, raised amid the\r\nsnow-drifts of New Hampshire, at a period so early that, when the smoke\r\nfirst rose from its rude chimney, and curled over the frozen hills,\r\nthere was no similar evidence of a white man's habitation between it and\r\nthe settlements on the rivers of Canada. Its remains still exist. I make\r\nto it an annual visit. I carry my children to it, to teach them the\r\nhardships endured by the generations which have gone before them. I love\r\nto dwell on the tender recollections, the kindred ties, the early\r\naffections, and the touching narratives and incidents, which mingle with\r\nall I know of this primitive family abode. I weep to think that none of\r\nthose who inhabited it are now among the living; and if ever I am\r\nashamed of it, or if I ever fail in affectionate veneration for him who\r\nreared it, and defended it against savage violence and destruction,\r\ncherished all the domestic virtues beneath its roof, and, through the\r\nfire and blood of a seven years' revolutionary war, shrunk from no\r\ndanger, no toil, no sacrifice, to serve his country, and to raise his\r\nchildren to a condition better than his own, may my name and the name of\r\nmy posterity be blotted for ever from the memory of mankind!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE LADIES OF RICHMOND.\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT A PUBLIC RECEPTION BY THE LADIES OF RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, ON\r\nTHE 5TH OF OCTOBER, 1840.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The visit of Mr. Webster to Richmond was short, and his public\r\nengagements so numerous, as to put it out of his power to return the\r\ncalls of his friends, or to pay his respects to their families. It was\r\naccordingly proposed that the ladies who might desire to do so should\r\nassemble in the \"Log Cabin,\" and that he should there pay his respects\r\nto them collectively. The meeting was large, and the building quite\r\nfull. On being introduced to them in a few appropriate remarks, by Mr.\r\nLyons, Mr. Webster addressed them in the following speech.]\r\n\r\nLadies,--I am very sure I owe the pleasure I now enjoy to your kind\r\ndisposition, which has given me the opportunity to present my thanks and\r\nmy respects to you thus collectively, since the shortness of my stay in\r\nthe city does not allow me the happiness of calling upon those,\r\nseverally and individually, from members of whose families I have\r\nreceived kindness and notice. And, in the first place, I wish to express\r\nto you my deep and hearty thanks, as I have endeavored to do to your\r\nfathers, your husbands, and your brothers, for the unbounded hospitality\r\nI have received ever since I came among you. This is registered, I\r\nassure you, in a grateful heart, in characters of an enduring nature.\r\nThe rough contests of the political world are not suited to the dignity\r\nand the delicacy of your sex; but you possess the intelligence to know\r\nhow much of that happiness which you are entitled to hope for, both for\r\nyourselves and for your children, depends on the right administration of\r\ngovernment, and a proper tone of public morals. That is a subject on\r\nwhich the moral perceptions of woman are both quicker and juster than\r\nthose of the other sex. I do not speak of that administration of\r\ngovernment whose object is merely the protection of industry, the\r\npreservation of civil liberty, and the securing to enterprise of its due\r\nreward. I speak of government in a somewhat higher point of view; I\r\nspeak of it in regard to its influence on the morals and sentiments of\r\nthe community. We live in an age distinguished for great benevolent\r\nexertion, in which the affluent are consecrating the means they possess\r\nto the endowment of colleges and academies, to the building of churches,\r\nto the support of religion and religious worship, to the encouragement\r\nof schools, lyceums, and athenaeums, and other means of general popular\r\ninstruction. This is all well; it is admirable; it augurs well for the\r\nprospects of ensuing generations. But I have sometimes thought, that,\r\namidst all this activity and zeal of the good and the benevolent, the\r\ninfluence of government on the morals and on the religious feelings of\r\nthe community is apt to be overlooked or underrated. I speak, of course,\r\nof its indirect influence, of the power of its example, and the general\r\ntone which it inspires.\r\n\r\nA popular government, in all these respects, is a most powerful\r\ninstitution; more powerful, as it has sometimes appeared to me, than the\r\ninfluence of most other human institutions put together, either for\r\ngood or for evil, according to its character. Its example, its tone,\r\nwhether of regard or disregard for moral obligation, is most important\r\nto human happiness; it is among those things which most affect the\r\npolitical morals of mankind, and their general morals also. I advert to\r\nthis, because there has been put forth, in modern times, the false\r\nmaxim, that there is one morality for politics, and another morality for\r\nother things; that, in their political conduct to their opponents, men\r\nmay say and do that which they would never think of saying or doing in\r\nthe personal relations of private life. There has been openly announced\r\na sentiment, which I consider as the very essence of false morality,\r\nwhich declares that \"all is fair in politics.\" If a man speaks falsely\r\nor calumniously of his neighbor, and is reproached for the offence, the\r\nready excuse is this: \"It was in relation to public and political\r\nmatters; I cherished no personal ill-will whatever against that\r\nindividual, but quite the contrary; I spoke of my adversary merely as a\r\npolitical man.\" In my opinion, the day is coming when falsehood will\r\nstand for falsehood, and calumny will be treated as a breach of the\r\ncommandment, whether it be committed politically or in the concerns of\r\nprivate life.\r\n\r\nIt is by the promulgation of sound morals in the community, and more\r\nespecially by the training and instruction of the young, that woman\r\nperforms her part towards the preservation of a free government. It is\r\ngenerally admitted that public liberty, and the perpetuity of a free\r\nconstitution, rest on the virtue and intelligence of the community which\r\nenjoys it. How is that virtue to be inspired, and how is that\r\nintelligence to be communicated? Bonaparte once asked Madame de Staël in\r\nwhat manner he could best promote the happiness of France. Her reply is\r\nfull of political wisdom. She said, \"Instruct the mothers of the French\r\npeople.\" Mothers are, indeed, the affectionate and effective teachers of\r\nthe human race. The mother begins her process of training with the\r\ninfant in her arms. It is she who directs, so to speak, its first mental\r\nand spiritual pulsations. She conducts it along the impressible years of\r\nchildhood and youth, and hopes to deliver it to the stern conflicts and\r\ntumultuous scenes of life, armed by those good principles which her\r\nchild has received from maternal care and love.\r\n\r\nIf we draw within the circle of our contemplation the mothers of a\r\ncivilized nation, what do we see? We behold so many artificers working,\r\nnot on frail and perishable matter, but on the immortal mind, moulding\r\nand fashioning beings who are to exist for ever. We applaud the artist\r\nwhose skill and genius present the mimic man upon the canvas; we admire\r\nand celebrate the sculptor who works out that same image in enduring\r\nmarble; but how insignificant are these achievements, though the highest\r\nand the fairest in all the departments of art, in comparison with the\r\ngreat vocation of human mothers! They work, not upon the canvas that\r\nshall perish, or the marble that shall crumble into dust, but upon mind,\r\nupon spirit, which is to last for ever, and which is to bear, for good\r\nor evil, throughout its duration, the impress of a mother's plastic\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nI have already expressed the opinion, which all allow to be correct,\r\nthat our security for the duration of the free institutions which bless\r\nour country depends upon habits of virtue and the prevalence of\r\nknowledge and of education. The attainment of knowledge does not\r\ncomprise all which is contained in the larger term of education. The\r\nfeelings are to be disciplined; the passions are to be restrained; true\r\nand worthy motives are to be inspired; a profound religious feeling is\r\nto be instilled, and pure morality inculcated, under all circumstances.\r\nAll this is comprised in education. Mothers who are faithful to this\r\ngreat duty will tell their children, that neither in political nor in\r\nany other concerns of life can man ever withdraw himself from the\r\nperpetual obligations of conscience and of duty; that in every act,\r\nwhether public or private, he incurs a just responsibility; and that in\r\nno condition is he warranted in trifling with important rights and\r\nobligations. They will impress upon their children the truth, that the\r\nexercise of the elective franchise is a social duty, of as solemn a\r\nnature as man can be called to perform; that a man may not innocently\r\ntrifle with his vote; that every free elector is a trustee, as well for\r\nothers as himself; and that every man and every measure he supports has\r\nan important bearing on the interests of others, as well as on his own.\r\nIt is in the inculcation of high and pure morals such as these, that, in\r\na free republic, woman performs her sacred duty, and fulfils her\r\ndestiny. The French, as you know, are remarkable for their fondness for\r\nsententious phrases, in which much meaning is condensed into a small\r\nspace. I noticed lately, on the title-page of one of the books of\r\npopular instruction in France, this motto: \"Pour instruction on the\r\nheads of the people! you owe them that baptism.\" And, certainly, if\r\nthere be any duty which may be described by a reference to that great\r\ninstitute of religion,--a duty approaching it in importance, perhaps\r\nnext to it in obligation,--it is this.\r\n\r\nI know you hardly expect me to address you on the popular political\r\ntopics of the day. You read enough, you hear quite enough, on those\r\nsubjects. You expect me only to meet you, and to tender my profound\r\nthanks for this marked proof of your regard, and will kindly receive the\r\nassurances with which I tender to you, on parting, my affectionate\r\nrespects and best wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEPTION AT BOSTON.\r\n\r\nA SPEECH MADE IN FANEUIL HALL, ON THE 30TH OF SEPTEMBER, 1842, AT A\r\nPUBLIC RECEPTION GIVEN TO MR. WEBSTER, ON HIS RETURN TO BOSTON, AFTER\r\nTHE NEGOTIATION OF THE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[On the accession of General Harrison to the Presidency of the United\r\nStates, on the 4th of March, 1841, Mr. Webster was called to the office\r\nof Secretary of State, in which, after the President's untimely death,\r\nhe continued under Mr. Tyler for about two years. The relations of the\r\ncountry with Great Britain were at that time in a very critical\r\nposition. The most important and difficult subject which engaged the\r\nattention of the government, while he filled the Department of State,\r\nwas the negotiation of the treaty with Great Britain, which was signed\r\nat Washington on the 9th of August, 1842. The other members of General\r\nHarrison's Cabinet having resigned their places in the autumn of 1841,\r\ndiscontent was felt by some of their friends, that Mr. Webster should\r\nhave consented to retain his. But as Mr. Tyler continued to place entire\r\nconfidence in Mr. Webster's administration of the Department of State,\r\nthe great importance of pursuing a steady line of policy in reference to\r\nforeign affairs, and especially the hope of averting a rupture with\r\nEngland by an honorable settlement of our difficulties with that\r\ncountry, induced Mr. Webster to remain at his post.\r\n\r\nOn occasion of a visit made by him to Boston, after the adjournment of\r\nCongress, in August, 1842, a number of his friends were desirous of\r\nmanifesting their sense of the services which he had rendered to the\r\ncountry by pursuing this course. A public meeting of citizens was\r\naccordingly held in Faneuil Hall, on the 30th of September, 1842. At\r\nthis meeting the following speech was made.]\r\n\r\nI know not how it is, Mr. Mayor, but there is something in the echoes of\r\nthese walls, or in this sea of upturned faces which I behold before me,\r\nor in the genius that always hovers over this place, fanning ardent and\r\npatriotic feeling by every motion of its wings,--I know not how it is,\r\nbut there is something that excites me strangely, deeply, before I even\r\nbegin to speak. It cannot be doubted that this salutation and greeting\r\nfrom my fellow-citizens of Boston is a tribute dear to my heart. Boston\r\nis indeed my home, my cherished home. It is now more than twenty-five\r\nyears since I came to it with my family, to pursue, here in this\r\nenlightened metropolis, those objects of professional life for which my\r\nstudies and education were designed to fit me. It is twenty years since\r\nI was invited by the citizens of Boston to take upon myself an office of\r\npublic trust in their service.[1] It gives me infinite pleasure to see\r\nhere to-day, among those who hold the seats yielded to such as are more\r\nadvanced in life, not a few of the gentlemen who were earnestly\r\ninstrumental in inducing me to enter upon a course of life wholly\r\nunexpected, and to devote myself to the service of the public.\r\n\r\nWhenever the duties of public life have withdrawn me from this home, I\r\nhave felt it, nevertheless, to be the attractive spot to which all local\r\naffection tended. And now that the progress of time must shortly bring\r\nabout the period, if it should not be hastened by the progress of\r\nevents, when the duties of public life shall yield to the influences of\r\nadvancing years, I cherish no hope more precious, than to pass here in\r\nthese associations and among these friends what may remain to me of\r\nlife; and to leave in the midst of you, fellow-citizens, partaking of\r\nyour fortunes, whether for good or for evil, those who bear my name, and\r\ninherit my blood.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor has alluded, very kindly, to the exertions which I have made\r\nsince I have held a position in the Cabinet, and especially to the\r\nresults of the negotiation in which I have been recently engaged. I\r\nhope, fellow-citizens, that something has been done which may prove\r\npermanently useful to the public. I have endeavored to do something, and\r\nI hope my endeavors have not been in vain. I have had a hard summer's\r\nwork, it is true, but I am not wholly unused to hard work. I have had\r\nsome anxious days, I have spent some sleepless nights; but if the\r\nresults of my efforts shall be approved by the community, I am richly\r\ncompensated. My other days will be the happier, and my other nights will\r\nbe given to a sweeter repose.\r\n\r\nIt was an object of the highest national importance, no doubt, to\r\ndisperse the clouds which threatened a storm between England and\r\nAmerica. For several years past there has been a class of questions open\r\nbetween the two countries, which have not always threatened war, but\r\nwhich have prevented the people from being assured of permanent peace.\r\n\r\nHis Honor the Mayor has paid a just tribute to that lamented personage,\r\nby whom, in 1841, I was called to the place I now occupy; and although,\r\nGentlemen, I know it is in very bad taste to speak much of one's self,\r\nyet here, among my friends and neighbors, I wish to say a word or two on\r\nsubjects in which I am concerned. With the late President Harrison I had\r\ncontracted an acquaintance while we were both members of Congress, and I\r\nhad an opportunity of renewing it afterwards in his own house, and\r\nelsewhere. I have made no exhibition or boast of the confidence which it\r\nwas his pleasure to repose in me; but circumstances, hardly worthy of\r\nserious notice, have rendered it not improper for me to say on this\r\noccasion, that as soon as President Harrison was elected, without, of\r\ncourse, one word from me, he wrote to me inviting me to take a place in\r\nhis Cabinet, leaving to me the choice of that place, and asking my\r\nadvice as to the persons that should fill every other place in it. He\r\nexpressed rather a wish that I should take the administration of the\r\ntreasury, because, as he was pleased to say, I had devoted myself with\r\nsuccess to the examination of the questions of currency and finance, and\r\nhe felt that the wants of the country,--the necessities of the country,\r\non the great subjects of currency and finance,--were moving causes that\r\nproduced the revolution which had placed him in the presidential chair.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, Gentlemen, that my preference was for another\r\nplace,--for that which I have now the honor to fill. I felt all its\r\nresponsibilities; but I must say, that, with whatever attention I had\r\nconsidered the general questions of finance, I felt more competent and\r\nwilling to undertake the duties of an office which did not involve the\r\ndaily drudgery of the treasury.\r\n\r\nI was not disappointed, Gentlemen, in the exigency which then existed in\r\nour foreign relations. I was not unaware of all the difficulties which\r\nhung over us; for although the whole of the danger was not at that\r\nmoment developed, the cause of it was known, and it seemed as if an\r\noutbreak was inevitable. I allude now to that occurrence on the frontier\r\nof which the chairman has already spoken, which took place in the winter\r\nof 1841 the case of Alexander McLeod.\r\n\r\nA year or two before, the Canadian government had seen fit to authorize\r\na military incursion, for a particular purpose, within the territory of\r\nthe United States. That purpose was to destroy a steamboat, charged with\r\nbeing employed for hostile purposes against its forces and the\r\npeaceable subjects of the crown. The act was avowed by the British\r\ngovernment at home as a public act. Alexander McLeod, a person who\r\nindividually could claim no regard or sympathy, happened to be one of\r\nthe agents who, in a military character, performed the act of their\r\nsovereign. Coming into the United States some years after, he was\r\narrested under a charge of homicide committed in this act, and was held\r\nto trial as for a private felony.\r\n\r\nAccording to my apprehensions, a proceeding of this kind was directly\r\nadverse to the well-settled doctrines of the public law. It could not\r\nbut be received with lively indignation, not only by the British\r\ngovernment, but among the people of England. It would be so received\r\namong us. If a citizen of the United States should as a military man\r\nreceive an order of his government and obey it, (and he must either obey\r\nit or be hanged,) and should afterwards, in the territory of another\r\npower, which by that act he had offended, be tried for a violation of\r\nits law, as for a crime, and threatened with individual punishment,\r\nthere is not a man in the United States who would not cry out for\r\nredress and for vengeance. Any elevated government, in a case like this,\r\nwhere one of its citizens, in the performance of his duty, incurs such\r\nmenaces and danger, assumes the responsibility; any elevated government\r\nsays, \"The act was mine,--I am the man\";--\"Adsum qui feci, in me\r\nconvertite ferrum.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, information of the action of the British government on\r\nthis subject was transmitted to us at Washington within a few days after\r\nthe installation of General Harrison. I did not think that it was proper\r\nto make public then, nor is it important to say now, all that we knew on\r\nthe subject; but I will tell you, in general terms, that if all that was\r\nknown at Washington then had been divulged throughout the country, the\r\nvalue of the shipping interest of this city, and of every other interest\r\nconnected with the commerce of the country, would have been depressed\r\none half in six hours. I thought that the concussion might be averted,\r\nby holding up to view the principles of public law by which this\r\nquestion ought to be settled, and by demanding an apology for whatever\r\nhad been done against those principles of public law by the British\r\ngovernment or its officers. I thought we ought to put ourselves right in\r\nthe first place, and then we could insist that they should do right in\r\nthe next place. When in England, in the year 1839, I had occasion to\r\naddress a large and respectable assemblage; and allusion having been\r\nmade to the relations of things between the two countries, I stated\r\nthen, what I thought and now think, that in any controversy which should\r\nterminate in war between the United States and England, the only eminent\r\nadvantage that _either_ would possess would be found in the rectitude of\r\nits cause. With the right on our side, we are a match for England; and\r\nwith the right on her side, she is a match for us, or for anybody.\r\n\r\nWe live in an age, fellow-citizens, when there has been established\r\namong the nations a more elevated tribunal than ever before existed on\r\nearth; I mean the tribunal of the enlightened public opinion of the\r\nworld. Governments cannot go to war now, either with or against the\r\nconsent of their own subjects or people, without the reprobation of\r\nother states, unless for grounds and reasons justifying them in the\r\ngeneral judgment of mankind. The judgment of civilization, of commerce,\r\nand of that heavenly light that beams over Christendom, restrains men,\r\ncongresses, parliaments, princes, and people from gratifying the\r\ninordinate love of ambition through the bloody scenes of war. It has\r\nbeen wisely said, and it is true, that every settlement of national\r\ndifferences between Christian states by fair negotiation, without resort\r\nto arms, is a new illustration and a new proof of the benign influence\r\nof the Christian faith.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the terms of this treaty, and in relation to the other\r\nsubjects connected with it, it is somewhat awkward for me to speak,\r\nbecause the documents connected with them have not been made public by\r\nauthority. But I persuade myself, that, when the whole shall be calmly\r\nconsidered, it will be seen that there was throughout a fervent\r\ndisposition to maintain the interest and honor of the country, united\r\nwith a proper regard for the preservation of peace between us and the\r\ngreatest commercial nation of the world.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, while I receive these commendations which you have bestowed,\r\nI have an agreeable duty to perform to others. In the first place, I\r\nhave great pleasure in bearing testimony to the intelligent interest\r\nmanifested by the President of the United States, under whose authority,\r\nof course, I constantly acted throughout the negotiation, and his\r\nsincere and anxious desire that it might result successfully. I take\r\ngreat pleasure in acknowledging here, as I will acknowledge everywhere,\r\nmy obligations to him for the unbroken and steady confidence reposed in\r\nme through the whole progress of an affair not unimportant to the\r\ncountry, and infinitely important to my own reputation.\r\n\r\nA negotiator disparaged, distrusted, treated with jealousy by his own\r\ngovernment, would be indeed a very unequal match for a cool and\r\nsagacious representative of one of the proudest and most powerful\r\nmonarchies of Europe, possessing in the fullest extent the confidence of\r\nhis government, and authorized to bind it in concerns of the greatest\r\nimportance. I shall never forget the frankness and generosity with\r\nwhich, after a full and free interchange of suggestions upon the\r\nsubject, I was told by the President that on my shoulders rested the\r\nresponsibility of the negotiation, and on my discretion and judgment\r\nshould rest the lead of every measure. I desire also to speak here of\r\nthe hearty co-operation rendered every day by the other gentlemen\r\nconnected with the administration, from every one of whom I received\r\nimportant assistance. I speak with satisfaction, also, of the useful\r\nlabors of all the Commissioners, although I need hardly say here, what\r\nhas been already said officially, that the highest respect is due to the\r\nCommissioners from Maine and Massachusetts for their faithful adherence\r\nto the rights of their own States, mingled with a cordial co-operation\r\nin what was required by the general interests of the United States. And\r\nI hope I shall not be considered as trespassing on this occasion, if I\r\nspeak of the happy selection made by England of a person to represent\r\nher government on this occasion,[2]--a thorough Englishman,\r\nunderstanding and appreciating the great objects and interests of his\r\nown government, of large and liberal views, and of such standing and\r\nweight of character at home, as to impress a feeling of approbation of\r\nhis course upon both government and people. He was fully acquainted with\r\nthe subject, and always, on all occasions, as far as his allegiance and\r\nduty permitted, felt and manifested good-will towards this country.\r\n\r\nAside from the question of the boundary, there were other important\r\nsubjects to be considered, to which I know not whether this is a proper\r\noccasion to allude. When the results of the negotiation shall be fully\r\nbefore the public, it will be seen that these other questions have not\r\nbeen neglected, questions of great moment and importance to the country;\r\nand then I shall look with concern, but with faith and trust, for the\r\njudgment of that country upon them. It is but just to take notice of a\r\nvery important act, intended to provide for such cases as McLeod's, for\r\nwhich the country is indebted to the Whig majorities in the two houses\r\nof Congress, acting upon the President's recommendation. Events showed\r\nthe absolute necessity of removing into the national tribunals questions\r\ninvolving the peace and honor of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere yet remain, Gentlemen, several other subjects still unsettled with\r\nEngland. First, there is that concerning the trade between the United\r\nStates and the possessions of England, on this continent and in the West\r\nIndies. It has been my duty to look into that subject, and to keep the\r\nrun of it, as we say, from the arrangement of 1829 and 1830, until the\r\npresent time. That arrangement was one unfavorable to the shipping\r\ninterests of the United States, and especially so to the New England\r\nStates. To adjust these relations is an important subject, either for\r\ndiplomatic negotiation, or the consideration of Congress. One or both\r\nhouses of Congress, indeed, have already called upon the proper\r\ndepartment for a report upon the operations of that arrangement, and a\r\ncommittee of the House of Representatives has made a report, showing\r\nthat some adjustment of these relations is of vital importance to the\r\nfuture prosperity of our navigating interests.\r\n\r\nThere is another question, somewhat more remote; that of the Northwest\r\nBoundary, where the possessions of the two countries touch each other\r\nupon the Pacific. There are evident public reasons why that question\r\nshould be settled before the country becomes peopled.\r\n\r\nThere are also, Gentlemen, many open questions respecting our relations\r\nwith other governments. Upon most of the other States of this continent,\r\ncitizens of the United States have claims, with regard to which the\r\ndelays already incurred have caused great injustice; and it becomes the\r\ngovernment of the United States, by a calm and dignified course, and a\r\ndeliberate and vigorous tone of administration of public affairs, to\r\nsecure prompt justice to our citizens in these quarters.\r\n\r\nI am here to-day as a guest. I was invited by a number of highly valued\r\npersonal and political friends to partake with them of a public dinner,\r\nfor the purpose of giving them an opportunity to pass the usual greeting\r\nof friends upon my return; of testifying their respect for my public\r\nservices heretofore; and of exchanging congratulations upon the results\r\nof the late negotiation. It was at my instance that the proposed dinner\r\ntook the form of this meeting, and, instead of meeting them at the\r\nfestive board, I agreed to meet them, and those who chose to meet me\r\nwith them, here. Still, the general character of the meeting seems not\r\nto be changed. I am here as a guest; here to receive greetings and\r\nsalutations for particular services, and not under any intimation or\r\nexpectation that I should address the gentlemen who invited me or others\r\nhere, upon subjects not suggested by themselves. It would not become me\r\nto use the occasion for any more general purpose. Because, although I\r\nhave a design, at some time not far distant, to make known my sentiments\r\nupon political matters generally, and upon the political state of the\r\ncountry and that of its several parties, yet I know very well that I\r\nshould be trespassing beyond the bounds of politeness and propriety,\r\nshould I enter upon this whole wide field now. I will not enter upon it,\r\nbecause the gentlemen who invited me entertain on many of these topics\r\nviews different from my own, and they would very properly say, that they\r\ncame here to meet Mr. Webster, to congratulate him upon the late\r\nnegotiation, and to exchange sentiments upon matters about which they\r\nagreed with him; and that it was not in very correct taste for him to\r\nuse the occasion to express opinions upon other subjects on which they\r\ndiffer. It is on that account that I shall forbear discussing political\r\nsubjects at large, and shall endeavor to confine my remarks to what may\r\nbe considered as affecting myself, directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor was kind enough to say, that having, in his judgment,\r\nperformed the duties of my own department to the satisfaction of my\r\ncountry, it might be left to me to take care of my own honor and\r\nreputation. I suppose that he meant to say, that in the present\r\ndistracted state of the Whig party, and among the contrariety of\r\nopinions that prevail (if there be a contrariety of opinion) as to the\r\ncourse proper for _me_ to pursue, the decision of that question might be\r\nleft to myself. I am exactly of his opinion. I am quite of opinion that\r\non a question touching my own honor and character, as I am to bear the\r\nconsequences of the decision, I had a great deal better be trusted to\r\nmake it. No man feels more highly the advantage of the advice of friends\r\nthan I do; but on a question so delicate and important as that, I like\r\nto choose myself the friends who are to give me advice; and upon this\r\nsubject, Gentlemen, I shall leave you as enlightened as I found you.\r\n\r\nI give no pledges, I make no intimations, one way or the other; and I\r\nwill be as free, when this day closes, to act as duty calls, as I was\r\nwhen the dawn of this day--(Here Mr. Webster was interrupted by\r\ntremendous applause. When silence was restored he continued:)\r\n\r\nThere is a delicacy in the case, because there is always delicacy and\r\nregret when one feels obliged to differ from his friends; but there is\r\nno embarrassment. There is no embarrassment, because, if I see the path\r\nof duty before me, I have that within me which will enable me to pursue\r\nit, and throw all embarrassment to the winds. A public man has no\r\noccasion to be embarrassed, if he is honest. Himself and his feelings\r\nshould be to him as nobody and as nothing; the interest of his country\r\nmust be to him as every thing; he must sink what is personal to himself,\r\nmaking exertions for his country; and it is his ability and readiness to\r\ndo this which are to mark him as a great or as a little man in time to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThere were many persons in September, 1841, who found great fault with\r\nmy remaining in the President's Cabinet. You know, Gentlemen, that\r\ntwenty years of honest, and not altogether undistinguished service in\r\nthe Whig cause, did not save me from an outpouring of wrath, which\r\nseldom proceeds from Whig pens and Whig tongues against anybody. I am,\r\nGentlemen, a little hard to coax, but as to being driven, that is out of\r\nthe question. I chose to trust my own judgment, and thinking I was at a\r\npost where I was in the service of the country, and could do it good, I\r\nstayed there. And I leave it to you to-day to say, I leave it to my\r\ncountry to say, whether the country would have been better off if I had\r\nleft also. I have no attachment to office. I have tasted of its sweets,\r\nbut I have tasted of its bitterness. I am content with what I have\r\nachieved; I am more ready to rest satisfied with what is gained, than to\r\nrun the risk of doubtful efforts for new acquisition.\r\n\r\nI suppose I ought to pause here. (Cries of \"Go on!\") I ought, perhaps,\r\nto allude to nothing more, and I will not allude to any thing further\r\nthan it may be supposed to concern myself, directly or by implication.\r\nGentlemen, and Mr. Mayor, a most respectable convention of Whig\r\ndelegates met in this place a few days since, and passed very important\r\nresolutions. There is no set of gentlemen in the Commonwealth, so far as\r\nI know them, who have more of my respect and regard. They are Whigs, but\r\nthey are no better Whigs than I am. They have served the country in the\r\nWhig ranks; so have I, quite as long as most of them, though perhaps\r\nwith less ability and success. Their resolutions on political subjects,\r\nas representing the Whigs of the State, are entitled to respect, so far\r\nas they were authorized to express opinion on those subjects, and no\r\nfurther. They were sent hither, as I supposed, to agree upon candidates\r\nfor the offices of Governor and Lieutenant-Governor for the support of\r\nthe Whigs of Massachusetts; and if they had any authority to speak in\r\nthe name of the Whigs of Massachusetts to any other purport or intent, I\r\nhave not been informed of it. I feel very little disturbed by any of\r\nthose proceedings, of whatever nature; but some of them appear to me to\r\nhave been inconsiderate and hasty, and their point and bearing can\r\nhardly be mistaken. I notice, among others, a declaration made, in\r\nbehalf of all the Whigs of this Commonwealth, of \"a full and final\r\nseparation from the President of the United States.\" If those gentlemen\r\nsaw fit to express their own sentiments to that extent, there was no\r\nobjection. Whigs speak their sentiments everywhere; but whether they may\r\nassume a privilege to speak for others on a point on which those others\r\nhave not given them authority, is another question. I am a Whig, I\r\nalways have been a Whig, and I always will be one; and if there are any\r\nwho would turn me out of the pale of that communion, let them see who\r\nwill get out first. I am a Massachusetts Whig, a Faneuil Hall Whig,\r\nhaving breathed this air for five-and-twenty years, and meaning to\r\nbreathe it as long as my life is spared. I am ready to submit to all\r\ndecisions of Whig conventions on subjects on which they are authorized\r\nto make decisions; I know that great party good and great public good\r\ncan only be so obtained. But it is quite another question whether a set\r\nof gentlemen, however respectable they may be as individuals, shall have\r\nthe power to bind me on matters which I have not agreed to submit to\r\ntheir decision at all.\r\n\r\n\"A full and final separation\" is declared between the Whig party of\r\nMassachusetts and the President. That is the text: it requires a\r\ncommentary. What does it mean? The President of the United States has\r\nthree years of his term of office yet unexpired. Does this declaration\r\nmean, then, that during those three years all the measures of his\r\nadministration are to be opposed by the great body of the Whig party of\r\nMassachusetts, whether they are right or wrong? There are great public\r\ninterests which require his attention. If the President of the United\r\nStates should attempt, by negotiation, or by earnest and serious\r\napplication to Congress, to make some change in the present\r\narrangements, such as should be of service to those interests of\r\nnavigation which are concerned in the colonial trade, are the Whigs of\r\nMassachusetts to give him neither aid nor succor? If the President of\r\nthe United States shall direct the proper department to review the whole\r\ncommercial policy of the United States, in respect of reciprocity in the\r\nindirect trade, to which so much of our tonnage is now sacrificed, if\r\nthe amendment of this policy shall be undertaken by him, is there such a\r\nseparation between him and the Whigs of Massachusetts as shall lead them\r\nand their representatives to oppose it. Do you know (there are gentlemen\r\nnow here who do know) that a large proportion, I rather think more than\r\none half, of the carrying trade between the empire of Brazil and the\r\nUnited States is enjoyed by tonnage from the North of Europe, in\r\nconsequence of this ill-considered principle with regard to reciprocity.\r\nYou might just as well admit them into the coasting trade. By this\r\narrangement, we take the bread out of our children's mouths and give it\r\nto strangers. I appeal to you, Sir, (turning to Captain Benjamin Rich,\r\nwho sat by him,) is not this true? (Mr. Rich at once replied, True!) Is\r\nevery measure of this sort, for the relief of such abuses, to be\r\nrejected? Are we to suffer ourselves to remain inactive under every\r\ngrievance of this kind until these three years shall expire, and through\r\nas many more as shall pass until Providence shall bless us with more\r\npower of doing good than we have now?\r\n\r\nAgain, there are now in this State persons employed under government,\r\nallowed to be pretty good Whigs, still holding their offices;\r\ncollectors, district attorneys, postmasters, marshals. What is to become\r\nof them in this separation? Which side are they to fall? Are they to\r\nresign? or is this resolution to be held up to government as an\r\ninvitation or a provocation to turn them out? Our distinguished\r\nfellow-citizen, who, with so much credit to himself and to his country,\r\nrepresents our government in England,[3]--is _he_ expected to come home,\r\non this separation, and yield his place to his predecessor,[4] or to\r\nsomebody else? And in regard to the individual who addresses you,--what\r\ndo his brother Whigs mean to do with him? Where do they mean to place\r\nme? Generally, when a divorce takes place, the parties divide their\r\nchildren. I am anxious to know where, in the case of this divorce, I\r\nshall fall. This declaration announces a full and final separation\r\nbetween the Whigs of Massachusetts and the President. If I choose to\r\nremain in the President's councils, do these gentlemen mean to say that\r\nI cease to be a Massachusetts Whig? I am quite ready to put that\r\nquestion to the people of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nI would not treat this matter too lightly, nor yet too seriously. I know\r\nvery well that, when public bodies get together, resolutions can never\r\nbe considered with any degree of deliberation. They are passed as they\r\nare presented. Who the honorable gentlemen were who drew this resolution\r\nI do not know. I suspect that they had not much meaning in it, and that\r\nthey have not very clearly defined what little meaning they had. They\r\nwere angry; they were resentful; they had drawn up a string of charges\r\nagainst the President,--a bill of indictment, as it were,--and, to close\r\nthe whole, they introduced this declaration about \"a full and final\r\nseparation.\" I could not read this, of course, without perceiving that\r\nit had an intentional or unintentional bearing on my position; and\r\ntherefore it was proper for me to allude to it here.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, there are some topics on which it has been my fortune to\r\ndiffer from my old friends. They may be right on these topics; very\r\nprobably they are; but I am sure _I_ am right in maintaining my\r\nopinions, such as they are, when I have formed them honestly and on\r\ndeliberation. There seems to me to be a disposition to postpone all\r\nattempts to do good to the country to some future and uncertain day. Yet\r\nthere is a Whig majority in each house of Congress, and I am of opinion\r\nthat now is the time to accomplish what yet remains to be accomplished.\r\nSome gentlemen are for suffering the present Congress to expire; another\r\nCongress to be chosen, and to expire also; a third Congress to be\r\nchosen, and then, if there shall be a Whig majority in both branches,\r\nand a Whig President, they propose to take up highly important and\r\npressing subjects. These are persons, Gentlemen, of more sanguine\r\ntemperament than myself. \"Confidence,\" says Lord Chatham, \"is a plant of\r\nslow growth in an old bosom.\" He referred to confidence in men, but the\r\nremark is as true of confidence in predictions of future occurrences.\r\nMany Whigs see before us a prospect of more power, and a better chance\r\nto serve the country, than we now possess. Far along in the horizon,\r\nthey discern mild skies and halcyon seas, while fogs and darkness and\r\nmists blind other sons of humanity from beholding all this bright\r\nvision. It was not so that we accomplished our last great victory, by\r\nsimply brooding over a glorious Whig future. We succeeded in 1840, but\r\nnot without an effort; and I know that nothing but union, cordial,\r\nsympathetic, fraternal union, can prevent the party that achieved that\r\nsuccess from renewed prostration. It is not,--I would say it in the\r\npresence of the world,--it is not by premature and partial, by\r\nproscriptive and denunciatory proceedings, that this great Whig family\r\ncan ever be kept together, or that Whig counsels can maintain their\r\nascendency. This is perfectly plain and obvious. It was a party, from\r\nthe first, made up of different opinions and principles, of gentlemen of\r\nevery political complexion, uniting to make a change in the\r\nadministration. They were men of strong State-rights principles, men of\r\nstrong federal principles, men of extreme tariff, and men of extreme\r\nanti-tariff notions. What could be expected of such a party, unless\r\nanimated by a spirit of conciliation and harmony, of union and sympathy?\r\nIts true policy was, from the first, and must be, unless it meditates\r\nits own destruction, to heal, and not to widen, the breaches that\r\nexisted in its ranks. It consented to become united in order to save the\r\ncountry from a continuation of a ruinous course of measures. And the\r\nlesson taught by the whole history of the revolution of 1840 is the\r\nmomentous value of conciliation, friendship, sympathy, and union.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, if I understand the matter, there were four or five great\r\nobjects in that revolution. And, in the first place, one great object\r\nwas that of attempting to secure permanent peace between this country\r\nand England. For although, as I have said, we were not actually at war,\r\nwe were subjected to perpetual agitations, which disturb the interests\r\nof the country almost as much as war. They break in upon men's pursuits,\r\nand render them incapable of calculating or judging of their chances of\r\nsuccess in any proposed line or course of business. A settled peace was\r\none of the objects of that revolution. I am glad if you think this is\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThe next object of that revolution was an increase of revenue. It was\r\nnotorious that, for the several last years, the expenditures for the\r\nadministration of government had exceeded the receipts; in other words,\r\ngovernment had been running in debt, and in the mean time the operation\r\nof the compromise act was still further and faster diminishing the\r\nrevenue itself. A sound revenue was one of those objects; and that it\r\nhas been accomplished, our thanks and praise are due to the Congress\r\nthat has just adjourned.\r\n\r\nA third object was protection, protection incidental to revenue, or\r\nconsequent upon revenue. Now as to that, Gentlemen, much has been done,\r\nand I hope it will be found that enough has been done. And for this,\r\ntoo, all the Whigs who supported that measure in Congress are entitled\r\nto high praise: they receive mine, and I hope they do yours; it is right\r\nthat they should. But let us be just. The French rhetoricians have a\r\nmaxim, that there is nothing beautiful that is not true; I am afraid\r\nthat some of our jubilant oratory would hardly stand the test of this\r\ncanon of criticism. It is not true that a majority, composed of Whigs,\r\ncould be found, in either house, in favor of the tariff bill. More than\r\nthirty Whigs, many of them gentlemen of lead and influence, voted\r\nagainst the law, from beginning to end, on all questions, direct and\r\nindirect; and it is not pleasant to consider what would have been the\r\nstate of the country, the treasury, and the government itself, at this\r\nmoment, if the law actually passed, for revenue and for protection, had\r\ndepended on Whig votes alone. After all, it passed the House of\r\nRepresentatives by a single vote; and there is a good deal of _éclat_\r\nabout that single vote. But did not every gentleman who voted for it\r\ntake the responsibility and deserve the honor of that single vote?\r\nSeveral gentlemen in the opposition thus befriended the bill; thus did\r\nour neighbor from the Middlesex District of this State,[5] voting for\r\nthe tariff out and out, as steadily as did my honored friend, the member\r\nfrom this city.[6] We hear nothing of his \"coming to the rescue,\" and\r\nyet he had that _one vote_, and held the tariff in his hand as\r\nabsolutely as if he had had a presidential veto! And how was it in the\r\nSenate? It passed by one vote again there, and could not have passed at\r\nall without the assistance of the two Senators from Pennsylvania, of Mr.\r\nWilliams of Maine, and of Mr. Wright of New York. Let us then admit the\r\ntruth (and a lawyer may do that when it helps his case), that it was\r\nnecessary that a large portion of the other party should come to the\r\nassistance of the Whigs to enable them to carry the tariff, and that, if\r\nthis assistance had not been rendered, the tariff must have failed.\r\n\r\nAnd this is a very important truth for New England. Her children,\r\nlooking to their manufactures and industry for their livelihood, must\r\nrejoice to find the tariff, so necessary to these, no party question.\r\nCan they desire, can they wish, that such a great object as the\r\nprotection of industry should become a party object, rising with party,\r\nand with the failure of the party that supported it going to the grave?\r\nThis is a public, a national question. The tariff ought to be inwrought\r\nin the sentiments of all parties; and although I hope that the\r\npre-eminence of Whig principles may be eternal, I wish to take bond and\r\nsecurity, that we may make the protection of domestic industry more\r\ndurable even than Whig supremacy.\r\n\r\nLet us be true in another respect. This tariff has accomplished much,\r\nand is an honor to the men who passed it. But in regard to protection it\r\nhas only restored the country to the state in which it was before the\r\ncompromise act, and from which it fell under the operation of that act.\r\nIt has repaired the consequences of that measure, and it has done _no\r\nmore_. I may speak of the compromise act. My turn has come now. No\r\nmeasure ever passed Congress during my connection with that body that\r\ncaused me so much grief and mortification. It was passed by a few\r\nfriends joining the whole host of the enemy. I have heard much of the\r\nmotives of that act. The personal motives of those that passed the act\r\nwere, I doubt not, pure; and all public men are supposed to act from\r\npure motives. But if by motives are meant the objects proposed by the\r\nact itself, and expressed in it, then I say, if those be the motives\r\nalluded to, they are worse than the act itself. The principle was bad,\r\nthe measure was bad, the consequences were bad. Every circumstance, as\r\nwell as every line of the act itself, shows that the design was to\r\nimpose upon legislation a restraint that the Constitution had not\r\nimposed; to insert in the Constitution a new prohibitory clause,\r\nproviding that, after the year 1842, no revenue should be collected\r\nexcept according to an absurd horizontal system, and none exceeding\r\ntwenty per cent. It was then pressed through under the great emergency\r\nof the public necessities. But I may now recur to what I then said,\r\nnamely, that its principle was false and dangerous, and that, when its\r\ntime came, it would rack and convulse our system. I said we should not\r\nget rid of it without throes and spasms. Has not this been as predicted?\r\nWe have felt the spasms and throes of this convulsion; but we have at\r\nlast gone through them, and begin to breathe again. It is something that\r\nthat act is at last got rid of; and the present tariff is deserving in\r\nthis, that it is specific and discriminating, that it holds to common\r\nsense, and rejects and discards the principles of the compromise act, I\r\nhope for ever.\r\n\r\nAnother great and principal object of the revolution of 1840 was a\r\nrestoration of the currency. Our troubles did not begin with want of\r\nmoney in the treasury, or under the sapping and mining operation of the\r\ncompromise act. They are of earlier date. The trouble and distress of\r\nthe country began with the _currency_ in 1833, and broke out with new\r\nseverity in 1837. Other causes of difficulty have since arisen, but the\r\nfirst great shock was a shock on the currency; and from the effect of\r\nthis the country is not yet relieved. I hope the late act may yield\r\ncompetent revenue, and am sure it will do much for protection. But until\r\nyou provide a better currency, so that you may have a universal one, of\r\nequal and general value throughout the land, I am hard to be persuaded\r\nthat we shall see the day of our former prosperity. Currency, accredited\r\ncurrency, and easy and cheap internal exchanges,--until these things be\r\nobtained, depend upon it, the country will find no adequate relief.\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, I will say a word or two on the history of the\r\ntransactions on this subject. At the special session of Congress, the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, Mr. Ewing, arranged a plan for a national\r\nbank. That plan was founded upon the idea of a large capital, furnished\r\nmainly by private subscriptions, and it included branches for local\r\ndiscounts. I need not advert, Gentlemen, to the circumstances under\r\nwhich this scheme was drawn up, and received, as it did, the approbation\r\nof the President and Cabinet, as the best thing that could be done. I\r\nneed not remind you, that he whom we had all agreed should hold the\r\nsecond place in the government had been called to the head of it. I need\r\nnot say that he held opinions wholly different from mine on the subjects\r\nwhich now came before us. But those opinions were fixed, and therefore\r\nit was thought the part of wisdom and prudence not to see how strong a\r\ncase might be made against the President, but to get along as well as we\r\nmight. With such views, Mr. Ewing presented his plan to Congress. As\r\nmost persons will remember, the clause allowing the bank to establish\r\nbranches provided that those branches might be placed in any State which\r\nshould give its consent. I have no idea that there is any necessity for\r\nsuch a restriction. I believe Congress has the power to establish the\r\nbranches without, as well as with, the consent of the States. But that\r\nclause, at most, was theoretical. I never could find anybody who could\r\nshow any practical mischief resulting from it. Its opponents went upon\r\nthe theory, which I do not exactly accord with, that an omission to\r\nexercise a power, in any case, amounts to a surrender of that power. At\r\nany rate, it was the best thing that could be done; and its rejection\r\nwas the commencement of the disastrous dissensions between the President\r\nand Congress.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it was exceedingly doubtful at the time when that plan was\r\nprepared whether the capital would be subscribed. But we did what we\r\ncould about it. We asked the opinion of the leading merchants of the\r\nprincipal commercial cities. They were invited to Washington to confer\r\nwith us. They expressed doubts whether the bank could be put into\r\noperation, but they expressed hopes also, and they pledged themselves to\r\ndo the best they could to advance it. And as the commercial interests\r\nwere in its favor, as the administration was new and fresh and popular,\r\nand the people were desirous to have something done, a great earnestness\r\nwas felt that that bill should be tried.\r\n\r\nIt was sent to the Senate at the Senate's request, and by the Senate it\r\nwas rejected. Another bill was reported in the Senate, without the\r\nprovision requiring the consent of the States to branches, was discussed\r\nfor six weeks or two months, and then could not pass even a Whig Senate.\r\nHere was the origin of distrust, disunion, and resentment.\r\n\r\nI will not pursue the unhappy narrative of the latter part of the\r\nsession of 1841. Men had begun to grow excited and angry and resentful.\r\nI expressed the opinion, at an early period, to all those to whom I was\r\nentitled to speak, that it would be a great deal better to forbear\r\nfurther action at present. That opinion, as expressed to the two Whig\r\nSenators from Massachusetts, is before the public. I wished Congress to\r\ngive time for consultation to take place, for harmony to be restored;\r\nbecause I looked for no good, except from the united and harmonious\r\naction of all the branches of the Whig government. I suppose that\r\ncounsel was not good, certainly it was not followed. I need not add the\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nThis brings us, as far as concerns the questions of currency, to the\r\nlast session of Congress. Early in that session the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury sent in a plan of an exchequer. It met with little favor in\r\neither House, and therefore it is necessary for me, Gentlemen, lest the\r\nwhole burden fall on others, to say that it had my hearty, sincere, and\r\nentire approbation. Gentlemen, I hope that I have not manifested through\r\nmy public life a very overweening confidence in my own judgment, or a\r\nvery unreasonable unwillingness to accept the views of others. But there\r\nare some subjects on which I feel entitled to pay some respect to my own\r\nopinion. The subject of currency, Gentlemen, has been the study of my\r\nlife. Thirty years ago, a little before my entrance into the House of\r\nRepresentatives, the questions connected with a mixed currency,\r\ninvolving the proper relation of paper to specie, and the proper means\r\nof restricting an excessive issue of paper, came to be discussed by the\r\nmost acute and well-disciplined understandings in England in Parliament.\r\nAt that time, during the suspension of specie payments by the bank, when\r\npaper was fifteen per cent below par, Mr. Vansittart had presented his\r\ncelebrated resolution, declaring that a bank-note was still worth the\r\nvalue expressed on its face; that the bank note had not depreciated, but\r\nthat the price of bullion had risen. Lord Liverpool and Lord Castlereagh\r\nespoused this view, as we know, and it was opposed by the close\r\nreasoning of Huskisson, the powerful logic of Horner, and the practical\r\nsagacity and common sense of Alexander Baring, now Lord Ashburton. The\r\nstudy of those debates made me a bullionist. They convinced me that\r\npaper could not circulate safely in any country, any longer than it was\r\nimmediately redeemable at the place of its issue. Coming into Congress\r\nthe very next year, or the next but one after, and finding the finances\r\nof the country in a most deplorable condition, I then and ever after\r\ndevoted myself, in preference to all other public topics, to the\r\nconsideration of the questions relating to them. I believe I have read\r\nevery thing of value that has been published since on those questions,\r\non either side of the Atlantic. I have studied by close observation the\r\nlaws of paper currency, as they have exhibited themselves in this and in\r\nother countries, from 1811 down to the present time. I have expressed my\r\nopinions at various times in Congress, and some of the predictions which\r\nI have made have not been altogether falsified by subsequent events. I\r\nmust therefore be permitted, Gentlemen, without yielding to any flippant\r\nnewspaper paragraph, or to the hasty ebullitions of debate in a public\r\nassembly, to say, that I believe the plan for an exchequer, as presented\r\nto Congress at its last session, is the _best_ measure, the _only_\r\nmeasure for the adoption of Congress and the trial of the people. I am\r\nready to stake my reputation upon it, and that is all that I have to\r\nstake. I am ready to stake my reputation, that, if this Whig Congress\r\nwill take that measure and give it a fair trial, within three years it\r\nwill be admitted by the whole American people to be the most beneficial\r\nmeasure of any sort ever adopted in this country, the Constitution only\r\nexcepted.\r\n\r\nI mean that they should take it as it was when it came from the Cabinet,\r\nnot as it looked when the committees of Congress had laid their hands\r\nupon it. For when the committees of Congress had struck out the proviso\r\nrespecting exchange, it was not worth a rush; it was not worth the\r\nparchment it would be engrossed upon. The great desire of this country\r\nis a general currency, a facility of exchange; a currency which shall be\r\nthe same for you and for the people of Alabama and Louisiana, and a\r\nsystem of exchange which shall equalize credit between them and you,\r\nwith the rapidity and facility with which steam conveys men and\r\nmerchandise. That is what the country wants, what you want; and you have\r\nnot got it. You have not got it, you cannot get it, but by some adequate\r\nprovision of government. Exchange, ready exchange, that will enable a\r\nman to turn his Orleans means into money to-day, (as we have had in\r\nbetter times millions a year exchanged, at only three quarters of one\r\nper cent,) is what is wanted How are we to obtain this? A Bank of the\r\nUnited States founded on a private subscription is out of the question.\r\nThat is an obsolete idea. The country and the condition of things have\r\nchanged. Suppose that a bank were chartered with a capital of fifty\r\nmillions, to be raised by private subscription. Would it not be out of\r\nall possibility to find the money? Who would subscribe? What would you\r\nget for shares? And as for the local discount, do you wish it? Do you,\r\nin State Street, wish that the nation should send millions of untaxed\r\nbanking capital hither to increase your discounts? What, then, shall we\r\ndo? People who are waiting for power to make a Bank of the United States\r\nmay as well postpone all attempts to benefit the country to the incoming\r\nof the Jews.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, shall we do? Let us turn to this plan of the exchequer,\r\nbrought forward last year. It was assailed from all quarters. One\r\ngentleman did say, I believe, that by some possibility some good might\r\ncome out of it, but in general it met with a different opposition from\r\nevery different class. Some said it would be a perfectly lifeless\r\nmachine,--that it was no system at all,--that it would do nothing, for\r\ngood or evil; others thought that it had a great deal too much vitality,\r\nadmitting that it would answer the purpose perfectly well for which it\r\nwas designed, but fearing that it would increase the executive power:\r\nthus making it at once King Log and King Serpent. One party called it a\r\nridiculous imbecility; the other, a dangerous giant, that might subvert\r\nthe Constitution. These varied arguments, contradicting, if not\r\nrefuting, one another, convinced me of one thing at least,--that the\r\nbill would not be adopted, nor even temperately and candidly considered.\r\nAnd it was not. In a manner quite unusual, it was discussed, assailed,\r\ndenounced, before it was allowed to take the course of reference and\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties we meet in carrying out our system of constitutional\r\ngovernment are indeed extraordinary. The Constitution was intended as\r\nan instrument of great political good; but we sometimes so dispute its\r\nmeaning, that we cannot use it at all. One man will not have a bank,\r\nwithout the power of local discount, against the consent of the States;\r\nfor that, he insists, would break the Constitution. Another will not\r\nhave a bank with such a power, because he thinks that would break the\r\nConstitution. A third will not have an exchequer, with authority to deal\r\nin exchanges, because that would increase executive influence, and so\r\nmight break the Constitution. And between them all, we are like the\r\nboatman who, in the midst of rocks and currents and whirlpools, will not\r\npull one stroke for safety, lest he break his oar. Are we now looking\r\nfor the time when we can charter a United States Bank with a large\r\nprivate subscription? When will that be? When confidence is restored.\r\nAre we, then, to do nothing to save the vessel from sinking, till the\r\nchances of the winds and waves have landed us on the shore? He is more\r\nsanguine than I am, who thinks that the time will soon come when the\r\nWhigs have more power to work effectually for the good of the country\r\nthan they now have. The voice of patriotism calls upon them not to\r\npostpone, but to act at this moment, at the very next session; to make\r\nthe best of their means, and to try. You say that the administration is\r\nresponsible; why not, then, try the plan it has recommended. If it\r\nfails, let the President bear the responsibility. If you will not try\r\nthis plan, why not propose something else?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, in speaking of events that have happened, I ought to say, and\r\nwill, since I am making a full and free communication, that there is no\r\none of my age, and I am no longer very young, who has written or spoken\r\nmore against the abuse and indiscreet use of the veto power than I have.\r\nAnd there is no one whose opinions upon this subject are less changed. I\r\npresume it is universally known, that I have advised against the use of\r\nthe veto power on every occasion when it has been used since I have been\r\nin the Cabinet. But I am, nevertheless, not willing to join those who\r\nseem more desirous to make out a case against the President, than of\r\nserving their country to the extent of their ability, vetoes\r\nnotwithstanding. Indeed, at the close of the extra session, the received\r\ndoctrine of many seemed to be, that they would undertake nothing until\r\nthey could amend the Constitution so as to do away with this power. This\r\nwas mere mockery. If we were now reforming the Constitution, we might\r\nwish for some, I do not say what, guards and restraints upon this power\r\nmore than the Constitution at present contains; but no convention would\r\nrecommend striking it out altogether. Have not the people of New York\r\nlately amended their constitution, so as to require, in certain\r\nlegislative action, votes of two thirds? and is not this same\r\nrestriction in daily use in the national House of Representatives\r\nitself, in the case of suspension of the rules? This constitutional\r\npower, therefore, is no greater a restraint than this body imposes on\r\nitself. But it is utterly hopeless to look for such an amendment; who\r\nexpects to live to see its day? And to give up all practical efforts,\r\nand to go on with a general idea that the Constitution must be amended\r\nbefore anything can be done, was, I will not say trifling, but treating\r\nthe great necessities of the people as of quite too little importance.\r\nThis Congress accomplished, in this regard, nothing for the people. The\r\nexchequer plan which was submitted to it will accomplish some of the\r\nobjects of the people, and especially the Whig people. I am confident of\r\nit; I know it. When a mechanic makes a tool, an axe, a saw, or a plane,\r\nand knows that the temper is good and the parts are well proportioned,\r\nhe knows that it will answer its purpose. And I know that this plan will\r\nanswer its purpose.\r\n\r\nThere are other objects which ought not to be neglected, among which is\r\none of such importance that I will not now pass it by; I mean, the\r\nmortifying state of the public credit of this country at this time. I\r\ncannot help thinking, that if the statesmen of a former age were among\r\nus, if Washington were here, if John Adams, and Hamilton, and Madison\r\nwere here, they would be deeply concerned and soberly thoughtful about\r\nthe present state of the public credit of the country. In the position I\r\nfill, it becomes my duty to read, generally with pleasure, but sometimes\r\nwith pain, communications from our public agents abroad. It is\r\ndistressing to hear them speak of _their_ distress at what they see and\r\nhear of the scorn and contumely with which the American character and\r\nAmerican credit are treated abroad. Why, at this very time, we have a\r\nloan in the market, which, at the present rate of money and credit,\r\nought to command in Europe one hundred and twenty-five per cent. Can we\r\nsell a dollar of it? And how is it with the credit of our own\r\nCommonwealth? Does it not find itself affected in its credit by the\r\ngeneral state of the credit of the country? Is there nobody ready to\r\nmake a movement in this matter? Is there not a man in our councils large\r\nenough, comprehensive enough in his views, to undertake at least to\r\n_present_ this case before the American people, and thus do something to\r\nrestore the public character for morals and honesty?\r\n\r\nThere are in the country some men who are indiscreet enough to talk of\r\n_repudiation_,--to advise their fellow-citizens to _repudiate_ public\r\ndebt. Does repudiation pay a debt? Does it discharge the debtor? Can it\r\nso modify a debt that it shall not be always binding, in law as well as\r\nin morals? No, Gentlemen; repudiation does nothing but add a sort of\r\ndisrepute to acknowledged inability. It is our duty, so far as is in our\r\npower, to rouse the public feeling on the subject; to maintain and\r\nassert the universal principles of law and justice, and the importance\r\nof preserving public faith and credit. People say that the intelligent\r\ncapitalists of Europe ought to distinguish between the United States\r\ngovernment and the State governments. So they ought; but, Gentlemen,\r\nwhat does all this amount to? Does not the general government comprise\r\nthe same people who make up the State governments? May not these\r\nEuropeans ask us how long it may be before the national councils will\r\nrepudiate public obligations?\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of repudiation has inflicted upon us a stain which we ought\r\nto feel worse than a wound; and the time has come when every man ought\r\nto address himself soberly and seriously to the correction of this great\r\nexisting evil. I do not undertake to say what the Constitution allows\r\nCongress to do in the premises. I will only say, that if that great fund\r\nof the public domain properly and in equity belongs, as is maintained,\r\nto the States themselves, there are some means, by regular and\r\nconstitutional laws, to enable and induce the States to save their own\r\ncredit and the credit of the country.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have detained you much too long. I have wished to say,\r\nthat, in my judgment, there remain certain important objects to engage\r\nour public and private attention, in the national affairs of the\r\ncountry. These are, the settlement of the remaining questions between\r\nourselves and England; the great questions relating to the reciprocity\r\nprinciple; those relating to colonial trade; the most absorbing\r\nquestions of the currency, and those relating to the great subject of\r\nthe restoration of the national character and the public faith; these\r\nare all objects to which I am willing to devote myself, both in public\r\nand in private life. I do not expect that much of public service remains\r\nto be done by me; but I am ready, for the promotion of these objects, to\r\nact with sober men of any party, and of all parties. I am ready to act\r\nwith men who are free from that great danger that surrounds all men of\r\nall parties,--the danger that patriotism itself, warmed and heated in\r\nparty contests, will run into partisanship. I believe that, among the\r\nsober men of this country, there is a growing desire for more moderation\r\nof party feeling, more predominance of purely public considerations,\r\nmore honest and general union of well-meaning men of all sides to uphold\r\nthe institutions of the country and carry them forward.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of these objects, in public life or in a private station,\r\nI am willing to perform the part assigned to me, and to give them, with\r\nhearty good-will and zealous effort, all that may remain to me of\r\nstrength and life.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The office of Representative in Congress.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Lord Ashburton.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mr. Edward Everett.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Mr. Andrew Stevenson.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Mr. Parmenter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Mr. R.C.

A commemorative oration was delivered in the morning by Hon.\r\nRufus Choate, in a style of eloquence rarely equalled. The public dinner\r\nof the Society, at the Astor House, at which M.H. Grinnell, Esq.\r\npresided, was attended by a very large company, composed of the members\r\nof the Society and their invited guests. Several appropriate toasts\r\nhaving been given and responded to by the distinguished individuals\r\npresent, George Griswold, Esq. rose to offer one in honor of Mr.\r\nWebster. After a few remarks complimentary to that gentleman, in\r\nreference to his services in refuting the doctrine of nullification and\r\nin averting the danger of war by the treaty of Washington, Mr. Griswold\r\ngave the following toast:--\r\n\r\n\"DANIEL WEBSTER,--the gift of New England to his country, his whole\r\ncountry, and nothing but his country.\"\r\n\r\nThis was received with great applause, and on rising to respond to it\r\nMr. Webster was greeted with nine enthusiastic cheers, and the most\r\nhearty and prolonged approbation. When silence was restored, he spoke as\r\nfollows.]\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT:--I have a grateful duty to perform in acknowledging the\r\nkindness of the sentiment thus expressed towards me. And yet I must say,\r\nGentlemen, that I rise upon this occasion under a consciousness that I\r\nmay probably disappoint highly raised, too highly raised expectations.\r\nIn the scenes of this evening, and in the scene of this day, my part is\r\nan humble one. I can enter into no competition with the fresher geniuses\r\nof those more eloquent gentlemen, learned and reverend, who have\r\naddressed this Society. I may perform, however, the humbler, but\r\nsometimes useful, duty of contrast, by adding the dark ground of the\r\npicture, which shall serve to bring out the more brilliant colors.\r\n\r\nI must receive, Gentlemen, the sentiment proposed by the worthy and\r\ndistinguished citizen of New York before me, as intended to convey the\r\nidea that, as a citizen of New England, as a son, a child, a _creation_\r\nof New England, I may be yet supposed to entertain, in some degree, that\r\nenlarged view of my duty as a citizen of the United States and as a\r\npublic man, which may, in some small measure, commend me to the regard\r\nof the whole country. While I am free to confess, Gentlemen, that there\r\nis no compliment of which I am more desirous to be thought worthy, I\r\nwill add, that a compliment of that kind could have proceeded from no\r\nsource more agreeable to my own feelings than from the gentleman who has\r\nproposed it,--an eminent merchant, the member of a body of eminent\r\nmerchants, known throughout the world for their intelligence and\r\nenterprise. I the more especially feel this, Gentlemen, because, whether\r\nI view the present state of things or recur to the history of the past,\r\nI can in neither case be ignorant how much that profession, and its\r\ndistinguished members, from an early day of our history, have\r\ncontributed to make the country what it is, and the government what it\r\nis.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the free nature of our institutions, and the popular form of\r\nthose governments which have come down to us from the Rock of Plymouth,\r\ngive scope to intelligence, to talent, enterprise, and public spirit,\r\nfrom all classes making up the great body of the community. And the\r\ncountry has received benefit in all its history and in all its\r\nexigencies, of the most eminent and striking character, from persons of\r\nthe class to which my friend before me belongs. Who will ever forget\r\nthat the first name signed to our ever-memorable and ever-glorious\r\nDeclaration of Independence is the name of John Hancock, a merchant of\r\nBoston? Who will ever forget that, in the most disastrous days of the\r\nRevolution, when the treasury of the country was bankrupt, with unpaid\r\nnavies and starving armies, it was a merchant,--Robert Morris of\r\nPhiladelphia,--who, by a noble sacrifice of his own fortune, as well as\r\nby the exercise of his great financial abilities, sustained and\r\nsupported the wise men of the country in council, and the brave men of\r\nthe country in the field of battle? Nor are there wanting more recent\r\ninstances. I have the pleasure to see near me, and near my friend who\r\nproposed this sentiment, the son of an eminent merchant of New England\r\n(Mr. Goodhue), an early member of the Senate of the United States,\r\nalways consulted, always respected, in whatever belonged to the duty and\r\nthe means of putting in operation the financial and commercial system of\r\nthe country; and this mention of the father of my friend brings to my\r\nmind the memory of his great colleague, the early associate of Hamilton\r\nand of Ames, trusted and beloved by Washington, consulted on all\r\noccasions connected with the administration of the finances, the\r\nestablishment of the treasury department, the imposition of the first\r\nrates of duty, and with every thing that belonged to the commercial\r\nsystem of the United States,--George Cabot, of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nI will take this occasion to say, Gentlemen, that there is no truth\r\nbetter developed and established in the history of the United States,\r\nfrom the formation of the Constitution to the present time, than\r\nthis,--that the mercantile classes, the great commercial masses of the\r\ncountry, whose affairs connect them strongly with every State in the\r\nUnion and with all the nations of the earth, whose business and\r\nprofession give a sort of nationality to their character,--that no class\r\nof men among us, from the beginning, have shown a stronger and firmer\r\ndevotion to whatsoever has been designed, or to whatever has tended, to\r\npreserve the union of these States and the stability of the free\r\ngovernment under which we live. The Constitution of the United States,\r\nin regard to the various municipal regulations and local interests, has\r\nleft the States individual, disconnected, isolated. It has left them\r\ntheir own codes of criminal law; it has left them their own system of\r\nmunicipal regulations. But there was one great interest, one great\r\nconcern, which, from the very nature of the case, was no longer to be\r\nleft under the regulations of the then thirteen, afterwards twenty, and\r\nnow twenty-six States, but was committed, necessarily committed, to the\r\ncare, the protection, and the regulation of one government; and this was\r\nthat great unit, as it has been called, the commerce of the United\r\nStates. There is no commerce of New York, no commerce of Massachusetts,\r\nnone of Georgia, none of Alabama or Louisiana. All and singular, in the\r\naggregate and in all its parts, is the commerce of the United States,\r\nregulated at home by a uniform system of laws under the authority of the\r\ngeneral government, and protected abroad under the flag of our\r\ngovernment, the glorious _E Pluribus Unum_, and guarded, if need be, by\r\nthe power of the general government all over the world. There is,\r\ntherefore, Gentlemen, nothing more cementing, nothing that makes us more\r\ncohesive, nothing that more repels all tendencies to separation and\r\ndismemberment, than this great, this common, I may say this overwhelming\r\ninterest of one commerce, one general system of trade and navigation,\r\none everywhere and with every nation of the globe. There is no flag of\r\nany particular American State seen in the Pacific seas, or in the\r\nBaltic, or in the Indian Ocean. Who knows, or who hears, there of your\r\nproud State, or of my proud State? Who knows, or who hears, of any\r\nthing, at the extremest north or south, or at the antipodes,--in the\r\nremotest regions of the Eastern or Western Sea,--who ever hears, or\r\nknows, of any thing but an American ship, or of any American enterprise\r\nof a commercial character that does not bear the impression of the\r\nAmerican Union with it?\r\n\r\nIt would be a presumption of which I cannot be guilty, Gentlemen, for me\r\nto imagine for a moment, that, among the gifts which New England has\r\nmade to our common country, I am any thing more than one of the most\r\ninconsiderable. I readily bring to mind the great men, not only with\r\nwhom I have met, but those of the generation before me, who now sleep\r\nwith their fathers, distinguished in the Revolution, distinguished in\r\nthe formation of the Constitution and in the early administration of the\r\ngovernment, always and everywhere distinguished; and I shrink in just\r\nand conscious humiliation before their established character and\r\nestablished renown; and all that I venture to say, and all that I\r\nventure to hope may be thought true, in the sentiment proposed, is,\r\nthat, so far as mind and purpose, so far as intention and will, are\r\nconcerned, I may be found among those who are capable of embracing the\r\nwhole country of which they are members in a proper, comprehensive, and\r\npatriotic regard. We all know that the objects which are nearest are the\r\nobjects which are dearest; family affections, neighborhood affections,\r\nsocial relations, these in truth are nearest and dearest to us all; but\r\nwhosoever shall be able rightly to adjust the graduation of his\r\naffections, and to love his friends and his neighbors, and his country,\r\nas he ought to love them, merits the commendation pronounced by the\r\nphilosophic poet upon him\r\n\r\n     \"Qui didicit patriae quid debeat, et quid amicis.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it has been my fortune, in the little part which I have acted\r\nin public life, for good or for evil to the community, to be connected\r\nentirely with that government which, within the limits of constitutional\r\npower, exercises jurisdiction over all the States and all the people. My\r\nfriend at the end of the table on my left has spoken pleasantly to us\r\nto-night of the reputed miracles of tutelar saints. In a sober sense, in\r\na sense of deep conviction, I say that the emergence of this country\r\nfrom British domination, and its union under its present form of\r\ngovernment beneath the general Constitution of the country, if not a\r\nmiracle, is, I do not say the most, but one of the most fortunate, the\r\nmost admirable, the most auspicious occurrences, which have ever fallen\r\nto the lot of man. Circumstances have wrought out for us a state of\r\nthings which, in other times and other regions, philosophy has dreamed\r\nof, and theory has proposed, and speculation has suggested, but which\r\nman has never been able to accomplish. I mean the government of a great\r\nnation over a vastly extended portion of the surface of the earth, _by\r\nmeans of local institutions for local purposes, and general institutions\r\nfor general purposes_. I know of nothing in the history of the world,\r\nnotwithstanding the great league of Grecian states, notwithstanding the\r\nsuccess of the Roman system, (and certainly there is no exception to the\r\nremark in modern history,)--I know of nothing so suitable on the whole\r\nfor the great interests of a great people spread over a large portion of\r\nthe globe, as the provision of local legislation for local and municipal\r\npurposes, with, not a confederacy, nor a loose binding together of\r\nseparate parts, but a limited, positive general government for positive\r\ngeneral purposes, over the whole. We may derive eminent proofs of this\r\ntruth from the past and the present. What see we to-day in the\r\nagitations on the other side of the Atlantic? I speak of them, of\r\ncourse, without expressing any opinion on questions of politics in a\r\nforeign country; but I speak of them as an occurrence which shows the\r\ngreat expediency, the utility, I may say the necessity, of local\r\nlegislation. If, in a country on the other side of the water (Ireland),\r\nthere be some who desire a severance of one part of the empire from\r\nanother, under a proposition of repeal, there are others who propose a\r\ncontinuance of the existing relation under a federative system: and\r\nwhat is this? No more, and no less, than an approximation to that system\r\nunder which we live, which for local, municipal purposes shall have a\r\nlocal legislature, and for general purposes a general legislature.\r\n\r\nThis becomes the more important when we consider that the United States\r\nstretch over so many degrees of latitude,--that they embrace such a\r\nvariety of climate,--that various conditions and relations of society\r\nnaturally call for different laws and regulations. Let me ask whether\r\nthe legislature of New York could wisely pass laws for the government of\r\nLouisiana, or whether the legislature of Louisiana could wisely pass\r\nlaws for Pennsylvania or New York? Everybody will say, \"No.\" And yet the\r\ninterests of New York and Pennsylvania and Louisiana, in whatever\r\nconcerns their relations between themselves and their general relations\r\nwith all the states of the world, are found to be perfectly well\r\nprovided for, and adjusted with perfect congruity, by committing these\r\ngeneral interests to one common government, the result of popular\r\ngeneral elections among them all.\r\n\r\nI confess, Gentlemen, that having been, as I have said, in my humble\r\ncareer in public life, employed in that portion of the public service\r\nwhich is connected with the general government, I have contemplated, as\r\nthe great object of every proceeding, not only the particular benefit of\r\nthe moment, or the exigency of the occasion, but the preservation of\r\nthis system; for I do consider it so much the result of circumstances,\r\nand that so much of it is due to fortunate concurrence, as well as to\r\nthe sagacity of the great men acting upon those occasions,--that it is\r\nan experiment of such remarkable and renowned success,--that he is a\r\nfool or a madman who would wish to try that experiment a second time. I\r\nsee to-day, and we all see, that the descendants of the Puritans who\r\nlanded upon the Rock of Plymouth; the followers of Raleigh, who settled\r\nVirginia and North Carolina; he who lives where the truncheon of empire,\r\nso to speak, was borne by Smith; the inhabitants of Georgia; he who\r\nsettled under the auspices of France at the mouth of the Mississippi;\r\nthe Swede on the Delaware, the Quaker of Pennsylvania,--all find, at\r\nthis day, their common interest, their common protection, their common\r\n_glory_, under the united government, which leaves them all,\r\nnevertheless, in the administration of their own municipal and local\r\naffairs, to be Frenchmen, or Swedes, or Quakers, or whatever they\r\nchoose. And when one considers that this system of government, I will\r\nnot say has produced, because God and nature and circumstances have had\r\nan agency in it,--but when it is considered that this system has not\r\nprevented, but has rather encouraged, the growth of the people of this\r\ncountry from three millions, on the glorious 4th of July, 1776, to\r\nseventeen millions now, who is there that will say, upon this\r\nhemisphere,--nay, who is there that will stand up in any hemisphere, who\r\nis there in any part of the world, that will say that the great\r\nexperiment of a united republic has _failed_ in America? And yet I know,\r\nGentlemen, I feel, that this united system is held together by strong\r\ntendencies to union, at the same time that it is kept from too much\r\nleaning toward consolidation by a strong tendency in the several States\r\nto support each its own power and consideration. In the physical world\r\nit is said, that\r\n\r\n     \"All nature's difference keeps all nature's peace,\"\r\n\r\nand there is in the political world this same harmonious difference,\r\nthis regular play of the positive and negative powers, (if I may so\r\nsay,) which, at least for one glorious half-century, has kept us as we\r\nhave been kept, and made us what we are.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, I must not allow myself to pursue this topic. It is a\r\nsentiment so commonly repeated by me upon all public occasions, and upon\r\nall private occasions, and everywhere, that I forbear to dwell upon it\r\nnow. It is the union of these States, it is the system of government\r\nunder which we live, beneath the Constitution of the United States,\r\nhappily framed, wisely adopted, successfully administered for fifty\r\nyears,--it is mainly this, I say, that gives us power at home and credit\r\nabroad. And, for one, I never stop to consider the power or wealth or\r\ngreatness of a State. I tell you, Mr. Chairman, I care nothing for your\r\nEmpire State as such. Delaware and Rhode Island are as high in my regard\r\nas New York. In population, in power, in the government over us, you\r\nhave a greater share. You would have the same share if you were divided\r\ninto forty States. It is not, therefore, as a State sovereignty, it is\r\nonly because New York is a vast portion of the whole American people,\r\nthat I regard this State, as I always shall regard her, as respectable\r\nand honorable. But among State sovereignties there is no preference;\r\nthere is nothing high and nothing low; every State is independent and\r\nevery State is equal. If we depart from this great principle, then are\r\nwe no longer one people; but we are thrown back again upon the\r\nConfederation, and upon that state of things in which the inequality of\r\nthe States produced all the evils which befell us in times past, and a\r\nthousand ill-adjusted and jarring interests.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I wish, then, without pursuing these thoughts, without\r\nespecially attempting to produce any fervid impression by dwelling upon\r\nthem, to take this occasion to answer my friend who has proposed the\r\nsentiment, and to respond to it by saying, that whoever would serve his\r\ncountry in this our day, with whatever degree of talent, great or small,\r\nit may have pleased the Almighty Power to give him, he cannot serve it,\r\nhe will not serve it, unless he be able, at least, to extend his\r\npolitical designs, purposes, and objects, till they shall comprehend the\r\nwhole country of which he is a servant.\r\n\r\nSir, I must say a word in connection with that event which we have\r\nassembled to commemorate. It has seemed fit to the dwellers in New York,\r\nNew-Englanders by birth or descent, to form this society. They have\r\nformed it for the relief of the poor and distressed, and for the purpose\r\nof commemorating annually the great event of the settlement of the\r\ncountry from which they spring. It would be great presumption in me to\r\ngo back to the scene of that settlement, or to attempt to exhibit it in\r\nany colors, after the exhibition made to-day; yet it is an event that in\r\nall time since, and in all time to come, and more in times to come than\r\nin times past, must stand out in great and striking characteristics to\r\nthe admiration of the world. The sun's return to his winter solstice, in\r\n1620, is the epoch from which he dates his first acquaintance with the\r\nsmall people, now one of the happiest, and destined to be one of the\r\ngreatest, that his rays fall upon; and his annual visitation, from that\r\nday to this, to our frozen region, has enabled him to see that progress,\r\n_progress_, was the characteristic of that small people. He has seen\r\nthem from a handful, that one of his beams coming through a key-hole\r\nmight illuminate, spread over a hemisphere which he cannot enlighten\r\nunder the slightest eclipse. Nor, though this globe should revolve round\r\nhim for tens of hundreds of thousands of years, will he see such another\r\nincipient colonization upon any part of this attendant upon his mighty\r\norb. What else he may see in those other planets which revolve around\r\nhim we cannot tell, at least until we have tried the fifty-foot\r\ntelescope which Lord Rosse is preparing for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThere is not, Gentlemen, and we may as well admit it, in any history of\r\nthe past, another epoch from which so many great events have taken a\r\nturn; events which, while important to us, are equally important to the\r\ncountry from whence we came. The settlement of Plymouth--concurring, I\r\nalways wish to be understood, with that of Virginia--was the settlement\r\nof New England by colonies of Old England. Now, Gentlemen, take these\r\ntwo ideas and run out the thoughts suggested by both. What has been, and\r\nwhat is to be, Old England? What has been, what is, and what may be, in\r\nthe providence of God, _New_ England, with her neighbors and associates?\r\nI would not dwell, Gentlemen, with any particular emphasis upon the\r\nsentiment, which I nevertheless entertain, with respect to the great\r\ndiversity in the races of men. I do not know how far in that respect I\r\nmight not encroach on those mysteries of Providence which, while I\r\nadore, I may not comprehend; but it does seem to me to be very\r\nremarkable, that we may go back to the time when New England, or those\r\nwho founded it, were _subtracted_ from Old England; and both Old England\r\nand New England went on, nevertheless, in their mighty career of\r\nprogress and power.\r\n\r\nLet me begin with New England for a moment. What has resulted,\r\nembracing, as I say, the nearly contemporaneous settlement of\r\nVirginia,--what has resulted from the planting upon this continent of\r\ntwo or three slender colonies from the mother country? Gentlemen, the\r\ngreat epitaph commemorative of the character and the worth, the\r\ndiscoveries and glory, of Columbus, was, that he had _given a new world\r\nto the crowns of Castile and Aragon_. Gentlemen, this is a great\r\nmistake. It does not come up at all to the great merits of Columbus. He\r\ngave the territory of the southern hemisphere to the crowns of Castile\r\nand Aragon; but as a place for the plantation of colonies, as a place\r\nfor the habitation of men, as a place to which laws and religion, and\r\nmanners and science, were to be transferred, as a place in which the\r\ncreatures of God should multiply and fill the earth, under friendly\r\nskies and with religious hearts, he gave it to the whole world, he gave\r\nit to universal man! From this seminal principle, and from a handful, a\r\nhundred saints, blessed of God and ever honored of men, landed on the\r\nshores of Plymouth and elsewhere along the coast, united, as I have said\r\nalready more than once, in the process of time, with the settlement at\r\nJamestown, has sprung this great people of which we are a portion.\r\n\r\nI do not reckon myself among quite the oldest of the land, and yet it so\r\nhappens that very recently I recurred to an exulting speech or oration\r\nof my own, in which I spoke of my country as consisting of nine millions\r\nof people. I could hardly persuade myself that within the short time\r\nwhich had elapsed since that epoch our population had doubled; and that\r\nat the present moment there does exist most unquestionably as great a\r\nprobability of its continued progress, in the same ratio, as has ever\r\nexisted in any previous time. I do not know whose imagination is fertile\r\nenough, I do not know whose conjectures, I may almost say, are _wild_\r\nenough to tell what may be the progress of wealth and population in the\r\nUnited States in half a century to come. All we know is, here is a\r\npeople of from seventeen to twenty millions, intelligent, educated,\r\nfreeholders, freemen, republicans, possessed of all the means of modern\r\nimprovement, modern science, arts, literature, with the world before\r\nthem! There is nothing to check them till they touch the shores of the\r\nPacific, and then, they are so much accustomed to water, that _that's_ a\r\nfacility, and no obstruction!\r\n\r\nSo much, Gentlemen, for this branch of the English race; but what has\r\nhappened, meanwhile, to England herself since the period of the\r\ndeparture of the Puritans from the coast of Lincolnshire, from the\r\nEnglish Boston? Gentlemen, in speaking of the progress of English power,\r\nof English dominion and authority, from that period to the present, I\r\nshall be understood, of course, as neither entering into any defence or\r\nany accusation of the policy which has conducted her to her present\r\nstate. As to the justice of her wars, the necessity of her conquests,\r\nthe propriety of those acts by which she has taken possession of so\r\ngreat a portion of the globe, it is not the business of the present\r\noccasion to inquire. _Neque teneo, neque refello._ But I speak of them,\r\nor intend to speak of them, as facts of the most extraordinary\r\ncharacter, unequalled in the history of any nation on the globe, and the\r\nconsequences of which may and must reach through a thousand generations.\r\nThe Puritans left England in the reign of James the First. England\r\nherself had then become somewhat settled and established in the\r\nProtestant faith, and in the quiet enjoyment of property, by the\r\nprevious energetic, long, and prosperous reign of Elizabeth. Her\r\nsuccessor was James the Sixth of Scotland, now become James the First\r\nof England; and here was a union of the crowns, but not of the\r\nkingdoms,--a very important distinction. Ireland was held by a military\r\npower, and one cannot but see that at that day, whatever may be true or\r\nuntrue in more recent periods of her history, Ireland was held by\r\nEngland by the two great potencies, the power of the sword and the power\r\nof confiscation. In other respects, England was nothing like the England\r\nwhich we now behold. Her foreign possessions were quite inconsiderable.\r\nShe had some hold on the West India Islands; she had Acadia, or Nova\r\nScotia, which King James granted, by wholesale, for the endowment of the\r\nknights whom he created by hundreds. And what has been her progress? Did\r\nshe then possess Gibraltar, the key to the Mediterranean? Did she\r\npossess a port in the Mediterranean? Was Malta hers? Were the Ionian\r\nIslands hers? Was the southern extremity of Africa, was the Cape of Good\r\nHope, hers? Were the whole of her vast possessions in India hers? Was\r\nher great Australian empire hers? While that branch of her population\r\nwhich followed the western star, and under its guidance committed itself\r\nto the duty of settling, fertilizing, and peopling an unknown wilderness\r\nin the West, were pursuing their destinies, other causes, providential\r\ndoubtless, were leading English power eastward and southward, in\r\nconsequence and by means of her naval prowess, and the extent of her\r\ncommerce, until in our day we have seen that within the Mediterranean,\r\non the western coast and at the southern extremity of Africa, in Arabia,\r\nin hither India and farther India, she has a population _ten times_ as\r\ngreat as that of the British Isles two centuries ago. And recently, as\r\nwe have witnessed,--I will not say with how much truth and justice,\r\npolicy or impolicy, I do not speak at all to the morality of the action,\r\nI only speak to the _fact_,--she has found admission into China, and has\r\ncarried the Christian religion and the Protestant faith to the doors of\r\nthree hundred millions of people.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that whosoever would see the Eastern world before it\r\nturns into a Western world must make his visit soon, because steamboats\r\nand omnibuses, commerce, and all the arts of Europe, are extending\r\nthemselves from Egypt to Suez, from Suez to the Indian seas, and from\r\nthe Indian seas all over the explored regions of the still farther East.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen. I do not know what practical views or what practical\r\nresults may take place from this great expansion of the power of the two\r\nbranches of Old England. It is not for me to say. I only can see, that\r\non this continent _all_ is to be _Anglo-American_ from Plymouth Rock to\r\nthe Pacific seas, from the north pole to California. That is certain;\r\nand in the Eastern world, I only see that you can hardly place a finger\r\non a map of the world and be an _inch_ from an English settlement.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, if there be any thing in the supremacy of races, the\r\nexperiment now in progress will develop it. If there be any truth in the\r\nidea, that those who issued from the great Caucasian fountain, and\r\nspread over Europe, are to react on India and on Asia, and to act on the\r\nwhole Western world, it may not be for us, nor our children, nor our\r\ngrandchildren, to see it, but it will be for our descendants of some\r\ngeneration to see the extent of that progress and dominion of the\r\nfavored races.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I believe there is no limit fit to be assigned to it by the\r\nhuman mind, because I find at work everywhere, on both sides of the\r\nAtlantic, under various forms and degrees of restriction on the one\r\nhand, and under various degrees of motive and stimulus on the other\r\nhand, in these branches of a common race, the great principle _of the\r\nfreedom of human thought, and the respectability of individual\r\ncharacter_. I find everywhere an elevation of the character of man as\r\nman, an elevation of the individual as a component part of society. I\r\nfind everywhere a rebuke of the idea, that the many are made for the\r\nfew, or that government is any thing but an _agency_ for mankind. And I\r\ncare not beneath what zone, frozen, temperate, or torrid; I care not of\r\nwhat complexion, white or brown; I care not under what circumstances of\r\nclimate or cultivation,--if I can find a race of men on an inhabitable\r\nspot of earth whose general sentiment it is, and whose general feeling\r\nit is, that government is made for man,--man, as a religious, moral, and\r\nsocial being,--and not man for government, there I know that I shall\r\nfind prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I forbear from these remarks. I recur with pleasure to the\r\nsentiment which I expressed at the commencement of my observations. I\r\nrepeat the gratification which I feel at having been referred to on this\r\noccasion by a distinguished member of the mercantile profession; and\r\nwithout detaining you further, I beg to offer as a sentiment,--\r\n\r\n\"_The mercantile interest of the United States_, always and everywhere\r\nfriendly to a united and free government.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Webster sat down amid loud and repeated applause; and\r\n     immediately after, at the request of the President, rose and\r\nsaid:--#/\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have the permission of the President to call your attention\r\nto the circumstance that a distinguished foreigner is at the table\r\nto-night, Mr. Aldham; a gentleman, I am happy to say, of my own\r\nhard-working profession, and a member of the English Parliament from the\r\ngreat city of Leeds. A traveller in the United States, in the most\r\nunostentatious manner, he has done us the honor, at the request of the\r\nSociety, to be present to-night. I rise, Gentlemen, to propose his\r\nhealth. He is of that Old England of which I have been speaking; of that\r\nOld England with whom we had some fifty years ago rather a serious\r\nfamily quarrel,--terminated in a manner, I believe, not particularly\r\ndisadvantageous to either of us. He will find in this, his first visit\r\nto our country, many things to remind him of his own home, and the\r\npursuits in which he is engaged in that home. If he will go into our\r\ncourts of law, he will find those who practise there referring to the\r\nsame books of authority, acknowledging the same principles, discussing\r\nthe same subjects which he left under discussion in Westminster Hall. If\r\nhe go into our public assemblies, he will find the same rules of\r\nprocedure--possibly not always quite as regularly observed--as he left\r\nbehind him in that house of Parliament of which he is a member. At any\r\nrate, he will find us a branch of that great family to which he himself\r\nbelongs, and I doubt not that, in his sojourn among us, in the\r\nacquaintances he may form, the notions he may naturally imbibe, he will\r\ngo home to his own country somewhat better satisfied with what he has\r\nseen and learned on this side of the Atlantic, and somewhat more\r\nconvinced of the great importance to both countries of preserving the\r\npeace that at present subsists between them. I propose to you,\r\nGentlemen, the health of Mr. Aldham.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Aldham rose and said:--\"Mr. President and Gentlemen of the New\r\n     England Society, I little expected to be called on to take a part\r\n     in the proceedings of this evening; but I am very happy in being\r\n     afforded an opportunity of expressing my grateful acknowledgments\r\n     for the very cordial hospitality which you have extended to me, and\r\n     the very agreeable intellectual treat with which I have been\r\n     favored this evening. It was with no little astonishment that I\r\n     listened to the terms in which I was introduced to you by a\r\n     gentleman whom I so much honor (Mr. Webster). The kind and friendly\r\n     terms in which he referred to me were, indeed, quite unmerited by\r\n     their humble object, and nothing, indeed, could have been more\r\n     inappropriate. It is impossible for any stranger to witness such a\r\n     scene as this without the greatest interest. It is the celebration\r\n     of an event which already stands recorded as one of the most\r\n     interesting and momentous occurrences which ever took place in the\r\n     annals of our race. And an Englishman especially cannot but\r\n     experience the deepest emotion as he regards such a scene. Every\r\n     thing which he sees, every emblem employed in this celebration,\r\n     many of the topics introduced, remind him most impressively of that\r\n     community of ancestry which exists between his own countrymen and\r\n     that great race which peoples this continent, and which, in\r\n     enterprise, ingenuity, and commercial activity,--in all the\r\n     elements indeed of a great and prosperous nation,--is certainly\r\n     not exceeded, perhaps not equalled, by any other nation on the face\r\n     of the globe. Gentlemen, I again thank you for the honor you have\r\n     done me, and conclude by expressing the hope that the event may\r\n     continue to be celebrated in the manner which its importance and\r\n     interest merit.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Aldham sat down amid great applause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTIAN MINISTRY AND THE RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION OF THE YOUNG.\r\n\r\nA SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE SUPREME COURT AT WASHINGTON, ON THE 20TH OF\r\nFEBRUARY, 1844, IN THE GIRARD WILL CASE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The heirs at law of the late Stephen Girard, of Philadelphia,\r\ninstituted a suit in October, 1836, in the Circuit Court of the Eastern\r\nDistrict of Pennsylvania, sitting as a court of equity, to try the\r\nquestion of the validity of his will. In April, 1841, the cause came on\r\nfor hearing in the Circuit Court, and was decided in favor of the will.\r\nThe case was carried by appeal to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, at Washington, where it was argued by General Jones and Mr.\r\nWebster for the complainants and appellants, and by Messrs. Binney and\r\nSergeant for the validity of the will.\r\n\r\nThe following speech was made by Mr. Webster in the course of the trial\r\nat Washington. A deep impression was produced upon the public mind by\r\nthose portions of it which enforced the intimate connection of the\r\nChristian ministry with the business of instruction, and the necessity\r\nof founding education on a religious basis.\r\n\r\nThis impression resulted in the following correspondence:--\r\n\r\n\"_Washington, February 13, 1844._\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--Enclosed is a copy of certain proceedings of a meeting held in\r\nreference to your argument in the Supreme Court of the case arising out\r\nof the late Mr. Girard's will.

This has already been repeatedly done\r\nby other counsel, and I shall content myself with stating and\r\nconsidering those parts only which are immediately involved in the\r\ndecision of this cause.\r\n\r\nThe will is drawn with apparent care and method, and is regularly\r\ndivided into clauses. The first nineteen clauses contain various devises\r\nand legacies to relatives, to other private individuals and to public\r\nbodies. By the twentieth clause the whole residue of his estate, real\r\nand personal, is devised and bequeathed to the \"mayor, aldermen, and\r\ncitizens of Philadelphia,\" in trust for the several uses to be after\r\nmentioned and declared.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-first clause contains the devise or bequest to the college,\r\nin these words:--\r\n\r\n     \"And so far as regards the residue of my personal estate in trust,\r\n     as to two millions of dollars, part thereof, to apply and expend so\r\n     much of that sum as may be necessary in erecting, as soon as\r\n     practicably may be, in the centre of my square of ground, between\r\n     High and Chestnut Streets, and Eleventh and Twelfth Streets, in the\r\n     city of Philadelphia, (which square of ground I hereby devote for\r\n     the purpose hereinafter stated, and for no other, for ever,) a\r\n     permanent college, with suitable out-buildings sufficiently\r\n     spacious for the residence and accommodation of at least three\r\n     hundred scholars, and the requisite teachers and other persons\r\n     necessary in such an institution as I direct to be established, and\r\n     in supplying the said college and out-buildings with decent and\r\n     suitable furniture, as well as books, and all things needful to\r\n     carry into effect my general design.\"\r\n\r\nThe testator then proceeds to direct that the college shall be\r\nconstructed of the most durable materials, avoiding needless ornament,\r\nand attending chiefly to the strength, convenience, and neatness of the\r\nwhole; and gives directions, very much in detail, respecting the form of\r\nthe building, and the size and fashion of the rooms. The whole square,\r\nhe directs, shall be enclosed with a solid wall, at least fourteen\r\ninches thick and ten feet high, capped with marble, and guarded with\r\nirons on the top, so as to prevent persons from getting over; and there\r\nare to be two places of entrance into the square, with two gates at\r\neach, one opening inward and the other outward, those opening inward to\r\nbe of iron, and those opening outward to be of wood-work, lined with\r\nsheet-iron.\r\n\r\nThe testator then proceeds to give his directions respecting the\r\ninstitution, laying down his plan and objects in several articles. The\r\nthird article is in these words:--\r\n\r\n     \"3. As many poor white male orphans, between the ages of six and\r\n     ten years, as the said income shall be adequate to maintain, shall\r\n     be introduced into the college as soon as possible; and from time\r\n     to time, as there may be vacancies, or as increased ability from\r\n     income may warrant, others shall be introduced.\"\r\n\r\nThe fifth direction is as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"5. No orphan should be admitted until the guardians, or directors\r\n     of the poor, or a proper guardian or other competent authority,\r\n     shall have given, by indenture, relinquishment, or otherwise,\r\n     adequate power to the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of\r\n     Philadelphia, or to directors or others by them appointed, to\r\n     enforce, in relation to each orphan, every proper restraint, and to\r\n     prevent relations or others from interfering with or withdrawing\r\n     such orphan from the institution.\"\r\n\r\nBy the sixth article, or direction, preference is to be given, first, to\r\norphans born in Philadelphia; second, to those born in other parts of\r\nPennsylvania; third, to those born in the city of New York; and, lastly,\r\nto those born in the city of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nBy the seventh article, it is declared, that the orphans shall be\r\nlodged, fed, and clothed in the college; that they shall be instructed\r\nin the various branches of a sound education, comprehending reading,\r\nwriting, grammar, arithmetic, geography, navigation, surveying,\r\npractical mathematics, astronomy, natural, chemical, and experimental\r\nphilosophy, and the French and Spanish languages, and such other\r\nlearning and science as the capacities of the scholars may merit or\r\nwant. The Greek and Latin languages are not forbidden, but are not\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nBy the ninth article it is declared, that the boys shall remain in the\r\ncollege till they arrive at between fourteen and eighteen years of age,\r\nwhen they shall be bound out by the city government to suitable\r\noccupations, such as agriculture, navigation, and the mechanical trades.\r\n\r\nThe testator proceeds to say, that he necessarily leaves many details to\r\nthe city government; and then adds, \"There are, however, some\r\nrestrictions which I consider it my duty to prescribe, and to be,\r\namongst others, conditions on which my bequest for said college is made,\r\nand to be enjoyed.\"\r\n\r\nThe second of these restrictions is in the following words:--\r\n\r\n     \"Secondly. I enjoin and require _that no ecclesiastic, missionary,\r\n     or minister, of any sect whatever, shall ever hold or exercise any\r\n     station or duty whatever in the said college; nor shall any such\r\n     person ever be admitted for any purpose, or as a visitor, within\r\n     the premises appropriated to the purposes of the said college_.\r\n\r\n     \"In making this restriction, I do not mean to cast any reflection\r\n     upon any sect or person whatsoever; but, as there is such a\r\n     diversity of opinion amongst them, I desire to keep the tender\r\n     minds of the orphans who are to derive advantage from this bequest\r\n     free from the excitement which clashing doctrines and sectarian\r\n     controversy are so apt to produce; my desire is, that all the\r\n     instructors and teachers in the college shall take pains to instil\r\n     into the minds of the scholars _the purest principles of morality_,\r\n     so that on their entrance into active life they may, _from\r\n     inclination_ and habit, evince _benevolence towards their\r\n     fellow-creatures, and a love of truth, sobriety, and industry_,\r\n     adopting at the same time such religious tenets as their _matured\r\n     reason_ may enable them to prefer.\"\r\n\r\nThe testator having, after the date of his will, bought a house in Penn\r\nTownship, with forty-five acres of land, he made a codicil, by which he\r\ndirected the college to be built on this estate, instead of the square\r\nmentioned in the will, and the whole establishment to be made thereon,\r\njust as if he had in his will devoted the estate to that purpose. The\r\ncity government has accordingly been advised that the whole forty-five\r\nacres must be enclosed with the same high wall as was provided in the\r\nwill for the square in the city.\r\n\r\nI have now stated, I believe, all the provisions of the will which are\r\nmaterial to the discussion of that part of the case which respects the\r\ncharacter of the institution.\r\n\r\nThe first question is, whether this devise can be sustained, otherwise\r\nthan as a charity, and by that special aid and assistance by which\r\ncourts of equity support gifts to charitable uses.\r\n\r\nIf the devise be a good limitation at law, if it require no exercise of\r\nthe favor which is bestowed on privileged testaments, then there is\r\nalready an end to the question. But I take it that this point is\r\nconceded. The devise is void, according to the general rules of law, on\r\naccount of the uncertainty in the description of those who are intended\r\nto receive its benefits.\r\n\r\n\"Poor white male orphan children\" is so loose a description, that no one\r\ncan bring himself within the terms of the bequest, so as to say that it\r\nwas made in his favor. No individual can acquire any right or interest;\r\nnobody, therefore, can come forward as a party, in a court of law, to\r\nclaim participation in the gift. The bequest must stand, if it stand at\r\nall, on the peculiar rules which equitable jurisprudence applies to\r\ncharities. This is clear.\r\n\r\nI proceed, therefore, to submit, and most conscientiously to argue, a\r\nquestion, certainly one of the highest which this court has ever been\r\ncalled upon to consider, and one of the highest, and most important, in\r\nmy opinion, ever likely to come before it. That question is, _whether,\r\nin the eye of equitable jurisprudence, this devise be a charity at all_.\r\nI deny that it is so. I maintain, that neither by judicial decisions nor\r\nby correct reasoning on general principles can this devise or bequest be\r\nregarded as a charity. This part of the argument is not affected by the\r\nparticular judicial system of Pennsylvania, or the question of the power\r\nof her courts to uphold and administer charitable gifts. The question\r\nwhich I now propose respects the inherent, essential, and manifest\r\ncharacter of the devise itself. In this respect, I wish to express\r\nmyself clearly, and to be correctly and distinctly understood. What I\r\nhave said I shall stand by, and endeavor to maintain; namely, that in\r\nthe view of a court of equity this devise _is no charity at all_. It is\r\nno charity, because the plan of education proposed by Mr. Girard is\r\nderogatory to the Christian religion; tends to weaken men's reverence\r\nfor that religion, and their conviction of its authority and importance;\r\nand therefore, in its general character, tends to mischievous, and not\r\nto useful ends.\r\n\r\nThe proposed school is to be founded on plain and clear principles, and\r\nfor plain and clear objects, of infidelity. This cannot well be doubted;\r\nand a gift, or devise, for such objects, is not a charity, and as such\r\nentitled to the well-known favor with which charities are received and\r\nupheld by the courts of Christian countries.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the object of this bequest is against the public\r\npolicy of the State of Pennsylvania, in which State Christianity is\r\ndeclared to be the law of the land. For that reason, therefore, as well\r\nas the other, the devise ought not to be allowed to take effect.\r\n\r\nThese are the two propositions which it is my purpose to maintain, on\r\nthis part of the case.\r\n\r\nThis scheme of instruction begins by attempting to attach reproach and\r\nodium to the whole clergy of the country. It places a brand, a stigma,\r\non every individual member of the profession, without an exception. No\r\nminister of the Gospel, of any denomination, is to be allowed to come\r\nwithin the grounds belonging to this school, on any occasion, or for any\r\npurpose whatever. They are all rigorously excluded, as if their mere\r\npresence might cause pestilence. We have heard it said that Mr. Girard,\r\nby this will, distributed his charity without distinction of sect or\r\nparty. However that may be, Sir, he certainly has dealt out opprobrium\r\nto the whole profession of the clergy, without regard to sect or party.\r\n\r\nBy this will, no minister of the Gospel of any sect or denomination\r\nwhatever can be authorized or allowed to hold any office within the\r\ncollege; and not only that, but no minister or clergyman of any sect\r\ncan, for any purpose whatever, enter within the walls that are to\r\nsurround this college. If a clergyman has a sick nephew, or a sick\r\ngrandson, he cannot, upon any pretext, be allowed to visit him within\r\nthe walls of the college. The provision of the will is express and\r\ndecisive. Still less may a clergyman enter to offer consolation to the\r\nsick, or to unite in prayer with the dying.\r\n\r\nNow, I will not arraign Mr. Girard or his motives for this. I will not\r\ninquire into Mr. Girard's opinions upon religion. But I feel bound to\r\nsay, the occasion demands that I should say, that this is the most\r\nopprobrious, the most insulting and unmerited stigma, that ever was\r\ncast, or attempted to be cast, upon the preachers of Christianity, from\r\nnorth to south, from east to west, through the length and breadth of the\r\nland, in the history of the country. When have they deserved it? Where\r\nhave they deserved it? How have they deserved it? They are not to be\r\nallowed even the ordinary rights of hospitality; not even to be\r\npermitted to put their foot over the threshold of this college!\r\n\r\nSir, I take it upon myself to say, that in no country in the world, upon\r\neither continent, can there be found a body of ministers of the Gospel\r\nwho perform so much service to man, in such a full spirit of\r\nself-denial, under so little encouragement from government of any kind,\r\nand under circumstances almost always much straitened and often\r\ndistressed, as the ministers of the Gospel in the United States, of all\r\ndenominations. They form no part of any established order of religion;\r\nthey constitute no hierarchy; they enjoy no peculiar privileges. In some\r\nof the States they are even shut out from all participation in the\r\npolitical rights and privileges enjoyed by their fellow-citizens. They\r\nenjoy no tithes, no public provision of any kind. Except here and there,\r\nin large cities, where a wealthy individual occasionally makes a\r\ndonation for the support of public worship, what have they to depend\r\nupon? They have to depend entirely on the voluntary contributions of\r\nthose who hear them.\r\n\r\nAnd this body of clergymen has shown, to the honor of their own country\r\nand to the astonishment of the hierarchies of the Old World, that it is\r\npracticable in free governments to raise and sustain by voluntary\r\ncontributions alone a body of clergymen, which, for devotedness to their\r\nsacred calling, for purity of life and character, for learning,\r\nintelligence, piety, and that wisdom which cometh from above, is\r\ninferior to none, and superior to most others.\r\n\r\nI hope that our learned men have done something for the honor of our\r\nliterature abroad. I hope that the courts of justice and members of the\r\nbar of this country have done something to elevate the character of the\r\nprofession of the law. I hope that the discussions above (in Congress)\r\nhave done something to meliorate the condition of the human race, to\r\nsecure and extend the great charter of human rights, and to strengthen\r\nand advance the great principles of human liberty. But I contend that no\r\nliterary efforts, no adjudications, no constitutional discussions,\r\nnothing that has been done or said in favor of the great interests of\r\nuniversal man, has done this country more credit, at home and abroad,\r\nthan the establishment of our body of clergymen, their support by\r\nvoluntary contributions, and the general excellence of their character\r\nfor piety and learning.\r\n\r\nThe great truth has thus been proclaimed and proved, a truth which I\r\nbelieve will in time to come shake all the hierarchies of Europe, that\r\nthe voluntary support of such a ministry, under free institutions, is a\r\npracticable idea.\r\n\r\nAnd yet every one of these, the Christian ministers of the United\r\nStates, is by this devise denied the privileges which are at the same\r\ntime open to the vilest of our race; every one is shut out from this, I\r\nhad almost said _sanctum_, but I will not profane that word by such a\r\nuse of it.\r\n\r\nDid a man ever live that had a respect for the Christian religion, and\r\nyet had no regard for _any one_ of its ministers? Did that system of\r\ninstruction ever exist, which denounced the whole body of Christian\r\nteachers, and yet called itself a system of Christianity?\r\n\r\nThe learned counsel on the other side see the weak points of this case.\r\nThey are not blind. They have, with the aid of their great learning,\r\nindustry, and research, gone back to the time of Constantine, they have\r\nsearched the history of the Roman emperors, the Dark Ages, and the\r\nintervening period, down to the settlement of these colonies; they have\r\nexplored every nook and corner of religious and Christian history, to\r\nfind out the various meanings and uses of Christian charity; and yet,\r\nwith all their skill and all their research, they have not been able to\r\ndiscover any thing which has ever been regarded as a Christian charity,\r\nthat sets such an opprobrium upon the forehead of all its ministers. If,\r\nwith all their endeavors, they can find any one thing which has been so\r\nregarded, _they may have their college_, and make the most of it. But\r\nthe thing does not exist; it _never had a being_; history does not\r\nrecord it, common sense revolts at it. It certainly is not necessary for\r\nme to make an ecclesiastical argument in favor of this proposition. The\r\nthing is so plain, that it must instantly commend itself to your honors.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Mr. Girard was charitable. I am not now going to\r\ncontrovert this. I hope he was. I hope he has found his reward. It has\r\nalso been asked, \"Cannot Mr. Girard be allowed to have his own will, to\r\ndevise his property according to his own desire?\" Certainly he can, in\r\nany legal devise, and the law will sustain him therein. But it is not\r\nfor him to overturn the law of the land. The law cannot be altered to\r\nplease Mr. Girard. He found that out, I believe, in two or three\r\ninstances in his lifetime. Nor can the law be altered on account of the\r\nmagnitude and munificence of the bounty. What is the value of that\r\nbounty, however great or munificent, which touches the very foundations\r\nof human society, which touches the very foundations of Christian\r\ncharity, which touches the very foundations of public law, and the\r\nConstitution, and the whole welfare of the state?\r\n\r\nAnd now, let me ask, What is, in contemplation of law, \"a charity\"? The\r\nword has various significations. In the larger and broader sense, it\r\nmeans the kindly exercise of the social affections, all the good\r\nfeelings which man entertains towards man. Charity is love. This is that\r\ncharity of which St. Paul speaks, that charity which covereth the sins\r\nof men, \"that suffereth all things, hopeth all things.\" In a more\r\npopular sense, charity is alms-giving or active benevolence.\r\n\r\nBut the question for your honors to decide here is, What is a charity,\r\nor a charitable use, in contemplation of law? To answer this inquiry, we\r\nare generally referred to the objects enumerated in the 43d of\r\nElizabeth. The objects enumerated in that statute, and others analogous\r\nto them, are charities in the sense of equitable jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that a school of learning is a charity. It is one of\r\nthose mentioned in the statutes. Such a school of learning as was\r\ncontemplated by the statutes of Elizabeth is a charity; and all such\r\nhave borne that name and character to this day. I mean to confine myself\r\nto that description of charity, the statute charity, and to apply it to\r\nthis case alone.\r\n\r\nThe devise before us proposes to establish, as its main object, a school\r\nof learning, a college. There are provisions, of course, for lodging,\r\nclothing, and feeding the pupils, but all this is subsidiary. The great\r\nobject is the instruction of the young; although it proposes to give the\r\nchildren better food and clothes and lodging, and proposes that the\r\nsystem of education shall be somewhat better than that which is usually\r\nprovided for the poor and destitute in our public institutions\r\ngenerally.\r\n\r\nThe main object, then, is to establish a school of learning for\r\nchildren, beginning with them at a very tender age, and retaining them\r\n(namely, from six years to eighteen) till they are on the verge of\r\nmanhood, when they will have expended more than one third part of the\r\naverage duration of human life. For if the college takes them at six,\r\nand keeps them till they are eighteen, a period of twelve years will be\r\npassed within its walls; more than a third part of the average of human\r\nlife. These children, then, are to be taken almost before they learn\r\ntheir alphabet, and be discharged about the time that men enter on the\r\nactive business of life. At six, many do not know their alphabet. John\r\nWesley did not know a letter till after he was six years old, and his\r\nmother then took him on her lap, and taught him his alphabet at a single\r\nlesson. There are many parents who think that any attempt to instil the\r\nrudiments of education into the mind of a child at an earlier age, is\r\nlittle better than labor thrown away.\r\n\r\nThe great object, then, which Mr. Girard seemed to have in view, was to\r\ntake these orphans at this very tender age, and to keep them within his\r\nwalls until they were entering manhood. And this object I pray your\r\nhonors steadily to bear in mind.\r\n\r\nI never, in the whole course of my life, listened to any thing with more\r\nsincere delight, than to the remarks of my learned friend who opened\r\nthis cause, on the nature and character of true charity. I agree with\r\nevery word he said on that subject. I almost envy him his power of\r\nexpressing so happily what his mind conceives so clearly and correctly.\r\nHe is right when he speaks of it as an emanation from the Christian\r\nreligion. He is right when he says that it has its origin in the word of\r\nGod. He is right when he says that it was unknown throughout all the\r\nworld till the first dawn of Christianity. He is right, pre-eminently\r\nright, in all this, as he was pre-eminently happy in his power of\r\nclothing his thoughts and feelings in appropriate forms of speech. And I\r\nmaintain, that, in any institution for the instruction of youth, where\r\nthe authority of God is disowned, and the duties of Christianity derided\r\nand despised, and its ministers shut out from all participation in its\r\nproceedings, there can no more be charity, true charity, found to exist,\r\nthan evil can spring out of the Bible, error out of truth, or hatred and\r\nanimosity come forth from the bosom of perfect love. No, Sir! No, Sir!\r\nIf charity denies its birth and parentage, if it turns infidel to the\r\ngreat doctrines of the Christian religion, if it turns unbeliever, it is\r\nno longer charity! There is no longer charity, either in a Christian\r\nsense or in the sense of jurisprudence; for it separates itself from the\r\nfountain of its own creation.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the history of the Christian religion; there is\r\nnothing in the history of English law, either before or after the\r\nConquest; there can be found no such thing as a school of instruction in\r\na Christian land, from which the Christian religion has been, of intent\r\nand purpose, rigorously and opprobriously excluded, and yet such school\r\nregarded as a charitable trust or foundation. This is the first instance\r\non record. I do not say that there may not be charity schools in which\r\nreligious instruction is not provided. I need not go that length,\r\nalthough I take that to be the rule of the English law. But what I do\r\nsay, and repeat, is, that a school for the instruction of the young,\r\nwhich sedulously and reproachfully excludes Christian knowledge, is no\r\ncharity, either on principle or authority, and is not, therefore,\r\nentitled to the character of a charity in a court of equity. I have\r\nconsidered this proposition, and am ready to stand by it.\r\n\r\nI will not say that there may not be a charity for instruction, in which\r\nthere is no positive provision for the Christian religion. But I do say,\r\nand do insist, that there is no such thing in the history of religion,\r\nno such thing in the history of human law, as a charity, a school of\r\ninstruction for children, from which the Christian religion and\r\nChristian teachers are excluded, as unsafe and unworthy intruders. Such\r\na scheme is deprived of that which enters into the very essence of human\r\nbenevolence, when that benevolence contemplates instruction, that is to\r\nsay, religious knowledge, connected with human knowledge. It is this\r\nwhich causes it to be regarded as a charity; and by reason of this it is\r\nentitled to the special favor of the courts of law. This is the vital\r\nquestion which must be decided by this court. It is vital to the\r\nunderstanding of what the law is, it is vital to the validity of this\r\ndevise.\r\n\r\nIf this be true, if there can be no charity in that plan of education\r\nwhich opposes Christianity, then that goes far to decide this case. I\r\ntake it that this court, in looking at this subject, will see the\r\nimportant bearing of this point upon it. The learned counsel said that\r\nthe State of Pennsylvania was not an infidel State. It is true that she\r\nis not an infidel State. She has a Christian origin, a Christian code of\r\nlaws, a system of legislation founded on nothing else, in many of its\r\nimportant bearings upon human society, than the belief of the people of\r\nPennsylvania, their firm and sincere belief, in the divine authority and\r\ngreat importance of the truths of the Christian religion. And she should\r\nthe more carefully seek to preserve them pure.\r\n\r\nNow, let us look at the condition and prospects of these tender\r\nchildren, who are to be submitted to this experiment of instruction\r\nwithout Christianity. In the first place, they are orphans, have no\r\nparents to guide or instruct them in the way in which they should go, no\r\nfather, no religious mother, to lead them to the pure fount of\r\nChristianity; _they are orphans_. If they were only poor, there might be\r\nsomebody bound by ties of human affection to look after their spiritual\r\nwelfare; to see that they imbibed no erroneous opinions on the subject\r\nof religion; that they run into no excessive improprieties of belief as\r\nwell as conduct. The child would have its father or mother to teach it\r\nto lisp the name of its Creator in prayer, or hymn His praise. But in\r\nthis experimental school of instruction, if the orphans have any friends\r\nor connections able to look after their welfare, it shuts them out. It\r\nis made the duty of the governors of the institution, on taking the\r\nchild, so to make out the indentures of apprenticeship as to keep him\r\nfrom any after interference in his welfare on the part of guardians or\r\nrelatives; to keep them from withdrawing him from the school, or\r\ninterfering with his instruction whilst he is in the school, in any\r\nmanner whatever.\r\n\r\nThe school or college is to be surrounded by high walls; there are to be\r\ntwo gates in these walls, and no more; they are to be of iron within,\r\nand iron bound or covered without; thus answering more to the\r\ndescription of a castle than a school-house. The children are to be thus\r\nguarded for twelve years in this, I do not mean to say a prison, nor do\r\nI mean to say that this is exactly close confinement; but it is much\r\ncloser confinement than ordinarily is met with, under the rules of any\r\ninstitution at present, and has a resemblance to the monastic\r\ninstitutions of past ages, rather than to any school for instruction at\r\nthis period, at least in this country.\r\n\r\nAll this is to be within one great enclosure; all that is done for the\r\nbodily or mental welfare of the child is to be done within this great\r\nwall. It has been said that the children could attend public worship\r\nelsewhere. Where is the proof of this? There is no such provision in the\r\ndevise; there is nothing said about it in any part of Mr. Girard's will;\r\nand I shall show presently that any such thing would be just as adverse\r\nto Mr. Girard's whole scheme, as it would be that the doctrines of\r\nChristianity should be preached within the walls of the college.\r\n\r\nThese children, then, are taken before they know the alphabet. They are\r\nkept till the period of early manhood, and then sent out into the world\r\nto enter upon its business and affairs. By this time the character will\r\nhave been stamped. For if there is any truth in the Bible, if there is\r\nany truth in those oracles which soar above all human authority, or if\r\nany thing be established as a general fact, by the experience of\r\nmankind, in this first third of human life the character is formed. And\r\nwhat sort of a character is likely to be made by this process, this\r\nexperimental system of instruction?\r\n\r\nI have read the two provisions of Mr. Girard's will in relation to this\r\nfeature of his school. The first excludes the Christian religion and all\r\nits ministers from its walls. The second explains the whole principles\r\nupon which he purposes to conduct his school. It was to try an\r\nexperiment in education, never before known to the Christian world. It\r\nhad been recommended often enough among those who did not belong to the\r\nChristian world. But it was never known to exist, never adopted by\r\nanybody even professing a connection with Christianity. And I cannot do\r\nbetter, in order to show the tendency and object of this institution,\r\nthan to read from a paper by Bishop White, which has been referred to by\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\nIn order to a right understanding of what was Mr. Girard's real\r\nintention and original design, we have only to read carefully the words\r\nof the clause I have referred to. He enjoins that no ministers of\r\nreligion, of any sects, shall be allowed to enter his college, on any\r\npretence whatever. Now, it is obvious, that by sects he means Christian\r\nsects. Any of the followers of Voltaire or D'Alembert may have\r\nadmission into this school whenever they please, because they are not\r\nusually spoken of as \"sects.\" The doors are to be opened to the opposers\r\nand revilers of Christianity, in every form and shape, and shut to its\r\nsupporters. While the voice of the upholders of Christianity is never to\r\nbe heard within the walls, the voices of those who impugn Christianity\r\nmay be raised high and loud, till they shake the marble roof of the\r\nbuilding. It is no less derogatory thus to exclude the one, and admit\r\nthe other, than it would be to make a positive provision and all the\r\nnecessary arrangements for lectures and lessons and teachers, for all\r\nthe details of the doctrines of infidelity. It is equally derogatory, it\r\nis the same in principle, thus to shut the door to one party, and open\r\nthe door to the other.\r\n\r\nWe must reason as to the probable results of such a system according to\r\nnatural consequences. They say, on the other side, that infidel teachers\r\nwill not be admitted in this school. How do they know that? What is the\r\ninevitable tendency of such an education as is here prescribed? What is\r\nlikely to occur? The court cannot suppose that the trustees will act in\r\nopposition to the directions of the will. If they accept the trust, they\r\nmust fulfil it, and carry out the details of Mr. Girard's plan.\r\n\r\nNow, what is likely to be the effect of this system on the minds of\r\nthese children, thus left solely to its pernicious influence, with no\r\none to care for their spiritual welfare in this world or the next? They\r\nare to be left entirely to the tender mercies of those who will try upon\r\nthem this experiment of moral philosophy or philosophical morality.\r\nMorality without sentiment; benevolence towards man, without a sense of\r\nresponsibility towards God; the duties of this life performed, without\r\nany reference to the life which is to come; this is Mr. Girard's theory\r\nof useful education.\r\n\r\nHalf of these poor children may die before the term of their education\r\nexpires. Still, those who survive must be brought up imbued fully with\r\nthe inevitable tendencies of the system.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that there may be lay preachers among them. Lay\r\npreachers! This is ridiculous enough in a country of Christianity and\r\nreligion. [Here some one handed Mr. Webster a note.] A friend informs me\r\nthat four of the principal religious sects in this country, the\r\nEpiscopalians, Presbyterians, Methodists, and Baptists, allow no lay\r\npreachers; and these four constitute a large majority of the religious\r\nand Christian portion of the people of the United States. And, besides,\r\nlay preaching would be just as adverse to Mr. Girard's original object\r\nand whole plan as professional preaching, _provided it should be\r\nChristianity which should be preached_.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, as plain as language can be made, that he did not intend to\r\nallow the minds of these children to be troubled about religion of any\r\nkind, whilst they were within the college. And why? He himself assigns\r\nthe reason. Because of the difficulty and trouble, he says, that might\r\narise from the multitude of sects, and creeds, and teachers, and the\r\nvarious clashing doctrines and tenets advanced by the different\r\npreachers of Christianity. Therefore his desire as to these orphans is,\r\nthat their minds should be kept free from all bias of any kind in favor\r\nof any description of Christian creed, till they arrived at manhood, and\r\nshould have left the walls of his school.\r\n\r\nNow, are not laymen equally sectarian in their views with clergymen? And\r\nwould it not be just as easy to prevent sectarian doctrines from being\r\npreached by a clergyman, as from being taught by a layman? It is idle,\r\ntherefore, to speak of lay preaching.\r\n\r\n     MR. SERGEANT here rose, and said that they on their side had not\r\n     uttered one word about lay preaching. It was lay teaching they\r\n     spoke of.\r\n\r\nWell, I would just as soon take it that way as the other, _teaching_ as\r\npreaching. Is not the teaching of laymen as sectarian as the preaching\r\nof clergymen? What is the difference between unlettered laymen and\r\nlettered clergymen in this respect? Every one knows that laymen are as\r\nviolent controversialists as clergymen, and the less informed the more\r\nviolent. So this, while it is a little more ridiculous, is equally\r\nobnoxious. According to my experience, a layman is just as likely to\r\nlaunch out into sectarian views, and to advance clashing doctrines and\r\nviolent, bigoted prejudices, as a professional preacher, and even more\r\nso. Every objection to professional religious instruction applies with\r\nstill greater force to lay teaching. As in other cases, so in this, the\r\ngreatest degree of candor is usually found accompanying the greatest\r\ndegree of knowledge. Nothing is more apt to be positive and dogmatical\r\nthan ignorance.\r\n\r\nBut there is no provision in any part of Mr. Girard's will for the\r\nintroduction of any lay teaching on religious matters whatever. The\r\nchildren are to get their religion when they leave his school, and they\r\nare to have nothing to do with religion before they do leave it. They\r\nare then to choose their religious opinions, and not before.\r\n\r\n     MR. BINNEY. \"Choose their tenets\" is the expression.\r\n\r\nTenets are opinions, I believe. The mass of one's religious tenets makes\r\nup one's religion.\r\n\r\nNow, it is evident that Mr. Girard meant to found a school of morals,\r\nwithout any reference to, or connection with, religion. But, after all,\r\nthere is nothing original in this plan of his. It has its origin in a\r\ndeistical source, but not from the highest school of infidelity. Not\r\nfrom Bolingbroke, or Shaftesbury, or Gibbon; not even from Voltaire or\r\nD'Alembert. It is from two persons who were probably known to Mr. Girard\r\nin the early part of his life; it is from Mr. Thomas Paine and Mr.\r\nVolney. Mr. Thomas Paine, in his \"Age of Reason,\" says: \"Let us devise\r\nmeans to establish schools of instruction, that we may banish the\r\nignorance that the ancient _régime_ of kings and priests has spread\r\namong the people. Let us propagate morality, unfettered by\r\nsuperstition.\"\r\n\r\n     MR. BINNEY. What do you get that from?\r\n\r\nThe same place that Mr. Girard got this provision of his will from,\r\nPaine's \"Age of Reason.\" The same phraseology in effect is here. Paine\r\ndisguised his real meaning, it is true. He said: \"Let us devise means to\r\nestablish schools to propagate morality, unfettered by _superstition_.\"\r\nMr. Girard, who had no disguise about him, uses plain language to\r\nexpress the same meaning. In Mr. Girard's view, _religion_ is just that\r\nthing which Mr. Paine calls _superstition_. \"Let us establish schools of\r\nmorality,\" said he, \"unfettered by religious tenets. Let us give these\r\nchildren a system of pure morals before they adopt any religion.\" The\r\nancient _régime_ of which Paine spoke as obnoxious was that of kings and\r\npriests. That was the popular way he had of making any thing obnoxious\r\nthat he wished to destroy. Now, if he had _merely_ wished to get rid of\r\nthe dogmas which he says were established by kings and priests, if he\r\nhad no desire to abolish the Christian religion itself, he could have\r\nthus expressed himself: \"Let us rid ourselves of the errors of kings and\r\npriests, and plant morality on the plain text of the Christian religion,\r\nwith the simplest forms of religious worship.\"\r\n\r\nI do not intend to leave this part of the cause, however, without a\r\nstill more distinct statement of the objections to this scheme of\r\ninstruction. This is due, I think, to the subject and to the occasion;\r\nand I trust I shall not be considered presumptuous, or as trenching upon\r\nthe duties which properly belong to another profession. But I deem it\r\ndue to the cause of Christianity to take up the notions of this scheme\r\nof Mr. Girard, and show how mistaken is the idea of calling it a\r\ncharity. In the first place, then, I say, this scheme is derogatory to\r\nChristianity, because it rejects Christianity from the education of\r\nyouth, by rejecting its teachers, by rejecting the ordinary agencies of\r\ninstilling the Christian religion into the minds of the young. I do not\r\nsay that, in order to make this a charity, there should be a positive\r\nprovision for the teaching of Christianity, although, as I have already\r\nobserved, I take that to be the rule in an English court of equity. But\r\nI need not, in this case, claim the whole benefit of that rule. I say it\r\nis derogatory, because there is a positive rejection of Christianity;\r\nbecause it rejects the ordinary means and agencies of Christianity. He\r\nwho rejects the ordinary means of accomplishing an end, means to defeat\r\nthat end itself, or else he has no meaning. And this is true, although\r\nthe means originally be means of human appointment, and not attaching to\r\nor resting on any higher authority.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the New Testament had contained a set of principles of\r\nmorality and religion, without reference to the means by which those\r\nprinciples were to be established, and if in the course of time a system\r\nof means had sprung up, become identified with the history of the world,\r\nbecome general, sanctioned by continued use and custom, then he who\r\nshould reject those means would design to reject, and would reject, that\r\nmorality and religion themselves.\r\n\r\nThis would be true in a case where the end rested on divine authority,\r\nand human agency devised and used the means. But if the means themselves\r\nbe of divine authority also, then the rejection of them is a direct\r\nrejection of that authority.\r\n\r\nNow, I suppose there is nothing in the New Testament more clearly\r\nestablished by the Author of Christianity, than the appointment of a\r\nChristian ministry. The world was to be evangelized, was to be brought\r\nout of darkness into light, by the influences of the Christian religion,\r\nspread and propagated by the instrumentality of man. A Christian\r\nministry was therefore appointed by the Author of the Christian religion\r\nhimself, and it stands on the same authority as any other part of his\r\nreligion. When the lost sheep of the house of Israel were to be brought\r\nto the knowledge of Christianity, the disciples were commanded to go\r\nforth into all the cities, and to preach \"that the kingdom of heaven is\r\nat hand.\" It was added, that whosoever would not receive them, nor hear\r\ntheir words, it should be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha than for\r\nthem. And after his resurrection, in the appointment of the great\r\nmission to the whole human race, the Author of Christianity commanded\r\nhis disciples that they should \"go into all the world, and preach the\r\nGospel to every creature.\" This was one of his last commands; and one of\r\nhis last promises was the assurance, \"Lo, I am with you alway, even to\r\nthe end of the world!\" I say, therefore, there is nothing set forth more\r\nauthentically in the New Testament than the appointment of a Christian\r\nministry; and he who does not believe this does not and cannot believe\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Christian ministers, in this age of the world, are\r\nselected in different ways and different modes by different sects and\r\ndenominations. But there are, still, ministers of all sects and\r\ndenominations. Why should we shut our eyes to the whole history of\r\nChristianity? Is it not the preaching of ministers of the Gospel that\r\nhas evangelized the more civilized part of the world? Why do we at this\r\nday enjoy the lights and benefits of Christianity ourselves? Do we not\r\nowe it to the instrumentality of the Christian ministry? The ministers\r\nof Christianity, departing from Asia Minor, traversing Asia, Africa, and\r\nEurope, to Iceland, Greenland, and the poles of the earth, suffering all\r\nthings, enduring all things, hoping all things, raising men everywhere\r\nfrom the ignorance of idol worship to the knowledge of the true God, and\r\neverywhere bringing life and immortality to light through the Gospel,\r\nhave only been acting in obedience to the Divine instruction; they were\r\ncommanded to go forth, and they have gone forth, and they still go\r\nforth. They have sought, and they still seek, to be able to preach the\r\nGospel to every creature under the whole heaven. And where was\r\nChristianity ever received, where were its truths ever poured into the\r\nhuman heart, where did its waters, springing up into everlasting life,\r\never burst forth, except in the track of a Christian ministry? Did we\r\never hear of an instance, does history record an instance, of any part\r\nof the globe Christianized by lay preachers, or \"lay teachers\"? And,\r\ndescending from kingdoms and empires to cities and countries, to\r\nparishes and villages, do we not all know, that wherever Christianity\r\nhas been carried, and wherever it has been taught, by human agency, that\r\nagency was the agency of ministers of the Gospel? It is all idle, and a\r\nmockery, to pretend that any man has respect for the Christian religion\r\nwho yet derides, reproaches, and stigmatizes all its ministers and\r\nteachers. It is all idle, it is a mockery, and an insult to common\r\nsense, to maintain that a school for the instruction of youth, from\r\nwhich Christian instruction by Christian teachers is sedulously and\r\nrigorously shut out, is not deistical and infidel both in its purpose\r\nand in its tendency. I insist, therefore, that this plan of education\r\nis, in this respect, derogatory to Christianity, in opposition to it,\r\nand calculated either to subvert or to supersede it.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, this scheme of education is derogatory to\r\nChristianity, because it proceeds upon the presumption that the\r\nChristian religion is not the only true foundation, or any necessary\r\nfoundation, of morals. The ground taken is, that religion is not\r\nnecessary to morality, that benevolence may be insured by habit, and\r\nthat all the virtues may nourish, and be safely left to the chance of\r\nflourishing, without touching the waters of the living spring of\r\nreligious responsibility. With him who thinks thus, what can be the\r\nvalue of the Christian revelation? So the Christian world has not\r\nthought; for by that Christian world, throughout its broadest extent, it\r\nhas been, and is, held as a fundamental truth, that religion is the only\r\nsolid basis of morals, and that moral instruction not resting on this\r\nbasis is only a building upon sand. And at what age of the Christian era\r\nhave those who professed to teach the Christian religion, or to believe\r\nin its authority and importance, not insisted on the absolute necessity\r\nof inculcating its principles and its precepts upon the minds of the\r\nyoung? In what age, by what sect, where, when, by whom, has religious\r\ntruth been excluded from the education of youth? Nowhere; never.\r\nEverywhere, and at all times, it has been, and is, regarded as\r\nessential. It is of the essence, the vitality, of useful instruction.\r\nFrom all this Mr. Girard dissents. His plan denies the necessity and the\r\npropriety of religious instruction as a part of the education of youth.\r\nHe dissents, not only from all the sentiments of Christian mankind, from\r\nall common conviction, and from the results of all experience, but he\r\ndissents also from still higher authority, the word of God itself. My\r\nlearned friend has referred, with propriety, to one of the commands of\r\nthe Decalogue; but there is another, a first commandment, and that is a\r\nprecept of religion, and it is in subordination to this that the moral\r\nprecepts of the Decalogue are proclaimed. This first great commandment\r\nteaches man that there is one, and only one, great First Cause, one, and\r\nonly one, proper object of human worship. This is the great, the ever\r\nfresh, the overflowing fountain of all revealed truth. Without it, human\r\nlife is a desert, of no known termination on any side, but shut in on\r\nall sides by a dark and impenetrable horizon. Without the light of this\r\ntruth, man knows nothing of his origin, and nothing of his end. And when\r\nthe Decalogue was delivered to the Jews, with this great announcement\r\nand command at its head, what said the inspired lawgiver? that it should\r\nbe kept from children? that it should be reserved as a communication fit\r\nonly for mature age? Far, far otherwise. \"And these words, which I\r\ncommand thee this day, shall be in thy heart. And thou shalt teach them\r\ndiligently unto thy children, and shall talk of them when thou sittest\r\nin thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down,\r\nand when thou risest up.\"\r\n\r\nThere is an authority still more imposing and awful. When little\r\nchildren were brought into the presence of the Son of God, his disciples\r\nproposed to send them away; but he said, \"Suffer little children to come\r\nunto me.\" Unto _me_; he did not send them first for lessons in morals\r\nto the schools of the Pharisees, or to the unbelieving Sadducees, nor to\r\nread the precepts and lessons _phylacteried_ on the garments of the\r\nJewish priesthood; he said nothing of different creeds or clashing\r\ndoctrines; but he opened at once to the youthful mind the everlasting\r\nfountain of living waters, the only source of eternal truths: \"Suffer\r\nlittle children to come _unto me_.\" And that injunction is of perpetual\r\nobligation. It addresses itself to-day with the same earnestness and the\r\nsame authority which attended its first utterance to the Christian\r\nworld. It is of force everywhere, and at all times. It extends to the\r\nends of the earth, it will reach to the end of time, always and\r\neverywhere sounding in the ears of men, with an emphasis which no\r\nrepetition can weaken, and with an authority which nothing can\r\nsupersede: \"Suffer little children to come unto me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd not only my heart and my judgment, my belief and my conscience,\r\ninstruct me that this great precept should be obeyed, but the idea is so\r\nsacred, the solemn thoughts connected with it so crowd upon me, it is so\r\nutterly at variance with this system of philosophical _morality_ which\r\nwe have heard advocated, that I stand and speak here in fear of being\r\ninfluenced by my feelings to exceed the proper line of my professional\r\nduty. Go thy way at this time, is the language of philosophical\r\nmorality, and I will send for thee at a more convenient season. This is\r\nthe language of Mr. Girard in his will. In this there is neither\r\nreligion nor reason.\r\n\r\nThe earliest and the most urgent intellectual want of human nature is\r\nthe knowledge of its origin, its duty, and its destiny. \"Whence am I,\r\nwhat am I, and what is before me?\" This is the cry of the human soul, so\r\nsoon as it raises its contemplation above visible, material things.\r\n\r\nWhen an intellectual being finds himself on this earth, as soon as the\r\nfaculties of reason operate, one of the first inquiries of his mind is,\r\n\"Shall I be here always?\" \"Shall I live here for ever?\" And reasoning\r\nfrom what he sees daily occurring to others, he learns to a certainty\r\nthat his state of being must one day be changed. I do not mean to deny,\r\nthat it may be true that he is created with this consciousness; but\r\nwhether it be consciousness, or the result of his reasoning faculties,\r\nman soon learns that he must die. And of all sentient beings, he alone,\r\nso far as we can judge, attains to this knowledge. His Maker has made\r\nhim capable of learning this. Before he knows his origin and destiny, he\r\nknows that he is to die. Then comes that most urgent and solemn demand\r\nfor light that ever proceeded, or can proceed, from the profound and\r\nanxious broodings of the human soul. It is stated, with wonderful force\r\nand beauty, in that incomparable composition, the book of Job: \"For\r\nthere is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again,\r\nand that the tender branch thereof will not cease; that, through the\r\nscent of water, it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. _But\r\nif a man die, shall he live again?_\" And that question nothing but God,\r\nand the religion of God, can solve. Religion does solve it, and teaches\r\nevery man that he is to live again, and that the duties of this life\r\nhave reference to the life which is to come. And hence, since the\r\nintroduction of Christianity, it has been the duty, as it has been the\r\neffort, of the great and the good, to sanctify human knowledge, to bring\r\nit to the fount, and to baptize learning into Christianity; to gather up\r\nall its productions, its earliest and its latest, its blossoms and its\r\nfruits, and lay them all upon the altar of religion and virtue.\r\n\r\nAnother important point involved in this question is, What becomes of\r\nthe Christian Sabbath, in a school thus established? I do not mean to\r\nsay that this stands exactly on the same authority as the Christian\r\nreligion, but I mean to say that the observance of the Sabbath is a part\r\nof Christianity in all its forms. All Christians admit the observance of\r\nthe Sabbath. All admit that there is a Lord's day, although there may be\r\na difference in the belief as to which is the right day to be observed.\r\nNow, I say that in this institution, under Mr. Girard's scheme, the\r\nordinary observance of the Sabbath could not take place, because the\r\nordinary means of observing it are excluded. I know that I shall be told\r\nhere, also, that lay teachers would come in again; and I say again, in\r\nreply, that, where the ordinary means of attaining an end are excluded,\r\nthe intention is to exclude the end itself. There can be no Sabbath in\r\nthis college, there can be no religious observance of the Lord's day;\r\nfor there are no means for attaining that end. It will be said, that the\r\nchildren would be permitted to go out. There is nothing seen of this\r\npermission in Mr. Girard's will. And I say again, that it would be just\r\nas much opposed to Mr. Girard's whole scheme to allow these children to\r\ngo out and attend places of public worship on the Sabbath day, as it\r\nwould be to have ministers of religion to preach to them within the\r\nwalls; because, if they go out to hear preaching, they will hear just as\r\nmuch about religious controversies, and clashing doctrines, and more,\r\nthan if appointed preachers officiated in the college. His object, as he\r\nstates, was to keep their minds free from all religious doctrines and\r\nsects, and he would just as much defeat his ends by sending them out as\r\nby having religious instruction within. Where, then, are these little\r\nchildren to go? Where can they go to learn the truth, to reverence the\r\nSabbath? They are far from their friends, they have no one to accompany\r\nthem to any place of worship, no one to show them the right from the\r\nwrong course; their minds must be kept clear from all bias on the\r\nsubject, and they are just as far from the ordinary observance of the\r\nSabbath as if there were no Sabbath day at all. And where there is no\r\nobservance of the Christian Sabbath there will of course be no public\r\nworship of God.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject I will observe, that there has been\r\nrecently held a large convention of clergymen and laymen in Columbus,\r\nOhio, to lead the minds of the Christian public to the importance of a\r\nmore particular observance of the Christian Sabbath; and I will read, as\r\npart of my argument, an extract from their address, which bears with\r\npeculiar force upon this case.\r\n\r\n     \"It is alike obvious that the Sabbath exerts its salutary power by\r\n     making the population acquainted with the being, perfections, and\r\n     laws of God; with our relations to him as his creatures, and our\r\n     obligations to him as rational, accountable subjects, and with our\r\n     character as sinners, for whom his mercy has provided a Saviour;\r\n     under whose government we live to be restrained from sin and\r\n     reconciled to God, and fitted by his word and spirit for the\r\n     inheritance above.\"\r\n\r\n     \"It is by the reiterated instruction and impression which the\r\n     Sabbath imparts to the population of a nation, by the moral\r\n     principle which it forms, by the conscience which it maintains, by\r\n     the habits of method, cleanliness, and industry it creates, by the\r\n     rest and renovated vigor it bestows on exhausted human nature, by\r\n     the lengthened life and higher health it affords, by the holiness\r\n     it inspires, and cheering hopes of heaven, and the protection and\r\n     favor of God, which its observance insures, that the Sabbath is\r\n     rendered the moral conservator of nations.\r\n\r\n     \"The omnipresent influence the Sabbath exerts, however, by no\r\n     secret charm or compendious action, upon masses of unthinking\r\n     minds; but by arresting the stream of worldly thoughts, interests,\r\n     and affections, stopping the din of business, unlading the mind of\r\n     its cares and responsibilities, and the body of its burdens, while\r\n     God speaks to men, and they attend, and hear, and fear, and learn\r\n     to do his will.\r\n\r\n     \"You might as well put out the sun, and think to enlighten the\r\n     world with tapers, destroy the attraction of gravity, and think to\r\n     wield the universe by human powers, as to extinguish the moral\r\n     illumination of the Sabbath, and break this glorious main-spring of\r\n     the moral government of God.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I would ask, Would any Christian man consider it desirable for his\r\norphan children, after his death, to find refuge within this asylum,\r\nunder all the circumstances and influences which will necessarily\r\nsurround its inmates? Are there, or will there be, any Christian parents\r\nwho would desire that their children should be placed in this school,\r\nto be for twelve years exposed to the pernicious influences which must\r\nbe brought to bear on their minds? I very much doubt if there is any\r\nChristian father who hears me this day, and I am quite sure that there\r\nis no Christian mother, who, if called upon to lie down on the bed of\r\ndeath, although sure to leave her children as poor as children can be\r\nleft, who would not rather trust them, nevertheless, to the Christian\r\ncharity of the world, however uncertain it has been said to be, than\r\nplace them where their physical wants and comforts would be abundantly\r\nattended to, but away from the solaces and consolations, the hopes and\r\nthe grace, of the Christian religion. She would rather trust them to the\r\nmercy and kindness of that spirit, which, when it has nothing else left,\r\ngives a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple; to that spirit\r\nwhich has its origin in the fountain of all good, and of which we have\r\non record an example the most beautiful, the most touching, the most\r\nintensely affecting, that the world's history contains, I mean the\r\noffering of the poor widow, who threw her two mites into the treasury.\r\n\"And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the\r\ntreasury; and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two\r\nmites. And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath\r\ncast in more than they all; for all these have, of their abundance, cast\r\nin unto the offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the\r\nliving that she had.\" What more tender, more solemnly affecting, more\r\nprofoundly pathetic, than this charity, this offering to God, of a\r\nfarthing! We know nothing of her name, her family, or her tribe. We only\r\nknow that she was a poor woman, and a widow, of whom there is nothing\r\nleft upon record but this sublimely simple story, that, when the rich\r\ncame to cast their proud offerings into the treasury, this poor woman\r\ncame also, and cast in her two mites, which made a farthing! And that\r\nexample, thus made the subject of divine commendation, has been read,\r\nand told, and gone abroad everywhere, and sunk deep into a hundred\r\nmillions of hearts, since the commencement of the Christian era, and has\r\ndone more good than could be accomplished by a thousand marble palaces,\r\nbecause it was charity mingled with true benevolence, given in the fear,\r\nthe love, the service, and honor of God; because it was charity, that\r\nhad its origin in religious feeling; because it was a gift to the honor\r\nof God!\r\n\r\nCases have come before the courts, of bequests, in last wills, made or\r\ngiven to God, without any more specific direction; and these bequests\r\nhave been regarded as creating charitable uses. But can that be truly\r\ncalled a charity which flies in the face of all the laws of God and all\r\nthe usages of Christian man? I arraign no man for mixing up a love of\r\ndistinction and notoriety with his charities. I blame not Mr. Girard\r\nbecause he desired to raise a splendid marble palace in the neighborhood\r\nof a beautiful city, that should endure for ages, and transmit his name\r\nand fame to posterity. But his school of learning is not to be valued,\r\nbecause it has not the chastening influences of true religion; because\r\nit has no fragrance of the spirit of Christianity. It is not a charity,\r\nfor it has not that which gives to a charity for education its chief\r\nvalue. It will, therefore, soothe the heart of no Christian parent,\r\ndying in poverty and distress, that those who owe to him their being may\r\nbe led, and fed, and clothed by Mr. Girard's bounty, at the expense of\r\nbeing excluded from all the means of religious instruction afforded to\r\nother children, and shut up through the most interesting period of their\r\nlives in a seminary without religion, and with moral sentiments as cold\r\nas its own marble walls.\r\n\r\nI now come to the consideration of the second part of this clause in the\r\nwill, that is to say, the reasons assigned by Mr. Girard for making\r\nthese restrictions with regard to the ministers of religion; and I say\r\nthat these are much more derogatory to Christianity than the main\r\nprovision itself, excluding them. He says that there are such a\r\nmultitude of sects and such diversity of opinion, that he will exclude\r\nall religion and all its ministers, in order to keep the minds of the\r\nchildren free from clashing controversies. Now, does not this tend to\r\nsubvert all belief in the utility of teaching the Christian religion to\r\nyouth at all? Certainly, it is a broad and bold denial of such utility.\r\nTo say that the evil resulting to youth from the differences of sects\r\nand creeds overbalances all the benefits which the best education can\r\ngive them, what is this but to say that the branches of the tree of\r\nreligious knowledge are so twisted, and twined, and commingled, and all\r\nrun so much into and over each other, that there is therefore no remedy\r\nbut to lay the axe at the root of the tree itself? It means that, and\r\nnothing less! Now, if there be any thing more derogatory to the\r\nChristian religion than this, I should like to know what it is. In all\r\nthis we see the attack upon religion itself, made on its ministers, its\r\ninstitutions, and its diversities. And that is the objection urged by\r\nall the lower and more vulgar schools of infidelity throughout the\r\nworld. In all these schools, called schools of Rationalism in Germany,\r\nSocialism in England, and by various other names in various countries\r\nwhich they infest, this is the universal cant. The first step of all\r\nthese philosophical moralists and regenerators of the human race is to\r\nattack the agency through which religion and Christianity are\r\nadministered to man. But in this there is nothing new or original. We\r\nfind the same mode of attack and remark in Paine's \"Age of Reason.\" At\r\npage 336 he says: \"The Bramin, the follower of Zoroaster, the Jew, the\r\nMahometan, the Church of Rome, the Greek Church, the Protestant Church,\r\nsplit into several hundred contradictory sectaries, preaching, in some\r\ninstances, damnation against each other, all cry out, 'Our holy\r\nreligion!'\"\r\n\r\nWe find the same view in Volney's \"Ruins of Empires.\" Mr. Volney arrays\r\nin a sort of semicircle the different and conflicting religions of the\r\nworld. \"And first,\" says he, \"surrounded by a group in various fantastic\r\ndresses, that confused mixture of violet, red, white, black, and\r\nspeckled garments, with heads shaved, with tonsures, or with short\r\nhairs, with red hats, square bonnets, pointed mitres, or long beards, is\r\nthe standard of the Roman Pontiff. On his right you see the Greek\r\nPontiff, and on the left are the standards of two recent chiefs (Luther\r\nand Calvin), who, shaking off a yoke that had become tyrannical, had\r\nraised altar against altar in their reform, and wrested half of Europe\r\nfrom the Pope. Behind these are the subaltern sects, subdivided from the\r\nprincipal divisions. The Nestorians, Eutychians, Jacobites, Iconoclasts,\r\nAnabaptists, Presbyterians, Wickliffites, Osiandrians, Manicheans,\r\nPietists, Adamites, the Contemplatives, the Quakers, the Weepers, and a\r\nhundred others, all of distinct parties, persecuting when strong,\r\ntolerant when weak, hating each other in the name of the God of peace,\r\nforming such an exclusive heaven in a religion of universal charity,\r\ndamning each other to pains without end in a future state, and realizing\r\nin this world the imaginary hell of the other.\"\r\n\r\nCan it be doubted for an instant that sentiments like these are\r\nderogatory to the Christian religion? And yet on grounds and reasons\r\n_exactly these_, not _like_ these, but EXACTLY these, Mr. Girard founds\r\nhis excuse for excluding Christianity and its ministers from his school.\r\nHe is a tame copyist, and has only raised marble walls to perpetuate and\r\ndisseminate the principles of Paine and of Volney. It has been said that\r\nMr. Girard was in a difficulty; that he was the judge and disposer of\r\nhis own property. We have nothing to do with his difficulties. It has\r\nbeen said that he must have done as he did do, because there could be no\r\nagreement otherwise. Agreement? among whom? about what? He was at\r\nliberty to do what he pleased with his own. He had to consult no one as\r\nto what he should do in the matter. And if he had wished to establish\r\nsuch a charity as might obtain the especial favor of the courts of law,\r\nhe had only to frame it on principles not hostile to the religion of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBut the learned gentleman went even further than this, and to an extent\r\nthat I regretted; he said that there was as much dispute about the Bible\r\nas about any thing else in the world. No, thank God, that is not the\r\ncase!\r\n\r\n     MR. BINNEY. The disputes about the meaning of words and passages;\r\n     you will admit that?\r\n\r\nWell, there is a dispute about the translation of certain words; but if\r\nthis be true, there is just as much dispute about it out of Mr. Girard's\r\ninstitution as there would be in it. And if this plan is to be advocated\r\nand sustained, why does not every man keep his children from attending\r\nall places of public worship until they are over eighteen years of age?\r\nHe says that a prudent parent keeps his child from the influence of\r\nsectarian doctrines, by which I suppose him to mean those tenets that\r\nare opposed to his own. Well, I do not know but what that plan is as\r\nlikely to make bigots as it is to make any thing else. I grant that the\r\nmind of youth should be kept pliant, and free from all undue and\r\nerroneous influences; that it should have as much play as is consistent\r\nwith prudence; but put it where it can obtain the elementary principles\r\nof religious truth; at any rate, those broad and general precepts and\r\nprinciples which are admitted by all Christians. But here in this scheme\r\nof Mr. Girard, all sects and all creeds are denounced. And would not a\r\nprudent father rather send his child where he could get instruction\r\nunder any form of the Christian religion, than where he could get none\r\nat all? There are many instances of institutions, professing one leading\r\ncreed, educating youths of different sects. The Baptist college in Rhode\r\nIsland receives and educates youths of all religious sects and all\r\nbeliefs. The colleges all over New England differ in certain minor\r\npoints of belief, and yet that is held to be no ground for excluding\r\nyouth with other forms of belief, and other religious views and\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nBut this objection to the multitude and differences of sects is but the\r\nold story, the old infidel argument. It is notorious that there are\r\ncertain great religious truths which are admitted and believed by all\r\nChristians. All believe in the existence of a God. All believe in the\r\nimmortality of the soul. All believe in the responsibility, in another\r\nworld, for our conduct in this. All believe in the divine authority of\r\nthe New Testament. Dr. Paley says that a single word from the New\r\nTestament shuts up the mouth of human questioning, and excludes all\r\nhuman reasoning. And cannot all these great truths be taught to children\r\nwithout their minds being perplexed with clashing doctrines and\r\nsectarian controversies? Most certainly they can.\r\n\r\nAnd, to compare secular with religious matters, what would become of the\r\norganization of society, what would become of man as a social being, in\r\nconnection with the social system, if we applied this mode of reasoning\r\nto him in his social relations? We have a constitutional government,\r\nabout the powers, and limitations, and uses of which there is a vast\r\namount of differences of belief. Your honors have a body of laws, now\r\nbefore you, in relation to which differences of opinion, almost\r\ninnumerable, are daily spread before the courts; in all these we see\r\nclashing doctrines and opinions advanced daily, to as great an extent as\r\nin the religious world.\r\n\r\nApply the reasoning advanced by Mr. Girard to human institutions, and\r\nyou will tear them all up by the root; as you would inevitably tear all\r\ndivine institutions up by the root, if such reasoning is to prevail. At\r\nthe meeting of the first Congress there was a doubt in the minds of many\r\nof the propriety of opening the session with prayer; and the reason\r\nassigned was, as here, the great diversity of opinion and religious\r\nbelief. At length Mr. Samuel Adams, with his gray hairs hanging about\r\nhis shoulders, and with an impressive venerableness now seldom to be met\r\nwith, (I suppose owing to the difference of habits,) rose in that\r\nassembly, and, with the air of a perfect Puritan, said that it did not\r\nbecome men, professing to be Christian men, who had come together for\r\nsolemn deliberation in the hour of their extremity, to say that there\r\nwas so wide a difference in their religious belief, that they could not,\r\nas one man, bow the knee in prayer to the Almighty, whose advice and\r\nassistance they hoped to obtain. Independent as he was, and an enemy to\r\nall prelacy as he was known to be, he moved that the Rev. Mr. Duché, of\r\nthe Episcopal Church, should address the Throne of Grace in prayer. And\r\nJohn Adams, in a letter to his wife, says that he never saw a more\r\nmoving spectacle. Mr. Duché read the Episcopal service of the Church of\r\nEngland, and then, as if moved by the occasion, he broke out into\r\nextemporaneous prayer. And those men, who were then about to resort to\r\nforce to obtain their rights, were moved to tears; and floods of tears,\r\nMr. Adams says, ran down the cheeks of the pacific Quakers who formed\r\npart of that most interesting assembly. Depend upon it, where there is a\r\nspirit of Christianity, there is a spirit which rises above forms, above\r\nceremonies, independent of sect or creed, and the controversies of\r\nclashing doctrines.\r\n\r\nThe consolations of religion can never be administered to any of these\r\nsick and dying children in this college. It is said, indeed, that a\r\npoor, dying child can be carried out beyond the walls of the school. He\r\ncan be carried out to a hostelry, or hovel, and there receive those\r\nrites of the Christian religion which cannot be performed within those\r\nwalls, even in his dying hour! Is not all this shocking? What a\r\nstricture is it upon this whole scheme! What an utter condemnation! A\r\ndying youth cannot receive religious solace within this seminary of\r\nlearning!\r\n\r\nBut, it is asked, what could Mr. Girard have done? He could have done,\r\nas has been done in Lombardy by the Emperor of Austria, as my learned\r\nfriend has informed us, where, on a large scale, the principle is\r\nestablished of teaching the elementary principles of the Christian\r\nreligion, of enforcing human duties by divine obligations, and carefully\r\nabstaining in all cases from interfering with sects or the inculcation\r\nof sectarian doctrines. How have they done in the schools of New\r\nEngland? There, as far as I am acquainted with them, the great elements\r\nof Christian truth are taught in every school. The Scriptures are read,\r\ntheir authority taught and enforced, their evidences explained, and\r\nprayers usually offered.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, that those who really value Christianity, and believe in\r\nits importance, not only to the spiritual welfare of man, but to the\r\nsafety and prosperity of human society, rejoice that in its revelations\r\nand its teachings there is so much which mounts above controversy, and\r\nstands on universal acknowledgment. While many things about it are\r\ndisputed or are dark, they still plainly see its foundation, and its\r\nmain pillars; and they behold in it a sacred structure, rising up to the\r\nheavens. They wish its general principles, and all its great truths, to\r\nbe spread over the whole earth. But those who do not value Christianity,\r\nnor believe in its importance to society or individuals, cavil about\r\nsects and schisms, and ring monotonous changes upon the shallow and so\r\noften refuted objections founded on alleged variety of discordant creeds\r\nand clashing doctrines. I shall close this part of my argument by\r\nreading extracts from an English writer, one of the most profound\r\nthinkers of the age, a friend of reformation in the government and laws,\r\nJohn Foster, the friend and associate of Robert Hall. Looking forward to\r\nthe abolition of the present dynasties of the Old World, and desirous to\r\nsee how the order and welfare of society is to be preserved in the\r\nabsence of present conservative principles, he says:--\r\n\r\n     \"Undoubtedly the zealous friends of popular education account\r\n     knowledge valuable absolutely, as being the apprehension of things\r\n     as they are; a prevention of delusions; and so far a fitness for\r\n     right volitions. But they consider religion (besides being itself\r\n     the primary and infinitely the most important part of knowledge) as\r\n     a principle indispensable for securing the full benefit of all the\r\n     rest. It is desired, and endeavored, that the understandings of\r\n     these opening minds may be taken possession of by just and solemn\r\n     ideas of their relation to the Eternal Almighty Being; that they\r\n     may be taught to apprehend it as an awful reality, that they are\r\n     perpetually under his inspection; and, as a certainty, that they\r\n     must at length appear before him in judgment, and find in another\r\n     life the consequences of what they are in spirit and conduct here.\r\n     It is to be impressed on them, that his will is the supreme law,\r\n     that his declarations are the most momentous truth known on earth,\r\n     and his favor and condemnation the greatest good and evil. Under an\r\n     ascendency of this divine wisdom it is, that their discipline in\r\n     any other knowledge is designed to be conducted; so that nothing in\r\n     the mode of their instruction may have a tendency contrary to it,\r\n     and every thing be taught in a manner recognizing the relation with\r\n     it, as far as shall consist with a natural, unforced way of keeping\r\n     the relation in view. Thus it is sought to be secured, that, as the\r\n     pupil's mind grows stronger, and multiplies its resources, and he\r\n     therefore has necessarily more power and means for what is wrong,\r\n     there may be luminously presented to him, as if celestial eyes\r\n     visibly beamed upon him, the most solemn ideas that can enforce\r\n     what is right.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Such is the discipline meditated for preparing the subordinate\r\n     classes to pursue their individual welfare, and act their part as\r\n     members of the community....\"\r\n\r\n     \"All this is to be taught, in many instances directly, in others by\r\n     reference for confirmation, from the Holy Scriptures, from which\r\n     authority will also be impressed, all the while, the principles of\r\n     religion. And religion, while its grand concern is with the state\r\n     of the soul towards God and eternal interests, yet takes every\r\n     principle and rule of morals under its peremptory sanction; making\r\n     the primary obligation and responsibility be towards God, of every\r\n     thing that is a duty with respect to men. So that, with the\r\n     subjects of this education, the sense of _propriety_ shall be\r\n     _conscience_; the consideration of how they ought to be regulated\r\n     in their conduct as a part of the community shall be the\r\n     recollection that their Master in heaven dictates the laws of that\r\n     conduct, and will judicially hold them amenable for every part of\r\n     it.\"\r\n\r\n     \"And is not a discipline thus addressed to the purpose of fixing\r\n     religious principles in ascendency, as far as that difficult object\r\n     is within the power of discipline, and of infusing a salutary\r\n     tincture of them into whatever else is taught, the right way to\r\n     bring up citizens faithful to all that deserves fidelity in the\r\n     social compact?...\r\n\r\n     \"Lay hold on the myriads of juvenile spirits before they have time\r\n     to grow up through ignorance, into a reckless hostility to social\r\n     order; train them to sense and good morals; inculcate the\r\n     principles of religion, simply and solemnly, as religion, as a\r\n     thing directly of divine dictation, and not as if its authority\r\n     were chiefly in virtue of human institutions; let the higher\r\n     orders, generally, make it evident to the multitude that they are\r\n     desirous to raise them in value, and promote their happiness; and\r\n     then, _whatever_ the demands of the people as a body, thus\r\n     improving in understanding and sense of justice, shall come to be,\r\n     and _whatever_ modification their preponderance may ultimately\r\n     enforce on the great social arrangements, it will be infallibly\r\n     certain that there never _can_ be a love of disorder, an insolent\r\n     anarchy, a prevailing spirit of revenge and devastation. Such a\r\n     conduct of the ascendent ranks would, in this nation at least,\r\n     secure that, as long as the world lasts, there never would be any\r\n     formidable commotion, or violent sudden changes. All those\r\n     modifications of the national economy to which an improving people\r\n     would aspire, and would deserve to obtain, would be gradually\r\n     accomplished, in a manner by which no party would be wronged, and\r\n     all would be the happier.\"[1]\r\n\r\nI not only read this for the excellence of its sentiments and their\r\napplication to the subject, but because they are the results of the\r\nprofound meditations of a man who is dealing with popular ignorance.\r\nDesirous of, and expecting, a great change in the social system of the\r\nOld World, he is anxious to discover that conservative principle by\r\nwhich society can be kept together when crowns and mitres shall have no\r\nmore influence. And he says that the only conservative principle must\r\nbe, and is, RELIGION! the authority of God! his revealed will! and the\r\ninfluence of the teaching of the ministers of Christianity!\r\n\r\n     Mr. Webster here stated that he would, on Monday, bring forward\r\n     certain references and legal points bearing on this view of the\r\n     case.\r\n\r\n     The court then adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND DAY.\r\n\r\n     The seven judges all took their seats at eleven o'clock, and the\r\n     court was opened.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Binney observed to the court, that he had omitted to notice, in\r\n     his argument, that, in regard to the statutes of Uniformity and\r\n     Toleration in England, whilst the Jewish Talmuds for the\r\n     propagation of Judaism alone were not sustained by those statutes,\r\n     yet the Jewish Talmuds for the maintenance of the poor were\r\n     sustained thereby. And the decisions show that, where a gift had\r\n     for its object the maintenance and education of poor Jewish\r\n     children, the statutes sustained the devise. In proof of this he\r\n     quoted 1 Ambler, by Blunt, p. 228, case of De Costa, &c. Also, the\r\n     case of Jacobs v. Gomperte, in the notes. Also, in the notes, 2\r\n     Swanston, p. 487, same case of De Costa, &c. Also, 7 Vesey, p. 423,\r\n     case of Mo Catto v. Lucardo. Also, Sheppard, p. 107, and Boyle, p.\r\n     43.\r\n\r\n     Another case was that of a bequest given to an object abroad, and\r\n     in the decision the Master of the Rolls considered that religious\r\n     instruction was not a necessary part of education. See, also, the\r\n     case of The Attorney-General v. The Dean and Canons of Christ\r\n     Church, Jacobs, p. 485.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Binney then quoted from Noah Webster the definition of the word\r\n     \"tenets,\" to show that Mr. Webster did not give the right\r\n     definition when he said that \"tenets\" meant \"religion.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. Webster then rose and\r\nsaid:--#/\r\n\r\nThe arguments of my learned friend, may it please your honors, in\r\nrelation to the Jewish laws as tolerated by the statutes, go to maintain\r\nmy very proposition; that is, that no school for the instruction of\r\nyouth in any system which is in any way derogatory to the Christian\r\nreligion, or for the teaching of doctrines that are in any way contrary\r\nto the Christian religion, is, or ever was, regarded as a charity by the\r\ncourts. It is true that the statutes of Toleration regarded a devise for\r\nthe maintenance of poor Jewish children, to give them food and raiment\r\nand lodging, as a charity. But a devise for the teaching of the Jewish\r\nreligion to poor children, that should come into the Court of Chancery,\r\nwould not be regarded as a charity, or entitled to any peculiar\r\nprivileges from the court.\r\n\r\nWhen I stated to your honors, in the course of my argument on Saturday,\r\nthat all denominations of Christians had some mode or provision for the\r\nappointment of teachers of Christianity amongst them, I meant to have\r\nsaid something about the Quakers. Although we know that the teachers\r\namong them come into their office in a somewhat peculiar manner, yet\r\nthere are preachers and teachers of Christianity provided in that\r\npeculiar body, notwithstanding its objection to the mode of appointing\r\nteachers and preachers by other Christian sects. The place or character\r\nof a Quaker preacher is an office and appointment as well known as that\r\nof a preacher among any other denomination of Christians.\r\n\r\nI have heretofore argued to show that the Christian religion, its\r\ngeneral principles, must ever be regarded among us as the foundation of\r\ncivil society; and I have thus far confined my remarks to the tendency\r\nand effect of the scheme of Mr. Girard (if carried out) upon the\r\nChristian religion. But I will go farther, and say that this school,\r\nthis scheme or system, in its tendencies and effects, is opposed to all\r\nreligions, of every kind. I will not now enter into a controversy with\r\nmy learned friend about the word \"tenets,\" whether it signify opinions\r\nor dogmas, or whatever you please. Religious tenets, I take it, and I\r\nsuppose it will be generally conceded, mean religious opinions; and if a\r\nyouth has arrived at the age of eighteen, and has no religious tenets,\r\nit is very plain that he has no religion. I do not care whether you call\r\nthem dogmas, tenets, or opinions. If the youth does not entertain\r\ndogmas, tenets, or opinions, or opinions, tenets, or dogmas, on\r\nreligious subjects, then he has no religion at all. And this strikes at\r\na broader principle than when you merely look at this school in its\r\neffect upon Christianity alone. We will suppose the case of a youth of\r\neighteen, who has just left this school, and has gone through an\r\neducation of philosophical morality, precisely in accordance with the\r\nviews and expressed wishes of the donor. He comes then into the world to\r\nchoose his religious tenets. The very next day, perhaps, after leaving\r\nschool, he comes into a court of law to give testimony as a witness.\r\nSir, I protest that by such a system he would be disfranchised. He is\r\nasked, \"What is your religion?\" His reply is, \"O, I have not yet chosen\r\nany; I am going to look round, and see which suits me best.\" He is\r\nasked, \"Are you a Christian?\" He replies, \"That involves religious\r\ntenets, and as yet I have not been allowed to entertain any.\" Again, \"Do\r\nyou believe in a future state of rewards and punishments?\" And he\r\nanswers, \"That involves sectarian controversies, which have carefully\r\nbeen kept from me.\" \"Do you believe in the existence of a God?\" He\r\nanswers, that there are clashing doctrines involved in these things,\r\nwhich he has been taught to have nothing to do with; that the belief in\r\nthe existence of a God, being one of the first questions in religion, he\r\nis shortly about to think of that proposition. Why, Sir, it is vain to\r\ntalk about the destructive tendency of such a system; to argue upon it\r\nis to insult the understanding of every man; _it is mere, sheer, low,\r\nribald, vulgar deism and infidelity_![2] It opposes all that is in\r\nheaven, and all on earth that is worth being on earth. It destroys the\r\nconnecting link between the creature and the Creator; it opposes that\r\ngreat system of universal benevolence and goodness that binds man to his\r\nMaker. _No religion till he is eighteen!_ What would be the condition of\r\nall our families, of all our children, if religious fathers and\r\nreligious mothers were to teach their sons and daughters no religious\r\ntenets till they were eighteen? What would become of their morals, their\r\ncharacter, their purity of heart and life, their hope for time and\r\neternity? What would become of all those thousand ties of sweetness,\r\nbenevolence, love, and Christian feeling, that now render our young men\r\nand young maidens like comely plants growing up by a streamlet's\r\nside,--the graces and the grace of opening manhood, of blossoming\r\nwomanhood? What would become of all that now renders the social circle\r\nlovely and beloved? What would become of society itself? How could it\r\nexist? And is that to be considered a charity which strikes at the root\r\nof all this; which subverts all the excellence and the charms of social\r\nlife; which tends to destroy the very foundation and frame-work of\r\nsociety, both in its practices and in its opinions; which subverts the\r\nwhole decency, the whole morality, as well as the whole Christianity\r\nand government, of society? No, Sir! no, Sir!\r\n\r\nAnd here let me turn to the consideration of the question, What is an\r\noath? I do not mean in the variety of definitions that may be given to\r\nit as it existed and was practised in the time of the Romans, but an\r\noath as it exists at present in our courts of law; as it is founded on a\r\ndegree of consciousness that there is a Power above us that will reward\r\nour virtues and punish our vices. We all know that the doctrine of the\r\nEnglish law is, that in the case of every person who enters court as a\r\nwitness, be he Christian or Hindoo, there must be a firm conviction on\r\nhis mind that falsehood or perjury will be punished, either in this\r\nworld or the next, or he cannot be admitted as a witness. If he has not\r\nthis belief, he is disfranchised. In proof of this, I refer your honors\r\nto the great case of Ormichund against Barker, in Lord Chief Justice\r\nWilles's report. There this doctrine is clearly laid down. But in no\r\ncase is a man allowed to be a witness that has no belief in future\r\nrewards and punishments for virtues or vices, nor ought he to be. We\r\nhold life, liberty, and property in this country upon a system of oaths;\r\noaths founded on a religious belief of some sort. And that system which\r\nwould strike away the great substratum, destroy the safe possession of\r\nlife, liberty, and property, destroy all the institutions of civil\r\nsociety, cannot and will not be considered as entitled to the protection\r\nof a court of equity. It has been said, on the other side, that there\r\nwas no teaching _against_ religion or Christianity in this system. I\r\ndeny it. The whole testament is one bold proclamation against\r\nChristianity and religion of every creed. The children are to be brought\r\nup in the principles declared in that testament. They are to learn to be\r\nsuspicious of Christianity and religion; to keep clear of it, that their\r\nyouthful heart may not become susceptible of the influences of\r\nChristianity or religion in the slightest degree. They are to be told\r\nand taught that religion is not a matter for the heart or conscience,\r\nbut for the decision of the cool judgment of mature years; that at that\r\nperiod when the whole Christian world deem it most desirable to instil\r\nthe chastening influences of Christianity into the tender and\r\ncomparatively pure mind and heart of the child, ere the cares and\r\ncorruptions of the world have reached and seared it,--at that period the\r\nchild in this college is to be carefully excluded therefrom, and to be\r\ntold that its influence is pernicious and dangerous in the extreme. Why,\r\nthe whole system is a constant preaching against Christianity and\r\nagainst religion, and I insist that there is no charity, and can be no\r\ncharity, in that system of instruction from which Christianity is\r\nexcluded. I perfectly agree with what my learned friend says in regard\r\nto the monasteries of the Old World, as seats of learning to which we\r\nare all indebted at the present day. Much of our learning, almost all of\r\nour early histories, and a vast amount of literary treasure, were\r\npreserved therein and emanated therefrom. But we all know, that although\r\nthese were emphatically receptacles for literature of the highest order,\r\nyet they were always connected with Christianity, and were always\r\nregarded and conducted as religious establishments.\r\n\r\nGoing back as far as the statutes of Henry the Fourth, as early as\r\n1402,[3] in the act respecting charities, we find that one hundred years\r\nbefore the Reformation, in Catholic times, in the establishment of every\r\ncharitable institution, there was to be proper provision for religious\r\ninstruction. Again, after the time of the Reformation, when those\r\nmonastic institutions were abolished, in the 1st Edw. VI. ch. 14, we\r\nfind certain _chantries_ abolished, and their funds appropriated to the\r\ninstruction of youth in the grammar schools founded in that reign, which\r\nLord Eldon says extended all over the kingdom. In all these we find\r\nprovision for religious instruction, the dispensation of the same being\r\nby a teacher or preacher. In 2 Swanston, p. 529, the case of the Bedford\r\nCharity, Lord Eldon gives a long opinion, in the course of which he\r\nsays, that in these schools care is taken to educate youth in the\r\nChristian religion, and in all of them the New Testament is taught, both\r\nin Latin and Greek. Here, then, we find that the great and leading\r\nprovision, both before and after the Reformation, was to connect the\r\nknowledge of Christianity with human letters. And it will be always\r\nfound that a school for instruction of youth, to possess the privileges\r\nof a charity, must be provided with religious instruction.\r\n\r\nFor the decision, that the essentials of Christianity are part of the\r\ncommon law of the land, I refer your honors to 1 Vernon, p. 293, where\r\nLord Hale, who cannot be suspected of any bigotry on this subject, says,\r\nthat to decry religion, and call it a cheat, tends to destroy all\r\nreligion; and he also declares Christianity to be part of the common law\r\nof the land. Mr. N. Dane, in his Abridgment, ch. 219, recognizes the\r\nsame principle. In 2 Strange, p. 834, case of The King v. Wilson, the\r\njudges would not suffer it to be debated that writing against religion\r\ngenerally is an offence at common law. They laid stress upon the word\r\n\"generally,\" because there might arise differences of opinion between\r\nreligious writers on points of doctrine, and so forth. So in Taylor's\r\ncase, 3 Merivale, p. 405, by the High Court of Chancery, these doctrines\r\nwere recognized and maintained. The same doctrine is laid down in 2\r\nBurn's Ecclesiastical Law, p. 95, Evans v. The Chamberlain of London;\r\nand in 2 Russell, p. 501, The Attorney-General v. The Earl of Mansfield.\r\n\r\nThere is a case of recent date, which, if the English law is to prevail,\r\nwould seem conclusive as to the character of this devise. It is the case\r\nof The Attorney-General v. Cullum, 1 Younge and Collyer's Reports, p.\r\n411. The case was heard and decided in 1842, by Sir Knight Bruce,\r\nVice-Chancellor. The reporter's abstract, or summary, of the decision is\r\nthis: \"COURTS OF EQUITY, IN THIS COUNTRY, WILL NOT SANCTION ANY SYSTEM\r\nOF EDUCATION IN WHICH RELIGION IS NOT INCLUDED.\"\r\n\r\nThe charity in question in that case was established in the reign of\r\nEdward the Fourth, for the benefit of the community and poor inhabitants\r\nof the town of Bury St. Edmunds. The objects of the charity were\r\nvarious: for relief of prisoners, educating and instructing poor people,\r\nfor food and raiment for the aged and impotent, and others of the same\r\nkind. There were uses, also, now deemed superstitious, such as praying\r\nfor the souls of the dead. In this, and in other respects, the charity\r\nrequired revision, to suit it to the habits and requirements of modern\r\ntimes; and a scheme was accordingly set forth for such revision by the\r\nmaster, under the direction of the court. By this scheme there were to\r\nbe schools, and these schools were to be closed on Sundays, although the\r\nScriptures were to be read daily on other days. This was objected to,\r\nand it was insisted, on the other hand, that the masters and mistresses\r\nof the schools should be members of the Church of England; that they\r\nshould, on every Lord's day, give instruction in the doctrines of the\r\nChurch to those children whose parents might so desire; but that all the\r\nscholars should be required to attend public worship every Lord's day in\r\nthe parish church, _or other place of worship, according to their\r\nrespective creeds_.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-Chancellor said, that the term \"education\" was properly\r\nunderstood, by all the parties, to comprehend religious instruction;\r\nthat the objection to the scheme proposed by the master was not that it\r\ndid not provide for religious instruction according to the doctrines of\r\nthe Church of England, but that it did not provide for religious\r\ninstruction at all. In the course of the hearing, the Vice-Chancellor\r\nsaid, that any scheme of education, without religion, would be worse\r\nthan a mockery. The parties afterwards agreed, that the masters and\r\nmistresses should be members of the Church of England; that every school\r\nday the master should give religious instruction, during one hour, to\r\nall the scholars, _such religious instruction to be confined to the\r\nreading and explanation of the Scriptures_; that on every Lord's day he\r\nshould give instruction in the liturgy, catechism, and articles of the\r\nChurch of England, and that the scholars should attend church every\r\nLord's day, _unless they were children of persons not in communion with\r\nthe Church of England_. In giving the sanction of the court to this\r\narrangement, the Vice-Chancellor said, that he wished to have it\r\ndistinctly understood that the ground on which he had proceeded was not\r\na preference of one form of religion to another, but the necessity, if\r\nthe matter was left to him judicially, to adopt the course of requiring\r\nthe teachers to be members of the Church of England.\r\n\r\nThis case clearly shows, that, at the present day, a school, founded by\r\na charity, for the instruction of children, cannot be sanctioned by the\r\ncourts as a charity, unless the scheme of education includes religious\r\ninstruction. It shows, too, that this general requisition of the law is\r\nindependent of a church establishment, and that it is not religion in\r\nany particular form, but religion, religious and Christian instruction\r\nin some form, which is held to be indispensable. It cannot be doubted\r\nhow a charity for the instruction of children would fare in an English\r\ncourt, the scheme of which should carefully and sedulously exclude all\r\nreligious or Christian instruction, and profess to establish morals on\r\nprinciples no higher than those of enlightened Paganism.\r\n\r\nEnough, then, your honors, has been said on this point; and I am willing\r\nthat inquiry should be prosecuted to any extent of research to\r\ncontrovert this position, that a school of education for the young,\r\nwhich rejects the Christian religion, cannot be sustained as a charity,\r\nso as to entitle it to come before the courts of equity for the\r\nprivileges which they have power to confer on charitable bequests.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Webster then replied to the remarks of Mr. Binney, in relation\r\n     to the Liverpool Blue Coat School, and read from the report of Mr.\r\n     Bache on education in Europe, Mr. Bache having been sent abroad by\r\n     the city of Philadelphia to investigate this whole matter of\r\n     education.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Girard had established such a school as that, it would have been\r\nfree from all those objections that have been raised against it. This\r\nLiverpool Blue Coat School, though too much of a religious party\r\ncharacter, is strictly a church establishment. It is a school\r\nestablished on a peculiar foundation, that of the Madras system of Dr.\r\nBell. It is a monitorial school; those who are advanced in learning are\r\nto teach the others in religion, as well as secular knowledge. It is\r\nstrictly a religious school, and the only objection is, that in its\r\ninstruction it is too much confined to a particular sect.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Binney observed that there was no provision made for clergymen.\r\n\r\nThat is true, because the scheme of the school is monitorial, in which\r\nthe more advanced scholars instruct the others. But religious\r\ninstruction is amply and particularly provided for.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Webster then referred to Shelford, p. 105, and onward, under\r\n     the head \"Jews,\" in the fourth paragraph, where, he stated, the\r\n     whole matter, and all the cases, as regarded the condition and\r\n     position of the Jews respecting various charities, were given in\r\n     full.\r\n\r\n     He then referred to the Smithsonian legacy, which had been\r\n     mentioned, and which he said was no charity at all, nor any thing\r\n     like a charity. It was a gift to Congress, to be disposed of as\r\n     Congress saw fit, for scientific purposes.\r\n\r\n     He then replied, in a few words, to the arguments of Mr. Binney in\r\n     relation to the University of Virginia; and said that, although\r\n     there was no provision for religious instruction in that\r\n     University, yet he supposed it would not be contended for a moment\r\n     that the University of Virginia was a charity, or that it came\r\n     before the courts claiming of the law of that State protection as\r\n     such. It stood on its charter.\r\n\r\nI repeat again, before closing this part of my argument, the\r\nproposition, important as I believe it to be, for your honors'\r\nconsideration, that the proposed school, in its true character, objects,\r\nand tendencies, is derogatory to Christianity and religion. If it be so,\r\nthen I maintain that it cannot be considered a charity, and as such\r\nentitled to the just protection and support of a court of equity. I\r\nconsider this the great question for the consideration of this court. I\r\nmay be excused for pressing it on the attention of your honors. It is\r\none which, in its decision, is to influence the happiness, the temporal\r\nand the eternal welfare, of one hundred millions of human beings, alive\r\nand to be born, in this land. Its decision will give a hue to the\r\napparent character of our institutions; it will be a comment on their\r\nspirit to the whole Christian world. I again press the question to your\r\nhonors: _Is a clear, plain, positive system for the instruction of\r\nchildren, founded on clear and plain objects of infidelity, a charity in\r\nthe eye of the law, and as such entitled to the privileges awarded to\r\ncharities in a court of equity?_ And with this, I leave this part of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall now, may it please your honors, proceed to inquire whether there\r\nis, in the State of Pennsylvania, any settled public policy to which\r\nthis school, as planned by Mr. Girard in his will, is in opposition; for\r\nit follows, that, if there be any settled public policy in the laws of\r\nPennsylvania on this subject, then any school, or scheme, or system,\r\nwhich tends to subvert this public policy, cannot be entitled to the\r\nprotection of a court of equity. It will not be denied that there is a\r\ngeneral public policy in that, as in all States, drawn from its history\r\nand its laws. And it will not be denied that any scheme or school of\r\neducation which directly opposes this is not to be favored by the\r\ncourts. Pennsylvania is a free and independent State. She has a popular\r\ngovernment, a system of trial by jury, of free suffrage, of vote by\r\nballot, of alienability of property. All these form part of the general\r\npublic policy of Pennsylvania. Any man who shall go into that State can\r\nspeak and write as much as he pleases against a popular form of\r\ngovernment, freedom of suffrage, trial by jury, and against any or all\r\nof the institutions just named; he may decry civil liberty, and assert\r\nthe divine right of kings, and still he does nothing criminal; but if,\r\nto give success to such efforts, special power from a court of justice\r\nis required, it will not be granted to him. There is not one of these\r\nfeatures of the general public policy of Pennsylvania against which a\r\nschool might not be established and preachers and teachers employed to\r\nteach. That might in a certain sense be considered a school of\r\neducation, but it would not be a charity. And if Mr. Girard, in his\r\nlifetime, had founded schools and employed teachers to preach and teach\r\nin favor of infidelity, or against popular government, free suffrage,\r\ntrial by jury, or the alienability of property, there was nothing to\r\nstop him or prevent him from so doing. But where any one or all of these\r\ncome to be provided for a school or system as a charity, and come before\r\nthe courts for favor, then in neither one, nor all, nor any, can they be\r\nfavored, because they are opposed to the general public policy and\r\npublic law of the State.\r\n\r\nThese great principles have always been recognized; and they are no more\r\npart and parcel of the public law of Pennsylvania than is the Christian\r\nreligion. We have in the charter of Pennsylvania, as prepared by its\r\ngreat founder, William Penn,--we have in his \"great law,\" as it was\r\ncalled, the declaration, that the preservation of Christianity is one of\r\nthe great and leading ends of government. This is declared in the\r\ncharter of the State. Then the laws of Pennsylvania, the statutes\r\nagainst blasphemy, the violation of the Lord's day, and others to the\r\nsame effect, proceed on this great, broad principle, that the\r\npreservation of Christianity is one of the main ends of government. This\r\nis the general public policy of Pennsylvania. On this head we have the\r\ncase of Updegraph v. The Commonwealth,[4] in which a decision in\r\naccordance with this whole doctrine was given by the Supreme Court of\r\nPennsylvania. The solemn opinion pronounced by that tribunal begins by a\r\ngeneral declaration that Christianity is, and has always been, part of\r\nthe common law of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nI have said, your honors, that our system of oaths in all our courts, by\r\nwhich we hold liberty and property, and all our rights, is founded on or\r\nrests on Christianity and a religious belief. In like manner the\r\naffirmation of Quakers rests on religious scruples drawn from the same\r\nsource, the same feeling of religious responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe courts of Pennsylvania have themselves decided that a charitable\r\nbequest, which counteracts the public policy of the State, cannot be\r\nsustained. This was so ruled in the often cited case of the Methodist\r\nChurch v. Remington. There, the devise was to the Methodist Church\r\ngenerally, extending through the States and into Canada, and the trust\r\nwas declared void on this account alone; namely, that it was\r\ninconsistent with the public policy of the State, inconsistent with the\r\ngeneral spirit of the laws of Pennsylvania. But is there any comparison\r\nto be made between that ground on which a devise to a church is declared\r\nvoid, namely, as inconsistent with the public policy of the State, and\r\nthe case of a devise which undermines and opposes the whole Christian\r\nreligion, and derides all its ministers; the one tending to destroy all\r\nreligion, and the other being merely against the spirit of the\r\nlegislation and laws of the State, and the general public policy of\r\ngovernment, in a very subordinate matter? Can it be shown that this\r\ndevise of a piece of ground to the Methodist Church can be properly set\r\naside, and declared void on general grounds, and not be shown that such\r\na devise as that of Mr. Girard, which tends to overturn as well as\r\noppose the public policy and laws of Pennsylvania, can also be set\r\naside?\r\n\r\nSir, there are many other American cases which I could cite to the court\r\nin support of this point of the case. I will now only refer to 8\r\nJohnson, page 291.\r\n\r\nIt is the same in Pennsylvania as elsewhere, the general principles and\r\npublic policy are sometimes established by constitutional provisions,\r\nsometimes by legislative enactments, sometimes by judicial decisions,\r\nand sometimes by general consent. But however they may be established,\r\nthere is nothing that we look for with more certainty than this general\r\nprinciple, that Christianity is part of the law of the land. This was\r\nthe case among the Puritans of New England, the Episcopalians of the\r\nSouthern States, the Pennsylvania Quakers, the Baptists, the mass of the\r\nfollowers of Whitefield and Wesley, and the Presbyterians; all brought\r\nand all adopted this great truth, and all have sustained it. And where\r\nthere is any religious sentiment amongst men at all, this sentiment\r\nincorporates itself with the law. _Every thing declares it._ The massive\r\ncathedral of the Catholic; the Episcopalian church, with its lofty spire\r\npointing heavenward; the plain temple of the Quaker; the log church of\r\nthe hardy pioneer of the wilderness; the mementos and memorials around\r\nand about us; the consecrated graveyards, their tombstones and epitaphs,\r\ntheir silent vaults, their mouldering contents; all attest it. _The dead\r\nprove it as well as the living._ The generations that are gone before\r\nspeak to it, and pronounce it from the tomb. We feel it. All, all,\r\nproclaim that Christianity, general, tolerant Christianity, Christianity\r\nindependent of sects and parties, that Christianity to which the sword\r\nand the fagot are unknown, general, tolerant Christianity, is the law of\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Webster, having gone over the other points in the case, which\r\n     were of a more technical character, in conclusion,\r\nsaid:--#/\r\n\r\nI now take leave of this cause. I look for no good whatever from the\r\nestablishment of this school, this college, this scheme, this experiment\r\nof an education in \"practical morality,\" unblessed by the influences of\r\nreligion. It sometimes happens to man to attain by accident that which\r\nhe could not achieve by long-continued exercise of industry and ability.\r\nAnd it is said even of the man of genius, that by chance he will\r\nsometimes \"snatch a grace beyond the reach of art.\" And I believe that\r\nmen sometimes do mischief, not only beyond their intent, but beyond the\r\nordinary scope of their talents and ability. In my opinion, if Mr.\r\nGirard had given years to the study of a mode by which he could dispose\r\nof his vast fortune so that no good could arise to the general cause of\r\ncharity, no good to the general cause of learning, no good to human\r\nsociety, and which should be most productive of protracted struggles,\r\ntroubles, and difficulties in the popular counsels of a great city, he\r\ncould not so effectually have attained that result as he has by this\r\ndevise now before the court. It is not the result of good fortunes, but\r\nof bad fortunes, which have overriden and cast down whatever of good\r\nmight have been accomplished by a different disposition. I believe that\r\nthis plan, this scheme, was unblessed in all its purposes, and in all\r\nits original plans. Unwise in all its frame and theory, while it lives\r\nit will lead an annoyed and troubled life, and leave an unblessed memory\r\nwhen it dies. If I could persuade myself that this court would come to\r\nsuch a decision as, in my opinion, the public good and the law require,\r\nand if I could believe that any humble efforts of my own had contributed\r\nin the least to lead to such a result, I should deem it the crowning\r\nmercy of my professional life.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Foster's Essay on the Evils of Popular Ignorance, Section\r\nIV.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The effect of this remark was almost electric, and some one\r\nin the court-room broke out in applause.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: 2 Pickering, p. 433.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: 11 Sergeant & Rawle, p. 394.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. JUSTICE STORY.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[At a meeting of the Suffolk Bar, held in the Circuit Court Room,\r\nBoston, on the morning of the 12th of September, the day of the funeral\r\nof Mr. Justice Story, Chief Justice Shaw having taken the chair and\r\nannounced the object of the meeting, Mr. Webster rose and spoke\r\nsubstantially as follows.]\r\n\r\nYour solemn announcement, Mr. Chief Justice, has confirmed the sad\r\nintelligence which had already reached us, through the public channels\r\nof information, and deeply afflicted us all.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH STORY, one of the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, and for many years the presiding judge of this Circuit,\r\ndied on Wednesday evening last, at his house in Cambridge, wanting only\r\na few days for the completion of the sixty-sixth year of his age.\r\n\r\nThis most mournful and lamentable event has called together the whole\r\nBar of Suffolk, and all connected with the courts of law or the\r\nprofession. It has brought you, Mr. Chief Justice, and your associates\r\nof the Bench of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, into the midst of\r\nus; and you have done us the honor, out of respect to the occasion, to\r\nconsent to preside over us, while we deliberate on what is due, as well\r\nto our own afflicted and smitten feelings, as to the exalted character\r\nand eminent distinction of the deceased judge. The occasion has drawn\r\nfrom his retirement, also, that venerable man, whom we all so much\r\nrespect and honor, (Judge Davis,) who was, for thirty years, the\r\nassociate of the deceased upon the same Bench. It has called hither\r\nanother judicial personage, now in retirement, (Judge Putnam,) but long\r\nan ornament of that Bench of which you are now the head, and whose\r\nmarked good fortune it is to have been the professional teacher of Mr.\r\nJustice Story, and the director of his early studies. He also is present\r\nto whom this blow comes near; I mean, the learned judge (Judge Sprague)\r\nfrom whose side it has struck away a friend and a highly venerated\r\nofficial associate. The members of the Law School at Cambridge, to which\r\nthe deceased was so much attached, and who returned that attachment with\r\nall the ingenuousness and enthusiasm of educated and ardent youthful\r\nminds, are here also, to manifest their sense of their own severe\r\ndeprivation, as well as their admiration of the bright and shining\r\nprofessional example which they have so loved to contemplate,--an\r\nexample, let me say to them, and let me say to all, as a solace in the\r\nmidst of their sorrows, which death hath not touched and which time\r\ncannot obscure.\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, one sentiment pervades us all. It is that of the most\r\nprofound and penetrating grief, mixed, nevertheless, with an assured\r\nconviction, that the great man whom we deplore is yet with us and in the\r\nmidst of us. He hath not wholly died. He lives in the affections of\r\nfriends and kindred, and in the high regard of the community. He lives\r\nin our remembrance of his social virtues, his warm and steady\r\nfriendships, and the vivacity and richness of his conversation. He\r\nlives, and will live still more permanently, by his words of written\r\nwisdom, by the results of his vast researches and attainments, by his\r\nimperishable legal judgments, and by those juridical disquisitions which\r\nhave stamped his name, all over the civilized world, with the character\r\nof a commanding authority. \"Vivit, enim, vivetque semper; atque etiam\r\nlatius in memoria hominum et sermone versabitur, postquam ab oculis\r\nrecessit.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, there are consolations which arise to mitigate our\r\nloss, and shed the influence of resignation over unfeigned and\r\nheart-felt sorrow. We are all penetrated with gratitude to God that the\r\ndeceased lived so long; that he did so much for himself, his friends,\r\nthe country, and the world; that his lamp went out, at last, without\r\nunsteadiness or flickering. He continued to exercise every power of his\r\nmind without dimness or obscuration, and every affection of his heart\r\nwith no abatement of energy or warmth, till death drew an impenetrable\r\nveil between us and him. Indeed, he seems to us now, as in truth he is,\r\nnot extinguished or ceasing to be, but only withdrawn; as the clear sun\r\ngoes down at its setting, not darkened, but only no longer seen.\r\n\r\nThis calamity, Mr. Chief Justice, is not confined to the bar or the\r\ncourts of this Commonwealth. It will be felt by every bar throughout the\r\nland, by every court, and indeed by every intelligent and well-informed\r\nman in or out of the profession. It will be felt still more widely, for\r\nhis reputation had a still wider range. In the High Court of Parliament,\r\nin every tribunal in Westminster Hall, in the judicatories of Paris and\r\nBerlin, of Stockholm and St. Petersburg, in the learned universities of\r\nGermany, Italy, and Spain, by every eminent jurist in the civilized\r\nworld, it will be acknowledged that a great luminary has fallen from the\r\nfirmament of public jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nSir, there is no purer pride of country than that in which we may\r\nindulge when we see America paying back the great debt of civilization,\r\nlearning, and science to Europe. In this high return of light for light\r\nand mind for mind, in this august reckoning and accounting between the\r\nintellects of nations, Joseph Story was destined by Providence to act,\r\nand did act, an important part. Acknowledging, as we all acknowledge,\r\nour obligations to the original sources of English law, as well as of\r\ncivil liberty, we have seen in our generation copious and salutary\r\nstreams turning and running backward, replenishing their original\r\nfountains, and giving a fresher and a brighter green to the fields of\r\nEnglish jurisprudence. By a sort of reversed hereditary transmission,\r\nthe mother, without envy or humiliation, acknowledges that she has\r\nreceived a valuable and cherished inheritance from the daughter. The\r\nprofession in England admits with frankness and candor, and with no\r\nfeeling but that of respect and admiration, that he whose voice we have\r\nso recently heard within these walls, but shall now hear no more, was,\r\nof all men who have yet appeared, most fitted by the comprehensiveness\r\nof his mind, and the vast extent and accuracy of his attainments, to\r\ncompare the codes of nations, to trace their differences to difference\r\nof origin, climate, or religious or political institutions, and to\r\nexhibit, nevertheless, their concurrence in those great principles upon\r\nwhich the system of human civilization rests.\r\n\r\nJustice, Sir, is the great interest of man on earth. It is the ligament\r\nwhich holds civilized beings and civilized nations together. Wherever\r\nher temple stands, and so long as it is duly honored, there is a\r\nfoundation for social security, general happiness, and the improvement\r\nand progress of our race. And whoever labors on this edifice with\r\nusefulness and distinction, whoever clears its foundations, strengthens\r\nits pillars, adorns its entablatures, or contributes to raise its august\r\ndome still higher in the skies, connects himself, in name, and fame, and\r\ncharacter, with that which is and must be as durable as the frame of\r\nhuman society.\r\n\r\nAll know, Mr. Chief Justice, the pure love of country which animated the\r\ndeceased, and the zeal, as well as the talent, with which he explained\r\nand defended her institutions. His work on the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States is one of his most eminently successful labors. But all\r\nhis writings, and all his judgments, all his opinions, and the whole\r\ninfluence of his character, public and private, leaned strongly and\r\nalways to the support of sound principles, to the restraint of illegal\r\npower, and to the discouragement and rebuke of licentious and\r\ndisorganizing sentiments. \"Ad rempublicam firmandam, et ad stabiliendas\r\nvires, et sanandum populum, omnis ejus pergebat institutio.\"\r\n\r\nBut this is not the occasion, Sir, nor is it for me to consider and\r\ndiscuss at length the character and merits of Mr. Justice Story, as a\r\nwriter or a judge. The performance of that duty, with which this Bar\r\nwill no doubt charge itself, must be deferred to another opportunity,\r\nand will be committed to abler hands. But in the homage paid to his\r\nmemory, one part may come with peculiar propriety and emphasis from\r\nourselves. We have known him in private life. We have seen him descend\r\nfrom the bench, and mingle in our friendly circles. We have known his\r\nmanner of life, from his youth up. We can bear witness to the strict\r\nuprightness and purity of his character, his simplicity and\r\nunostentatious habits, the ease and affability of his intercourse, his\r\nremarkable vivacity amidst severe labors, the cheerful and animating\r\ntones of his conversation, and his fast fidelity to friends. Some of us,\r\nalso, can testify to his large and liberal charities, not ostentatious\r\nor casual, but systematic and silent,--dispensed almost without showing\r\nthe hand, and falling and distilling comfort and happiness, like the\r\ndews of heaven. But we can testify, also, that in all his pursuits and\r\nemployments, in all his recreations, in all his commerce with the world,\r\nand in his intercourse with the circle of his friends, the predominance\r\nof his judicial character was manifest. He never forgot the ermine which\r\nhe wore. The judge, the judge, the useful and distinguished judge, was\r\nthe great picture which he kept constantly before his eyes, and to a\r\nresemblance of which all his efforts, all his thoughts, all his life,\r\nwere devoted. We may go the world over, without finding a man who shall\r\npresent a more striking realization of the beautiful conception of\r\nD'Aguesseau: \"C'est en vain que l'on cherche à distinguer en lui la\r\npersonne privée et la personne publique; un même esprit les anime, un\r\nmême objet les réunit; l'homme, le père de famille, le citoyen, tout est\r\nen lui consacré à la gloire du magistrat.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Chief Justice, one may live as a conqueror, a king, or a magistrate;\r\nbut he must die as a man. The bed of death brings every human being to\r\nhis pure individuality; to the intense contemplation of that deepest and\r\nmost solemn of all relations, the relation between the creature and his\r\nCreator. Here it is that fame and renown cannot assist us; that all\r\nexternal things must fail to aid us; that even friends, affection, and\r\nhuman love and devotedness, cannot succor us. This relation, the true\r\nfoundation of all duty, a relation perceived and felt by conscience and\r\nconfirmed by revelation, our illustrious friend, now deceased, always\r\nacknowledged. He reverenced the Scriptures of truth, honored the pure\r\nmorality which they teach, and clung to the hopes of future life which\r\nthey impart. He beheld enough in nature, in himself, and in all that can\r\nbe known of things seen, to feel assured that there is a Supreme Power,\r\nwithout whose providence not a sparrow falleth to the ground. To this\r\ngracious being he trusted himself for time and for eternity; and the\r\nlast words of his lips ever heard by mortal ears were a fervent\r\nsupplication to his Maker to take him to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The following letter of dedication to the mother of Judge\r\nStory accompanied these remarks in the original edition:--\r\n\r\n\"_Boston, September 15, 1845._\r\n\r\n\"VENERABLE MADAM,--I pray you to allow me to present to you the brief\r\nremarks which I made before the Suffolk Bar, on the 12th instant, at a\r\nmeeting occasioned by the sudden and afflicting death of your\r\ndistinguished son.

The first case (that of Martin Luther against\r\nLuther M. Borden and others) came up by writ of error from the Circuit\r\nCourt of Rhode Island, in which the jury, under the rulings of the court\r\n(Mr. Justice Story), found a verdict for the defendants; the second case\r\n(that of Rachel Luther against the same defendants) came up by a\r\ncertificate of a division of opinion. The allegations, evidence, and\r\narguments were the same in both cases.\r\n\r\nThe first case was argued by Mr. Hallet and Mr. Clifford\r\n(Attorney-General) for the plaintiffs in error, and by Mr. Whipple and\r\nMr. Webster for the defendants in error. Mr. Justice Catron, Mr. Justice\r\nDaniel, and Mr. Justice McKinley were absent from the court, in\r\nconsequence of ill health. Chief Justice Taney delivered the opinion of\r\nthe court, affirming the judgment of the court below in the first case,\r\nand dismissing the second for want of jurisdiction. Mr. Justice Woodbury\r\ndissented, and delivered a very elaborate opinion in support of his view\r\nof the subject.]\r\n\r\nThere is something novel and extraordinary in the case now before the\r\ncourt. All will admit that it is not such a one as is usually presented\r\nfor judicial consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is well known, that in the years 1841 and 1842 political agitation\r\nexisted in Rhode Island. Some of the citizens of that State undertook to\r\nform a new constitution of government, beginning their proceedings\r\ntowards that end by meetings of the people, held without authority of\r\nlaw, and conducting those proceedings through such forms as led them, in\r\n1842, to say that they had established a new constitution and form of\r\ngovernment, and placed Mr. Thomas W. Dorr at its head. The previously\r\nexisting, and then existing, government of Rhode Island treated these\r\nproceedings as nugatory, so far as they went to establish a new\r\nconstitution; and criminal, so far as they proposed to confer authority\r\nupon any persons to interfere with the acts of the existing government,\r\nor to exercise powers of legislation, or administration of the laws. All\r\nwill remember that the state of things approached, if not actual\r\nconflict between men in arms, at least the \"perilous edge of battle.\"\r\nArms were resorted to, force was used, and greater force threatened. In\r\nJune, 1842, this agitation subsided. The new government, as it called\r\nitself, disappeared from the scene of action. The former government, the\r\nCharter government, as it was sometimes styled, resumed undisputed\r\ncontrol, went on in its ordinary course, and the peace of the State was\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\nBut the past had been too serious to be forgotten. The legislature of\r\nthe State had, at an early stage of the troubles, found it necessary to\r\npass special laws for the punishment of the persons concerned in these\r\nproceedings. It defined the crime of treason, as well as smaller\r\noffences, and authorized the declaration of martial law. Governor King,\r\nunder this authority, proclaimed the existence of treason and rebellion\r\nin the State, and declared the State under martial law. This having been\r\ndone, and the ephemeral government of Mr. Dorr having disappeared, the\r\ngrand juries of the State found indictments against several persons for\r\nhaving disturbed the peace of the State, and one against Dorr himself\r\nfor treason. This indictment came on in the Supreme Court of Rhode\r\nIsland in 1844, before a tribunal admitted on all hands to be the legal\r\njudicature of the State. He was tried by a jury of Rhode Island, above\r\nall objection, and after all challenge. By that jury, under the\r\ninstructions of the court, he was convicted of treason, and sentenced to\r\nimprisonment for life.\r\n\r\nNow an action is brought in the courts of the United States, and before\r\nyour honors, by appeal, in which it is attempted to prove that the\r\ncharacters of this drama have been oddly and wrongly cast; that there\r\nhas been a great mistake in the courts of Rhode Island. It is alleged,\r\nthat Mr. Dorr, instead of being a traitor or an insurrectionist, was the\r\nreal governor of the State at the time; that the force used by him was\r\nexercised in defence of the constitution and laws, and not against them;\r\nthat he who opposed the constituted authorities was not Mr. Dorr, but\r\nGovernor King; and that it was _he_ who should have been indicted, and\r\ntried, and sentenced. This is rather an important mistake, to be sure,\r\nif it be a mistake. \"Change places,\" cries poor Lear, \"_change places_,\r\nand _handy-dandy_, which is the justice and which the thief?\" So our\r\nlearned opponents say, \"Change places, and, _handy-dandy_, which is the\r\ngovernor and which the rebel?\" The aspect of the case is, as I have\r\nsaid, novel. It may perhaps give vivacity and variety to judicial\r\ninvestigations. It may relieve the drudgery of perusing briefs,\r\ndemurrers, and pleas in bar, bills in equity and answers, and introduce\r\ntopics which give sprightliness, freshness, and something of an uncommon\r\npublic interest to proceedings in courts of law.\r\n\r\nHowever difficult it may be, and I suppose it to be _wholly_ impossible,\r\nthat this court should take judicial cognizance of the questions which\r\nthe plaintiff has presented to the court below, yet I do not think it a\r\nmatter of regret that the cause has come hither. It is said, and truly\r\nsaid, that the case involves the consideration and discussion of what\r\nare the true principles of government in our American system of public\r\nliberty. This is very right. The case does involve these questions, and\r\nharm can never come from their discussion, especially when such\r\ndiscussion is addressed to reason and not to passion; when it is had\r\nbefore magistrates and lawyers, and not before excited masses out of\r\ndoors. I agree entirely that the case does raise considerations,\r\nsomewhat extensive, of the true character of our American system of\r\npopular liberty; and although I am constrained to differ from the\r\nlearned counsel who opened the cause for the plaintiff in error, on the\r\nprinciples and character of that American liberty, and upon the true\r\ncharacteristics of that American system on which changes of the\r\ngovernment and constitution, if they become necessary, are to be made,\r\nyet I agree with him that this case does present them for consideration.\r\n\r\nNow, there are certain principles of public liberty, which, though they\r\ndo not exist in all forms of government, exist, nevertheless, to some\r\nextent, in different forms of government. The protection of life and\r\nproperty, the _habeas corpus_, trial by jury, the right of open trial,\r\nthese are principles of public liberty existing in their best form in\r\nthe republican institutions of this country, but, to the extent\r\nmentioned, existing also in the constitution of England. Our American\r\nliberty, allow me to say, therefore, has an ancestry, a pedigree, a\r\nhistory. Our ancestors brought to this continent all that was valuable,\r\nin their judgment, in the political institutions of England, and left\r\nbehind them all that was without value, or that was objectionable.\r\nDuring the colonial period they were closely connected of course with\r\nthe colonial system; but they were Englishmen, as well as colonists, and\r\ntook an interest in whatever concerned the mother country, especially in\r\nall great questions of public liberty in that country. They accordingly\r\ntook a deep concern in the Revolution of 1688. The American colonists\r\nhad suffered from the tyranny of James the Second. Their charters had\r\nbeen wrested from them by mockeries of law, and by the corruption of\r\njudges in the city of London; and in no part of England was there more\r\ngratification, or a more resolute feeling, when James abdicated and\r\nWilliam came over, than in the American colonies. All know that\r\nMassachusetts immediately overthrew what had been done under the reign\r\nof James, and took possession of the colonial fort in the harbor of\r\nBoston in the name of the new king.\r\n\r\nWhen the United States separated from England, by the Declaration of\r\n1776, they departed from the political maxims and examples of the mother\r\ncountry, and entered upon a course more exclusively American. From that\r\nday down, our institutions and our history relate to ourselves. Through\r\nthe period of the Declaration of Independence, of the Confederation, of\r\nthe Convention, and the adoption of the Constitution, all our public\r\nacts are records out of which a knowledge of our system of American\r\nliberty is to be drawn.\r\n\r\nFrom the Declaration of Independence, the governments of what had been\r\ncolonies before were adapted to their new condition. They no longer owed\r\nallegiance to crowned heads. No tie bound them to England. The whole\r\nsystem became entirely popular, and all legislative and constitutional\r\nprovisions had regard to this new, peculiar, American character, which\r\nthey had assumed. Where the form of government was already well enough,\r\nthey let it alone. Where reform was necessary, they reformed it. What\r\nwas valuable, they retained; what was essential, they added, and no\r\nmore. Through the whole proceeding, from 1776 to the latest period, the\r\nwhole course of American public acts, the whole progress of this\r\nAmerican system, was marked by a peculiar conservatism. The object was\r\nto do what was necessary, and no more; and to do that with the utmost\r\ntemperance and prudence.\r\n\r\nNow, without going into historical details at length, let me state what\r\nI understand the American principles to be, on which this system rests.\r\n\r\nFirst and chief, no man makes a question, that the people are the source\r\nof all political power. Government is instituted for their good, and its\r\nmembers are their agents and servants. He who would argue against this\r\nmust argue without an adversary. And who thinks there is any peculiar\r\nmerit in asserting a doctrine like this, in the midst of twenty millions\r\nof people, when nineteen millions nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand\r\nnine hundred and ninety-nine of them hold it, as well as himself? There\r\nis no other doctrine of government here; and no man imputes to another,\r\nand no man should claim for himself, any peculiar merit for asserting\r\nwhat everybody knows to be true, and nobody denies. Why, where else can\r\nwe look but to the people for political power, in a popular government?\r\nWe have no hereditary executive, no hereditary branch of the\r\nlegislature, no inherited masses of property, no system of entails, no\r\nlong trusts, no long family settlements, no primogeniture. Every estate\r\nin the country, from the richest to the poorest, is divided among sons\r\nand daughters alike. Alienation is made as easy as possible; everywhere\r\nthe transmissibility of property is perfectly free. The whole system is\r\narranged so as to produce, as far as unequal industry and enterprise\r\nrender it possible, a universal equality among men; an equality of\r\nrights absolutely, and an equality of condition, so far as the different\r\ncharacters of individuals will allow such equality to be produced. He\r\nwho considers that there may be, is, or ever has been, since the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, any person who looks to any other source of\r\npower in this country than the people, so as to give peculiar merit to\r\nthose who clamor loudest in its assertion, must be out of his mind, even\r\nmore than Don Quixote. His imagination was only perverted. He saw things\r\nnot as they were, though what he saw were things. He saw windmills, and\r\ntook them to be giants, knights on horseback. This was bad enough; but\r\nwhoever says, or speaks as if he thought, that anybody looks to any\r\nother source of political power in this country than the people, must\r\nhave a stronger and wilder imagination, for he sees nothing but the\r\ncreations of his own fancy. He stares at phantoms.\r\n\r\nWell, then, let all admit, what none deny, that the only source of\r\npolitical power in this country is the people. Let us admit that they\r\nare _sovereign_, for they are so; that is to say, the aggregate\r\ncommunity, the collected will of the people, is sovereign. I confess\r\nthat I think Chief Justice Jay spoke rather paradoxically than\r\nphilosophically, when he said that this country exhibited the\r\nextraordinary spectacle of many sovereigns and no subjects. The people,\r\nhe said, are all sovereigns; and the peculiarity of the case is that\r\nthey have no subjects, except a few colored persons. This must be rather\r\nfanciful. The aggregate community is sovereign, but that is not _the_\r\nsovereignty which acts in the daily exercise of sovereign power. The\r\npeople cannot act daily as the people. They must establish a government,\r\nand invest it with so much of the sovereign power as the case requires;\r\nand this sovereign power being delegated and placed in the hands of the\r\ngovernment, that government becomes what is popularly called THE STATE.\r\nI like the old-fashioned way of stating things as they are; and this is\r\nthe true idea of a state. It is an organized government, representing\r\nthe collected will of the people, as far as they see fit to invest that\r\ngovernment with power. And in that respect it is true, that, though\r\n_this_ government possesses sovereign power, it does not possess _all_\r\nsovereign power; and so the State governments, though sovereign in some\r\nrespects, are not so in all. Nor could it be shown that the powers of\r\nboth, as delegated, embrace the whole range of what might be called\r\nsovereign power. We usually speak of the States as sovereign States. I\r\ndo not object to this. But the Constitution never so styles them, nor\r\ndoes the Constitution speak of the government here as the _general_ or\r\nthe _federal_ government. It calls this government the United States;\r\nand it calls the State governments State governments. Still the fact is\r\nundeniably so; legislation is a sovereign power, and is exercised by the\r\nUnited States government to a certain extent, and also by the States,\r\naccording to the forms which they themselves have established, and\r\nsubject to the provisions of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nWell, then, having agreed that all power is originally from the people,\r\nand that they can confer as much of it as they please, the next\r\nprinciple is, that, as the exercise of legislative power and the other\r\npowers of government immediately by the people themselves is\r\nimpracticable, they must be exercised by REPRESENTATIVES of the people;\r\nand what distinguishes American governments as much as any thing else\r\nfrom any governments of ancient or of modern times, is the marvellous\r\nfelicity of their representative system. It has with us, allow me to\r\nsay, a somewhat different origin from the representation of the commons\r\nin England, though that has been worked up to some resemblance of our\r\nown. The representative system in England had its origin, not in any\r\nsupposed rights of the people themselves, but in the necessities and\r\ncommands of the crown. At first, knights and burgesses were summoned,\r\noften against their will, to a Parliament called by the king. Many\r\nremonstrances were presented against sending up these representatives;\r\nthe charge of paying them was, not unfrequently, felt to be burdensome\r\nby the people. But the king wished their counsel and advice, and perhaps\r\nthe presence of a popular body, to enable him to make greater headway\r\nagainst the feudal barons in the aristocratic and hereditary branch of\r\nthe legislature. In process of time these knights and burgesses assumed\r\nmore and more a popular character, and became, by degrees, the guardians\r\nof popular rights. The people through them obtained protection against\r\nthe encroachments of the crown and the aristocracy, till in our day they\r\nare understood to be the representatives of the people, charged with the\r\nprotection of their rights. With us it was always just so.\r\nRepresentation has always been of this character. The power is with the\r\npeople; but they cannot exercise it in masses or _per capita_; they can\r\nonly exercise it by their representatives. The whole system with us has\r\nbeen popular from the beginning.\r\n\r\nNow, the basis of this representation is suffrage. The right to choose\r\nrepresentatives is every man's part in the exercise of sovereign power;\r\nto have a voice in it, if he has the proper qualifications, is the\r\nportion of political power belonging to every elector. That is the\r\nbeginning. That is the mode in which power emanates from its source, and\r\ngets into the hands of conventions, legislatures, courts of law, and the\r\nchair of the executive. It begins in suffrage. Suffrage is the\r\ndelegation of the power of an individual to some agent.\r\n\r\nThis being so, then follow two other great principles of the American\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n1. The first is, that the right of suffrage shall be guarded, protected,\r\nand secured against force and against fraud; and,\r\n\r\n2. The second is, that its exercise shall be prescribed by previous law;\r\nits qualifications shall be prescribed by previous law; the time and\r\nplace of its exercise shall be prescribed by previous law; the manner of\r\nits exercise, under whose supervision (always sworn officers of the\r\nlaw), is to be prescribed. And then, again, the results are to be\r\ncertified to the central power by some certain rule, by some known\r\npublic officers, in some clear and definite form, to the end that two\r\nthings may be done: first, that every man entitled to vote may vote;\r\nsecond, that his vote may be sent forward and counted, and so he may\r\nexercise his part of sovereignty, in common with his fellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nIn the exercise of political power through representatives we know\r\nnothing, we never have known any thing, but such an exercise as should\r\ntake place through the prescribed forms of law. When we depart from\r\nthat, we shall wander as widely from the American track as the pole is\r\nfrom the track of the sun.\r\n\r\nI have said that it is one principle of the American system, that the\r\npeople limit their governments, National and State. They do so; but it\r\nis another principle, equally true and certain, and, according to my\r\njudgment of things, equally important, that the people often _limit\r\nthemselves_. They set bounds to their own power. They have chosen to\r\nsecure the institutions which they establish against the sudden impulses\r\nof mere majorities. All our institutions teem with instances of this. It\r\nwas their great conservative principle, in constituting forms of\r\ngovernment, that they should secure what they had established against\r\nhasty changes by simple majorities. By the fifth article of the\r\nConstitution of the United States, Congress, two thirds of both houses\r\nconcurring, may propose amendments of the Constitution; or, on the\r\napplication of the legislatures of two thirds of the States, may call a\r\nconvention; and amendments proposed in either of these forms must be\r\nratified by the legislatures or conventions of three fourths of the\r\nStates. The fifth article of the Constitution, if it was made a topic\r\nfor those who framed the \"people's constitution\" of Rhode Island, could\r\nonly have been a matter of reproach. It gives no countenance to any of\r\ntheir proceedings, or to any thing like them. On the contrary, it is one\r\nremarkable instance of the enactment and application of that great\r\nAmerican principle, that the constitution of government should be\r\ncautiously and prudently interfered with, and that changes should not\r\nordinarily be begun and carried through by bare majorities.\r\n\r\nBut the people limit themselves also in other ways. They limit\r\nthemselves in the first exercise of their political rights. They limit\r\nthemselves, by all their constitutions, in two important respects; that\r\nis to say, in regard to the qualifications of _electors_, and in regard\r\nto the qualifications of the _elected_. In every State, and in all the\r\nStates, the people have precluded themselves from voting for everybody\r\nthey might wish to vote for; they have limited their own right of\r\nchoosing. They have said, We will elect no man who has not such and such\r\nqualifications. We will not vote ourselves, unless we have such and such\r\nqualifications. They have also limited themselves to certain prescribed\r\nforms for the conduct of elections. They must vote at a particular\r\nplace, at a particular time, and under particular conditions, or not at\r\nall. It is in these modes that we are to ascertain the will of the\r\nAmerican people; and our Constitution and laws know no other mode. We\r\nare not to take the will of the people from public meetings, nor from\r\ntumultuous assemblies, by which the timid are terrified, the prudent are\r\nalarmed, and by which society is disturbed. These are not American modes\r\nof signifying the will of the people, and they never were. If any thing\r\nin the country, not ascertained by a regular vote, by regular returns,\r\nand by regular representation, has been established, it is an exception,\r\nand not the rule; it is an anomaly which, I believe, can scarcely be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIt is true that at the Revolution, when all government was immediately\r\ndissolved, the people got together, and what did they do? Did they\r\nexercise sovereign power? They began an inceptive organization, the\r\nobject of which was to bring together representatives of the people, who\r\nshould form a government. This was the mode of proceeding in those\r\nStates where their legislatures were dissolved. It was much like that\r\nhad in England upon the abdication of James the Second. He ran away, he\r\nabdicated. He threw the great seal into the Thames. I am not aware that,\r\non the 4th of May, 1842, any great seal was thrown into Providence\r\nRiver! But James abdicated, and King William took the government; and\r\nhow did he proceed? Why, he at once requested all who had been members\r\nof the old Parliament, of any regular Parliament in the time of Charles\r\nthe Second, to assemble. The Peers, being a standing body, could of\r\ncourse assemble; and all they did was to recommend the calling of a\r\nconvention, to be chosen by the same electors, and composed of the same\r\nnumbers, as composed a Parliament. The convention assembled, and, as all\r\nknow, was turned into a Parliament. This was a case of necessity, a\r\nrevolution. Don't we call it so? And why? Not merely because a new\r\nsovereign then ascended the throne of the Stuarts, but because there was\r\na change in the organization of the government. The legal and\r\nestablished succession was broken. The convention did not assemble under\r\nany preceding law. There was a _hiatus_, a syncope, in the action of the\r\nbody politic. This was revolution, and the Parliaments that assembled\r\nafterwards referred their legal origin to that revolution.\r\n\r\nIs it not obvious enough, that men cannot get together and count\r\nthemselves, and say they are so many hundreds and so many thousands, and\r\njudge of their own qualifications, and call themselves the people, and\r\nset up a government? Why, another set of men, forty miles off, on the\r\nsame day, with the same propriety, with as good qualifications, and in\r\nas large numbers, may meet and set up another government; one may meet\r\nat Newport and another at Chepachet, and both may call themselves the\r\npeople. What is this but anarchy? What liberty is there here, but a\r\ntumultuary, tempestuous, violent, stormy liberty, a sort of South\r\nAmerican liberty, without power except in its spasms, a liberty\r\nsupported by arms to-day, crushed by arms to-morrow? Is that _our_\r\nliberty?\r\n\r\nThe regular action of popular power, on the other hand, places upon\r\npublic liberty the most beautiful face that ever adorned that angel\r\nform. All is regular and harmonious in its features, and gentle in its\r\noperation. The stream of public authority, under American liberty,\r\nrunning in this channel, has the strength of the Missouri, while its\r\nwaters are as transparent as those of a crystal lake. It is powerful for\r\ngood. It produces no tumult, no violence, and no wrong;--\r\n\r\n    \"Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull;\r\n    Strong, without rage; without o'erflowing, full.\"\r\n\r\nAnother American principle growing out of this, and just as important\r\nand well settled as is the truth that the people are the source of\r\npower, is, that, when in the course of events it becomes necessary to\r\nascertain the will of the people on a new exigency, or a new state of\r\nthings or of opinion, the legislative power provides for that\r\nascertainment by an ordinary act of legislation. Has not that been our\r\nwhole history? It would take me from now till the sun shall go down to\r\nadvert to all the instances of it, and I shall only refer to the most\r\nprominent, and especially to the establishment of the Constitution under\r\nwhich you sit. The old Congress, upon the suggestion of the delegates\r\nwho assembled at Annapolis in May, 1786, recommended to the States that\r\nthey should send delegates to a convention to be holden at Philadelphia\r\nto form a Constitution. No article of the old Confederation gave them\r\npower to do this; but they did it, and the States did appoint delegates,\r\nwho assembled at Philadelphia, and formed the Constitution. It was\r\ncommunicated to the old Congress, and that body recommended to the\r\nStates to make provision for calling the people together to act upon its\r\nadoption. Was not that exactly the case of passing a law to ascertain\r\nthe will of the people in a new exigency? And this method was adopted\r\nwithout opposition, nobody suggesting that there could be any other mode\r\nof ascertaining the will of the people.\r\n\r\nMy learned friend went through the constitutions of several of the\r\nStates. It is enough to say, that, of the old thirteen States, the\r\nconstitutions, with but one exception, contained no provision for their\r\nown amendment. In New Hampshire there was a provision for taking the\r\nsense of the people once in seven years. Yet there is hardly one that\r\nhas not altered its constitution, and it has been done by conventions\r\ncalled by the legislature, as an ordinary exercise of legislative power.\r\nNow what State ever altered its constitution in any other mode? What\r\nalteration has ever been brought in, put in, forced in, or got in\r\nanyhow, by resolutions of mass meetings, and then by applying force? In\r\nwhat State has an assembly, calling itself the people, convened without\r\nlaw, without authority, without qualifications, without certain\r\nofficers, with no oaths, securities, or sanctions of any kind, met and\r\nmade a constitution, and called it the constitution of the STATE? There\r\nmust be some authentic mode of ascertaining the will of the people, else\r\nall is anarchy. It resolves itself into the law of the strongest, or,\r\nwhat is the same thing, of the most numerous for the moment, and all\r\nconstitutions and all legislative rights are prostrated and disregarded.\r\n\r\nBut my learned adversary says, that, if we maintain that the people (for\r\nhe speaks in the name and on behalf of the people, to which I do not\r\nobject) cannot commence changes in their government but by some previous\r\nact of legislation, and if the legislature will not grant such an act,\r\nwe do in fact follow the example of the Holy Alliance, \"the doctors of\r\nLaybach,\" where the assembled sovereigns said that all changes of\r\ngovernment must proceed from sovereigns; and it is said that we mark out\r\nthe same rule for the people of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nNow will any man, will my adversary here, on a moment's reflection,\r\nundertake to show the least resemblance on earth between what I have\r\ncalled the American doctrine, and the doctrine of the sovereigns at\r\nLaybach? What do I contend for? I say that the will of the people must\r\nprevail, when it is ascertained; but there must be some legal and\r\nauthentic mode of ascertaining that will; and then the people may make\r\nwhat government they please. Was that the doctrine of Laybach? Was not\r\nthe doctrine there held this,--that the _sovereigns_ should say what\r\nchanges shall be made? Changes must proceed from them; new constitutions\r\nand new laws emanate from them; and all the people had to do was to\r\nsubmit. That is what they maintained. All changes began with the\r\nsovereigns, and ended with the sovereigns. Pray, at about the time that\r\nthe Congress of Laybach was in session, did the allied powers put it to\r\nthe people of Italy to say what sort of change they would have? And at a\r\nmore recent date, did they ask the citizens of Cracow what change they\r\nwould have in their constitution? Or did they take away their\r\nconstitution, laws, and liberties, by their own sovereign act? All that\r\nis necessary here is, that the will of the people should be ascertained,\r\nby some regular rule of proceeding, prescribed by previous law. But when\r\nascertained, that will is as sovereign as the will of a despotic prince,\r\nof the Czar of Muscovy, or the Emperor of Austria himself, though not\r\nquite so easily made known. A ukase or an edict signifies at once the\r\nwill of a despotic prince; but that will of the people, which is here as\r\nsovereign as the will of such a prince, is not so quickly ascertained or\r\nknown; and thence arises the necessity for suffrage, which is the mode\r\nwhereby each man's power is made to tell upon the constitution of the\r\ngovernment, and in the enactment of laws.\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent laws for taking the will of the people in any\r\nState is the law of 1845, of the State of New York. It begins by\r\nrecommending to the people to assemble in their several election\r\ndistricts, and proceed to vote for delegates to a convention. If you\r\nwill take the pains to read that act, it will be seen that New York\r\nregarded it as an ordinary exercise of legislative power. It applies all\r\nthe penalties for fraudulent voting, as in other elections. It punishes\r\nfalse oaths, as in other cases. Certificates of the proper officers were\r\nto be held conclusive, and the will of the people was, in this respect,\r\ncollected essentially in the same manner, supervised by the same\r\nofficers, under the same guards against force and fraud, collusion and\r\nmisrepresentation, as are usual in voting for State or United States\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, from the commencement of the government under which\r\nwe live, down to this late act of the State of New York, one uniform\r\ncurrent of law, of precedent, and of practice, all going to establish\r\nthe point that changes in government are to be brought about by the will\r\nof the people, assembled under such legislative provisions as may be\r\nnecessary to ascertain that will, truly and authentically.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, may it please your honors, it becomes very important\r\nto consider what bearing the Constitution and laws of the United States\r\nhave upon this Rhode Island question. Of course the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States recognizes the existence of States. One branch of the\r\nlegislature of the United States is composed of Senators, appointed by\r\nthe States, in their State capacities. The Constitution of the United\r\nStates[1] says that \"the United States shall guarantee to each State a\r\nrepublican form of government, and shall protect the several States\r\nagainst invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the\r\nexecutive when the legislature cannot be convened, against domestic\r\nviolence.\" Now, I cannot but think this a very stringent article,\r\ndrawing after it the most important consequences, and all of them _good_\r\nconsequences. The Constitution, in the section cited, speaks of States\r\nas having existing legislatures and existing executives; and it speaks\r\nof cases in which violence is practised or threatened against the State,\r\nin other words, \"domestic violence\"; and it says the State shall be\r\nprotected. It says, then, does it not? that the existing government of a\r\nState shall be protected. My adversary says, if so, and if the\r\nlegislature would not call a convention, and if, when the people rise\r\nto make a constitution, the United States step in and prohibit them,\r\nwhy, the rights and privileges of the people are checked, controlled.\r\nUndoubtedly. The Constitution does not proceed on the _ground_ of\r\nrevolution; it does not proceed on any _right_ of revolution; but it\r\ndoes go on the idea, that, within and under the Constitution, no new\r\nform of government can be established in any State, without the\r\nauthority of the existing government.\r\n\r\nAdmitting the legitimacy of the argument of my learned adversary, it\r\nwould not authorize the inference he draws from it, because his own case\r\nfalls within the same range. He has proved, he thinks, that there was an\r\nexisting government, a paper government, at least; a rightful\r\ngovernment, as he alleges. Suppose it to be rightful, in his sense of\r\nright. Suppose three fourths of the people of Rhode Island to have been\r\nengaged in it, and ready to sustain it. What then? How is it to be done\r\nwithout the consent of the previous government? How is the fact, that\r\nthree fourths of the people are in favor of the new government, to be\r\nlegally ascertained? And if the existing government deny that fact, and\r\nif that government hold on, and will not surrender till displaced by\r\nforce, and if it is threatened by force, then the case of the\r\nConstitution arises, and the United States must aid the government that\r\nis in, because an attempt to displace a government by force is \"domestic\r\nviolence.\" It is the exigency provided for by the Constitution. If the\r\nexisting government maintain its post, though three fourths of the State\r\nhave adopted the new constitution, is it not evident enough that the\r\nexigency arises in which the constitutional power here must go to the\r\naid of the existing government? Look at the law of 28th February,\r\n1795.[2] Its words are, \"And in case of an insurrection in any State,\r\n_against the government thereof_, it shall be lawful for the President\r\nof the United States, on application of the legislature of such State,\r\nor of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened), to call\r\nforth such number of the militia of any other State or States, as may be\r\napplied for, as he may judge sufficient to suppress such insurrection.\"\r\nInsurrection against the _existing_ government is, then, the thing to be\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\nBut the law and the Constitution, the whole system of American\r\ninstitutions, do not contemplate a case in which a resort will be\r\nnecessary to proceedings _aliunde_, or outside of the law and the\r\nConstitution, for the purpose of amending the frame of government. They\r\ngo on the idea that the States are all republican, that they are all\r\nrepresentative in their forms, and that these popular governments in\r\neach State, the annually created creatures of the people, will give all\r\nproper facilities and necessary aids to bring about changes which the\r\npeople may judge necessary in their constitutions. They take that ground\r\nand act on no other supposition. They assume that the popular will in\r\nall particulars will be accomplished. And history has proved that the\r\npresumption is well founded.\r\n\r\nThis, may it please your honors, is the view I take of what I have\r\ncalled the American system. These are the methods of bringing about\r\nchanges in government.\r\n\r\nNow, it is proper to look into this record, and see what the questions\r\nare that are presented by it, and consider,--\r\n\r\n1. Whether the case is one for judicial investigation at all; that is,\r\nwhether this court can try the matters which the plaintiff has offered\r\nto prove in the court below; and,\r\n\r\n2. In the second place, whether many things which he did offer to prove,\r\nif they could have been and had been proved, were not acts of\r\ncriminality, and therefore no justification; and,\r\n\r\n3. Whether all that was offered to be proved would show that, in point\r\nof fact, there had been established and put in operation any new\r\nconstitution, displacing the old charter government of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThe declaration is in trespass. The writ was issued on the 8th of\r\nOctober, 1842, in which Martin Luther complains that Luther M. Borden\r\nand others broke into his house in Warren, Rhode Island, on the 29th of\r\nJune, 1842, and disturbed his family and committed other illegal acts.\r\n\r\nThe defendant answers, that large numbers of men were in arms, in Rhode\r\nIsland, for the purpose of overthrowing the government of the State, and\r\nmaking war upon it; and that, for the preservation of the government and\r\npeople, martial law had been proclaimed by the Governor, under an act of\r\nthe legislature, on the 25th of June, 1842. The plea goes on to aver,\r\nthat the plaintiff was aiding and abetting this attempt to overthrow the\r\ngovernment, and that the defendant was under the military authority of\r\nJohn T. Child, and was ordered by him to arrest the plaintiff; for which\r\npurpose he applied at the door of his house, and being refused entrance\r\nhe forced the door.\r\n\r\nThe action is thus for an alleged trespass, and the plea is\r\njustification under the law of Rhode Island. The plea and replications\r\nare as usual in such cases in point of form. The plea was filed at the\r\nNovember term of 1842, and the case was tried at the November term of\r\n1843, in the Circuit Court in Rhode Island. In order to make out a\r\ndefence, the defendant offered the charter of Rhode Island, the\r\nparticipation of the State in the Declaration of Independence, its\r\nuniting with the Confederation in 1778, its admission into the Union in\r\n1790, its continuance in the Union and its recognition as a State down\r\nto May, 1843, when the constitution now in force was adopted. Here let\r\nit be particularly remarked, that Congress admitted Rhode Island into\r\nthe Constitution under this identical old charter government, thereby\r\ngiving sanction to it as a republican form of government. The defendant\r\nthen refers to all the laws and proceedings of the Assembly, till the\r\nadoption of the present constitution of Rhode Island. To repel the case\r\nof the defendant, the plaintiff read the proceedings of the old\r\nlegislature, and documents to show that the idea of changing the\r\ngovernment had been entertained as long ago as 1790. He read also\r\ncertain resolutions of the Assembly in 1841, memorials praying changes\r\nin the constitution, and other documents to the same effect. He next\r\noffered to prove that suffrage associations were formed throughout the\r\nState in 1840 and 1841, and that steps were taken by them for holding\r\npublic meetings; and to show the proceedings had at those meetings. In\r\nthe next place, he offered to prove that a mass convention was held at\r\nNewport, attended by over four thousand persons, and another at\r\nProvidence, at which over six thousand attended, at which resolutions\r\nwere passed in favor of the change. Then he offered to prove the\r\nelection of delegates; the meeting of the convention in October, 1841,\r\nand the draughting of the Dorr constitution; the reassembling in 1841,\r\nthe completion of the draught, its submission to the people, their\r\nvoting upon it, its adoption, and the proclamation on the 13th of\r\nJanuary, 1842, that the constitution so adopted was the law of the land.\r\n\r\nThat is the substance of what was averred as to the formation of the\r\nDorr constitution. The plaintiff next offered to prove that the\r\nconstitution was adopted by a large majority of the qualified voters of\r\nthe State; that officers were elected under it in April, 1842; that this\r\nnew government assembled on the 3d of May; and he offered a copy of its\r\nproceedings. He sets forth that the court refused to admit testimony\r\nupon these subjects, and to these points; and ruled that the old\r\ngovernment and laws of the State were in full force and power, and then\r\nexisting, when the alleged trespass was made, and that they justified\r\nthe acts of the defendants, according to their plea.\r\n\r\nI will give a few references to other proceedings of this new\r\ngovernment. The new constitution was proclaimed on the 13th of January,\r\n1842, by some of the officers of the convention. On the 13th of April,\r\nofficers were appointed under it, and Mr. Dorr was chosen governor. On\r\nTuesday, the 3d of May, the new legislature met, was organized, and\r\nthen, it is insisted, the new constitution became the law of the land.\r\nThe legislature sat through that whole day, morning and evening;\r\nadjourned; met the next day, and sat through all that day, morning and\r\nevening, and did a great deal of paper business. It went through the\r\nforms of choosing a Supreme Court, and transacting other business of a\r\nsimilar kind, and on the evening of the 4th of May it adjourned, to meet\r\nagain on the first Monday of July, in Providence,\r\n\r\n    \"And word spake never more.\"\r\n\r\nIt never reassembled. This government, then, whatever it was, came into\r\nexistence on the _third_ day of May, and went out of existence on the\r\n_fourth_ day of May.\r\n\r\nI will now give some references concerning the new constitution\r\nauthorized by the government, the old government, and which is now the\r\nconstitution of Rhode Island. It was framed in November, 1842. It was\r\nvoted upon by the people on the 21st, 22d, and 23d days of November, was\r\nthen by them accepted, and became by its own provisions the constitution\r\nof Rhode Island on the first Tuesday of May, 1843.\r\n\r\nNow, what, in the mean time, had become of Mr. Dorr's government?\r\nAccording to the principle of its friends, they are forced to admit that\r\nit was superseded by the new, that is to say, the present government,\r\nbecause the people accepted the new government. But there was no new\r\ngovernment till May, 1843. According to them, then, there was an\r\n_interregnum_ of a whole year. If Mr. Dorr had had a government, what\r\nbecame of it? If it ever came in, what put it out of existence? Why did\r\nit not meet on the day to which it had adjourned? It was not displaced\r\nby the new constitution, because that had not been agreed upon in\r\nconvention till November. It was not adopted by the people till the last\r\nof November, and it did not go into operation till May. What then had\r\nbecome of Mr. Dorr's government?\r\n\r\nI think it is important to note that the new constitution, established\r\naccording to the prescribed forms, came thus into operation in May,\r\n1843, and was admitted by all to be the constitution of the State. What\r\nthen happened in the State of Rhode Island? I do not mean to go through\r\nall the trials that were had after this ideal government of Mr. Dorr\r\nceased to exist; but I will ask attention to the report of the trial of\r\nDorr for treason, which took place in 1844, before all the judges of the\r\nSupreme Court of the State. He was indicted in August, 1842, and the\r\ntrial came on in March, 1844. The indictment was found while the charter\r\ngovernment was in force, and the trial was had under the new\r\nconstitution. He was found guilty of treason.\r\n\r\nAnd I turn to the report of the trial now, to call attention to the\r\nlanguage of the court in its charge, as delivered by Chief Justice\r\nDurfee. I present the following extract from that charge:--\r\n\r\n     \"It may be, Gentlemen, that he really believed himself to be the\r\n     governor of the State, and that he acted throughout under this\r\n     delusion. However this may go to extenuate the offence, it does not\r\n     take from it its legal guilt. It is no defence to an indictment for\r\n     the violation of any law for the defendant to come into court and\r\n     say, 'I thought that I was but exercising a constitutional right,\r\n     and I claim an acquittal on the ground of mistake,' Were it so,\r\n     there would be an end to all law and all government. Courts and\r\n     juries would have nothing to do but to sit in judgment upon\r\n     indictments, in order to acquit or excuse. The accused has only to\r\n     prove that he has been systematic in committing crime, and that he\r\n     thought that he had a right to commit it; and, according to this\r\n     doctrine, you must acquit. The main ground upon which the prisoner\r\n     sought for a justification was, that a constitution had been\r\n     adopted by a majority of the male adult population of this State,\r\n     voting in their primary or natural capacity or condition, and that\r\n     he was subsequently elected, and did the acts charged, as governor\r\n     under it. He offered the votes themselves to prove its adoption,\r\n     which were also to be followed by proof of his election. This\r\n     evidence we have ruled out. Courts and juries, Gentlemen, do not\r\n     count votes to determine whether a constitution has been adopted or\r\n     a governor elected, or not. Courts take notice, without proof\r\n     offered from the bar, what the constitution is or was, and who is\r\n     or was the governor of their own State. It belongs to the\r\n     legislature to exercise this high duty. It is the legislature\r\n     which, in the exercise of its delegated sovereignty, counts the\r\n     votes and declares whether a constitution be adopted or a governor\r\n     elected, or not; and we cannot revise and reverse their acts in\r\n     this particular, without usurping their power. Were the votes on\r\n     the adoption of our present constitution now offered here to prove\r\n     that it was or was not adopted; or those given for the governor\r\n     under it, to prove that he was or was not elected; we could not\r\n     receive the evidence ourselves, we could not permit it to pass to\r\n     the jury. And why not? Because, if we did so, we should cease to be\r\n     a mere judicial, and become a political tribunal, with the whole\r\n     sovereignty in our hands. Neither the people nor the legislature\r\n     would be sovereign. We should be sovereign, or you would be\r\n     sovereign; and we should deal out to parties litigant, here at our\r\n     bar, sovereignty to this or that, according to rules or laws of our\r\n     own making, and heretofore unknown in courts.\r\n\r\n     \"In what condition would this country be, if appeals could be thus\r\n     taken to courts and juries? _This_ jury might decide one way, and\r\n     _that_ another, and the sovereignty might be found here to-day, and\r\n     there to-morrow. Sovereignty is above courts or juries, and the\r\n     creature cannot sit in judgment upon its creator. Were this\r\n     instrument offered as the constitution of a foreign state, we\r\n     might, perhaps, under some circumstances, require proof of its\r\n     existence; but, even in that case, the fact would not be\r\n     ascertained by counting the votes given at its adoption, but by the\r\n     certificate of the secretary of state, under the broad seal of the\r\n     state. This instrument is not offered as a foreign constitution,\r\n     and this court is bound to know what the constitution of the\r\n     government is under which it acts, without any proof even of that\r\n     high character. We know nothing of the existence of the so-called\r\n     'people's constitution' as law, and there is no proof before you of\r\n     its adoption, and of the election of the prisoner as governor under\r\n     it; and you can return a verdict only on the evidence that has\r\n     passed to you.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus, may it please your honors, attempted to state the questions\r\nas they arise, and having referred to what has taken place in Rhode\r\nIsland, I shall present what further I have to say in three\r\npropositions:--\r\n\r\n1st. I say, first, that the matters offered to be proved by the\r\nplaintiff in the court below are not of judicial cognizance; and proof\r\nof them, therefore, was properly rejected by the court.\r\n\r\n2d. If all these matters could be, and had been, legally proved, they\r\nwould have constituted no defence, because they show nothing but an\r\n_illegal_ attempt to overthrow the government of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n3d. No proof was offered by the plaintiff to show that, in fact, another\r\ngovernment had gone into operation, by which the Charter government had\r\nbecome displaced.\r\n\r\nAnd first, these matters are not of judicial cognizance. Does this need\r\narguing? Are the various matters of fact alleged, the meetings, the\r\nappointment of committees, the qualifications of voters,--is there any\r\none of all these matters of which a court of law can take cognizance in\r\na case in which it is to decide on sovereignty? Are fundamental changes\r\nin the frame of a government to be thus proved? The thing to be proved\r\nis a change of the sovereign power. Two legislatures existed at the same\r\ntime, both claiming power to pass laws. Both could not have a legal\r\nexistence. What, then, is the attempt of our adversaries? To put down\r\none sovereign government, and to put another up, by facts and\r\nproceedings in regard to elections out of doors, unauthorized by any law\r\nwhatever. Regular proceedings for a change of government may in some\r\ncases, perhaps, be taken notice of by a court; but this court must look\r\nelsewhere than out of doors, and to public meetings, irregular and\r\nunauthorized, for the decision of such a question as this. It naturally\r\nlooks to that authority under which it sits here, to the provisions of\r\nthe Constitution which have created this tribunal, and to the laws by\r\nwhich its proceedings are regulated. It must look to the acts of the\r\ngovernment of the United States, in its various branches.\r\n\r\nThis Rhode Island disturbance, as everybody knows, was brought to the\r\nknowledge of the President of the United States[3] by the public\r\nauthorities of Rhode Island; and how did he treat it? The United States\r\nhave guaranteed to each State a republican form of government. And a law\r\nof Congress has directed the President, in a constitutional case\r\nrequiring the adoption of such a proceeding, to call out the militia to\r\nput down domestic violence, and suppress insurrection. Well, then,\r\napplication was made to the President of the United States, to the\r\nexecutive power of the United States. For, according to our system, it\r\ndevolves upon the executive to determine, in the first instance, what\r\nare and what are not governments. The President recognizes governments,\r\nforeign governments, as they appear from time to time in the occurrences\r\nof this changeful world. And the Constitution and the laws, if an\r\ninsurrection exists against the government of any State, rendering it\r\nnecessary to appear with an armed force, make it his duty to call out\r\nthe militia and suppress it.\r\n\r\nTwo things may here be properly considered. The first is, that the\r\nConstitution declares that the United States shall protect every State\r\nagainst domestic violence; and the law of 1795, making provision for\r\ncarrying this constitutional duty into effect in all proper cases,\r\ndeclares, that, \"in case of an insurrection in any State against the\r\ngovernment thereof, it shall be lawful for the President of the United\r\nStates to call out the militia of other States to suppress such\r\ninsurrection.\" These constitutional and legal provisions make it the\r\nindispensable duty of the President to decide, in cases of commotion,\r\nwhat is the rightful government of the State. He cannot avoid such\r\ndecision. And in this case he decided, of course, that the existing\r\ngovernment, the charter government, was the rightful government. He\r\ncould not possibly have decided otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, if events had made it necessary to call out the\r\nmilitia, and the officers and soldiers of such militia, in protecting\r\nthe existing government, had done precisely what the defendants in this\r\ncase did, could an action have been maintained against them? No one\r\nwould assert so absurd a proposition.\r\n\r\nIn reply to the requisition of the Governor, the President stated that\r\nhe did not think it was yet time for the application of force; but he\r\nwrote a letter to the Secretary of War, in which he directed him to\r\nconfer with the Governor of Rhode Island; and, whenever it should appear\r\nto them to be necessary, to call out from Massachusetts and Connecticut\r\na militia force sufficient to _terminate at once_ this insurrection, by\r\nthe authority of the government of the United States. We are at no loss,\r\ntherefore, to know how the executive government of the United States\r\ntreated this insurrection. It was regarded as fit _to be suppressed_.\r\nThat is manifest from the President's letters to the Secretary of War\r\nand to Governor King.\r\n\r\nNow, the eye of this court must be directed to the proceedings of the\r\ngeneral government, which had its attention called to the subject, and\r\nwhich did institute proceedings respecting it. And the court will learn\r\nfrom the proceedings of the executive branch of the government, and of\r\nthe two chambers above us, how the disturbances in Rhode Island were\r\nregarded; whether they were looked upon as the establishment of any\r\ngovernment, or as a mere pure, unauthorized, unqualified _insurrection_\r\nagainst the authority of the existing government of the State.\r\n\r\nI say, therefore, that, upon that ground, these facts are not facts\r\nwhich this court can inquire into, or which the court below could try;\r\nbecause they are facts going to prove (if they prove any thing) the\r\nestablishment of a new sovereignty; and that is a question to be settled\r\nelsewhere and otherwise. From the very nature of the case, it is not a\r\nquestion to be decided by judicial inquiry. Take, for example, one of\r\nthe points which it involves. My adversary offered to prove that the\r\nconstitution was adopted by a majority of the people of Rhode Island; by\r\na large majority, as he alleges. What does this offer call on your\r\nhonors to do? Why, to ascertain, by proof, what is the number of\r\ncitizens of Rhode Island, and how many attended the meetings at which\r\nthe delegates to the convention were elected; and then you have to add\r\nthem all up, and prove by testimony the qualifications of every one of\r\nthem to be an elector. It is enough to state such a proposition to show\r\nits absurdity. As none such ever was sustained in a court of law, so\r\nnone can be or ought to be sustained. Observe that minutes of\r\nproceedings can be no proof, for they were made by no authentic persons;\r\nregisters were kept by no warranted officers; chairmen and moderators\r\nwere chosen without authority. In short, there are no official records;\r\nthere is no testimony in the case but parol. Chief Justice Durfee has\r\nstated this so plainly, that I need not dwell upon it.\r\n\r\nBut, again, I say you cannot look into the facts attempted to be proved,\r\nbecause of the certainty of the continuance of the old government till\r\nthe new and legal constitution went into effect on the 3d of May, 1843.\r\nTo prove that there was another constitution of two days' duration would\r\nbe ridiculous. And I say that the decision of Rhode Island herself, by\r\nher legislature, by her executive, by the adjudication of her highest\r\ncourt of law, on the trial of Dorr, has shut up the whole case. Do you\r\npropose,--I will not put it in that form,--but would it be proper for\r\nthis court to reverse that adjudication? That declares that the judges\r\nof Rhode Island know nothing of the \"People's Constitution.\" Is it\r\npossible, then, for this court, or for the court below, to know any\r\nthing of it?\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that, if there were nothing else in the case, the\r\nproceedings of Rhode Island herself must close everybody's mouth, in the\r\ncourt and out of it. Rhode Island is competent to decide the question\r\nherself, and everybody else ought to be bound by her decision. And she\r\nhas decided it.\r\n\r\nAnd it is but a branch of this to say, according to my second\r\nproposition,--\r\n\r\n2. That if every thing offered had been proved, if in the nature of the\r\ncase these facts and proceedings could have been received as proof, the\r\ncourt could not have listened to them, because every one of them is\r\nregarded by the State in which they took place as a _criminal_ act. Who\r\ncan derive any authority from acts declared to be criminal? The very\r\nproceedings which are now set up here show that this pretended\r\nconstitution was founded upon acts which the legislature of the State\r\nhad provided punishment for, and which the courts of the State have\r\npunished. All, therefore, which the plaintiff has attempted to prove,\r\nare acts which he was not allowed to prove, because they were criminal\r\nin themselves, and have been so treated and punished, so far as the\r\nState government, in its discretion, has thought proper to punish them.\r\n\r\n3. Thirdly, and lastly, I say that there is no evidence offered, nor has\r\nany distinct allegation been made, that there was an actual government\r\nestablished and put in operation to displace the Charter government,\r\neven for a single day. That is evident enough. You find the whole\r\nembraced in those two days, the 3d and 4th of May. The French revolution\r\nwas thought to be somewhat rapid. That took _three_ days. But this work\r\nwas accomplished in two. It is all there, and what is it? Its birth, its\r\nwhole life, and its death were accomplished in forty-eight hours. What\r\ndoes it appear that the members of this government did? Why, they voted\r\nthat A should be treasurer, and C, secretary, and Mr. Dorr, governor;\r\nand chose officers of the Supreme Court. But did ever any man under that\r\nauthority attempt to exercise a particle of official power? Did any man\r\never bring a suit? Did ever an officer make an arrest? Did any act\r\nproceed from any member of this government, or from any agent of it, to\r\ntouch a citizen of Rhode Island in his person, his safety, or his\r\nproperty, so as to make the party answerable upon an indictment or in a\r\ncivil suit? Never. It never performed one single act of government. It\r\nnever did a thing in the world! All was patriotism, and all was paper;\r\nand with patriotism and with paper it went out on the 4th of May,\r\nadmitting itself to be, as all must regard it, a contemptible _sham_!\r\n\r\nI have now done with the principles involved in this case, and the\r\nquestions presented on this record.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the other case, I have but few words to say. And, first, I\r\nthink it is to be regretted that the court below sent up such a list of\r\npoints on which it was divided. I shall not go through them, and shall\r\nleave it to the court to say whether, after they shall have disposed of\r\nthe first cause, there is any thing left. I shall only draw attention to\r\nthe subject of martial law; and in respect to that, instead of going\r\nback to martial law as it existed in England at the time the charter of\r\nRhode Island was granted, I shall merely observe that martial law\r\nconfers power of arrest, of summary trial, and prompt execution; and\r\nthat when it has been proclaimed, the land becomes a camp, and the law\r\nof the camp is the law of the land. Mr. Justice Story defines martial\r\nlaw to be the law of war, a resort to military authority in cases where\r\nthe civil law is not sufficient; and it confers summary power, not to be\r\nused arbitrarily or for the gratification of personal feelings of hatred\r\nor revenge, but for the preservation of order and of the public peace.\r\nThe officer clothed with it is to judge of the degree of force that the\r\nnecessity of the case may demand; and there is no limit to this, except\r\nsuch as is to be found in the nature and character of the exigency.\r\n\r\nI now take leave of this whole case. That it is an interesting incident\r\nin the history of our institutions, I freely admit. That it has come\r\nhither is a subject of no regret to me. I might have said, that I see\r\nnothing to complain of in the proceedings of what is called the Charter\r\ngovernment of Rhode Island, except that it might perhaps have discreetly\r\ntaken measures at an earlier period for revising the constitution. If in\r\nthat delay it erred, it was the error into which prudent and cautious\r\nmen would fall. As to the enormity of freehold suffrage, how long is it\r\nsince Virginia, the parent of States, gave up her freehold suffrage? How\r\nlong is it since nobody voted for governor in New York without a\r\nfreehold qualification? There are now States in which no man can vote\r\nfor members of the upper branch of the legislature who does not own\r\nfifty acres of land. Every State requires more or less of a property\r\nqualification in its officers and electors; and it is for discreet\r\nlegislation, or constitutional provisions, to determine what its amount\r\nshall be. Even the Dorr constitution had a property qualification.\r\nAccording to its provisions, for officers of the State, to be sure,\r\nanybody could vote; but its authors remembered that taxation and\r\nrepresentation go together, and therefore they declared that no man, in\r\nany town, should vote to lay a tax for town purposes who had not the\r\nmeans to pay his portion. It said to him, You cannot vote in the town of\r\nProvidence to levy a tax for repairing the streets of Providence; but\r\nyou may vote for governor, and for thirteen representatives from the\r\ntown of Providence, and send them to the legislature, and there they may\r\ntax the people of Rhode Island at their sovereign will and pleasure.\r\n\r\nI believe that no harm can come of the Rhode Island agitation in 1841,\r\nbut rather good. It will purify the political atmosphere from some of\r\nits noxious mists, and I hope it will clear men's minds from unfounded\r\nnotions and dangerous delusions. I hope it will bring them to look at\r\nthe regularity, the order, with which we carry on what, if the word were\r\nnot so much abused, I would call our _glorious_ representative system of\r\npopular government. Its principles will stand the test of this crisis,\r\nas they have stood the test and torture of others. They are exposed\r\nalways, and they always will be exposed, to dangers. There are dangers\r\nfrom the extremes of too much and of too little popular liberty; from\r\nmonarchy, or military despotism, on one side, and from licentiousness\r\nand anarchy on the other. This always will be the case. The classical\r\nnavigator had been told that he must pass a narrow and dangerous strait:\r\n\r\n    \"Dextrum Scylla latus, laevum implacata Charybdis,\r\n    Obsidet.\"\r\n\r\nForewarned he was alive to his danger, and knew, by signs not doubtful,\r\nwhere he was, when he approached its scene:\r\n\r\n    \"Et gemitum ingentem pelagi, pulsataque saxa,\r\n    Audimus longe, fractasque ad litora voces;\r\n    Exsultantque vada, atque aestu miscentur arenae.\r\n    ... Nimirum haec ilia Charybdis!\"\r\n\r\nThe long-seeing sagacity of our fathers enables us to know equally well\r\nwhere we are, when we hear the voices of tumultuary assemblies, and see\r\nthe turbulence created by numbers meeting and acting without the\r\nrestraints of law; and has most wisely provided constitutional means of\r\nescape and security. When the established authority of government is\r\nopenly contemned; when no deference is paid to the regular and authentic\r\ndeclarations of the public will; when assembled masses put themselves\r\nabove the law, and, calling themselves the people, attempt by force to\r\nseize on the government; when the social and political order of the\r\nstate is thus threatened with overthrow, and the spray of the waves of\r\nviolent popular commotion lashes the stars,--our political pilots may\r\nwell cry out:\r\n\r\n    \"Nimirum haec illa Charybdis!\"\r\n\r\nThe prudence of the country, the sober wisdom of the people, has thus\r\nfar enabled us to carry this Constitution, and all our constitutions,\r\nthrough the perils which have surrounded them, without running upon the\r\nrocks on one side, or being swallowed up in the eddying whirlpools of\r\nthe other. And I fervently hope that this signal happiness and good\r\nfortune will continue, and that our children after us will exercise a\r\nsimilar prudence, and wisdom, and justice; and that, under the Divine\r\nblessing, our system of free government may continue to go on, with\r\nequal prosperity, to the end of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Art.

This treaty,\r\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate, was ratified by the President\r\nof the United States on the 16th of March. In the mean time, a bill,\r\nintroduced into the House of Representatives on the 18th of February, to\r\nauthorize a loan of sixteen millions of dollars for the purpose of\r\ncarrying on the war, passed through that house, and was considered in\r\nthe Senate. Other war measures were considered and adopted by the two\r\nhouses, after the signature and ratification of the treaty. On the 23d\r\nof March, the Sixteen Million Loan Bill being under consideration, Mr.\r\nWebster spoke as follows.]\r\n\r\nMR. PRESIDENT,--On Friday a bill passed the Senate for raising ten\r\nregiments of new troops for the further prosecution of the war against\r\nMexico; and we have been informed that that measure is shortly to be\r\nfollowed, in this branch of the legislature, by a bill to raise twenty\r\nregiments of volunteers for the same service. I was desirous of\r\nexpressing my opinions against the object of these bills, against the\r\nsupposed necessity which leads to their enactment, and against the\r\ngeneral policy which they are apparently designed to promote.\r\nCircumstances personal to myself, but beyond my control, compelled me to\r\nforego, on that day, the execution of that design. The bill now before\r\nthe Senate is a measure for raising money to meet the exigencies of the\r\ngovernment, and to provide the means, as well as for other things, for\r\nthe pay and support of these thirty regiments.\r\n\r\nSir, the scenes through which we have passed, and are passing, here, are\r\nvarious. For a fortnight the world supposes we have been occupied with\r\nthe ratification of a treaty of peace, and that within these walls, \"the\r\nworld shut out,\" notes of peace, and hopes of peace, nay, strong\r\nassurances of peace, and indications of peace, have been uttered to\r\nconsole and to cheer us. Sir, it has been over and over stated, and is\r\npublic, that we have ratified a treaty, of course a treaty of peace,\r\nand, as the country has been led to suppose, not of an uncertain, empty,\r\nand delusive peace, but of real and substantial, a gratifying and an\r\nenduring peace, a peace which would stanch the wounds of war, prevent\r\nthe further flow of human blood, cut off these enormous expenses, and\r\nreturn our friends, and our brothers, and our children, if they be yet\r\nliving, from the land of slaughter, and the land of still more dismal\r\ndestruction by climate, to our firesides and our arms.\r\n\r\nHardly have these halcyon notes ceased upon our ears, when, in resumed\r\npublic session, we are summoned to fresh warlike operations; to create\r\na new army of thirty thousand men for the further prosecution of the\r\nwar; to carry the war, in the language of the President, still more\r\ndreadfully into the vital parts of the enemy, and to press home, by fire\r\nand sword, the claims we make, and the grounds which we insist upon,\r\nagainst our fallen, prostrate, I had almost said, our ignoble enemy. If\r\nwe may judge from the opening speech of the honorable Senator from\r\nMichigan, and from other speeches that have been made upon this floor,\r\nthere has been no time, from the commencement of the war, when it has\r\nbeen more urgently pressed upon us, not only to maintain, but to\r\nincrease, our military means; not only to continue the war, but to press\r\nit still more vigorously than at present.\r\n\r\nPray, what does all this mean? Is it, I ask, confessed, then,--is it\r\nconfessed that we are no nearer a peace than we were when we snatched up\r\nthis bit of paper called, or miscalled, a treaty, and ratified it? Have\r\nwe yet to fight it out to the utmost, as if nothing pacific had\r\nintervened?\r\n\r\nI wish, Sir, to treat the proceedings of this and of every department of\r\nthe government with the utmost respect. The Constitution of this\r\ngovernment, and the exercise of its just powers in the administration of\r\nthe laws under it, have been the cherished object of all my unimportant\r\nlife. But, if the subject were not one too deeply interesting, I should\r\nsay our proceedings here may well enough cause a smile. In the ordinary\r\ntransaction of the foreign relations of this and of all other\r\ngovernments, the course has been to negotiate first, and to ratify\r\nafterwards. This seems to be the natural order of conducting intercourse\r\nbetween foreign states. We have chosen to reverse this order. We ratify\r\nfirst, and negotiate afterwards. We set up a treaty, such as we find it\r\nand choose to make it, and then send two ministers plenipotentiary to\r\nnegotiate thereupon in the capital of the enemy. One would think, Sir,\r\nthe ordinary course of proceeding much the juster; that to negotiate, to\r\nhold intercourse, and come to some arrangement, by authorized agents,\r\nand then to submit that arrangement to the sovereign authority to which\r\nthese agents are responsible, would be always the most desirable method\r\nof proceeding. It strikes me that the course we have adopted is strange,\r\nis even _grotesque_. So far as I know, it is unprecedented in the\r\nhistory of diplomatic intercourse. Learned gentlemen on the floor of the\r\nSenate, interested to defend and protect this course, may, in their\r\nextensive reading, have found examples of it. I know of none.\r\n\r\nSir, we are in possession, by military power, of New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia, countries belonging hitherto to the United States of Mexico.\r\nWe are informed by the President that it is his purpose to retain them,\r\nto consider them as territory fit to be attached to these United States\r\nof America; and our military operations and designs now before the\r\nSenate are to enforce this claim of the executive of the United States.\r\nWe are to compel Mexico to agree that the part of her dominions called\r\nNew Mexico, and that called California, shall be ceded to us. We are in\r\npossession, as is said, and she shall yield her title to us. This is the\r\nprecise object of this new army of thirty thousand men. Sir, it is the\r\nidentical object, in my judgment, for which the war was originally\r\ncommenced, for which it has hitherto been prosecuted, and in furtherance\r\nof which this treaty is to be used but as one means to bring about this\r\ngeneral result; that general result depending, after all, on our own\r\nsuperior power, and on the necessity of submitting to any terms which we\r\nmay prescribe to fallen, fallen, fallen Mexico!\r\n\r\nSir, the members composing the other house, the more popular branch of\r\nthe legislature, have all been elected since, I had almost said the\r\nfatal, I will say the remarkable, events of the 11th and 13th days of\r\nMay, 1846. The other house has passed a resolution affirming that \"the\r\nwar with Mexico was begun unconstitutionally and unnecessarily by the\r\nexecutive government of the United States.\" I concur in that sentiment;\r\nI hold that to be the most recent and authentic expression of the will\r\nand opinion of the majority of the people of the United States.\r\n\r\nThere is, Sir, another proposition, not so authentically announced\r\nhitherto, but, in my judgment, equally true and equally capable of\r\ndemonstration; and that is, that this war was begun, has been continued,\r\nand is now prosecuted, for the great and leading purpose of the\r\nacquisition of new territory, out of which to bring new States, with\r\ntheir Mexican population, into this our Union of the United States.\r\n\r\nIf unavowed at first, this purpose did not remain unavowed long. However\r\noften it may be said that we did not go to war for conquest,\r\n\r\n          \"credat Judaeus Apella,\r\n    Non ego,\"\r\n\r\nyet the moment we get possession of territory we must retain it and make\r\nit our own. Now I think that this original object has not been changed,\r\nhas not been varied. Sir, I think it exists in the eyes of those who\r\noriginally contemplated it, and who began the war for it, as plain, as\r\nattractive to them, and from which they no more avert their eyes now\r\nthan they did then or have done at any time since. We have compelled a\r\ntreaty of cession; we know in our consciences that it is compelled. We\r\nuse it as an instrument and an agency, in conjunction with other\r\ninstruments and other agencies of a more formidable and destructive\r\ncharacter, to enforce the cession of Mexican territory, to acquire\r\nterritory for new States to be added to this Union. We know, every\r\nintelligent man knows, that there is no stronger desire in the breast of\r\na Mexican citizen than to retain the territory which belongs to the\r\nrepublic. We know that the Mexican people will part with it, if part\r\nthey must, with regret, with pangs of sorrow. That we know; we know it\r\nis all forced; and therefore, because we know it must be forced, because\r\nwe know that (whether the government, which we consider our creature, do\r\nor do not agree to it) the Mexican people will never accede to the terms\r\nof this treaty but through the impulse of absolute necessity, and the\r\nimpression made upon them by absolute and irresistible force, therefore\r\nwe purpose to overwhelm them with another army. We purpose to raise\r\nanother army of ten thousand regulars and twenty thousand volunteers,\r\nand to pour them in and upon the Mexican people.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I should be happy to agree, notwithstanding all this tocsin,\r\nand all this cry of all the Semproniuses in the land, that _their_\r\n\"voices are still for war,\"--I should be happy to agree, and\r\nsubstantially I do agree, to the opinion of the Senator from South\r\nCarolina. I think I have myself uttered the sentiment, within a\r\nfortnight, to the same effect, that, after all, _the war with Mexico is\r\nsubstantially over_, that there can be no more fighting. In the present\r\nstate of things, my opinion is that the people of this country will not\r\nsustain the war. They will not go for its heavy expenses; they will not\r\nfind any gratification in putting the bayonet to the throats of the\r\nMexican people. For my part, I hope the ten regiment bill will never\r\nbecome a law. Three weeks ago I should have entertained that hope with\r\nthe utmost confidence; events instruct me to abate my confidence. I\r\nstill _hope_ it will not pass.\r\n\r\nAnd here, I dare say, I shall be called by some a \"Mexican Whig.\" The\r\nman who can stand up here and say that he hopes that what the\r\nadministration projects, and the further prosecution of the war with\r\nMexico requires, may not be carried into effect, must be an enemy to his\r\ncountry, or what gentlemen have considered the same thing, an enemy to\r\nthe President of the United States, and to his administration and his\r\nparty. He is a Mexican. Sir, I think very badly of the Mexican\r\ncharacter, high and low, out and out; but names do not terrify me.\r\nBesides, if I have suffered in this respect, if I have rendered myself\r\nsubject to the reproaches of these stipendiary presses, these hired\r\nabusers of the motives of public men, I have the honor, on this\r\noccasion, to be in very respectable company. In the reproachful sense of\r\nthat term, I don't know a greater Mexican in this body than the\r\nhonorable Senator from Michigan, the chairman of the Committee on\r\nMilitary Affairs.\r\n\r\n     MR. CASS. Will the gentleman be good enough to explain what sort of\r\n     a Mexican I am?\r\n\r\nOn the resumption of the bill in the Senate the other day, the gentleman\r\ntold us that its principal object was to frighten Mexico; it would touch\r\nhis humanity too much to hurt her! He would frighten her--\r\n\r\n     MR. CASS. Does the gentleman affirm that I said that?\r\n\r\nYes; twice.\r\n\r\n     MR. CASS. No, Sir, I beg your pardon, I did not say it. I did not\r\n     say it would touch my humanity to hurt her.\r\n\r\nBe it so.\r\n\r\n     MR. CASS. Will the honorable Senator allow me to repeat my\r\n     statement of the object of the bill? I said it was twofold: first,\r\n     that it would enable us to prosecute the war, if necessary; and,\r\n     second, that it would show Mexico we were prepared to do so; and\r\n     thus, by its moral effect, would induce her to ratify the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman said, that the principal object of the bill was to\r\nfrighten Mexico, and that this would be more humane than to harm her.\r\n\r\n     MR. CASS. That's true.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, the remarkable characteristic of that speech, that which\r\nmakes it so much a Mexican speech, is, that the gentleman spoke it in\r\nthe hearing of Mexico, as well as in the hearing of this Senate. We are\r\naccused here, because what we say is heard by Mexico, and Mexico derives\r\nencouragement from what is said here. And yet the honorable member comes\r\nforth and tells Mexico that the principal object of the bill is to\r\nfrighten her! The words have passed along the wires; they are on the\r\nGulf, and are floating away to Vera Cruz; and when they get there, they\r\nwill signify to Mexico, \"After all, ye good Mexicans, my principal\r\nobject is to frighten you; and to the end that you may not be frightened\r\ntoo much, I have given you this indication of my purpose.\"\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, in any view of this case, in any view of the proper policy of\r\nthis government, to be pursued according to any man's apprehension and\r\njudgment, where is the necessity for this augmentation, by regiments, of\r\nthe military force of the country? I hold in my hand here a note, which\r\nI suppose to be substantially correct, of the present military force of\r\nthe United States. I cannot answer for its entire accuracy, but I\r\nbelieve it to be substantially according to fact. We have twenty-five\r\nregiments of regular troops, of various arms; if full, they would amount\r\nto 28,960 rank and file, and including officers to 30,296 men. These,\r\nwith the exception of six or seven hundred men, are now all out of the\r\nUnited States and in field service in Mexico, or _en route_ to Mexico.\r\nThese regiments are not full; casualties and the climate have sadly\r\nreduced their numbers. If the recruiting service were now to yield ten\r\nthousand men, it would not more than fill up these regiments, so that\r\nevery brigadier and colonel and captain should have his appropriate and\r\nhis full command. Here is a call, then, on the country now for the\r\nenlistment of ten thousand men, to fill up the regiments in the foreign\r\nservice of the United States.\r\n\r\nI understand, Sir, that there is a report from General Scott; from\r\nGeneral Scott, a man who has performed the most brilliant campaign on\r\nrecent military record, a man who has warred against the enemy, warred\r\nagainst the climate, warred against a thousand unpropitious\r\ncircumstances, and has carried the flag of his country to the capital of\r\nthe enemy, honorably, proudly, _humanely_, to his own permanent honor,\r\nand the great military credit of his country,--General Scott; and where\r\nis he? At Puebla! at Puebla, undergoing an inquiry before his inferiors\r\nin rank, and other persons without military rank while the high powers\r\nhe has exercised, and exercised with so much distinction, are\r\ntransferred to another, I do not say to one unworthy of them, but to one\r\ninferior in rank, station, and experience to himself.\r\n\r\nBut General Scott reports, as I understand, that, in February, there\r\nwere twenty thousand regular troops under his command and _en route_,\r\nand we have thirty regiments of volunteers for the war. If full, this\r\nwould make thirty-four thousand men, or, including officers, thirty-five\r\nthousand. So that, if the regiments were full, there is at this moment a\r\nnumber of troops, regular and volunteer, of not less than fifty-five or\r\nsixty thousand men, including recruits on the way. And with these twenty\r\nthousand men in the field, of regular troops, there were also ten\r\nthousand volunteers; making, of regulars and volunteers under General\r\nScott, thirty thousand men. The Senator from Michigan knows these things\r\nbetter than I do, but I believe this is very nearly the fact. Now all\r\nthese troops are regularly officered; there is no deficiency, in the\r\nline or in the staff, of officers. They are all full. Where there is any\r\ndeficiency it consists of men.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, there may be a plausible reason for saying that there is\r\ndifficulty in recruiting at home for the supply of deficiency in the\r\nvolunteer regiments. It may be said that volunteers choose to enlist\r\nunder officers of their own knowledge and selection; they do not incline\r\nto enlist as individual volunteers, to join regiments abroad, under\r\nofficers of whom they know nothing. There may be something in that; but\r\npray what conclusion does it lead to, if not to this, that all these\r\nregiments must moulder away, by casualties or disease, until the\r\nprivates are less in number than the officers themselves.\r\n\r\nBut however that may be with respect to volunteers, in regard to\r\nrecruiting for the regular service, in filling up the regiments by pay\r\nand bounties according to existing laws, or new laws, if new ones are\r\nnecessary, there is no reason on earth why we should now create five\r\nhundred new officers, for the purpose of getting ten thousand more men.\r\nThe officers are already there; in that respect there is no deficiency.\r\nAll that is wanted is men, and there is place for the men; and I suppose\r\nno gentleman, here or elsewhere, thinks that recruiting will go on\r\nfaster than would be necessary to obtain men to fill up the deficiencies\r\nin the regiments abroad.\r\n\r\nBut now, Sir, what do we want of a greater force than we have in Mexico?\r\nI am not saying, What do we want of a force greater than we can supply?\r\nbut, What is the object of bringing these new regiments into the field?\r\nWhat do we propose? There is no army to fight. I suppose there are not\r\nfive hundred men under arms in any part of Mexico; probably not half\r\nthat number, except in one place. Mexico is prostrate. It is not the\r\ngovernment that resists us. Why, it is notorious that the government of\r\nMexico is on our side, that it is an instrument by which we hope to\r\nestablish such a peace, and accomplish such a treaty, as we like. As far\r\nas I understand the matter, the government of Mexico owes its life and\r\nbreath and being to the support of our arms, and to the hope, I do not\r\nsay how inspired, that somehow or other, and at no distant period, she\r\nwill have the pecuniary means of carrying it on, from our three\r\nmillions, or our twelve millions, or from some of our other millions.\r\n\r\nWhat do we propose to do, then, with these thirty regiments which it is\r\ndesigned to throw into Mexico? Are we going to cut the throats of her\r\npeople? Are we to thrust the sword deeper and deeper into the \"vital\r\nparts\" of Mexico? What is it proposed to do? Sir, I can see no object in\r\nit; and yet, while we are pressed and urged to adopt this proposition to\r\nraise ten and twenty regiments, we are told, and the public is told, and\r\nthe public believes, that we are on the verge of a safe and an honorable\r\npeace. Every one looks every morning for tidings of a confirmed peace,\r\nor of confirmed hopes of peace. We gather it from the administration,\r\nand from every organ of the administration from Dan to Beersheba. And\r\nyet warlike preparations, the incurring of expenses, the imposition of\r\nnew charges upon the treasury, are pressed here, as if peace were not in\r\nall our thoughts, at least not in any of our expectations.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I propose to hold a plain talk to-day; and I say that,\r\naccording to my best judgment, the object of the bill is patronage,\r\noffice, the gratification of friends. This very measure for raising ten\r\nregiments creates four or five hundred officers; colonels, subalterns,\r\nand not them only, for for all these I feel some respect, but there are\r\nalso paymasters, contractors, persons engaged in the transportation\r\nservice, commissaries, even down to sutlers, _et id genus omne_, people\r\nwho handle the public money without facing the foe, one and all of whom\r\nare true descendants, or if not, true representatives, of Ancient\r\nPistol, who said,\r\n\r\n                   \"I shall sutler be\r\n    Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.\"\r\n\r\nSir, I hope, with no disrespect for the applicants, and the aspirants,\r\nand the patriots (and among them are some sincere patriots) who would\r\nfight for their country, and those others who are not ready to fight,\r\nbut who are willing to be paid,--with due respect for all of them\r\naccording to their several degrees and their merits, I hope they will\r\nall be disappointed. I hope that, as the pleasant season advances, the\r\nwhole may find it for their interest to place themselves, of mild\r\nmornings, in the cars, and take their destination to their respective\r\nplaces of honorable private occupation and of civil employment. They\r\nhave my good wishes that they may find the way to their homes from the\r\nAvenue and the Capitol, and from the purlieus of the President's house,\r\nin good health themselves, and that they may find their families all\r\nvery happy to receive them.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, to speak more seriously, this war was waged for the object of\r\ncreating new States, on the southern frontier of the United States, out\r\nof Mexican territory, and with such population as could be found\r\nresident thereupon. I have opposed this object. I am against all\r\naccessions of territory to form new States. And this is no matter of\r\nsentimentality, which I am to parade before mass meetings or before my\r\nconstituents at home. It is not a matter with me of declamation, or of\r\nregret, or of expressed repugnance. It is a matter of firm, unchangeable\r\npurpose. I yield nothing to the force of circumstances that have\r\noccurred, or that I can consider as likely to occur. And therefore I\r\nsay, Sir, that, if I were asked to-day whether, for the sake of peace, I\r\nwould take a treaty for adding two new States to the Union on our\r\nsouthern border, I would say, _No!_ distinctly, No! And I wish every man\r\nin the United States to understand that to be my judgment and my\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nI said upon our _southern_ border, because the present proposition takes\r\nthat locality. I would say the same of the western, the northeastern, or\r\nof any other border. I resist to-day, and for ever, and to the end, any\r\nproposition to add any foreign territory, south or west, north or east,\r\nto the States of this Union, as they are constituted and held together\r\nunder the Constitution. I do not want the colonists of England on the\r\nnorth; and as little do I want the population of Mexico on the south. I\r\nresist and reject all, and all with equal resolution. Therefore I say,\r\nthat, if the question were put to me to-day, whether I would take peace\r\nunder the present state of the country, distressed as it is, during the\r\nexistence of a war odious as this is, under circumstances so afflictive\r\nas now exist to humanity, and so disturbing to the business of those\r\nwhom I represent,--I say still, if it were put to me whether I would\r\nhave peace, with new States, I would say, No! no! And that because, Sir,\r\nin my judgment, there is no necessity of being driven into that dilemma.\r\nOther gentlemen think differently. I hold no man's conscience; but I\r\nmean to make a clean breast of it myself; and I protest that I see no\r\nreason, I believe there is none, why we cannot obtain as safe a peace,\r\nas honorable and as prompt a peace, without territory as with it. The\r\ntwo things are separable. There is no necessary connection between them.\r\nMexico does not wish us to take her territory, while she receives our\r\nmoney. Far from it. She yields her assent, if she yields it at all,\r\nreluctantly, and we all know it. It is the result of force, and there is\r\nno man here who does not know that. And let me say, Sir, that, if this\r\nTrist paper shall finally be rejected in Mexico, it is most likely to be\r\nbecause those who under our protection hold the power there cannot\r\npersuade the Mexican Congress or people to agree to this cession of\r\nterritory. The thing most likely to break up what we now expect to take\r\nplace is the repugnance of the Mexican people to part with their\r\nterritory. They would prefer to keep their territory, and that we should\r\nkeep our money; as I prefer we should keep our money, and they their\r\nterritory. We shall see. I pretend to no powers of prediction. I do not\r\nknow what may happen. The times are full of strange events. But I think\r\nit certain that, if the treaty which has gone to Mexico shall fail to be\r\nratified, it will be because of the aversion of the Mexican Congress, or\r\nthe Mexican people, to cede the territory, or any part of it, belonging\r\nto their republic.\r\n\r\nI have said that I would rather have no peace for the present, than have\r\na peace which brings territory for new States; and the reason is, that\r\nwe shall get peace as soon without territory as with it, more safe, more\r\ndurable, and vastly more honorable to us, the great republic of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBut we hear gentlemen say, We must have some territory, the people\r\ndemand it. I deny it; at least, I see no proof of it whatever. I do not\r\ndoubt that there are individuals of an enterprising character, disposed\r\nto emigrate, who know nothing about New Mexico but that it is far off,\r\nand nothing about California but that it is still farther off, who are\r\ntired of the dull pursuits of agriculture and of civil life; that there\r\nare hundreds and thousands of such persons to whom whatsoever is new and\r\ndistant is attractive. They feel the spirit of borderers; and the spirit\r\nof a borderer, I take it, is to be tolerably contented with his\r\ncondition where he is, until somebody goes to regions beyond him; and\r\nthen he is all eagerness to take up his traps and go still farther than\r\nhe who has thus got in advance of him. With such men the desire to\r\nemigrate is an irresistible passion. At least so thought that sagacious\r\nobserver of human nature, M. de Talleyrand, when he travelled in this\r\ncountry in 1794.\r\n\r\nBut I say I do not find anywhere any considerable and respectable body\r\nof persons who want more territory, and such territory. Twenty-four of\r\nus last year in this house voted against the prosecution of the war for\r\nterritory, because we did not want it, both Southern and Northern men. I\r\nbelieve the Southern gentlemen who concurred in that vote found\r\nthemselves, even when they had gone against what might be supposed to be\r\nlocal feelings and partialities, sustained on the general policy of not\r\nseeking territory, and by the acquisition of territory bringing into our\r\npolitics certain embarrassing and embroiling questions and\r\nconsiderations. I do not learn that they suffered from the advocacy of\r\nsuch a sentiment. I believe they were supported in it; and I believe\r\nthat through the greater part of the South, and even of the Southwest,\r\nthere is no prevalent opinion in favor of acquiring territory, and such\r\nterritory, and of the augmentation of our population by such an\r\naccession. And such, I need not say, is, if not the undivided, the\r\npreponderating sentiment of all the North.\r\n\r\nBut it is said we must take territory for the sake of peace. We must\r\ntake territory. It is the will of the President. If we do not now take\r\nwhat he offers, we may fare worse. Mr. Polk will take no less, that he\r\nis fixed upon, He is immovable. He--has--put--down--his--foot! Well,\r\nSir, he put it down upon \"fifty-four forty,\" but it didn't stay. I speak\r\nof the President, as of all Presidents, without disrespect. I know of no\r\nreason why his opinion and his will, his purpose, declared to be final,\r\nshould control us, any more than our purpose, from equally conscientious\r\nmotives, and under as high responsibilities, should control him. We\r\nthink he is firm, and will not be moved. I should be sorry, Sir, very\r\nsorry indeed, that we should entertain more respect for the firmness of\r\nthe individual at the head of the government than we entertain for our\r\nown firmness. He stands out against us. Do we fear to stand out against\r\nhim? For one, I do not. It appears to me to be a slavish doctrine. For\r\none, I am willing to meet the issue, and go to the people all over this\r\nbroad land. Shall we take peace without new States, or refuse peace\r\nwithout new States? I will stand upon that, and trust the people. And I\r\ndo that because I think it right, and because I have no distrust of the\r\npeople. I am not unwilling to put it to their sovereign decision and\r\narbitration. I hold this to be a question vital, permanent, elementary,\r\nin the future prosperity of the country and the maintenance of the\r\nConstitution; and I am willing to trust that question to the people. I\r\nprefer that it should go to them, because, if what I take to be a great\r\nconstitutional principle, or what is essential to its maintenance, is to\r\nbe broken down, let it be the act of the people themselves; it shall\r\nnever be my act. I, therefore, do not distrust the people. I am willing\r\nto take their sentiment, from the Gulf to the British Provinces, and\r\nfrom the ocean to the Missouri: Will you continue the war for territory,\r\nto be purchased, after all, at an enormous price, a price a thousand\r\ntimes the value of all its purchases, or take peace, contenting\r\nyourselves with the honor we have reaped by the military achievements of\r\nthe army? Will you take peace without territory, and preserve the\r\nintegrity of the Constitution of the country? I am entirely willing to\r\nstand upon that question. I will therefore take the issue: _Peace, with\r\nno new States, keeping our own money ourselves, or war till new States\r\nshall be acquired, and vast sums paid._ That is the true issue. I am\r\nwilling to leave that before the people and to the people, because it is\r\na question for themselves. If they support me and think with me, very\r\nwell. If otherwise, if they will have territory and add new States to\r\nthe Union, let them do so; and let them be the artificers of their own\r\nfortune, for good or for evil.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, we tremble before executive power. The truth cannot be\r\nconcealed. We tremble before executive power! Mr. Polk will take no less\r\nthan this. If we do not take this, the king's anger may kindle, and he\r\nwill give us what is worse.\r\n\r\nBut now, Sir, who and what is Mr. Polk? I speak of him with no manner of\r\ndisrespect. I mean, thereby, only to ask who and what is the President\r\nof the United States for the current moment. He is in the last year of\r\nhis administration. Formally, officially, it can only be drawn out till\r\nthe fourth of March, while really and substantially we know that two\r\nshort months will, or may, produce events that will render the duration\r\nof that official term of very little importance. We are on the eve of a\r\nPresidential election. That machinery which is employed to collect\r\npublic opinion or party opinion will be put in operation two months\r\nhence. We shall see its result. It may be that the present incumbent of\r\nthe Presidential office will be again presented to his party friends and\r\nadmirers for their suffrages for the next Presidential term. I do not\r\nsay how probable or improbable this is. Perhaps it is not entirely\r\nprobable. Suppose this not to be the result, what then? Why, then Mr.\r\nPolk becomes as absolutely insignificant as any respectable man among\r\nthe public men of the United States. Honored in private life, valued for\r\nhis private character, respectable, never eminent, in public life, he\r\nwill, from the moment a new star arises, have just as little influence\r\nas you or I; and, so far as I am concerned, that certainly is little\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nSir, political partisans, and aspirants, and office-seekers, are not\r\nsunflowers. They do not\r\n\r\n                \"turn to their god when he sets\r\n    The same look which they turned when he rose.\"\r\n\r\nNo, Sir, if the respectable gentleman now at the head of the government\r\nbe nominated, there will be those who will commend his consistency, who\r\nwill be bound to maintain it, for the interest of his party friends will\r\nrequire it. It will be done. If otherwise, who is there in the whole\r\nlength and breadth of the land that will care for the consistency of the\r\npresent incumbent of the office? There will then be new objects.\r\n\"Manifest destiny\" will have pointed out some other man. Sir, the\r\neulogies are now written, the commendations are already elaborated. I do\r\nnot say every thing fulsome, but every thing panegyrical, has already\r\nbeen written out, with _blanks_ for names, to be filled when the\r\nconvention shall adjourn. When \"manifest destiny\" shall be unrolled, all\r\nthese strong panegyrics, wherever they may light, made beforehand, laid\r\nup in pigeon-holes, studied, framed, emblazoned, and embossed, will all\r\ncome out; and then there will be found to be somebody in the United\r\nStates whose merits have been strangely overlooked, marked out by\r\nProvidence, a kind of miracle, while all will wonder that nobody ever\r\nthought of him before, as a fit, and the only fit, man to be at the head\r\nof this great republic!\r\n\r\nI shrink not, therefore, from any thing that I feel to be my duty, from\r\nany apprehension of the importance and imposing dignity, and the power\r\nof will, ascribed to the present incumbent of office. But I wish we\r\npossessed that power of will. I wish we had that firmness. Yes, Sir, I\r\nwish we had adherence. I wish we could gather something from the spirit\r\nof our brave forces, who have met the enemy under circumstances most\r\nadverse and have stood the shock. I wish we could imitate Zachary Taylor\r\nin his bivouac on the field of Buena Vista. He said he \"would remain for\r\nthe night; he would feel the enemy in the morning, and try his\r\nposition.\" I wish, before we surrender, we could make up _our_ minds to\r\n\"_feel_ the enemy, and try his position,\" and I think we should find\r\nhim, as Taylor did, under the early sun, on his way to San Luis Potosi.\r\nThat is my judgment.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, I come to the all-absorbing question, more particularly, of\r\nthe creation of New States.\r\n\r\nSome years before I entered public life, Louisiana had been obtained\r\nunder the treaty with France. Shortly after, Florida was obtained under\r\nthe treaty with Spain. These two countries were situated on our\r\nfrontier, and commanded the outlets of the great rivers which flow into\r\nthe Gulf. As I have had occasion to say, in the first of these\r\ninstances, the President of the United States[1] supposed that an\r\namendment of the Constitution was required. He acted upon that\r\nsupposition. Mr. Madison was Secretary of State, and, upon the\r\nsuggestion of the President, proposed that the proper amendment to the\r\nConstitution should be submitted, to bring Louisiana into the Union. Mr.\r\nMadison drew it, and submitted it to Mr. Adams, as I have understood.\r\nMr. Madison did not go upon any general idea that new States might be\r\nadmitted; he did not proceed to a general amendment of the Constitution\r\nin that respect. The amendment which he proposed and submitted to Mr.\r\nAdams was a simple declaration, by a new article, that \"the Province of\r\nLouisiana is hereby declared to be part and parcel of the United\r\nStates.\" But public opinion, seeing the great importance of the\r\nacquisition, took a turn favorable to the affirmation of the power. The\r\nact was acquiesced in, and Louisiana became a part of the Union, without\r\nany amendment of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nOn the example of Louisiana, Florida was admitted.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I consider those transactions as passed, settled, legalized.\r\nThere they stand as matters of political history. They are facts against\r\nwhich it would be idle at this day to contend.\r\n\r\nMy first agency in matters of this kind was upon the proposition for\r\nadmitting Texas into this Union. That I thought it my duty to oppose,\r\nupon the general ground of opposing all formation of new States out of\r\nforeign territory, and, I may add, and I ought to add in justice, of\r\nStates in which slaves were to be represented in the Congress of the\r\nUnited States. I was opposed to this on the ground of its inequality. It\r\nhappened to me, Sir, to be called upon to address a political meeting in\r\nNew York, in 1837, soon after the recognition of Texan Independence. I\r\nstate now, Sir, what I have often stated before, that no man, from the\r\nfirst, has been a more sincere well-wisher to the government and the\r\npeople of Texas than myself. I looked upon the achievement of their\r\nindependence in the battle of San Jacinto as an extraordinary, almost a\r\nmarvellous, incident in the affairs of mankind. I was among the first\r\ndisposed to acknowledge her independence. But from the first, down to\r\nthis moment, I have opposed, as far as I was able, the annexation of new\r\nStates to this Union. I stated my reasons on the occasion now referred\r\nto, in language which I have now before me, and which I beg to present\r\nto the Senate.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Webster here read the passage from his speech at Niblo's\r\n     Saloon, New York, which will be found in a previous part of this\r\n     work, pages 429, 430, beginning, \"But it cannot be disguised,\r\n     Gentlemen, that a desire, or an intention, is already manifested to\r\n     annex Texas to the United States.\"\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, for a few years I held a position in the executive\r\nadministration of the government. I left the Department of State in\r\n1843, in the month of May. Within a month after, another (an intelligent\r\ngentleman, for whom I cherished a high respect, and who came to a sad\r\nand untimely end) had taken my place, I had occasion to know, not\r\nofficially, but from circumstances, that the annexation of Texas was\r\ntaken up by Mr. Tyler's administration as an administration measure. It\r\nwas pushed, pressed, insisted on; and I believe the honorable gentleman\r\nto whom I have referred[2] had something like a passion for the\r\naccomplishment of this purpose. And I am afraid that the President of\r\nthe United States[3] at that time suffered his ardent feelings not a\r\nlittle to control his more prudent judgment. At any rate, I saw, in\r\n1843, that annexation had become a purpose of the administration. I was\r\nnot in Congress nor in public life. But, seeing this state of things, I\r\nthought it my duty to admonish the country, so far as I could, of the\r\nexistence of that purpose. There are gentlemen at the North, many of\r\nthem, there are gentlemen now in the Capitol, who know that, in the\r\nsummer of 1843, being fully persuaded that this purpose was embraced\r\nwith zeal and determination by the executive department of the\r\ngovernment of the United States, I thought it my duty, and asked them to\r\nconcur with me in the attempt, to make that purpose known to the\r\ncountry. I conferred with gentlemen of distinction and influence. I\r\nproposed means for exciting public attention to the question of\r\nannexation, before it should have become a party question; for I had\r\nlearned that, when any topic becomes a party question, it is in vain to\r\nargue upon it.\r\n\r\nBut the optimists and the quietists, and those who said, All things are\r\nwell, and let all things alone, discouraged, discountenanced, and\r\nrepressed any such effort. The North, they said, could take care of\r\nitself; the country could take care of itself, and would not sustain Mr.\r\nTyler in his project of annexation. When the time should come, they\r\nsaid, the power of the North would be felt, and would be found\r\nsufficient to resist and prevent the consummation of the measure. And I\r\ncould now refer to paragraphs and articles in the most respectable and\r\nleading journals of the North, in which it was attempted to produce the\r\nimpression that there was no danger; there could be no addition of new\r\nStates, and men need not alarm themselves about that.\r\n\r\nI was not in Congress, Sir, when the preliminary resolutions, providing\r\nfor the annexation of Texas, passed. I only know that, up to a very\r\nshort period before the passage of those resolutions, the impression in\r\nthat part of the country of which I have spoken was, that no such\r\nmeasure could be adopted. But I have found, in the course of thirty\r\nyears' experience, that whatever measures the executive government may\r\nembrace and push are quite likely to succeed in the end. There is always\r\na giving way somewhere. The executive government acts with uniformity,\r\nwith steadiness, with entire unity of purpose. And sooner or later,\r\noften enough, and, according to my construction of our history, quite\r\ntoo often, it effects its purposes. In this way it becomes the\r\npredominating power of the government.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, just before the commencement of the present administration,\r\nthe resolutions for the annexation of Texas were passed in Congress.\r\nTexas complied with the provisions of those resolutions, and was here,\r\nor the case was here, on the 22d day of December, 1845, for her final\r\nadmission into the Union, as one of the States. I took occasion then to\r\nsay, that I hoped I had shown all proper regard for Texas; that I had\r\nbeen certainly opposed to annexation; that, if I should go over the\r\nwhole matter again, I should have nothing new to add; that I had acted,\r\nall along, under the unanimous declaration of all parties, and of the\r\nlegislature of Massachusetts; that I thought there must be some limit to\r\nthe extent of our territories, and that I wished this country should\r\nexhibit to the world the example of a powerful republic, without\r\ngreediness and hunger of empire. And I added, that while I held, with as\r\nmuch faithfulness as any citizen of the country, to all the original\r\narrangements and compromises of the Constitution under which we live, I\r\nnever could, and I never should, bring myself to be in favor of the\r\nadmission of any States into the Union as slave-holding States; and I\r\nmight have added, any States at all, to be formed out of territories not\r\nnow belonging to us.\r\n\r\nNow, as I have said, in all this I acted under the resolutions of the\r\nState of Massachusetts, certainly concurrent with my own judgment, so\r\noften repeated, and reaffirmed by the unanimous consent of all men of\r\nall parties, that I could not well go through the series, pointing out,\r\nnot only the impolicy, but the unconstitutionality, of such annexation.\r\nIf a State proposes to come into the Union, and to come in as a slave\r\nState, then there is an augmentation of the inequality in the\r\nrepresentation of the people; an inequality already existing, with which\r\nI do not quarrel, and which I never will attempt to alter, but shall\r\npreserve as long as I have a vote to give, or any voice in this\r\ngovernment, because it is a part of the original compact. Let it stand.\r\nBut then there is another consideration of vastly more general\r\nimportance even than that; more general, because it affects all the\r\nStates, free and slave-holding; and it is, that, if States formed out of\r\nterritories thus thinly populated come into the Union, they necessarily\r\nand inevitably break up the relation existing between the two branches\r\nof the government, and destroy its balance. They break up the intended\r\nrelation between the Senate and the House of Representatives. If you\r\nbring in new States, any State that comes in must have two Senators. She\r\nmay come in with fifty or sixty thousand people, or more. You may have,\r\nfrom a particular State, more Senators than you have Representatives.\r\nCan any thing occur to disfigure and derange the form of government\r\nunder which we live more signally than that? Here would be a Senate\r\nbearing no proportion to the people, out of all relation to them, by the\r\naddition of new States; from some of them only one Representative,\r\nperhaps, and two Senators, whereas the larger States may have ten,\r\nfifteen, or even thirty Representatives, and but two Senators. The\r\nSenate, augmented by these new Senators coming from States where there\r\nare few people, becomes an odious oligarchy. It holds power without any\r\nadequate constituency. Sir, it is but \"borough-mongering\" upon a large\r\nscale. Now, I do not depend upon theory; I ask the Senate and the\r\ncountry to look at facts, to see where we were when we made our\r\ndeparture three years ago, and where we now are; and I leave it to the\r\nimagination to conjecture where we shall be.\r\n\r\nWe admitted Texas,--one State for the present; but, Sir, if you refer to\r\nthe resolutions providing for the annexation of Texas, you find a\r\nprovision that it shall be in the power of Congress hereafter to make\r\nfour new States out of Texan territory. Present and prospectively, five\r\nnew States, with ten Senators, may come into the Union out of Texas.\r\nThree years ago we did this; we now propose to make two States.\r\nUndoubtedly, if we take, as the President recommends, New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia, there must then be four new Senators. We shall then have\r\nprovided, in these territories out of the United States along our\r\nsouthern borders, for the creation of States enough to send fourteen\r\nSenators into this chamber. Now, what will be the relation between these\r\nSenators and the people they represent, or the States from which they\r\ncome? I do not understand that there is any very accurate census of\r\nTexas. It is generally supposed to contain one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand persons. I doubt whether it contains above one hundred\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\n     MR. MANGUM. It contains one hundred and forty-nine thousand.\r\n\r\nMy honorable friend on my left says, a hundred and forty-nine thousand.\r\nI put it down, then, one hundred and fifty thousand. Well, Sir, Texas is\r\nnot destined, probably, to be a country of dense population. We will\r\nsuppose it to have at the present time a population of near one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand. New Mexico may have sixty or seventy thousand\r\ninhabitants; say seventy thousand. In California, there are not supposed\r\nto be above twenty-five thousand men; but undoubtedly, if this territory\r\nshould become ours, persons from Oregon, and from our Western States,\r\nwill find their way to San Francisco, where there is some good land, and\r\nwe may suppose they will shortly amount to sixty or seventy thousand. We\r\nwill put them down at seventy thousand. Then the whole territory in this\r\nestimate, which is as high as any man puts it, will contain two hundred\r\nand ninety thousand persons, and they will send us, whenever we ask for\r\nthem, fourteen Senators; a population less than that of the State of\r\nVermont, and not the eighth part of that of New York. Fourteen Senators,\r\nand not as many people as Vermont, and no more people than New\r\nHampshire! and not so many people as the good State of New Jersey!\r\n\r\nBut then, Sir, Texas claims to the line of the Rio Grande, and if it be\r\nher true line, why then of course she absorbs a considerable part, nay,\r\nthe greater part, of the population of what is now called New Mexico. I\r\ndo not argue the question of the true southern or western line of Texas;\r\nI only say, that it is apparent to everybody who will look at the map,\r\nand learn any thing of the matter, that New Mexico cannot be divided by\r\nthis river, the Rio Grande, which is a shallow, fordable, insignificant\r\nstream, creeping along through a narrow valley, at the base of enormous\r\nmountains. New Mexico must remain together; it must be a State, with its\r\nseventy thousand people, and so it will be; and so will California.\r\n\r\nBut then, Sir, suppose Texas to remain a unit, and but one State for the\r\npresent; still we shall have three States, Texas, New Mexico, and\r\nCalifornia. We shall have six Senators, then, for less than three\r\nhundred thousand people. We shall have as many Senators for three\r\nhundred thousand people in that region as we have for New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and Ohio, with four or five millions of people; and that\r\nis what we call an equal representation! Is not this enormous? Have\r\ngentlemen considered this? Have they looked at it? Are they willing to\r\nlook it in the face, and then say they embrace it? I trust, Sir, the\r\npeople will look at it and consider it. And now let me add, that this\r\ndisproportion can never be diminished; it must remain for ever. How are\r\nyou going to diminish it? Why, here is Texas, with a hundred and\r\nforty-nine thousand people, with one State. Suppose that population\r\nshould flow into Texas, where will it go? Not to any dense point, but\r\nto be spread over all that region, in places remote from the Gulf, in\r\nplaces remote from what is now the capital of Texas; and therefore, as\r\nsoon as there are in other portions of Texas people enough within our\r\ncommon construction of the Constitution and our practice in respect to\r\nthe admission of States, my honorable friend from Texas[4] will have a\r\nnew State, and I have no doubt he has chalked it out already.\r\n\r\nAs to New Mexico, its population is not likely to increase. It is a\r\nsettled country; the people living along in the bottom of the valley on\r\nthe sides of a little stream, a garter of land only on one side and the\r\nother, filled by coarse landholders and miserable _peons_. It can\r\nsustain, not only under this cultivation, but under any cultivation that\r\nour American race would ever submit to, no more people than are there\r\nnow. There will, then, be two Senators for sixty thousand inhabitants in\r\nNew Mexico to the end of our lives and to the end of the lives of our\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAnd how is it with California? We propose to take California, from the\r\nforty-second degree of north latitude down to the thirty-second. We\r\npropose to take ten degrees along the coast of the Pacific. Scattered\r\nalong the coast for that great distance are settlements and villages and\r\nports; and in the rear all is wilderness and barrenness, and Indian\r\ncountry. But if, just about San Francisco, and perhaps Monterey,\r\nemigrants enough should settle to make up one State, then the people\r\nfive hundred miles off would have another State. And so this\r\ndisproportion of the Senate to the people will go on, and must go on,\r\nand we cannot prevent it.\r\n\r\nI say, Sir, that, according to my conscientious conviction, we are now\r\nfixing on the Constitution of the United States, and its frame of\r\ngovernment, a monstrosity, a disfiguration, an enormity! Sir, I hardly\r\ndare trust myself. I don't know but I may be under some delusion. It may\r\nbe the weakness of my eyes that forms this monstrous apparition. But, if\r\nI may trust myself, if I can persuade myself that I am in my right mind,\r\nthen it does appear to me that we in this Senate have been and are\r\nacting, and are likely to be acting hereafter, and immediately, a part\r\nwhich will form the most remarkable epoch in the history of our country.\r\nI hold it to be enormous, flagrant, an outrage upon all the principles\r\nof popular republican government, and on the elementary provisions of\r\nthe Constitution under which we live, and which we have sworn to\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nBut then, Sir, what relieves the case from this enormity? What is our\r\nreliance? Why, it is that we stipulate that these new States shall only\r\nbe brought in at a suitable time. And pray, what is to constitute the\r\nsuitableness of time? Who is to judge of it? I tell you, Sir, that\r\nsuitable time will come when the preponderance of party power here makes\r\nit necessary to bring in new States. Be assured it will be a suitable\r\ntime when votes are wanted in this Senate. We have had some little\r\nexperience of that. Texas came in at a \"suitable time,\" a _very_\r\nsuitable time! Texas was finally admitted in December, 1845. My friend\r\nnear me here, for whom I have a great regard, and whose acquaintance I\r\nhave cultivated with pleasure,[5] took his seat in March, 1846, with his\r\ncolleague. In July, 1846, these two Texan votes turned the balance in\r\nthe Senate, and overthrew the tariff of 1842, in my judgment the best\r\nsystem of revenue ever established in this country. Gentlemen on the\r\nopposite side think otherwise. They think it fortunate. They think that\r\nwas a suitable time, and they mean to take care that other times shall\r\nbe equally suitable. I understand it perfectly well. That is the\r\ndifference of opinion between me and these honorable gentlemen. To their\r\npolicy, their objects, and their purposes the time was _suitable_, and\r\nthe aid was efficient and decisive.\r\n\r\nSir, in 1850 perhaps a similar question may be agitated here. It is not\r\nlikely to be before that time, but agitated it will be then, unless a\r\nchange in the administration of the government shall take place.\r\nAccording to my apprehension, looking at general results as flowing from\r\nour established system of commerce and revenue, in two years from this\r\ntime we shall probably be engaged in a new revision of our system: in\r\nthe work of establishing, if we can, a tariff of specific duties; of\r\nprotecting, if we can, our domestic industry and the manufactures of the\r\ncountry; in the work of preventing, if we can, the overwhelming flood of\r\nforeign importations. Suppose that to be part of the future: that would\r\nbe exactly the \"suitable time,\" if necessary, for two Senators from New\r\nMexico to make their appearance here!\r\n\r\nBut, again, we hear another halcyon, soothing tone, which quiets none of\r\nmy alarms, assuages none of my apprehensions, commends me to my nightly\r\nrest with no more resignation. And that is, the plea that we may trust\r\nthe popular branch of the legislature, we may look to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, to the Northern and Middle States and even the sound\r\nmen of the South, and trust them to take care that States be not\r\nadmitted sooner than they should be, or for party purposes. I am\r\ncompelled, by experience, to distrust all such reliances. If we cannot\r\nrely on ourselves, when we have the clear constitutional authority\r\ncompetent to carry us through, and the motives intensely powerful, I beg\r\nto know how we can rely on others. Have we more reliance on the\r\npatriotism, the firmness, of others, than on our own?\r\n\r\nBesides, experience shows us that things of this sort may be _sprung_\r\nupon Congress and the people. It was so in the case of Texas. It was so\r\nin the Twenty-eighth Congress. The members of that Congress were not\r\nchosen to decide the question of annexation or no annexation. They came\r\nin on other grounds, political and party, and were supported for reasons\r\nnot connected with that question. What then? The administration sprung\r\nupon them the question of annexation. It obtained a _snap_ judgment upon\r\nit, and carried the measure of annexation. That is indubitable, as I\r\ncould show by many instances, of which I shall state only one.\r\n\r\nFour gentlemen from the State of Connecticut were elected before the\r\nquestion arose, belonging to the dominant party. They had not been here\r\nlong before they were committed to annexation; and when it was known in\r\nConnecticut that annexation was in contemplation, remonstrances,\r\nprivate, public, and legislative, were uttered, in tones that any one\r\ncould hear who could hear thunder. Did they move them? Not at all. Every\r\none of them voted for annexation! The election came on, and they were\r\nturned out, to a man. But what did those care who had had the benefit of\r\ntheir votes? Such agencies, if it be not more proper to call them such\r\ninstrumentalities, retain respect no longer than they continue to be\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nSir, we take New Mexico and California; who is weak enough to suppose\r\nthat there is an end? Don't we hear it avowed every day, that it would\r\nbe proper also to take Sonora, Tamaulipas, and other provinces of\r\nNorthern Mexico? Who thinks that the hunger for dominion will stop here\r\nof itself? It is said, to be sure, that our present acquisitions will\r\nprove so lean and unsatisfactory, that we shall seek no further. In my\r\njudgment, we may as well say of a rapacious animal, that, if he has made\r\none unproductive hunt, he will not try for a better foray.\r\n\r\nBut further. There are some things one can argue against with temper,\r\nand submit to, if overruled, without mortification. There are other\r\nthings that seem to affect one's consciousness of being a sensible man,\r\nand to imply a disposition to impose upon his common sense. And of this\r\nclass of topics, or pretences, I have never heard of any thing, and I\r\ncannot conceive of any thing, more ridiculous in itself, more absurd,\r\nand more affrontive to all sober judgment, than the cry that we are\r\ngetting indemnity by the acquisition of New Mexico and California. I\r\nhold they are not worth a dollar; and we pay for them vast sums of\r\nmoney! We have expended, as everybody knows, large treasures in the\r\nprosecution of the war; and now what is to constitute this indemnity?\r\nWhat do gentlemen mean by it? Let us see a little how this stands. We\r\nget a country; we get, in the first instance, a cession, or an\r\nacknowledgment of boundary, (I care not which way you state it,) of the\r\ncountry between the Nueces and the Rio Grande. What this country is\r\nappears from a publication made by a gentleman in the other house.[6] He\r\nspeaks of the country in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n     \"The country from the Nueces to the valley of the Rio Grande is\r\n     poor, sterile, sandy, and barren, with not a single tree of any\r\n     size or value on our whole route. The only tree which we saw was\r\n     the musquit-tree, and very few of these. The musquit is a small\r\n     tree, resembling an old and decayed peach-tree. The whole country\r\n     may be truly called a perfect waste, uninhabited and uninhabitable.\r\n     There is not a drop of running water between the two rivers, except\r\n     in the two small streams of San Salvador and Santa Gertrudis, and\r\n     these only contain water in the rainy season. Neither of them had\r\n     running water when we passed them. The _chaparral_ commences within\r\n     forty or fifty miles of the Rio Grande. This is poor, rocky, and\r\n     sandy; covered with prickly-pear, thistles, and almost every\r\n     sticking thing, constituting a thick and perfectly impenetrable\r\n     undergrowth. For any useful or agricultural purpose, the country is\r\n     not worth a _sous_.\r\n\r\n     \"So far as we were able to form any opinion of this desert upon the\r\n     other routes which had been travelled, its character, everywhere\r\n     between the two rivers, is pretty much the same. We learned that\r\n     the route pursued by General Taylor, south of ours, was through a\r\n     country similar to that through which we passed; as also was that\r\n     travelled by General Wool from San Antonio to Presidio on the Rio\r\n     Grande. From what we both saw and heard, the whole command came to\r\n     the conclusion which I have already expressed, that it was worth\r\n     _nothing_. I have no hesitation in saying, that I would not hazard\r\n     the life of one valuable and useful man for every foot of land\r\n     between San Patricio and the valley of the Rio Grande. The country\r\n     is not now, and can never be, of the _slightest value_.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Gaines has been there lately. He is a competent observer. He is\r\ncontradicted by nobody. And so far as that country is concerned, I take\r\nit for granted that it is not worth a dollar.\r\n\r\nNow of New Mexico, what of that! Forty-nine fiftieths, at least, of the\r\nwhole of New Mexico, are a barren waste, a desert plain of mountain,\r\nwith no wood, no timber. Little fagots for lighting a fire are carried\r\nthirty or forty miles on mules. There is no fall of rain there, as in\r\ntemperate climates. It is Asiatic in scenery altogether: enormously high\r\nmountains, running up some of them ten thousand feet, with narrow\r\nvalleys at their bases, through which streams sometimes trickle along. A\r\nstrip, a garter, winds along, through which runs the Rio Grande, from\r\nfar away up in the Rocky Mountains to latitude 33°, a distance of three\r\nor four hundred miles. There these sixty thousand persons reside. In the\r\nmountains on the right and left are streams which, obeying the natural\r\ntendency as tributaries, should flow into the Rio Grande, and which, in\r\ncertain seasons, when rains are abundant, do, some of them, actually\r\nreach the Rio Grande; while the greater part always, and all for the\r\ngreater part of the year, never reach an outlet to the sea, but are\r\nabsorbed in the sands and desert plains of the country. There is no\r\ncultivation there. There is cultivation where there is artificial\r\nwatering or irrigation, and nowhere else. Men can live only in the\r\nnarrow valley, and in the gorges of the mountains which rise round it,\r\nand not along the course of the streams which lose themselves in the\r\nsands.\r\n\r\nNow there is no public domain in New Mexico, not a foot of land, to the\r\nsoil of which we shall obtain title. Not an acre becomes ours when the\r\ncountry becomes ours. More than that, the country is as full of people,\r\nsuch as they are, as it is likely to be. There is not the least thing in\r\nit to invite settlement from the fertile valley of the Mississippi. And\r\nI undertake to say, there would not be two hundred families of persons\r\nwho would emigrate from the United States to New Mexico, for\r\nagricultural purposes, in fifty years. They could not live there.\r\nSuppose they were to cultivate the lands; they could only make them\r\nproductive in a slight degree by irrigation or artificial watering. The\r\npeople there produce little, and live on little. That is not the\r\ncharacteristic, I take it, of the people of the Eastern or of the Middle\r\nStates, or of the Valley of the Mississippi. They produce a good deal,\r\nand they consume a good deal.\r\n\r\nAgain, Sir, New Mexico is not like Texas. I have hoped, and I still\r\nhope, that Texas will be filled up from among ourselves, not with\r\nSpaniards, not with _peons_; that its inhabitants will not be Mexican\r\nlandlords, with troops of slaves, predial or otherwise.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Rusk here rose, and said that he disliked to interrupt the\r\n     Senator, and therefore he had said nothing while he was describing\r\n     the country between the Nueces and the Rio Grande; but he wished\r\n     now to say, that, when that country comes to be known, it will be\r\n     found to be as valuable as any part of Texas. The valley of the Rio\r\n     Grande is valuable from its source to its mouth. But he did not\r\n     look upon _that_ as indemnity; he claimed that as the _right_ of\r\n     Texas. So far as the Mexican population is concerned, there is a\r\n     good deal of it in Texas; and it comprises many respectable\r\n     persons, wealthy, intelligent, and distinguished. A good many are\r\n     now moving in from New Mexico, and settling in Texas.\r\n\r\nI take what I say from Major Gaines. But I am glad to hear that any part\r\nof New Mexico is fit for the foot of civilized man. And I am glad,\r\nmoreover, that there are some persons in New Mexico who are not so\r\nblindly attached to their miserable condition as not to make an effort\r\nto come out of their country, and get into a better.\r\n\r\nSir, I would, if I had time, call the attention of the Senate to an\r\ninstructive speech made in the other house by Mr. Smith of Connecticut.\r\nHe seems to have examined all the authorities, to have conversed with\r\nall the travellers, to have corresponded with all our agents. His speech\r\ncontains communications from all of them; and I commend it to every man\r\nin the United States who wishes to know what we are about to acquire by\r\nthe annexation of New Mexico.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico is secluded, isolated, a place by itself, in the midst and at\r\nthe foot of vast mountains, five hundred miles from the settled part of\r\nTexas, and as far from anywhere else! It does not belong anywhere! It\r\nhas no _belongings_ about it! At this moment it is absolutely more\r\nretired and shut out from communication with the civilized world than\r\nHawaii or any of the other islands of the Pacific sea. In seclusion and\r\nremoteness, New Mexico may press hard on the character and condition of\r\nTypee. And its people are infinitely less elevated, in morals and\r\ncondition, than the people of the Sandwich Islands. We had much better\r\nhave Senators from Oahu. They are far less intelligent than the better\r\nclass of our Indian neighbors. Commend me to the Cherokees, to the\r\nChoctaws; if you please, speak of the Pawnees, of the Snakes, the\r\nFlatfeet, of any thing but the _Digging_ Indians, and I will be\r\nsatisfied not to take the people of New Mexico. Have they any notion of\r\nour institutions, or of _any_ free institutions? Have they any notion of\r\npopular government? Not the slightest! Not the slightest on earth! When\r\nthe question is asked, What will be their constitution? it is farcical\r\nto talk of such people making a constitution for themselves. They do not\r\nknow the meaning of the term, they do not know its import. They know\r\nnothing at all about it; and I can tell you, Sir, that when they are\r\nmade a Territory, and are to be made a State, such a constitution as the\r\nexecutive power of this government may think fit to send them will be\r\nsent, and will be adopted. The constitution of our _fellow citizens_ of\r\nNew Mexico will be framed in the city of Washington.\r\n\r\nNow what says in regard to all Mexico Colonel Hardin, that most lamented\r\nand distinguished officer, honorably known as a member of the other\r\nhouse, and who has fallen gallantly fighting in the service of his\r\ncountry? Here is his description:--\r\n\r\n     \"The whole country is miserably watered. Large districts have no\r\n     water at all. The streams are small, and at great distances apart.\r\n     One day we marched on the road from Monclova to Parras thirty-five\r\n     miles without water, a pretty severe day's marching for infantry.\r\n\r\n     \"Grass is very scarce, and indeed there is none at all in many\r\n     regions for miles square. Its place is supplied with prickly-pear\r\n     and thorny bushes. There is not one acre in two hundred, more\r\n     probably not one in five hundred, of all the land we have seen in\r\n     Mexico, which can ever be cultivated; the greater portion of it is\r\n     the most desolate region I could ever have imagined. The pure\r\n     granite hills of New England are a paradise to it, for they are\r\n     without the thorny briers and venomous reptiles which infest the\r\n     barbed barrenness of Mexico. The good land and cultivated spots in\r\n     Mexico are but dots on the map. Were it not that it takes so very\r\n     little to support a Mexican, and that the land which is cultivated\r\n     yields its produce with little labor, it would be surprising how\r\n     its sparse population is sustained. All the towns we have visited,\r\n     with perhaps the exception of Parras, are depopulating, as is also\r\n     the whole country.\r\n\r\n     \"The people are on a par with their land. One in two hundred or\r\n     five hundred is rich, and lives like a nabob; the rest are _peons_,\r\n     or servants sold for debt, who work for their masters, and are as\r\n     subservient as the slaves of the South, and look like Indians, and,\r\n     indeed, are not more capable of self-government. One man, Jacobus\r\n     Sanchez, owns three fourths of all the land our column has passed\r\n     over in Mexico. We are told we have seen the best part of Northern\r\n     Mexico; if so, the whole of it is not worth much.\r\n\r\n     \"I came to Mexico in favor of getting or taking enough of it to pay\r\n     the expenses of the war. I now doubt whether all Northern Mexico is\r\n     worth the expenses of our column of three thousand men. The\r\n     expenses of the war must be enormous; we have paid enormous prices\r\n     for every thing, much beyond the usual prices of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThere it is. That's all North Mexico; and New Mexico is not the better\r\npart of it.\r\n\r\nSir, there is a recent traveller, not unfriendly to the United States,\r\nif we may judge from his work, for he speaks well of us everywhere; an\r\nEnglishman, named Ruxton. He gives an account of the morals and the\r\nmanners of the population of New Mexico. And, Mr. President and\r\nSenators, I shall take leave to introduce you to these soon to be your\r\nrespected _fellow-citizens_ of New Mexico:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is remarkable that, although existing from the earliest times\r\n     of the colonization of New Mexico, a period of two centuries, in a\r\n     state of continual hostility with the numerous savage tribes of\r\n     Indians who surround their territory, and in constant insecurity of\r\n     life and property from their attacks, being also far removed from\r\n     the enervating influences of large cities, and, in their isolated\r\n     situation, entirely dependent upon their own resources, the\r\n     inhabitants are totally destitute of those qualities which, for the\r\n     above reasons, we might naturally have expected to distinguish\r\n     them, and are as deficient in energy of character and physical\r\n     courage as they are in all the moral and intellectual qualities. In\r\n     their social state but one degree removed from the veriest savages,\r\n     they might take a lesson even from these in morality and the\r\n     conventional decencies of life. Imposing no restraint on their\r\n     passions, a shameless and universal concubinage exists, and a total\r\n     disregard of morality, to which it would be impossible to find a\r\n     parallel in any country calling itself civilized. A want of\r\n     honorable principle, and consummate duplicity and treachery,\r\n     characterize all their dealings. Liars by nature, they are\r\n     treacherous and faithless to their friends, cowardly and cringing\r\n     to their enemies; cruel, as all cowards are, they unite savage\r\n     ferocity with their want of animal courage; as an example of which,\r\n     their recent massacre of Governor Bent, and other Americans, may be\r\n     given, one of a hundred instances.\"\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are soon to be our beloved countrymen!\r\n\r\nMr. President, for a good many years I have struggled in opposition to\r\nevery thing which I thought tended to strengthen the arm of executive\r\npower. I think it is growing more and more formidable every day. And I\r\nthink that by yielding to it in this, as in other instances, we give it\r\na strength which it will be difficult hereafter to resist. I think that\r\nit is nothing less than the fear of executive power which induces us to\r\nacquiesce in the acquisition of territory; fear, _fear_, and nothing\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nIn the little part which I have acted in public life, it has been my\r\npurpose to maintain the people of the United States, what the\r\nConstitution designed to make them, _one people_, one in interest, one\r\nin character, and one in political feeling. If we depart from that, we\r\nbreak it all up. What sympathy can there be between the people of Mexico\r\nand California and the inhabitants of the Valley of the Mississippi and\r\nthe Eastern States in the choice of a President? Do they know the same\r\nman? Do they concur in any general constitutional principles? Not at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nArbitrary governments may have territories and distant possessions,\r\nbecause arbitrary governments may rule them by different laws and\r\ndifferent systems. Russia may rule in the Ukraine and the provinces of\r\nthe Caucasus and Kamtschatka by different codes, ordinances, or ukases.\r\nWe can do no such thing. They must be of us, _part_ of us, or else\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\nI think I see that in progress which will disfigure and deform the\r\nConstitution. While these territories remain territories, they will be a\r\ntrouble and an annoyance; they will draw after them vast expenses; they\r\nwill probably require as many troops as we have maintained during the\r\nlast twenty years to defend them against the Indian tribes. We must\r\nmaintain an army at that immense distance. When they shall become\r\nStates, they will be still more likely to give us trouble.\r\n\r\nI think I see a course adopted which is likely to turn the Constitution\r\nof the land into a deformed monster, into a curse rather than a\r\nblessing; in fact, a frame of an unequal government, not founded on\r\npopular representation, not founded on equality, but on the grossest\r\ninequality; and I think that this process will go on, or that there is\r\n_danger_ that it will go on, until this Union shall fall to pieces. I\r\nresist it, to-day and always! Whoever falters or whoever flies, I\r\ncontinue the contest!\r\n\r\nI know, Sir, that all the portents are discouraging. Would to God I\r\ncould auspicate good influences! Would to God that those who think with\r\nme, and myself, could hope for stronger support! Would that we could\r\nstand where we desire to stand! I see the signs are sinister. But with\r\nfew, or alone, my position is fixed. If there were time, I would gladly\r\nawaken the country. I believe the country might be awakened, although it\r\nmay be too late. For myself, supported or unsupported, by the blessing\r\nof God, I shall do my duty. I see well enough all the adverse\r\nindications. But I am sustained by a deep and a conscientious sense of\r\nduty; and while supported by that feeling, and while such great\r\ninterests are at stake, I defy auguries, and ask no omen but my\r\ncountry's cause!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Jefferson.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. Upshur.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mr. Tyler.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Mr. Rusk.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Mr. Rusk.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Major Gaines.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCLUSION OF SLAVERY FROM THE TERRITORIES.\r\n\r\nREMARKS MADE IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, ON THE 12TH OF AUGUST,\r\n1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n[In the course of the first session of the Thirtieth Congress, a bill\r\npassed the House of Representatives to organize a government for the\r\nTerritory of Oregon. This bill received several amendments on its\r\npassage through the Senate, and among them one moved by Mr. Douglass of\r\nIllinois, on the 10th of August, by which the eighth section of the law\r\nof the 6th of March, 1820, for the admission of Missouri, was revived\r\nand adopted, as a part of the bill, and declared to be \"in full force,\r\nand binding, for the future organization of the territories of the\r\nUnited States, in the same sense and with the same understanding with\r\nwhich it was originally adopted.\"\r\n\r\nThis, with some of the other amendments of the Senate, was disagreed to\r\nby the House. On the return of the bill to the Senate, a discussion\r\narose, and continued for several days, on the question of agreement or\r\ndisagreement with the amendments of the House to the Senate's\r\namendments.\r\n\r\nThe principal subject of this discussion was whether the Senate would\r\nrecede from the above-mentioned amendment moved by Mr. Douglass, which\r\nwas finally decided in the affirmative. In these discussions, a\r\nconsiderable portion of which was of a conversational character, Mr.\r\nWebster took a leading part; but of most of what was said by him, as by\r\nother Senators, no report has been preserved. The session of the Senate\r\nat which the last and most animated discussion of this subject took\r\nplace, nominally on Saturday of the 12th of August, was prolonged till\r\nten o'clock, A.M., of Sunday, the 13th. In the course of the debate on\r\nthis day Mr. Webster spoke as follows.]\r\n\r\nI am very little inclined to prolong this debate, and I hope I am\r\nutterly disinclined to bring into it any new warmth or excitement. I\r\nwish to say a few words, however, first, upon the question as it is\r\npresented to us, as a parliamentary question; and secondly, upon the\r\ngeneral political questions involved in the debate.\r\n\r\nAs a question of parliamentary proceeding, I understand the case to be\r\nthis. The House of Representatives sent us a bill for the establishment\r\nof a territorial government in Oregon; and no motion has been made in\r\nthe Senate to strike out any part of that bill. The bill purporting to\r\nrespect Oregon, simply and alone, has not been the subject of any\r\nobjection in this branch of the legislature. The Senate has proposed no\r\nimportant amendment to this bill, affecting Oregon itself; and the\r\nhonorable member from Missouri[1] was right, entirely right, when he\r\nsaid that the amendment now under consideration had no relation to\r\nOregon. That is perfectly true; and therefore the amendment which the\r\nSenate has adopted, and the House has disagreed to, has no connection\r\nwith the immediate subject before it. The truth is, that it is an\r\namendment by which the Senate wished to have now a public, legal\r\ndeclaration, not respecting Oregon, but respecting the newly acquired\r\nterritories of California and New Mexico. It wishes now to make a line\r\nof slavery, which shall include those new territories. The amendment\r\nsays that the line of the \"Missouri Compromise\" shall be the line to the\r\nPacific, and then goes on to say, in the language of the bill as it now\r\nstands, that the Ordinance of 1787 shall be applicable to Oregon; and\r\ntherefore I say that the amendment proposed is foreign to the immediate\r\nobject of the bill. It does nothing to modify, restrain, or affect, in\r\nany way, the government which we propose to establish over Oregon, or\r\nthe condition or character of that government, or of the people under\r\nit. In a parliamentary view, this is the state of the case.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, this amendment has been attached to this bill by a strong\r\nmajority of the Senate. That majority had the right, as it had the\r\npower, to pass it. The House disagreed to that amendment. If the\r\nmajority of the Senate, who attached it to the bill, are of opinion that\r\na conference with the House will lead to some adjustment of the\r\nquestion, by which this amendment, or something equivalent to it, may be\r\nadopted by the House, it is very proper for them to urge a conference.\r\nIt is very fair, quite parliamentary, and there is not a word to be said\r\nagainst it. But my position is that of one who voted against the\r\namendment, who thinks that it ought not to be attached to this bill; and\r\ntherefore I naturally vote for the motion to get rid of it, that is, \"to\r\nrecede.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the parliamentary question. Now there are two or three\r\npolitical questions arising in this case, which I wish to state\r\ndispassionately; not to argue, but to state. The honorable member from\r\nGeorgia,[2] for whom I have great respect, and with whom it is my\r\ndelight to cultivate personal friendship, has stated, with great\r\npropriety, the importance of this question. He has said, that it is a\r\nquestion interesting to the South and to the North, and one which may\r\nvery well also attract the attention of mankind. He has not stated any\r\npart of this too strongly. It is such a question. Without doubt, it is a\r\nquestion which may well attract the attention of mankind. On the\r\nsubjects involved in this debate, the whole world is not now asleep. It\r\nis wide awake; and I agree with the honorable member, that, if what is\r\nnow proposed to be done by us who resist this amendment is, as he\r\nsupposes, unjust and injurious to any portion of this community, or\r\nagainst its constitutional rights, that injustice should be presented to\r\nthe civilized world, and we, who concur in the proceeding, ought to\r\nsubmit ourselves to its rebuke. I am glad that the honorable gentleman\r\nproposes to refer this question to the great tribunal of Modern\r\nCivilization, as well as the great tribunal of the American People. It\r\nis proper. It is a question of magnitude enough, of interest enough, to\r\nall the civilized nations of the earth, to call from those who support\r\nthe one side or the other a statement of the grounds upon which they\r\nact.\r\n\r\nNow I propose to state as briefly as I can the grounds upon which I\r\nproceed, historical and constitutional; and will endeavor to use as few\r\nwords as possible, so that I may relieve the Senate from hearing me at\r\nthe earliest possible moment. In the first place, to view the matter\r\nhistorically. This Constitution, founded in 1787, and the government\r\nunder it, organized in 1789, do recognize the existence of slavery in\r\ncertain States then belonging to the Union, and a particular description\r\nof slavery. I hope that what I am about to say may be received without\r\nany supposition that I intend the slightest disrespect. But this\r\nparticular description of slavery does not, I believe, now exist in\r\nEurope, nor in any other civilized portion of the habitable globe. It is\r\nnot a predial slavery. It is not analogous to the case of the _predial_\r\nslaves, or slaves _glebae adscripti_ of Russia, or Hungary, or other\r\nstates. It is a peculiar system of personal slavery, by which the person\r\nwho is called a slave is transferable as a chattel, from hand to hand. I\r\nspeak of this as a fact; and that is the fact. And I will say further,\r\nperhaps other gentlemen may remember the instances, that although\r\nslavery, as a system of servitude attached to the earth, exists in\r\nvarious countries of Europe, I am not at the present moment aware of any\r\nplace on the globe in which this property of man in a human being as a\r\nslave, transferable as a chattel, exists, except America. Now, that it\r\nexisted, in the form in which it still exists, in certain States, at the\r\nformation of this Constitution, and that the framers of that\r\ninstrument, and those who adopted it, agreed that, as far as it existed,\r\nit should not be disturbed or interfered with by the new general\r\ngovernment, there is no doubt.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of the United States recognizes it as an existing fact,\r\nan existing relation between the inhabitants of the Southern States. I\r\ndo not call it an \"institution,\" because that term is not applicable to\r\nit; for that seems to imply a voluntary establishment. When I first came\r\nhere, it was a matter of frequent reproach to England, the mother\r\ncountry, that slavery had been entailed upon the colonies by her,\r\nagainst their consent, and that which is now considered a cherished\r\n\"institution\" was then regarded as, I will not say an _evil_, but an\r\nentailment on the Colonies by the policy of the mother country against\r\ntheir wishes. At any rate, it stands upon the Constitution. The\r\nConstitution was adopted in 1788, and went into operation in 1789. When\r\nit was adopted, the state of the country was this: slavery existed in\r\nthe Southern States; there was a very large extent of unoccupied\r\nterritory, the whole Northwestern Territory, which, it was understood,\r\nwas destined to be formed into States; and it was then determined that\r\nno slavery should exist in this territory. I gather now, as a matter of\r\ninference from the history of the time and the history of the debates,\r\nthat the prevailing motives with the North for agreeing to this\r\nrecognition of the existence of slavery in the Southern States, and\r\ngiving a representation to those States founded in part upon their\r\nslaves, rested on the supposition that no acquisition of territory would\r\nbe made to form new States on the southern frontier of this country,\r\neither by cession or conquest. No one looked to any acquisition of new\r\nterritory on the southern or southwestern frontier. The exclusion of\r\nslavery from the Northwestern Territory and the prospective abolition of\r\nthe foreign slave trade were generally, the former unanimously, agreed\r\nto; and on the basis of these considerations, the South insisted that\r\nwhere slavery existed it should not be interfered with, and that it\r\nshould have a certain ratio of representation in Congress. And now, Sir,\r\nI am one, who, believing such to be the understanding on which the\r\nConstitution was framed, mean to abide by it.\r\n\r\nThere is another principle, equally clear, by which I mean to abide; and\r\nthat is, that in the Convention, and in the first Congress, when\r\nappealed to on the subject by petitions, and all along in the history of\r\nthis government, it was and has been a conceded point, that slavery in\r\nthe States in which it exists is a matter of State regulation\r\nexclusively, and that Congress has not the least power over it, or right\r\nto interfere with it. Therefore I say, that all agitations and attempts\r\nto disturb the relations between master and slave, by persons not living\r\nin the slave States, are unconstitutional in their spirit, and are, in\r\nmy opinion, productive of nothing but evil and mischief. I countenance\r\nnone of them. The manner in which the governments of those States where\r\nslavery exists are to regulate it, is for their own consideration, under\r\ntheir responsibility to their constituents, to the general laws of\r\npropriety, humanity, and justice, and to God. Associations formed\r\nelsewhere, springing from a feeling of humanity, or any other cause,\r\nhave nothing whatever to do with it, nor right to interfere with it.\r\nThey have never received any encouragement from me, and they never will.\r\nIn my opinion, they have done nothing but delay and defeat their own\r\nprofessed objects.\r\n\r\nI have now stated, as I understand it, the condition of things upon the\r\nadoption of the Constitution of the United States. What has happened\r\nsince? Sir, it has happened that, above and beyond all contemplation or\r\nexpectation of the original framers of the Constitution, or the people\r\nwho adopted it, foreign territory has been acquired by cession, first\r\nfrom France, and then from Spain, on our southern frontier. And what has\r\nbeen the result? Five slave-holding States have been created and added\r\nto the Union, bringing ten Senators into this body, (I include Texas,\r\nwhich I consider in the light of a foreign acquisition also,) and up to\r\nthis hour in which I address you, not one free State has been admitted\r\nto the Union from all this acquired territory!\r\n\r\n     MR. BERRIEN (in his seat). Yes, Iowa.\r\n\r\nIowa is not yet in the Union. Her Senators are not here. When she comes\r\nin, there will be one to five, one free State to five slave States,\r\nformed out of new territories. Now, it seems strange to me that there\r\nshould be any complaint of injustice exercised by the North toward the\r\nSouth. Northern votes have been necessary, they have been ready, and\r\nthey have been given, to aid in the admission of these five new\r\nslave-holding States. These are facts; and as the gentleman from Georgia\r\nhas very properly put it as a case in which we are to present ourselves\r\nbefore the world for its judgment, let us now see how we stand. I do not\r\nrepresent the North. I state my own case; and I present the matter in\r\nthat light in which I am willing, as an individual member of Congress,\r\nto be judged by civilized humanity. I say then, that, according to true\r\nhistory, the slave-holding interest in this country has not been a\r\ndisfavored interest; it has not been disfavored by the North. The North\r\nhas concurred to bring in these five slave-holding States out of newly\r\nacquired territory, which acquisitions were not at all in the\r\ncontemplation of the Convention which formed the Constitution, or of the\r\npeople when they agreed that there should be a representation of three\r\nfifths of the slaves in the then existing States.\r\n\r\nMr. President, what is the result of this? We stand here now, at least I\r\ndo, for one, to say, that, considering there have been already five new\r\nslave-holding States formed out of newly acquired territory, and only\r\none non-slave-holding State, at most, I do not feel that I am called on\r\nto go further; I do not feel the obligation to yield more. But our\r\nfriends of the South say, You deprive us of all our rights. We have\r\nfought for this territory, and you deny us participation in it. Let us\r\nconsider this question as it really is; and since the honorable\r\ngentleman from Georgia proposes to leave the case to the enlightened and\r\nimpartial judgment of mankind, and as I agree with him that it is a case\r\nproper to be considered by the enlightened part of mankind, let us see\r\nhow the matter in truth stands. Gentlemen who advocate the case which my\r\nhonorable friend from Georgia, with so much ability, sustains, declare\r\nthat we invade their rights, that we deprive them of a participation in\r\nthe enjoyment of territories acquired by the common services and common\r\nexertions of all. Is this true? How deprive? Of what do we deprive them?\r\nWhy, they say that we deprive them of the privilege of carrying their\r\nslaves, as slaves, into the new territories. Well, Sir, what is the\r\namount of that? They say that in this way we deprive them of the\r\nopportunity of going into this acquired territory with their property.\r\nTheir \"property\"? What do they mean by \"property\"? We certainly do not\r\ndeprive them of the privilege of going into these newly acquired\r\nterritories with all that, in the general estimate of human society, in\r\nthe general, and common, and universal understanding of mankind, is\r\nesteemed property. Not at all. The truth is just this. They have, in\r\ntheir own States, peculiar laws, which create property in persons. They\r\nhave a system of local legislation on which slavery rests; while\r\neverybody agrees that it is against natural law, or at least against the\r\ncommon understanding which prevails among men as to what is natural law.\r\n\r\nI am not going into metaphysics, for therein I should encounter the\r\nhonorable member from South Carolina,[3] and we should find \"no end, in\r\nwandering mazes lost,\" until after the time for the adjournment of\r\nCongress. The Southern States have peculiar laws, and by those laws\r\nthere is property in slaves. This is purely local. The real meaning,\r\nthen, of Southern gentlemen, in making this complaint, is, that they\r\ncannot go into the territories of the United States carrying with them\r\ntheir own peculiar local law, a law which creates property in persons.\r\nThis, according to their own statement, is all the ground of complaint\r\nthey have. Now here, I think, gentlemen are unjust towards us. How\r\nunjust they are, others will judge; generations that will come after us\r\nwill judge. It will not be contended that this sort of personal slavery\r\nexists by general law. It exists only by local law. I do not mean to\r\ndeny the validity of that local law where it is established; but I say\r\nit is, after all, local law. It is nothing more. And wherever that local\r\nlaw does not extend, property in persons does not exist. Well, Sir, what\r\nis now the demand on the part of our Southern friends? They say, \"We\r\nwill carry our local laws with us wherever we go. We insist that\r\nCongress does us injustice unless it establishes in the territory in\r\nwhich we wish to go our own local law.\" This demand I for one resist,\r\nand shall resist. It goes upon the idea that there is an inequality,\r\nunless persons under this local law, and holding property by authority\r\nof that law, can go into new territory and there establish that local\r\nlaw, to the exclusion of the general law. Mr. President, it was a maxim\r\nof the civil law, that, between slavery and freedom, freedom should\r\nalways be presumed, and slavery must always be proved. If any question\r\narose as to the _status_ of an individual in Rome, he was presumed to be\r\nfree until he was proved to be a slave, because slavery is an exception\r\nto the general rule. Such, I suppose, is the general law of mankind. An\r\nindividual is to be presumed to be free, until a law can be produced\r\nwhich creates ownership in his person. I do not dispute the force and\r\nvalidity of the local law, as I have already said; but I say, it is a\r\nmatter to be proved; and therefore, if individuals go into any part of\r\nthe earth, it is to be proved that they are not freemen, or else the\r\npresumption is that they are.\r\n\r\nNow our friends seem to think that an inequality arises from restraining\r\nthem from going into the territories, unless there be a law provided\r\nwhich shall protect their ownership in persons. The assertion is, that\r\nwe create an inequality. Is there nothing to be said on the other side\r\nin relation to inequality? Sir, from the date of this Constitution, and\r\nin the counsels that formed and established this Constitution, and I\r\nsuppose in all men's judgment since, it is received as a settled truth,\r\nthat slave labor and free labor do not exist well together. I have\r\nbefore me a declaration of Mr. Mason, in the Convention that formed the\r\nConstitution, to that effect. Mr. Mason, as is well known, was a\r\ndistinguished member from Virginia. He says that the objection to slave\r\nlabor is, that it puts free white labor in disrepute; that it causes\r\nlabor to be regarded as derogatory to the character of the free white\r\nman, and that the free white man despises to work, to use his\r\nexpression, where slaves are employed. This is a matter of great\r\ninterest to the free States, if it be true, as to a great extent it\r\ncertainly is, that wherever slave labor prevails free white labor is\r\nexcluded or discouraged. I agree that slave labor does not necessarily\r\nexclude free labor totally. There is free white labor in Virginia,\r\nTennessee, and other States, where most of the labor is done by slaves.\r\nBut it necessarily loses something of its respectability, by the side\r\nof, and when associated with, slave labor. Wherever labor is mainly\r\nperformed by slaves, it is regarded as degrading to freemen. The freemen\r\nof the North, therefore, have a deep interest in keeping labor free,\r\nexclusively free, in the new territories.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, let us look further into this alleged inequality. There is no\r\npretence that Southern people may not go into territory which shall be\r\nsubject to the Ordinance of 1787. The only restraint is, that they shall\r\nnot carry slaves thither, and continue that relation. They say this\r\nshuts them altogether out. Why, Sir, there can be nothing more\r\ninaccurate in point of fact than this statement. I understand that one\r\nhalf the people who settled Illinois are people, or descendants of\r\npeople, who came from the Southern States. And I suppose that one third\r\nof the people of Ohio are those, or descendants of those, who emigrated\r\nfrom the South; and I venture to say, that, in respect to those two\r\nStates, they are at this day settled by people of Southern origin in as\r\ngreat a proportion as they are by people of Northern origin, according\r\nto the general numbers and proportion of people, South and North. There\r\nare as many people from the South, in proportion to the whole people of\r\nthe South, in those States, as there are from the North, in proportion\r\nto the whole people of the North. There is, then, no exclusion of\r\nSouthern people; there is only the exclusion of a peculiar local law.\r\nNeither in principle nor in fact is there any inequality.\r\n\r\nThe question now is, whether it is not competent to Congress, in the\r\nexercise of a fair and just discretion, considering that there have been\r\nfive slave-holding States added to this Union out of foreign\r\nacquisitions, and as yet only one free State, to prevent their further\r\nincrease. That is the question. I see no injustice in it. As to the\r\npower of Congress, I have nothing to add to what I said the other day.\r\nCongress has full power over the subject. It may establish any such\r\ngovernment, and any such laws, in the territories, as in its discretion\r\nit may see fit. It is subject, of course, to the rules of justice and\r\npropriety; but it is under no constitutional restraints.\r\n\r\nI have said that I shall consent to no extension of the area of slavery\r\nupon this continent, nor to any increase of slave representation in the\r\nother house of Congress. I have now stated my reasons for my conduct and\r\nmy vote. We of the North have already gone, in this respect, far beyond\r\nall that any Southern man could have expected, or did expect, at the\r\ntime of the adoption of the Constitution. I repeat the statement of the\r\nfact of the creation of five new slave-holding States out of newly\r\nacquired territory. We have done that which, if those who framed the\r\nConstitution had foreseen, they never would have agreed to slave\r\nrepresentation. We have yielded thus far; and we have now in the House\r\nof Representatives twenty persons voting upon this very question, and\r\nupon all other questions, who are there only in virtue of the\r\nrepresentation of slaves.\r\n\r\nLet me conclude, therefore, by remarking, that, while I am willing to\r\npresent this as showing my own judgment and position, in regard to this\r\ncase, and I beg it to be understood that I am speaking for no other than\r\nmyself, and while I am willing to offer it to the whole world as my own\r\njustification, I rest on these propositions: First, That when this\r\nConstitution was adopted, nobody looked for any new acquisition of\r\nterritory to be formed into slave-holding States. Secondly, That the\r\nprinciples of the Constitution prohibited, and were intended to\r\nprohibit, and should be construed to prohibit, all interference of the\r\ngeneral government with slavery as it existed and as it still exists in\r\nthe States. And then, looking to the operation of these new\r\nacquisitions, which have in this great degree had the effect of\r\nstrengthening that interest in the South by the addition of these five\r\nStates, I feel that there is nothing unjust, nothing of which any honest\r\nman can complain, if he is intelligent, and I feel that there is nothing\r\nwith which the civilized world, if they take notice of so humble a\r\nperson as myself, will reproach me, when I say, as I said the other day,\r\nthat I have made up my mind, for one, that under no circumstances will I\r\nconsent to the further extension of the area of slavery in the United\r\nStates, or to the further increase of slave representation in the House\r\nof Representatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Benton.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. Berrien.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mr. Calhoun.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT MARSHFIELD.\r\n\r\nDELIVERED AT A MEETING OF THE CITIZENS OF MARSHFIELD, MASS., ON THE 1ST\r\nOF SEPTEMBER, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following correspondence explains the occasion of the meeting at\r\nMarshfield, at which the following speech was delivered.\r\n\r\n\"_Marshfield, Mass., Aug. 2, 1848._\r\n\r\n\"HON.

We should be grieved indeed to see General Cass--so decided an\r\nopponent of all those measures which we think essential to the honor and\r\ninterests of the country and the prosperity of all classes--elected to\r\nthe chief magistracy. On the other hand, it is not to be concealed, that\r\nthere is much discontent with the nomination made by the late\r\nPhiladelphia Convention, of a Southern man, a military man, fresh from\r\nbloody fields, and known only by his sword, as a Whig candidate for the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\n\"So far as is in our humble ability, we desire to preserve the Union and\r\nthe Whig party, and to perpetuate Whig principles; but we wish to see\r\nalso that these principles may be preserved, and this Union perpetuated,\r\nin a manner consistent with the rights of the Free States, and the\r\nprevention of the farther extension of the slave power; and we dread the\r\neffects of the precedent, which we think eminently dangerous, and as not\r\nexhibiting us in a favorable light to the nations of the earth, of\r\nelevating a mere military man to the Presidency.\r\n\r\n\"We think a crisis is upon us; and we would gladly know how we may best\r\ndischarge our duties as true Americans, honest men, and good Whigs. To\r\nyou, who have been so long in public life, and are able from your great\r\nexperience and unrivalled ability to give us information and advice, and\r\nupon whom, as neighbors and friends, we think we have some claims, we\r\nnaturally look, and we should be exceedingly gratified if, in any way,\r\npublic or private, you would express your opinion upon interesting\r\npublic questions now pending, with that boldness and distinctness with\r\nwhich you are accustomed to declare your sentiments. If you can concur\r\nwith our wishes, please signify to us in what manner it would be most\r\nagreeable to you that they should be carried into effect.\r\n\r\n\"With very great regard, your obedient servants,\r\n\r\n\"DANIEL PHILLIPS,\r\nGEORGE LEONARD,\r\nGEO.

I wish, and I propose, to\r\naddress you in the language and in the spirit of conference and\r\nconsultation. In the present extraordinary crisis of our public\r\nconcerns, I desire to hold no man's conscience but my own. My own\r\nopinions I shall communicate, freely and fearlessly, with equal\r\ndisregard to consequences, whether they respect myself or respect\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWe are on the eve of a highly important Presidential election. In two or\r\nthree months the people of this country will be called upon to elect an\r\nexecutive chief magistrate of the United States; and all see, and all\r\nfeel, that great interests of the country are to be affected, for good\r\nor evil, by the results of that election. Of the interesting subjects\r\nover which the person who shall be elected must necessarily exercise\r\nmore or less control, there are especially three, vitally connected, in\r\nmy judgment, with the honor and happiness of the country. In the first\r\nplace, the honor and happiness of the country imperatively require that\r\nthere shall be a chief magistrate elected who shall not plunge us into\r\nfurther wars of ambition and conquest. In the second place, in my\r\njudgment, the interests of the country and the feeling of a vast\r\nmajority of the people require that a President of these United States\r\nshould be elected, who will neither use official influence to promote,\r\nnor feel any desire in his heart to promote, the further extension of\r\nslavery in this community, or its further influence in the public\r\ncouncils. In the third place, if I have any just estimate, if an\r\nexperience not now a short one in public affairs has enabled me to know\r\nany thing of what the public interest demands, the state of the country\r\nrequires an essential reform in the system of revenue and finance such\r\nas shall restore the prosperity, by prompting the industry and fostering\r\nthe labor of the country, in its various branches. There are other\r\nthings important, but I will not allude to them. These three I hold to\r\nbe essential.\r\n\r\nThere are three candidates presented to the choice of the American\r\npeople. General Taylor is the Whig candidate, standing upon the\r\nnomination of the Whig Convention; General Cass is the candidate of the\r\nopposing and now dominant party in the country; and a third candidate is\r\npresented in the person of Mr. Van Buren, by a convention of citizens\r\nassembled at Buffalo, whose object, or whose main object, as it appears\r\nto me, is contained in one of those considerations which I have\r\nmentioned, and that is, the prevention of the further increase of\r\nslavery;--an object in which you and I, Gentlemen, so far as that goes,\r\nentirely concur with them, I am sure.\r\n\r\nMost of us who are here to-day are Whigs, National Whigs, Massachusetts\r\nWhigs, Old Colony Whigs, and Marshfield Whigs, and if the Whig\r\nnomination made at Philadelphia were entirely satisfactory to the people\r\nof Massachusetts and to us, our path of duty would be plain. But the\r\nnomination of a candidate for the Presidency made by the Whig Convention\r\nat Philadelphia is not satisfactory to the Whigs of Massachusetts. That\r\nis certain, and it would be idle to attempt to conceal the fact. It is\r\nmore just and more patriotic, it is more manly and practical, to take\r\nfacts as they are, and things as they are, and to deduce our own\r\nconviction of duty from what exists before us. However respectable and\r\ndistinguished in the line of his own profession, or however estimable as\r\na private citizen, General Taylor is a military man, and a military man\r\nmerely. He has had no training in civil affairs. He has performed no\r\nfunctions of a civil nature under the Constitution of his country. He\r\nhas been known and is known, only by his brilliant achievements at the\r\nhead of an army. Now the Whigs of Massachusetts, and I among them, are\r\nof opinion that it was not wise, nor discreet, to go to the army for the\r\nselection of a candidate for the Presidency of the United States. It is\r\nthe first instance in their history in which any man of mere military\r\ncharacter has been proposed for that high office. General Washington was\r\na great military character; but by far a greater civil character. He had\r\nbeen employed in the councils of his country, from the earliest dawn of\r\nthe Revolution. He had been in the Continental Congress, and he had\r\nestablished a great character for civil wisdom and judgment. After the\r\nwar, as you know, he was elected a member of that convention which\r\nformed the Constitution of the United States; and it is one of the most\r\nhonorable tributes ever paid to him, that by that assembly of good and\r\nwise men he was selected to preside over their deliberations. And he put\r\nhis name first and foremost to the Constitution under which we live.\r\nPresident Harrison was bred a soldier, and at different periods of his\r\nlife rendered important military services. But President Harrison,\r\nnevertheless, was for a much greater period of his life employed in\r\ncivil than in military service. For twenty years he was either governor\r\nof a Territory, member of one or the other house of Congress, or\r\nminister abroad; and discharged all these duties to the satisfaction of\r\nhis country. This case, therefore, stands by itself; without a precedent\r\nor justification from any thing in our previous history. It is for this\r\nreason, as I imagine, that the Whigs of Massachusetts feel dissatisfied\r\nwith this nomination. There may be other reasons, there are others; they\r\nare, perhaps, of less importance, and more easily to be answered. But\r\nthis is a well-founded objection; and in my opinion it ought to have\r\nprevailed, and to have prevented this nomination. I know enough of\r\nhistory to see the dangerous tendency of such resorts to military\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\nBut, if I may borrow a mercantile expression, I may now venture to say,\r\nthat there is another side to this account. The impartiality with which\r\nI propose to discharge my duty to-day requires that it should be stated.\r\nAnd, in the first place, it is to be considered, that General Taylor has\r\nbeen nominated by a Whig convention, held in conformity with the usages\r\nof the Whig party, and, so far as I know, fairly nominated. It is to be\r\nconsidered, also, that he is the only Whig before the people, as a\r\ncandidate for the Presidency; and no citizen of the country, with any\r\neffect, can vote for any other Whig, let his preferences be what they\r\nmight or may.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, it is proper to consider the personal character of\r\nGeneral Taylor, and his political opinions, relations, and connections,\r\nso far as they are known. In advancing to a few observations on this\r\npart of the case, I wish everybody to understand that I have no personal\r\nacquaintance whatever with General Taylor. I never saw him but once, and\r\nthat but for a few moments in the Senate. The sources of information are\r\nopen to you, as well as to me, from which I derive what I know of his\r\ncharacter and opinions. But I have endeavored to obtain access to those\r\nsources. I have endeavored to inform and instruct myself by\r\ncommunication with those who have known him in his profession as a\r\nsoldier, in his associations as a man, in his conversations and opinions\r\non political subjects; and I will tell you frankly what I think of him,\r\naccording to the best lights which I have been able to obtain.\r\n\r\nI need not say, that he is a skilful, brave, and gallant soldier. That\r\nis admitted by all. With me, all that goes but very little way to make\r\nout the proper qualifications for President of the United States. But\r\nwhat is more important, I believe that he is an entirely honest and\r\nupright man. I believe that he is modest, clear-headed, of independent\r\nand manly character, possessing a mind trained by proper discipline and\r\nself-control. I believe that he is estimable and amiable in all the\r\nrelations of private life. I believe that he possesses a reputation for\r\nequity and fair judgment, which gives him an influence over those under\r\nhis command beyond what is conferred by the authority of station. I\r\nbelieve that he is a man possessing the confidence and attachment of all\r\nwho have been near him and know him. And I believe, that, if elected\r\nPresident, he will do his best to relieve the country from present\r\nevils, and guard it against future dangers. So much for what I think of\r\nthe personal character of General Taylor.\r\n\r\nI will say, too, that, so far as I have observed, his conduct since he\r\nhas been a candidate for the office of President has been\r\nirreproachable. I hear no intrigue imputed to him, no contumelious\r\ntreatment of rivals. I do not find him making promises or holding out\r\nhopes to any men or any party. I do not find him putting forth any\r\npretensions of his own, and therefore I think of him very much as he\r\nseems to think of himself, that he is an honest man, of an independent\r\nmind and of upright intentions. And as for the subject of his\r\nqualifications for the Presidency, he has himself nothing to say about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnd now, friends and fellow-townsmen, with respect to his political\r\nopinions and relations, I can say at once, that I believe him to be a\r\nWhig; I believe him to hold to the main doctrines of the Whig party. To\r\nthink otherwise would be to impute to him a degree of tergiversation and\r\nfraudulent deception of which I suppose him to be entirely incapable.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it is worth our while to consider in what manner General\r\nTaylor has become a candidate for the Presidency of the United States.\r\nIt would be a great mistake to suppose that he was made such merely by\r\nthe nomination of the Philadelphia Convention. He had been nominated for\r\nthe Presidency in a great many States, by various conventions and\r\nmeetings of the people, a year before the convention at Philadelphia\r\nassembled. The whole history of the world shows, whether in the most\r\ncivilized or the most barbarous ages, that the affections and admiration\r\nof mankind are at all times easily carried away towards successful\r\nmilitary achievements. The story of all republics and of all free\r\ngovernments shows this. We know in the case now before us, that so soon\r\nas brilliant success had attended General Taylor's operations on the Rio\r\nGrande, at Palo Alto, and Monterey, spontaneous nominations of him\r\nsprang up.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me say, that, generally, these were Whig nominations. Not\r\nuniversally, but generally, these nominations, made at various times\r\nbefore the meeting of the Philadelphia Convention, were Whig\r\nnominations. General Taylor was esteemed, from the moment that his\r\nmilitary achievements brought him into public notice, as a Whig general.\r\nYou all remember, that when we were discussing his merits in Congress,\r\nupon the question of giving thanks to the army under his command, and to\r\nhimself, among other objections, the friends and supporters of Mr.\r\nPolk's administration denounced him as being, and because he was, a Whig\r\ngeneral. My friends near me, whom I am happy to see here, belonging to\r\nthe House of Representatives, will remember that a leading man of the\r\nparty of the administration declared in his place in Congress, that the\r\npolicy of the administration, connected with the Mexican war, would\r\nnever prosper, till the President recalled those Whig generals, Scott\r\nand Taylor. The policy was a Democratic policy. The argument was, that\r\nthe men to carry out this policy should be Democratic men; the officers\r\nto fight the battles should be Democratic officers; and on that ground,\r\nthe ordinary vote of thanks was refused to General Taylor, on the part\r\nof the friends of the administration.\r\n\r\nLet me remark, in the next place, that there was no particular purpose\r\nconnected with the advancement of slavery entertained, generally, by\r\nthose who nominated him. As I have said, they were Whig nominations,\r\nmore in the Middle and Northern than in the Southern States, and by\r\npersons who never entertained the slightest desire, by his nomination,\r\nor by any other means, to extend the area of slavery of the human race,\r\nor the influence of the slave-holding States in the councils of the\r\nnation. The Quaker city of Philadelphia nominated General Taylor, the\r\nWhigs all over the Union nominated him, with no such view. A great\r\nconvention was assembled in New York, of highly influential and\r\nrespectable gentlemen, very many of them well known to me, and they\r\nnominated General Taylor with no such view. General Taylor's nomination\r\nwas hailed, not very extensively, but by some enthusiastic and not very\r\nfar-seeing people in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. There were, even\r\namong us, in our own State, Whigs quite early enough, certainly, in\r\nmanifesting their confidence in this nomination; a little too early, it\r\nmay be, in uttering notes of exultation for the anticipated triumph. It\r\nwould have been better if they had waited.\r\n\r\nNow the truth is, Gentlemen,--and no man can avoid seeing it, unless, as\r\nsometimes happens, the object is too near our eyes to be distinctly\r\ndiscerned,--the truth is, that in these nominations, and also in the\r\nnomination at Philadelphia, in these conventions, and also in the\r\nconvention at Philadelphia, General Taylor was nominated exactly for\r\nthis reason;--that, believing him to be a Whig, they thought he could be\r\nchosen more easily than any other Whig. This is the whole of it. That\r\nsagacious, wise, far-seeing doctrine of availability lies at the bottom\r\nof the whole matter. So far, then, from imputing any motive to these\r\nconventions over the country, or to the convention in Philadelphia, as\r\noperating on a majority of the members, to promote slavery by the\r\nnomination of General Taylor, I do not believe a word of it,--not one\r\nword. I see that one part of what is called the Platform of the Buffalo\r\nConvention says that the candidates before the public were nominated\r\nunder the dictation of the slave power. I do not believe a word of it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a very great majority of the convention at\r\nPhiladelphia was composed of members from the Free States. By a very\r\ngreat majority they might have nominated anybody they chose. But the\r\nFree States did not choose to nominate a Free State man, or a Northern\r\nman. Even our neighbors, the States of New England, with the exception\r\nof New Hampshire and a part of Maine, neither proposed nor concurred in\r\nthe nomination of any Northern man. Vermont would hear of nothing but\r\nthe nomination of a Southern and slave-holding candidate. Connecticut\r\nwas of the same mind, and so was Rhode Island. The North made no demand,\r\nnor presented any request for a Northern candidate, nor attempted any\r\nunion among themselves for the purpose of promoting the nomination of\r\nsuch a candidate. They were content to take their choice among the\r\ncandidates of the South. It is preposterous, therefore, to pretend that\r\na candidate from the Slave States has been forced upon the North by\r\nSouthern dictation.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, it is true that there were persons from New England\r\nwho were extremely zealous and active in procuring the nomination of\r\nGeneral Taylor, but they were men who would cut off their right hands\r\nbefore they would do any thing to promote slavery in the United States.\r\nI do not admire their policy; indeed I have very little respect for it,\r\nunderstand that; but I acquit them of bad motives. I know the leading\r\nmen in that convention. I think I understand the motives that governed\r\nthem. Their reasoning was this: \"General Taylor is a Whig: not eminent\r\nin civil life, not known in civil life, but still a man of sound Whig\r\nprinciples. Circumstances have given him a reputation and _éclat_ in the\r\ncountry. If he shall be the Whig candidate, he will be chosen; and with\r\nhim there will come into the two houses of Congress an augmentation of\r\nWhig strength. The Whig majority in the House of Representatives will be\r\nincreased. The Democratic majority in the Senate will be diminished.\"\r\nThat was the view, and such was the motive, however wise or however\r\nunwise, that governed a very large majority of those who composed the\r\nconvention at Philadelphia. In my opinion, this was a wholly unwise\r\npolicy; it was short-sighted and temporizing on questions of great\r\nprinciples. But I acquit those who adopted it of any such motives as\r\nhave been ascribed to them, and especially of what has been ascribed to\r\nthem in a part of this Buffalo Platform.\r\n\r\nSuch, Gentlemen, are the circumstances connected with the nomination of\r\nGeneral Taylor. I only repeat, that those who had the greatest agency\r\noriginally in bringing him before the people were Whig conventions and\r\nWhig meetings in the several States, Free States, and that a great\r\nmajority of that convention which nominated him in Philadelphia was from\r\nthe Free States, and might have rejected him if they had chosen, and\r\nselected anybody else on whom they could have united.\r\n\r\nThis is the case, Gentlemen, as far as I can discern it, and exercising\r\nupon it as impartial a judgment as I can form,--this is the case\r\npresented to the Whigs, so far as respects the personal fitness and\r\npersonal character of General Taylor, and the circumstances which have\r\ncaused his nomination. If we were weighing the propriety of nominating\r\nsuch a person to the Presidency, it would be one thing; if we are\r\nconsidering the expediency, or I may say the necessity (which to some\r\nminds may seem to be the case), of well-meaning and patriotic Whigs\r\nsupporting him after he is nominated, that is quite another thing.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the consideration of what the Whigs of Massachusetts\r\nare to do, or such of them as do not see fit to support General Taylor.\r\nOf course they must vote for General Cass, or they must vote for Mr. Van\r\nBuren, or they must omit to vote at all. I agree that there are cases in\r\nwhich, if we do not know in what direction to move, we ought to stand\r\nstill till we do. I admit that there are cases in which, if one does not\r\nknow what to do, he had better not do he knows not what. But on a\r\nquestion so important to ourselves and the country, on a question of a\r\npopular election under constitutional forms, in which it is impossible\r\nthat every man's private judgment can prevail, or every man's private\r\nchoice succeed, it becomes a question of conscientious duty and\r\npatriotism, what it is best to do upon the whole.\r\n\r\nUnder the practical administration of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, there cannot be a great range of personal choice in regard to\r\nthe candidate for the Presidency. In order that their votes may be\r\neffective, men must give them for some one of those who are prominently\r\nbefore the public. This is the necessary result of our forms of\r\ngovernment and of the provisions of the Constitution. The people are\r\ntherefore brought sometimes to the necessity of choosing between\r\ncandidates neither of whom would be their original, personal choice.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the contingency? What is the alternative presented to the\r\nWhigs of Massachusetts? In my judgment, fellow-citizens, it is simply\r\nthis; the question is between General Taylor and General Cass. And that\r\nis the only question. I am no more skilled to foresee political\r\noccurrences than others. I judge only for myself. But, in my opinion,\r\nthere is not the least probability of any other result than the choice\r\nof General Taylor or General Cass. I know that the enthusiasm of a\r\nnew-formed party, that the popularity of a new-formed name, without\r\ncommunicating any new-formed idea, may lead men to think that the sky is\r\nto fall, and that larks are suddenly to be taken. I entertain no such\r\nexpectations. I speak without disrespect of the Free Soil party. I have\r\nread their platform, and though I think there are some unsound places in\r\nit, I can stand on it pretty well. But I see nothing in it both new and\r\nvaluable. \"What is valuable is not new, and what is new is not\r\nvaluable.\" If the term Free Soil party, or Free Soil men, designate\r\nthose who are fixed, and unalterably fixed, in favor of the restriction\r\nof slavery, are so to-day and were so yesterday, and have been so for\r\nsome time, then I hold myself to be as good a Free Soil man as any of\r\nthe Buffalo Convention. I pray to know who is to put beneath my feet a\r\nfreer soil than that upon which I have stood ever since I have been in\r\npublic life? I pray to know who is to make my lips freer than they\r\nalways have been, or to inspire into my breast a more resolute and fixed\r\ndetermination to resist the advances and encroachments of the slave\r\npower, than has inhabited it since I for the first time opened my mouth\r\nin the councils of the country? The gentlemen at Buffalo have placed at\r\nthe head of their party Mr. Van Buren, a gentleman for whom I have all\r\nthe respect that I ought to entertain for one with whom I have been\r\nassociated, in some degree, in public life for many years, and who has\r\nheld the highest offices in the country. But really, speaking for\r\nmyself, if I were to express confidence in Mr. Van Buren and his\r\npolitics on any question, and most especially this very question of\r\nslavery, I think the scene would border upon the ludicrous, if not upon\r\nthe contemptible. I never proposed any thing in my life of a general and\r\npublic nature, that Mr. Van Buren did not oppose. Nor has it happened to\r\nme to support any important measure proposed by him. If he and I now\r\nwere to find ourselves together under the Free Soil flag, I am sure\r\nthat, with his accustomed good nature, he would laugh. If nobody were\r\npresent, we should both laugh at the strange occurrences and stranger\r\njumbles of political life that should have brought us to sit down cosily\r\nand snugly, side by side, on the same platform. That the leader of the\r\nFree Spoil party should so suddenly have become the leader of the Free\r\nSoil party would be a joke to shake his sides and mine.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, my first acquaintance in public life with Mr. Van Buren was\r\nwhen he was pressing with great power the election of Mr. Crawford to\r\nthe Presidency, against Mr. Adams. Mr. Crawford was not elected, and Mr.\r\nAdams was. Mr. Van Buren was in the Senate nearly the whole of that\r\nadministration; and during the remainder of it he was Governor of the\r\nState of New York. It is notorious that he was the soul and centre,\r\nthroughout the whole of Mr. Adams's term, of the opposition made to him.\r\nHe did more to prevent Mr. Adams's re-election in 1828, and to obtain\r\nGeneral Jackson's election, than any other man,--yes, than any _ten_\r\nother men in the country.\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson was chosen, and Mr. Van Buren was appointed his\r\nSecretary of State. It so happened that in July, 1829, Mr. McLane went\r\nto England to arrange the controverted, difficult, and disputed point on\r\nthe subject of the colonial trade. Mr. Adams had held a high tone on\r\nthat subject. He had demanded, on the ground of reciprocity and right,\r\nthe introduction of our products into all parts of the British\r\nterritory, freely, in our own vessels, since Great Britain was allowed\r\nto bring her produce into the United States upon the same terms. Mr.\r\nAdams placed this demand upon the ground of reciprocity and justice.\r\nGreat Britain would not yield. Mr. Van Buren, in his instructions to Mr.\r\nMcLane, told him to yield that question of right, and to solicit the\r\nfree admission of American produce into the British colonies, on the\r\nground of privilege and favor; intimating that there had been a change\r\nof parties, and that this favor ought not to be refused to General\r\nJackson's administration because it had been demanded on the ground of\r\nright by Mr. Adams's. This is the sum and substance of the instruction.\r\n\r\nWell, Gentlemen, it was one of the most painful duties of my life, on\r\naccount of this, to refuse my assent to Mr. Van Buren's nomination. It\r\nwas novel in our history, when an administration changes, for the new\r\nadministration to seek to obtain privileges from a foreign power on the\r\nassertion that they have abandoned the ground of their predecessors. I\r\nsuppose that such a course is held to be altogether undignified by all\r\npublic men. When I went into the Department of State under General\r\nHarrison, I found in the conduct of my predecessor many things that I\r\ncould have wished had been otherwise. Did I retract a jot or tittle of\r\nwhat Mr. Forsyth had said? I took the case as he had left it, and\r\nconducted it upon the principles which he left. I should have considered\r\nthat I disgraced myself if I had said, \"Pray, my Lord Ashburton, we are\r\nmore rational persons than our predecessors, we are more considerate\r\nthan they, and intend to adopt an entirely opposite policy. Consider, my\r\ndear Lord, how much more friendly, reasonable, and amiable we are than\r\nour predecessors.\"\r\n\r\nBut now, on this very subject of the extension of the slave power, I\r\nwould by no means do the least injustice to Mr. Van Buren. If he has\r\ncome up to some of the opinions expressed in the platform of the Buffalo\r\nConvention, I am very glad of it. I do not mean to say that there may\r\nnot be very good reasons for those of his own party who cannot\r\nconscientiously vote for General Cass to vote for him, because I think\r\nhim much the least dangerous of the two. But, in truth, looking at Mr.\r\nVan Buren's conduct as President of the United States, I am amazed to\r\nfind that he should be placed at the head of a party professing to be,\r\nbeyond all other parties, friends of liberty and enemies of African\r\nslavery in the Southern States. Why, the very first thing that Mr. Van\r\nBuren did after he was President was to declare, that, if Congress\r\ninterfered with slavery in the District of Columbia, he would apply the\r\nveto to their bills. Mr. Van Buren, in his inaugural address, quotes the\r\nfollowing expression from his letter accepting his nomination: \"I must\r\ngo into the Presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising\r\nopponent of every attempt on the part of Congress to abolish slavery in\r\nthe District of Columbia against the wishes of the slave-holding States;\r\nand also with a determination equally decided to resist the slightest\r\ninterference with it in the States where it exists.\" He then proceeds:\r\n\"I submitted also to my fellow-citizens, with fulness and frankness, the\r\nreasons which led me to this determination. The result authorizes me to\r\nbelieve that they have been approved and are confided in by a majority\r\nof the people of the United States, including those whom they most\r\nimmediately affect. It now only remains to add, that no bill conflicting\r\nwith these views can even receive my constitutional sanction.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next place, we know that Mr. Van Buren's casting vote was given\r\nfor a law of very doubtful propriety,--a law to allow postmasters to\r\nopen the mails and see if there was any incendiary matter in them, and,\r\nif so, to destroy it. I do not say that there was no constitutional\r\npower to pass such a law. Perhaps the people of the South thought it was\r\nnecessary to protect themselves from incitements to insurrection. So far\r\nas any thing endangers the lives and property of the South, so far I\r\nagree that there may be such legislation in Congress as shall prevent\r\nsuch results.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, no man has exercised a more controlling influence on the\r\nconduct of his friends in this country than Mr. Van Buren. I take it\r\nthat the most important event in our time tending to the extension of\r\nslavery and its everlasting establishment on this continent, was the\r\nannexation of Texas, in 1844. Where was Mr. Van Buren then? Let me ask,\r\nThree or four years ago, where was he THEN? Every friend of Mr. Van\r\nBuren, so far as I know, supported the measure. The two Senators from\r\nNew York supported it, and the members of the House of Representatives\r\nfrom New York supported it, and nobody resisted it but Whigs. And I say\r\nin the face of the world, I say in the face of those connected with, or\r\nlikely to be benefited by, the Buffalo Convention,--I say to all of\r\nthem, that there has been no party of men in this country which has\r\nfirmly and sternly resisted the progress of the slave power but the\r\nWhigs.\r\n\r\nWhy, look to this very question of the annexation of Texas. We talk of\r\nthe dictation of the slave power! At least they do, I do not. I do not\r\nallow that anybody dictates to me. They talk of the triumph of the South\r\nover the North! There is not a word of truth or reason in the whole of\r\nit. I am bound to say on my conscience, that, of all the evils inflicted\r\nupon us by these acquisitions of slave territory, the North has borne\r\nits full part in the infliction. Northern votes, in full proportion,\r\nhave been given in both houses for the acquisition of new territory, in\r\nwhich slavery existed. We talk of the North. There has for a long time\r\nbeen no North. I think the North Star is at last discovered; I think\r\nthere will be a North; but up to the recent session of Congress there\r\nhas been no North, no geographical section of the country, in which\r\nthere has been found a strong, conscientious, and _united_ opposition to\r\nslavery. No such North has existed.\r\n\r\nPope says, you know,\r\n\r\n    \"Ask where's the North? At York, 'tis on the Tweed;\r\n    In Scotland, at the Orcades; and there,\r\n    At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows where.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if there has heretofore been such a _North_ as I have described, a\r\nNorth strong in opinion and united in action against slavery,--if such a\r\n_North_ has existed anywhere, it has existed \"the Lord knows where,\" I\r\ndo not. Why, on this very question of the admission of Texas, it may be\r\nsaid with truth, that the North let in Texas. The Whigs, North and\r\nSouth, resisted Texas. Ten Senators from slave-holding States, of the\r\nWhig party, resisted Texas. Two, only, as I remember, voted for it. But\r\nthe Southern Whig votes against Texas were overpowered by the Democratic\r\nvotes from the Free States, and from New England among the rest. Yes, if\r\nthere had not been votes from New England in favor of Texas, Texas would\r\nhave been out of the Union to this day. Yes, if men from New England had\r\nbeen true, Texas would have been nothing but Texas still. There were\r\nfour votes in the Senate from New England in favor of the admission of\r\nTexas, Mr. Van Buren's friends, Democratic members: one from Maine; two\r\nfrom New Hampshire; one from Connecticut. Two of these gentlemen were\r\nconfidential friends of Mr. Van Buren, and had both been members of his\r\ncabinet. They voted for Texas; and they let in Texas, against Southern\r\nWhigs and Northern Whigs. That is the truth of it, my friends. Mr. Van\r\nBuren, by the wave of his hand, could have kept out Texas. A word, a\r\nletter, though it had been even shorter than General Cass's letter to\r\nthe Chicago Convention, would have been enough, and would have done the\r\nwork. But he was silent.\r\n\r\nWhen Northern members of Congress voted, in 1820, for the Missouri\r\nCompromise, against the known will of their constituents, they were\r\ncalled \"Dough Faces.\" I am afraid, fellow-citizens, that the generation\r\nof \"dough faces\" will be as perpetual as the generation of men.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, as we all know, Mr. Van Buren was a candidate for the\r\nPresidency, on the part of the Democratic party, but lost the nomination\r\nat Baltimore. We now learn, from a letter from General Jackson to Mr.\r\nButler, that Mr. Van Buren's claims were superseded, because, after all,\r\nthe South thought that the accomplishment of the annexation of Texas\r\nmight be more safely intrusted to Southern hands. We all know that the\r\nNorthern portion of the Democratic party were friendly to Mr. Van Buren.\r\nOur neighbors from New Hampshire, and Maine, and elsewhere, were Van\r\nBuren men. But the moment it was ascertained that Mr. Polk was the\r\nfavorite of the South, and the favorite of the South upon the ground I\r\nhave mentioned, as a man more certain to bring about the annexation of\r\nTexas than Mr. Van Buren, these friends of Mr. Van Buren in the North\r\nall \"caved in,\"--not a man of them stood. Mr. Van Buren himself wrote a\r\nletter very complimentary to Mr. Polk and Mr. Dallas, and found no fault\r\nwith the nomination.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, if they were \"dough faces\" who voted for the Missouri\r\nCompromise, what epithet should describe these men, here in our New\r\nEngland, who were so ready, not only to change or abandon him whom they\r\nmost cordially wished to support, but did so in order to make more sure\r\nthe annexation of Texas. They nominated Mr. Polk at the request of\r\ngentlemen from the South, and voted for him, through thick and thin,\r\ntill the work was accomplished, and Mr. Polk elected. For my part, I\r\nthink that \"dough faces\" is an epithet not sufficiently reproachful.\r\nSuch persons are dough faces, with dough heads, and dough hearts, and\r\ndough souls; they are _all_ dough; the coarsest potter may mould them to\r\nvessels of honor or dishonor,--most readily to vessels of _dis_honor.\r\n\r\nBut what do we now see? Repentance has gone far. There are among these\r\nvery people, these very gentlemen, persons who espouse, with great zeal,\r\nthe interests of the Free Soil party. I hope their repentance is as\r\nsincere as it appears to be. I hope it is honest conviction, and not\r\nmerely a new chance for power, under a new name and a new party. But,\r\nwith all their pretensions, and with all their patriotism, I see dough\r\nstill sticking on the cheeks of some of them. And therefore I have no\r\nconfidence in them, not a particle. I do not mean to say, that the great\r\nmass of the people, especially those who went to the Buffalo Convention\r\nfrom this State, have not the highest and purest motives. I think they\r\nact unwisely, but I acquit them of dishonest intentions. But with\r\nrespect to others, and those who have been part and parcel in the\r\nmeasures which have brought new slave territory into this Union, I\r\ndistrust them all. If they repent, let them, before we trust them, do\r\nworks worthy of repentance.\r\n\r\nI have said, Gentlemen, that in my opinion, if it were desirable to\r\nplace Mr. Van Buren at the head of government, there is no chance for\r\nhim. Others are as good judges as I am. But I am not able to say that I\r\nsee any State in the Union in which there is a reasonable probability\r\nthat he will get the vote. There may be. Others are more versed in such\r\nstatistics than I am. But I see none, and therefore I think that we are\r\nreduced to a choice between General Cass and General Taylor. You may\r\nremember, that in the discussions of 1844, when Mr. Birney was drawing\r\noff votes from the Whig candidate, I said that every vote for Mr. Birney\r\nwas half a vote for Mr. Polk. Is it not true that the vote of the\r\nLiberty party taken from Mr. Clay's vote in the State of New York made\r\nMr. Polk President? That is as clear as any historical fact. And in my\r\njudgment, it will be so now. I consider every Whig vote given to Mr. Van\r\nBuren, as directly aiding the election of Mr. Cass. Mark, I say, _Whig_\r\nvote. There may be States in which Mr. Van Buren may draw from the other\r\nside largely. But I speak of Whig votes, in this State and in any State.\r\nAnd I am of opinion, that any such vote given to Mr. Van Buren inures to\r\nthe benefit of General Cass.\r\n\r\nNow as to General Cass, Gentlemen. We need not go to the Baltimore\r\nplatform to instruct ourselves as to what his politics are, or how he\r\nwill conduct the government. General Cass will go into the government,\r\nif at all, chosen by the same party that elected Mr. Polk; and he will\r\n\"follow in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor.\" I hold him, I\r\nconfess, in the present state of the country, to be the most dangerous\r\nman on whom the powers of the executive chief magistracy could well be\r\nconferred. He would consider himself, not as conservative, not as\r\nprotective to present institutions, but as belonging to the party of\r\nProgress. He believes in the doctrine of American destiny; and that that\r\ndestiny is, to go through wars and invasions, and maintain vast armies,\r\nto establish a great, powerful, domineering government over all this\r\ncontinent. We know that, if Mr. Cass could have prevented it, the treaty\r\nwith England in 1842 would not have been made. We know that, if Mr. Cass\r\ncould have prevented it, the settlement of the Oregon question would not\r\nhave been accomplished in 1846. We know that General Cass could have\r\nprevented the Mexican war; and we know that he was first and foremost in\r\npressing that war. We know that he is a man of talent, of ability, of\r\nsome celebrity as a statesman, in every way superior to his predecessor,\r\nif he should be the successor of Mr. Polk. But I think him a man of rash\r\npolitics, pushed on by a rash party, and committed to a course of\r\npolicy, as I believe, not in consistency with the happiness and security\r\nof the country. Therefore it is for you, and for me, and for all of us,\r\nWhigs, to consider whether, in this state of the case, we can or cannot,\r\nwe will or will not, give our votes for the Whig nomination. I leave\r\nthat to every man's conscience. I have endeavored to state the case as\r\nit presents itself to me.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, before General Taylor's nomination, I stated always, when the\r\nsubject was mentioned by my friends, that I did not and could not\r\nrecommend the nomination of a military man to the people of the United\r\nStates for the office of President. It was against my conviction of what\r\nwas due to the best interests of the country, and to the character of\r\nthe republic. I stated always, at the same time, that if General Taylor\r\nshould be nominated by the Whig Convention, fairly, I should not oppose\r\nhis election. I stand now upon the same declaration. General Taylor has\r\nbeen nominated fairly, as far as I know, and I cannot, therefore, and\r\nshall not, oppose his election. At the same time, there is no man who is\r\nmore firmly of opinion that such a nomination was not fit to be made.\r\nBut the declaration that I would not oppose General Taylor, if nominated\r\nby the Whig party, was of course subject, in the nature of things, to\r\nsome exceptions. If I believed him to be a man who would plunge the\r\ncountry into further wars for any purpose of ambition or conquest, I\r\nwould oppose him, let him be nominated by whom he might. If I believed\r\nthat he was a man who would exert his official influence for the further\r\nextension of the slave power, I would oppose him, let him be nominated\r\nby whom he might. But I do not believe either. I believe that he has\r\nbeen, from the first, opposed to the policy of the Mexican war, as\r\nimproper, impolitic, and inexpedient. I believe, from the best\r\ninformation I can obtain,--and you will take this as my own opinion,\r\nGentlemen,--I believe, from the best information I can obtain, that he\r\nhas no disposition to go to war, or to form new States in order to\r\nincrease the limits of slavery.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, so much for what may be considered as belonging to the\r\nPresidency as a national question. But the case by no means stops here.\r\nWe are citizens of Massachusetts. We are Whigs of Massachusetts. We have\r\nsupported the present government of the State for years, with success;\r\nand I have thought that most Whigs were satisfied with the\r\nadministration of the State government in the hands of those who have\r\nhad it. But now it is proposed, I presume, on the basis of the Buffalo\r\nPlatform, to carry this into the State elections, as well as into the\r\nnational elections. There is to be a nomination of a candidate for\r\nGovernor, against Mr. Briggs, or whoever may be nominated by the Whigs;\r\nand there is to be a nomination of a candidate for Lieutenant-Governor,\r\nagainst Mr. Reed, or whoever may be nominated by the Whigs; and there\r\nare to be nominations against the present members of Congress. Now, what\r\nis the utility or the necessity of this? We have ten members in the\r\nCongress of the United States. I know not ten men of any party who are\r\nmore zealous, and firm, and inflexible in their opposition against\r\nslavery in any form.\r\n\r\nAnd what will be the result of opposing their re-election? Suppose that\r\na considerable number of Whigs secede from the Whig party, and support a\r\ncandidate of this new party, what will be the result? Do we not know\r\nwhat has been the case in this State? Do we not know that this district\r\nhas been unrepresented from month to month, and from year to year,\r\nbecause there has been an opposition to as good an antislavery man as\r\nbreathes the air of this district? On this occasion, and even in his own\r\npresence, I may allude to our Representative, Mr. Hale. Do we want a man\r\nto give a better vote in Congress than Mr. Hale gives? Why, I undertake\r\nto say that there is not one of the Liberty party, nor will there be one\r\nof this new party, who will have the least objection to Mr. Hale, except\r\nthat he was not nominated by themselves. Ten to one, if the Whigs had\r\nnot nominated him, they would have nominated him themselves; doubtless\r\nthey would, if he had come into their organization, and called himself a\r\nthird party man.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, I remember it to have occurred, that, on very important\r\nquestions in Congress, the vote was lost for want of two or three\r\nmembers which Massachusetts might have sent, but which, in consequence\r\nof the division of parties, she did not send. And now I foresee that, if\r\nin this district any considerable number of Whigs think it their duty to\r\njoin in the support of Mr. Van Buren, and in the support of gentlemen\r\nwhom that party may nominate for Congress, the same thing will take\r\nplace, and we shall be without a representative, in all probability, in\r\nthe first session of the next Congress, when the battle is to be fought\r\non this very slavery question. The same is likely to happen in other\r\ndistricts. I am sure that honest, intelligent, and patriotic Whigs will\r\nlay this consideration to their consciences, and judge of it as they\r\nthink they ought to do.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I will detain you but a moment longer. You know that I gave\r\nmy vote in Congress against the treaty of peace with Mexico, because it\r\ncontained these cessions of territory, and brought under the authority\r\nof the United States, with a pledge of future admission into the Union,\r\nthe great, vast, and almost unknown countries of New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nIn the session before the last, one of the Southern Whig Senators, Mr.\r\nBerrien of Georgia, had moved a resolution, to the effect that the war\r\nought not to be continued for the purposes of conquest and acquisition.\r\nThe resolution declared that the war with Mexico ought not to be\r\nprosecuted by this government with any view to the dismemberment of that\r\nrepublic, or to the acquisition, by conquest, of any portion of her\r\nterritory. That proposition he introduced into the Senate, in the form\r\nof a resolution; and I believe that every Whig Senator but one voted for\r\nit. But the Senators belonging to the Locofoco or Democratic party voted\r\nagainst it. The Senators from New York voted against it. General Cass,\r\nfrom the free State of Michigan, Mr. Fairfield, from Maine, Mr. Niles,\r\nfrom Connecticut, and others, voted against it, and the vote was lost.\r\nThat is, these gentlemen,--some of them very prominent friends of Mr.\r\nVan Buren, and ready to take the field for him,--these very gentlemen\r\nvoted not to exclude territory that might be obtained by conquest. They\r\nwere willing to bring in the territory, and then have a squabble and\r\ncontroversy whether it should be slave or free territory. I was of\r\nopinion that the true and safe policy was, to shut out the whole\r\nquestion by getting no territory, and thereby keep off all controversy.\r\nThe territory will do us no good, if free; it will be an encumbrance, if\r\nfree. To a great extent, it will produce a preponderance in favor of the\r\nSouth in the Senate, even if it be free. Let us keep it out, therefore.\r\nBut no. We will make the acquisition, bring in the territory, and manage\r\nit afterwards. That was the policy.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, in an important crisis in English history, in the reign of\r\nCharles the Second, when the country was threatened by the accession to\r\nthe throne of a prince, then called the Duke of York, who was a bigot to\r\nthe Roman Catholic religion, a proposition was made to exclude him from\r\nthe crown. Some said that was a very rash measure, brought forward by\r\nvery rash men; that they had better admit him, and then put limitations\r\nupon him, chain him down, restrict him. When the debate was going on, a\r\nmember is reported to have risen and expressed his sentiments by rather\r\na grotesque comparison, but one of considerable force:--\r\n\r\n    \"I hear a lion, in the lobby roar!\r\n    Say, Mr. Speaker, shall we shut the door,\r\n    And keep him out; or shall we let him in,\r\n    And see if we can get him out again?\"\r\n\r\nI was for shutting the door and keeping the lion out. Other more\r\nconfident spirits, who are of the character of Van Amburgh, were for\r\nletting him in, and disturbing all the interests of the country. When\r\nthis Mexican treaty came before the Senate, it had certain clauses\r\nceding New Mexico and California to the United States. A Southern\r\ngentleman, Mr. Badger, of North Carolina, moved to strike out those\r\nclauses. Now you understand, that if a motion to strike out a clause of\r\na treaty be supported by one third, it will be struck out; that is, two\r\nthirds of the Senate must vote for each clause, in order to have it\r\nretained. The vote on this question of striking out stood 38 to 14, not\r\nquite one third being against the cession, and so the clause was\r\nretained. And why were there not one third? Just because there were four\r\nNew England Senators voting for these new territories. That is the\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nI hope I am as ardent an advocate for peace as any man living; but I\r\nwould not be carried away by the desire for peace to commit an act which\r\nI believed highly injurious, likely to have consequences of a permanent\r\ncharacter, and indeed to endanger the existence of the government.\r\nBesides, I believed that we could have struck out the cessions of\r\nterritory, and had peace just as soon. And I would be willing to go\r\nbefore the people and leave it to them to say, whether they would carry\r\non the war any longer for acquisition of territory. If they would, then\r\nthey were the artificers of their own fortunes. I was not afraid of the\r\npeople on that subject. But if this course had continued the war\r\nsomewhat longer, I would have preferred that result, rather than that\r\nthose territories lying on our southern border should come in hereafter\r\nas new States. I should speak, perhaps, with more confidence, if some\r\nWhigs of the North had not voted for the treaty. My own opinion was then\r\nclear and decisive. For myself I thought the case a perfectly plain one,\r\nand no man has yet stated a reason to convince me to the contrary.\r\n\r\nI voted to strike out the articles of cession. They would have been\r\nstruck out if four of the New England Senators had not voted against the\r\nmotion. I then voted against the ratification of the treaty, and that\r\ntreaty would have failed if three New England Senators had not voted for\r\nit, and Whig Senators too. I should do the same thing again, and with\r\nmuch more resolution. I would have run a still greater risk, I would\r\nhave endured a still greater shock, I would have risked anything, rather\r\nthan have been a participator in any measure which should have a\r\ntendency to annex Southern territory to the States of the Union. I hope\r\nit will be remembered, in all future time, that on this question of the\r\naccession of these new territories of almost boundless extent, I voted\r\nagainst them, and against the treaty which contained them,\r\nnotwithstanding all inducements to the contrary, and all the cries,\r\nwhich I thought hasty and injudicious, of \"Peace! Peace on any terms!\" I\r\nwill add, that those who voted against the treaty were gentlemen from so\r\nmany parts of the country, that its rejection would have been an act\r\nrather of national than of local resistance. There were votes against it\r\nfrom both parties, and from all parties, the South and the West, the\r\nNorth and the East. What we wanted was a few more New England votes.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, after I had the honor of receiving the invitation to meet my\r\nfellow-citizens, I found it necessary, in the discharge of my duty,\r\nthough with great inconvenience to my health, to be present at the\r\nclosing scenes of the session. You know what there transpired. You know\r\nthe important decision that was made in both houses of Congress, in\r\nregard to Oregon. The immediate question respected Oregon, or rather the\r\nbill respected Oregon, but the question more particularly concerned\r\nthese new territories. The effect of the bill as passed in the Senate\r\nwas to establish these new territories as slave-holding States. The\r\nHouse disagreed. The Senate receded from their ground, and the bill\r\npassed, establishing Oregon as a free Territory, and making no provision\r\nfor the newly acquired territories on the South. My vote, and the\r\nreasons I gave for it, are known to the good people of Massachusetts,\r\nand I have not heard that they have expressed any particular\r\ndisapprobation of them.\r\n\r\nBut this question is to be resumed at the first session of the next\r\nCongress. There is no probability that it will be settled at the next\r\nsession of this Congress. But at least at the first session of the next\r\nCongress this question will be resumed. It will enter at this very\r\nperiod into all the elections of the South.\r\n\r\nAnd now I venture to say, Gentlemen, two things; the first well known to\r\nyou, that General Cass is in favor of what is called the Compromise\r\nLine, and is of opinion that the Wilmot Proviso, or the Ordinance of\r\n1787, which excludes slavery from territories, ought not to be applied\r\nto territories lying south of 36° 30'. He announced this before he was\r\nnominated, and if he had not announced it, he would have been 36° 30'\r\nfarther off from being nominated. In the next place, he will do all he\r\ncan to establish that compromise line; and lastly, which is a matter of\r\nopinion, in my conscientious belief he will establish it.\r\n\r\nGive him the power and the patronage of the government, let him exercise\r\nit over certain portions of the country whose representatives voted on\r\nthis occasion to put off that question for future consideration; let him\r\nhave the power of this government with his attachments, with his\r\ninducements, and we shall see the result. I verily believe, that unless\r\nthere is a renewed strength, an augmented strength, of Whig votes in\r\nCongress, he will accomplish his purpose. He will surely have the\r\nSenate, and with the patronage of the government, with every interest\r\nwhich he can bring to bear, co-operating with every interest which the\r\nSouth can bring to bear, he will establish the compromise line. We cry\r\nsafety before we are out of the woods, if we feel that the danger\r\nrespecting the territories is over.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I came here to confer with you as friends and countrymen, to\r\nspeak my own mind and hear yours; but if we all should speak, and occupy\r\nas much time as I have, we should make a late meeting. I shall detain\r\nyou no longer. I have been long in public life, longer, far longer than\r\nI shall remain there. I have had some participation for more than thirty\r\nyears in the councils of the nation. I profess to feel a strong\r\nattachment to the liberty of the United States, to the Constitution and\r\nfree institutions of this country, to the honor, and I may say the\r\nglory, of my native land. I feel every injury inflicted upon it, almost\r\nas a personal injury. I blush for every fault which I think I see\r\ncommitted in its public councils, as if they were faults or mistakes of\r\nmy own. I know that, at this moment, there is no object upon earth so\r\nmuch attracting the gaze of the intelligent and civilized nations of the\r\nearth as this great republic. All men look at us, all men examine our\r\ncourse, all good men are anxious for a favorable result to this great\r\nexperiment of republican liberty. We are on a hill and cannot be hid. We\r\ncannot withdraw ourselves either from the commendation or the reproaches\r\nof the civilized world. They see us as that star of empire which half a\r\ncentury ago was represented as making its way westward. I wish they may\r\nsee it as a mild, placid, though brilliant orb, moving athwart the whole\r\nheavens to the enlightening and cheering of mankind; and not as a meteor\r\nof fire and blood terrifying the nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJEREMIAH MASON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The death of the Hon. Jeremiah Mason, one of the most eminent members\r\nof the legal profession in the United States, took place at Boston, on\r\nthe 14th of October, 1848. At a meeting of the Bar of the County of\r\nSuffolk, Mass., held on the 17th instant, appropriate resolutions in\r\nhonor of the deceased, accompanied with a few eloquent observations,\r\nwere introduced by Mr. Choate, and unanimously adopted. It was voted by\r\nthe meeting, that Mr. Webster should be requested to present these\r\nresolutions to the Supreme Judicial Court at its next term in Boston.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this request, at the opening of the next term of the\r\ncourt, on the 14th of November, 1848, prayer having been offered, Mr.\r\nWebster rose and spoke as follows.]\r\n\r\nMay it please your Honors,--JEREMIAH MASON, one of the counsellors of\r\nthis court, departed this life on the 14th of October, at his residence\r\nin this city. The death of one of its members, so highly respected, so\r\nmuch admired and venerated, could not fail to produce a striking\r\nimpression upon the members of this bar; and a meeting was immediately\r\ncalled, at which a member of this court, just on the eve of leaving the\r\npractice of his profession for a seat on the bench,[1] presided; and\r\nresolutions expressive of the sense entertained by the bar of the high\r\ncharacter of the deceased, and of sincere condolence with those whom his\r\nloss touched more nearly, were moved by one of his distinguished\r\nbrethren, and adopted with entire unanimity. My brethren have appointed\r\nme to the honorable duty of presenting these resolutions to this court;\r\nand it is in discharge of that duty that I rise to address you, and pray\r\nthat the resolutions which I hold in my hand may be read by the clerk.\r\n\r\n     The clerk of the court then read the resolutions, as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the members of this bar have heard with profound\r\n     emotion of the decease of the Honorable Jeremiah Mason, one of the\r\n     most eminent and distinguished of the great men who have ever\r\n     adorned this profession; and, as well in discharge of a public\r\n     duty, as in obedience to the dictates of our private feelings, we\r\n     think it proper to mark this occasion by some attempt to record our\r\n     estimate of his pre-eminent abilities and high character.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the public character and services of Mr. Mason\r\n     demand prominent commemoration; that, throughout his long life,\r\n     whether as a private person or in public place, he maintained a\r\n     wide and various intercourse with public men, and cherished a\r\n     constant and deep interest in public affairs, and by his vast\r\n     practical wisdom and sagacity, the fruit of extraordinary\r\n     intellectual endowments, matured thought, and profound observation,\r\n     and by the soundness of his opinions and the comprehensiveness and\r\n     elevated tone of his politics, he exerted at all times a great and\r\n     most salutary influence upon the sentiments and policy of the\r\n     community and the country; and that, as a Senator in the Congress\r\n     of the United States during a period of many years, and in a crisis\r\n     of affairs which demanded the wisdom of the wisest and the civil\r\n     virtues of the best, he was distinguished among the most eminent\r\n     men of his country for ability in debate, for attention to all the\r\n     duties of his great trust, for moderation, for prudence, for\r\n     fidelity to the obligations of that party connection to which he\r\n     was attached, for fidelity still more conspicuous and still more\r\n     admirable to the higher obligations of a thoughtful and enlarged\r\n     patriotism.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That it was the privilege of Mr. Mason to come to the\r\n     bar when the jurisprudence of New England was yet in its infancy;\r\n     that he brought to its cultivation great general ability, and a\r\n     practical sagacity, logical power, and patient\r\n     research,--constituting altogether a legal genius, rarely if ever\r\n     surpassed; that it was greatly through his influence that the\r\n     growing wants of a prosperous State were met and satisfied by a\r\n     system of common law at once flexible and certain, deduced by the\r\n     highest human wisdom from the actual wants of the community,\r\n     logically correct, and practically useful; that in the fact that\r\n     the State of New Hampshire now possesses such a system of law,\r\n     whose gladsome light has shone on other States, are seen both the\r\n     product and the monument of his labors, less conspicuous, but not\r\n     less real, than if embodied in codes and institutes bearing his\r\n     name; yet that, bred as he was to the common law, his great powers,\r\n     opened and liberalized by its study and practice, enabled him to\r\n     grasp readily, and wield with entire ease, those systems of equity,\r\n     applicable to the transactions of the land or the sea, which, in\r\n     recent times, have so much meliorated and improved the\r\n     administration of justice in our country.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That as respects his practice as a counsellor and\r\n     advocate at this bar, we would record our sense of his integrity,\r\n     prudence, fidelity, depth of learning, knowledge of men and\r\n     affairs, and great powers of persuading kindred minds; and we know\r\n     well, that, when _he_ died, there was extinguished one of the few\r\n     great lights of the old common law.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That Mr. Webster be requested to present these\r\n     resolutions to the Supreme Judicial Court, at its next term, in\r\n     Boston; and the District Attorney of the United States be requested\r\n     to present them to the Circuit Court of the United States now in\r\n     session.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the Secretary communicate to the family of Mr.\r\n     Mason a copy of these resolutions, together with the respectful\r\n     sympathy of the bar.\"\r\n\r\nThe proprieties of this occasion (continued Mr. Webster) compel me, with\r\nwhatever reluctance, to refrain from the indulgence of the personal\r\nfeelings which arise in my heart, upon the death of one with whom I have\r\ncultivated a sincere, affectionate, and unbroken friendship, from the\r\nday when I commenced my own professional career, to the closing hour of\r\nhis life. I will not say, of the advantages which I have derived from\r\nhis intercourse and conversation, all that Mr. Fox said of Edmund Burke;\r\nbut I am bound to say, that of my own professional discipline and\r\nattainments, whatever they may be, I owe much to that close attention to\r\nthe discharge of my duties which I was compelled to pay, for nine\r\nsuccessive years, from day to day, by Mr. Mason's efforts and arguments\r\nat the same bar. _Fas est ab hoste doceri_; and I must have been\r\nunintelligent, indeed, not to have learned something from the constant\r\ndisplays of that power which I had so much occasion to see and to feel.\r\n\r\nIt is the more appropriate duty of the present moment to give some short\r\nnotice of his life, character, and the qualities of his mind and heart,\r\nso that he may be presented as an example to those who are entering upon\r\nor pursuing the same career. Four or five years ago, Mr. Mason drew up a\r\nbiography of himself, from the earliest period of his recollection to\r\nthe time of his removal to Portsmouth, in 1797; which is interesting,\r\nnot only for the information it gives of the mode in which the habits of\r\nhis life were formed, but also for the manner of its composition.\r\n\r\nHe was born on the 27th day of April, 1768, at Lebanon in Connecticut.\r\nHis remotest ancestor in this country was Captain John Mason (an officer\r\nwho had served with distinction in the Netherlands, under Sir Thomas\r\nFairfax), who came from England in 1630, and settled at Dorchester in\r\nthe Colony of Massachusetts. His great-grandfather lived at Haddam. His\r\ngrandfather, born in 1705, lived at Norwich, and died in the year 1779.\r\nMr. Mason remembered him, and recollected his character, as that of a\r\nrespectable and deeply religious man. His ancestor on the maternal side\r\nwas James Fitch, a learned divine, who came from England and settled in\r\nSaybrook, but removed to Lebanon, where he died. A Latin epitaph, in the\r\nancient burying-ground of that town, records his merits. One of his\r\ndescendants held a large tract of land in the parish of Goshen, in the\r\ntown of Lebanon, by grant from the Indians; one half of which, near a\r\ncentury afterwards, was bequeathed to his daughter, Elizabeth Fitch, the\r\nmother of Mr. Mason. To this property Mr. Mason's father removed soon\r\nafter his marriage, and there he died, in 1813. The title of this land\r\nwas obtained from Uncas, an Indian sachem in that neighborhood, by the\r\ngreat-grandfather of Mr. Mason's mother, and has never been alienated\r\nfrom the family. It is now owned by Mr. Mason's nephew, Jeremiah Mason,\r\nthe son of his eldest brother James. The family has been distinguished\r\nfor longevity; the average ages of Mr. Mason's six immediate ancestors\r\nhaving exceeded eighty-three years each. Mr. Mason was the sixth of nine\r\nchildren, all of whom are now dead.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason's father was a man of intelligence and activity, of\r\nconsiderable opulence, and highly esteemed by the community. At the\r\ncommencement of the Revolutionary war, being a zealous Whig, he raised\r\nand commanded a company of minute-men, as they were called, and marched\r\nto the siege of Boston. Here he rendered important service, being\r\nstationed at Dorchester Heights, and engaged in fortifying that\r\nposition. In the autumn of that year, he was promoted to a colonelcy,\r\nand joined the army with his regiment, in the neighborhood of New York.\r\nAt the end of the campaign, he returned home out of health, but retained\r\nthe command of his regiment, which he rallied and brought out with\r\ncelerity and spirit when General Arnold assaulted and burned New London.\r\nHe became attached to military life, and regretted that he had not at an\r\nearly day entered the Continental service. Colonel Mason was a good man,\r\naffectionate to his family, kind and obliging to his neighbors, and\r\nfaithful in the observance of all moral and religious duties.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason's mother was distinguished for a good understanding, much\r\ndiscretion, the purity of her heart and affections, and the exemplary\r\nkindness and benevolence of her life. It was her great anxiety to give\r\nall her children the best education, within the means of the family,\r\nwhich the state of the country would allow; and she was particularly\r\ndesirous that Jeremiah should be sent to college. \"In my recollection of\r\nmy mother,\" says Mr. Mason, \"she was the personification of love,\r\nkindness, and benevolence.\"\r\n\r\nDestined for an education and for professional life, Mr. Mason was sent\r\nto Yale College, at sixteen years of age; his preparatory studies having\r\nbeen pursued under \"Master Tisdale,\" who had then been forty years at\r\nthe head of a school in Lebanon, which had become distinguished, and\r\namong the scholars of which were the Wheelocks, afterwards Presidents of\r\nDartmouth College. He was graduated in 1784, and performed a part in the\r\nCommencement exercises, which greatly raised the expectation of his\r\nfriends, and gratified and animated his love for distinction. \"In the\r\ncourse of a long and active life,\" says he, \"I recollect no occasion\r\nwhen I have experienced such elevation of feeling.\" This was the effect\r\nof that spirit of emulation which incited the whole course of his life\r\nof usefulness. There is now prevalent among us a morbid and sickly\r\nnotion, that emulation, even as honorable rivalry, is a debasing\r\npassion, and not to be encouraged. It supposes that the mind should be\r\nleft without such excitement, in a dreamy and undisturbed state, flowing\r\nor not flowing, according to its own impulse, without such aids as are\r\nfurnished by the rivalry of one with another. For one, I do not believe\r\nin this. I hold to the doctrine of the old school, as to this part of\r\neducation. Quinctilian says: \"Sunt quidam, nisi institeris, remissi;\r\nquidam imperio indignantur: quosdam continet metus, quosdam debilitat:\r\nalios continuatio extundit, in aliis plus impetus facit. Mihi ille detur\r\npuer, quem laus excitet, quem gloria juvet, qui victus fleat; hic erit\r\nalendus ambitu, hunc mordebit objurgatio, hunc honor excitabit; in hoc\r\ndesidiam nunquam verebor.\" I think this is sound sense and just feeling.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason was destined for the law, and commenced the study of that\r\nprofession with Mr. Baldwin, a gentleman who has lived to perform\r\nimportant public and private duties, has served his country in Congress,\r\nand on the bench of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, and still lives to\r\nhear the account of the peaceful death of his distinguished pupil. After\r\na year, he went to Vermont, in whose recently established tribunals he\r\nexpected to find a new sphere for the gratification of ambition, and the\r\nemployment of talents. He studied in the office of Stephen Rowe Bradley,\r\nafterwards a Senator in Congress; and was admitted to the bar, in\r\nVermont and New Hampshire, in the year 1791.\r\n\r\nHe began his career in Westmoreland, a few miles below Walpole, at the\r\nage of twenty-three; but in 1794, three years afterwards, removed to\r\nWalpole, as being a larger village, where there was more society and\r\nmore business. There was at that time on the Connecticut River a rather\r\nunusual number of gentlemen, distinguished for polite accomplishments\r\nand correct tastes in literature, and among them some well known to the\r\npublic as respectable writers and authors. Among these were Mr. Benjamin\r\nWest, Mr. Dennie, Mr. Royall Tyler, Mr. Jacobs, Mr. Samuel Hunt, Mr.\r\nJ.W. Blake, Mr. Colman (who established, and for a long time edited, the\r\n\"New York Evening Post\"), and Mr. Olcott. In the association with these\r\ngentlemen, and those like them, Mr. Mason found an agreeable position,\r\nand cultivated tastes and habits of the highest character.\r\n\r\nAbout this period, he made a journey to Virginia, on some business\r\nconnected with land titles, where he had much intercourse with\r\nMajor-General Henry Lee; and, on his return, he saw President\r\nWashington, at Philadelphia, and was greatly struck by the urbanity and\r\ndignity of his manner. He heard Fisher Ames make his celebrated speech\r\nupon the British treaty. All that the world has said with regard to the\r\nextraordinary effect produced by that speech, and its wonderful\r\nexcellence, is fully confirmed by the opinion of Mr. Mason. He speaks of\r\nit as one of the highest exhibitions of popular oratory that he had ever\r\nwitnessed; popular, not in any low sense, but popular as being addressed\r\nto a popular body, and high in all the qualities of sound reasoning and\r\nenlightened eloquence.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason was inclined to exercise his abilities in a larger sphere. He\r\nhad at this time made the acquaintance of Aaron Burr and Alexander\r\nHamilton. The former advised Mr. Mason to remove himself to New York.\r\nHis own preference was for Boston; but he thought, that, filled as it\r\nthen was by distinguished professional ability, it was too crowded to\r\nallow him a place. That was a mistake. On the contrary, the bar of this\r\ncity, with the utmost liberality and generosity of feeling and\r\nsentiment, have always been ready to receive, with open arms, every\r\nhonorable acquisition to the dignity and usefulness of the profession,\r\nfrom other States. Mr. Mason, however, removed to Portsmouth in the\r\nautumn of 1797; and, as was to be expected, his practice soon became\r\nextensive. He was appointed Attorney-General in 1802. About that time,\r\nthe late learned and lamented Chief Justice Smith retired from his\r\nprofessional duties, to take his place as a judge; and Mr. Mason became\r\nthe acknowledged head of his profession. He resigned the office of\r\nAttorney-General, three or four years afterwards, to the great regret of\r\nthe court, the bar, and the country. As a prosecuting officer, he was\r\ncourteous, inflexible, and just; careful that the guilty should not\r\nescape, and that the honest should be protected. He was impartial,\r\nalmost judicial, in the administration of his great office. He had no\r\nmorbid eagerness for conviction; and never permitted, as sometimes\r\noccurs, an unworthy wrangling between the official power prosecuting,\r\nand the zeal of the other party defending. His official course produced\r\nexactly the ends it was designed to do. The honest felt safe; but there\r\nwas a trembling and fear in the evil disposed, that the transgressed\r\nlaw would be vindicated.\r\n\r\nVery much confined to his profession, he never sought office or\r\npolitical elevation. Yet he held decided opinions upon all political\r\nquestions, and cultivated acquaintance with all the leading subjects of\r\nthe day; and no man was more keenly alive than he to whatever occurred,\r\nat home or abroad, involving the great interests of the civilized world.\r\n\r\nHis political principles, opinions, judgments, were framed upon those of\r\nthe men of the times of Washington. From these, to the last, he never\r\nswerved. The copy was well executed. His conversation on subjects of\r\nstate was as instructive and interesting as upon professional topics. He\r\nhad the same reach of thought, and exhibited the same comprehensive\r\nmind, and sagacity quick and far seeing, with regard to political things\r\nand men, as he did in professional affairs. His influence was,\r\ntherefore, hardly the less from the fact that he was not actively\r\nengaged in political life. There was an additional weight given to his\r\njudgment, arising from his being a disinterested beholder only. The\r\nlooker-on can sometimes form a more independent and impartial opinion of\r\nthe course and results of the contest, than those who are actually\r\nengaged in it.\r\n\r\nBut at length, in June, 1813, he was persuaded to accept the post of a\r\nSenator of the United States, and took his seat that month. He was in\r\nCongress during the sessions of 1813 and 1814. Those were very exciting\r\ntimes; party spirit ran very high, and each party put forward its most\r\nprominent and gifted men. Both houses were filled by the greatest\r\nintellects of the country. Mr. Mason found himself by the side of Rufus\r\nKing, Giles, Goldsborough, Gore, Barbour, Daggett, Hunter, and other\r\ndistinguished public men. Among men of whatever party, and however much\r\nsome of them differed from him in opinion or political principle, there\r\nwas not one of them all but felt pleasure if he spoke, and respected his\r\nuncommon ability and probity, and his fair and upright demeanor in his\r\nplace and station. He took at once his appropriate position. Of his\r\nassociates and admirers in the other house, there are some eminent\r\npersons now living who were occasional listeners to his speeches and\r\nmuch struck with his ability; together with Pickering, Benson, Pitkin,\r\nStockton, Lowndes, Gaston, and Hopkinson, now all deceased, who used to\r\nflock to hear him, and always derived deep gratification and instruction\r\nfrom his talents, character, and power.\r\n\r\nHe resigned his seat in the Senate in 1817. His published speeches are\r\nnot numerous. The reports of that day were far less complete than now,\r\nand comparatively few debates were preserved and revised. It was a\r\nremarkable truth, that he always thought far too lightly of himself and\r\nall his productions. I know that he was with difficulty persuaded to\r\nprepare his speeches in Congress for publication; and in this memorial\r\nof himself which I have before me he says, with every appearance and\r\nfeeling of sincerity, that he \"has never acted any important part in\r\nlife, but has felt a deep interest in the conduct of others.\"\r\n\r\nHis two main speeches were, first, one of great vigor, in the Senate, in\r\nFebruary, 1814, on the Embargo, just before that policy was abandoned.\r\nThe other was later, in December, 1815, shortly before the peace, on Mr.\r\nGiles's Conscription Bill, in which he discussed the subject of the\r\nenlistment of minors; and the clause authorizing such enlistment was\r\nstruck out upon his motion.\r\n\r\nHe was afterwards for several years a member of the New Hampshire\r\nLegislature, and assisted in revising the code of that State. He paid\r\nmuch attention to the subject of the judicature, and performed his\r\nservices fully to the satisfaction of the State; and the result of his\r\nlabors was warmly commended. In 1824 he was again a candidate for the\r\nSenate of the United States. The election was to be made by the\r\nconcurrent vote of the two branches of the Legislature. In the popular\r\nbranch he was chosen by a strong vote. The Senate, however,\r\nnon-concurred; by which means the election was lost,--a loss to the\r\ncountry, not to him,--by force of circumstances and agencies not now or\r\never fit to be recalled or remembered.\r\n\r\nHe continued to reside for many years in Portsmouth. His residence in\r\nthat ancient town was a happy one. He was happy in his family and in the\r\nsociety of the town, surrounded by agreeable neighbors, respected by the\r\nbar and the court, and standing at the head of his profession. He had a\r\ngreat love of conversation. He took pleasure in hearing others talk, and\r\ngave an additional charm by the freshness, agreeableness, and\r\noriginality of his own observations. His warm hospitality left him never\r\nalone, and his usefulness was felt as much within the walls of the\r\nhomes, as of the tribunals, of Portsmouth. There are yet many in that\r\ntown who love him and his; many who witnessed, as children, and\r\nrecollect, the enthusiasm with which he was greeted by their fathers and\r\nmothers; and all in New Hampshire old enough to remember him will feel\r\nwhat we feel here on this occasion.\r\n\r\nLed at last partly by the desire of exerting his abilities in a larger\r\nsphere of usefulness, and partly by the fact of the residence here of\r\nbeloved domestic connections, he came to this city, and entered upon the\r\nperformance of his professional duties in 1832. Of the manner in which\r\nhe discharged those duties, this court is the most competent judge. You,\r\nMr. Chief Justice, and the venerable associate who usually occupies a\r\nplace at your right,[2] have been witnesses of the whole. You know the\r\nfidelity with which he observed his duty to the court, as well as his\r\nduty to his clients. In learning, assiduity, respect for the bench,\r\nuprightness, and integrity, he stood as an example to the bar. You know\r\nthe general probity and talent with which he performed, for so many\r\nyears, the duty of a counsellor of this court.\r\n\r\nI should hardly trust myself to make any analysis of Mr. Mason's mind. I\r\nmay be a partial judge. But I may speak of what I myself admire and\r\nvenerate. The characteristics of Mr. Mason's mind, as I think, were real\r\ngreatness, strength, and sagacity. He was great through strong sense and\r\nsound judgment, great by comprehensive views of things, great by high\r\nand elevated purposes. Perhaps sometimes he was too cautious and\r\nrefined, and his distinctions became too minute; but his discrimination\r\narose from a force of intellect, and quick-seeing, far-reaching\r\nsagacity, everywhere discerning his object and pursuing it steadily.\r\nWhether it was popular or professional, he grasped a point and held it\r\nwith a strong hand. He was sarcastic sometimes, but not frequently; not\r\nfrothy or petulant, but cool and vitriolic. Unfortunate for him on whom\r\nhis sarcasm fell!\r\n\r\nHis conversation was as remarkable as his efforts at the bar. It was\r\noriginal, fresh, and suggestive; never dull or indifferent. He never\r\ntalked when he had nothing to say. He was particularly agreeable,\r\nedifying, and instructive to all about him; and this was the charm of\r\nthe social intercourse in which he was connected.\r\n\r\nAs a professional man, Mr. Mason's great ability lay in the department\r\nof the common law. In this part of jurisprudence he was profoundly\r\nlearned. He had drunk copiously from its deepest springs; and he had\r\nstudied with diligence and success the departures from the English\r\ncommon law which had taken place in this country, either necessarily,\r\nfrom difference of condition, or positively, by force of our own\r\nstatutes. In his addresses, both to courts and juries, he affected to\r\ndespise all eloquence, and certainly disdained all ornament; but his\r\nefforts, whether addressed to one tribunal or the other, were marked by\r\na degree of clearness, directness, and force not easy to be equalled.\r\nThere were no courts of equity, as a separate and distinct jurisdiction,\r\nin New Hampshire, during his residence in that State. Yet the equity\r\ntreatises and equity reports were all in his library, not \"wisely ranged\r\nfor show,\" but for constant and daily consultation; because he saw that\r\nthe common law itself was growing every day more and more liberal, that\r\nequity principles were constantly forcing themselves into its\r\nadministration and within its rules; that the subjects of litigation in\r\nthe courts were constantly becoming, more and more, such as escaped from\r\nthe technicalities and the trammels of the common law, and offered\r\nthemselves for discussion and decision on the broader principles of\r\ngeneral jurisprudence. Mr. Mason, like other accomplished lawyers, and\r\nmore than most, admired the searching scrutiny and the high morality of\r\na court of equity; and felt the instruction and edification resulting\r\nfrom the perusal of the judgments of Lord Hardwicke, Lord Eldon, and Sir\r\nWilliam Grant, as well as of those of great names in our own country,\r\nnot now among the living.\r\n\r\nAmong his early associates in New Hampshire, there were many\r\ndistinguished men. Of those now dead were Mr. West, Mr. Gordon, Edward\r\nSt. Loe Livermore, Peleg Sprague, William K. Atkinson, George Sullivan,\r\nThomas W. Thompson, and Amos Kent; the last of these having been always\r\na particular personal friend. All of these gentlemen in their day held\r\nhigh and respectable stations, and were eminent as lawyers of probity\r\nand character.\r\n\r\nAnother contemporary and friend of Mr. Mason was Mr. Timothy Bigelow, a\r\nlawyer of reputation, a man of probity and honor, attractive by his\r\nconversation, and highly agreeable in his social intercourse. Mr.\r\nBigelow, we all know, was of this State, in which he filled high offices\r\nwith great credit; but, as a counsellor and advocate, he was constant in\r\nhis attendance on the New Hampshire courts. Having known Mr. Bigelow\r\nfrom my early youth, I have pleasure in recalling the mutual regard and\r\nfriendship which I know to have subsisted between him and the subject of\r\nthese remarks. I ought not to omit Mr. Wilson and Mr. Betton, in\r\nmentioning Mr. Mason's contemporaries at the bar. They were near his own\r\nage, and both well known as lawyers and public men.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason, while yet in New Hampshire, found himself engaged in causes\r\nin which that illustrious man, Samuel Dexter, also appeared. The late\r\nMr. Justice Story was still more frequently at the bar of that State;\r\nand, at a period somewhat earlier, your great and distinguished\r\npredecessor, Chief Justice Parsons, occasionally presented himself\r\nbefore the courts at Portsmouth or Exeter, and he is known to have\r\nentertained a very high regard, personal and professional, as well for\r\nMr. Mason as for the late Chief Justice Smith.\r\n\r\nAmong those still living, with whom Mr. Mason was on terms of intimacy,\r\nand with whom he associated at the bar, were Messrs. Plumer, Arthur\r\nLivermore, Samuel Bell, and Charles H. Atherton. If these respected men\r\ncould be here to-day, every one of them would unite with us in our\r\ntribute of love and veneration to his memory.\r\n\r\nBut, Sir, political eminence and professional fame fade away and die\r\nwith all things earthly. Nothing of character is really permanent but\r\nvirtue and personal worth. These remain. Whatever of excellence is\r\nwrought into the soul itself belongs to both worlds. Real goodness does\r\nnot attach itself merely to this life; it points to another world.\r\nPolitical or professional reputation cannot last for ever; but a\r\nconscience void of offence before God and man is an inheritance for\r\neternity. _Religion_, therefore, is a necessary and indispensable\r\nelement in any great human character. There is no living without it.\r\nReligion is the tie that connects man with his Creator, and holds him to\r\nhis throne. If that tie be all sundered, all broken, he floats away, a\r\nworthless atom in the universe; its proper attractions all gone, its\r\ndestiny thwarted, and its whole future nothing but darkness, desolation,\r\nand death. A man with no sense of religious duty is he whom the\r\nScriptures describe, in such terse but terrific language, as living\r\n\"without God in the world.\" Such a man is out of his proper being, out\r\nof the circle of all his duties, out of the circle of all his happiness,\r\nand away, far, far away, from the purposes of his creation.\r\n\r\nA mind like Mr. Mason's, active, thoughtful, penetrating, sedate, could\r\nnot but meditate deeply on the condition of man below, and feel its\r\nresponsibilities. He could not look on this mighty system,\r\n\r\n    \"This universal frame, thus wondrous fair,\"\r\n\r\nwithout feeling that it was created and upheld by an Intelligence, to\r\nwhich all other intelligences must be responsible. I am bound to say,\r\nthat in the course of my life I never met with an individual, in any\r\nprofession or condition of life, who always spoke, and always thought,\r\nwith such awful reverence of the power and presence of God. No\r\nirreverence, no lightness, even no too familiar allusion to God and his\r\nattributes, ever escaped his lips. The very notion of a Supreme Being\r\nwas, with him, made up of awe and solemnity. It filled the whole of his\r\ngreat mind with the strongest emotions. A man like him, with all his\r\nproper sentiments and sensibilities alive in him, must, in this state of\r\nexistence, have something to believe and something to hope for; or else,\r\nas life is advancing to its close and parting, all is heart-sinking and\r\noppression. Depend upon it, whatever may be the mind of an old man, old\r\nage is only really happy, when, on feeling the enjoyments of this world\r\npass away, it begins to lay a stronger hold on those of another.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason's religious sentiments and feelings were the crowning glories\r\nof his character. One, with the strongest motives to love and venerate\r\nhim, and the best means of knowledge, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"So far as my memory extends, he always showed a deep conviction of\r\n     the divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, of the institutions of\r\n     Christianity, and of the importance of personal religion. Soon\r\n     after his residence in Boston, he entered the communion of the\r\n     Church, and has continued since regularly to receive the Lord's\r\n     Supper. From that time, he also habitually maintained domestic\r\n     worship, morning and evening. The death of two of his sons produced\r\n     a deep impression upon his mind, and directed it in an increased\r\n     degree to religious subjects.\r\n\r\n     \"Though he was always reserved in the expression of religious\r\n     feeling, still it has been very apparent, for several years, that\r\n     his thoughts dwelt much upon his practical religious duties, and\r\n     especially upon preparation for another world. Within three or four\r\n     years, he frequently led the conversation to such subjects; and\r\n     during the year past, immediate preparation for his departure has\r\n     been obviously the constant subject of his attention. His\r\n     expressions in regard to it were deeply humble; and, indeed, the\r\n     very humble manner in which he always spoke of himself was most\r\n     marked.\r\n\r\n     \"I have observed, of late years, an increasing tenderness in his\r\n     feelings and manner, and a desire to impress his family with the\r\n     conviction that he would not remain long with them. His allusions\r\n     of this kind have been repeated, even when apparently in his usual\r\n     health; and they indicated the current of his thoughts.\r\n\r\n     \"He retained his consciousness till within a few hours of his\r\n     death, and made distinct replies to every question put to him. He\r\n     was fully aware that his end was near; and in answer to the\r\n     question, 'Can you now rest with firm faith upon the merits of your\r\n     Divine Redeemer?' he said, 'I trust I do, upon what else can I\r\n     rest?'\r\n\r\n     \"At another time, in reply to a similar question, he said, '_Of\r\n     course_, I have no other ground of hope.' We did not often speak to\r\n     him during those last three days, but had no doubt that he was\r\n     entirely conscious of his state, knew that his family were all\r\n     near, and that his mind was free from anxiety. He could not speak\r\n     with ease, and we were unwilling to cause him the pain of exertion.\r\n     His whole life, marked by uniform greatness, wisdom, and integrity,\r\n     his deep humility, his profound reverence for the Divine Majesty,\r\n     his habitual preparation for death, his humble trust in his\r\n     Saviour, left nothing to be desired for the consolation of his\r\n     family under this great loss. He was gradually prepared for his\r\n     departure. His last years were passed in calm retirement; and he\r\n     died as he wished to die, with his faculties unimpaired, without\r\n     great pain, with his family around his bed, the precious promises\r\n     of the Gospel before his mind, without lingering disease, and yet\r\n     not suddenly called away.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, Mr. Chief Justice, was the life, and such the death, of JEREMIAH\r\nMASON. For one, I could pour out my heart like water, at the\r\nrecollection of his virtues and his friendship, and in the feeling of\r\nhis loss. I would embalm his memory in my best affections. His personal\r\nregard, so long continued to me, I esteem one of the greatest blessings\r\nof my life; and I hope that it may be known hereafter, that, without\r\nintermission or coolness through many years, and until he descended to\r\nhis grave, Mr. Mason and myself were friends.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason died in old age; not by a violent stroke from the hand of\r\ndeath, not by a sudden rupture of the ties of nature, but by a gradual\r\nwearing out of his constitution. He enjoyed through life, indeed,\r\nremarkable health. He took competent exercise, loved the open air, and,\r\navoiding all extreme theories or practice, controlled his conduct and\r\nhabits of life by the rules of prudence and moderation. His death was\r\ntherefore not unlike that described by the angel, admonishing Adam:--\r\n\r\n    \"I yield it just, said Adam, and submit.\r\n    But is there yet no other way, besides\r\n    These painful passages, how we may come\r\n    To death, and mix with our connatural dust?\r\n\r\n    \"There is, said Michael, if thou well observe\r\n    The rule of 'Not too much,' by temperance taught,\r\n    In what thou eat'st and drink'st; seeking from thence\r\n    Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight;\r\n    Till many years over thy head return,\r\n    So mayst thou live; till, like ripe fruit, thou drop\r\n    Into thy mother's lap; or be with ease\r\n    Gathered, not harshly plucked; for death mature.\r\n    This is old age.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Justice Richard Fletcher.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. Justice Wilde.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKOSSUTH.\r\n\r\nFROM A SPEECH DELIVERED IN BOSTON, ON THE 7TH OF NOVEMBER, 1849, AT A\r\nFESTIVAL OF THE NATIVES OF NEW HAMPSHIRE ESTABLISHED IN MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have all had our sympathies much enlisted in the Hungarian effort for\r\nliberty. We have all wept at its failure. We thought we saw a more\r\nrational hope of establishing free government in Hungary than in any\r\nother part of Europe, where the question has been in agitation within\r\nthe last twelve months. But despotic power from abroad intervened to\r\nsuppress that hope.\r\n\r\nAnd, Gentlemen, what will come of it I do not know. For my part, at this\r\nmoment, I feel more indignant at recent events connected with Hungary\r\nthan at all those which passed in her struggle for liberty. I see that\r\nthe Emperor of Russia demands of Turkey that the noble Kossuth and his\r\ncompanions shall be given up, to be dealt with at his pleasure. And I\r\nsee that this demand is made in derision of the established law of\r\nnations. Gentlemen, there is something on earth greater than arbitrary\r\nor despotic power. The lightning has its power, and the whirlwind has\r\nits power, and the earthquake has its power; but there is something\r\namong men more capable of shaking despotic thrones than lightning,\r\nwhirlwind, or earthquake, and that is, the excited and aroused\r\nindignation of the whole civilized world. Gentlemen, the Emperor of\r\nRussia holds himself to be bound by the law of nations, from the fact\r\nthat he negotiates with civilized nations, and that he forms alliances\r\nand treaties with them. He professes, in fact, to live in a civilized\r\nage, and to govern an enlightened nation. I say, that if, under these\r\ncircumstances, he shall perpetrate so great a violation of national law\r\nas to seize these Hungarians and to execute them, he will stand as a\r\ncriminal and malefactor in the view of the public law of the world. The\r\nwhole world will be the tribunal to try him, and he must appear before\r\nit, and hold up his hand, and plead, and abide its judgment.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Russia is the supreme lawgiver in his own country, and,\r\nfor aught I know, the executor of that law also. But, thanks be to God,\r\nhe is not the supreme lawgiver or executor of national law, and every\r\noffence against that is an offence against the rights of the civilized\r\nworld. If he breaks that law in the case of Turkey, or any other case,\r\nthe whole world has a right to call him out, and to demand his\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nOur rights as a nation, like those of other nations, are held under the\r\nsanction of national law; a law which becomes more important from day to\r\nday; a law which none, who profess to agree to it, are at liberty to\r\nviolate. Nor let him imagine, nor let any one imagine, that mere force\r\ncan subdue the general sentiment of mankind. It is much more likely to\r\ndiffuse that sentiment, and to destroy the power which he most desires\r\nto establish and secure.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, the bones of poor John Wickliffe were dug out of his grave,\r\nseventy years after his death, and burnt for his heresy; and his ashes\r\nwere thrown upon a river in Warwickshire. Some prophet of that day said:\r\n\r\n    \"The Avon to the Severn runs,\r\n      The Severn to the sea,\r\n    And Wickliffe's dust shall spread abroad,\r\n      Wide as the waters be.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, if the blood of Kossuth is taken by an absolute, unqualified,\r\nunjustifiable violation of national law, what will it appease, what will\r\nit pacify? It will mingle with the earth, it will mix with the waters of\r\nthe ocean, the whole civilized world will snuff it in the air, and it\r\nwill return with awful retribution on the heads of those violators of\r\nnational law and universal justice. I can not say when, or in what form;\r\nbut depend upon it, that, if such an act take place, then thrones, and\r\nprincipalities, and powers, must look out for the consequences.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Gentlemen, let us do our part; let us understand the position\r\nin which we stand, as the great republic of the world, at the most\r\ninteresting era of its history. Let us consider the mission and the\r\ndestiny which Providence seems to have designed for us, and let us so\r\ntake care of our own conduct, that, with irreproachable hearts, and with\r\nhands void of offence, we may stand up whenever and wherever called\r\nupon, and, with a voice not to be disregarded, say, This shall not be\r\ndone, at least not without our protest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONSTITUTION AND THE UNION.\r\n\r\nA SPEECH DELIVERED IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES, ON THE 7TH OF\r\nMARCH, 1850.\r\n\r\n\r\n[On the 25th of January, 1850, Mr. Clay submitted a series of\r\nresolutions to the Senate, on the subject of slavery, in connection with\r\nthe various questions which had arisen in consequence of the acquisition\r\nof Mexican territory. These resolutions furnished the occasion of a\r\nprotracted debate. On Wednesday, the 6th of March, Mr. Walker of\r\nWisconsin engaged in the discussion, but, owing to the length of time\r\ntaken up by repeated interruptions, he was unable to finish his\r\nargument. In the mean time it had been generally understood that Mr.\r\nWebster would, at an early day, take an opportunity of addressing the\r\nSenate on the present aspect of the slavery question, on the dangers to\r\nthe Union of the existing agitation, and on the terms of honorable\r\nadjustment. In the expectation of hearing a speech from him on these\r\nall-important topics, an immense audience assembled in the\r\nSenate-Chamber at an early hour of Thursday, the 7th of March. The\r\nfloor, the galleries, and the antechambers of the Senate were crowded,\r\nand it was with difficulty that the members themselves were able to\r\nforce their way to their seats.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock the special order of the day was announced, and the\r\nVice-President stated that Mr. Walker of Wisconsin was entitled to the\r\nfloor. That gentleman, however, rose and said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. President, this vast audience has not come together to hear\r\n     me, and there is but one man, in my opinion, who can assemble such\r\n     an audience. They expect to hear him, and I feel it to be my duty,\r\n     therefore, as it is my pleasure, to give the floor to the Senator\r\n     from Massachusetts. I understand it is immaterial to him upon which\r\n     of these questions he speaks, and therefore I will not move to\r\n     postpone the special order.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Webster then rose, and, after making his acknowledgments to the\r\nSenators from Wisconsin (Mr. Walker) and New York (Mr. Seward) for their\r\ncourtesy in yielding the floor to him, delivered the following speech,\r\nwhich, in consideration of its character and of the manner in which it\r\nwas received throughout the country, has been entitled a speech for \"the\r\nConstitution and the Union.\" In the pamphlet edition it was dedicated in\r\nthe following terms to the people of Massachusetts:--\r\n\r\nWITH THE HIGHEST RESPECT,\r\n\r\nAND THE DEEPEST SENSE OF OBLIGATION,\r\n\r\nI DEDICATE THIS SPEECH\r\n\r\nTO THE\r\n\r\nPEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n\"HIS EGO GRATIORA DICTU ALIA ESSE SCIO; SED ME VERA PRO GRATIS LOQUI,\r\nETSI MEUM INGENIUM NON MONERET, NECESSITAS COGIT. VELLEM, EQUIDEM, VOBIS\r\nPLACERE; SED MULTO MALO VOS SALVOS ESSE, QUALICUMQUE ERGA ME ANIMO\r\nFUTURI ESTIS.\"\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.]\r\n\r\nMr. President,--I wish to speak to-day, not as a Massachusetts man, nor\r\nas a Northern man, but as an American, and a member of the Senate of the\r\nUnited States. It is fortunate that there is a Senate of the United\r\nStates; a body not yet moved from its propriety, not lost to a just\r\nsense of its own dignity and its own high responsibilities, and a body\r\nto which the country looks, with confidence, for wise, moderate,\r\npatriotic, and healing counsels. It is not to be denied that we live in\r\nthe midst of strong agitations, and are surrounded by very considerable\r\ndangers to our institutions and government. The imprisoned winds are let\r\nloose. The East, the North, and the stormy South combine to throw the\r\nwhole sea into commotion, to toss its billows to the skies, and disclose\r\nits profoundest depths. I do not affect to regard myself, Mr. President,\r\nas holding, or as fit to hold, the helm in this combat with the\r\npolitical elements; but I have a duty to perform, and I mean to perform\r\nit with fidelity, not without a sense of existing dangers, but not\r\nwithout hope. I have a part to act, not for my own security or safety,\r\nfor I am looking out for no fragment upon which to float away from the\r\nwreck, if wreck there must be, but for the good of the whole, and the\r\npreservation of all; and there is that which will keep me to my duty\r\nduring this struggle, whether the sun and the stars shall appear, or\r\nshall not appear, for many days. I speak to-day for the preservation of\r\nthe Union. \"Hear me for my cause.\" I speak to-day, out of a solicitous\r\nand anxious heart, for the restoration to the country of that quiet and\r\nthat harmony which make the blessings of this Union so rich, and so dear\r\nto us all. These are the topics that I propose to myself to discuss;\r\nthese are the motives, and the sole motives, that influence me in the\r\nwish to communicate my opinions to the Senate and the country; and if I\r\ncan do any thing, however little, for the promotion of these ends, I\r\nshall have accomplished all that I expect.\r\n\r\nMr. President, it may not be amiss to recur very briefly to the events\r\nwhich, equally sudden and extraordinary, have brought the country into\r\nits present political condition. In May, 1846, the United States\r\ndeclared war against Mexico. Our armies, then on the frontiers, entered\r\nthe provinces of that republic, met and defeated all her troops,\r\npenetrated her mountain passes, and occupied her capital. The marine\r\nforce of the United States took possession of her forts and her towns,\r\non the Atlantic and on the Pacific. In less than two years a treaty was\r\nnegotiated, by which Mexico ceded to the United States a vast territory,\r\nextending seven or eight hundred miles along the shores of the Pacific,\r\nand reaching back over the mountains, and across the desert, until it\r\njoins the frontier of the State of Texas. It so happened, in the\r\ndistracted and feeble condition of the Mexican government, that, before\r\nthe declaration of war by the United States against Mexico had become\r\nknown in California, the people of California, under the lead of\r\nAmerican officers, overthrew the existing Mexican provincial government,\r\nand raised an independent flag. When the news arrived at San Francisco\r\nthat war had been declared by the United States against Mexico, this\r\nindependent flag was pulled down, and the stars and stripes of this\r\nUnion hoisted in its stead. So, Sir, before the war was over, the forces\r\nof the United States, military and naval, had possession of San\r\nFrancisco and Upper California, and a great rush of emigrants from\r\nvarious parts of the world took place into California in 1846 and 1847.\r\nBut now behold another wonder.\r\n\r\nIn January of 1848, a party of Mormons made a discovery of an\r\nextraordinarily rich mine of gold, or rather of a great quantity of\r\ngold, hardly proper to be called a mine, for it was spread near the\r\nsurface, on the lower part of the south, or American, branch of the\r\nSacramento. They attempted to conceal their discovery for some time; but\r\nsoon another discovery of gold, perhaps of greater importance, was made,\r\non another part of the American branch of the Sacramento, and near\r\nSutter's Fort, as it is called. The fame of these discoveries spread far\r\nand wide. They inflamed more and more the spirit of emigration towards\r\nCalifornia, which had already been excited; and adventurers crowded into\r\nthe country by hundreds, and flocked towards the Bay of San Francisco.\r\nThis, as I have said, took place in the winter and spring of 1848. The\r\ndigging commenced in the spring of that year, and from that time to this\r\nthe work of searching for gold has been prosecuted with a success not\r\nheretofore known in the history of this globe. You recollect, Sir, how\r\nincredulous at first the American public was at the accounts which\r\nreached us of these discoveries but we all know, now, that these\r\naccounts received, and continue to receive, daily confirmation, and down\r\nto the present moment I suppose the assurance is as strong, after the\r\nexperience of these several months, of the existence of deposits of gold\r\napparently inexhaustible in the regions near San Francisco, in\r\nCalifornia, as it was at any period of the earlier dates of the\r\naccounts.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, Sir, that although, after the return of peace, it became\r\na very important subject for legislative consideration and legislative\r\ndecision to provide a proper territorial government for California, yet\r\ndifferences of opinion between the two houses of Congress prevented the\r\nestablishment of any such territorial government at the last session.\r\nUnder this state of things, the inhabitants of California, already\r\namounting to a considerable number, thought it to be their duty, in the\r\nsummer of last year, to establish a local government. Under the\r\nproclamation of General Riley, the people chose delegates to a\r\nconvention, and that convention met at Monterey. It formed a\r\nconstitution for the State of California, which, being referred to the\r\npeople, was adopted by them in their primary assemblages. Desirous of\r\nimmediate connection with the United States, its Senators were appointed\r\nand Representatives chosen, who have come hither, bringing with them the\r\nauthentic constitution of the State of California; and they now present\r\nthemselves, asking, in behalf of their constituents, that it may be\r\nadmitted into this Union as one of the United States. This constitution,\r\nSir, contains an express prohibition of slavery, or involuntary\r\nservitude, in the State of California. It is said, and I suppose truly,\r\nthat, of the members who composed that convention, some sixteen were\r\nnatives of, and had been residents in, the slave-holding States, about\r\ntwenty-two were from the non-slaveholding States, and the remaining ten\r\nmembers were either native Californians or old settlers in that country.\r\nThis prohibition of slavery, it is said, was inserted with entire\r\nunanimity.\r\n\r\nIt is this circumstance, Sir, the prohibition of slavery, which has\r\ncontributed to raise, I do not say it has wholly raised, the dispute as\r\nto the propriety of the admission of California into the Union under\r\nthis constitution. It is not to be denied, Mr. President, nobody thinks\r\nof denying, that, whatever reasons were assigned at the commencement of\r\nthe late war with Mexico, it was prosecuted for the purpose of the\r\nacquisition of territory, and under the alleged argument that the\r\ncession of territory was the only form in which proper compensation\r\ncould be obtained by the United States, from Mexico, for the various\r\nclaims and demands which the people of this country had against that\r\ngovernment. At any rate, it will be found that President Polk's message,\r\nat the commencement of the session of December, 1847, avowed that the\r\nwar was to be prosecuted until some acquisition of territory should be\r\nmade. As the acquisition was to be south of the line of the United\r\nStates, in warm climates and countries, it was naturally, I suppose,\r\nexpected by the South, that whatever acquisitions were made in that\r\nregion would be added to the slave-holding portion of the United States.\r\nVery little of accurate information was possessed of the real physical\r\ncharacter, either of California or New Mexico, and events have not\r\nturned out as was expected. Both California and New Mexico are likely to\r\ncome in as free States; and therefore some degree of disappointment and\r\nsurprise has resulted. In other words, it is obvious that the question\r\nwhich has so long harassed the country, and at some times very seriously\r\nalarmed the minds of wise and good men, has come upon us for a fresh\r\ndiscussion,--the question of slavery in these United States.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, I propose, perhaps at the expense of some detail and\r\nconsequent detention of the Senate, to review historically this\r\nquestion, which, partly in consequence of its own importance, and\r\npartly, perhaps mostly, in consequence of the manner in which it has\r\nbeen discussed in different portions of the country, has been a source\r\nof so much alienation and unkind feeling between them.\r\n\r\nWe all know, Sir, that slavery has existed in the world from time\r\nimmemorial. There was slavery, in the earliest periods of history, among\r\nthe Oriental nations. There was slavery among the Jews; the theocratic\r\ngovernment of that people issued no injunction against it. There was\r\nslavery among the Greeks; and the ingenious philosophy of the Greeks\r\nfound, or sought to find, a justification for it exactly upon the\r\ngrounds which have been assumed for such a justification in this\r\ncountry; that is, a natural and original difference among the races of\r\nmankind, and the inferiority of the black or colored race to the white.\r\nThe Greeks justified their system of slavery upon that idea, precisely.\r\nThey held the African and some of the Asiatic tribes to be inferior to\r\nthe white race; but they did not show, I think, by any close process of\r\nlogic, that, if this were true, the more intelligent and the stronger\r\nhad therefore a right to subjugate the weaker.\r\n\r\nThe more manly philosophy and jurisprudence of the Romans placed the\r\njustification of slavery on entirely different grounds. The Roman\r\njurists, from the first and down to the fall of the empire, admitted\r\nthat slavery was against the natural law, by which, as they maintained,\r\nall men, of whatsoever clime, color, or capacity, were equal; but they\r\njustified slavery, first, upon the ground and authority of the law of\r\nnations, arguing, and arguing truly, that at that day the conventional\r\nlaw of nations admitted that captives in war, whose lives, according to\r\nthe notions of the times, were at the absolute disposal of the captors,\r\nmight, in exchange for exemption from death, be made slaves for life,\r\nand that such servitude might descend to their posterity. The jurists of\r\nRome also maintained, that, by the civil law, there might be servitude\r\nor slavery, personal and hereditary; first, by the voluntary act of an\r\nindividual, who might sell himself into slavery; secondly, by his being\r\nreduced into a state of slavery by his creditors, in satisfaction of his\r\ndebts; and, thirdly, by being placed in a state of servitude or slavery\r\nfor crime. At the introduction of Christianity, the Roman world was full\r\nof slaves, and I suppose there is to be found no injunction against that\r\nrelation between man and man in the teachings of the Gospel of Jesus\r\nChrist or of any of his Apostles. The object of the instruction imparted\r\nto mankind by the Founder of Christianity was to touch the heart, purify\r\nthe soul, and improve the lives of individual men. That object went\r\ndirectly to the first fountain of all the political and social relations\r\nof the human race, as well as of all true religious feeling, the\r\nindividual heart and mind of man.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, upon the general nature and influence of slavery there exists\r\na wide difference of opinion between the northern portion of this\r\ncountry and the southern. It is said on the one side, that, although not\r\nthe subject of any injunction or direct prohibition in the New\r\nTestament, slavery is a wrong; that it is founded merely in the right of\r\nthe strongest; and that it is an oppression, like unjust wars, like all\r\nthose conflicts by which a powerful nation subjects a weaker to its\r\nwill; and that, in its nature, whatever may be said of it in the\r\nmodifications which have taken place, it is not according to the meek\r\nspirit of the Gospel. It is not \"kindly affectioned\"; it does not \"seek\r\nanother's, and not its own\"; it does not \"let the oppressed go free.\"\r\nThese are sentiments that are cherished, and of late with greatly\r\naugmented force, among the people of the Northern States. They have\r\ntaken hold of the religious sentiment of that part of the country, as\r\nthey have, more or less, taken hold of the religious feelings of a\r\nconsiderable portion of mankind. The South, upon the other side, having\r\nbeen accustomed to this relation between the two races all their lives,\r\nfrom their birth, having been taught, in general, to treat the subjects\r\nof this bondage with care and kindness, and I believe, in general,\r\nfeeling great kindness for them, have not taken the view of the subject\r\nwhich I have mentioned. There are thousands of religious men, with\r\nconsciences as tender as any of their brethren at the North, who do not\r\nsee the unlawfulness of slavery; and there are more thousands, perhaps,\r\nthat, whatsoever they may think of it in its origin, and as a matter\r\ndepending upon natural right, yet take things as they are, and, finding\r\nslavery to be an established relation of the society in which they live,\r\ncan see no way in which, let their opinions on the abstract question be\r\nwhat they may, it is in the power of the present generation to relieve\r\nthemselves from this relation. And candor obliges me to say, that I\r\nbelieve they are just as conscientious, many of them, and the religious\r\npeople, all of them, as they are at the North who hold different\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nThe honorable Senator from South Carolina[1] the other day alluded to\r\nthe separation of that great religious community, the Methodist\r\nEpiscopal Church. That separation was brought about by differences of\r\nopinion upon this particular subject of slavery. I felt great concern,\r\nas that dispute went on, about the result. I was in hopes that the\r\ndifference of opinion might be adjusted, because I looked upon that\r\nreligious denomination as one of the great props of religion and morals\r\nthroughout the whole country, from Maine to Georgia, and westward to our\r\nutmost western boundary. The result was against my wishes and against my\r\nhopes. I have read all their proceedings and all their arguments; but I\r\nhave never yet been able to come to the conclusion that there was any\r\nreal ground for that separation; in other words, that any good could be\r\nproduced by that separation. I must say I think there was some want of\r\ncandor and charity. Sir, when a question of this kind seizes on the\r\nreligious sentiments of mankind, and comes to be discussed in religious\r\nassemblies of the clergy and laity, there is always to be expected, or\r\nalways to be feared, a great degree of excitement. It is in the nature\r\nof man, manifested by his whole history, that religious disputes are apt\r\nto become warm in proportion to the strength of the convictions which\r\nmen entertain of the magnitude of the questions at issue. In all such\r\ndisputes, there will sometimes be found men with whom every thing is\r\nabsolute; absolutely wrong, or absolutely right. They see the right\r\nclearly; they think others ought so to see it, and they are disposed to\r\nestablish a broad line, of distinction between what is right and what is\r\nwrong. They are not seldom willing to establish that line upon their own\r\nconvictions of truth and justice; and are ready to mark and guard it by\r\nplacing along it a series of dogmas, as lines of boundary on the earth's\r\nsurface are marked by posts and stones. There are men who, with clear\r\nperceptions, as they think, of their own duty, do not see how too eager\r\na pursuit of one duty may involve them in the violation of others, or\r\nhow too warm an embracement of one truth may lead to a disregard of\r\nother truths equally important. As I heard it stated strongly, not many\r\ndays ago, these persons are disposed to mount upon some particular duty,\r\nas upon a war-horse, and to drive furiously on and upon and over all\r\nother duties that may stand in the way. There are men who, in reference\r\nto disputes of that sort, are of opinion that human duties may be\r\nascertained with the exactness of mathematics. They deal with morals as\r\nwith mathematics; and they think what is right may be distinguished from\r\nwhat is wrong with the precision of an algebraic equation. They have,\r\ntherefore, none too much charity towards others who differ from them.\r\nThey are apt, too, to think that nothing is good but what is perfect,\r\nand that there are no compromises or modifications to be made in\r\nconsideration of difference of opinion or in deference to other men's\r\njudgment. If their perspicacious vision enables them to detect a spot on\r\nthe face of the sun, they think that a good reason why the sun should be\r\nstruck down from heaven. They prefer the chance of running into utter\r\ndarkness to living in heavenly light, if that heavenly light be not\r\nabsolutely without any imperfection. There are impatient men; too\r\nimpatient always to give heed to the admonition of St. Paul, that we are\r\nnot to \"do evil that good may come\"; too impatient to wait for the slow\r\nprogress of moral causes in the improvement of mankind. They do not\r\nremember that the doctrines and the miracles of Jesus Christ have, in\r\neighteen hundred years, converted only a small portion of the human\r\nrace; and among the nations that are converted to Christianity, they\r\nforget how many vices and crimes, public and private, still prevail, and\r\nthat many of them, public crimes especially, which are so clearly\r\noffences against the Christian religion, pass without exciting\r\nparticular indignation. Thus wars are waged, and unjust wars. I do not\r\ndeny that there may be just wars. There certainly are; but it was the\r\nremark of an eminent person, not many years ago, on the other side of\r\nthe Atlantic, that it is one of the greatest reproaches to human nature\r\nthat wars are sometimes just. The defence of nations sometimes causes a\r\njust war against the injustice of other nations. In this state of\r\nsentiment upon the general nature of slavery lies the cause of a great\r\npart of those unhappy divisions, exasperations, and reproaches which\r\nfind vent and support in different parts of the Union.\r\n\r\nBut we must view things as they are. Slavery does exist in the United\r\nStates. It did exist in the States before the adoption of this\r\nConstitution, and at that time. Let us, therefore, consider for a moment\r\nwhat was the state of sentiment, North and South, in regard to slavery,\r\nat the time this Constitution was adopted. A remarkable change has taken\r\nplace since; but what did the wise and great men of all parts of the\r\ncountry think of slavery then? In what estimation did they hold it at\r\nthe time when this Constitution was adopted? It will be found, Sir, if\r\nwe will carry ourselves by historical research back to that day, and\r\nascertain men's opinions by authentic records still existing among us,\r\nthat there was then no diversity of opinion between the North and the\r\nSouth upon the subject of slavery. It will be found that both parts of\r\nthe country held it equally an evil,--a moral and political evil. It\r\nwill not be found that, either at the North or at the South, there was\r\nmuch, though there was some, invective against slavery as inhuman and\r\ncruel. The great ground of objection to it was political; that it\r\nweakened the social fabric; that, taking the place of free labor,\r\nsociety became less strong and labor less productive; and therefore we\r\nfind from all the eminent men of the time the clearest expression of\r\ntheir opinion that slavery is an evil. They ascribed its existence here,\r\nnot without truth, and not without some acerbity of temper and force of\r\nlanguage, to the injurious policy of the mother country, who, to favor\r\nthe navigator, had entailed these evils upon the Colonies. I need hardly\r\nrefer, Sir, particularly to the publications of the day. They are\r\nmatters of history on the record. The eminent men, the most eminent men,\r\nand nearly all the conspicuous politicians of the South, held the same\r\nsentiments,--that slavery was an evil, a blight, a scourge, and a curse.\r\nThere are no terms of reprobation of slavery so vehement in the North at\r\nthat day as in the South. The North was not so much excited against it\r\nas the South; and the reason is, I suppose, that there was much less of\r\nit at the North, and the people did not see, or think they saw, the\r\nevils so prominently as they were seen, or thought to be seen, at the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nThen, Sir, when this Constitution was framed, this was the light in\r\nwhich the Federal Convention viewed it. That body reflected the judgment\r\nand sentiments of the great men of the South. A member of the other\r\nhouse, whom I have not the honor to know, has, in a recent speech,\r\ncollected extracts from these public documents. They prove the truth of\r\nwhat I am saying, and the question then was, how to deal with it, and\r\nhow to deal with it as an evil. They came to this general result. They\r\nthought that slavery could not be continued in the country if the\r\nimportation of slaves were made to cease, and therefore they provided\r\nthat, after a certain period, the importation might be prevented by the\r\nact of the new government. The period of twenty years was proposed by\r\nsome gentleman from the North, I think, and many members of the\r\nConvention from the South opposed it as being too long. Mr. Madison\r\nespecially was somewhat warm against it. He said it would bring too much\r\nof this mischief into the country to allow the importation of slaves for\r\nsuch a period. Because we must take along with us, in the whole of this\r\ndiscussion, when we are considering the sentiments and opinions in which\r\nthe constitutional provision originated, that the conviction of all men\r\nwas, that, if the importation of slaves ceased, the white race would\r\nmultiply faster than the black race, and that slavery would therefore\r\ngradually wear out and expire. It may not be improper here to allude to\r\nthat, I had almost said, celebrated opinion of Mr. Madison. You observe,\r\nSir, that the term _slave_, or _slavery_, is not used in the\r\nConstitution. The Constitution does not require that \"fugitive slaves\"\r\nshall be delivered up. It requires that persons held to service in one\r\nState, and escaping into another, shall be delivered up. Mr. Madison\r\nopposed the introduction of the term _slave_, or _slavery_, into the\r\nConstitution; for he said that he did not wish to see it recognized by\r\nthe Constitution of the United States of America that there could be\r\nproperty in men.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, all this took place in the Convention in 1787; but connected\r\nwith this, concurrent and contemporaneous, is another important\r\ntransaction, not sufficiently attended to. The Convention for framing\r\nthis Constitution assembled in Philadelphia in May, and sat until\r\nSeptember, 1787. During all that time the Congress of the United States\r\nwas in session at New York. It was a matter of design, as we know, that\r\nthe Convention should not assemble in the same city where Congress was\r\nholding its sessions. Almost all the public men of the country,\r\ntherefore, of distinction and eminence, were in one or the other of\r\nthese two assemblies; and I think it happened, in some instances, that\r\nthe same gentlemen were members of both bodies. If I mistake not, such\r\nwas the case with Mr. Rufus King, then a member of Congress from\r\nMassachusetts. Now, at the very time when the Convention in Philadelphia\r\nwas framing this Constitution, the Congress in New York was framing the\r\nOrdinance of 1787, for the organization and government of the territory\r\nnorthwest of the Ohio. They passed that Ordinance on the 13th of July,\r\n1787, at New York, the very month, perhaps the very day, on which these\r\nquestions about the importation of slaves and the character of slavery\r\nwere debated in the Convention at Philadelphia. So far as we can now\r\nlearn, there was a perfect concurrence of opinion between these two\r\nbodies; and it resulted in this Ordinance of 1787, excluding slavery\r\nfrom all the territory over which the Congress of the United States had\r\njurisdiction, and that was all the territory northwest of the Ohio.\r\nThree years before, Virginia and other States had made a cession of that\r\ngreat territory to the United States; and a most munificent act it was.\r\nI never reflect upon it without a disposition to do honor and justice,\r\nand justice would be the highest honor, to Virginia, for the cession of\r\nher northwestern territory. I will say, Sir, it is one of her fairest\r\nclaims to the respect and gratitude of the country, and that, perhaps,\r\nit is only second to that other claim which belongs to her,--that from\r\nher counsels, and from the intelligence and patriotism of her leading\r\nstatesmen, proceeded the first idea put into practice of the formation\r\nof a general constitution of the United States. The Ordinance of 1787\r\napplied to the whole territory over which the Congress of the United\r\nStates had jurisdiction. It was adopted two years before the\r\nConstitution of the United States went into operation; because the\r\nOrdinance took effect immediately on its passage, while the Constitution\r\nof the United States, having been framed, was to be sent to the States\r\nto be adopted by their conventions; and then a government was to be\r\norganized under it. This Ordinance, then, was in operation and force\r\nwhen the Constitution was adopted, and the government put in motion, in\r\nApril, 1789.\r\n\r\nMr. President, three things are quite clear as historical truths. One\r\nis, that there was an expectation that, on the ceasing of the\r\nimportation of slaves from Africa, slavery would begin to run out here.\r\nThat was hoped and expected. Another is, that, as far as there was any\r\npower in Congress to prevent the spread of slavery in the United States,\r\nthat power was executed in the most absolute manner, and to the fullest\r\nextent. An honorable member,[2] whose health does not allow him to be\r\nhere to-day--\r\n\r\n     A SENATOR. He is here.\r\n\r\nI am very happy to hear that he is; may he long be here, and in the\r\nenjoyment of health to serve his country! The honorable member said, the\r\nother day, that he considered this Ordinance as the first in the series\r\nof measures calculated to enfeeble the South, and deprive them of their\r\njust participation in the benefits and privileges of this government. He\r\nsays, very properly, that it was enacted under the old Confederation,\r\nand before this Constitution went into effect; but my present purpose is\r\nonly to say, Mr. President, that it was established with the entire and\r\nunanimous concurrence of the whole South. Why, there it stands! The vote\r\nof every State in the Union was unanimous in favor of the Ordinance,\r\nwith the exception of a single individual vote, and that individual vote\r\nwas given by a Northern man. This Ordinance prohibiting slavery for ever\r\nnorthwest of the Ohio has the hand and seal of every Southern member in\r\nCongress. It was therefore no aggression of the North on the South. The\r\nother and third clear historical truth is, that the Convention meant to\r\nleave slavery in the States as they found it, entirely under the\r\nauthority and control of the States themselves.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of things, Sir, and this the state of opinion, under\r\nwhich those very important matters were arranged, and those three\r\nimportant things done; that is, the establishment of the Constitution of\r\nthe United States with a recognition of slavery as it existed in the\r\nStates; the establishment of the ordinance for the government of the\r\nNorthwestern Territory, prohibiting, to the full extent of all territory\r\nowned by the United States, the introduction of slavery into that\r\nterritory, while leaving to the States all power over slavery in their\r\nown limits; and creating a power, in the new government, to put an end\r\nto the importation of slaves, after a limited period. There was entire\r\ncoincidence and concurrence of sentiment between the North and the\r\nSouth, upon all these questions, at the period of the adoption of the\r\nConstitution. But opinions, Sir, have changed, greatly changed; changed\r\nNorth and changed South. Slavery is not regarded in the South now as it\r\nwas then. I see an honorable member of this body paying me the honor of\r\nlistening to my remarks;[3] he brings to my mind, Sir, freshly and\r\nvividly, what I have learned of his great ancestor, so much\r\ndistinguished in his day and generation, so worthy to be succeeded by so\r\nworthy a grandson, and of the sentiments he expressed in the Convention\r\nin Philadelphia.[4]\r\n\r\nHere we may pause. There was, if not an entire unanimity, a general\r\nconcurrence of sentiment running through the whole community, and\r\nespecially entertained by the eminent men of all parts of the country.\r\nBut soon a change began, at the North and the South, and a difference of\r\nopinion showed itself; the North growing much more warm and strong\r\nagainst slavery, and the South growing much more warm and strong in its\r\nsupport. Sir, there is no generation of mankind whose opinions are not\r\nsubject to be influenced by what appear to them to be their present\r\nemergent and exigent interests. I impute to the South no particularly\r\nselfish view in the change which has come over her. I impute to her\r\ncertainly no dishonest view. All that has happened has been natural. It\r\nhas followed those causes which always influence the human mind and\r\noperate upon it. What, then, have been the causes which have created so\r\nnew a feeling in favor of slavery in the South, which have changed the\r\nwhole nomenclature of the South on that subject, so that, from being\r\nthought and described in the terms I have mentioned and will not repeat,\r\nit has now become an institution, a cherished institution, in that\r\nquarter; no evil, no scourge, but a great religious, social, and moral\r\nblessing, as I think I have heard it latterly spoken of? I suppose this,\r\nSir, is owing to the rapid growth and sudden extension of the COTTON\r\nplantations of the South. So far as any motive consistent with honor,\r\njustice, and general judgment could act, it was the COTTON interest that\r\ngave a new desire to promote slavery, to spread it, and to use its\r\nlabor. I again say that this change was produced by causes which must\r\nalways produce like effects. The whole interest of the South became\r\nconnected, more or less, with the extension of slavery. If we look back\r\nto the history of the commerce of this country in the early years of\r\nthis government, what were our exports? Cotton was hardly, or but to a\r\nvery limited extent, known. In 1791 the first parcel of cotton of the\r\ngrowth of the United States was exported, and amounted only to 19,200\r\npounds.[5] It has gone on increasing rapidly, until the whole crop may\r\nnow, perhaps, in a season of great product and high prices, amount to a\r\nhundred millions of dollars. In the years I have mentioned, there was\r\nmore of wax, more of indigo, more of rice, more of almost every article\r\nof export from the South, than of cotton. When Mr. Jay negotiated the\r\ntreaty of 1794 with England, it is evident from the twelfth article of\r\nthe treaty, which was suspended by the Senate, that he did not know that\r\ncotton was exported at all from the United States.\r\n\r\nWell, Sir, we know what followed. The age of cotton became the golden\r\nage of our Southern brethren. It gratified their desire for improvement\r\nand accumulation, at the same time that it excited it. The desire grew\r\nby what it fed upon, and there soon came to be an eagerness for other\r\nterritory, a new area or new areas for the cultivation of the cotton\r\ncrop; and measures leading to this result were brought about rapidly,\r\none after another, under the lead of Southern men at the head of the\r\ngovernment, they having a majority in both branches of Congress to\r\naccomplish their ends. The honorable member from South Carolina[6]\r\nobserved that there has been a majority all along in favor of the North.\r\nIf that be true, Sir, the North has acted either very liberally and\r\nkindly, or very weakly; for they never exercised that majority\r\nefficiently five times in the history of the government, when a division\r\nor trial of strength arose. Never. Whether they were outgeneralled, or\r\nwhether it was owing to other causes, I shall not stop to consider; but\r\nno man acquainted with the history of the Union can deny that the\r\ngeneral lead in the politics of the country, for three fourths of the\r\nperiod that has elapsed since the adoption of the Constitution, has been\r\na Southern lead.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, in pursuit of the idea of opening a new cotton region, the\r\nUnited States obtained a cession from Georgia of the whole of her\r\nwestern territory, now embracing the rich and growing States of Alabama\r\nand Mississippi. In 1803 Louisiana was purchased from France, out of\r\nwhich the States of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri have been framed,\r\nas slave-holding States. In 1819 the cession of Florida was made,\r\nbringing in another region adapted to cultivation by slaves. Sir, the\r\nhonorable member from South Carolina thought he saw in certain\r\noperations of the government, such as the manner of collecting the\r\nrevenue, and the tendency of measures calculated to promote emigration\r\ninto the country, what accounts for the more rapid growth of the North\r\nthan the South. He ascribes that more rapid growth, not to the operation\r\nof time, but to the system of government and administration established\r\nunder this Constitution. That is matter of opinion. To a certain extent\r\nit may be true; but it does seem to me that, if any operation of the\r\ngovernment can be shown in any degree to have promoted the population,\r\nand growth, and wealth of the North, it is much more sure that there are\r\nsundry important and distinct operations of the government, about which\r\nno man can doubt, tending to promote, and which absolutely have\r\npromoted, the increase of the slave interest and the slave territory of\r\nthe South. It was not time that brought in Louisiana; it was the act of\r\nmen. It was not time that brought in Florida; it was the act of men. And\r\nlastly, Sir, to complete those acts of legislation which have\r\ncontributed so much to enlarge the area of the institution of slavery,\r\nTexas, great and vast and illimitable Texas, was added to the Union as a\r\nslave State in 1845; and that, Sir, pretty much closed the whole\r\nchapter, and settled the whole account.\r\n\r\nThat closed the whole chapter and settled the whole account, because the\r\nannexation of Texas, upon the conditions and under the guaranties upon\r\nwhich she was admitted, did not leave within the control of this\r\ngovernment an acre of land, capable of being cultivated by slave labor,\r\nbetween this Capitol and the Rio Grande or the Nueces, or whatever is\r\nthe proper boundary of Texas; not an acre. From that moment, the whole\r\ncountry, from this place to the western boundary of Texas, was fixed,\r\npledged, fastened, decided, to be slave territory for ever, by the\r\nsolemn guaranties of law. And I now say, Sir, as the proposition upon\r\nwhich I stand this day, and upon the truth and firmness of which I\r\nintend to act until it is overthrown, that there is not at this moment\r\nwithin the United States, or any territory of the United States, a\r\nsingle foot of land, the character of which, in regard to its being free\r\nterritory or slave territory, is not fixed by some law, and some\r\nirrepealable law, beyond the power of the action of the government. Is\r\nit not so with respect to Texas? It is most manifestly so. The honorable\r\nmember from South Carolina, at the time of the admission of Texas, held\r\nan important post in the executive department of the government; he was\r\nSecretary of State. Another eminent person of great activity and\r\nadroitness in affairs, I mean the late Secretary of the Treasury,[7] was\r\na conspicuous member of this body, and took the lead in the business of\r\nannexation, in co-operation with the Secretary of State; and I must say\r\nthat they did their business faithfully and thoroughly; there was no\r\nbotch left in it. They rounded it off, and made as close joiner-work as\r\never was exhibited. Resolutions of annexation were brought into\r\nCongress, fitly joined together, compact, efficient, conclusive upon the\r\ngreat object which they had in view, and those resolutions passed.\r\n\r\nAllow me to read a part of these resolutions. It is the third clause of\r\nthe second section of the resolution of the 1st of March, 1845, for the\r\nadmission of Texas, which applies to this part of the case. That clause\r\nis as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"New States, of convenient size, not exceeding four in number, in\r\n     addition to said State of Texas, and having sufficient population,\r\n     may hereafter, by the consent of said State, he formed out of the\r\n     territory thereof, which shall be entitled to admission under the\r\n     provisions of the Federal Constitution. And such States as may be\r\n     formed out of that portion of said territory lying south of\r\n     thirty-six degrees thirty minutes north latitude, commonly known as\r\n     the Missouri Compromise line, shall be admitted into the Union with\r\n     or without slavery, as the people of each State asking admission\r\n     may desire; and in such State or States as shall be formed out of\r\n     said territory north of said Missouri Compromise line, slavery or\r\n     involuntary servitude (except for crime) shall be prohibited.\"\r\n\r\nNow what is here stipulated, enacted, and secured? It is, that all Texas\r\nsouth of 36° 30', which is nearly the whole of it, shall be admitted\r\ninto the Union as a slave State. It was a slave State, and therefore\r\ncame in as a slave State; and the guaranty is, that new States shall be\r\nmade out of it, to the number of four, in addition to the State then in\r\nexistence and admitted at that time by these resolutions, and that such\r\nStates as are formed out of that portion of Texas lying south of 36° 30'\r\nmay come in as slave States. I know no form of legislation which can\r\nstrengthen this. I know no mode of recognition that can add a tittle of\r\nweight to it. I listened respectfully to the resolutions of my honorable\r\nfriend from Tennessee.[8] He proposed to recognize that stipulation with\r\nTexas. But any additional recognition would weaken the force of it;\r\nbecause it stands here on the ground of a contract, a thing done for a\r\nconsideration. It is a law founded on a contract with Texas, and\r\ndesigned to carry that contract into effect. A recognition now, founded\r\nnot on any consideration, or any contract, would not be so strong as it\r\nnow stands on the face of the resolution. I know no way, I candidly\r\nconfess, in which this government, acting in good faith, as I trust it\r\nalways will, can relieve itself from that stipulation and pledge, by any\r\nhonest course of legislation whatever. And therefore I say again, that,\r\nso far as Texas is concerned, in the whole of that State south of 36°\r\n30', which, I suppose, embraces all the territory capable of slave\r\ncultivation, there is no land, not an acre, the character of which is\r\nnot established by law; a law which cannot be repealed without the\r\nviolation of a contract, and plain disregard of the public faith.\r\n\r\nI hope, Sir, it is now apparent that my proposition, so far as it\r\nrespects Texas, has been maintained, and that the provision in this\r\narticle is clear and absolute; and it has been well suggested by my\r\nfriend from Rhode Island,[9] that that part of Texas which lies north of\r\n36° 30' of north latitude, and which may be formed into free States, is\r\ndependent, in like manner, upon the consent of Texas, herself a slave\r\nState.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, how came this? How came it to pass that within these walls,\r\nwhere it is said by the honorable member from South Carolina that the\r\nfree States have always had a majority, this resolution of annexation,\r\nsuch as I have described it, obtained a majority in both houses of\r\nCongress? Sir, it obtained that majority by the great number of Northern\r\nvotes added to the entire Southern vote, or at least nearly the whole of\r\nthe Southern vote. The aggregate was made up of Northern and Southern\r\nvotes. In the House of Representatives there were about eighty Southern\r\nvotes and about fifty Northern votes for the admission of Texas. In the\r\nSenate the vote for the admission of Texas was twenty-seven, and\r\ntwenty-five against it; and of those twenty-seven votes, constituting\r\nthe majority, no less than thirteen came from the free States, and four\r\nof them were from New England. The whole of these thirteen Senators,\r\nconstituting within a fraction, you see, one half of all the votes in\r\nthis body for the admission of this immeasurable extent of slave\r\nterritory, were sent here by free States.\r\n\r\nSir, there is not so remarkable a chapter in our history of political\r\nevents, political parties, and political men as is afforded by this\r\nadmission of a new slave-holding territory, so vast that a bird cannot\r\nfly over it in a week. New England, as I have said, with some of her own\r\nvotes, supported this measure. Three fourths of the votes of\r\nliberty-loving Connecticut were given for it in the other house, and one\r\nhalf here. There was one vote for it from Maine, but, I am happy to say,\r\nnot the vote of the honorable member who addressed the Senate the day\r\nbefore yesterday,[10] and who was then a Representative from Maine in\r\nthe House of Representatives; but there was one vote from Maine, ay, and\r\nthere was one vote for it from Massachusetts, given by a gentleman then\r\nrepresenting, and now living in, the district in which the prevalence of\r\nFree Soil sentiment for a couple of years or so has defeated the choice\r\nof any member to represent it in Congress. Sir, that body of Northern\r\nand Eastern men who gave those votes at that time are now seen taking\r\nupon themselves, in the nomenclature of politics, the appellation of the\r\nNorthern Democracy. They undertook to wield the destinies of this\r\nempire, if I may give that name to a republic, and their policy was, and\r\nthey persisted in it, to bring into this country and under this\r\ngovernment all the territory they could. They did it, in the case of\r\nTexas, under pledges, absolute pledges, to the slave interest, and they\r\nafterwards lent their aid in bringing in these new conquests, to take\r\ntheir chance for slavery or freedom. My honorable friend from\r\nGeorgia,[11] in March, 1847, moved the Senate to declare that the war\r\nought not to be prosecuted for the conquest of Territory, or for the\r\ndismemberment of Mexico. The whole of the Northern Democracy voted\r\nagainst it. He did not get a vote from them. It suited the patriotic and\r\nelevated sentiments of the Northern Democracy to bring in a world from\r\namong the mountains and valleys of California and New Mexico, or any\r\nother part of Mexico, and then quarrel about it; to bring it in, and\r\nthen endeavor to put upon it the saving grace of the Wilmot Proviso.\r\nThere were two eminent and highly respectable gentlemen from the North\r\nand East, then leading gentlemen in the Senate, (I refer, and I do so\r\nwith entire respect, for I entertain for both of those gentlemen, in\r\ngeneral, high regard, to Mr. Dix of New York and Mr. Niles of\r\nConnecticut,) who both voted for the admission of Texas. They would not\r\nhave that vote any other way than as it stood; and they would have it as\r\nit did stand. I speak of the vote upon the annexation of Texas. Those\r\ntwo gentlemen would have the resolution of annexation just as it is,\r\nwithout amendment; and they voted for it just as it is, and their eyes\r\nwere all open to its true character. The honorable member from South\r\nCarolina who addressed us the other day was then Secretary of State. His\r\ncorrespondence with Mr. Murphy, the Chargé d'Affaires of the United\r\nStates in Texas, had been published. That correspondence was all before\r\nthose gentlemen, and the Secretary had the boldness and candor to avow\r\nin that correspondence, that the great object sought by the annexation\r\nof Texas was to strengthen the slave interest of the South. Why, Sir,\r\nhe said so in so many words--\r\n\r\n     MR. CALHOUN. Will the honorable Senator permit me to interrupt him\r\n     for a moment?\r\n\r\nCertainly.\r\n\r\n     MR. CALHOUN. I am very reluctant to interrupt the honorable\r\n     gentleman; but, upon a point of so much importance, I deem it right\r\n     to put myself _rectus in curia_. I did not put it upon the ground\r\n     assumed by the Senator. I put it upon this ground: that Great\r\n     Britain had announced to this country, in so many words, that her\r\n     object was to abolish slavery in Texas, and, through Texas, to\r\n     accomplish the abolition of slavery in the United States and the\r\n     world. The ground I put it on was, that it would make an exposed\r\n     frontier, and, if Great Britain succeeded in her object, it would\r\n     be impossible that that frontier could be secured against the\r\n     aggressions of the Abolitionists; and that this government was\r\n     bound, under the guaranties of the Constitution, to protect us\r\n     against such a state of things.\r\n\r\nThat comes, I suppose, Sir, to exactly the same thing. It was, that\r\nTexas must be obtained for the security of the slave interest of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\n     MR. CALHOUN. Another view is very distinctly given.\r\n\r\nThat was the object set forth in the correspondence of a worthy\r\ngentleman not now living,[12] who preceded the honorable member from\r\nSouth Carolina in the Department of State. There repose on the files of\r\nthe Department, as I have occasion to know, strong letters from Mr.\r\nUpshur to the United States Minister in England, and I believe there are\r\nsome to the same Minister from the honorable Senator himself, asserting\r\nto this effect the sentiments of this government; namely, that Great\r\nBritain was expected not to interfere to take Texas out of the hands of\r\nits then existing government and make it a free country. But my\r\nargument, my suggestion, is this: that those gentlemen who composed the\r\nNorthern Democracy when Texas was brought into the Union saw clearly\r\nthat it was brought in as a slave country, and brought in for the\r\npurpose of being maintained as slave territory, to the Greek Kalends. I\r\nrather think the honorable gentleman who was then Secretary of State\r\nmight, in some of his correspondence with Mr. Murphy, have suggested\r\nthat it was not expedient to say too much about this object, lest it\r\nshould create some alarm. At any rate, Mr. Murphy wrote to him that\r\nEngland was anxious to get rid of the constitution of Texas, because it\r\nwas a constitution establishing slavery; and that what the United States\r\nhad to do was to aid the people of Texas in upholding their\r\nconstitution; but that nothing should be said which should offend the\r\nfanatical men of the North. But, Sir, the honorable member did avow this\r\nobject himself, openly, boldly, and manfully; he did not disguise his\r\nconduct or his motives.\r\n\r\n     MR. CALHOUN. Never, never.\r\n\r\nWhat he means he is very apt to say.\r\n\r\n     MR. CALHOUN. Always, always.\r\n\r\nAnd I honor him for it.\r\n\r\nThis admission of Texas was in 1845. Then in 1847, _flagrante bello_\r\nbetween the United States and Mexico, the proposition I have mentioned\r\nwas brought forward by my friend from Georgia, and the Northern\r\nDemocracy voted steadily against it. Their remedy was to apply to the\r\nacquisitions, after they should come in, the Wilmot Proviso. What\r\nfollows? These two gentlemen,[13] worthy and honorable and influential\r\nmen, (and if they had not been they could not have carried the measure,)\r\nthese two gentlemen, members of this body, brought in Texas, and by\r\ntheir votes they also prevented the passage of the resolution of the\r\nhonorable member from Georgia, and then they went home and took the\r\nlead in the Free Soil party. And there they stand, Sir! They leave us\r\nhere, bound in honor and conscience by the resolutions of annexation;\r\nthey leave us here, to take the odium of fulfilling the obligations in\r\nfavor of slavery which they voted us into, or else the greater odium of\r\nviolating those obligations, while they are at home making capital and\r\nrousing speeches for free soil and no slavery. And therefore I say, Sir,\r\nthat there is not a chapter in our history, respecting public measures\r\nand public men, more full of what would create surprise, more full of\r\nwhat does create in my mind, extreme mortification, than that of the\r\nconduct of the Northern Democracy on this subject.\r\n\r\nMr. President, sometimes, when a man is found in a new relation to\r\nthings around him and to other men, he says the world has changed, and\r\nthat he has not changed. I believe, Sir, that our self-respect leads us\r\noften to make this declaration in regard to ourselves when it is not\r\nexactly true. An individual is more apt to change, perhaps, than all the\r\nworld around him. But under the present circumstances, and under the\r\nresponsibility which I know I incur by what I am now stating here, I\r\nfeel at liberty to recur to the various expressions and statements, made\r\nat various times, of my own opinions and resolutions respecting the\r\nadmission of Texas, and all that has followed. Sir, as early as 1836, or\r\nin the early part of 1837, there was conversation and correspondence\r\nbetween myself and some private friends on this project of annexing\r\nTexas to the United States; and an honorable gentleman with whom I have\r\nhad a long acquaintance, a friend of mine, now perhaps in this chamber,\r\nI mean General Hamilton, of South Carolina, was privy to that\r\ncorrespondence. I had voted for the recognition of Texan independence,\r\nbecause I believed it to be an existing fact, surprising and astonishing\r\nas it was, and I wished well to the new republic; but I manifested from\r\nthe first utter opposition to bringing her, with her slave territory,\r\ninto the Union. I happened, in 1837, to make a public address to\r\npolitical friends in New York, and I then stated my sentiments upon the\r\nsubject. It was the first time that I had occasion to advert to it; and\r\nI will ask a friend near me to have the kindness to read an extract from\r\nthe speech made by me on that occasion. It was delivered in Niblo's\r\nSaloon, in 1837.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Greene then read the following extract from the speech of Mr.\r\n     Webster to which he referred:--\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen, we all see that, by whomsoever possessed, Texas is\r\n     likely to be a slave-holding country; and I frankly avow my entire\r\n     unwillingness to do any thing that shall extend the slavery of the\r\n     African race on this continent, or add other slave-holding States\r\n     to the Union. When I say that I regard slavery in itself as a great\r\n     moral, social, and political evil, I only use language which has\r\n     been adopted by distinguished men, themselves citizens of\r\n     slave-holding States. I shall do nothing, therefore, to favor or\r\n     encourage its further extension. We have slavery already amongst\r\n     us. The Constitution found it in the Union; it recognized it, and\r\n     gave it solemn guaranties. To the full extent of these guaranties\r\n     we are all bound, in honor, in justice, and by the Constitution.\r\n     All the stipulations contained in the Constitution in favor of the\r\n     slave-holding States which are already in the Union ought to be\r\n     fulfilled, and, so far as depends on me, shall be fulfilled, in the\r\n     fulness of their spirit, and to the exactness of their letter.\r\n     Slavery, as it exists in the States, is beyond the reach of\r\n     Congress. It is a concern of the States themselves; they have never\r\n     submitted it to Congress, and Congress has no rightful power over\r\n     it. I shall concur, therefore, in no act, no measure, no menace, no\r\n     indication of purpose, which shall interfere or threaten to\r\n     interfere with the exclusive authority of the several States over\r\n     the subject of slavery as it exists within their respective limits.\r\n     All this appears to me to be matter of plain and imperative duty.\r\n\r\n     \"But when we come to speak of admitting new States, the subject\r\n     assumes an entirely different aspect. Our rights and our duties are\r\n     then both different....\r\n\r\n     \"I see, therefore, no political necessity for the annexation of\r\n     Texas to the Union; no advantages to be derived from it; and\r\n     objections to it of a strong, and, in my judgment, decisive\r\n     character.\"\r\n\r\nI have nothing, Sir, to add to, or to take from, those sentiments. That\r\nspeech, the Senate will perceive, was made in 1837. The purpose of\r\nimmediately annexing Texas at that time was abandoned or postponed; and\r\nit was not revived with any vigor for some years. In the mean time it\r\nhappened that I had become a member of the executive administration, and\r\nwas for a short period in the Department of State. The annexation of\r\nTexas was a subject of conversation, not confidential, with the\r\nPresident and heads of departments, as well as with other public men. No\r\nserious attempt was then made, however, to bring it about. I left the\r\nDepartment of State in May, 1843, and shortly after I learned, though by\r\nmeans which were no way connected with official information, that a\r\ndesign had been taken up of bringing Texas, with her slave territory and\r\npopulation, into this Union. I was in Washington at the time, and\r\npersons are now here who will remember that we had an arranged meeting\r\nfor conversation upon it. I went home to Massachusetts and proclaimed\r\nthe existence of that purpose, but I could get no audience and but\r\nlittle attention. Some did not believe it, and some were too much\r\nengaged in their own pursuits to give it any heed. They had gone to\r\ntheir farms or to their merchandise, and it was impossible to arouse any\r\nfeeling in New England, or in Massachusetts, that should combine the two\r\ngreat political parties against this annexation; and, indeed, there was\r\nno hope of bringing the Northern Democracy into that view, for their\r\nleaning was all the other way. But, Sir, even with Whigs, and leading\r\nWhigs, I am ashamed to say, there was a great indifference towards the\r\nadmission of Texas, with slave territory, into this Union.\r\n\r\nThe project went on. I was then out of Congress. The annexation\r\nresolutions passed on the 1st of March, 1845; the legislature of Texas\r\ncomplied with the conditions and accepted the guaranties; for the\r\nlanguage of the resolution is, that Texas is to come in \"upon the\r\nconditions and under the guaranties herein prescribed.\" I was returned\r\nto the Senate in March, 1845, and was here in December following, when\r\nthe acceptance by Texas of the conditions proposed by Congress was\r\ncommunicated to us by the President, and an act for the consummation of\r\nthe union was laid before the two houses. The connection was then not\r\ncompleted. A final law, doing the deed of annexation ultimately, had not\r\nbeen passed; and when it was put upon its final passage here, I\r\nexpressed my opposition to it, and recorded my vote in the negative; and\r\nthere that vote stands, with the observations that I made upon that\r\noccasion.[14] Nor is this the only occasion on which I have expressed\r\nmyself to the same effect. It has happened that, between 1837 and this\r\ntime, on various occasions, I have expressed my entire opposition to the\r\nadmission of slave States, or the acquisition of new slave territories,\r\nto be added to the United States. I know, Sir, no change in my own\r\nsentiments, or my own purposes, in that respect. I will now ask my\r\nfriend from Rhode Island to read another extract from a speech of mine\r\nmade at a Whig Convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the month of\r\nSeptember, 1847.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Greene here read the following extract:--\r\n\r\n     \"We hear much just now of a _panacea_ for the dangers and evils of\r\n     slavery and slave annexation, which they call the 'Wilmot Proviso.'\r\n     That certainly is a just sentiment, but it is not a sentiment to\r\n     found any new party upon. It is not a sentiment on which\r\n     Massachusetts Whigs differ. There is not a man in this hall who\r\n     holds to it more firmly than I do, nor one who adheres to it more\r\n     than another.\r\n\r\n     \"I feel some little interest in this matter, Sir. Did not I commit\r\n     myself in 1837 to the whole doctrine, fully, entirely? And I must\r\n     be permitted to say that I cannot quite consent that more recent\r\n     discoverers should claim the merit and take out a patent.\r\n\r\n     \"I deny the priority of their invention. Allow me to say, Sir, it\r\n     is not their thunder....\r\n\r\n     \"We are to use the first and the last and every occasion which\r\n     offers to oppose the extension of slave power.\r\n\r\n     \"But I speak of it here, as in Congress, as a political question, a\r\n     question for statesmen to act upon. We must so regard it. I\r\n     certainly do not mean to say that it is less important in a moral\r\n     point of view, that it is not more important in many other points\r\n     of view; but as a legislator, or in any official capacity, I must\r\n     look at it, consider it, and decide it as a matter of political\r\n     action.\"\r\n\r\nOn other occasions, in debates here, I have expressed my determination\r\nto vote for no acquisition, cession, or annexation, north or south, east\r\nor west. My opinion has been, that we have territory enough, and that we\r\nshould follow the Spartan maxim, \"Improve, adorn what you have,\" seek no\r\nfurther. I think that it was in some observations that I made on the\r\nthree-million loan bill that I avowed this sentiment. In short, Sir, it\r\nhas been avowed quite as often, in as many places, and before as many\r\nassemblies, as any humble opinions of mine ought to be avowed.\r\n\r\nBut now that, under certain conditions, Texas is in the Union, with all\r\nher territory, as a slave State, with a solemn pledge, also, that, if\r\nshe shall be divided into many States, those States may come in as slave\r\nStates south of 36° 30', how are we to deal with this subject? I know no\r\nway of honest legislation, when the proper time comes for the enactment,\r\nbut to carry into effect all that we have stipulated to do. I do not\r\nentirely agree with my honorable friend from Tennessee,[15] that, as\r\nsoon as the time comes when she is entitled to another representative,\r\nwe should create a new State. On former occasions, in creating new\r\nStates out of territories, we have generally gone upon the idea that,\r\nwhen the population of the territory amounts to about sixty thousand, we\r\nwould consent to its admission as a State. But it is quite a different\r\nthing when a State is divided, and two or more States made out of it. It\r\ndoes not follow in such a case that the same rule of apportionment\r\nshould be applied. That, however, is a matter for the consideration of\r\nCongress, when the proper time arrives. I may not then be here; I may\r\nhave no vote to give on the occasion; but I wish it to be distinctly\r\nunderstood, that, according to my view of the matter, this government is\r\nsolemnly pledged, by law and contract, to create new States out of\r\nTexas, with her consent, when her population shall justify and call for\r\nsuch a proceeding, and, so far as such States are formed out of Texan\r\nterritory lying south of 36° 30', to let them come in as slave States.\r\nThat is the meaning of the contract which our friends, the Northern\r\nDemocracy, have left us to fulfil; and I, for one, mean to fulfil it,\r\nbecause I will not violate the faith of the government. What I mean to\r\nsay is, that the time for the admission of new States formed out of\r\nTexas, the number of such States, their boundaries, the requisite amount\r\nof population, and all other things connected with the admission, are in\r\nthe free discretion of Congress, except this; to wit, that, when new\r\nStates formed out of Texas are to be admitted, they have a right, by\r\nlegal stipulation and contract, to come in as slave States.\r\n\r\nNow, as to California and New Mexico, I hold slavery to be excluded from\r\nthose territories by a law even superior to that which admits and\r\nsanctions it in Texas. I mean the law of nature, of physical geography,\r\nthe law of the formation of the earth. That law settles for ever, with a\r\nstrength beyond all terms of human enactment, that slavery cannot exist\r\nin California or New Mexico. Understand me, Sir; I mean slavery as we\r\nregard it; the slavery of the colored race as it exists in the Southern\r\nStates. I shall not discuss the point, but leave it to the learned\r\ngentlemen who have undertaken to discuss it; but I suppose there is no\r\nslavery of that description in California now. I understand that\r\n_peonism_, a sort of penal servitude, exists there, or rather a sort of\r\nvoluntary sale of a man and his offspring for debt; an arrangement of a\r\npeculiar nature known to the law of Mexico. But what I mean to say is,\r\nthat it is as impossible that African slavery, as we see it among us,\r\nshould find its way, or be introduced, into California and New Mexico,\r\nas any other natural impossibility. California and New Mexico are\r\nAsiatic in their formation and scenery. They are composed of vast ridges\r\nof mountains, of great height, with broken ridges and deep valleys. The\r\nsides of these mountains are entirely barren; their tops capped by\r\nperennial snow. There may be in California, now made free by its\r\nconstitution, and no doubt there are, some tracts of valuable land. But\r\nit is not so in New Mexico. Pray, what is the evidence which every\r\ngentleman must have obtained on this subject, from information sought by\r\nhimself or communicated by others? I have inquired and read all I could\r\nfind, in order to acquire information on this important subject. What is\r\nthere in New Mexico that could, by any possibility, induce anybody to go\r\nthere with slaves? There are some narrow strips of tillable land on the\r\nborders of the rivers; but the rivers themselves dry up before midsummer\r\nis gone. All that the people can do in that region is to raise some\r\nlittle articles, some little wheat for their _tortillas_, and that by\r\nirrigation. And who expects to see a hundred black men cultivating\r\ntobacco, corn, cotton, rice, or any thing else, on lands in New Mexico,\r\nmade fertile only by irrigation?\r\n\r\nI look upon it, therefore, as a fixed fact, to use the current\r\nexpression of the day, that both California and New Mexico are destined\r\nto be free, so far as they are settled at all, which I believe, in\r\nregard to New Mexico, will be but partially for a great length of time;\r\nfree by the arrangement of things ordained by the Power above us. I have\r\ntherefore to say, in this respect also, that this country is fixed for\r\nfreedom, to as many persons as shall ever live in it, by a less\r\nrepealable law than that which attaches to the right of holding slaves\r\nin Texas; and I will say further, that, if a resolution or a bill were\r\nnow before us, to provide a territorial government for New Mexico, I\r\nwould not vote to put any prohibition into it whatever. Such a\r\nprohibition would be idle, as it respects any effect it would have upon\r\nthe territory; and I would not take pains uselessly to reaffirm an\r\nordinance of nature, nor to re-enact the will of God. I would put in no\r\nWilmot Proviso for the mere purpose of a taunt or a reproach. I would\r\nput into it no evidence of the votes of superior power, exercised for no\r\npurpose but to wound the pride, whether a just and a rational pride, or\r\nan irrational pride, of the citizens of the Southern States. I have no\r\nsuch object, no such purpose. They would think it a taunt, an indignity;\r\nthey would think it to be an act taking away from them what they regard\r\nas a proper equality of privilege. Whether they expect to realize any\r\nbenefit from it or not, they would think it at least a plain theoretic\r\nwrong; that something more or less derogatory to their character and\r\ntheir rights had taken place. I propose to inflict no such wound upon\r\nanybody, unless something essentially important to the country, and\r\nefficient to the preservation of liberty and freedom, is to be effected.\r\nI repeat, therefore, Sir, and, as I do not propose to address the Senate\r\noften on this subject, I repeat it because I wish it to be distinctly\r\nunderstood, that, for the reasons stated, if a proposition were now here\r\nto establish a government for New Mexico, and it was moved to insert a\r\nprovision for a prohibition of slavery, I would not vote for it.\r\n\r\nSir, if we were now making a government for New Mexico, and anybody\r\nshould propose a Wilmot Proviso, I should treat it exactly as Mr. Polk\r\ntreated that provision for excluding slavery from Oregon. Mr. Polk was\r\nknown to be in opinion decidedly averse to the Wilmot Proviso; but he\r\nfelt the necessity of establishing a government for the Territory of\r\nOregon. The proviso was in the bill, but he knew it would be entirely\r\nnugatory; and, since it must be entirely nugatory, since it took away no\r\nright, no describable, no tangible, no appreciable right of the South,\r\nhe said he would sign the bill for the sake of enacting a law to form a\r\ngovernment in that Territory, and let that entirely useless, and, in\r\nthat connection, entirely senseless, proviso remain. Sir, we hear\r\noccasionally of the annexation of Canada; and if there be any man, any\r\nof the Northern Democracy, or any one of the Free Soil party, who\r\nsupposes it necessary to insert a Wilmot Proviso in a territorial\r\ngovernment for New Mexico, that man would of course be of opinion that\r\nit is necessary to protect the everlasting snows of Canada from the foot\r\nof slavery by the same overspreading wing of an act of Congress. Sir,\r\nwherever there is a substantive good to be done, wherever there is a\r\nfoot of land to be prevented from becoming slave territory, I am ready\r\nto assert the principle of the exclusion of slavery. I am pledged to it\r\nfrom the year 1837; I have been pledged to it again and again; and I\r\nwill perform those pledges; but I will not do a thing unnecessarily that\r\nwounds the feelings of others, or that does discredit to my own\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. President, I have established, so far as I proposed to do so,\r\nthe proposition with which I set out, and upon which I intend to stand\r\nor fall; and that is, that the whole territory within the former United\r\nStates, or in the newly acquired Mexican provinces, has a fixed and\r\nsettled character, now fixed and settled by law which cannot be\r\nrepealed,--in the case of Texas without a violation of public faith, and\r\nby no human power in regard to California or New Mexico; that,\r\ntherefore, under one or other of these laws, every foot of land in the\r\nStates or in the Territories has already received a fixed and decided\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nMr. President, in the excited times in which we live, there is found to\r\nexist a state of crimination and recrimination between the North and\r\nSouth. There are lists of grievances produced by each, and those\r\ngrievances, real or supposed, alienate the minds of one portion of the\r\ncountry from the other, exasperate the feelings, and subdue the sense of\r\nfraternal affection, patriotic love, and mutual regard. I shall bestow a\r\nlittle attention, Sir, upon these various grievances existing on the one\r\nside and on the other. I begin with complaints of the South. I will not\r\nanswer, further than I have, the general statements of the honorable\r\nSenator from South Carolina, that the North has prospered at the expense\r\nof the South in consequence of the manner of administering this\r\ngovernment, in the collecting of its revenues, and so forth. These are\r\ndisputed topics, and I have no inclination to enter into them. But I\r\nwill allude to other complaints of the South, and especially to one\r\nwhich has in my opinion just foundation; and that is, that there has\r\nbeen found at the North, among individuals and among legislators, a\r\ndisinclination to perform fully their constitutional duties in regard to\r\nthe return of persons bound to service who have escaped into the free\r\nStates. In that respect, the South, in my judgment, is right, and the\r\nNorth is wrong. Every member of every Northern legislature is bound by\r\noath, like every other officer in the country, to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States; and the article of the\r\nConstitution[16] which says to these States that they shall deliver up\r\nfugitives from service is as binding in honor and conscience as any\r\nother article. No man fulfils his duty in any legislature who sets\r\nhimself to find excuses, evasions, escapes from this constitutional\r\nobligation. I have always thought that the Constitution addressed itself\r\nto the legislatures of the States or to the States themselves. It says\r\nthat those persons escaping to other States \"shall be delivered up,\" and\r\nI confess I have always been of the opinion that it was an injunction\r\nupon the States themselves. When it is said that a person escaping into\r\nanother State, and coming therefore within the jurisdiction of that\r\nState, shall be delivered up, it seems to me the import of the clause\r\nis, that the State itself, in obedience to the Constitution, shall cause\r\nhim to be delivered up. That is my judgment. I have always entertained\r\nthat opinion, and I entertain it now. But when the subject, some years\r\nago, was before the Supreme Court of the United States, the majority of\r\nthe judges held that the power to cause fugitives from service to be\r\ndelivered up was a power to be exercised under the authority of this\r\ngovernment. I do not know, on the whole, that it may not have been a\r\nfortunate decision. My habit is to respect the result of judicial\r\ndeliberations and the solemnity of judicial decisions. As it now stands,\r\nthe business of seeing that these fugitives are delivered up resides in\r\nthe power of Congress and the national judicature, and my friend at the\r\nhead of the Judiciary Committee[17] has a bill on the subject now before\r\nthe Senate, which, with some amendments to it, I propose to support,\r\nwith all its provisions, to the fullest extent. And I desire to call the\r\nattention of all sober-minded men at the North, of all conscientious\r\nmen, of all men who are not carried away by some fanatical idea or some\r\nfalse impression, to their constitutional obligations. I put it to all\r\nthe sober and sound minds at the North as a question of morals and a\r\nquestion of conscience. What right have they, in their legislative\r\ncapacity or any other capacity, to endeavor to get round this\r\nConstitution, or to embarrass the free exercise of the rights secured by\r\nthe Constitution to the persons whose slaves escape from them? None at\r\nall; none at all. Neither in the forum of conscience, nor before the\r\nface of the Constitution, are they, in my opinion, justified in such an\r\nattempt. Of course it is a matter for their consideration. They\r\nprobably, in the excitement of the times, have not stopped to consider\r\nof this. They have followed what seemed to be the current of thought and\r\nof motives, as the occasion arose, and they have neglected to\r\ninvestigate fully the real question, and to consider their\r\nconstitutional obligations; which, I am sure, if they did consider, they\r\nwould fulfil with alacrity. I repeat, therefore, Sir, that here is a\r\nwell-founded ground of complaint against the North, which ought to be\r\nremoved, which it is now in the power of the different departments of\r\nthis government to remove; which calls for the enactment of proper laws\r\nauthorizing the judicature of this government, in the several States, to\r\ndo all that is necessary for the recapture of fugitive slaves and for\r\ntheir restoration to those who claim them. Wherever I go, and whenever I\r\nspeak on the subject, and when I speak here I desire to speak to the\r\nwhole North, I say that the South has been injured in this respect, and\r\nhas a right to complain; and the North has been too careless of what I\r\nthink the Constitution peremptorily and emphatically enjoins upon her as\r\na duty.\r\n\r\nComplaint has been made against certain resolutions that emanate from\r\nlegislatures at the North, and are sent here to us, not only on the\r\nsubject of slavery in this District, but sometimes recommending Congress\r\nto consider the means of abolishing slavery in the States. I should be\r\nsorry to be called upon to present any resolutions here which could not\r\nbe referable to any committee or any power in Congress; and therefore I\r\nshould be unwilling to receive from the legislature of Massachusetts any\r\ninstructions to present resolutions expressive of any opinion whatever\r\non the subject of slavery, as it exists at the present moment in the\r\nStates, for two reasons: first, because I do not consider that the\r\nlegislature of Massachusetts has any thing to do with it; and next,\r\nbecause I do not consider that I, as her representative here, have any\r\nthing to do with it. It has become, in my opinion, quite too common; and\r\nif the legislatures of the States do not like that opinion, they have a\r\ngreat deal more power to put it down than I have to uphold it; it has\r\nbecome, in my opinion, quite too common a practice for the State\r\nlegislatures to present resolutions here on all subjects and to instruct\r\nus on all subjects. There is no public man that requires instruction\r\nmore than I do, or who requires information more than I do, or desires\r\nit more heartily; but I do not like to have it in too imperative a\r\nshape. I took notice, with pleasure, of some remarks made upon this\r\nsubject, the other day, in the Senate of Massachusetts, by a young man\r\nof talent and character, of whom the best hopes may be entertained. I\r\nmean Mr. Hillard. He told the Senate of Massachusetts that he would vote\r\nfor no instructions whatever to be forwarded to members of Congress, nor\r\nfor any resolutions to be offered expressive of the sense of\r\nMassachusetts as to what her members of Congress ought to do. He said\r\nthat he saw no propriety in one set of public servants giving\r\ninstructions and reading lectures to another set of public servants. To\r\nhis own master each of them must stand or fall, and that master is his\r\nconstituents. I wish these sentiments could become more common. I have\r\nnever entered into the question, and never shall, as to the binding\r\nforce of instructions. I will, however, simply say this: if there be any\r\nmatter pending in this body, while I am a member of it, in which\r\nMassachusetts has an interest of her own not adverse to the general\r\ninterests of the country, I shall pursue her instructions with gladness\r\nof heart and with all the efficiency which I can bring to the occasion.\r\nBut if the question be one which affects her interest, and at the same\r\ntime equally affects the interests of all the other States, I shall no\r\nmore regard her particular wishes or instructions than I should regard\r\nthe wishes of a man who might appoint me an arbitrator or referee to\r\ndecide some question of important private right between him and his\r\nneighbor, and then _instruct_ me to decide in his favor. If ever there\r\nwas a government upon earth it is this government, if ever there was a\r\nbody upon earth it is this body, which should consider itself as\r\ncomposed by agreement of all, each member appointed by some, but\r\norganized by the general consent of all, sitting here, under the solemn\r\nobligations of oath and conscience, to do that which they think to be\r\nbest for the good of the whole.\r\n\r\nThen, Sir, there are the Abolition societies, of which I am unwilling\r\nto speak, but in regard to which I have very clear notions and opinions.\r\nI do not think them useful. I think their operations for the last twenty\r\nyears have produced nothing good or valuable. At the same time, I\r\nbelieve thousands of their members to be honest and good men, perfectly\r\nwell-meaning men. They have excited feelings; they think they must do\r\nsomething for the cause of liberty; and, in their sphere of action, they\r\ndo not see what else they can do than to contribute to an Abolition\r\npress, or an Abolition society, or to pay an Abolition lecturer. I do\r\nnot mean to impute gross motives even to the leaders of these societies;\r\nbut I am not blind to the consequences of their proceedings. I cannot\r\nbut see what mischiefs their interference with the South has produced.\r\nAnd is it not plain to every man? Let any gentleman who entertains\r\ndoubts on this point recur to the debates in the Virginia House of\r\nDelegates in 1832, and he will see with what freedom a proposition made\r\nby Mr. Jefferson Randolph for the gradual abolition of slavery was\r\ndiscussed in that body. Every one spoke of slavery as he thought; very\r\nignominious and disparaging names and epithets were applied to it. The\r\ndebates in the House of Delegates on that occasion, I believe, were all\r\npublished. They were read by every colored man who could read; and to\r\nthose who could not read, those debates were read by others. At that\r\ntime Virginia was not unwilling or afraid to discuss this question, and\r\nto let that part of her population know as much of the discussion as\r\nthey could learn. That was in 1832. As has been said by the honorable\r\nmember from South Carolina, these Abolition societies commenced their\r\ncourse of action in 1835. It is said, I do not know how true it may be,\r\nthat they sent incendiary publications into the slave States; at any\r\nrate, they attempted to arouse, and did arouse, a very strong feeling;\r\nin other words, they created great agitation in the North against\r\nSouthern slavery. Well, what was the result? The bonds of the slaves\r\nwere bound more firmly than before, their rivets were more strongly\r\nfastened. Public opinion, which in Virginia had begun to be exhibited\r\nagainst slavery, and was opening out for the discussion of the question,\r\ndrew back and shut itself up in its castle. I wish to know whether\r\nanybody in Virginia can now talk openly as Mr. Randolph, Governor\r\nMcDowell, and others talked in 1832, and sent their remarks to the\r\npress? We all know the fact, and we all know the cause; and every thing\r\nthat these agitating people have done has been, not to enlarge, but to\r\nrestrain, not to set free, but to bind faster, the slave population of\r\nthe South.[18]\r\n\r\nAgain, Sir, the violence of the Northern press is complained of. The\r\npress violent! Why, Sir, the press is violent everywhere. There are\r\noutrageous reproaches in the North against the South, and there are\r\nreproaches as vehement in the South against the North. Sir, the\r\nextremists of both parts of this country are violent; they mistake loud\r\nand violent talk for eloquence and for reason. They think that he who\r\ntalks loudest reasons best. And this we must expect, when the press is\r\nfree, as it is here, and I trust always will be; for, with all its\r\nlicentiousness and all its evil, the entire and absolute freedom of the\r\npress is essential to the preservation of government on the basis of a\r\nfree constitution. Wherever it exists there will be foolish and violent\r\nparagraphs in the newspapers, as there are, I am sorry to say, foolish\r\nand violent speeches in both houses of Congress. In truth, Sir, I must\r\nsay that, in my opinion, the vernacular tongue of the country has become\r\ngreatly vitiated, depraved, and corrupted by the style of our\r\nCongressional debates. And if it were possible for those debates to\r\nvitiate the principles of the people as much as they have depraved their\r\ntastes, I should cry out, \"God save the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nWell, in all this I see no solid grievance, no grievance presented by\r\nthe South, within the redress of the government, but the single one to\r\nwhich I have referred; and that is, the want of a proper regard to the\r\ninjunction of the Constitution for the delivery of fugitive slaves.\r\n\r\nThere are also complaints of the North against the South. I need not go\r\nover them particularly. The first and gravest is, that the North adopted\r\nthe Constitution, recognizing the existence of slavery in the States,\r\nand recognizing the right, to a certain extent, of the representation of\r\nslaves in Congress, under a state of sentiment and expectation which\r\ndoes not now exist; and that, by events, by circumstances, by the\r\neagerness of the South to acquire territory and extend her slave\r\npopulation, the North finds itself, in regard to the relative influence\r\nof the South and the North, of the free States and the slave States,\r\nwhere it never did expect to find itself when they agreed to the compact\r\nof the Constitution. They complain, therefore, that, instead of slavery\r\nbeing regarded as an evil, as it was then, an evil which all hoped would\r\nbe extinguished gradually, it is now regarded by the South as an\r\ninstitution to be cherished, and preserved, and extended; an institution\r\nwhich the South has already extended to the utmost of her power by the\r\nacquisition of new territory.\r\n\r\nWell, then, passing from that, everybody in the North reads; and\r\neverybody reads whatsoever the newspapers contain; and the newspapers,\r\nsome of them, especially those presses to which I have alluded, are\r\ncareful to spread about among the people every reproachful sentiment\r\nuttered by any Southern man bearing at all against the North; every\r\nthing that is calculated to exasperate and to alienate; and there are\r\nmany such things, as everybody will admit, from the South, or some\r\nportion of it, which are disseminated among the reading people; and they\r\ndo exasperate, and alienate, and produce a most mischievous effect upon\r\nthe public mind at the North. Sir, I would not notice things of this\r\nsort appearing in obscure quarters; but one thing has occurred in this\r\ndebate which struck me very forcibly. An honorable member from Louisiana\r\naddressed us the other day on this subject. I suppose there is not a\r\nmore amiable and worthy gentleman in this chamber, nor a gentleman who\r\nwould be more slow to give offence to anybody, and he did not mean in\r\nhis remarks to give offence. But what did he say? Why, Sir, he took\r\npains to run a contrast between the slaves of the South and the laboring\r\npeople of the North, giving the preference, in all points of condition,\r\nand comfort, and happiness, to the slaves of the South. The honorable\r\nmember, doubtless, did not suppose that he gave any offence, or did any\r\ninjustice. He was merely expressing his opinion. But does he know how\r\nremarks of that sort will be received by the laboring people of the\r\nNorth? Why, who are the laboring people of the North? They are the whole\r\nNorth. They are the people who till their own farms with their own\r\nhands; freeholders, educated men, independent men. Let me say, Sir, that\r\nfive sixths of the whole property of the North is in the hands of the\r\nlaborers of the North; they cultivate their farms, they educate their\r\nchildren, they provide the means of independence. If they are not\r\nfreeholders, they earn wages; these wages accumulate, are turned into\r\ncapital, into new freeholds, and small capitalists are created. Such is\r\nthe case, and such the course of things, among the industrious and\r\nfrugal. And what can these people think when so respectable and worthy a\r\ngentleman as the member from Louisiana undertakes to prove that the\r\nabsolute ignorance and the abject slavery of the South are more in\r\nconformity with the high purposes and destiny of immortal, rational\r\nhuman beings, than the educated, the independent free labor of the\r\nNorth?\r\n\r\nThere is a more tangible and irritating cause of grievance at the North.\r\nFree blacks are constantly employed in the vessels of the North,\r\ngenerally as cooks or stewards. When the vessel arrives at a Southern\r\nport, these free colored men are taken on shore, by the police or\r\nmunicipal authority, imprisoned, and kept in prison till the vessel is\r\nagain ready to sail. This is not only irritating, but exceedingly\r\nunjustifiable and oppressive. Mr. Hoar's mission, some time ago, to\r\nSouth Carolina, was a well-intended effort to remove this cause of\r\ncomplaint. The North thinks such imprisonments illegal and\r\nunconstitutional; and as the cases occur constantly and frequently, they\r\nregard it as a great grievance.\r\n\r\nNow, Sir, so far as any of these grievances have their foundation in\r\nmatters of law, they can be redressed, and ought to be redressed; and so\r\nfar as they have their foundation in matters of opinion, in sentiment,\r\nin mutual crimination and recrimination, all that we can do is to\r\nendeavor to allay the agitation, and cultivate a better feeling and more\r\nfraternal sentiments between the South and the North.\r\n\r\nMr. President, I should much prefer to have heard from every member on\r\nthis floor declarations of opinion that this Union could never be\r\ndissolved, than the declaration of opinion by anybody, that, in any\r\ncase, under the pressure of any circumstances, such a dissolution was\r\npossible. I hear with distress and anguish the word \"secession,\"\r\nespecially when it falls from the lips of those who are patriotic, and\r\nknown to the country, and known all over the world, for their political\r\nservices. Secession! Peaceable secession! Sir, your eyes and mine are\r\nnever destined to see that miracle. The dismemberment of this vast\r\ncountry without convulsion! The breaking up of the fountains of the\r\ngreat deep without ruffling the surface! Who is so foolish, I beg\r\neverybody's pardon, as to expect to see any such thing? Sir, he who sees\r\nthese States, now revolving in harmony around a common centre, and\r\nexpects to see them quit their places and fly off without convulsion,\r\nmay look the next hour to see the heavenly bodies rush from their\r\nspheres, and jostle against each other in the realms of space, without\r\ncausing the wreck of the universe. There can be no such thing as a\r\npeaceable secession. Peaceable secession is an utter impossibility. Is\r\nthe great Constitution under which we live, covering this whole\r\ncountry,--is it to be thawed and melted away by secession, as the snows\r\non the mountain melt under the influence of a vernal sun, disappear\r\nalmost unobserved, and run off? No, Sir! No, Sir! I will not state what\r\nmight produce the disruption of the Union; but, Sir, I see as plainly as\r\nI see the sun in heaven what that disruption itself must produce; I see\r\nthat it must produce war, and such a war as I will not describe, _in its\r\ntwofold character_.\r\n\r\nPeaceable secession! Peaceable secession! The concurrent agreement of\r\nall the members of this great republic to separate! A voluntary\r\nseparation, with alimony on one side and on the other. Why, what would\r\nbe the result? Where is the line to be drawn? What States are to secede?\r\nWhat is to remain American? What am I to be? An American no longer? Am I\r\nto become a sectional man, a local man, a separatist, with no country in\r\ncommon with the gentlemen who sit around me here, or who fill the other\r\nhouse of Congress? Heaven forbid! Where is the flag of the republic to\r\nremain? Where is the eagle still to tower? or is he to cower, and\r\nshrink, and fall to the ground? Why, Sir, our ancestors, our fathers and\r\nour grandfathers, those of them that are yet living amongst us with\r\nprolonged lives, would rebuke and reproach us; and our children and our\r\ngrandchildren would cry out shame upon us, if we of this generation\r\nshould dishonor these ensigns of the power of the government and the\r\nharmony of that Union which is every day felt among us with so much joy\r\nand gratitude. What is to become of the army? What is to become of the\r\nnavy? What is to become of the public lands? How is each of the thirty\r\nStates to defend itself? I know, although the idea has not been stated\r\ndistinctly, there is to be, or it is supposed possible that there will\r\nbe, a Southern Confederacy. I do not mean, when I allude to this\r\nstatement, that any one seriously contemplates such a state of things. I\r\ndo not mean to say that it is true, but I have heard it suggested\r\nelsewhere, that the idea has been entertained, that, after the\r\ndissolution of this Union, a Southern Confederacy might be formed. I am\r\nsorry, Sir, that it has ever been thought of, talked of, or dreamed of,\r\nin the wildest flights of human imagination. But the idea, so far as it\r\nexists, must be of a separation, assigning the slave States to one side\r\nand the free States to the other. Sir, I may express myself too\r\nstrongly, perhaps, but there are impossibilities in the natural as well\r\nas in the physical world, and I hold the idea of a separation of these\r\nStates, those that are free to form one government, and those that are\r\nslave-holding to form another, as such an impossibility. We could not\r\nseparate the States by any such line, if we were to draw it. We could\r\nnot sit down here to-day and draw a line of separation that would\r\nsatisfy any five men in the country. There are natural causes that would\r\nkeep and tie us together, and there are social and domestic relations\r\nwhich we could not break if we would, and which we should not if we\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nSir, nobody can look over the face of this country at the present\r\nmoment, nobody can see where its population is the most dense and\r\ngrowing, without being ready to admit, and compelled to admit, that\r\nerelong the strength of America will be in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi. Well, now, Sir, I beg to inquire what the wildest\r\nenthusiast has to say on the possibility of cutting that river in two,\r\nand leaving free States at its source and on its branches, and slave\r\nStates down near its mouth, each forming a separate government? Pray,\r\nSir, let me say to the people of this country, that these things are\r\nworthy of their pondering and of their consideration. Here, Sir, are\r\nfive millions of freemen in the free States north of the river Ohio. Can\r\nanybody suppose that this population can be severed, by a line that\r\ndivides them from the territory of a foreign and an alien government,\r\ndown somewhere, the Lord knows where, upon the lower banks of the\r\nMississippi? What would become of Missouri? Will she join the\r\n_arrondissement_ of the slave States? Shall the man from the Yellowstone\r\nand the Platte be connected, in the new republic, with the man who lives\r\non the southern extremity of the Cape of Florida? Sir, I am ashamed to\r\npursue this line of remark. I dislike it, I have an utter disgust for\r\nit. I would rather hear of natural blasts and mildews, war, pestilence,\r\nand famine, than to hear gentlemen talk of secession. To break up this\r\ngreat government! to dismember this glorious country! to astonish Europe\r\nwith an act of folly such as Europe for two centuries has never beheld\r\nin any government or any people! No, Sir! no, Sir! There will be no\r\nsecession! Gentlemen are not serious when they talk of secession.\r\n\r\nSir, I hear there is to be a convention held at Nashville. I am bound to\r\nbelieve that, if worthy gentlemen meet at Nashville in convention, their\r\nobject will be to adopt conciliatory counsels; to advise the South to\r\nforbearance and moderation, and to advise the North to forbearance and\r\nmoderation; and to inculcate principles of brotherly love and affection,\r\nand attachment to the Constitution of the country as it now is. I\r\nbelieve, if the convention meet at all, it will be for this purpose; for\r\ncertainly, if they meet for any purpose hostile to the Union, they have\r\nbeen singularly inappropriate in their selection of a place. I remember,\r\nSir, that, when the treaty of Amiens was concluded between France and\r\nEngland, a sturdy Englishman and a distinguished orator, who regarded\r\nthe conditions of the peace as ignominious to England, said in the House\r\nof Commons, that, if King William could know the terms of that treaty,\r\nhe would turn in his coffin! Let me commend this saying of Mr. Windham,\r\nin all its emphasis and in all its force, to any persons who shall meet\r\nat Nashville for the purpose of concerting measures for the overthrow of\r\nthis Union over the bones of Andrew Jackson!\r\n\r\nSir, I wish now to make two remarks, and hasten to a conclusion. I wish\r\nto say, in regard to Texas, that if it should be hereafter, at any time,\r\nthe pleasure of the government of Texas to cede to the United States a\r\nportion, larger or smaller, of her territory which lies adjacent to New\r\nMexico, and north of 36° 30' of north latitude, to be formed into free\r\nStates, for a fair equivalent in money or in the payment of her debt, I\r\nthink it an object well worthy the consideration of Congress, and I\r\nshall be happy to concur in it myself, if I should have a connection\r\nwith the government at that time.\r\n\r\nI have one other remark to make. In my observations upon slavery as it\r\nhas existed in this country, and as it now exists, I have expressed no\r\nopinion of the mode of its extinguishment or melioration. I will say,\r\nhowever, though I have nothing to propose, because I do not deem myself\r\nso competent as other gentlemen to take any lead on this subject, that\r\nif any gentleman from the South shall propose a scheme, to be carried on\r\nby this government upon a large scale, for the transportation of free\r\ncolored people to any colony or any place in the world, I should be\r\nquite disposed to incur almost any degree of expense to accomplish that\r\nobject. Nay, Sir, following an example set more than twenty years ago by\r\na great man,[19] then a Senator from New York, I would return to\r\nVirginia, and through her to the whole South, the money received from\r\nthe lands and territories ceded by her to this government, for any such\r\npurpose as to remove, in whole or in part, or in any way to diminish or\r\ndeal beneficially with, the free colored population of the Southern\r\nStates. I have said that I honor Virginia for her cession of this\r\nterritory. There have been received into the treasury of the United\r\nStates eighty millions of dollars, the proceeds of the sales of the\r\npublic lands ceded by her. If the residue should be sold at the same\r\nrate, the whole aggregate will exceed two hundred millions of dollars.\r\nIf Virginia and the South see fit to adopt any proposition to relieve\r\nthemselves from the free people of color among them, or such as may be\r\nmade free, they have my full consent that the government shall pay them\r\nany sum of money out of the proceeds of that cession which may be\r\nadequate to the purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. President, I draw these observations to a close. I have\r\nspoken freely, and I meant to do so. I have sought to make no display. I\r\nhave sought to enliven the occasion by no animated discussion, nor have\r\nI attempted any train of elaborate argument. I have wished only to speak\r\nmy sentiments, fully and at length, being desirous, once and for all, to\r\nlet the Senate know, and to let the country know, the opinions and\r\nsentiments which I entertain on all these subjects. These opinions are\r\nnot likely to be suddenly changed. If there be any future service that I\r\ncan render to the country, consistently with these sentiments and\r\nopinions, I shall cheerfully render it. If there be not, I shall still\r\nbe glad to have had an opportunity to disburden myself from the bottom\r\nof my heart, and to make known every political sentiment that therein\r\nexists.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Mr. President, instead of speaking of the possibility or\r\nutility of secession, instead of dwelling in those caverns of darkness,\r\ninstead of groping with those ideas so full of all that is horrid and\r\nhorrible, let us come out into the light of day; let us enjoy the fresh\r\nair of Liberty and Union; let us cherish those hopes which belong to us;\r\nlet us devote ourselves to those great objects that are fit for our\r\nconsideration and our action; let us raise our conceptions to the\r\nmagnitude and the importance of the duties that devolve upon us; let our\r\ncomprehension be as broad as the country for which we act, our\r\naspirations as high as its certain destiny; let us not be pygmies in a\r\ncase that calls for men. Never did there devolve on any generation of\r\nmen higher trusts than now devolve upon us, for the preservation of this\r\nConstitution and the harmony and peace of all who are destined to live\r\nunder it. Let us make our generation one of the strongest and brightest\r\nlinks in that golden chain which is destined, I fondly believe, to\r\ngrapple the people of all the States to this Constitution for ages to\r\ncome. We have a great, popular, constitutional government, guarded by\r\nlaw and by judicature, and defended by the affections of the whole\r\npeople. No monarchical throne presses these States together, no iron\r\nchain of military power encircles them; they live and stand under a\r\ngovernment popular in its form, representative in its character, founded\r\nupon principles of equality, and so constructed, we hope, as to last for\r\never. In all its history it has been beneficent; it has trodden down no\r\nman's liberty; it has crushed no State. Its daily respiration is liberty\r\nand patriotism; its yet youthful veins are full of enterprise, courage,\r\nand honorable love of glory and renown. Large before, the country has\r\nnow, by recent events, become vastly larger. This republic now extends,\r\nwith a vast breadth, across the whole continent. The two great seas of\r\nthe world wash the one and the other shore. We realize, on a mighty\r\nscale, the beautiful description of the ornamental border of the buckler\r\nof Achilles:--\r\n\r\n    \"Now, the broad shield complete, the artist crowned\r\n    With his last hand, and poured the ocean round;\r\n    In living silver seemed the waves to roll,\r\n    And beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nPage 619.\r\n\r\n_Letter from Mr. Webster to the Editors of the National Intelligencer,\r\nenclosing Extracts from a Letter of the late Dr. Channing._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Washington, February 15, 1851._\r\n\r\nMESSRS. GALES AND SEATON:--\r\n\r\nHaving occasion recently to look over some files of letters written\r\nseveral years ago, I happened to fall on one from the late Rev. Dr. W.E.\r\nChanning. It contains passages which I think, coming from such a source,\r\nand written at such a time, would be interesting to the country. I have\r\ntherefore extracted them, and send them to you for publication in your\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Boston, May 14, 1828._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR.--\r\n\r\nI wish to call your attention to a subject of general interest.\r\n\r\nA little while ago, Mr. Lundy of Baltimore, the editor of a paper called\r\n\"The Genius of Universal Emancipation,\" visited this part of the\r\ncountry, to stir us up to the work of abolishing slavery at the South,\r\nand the intention is to organize societies for this purpose. I know few\r\nobjects into which I should enter with more zeal, but I am aware how\r\ncautiously exertions are to be made for it in this part of the country.\r\nI know that our Southern brethren interpret every word from this region\r\non the subject of slavery as an expression of hostility. I would ask if\r\nthey cannot be brought to understand us better, and if we can do any\r\ngood till we remove their misapprehensions. It seems to me that, before\r\nmoving in this matter, we ought to say to them distinctly, \"We consider\r\nslavery as your calamity, not your crime, and we will share with you the\r\nburden of putting an end to it. We will consent that the public lands\r\nshall be appropriated to this object; or that the general government\r\nshall be clothed with power to apply a portion of revenue to it.\"\r\n\r\nI throw out these suggestions merely to illustrate my views. We must\r\nfirst let the Southern States see that we are their _friends_ in this\r\naffair; that we sympathize with them, and, from principles of patriotism\r\nand philanthropy, are willing to share the toil and expense of\r\nabolishing slavery, or I fear our interference will avail nothing. I am\r\nthe more sensitive on this subject from my increased solicitude for the\r\npreservation of the Union. I know no public interest so important as\r\nthis. I ask from the general government hardly any other boon than that\r\nit will hold us together, and preserve pacific relations and intercourse\r\namong the States. I deprecate every thing which sows discord and\r\nexasperates sectional animosities. If it will simply keep us at peace,\r\nand will maintain in full power the national courts, for the purpose of\r\nsettling quietly among citizens of different States questions which\r\nmight otherwise be settled by arms, I shall be satisfied.\r\n\r\nMy fear in regard to our efforts against slavery is, that we shall make\r\nthe case worse by rousing sectional pride and passion for its support,\r\nand that we shall only break the country into two great parties, which\r\nmay shake the foundations of government.\r\n\r\nI have written to you because your situation gives you advantages which\r\nperhaps no other man enjoys for ascertaining the method, if any can be\r\ndevised, by which we may operate beneficially and safely in regard to\r\nslavery. Appeals will probably be made soon to the people here, and I\r\nwish that wise men would save us from the rashness of enthusiasts, and\r\nfrom the perils to which our very virtues expose us.\r\n\r\nWith great respect, your friend,\r\n\r\nWM.

It is not the first time that I have been in\r\nBuffalo, and I have always come to it with gratification. It is at a\r\ngreat distance from my own home. I am thankful that circumstances have\r\nenabled me to be here again, and I regret that untoward events deprived\r\nme of the pleasure of being with you when your distinguished\r\nfellow-citizen, the President of the United States, visited you, and\r\nreceived from you, as he deserved, not only a respectful, but a cordial\r\nand enthusiastic welcome. The President of the United States has been a\r\nresident among you for more than half his life. He has represented you\r\nin the State and national councils. You know him and all his relations,\r\nboth public and private, and it would be bad taste in me to say any\r\nthing of him, except that I wish to say, with emphasis, that, since my\r\nconnection with him in the administration of the government of the\r\nUnited States, I have fully concurred with him in all his great and\r\nleading measures. This might be inferred from the fact that I have been\r\none of his ordinary advisers. But I do not wish to let it rest on that\r\npresumption; I wish to declare that the principles of the President, as\r\nset forth in his annual message, his letters, and all documents and\r\nopinions which have proceeded from him, or been issued by his authority,\r\nin regard to the great question of the times,--all these principles are\r\nmy principles; and if he is wrong in them, I am, and always shall be.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, it has been suggested to me that it would be agreeable to the\r\ncitizens of Buffalo, and their neighbors in the county of Erie, that I\r\nshould state to you my opinions, whatever may be their value, on the\r\npresent condition of the country, its prospects, its hopes, and its\r\ndangers; and, fellow-citizens, I intend to do that, this day, and this\r\nhour, as far as my strength will permit.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, believe me, I know where I am. I know to whom I am speaking.\r\nI know for whom I am speaking. I know that I am here in this singularly\r\nprosperous and powerful section of the United States, Western New York,\r\nand I know the character of the men who inhabit Western New York. I know\r\nthey are sons of liberty, one and all; that they sucked in liberty with\r\ntheir mothers' milk; inherited it with their blood; that it is the\r\nsubject of their daily contemplation and watchful thought. They are men\r\nof unusual equality of condition, for a million and a half of people.\r\nThere are thousands of men around us, and here before us, who till their\r\nown soil with their own hands; and others who earn their own livelihood\r\nby their own labor in the workshops and other places of industry; and\r\nthey are independent, in principle and in condition, having neither\r\nslaves nor masters, and not intending to have either. These are the men\r\nwho constitute, to a great extent, the people of Western New York. But\r\nthe school-house, I know, is among them. Education is among them. They\r\nread, and write, and think. Here, too, are women, educated, refined, and\r\nintelligent; and here are men who know the history of their country, and\r\nthe laws of their country, and the institutions of their country; and\r\nmen, lovers of liberty always, and yet lovers of liberty under the\r\nConstitution of the country, and who mean to maintain that Constitution\r\nwith all their strength. I hope these observations will satisfy you that\r\nI know where I am, under what responsibility I speak, and before whom I\r\nappear; and I have no desire that any word I shall say this day shall be\r\nwithholden from you, or your children, or your neighbors, or the whole\r\nworld; for I speak before you and before my country, and, if it be not\r\ntoo solemn to say so, before the great Author of all things.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, there is but one question in this country now; or, if there\r\nbe others, they are but secondary, or so subordinate that they are all\r\nabsorbed in that great and leading question; and that is neither more\r\nnor less than this: Can we preserve the union of the States, not by\r\ncoercion, not by military power, not by angry controversies,--but can we\r\nof this generation, you and I, your friends and my friends,--can we so\r\npreserve the union of these States, by such administration of the powers\r\nof the Constitution as shall give content and satisfaction to all who\r\nlive under it, and draw us together, not by military power, but by the\r\nsilken cords of mutual, fraternal, patriotic affection? That is the\r\nquestion, and no other. Gentlemen, I believe in party distinctions. I am\r\na party man. There are questions belonging to party in which I take an\r\ninterest, and there are opinions entertained by other parties which I\r\nrepudiate; but what of all that? If a house be divided against itself,\r\nit will fall, and crush everybody in it. We must see that we maintain\r\nthe government which is over us. We must see that we uphold the\r\nConstitution, and we must do so without regard to party.\r\n\r\nNow how did this question arise? The question is for ever misstated. I\r\ndare say, if you know much of me, or of my course of public conduct, for\r\nthe last fourteen months, you have heard of my attending Union meetings,\r\nand of my fervent admonitions at Union meetings. Well, what was the\r\nobject of those meetings? What was their purpose? The object and purpose\r\nhave been designedly or thoughtlessly misrepresented. I had an\r\ninvitation, some time since, to attend a Union meeting in the county of\r\nWestchester; I could not go, but wrote a letter. Well, some wise man of\r\nthe East said he did not think it was very necessary to hold Union\r\nmeetings in Westchester. He did not think there were many disunionists\r\nabout Tarrytown! And so in many parts of the country, there is a total\r\nmisapprehension of the purpose and object of these Union meetings. Every\r\none knows, that there is not a county, or a city, or a hamlet in the\r\nState of New York, that is ready to go out of the Union, but only some\r\nsmall bodies of fanatics. There is no man so insane in the State, not\r\nfit for a lunatic asylum, as to wish it. But that is not the point. We\r\nall know that every man and every neighborhood, and all corporations, in\r\nthe State of New York, except those I have mentioned, are attached to\r\nthe Union, and have no idea of withdrawing from it. But that is not, I\r\nrepeat, the point. The question, fellow-citizens, (and I put it to you\r\nnow as the real question,) the question is, Whether you and the rest of\r\nthe people of the great State of New York, and of all the States, will\r\nso adhere to the Constitution, will so enact and maintain laws to\r\npreserve that instrument, that you will not only remain in the Union\r\nyourselves, but permit your brethren to remain in it, and help to\r\nperpetuate it? That is the question. Will you concur in measures\r\nnecessary to maintain the Union, or will you oppose such measures? That\r\nis the whole point of the case.\r\n\r\nThere are thirty or forty members of Congress from New York; you have\r\nyour proportion in the United States Senate. We have many members of\r\nCongress from New England. Will they maintain the laws that are passed\r\nfor the administration of the Constitution, and respect the rights of\r\nthe South, so that the Union may be held together; and not only so that\r\nwe may not go out of it ourselves, which we are not inclined to do, but\r\nso that, by maintaining the rights of others, they may also remain in\r\nthe Union? Now, Gentlemen, permit me to say, that I speak of no\r\nconcessions. If the South wish any concession from me, they will not get\r\nit; not a hair's breadth of it. If they come to my house for it, they\r\nwill not find it, and the door will be shut; I concede nothing. But I\r\nsay that I will maintain for them, as I will maintain for you, to the\r\nutmost of my power, and in the face of all danger, their rights under\r\nthe Constitution, and your rights under the Constitution. And I shall\r\nnever be found to falter in one or the other. It is obvious to every\r\none, and we all know it, that the origin of the great disturbance which\r\nagitates the country is the existence of slavery in some of the States;\r\nbut we must meet the subject; we must consider it; we must deal with it\r\nearnestly, honestly, and justly. From the mouth of the St. John's to the\r\nconfines of Florida, there existed, in 1775, thirteen colonies of\r\nEnglish origin, planted at different times, and coming from different\r\nparts of England, bringing with them various habits, and establishing,\r\neach for itself, institutions entirely different from the institutions\r\nwhich they left, and in many cases from each other. But they were all of\r\nEnglish origin. The English language was theirs, Shakepeare and Milton\r\nwere theirs, the common law of England was theirs, and the Christian\r\nreligion was theirs; and these things held them together by the force of\r\na common character. The aggressions of the parent state compelled them\r\nto assert their independence. They declared independence, and that\r\nimmortal act, pronounced on the 4th of July, 1776, made them\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\nThat was an act of union by the United States in Congress assembled. But\r\nthis act of itself did nothing to establish over them a general\r\ngovernment. They had a Congress. They had Articles of Confederation to\r\nprosecute the war. But thus far they were still, essentially, separate\r\nand independent each of the other. They had entered into a simple\r\nconfederacy, and nothing more. No State was bound by what it did not\r\nitself agree to, or what was done according to the provisions of the\r\nconfederation. That was the state of things, Gentlemen, at that time.\r\nThe war went on; victory crowned the American arms; our independence was\r\nacknowledged. The States were then united together under a confederacy\r\nof very limited powers. It could levy no taxes. It could not enforce its\r\nown decrees. It was a confederacy, instead of a united government.\r\nExperience showed that this was insufficient and inefficient.\r\nAccordingly, beginning as far back almost as the close of the war,\r\nmeasures were taken for the formation of a united government, a\r\ngovernment in the strict sense of the term, a government that could pass\r\nlaws binding on the individual citizens of all the States, and which\r\ncould enforce those laws by its executive powers, having them\r\ninterpreted by a judicial power belonging to the government itself, and\r\nyet a government strictly limited in its nature. Well, Gentlemen, this\r\nled to the formation of the Constitution of the United States, and that\r\ninstrument was framed on the idea of a limited government. It proposed\r\nto leave, and did leave, the different domestic institutions of the\r\nseveral States to themselves. It did not propose consolidation. It did\r\nnot propose that the laws of Virginia should be the laws of New York, or\r\nthat the laws of New York should be the laws of Massachusetts. It\r\nproposed only that, for certain purposes and to a certain extent, there\r\nshould be a united government, and that that government should have the\r\npower of executing its own laws. All the rest was left to the several\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWe now come, Gentlemen, to the very point of the case. At that time\r\nslavery existed in the Southern States, entailed upon them in the time\r\nof the supremacy of British laws over us. There it was. It was obnoxious\r\nto the Middle and Eastern States, and honestly and seriously disliked,\r\nas the records of the country will show, by the Southern States\r\nthemselves. Now, how was it to be dealt with? Were the Northern and\r\nMiddle States to exclude from the government those States of the South\r\nwhich had produced a Washington, a Laurens, and other distinguished\r\npatriots, who had so truly served, and so greatly honored, the whole\r\ncountry? Were they to be excluded from the new government because they\r\ntolerated the institution of slavery? Your fathers and my fathers did\r\nnot think so. They did not see that it would be of the least advantage\r\nto the slaves of the Southern States, to cut off the South from all\r\nconnection with the North. Their views of humanity led to no such\r\nresult; and of course, when the Constitution was framed and established,\r\nand adopted by you, here in New York, and by New England, it contained\r\nan express provision of security to the persons who lived in the\r\nSouthern States, in regard to fugitives who owed them service; that is\r\nto say, it was stipulated that the fugitive from service or labor should\r\nbe restored to his master or owner if he escaped into a free State.\r\nWell, that had been the history of the country from its first\r\nsettlement. It was a matter of common practice to return fugitives\r\nbefore the Constitution was formed. Fugitive slaves from Virginia to\r\nMassachusetts were restored by the people of Massachusetts. At that day\r\nthere was a great system of apprenticeship at the North, and many\r\napprentices at the North, taking advantage of circumstances, and of\r\nvessels sailing to the South, thereby escaped; and they were restored on\r\nproper claim and proof. That led to a clear, express, and well-defined\r\nprovision in the Constitution of the country on the subject. Now I am\r\naware that all these things are well known; that they have been stated a\r\nthousand times; but in these days of perpetual discontent and\r\nmisrepresentation, to state things a thousand times is not enough; for\r\nthere are persons whose consciences, it would seem, lead them to\r\nconsider it their duty to deny, misrepresent, falsify, and cover up\r\ntruths.\r\n\r\nNow these are words of the Constitution, fellow-citizens, which I have\r\ntaken the pains to transcribe therefrom, so that he who runs may read:--\r\n\r\n\"NO PERSON HELD TO SERVICE OR LABOR IN ONE STATE, UNDER THE LAWS\r\nTHEREOF, ESCAPING INTO ANOTHER, SHALL, IN CONSEQUENCE OF ANY LAW OR\r\nREGULATION THEREIN, BE DISCHARGED FROM SUCH SERVICE OR LABOR, BUT SHALL\r\nBE DELIVERED UP ON CLAIM OF THE PARTY TO WHOM SUCH SERVICE OR LABOR MAY\r\nBE DUE.\"\r\n\r\nIs there any mistake about that? Is there any forty-shilling attorney\r\nhere to make a question of it? No. I will not disgrace my profession by\r\nsupposing such a thing. There is not, in or out of an attorney's office\r\nin the county of Erie, or elsewhere, one who could raise a doubt, or a\r\nparticle of a doubt, about the meaning of this provision of the\r\nConstitution. He may act as witnesses do, sometimes, on the stand. He\r\nmay wriggle, and twist, and say he cannot tell, or cannot remember. I\r\nhave seen many such efforts in my time, on the part of witnesses, to\r\nfalsify and deny the truth. But there is no man who can read these words\r\nof the Constitution of the United States, and say they are not clear and\r\nimperative. \"No person,\" the Constitution says, \"held to service or\r\nlabor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another,\r\nshall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged\r\nfrom such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the\r\nparty to whom such service or labor may be due.\" Why, you may be told by\r\nforty conventions in Massachusetts, in Ohio, in New York, or elsewhere,\r\nthat, if a colored man comes here, he comes as a freeman; that is a _non\r\nsequitur_. It is not so. If he comes as a fugitive from labor, the\r\nConstitution says he is not a freeman, and that he shall be delivered up\r\nto those who are entitled to his service.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, that is the Constitution of the United States. Do we, or do\r\nwe not, mean to conform to it, and to execute that part of the\r\nConstitution as well as the rest of it? I believe there are before me\r\nhere members of Congress. I suppose there may be here members of the\r\nState legislature, or executive officers under the State government. I\r\nsuppose there may be judicial magistrates of New York, executive\r\nofficers, assessors, supervisors, justices of the peace, and constables\r\nbefore me. Allow me to say, Gentlemen, that there is not, that there\r\ncannot be, any one of these officers in this assemblage, or elsewhere,\r\nwho has not, according to the form of the usual obligation, bound\r\nhimself by a solemn oath to support the Constitution. They have taken\r\ntheir oaths on the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, or by uplifted\r\nhand, as the case may be, or by a solemn affirmation, as is the practice\r\nin some cases; but among all of them there is not a man who holds, nor\r\nis there any man who can hold, any office in the gift of the United\r\nStates, or of this State, or of any other State, who does not bind\r\nhimself, by the solemn obligation of an oath, to support the\r\nConstitution of the United States. Well, is he to tamper with that? Is\r\nhe to palter? Gentlemen, our political duties are as much matters of\r\nconscience as any other duties; our sacred domestic ties, our most\r\nendearing social relations, are no more the subjects for conscientious\r\nconsideration and conscientious discharge, than the duties we enter upon\r\nunder the Constitution of the United States. The bonds of political\r\nbrotherhood, which hold us together from Maine to Georgia, rest upon the\r\nsame principles of obligation as those of domestic and social life.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, that is the plain story of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States, on the question of slavery. I contend, and have always\r\ncontended, that, after the adoption of the Constitution, any measure of\r\nthe government calculated to bring more slave territory into the United\r\nStates was beyond the power of the Constitution, and against its\r\nprovisions. That is my opinion, and it always has been my opinion. It\r\nwas inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States, or thought\r\nto be so, in Mr. Jefferson's time, to attach Louisiana to the United\r\nStates. A treaty with France was made for that purpose. Mr. Jefferson's\r\nopinion at that moment was, that an alteration of the Constitution was\r\nnecessary to enable it to be done. In consequence of considerations to\r\nwhich I need not now refer, that opinion was abandoned, and Louisiana\r\nwas admitted by law, without any provision in, or alteration of, the\r\nConstitution. At that time I was too young to hold any office, or take\r\nany share in the political affairs of the country. Louisiana was\r\nadmitted as a slave State, and became entitled to her representation in\r\nCongress on the principle of a mixed basis. Florida was afterwards\r\nadmitted. Then, too, I was out of Congress. I had formerly been a\r\nmember, but had ceased to be so. I had nothing to do with the Florida\r\ntreaty, or the admission of Florida. My opinion remains unchanged, that\r\nit was not within the original scope or design of the Constitution to\r\nadmit new States out of foreign territory; and, for one, whatever may be\r\nsaid at the Syracuse Convention, or at any other assemblage of insane\r\npersons, I never would consent, and never have consented, that there\r\nshould be one foot of slave territory beyond what the old thirteen\r\nStates had at the time of the formation of the Union. Never, never! The\r\nman cannot show his face to me, and say he can prove that I ever\r\ndeparted from that doctrine. He would sneak away, and slink away, or\r\nhire a mercenary press to cry out, What an apostate from liberty Daniel\r\nWebster has become! But he knows himself to be a hypocrite and a\r\nfalsifier.\r\n\r\nBut, Gentlemen, I was in public life when the proposition to annex Texas\r\nto the United States was brought forward. You know that the revolution\r\nin Texas, which separated that country from Mexico, occurred in the year\r\n1835 or 1836. I saw then, and I do not know that it required any\r\nparticular foresight, that it would be the very next thing to bring\r\nTexas, which was designed to be a slave-holding State, into this Union.\r\nI did not wait. I sought an occasion to proclaim my utter aversion to\r\nany such measure, and I determined to resist it with all my strength to\r\nthe last. On this subject, Gentlemen, you will bear with me, if I now\r\nrepeat, in the presence of this assembly, what I have before spoken\r\nelsewhere. I was in this city in the year 1837, and, some time before I\r\nleft New York on that excursion from which I returned to this place, my\r\nfriends in New York were kind enough to offer me a public dinner as a\r\ntestimony of their regard. I went out of my way, in a speech delivered\r\nin Niblo's Saloon, on that occasion, for the purpose of showing that I\r\nanticipated the attempt to annex Texas as a slave territory, and said it\r\nshould be opposed by me to the last extremity. Well, there was the press\r\nall around me,--the Whig press and the Democratic press. Some spoke in\r\nterms commendatory enough of my speech, but all agreed that I took pains\r\nto step out of my way to denounce in advance the annexation of Texas as\r\nslave territory to the United States. I said on that occasion:--\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen, we all see that, by whomsoever possessed, Texas is\r\n     likely to be a slave-holding country; and I frankly avow my entire\r\n     unwillingness to do any thing that shall extend the slavery of the\r\n     African race on this continent, or add other slave-holding States\r\n     to the Union. When I say that I regard slavery in itself as a great\r\n     moral, social, and political evil, I only use language which has\r\n     been adopted by distinguished men, themselves citizens of\r\n     slave-holding States. I shall do nothing, therefore, to favor or\r\n     encourage its further extension. We have slavery already amongst\r\n     us. The Constitution found it in the Union; it recognized it, and\r\n     gave it solemn guaranties. To the full extent of these guaranties\r\n     we are all bound, in honor, in justice, and by the Constitution.\r\n     All the stipulations contained in the Constitution in favor of the\r\n     slave-holding States which are already in the Union ought to be\r\n     fulfilled, and, so far as depends on me, shall be fulfilled, in the\r\n     fulness of their spirit and to the exactness of their letter.\r\n     Slavery, as it exists in the States, is beyond the reach of\r\n     Congress. It is a concern of the States themselves; they have never\r\n     submitted it to Congress, and Congress has no rightful power over\r\n     it. I shall concur, therefore, in no act, no measure, no menace, no\r\n     indication of purpose, which shall interfere or threaten to\r\n     interfere with the exclusive authority of the several States over\r\n     the subject of slavery as it exists within their respective limits.\r\n     All this appears to me to be matter of plain and imperative duty.\r\n     But when we come to speak of admitting new States, the subject\r\n     assumes an entirely different aspect. Our rights and our duties are\r\n     then both different. The free States, and all the States, are then\r\n     at liberty to accept or to reject. When it is proposed to bring new\r\n     members into this political partnership, the old members have a\r\n     right to say on what terms such new partners are to come in, and\r\n     what they are to bring along with them. In my opinion, the people\r\n     of the United States will not consent to bring into the Union a\r\n     new, vastly extensive, and slave-holding country, large enough for\r\n     half a dozen or a dozen States. In my opinion they ought not to\r\n     consent to it.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I was mistaken; Congress did consent to the bringing in of\r\nTexas. They did consent, and I was a false prophet. Your own State\r\nconsented, and the majority of the representatives of New York\r\nconsented. I went into Congress before the final consummation of the\r\ndeed, and there I fought, holding up both my hands, and urging, with a\r\nvoice stronger than it now is, my remonstrances against the whole of it.\r\nBut you would have it so, and you did have it so. Nay, Gentlemen, I will\r\ntell the truth, whether it shames the Devil or not. Persons who have\r\naspired high as lovers of liberty, as eminent lovers of the Wilmot\r\nProviso, as eminent Free Soil men, and who have mounted over our heads,\r\nand trodden us down as if we were mere slaves, insisting that they are\r\nthe only true lovers of liberty, they are the men, the very men, that\r\nbrought Texas into this Union. This is the truth, the whole truth, and\r\nnothing but the truth, and I declare it before you, this day. Look to\r\nthe journals. Without the consent of New York, Texas would not have come\r\ninto the Union, either under the original resolutions or afterwards.\r\nBut New York voted for the measure. The two Senators from New York voted\r\nfor it, and decided the question; and you may thank them for the glory,\r\nthe renown, and the happiness of having five or six slave States added\r\nto the Union. Do not blame me for it. Let them answer who did the deed,\r\nand who are now proclaiming themselves the champions of liberty, crying\r\nup their Free Soil creed, and using it for selfish and deceptive\r\npurposes. They were the persons who aided in bringing in Texas. It was\r\nall fairly told to you, both beforehand and afterwards. You heard Moses\r\nand the prophets, but if one had risen from the dead, such was your\r\ndevotion to that policy, at that time, you would not have listened to\r\nhim for a moment. I do not, of course, speak of the persons now here\r\nbefore me, but of the general political tone in New York, and especially\r\nof those who are now Free Soil apostles. Well, all that I do not\r\ncomplain of; but I will not now, or hereafter, before the country, or\r\nthe world, consent to be numbered among those who introduced new slave\r\npower into the Union. I did all in my power to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThen, again, Gentlemen, the Mexican war broke out. Vast territory was\r\nacquired, and the peace was made; and, much as I disliked the war, I\r\ndisliked the peace more, because it brought in these territories. I\r\nwished for peace indeed, but I desired to strike out the grant of\r\nterritory on the one side, and the payment of the $12,000,000 on the\r\nother. That territory was unknown to me; I could not tell what its\r\ncharacter might be. The plan came from the South. I knew that certain\r\nSouthern gentlemen wished the acquisition of California, New Mexico, and\r\nUtah, as a means of extending slave power and slave population.\r\nForeseeing a sectional controversy, and, as I conceived, seeing how much\r\nit would distract the Union, I voted against the treaty with Mexico. I\r\nvoted against the acquisition. I wanted none of her territory, neither\r\nCalifornia, New Mexico, nor Utah. They were rather ultra-American, as I\r\nthought. They were far from us, and I saw that they might lead to a\r\npolitical conflict, and I voted against them all, against the treaty and\r\nagainst the peace, rather than have the territories. Seeing that it\r\nwould be an occasion of dispute, that by the controversy the whole Union\r\nwould be agitated, Messrs. Berrien, Badger, and other respectable and\r\ndistinguished men of the South, voted against the acquisition, and the\r\ntreaty which secured it; and if the men of the North had voted the same\r\nway, we should have been spared all the difficulties that have grown out\r\nof it. We should have had peace without the territories.\r\n\r\nNow there is no sort of doubt, Gentlemen, that there were some persons\r\nin the South who supposed that California, if it came into the Union at\r\nall, would come in as a slave State. You know the extraordinary events\r\nwhich immediately occurred, and the impulse given to emigration by the\r\ndiscovery of gold. You know that crowds of Northern people immediately\r\nrushed to California, and that an African slave could no more live there\r\namong them, than he could live on the top of Mount Hecla. Of necessity\r\nit became a free State, and that, no doubt, was a source of much\r\ndisappointment to the South. And then there were New Mexico and Utah;\r\nwhat was to be done with them? Why, Gentlemen, from the best\r\ninvestigation I had given to the subject, and the reflection I had\r\ndevoted to it, I was of the opinion that the mountains of New Mexico and\r\nUtah could no more sustain American slavery than the snows of Canada. I\r\nsaw it was impossible. I thought so then; it is quite evident now.\r\nTherefore, when it was proposed in Congress to apply the Wilmot Proviso\r\nto New Mexico and Utah, it appeared to me just as absurd as to apply it\r\nhere in Western New York. I saw that the snow-capped hills, the eternal\r\nmountains, and the climate of those countries would never support\r\nslavery. No man could carry a slave there with any expectation of\r\nprofit. It could not be done; and as the South regarded the Proviso as\r\nmerely a source of irritation, and as designed by some to irritate, I\r\nthought it unwise to apply it to New Mexico or Utah. I voted\r\naccordingly, and who doubts now the correctness of that vote? The law\r\nadmitting those territories passed without any proviso. Is there a\r\nslave, or will there ever be one, in either of those territories? Why,\r\nthere is not a man in the United States so stupid as not to see, at this\r\nmoment, that such a thing was wholly unnecessary, and that it was only\r\ncalculated to irritate and to offend. I am not one who is disposed to\r\ncreate irritation, or give offence among brethren, or to break up\r\nfraternal friendship, without cause. The question was accordingly left\r\nlegally open, whether slavery should or should not go to New Mexico or\r\nUtah. There is no slavery there, it is utterly impracticable that it\r\nshould be introduced into such a region, and utterly ridiculous to\r\nsuppose that it could exist there. No one, who does not mean to deceive,\r\nwill now pretend it can exist there.\r\n\r\nWell, Gentlemen, we have a race of agitators all over the country; some\r\nconnected with the press, some, I am sorry to say, belonging to the\r\nlearned professions. They agitate; their livelihood consists in\r\nagitating; their freehold, their copyhold, their capital, their all in\r\nall, depend on the excitement of the public mind. The events now briefly\r\nalluded to were going on at the commencement of the year 1850. There\r\nwere two great questions before the public. There was the question of\r\nthe Texan boundary, and of a government for Utah and New Mexico, which I\r\nconsider as one question; and there was the question of making a\r\nprovision for the restoration of fugitive slaves. On these subjects, I\r\nhave something to say. Texas, as you know, established her independence\r\nof Mexico by her revolution and the battle of San Jacinto, which made\r\nher a sovereign power. I have already stated to you what I then\r\nanticipated from the movement, namely, that she would ask to come into\r\nthe Union as a slave State. We admitted her in 1845, and we admitted her\r\nas a slave State. We admitted her also with an undefined boundary;\r\nremember that. She claimed by conquest the whole of that territory\r\ncommonly called New Mexico, east of the Rio Grande. She claimed also\r\nthose limits which her constitution had declared and marked out as the\r\nproper limits of Texas. This was her claim, and when she was admitted\r\ninto the United States, the United States did not define her territory.\r\nThey admitted her as she was. We took her as she defined her own limits,\r\nand with the power of making four additional slave States. I say \"we,\"\r\nbut I do not mean that I was one; I mean the United States admitted her.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the state of things in 1850? There was Texas claiming\r\nall, or a great part, of that which the United States had acquired from\r\nMexico as New Mexico. She claimed that it belonged to her by conquest\r\nand by her admission into the United States, and she was ready to\r\nmaintain her claim by force of arms. Nor was this all. A man must be\r\nignorant of the history of the country who does not know, that, at the\r\ncommencement of 1850, there was great agitation throughout the whole\r\nSouth. Who does not know that six or seven of the largest States of the\r\nSouth had already taken measures looking toward secession; were\r\npreparing for disunion in some way? They concurred apparently, at least\r\nsome of them, with Texas, while Texas was prepared or preparing to\r\nenforce her rights by force of arms. Troops were enlisted by her, and\r\nmany thousand persons in the South disaffected towards the Union, or\r\ndesirous of breaking it up, were ready to make common cause with Texas;\r\nto join her ranks, and see what they could make in a war to establish\r\nthe right of Texas to New Mexico. The public mind was disturbed. A\r\nconsiderable part of the South was disaffected towards the Union, and in\r\na condition to adopt any course that should be violent and destructive.\r\n\r\nWhat then was to be done, as far as Texas was concerned? Allow me to\r\nsay, Gentlemen, there are two sorts of foresight. There is a military\r\nforesight, which sees what will be the result of an appeal to arms; and\r\nthere is also a statesmanlike foresight, which looks not to the result\r\nof battles and carnage, but to the results of political disturbances,\r\nthe violence of faction carried into military operations, and the\r\nhorrors attendant on civil war. I never had a doubt, that, if the\r\nadministration of General Taylor had gone to war, and had sent troops\r\ninto New Mexico, the Texan forces would have been subdued in a week. The\r\npower on one side was far superior to all the power on the other. But\r\nwhat then? What if Texan troops, assisted by thousands of volunteers\r\nfrom the disaffected States, had gone to New Mexico, and had been\r\ndefeated and turned back? Would that have settled the boundary question?\r\nNow, Gentlemen, I wish I had ten thousand voices. I wish I could draw\r\naround me the whole people of the United States, and I wish I could make\r\nthem all hear what I now declare on my conscience as my solemn belief,\r\nbefore the Power who sits on high, and who will judge you and me\r\nhereafter, that, if this Texan controversy had not been settled by\r\nCongress in the manner it was, by the so-called adjustment measures,\r\ncivil war would have ensued; blood, American blood, would have been\r\nshed; and who can tell what would have been the consequences? Gentlemen,\r\nin an honorable war, if a foreign foe invade us, if our rights are\r\nthreatened, if it be necessary to defend them by arms, I am not afraid\r\nof blood. And if I am too old myself, I hope there are those connected\r\nwith me by ties of relationship who are young, and willing to defend\r\ntheir country to the last drop of their blood. But I cannot express the\r\nhorror I feel at the shedding of blood in a controversy between one of\r\nthese States and the government of the United States, because I see in\r\nit a total and entire disruption of all those ties that make us a great\r\nand happy people. Gentlemen, this was the great question, the leading\r\nquestion, at the commencement of the year 1850.\r\n\r\nThen there was the other matter, and that was the Fugitive Slave Law.\r\nLet me say a word about that. Under the provisions of the Constitution,\r\nduring Washington's administration, in the year 1793, there was passed,\r\nby general consent, a law for the restoration of fugitive slaves. Hardly\r\nany one opposed it at that period; it was thought to be necessary, in\r\norder to carry the Constitution into effect; the great men of New\r\nEngland and New York all concurred in it. It passed, and answered all\r\nthe purposes expected from it, till about the year 1841 or 1842, when\r\nthe States interfered to make enactments in opposition to it. The act of\r\nCongress said that State magistrates might execute the duties of the\r\nlaw. Some of the States passed enactments imposing a penalty on any\r\nState officers who exercised authority under the law, or assisted in its\r\nexecution; others denied the use of their jails to carry the law into\r\neffect; and, in general, at the commencement of the year 1850, it had\r\nbecome absolutely indispensable that Congress should pass some law for\r\nthe execution of this provision of the Constitution, or else give up\r\nthat provision entirely. That was the question. I was in Congress when\r\nit was brought forward. I was for a proper law. I had, indeed, proposed\r\na different law; I was of opinion that a summary trial by a jury might\r\nbe had, which would satisfy the people of the North, and produce no harm\r\nto those who claimed the service of fugitives; but I left the Senate,\r\nand went to another station, before any law was passed. The law of 1850\r\npassed. Now I undertake, as a lawyer, and on my professional character,\r\nto say to you, and to all, that the law of 1850 is decidedly more\r\nfavorable to the fugitive than General Washington's law of 1793; and I\r\nwill tell you why. In the first place, the present law places the power\r\nin much higher hands; in the hands of independent judges of the Supreme\r\nand Circuit Courts, and District Courts, and of commissioners who are\r\nappointed to office for their legal learning. Every fugitive is brought\r\nbefore a tribunal of high character, of eminent ability, of respectable\r\nstation. In the second place, when a claimant comes from Virginia to New\r\nYork, to say that one A or one B has run away, or is a fugitive from\r\nservice or labor, he brings with him a record of the court of the county\r\nfrom which he comes, and that record must be sworn to before a\r\nmagistrate, and certified by the county clerk, and bear an official\r\nseal. The affidavit must state that A or B had departed under such and\r\nsuch circumstances, and had gone to another State; and that record under\r\nseal is, by the Constitution of the United States, entitled to full\r\ncredit in every State. Well, the claimant or his agent comes here, and\r\nhe presents to you the seal of the court in Virginia, affixed to a\r\nrecord of his declaration, that A or B had escaped from service. He must\r\nthen prove that the fugitive is here. He brings a witness; he is asked\r\nif this is the man, and he proves it; or, in nine cases out of ten, the\r\nfact would be admitted by the fugitive himself.\r\n\r\nSuch is the present law; and, much opposed and maligned as it is, it is\r\nmore favorable to the fugitive slave than the law enacted during\r\nWashington's administration, in 1793, which was sanctioned by the North\r\nas well as by the South. The present violent opposition has sprung up in\r\nmodern times. From whom does this clamor come? Why, look at the\r\nproceedings of the antislavery conventions; look at their resolutions.\r\nDo you find among those persons who oppose this Fugitive Slave Law any\r\nadmission whatever, that any law ought to be passed to carry into effect\r\nthe solemn stipulations of the Constitution? Tell me any such case; tell\r\nme if any resolution was adopted by the convention at Syracuse favorable\r\nto the carrying out of the Constitution. Not one! The fact is,\r\nGentlemen, they oppose the constitutional provision; they oppose the\r\nwhole! Not a man of them admits that there ought to be any law on the\r\nsubject. They deny, altogether, that the provisions of the Constitution\r\nought to be carried into effect. Look at the proceedings of the\r\nantislavery conventions in Ohio, Massachusetts, and at Syracuse, in the\r\nState of New York. What do they say? \"That, so help them God, no colored\r\nman shall be sent from the State of New York back to his master in\r\nVirginia!\" Do not they say that? And, to the fulfilment of that they\r\n\"pledge their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.\" Their\r\nsacred honor! They pledge their sacred honor to violate the\r\nConstitution; they pledge their sacred honor to commit treason against\r\nthe laws of their country!\r\n\r\nI have already stated, Gentlemen, what your observation of these things\r\nmust have taught you. I will only recur to the subject for a moment, for\r\nthe purpose of persuading you, as public men and private men, as good\r\nmen and patriotic men, that you ought, to the extent of your ability and\r\ninfluence, to see to it that such laws are established and maintained as\r\nshall keep you, and the South, and the West, and all the country,\r\ntogether, on the terms of the Constitution. I say, that what is demanded\r\nof us is to fulfil our constitutional duties, and to do for the South\r\nwhat the South has a right to demand.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I have been some time before the public. My character is\r\nknown, my life is before the country. I profess to love liberty as much\r\nas any man living; but I profess to love American liberty, that liberty\r\nwhich is secured to the country by the government under which we live;\r\nand I have no great opinion of that other and higher liberty which\r\ndisregards the restraints of law and of the Constitution. I hold the\r\nConstitution of the United States to be the bulwark, the only bulwark,\r\nof our liberties and of our national character, I do not mean that you\r\nshould become slaves under the Constitution. That is not American\r\nliberty. That is not the liberty of the Union for which our fathers\r\nfought, that liberty which has given us a right to be known and\r\nrespected all over the world. I mean only to say, that I am for\r\nconstitutional liberty. It is enough for me to be as free as the\r\nConstitution of the country makes me.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, let me say, that, as much as I respect the character of\r\nthe people of Western New York, as much as I wish to retain their good\r\nopinion, if I should ever hereafter be placed in any situation in public\r\nlife, let me tell you now that you must not expect from me the slightest\r\nvariation, even of a hair's breadth, from the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. I am a Northern man. I was born at the North, educated at the\r\nNorth, have lived all my days at the North. I know five hundred Northern\r\nmen to one Southern man. My sympathies, all my sympathies, my love of\r\nliberty for all mankind, of every color, are the same as yours. My\r\naffections and hopes in that respect are exactly like yours. I wish to\r\nsee all men free, all men happy. I have few personal associations out of\r\nthe Northern States. My people are your people. And yet I am told\r\nsometimes that I am not a friend of liberty, because I am not a Free\r\nSoil man. What am I? What was I ever? What shall I be hereafter, if I\r\ncould sacrifice, for any consideration, that love of American liberty\r\nwhich has glowed in my breast since my infancy, and which, I hope, will\r\nnever leave me till I expire?\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I regret that slavery exists in the Southern States; but it\r\nis clear and certain that Congress has no power over it. It may be,\r\nhowever, that, in the dispensations of Providence, some remedy for this\r\nevil may occur, or may be hoped for hereafter. But, in the mean time, I\r\nhold to the Constitution of the United States, and you need never expect\r\nfrom me, under any circumstances, that I shall falter from it; that I\r\nshall be otherwise than frank and decisive. I would not part with my\r\ncharacter as a man of firmness and decision, and honor and principle,\r\nfor all that the world possesses. You will find me true to the North,\r\nbecause all my sympathies are with the North. My affections, my\r\nchildren, my hopes, my everything, are with the North. But when I stand\r\nup before my country, as one appointed to administer the Constitution of\r\nthe country, by the blessing of God I will be just.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I expect to be libelled and abused. Yes, libelled and abused.\r\nBut it does not disturb me. I have not lost a night's rest for a great\r\nmany years from any such cause. I have some talent for sleeping. And why\r\nshould I not expect to be libelled? Is not the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States libelled and abused? Do not some people call it a covenant\r\nwith hell? Is not Washington libelled and abused? Is he not called a\r\nbloodhound on the track of the African negro? Are not our fathers\r\nlibelled and abused by their own children? And ungrateful children they\r\nare. How, then, shall I escape? I do not expect to escape; but, knowing\r\nthese things, I impute no bad motive to any men of character and fair\r\nstanding. The great settlement measures of the last Congress are laws.\r\nMany respectable men, representatives from your own State and from other\r\nStates, did not concur in them. I do not impute any bad motive to them.\r\nI am ready to believe they are Americans all. They may not have thought\r\nthese laws necessary; or they may have thought that they would be\r\nenacted without their concurrence. Let all that pass away. If they are\r\nnow men who will stand by what is done, and stand up for their country,\r\nand say that, as these laws were passed by a majority of the whole\r\ncountry, we must stand by them and live by them, I will respect them all\r\nas friends.\r\n\r\nNow, Gentlemen, allow me to ask of you, What do you think would have\r\nbeen the condition of the country, at this time, if these laws had not\r\nbeen passed by the last Congress? if the question of the Texas boundary\r\nhad not been settled? if New Mexico and Utah had been left as\r\ndesert-places, and no government had been provided for them? And if the\r\nother great object to which State laws had opposed so many obstacles,\r\nthe restoration of fugitives, had not been provided for, I ask, what\r\nwould have been the state of this country now? You men of Erie County,\r\nyou men of New York, I conjure you to go home to-night and meditate on\r\nthis subject. What would have been the state of this country, now, at\r\nthis moment, if these laws had not been passed? I have given my opinion\r\nthat we should have had a civil war. I refer it to you, therefore, for\r\nyour consideration; meditate on it; do not be carried away by any\r\nabstract notions or metaphysical ideas; think practically on the great\r\nquestion, What would have been the condition of the United States at\r\nthis moment, if we had not settled these agitating questions? I repeat,\r\nin my opinion, there would have been a civil war.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, will you allow me, for a moment, to advert to myself? I have\r\nbeen a long time in public life; of course, not many years remain to me.\r\nAt the commencement of 1850, I looked anxiously at the condition of the\r\ncountry, and I thought the inevitable consequence of leaving the\r\nexisting controversies unadjusted would be civil war. I saw danger in\r\nleaving Utah and New Mexico without any government, a prey to the power\r\nof Texas. I saw the condition of things arising from the interference of\r\nsome of the States in defeating the operation of the Constitution in\r\nrespect to the restoration of fugitive slaves. I saw these things, and I\r\nmade up my mind to encounter whatever might betide me in the attempt to\r\navert the impending catastrophe. And allow me to add something which is\r\nnot entirely unworthy of notice. A member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives told me that he had prepared a list of one hundred and\r\nforty speeches which had been made in Congress on the slavery question.\r\n\"That is a very large number, my friend,\" I said; \"but how is that?\"\r\n\"Why,\" said he, \"a Northern man gets up and speaks with considerable\r\npower and fluency until the Speaker's hammer knocks him down. Then gets\r\nup a Southern man, and he speaks with more warmth. He is nearer the sun,\r\nand he comes out with the greater fervor against the North. He speaks\r\nhis hour, and is in turn knocked down. And so it has gone on, until I\r\nhave got one hundred and forty speeches on my list.\" \"Well,\" said I,\r\n\"where are they, and what are they?\" \"If the speaker,\" said he, \"was a\r\nNorthern man, he held forth against slavery; and if he was from the\r\nSouth, he abused the North; and all these speeches were sent by the\r\nmembers to their own localities, where they served only to aggravate the\r\nlocal irritation already existing. No man reads both sides. The other\r\nside of the argument is not heard; and the speeches sent from Washington\r\nin such prodigious numbers, instead of tending to conciliation, do but\r\nincrease, in both sections of the Union, an excitement already of the\r\nmost dangerous character.\"\r\n\r\nGentlemen, in this state of things, I saw that something must be done.\r\nIt was impossible to look with indifference on a danger of so formidable\r\na character. I am a Massachusetts man, and I bore in mind what\r\nMassachusetts has ever been to the Constitution and the Union. I felt\r\nthe importance of the duty which devolved upon one to whom she had so\r\nlong confided the trust of representing her in either house of Congress.\r\nAs I honored her, and respected her, I felt that I was serving her in my\r\nendeavors to promote the welfare of the whole country.\r\n\r\nAnd now suppose, Gentlemen, that, on the occasion in question, I had\r\ntaken a different course. If I may allude so particularly to an\r\nindividual so insignificant as myself, suppose that, on the 7th of\r\nMarch, 1850, instead of making a speech that would, so far as my power\r\nwent, reconcile the country, I had joined in the general clamor of the\r\nAntislavery party. Suppose I had said, \"I will have nothing to do with\r\nany accommodation; we will admit no compromise; we will let Texas invade\r\nNew Mexico; we will leave New Mexico and Utah to take care of\r\nthemselves; we will plant ourselves on the Wilmot Proviso, let the\r\nconsequences be what they may.\" Now, Gentlemen, I do not mean to say\r\nthat great consequences would have followed from such a course on my\r\npart; but suppose I had taken such a course. How could I be blamed for\r\nit? Was I not a Northern man? Did I not know Massachusetts feelings and\r\nprejudices? But what of that? I am an American. I was made a whole man,\r\nand I did not mean to make myself half a one. I felt that I had a duty\r\nto perform to my country, to my own reputation; for I flattered myself\r\nthat a service of forty years had given me some character, on which I\r\nhad a right to repose for my justification in the performance of a duty\r\nattended with some degree of local unpopularity. I thought it my duty to\r\npursue this course, and I did not care what was to be the consequence. I\r\nfelt it was my duty, in a very alarming crisis, to come out; to go for\r\nmy country, and my whole country; and to exert any power I had to keep\r\nthat country together. I cared for nothing, I was afraid of nothing, but\r\nI meant to do my duty. Duty performed makes a man happy; duty neglected\r\nmakes a man unhappy. I therefore, in the face of all discouragements and\r\nall dangers, was ready to go forth and do what I thought my country,\r\nyour country, demanded of me. And, Gentlemen, allow me to say here\r\nto-day, that if the fate of John Rogers had stared me in the face, if I\r\nhad seen the stake, if I had heard the fagots already crackling, by the\r\nblessing of Almighty God I would have gone on and discharged the duty\r\nwhich I thought my country called upon me to perform. I would have\r\nbecome a martyr to save that country.\r\n\r\nAnd now, Gentlemen, farewell. Live and be happy. Live like patriots,\r\nlive like Americans. Live in the enjoyment of the inestimable blessings\r\nwhich your fathers prepared for you; and if any thing that I may do\r\nhereafter should be inconsistent, in the slightest degree, with the\r\nopinions and principles which I have this day submitted to you, then\r\ndiscard me for ever from your recollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADDITION TO THE CAPITOL.\r\n\r\nAN ADDRESS DELIVERED AT THE LAYING OF THE CORNER-STONE OF THE ADDITION\r\nTO THE CAPITOL, ON THE 4th OF JULY, 1851.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFellow-Citizens,--I greet you well; I give you joy, on the return of\r\nthis anniversary; and I felicitate you, also, on the more particular\r\npurpose of which this ever-memorable day has been chosen to witness the\r\nfulfilment. Hail! all hail! I see before and around me a mass of faces,\r\nglowing with cheerfulness and patriotic pride. I see thousands of eyes\r\nturned towards other eyes, all sparkling with gratification and delight.\r\nThis is the New World! This is America! This is Washington! and this the\r\nCapitol of the United States! And where else, among the nations, can the\r\nseat of government be surrounded, on any day of any year, by those who\r\nhave more reason to rejoice in the blessings which they possess?\r\nNowhere, fellow-citizens! assuredly, nowhere! Let us, then, meet this\r\nrising sun with joy and thanksgiving!\r\n\r\nThis is that day of the year which announced to mankind the great fact\r\nof American Independence. This fresh and brilliant morning blesses our\r\nvision with another beholding of the birthday of our nation; and we see\r\nthat nation, of recent origin, now among the most considerable and\r\npowerful, and spreading over the continent from sea to sea.\r\n\r\nAmong the first colonists from Europe to this part of America, there\r\nwere some, doubtless, who contemplated the distant consequences of their\r\nundertaking, and who saw a great futurity. But, in general, their hopes\r\nwere limited to the enjoyment of a safe asylum from tyranny, religious\r\nand civil, and to respectable subsistence, by industry and toil. A thick\r\nveil hid our times from their view. But the progress of America, however\r\nslow, could not but at length awaken genius, and attract the attention\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the second century of our history, Bishop Berkeley,\r\nwho, it will be remembered, had resided for some time in Newport, in\r\nRhode Island, wrote his well-known \"Verses on the Prospect of Planting\r\nARTS and LEARNING in AMERICA.\" The last stanza of this little poem seems\r\nto have been produced by a high poetical inspiration:--\r\n\r\n    \"Westward the course of empire takes its way;\r\n      The four first acts already past,\r\n    A fifth shall close the drama with the day:\r\n      Time's noblest offspring is the last.\"\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary prophecy may be considered only as the result of long\r\nforesight and uncommon sagacity; of a foresight and sagacity stimulated,\r\nnevertheless, by excited feeling and high enthusiasm. So clear a vision\r\nof what America would become was not founded on square miles, or on\r\nexisting numbers, or on any common laws of statistics. It was an\r\nintuitive glance into futurity; it was a grand conception, strong,\r\nardent, glowing, embracing all time since the creation of the world,\r\nand all regions of which that world is composed, and judging of the\r\nfuture by just analogy with the past. And the inimitable imagery and\r\nbeauty with which the thought is expressed, joined to the conception\r\nitself, render it one of the most striking passages in our language.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the Declaration of Independence our illustrious fathers\r\nperformed the first scene in the last great act of this drama; one in\r\nreal importance infinitely exceeding that for which the great English\r\npoet invokes\r\n\r\n              \"A muse of fire, ...\r\n    A kingdom for a stage, princes to act,\r\n    And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!\"\r\n\r\nThe Muse inspiring our fathers was the Genius of Liberty, all on fire\r\nwith a sense of oppression, and a resolution to throw it off; the whole\r\nworld was the stage, and higher characters than princes trod it; and,\r\ninstead of monarchs, countries and nations and the age beheld the\r\nswelling scene. How well the characters were cast, and how well each\r\nacted his part, and what emotions the whole performance excited, let\r\nhistory, now and hereafter, tell.\r\n\r\nAt a subsequent period, but before the Declaration of Independence, the\r\nBishop of St. Asaph published a discourse, in which the following\r\nremarkable passages are found:--\r\n\r\n     \"It is difficult for man to look into the destiny of future ages;\r\n     the designs of Providence are vast and complicated, and our own\r\n     powers are too narrow to admit of much satisfaction to our\r\n     curiosity. But when we see many great and powerful causes\r\n     constantly at work, we cannot doubt of their producing\r\n     proportionable effects.\r\n\r\n     \"The colonies in North America have not only taken root and\r\n     acquired strength, _but seem hastening with an accelerated progress\r\n     to such a powerful state as may introduce a new and important\r\n     change in human affairs_.\r\n\r\n     \"Descended from ancestors of the most improved and enlightened part\r\n     of the Old World, they receive, as it were by inheritance, all the\r\n     improvements and discoveries of their mother country. And it\r\n     happens fortunately for them to commence their flourishing state at\r\n     a time when the human understanding has attained to the free use of\r\n     its powers, and has learned to act with vigor and certainty. They\r\n     may avail themselves, not only of the experience and industry, but\r\n     even of the errors and mistakes, of former days. Let it be\r\n     considered for how many ages a great part of the world appears not\r\n     to have thought at all; how many more they have been busied in\r\n     forming systems and conjectures, while reason has been lost in a\r\n     labyrinth of words, and they never seem to have suspected on what\r\n     frivolous matters their minds were employed.\r\n\r\n     \"And let it be well understood what rapid improvements, what\r\n     important discoveries, have been made, in a few years, by a few\r\n     countries, with our own at their head, which have at last\r\n     discovered the right method of using their faculties.\r\n\r\n     \"May we not reasonably expect that a number of provinces possessed\r\n     of these advantages and quickened by mutual emulation, with only\r\n     the common progress of the human mind, should very considerably\r\n     enlarge the boundaries of science?\r\n\r\n     \"The vast continent itself, over which they are gradually\r\n     spreading, may be considered as a treasure yet untouched of natural\r\n     productions that shall hereafter afford ample matter for commerce\r\n     and contemplation. And if we reflect what a stock of knowledge may\r\n     be accumulated by the constant progress of industry and\r\n     observation, fed with fresh supplies from the stores of nature,\r\n     assisted sometimes by those happy strokes of chance which mock all\r\n     the powers of invention, and sometimes by those superior characters\r\n     which arise occasionally to instruct and enlighten the world, it is\r\n     difficult even to imagine to what height of improvement their\r\n     discoveries may extend.\r\n\r\n     \"_And perhaps they may make as considerable advances in the arts of\r\n     civil government and the conduct of life._ We have reason to be\r\n     proud, and even jealous, of our excellent constitution; but those\r\n     equitable principles on which it was formed, an equal\r\n     representation (the best discovery of political wisdom), and a just\r\n     and commodious distribution of power, which with us were the price\r\n     of civil wars, and the rewards of the virtues and sufferings of our\r\n     ancestors, descend to them as a natural inheritance, without toil\r\n     or pain.\r\n\r\n     \"_But must they rest here, as in the utmost effort of human genius?\r\n     Can chance and time, the wisdom and the experience of public men,\r\n     suggest no new remedy aqainst the evils_ which vices and ambition\r\n     are perpetually apt to cause? May they not hope, without\r\n     presumption, to preserve a greater zeal for piety and public\r\n     devotion than we have alone? For sure it can hardly happen to them,\r\n     as it has to us, that, when religion is best understood and\r\n     rendered most pure and reasonable, then should be the precise time\r\n     when many cease to believe and practise it, and all in general\r\n     become most indifferent to it.\r\n\r\n     \"May they not possibly be more successful than their mother country\r\n     has been in preserving that reverence and authority which are due\r\n     to the laws? to those who make, and to those who execute them? _May\r\n     not a method be invented of procuring some tolerable share of the\r\n     comforts of life to those inferior useful ranks of men to whose\r\n     industry we are indebted for the whole? Time and discipline may\r\n     discover some means to correct the extreme inequalities of\r\n     condition between the rich and the poor, so dangerous to the\r\n     innocence and happiness of both._ They may fortunately be led by\r\n     habit and choice to despise that luxury which is considered with us\r\n     the true enjoyment of wealth. They may have little relish for that\r\n     ceaseless hurry of amusements which is pursued in this country\r\n     without pleasure, exercise, or employment. And perhaps, after\r\n     trying some of our follies and caprices, and rejecting the rest,\r\n     they may be led by reason and experiment to that old simplicity\r\n     which was first pointed out by nature, and has produced those\r\n     models which we still admire in arts, eloquence, and manners. _The\r\n     diversity of new scenes and situations, which so many growing\r\n     states must necessarily pass through, may introduce changes in the\r\n     fluctuating opinions and manners of men which we can form no\r\n     conception of_; and not only the gracious disposition of\r\n     Providence, but the visible preparation of causes, seems to\r\n     indicate strong tendencies towards a general improvement.\"\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, this \"gracious disposition of Providence,\" and this\r\n\"visible preparation of causes,\" at length brought on the hour for\r\ndecisive action. On the 4th of July, 1776, the Representatives of the\r\nUnited States of America, in Congress assembled, declared that these\r\nUnited Colonies are, and of right ought to be, FREE AND INDEPENDENT\r\nSTATES.\r\n\r\nThis Declaration, made by most patriotic and resolute men, trusting in\r\nthe justice of their cause and the protection of Heaven, and yet made\r\nnot without deep solicitude and anxiety, has now stood for seventy-five\r\nyears, and still stands. It was sealed in blood. It has met dangers, and\r\novercome them; it has had enemies, and conquered them; it has had\r\ndetractors, and abashed them all; it has had doubting friends, but it\r\nhas cleared all doubts away; and now, to-day, raising its august form\r\nhigher than the clouds, twenty millions of people contemplate it with\r\nhallowed love, and the world beholds it, and the consequences which have\r\nfollowed from it, with profound admiration.\r\n\r\nThis anniversary animates and gladdens and unites all American hearts.\r\nOn other days of the year we may be party men, indulging in\r\ncontroversies, more or less important to the public good; we may have\r\nlikes and dislikes, and we may maintain our political differences, often\r\nwith warm, and sometimes with angry feelings. But to-day we are\r\nAmericans all; and all nothing but Americans. As the great luminary over\r\nour heads, dissipating mists and fogs, now cheers the whole hemisphere,\r\nso do the associations connected with this day disperse all cloudy and\r\nsullen weather in the minds and hearts of true Americans. Every man's\r\nheart swells within him; every man's port and bearing become somewhat\r\nmore proud and lofty, as he remembers that seventy-five years have\r\nrolled away, and that the great inheritance of liberty is still his;\r\nhis, undiminished and unimpaired; his in all its original glory; his to\r\nenjoy, his to protect, and his to transmit to future generations.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, this inheritance which we enjoy to-day is not only an\r\ninheritance of liberty, but of our own peculiar American liberty.\r\nLiberty has existed in other times, in other countries, and in other\r\nforms. There has been a Grecian liberty, bold and powerful, full of\r\nspirit, eloquence, and fire; a liberty which produced multitudes of\r\ngreat men, and has transmitted one immortal name, the name of\r\nDemosthenes, to posterity. But still it was a liberty of disconnected\r\nstates, sometimes united, indeed, by temporary leagues and\r\nconfederacies, but often involved in wars between themselves. The sword\r\nof Sparta turned its sharpest edge against Athens, enslaved her, and\r\ndevastated Greece; and, in her turn, Sparta was compelled to bend before\r\nthe power of Thebes. And let it ever be remembered, especially let the\r\ntruth sink deep into all American minds, that it was the WANT OF UNION\r\namong her several states which finally gave the mastery of all Greece to\r\nPhilip of Macedon.\r\n\r\nAnd there has also been a Roman liberty, a proud, ambitious, domineering\r\nspirit, professing free and popular principles in Rome itself, but, even\r\nin the best days of the republic, ready to carry slavery and chains into\r\nher provinces, and through every country over which her eagles could be\r\nborne. What was the liberty of Spain, or Gaul, or Germany, or Britain,\r\nin the days of Rome? Did true constitutional liberty then exist? As the\r\nRoman empire declined, her provinces, not instructed in the principles\r\nof free popular government, one after another declined also, and when\r\nRome herself fell, in the end, all fell together.\r\n\r\nI have said, Gentlemen, that our inheritance is an inheritance of\r\nAmerican liberty. That liberty is characteristic, peculiar, and\r\naltogether our own. Nothing like it existed in former times, nor was\r\nknown in the most enlightened states of antiquity; while with us its\r\nprinciples have become interwoven into the minds of individual men,\r\nconnected with our daily opinions, and our daily habits, until it is, if\r\nI may so say, an element of social as well as of political life; and the\r\nconsequence is, that to whatever region an American citizen carries\r\nhimself, he takes with him, fully developed in his own understanding and\r\nexperience, our American principles and opinions, and becomes ready at\r\nonce, in co-operation with others, to apply them to the formation of new\r\ngovernments. Of this a most wonderful instance may be seen in the\r\nhistory of the State of California.\r\n\r\nOn a former occasion I ventured to remark, that \"it is very difficult to\r\nestablish a free conservative government for the equal advancement of\r\nall the interests of society. What has Germany done, learned Germany,\r\nmore full of ancient lore than all the world beside? What has Italy\r\ndone? What have they done who dwell on the spot where Cicero lived? They\r\nhave not the power of self-government which a common town-meeting, with\r\nus, possesses.... Yes, I say that those persons who have gone from our\r\ntown-meetings to dig gold in California are more fit to make a\r\nrepublican government than any body of men in Germany or Italy; because\r\nthey have learned this one great lesson, that there is no security\r\nwithout law, and that, under the circumstances in which they are placed,\r\nwhere there is no military authority to cut their throats, there is no\r\nsovereign will but the will of the majority; that, therefore, if they\r\nremain, they must submit to that will.\" And this I believe to be\r\nstrictly true.\r\n\r\nNow, fellow-citizens, if your patience will hold out, I will venture,\r\nbefore proceeding to the more appropriate and particular duties of the\r\nday, to state, in a few words, what I take these American political\r\nprinciples in substance to be. They consist, as I think, in the first\r\nplace, in the establishment of popular governments, on the basis of\r\nrepresentation; for it is plain that a pure democracy, like that which\r\nexisted in some of the states of Greece, in which every individual had a\r\ndirect vote in the enactment of all laws, cannot possibly exist in a\r\ncountry of wide extent. This representation is to be made as equal as\r\ncircumstances will allow. Now, this principle of popular representation,\r\nprevailing either in all the branches of government, or in some of them,\r\nhas existed in these States almost from the days of the settlements at\r\nJamestown and Plymouth; borrowed, no doubt, from the example of the\r\npopular branch of the British legislature. The representation of the\r\npeople in the British House of Commons was, however, originally very\r\nunequal, and is yet not equal. Indeed, it may be doubted whether the\r\nappearance of knights and burgesses, assembling on the summons of the\r\ncrown, was not intended at first as an assistance and support to the\r\nroyal prerogative, in matters of revenue and taxation, rather than as a\r\nmode of ascertaining popular opinion. Nevertheless, representation had a\r\npopular origin, and savored more and more of the character of that\r\norigin, as it acquired, by slow degrees, greater and greater strength,\r\nin the actual government of the country. The constitution of the House\r\nof Commons was certainly a form of representation, however unequal;\r\nnumbers were counted, and majorities prevailed; and when our ancestors,\r\nacting upon this example, introduced more equality of representation,\r\nthe idea assumed a more rational and distinct shape. At any rate, this\r\nmanner of exercising popular power was familiar to our fathers when they\r\nsettled on this continent. They adopted it, and generation has risen up\r\nafter generation, all acknowledging it, and all learning its practice\r\nand its forms.\r\n\r\nThe next fundamental principle in our system is, that the will of the\r\nmajority, fairly expressed through the means of representation, shall\r\nhave the force of law; and it is quite evident that, in a country\r\nwithout thrones or aristocracies or privileged castes or classes, there\r\ncan be no other foundation for law to stand upon.\r\n\r\nAnd, as the necessary result of this, the third element is, that the law\r\nis the supreme rule for the government of all. The great sentiment of\r\nAlcaeus, so beautifully presented to us by Sir William Jones, is\r\nabsolutely indispensable to the construction and maintenance of our\r\npolitical systems:--\r\n\r\n    \"What constitutes a state?\r\n    Not high-raised battlement or labored mound,\r\n    Thick wall or moated gate;\r\n    Not cities proud, with spires and turrets crowned;\r\n    Not bays and broad-armed ports,\r\n    Where, laughing at the storm, rich navies ride;\r\n    Not starred and spangled courts,\r\n    Where low-browed baseness wafts perfume to pride.\r\n    No: MEN, high-minded MEN,\r\n    With powers as far above dull brutes endued,\r\n    In forest, brake, or den,\r\n    As beasts excel cold rocks and brambles rude:\r\n    Men who their duties know,\r\n    But know their rights, and, knowing, dare maintain;\r\n    Prevent the long-aimed blow,\r\n    And crush the tyrant while they rend the chain:\r\n    These constitute a state;\r\n    And SOVEREIGN LAW, that state's collected will,\r\n    O'er thrones and globes elate\r\n    Sits empress, crowning good, repressing ill.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, another most important part of the great fabric of\r\nAmerican liberty is, that there shall be written constitutions, founded\r\non the immediate authority of the people themselves, and regulating and\r\nrestraining all the powers conferred upon government, whether\r\nlegislative, executive, or judicial.\r\n\r\nThis, fellow-citizens, I suppose to be a just summary of our American\r\nprinciples, and I have on this occasion sought to express them in the\r\nplainest and in the fewest words. The summary may not be entirely exact,\r\nbut I hope it may be sufficiently so to make manifest to the rising\r\ngeneration among ourselves, and to those elsewhere who may choose to\r\ninquire into the nature of our political institutions, the general\r\ntheory upon which they are founded.\r\n\r\nAnd I now proceed to add, that the strong and deep-settled conviction of\r\nall intelligent persons amongst us is, that, in order to support a\r\nuseful and wise government upon these popular principles, the general\r\neducation of the people, and the wide diffusion of pure morality and\r\ntrue religion, are indispensable. Individual virtue is a part of public\r\nvirtue. It is difficult to conceive how there can remain morality in the\r\ngovernment when it shall cease to exist among the people; or how the\r\naggregate of the political institutions, all the organs of which consist\r\nonly of men, should be wise, and beneficent, and competent to inspire\r\nconfidence, if the opposite qualities belong to the individuals who\r\nconstitute those organs, and make up that aggregate.\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, I take leave of this part of the duty which I\r\nproposed to perform; and, once more felicitating you and myself that\r\nour eyes have seen the light of this blessed morning, and that our ears\r\nhave heard the shouts with which joyous thousands welcome its return,\r\nand joining with you in the hope that every revolving year may renew\r\nthese rejoicings to the end of time, I proceed to address you, shortly,\r\nupon the particular occasion of our assembling here to-day.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, by the act of Congress of the 30th of September, 1850,\r\nprovision was made for the extension of the Capitol, according to such\r\nplan as might be approved by the President of the United States, and for\r\nthe necessary sums to be expended, under his direction, by such\r\narchitect as he might appoint. This measure was imperatively demanded,\r\nfor the use of the legislative and judiciary departments, the public\r\nlibraries, the occasional accommodation of the chief executive\r\nmagistrate, and for other objects. No act of Congress incurring a large\r\nexpenditure has received more general approbation from the people. The\r\nPresident has proceeded to execute this law. He has approved a plan; he\r\nhas appointed an architect; and all things are now ready for the\r\ncommencement of the work.\r\n\r\nThe anniversary of national independence appeared to afford an\r\nauspicious occasion for laying the foundation-stone of the additional\r\nbuilding. That ceremony has now been performed by the President himself,\r\nin the presence and view of this multitude. He has thought that the day\r\nand the occasion made a united and imperative call for some short\r\naddress to the people here assembled; and it is at his request that I\r\nhave appeared before you to perform that part of the duty which was\r\ndeemed incumbent on us.\r\n\r\nBeneath the stone is deposited, among other things, a list of which will\r\nbe published, the following brief account of the proceedings of this\r\nday, in my handwriting:--\r\n\r\n     \"On the morning of the first day of the seventy-sixth year of the\r\n     Independence of the United States of America, in the city of\r\n     Washington, being the 4th day of July, 1851, this stone, designed\r\n     as the corner-stone of the extension of the Capitol, according to a\r\n     plan approved by the President, in pursuance of an act of Congress,\r\n     was laid by\r\n\r\n     \"MILLARD FILLMORE,\r\n\r\n     \"PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\n\r\n     \"assisted by the Grand Master of the Masonic Lodges, in the presence\r\n     of many members of Congress, of officers of the Executive and\r\n     Judiciary Departments, National, State, and District, of officers\r\n     of the army and navy, the corporate authorities of this and\r\n     neighboring cities, many associations, civil and military and\r\n     masonic, members of the Smithsonian Institution and National\r\n     Institute, professors of colleges and teachers of schools of the\r\n     District, with their students and pupils, and a vast concourse of\r\n     people from places near and remote, including a few surviving\r\n     gentlemen who witnessed the laying of the corner-stone of the\r\n     Capitol by President Washington, on the 18th day of September, A.D.\r\n     1793.\r\n\r\n     \"If, therefore, it shall be hereafter the will of God that this\r\n     structure shall fall from its base, that its foundation be\r\n     upturned, and this deposit brought to the eyes of men, be it then\r\n     known, that on this day the Union of the United States of America\r\n     stands firm, that their Constitution still exists unimpaired, and\r\n     with all its original usefulness and glory; growing every day\r\n     stronger and stronger in the affections of the great body of the\r\n     American people, and attracting more and more the admiration of the\r\n     world. And all here assembled, whether belonging to public life or\r\n     to private life, with hearts devoutly thankful to Almighty God for\r\n     the preservation of the liberty and happiness of the country, unite\r\n     in sincere and fervent prayers that this deposit, and the walls and\r\n     arches, the domes and towers, the columns and entablatures, now to\r\n     be erected over it, may endure for ever!\r\n\r\n     \"GOD SAVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!\r\n\r\n     \"DANIEL WEBSTER,\r\n\r\n     \"_Secretary of State of the United States_.\"\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, fifty-eight years ago Washington stood on this spot to\r\nexecute a duty like that which has now been performed. He then laid the\r\ncorner-stone of the original Capitol. He was at the head of the\r\ngovernment, at that time weak in resources, burdened with debt, just\r\nstruggling into political existence and respectability, and agitated by\r\nthe heaving waves which were overturning European thrones. But even\r\nthen, in many important respects, the government was strong. It was\r\nstrong in Washington's own great character; it was strong in the wisdom\r\nand patriotism of other eminent public men, his political associates and\r\nfellow-laborers; and it was strong in the affections of the people.\r\nSince that time astonishing changes have been wrought in the condition\r\nand prospects of the American people; and a degree of progress witnessed\r\nwith which the world can furnish no parallel. As we review the course of\r\nthat progress, wonder and amazement arrest our attention at every step.\r\nThe present occasion, although allowing of no lengthened remarks, may\r\nyet, perhaps, admit of a short comparative statement of important\r\nsubjects of national interest as they existed at that day, and as they\r\nnow exist. I have adopted for this purpose the tabular form of\r\nstatement, as being the most brief and significant.\r\n\r\n                        COMPARATIVE TABLE.\r\n\r\n                                               Year 1793.

Gallagher, Esq., 1850:--\r\n\r\n     \"A few facts will exhibit as well as a volume the wonderful growth\r\n     of Western trade and commerce. Previous to the year 1800, some\r\n     eight or ten keel-boats, of twenty or twenty-five tons each,\r\n     performed all the carrying trade between Cincinnati and Pittsburg.\r\n     In 1802 the first government vessel appeared on Lake Erie. In 1811\r\n     the first steamboat (the Orleans) was launched at Pittsburg. In\r\n     1826 the waters of Michigan were first ploughed by the keel of a\r\n     steamboat, a pleasure trip to Green Bay being planned and executed\r\n     in the summer of this year. In 1832 a steamboat first appeared at\r\n     Chicago. At the present time the entire number of steamboats\r\n     running on the Mississippi and Ohio and their tributaries is more\r\n     probably over than under six hundred, the aggregate tonnage of\r\n     which is not short of one hundred and forty thousand; a larger\r\n     number of steamboats than England can claim, and a greater steam\r\n     commercial marine than that employed by Great Britain and her\r\n     dependencies.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, having stated to you this infallible proof of\r\nthe growth and prosperity of the nation, I ask you, and I would ask\r\nevery man, whether the government which has been over us has proved\r\nitself an infliction or a curse to the country, or any part of it?\r\n\r\nYe men of the South, of all the original Southern States, what say you\r\nto all this? Are you, or any of you, ashamed of this great work of your\r\nfathers? Your fathers were not they who storied the prophets and killed\r\nthem. They were among the prophets; they were of the prophets; they were\r\nthemselves the prophets.\r\n\r\nYe men of Virginia, what do you say to all this? Ye men of the Potomac,\r\ndwelling along the shores of that river on which WASHINGTON lived and\r\ndied, and where his remains now rest, ye, so many of whom may see the\r\ndomes of the Capitol from your own homes, what say ye?\r\n\r\nYe men of James River and the Bay, places consecrated by the early\r\nsettlement of your Commonwealth, what do you say? Do you desire, from\r\nthe soil of your State, or as you travel to the North, to see these\r\nhalls vacated, their beauty and ornaments destroyed, and their national\r\nusefulness gone for ever?\r\n\r\nYe men beyond the Blue Ridge, many thousands of whom are nearer to this\r\nCapitol than to the seat of government of your own State, what do you\r\nthink of breaking this great association into fragments of States and of\r\npeople? I know that some of you, and I believe that you all, would be\r\nalmost as much shocked at the announcement of such a catastrophe, as if\r\nyou were to be informed that the Blue Ridge itself would soon totter\r\nfrom its base. And ye men of Western Virginia, who occupy the great\r\nslope from the top of the Alleghanies to Ohio and Kentucky, what benefit\r\ndo you propose to yourselves by disunion? If you \"secede,\" what do you\r\n\"secede\" from, and what do you \"accede\" to? Do you look for the current\r\nof the Ohio to change, and to bring you and your commerce to the\r\ntidewaters of Eastern rivers? What man in his senses can suppose that\r\nyou would remain part and parcel of Virginia a month after Virginia\r\nshould have ceased to be part and parcel of the United States?\r\n\r\nThe secession of Virginia! The secession of Virginia, whether alone or\r\nin company, is most improbable, the greatest of all improbabilities.\r\nVirginia, to her everlasting honor, acted a great part in framing and\r\nestablishing the present Constitution. She has had her reward and her\r\ndistinction. Seven of her noble sons have each filled the Presidency,\r\nand enjoyed the highest honors of the country. Dolorous complaints come\r\nup to us from the South, that Virginia will not head the march of\r\nsecession, and lead the other Southern States out of the Union. This, if\r\nit should happen, would be something of a marvel, certainly, considering\r\nhow much pains Virginia took to lead these same States into the Union,\r\nand considering, too, that she has partaken as largely of its benefits\r\nand its government as any other State.\r\n\r\nAnd ye men of the other Southern States, members of the Old Thirteen;\r\nyes, members of the Old Thirteen; that always touches my regard and my\r\nsympathies; North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina! What page in your\r\nhistory, or in the history of any one of you, is brighter than those\r\nwhich have been recorded since the Union was formed? Or through what\r\nperiod has your prosperity been greater, or your peace and happiness\r\nbetter secured? What names even has South Carolina, now so much\r\ndissatisfied, what names has she of which her intelligent sons are more\r\nproud than those which have been connected with the government of the\r\nUnited States? In Revolutionary times, and in the earliest days of this\r\nConstitution, there was no State more honored, or more deserving of\r\nhonor. Where is she now? And what a fall is there, my countrymen! But I\r\nleave her to her own reflections, commending to her, with all my heart,\r\nthe due consideration of her own example in times now gone by.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, there are some diseases of the mind as well as of the\r\nbody, diseases of communities as well as diseases of individuals, that\r\nmust be left to their own cure; at least it is wise to leave them so\r\nuntil the last critical moment shall arrive.\r\n\r\nI hope it is not irreverent, and certainly it is not intended as\r\nreproach, when I say, that I know no stronger expression in our language\r\nthan that which describes the restoration of the wayward son,--\"he came\r\nto himself.\" He had broken away from all the ties of love, family, and\r\nfriendship. He had forsaken every thing which he had once regarded in\r\nhis father's house. He had forsworn his natural sympathies, affections,\r\nand habits, and taken his journey into a far country. He had gone away\r\nfrom himself and out of himself. But misfortunes overtook him, and\r\nfamine threatened him with starvation and death. No entreaties from home\r\nfollowed him to beckon him back; no admonition from others warned him of\r\nhis fate. But the hour of reflection had come, and nature and conscience\r\nwrought within him, until at length \"_he came to himself_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, ye men of the new States of the South! You are not of the\r\noriginal thirteen. The battle had been fought and won, the Revolution\r\nachieved, and the Constitution established, before your States had any\r\nexistence as States. You came to a prepared banquet, and had seats\r\nassigned you at table just as honorable as those which were filled by\r\nolder guests. You have been and are singularly prosperous; and if any\r\none should deny this, you would at once contradict his assertion. You\r\nhave bought vast quantities of choice and excellent land at the lowest\r\nprice; and if the public domain has not been lavished upon you, you\r\nyourself will admit that it has been appropriated to your own uses by a\r\nvery liberal hand. And yet in some of these States, not in all, persons\r\nare found in favor of a dissolution of the Union, or of secession from\r\nit. Such opinions are expressed even where the general prosperity of the\r\ncommunity has been the most rapidly advanced. In the flourishing and\r\ninteresting State of Mississippi, for example, there is a large party\r\nwhich insists that her grievances are intolerable, that the whole body\r\npolitic is in a state of suffering; and all along, and through her whole\r\nextent on the Mississippi, a loud cry rings that her only remedy is\r\n\"Secession,\" \"Secession.\" Now, Gentlemen, what infliction does the State\r\nof Mississippi suffer under? What oppression prostrates her strength or\r\ndestroys her happiness? Before we can judge of the proper remedy, we\r\nmust know something of the disease; and, for my part, I confess that the\r\nreal evil existing in the case appears to me to be a certain inquietude\r\nor uneasiness growing out of a high degree of prosperity and\r\nconsciousness of wealth and power, which sometimes lead men to be ready\r\nfor changes, and to push on unreasonably to still higher elevation. If\r\nthis be the truth of the matter, her political doctors are about right.\r\nIf the complaint spring from over-wrought prosperity, for that disease\r\nI have no doubt that secession would prove a sovereign remedy.\r\n\r\nBut I return to the leading topic on which I was engaged. In the\r\ndepartment of invention there have been wonderful applications of\r\nscience to arts within the last sixty years. The spacious hall of the\r\nPatent Office is at once the repository and proof of American inventive\r\nart and genius. Their results are seen in the numerous improvements by\r\nwhich human labor is abridged.\r\n\r\nWithout going into details, it may be sufficient to say, that many of\r\nthe applications of steam to locomotion and manufactures, of electricity\r\nand magnetism to the production of mechanical motion, the electrical\r\ntelegraph, the registration of astronomical phenomena, the art of\r\nmultiplying engravings, the introduction and improvement among us of all\r\nthe important inventions of the Old World, are striking indications of\r\nthe progress of this country in the useful arts. The net-work of\r\nrailroads and telegraphic lines by which this vast country is\r\nreticulated have not only developed its resources, but united\r\nemphatically, in metallic bands, all parts of the Union. The hydraulic\r\nworks of New York, Philadelphia, and Boston surpass in extent and\r\nimportance those of ancient Rome.\r\n\r\nBut we have not confined our attention to the immediate application of\r\nscience to the useful arts. We have entered the field of original\r\nresearch, and have enlarged the bounds of scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nSixty years ago, besides the brilliant discoveries of Franklin in\r\nelectricity, scarcely any thing had been done among us in the way of\r\noriginal discovery. Our men of science were content with repeating the\r\nexperiments and diffusing a knowledge of the discoveries of the learned\r\nof the Old World, without attempting to add a single new fact or\r\nprinciple to the existing stock. Within the last twenty-five or thirty\r\nyears a remarkable improvement has taken place in this respect. Our\r\nnatural history has been explored in all its branches; our geology has\r\nbeen investigated with results of the highest interest to practical and\r\ntheoretical science. Discoveries have been made in pure chemistry and\r\nelectricity, which have received the approbation of the world. The\r\nadvance which has been made in meteorology in this country, within the\r\nlast twenty years, is equal to that made during the same period in all\r\nthe world besides.\r\n\r\nIn 1793 there was not in the United States an instrument with which a\r\ngood observation of the heavenly bodies could be made. There are now\r\ninstruments at Washington, Cambridge, and Cincinnati equal to those at\r\nthe best European observatories, and the original discoveries in\r\nastronomy within the last five years, in this country, are among the\r\nmost brilliant of the age. I can hardly refrain from saying, in this\r\nconnection, that the \"Celestial Mechanics\" of La Place has been\r\ntranslated and commented upon by Bowditch.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the geography and topography of the American continent\r\nhas been rapidly extended by the labor and science of the officers of\r\nthe United States army, and discoveries of much interest in distant seas\r\nhave resulted from the enterprise of the navy.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, a survey of the coast of the United States was commenced, which\r\nat that time it was supposed no American was competent to direct. The\r\nwork has, however, grown within the last few years, under a native\r\nsuperintendent, in importance and extent, beyond any enterprise of the\r\nkind ever before attempted.\r\n\r\nThese facts conclusively prove that a great advance has been made among\r\nus, not only in the application of science to the wants of ordinary\r\nlife, but in science itself, in its highest branches, in its adaptation\r\nto satisfy the cravings of the immortal mind.\r\n\r\nIn respect to literature, with the exception of some books of elementary\r\neducation, and some theological treatises, of which scarcely any but\r\nthose of Jonathan Edwards have any permanent value, and some works on\r\nlocal history and politics, like Hutchinson's Massachusetts, Jefferson's\r\nNotes on Virginia, the Federalist, Belknap's New Hampshire, and Morse's\r\nGeography, and a few others, America had not produced a single work of\r\nany repute in literature. We were almost wholly dependent on imported\r\nbooks. Even our Bibles and Testaments were, for the most part, printed\r\nabroad. The book trade is now one of the greatest branches of business,\r\nand many works of standard value, and of high reputation in Europe as\r\nwell as at home, have been produced by American authors in every\r\ndepartment of literary composition.\r\n\r\nWhile the country has been expanding in dimensions, in numbers, and in\r\nwealth, the government has applied a wise forecast in the adoption of\r\nmeasures necessary, when the world shall no longer be at peace, to\r\nmaintain the national honor, whether by appropriate displays of vigor\r\nabroad, or by well-adapted means of defence at home. A navy, which has\r\nso often illustrated our history by heroic achievements, though in\r\npeaceful times restrained in its operations to narrow limits, possesses,\r\nin its admirable elements, the means of great and sudden expansion, and\r\nis justly looked upon by the nation as the right arm of its power. An\r\narmy, still smaller, but not less perfect in its detail, has on many a\r\nfield exhibited the military aptitudes and prowess of the race, and\r\ndemonstrated the wisdom which has presided over its organization and\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhile the gradual and slow enlargement of these respective military arms\r\nhas been regulated by a jealous watchfulness over the public treasure,\r\nthere has, neverthless, been freely given all that was needed to perfect\r\ntheir quality; and each affords the nucleus of any enlargement that the\r\npublic exigencies may demand, from the millions of brave hearts and\r\nstrong arms upon the land and water.\r\n\r\nThe navy is the active and aggressive element of national defence; and,\r\nlet loose from our own sea-coast, must display its power in the seas and\r\nchannels of the enemy. To do this, it need not be large; and it can\r\nnever be large enough to defend by its presence at home all our ports\r\nand harbors. But, in the absence of the navy, what can the regular army\r\nor the volunteer militia do against the enemy's line-of-battle ships and\r\nsteamers, falling without notice upon our coast? What will guard our\r\ncities from tribute, our merchant-vessels and our navy-yards from\r\nconflagration? Here, again, we see a wise forecast in the system of\r\ndefensive measures which, especially since the close of the war with\r\nGreat Britain, has been steadily followed by our government.\r\n\r\nWhile the perils from which our great establishments had just escaped\r\nwere yet fresh in remembrance, a system of fortifications was begun,\r\nwhich now, though not quite complete, fences in our important points\r\nwith impassable strength. More than four thousand cannon may at any\r\nmoment, within strong and permanent works, arranged with all the\r\nadvantages and appliances that the art affords, be turned to the\r\nprotection of the sea-coast, and be served by the men whose hearths they\r\nshelter. Happy for us that it is so, since these are means of security\r\nthat time alone can supply, and since the improvements of maritime\r\nwarfare, by making distant expeditions easy and speedy, have made them\r\nmore probable, and at the same time more difficult to anticipate and\r\nprovide against. The cost of fortifying all the important points of our\r\ncoast, as well upon the whole Atlantic as the Gulf of Mexico, will not\r\nexceed the amount expended on the fortifications of Paris.\r\n\r\nIn this connection one most important facility in the defence of the\r\ncountry is not to be overlooked; it is the extreme rapidity with which\r\nthe soldiers of the army, and any number of the militia corps, may be\r\nbrought to any point where a hostile attack shall at any time be made or\r\nthreatened.\r\n\r\nAnd this extension of territory embraced within the United States,\r\nincrease of its population, commerce, and manufactures, development\r\nof its resources by canals and railroads, and rapidity of\r\nintercommunication by means of steam and electricity, have all been\r\naccomplished without overthrow of, or danger to, the public liberties,\r\nby any assumption of military power; and, indeed, without any permanent\r\nincrease of the army, except for the purpose of frontier defence, and of\r\naffording a slight guard to the public property; or of the navy, any\r\nfurther than to assure the navigator that, in whatsoever sea he shall\r\nsail his ship, he is protected by the stars and stripes of his country.\r\nThis, too, has been done without the shedding of a drop of blood for\r\ntreason or rebellion; while systems of popular representation have\r\nregularly been supported in the State governments and in the general\r\ngovernment; while laws, national and State, of such a character have\r\nbeen passed, and have been so wisely administered, that I may stand up\r\nhere to-day, and declare, as I now do declare, in the face of all the\r\nintelligent of the age, that, for the period which has elapsed from the\r\nday that Washington laid the foundation of this Capitol to the present\r\ntime, there has been no country upon earth in which life, liberty, and\r\nproperty have been more amply and steadily secured, or more freely\r\nenjoyed, than in these United States of America. Who is there that will\r\ndeny this? Who is there prepared with a greater or a better example? Who\r\nis there that can stand upon the foundation of facts, acknowledged or\r\nproved, and assert that these our republican institutions have not\r\nanswered the true ends of government beyond all precedent in human\r\nhistory?\r\n\r\nThere is yet another view. There are still higher considerations. Man is\r\nan intellectual being, destined to immortality. There is a spirit in\r\nhim, and the breath of the Almighty hath given him understanding. Then\r\nonly is he tending toward his own destiny, while he seeks for knowledge\r\nand virtue, for the will of his Maker, and for just conceptions of his\r\nown duty. Of all important questions, therefore, let this, the most\r\nimportant of all, be first asked and first answered: In what country of\r\nthe habitable globe, of great extent and large population, are the means\r\nof knowledge the most generally diffused and enjoyed among the people?\r\nThis question admits of one, and only one, answer. It is here; it is\r\nhere in these United States; it is among the descendants of those who\r\nsettled at Jamestown; of those who were pilgrims on the shore of\r\nPlymouth; and of those other races of men, who, in subsequent times,\r\nhave become joined in this great American family. Let one fact,\r\nincapable of doubt or dispute, satisfy every mind on this point. The\r\npopulation of the United States is twenty-three millions. Now, take the\r\nmap of the continent of Europe and spread it out before you. Take your\r\nscale and your dividers, and lay off in one area, in any shape you\r\nplease, a triangle, square, circle, parallelogram, or trapezoid, and of\r\nan extent that shall contain one hundred and fifty millions of people,\r\nand there will be found within the United States more persons who do\r\nhabitually read and write than can be embraced within the lines of your\r\ndemarcation.\r\n\r\nBut there is something even more than this. Man is not only an\r\nintellectual, but he is also a religious being, and his religious\r\nfeelings and habits require cultivation. Let the religious element in\r\nman's nature be neglected, let him be influenced by no higher motives\r\nthan low self-interest, and subjected to no stronger restraint than the\r\nlimits of civil authority, and he becomes the creature of selfish\r\npassion or blind fanaticism.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of a nation powerful and enlightened, but without\r\nChristian faith, has been presented, almost within our own day, as a\r\nwarning beacon for the nations.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the cultivation of the religious sentiment represses\r\nlicentiousness, incites to general benevolence and the practical\r\nacknowledgment of the brotherhood of man, inspires respect for law and\r\norder, and gives strength to the whole social fabric, at the same time\r\nthat it conducts the human soul upward to the Author of its being.\r\n\r\nNow, I think it may be stated with truth, that in no country, in\r\nproportion to its population, are there so many benevolent\r\nestablishments connected with religious instruction, Bible, Missionary,\r\nand Tract Societies, supported by public and private contributions, as\r\nin our own. There are also institutions for the education of the blind,\r\nof idiots, of the deaf and dumb; for the reception of orphan and\r\ndestitute children, and the insane; for moral reform, designed for\r\nchildren and females respectively; and institutions for the reformation\r\nof criminals; not to speak of those numerous establishments, in almost\r\nevery county and town in the United States, for the reception of the\r\naged, infirm, and destitute poor, many of whom have fled to our shores\r\nto escape the poverty and wretchedness of their condition at home.\r\n\r\nIn the United States there is no church establishment or ecclesiastical\r\nauthority founded by government. Public worship is maintained either by\r\nvoluntary associations and contributions, or by trusts and donations of\r\na charitable origin.\r\n\r\nNow, I think it safe to say, that a greater portion of the people of the\r\nUnited States attend public worship, decently clad, well behaved, and\r\nwell seated, than of any other country of the civilized world. Edifices\r\nof religion are seen everywhere. Their aggregate cost would amount to an\r\nimmense sum of money. They are, in general, kept in good repair, and\r\nconsecrated to the purposes of public worship. In these edifices the\r\npeople regularly assemble on the Sabbath day, which, by all classes, is\r\nsacredly set apart for rest from secular employment and for religious\r\nmeditation and worship, to listen to the reading of the Holy Scriptures,\r\nand discourses from pious ministers of the several denominations.\r\n\r\nThis attention to the wants of the intellect and of the soul, as\r\nmanifested by the voluntary support of schools and colleges, of churches\r\nand benevolent institutions, is one of the most remarkable\r\ncharacteristics of the American people, not less strikingly exhibited in\r\nthe new than in the older settlements of the country. On the spot where\r\nthe first trees of the forest were felled, near the log cabins of the\r\npioneers, are to be seen rising together the church and the\r\nschool-house. So has it been from the beginning, and God grant that it\r\nmay thus continue!\r\n\r\n    \"On other shores, above their mouldering towns,\r\n    In sullen pomp, the tall cathedral frowns;\r\n    Simple and frail, our lowly temples throw\r\n    Their slender shadows on the paths below;\r\n    Scarce steal the winds, that sweep the woodland tracks,\r\n    The larch's perfume from the settler's axe,\r\n    Ere, like a vision of the morning air,\r\n    His slight-framed steeple marks the house of prayer.\r\n    Yet Faith's pure hymn, beneath its shelter rude,\r\n    Breathes out as sweetly to the tangled wood,\r\n    As where the rays through blazing oriels pour\r\n    On marble shaft and tessellated floor.\"\r\n\r\nWho does not admit that this unparalleled growth in prosperity and\r\nrenown is the result, under Providence, of the union of these States\r\nunder a general Constitution, which guarantees to each State a\r\nrepublican form of government, and to every man the enjoyment of life,\r\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness, free from civil tyranny or\r\necclesiastical domination?\r\n\r\nAnd, to bring home this idea to the present occasion, who does not feel\r\nthat, when President Washington laid his hand on the foundation of the\r\nfirst Capitol, he performed a great work of perpetuation of the Union\r\nand the Constitution? Who does not feel that this seat of the general\r\ngovernment, healthful in its situation, central in its position, near\r\nthe mountains whence gush springs of wonderful virtue, teeming with\r\nNature's richest products, and yet not far from the bays and the great\r\nestuaries of the sea, easily accessible and generally agreeable in\r\nclimate and association, does give strength to the union of these\r\nStates? that this city, bearing an immortal name, with its broad streets\r\nand avenues, its public squares and magnificent edifices of the general\r\ngovernment, erected for the purpose of carrying on within them the\r\nimportant business of the several departments, for the reception of\r\nwonderful and curious inventions, for the preservation of the records of\r\nAmerican learning and genius, of extensive collections of the products\r\nof nature and art, brought hither for study and comparison from all\r\nparts of the world,--adorned with numerous churches, and sprinkled over,\r\nI am happy to say, with many public schools, where all the children of\r\nthe city, without distinction, have the means of obtaining a good\r\neducation, and with academies and colleges, professional schools and\r\npublic libraries,--should continue to receive, as it has heretofore\r\nreceived, the fostering care of Congress, and should be regarded as the\r\npermanent seat of the national government? Here, too, a citizen of the\r\ngreat republic of letters,[2] a republic which knows not the metes and\r\nbounds of political geography, has prophetically indicated his\r\nconviction that America is to exercise a wide and powerful influence in\r\nthe intellectual world, by founding in this city, as a commanding\r\nposition in the field of science and literature, and placing under the\r\nguardianship of the government, an institution \"for the increase and\r\ndiffusion of knowledge among men.\"\r\n\r\nWith each succeeding year new interest is added to the spot; it becomes\r\nconnected with all the historical associations of our country, with her\r\nstatesmen and her orators, and, alas! its cemetery is annually enriched\r\nby the ashes of her chosen sons.\r\n\r\nBefore us is the broad and beautiful river, separating two of the\r\noriginal thirteen States, which a late President, a man of determined\r\npurpose and inflexible will, but patriotic heart, desired to span with\r\narches of ever-enduring granite, symbolical of the firmly cemented union\r\nof the North and the South. That President was General Jackson.\r\n\r\nOn its banks repose the ashes of the Father of his Country, and at our\r\nside, by a singular felicity of position, overlooking the city which he\r\ndesigned, and which bears his name, rises to his memory the marble\r\ncolumn, sublime in its simple grandeur, and fitly intended to reach a\r\nloftier height than any similar structure on the surface of the whole\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nLet the votive offerings of his grateful countrymen be freely\r\ncontributed to carry this monument higher and still higher. May I say,\r\nas on another occasion, \"Let it rise; let it rise till it meet the sun\r\nin his coming; let the earliest light of the morning gild it, and\r\nparting day linger and play on its summit!\"\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, what contemplations are awakened in our minds as we\r\nassemble here to re-enact a scene like that performed by Washington!\r\nMethinks I see his venerable form now before me, as presented in the\r\nglorious statue by Houdon, now in the Capitol of Virginia. He is\r\ndignified and grave; but concern and anxiety seem to soften the\r\nlineaments of his countenance. The government over which he presides is\r\nyet in the crisis of experiment. Not free from troubles at home, he sees\r\nthe world in commotion and in arms all around him. He sees that imposing\r\nforeign powers are half disposed to try the strength of the recently\r\nestablished American government. We perceive that mighty thoughts,\r\nmingled with fears as well as with hopes, are struggling within him. He\r\nheads a short procession over these then naked fields; he crosses yonder\r\nstream on a fallen tree; he ascends to the top of this eminence, whose\r\noriginal oaks of the forest stand as thick around him as if the spot had\r\nbeen devoted to Druidical worship, and here he performs the appointed\r\nduty of the day.\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, if this vision were a reality; if Washington\r\nactually were now amongst us, and if he could draw around him the shades\r\nof the great public men of his own day, patriots and warriors, orators\r\nand statesmen, and were to address us in their presence, would he not\r\nsay to us: \"Ye men of this generation, I rejoice and thank God for being\r\nable to see that our labors and toils and sacrifices were not in vain.\r\nYou are prosperous, you are happy, you are grateful; the fire of\r\nliberty burns brightly and steadily in your hearts, while DUTY and the\r\nLAW restrain it from bursting forth in wild and destructive\r\nconflagration. Cherish liberty, as you love it; cherish its securities,\r\nas you wish to preserve it. Maintain the Constitution which we labored\r\nso painfully to establish, and which has been to you such a source of\r\ninestimable blessings. Preserve the union of the States, cemented as it\r\nwas by our prayers, our tears, and our blood. Be true to God, to your\r\ncountry, and to your duty. So shall the whole Eastern world follow the\r\nmorning sun to contemplate you as a nation; so shall all generations\r\nhonor you, as they honor us; and so shall that Almighty Power which so\r\ngraciously protected us, and which now protects you, shower its\r\neverlasting blessings upon you and your posterity.\"\r\n\r\nGreat Father of your Country! we heed your words; we feel their force as\r\nif you now uttered them with lips of flesh and blood. Your example\r\nteaches us, your affectionate addresses teach us, your public life\r\nteaches us, your sense of the value of the blessings of the Union. Those\r\nblessings our fathers have tasted, and we have tasted, and still taste.\r\nNor do we intend that those who come after us shall be denied the same\r\nhigh fruition. Our honor as well as our happiness is concerned. We\r\ncannot, we dare not, we will not, betray our sacred trust. We will not\r\nfilch from posterity the treasure placed in our hands to be transmitted\r\nto other generations. The bow that gilds the clouds in the heavens, the\r\npillars that uphold the firmament, may disappear and fall away in the\r\nhour appointed by the will of God; but until that day comes, or so long\r\nas our lives may last, no ruthless hand shall undermine that bright arch\r\nof Union and Liberty which spans the continent from Washington to\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, we must sometimes be tolerant to folly, and patient at\r\nthe sight of the extreme waywardness of men; but I confess that, when I\r\nreflect on the renown of our past history, on our present prosperity and\r\ngreatness, and on what the future hath yet to unfold, and when I see\r\nthat there are men who can find in all this nothing good, nothing\r\nvaluable, nothing truly glorious, I feel that all their reason has fled\r\naway from them, and left the entire control over their judgment and\r\ntheir actions to insanity and fanaticism; and more than all,\r\nfellow-citizens, if the purposes of fanatics and disunionists should be\r\naccomplished, the patriotic and intelligent of our generation would seek\r\nto hide themselves from the scorn of the world, and go about to find\r\ndishonorable graves.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, take _courage_; be of _good cheer_. We shall come to no\r\nsuch ignoble end. We shall live, and not die. During the period allotted\r\nto our several lives, we shall continue to rejoice in the return of this\r\nanniversary. The ill-omened sounds of fanaticism will be hushed; the\r\nghastly spectres of _Secession_ and _Disunion_ will disappear; and the\r\nenemies of united constitutional liberty, if their hatred cannot be\r\nappeased, may prepare to have their eyeballs seared as they behold the\r\nsteady flight of the American eagle, on his burnished wings, for years\r\nand years to come.\r\n\r\nPresident Fillmore, it is your singularly good fortune to perform an act\r\nsuch as that which the earliest of your predecessors performed\r\nfifty-eight years ago. You stand where he stood; you lay your hand on\r\nthe corner-stone of a building designed greatly to extend that whose\r\ncorner-stone he laid. Changed, changed is every thing around. The same\r\nsun, indeed, shone upon his head which now shines upon yours. The same\r\nbroad river rolled at his feet, and bathes his last resting-place, that\r\nnow rolls at yours. But the site of this city was then mainly an open\r\nfield. Streets and avenues have since been laid out and completed,\r\nsquares and public grounds enclosed and ornamented, until the city which\r\nbears his name, although comparatively inconsiderable in numbers and\r\nwealth, has become quite fit to be the seat of government of a great\r\nand united people.\r\n\r\nSir, may the consequences of the duty which you perform so auspiciously\r\nto-day, equal those which flowed from his act. Nor this only; may the\r\nprinciples of your administration, and the wisdom of your political\r\nconduct, be such, as that the world of the present day, and all history\r\nhereafter, may be at no loss to perceive what example you have made your\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nFellow-citizens, I now bring this address to a close, by expressing to\r\nyou, in the words of the great Roman orator, the deepest wish of my\r\nheart, and which I know dwells deeply in the hearts of all who hear me:\r\n\"Duo modo haec opto; unum, UT MORIENS POPULUM ROMANUM LIBERUM RELINQUAM;\r\nhoc mihi majus a diis immortalibus dari nihil potest: alterum, ut ita\r\ncuique eveniat, ut de republicâ quisque mereatur.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, fellow-citizens, with hearts void of hatred, envy, and malice\r\ntowards our own countrymen, or any of them, or towards the subjects or\r\ncitizens of other governments, or towards any member of the great family\r\nof man; but exulting, nevertheless, in our own peace, security, and\r\nhappiness, in the grateful remembrance of the past, and the glorious\r\nhopes of the future, let us return to our homes, and with all humility\r\nand devotion offer our thanks to the Father of all our mercies,\r\npolitical, social, and religious.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The following motto stands upon the title-page of the\r\noriginal pamphlet edition:--\r\n\r\n            \"Stet Capitolium\r\n    Fulgens;\r\n            late nomen in ultimas\r\n    Extendat oras.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Hugh Smithson, whose munificent bequest has been applied to\r\nthe foundation of \"The Smithsonian Institution.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPRESSMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Webster to Lord Ashburton._\r\n\r\nDepartment of State, Washington,\r\nAugust 8, 1842.\r\n\r\nMy Lord,--We have had several conversations on the subject of\r\nimpressment, but I do not understand that your Lordship has instructions\r\nfrom your government to negotiate upon it, nor does the government of\r\nthe United States see any utility in opening such negotiation, unless\r\nthe British government is prepared to renounce the practice in all\r\nfuture wars.\r\n\r\nNo cause has produced to so great an extent, and for so long a period,\r\ndisturbing and irritating influences on the political relations of the\r\nUnited States and England, as the impressment of seamen by British\r\ncruisers from American merchant-vessels.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the French Revolution to the breaking out of\r\nthe war between the two countries in 1812, hardly a year elapsed without\r\nloud complaint and earnest remonstrance. A deep feeling of opposition to\r\nthe right claimed, and to the practice exercised under it, and not\r\nunfrequently exercised without the least regard to what justice and\r\nhumanity would have dictated, even if the right itself had been\r\nadmitted, took possession of the public mind of America, and this\r\nfeeling, it is well known, co-operated most powerfully with other causes\r\nto produce the state of hostilities which ensued.\r\n\r\nAt different periods, both before and since the war, negotiations have\r\ntaken place between the two governments, with the hope of finding some\r\nmeans of quieting these complaints. At some times, the effectual\r\nabolition of the practice has been requested and treated of; at other\r\ntimes, its temporary suspension; and at other times, again, the\r\nlimitation of its exercise, and some security against its enormous\r\nabuses.\r\n\r\nA common destiny has attended these efforts; they have all failed. The\r\nquestion stands at this moment where it stood fifty years ago. The\r\nnearest approach to a settlement was a convention proposed in 1803, and\r\nwhich had come to the point of signature, when it was broken off in\r\nconsequence of the British government insisting that the _narrow seas_\r\nshould be expressly excepted out of the sphere over which the\r\ncontemplated stipulation against impressment should extend. The American\r\nMinister, Mr. King, regarded this exception as quite inadmissible, and\r\nchose rather to abandon the negotiation than to acquiesce in the\r\ndoctrine which it proposed to establish.\r\n\r\nEngland asserts the right of impressing British subjects, in time of\r\nwar, out of neutral merchant-vessels, and of deciding by her visiting\r\nofficers who, among the crews of such merchant-vessels, are British\r\nsubjects. She asserts this as a legal exercise of the prerogative of the\r\ncrown; which prerogative is alleged to be founded on the English law of\r\nthe perpetual and indissoluble allegiance of the subject, and his\r\nobligation under all circumstances, and for his whole life, to render\r\nmilitary service to the crown whenever required.\r\n\r\nThis statement, made in the words of eminent British jurists, shows at\r\nonce that the English claim is far broader than the basis or platform on\r\nwhich it is raised. The law relied on is English law; the obligations\r\ninsisted on are obligations existing between the crown of England and\r\nits subjects. This law and these obligations, it is admitted, may be\r\nsuch as England may choose they shall be. But then they must be confined\r\nto the parties. Impressment of seamen out of and beyond English\r\nterritory, and from on board the ships of other nations, is an\r\ninterference with the rights of other nations; is further, therefore,\r\nthan English prerogative can legally extend; and is nothing but an\r\nattempt to enforce the peculiar law of England beyond the dominions and\r\njurisdiction of the crown. The claim asserts an extra-territorial\r\nauthority for the law of British prerogative, and assumes to exercise\r\nthis extra-territorial authority, to the manifest injury and annoyance\r\nof the citizens and subjects of other states, on board their own\r\nvessels, on the high seas.\r\n\r\nEvery merchant-vessel on the seas is rightfully considered as part of\r\nthe territory of the country to which it belongs. The entry, therefore,\r\ninto such vessel, being neutral, by a belligerent, is an act of force,\r\nand is, _prima facie_, a wrong, a trespass, which can be justified only\r\nwhen done for some purpose allowed to form a sufficient justification by\r\nthe law of nations. But a British cruiser enters an American\r\nmerchant-vessel in order to take therefrom supposed British subjects;\r\noffering no justification, therefore, under the law of nations, but\r\nclaiming the right under the law of England respecting the king's\r\nprerogative. This cannot be defended. English soil, English territory,\r\nEnglish jurisdiction, is the appropriate sphere for the operation of\r\nEnglish law. The ocean is the sphere of the law of nations; and any\r\nmerchant-vessel on the seas is by that law under the protection of the\r\nlaws of her own nation, and may claim immunity, unless in cases in which\r\nthat law allows her to be entered or visited.\r\n\r\nIf this notion of perpetual allegiance, and the consequent power of the\r\nprerogative, was the law of the world; if it formed part of the\r\nconventional code of nations, and was usually practised, like the right\r\nof visiting neutral ships, for the purpose of discovering and seizing\r\nenemy's property, then impressment might be defended as a common right,\r\nand there would be no remedy for the evil till the national code should\r\nbe altered. But this is by no means the case. There is no such principle\r\nincorporated into the code of nations. The doctrine stands only as\r\nEnglish law, not as a national law; and English law cannot be of force\r\nbeyond English dominion. Whatever duties or relations that law creates\r\nbetween the sovereign and his subjects can be enforced and maintained\r\nonly within the realm, or proper possessions or territory of the\r\nsovereign. There may be quite as just a prerogative right to the\r\nproperty of subjects as to their personal services, in an exigency of\r\nthe state; but no government thinks of controlling by its own laws\r\nproperty of its subjects situated abroad; much less does any government\r\nthink of entering the territory of another power for the purpose of\r\nseizing such property and applying it to its own uses. As laws, the\r\nprerogatives of the crown of England have no obligation on persons or\r\nproperty domiciled or situated abroad.\r\n\r\n\"When, therefore,\" says an authority not unknown or unregarded on either\r\nside of the Atlantic, \"we speak of the right of a state to bind its own\r\nnative subjects everywhere, we speak only of its own claim and exercise\r\nof sovereignty over them when they return within its own territorial\r\njurisdiction, and not of its right to compel or require obedience to\r\nsuch laws, on the part of other nations, within their own territorial\r\nsovereignty. On the contrary, every nation has an exclusive right to\r\nregulate persons and things within its own territory, according to its\r\nsovereign will and public polity.\"\r\n\r\nThe good sense of these principles, their remarkable pertinency to the\r\nsubject now under consideration, and the extraordinary consequences\r\nresulting from the British doctrine, are signally manifested by that\r\nwhich we see taking place every day. England acknowledges herself\r\noverburdened with population of the poorer classes. Every instance of\r\nthe emigration of persons of those classes is regarded by her as a\r\nbenefit. England, therefore, encourages emigration; means are\r\nnotoriously supplied to emigrants, to assist their conveyance, from\r\npublic funds; and the New World, and most especially these United\r\nStates, receive the many thousands of her subjects thus ejected from the\r\nbosom of their native land by the necessities of their condition. They\r\ncome away from poverty and distress in over-crowded cities, to seek\r\nemployment, comfort, and new homes in a country of free institutions,\r\npossessed by a kindred race, speaking their own language, and having\r\nlaws and usages in many respects like those to which they have been\r\naccustomed; and a country which, upon the whole, is found to possess\r\nmore attractions for persons of their character and condition than any\r\nother on the face of the globe. It is stated that, in the quarter of the\r\nyear ending with June last, more than twenty-six thousand emigrants left\r\nthe single port of Liverpool for the United States, being four or five\r\ntimes as many as left the same port within the same period for the\r\nBritish colonies and all other parts of the world. Of these crowds of\r\nemigrants, many arrive in our cities in circumstances of great\r\ndestitution, and the charities of the country, both public and private,\r\nare severely taxed to relieve their immediate wants. In time they\r\nmingle with the new community in which they find themselves, and seek\r\nmeans of living. Some find employment in the cities, others go to the\r\nfrontiers, to cultivate lands reclaimed from the forest; and a greater\r\nor less number of the residue, becoming in time naturalized citizens,\r\nenter into the merchant service under the flag of their adopted country.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lord, if war should break out between England and a European\r\npower, can any thing be more unjust, any thing more irreconcilable to\r\nthe general sentiments of mankind, than that England should seek out\r\nthese persons, thus encouraged by her and compelled by their own\r\ncondition to leave their native homes, tear them away from their new\r\nemployments, their new political relations, and their domestic\r\nconnections, and force them to undergo the dangers and hardships of\r\nmilitary service for a country which has thus ceased to be their own\r\ncountry? Certainly, certainly, my Lord, there can be but one answer to\r\nthis question. Is it not far more reasonable that England should either\r\nprevent such emigration of her subjects, or that, if she encourage and\r\npromote it, she should leave them, not to the embroilment of a double\r\nand contradictory allegiance, but to their own voluntary choice, to form\r\nsuch relations, political or social, as they see fit, in the country\r\nwhere they are to find their bread, and to the laws and institutions of\r\nwhich they are to look for defence and protection?\r\n\r\nA question of such serious importance ought now to be put at rest. If\r\nthe United States give shelter and protection to those whom the policy\r\nof England annually casts upon their shores,--if, by the benign\r\ninfluences of their government and institutions, and by the happy\r\ncondition of the country, those emigrants become raised from poverty to\r\ncomfort, finding it easy even to become landholders, and being allowed\r\nto partake in the enjoyment of all civil rights,--if all this may be\r\ndone, (and all this is done, under the countenance and encouragement of\r\nEngland herself,) is it not high time that, yielding that which had its\r\norigin in feudal ideas as inconsistent with the present state of\r\nsociety, and especially with the intercourse and relations subsisting\r\nbetween the Old World and the New, England should at length formally\r\ndisclaim all right to the services of such persons, and renounce all\r\ncontrol over their conduct?\r\n\r\nBut impressment is subject to objections of a much wider range. If it\r\ncould be justified in its application to those who are declared to be\r\nits only objects, it still remains true that, in its exercise, it\r\ntouches the political rights of other governments, and endangers the\r\nsecurity of their own native subjects and citizens. The sovereignty of\r\nthe state is concerned in maintaining its exclusive jurisdiction and\r\npossession over its merchant-ships on the seas, except so far as the law\r\nof nations justifies intrusion upon that possession for special\r\npurposes; and all experience has shown, that no member of a crew,\r\nwherever born, is safe against impressment when a ship is visited.\r\n\r\nThe evils and injuries resulting from the actual practice can hardly be\r\noverstated, and have ever proved themselves to be such as should lead to\r\nits relinquishment, even if it were founded in any defensible principle.\r\nThe difficulty of discriminating between English subjects and American\r\ncitizens has always been found to be great, even when an honest purpose\r\nof discrimination has existed. But the lieutenant of a man-of-war,\r\nhaving necessity for men, is apt to be a summary judge, and his\r\ndecisions will be quite as significant of his own wants and his own\r\npower as of the truth and justice of the case. An extract from a letter\r\nof Mr. King, of the 13th of April, 1797, to the American Secretary of\r\nState, shows something of the enormous extent of these wrongful\r\nseizures.\r\n\r\n\"Instead of a few, and these in many instances equivocal cases, I have,\"\r\nsays he, \"since the month of July past, made application for the\r\ndischarge from British men-of-war of two hundred and seventy-one seamen,\r\nwho, stating themselves to be Americans, have claimed my interference.\r\nOf this number, eighty-six have been ordered by the Admiralty to be\r\ndischarged, thirty-seven more have been detained as British subjects or\r\nas American volunteers, or for want of proof that they are Americans,\r\nand to my applications for the discharge of the remaining one hundred\r\nand forty-eight I have received no answer; the ships on board of which\r\nthese seamen were detained having, in many instances, sailed before an\r\nexamination was made in consequence of my application.\r\n\r\n\"It is certain that some of those who have applied to me are not\r\nAmerican citizens, but the exceptions are, in my opinion, few, and the\r\nevidence, exclusive of certificates, has been such as, in most cases,\r\nto satisfy me that the applicants were real Americans, who have been\r\nforced into the British service, and who, with singular constancy, have\r\ngenerally persevered in refusing pay or bounty, though in some instances\r\nthey have been in service more than two years.\"\r\n\r\nBut the injuries of impressment are by no means confined to its\r\nimmediate subjects, or the individuals on whom it is practised. Vessels\r\nsuffer from the weakening of their crews, and voyages are often delayed,\r\nand not unfrequently broken up, by subtraction from the number of\r\nnecessary hands by impressment. And what is of still greater and more\r\ngeneral moment, the fear of impressment has been found to create great\r\ndifficulty in obtaining sailors for the American merchant service in\r\ntimes of European war. Seafaring men, otherwise inclined to enter into\r\nthat service, are, as experience has shown, deterred by the fear of\r\nfinding themselves erelong in compulsory military service in British\r\nships of war. Many instances have occurred, fully established by proof,\r\nin which raw seamen, natives of the United States, fresh from the fields\r\nof agriculture, entering for the first time on shipboard, have been\r\nimpressed before they made the land, placed on the decks of British\r\nmen-of-war, and compelled to serve for years before they could obtain\r\ntheir release, or revisit their country and their homes. Such instances\r\nbecome known, and their effect in discouraging young men from engaging\r\nin the merchant service of their country can neither be doubted nor\r\nwondered at. More than all, my Lord, the practice of impressment,\r\nwhenever it has existed, has produced, not conciliation and good\r\nfeeling, but resentment, exasperation, and animosity between the two\r\ngreat commercial countries of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the calm and quiet which have succeeded the late war, a condition so\r\nfavorable for dispassionate consideration, England herself has evidently\r\nseen the harshness of impressment, even when exercised on seamen in her\r\nown merchant service, and she has adopted measures calculated, if not to\r\nrenounce the power or to abolish the practice, yet at least to supersede\r\nits necessity by other means of manning the royal navy more compatible\r\nwith justice and the rights of individuals, and far more conformable to\r\nthe spirit and sentiments of the age.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, the government of the United States has used\r\nthe occasion of your Lordship's pacific mission to review this whole\r\nsubject, and to bring it to your notice and that of your government. It\r\nhas reflected on the past, pondered the condition of the present, and\r\nendeavored to anticipate, so far as might be in its power, the probable\r\nfuture; and I am now to communicate to your Lordship the result of these\r\ndeliberations.\r\n\r\nThe American government, then, is prepared to say that the practice of\r\nimpressing seamen from American vessels cannot hereafter be allowed to\r\ntake place. That practice is founded on principles which it does not\r\nrecognize, and is invariably attended by consequences so unjust, so\r\ninjurious, and of such formidable magnitude, as cannot be submitted to.\r\n\r\nIn the early disputes between the two governments on this so long\r\ncontested topic, the distinguished person to whose hands were first\r\nintrusted the seals of this department[1] declared, that \"the simplest\r\nrule will be, that the vessel being American shall be evidence that the\r\nseamen on board are such.\"\r\n\r\nFifty years' experience, the utter failure of many negotiations, and a\r\ncareful reconsideration, now had, of the whole subject, at a moment when\r\nthe passions are laid, and no present interest or emergency exists to\r\nbias the judgment, have fully convinced this government that this is not\r\nonly the simplest and best, but the only rule, which can be adopted and\r\nobserved, consistently with the rights and honor of the United States\r\nand the security of their citizens. That rule announces, therefore, what\r\nwill hereafter be the principle maintained by their government. In every\r\nregularly documented American merchant-vessel the crew who navigate it\r\nwill find their protection in the flag which is over them.\r\n\r\nThis announcement is not made, my Lord, to revive useless recollections\r\nof the past, nor to stir the embers from fires which have been, in a\r\ngreat degree, smothered by many years of peace. Far otherwise. Its\r\npurpose is to extinguish those fires effectually, before new incidents\r\narise to fan them into flame. The communication is in the spirit of\r\npeace, and for the sake of peace, and springs from a deep and\r\nconscientious conviction that high interests of both nations require\r\nthis so long contested and controverted subject now to be finally put to\r\nrest. I persuade myself that you will do justice to this frank and\r\nsincere avowal of motives, and that you will communicate your sentiments\r\nin this respect to your government.\r\n\r\nThis letter closes, my Lord, on my part, our official correspondence;\r\nand I gladly use the occasion to offer you the assurance of my high and\r\nsincere regard.\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nLORD ASHBURTON, &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Lord Ashburton to Mr. Webster._\r\n\r\nWashington, August 9, 1842.\r\n\r\nSir,--The note you did me the honor of addressing me the 8th instant, on\r\nthe subject of impressment, shall be transmitted without delay to my\r\ngovernment, and will, you may be assured, receive from them the\r\ndeliberate attention which its importance deserves.\r\n\r\nThe object of my mission was mainly the settlement of existing subjects\r\nof difference; and no differences have or could have arisen of late\r\nyears with respect to impressment, because the practice has, since the\r\npeace, wholly ceased, and cannot, consistently with existing laws and\r\nregulations for manning her Majesty's navy, be, under the present\r\ncircumstances, renewed.\r\n\r\nDesirous, however, of looking far forward into futurity to anticipate\r\neven possible causes of disagreement, and sensible of the anxiety of the\r\nAmerican people on this grave subject of past irritation, I should be\r\nsorry in any way to discourage the attempt at some settlement of it;\r\nand, although without authority to enter upon it here during the limited\r\ncontinuance of my mission, I entertain a confident hope that this task\r\nmay be accomplished, when undertaken with the spirit of candor and\r\nconciliation which has marked all our late negotiations.\r\n\r\nIt not being our intention to endeavor now to come to any agreement on\r\nthis subject, I may be permitted to abstain from noticing at length your\r\nvery ingenious arguments relating to it, and from discussing the graver\r\nmatters of constitutional and international law growing out of them.\r\nThese sufficiently show that the question is one requiring calm\r\nconsideration; though I must, at the same time, admit that they prove a\r\nstrong necessity of some settlement for the preservation of that good\r\nunderstanding which, I trust, we may flatter ourselves that our joint\r\nlabors have now succeeded in establishing.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the laws of our two countries maintain opposite\r\nprinciples respecting allegiance to the sovereign. America, receiving\r\nevery year by thousands the emigrants of Europe, maintains the doctrine\r\nsuitable to her condition, of the right of transferring allegiance at\r\nwill. The laws of Great Britain have maintained from all time the\r\nopposite doctrine. The duties of allegiance are held to be indefeasible;\r\nand it is believed that this doctrine, under various modifications,\r\nprevails in most, if not in all, the civilized states of Europe.\r\n\r\nEmigration, the modern mode by which the population of the world\r\npeaceably finds its level, is for the benefit of all, and eminently for\r\nthe benefit of humanity. The fertile deserts of America are gradually\r\nadvancing to the highest state of cultivation and production, while the\r\nemigrant acquires comfort which his own confined home could not afford\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIf there were any thing in our laws or our practice on either side\r\ntending to impede this march of providential humanity, we could not be\r\ntoo eager to provide a remedy; but as this does not appear to be the\r\ncase, we may safely leave this part of the subject without indulging in\r\nabstract speculations having no material practical application to\r\nmatters in discussion between us.\r\n\r\nBut it must be admitted that a serious practical question does arise,\r\nor, rather, has existed, from practices formerly attending the mode of\r\nmanning the British navy in times of war. The principle is, that all\r\nsubjects of the crown are, in case of necessity, bound to serve their\r\ncountry, and the seafaring man is naturally taken for the naval service.\r\nThis is not, as is sometimes supposed, any arbitrary principle of\r\nmonarchical government, but one founded on the natural duty of every man\r\nto defend the life of his country; and all the analogy of your laws\r\nwould lead to the conclusion, that the same principle would hold good in\r\nthe United States if their geographical position did not make its\r\napplication unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe very anomalous condition of the two countries with relation to each\r\nother here creates a serious difficulty. Our people are not\r\ndistinguishable; and, owing to the peculiar habits of sailors, our\r\nvessels are very generally manned from a common stock. It is difficult,\r\nunder these circumstances, to execute laws which at times have been\r\nthought to be essential for the existence of the country, without risk\r\nof injury to others. The extent and importance of those injuries,\r\nhowever, are so formidable, that it is admitted that some remedy should,\r\nif possible, be applied; at all events, it must be fairly and honestly\r\nattempted. It is true, that during the continuance of peace no\r\npractical grievance can arise; but it is also true, that it is for that\r\nreason the proper season for the calm and deliberate consideration of an\r\nimportant subject. I have much reason to hope that a satisfactory\r\narrangement respecting it may be made, so as to set at rest all\r\napprehension and anxiety; and I will only further repeat the assurance\r\nof the sincere disposition of my government favorably to consider all\r\nmatters having for their object the promoting and maintaining\r\nundisturbed kind and friendly feelings with the United States.\r\n\r\nI beg, Sir, on this occasion of closing the correspondence with you\r\nconnected with my mission, to express the satisfaction I feel at its\r\nsuccessful termination, and to assure you of my high consideration and\r\npersonal esteem and regard.\r\n\r\nASHBURTON.\r\n\r\nHON. DANIEL WEBSTER, &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Jefferson.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT OF SEARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Webster to Mr. Everett._\r\n\r\nDepartment of State, Washington,\r\nMarch 28, 1843.\r\n\r\nSir,--I transmit to you with this despatch a message from the President\r\nof the United States to Congress, communicated on the 27th of February,\r\nand accompanied by a report made from this department to the President,\r\nof the substance of a despatch from Lord Aberdeen to Mr. Fox, which was\r\nby him read to me on the 24th ultimo.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen's despatch, as you will perceive, was occasioned by a\r\npassage in the President's message to Congress at the opening of its\r\nlate session. The particular passage is not stated by his Lordship; but\r\nno mistake will be committed, it is presumed, in considering it to be\r\nthat which was quoted by Sir Robert Peel and other gentlemen in the\r\ndebate in the House of Commons, on the answer to the Queen's speech, on\r\nthe 3d of February.\r\n\r\nThe President regrets that it should have become necessary to hold a\r\ndiplomatic correspondence upon the subject of a communication from the\r\nhead of the executive government to the legislature, drawing after it,\r\nas in this case, the further necessity of referring to observations made\r\nby persons in high and responsible stations, in debates of public\r\nbodies. Such a necessity, however, seems to be unavoidably incurred in\r\nconsequence of Lord Aberdeen's despatch; for, although the President's\r\nrecent message may be regarded as a clear exposition of his opinions on\r\nthe subject, yet a just respect for her Majesty's government, and a\r\ndisposition to meet all questions with promptness, as well as with\r\nfrankness and candor, require that a formal answer should be made to\r\nthat despatch.\r\n\r\nThe words in the message at the opening of the session which are\r\ncomplained of, it is supposed, are the following: \"Although Lord\r\nAberdeen, in his correspondence with the American envoys at London,\r\nexpressly disclaimed all right to detain an American ship on the high\r\nseas, even if found with a cargo of slaves on board, and restricted the\r\nBritish pretension to a mere claim to visit and inquire, yet it could\r\nnot well be discerned by the Executive of the United States how such\r\nvisit and inquiry could be made without detention on the voyage, and\r\nconsequent interruption to the trade. It was regarded as the right of\r\nsearch, presented only in a new form and expressed in different words;\r\nand I therefore felt it to be my duty distinctly to declare, in my\r\nannual message to Congress, that no such concession could be made, and\r\nthat the United States had both the will and the ability to enforce\r\ntheir own laws, and to protect their flag from being used for purposes\r\nwholly forbidden by those laws, and obnoxious to the moral censure of\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement would tend, as Lord Aberdeen thinks, to convey the\r\nsupposition, not only that the question of the right of search had been\r\ndisavowed by the British plenipotentiary at Washington, but that Great\r\nBritain had made concessions on that point.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen is entirely correct in saying that the claim of a right of\r\nsearch was not discussed during the late negotiation, and that neither\r\nwas any concession required by this government, nor made by that of her\r\nBritannic Majesty.\r\n\r\nThe eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of Washington constitute a\r\nmutual stipulation for concerted efforts to abolish the African\r\nslave-trade. The stipulation, it may be admitted, has no other effects\r\non the pretensions of either party than this: Great Britain had claimed\r\nas a _right_ that which this government could not admit to be a _right_,\r\nand, in the exercise of a just and proper spirit of amity, a mode was\r\nresorted to which might render unnecessary both the assertion and the\r\ndenial of such claim.\r\n\r\nThere probably are those who think that what Lord Aberdeen calls a right\r\nof visit, and which he attempts to distinguish from the right of search,\r\nought to have been expressly acknowledged by the government of the\r\nUnited States. At the same time, there are those on the other side who\r\nthink that the formal surrender of such right of visit should have been\r\ndemanded by the United States as a precedent condition to the\r\nnegotiation for treaty stipulations on the subject of the African\r\nslave-trade. But the treaty neither asserts the claim in terms, nor\r\ndenies the claim in terms; it neither formally insists upon it, nor\r\nformally renounces it. Still, the whole proceeding shows that the object\r\nof the stipulation was to avoid such differences and disputes as had\r\nalready arisen, and the serious practical evils and inconveniences\r\nwhich, it cannot be denied, are always liable to result from the\r\npractice which Great Britain had asserted to be lawful. These evils and\r\ninconveniences had been acknowledged by both governments. They had been\r\nsuch as to cause much irritation, and to threaten to disturb the\r\namicable sentiments which prevailed between them. Both governments were\r\nsincerely desirous of abolishing the slave-trade; both governments were\r\nequally desirous of avoiding occasion of complaint by their respective\r\ncitizens and subjects; and both governments regarded the eighth and\r\nninth articles as effectual for their avowed purpose, and likely, at the\r\nsame time, to preserve all friendly relations, and to take away causes\r\nof future individual complaints. The treaty of Washington was intended\r\nto fulfil the obligations entered into by the treaty of Ghent. It stands\r\nby itself; is clear and intelligible. It speaks its own language, and\r\nmanifests its own purpose. It needs no interpretation, and requires no\r\ncomment. As a fact, as an important occurrence in national intercourse,\r\nit may have important bearings on existing questions respecting the\r\npublic law; and individuals, or perhaps governments, may not agree as to\r\nwhat these bearings really are. Great Britain has discussions, if not\r\ncontroversies, with other great European states upon the subject of\r\nvisit or search. These states will naturally make their own commentary\r\non the treaty of Washington, and draw their own inferences from the fact\r\nthat such a treaty has been entered into. Its stipulations, in the mean\r\ntime, are plain, explicit, and satisfactory to both parties, and will be\r\nfulfilled on the part of the United States, and, it is not doubted, on\r\nthe part of Great Britain also, with the utmost good faith.\r\n\r\nHolding this to be the true character of the treaty, I might, perhaps,\r\nexcuse myself from entering into the consideration of the grounds of\r\nthat claim of a right to visit merchant-ships for certain purposes, in\r\ntime of peace, which Lord Aberdeen asserts for the British government,\r\nand declares that it can never surrender. But I deem it right,\r\nnevertheless, and no more than justly respectful toward the British\r\ngovernment, not to leave the point without remark.\r\n\r\nIn his recent message to Congress, the President, referring to the\r\nlanguage of Lord Aberdeen in his note to Mr. Everett of the 20th of\r\nDecember, 1841, and in his late despatch to Mr. Fox, says: \"These\r\ndeclarations may well lead us to doubt whether the apparent difference\r\nbetween the two governments is not rather one of definition than of\r\nprinciple.\"\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen, in his note to you of the 20th of December, says: \"The\r\nundersigned again renounces, as he has already done in the most explicit\r\nterms, any right on the part of the British government to search\r\nAmerican vessels in time of peace. The right of search, except when\r\nspecially conceded by treaty, is a pure belligerent right, and can have\r\nno existence on the high seas during peace. The undersigned apprehends,\r\nhowever, that the right of search is not confined to the verification of\r\nthe nationality of the vessel, but also extends to the object of the\r\nvoyage and the nature of the cargo. The sole purpose of the British\r\ncruisers is to ascertain whether the vessels they meet with are really\r\nAmerican or not. The right asserted has, in truth, no resemblance to the\r\nright of search, either in principle or practice. It is simply a right\r\nto satisfy the party who has a legitimate interest in knowing the truth,\r\nthat the vessel actually is what her colors announce. This right we\r\nconcede as freely as we exercise. The British cruisers are not\r\ninstructed to detain American vessels under any circumstances whatever;\r\non the contrary, they are ordered to abstain from all interference with\r\nthem, be they slavers or otherwise. But where reasonable suspicion\r\nexists that the American flag has been abused for the purpose of\r\ncovering the vessel of another nation, it would appear scarcely\r\ncredible, had it not been made manifest by the repeated protestations of\r\ntheir representative, that the government of the United States, which\r\nhas stigmatized and abolished the trade itself, should object to the\r\nadoption of such means as are indispensably necessary for ascertaining\r\nthe truth.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in his recent despatch to Mr. Fox his Lordship further says: \"That\r\nthe President might be assured that Great Britain would always respect\r\nthe just claims of the United States. That the British government made\r\nno pretension to interfere in any manner whatever, either by detention,\r\nvisit, or search, with vessels of the United States, known or believed\r\nto be such, but that it still maintained, and would exercise when\r\nnecessary, its own right to ascertain the genuineness of any flag which\r\na suspected vessel might bear; that if, in the exercise of this right,\r\neither from involuntary error, or in spite of every precaution, loss or\r\ninjury should be sustained, a prompt reparation would be afforded; but\r\nthat it should entertain, for a single instant, the notion of abandoning\r\nthe right itself, would be quite impossible.\"\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the British claim, as asserted by her Majesty's\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIn his remarks in the speech already referred to, in the House of\r\nCommons, the first minister of the crown said: \"There is nothing more\r\ndistinct than the right of visit is from the right of search. Search is\r\na belligerent right, and not to be exercised in time of peace, except\r\nwhen it has been conceded by treaty. The right of search extends not\r\nonly to the vessel, but to the cargo also. The right of visit is quite\r\ndistinct from this, though the two are often unfounded. The right of\r\nsearch, with respect to American vessels, we entirely and utterly\r\ndisclaim; nay, more, if we knew that an American vessel were furnished\r\nwith all the materials requisite for the slave-trade, if we knew that\r\nthe decks were prepared to receive hundreds of human beings within a\r\nspace in which life is almost impossible, still we should be bound to\r\nlet that American vessel pass on. But the right we claim is to know\r\nwhether a vessel pretending to be American, and hoisting the American\r\nflag, be _bona fide_ American.\"\r\n\r\nThe President's message is regarded as holding opinions in opposition to\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nThe British government, then, supposes that the right of visit and the\r\nright of search are essentially distinct in their nature, and that this\r\ndifference is well known and generally acknowledged; that the difference\r\nbetween them consists in their different objects and purposes: one, the\r\nvisit, having for its object nothing but to ascertain the nationality of\r\nthe vessel; the other, the search, by an inquisition, not only into the\r\nnationality of the vessel, but the nature and object of her voyage, and\r\nthe true ownership of her cargo.\r\n\r\nThe government of the United States, on the other hand, maintains that\r\nthere is no such well-known and acknowledged, nor, indeed, any broad and\r\ngeneric difference between what has been usually called visit, and what\r\nhas been usually called search; that the right of visit, to be\r\neffectual, must come, in the end, to include search; and thus to\r\nexercise, in peace, an authority which the law of nations only allows in\r\ntimes of war. If such well-known distinction exists, where are the\r\nproofs of it? What writers of authority on public law, what\r\nadjudications in courts of admiralty, what public treaties, recognize\r\nit? No such recognition has presented itself to the government of the\r\nUnited States; but, on the contrary, it understands that public writers,\r\ncourts of law, and solemn treaties have, for two centuries, used the\r\nwords \"visit\" and \"search\" in the same sense. What Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States mean by the \"right of search,\" in its broadest sense, is\r\ncalled by Continental writers and jurists by no other name than the\r\n\"right of visit.\" Visit, therefore, as it has been understood, implies\r\nnot only a right to inquire into the national character, but to detain\r\nthe vessel, to stop the progress of the voyage, to examine papers, to\r\ndecide on their regularity and authenticity, and to make inquisition on\r\nboard for enemy's property, and into the business which the vessel is\r\nengaged in. In other words, it describes the entire right of belligerent\r\nvisitation and search. Such a right is justly disclaimed by the British\r\ngovernment in time of peace. They, nevertheless, insist on a right which\r\nthey denominate a right of visit, and by that word describe the claim\r\nwhich they assert. It is proper, and due to the importance and delicacy\r\nof the questions involved, to take care that, in discussing them, both\r\ngovernments understand the terms which may be used in the same sense.\r\nIf, indeed, it should be manifest that the difference between the\r\nparties is only verbal, it might be hoped that no harm would be done;\r\nbut the government of the United States thinks itself not justly\r\nchargeable with excessive jealousy, or with too great scrupulosity in\r\nthe use of words, in insisting on its opinion that there is no such\r\ndistinction as the British government maintains between visit and\r\nsearch; and that there is no right to visit in time of peace, except in\r\nthe execution of revenue laws or other municipal regulations, in which\r\ncases the right is usually exercised near the coast, or within the\r\nmarine league, or where the vessel is justly suspected of violating the\r\nlaw of nations by piratical aggression; but, wherever exercised, it is a\r\nright of search.\r\n\r\nNor can the United States government agree that the term \"right\" is\r\njustly applied to such exercise of power as the British government\r\nthinks it indispensable to maintain in certain cases. The right asserted\r\nis a right to ascertain whether a merchant-vessel is justly entitled to\r\nthe protection of the flag which she may happen to have hoisted, such\r\nvessel being in circumstances which render her liable to the suspicion,\r\nfirst, that she is not entitled to the protection of the flag; and\r\nsecondly, that, if not entitled to it, she is, either by the law of\r\nEngland, as an English vessel, or under the provisions of treaties with\r\ncertain European powers, subject to the supervision and search of\r\nBritish cruisers. And yet Lord Aberdeen says, \"that if, in the exercise\r\nof this right, either from involuntary error, or in spite of every\r\nprecaution, loss or injury should be sustained, a prompt reparation\r\nwould be afforded.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to perceive how these consequences can be admitted justly\r\nto flow from the fair exercise of a clear right. If injury be produced\r\nby the exercise of a right, it would seem strange that it should be\r\nrepaired, as if it had been the effect of a wrongful act. The general\r\nrule of law certainly is, that, in the proper and prudent exercise of\r\nhis own right, no one is answerable for undesigned injuries. It may be\r\nsaid that the right is a qualified right; that it is a right to do\r\ncertain acts of force at the risk of turning out to be wrong-doers, and\r\nof being made answerable for all damages. But such an argument would\r\nprove every trespass to be matter of right, subject only to just\r\nresponsibility. If force were allowed to such reasoning in other cases,\r\nit would follow that an individual's right in his own property was\r\nhardly more than a well-founded claim for compensation if he should be\r\ndeprived of it. But compensation is that which is rendered for injury,\r\nand is not commutation, or forced equivalent, for acknowledged rights.\r\nIt implies, at least in its general interpretation the commission of\r\nsome wrongful act.\r\n\r\nBut, without pressing further these inquiries into the accuracy and\r\npropriety of definitions and the use of words, I proceed to draw your\r\nattention to the thing itself, and to consider what these acts are which\r\nthe British government insists its cruisers have a right to perform, and\r\nto what consequences they naturally and necessarily tend. An eminent\r\nmember of the House of Commons[1] thus states the British claim, and his\r\nstatement is acquiesced in and adopted by the first minister of the\r\ncrown:--\r\n\r\n\"The claim of this country is for the right of our cruisers to ascertain\r\nwhether a merchant-vessel is justly entitled to the protection of the\r\nflag which she may happen to have hoisted, such vessel being in\r\ncircumstances which rendered her liable to the suspicion, first, that\r\nshe was not entitled to the protection of the flag; and, secondly, if\r\nnot entitled to it, she was, either under the law of nations or the\r\nprovisions of treaties, subject to the supervision and control of our\r\ncruisers.\"\r\n\r\nNow the question is, _By what means_ is this ascertainment to be\r\neffected?\r\n\r\nAs we understand the general and settled rules of public law, in respect\r\nto ships of war sailing under the authority of their government, \"to\r\narrest pirates and other public offenders,\" there is no reason why they\r\nmay not approach any vessels descried at sea for the purpose of\r\nascertaining their real characters. Such a right of approach seems\r\nindispensable for the fair and discreet exercise of their authority; and\r\nthe use of it cannot he justly deemed indicative of any design to insult\r\nor injure those they approach, or to impede them in their lawful\r\ncommerce. On the other hand, it is as clear that no ship is, under such\r\ncircumstances, bound to lie by or wait the approach of any other ship.\r\nShe is at full liberty to pursue her voyage in her own way, and to use\r\nall necessary precautions to avoid any suspected sinister enterprise or\r\nhostile attack. Her right to the free use of the ocean is as perfect as\r\nthat of any other ship. An entire equality is presumed to exist. She has\r\na right to consult her own safety, but at the same time she must take\r\ncare not to violate the rights of others. She may use any precautions\r\ndictated by the prudence or fears of her officers, either as to delay,\r\nor the progress or course of her voyage; but she is not at liberty to\r\ninflict injuries upon other innocent parties simply because of\r\nconjectural dangers.\r\n\r\nBut if the vessel thus approached attempts to avoid the vessel\r\napproaching, or does not comply with her commander's order to send him\r\nher papers for his inspection, nor consent to be visited or detained,\r\nwhat is next to be done? Is force to be used? And if force be used, may\r\nthat force be lawfully repelled? These questions lead at once to the\r\nelemental principle, the essence of the British claim. Suppose the\r\nmerchant-vessel be in truth an American vessel engaged in lawful\r\ncommerce, and that she does not choose to be detained. Suppose she\r\nresists the visit. What is the consequence? In all cases in which the\r\nbelligerent right of visit exists, resistance to the exercise of that\r\nright is regarded as just cause of condemnation, both of vessel and\r\ncargo. Is that penalty, or what other penalty, to be incurred by\r\nresistance to visit in time of peace? Or suppose that force be met by\r\nforce, gun returned for gun, and the commander of the cruiser, or some\r\nof his seamen be killed; what description of offence will have been\r\ncommitted? It would be said, in behalf of the commander of the cruiser,\r\nthat he mistook the vessel for a vessel of England, Brazil, or Portugal;\r\nbut does this mistake of his take away from the American vessel the\r\nright of self-defence? The writers of authority declare it to be a\r\nprinciple of natural law, that the privilege of self-defence exists\r\nagainst an assailant who mistakes the object of his attack for another\r\nwhom he had a right to assail.\r\n\r\nLord Aberdeen cannot fail to see, therefore, what serious consequences\r\nmight ensue, if it were to be admitted that this claim to visit, in time\r\nof peace, however limited or defined, should be permitted to exist as a\r\nstrict matter of right; for if it exist as a right, it must be followed\r\nby corresponding duties and obligations, and the failure to fulfil those\r\nduties would naturally draw penal consequences after it, till erelong it\r\nwould become, in truth, little less, or little other, than the\r\nbelligerent right of search.\r\n\r\nIf visit or visitation be not accompanied by search, it will be in most\r\ncases merely idle. A sight of papers may be demanded, and papers may be\r\nproduced. But it is known that slave-traders carry false papers, and\r\ndifferent sets of papers. A search for other papers, then, must be made\r\nwhere suspicion justifies it, or else the whole proceeding would be\r\nnugatory. In suspicious cases, the language and general appearance of\r\nthe crew are among the means of ascertaining the national character of\r\nthe vessel. The cargo on board, also, often indicates the country from\r\nwhich she comes. Her log-books, showing the previous course and events\r\nof her voyage, her internal fitting up and equipment, are all evidences\r\nfor her, or against her, on her allegation of character. These matters,\r\nit is obvious, can only be ascertained by rigorous search.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, If a vessel may not be called on to show her papers,\r\nwhy does she carry papers? No doubt she may be called on to show her\r\npapers; but the question is, Where, when, and by whom? Not in time of\r\npeace, on the high seas, where her rights are equal to the rights of any\r\nother vessel, and where none has a right to molest her. The use of her\r\npapers is, in time of war, to prove her neutrality when visited by\r\nbelligerent cruisers; and in both peace and war, to show her national\r\ncharacter, and the lawfulness of her voyage, in those ports of other\r\ncountries to which she may proceed for purposes of trade.\r\n\r\nIt appears to the government of the United States, that the view of this\r\nwhole subject which is the most naturally taken is also the most legal,\r\nand most in analogy with other cases. British cruisers have a right to\r\ndetain British merchantmen for certain purposes; and they have a right,\r\nacquired by treaty, to detain merchant-vessels of several other nations\r\nfor the same purposes. But they have no right at all to detain an\r\nAmerican merchant-vessel. This Lord Aberdeen admits in the fullest\r\nmanner. Any detention of an American vessel by a British cruiser is\r\ntherefore a wrong, a trespass; although it may be done under the belief\r\nthat she was a British vessel, or that she belonged to a nation which\r\nhad conceded the right of such detention to the British cruisers, and\r\nthe trespass therefore an involuntary trespass. If a ship of war, in\r\nthick weather, or in the darkness of the night, fire upon and sink a\r\nneutral vessel, under the belief that she is an enemy's vessel, this is\r\na trespass, a mere wrong; and cannot be said to be an act done under any\r\nright, accompanied by responsibility for damages. So if a civil officer\r\non land have process against one individual, and through mistake arrest\r\nanother, this arrest is wholly tortious; no one would think of saying\r\nthat it was done under any lawful exercise of authority, subject only to\r\nresponsibility, or that it was any thing but a mere trespass, though an\r\nunintentional trespass. The municipal law does not undertake to lay down\r\nbeforehand any rule for the government of such cases; and as little, in\r\nthe opinion of the government of the United States, does the public law\r\nof the world lay down beforehand any rule for the government of cases of\r\ninvoluntary trespasses, detentions, and injuries at sea; except that in\r\nboth classes of cases law and reason make a distinction between injuries\r\ncommitted through mistake and injuries committed by design, the former\r\nbeing entitled to fair and just compensation, the latter demanding\r\nexemplary damages, and sometimes personal punishment. The government of\r\nthe United States has frequently made known its opinion, which it now\r\nrepeats, that the practice of detaining American vessels, though subject\r\nto just compensation if such detention afterward turn out to have been\r\nwithout good cause, however guarded by instructions, or however\r\ncautiously exercised, necessarily leads to serious inconvenience and\r\ninjury. The amount of loss cannot be always well ascertained.\r\nCompensation, if it be adequate in the amount, may still necessarily be\r\nlong delayed; and the pendency of such claims always proves troublesome\r\nto the governments of both countries. These detentions, too, frequently\r\nirritate individuals, cause warm blood, and produce nothing but ill\r\neffects on the amicable relations existing between the countries. We\r\nwish, therefore, to put an end to them, and to avoid all occasions for\r\ntheir recurrence.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the government of the United States, while it has not\r\nconceded a mutual right of visit or search, as has been done by the\r\nparties to the quintuple treaty of December, 1841, does not admit that,\r\nby the law and practice of nations, there is any such thing as a right\r\nof visit, distinguished by well-known rules and definitions from the\r\nright of search.\r\n\r\nIt does not admit that visit of American merchant-vessels by British\r\ncruisers is founded on any right, notwithstanding the cruiser may\r\nsuppose such vessel to be British, Brazilian, or Portuguese. We cannot\r\nbut see that the detention and examination of American vessels by\r\nBritish cruisers has already led to consequences, and fear that, if\r\ncontinued, it would still lead to further consequences, highly injurious\r\nto the lawful commerce of the United States.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the government of the United States fully admits that\r\nits flag can give no immunity to pirates, nor to any other than to\r\nregularly documented American vessels. It was upon this view of the\r\nwhole case, and with a firm conviction of the truth of these sentiments,\r\nthat it cheerfully assumed the duties contained in the treaty of\r\nWashington; in the hope that thereby causes of difficulty and difference\r\nmight be altogether removed, and that the two powers might be enabled to\r\nact concurrently, cordially, and effectually for the suppression of a\r\ntraffic which both regard as a reproach upon the civilization of the\r\nage, and at war with every principle of humanity and every Christian\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\nThe government of the United States has no interest, nor is it under the\r\ninfluence of any opinions, which should lead it to desire any derogation\r\nof the just authority and rights of maritime power. But in the\r\nconvictions which it entertains, and in the measures which it has\r\nadopted, it has been governed solely by a sincere desire to support\r\nthose principles and those practices which it believes to be conformable\r\nto public law, and favorable to the peace and harmony of nations.\r\n\r\nBoth houses of Congress, with a remarkable degree of unanimity, have\r\nmade express provisions for carrying into effect the eighth article of\r\nthe treaty. An American squadron will immediately proceed to the coast\r\nof Africa. Instructions for its commander are in the course of\r\npreparation, and copies will be furnished to the British government; and\r\nthe President confidently believes, that the cordial concurrence of the\r\ntwo governments in the mode agreed on will be more effectual than any\r\nefforts yet made for the suppression of the slave-trade.\r\n\r\nYou will read this despatch to Lord Aberdeen, and, if he desire it, give\r\nhim a copy.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nEDWARD EVERETT, ESQ., &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Wood, now Sir Charles Wood, Chancellor of the\r\nExchequer.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS TO GENERAL CASS ON THE TREATY OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Webster to General Cass._\r\n\r\nDepartment of State, Washington,\r\nAugust 29, 1842.\r\n\r\nSir,--You will see by the enclosed the result of the negotiations lately\r\nhad in this city between this department and Lord Ashburton. The treaty\r\nhas been ratified by the President and Senate.\r\n\r\nIn communicating to you this treaty, I am directed by the President to\r\ndraw your particular attention to those articles which relate to the\r\nsuppression of the African slave-trade.\r\n\r\nAfter full and anxious consideration of this very delicate subject, the\r\ngovernment of the United States has come to the conclusion which you\r\nwill see expressed in the President's message to the Senate accompanying\r\nthe treaty.\r\n\r\nWithout intending or desiring to influence the policy of other\r\ngovernments on this important subject, this government has reflected on\r\nwhat was due to its own character and position, as the leading maritime\r\npower on the American continent, left free to make choice of such means\r\nfor the fulfilment of its duties as it should deem best suited to its\r\ndignity. The result of its reflections has been, that it does not concur\r\nin measures which, for whatever benevolent purpose they may be adopted,\r\nor with whatever care and moderation they may be exercised, have yet a\r\ntendency to place the police of the seas in the hands of a single power.\r\nIt chooses rather to follow its own laws with its own sanction, and to\r\ncarry them into execution by its own authority. Disposed to act in the\r\nspirit of the most cordial concurrence with other nations for the\r\nsuppression of the African slave-trade, that great reproach of our\r\ntimes, it deems it to be right, nevertheless, that this action, though\r\nconcurrent, should be independent, and it believes that from this\r\nindependence it will derive a greater degree of efficiency.\r\n\r\nYou will perceive, however, that, in the opinion of this government,\r\ncruising against slave-dealers on the coast of Africa is not all which\r\nis necessary to be done in order to put an end to the traffic. There are\r\nmarkets for slaves, or the unhappy natives of Africa would not be\r\nseized, chained, and carried over the ocean into slavery. These markets\r\nought to be shut. And, in the treaty now communicated to you, the high\r\ncontracting parties have stipulated \"that they will unite, in all\r\nbecoming representations and remonstrances, with any and all powers\r\nwithin whose dominions such markets are allowed to exist; and that they\r\nwill urge upon all such powers the propriety and duty of closing such\r\nmarkets effectually, at once and for ever.\"\r\n\r\nYou are furnished, then, with the American policy in regard to this\r\ninteresting subject. First, independent but cordially concurrent efforts\r\nof maritime states to suppress, as far as possible, the trade on the\r\ncoast, by means of competent and well-appointed squadrons, to watch the\r\nshores and scour the neighboring seas. Secondly, concurrent, becoming\r\nremonstrance with all governments who tolerate within their territories\r\nmarkets for the purchase of African negroes. There is much reason to\r\nbelieve that, if other states, professing equal hostility to this\r\nnefarious traffic, would give their own powerful concurrence and\r\nco-operation to these remonstrances, the general effect would be\r\nsatisfactory, and that the cupidity and crimes of individuals would at\r\nlength cease to find both their temptation and their reward in the bosom\r\nof Christian states, and in the permission of Christian governments.\r\n\r\nIt will still remain for each government to revise, execute, and make\r\nmore effectual its own municipal laws against its subjects or citizens\r\nwho shall be concerned in, or in any way give aid or countenance to\r\nothers concerned in this traffic.\r\n\r\nYou are at liberty to make the contents of this despatch known to the\r\nFrench government.\r\n\r\nI have, &c.\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nLEWIS CASS, ESQ., &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mr. F. Webster to General Cass._\r\n\r\nDepartment of State, Washington,\r\nOctober 11, 1842.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch of the 17th of\r\nSeptember last, requesting permission to return home.\r\n\r\nI have submitted the despatch to the President, and am by him directed\r\nto say, that although he much regrets that your own wishes should, at\r\nthis time, terminate your mission to the court of France, where for a\r\nlong period you have rendered your country distinguished service, in all\r\ninstances to its honor and to the satisfaction of the government, and\r\nwhere you occupy so favorable a position, from the more than ordinary\r\ngood intelligence which is understood to subsist between you,\r\npersonally, and the members of the French government, and from the\r\nesteem entertained for you by its illustrious head; yet he cannot refuse\r\nyour request to return once more to your home and your country, so that\r\nyou can pay that attention to your personal and private affairs which\r\nyour long absence and constant employment in the service of your\r\ngovernment may now render most necessary.\r\n\r\nI have, Sir, to tender you, on behalf of the President, his most cordial\r\ngood wishes, and am, &c.\r\n\r\nFLETCHER WEBSTER,\r\n_Acting Secretary of State_.\r\n\r\nLEWIS CASS, ESQ., &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mr. Webster to General Cass._\r\n\r\nDepartment of State, Washington,\r\nNovember 14, 1842.\r\n\r\nSir,--I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch of\r\nthe 3d of October, brought by the \"Great Western,\" which arrived at New\r\nYork on the 6th instant.\r\n\r\nIt is probable you will have embarked for the United States before my\r\ncommunication can now reach you; but as it is thought proper that your\r\nletter should be answered, and as circumstances may possibly have\r\noccurred to delay your departure, this will be transmitted to Paris in\r\nthe ordinary way.\r\n\r\nYour letter has caused the President considerable concern. Entertaining\r\na lively sense of the respectable and useful manner in which you have\r\ndischarged, for several years, the duties of an important foreign\r\nmission, it occasions him real regret and pain, that your last official\r\ncommunication should be of such a character as that he cannot give to it\r\nhis entire and cordial approbation.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be intended as a sort of protest, a remonstrance, in the\r\nform of an official despatch, against a transaction of the government to\r\nwhich you were not a party, in which you had no agency whatever, and for\r\nthe results of which you were no way answerable. This would seem an\r\nunusual and extraordinary proceeding. In common with every other citizen\r\nof the republic, you have an unquestionable right to form opinions upon\r\npublic transactions, and the conduct of public men; but it will hardly\r\nbe thought to be among either the duties or the privileges of a minister\r\nabroad to make formal remonstrances and protests against proceedings of\r\nthe various branches of the government at home, upon subjects in\r\nrelation to which he himself has not been charged with any duty or\r\npartaken any responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation and conclusion of the treaty of Washington were in the\r\nhands of the President and Senate. They had acted upon this important\r\nsubject according to their convictions of duty and of the public\r\ninterest, and had ratified the treaty. It was a thing done; and although\r\nyour opinion might be at variance with that of the President and Senate,\r\nit is not perceived that you had any cause of complaint, remonstrance,\r\nor protest, more than any other citizen who might entertain the same\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nIn your letter of the 17th of September, requesting your recall, you\r\nobserve: \"The mail by the steam-packet which left Boston the 1st instant\r\nhas just arrived, and has brought intelligence of the ratification of\r\nthe treaties recently concluded with Great Britain. All apprehensions,\r\ntherefore, of any immediate difficulties with that country are at an\r\nend, and I do not see that any public interest demands my further\r\nresidence in Europe. I can no longer be useful here, and the state of\r\nmy private affairs requires my presence at home. Under these\r\ncircumstances, I beg you to submit to the President my wish for\r\npermission to retire from this mission, and to return to the United\r\nStates without delay.\"\r\n\r\nAs you appeared at that time not to be acquainted with the provisions of\r\nthe treaty, it was inferred that your desire to return home proceeded\r\nfrom the conviction _that, inasmuch as all apprehensions of immediate\r\ndifferences with Great Britain were at an end_, you would no longer be\r\nuseful at Paris. Placing this interpretation on your letter, and\r\nbelieving, as you yourself allege, that your long absence abroad\r\nrendered it desirable for you to give some attention to your private\r\naffairs in this country, the President lost no time in yielding to your\r\nrequest, and, in doing so, signified to you the sentiments of\r\napprobation which he entertained for your conduct abroad. You may, then,\r\nwell imagine the great astonishment which the declaration contained in\r\nyour despatch of the 3d of October, that you could no longer remain in\r\nFrance honorably to yourself or advantageously to the country, and that\r\nthe proceedings of this government had placed you in a false position,\r\nfrom which you could escape only by returning home, created in his mind.\r\n\r\nThe President perceives not the slightest foundation for these opinions.\r\nHe cannot see how your usefulness as minister to France should be\r\nterminated by the settlement of difficulties and disputes between the\r\nUnited States and Great Britain. You have been charged with no duties\r\nconnected with the settlement of these questions, or in any way relating\r\nto them, beyond the communication to the French government of the\r\nPresident's approbation of your letter of the 13th of February, written\r\nwithout previous instructions from this department. This government is\r\nnot informed of any other act or proceeding of yours connected with any\r\npart of the subject, nor does it know that your official conduct and\r\ncharacter have become in any other way connected with the question of\r\nthe right of search; and that letter having been approved, and the\r\nFrench government having been so informed, the President is altogether\r\nat a loss to understand how you can regard yourself as placed in a false\r\nposition. If the character or conduct of any one was to be affected, it\r\ncould only be the character and conduct of the President himself. The\r\ngovernment has done nothing, most assuredly, to place you in a false\r\nposition. Representing your country at a foreign court, you saw a\r\ntransaction about to take place between the government to which you were\r\naccredited and another power, which you thought might have a prejudicial\r\neffect on the interest of your own country. Thinking, as it is to be\r\npresumed, that the case was too pressing to wait for instructions, you\r\npresented a protest against that transaction, and our government\r\napproved your proceeding. This is your only official connection with the\r\nwhole subject. If after this the President had sanctioned the\r\nnegotiation of a treaty, and the Senate had ratified it, containing\r\nprovisions in the highest degree objectionable, however the government\r\nmight be discredited, your exemption from all blame and censure would\r\nhave been complete. Having delivered your letter of the 13th of February\r\nto the French government, and having received the President's\r\napprobation of that proceeding, it is most manifest that you could be in\r\nno degree responsible for what should be done afterward, and done by\r\nothers. The President, therefore, cannot conceive what particular or\r\npersonal interest of yours was affected by the subsequent negotiation\r\nhere, or how the treaty, the result of that negotiation, should put an\r\nend to your usefulness as a public minister at the court of France, or\r\nin any way affect your official character or conduct.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to see that such a proceeding as you have seen fit\r\nto adopt might produce much inconvenience, and even serious prejudice,\r\nto the public interests. Your opinion is against the treaty, a treaty\r\nconcluded and formally ratified; and, to support that opinion, while yet\r\nin the service of the government, you put a construction on its\r\nprovisions such as your own government does not put upon them, such as\r\nyou must be aware the enlightened public of Europe does not put upon\r\nthem, and such as England herself has not put upon them as yet, so far\r\nas we know.\r\n\r\nIt may become necessary hereafter to publish your letter, in connection\r\nwith other correspondence of the mission; and although it is not to be\r\npresumed that you looked to such publication, because such a presumption\r\nwould impute to you a claim to put forth your private opinions upon the\r\nconduct of the President and Senate, in a transaction finished and\r\nconcluded, through the imposing form of a public despatch, yet, if\r\npublished, it cannot be foreseen how far England might hereafter rely\r\non your authority for a construction favorable to her own pretensions,\r\nand inconsistent with the interest and honor of the United States. It is\r\ncertain that you would most sedulously desire to avoid any such\r\nattitude. You would be slow to express opinions, in a solemn and\r\nofficial form, favorable to another government, and on the authority of\r\nwhich opinions that other government might hereafter found new claims or\r\nset up new pretensions. It is for this reason, as well as others, that\r\nthe President feels so much regret at your desire of placing your\r\nconstruction of the provisions of the treaty, and your objections to\r\nthose provisions, according to your construction, upon the records of\r\nthe government.\r\n\r\nBefore examining the several objections suggested by you, it may be\r\nproper to take notice of what you say upon the course of the\r\nnegotiation. In regard to this, having observed that the national\r\ndignity of the United States had not been compromised down to the time\r\nof the President's message to the last session of Congress, you proceed\r\nto say: \"But England then urged the United States to enter into a\r\nconventional arrangement, by which we might be pledged to concur with\r\nher in measures for the suppression of the slave-trade. Till then we had\r\nexecuted our own laws in our own way. But, yielding to this application,\r\nand departing from our former principle of avoiding European\r\ncombinations upon subjects not American, we stipulated in a solemn\r\ntreaty, that we would carry into effect our own laws, and fixed the\r\nminimum force we would employ for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe President cannot conceive how you should have been led to adventure\r\nupon such a statement as this. It is but a tissue of mistakes. England\r\ndid not urge the United States to enter into this conventional\r\narrangement. The United States yielded to no application from England.\r\nThe proposition for abolishing the slave-trade, as it stands in the\r\ntreaty, was an American proposition; it originated with the executive\r\ngovernment of the United States, which cheerfully assumes all its\r\nresponsibility. It stands upon it as its own mode of fulfilling its\r\nduties, and accomplishing its objects. Nor have the United States\r\ndeparted, in this treaty, in the slightest degree, from their former\r\nprinciples of avoiding European combinations upon subjects not American,\r\nbecause the abolition of the African slave-trade is an American subject\r\nas emphatically as it is a European subject; and indeed more so,\r\ninasmuch as the government of the United States took the first great\r\nsteps in declaring that trade unlawful, and in attempting its\r\nextinction. The abolition of this traffic is an object of the highest\r\ninterest to the American people and the American government; and you\r\nseem strangely to have overlooked altogether the important fact, that\r\nnearly thirty years ago, by the treaty of Ghent, the United States bound\r\nthemselves by solemn compact with England, to continue \"their efforts to\r\npromote its entire abolition,\" both parties pledging themselves by that\r\ntreaty to use their best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object.\r\n\r\nAgain, you speak of an important concession made to the renewed\r\napplication of England. But the treaty, let it be repeated, makes no\r\nconcession to England whatever. It complies with no demand, grants no\r\napplication, conforms to no request. All these statements, thus by you\r\nmade, and which are so exceedingly erroneous, seem calculated to hold up\r\nthe idea, that in this treaty your government has been acting a\r\nsubordinate, or even a complying part.\r\n\r\nThe President is not a little startled that you should make such totally\r\ngroundless assumptions of fact, and then leave a discreditable inference\r\nto be drawn from them. He directs me not only to repel this inference as\r\nit ought to be repelled, but also to bring to your serious consideration\r\nand reflection the propriety of such an assumed narration of facts as\r\nyour despatch, in this respect, puts forth.\r\n\r\nHaving informed the department that a copy of the letter of the 24th of\r\nAugust, addressed by me to you, had been delivered to M. Guizot, you\r\nproceed to say: \"In executing this duty, I felt too well what was due to\r\nmy government and country to intimate my regret to a foreign power that\r\nsome declaration had not preceded the treaty, or some stipulation\r\naccompanied it, by which the extraordinary pretension of Great Britain\r\nto search our ships at all times and in all places, first put forth to\r\nthe world by Lord Palmerston on the 27th of August, 1841, and on the\r\n13th of October following again peremptorily claimed as a right by Lord\r\nAberdeen, would have been abrogated, as equally incompatible with the\r\nlaws of nations and with the independence of the United States. I\r\nconfined myself, therefore, to a simple communication of your letter.\"\r\nIt may be true that the British pretension leads necessarily to\r\nconsequences as broad and general as your statement. But it is no more\r\nthan fair to state that pretension in the words of the British\r\ngovernment itself, and then it becomes matter of consideration and\r\nargument how broad and extensive it really is. The last statement of\r\nthis pretension, or claim, by the British government, is contained in\r\nLord Aberdeen's note to Mr. Stevenson of the 13th of October, 1841. It\r\nis in these words:--\r\n\r\n     \"The undersigned readily admits, that to visit and search American\r\n     vessels in time of peace, when that right of search is not granted\r\n     by treaty, would be an infraction of public law, and a violation of\r\n     national dignity and independence. But no such right is asserted.\r\n     We sincerely desire to respect the vessels of the United States,\r\n     but we may reasonably expect to know what it really is that we\r\n     respect. Doubtless the flag is _prima facie_ evidence of the\r\n     nationality of the vessel; and, if this evidence were in its nature\r\n     conclusive and irrefragable, it ought to preclude all further\r\n     inquiry. But it is sufficiently notorious that the flags of all\r\n     nations are liable to be assumed by those who have no right or\r\n     title to bear them. Mr. Stevenson himself fully admits the extent\r\n     to which the American flag has been employed for the purpose of\r\n     covering this infamous traffic. The undersigned joins with Mr.\r\n     Stevenson in deeply lamenting the evil; and he agrees with him in\r\n     thinking that the United States ought not to be considered\r\n     responsible for this abuse of their flag. But if all inquiry be\r\n     resisted, even when carried no further than to ascertain the\r\n     nationality of the vessel, and impunity be claimed for the most\r\n     lawless and desperate of mankind, in the commission of this fraud,\r\n     the undersigned greatly fears that it may be regarded as something\r\n     like an assumption of that responsibility which has been deprecated\r\n     by Mr. Stevenson....\r\n\r\n     \"The undersigned renounces all pretension on the part of the\r\n     British government to visit and search American vessels in time of\r\n     peace. Nor is it as American that such vessels are ever visited;\r\n     but, it has been the invariable practice of the British navy, and,\r\n     as the undersigned believes, of all navies in the world, to\r\n     ascertain by visit the real nationality of merchant-vessels met\r\n     with on the high seas, if there be good reason to apprehend their\r\n     illegal character....\r\n\r\n     \"The undersigned admits, that, if the British cruiser should\r\n     possess a knowledge of the American character of any vessel, his\r\n     visitation of such vessel would be entirely unjustifiable. He\r\n     further admits, that so much respect and honor are due to the\r\n     American flag, that no vessel bearing it ought to be visited by a\r\n     British cruiser, except under the most grave suspicions and\r\n     well-founded doubts of the genuineness of its character.\r\n\r\n     \"The undersigned, although with pain, must add, that if such visit\r\n     should lead to the proof of the American origin of the vessel, and\r\n     that she was avowedly engaged in the slave-trade, exhibiting to\r\n     view the manacles, fetters, and other usual implements of torture,\r\n     or had even a number of these unfortunate beings on board, no\r\n     British officer could interfere further. He might give information\r\n     to the cruisers of the United States, but it could not be in his\r\n     own power to arrest or impede the prosecution of the voyage and the\r\n     success of the undertaking.\r\n\r\n     \"It is obvious, therefore, that the utmost caution is necessary in\r\n     the exercise of this right claimed by Great Britain. While we have\r\n     recourse to the necessary, and, indeed, the only means for\r\n     detecting imposture, the practice will be carefully guarded and\r\n     limited to cases of strong suspicion. The undersigned begs to\r\n     assure Mr. Stevenson that the most precise and positive\r\n     instructions have been issued to her Majesty's officers on this\r\n     subject.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are the words of the British claim or pretension; and it stood in\r\nthis form at the delivery of the President's message to Congress in\r\nDecember last; a message in which you are pleased to say that the\r\nBritish pretension was promptly met and firmly resisted.\r\n\r\nI may now proceed to a more particular examination of the objections\r\nwhich you make to the treaty.\r\n\r\nYou observe that you think a just self-respect required of the\r\ngovernment of the United States to demand of Lord Ashburton a distinct\r\nrenunciation of the British claim to search our vessels previous to\r\nentering into any negotiation. The government has thought otherwise; and\r\nthis appears to be your main objection to the treaty, if, indeed, it be\r\nnot the only one which is clearly and distinctly stated. The government\r\nof the United States supposed that, in this respect, it stood in a\r\nposition in which it had no occasion to demand any thing, or ask for any\r\nthing, of England. The British pretension, whatever it was, or however\r\nextensive, was well known to the President at the date of his message to\r\nCongress at the opening of the last session. And I must be allowed to\r\nremind you how the President treated this subject in that communication.\r\n\r\n     \"However desirous the United States may be,\" said he, \"for the\r\n     suppression of the slave-trade, they cannot consent to\r\n     interpolations into the maritime code at the mere will and pleasure\r\n     of other governments. We deny the right of any such interpolation\r\n     to any one, or all the nations of the earth, without our consent.\r\n     We claim to have a voice in all amendments or alterations of that\r\n     code; and when we are given to understand, as in this instance, by\r\n     a foreign government, that its treaties with other nations cannot\r\n     be executed without the establishment and enforcement of new\r\n     principles of maritime police, to be applied without our consent,\r\n     we must employ a language neither of equivocal import nor\r\n     susceptible of misconstruction. American citizens prosecuting a\r\n     lawful commerce in the African seas, under the flag of their\r\n     country, are not responsible for the abuse or unlawful use of that\r\n     flag by others; nor can they rightfully, on account of any such\r\n     alleged abuses, be interrupted, molested, or detained while on the\r\n     ocean; and if thus molested and detained while pursuing honest\r\n     voyages in the usual way, and violating no law themselves, they are\r\n     unquestionably entitled to indemnity.\"\r\n\r\nThis declaration of the President stands: not a syllable of it has been,\r\nor will be, retracted. The principles which it announces rest on their\r\ninherent justice and propriety, on their conformity to public law, and,\r\nso far as we are concerned, on the determination and ability of the\r\ncountry to maintain them. To these principles the government is pledged,\r\nand that pledge it will be at all times ready to redeem.\r\n\r\nBut what is your own language on this point? You say, \"This claim (the\r\nBritish claim), thus asserted and supported, was promptly met and firmly\r\nrepelled by the President in his message at the commencement of the last\r\nsession of Congress; and in your letter to me approving the course I had\r\nadopted in relation to the question of the ratification by France of the\r\nquintuple treaty, you consider the principles of that message as the\r\nestablished policy of the government.\" And you add, \"So far, our\r\nnational dignity was uncompromitted.\" If this be so, what is there which\r\nhas since occurred to compromit this dignity? You shall yourself be\r\njudge of this; because you say, in a subsequent part of your letter,\r\nthat \"the mutual rights of the parties are in this respect wholly\r\nuntouched.\" If, then, the British pretension had been promptly met and\r\nfirmly repelled by the President's message; if, so far, our national\r\ndignity had not been compromitted; and if, as you further say, our\r\nrights remain wholly untouched by any subsequent act or proceeding, what\r\nground is there on which to found complaint against the treaty?\r\n\r\nBut your sentiments on this point do not concur with the opinions of\r\nyour government. That government is of opinion that the sentiments of\r\nthe message, which you so highly approve, are reaffirmed and\r\ncorroborated by the treaty, and the correspondence accompanying it. The\r\nvery object sought to be obtained, in proposing the mode adopted for\r\nabolishing the slave-trade, was to take away all pretence whatever for\r\ninterrupting lawful commerce by the visitation of American vessels.\r\nAllow me to refer you, on this point, to the following passage in the\r\nmessage of the President to the Senate, accompanying the treaty:--\r\n\r\n     \"In my message at the commencement of the present session of\r\n     Congress, I endeavored to state the principles which this\r\n     government supports respecting the right of search and the immunity\r\n     of flags. Desirous of maintaining those principles fully, at the\r\n     same time that existing obligations should be fulfilled, I have\r\n     thought it most consistent with the dignity and honor of the\r\n     country that it should execute its own laws and perform its own\r\n     obligations by its own means and its own power. The examination or\r\n     visitation of the merchant-vessels of one nation by the cruisers of\r\n     another, for any purposes except those known and acknowledged by\r\n     the law of nations, under whatever restraints or regulations it may\r\n     take place, may lead to dangerous results. It is far better by\r\n     other means to supersede any supposed necessity, or any motive, for\r\n     such examination or visit. Interference with a merchant-vessel by\r\n     an armed cruiser is always a delicate proceeding, apt to touch the\r\n     point of national honor, as well as to affect the interests of\r\n     individuals. It has been thought, therefore, expedient, not only in\r\n     accordance with the stipulations of the treaty of Ghent, but at the\r\n     same time as removing all pretext on the part of others for\r\n     violating the immunities of the American flag upon the seas, as\r\n     they exist and are defined by the law of nations, to enter into the\r\n     articles now submitted to the Senate.\r\n\r\n     \"The treaty which I now submit to you proposes no alteration,\r\n     mitigation, or modification of the rules of the law of nations. It\r\n     provides simply, that each of the two governments shall maintain on\r\n     the coast of Africa a sufficient squadron to enforce, separately\r\n     and respectively, the laws, rights, and obligations of the two\r\n     countries for the suppression of the slave-trade.\"\r\n\r\nIn the actual posture of things, the President thought that the\r\ngovernment of the United States, standing on its own rights and its own\r\nsolemn declarations, would only weaken its position by making such a\r\ndemand as appears to you to have been expedient. We maintain the public\r\nlaw of the world as we receive it and understand it to be established.\r\nWe defend our own rights and our own honor, meeting all aggression at\r\nthe boundary. Here we may well stop.\r\n\r\nYou are pleased to observe, that \"under the circumstances of the\r\nassertion of the British claim, in the correspondence of the British\r\nsecretaries, and of its denial by the President of the United States,\r\nthe eyes of Europe were upon these two great naval powers; one of which\r\nhad advanced a pretension, and avowed her determination to enforce it,\r\nwhich might at any moment bring them into collision.\"\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that the attention of Europe has been very much\r\nawakened, of late years, to the general subject, and quite alive, also,\r\nto whatever might take place in regard to it between the United States\r\nand Great Britain. And it is highly satisfactory to find, that, so far\r\nas we can learn, the opinion is universal that the government of the\r\nUnited States has fully sustained its rights and its dignity by the\r\ntreaty which has been concluded. Europe, we believe, is happy to see\r\nthat a collision, which might have disturbed the peace of the whole\r\ncivilized world, has been avoided in a manner which reconciles the\r\nperformance of a high national duty, and the fulfilment of positive\r\nstipulations, with the perfect immunity of flags and the equality of\r\nnations upon the ocean. I must be permitted to add, that, from every\r\nagent of the government abroad who has been heard from on the subject,\r\nwith the single exception of your own letter, (an exception most deeply\r\nregretted,) as well as from every part of Europe where maritime rights\r\nhave advocates and defenders, we have received nothing but\r\ncongratulation. And at this moment, if the general sources of\r\ninformation may be trusted, our example has recommended itself already\r\nto the regard of states the most jealous of British ascendency at sea;\r\nand the treaty against which you remonstrate may soon come to be\r\nesteemed by them as a fit model for imitation.\r\n\r\nToward the close of your despatch, you are pleased to say: \"By the\r\nrecent treaty we are to keep a squadron upon the coast of Africa. We\r\nhave kept one there for years; during the whole term, indeed, of these\r\nefforts to put a stop to this most iniquitous commerce. The effect of\r\nthe treaty is, therefore, to render it obligatory upon us by a\r\nconvention, to do what we have long done voluntarily; to place our\r\nmunicipal laws, in some measure, beyond the reach of Congress.\" Should\r\nthe effect of the treaty be to place our municipal laws, in some\r\nmeasure, beyond the reach of Congress, it is sufficient to say that all\r\ntreaties containing obligations necessarily do this. All treaties of\r\ncommerce do it; and, indeed, there is hardly a treaty existing, to which\r\nthe United States are party, which does not, to some extent, or in some\r\nway, restrain the legislative power. Treaties could not be made without\r\nproducing this effect.\r\n\r\nBut your remark would seem to imply that, in your judgment, there is\r\nsomething derogatory to the character and dignity of the country in thus\r\nstipulating with a foreign power for a concurrent effort to execute the\r\nlaws of each. It would be a sufficient refutation of this objection to\r\nsay, that, if in this arrangement there be any thing derogatory to the\r\ncharacter and dignity of one party, it must be equally derogatory, since\r\nthe stipulation is perfectly mutual, to the character and dignity of\r\nboth. But it is derogatory to the character and dignity of neither. The\r\nobjection seems to proceed still upon the implied ground that the\r\nabolition of the slave-trade is more a duty of Great Britain, or a more\r\nleading object with her, than it is or should be with us; as if, in this\r\ngreat effort of civilized nations to do away the most cruel traffic that\r\never scourged or disgraced the world, we had not as high and honorable,\r\nas just and merciful, a part to act, as any other nation upon the face\r\nof the earth. Let it be for ever remembered, that in this great work of\r\nhumanity and justice the United States took the lead themselves. This\r\ngovernment declared the slave-trade unlawful; and in this declaration it\r\nhas been followed by the great powers of Europe. This government\r\ndeclared the slave-trade to be piracy; and in this, too, its example has\r\nbeen followed by other states. This government, this young government,\r\nspringing up in this new world within half a century, founded on the\r\nbroadest principles of civil liberty, and sustained by the moral sense\r\nand intelligence of the people, has gone in advance of all other nations\r\nin summoning the civilized world to a common effort to put down and\r\ndestroy a nefarious traffic reproachful to human nature. It has not\r\ndeemed, and it does not deem, that it suffers any derogation from its\r\ncharacter or its dignity, if, in seeking to fulfil this sacred duty, it\r\nact, as far as necessary, on fair and equal terms of concert with other\r\npowers having in view the same praiseworthy object. Such were its\r\nsentiments when it entered into the solemn stipulations of the treaty of\r\nGhent; such were its sentiments when it requested England to concur with\r\nus in declaring the slave-trade to be piracy; and such are the\r\nsentiments which it has manifested on all other proper occasions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have to repeat the expression of the President's deep\r\nregret at the general tone and character of your letter, and to assure\r\nyou of the great happiness it would have afforded him if, concurring\r\nwith the judgment of the President and Senate, concurring with what\r\nappears to be the general sense of the country, concurring in all the\r\nmanifestations of enlightened public opinion in Europe, you had seen\r\nnothing in the treaty of the 9th of August to which you could not give\r\nyour cordial approbation.\r\n\r\nI have, &c.\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nLEWIS CASS, ESQ., &c., &c., &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mr. Webster to General Cass._\r\n\r\nDepartment of State, Washington,\r\nDecember 20, 1842.\r\n\r\nSir,--Your letter of the 11th instant has been submitted to the\r\nPresident. He directs me to say, in reply, that he continues to regard\r\nyour correspondence, of which this letter is part, as being quite\r\nirregular from the beginning. You had asked leave to retire from your\r\nmission; the leave was granted by the President, with kind and friendly\r\nremarks upon the manner in which you had discharged its duties. Having\r\nasked for this honorable recall, which was promptly given, you afterward\r\naddressed to this department your letter of the 3d of October, which,\r\nhowever it may appear to you, the President cannot but consider as a\r\nremonstrance, a protest, against the treaty of the 9th of August; in\r\nother words, an attack upon his administration for the negotiation and\r\nconclusion of that treaty. He certainly was not prepared for this. It\r\ncame upon him with no small surprise, and he still feels that you must\r\nhave been, at the moment, under the influence of temporary impressions,\r\nwhich he cannot but hope have ere now worn away.\r\n\r\nA few remarks upon some of the points of your last letter must now close\r\nthe correspondence.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, you object to my having called your letter of\r\nOctober 3d a \"protest or remonstrance\" against a transaction of the\r\ngovernment, and observe that you must have been unhappy in the mode of\r\nexpressing yourself, if you were liable to this charge.\r\n\r\nWhat other construction your letter will bear, I cannot perceive. The\r\ntransaction was _finished_. No letter or remarks of yourself, or any one\r\nelse, could undo it, if desirable. Your opinions were unsolicited. If\r\ngiven as a citizen, then it was altogether unusual to address them to\r\nthis department in an official despatch; if as a public functionary, the\r\nwhole subject-matter was quite aside from the duties of your particular\r\nstation. In your letter you did not propose any thing _to be done_, but\r\nobjected to what had been done. You did not suggest any method of\r\nremedying what you were pleased to consider a defect, but stated what\r\nyou thought to be reasons for fearing its consequences. You declared\r\nthat there had been, in your opinion, an omission to assert American\r\nrights; to which omission you gave the department to understand that you\r\nwould never have consented.\r\n\r\nIn all this there is nothing but protest and remonstrance; and, though\r\nyour letter be not formally entitled such, I cannot see that it can be\r\nconstrued, in effect, as any thing else; and I must continue to think,\r\ntherefore, that the terms used are entirely applicable and proper.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, you say: \"You give me to understand that the\r\ncommunications which have passed between us on this subject are to be\r\npublished, and submitted to the great tribunal of public opinion.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have been better if you had quoted my remark with entire\r\ncorrectness. What I said was, not that the communications which have\r\npassed between us _are to be_ published, or _must_ be published, but\r\nthat \"it may become necessary hereafter to publish your letter, in\r\nconnection with other correspondence of the mission; and, although it is\r\nnot to be presumed that you looked to such publication, because such a\r\npresumption would impute to you a claim to put forth your private\r\nopinions upon the conduct of the President and Senate, in a transaction\r\nfinished and concluded, through the imposing form of a public despatch,\r\nyet, if published, it cannot be foreseen how far England might hereafter\r\nrely on your authority for a construction favorable to her own\r\npretensions, and inconsistent with the interest and honor of the United\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\nIn another part of your letter you observe: \"The publication of my\r\nletter, which is to produce this result, is to be the act of the\r\ngovernment, and not my act. But if the President should think that the\r\nslightest injury to the public interest would ensue from the disclosure\r\nof my views, the letter may be buried in the archives of the department,\r\nand thus forgotten and rendered harmless.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I have to remark, in the first place, that instances have\r\noccurred in other times, not unknown to you, in which highly important\r\nletters from ministers of the United States, in Europe, to their own\r\ngovernment, have found their way into the newspapers of Europe, when\r\nthat government itself held it to be inconsistent with the interest of\r\nthe United States to make such letters public.\r\n\r\nBut it is hardly worth while to pursue a topic like this.\r\n\r\nYou are pleased to ask: \"Is it the duty of a diplomatic agent to receive\r\nall the communications of his government, and to carry into effect their\r\ninstructions _sub silentio_, whatever may be his own sentiments in\r\nrelation to them; or is he not bound, as a faithful representative, to\r\ncommunicate freely, but respectfully, his own views, that these may be\r\nconsidered, and receive their due weight, in that particular case, or in\r\nother circumstances involving similar considerations? It seems to me\r\nthat the bare enunciation of the principle is all that is necessary for\r\nmy justification. I am speaking now of the propriety of my action, not\r\nof the manner in which it was performed. I may have executed the task\r\nwell or ill. I may have introduced topics unadvisedly, and urged them\r\nindiscreetly. All this I leave without remark. I am only endeavoring\r\nhere to free myself from the serious charge which you bring against me.\r\nIf I have misapprehended the duties of an American diplomatic agent upon\r\nthis subject, I am well satisfied to have withdrawn, by a timely\r\nresignation, from a position in which my own self-respect would not\r\npermit me to remain. And I may express the conviction, that there is no\r\ngovernment, certainly none this side of Constantinople, which would not\r\nencourage rather than rebuke the free expression of the views of their\r\nrepresentatives in foreign countries.\"\r\n\r\nI answer, certainly not. In the letter to which you were replying it was\r\nfully stated, that, \"in common with every other citizen of the republic,\r\nyou have an unquestionable right to form opinions upon public\r\ntransactions and the conduct of public men. But it will hardly be\r\nthought to be among either the duties or the privileges of a minister\r\nabroad to make formal remonstrances and protests against proceedings of\r\nthe various branches of the government at home, upon subjects in\r\nrelation to which he himself has not been charged with any duty, or\r\npartaken any responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nYou have not been requested to bestow your approbation upon the treaty,\r\nhowever gratifying it would have been to the President to see that, in\r\nthat respect, you united with other distinguished public agents abroad.\r\nLike all citizens of the republic, you are quite at liberty to exercise\r\nyour own judgment upon that as upon other transactions. But neither your\r\nobservations nor this concession cover the case. They do not show, that,\r\nas a public minister abroad, it is a part of your official functions, in\r\na public despatch, to remonstrate against the conduct of the government\r\nat home in relation to a transaction in which you bore no part, and for\r\nwhich you were in no way answerable. The President and Senate must be\r\npermitted to judge for themselves in a matter solely within their\r\ncontrol. Nor do I know that, in complaining of your protest against\r\ntheir proceedings in a case of this kind, any thing has been done to\r\nwarrant, on your part, an invidious and unjust reference to\r\nConstantinople. If you could show, by the general practice of diplomatic\r\nfunctionaries in the civilized part of the world, and more especially,\r\nif you could show by any precedent drawn from the conduct of the many\r\ndistinguished men who have represented the government of the United\r\nStates abroad, that your letter of the 3d of October was, in its general\r\nobject, tone, and character, within the usual limits of diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence, you may be quite assured that the President would not\r\nhave recourse to the code of Turkey in order to find precedents the\r\nother way.\r\n\r\nYou complain that, in the letter from this department of the 14th of\r\nNovember, a statement contained in yours of the 3d of October is called\r\na tissue of mistakes, and you attempt to show the impropriety of this\r\nappellation. Let the point be distinctly stated, and what you say in\r\nreply be then considered.\r\n\r\nIn your letter of October 3d you remark, that \"England then urged the\r\nUnited States to enter into a conventional arrangement, by which we\r\nmight be pledged to concur with her in measures for the suppression of\r\nthe slave-trade. Until then, we had executed our own laws in our own\r\nway; but, yielding to this application, and departing from our former\r\nprinciple of avoiding European combinations upon subjects not American,\r\nwe stipulated in a solemn treaty that we would carry into effect our own\r\nlaws, and fixed the minimum force we would employ for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter of this department of the 14th of November, having quoted\r\nthis passage, proceeds to observe, that \"the President cannot conceive\r\nhow you should have been led to adventure upon such a statement as this.\r\nIt is but a tissue of mistakes. England did not urge the United States\r\nto enter into this conventional arrangement. The United States yielded\r\nto no application from England. The proposition for abolishing the\r\nslave-trade, as it stands in the treaty, was an American proposition; it\r\noriginated with the executive government of the United States, which\r\ncheerfully assumes all its responsibility. It stands upon it as its own\r\nmode of fulfilling its duties and accomplishing its objects. Nor have\r\nthe United States departed in the slightest degree from their former\r\nprinciples of avoiding European combinations upon subjects not American;\r\nbecause the abolition of the African slave-trade is an American subject\r\nas emphatically as it is a European subject, and, indeed, more so,\r\ninasmuch as the government of the United States took the first great\r\nstep in declaring that trade unlawful, and in attempting its extinction.\r\nThe abolition of this traffic is an object of the highest interest to\r\nthe American people and the American government; and you seem strangely\r\nto have overlooked altogether the important fact, that nearly thirty\r\nyears ago, by the treaty of Ghent, the United States bound themselves,\r\nby solemn compact with England, to continue their efforts to promote its\r\nentire abolition; both parties pledging themselves by that treaty to use\r\ntheir best endeavors to accomplish so desirable an object.\"\r\n\r\nNow, in answer to this, you observe in your last letter: \"That the\r\nparticular mode in which the governments should act in concert, as\r\nfinally arranged in the treaty, was suggested by yourself, I never\r\ndoubted. And if this is the construction I am to give to your denial of\r\nmy correctness, there is no difficulty upon the subject. The question\r\nbetween us is untouched. All I said was, that England continued to\r\nprosecute the matter; that she presented it for negotiation, and that we\r\nthereupon consented to its introduction. And if Lord Ashburton did not\r\ncome out with instructions from his government to endeavor to effect\r\nsome arrangement upon this subject, the world has strangely\r\nmisunderstood one of the great objects of his mission, and I have\r\nmisunderstood that paragraph in your first note, where you say that Lord\r\nAshburton comes with full powers to negotiate and settle all matters in\r\ndiscussion between England and the United States. But the very fact of\r\nhis coming here, and of his acceding to any stipulations respecting the\r\nslave-trade, is conclusive proof that his government were desirous to\r\nobtain the co-operation of the United States. I had supposed that our\r\ngovernment would scarcely take the initiative in this matter, and urge\r\nit upon that of Great Britain, either in Washington or in London. If it\r\ndid so, I can only express my regret, and confess that I have been led\r\ninadvertently into an error.\"\r\n\r\nIt would appear from all this, that that which, in your first letter,\r\nappeared as a direct statement of facts, of which you would naturally be\r\npresumed to have had knowledge, sinks at last into inferences and\r\nconjectures. But, in attempting to escape from some of the mistakes of\r\nthis tissue, you have fallen into others. \"All I said was,\" you observe,\r\n\"that England continued to prosecute the matter; that she presented it\r\nfor negotiation, and that we thereupon consented to its introduction.\"\r\nNow the English minister no more presented this subject for negotiation\r\nthan the government of the United States presented it. Nor can it be\r\nsaid that the United States consented to its introduction in any other\r\nsense than it may be said that the British minister consented to it.\r\nWill you be good enough to review the series of your own assertions on\r\nthis subject, and see whether they can possibly be regarded merely as a\r\nstatement of your own inferences? Your only authentic fact is a general\r\none, that the British minister came clothed with full power to negotiate\r\nand settle all matters in discussion. This, you say, is conclusive proof\r\nthat his government was desirous to obtain the co-operation of the\r\nUnited States respecting the slave-trade; and then you infer that\r\nEngland continued to prosecute this matter, and presented it for\r\nnegotiation, and that the United States consented to its introduction;\r\nand give to this inference the shape of a direct statement of a fact.\r\n\r\nYou might have made the same remarks, and with the same propriety, in\r\nrelation to the subject of the \"Creole,\" that of impressment, the\r\nextradition of fugitive criminals, or any thing else embraced in the\r\ntreaty or in the correspondence, and then have converted these\r\ninferences of your own into so many facts. And it is upon conjectures\r\nlike these, it is upon such inferences of your own, that you make the\r\ndirect and formal statement in your letter of the 3d of October, that\r\n\"England then urged the United States to enter into a conventional\r\narrangement, by which we might be pledged to concur with her in measures\r\nfor the suppression of the slave-trade. Until then, we had executed our\r\nown laws in our own way; but, yielding to this application, and\r\ndeparting from our former principle of avoiding European combinations\r\nupon subjects not American, we stipulated in a solemn treaty that we\r\nwould carry into effect our own laws, and fixed the minimum force we\r\nwould employ for that purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThe President was well warranted, therefore, in requesting your serious\r\nreconsideration and review of that statement.\r\n\r\nSuppose your letter to go before the public unanswered and\r\nuncontradicted; suppose it to mingle itself with the general political\r\nhistory of the country, as an official letter among the archives of the\r\nDepartment of State, would not the general mass of readers understand\r\nyou as reciting facts, rather than as drawing your own conclusions? as\r\nstating history, rather than as presenting an argument? It is of an\r\nincorrect narrative that the President complains. It is that, in your\r\nhotel at Paris, you should undertake to write a history of a very\r\ndelicate part of a negotiation carried on at Washington, with which you\r\nhad nothing to do, and of the history of which you had no authentic\r\ninformation; and which history, as you narrate it, reflects not a little\r\non the independence, wisdom, and public spirit of the administration.\r\n\r\nAs of the history of this part of the negotiation you were not well\r\ninformed, the President cannot but think it would have been more just in\r\nyou to have refrained from any attempt to give an account of it.\r\n\r\nYou observe, further: \"I never mentioned in my despatch to you, nor in\r\nany manner whatever, that our government had conceded to that of England\r\nthe right to search our ships. That idea, however, pervades your letter,\r\nand is very apparent in that part of it which brings to my observation\r\nthe possible effect of my views upon the English government. But in this\r\nyou do me, though I am sure unintentionally, great injustice. I\r\nrepeatedly state that the recent treaty leaves the rights of the parties\r\nas it found them. My difficulty is not that we have made a positive\r\nconcession, but that we have acted unadvisedly in not making the\r\nabandonment of this pretension a previous condition to any conventional\r\narrangement upon the general subject.\"\r\n\r\nOn this part of your letter I must be allowed to make two remarks.\r\n\r\nThe first is, inasmuch as the treaty gives no color or pretext whatever\r\nto any right of searching our ships, a declaration against such a right\r\nwould have been no more suitable to this treaty than a declaration\r\nagainst the right of sacking our towns in time of peace, or any other\r\noutrage.\r\n\r\nThe rights of merchant-vessels of the United States on the high seas, as\r\nunderstood by this government, have been clearly and fully asserted. As\r\nasserted, they will be maintained; nor would a declaration such as you\r\npropose have increased either its resolution or its ability in this\r\nrespect. The government of the United States relies on its own power,\r\nand on the effective support of the people, to assert successfully all\r\nthe rights of all its citizens, on the sea as well as on the land; and\r\nit asks respect for these rights not as a boon or favor from any nation.\r\nThe President's message, most certainly, is a clear declaration of what\r\nthe country understands to be its rights, and his determination to\r\nmaintain them; not a mere promise to negotiate for these rights, or to\r\nendeavor to bring other powers into an acknowledgment of them, either\r\nexpress or implied. Whereas, if I understand the meaning of this part of\r\nyour letter, you would have advised that something should have been\r\noffered to England which she might have regarded as a benefit, but\r\ncoupled with such a declaration or condition as that, if she received\r\nthe boon, it would have been a recognition by her of a claim which we\r\nmake as matter of right. The President's view of the proper duty of the\r\ngovernment has certainly been quite different. Being convinced that the\r\ndoctrine asserted by this government is the true doctrine of the law of\r\nnations, and feeling the competency of the government to uphold and\r\nenforce it for itself, he has not sought, but, on the contrary, has\r\nsedulously avoided, to change this ground, and to place the just rights\r\nof the country upon the assent, express or implied, of any power\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe government thought no skilfully extorted promises necessary in any\r\nsuch cases. It asks no such pledges of any nation. If its character for\r\nability and readiness to protect and defend its own rights and dignity\r\nis not sufficient to preserve them from violation, no interpolation of\r\npromise to respect them, ingeniously woven into treaties, would be\r\nlikely to afford such protection. And as our rights and liberties depend\r\nfor existence upon our power to maintain them, general and vague\r\nprotests are not likely to be more effectual than the Chinese method of\r\ndefending their towns, by painting grotesque and hideous figures on the\r\nwalls to fright away assailing foes.\r\n\r\nMy other remark on this portion of your letter is this:--\r\n\r\nSuppose a declaration to the effect that this treaty should not be\r\nconsidered as sacrificing any American rights had been appended, and the\r\ntreaty, thus fortified, had been sent to Great Britain, as you propose;\r\nand suppose that that government, with equal ingenuity, had appended an\r\nequivalent written declaration that it should not be considered as\r\nsacrificing any British right, how much more defined would have been the\r\nrights of either party, or how much clearer the meaning and\r\ninterpretation of the treaty, by these reservations on both sides? Or,\r\nin other words, what is the value of a protest on one side, balanced by\r\nan exactly equivalent protest on the other?\r\n\r\nNo nation is presumed to sacrifice its rights, or give up what justly\r\nbelongs to it, unless it expressly stipulates that, for some good reason\r\nor adequate consideration, it does make such relinquishment; and an\r\nunnecessary asseveration that it does not intend to sacrifice just\r\nrights would seem only calculated to invite aggression. Such\r\nproclamations would seem better devised for concealing weakness and\r\napprehension, than for manifesting conscious strength and self-reliance,\r\nor for inspiring respect in others.\r\n\r\nToward the end of your letter you are pleased to observe: \"The rejection\r\nof a treaty, duly negotiated, is a serious question, to be avoided\r\nwhenever it can be without too great a sacrifice. Though the national\r\nfaith is not actually committed, still it is more or less engaged. And\r\nthere were peculiar circumstances, growing out of long-standing\r\ndifficulties, which rendered an amicable arrangement of the various\r\nmatters in dispute with England a subject of great national interest.\r\nBut the negotiation of a treaty is a far different subject. Topics are\r\nomitted or introduced at the discretion of the negotiators, and they are\r\nresponsible, to use the language of an eminent and able Senator, for\r\n'what it contains and what it omits.' This treaty, in my opinion, omits\r\na most important and necessary stipulation; and therefore, as it seems\r\nto me, its negotiation, in this particular, was unfortunate for the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\nThe President directs me to say, in reply to this, that in the treaty of\r\nWashington no topics were omitted, and no topics introduced, at the mere\r\ndiscretion of the negotiator; that the negotiation proceeded from step\r\nto step, and from day to day, under his own immediate supervision and\r\ndirection; that he himself takes the responsibility for what the treaty\r\ncontains and what it omits, and cheerfully leaves the merits of the\r\nwhole to the judgment of the country.\r\n\r\nI now conclude this letter, and close this correspondence, by repeating\r\nonce more the expression of the President's regret that you should have\r\ncommenced it by your letter of the 3d of October.\r\n\r\nIt is painful to him to have with you any cause of difference. He has a\r\njust appreciation of your character and your public services at home and\r\nabroad. He cannot but persuade himself that you must be aware yourself,\r\nby this time, that your letter of October was written under erroneous\r\nimpressions, and that there is no foundation for the opinions respecting\r\nthe treaty which it expresses; and that it would have been far better on\r\nall accounts if no such letter had been written.\r\n\r\nI have, &c.\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nLEWIS CASS, ESQ., _Late Minister of the United States at Paris_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HÜLSEMANN LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[As the authorship of this remarkable paper has sometimes been imputed\r\nto another person, it may be proper to give the facts respecting its\r\npreparation, although they involve nothing more important than a\r\nquestion of literary interest.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster, as has been stated, arrived at Marshfield on the 9th of\r\nOctober, 1850, where he remained for the space of two weeks. He brought\r\nwith him the papers relating to this controversy with Austria. Before he\r\nleft Washington, he gave to Mr. Hunter, a gentleman then and still\r\nfilling an important post in the Department of State, verbal\r\ninstructions concerning some of the points which would require to be\r\ntouched in an answer to Mr. Hülsemann's letter of September 30th, and\r\nrequested Mr. Hunter to prepare a draft of such an answer. This was\r\ndone, and Mr. Hunter's draft of an answer was forwarded to Mr. Webster\r\nat Marshfield. On the 20th of October, 1850, Mr. Webster, being far from\r\nwell, addressed a note to Mr. Everett,[1] requesting him also to prepare\r\na draft of a reply to Mr. Hülsemann, at the same time sending to Mr.\r\nEverett a copy of Mr. Hülsemann's letter and of President Taylor's\r\nmessage to the Senate relating to Mr. Mann's mission to Hungary.[2] On\r\nthe 21st Mr. Webster went to his farm in Franklin, New Hampshire, where\r\nhe remained until the 4th of November. While there he received from Mr.\r\nEverett a draft of an answer to Mr. Hülsemann, which was written by Mr.\r\nEverett between the 21st and the 24th of October.\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Webster's death, it was rumored that the real author of\r\n\"the Hülsemann letter\" was Mr. Hunter,--a rumor for which Mr. Hunter\r\nhimself was in no way responsible. At a later period, in the summer of\r\n1853, the statement obtained currency in the newspapers that Mr. Everett\r\nwrote this celebrated despatch, and many comments were made upon the\r\nsupposed fact that Mr. Everett had claimed its authorship. The facts\r\nare, that, while at Franklin, Mr. Webster, with Mr. Hunter's and Mr.\r\nEverett's drafts both before him, went over the whole subject, making\r\nconsiderable changes in Mr. Everett's draft, striking out entire\r\nparagraphs with his pen, altering some phrases, and writing new\r\nparagraphs of his own, but adopting Mr. Everett's draft as the basis of\r\nthe official paper; a purpose which he expressed to Mr. Everett on his\r\nreturn to Boston toward Washington. Subsequently, when he had arrived in\r\nWashington, Mr. Webster caused a third draft to be made, in the State\r\nDepartment, from Mr. Everett's paper and his own additions and\r\nalterations. On this third draft he made still other changes and\r\nadditions, and, when the whole was completed to his own satisfaction,\r\nthe official letter was drawn out by a clerk, was submitted to the\r\nPresident, and, being signed by Mr. Webster, was sent to Mr.\r\nHülsemann.[3]\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, passages and expressions in this letter which are\r\nin a tone not usual with Mr. Webster in his diplomatic papers. How he\r\nhimself regarded the criticisms that might be made upon it may be seen\r\nfrom the following note:--\r\n\r\n[TO MR. TICKNOR.]\r\n\r\n\"Washington, January 16, 1851.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Sir,--If you say that my Hülsemann letter is boastful and\r\nrough, I shall own the soft impeachment. My excuse is twofold: 1. I\r\nthought it well enough to speak out, and tell the people of Europe who\r\nand what we are, and awaken them to a just sense of the unparalleled\r\ngrowth of this country. 2. I wished to write a paper which should touch\r\nthe national pride, and make a man feel _sheepish_ and look _silly_ who\r\nshould speak of disunion. It is curious enough but it is certain, that\r\nMr. Mann's private instructions were seen, somehow, by Schwarzenberg.\r\n\r\n\"Yours always truly,\r\n\r\n\"DANIEL WEBSTER.\"[4]\r\n\r\nDepartment of State, Washington,\r\nDecember 21, 1850.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned, Secretary of State of the United States, had the honor\r\nto receive, some time ago, the note of Mr. Hülsemann, Chargé d'Affaires\r\nof his Majesty, the Emperor of Austria, of the 30th of September.\r\nCauses, not arising from any want of personal regard for Mr. Hülsemann,\r\nor of proper respect for his government, have delayed an answer until\r\nthe present moment. Having submitted Mr. Hülsemann's letter to the\r\nPresident, the undersigned is now directed by him to return the\r\nfollowing reply.\r\n\r\nThe objects of Mr. Hülsemann's note are, first, to protest, by order of\r\nhis government, against the steps taken by the late President of the\r\nUnited States to ascertain the progress and probable result of the\r\nrevolutionary movements in Hungary; and, secondly, to complain of some\r\nexpressions in the instructions of the late Secretary of State to Mr. A.\r\nDudley Mann, a confidential agent of the United States, as communicated\r\nby President Taylor to the Senate on the 28th of March last.\r\n\r\nThe principal ground of protest is founded on the idea, or in the\r\nallegation, that the government of the United States, by the mission of\r\nMr. Mann and his instructions, has interfered in the domestic affairs of\r\nAustria in a manner unjust or disrespectful toward that power. The\r\nPresident's message was a communication made by him to the Senate,\r\ntransmitting a correspondence between the executive government and a\r\nconfidential agent of its own. This would seem to be itself a domestic\r\ntransaction, a mere instance of intercourse between the President and\r\nthe Senate, in the manner which is usual and indispensable in\r\ncommunications between the different branches of the government. It was\r\nnot addressed either to Austria or Hungary; nor was it a public\r\nmanifesto, to which any foreign state was called on to reply. It was an\r\naccount of its transactions communicated by the executive government to\r\nthe Senate, at the request of that body; made public, indeed, but made\r\npublic only because such is the common and usual course of proceeding.\r\nIt may be regarded as somewhat strange, therefore, that the Austrian\r\nCabinet did not perceive that, by the instructions given to Mr.\r\nHülsemann, it was itself interfering with the domestic concerns of a\r\nforeign state, the very thing which is the ground of its complaint\r\nagainst the United States.\r\n\r\nThis department has, on former occasions, informed the ministers of\r\nforeign powers, that a communication from the President to either house\r\nof Congress is regarded as a domestic communication, of which,\r\nordinarily, no foreign state has cognizance; and in more recent\r\ninstances, the great inconvenience of making such communications the\r\nsubject of diplomatic correspondence and discussion has been fully\r\nshown. If it had been the pleasure of his Majesty, the Emperor of\r\nAustria, during the struggles in Hungary, to have admonished the\r\nprovisional government or the people of that country against involving\r\nthemselves in disaster, by following the evil and dangerous example of\r\nthe United States of America in making efforts for the establishment of\r\nindependent governments, such an admonition from that sovereign to his\r\nHungarian subjects would not have originated here a diplomatic\r\ncorrespondence. The President might, perhaps, on this ground, have\r\ndeclined to direct any particular reply to Mr. Hülsemann's note; but out\r\nof proper respect for the Austrian government, it has been thought\r\nbetter to answer that note at length; and the more especially, as the\r\noccasion is not unfavorable for the expression of the general sentiments\r\nof the government of the United States upon the topics which that note\r\ndiscusses.\r\n\r\nA leading subject in Mr. Hülsemann's note is that of the correspondence\r\nbetween Mr. Hülsemann and the predecessor of the undersigned, in which\r\nMr. Clayton, by direction of the President, informed Mr Hülsemann \"that\r\nMr. Mann's mission had no other object in view than to obtain reliable\r\ninformation as to the true state of affairs in Hungary, by personal\r\nobservation.\" Mr. Hülsemann remarks, that \"this explanation can hardly\r\nbe admitted, for it says very little as to the cause of the anxiety\r\nwhich was felt to ascertain the chances of the revolutionists.\" As this,\r\nhowever, is the only purpose which can, with any appearance of truth, be\r\nattributed to the agency; as nothing whatever is alleged by Mr.\r\nHülsemann to have been either done or said by the agent inconsistent\r\nwith such an object, the undersigned conceives that Mr. Clayton's\r\nexplanation ought to be deemed, not only admissible, but quite\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nMr. Hülsemann states, in the course of his note, that his instructions\r\nto address his present communication to Mr. Clayton reached Washington\r\nabout the time of the lamented death of the late President, and that he\r\ndelayed from a sense of propriety the execution of his task until the\r\nnew administration should be fully organized; \"a delay which he now\r\nrejoices at, as it has given him the opportunity of ascertaining from\r\nthe new President himself, on the occasion of the reception of the\r\ndiplomatic corps, that the fundamental policy of the United States, so\r\nfrequently proclaimed, would guide the relations of the American\r\ngovernment with other powers.\" Mr. Hülsemann also observes, that it is\r\nin his power to assure the undersigned \"that the Imperial government is\r\ndisposed to cultivate relations of friendship and good understanding\r\nwith the United States.\"\r\n\r\nThe President receives this assurance of the disposition of the Imperial\r\ngovernment with great satisfaction; and, in consideration of the\r\nfriendly relations of the two governments thus mutually recognized, and\r\nof the peculiar nature of the incidents by which their good\r\nunderstanding is supposed by Mr. Hülsemann to have been for a moment\r\ndisturbed or endangered, the President regrets that Mr. Hülsemann did\r\nnot feel himself at liberty wholly to forbear from the execution of\r\ninstructions, which were of course transmitted from Vienna without any\r\nforesight of the state of things under which they would reach\r\nWashington. If Mr. Hülsemann saw, in the address of the President to the\r\ndiplomatic corps, satisfactory pledges of the sentiments and the policy\r\nof this government in regard to neutral rights and neutral duties, it\r\nmight, perhaps, have been better not to bring on a discussion of past\r\ntransactions. But the undersigned readily admits that this was a\r\nquestion fit only for the consideration and decision of Mr. Hülsemann\r\nhimself; and although the President does not see that any good purpose\r\ncan be answered by reopening the inquiry into the propriety of the steps\r\ntaken by President Taylor to ascertain the probable issue of the late\r\ncivil war in Hungary, justice to his memory requires the undersigned\r\nbriefly to restate the history of those steps, and to show their\r\nconsistency with the neutral policy which has invariably guided the\r\ngovernment of the United States in its foreign relations, as well as\r\nwith the established and well-settled principles of national\r\nintercourse, and the doctrines of public law.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned will first observe, that the President is persuaded his\r\nMajesty, the Emperor of Austria, does not think that the government of\r\nthe United States ought to view with unconcern the extraordinary events\r\nwhich have occurred, not only in his dominions, but in many other parts\r\nof Europe, since February, 1848. The government and people of the United\r\nStates, like other intelligent governments and communities, take a\r\nlively interest in the movements and the events of this remarkable age,\r\nin whatever part of the world they may be exhibited. But the interest\r\ntaken by the United States in those events has not proceeded from any\r\ndisposition to depart from that neutrality toward foreign powers, which\r\nis among the deepest principles and the most cherished traditions of the\r\npolitical history of the Union. It has been the necessary effect of the\r\nunexampled character of the events themselves, which could not fail to\r\narrest the attention of the contemporary world, as they will doubtless\r\nfill a memorable page in history.\r\n\r\nBut the undersigned goes further, and freely admits that, in proportion\r\nas these extraordinary events appeared to have their origin in those\r\ngreat ideas of responsible and popular government, on which the American\r\nconstitutions themselves are wholly founded, they could not but command\r\nthe warm sympathy of the people of this country. Well-known\r\ncircumstances in their history, indeed their whole history, have made\r\nthem the representatives of purely popular principles of government. In\r\nthis light they now stand before the world. They could not, if they\r\nwould, conceal their character, their condition, or their destiny. They\r\ncould not, if they so desired, shut out from the view of mankind the\r\ncauses which have placed them, in so short a national career, in the\r\nstation which they now hold among the civilized states of the world.\r\nThey could not, if they desired it, suppress either the thoughts or the\r\nhopes which arise in men's minds, in other countries, from contemplating\r\ntheir successful example of free government. That very intelligent and\r\ndistinguished personage, the Emperor Joseph the Second, was among the\r\nfirst to discern this necessary consequence of the American Revolution\r\non the sentiments and opinions of the people of Europe. In a letter to\r\nhis minister in the Netherlands in 1787, he observes, that \"it is\r\nremarkable that France, by the assistance which she afforded to the\r\nAmericans, gave birth to reflections on freedom.\" This fact, which the\r\nsagacity of that monarch perceived at so early a day, is now known and\r\nadmitted by intelligent powers all over the world. True, indeed, it is,\r\nthat the prevalence on the other continent of sentiments favorable to\r\nrepublican liberty is the result of the reaction of America upon Europe;\r\nand the source and centre of this reaction has doubtless been, and now\r\nis, in these United States.\r\n\r\nThe position thus belonging to the United States is a fact as\r\ninseparable from their history, their constitutional organization, and\r\ntheir character, as the opposite position of the powers composing the\r\nEuropean alliance is from the history and constitutional organization of\r\nthe government of those powers. The sovereigns who form that alliance\r\nhave not unfrequently felt it their right to interfere with the\r\npolitical movements of foreign states; and have, in their manifestoes\r\nand declarations, denounced the popular ideas of the age in terms so\r\ncomprehensive as of necessity to include the United States, and their\r\nforms of government. It is well known that one of the leading principles\r\nannounced by the allied sovereigns, after the restoration of the\r\nBourbons, is, that all popular or constitutional rights are holden no\r\notherwise than as grants and indulgences from crowned heads. \"Useful and\r\nnecessary changes in legislation and administration,\" says the Laybach\r\nCircular of May, 1821, \"ought only to emanate from the free will and\r\nintelligent conviction of those whom God has rendered responsible for\r\npower; all that deviates from this line necessarily leads to disorder,\r\ncommotions, and evils far more insufferable than those which they\r\npretend to remedy.\" And his late Austrian Majesty, Francis the First, is\r\nreported to have declared, in an address to the Hungarian Diet, in 1820,\r\nthat \"the whole world had become foolish, and, leaving their ancient\r\nlaws, were in search of imaginary constitutions.\" These declarations\r\namount to nothing less than a denial of the lawfulness of the origin of\r\nthe government of the United States, since it is certain that that\r\ngovernment was established in consequence of a change which did not\r\nproceed from thrones, or the permission of crowned heads. But the\r\ngovernment of the United States heard these denunciations of its\r\nfundamental principles without remonstrance, or the disturbance of its\r\nequanimity. This was thirty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe power of this republic, at the present moment, is spread over a\r\nregion one of the richest and most fertile on the globe, and of an\r\nextent in comparison with which the possessions of the house of Hapsburg\r\nare but as a patch on the earth's surface. Its population, already\r\ntwenty-five millions, will exceed that of the Austrian empire within the\r\nperiod during which it may be hoped that Mr. Hülsemann may yet remain in\r\nthe honorable discharge of his duties to his government. Its navigation\r\nand commerce are hardly exceeded by the oldest and most commercial\r\nnations; its maritime means and its maritime power may be seen by\r\nAustria herself, in all seas where she has ports, as well as they may be\r\nseen, also, in all other quarters of the globe. Life, liberty, property,\r\nand all personal rights, are amply secured to all citizens, and\r\nprotected by just and stable laws; and credit, public and private, is as\r\nwell established as in any government of Continental Europe; and the\r\ncountry, in all its interests and concerns, partakes most largely in all\r\nthe improvements and progress which distinguish the age. Certainly, the\r\nUnited States may be pardoned, even by those who profess adherence to\r\nthe principles of absolute government, if they entertain an ardent\r\naffection for those popular forms of political organization which have\r\nso rapidly advanced their own prosperity and happiness, and enabled\r\nthem, in so short a period, to bring their country, and the hemisphere\r\nto which it belongs, to the notice and respectful regard, not to say the\r\nadmiration, of the civilized world. Nevertheless, the United States have\r\nabstained, at all times, from acts of interference with the political\r\nchanges of Europe. They cannot, however, fail to cherish always a lively\r\ninterest in the fortunes of nations struggling for institutions like\r\ntheir own. But this sympathy, so far from being necessarily a hostile\r\nfeeling toward any of the parties to these great national struggles, is\r\nquite consistent with amicable relations with them all. The Hungarian\r\npeople are three or four times as numerous as the inhabitants of these\r\nUnited States were when the American Revolution broke out. They possess,\r\nin a distinct language, and in other respects, important elements of a\r\nseparate nationality, which the Anglo-Saxon race in this country did not\r\npossess; and if the United States wish success to countries contending\r\nfor popular constitutions and national independence, it is only because\r\nthey regard such constitutions and such national independence, not as\r\nimaginary, but as real blessings. They claim no right, however, to take\r\npart in the struggles of foreign powers in order to promote these ends.\r\nIt is only in defence of his own government, and its principles and\r\ncharacter, that the undersigned has now expressed himself on this\r\nsubject. But when the people of the United States behold the people of\r\nforeign countries, without any such interference, spontaneously moving\r\ntoward the adoption of institutions like their own, it surely cannot be\r\nexpected of them to remain wholly indifferent spectators.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the recent very important occurrences in the Austrian\r\nempire, the undersigned freely admits the difficulty which exists in\r\nthis country, and is alluded to by Mr. Hülsemann, of obtaining accurate\r\ninformation. But this difficulty is by no means to be ascribed to what\r\nMr. Hülsemann calls, with little justice, as it seems to the\r\nundersigned, \"the mendacious rumors propagated by the American press.\"\r\nFor information on this subject, and others of the same kind, the\r\nAmerican press is, of necessity, almost wholly dependent upon that of\r\nEurope; and if \"mendacious rumors\" respecting Austrian and Hungarian\r\naffairs have been anywhere propagated, that propagation of falsehoods\r\nhas been most prolific on the European continent, and in countries\r\nimmediately bordering on the Austrian empire. But, wherever these errors\r\nmay have originated, they certainly justified the late President in\r\nseeking true information through authentic channels.\r\n\r\nHis attention was first particularly drawn to the state of things in\r\nHungary by the correspondence of Mr. Stiles, Chargé d'Affaires of the\r\nUnited States at Vienna. In the autumn of 1848, an application was made\r\nto this gentleman, on behalf of Mr. Kossuth, formerly Minister of\r\nFinance for the Kingdom of Hungary by Imperial appointment, but, at the\r\ntime the application was made, chief of the revolutionary government.\r\nThe object of this application was to obtain the good offices of Mr.\r\nStiles with the Imperial government, with a view to the suspension of\r\nhostilities. This application became the subject of a conference between\r\nPrince Schwarzenberg, the Imperial Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Mr.\r\nStiles. The Prince commended the considerateness and propriety with\r\nwhich Mr. Stiles had acted; and, so far from disapproving his\r\ninterference, advised him, in case he received a further communication\r\nfrom the revolutionary government in Hungary, to have an interview with\r\nPrince Windischgrätz, who was charged by the Emperor with the\r\nproceedings determined on in relation to that kingdom. A week after\r\nthese occurrences, Mr. Stiles received, through a secret channel, a\r\ncommunication signed by L. Kossuth, President of the Committee of\r\nDefence, and countersigned by Francis Pulszky, Secretary of State. On\r\nthe receipt of this communication, Mr. Stiles had an interview with\r\nPrince Windischgrätz, \"who received him with the utmost kindness, and\r\nthanked him for his efforts toward reconciling the existing\r\ndifficulties.\" Such were the incidents which first drew the attention of\r\nthe government of the United States particularly to the affairs of\r\nHungary, and the conduct of Mr. Stiles, though acting without\r\ninstructions in a matter of much delicacy, having been viewed with\r\nsatisfaction by the Imperial government, was approved by that of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the year 1848, and in the early part of 1849, a\r\nconsiderable number of Hungarians came to the United States. Among them\r\nwere individuals representing themselves to be in the confidence of the\r\nrevolutionary government, and by these persons the President was\r\nstrongly urged to recognize the existence of that government. In these\r\napplications, and in the manner in which they were viewed by the\r\nPresident, there was nothing unusual; still less was there any thing\r\nunauthorized by the law of nations. It is the right of every independent\r\nstate to enter into friendly relations with every other independent\r\nstate. Of course, questions of prudence naturally arise in reference to\r\nnew states, brought by successful revolutions into the family of\r\nnations; but it is not to be required of neutral powers that they should\r\nawait the recognition of the new government by the parent state. No\r\nprinciple of public law has been more frequently acted upon, within the\r\nlast thirty years, by the great powers of the world, than this. Within\r\nthat period, eight or ten new states have established independent\r\ngovernments, within the limits of the colonial dominions of Spain, on\r\nthis continent; and in Europe the same thing has been done by Belgium\r\nand Greece. The existence of all these governments was recognized by\r\nsome of the leading powers of Europe, as well as by the United States,\r\nbefore it was acknowledged by the states from which they had separated\r\nthemselves. If, therefore, the United States had gone so far as formally\r\nto acknowledge the independence of Hungary, although, as the result has\r\nproved, it would have been a precipitate step, and one from which no\r\nbenefit would have resulted to either party; it would not, nevertheless,\r\nhave been an act against the law of nations, provided they took no part\r\nin her contest with Austria. But the United States did no such thing.\r\nNot only did they not yield to Hungary any actual countenance or succor,\r\nnot only did they not show their ships of war in the Adriatic with any\r\nmenacing or hostile aspect, but they studiously abstained from every\r\nthing which had not been done in other cases in times past, and\r\ncontented themselves with instituting an inquiry into the truth and\r\nreality of alleged political occurrences. Mr. Hülsemann incorrectly\r\nstates, unintentionally certainly, the nature of the mission of this\r\nagent, when he says that \"a United States agent had been despatched to\r\nVienna with orders to watch for a favorable moment to recognize the\r\nHungarian republic, and to conclude a treaty of commerce with the same.\"\r\nThis, indeed, would have been a lawful object, but Mr. Mann's errand\r\nwas, in the first instance, purely one of inquiry. He had no power to\r\nact, unless he had first come to the conviction that a firm and stable\r\nHungarian government existed. \"The principal object the President has in\r\nview,\" according to his instructions, \"is to obtain minute and reliable\r\ninformation in regard to Hungary, in connection with the affairs of\r\nadjoining countries, the probable issue of the present revolutionary\r\nmovements, and the chances we may have of forming commercial\r\narrangements with that power favorable to the United States.\" Again, in\r\nthe same paper, it is said: \"The object of the President is to obtain\r\ninformation in regard to Hungary, and her resources and prospects, with\r\na view to an early recognition of her independence and the formation of\r\ncommercial relations with her.\" It was only in the event that the new\r\ngovernment should appear, in the opinion of the agent, to be firm and\r\nstable, that the President proposed to recommend its recognition.\r\n\r\nMr. Hülsemann, in qualifying these steps of President Taylor with the\r\nepithet of \"hostile,\" seems to take for granted that the inquiry could,\r\nin the expectation of the President, have but one result, and that\r\nfavorable to Hungary. If this were so, it would not change the case. But\r\nthe American government sought for nothing but truth; it desired to\r\nlearn the facts through a reliable channel. It so happened, in the\r\nchances and vicissitudes of human affairs, that the result was adverse\r\nto the Hungarian revolution. The American agent, as was stated in his\r\ninstructions to be not unlikely, found the condition of Hungarian\r\naffairs less prosperous than it had been, or had been believed to be. He\r\ndid not enter Hungary, nor hold any direct communication with her\r\nrevolutionary leaders. He reported against the recognition of her\r\nindependence, because he found she had been unable to set up a firm and\r\nstable government. He carefully forbore, as his instructions required,\r\nto give publicity to his mission, and the undersigned supposes that the\r\nAustrian government first learned its existence from the communications\r\nof the President to the Senate.\r\n\r\nMr. Hülsemann will observe from this statement, that Mr. Mann's mission\r\nwas wholly unobjectionable, and strictly within the rule of the law of\r\nnations and the duty of the United States as a neutral power. He will\r\naccordingly feel how little foundation there is for his remark, that\r\n\"those who did not hesitate to assume the responsibility of sending Mr.\r\nDudley Mann on such an errand should, independent of considerations of\r\npropriety, have borne in mind that they were exposing their emissary to\r\nbe treated as a spy.\" A spy is a person sent by one belligerent to gain\r\nsecret information of the forces and defences of the other, to be used\r\nfor hostile purposes. According to practice, he may use deception, under\r\nthe penalty of being lawfully hanged if detected. To give this odious\r\nname and character to a confidential agent of a neutral power, bearing\r\nthe commission of his country, and sent for a purpose fully warranted by\r\nthe law of nations, is not only to abuse language, but also to confound\r\nall just ideas, and to announce the wildest and most extravagant\r\nnotions, such as certainly were not to have been expected in a grave\r\ndiplomatic paper; and the President directs the undersigned to say to\r\nMr. Hülsemann, that the American government would regard such an\r\nimputation upon it by the Cabinet of Austria as that it employs spies,\r\nand that in a quarrel none of its own, as distinctly offensive, if it\r\ndid not presume, as it is willing to presume, that the word used in the\r\noriginal German was not of equivalent meaning with \"spy\" in the English\r\nlanguage, or that in some other way the employment of such an\r\nopprobrious term may be explained. Had the Imperial government of\r\nAustria subjected Mr. Mann for the treatment of a spy, it would have\r\nplaced itself without the pale of civilized nations; and the Cabinet of\r\nVienna may be assured, that if it had carried, or attempted to carry,\r\nany such lawless purpose into effect, in the case of an authorized agent\r\nof this government, the spirit of the people of this country would have\r\ndemanded immediate hostilities to be waged by the utmost exertion of the\r\npower of the republic, military and naval.\r\n\r\nMr. Hülsemann proceeds to remark, that \"this extremely painful incident,\r\ntherefore, might have been passed over, without any written evidence\r\nbeing left on our part in the archives of the United States, had not\r\nGeneral Taylor thought proper to revive the whole subject by\r\ncommunicating to the Senate, in his message of the 18th [28th] of last\r\nMarch, the instructions with which Mr. Mann had been furnished on the\r\noccasion of his mission to Vienna. The publicity which has been given to\r\nthat document has placed the Imperial government under the necessity of\r\nentering a formal protest, through its official representative, against\r\nthe proceedings of the American government, lest that government should\r\nconstrue our silence into approbation, or toleration even, of the\r\nprinciples which appear to have guided its action and the means it has\r\nadopted.\" The undersigned reasserts to Mr. Hülsemann, and to the Cabinet\r\nof Vienna, and in the presence of the world, that the steps taken by\r\nPresident Taylor, now protested against by the Austrian government, were\r\nwarranted by the law of nations and agreeable to the usages of civilized\r\nstates. With respect to the communication of Mr. Mann's instructions to\r\nthe Senate, and the language in which they are couched, it has already\r\nbeen said, and Mr. Hülsemann must feel the justice of the remark, that\r\nthese are domestic affairs, in reference to which the government of the\r\nUnited States cannot admit the slightest responsibility to the\r\ngovernment of his Imperial Majesty. No state, deserving the appellation\r\nof independent, can permit the language in which it may instruct its own\r\nofficers in the discharge of their duties to itself to be called in\r\nquestion under any pretext by a foreign power.\r\n\r\nBut even if this were not so, Mr. Hülsemann is in an error in stating\r\nthat the Austrian government is called an \"iron rule\" in Mr. Mann's\r\ninstructions. That phrase is not found in the paper; and in respect to\r\nthe honorary epithet bestowed in Mr. Mann's instructions on the late\r\nchief of the revolutionary government of Hungary, Mr. Hülsemann will\r\nbear in mind that the government of the United States cannot justly be\r\nexpected, in a confidential communication to its own agent, to withhold\r\nfrom an individual an epithet of distinction of which a great part of\r\nthe world thinks him worthy, merely on the ground that his own\r\ngovernment regards him as a rebel. At an early stage of the American\r\nRevolution, while Washington was considered by the English government as\r\na rebel chief, he was regarded on the Continent of Europe as an\r\nillustrious hero. But the undersigned will take the liberty of bringing\r\nthe Cabinet of Vienna into the presence of its own predecessors, and of\r\nciting for its consideration the conduct of the Imperial government\r\nitself. In the year 1777 the war of the American Revolution was raging\r\nall over these United States. England was prosecuting that war with a\r\nmost resolute determination, and by the exertion of all her military\r\nmeans to the fullest extent. Germany was at that time at peace with\r\nEngland; and yet an agent of that Congress, which was looked upon by\r\nEngland in no other light than that of a body in open rebellion, was not\r\nonly received with great respect by the ambassador of the Empress Queen\r\nat Paris, and by the minister of the Grand Duke of Tuscany (who\r\nafterwards mounted the Imperial throne), but resided in Vienna for a\r\nconsiderable time; not, indeed, officially acknowledged, but treated\r\nwith courtesy and respect; and the Emperor suffered himself to be\r\npersuaded by that agent to exert himself to prevent the German powers\r\nfrom furnishing troops to England to enable her to suppress the\r\nrebellion in America. Neither Mr. Hülsemann nor the Cabinet of Vienna,\r\nit is presumed, will undertake to say that any thing said or done by\r\nthis government in regard to the recent war between Austria and Hungary\r\nis not borne out, and much more than borne out, by this example of the\r\nImperial Court. It is believed that the Emperor Joseph the Second\r\nhabitually spoke in terms of respect and admiration of the character of\r\nWashington, as he is known to have done of that of Franklin; and he\r\ndeemed it no infraction of neutrality to inform himself of the progress\r\nof the revolutionary struggle in America, or to express his deep sense\r\nof the merits and the talents of those illustrious men who were then\r\nleading their country to independence and renown. The undersigned may\r\nadd, that in 1781 the courts of Russia and Austria proposed a diplomatic\r\ncongress of the belligerent powers, to which the commissioners of the\r\nUnited States should be admitted.\r\n\r\nMr. Hülsemann thinks that in Mr. Mann's instructions improper\r\nexpressions are introduced in regard to Russia; but the undersigned has\r\nno reason to suppose that Russia herself is of that opinion. The only\r\nobservation made in those instructions about Russia is, that she \"has\r\nchosen to assume an attitude of interference, and her immense\r\npreparations for invading and reducing the Hungarians to the rule of\r\nAustria, from which they desire to be released, gave so serious a\r\ncharacter to the contest as to awaken the most painful solicitude in the\r\nminds of Americans.\" The undersigned cannot but consider the Austrian\r\nCabinet as unnecessarily susceptible in looking upon language like this\r\nas a \"hostile demonstration.\" If we remember that it was addressed by\r\nthe government to its own agent, and has received publicity only through\r\na communication from one department of the American government to\r\nanother, the language quoted must be deemed moderate and inoffensive.\r\nThe comity of nations would hardly forbid its being addressed to the two\r\nimperial powers themselves. It is scarcely necessary for the undersigned\r\nto say, that the relations of the United States with Russia have always\r\nbeen of the most friendly kind, and have never been deemed by either\r\nparty to require any compromise of their peculiar views upon subjects of\r\ndomestic or foreign polity, or the true origin of governments. At any\r\nrate, the fact that Austria, in her contest with Hungary, had an\r\nintimate and faithful ally in Russia, cannot alter the real nature of\r\nthe question between Austria and Hungary, nor in any way affect the\r\nneutral rights and duties of the government of the United States, or the\r\njustifiable sympathies of the American people. It is, indeed, easy to\r\nconceive, that favor toward struggling Hungary would be not diminished,\r\nbut increased, when it was seen that the arm of Austria was strengthened\r\nand upheld by a power whose assistance threatened to be, and which in\r\nthe end proved to be, overwhelmingly destructive of all her hopes.\r\n\r\nToward the conclusion of his note Mr. Hülsemarnn remarks, that \"if the\r\ngovernment of the United States were to think it proper to take an\r\nindirect part in the political movements of Europe, American policy\r\nwould be exposed to acts of retaliation, and to certain inconveniences\r\nwhich would not fail to affect the commerce and industry of the two\r\nhemispheres.\" As to this possible fortune, this hypothetical\r\nretaliation, the government and people of the United States are quite\r\nwilling to take their chances and abide their destiny. Taking neither a\r\ndirect nor an indirect part in the domestic or intestine movements of\r\nEurope, they have no fear of events of the nature alluded to by Mr.\r\nHülsemann. It would be idle now to discuss with Mr. Hülsemann those acts\r\nof retaliation which he imagines may possibly take place at some\r\nindefinite time hereafter. Those questions will be discussed when they\r\narise; and Mr. Hülsemann and the Cabinet at Vienna may rest assured,\r\nthat, in the mean time, while performing with strict and exact fidelity\r\nall their neutral duties, nothing will deter either the government or\r\nthe people of the United States from exercising, at their own\r\ndiscretion, the rights belonging to them as an independent nation, and\r\nof forming and expressing their own opinions, freely and at all times,\r\nupon the great political events which may transpire among the civilized\r\nnations of the earth. Their own institutions stand upon the broadest\r\nprinciples of civil liberty; and believing those principles and the\r\nfundamental laws in which they are embodied to be eminently favorable\r\nto the prosperity of states, to be, in fact, the only principles of\r\ngovernment which meet the demands of the present enlightened age, the\r\nPresident has perceived, with great satisfaction, that, in the\r\nconstitution recently introduced into the Austrian empire, many of these\r\ngreat principles are recognized and applied, and he cherishes a sincere\r\nwish that they may produce the same happy effects throughout his\r\nAustrian Majesty's extensive dominions that they have done in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe undersigned has the honor to repeat to Mr. Hülsemann the assurance\r\nof his high consideration.\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEVALIER J.G. HÜLSEMANN, _Chargé d'Affaires of Austria,\r\nWashington_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Everett had then resigned the Presidency of Harvard\r\nCollege.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Whether Mr. Hunter's draft was also sent to Mr. Everett, I\r\ndo not know. The internal evidence would seem to indicate that it was;\r\nbut the fact is not material.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I have seen, I believe, all the documents in relation to\r\nthis matter; viz. Mr. Hunter's draft, Mr. Everett's (in his handwriting,\r\nwith Mr. Webster's erasures), the third draft, made at the department\r\nunder Mr. Webster's directions, and the original added paragraphs,\r\nwritten by Mr. Webster with his own hand. To those who are curious about\r\nthe question of _authorship_, it is needful only to say that Mr. Webster\r\nadopted Mr. Everett's draft as the basis of the official letter, but\r\nthat the official letter is a much more vigorous, expanded, and complete\r\nproduction than Mr. Everett's draft. It is described in a note written\r\nby Mr. Everett to one of the literary executors, in 1853, as follows:\r\n\"It can be stated truly that what Mr. Webster did himself to the letter\r\nwas very considerable; and that he added one half in bulk to the\r\noriginal draft; and that his additions were of the most significant\r\ncharacter. It was very carefully elaborated in the department by him,\r\ntill he was authorized to speak of it as he did at the Kossuth\r\ndinner....\"\r\n\r\nThis refers to what Mr. Webster said in his speech at the Kossuth\r\nbanquet, in Washington, January 7, 1852:--\r\n\r\n\"May I be so egotistical as to say that I have nothing new to say on the\r\nsubject of Hungary? Gentlemen, in the autumn of the year before last,\r\nout of health, and retired to my paternal home among the mountains of\r\nNew Hampshire, I was, by reason of my physical condition, confined to my\r\nhouse; but I was among the mountains, whose native air I was bound to\r\ninspire. Nothing saluted my senses, nothing saluted my mind, or my\r\nsentiments, but freedom, full and entire; and there, gentlemen, near the\r\ngraves of my ancestors, I wrote a letter, which most of you have seen,\r\naddressed to the Austrian _chargé d'affaires_. I can say nothing of the\r\nability displayed in that letter, but, as to its principles, while the\r\nsun and moon endure, I stand by them.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: From Hon. George T.
