So extensive was their popularity that they\r\nwere immediately reprinted in almost all our Colonial newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe outbursts of joy throughout America occasioned by the repeal of\r\nthe Stamp Act had scarcely subsided when, the protracted illness\r\nof Lord Chatham having left the Ministry without a head, the\r\nindomitable Charles Townsend, to the amazement of his colleagues\r\nand unfeigned delight of his King, introduced measure after measure\r\nunder the pretence that they were demanded by the necessities of\r\nthe Exchequer; but in reality for the purpose of demonstrating the\r\nsupremacy of the power of the Parliament of Great Britain over her\r\ncolonies in America. Among these Acts were those which provided for\r\nthe billeting of troops in the various colonies; others called for\r\nduties upon glass, lead, paint, oil, tea, etc. Of dire portent was\r\nthe provision therein, that the revenues thus obtained be used for\r\nthe maintenance of a Civil List in America, and for the payment of\r\nthe salaries of the Royal Governors and Justices, salaries which had\r\nhitherto been voted by the various Assemblies. The Assembly of New\r\nYork, having failed to comply strictly with the letter of the law in\r\nregard to the billeting of the King's troops, was punished by having\r\nits legislative powers suspended.\r\n\r\nThis action boded ill for the future of any law-making body in\r\nAmerica which should fail to carry out strictly any measure upon\r\nwhich the British Parliament might agree. The Colonies needed\r\na common ground on which to meet in their opposition to these\r\narbitrary Acts of Parliament. The deeds of violence and the\r\ntumultuous and passionate harangues in the northern colonies met\r\nwith little sympathy among a large class in the middle and southern\r\ncolonies, who, while chafing under the attacks upon their liberties,\r\nhesitated to favor resistance to the home government because of\r\ntheir unswerving loyalty to their King and their love for the\r\ncountry to whom and to which they owed allegiance. To these \"The\r\nFarmer\" appealed when he wrote, \"The cause of liberty is a cause of\r\ntoo much dignity to be slighted by turbulence and tumult. It ought\r\nto be maintained in a manner suitable to her nature, those who\r\nengage in it should breathe a sedate yet fervent spirit animating\r\nthem to actions of prudence, justice, modesty, bravery, humanity and\r\nmagnanimity.\" The convincing logic of these letters clearly proved\r\nthat the constitutional rights belonging to Englishmen were being\r\ntrampled upon in the colonies, and furnished a platform upon which\r\nall those who feared their liberties were endangered could unite.\r\n\r\nUnder the date of the fifth of November, 1767, the seventy-ninth\r\nanniversary of the day on which the landing of William the Third\r\nat Torbay gave constitutional liberty to all Englishmen, John\r\nDickinson, of Pennsylvania (for before long it became known that he\r\nwas the illustrious author), in a letter addressed to his \"beloved\r\ncountrymen,\" called attention to the lack of interest shown by the\r\nColonies in the act suspending the legislative powers of New York,\r\nand logically pointed out that the precedent thereby established was\r\na blow at the liberty of all the other Colonies, laying particular\r\nemphasis upon the danger of mutual inattention by the Colonies to\r\nthe interests of one another.\r\n\r\nThe education and training of the author well qualified him to\r\nhandle his subject. Born in 1732 on his ancestral plantation on the\r\neastern shore of Maryland, from early youth John Dickinson had had\r\nthe advantages of a classical education.[1] His nineteenth year\r\nfound him reading law in a lawyer's office in Philadelphia. Three\r\nyears later, he sailed for England, where he devoted four important\r\nyears to study at the Middle Temple, and then and there obtained\r\nthat knowledge of English common law and constitutional history, and\r\nimbibed the traditions of liberty belonging to Englishmen on which\r\nhe later founded his plea for the resistance of the Colonies to the\r\nministerial attacks upon their liberty. On his return home he took\r\nup the practice of his profession at Philadelphia, and immediately\r\nwon for himself a high place at the Bar. Elected in 1760 a member of\r\nthe Assembly of Delaware, his reputation for ability and political\r\ndiscernment gained him its speakership. In 1762 he became a member\r\nof the Assembly of Pennsylvania, where he acquired great prominence\r\nand unpopularity, which later cost him his seat in that body, on\r\naccount of his opposition to the Assembly's sending a petition to\r\nthe King praying that the latter \"would _resume_ the government of\r\nthe province, making such compensation to the proprietaries as would\r\nbe equitable, and permitting the inhabitants to enjoy under the new\r\ngovernment the privileges that have been granted to them by and\r\nunder your Royal ministries.\"\r\n\r\n    [1] \"The Life and Times of John Dickinson,\" by Charles J. Stillé.\r\n\r\nPossibly Dickinson's knowledge of the personality of the Ministry\r\nand the dominant spirits in English political circles gained\r\nwhile abroad, led him bitterly to attack this measure, fathered\r\nand supported by Franklin, for subsequent events soon showed the\r\nfar-sightedness which led him to distrust the wisdom of a demand for\r\nthe revoking of the Proprietary Charter, even though it were a bad\r\none. His part in the controversy forced even his bitterest opponents\r\nto admire his ability. The enormous debt incurred by Great Britain\r\nduring the then recent war with France led the Ministry to look for\r\nsome way of lightening taxation at home. It was decided that America\r\nmust pay a share toward lifting the burden resting heavily on\r\nthose in England, caused by the financing of the expenses of a war\r\nwhich drove France from North America. The fact that the colonies\r\nhad furnished, equipped and maintained in the field twenty-five\r\nthousand troops and had incurred debts far heavier in proportion\r\nthan those at home was forgotten. In 1764 was passed the \"Sugar\r\nAct,\" which extended and enlarged the Navigation Acts and made\r\nEngland the channel through which not only all European, but also\r\nall Asiatic trade to and from the colonies must flow. At the same\r\ntime an announcement was made that \"Stamp Duties\" would be added\r\nlater on. The next year from Dickinson's pen appeared a pamphlet\r\nentitled \"THE LATE REGULATIONS RESPECTING THE BRITISH COLONIES ON\r\nTHE CONTINENT OF AMERICA CONSIDERED, in a Letter from a Gentleman\r\nin PHILADELPHIA to his Friend in LONDON,\" in which these late\r\nregulations and proposed measures were discussed entirely from an\r\neconomic standpoint. In it was clearly shown how dependent were the\r\nmanufacturers and traders in England for their prosperity upon the\r\ntrade of the colonies and that any restraint of American trade would\r\nnaturally curtail the ability of those in the colonies to purchase\r\nfrom the home market. The Stamp Act was opposed on the ground that\r\nthe already impoverished colonies would be drained of all their gold\r\nand silver which necessarily would have to go abroad in the payment\r\nfor the stamps. This letter was conciliatory and persuasive, yet in\r\nthe closing pages Dickinson asked:\r\n\r\n\"What then can we do? Which way shall we turn ourselves? How may we\r\nmitigate the miseries of our country? _Great Britain_ gives us an\r\nexample to guide us? SHE TEACHES US TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN\r\nHER INTERESTS AND OUR OWN.\r\n\r\n\"Teaches! She requires--commands--insists upon\r\nit--threatens--compels--and even distresses us into it.\r\n\r\n\"We have our choice of these two things--to continue our present\r\nlimited and disadvantageous commerce--or to promote manufactures\r\namong ourselves, with a habit of economy, and thereby remove the\r\nnecessity we are now under of being supplied by _Great Britain_.\r\n\r\n\"It is not difficult to determine which of these things is most\r\neligible. Could the last of them be only so far executed as to bring\r\nour demand for British manufactures below the profits of our foreign\r\ntrade, and the amount of our commodities immediately remitted home,\r\nthese colonies might revive and flourish. States and families are\r\nenriched by the same means; that is, by being so industrious and\r\nfrugal as to spend less than what they raise can pay for.\"\r\n\r\nThe various Non-Importation Agreements signed during the next ten\r\nyears, bear testimony to the popularity of the proposed plan.\r\n\r\nThis pamphlet circulated freely and increased Dickinson's reputation\r\nas that of a man capable of thoroughly discussing public measures;\r\nit also brought his name to the attention of the British public for\r\nwhom the \"Letter\" was especially written.\r\n\r\nAt the call of Massachusetts, representatives of nine of the\r\ncolonies met in New York in October, 1764, and after a long\r\ndiscussion (in which Dickinson's knowledge of constitutional law\r\nand English colonial policy enabled him to assume the leadership)\r\nissued a \"Declaration of Rights,\" in which it was asserted\r\nthat the inhabitants of the Colonies, standing on their rights\r\nas Englishmen, could not be taxed by the House of Commons while\r\nunrepresented in that body. Memorials were sent abroad protesting\r\nagainst the proposed acts, expressing, however, their willingness\r\nto meet loyally as in the past any properly accredited requisitions\r\nfor funds sent to the various Assemblies. Notwithstanding this\r\nopposition, and the protests of all friends of America in England,\r\nthe Stamp Act was passed. A year later it was repealed.\r\n\r\n                  _JUST PUBLISHED._\r\n\r\n      _Printed on a large Type, and fine Paper_,\r\n      And to be sold at the _LONDON BOOK STORE_\r\n              North Side of King-street\r\n\r\n                       _LETTERS_\r\n                          FROM\r\n                A FARMER in _PENNSYLVANIA_\r\n\r\n                To the INHABITANTS of the\r\n                    BRITISH COLONIES.\r\n\r\n               (_Price two Pistareens_)\r\n\r\n  Among all the WRITERS in favor of the COLONIES,\r\n  the FARMER shines unrivalled, for _strength_ of _Argument_,\r\n  _Elegance_ of _Diction_, _Knowledge_ in the _Laws_ of _Great Britain_,\r\n  and _the true interest_ of the COLONIES: A _pathetic_\r\n  and _persuasive eloquence_ runs thro the whole of these\r\n  Letters: They have been printed in every _Colony_ from _Florida_\r\n  to _Nova Scotia_; and the _universal applause_ so justly\r\n  bestowed on the _AUTHOR_, hath fully testified the GRATITUDE\r\n  of the PEOPLE OF AMERICA, for such an\r\n  _able Adviser_ and _affectionate Friend_.\r\n\r\nWritten in a plain, pure style, with illustrations and arguments\r\ndrawn from ecclesiastical, classical and English history, each point\r\nproven with telling accuracy and convincing logic, conciliatory\r\nto the English people, and filled with expressions of loyalty to\r\nthe King, these essays, popularly known as the \"Farmer's Letters,\"\r\nfurnished the basis on which all those who resented the attacks on\r\ntheir liberty were able to unite. Town meetings[2] and Assemblies\r\nvied with each other in their resolutions of thanks. The \"Letters\"\r\nwere published immediately in book form in Philadelphia (three\r\ndifferent editions), New York, Boston (two different editions),\r\nWilliamsburgh, London (with a preface written by Franklin), and\r\nDublin. Franklin was influential, also, in having them translated\r\ninto French, and published on the Continent. Owing to the beauty of\r\nits typography and the excellence of its book-making, the Boston\r\nedition, published by Messrs. Mein & Fleeming, has been selected\r\nfor republication, and has been reprinted line for line and page\r\nfor page, in a type varying but slightly from that used by Mein\r\n& Fleeming. A few typographical errors have been corrected, but\r\nthe irregularities in spelling, wherever they exist throughout\r\nthe various editions, have been retained. The binding also is\r\na reproduction of that of the original. Its publication[3] was\r\nannounced in the \"Boston Chronicle,\" March 14-21, 1768, by the\r\nadvertisement reprinted on the preceding page.\r\n\r\n    [2] The \"Address from the Town of Providence,\" printed from the\r\n    original manuscript, is to be found in the Notes, page li.\r\n\r\n    [3] Two weeks later a letter of thanks voted by the town of Boston\r\n    was added to this edition.\r\n\r\nValuable as these \"Letters\" were at home in uniting all factions\r\nin their measures of resistance, yet their influence abroad was of\r\neven more far-reaching effect. Reprinted in London in June, 1768,\r\nthis two-shilling pamphlet quickly circulated through coffee-house\r\nand drawing-room. In ministerial circles the \"Farmer\" caused great\r\nindignation. In a letter from Franklin, addressed to his son,\r\ndated London, 13th of March, 1768, appears the following: \"My Lord\r\nHillsborough mentioned the 'Farmer's Letters' to me, said that he\r\nhad read them, that they were well written, and he believed he\r\ncould guess who was the author, looking in my face at the same time,\r\nas if he thought it was me. He censured the doctrines as extremely\r\nwild. I have read them as far as Number 8. I know not if any more\r\nhave been published. I should, however, think they had been written\r\nby Mr. Delancey, not having heard any mention of the others you\r\npoint out as joint authors.\"\r\n\r\nGroaning under their own heavy taxation, the troubles of America\r\nhad hitherto appealed but slightly to the average Englishman and\r\nthe sympathies of the English people had become involved in the\r\nlong-drawn-out struggles of Wilkes to obtain his constitutional\r\nrights. The press published little American news. America was\r\nlittle discussed; conditions there were practically unknown to all\r\nbut the trading class, whose members had prospered through the\r\nmonopoly of the constantly increasing commerce with the growing\r\ncolonies. This class, naturally fearing the loss of the magnificent\r\ntrade which had been built up, had long bemoaned the constantly\r\nincreasing friction between the two factions on each side of the\r\nwater. Englishmen in general had hitherto paid little attention to\r\nthe debates over the various acts raising revenue from the colonies.\r\nFrom the time the \"Farmer's Letters\" were published in England the\r\ndifferences between Parliament and colonies were better understood\r\nthere. Untouched and yet alarmed by the political corruption so\r\nprevalent at the time, thinking men saw in these \"Letters\" a warning\r\nthat if their Sovereign was successful in his attempt to take away\r\nconstitutional liberty from their fellow Englishmen across the sea,\r\ntheir own prized liberty at home was in danger. \"American\" news\r\nbecame more frequent in the newspapers, \"Letters to the Printer,\"\r\nthe form of editorials of the day, discussed and criticised the\r\nmeasures of Parliament with great freedom. To the masses, John\r\nDickinson's name soon became very familiar through the agency of\r\nthe press, which under date of June 26-28, 1768, freely noted Isaac\r\nBarré's characterization in the House of Commons of Dickinson as\r\n\"a man who was not only an ornament to his country but an honor\r\nto human nature.\" Almost immediately after the publication of the\r\nLondon edition, the Monthly Review of July, 1768, forcibly called\r\nthe attention of the literary world to the \"Farmer's Letters\" in an\r\nexhaustive review which is reprinted in the Notes, page liii, for\r\nthe purpose of showing the view held by the English Whigs regarding\r\nthe doctrines laid down and arguments used by Dickinson in defence\r\nof his position.\r\n\r\nThe \"London Chronicle,\" under date of September 1st, 1768, printed\r\nthe popular Liberty song, written by Mr. Dickinson, and which, set\r\nto the inspiring air of \"Hearts of Oak,\" was being sung throughout\r\nthe colonies. In order to give the accompanying letter of request\r\nfor the republication of the song, a request which, from its wording\r\ndemonstrates the enthusiasm which the song aroused, the latter is\r\nhere reprinted from the issue of the Boston \"Evening Post\" of August\r\n22, 1768.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MESSIRS FLEETS\r\n\r\nThe following SONG being now much in Vogue and of late is heard\r\nresounding in almost all Companies in Town, and by way of eminence\r\ncalled \"The Liberty Song,\" _you are desired to republish in your_\r\n'circulating' Paper for the Benefit of the whole Continent of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n          [To the Tune of Hearts of Oak.]\r\n\r\n    Come, join Hand in Hand, brave Americans all,\r\n    And rouse your bold Hearts at fair _Liberty's_ Call,\r\n    No _tyrannous Acts_ shall suppress your _just Claim_,\r\n    Or stain with _dishonor_ America's Name.\r\n\r\n    In Freedom we're _born_, & in Freedom we'll _live_,\r\n        Our Purses are ready,\r\n        Steady, Friends, Steady,\r\n    Not as _Slaves_ but as _Freemen_ our money we'll give.\r\n\r\n    Our worthy Forefathers--let's give them a Cheer--\r\n    To _Climates unknown_ did courageously steer;\r\n    Thro' _Oceans_ to _Deserts_ for _Freedom_ they came,\r\n    And dying bequeath'd us their _Freedom_ & _Fame_.\r\n\r\n      In Freedom we're _born_, &c.\r\n\r\n    Their generous Bosoms all Dangers despis'd,\r\n    So _highly_, so _wisely_, their _Birthrights_ they priz'd;\r\n    We'll keep what they gave--we will piously keep,\r\n    Nor frustrate their Toils on the Land or the Deep.\r\n\r\n      In Freedom we're _born_, &c.\r\n\r\n    The Tree their own Hands had to _Liberty_ rear'd,\r\n    They liv'd to behold growing strong and rever'd;\r\n    With Transport then cry'd, 'now our Wishes we gain,\r\n    For our Children shall gather the Fruits of our Pain.'\r\n\r\n      In Freedom we're _born_, &c.\r\n\r\n    Swarms of _Placemen_ and _Pensioners_ soon will appear,\r\n    Like Locusts deforming the Charms of the Year;\r\n    Suns vainly will rise, Showers vainly descend,\r\n    If _we_ are to _drudge for_ what _others_ shall _spend_.\r\n\r\n      In Freedom we're _born_, &c.\r\n\r\n    Then join Hand in Hand brave Americans all,\r\n    By _uniting_ we stand, by _dividing_ we fall;\r\n    _In so righteous a Cause_ let us hope to succeed,\r\n    For Heaven approves of each generous Deed.\r\n\r\n      In Freedom we're _born_, &c.\r\n\r\n    All Ages shall speak with _amaze_ and _applause_,\r\n    Of the _courage_ we'll shew _in support of our laws_;\r\n    To die we can _bear_--but to serve we _disdain_--\r\n    For _Shame_ is to _Freemen_ more dreadful than _Pain_.\r\n\r\n      In freedom we're _born_, &c.\r\n\r\n    This Bumper I crown for our _Sovereign's_ Health,\r\n    And this for _Britannia's_ Glory and Wealth;\r\n    That Wealth and that Glory immortal may be,\r\n    If _She_ is but _just_--and if _we_ are but _free_.\r\n\r\n    In Freedom we're _born_, & in Freedom we'll _live_,\r\n        Our Purses are ready,\r\n        Steady, Friends, Steady,\r\n    Not as _Slaves_, but as _Freemen_ our Money we'll give.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the London \"Chronicle\" of October 4,\r\n1768, demonstrates how completely the arguments and logic of\r\nthe \"Farmer's Letters\" gained popular approval; how constantly\r\nDickinson's name was kept before the public, both at home and\r\nabroad; how his fame was toasted; how he was recognized as the\r\nleader of political thought in the colonies. It shows also the\r\nconstantly increasing interest in American matters taken by the\r\npress of England since the advent of the \"Farmer's Letters,\" for\r\nthe \"American News,\" published in this and other London papers, was\r\nextensively reprinted in the local journals throughout the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taken from the Boston, in New England, Evening Post of August 22,\r\n                                  1768_\r\n\r\n     On Monday the fifteenth instant, the anniversary of the ever\r\n     memorable _Fourteenth of August_, was celebrated by the Sons\r\n     of Liberty in this Town, with extraordinary festivity. At this\r\n     Dawn, the British Flag was displayed on the _Tree of Liberty_,\r\n     and a Discharge of _Fourteen_ Cannon, ranged under the venerable\r\n     Elm, saluted the joyous Day. At eleven o'clock, a very large\r\n     Company of the principal Gentlemen and respectable Inhabitants\r\n     of the Town, met at the Hall under the Tree, while the Streets\r\n     were crowded with a Concourse of People of all Ranks, public\r\n     Notice having been given of the intended Celebration. The\r\n     Musick began at high Noon, performed on various Instruments,\r\n     joined with Voices; and concluding with the universally admired\r\n     _American_ Song of Liberty,[4] the Grandeur of its Sentiment,\r\n     and the easy Flow of its Numbers, together with an exquisite\r\n     Harmony of Sound, afforded sublime Entertainment to a numerous\r\n     Audience, fraught with a noble Ardour in the cause of Freedom:\r\n     The Song was clos'd with the Discharge of Cannon and a Shout of\r\n     Joy; at the same time the Windows of the Neighbouring Houses,\r\n     were adorned with a brilliant appearance of the fair Daughters\r\n     of Liberty, who testified their Approbation by Smiles of\r\n     Satisfaction. The following Toasts succeeded, viz.\r\n\r\n    [4] The Song has been given already in our Chronicle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following toasts may need brief explanation.--R. T. H.

On the 11th day of February, 1768, the Assembly of\r\n     Massachusetts adopted and sent to the various Colonial\r\n     Assemblies a circular letter drawn up by Samuel Adams, informing\r\n     them of the contents of a petition which the Massachusetts\r\n     Assembly had sent to the King. This letter also urged united\r\n     action against the oppressive measures of the Ministry, and\r\n     gave great offense to the King and Ministry. The Secretary for\r\n     the Colonies, Lord Hillsborough, instructed Governor Bernard\r\n     of Massachusetts to order the Assembly to rescind this letter,\r\n     and in case of refusal to dissolve this body. After a thorough\r\n     discussion this request was refused by a vote of \"ninety-two\" to\r\n     \"seventeen.\"\r\n\r\n     Which being finished, the French horns sounded; and after\r\n     another discharge of the cannon, compleating the number\r\n     Ninety-Two, the gentlemen in their carriages repaired to the\r\n     Greyhound Tavern in Roxbury, where a _frugal_ and _elegant_\r\n     entertainment was provided.

See page 51.\r\n\r\n  Upon this happy occasion, the whole company\r\n  with the approbation of their brethren in Roxbury,\r\n  consecrated a tree in the vicinity; under the shade\r\n  of which, on some future anniversary, they say they\r\n  shall commemorate the day, which shall liberate\r\n  America from her present oppression! Then\r\n  making an agreeable excursion round Jamaica\r\n  Pond, in which excursion they received the kind\r\n  salutation of a Friend to the cause by the discharge\r\n  of cannon at six o'clock they returned to Town;\r\n  and passing in slow and orderly procession\r\n  through the principal streets, and the State-House,\r\n  they retired to their respective dwellings. It is\r\n  allowed that this cavalcade surpassed all that has\r\n  ever been seen in America. The joy of the day\r\n  was manly, and an uninterrupted regularity presided\r\n  through the whole.\r\n\r\n  The two illustrations in this volume were\r\n  selected for the purpose of recording prevalent\r\n  contemporary opinions of Dickinson.\r\n\r\n  The frontispiece is a reproduction (slightly\r\n  reduced in size)[5] of the very scarce\r\n  print in which John Dickinson is crudely\r\n  portrayed as the author of the \"Farmer's\r\n  Letters.\" It was first advertised for sale in\r\n  the Pennsylvania \"Chronicle\" under date\r\n  of October 12-17, 1768, as follows:\r\n\r\n         Lately published and sold by R. Bell\r\n        at JAMES EMERSON'S, in Market-street,\r\n             near the river, and at JOHN\r\n          HART'S vendue store, in Southward\r\n                (Price One Shilling)\r\n\r\n        an elegant engraved COPPER PLATE PRINT\r\n            of the PATRIOTIC AMERICAN FARMER;\r\n  The same glazed and framed, price Five Shillings.\r\n\r\n      [5] Reproduced through the courtesy of the Library Company of\r\n      Philadelphia. I wish also to express my obligation to my friends\r\n      Messrs. Wilberforce Eames of the Lenox Library and Robert H.\r\n      Kelby of the New York Historical Society for repeated access to\r\n      the volumes of Colonial Newspapers, etc., in the collections\r\n      under their charge.\r\n\r\n     This specimen of early American engraving, the work of some\r\n     unknown artist and engraver, was undoubtedly inspired by the\r\n     following article which appeared in the Pennsylvania \"Chronicle\"\r\n     for May, 9-16, 1768, as well as the many other newspapers in\r\n     the colonies, so eager was the press to publish any information\r\n     concerning the author of the \"Farmer's Letters.\" The inscription\r\n     is thus explained as well as the elimination of the vowels from\r\n     Dickinson's name.\r\n\r\n                            PHILADELPHIA\r\n\r\n     On Tuesday last, by order of the Governor and Society of Fort\r\n     St. David's, fourteen Gentlemen, members of that Company, waited\r\n     upon J-n D-ck-nson Esq; and presented the following address, in\r\n     a Box of Heart of Oak.\r\n\r\n     RESPECTED SIR,\r\n\r\n     When a Man of Abilities, prompted by Love of his Country, exerts\r\n     them in her Cause, and renders her the most eminent Services,\r\n     _not to be sensible_, of the Benefits received, is Stupidity;\r\n     _not to be grateful for them_, is Baseness.\r\n\r\n     Influenced by this Sentiment, we, the Governor and Company\r\n     of Fort St. David's, who among other Inhabitants of _British\r\n     America_, are indebted to you for your most excellent and\r\n     generous Vindication of Liberties dearer to us than our Lives,\r\n     beg Leave to return you our heartiest Thanks, and offer to you\r\n     the greatest Mark of Esteem, that, as a Body, it is in our Power\r\n     to bestow, by admitting you, as we hereby do, a Member of our\r\n     Society.\r\n\r\n     When that destructive Project of _Taxation_, which your\r\n     Integrity and Knowledge so signally contributed to baffle\r\n     about two years ago, was lately renewed under a _Disguise_ so\r\n     _artfully contrived_ as to delude Millions, You, sir, _watchful_\r\n     for the Interests of Your Country, _perfectly_ acquainted with\r\n     them, and _undaunted_ in asserting them, ALONE detected the\r\n     Monster concealed from others by an altered Appearance, exposed\r\n     it, stripped of its insidious covering, in its own horrid Shape,\r\n     and, we firmly trust by the Blessing of God on Your Wisdom and\r\n     Virtue, will again extricate the _British_ Colonies on this\r\n     Continent from the cruel Snares of Oppression; for we already\r\n     perceive these Colonies ROUSED _by your strong and seasonable_\r\n     Call, pursuing the salutary Measures advised by You for\r\n     obtaining Redress.\r\n\r\n     Nor is this all that you have performed for Your NATIVE LAND.\r\n     _Animated by a sacred_ Zeal, _guided by Truth and supported\r\n     by Justice_, YOU _have penetrated to the Foundations of the\r\n     Constitution_, have _poured_ the clearest Light on the important\r\n     _Points_, hitherto involved in a Darkness bewildering even\r\n     the Learned, and have _established_ with an amazing Force\r\n     and Plainness of Argument, the TRUE DISTINCTIONS and GRAND\r\n     PRINCIPLES, that will _fully instruct Ages_ YET UNBORN, what\r\n     Rights belong to them, and the best Methods of defending them.\r\n\r\n     To Merit far less distinguished, ancient _Greece_ or _Rome_\r\n     would have decreed Statues and Honours without Number: But it is\r\n     _Your Fortune_ and _your Glory_, Sir, that You live in _such_\r\n     Times, and possess _such exalted Worth_, that the _Envy_ of\r\n     those, whose _Duty_ it is to applaud You, can conceive no other\r\n     Consolation, than by withholding those Praises in Public, which\r\n     all honest Men acknowledge in Private that you have deserved.\r\n\r\n     We present to you, sir, a small gift of a Society not dignified\r\n     by any legal authority; But when you consider this gift as\r\n     expressive of the _sincere Affection_ of many of your Fellow\r\n     Citizens for Your Person, and of their _unlimited Approbation_\r\n     of the noble Principles maintained in your unequalled Labours,\r\n     we hope this Testimony of our Sentiments will be acceptable to\r\n     you.\r\n\r\n     May that all-gracious Being, which in kindness to these colonies\r\n     gave your valuable Life Existence _at the critical Period_ when\r\n     it will be most wanted, grant it a long Continuance, filled with\r\n     every Felicity; and when your Country sustains its dreadful\r\n     loss, may you enjoy the Happiness of Heaven, and on Earth may\r\n     your Memory be cherished, as we doubt not it will be, to the\r\n     latest Posterity.\r\n\r\n     _Signed by the Order of the Society_,\r\n                           JOHN BAYARD, Secretary.\r\n\r\n     The box was finely decorated, and the Inscription neatly done in\r\n     Letters of Gold.

It pictures\r\na porcelain statuette of Mrs. Catherine Macaulay, a well-known\r\nhistorian, whose \"History of England from the Accession of James the\r\nFirst to that of the Brunswick Line\" and other historical writings\r\nmet with great approval among the Whig party in England and whose\r\ndecided approval of the stand taken by the colonies, gave her great\r\npopularity in America. This statuette, measuring 13½ inches in\r\nheight, is modeled to a certain extent after the statue of this lady\r\nwhich was erected in 1777 in the Church of St. Stephen, Walbrook,\r\nLondon. Mrs. Macaulay appears leaning upon her \"Histories of\r\nEngland,\" which rest on the top of a pedestal, on the front of which\r\nis the inscription, \"Government a Power Delegated for the Happiness\r\nof Mankind conducted by Wisdom, Justice and Mercy.\" Beneath are\r\nthe words, \"_American Congress_.\" On the side of the pedestal the\r\nname of _Dickinson_ appears, preceded by the names of those noble\r\nwriters, England's great advocates and expounders of Constitutional\r\nliberty, Sydney, Hampden, Milton, Locke, Harrington, Ludlow and\r\nMarvel. This beautiful porcelain statuette was moulded at the\r\nChelsea factory in 1777, the same year in which Boswell chronicles\r\nDr. Johnson's visit there, noting, \"The china was beautiful, but Dr.\r\nJohnson justly observed it was too dear, for he could have vessels\r\nof silver as cheap as were here made of porcelain.\"\r\n\r\nThe space at my disposal prevents my quoting many a \"Letter to the\r\nPrinter\" appealing for justice for the Colonials as well as numerous\r\ncontributed articles which appeared during the next few years in\r\nthe English press, the contents of which clearly show how strongly\r\nDickinson's arguments had influenced their respective authors.\r\nWhile it is true that these sentiments were attacked both at home\r\nand abroad, the attacks soon lost their vehemence. Strange as it\r\nmay seem, more protests against the course of the ministry than\r\ndenunciations of the doings of the colonial Assemblies are found in\r\nthe columns of the English press of the period. The demand for the\r\narguments contained in the \"Farmer's Letters\" was not lessened by\r\nsubsequent events as their popularity demanded the publishing of\r\nanother London edition in 1774.\r\n\r\nCertainly to John Dickinson for his masterly defence of the rights\r\nof the Colonies America owes an everlasting debt of gratitude.\r\nThe logic of his claims and his warnings as to what must be the\r\nultimate result of the ministerial encroachments upon the liberties\r\nof Englishmen did much to win over to the American cause in England\r\nthat strong ally, the support of a large body of thoughtful\r\nEnglishmen. These men actively condemned the ministerial actions and\r\nduring the war which followed caused the course of the government\r\nto be bitterly opposed by an influential and constantly growing\r\nminority in Parliament. Through their efforts was fostered a public\r\nsentiment which caused the war to be prosecuted in a half-hearted\r\nmanner and obliged a power-loving King to fill the depleted ranks\r\nof his army with German mercenaries, so impossible was it to force\r\na sufficient number of his own liberty-loving subjects to fight\r\nagainst their kindred living in the land so happily alluded to by\r\na contributor to the London \"Chronicle\" (June 3-6, 1769), in the\r\nfollowing poem:\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Genius of_ America _to her Sons_\r\n\r\n    Who'd know the sweets of Liberty?\r\n    'Tis to climbe the mountain's brow,\r\n    Thence to discern rough industry,\r\n    At the harrow or the plough;\r\n    'Tis where my sons their crops have sown,\r\n    Calling the harvest all their own;\r\n    'Tis where the heart to truth allied,\r\n    Never felt unmanly fear;\r\n    'Tis where the eye with milder pride,\r\n    Nobly sheds sweet pity's tear;\r\n    Such as America yet shall see,\r\n    These are the sweets of Liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nAn address from the Moderator and Freemen of the Town of Providence\r\nin the Colony of Rhode-Island, and Providence Plantation convened in\r\nopen Meeting the 20th day of June, 1768, to the Author of a Series\r\nof Letters signed\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n     _Sir_,\r\n\r\n     In your Retirement, \"near the Banks of the River Delaware,\"\r\n     where you are compleating, in a rational way, the Number of Days\r\n     allotted to you by Divine Goodness, the consciousness of having\r\n     employed those Talents which God hath bestowed upon You, for the\r\n     Support of our Rights, must afford you a Satisfaction vastly\r\n     exceeding that, which is derived to you from the universal\r\n     Approbation of Your Letters,--However amidst the general\r\n     Acclamation of your Praise, we the Moderator and Freemen of the\r\n     ancient Town of Providence cannot be silent; although we would\r\n     not offend your Delicacy, or incur the Imputation of Flattery in\r\n     expressing our Gratitude to you.\r\n\r\n     Your Benevolence to Mankind, fully discoverable from your\r\n     Writings, doubtless caused you to address your countrymen, whom\r\n     you tenderly call _Dear_ and _Beloved_, in a Series of Letters,\r\n     wherein you have with a great Judgment, and in the most spirited\r\n     and forcible Manner explained their Rights and Privileges; and\r\n     vindicated them against such as would reduce these extensive\r\n     Dominions of His Majesty to Poverty, Misery, and Slavery. This\r\n     Your patriotic Exertion in our Cause and indeed in the Cause of\r\n     all the human Race in some Degree, hath rendered you very dear\r\n     to us, although we know not your Person.\r\n\r\n     We deplore the Frailty of human Nature, in that it is necessary\r\n     that we should be frequently awakened into Attention to our\r\n     Duty in Matters very plain and incontrovertible, if we would\r\n     suffer ourselves to consider them. From this Inattention to\r\n     Things evidently the Duty and Interest of the World, we suppose\r\n     despotic Rule to have originated, and all the Train of Miseries\r\n     consequent thereupon.\r\n\r\n     The virtuous and good Man, who rouses an injured Country from\r\n     their Lethargy, and animates them into active and successful\r\n     Endeavours for casting off the Burdens imposed on them, and\r\n     effecting a full Enjoyment of the Rights of Men, which no Human\r\n     Creature ought to violate, will merit the warmest Expressions of\r\n     Gratitude from his Countrymen, for his Instrumentality in saving\r\n     them and their Posterity.\r\n\r\n     As the very Design of instituting civil Government in the World\r\n     was to secure to Individuals a quiet Enjoyment of their native\r\n     Rights, wherever there is a Departure from this great and only\r\n     End, impious Force succeeds. The Blessings of a just Government,\r\n     and the Horror of brutal Violence are both inexpressible. As\r\n     the latter is generally brought upon People by Degrees, it will\r\n     be their Duty to watch against even the smallest attempt to\r\n     \"innovate a single Iota\" in their Privilege.\r\n\r\n     With Hearts truly loyal to the King, we feel the greatest\r\n     concern at divers Acts of the British Parliament, relative to\r\n     these colonies. We are clear and unanimous in Sentiment that\r\n     they are subversive of our Liberties, and derogatory to the\r\n     Power and Dignity of the several Legislatures established in\r\n     America.\r\n\r\n     Permit us, Sir, to assure you that we feel an ineffable\r\n     Gratitude to you, for sending forth your Letters at a Time when\r\n     the Exercise of great Abilities was necessary. We sincerely wish\r\n     that You may see the Fruit of your Labours. We on our parts\r\n     shall be ready at all Times to evince to the World that we will\r\n     not surrender our privileges to any of our Fellow Subjects, but\r\n     will earnestly contend for them, hoping that the \"Almighty will\r\n     look upon our righteous contest with gracious approbation.\" We\r\n     hope that the Conduct of the Colonies on this Occasion will be\r\n     \"peaceable, prudent, firm, and joint; and such as will show\r\n     their Loyalty to the best of Sovereigns, and that they know what\r\n     they owe to themselves as well as to Great-Britain.\"\r\n\r\n     Signed by Order\r\n\r\n                           JAMES ANGELL, Town Clerk.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFROM THE MONTHLY REVIEW. LONDON, JULY, 1768.\r\n\r\n\"_Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, to the Inhabitants of the\r\nBritish Colonies. 8vo. 2s. Almon. 1768._\r\n\r\n\"We have, in the Letters now before us, a calm yet full inquiry into\r\nthe right of the British parliament, lately assumed, to tax the\r\nAmerican colonies; the unconstitutional nature of which attempt is\r\nmaintained in a well-connected chain of close and manly reasoning;\r\nand though from this character, it is evident that detached\r\npassages must appear to a disadvantage, yet it is but just to\r\ngive our Readers some specimens of the manner in which the author\r\nasserts the rights of his American brethren; subjects of the British\r\ngovernment, as he pleads, carrying their birthrights with them\r\nwherever they settle as such.\r\n\r\n     'Colonies, says he, were formerly planted by warlike nations,\r\n     to keep their enemies in awe; to relieve their country\r\n     overburthened with inhabitants; or to discharge a number of\r\n     discontented and troublesome citizens. But in more modern ages,\r\n     the spirit of violence being, in some measure, if the expression\r\n     may be allowed, sheathed in commerce, colonies have been settled\r\n     by the nations of Europe for the purposes of trade. These\r\n     purposes were to be attained, by the colonies raising for their\r\n     mother country those things which she did not produce herself;\r\n     and by supplying themselves from her with things they wanted.\r\n     These were the _national_ objects in the commencement of our\r\n     colonies, and have been uniformly so in their promotion.\r\n\r\n     'To answer these grand purposes, perfect liberty was known to\r\n     be necessary; all history proving, that trade and freedom are\r\n     nearly related to each other. By a due regard to this wise and\r\n     just plan, the infant colonies, exposed in the unknown climates\r\n     and unexplored wildernesses of this new world, lived, grew, and\r\n     flourished.\r\n\r\n     'The parent country, with undeviating prudence and virtue,\r\n     attentive to the first principles of colonization, drew to\r\n     herself the benefits she might reasonably expect, and preserved\r\n     to her children the blessings, upon which those benefits were\r\n     founded. She made laws, obliging her colonies to carry to her\r\n     all those products which she wanted for her own use; and all\r\n     those raw materials which she chose herself to work up. Besides\r\n     this restriction, she forbade them to procure _manufactures_\r\n     from any other part of the globe, or even the _products_ of\r\n     _European_ countries, which alone could rival her, without\r\n     being first brought to her. In short, by a variety of laws,\r\n     she regulated their trade in such a manner as she thought most\r\n     conducive to their mutual advantage and her own welfare. A power\r\n     was reserved to the crown of _repealing_ any laws that should be\r\n     enacted: the executive authority of government was also lodged\r\n     in the crown, and its representatives; and an _appeal_ was\r\n     secured to the crown from all judgments in the administration of\r\n     justice.\r\n\r\n     'For all these powers, established by the mother country over\r\n     the colonies; for all these immense emoluments derived by her\r\n     from them; for all their difficulties and distresses in fixing\r\n     themselves, what was the recompense made them? A communication\r\n     of her rights in general, and particularly of that great one,\r\n     the foundation of all the rest--that their property, acquired\r\n     with so much pain and hazard, should be disposed of by none\r\n     but themselves--or, to use beautiful and emphatic language of\r\n     the sacred scriptures, \"that they should sit _every man_ under\r\n     his vine, and under his fig-tree, and _none should make them\r\n     afraid_.\"\r\n\r\n     'Can any man of candour and knowledge deny that these\r\n     institutions form an affinity between Great Britain and her\r\n     colonies, that sufficiently secures their dependence upon her?\r\n     Or that for her to levy taxes upon them is to reverse the\r\n     nature of things? Or that she can pursue such a measure without\r\n     reducing them to a state of vassalage?\r\n\r\n     'If any person cannot conceive the supremacy of Great Britain\r\n     to exist, without the power of laying taxes to levy money upon\r\n     us, the history of the colonies, and of Great Britain, since\r\n     their settlement, will prove the contrary. He will there find\r\n     the amazing advantages arising to her from them--the constant\r\n     exercise of her supremacy--and their filial submission to it,\r\n     without a single rebellion, or even the thought of one, from\r\n     their first emigration to this moment--and all these things have\r\n     happened, without one instance of Great Britain's laying taxes\r\n     to levy money upon them.\r\n\r\n     'How many British authors have demonstrated, that the present\r\n     wealth, power and glory of their country, are founded upon\r\n     these colonies? As constantly as streams tend to the ocean have\r\n     they been pouring the fruits of all their labours into their\r\n     mother's lap. Good heaven! and shall a total oblivion of former\r\n     tendernesses and blessings, be spread over the minds of a good\r\n     and wise nation by the sordid arts of intriguing men, who,\r\n     covering their selfish projects under pretences of public good,\r\n     first enrage their countrymen into a frenzy of passion, and then\r\n     advance their own influence and interest, by gratifying the\r\n     passion, which they themselves have basely excited.\r\n\r\n     'Hitherto Great Britain has been contented with her prosperity,\r\n     moderation has been the rule of her conduct. But now, a\r\n     generous, humane people, that so often have protected the\r\n     liberty of _strangers_, is inflamed into an attempt to tear a\r\n     privilege from her own children, which if executed, must, in\r\n     their opinion, sink them into slaves: _and for what_? for a\r\n     pernicious power, not necessary to her as her own experience may\r\n     convince her; but horribly dreadful and detestable to her.\r\n\r\n     'It seems extremely probable, that when cool, dispassionate\r\n     prosperity, shall consider the affectionate intercourse, the\r\n     reciprocal benefits, and the unsuspecting confidence, that have\r\n     subsisted between these colonies and their parent country, for\r\n     such a length of time, they will execrate, with the bitterest\r\n     curses, the infamous memory of those men, whose pestilential\r\n     ambition unnecessarily, wantonly, first opened the sources\r\n     of civil discord between them; first turned their love into\r\n     jealousy; and first taught these provinces, filled with grief\r\n     and anxiety, to enquire.'\r\n\r\n\"As every community possessed of valuable privileges, and desirous\r\nto preserve the enjoyment of them, ought to be very cautious of\r\nadmitting innovations from their established forms of political\r\nadministration, our Author does not confine his views to the\r\nimmediate effects of the laws lately passed regarding America; but\r\nconsiders the necessary tendency of the precedents; thus he says,\r\n\r\n     'I have looked over every _statute_ relating to these colonies,\r\n     from their first settlement to this time; and I find everyone\r\n     of them founded on this principle, till the _stamp-act_\r\n     administration. _All before_, are calculated to regulate trade,\r\n     and preserve or promote a mutually beneficial intercourse\r\n     between the several constituent parts of the empire; and\r\n     though many of them imposed duties on trade, yet those duties\r\n     were always imposed _with design_ to restrain the commerce of\r\n     one part, that was injurious to another, and thus to promote\r\n     the general welfare. The raising a revenue thereby was never\r\n     intended. Thus, the king by his judges in his courts of justice,\r\n     impose fines, which altogether amount to a very considerable\r\n     sum, and contribute to the support of government; but this is\r\n     merely a consequence arising from restrictions, that only meant\r\n     to keep peace, and prevent confusion; and surely a man would\r\n     argue very loosely, who should conclude from hence, that the\r\n     king has a right to levy money in general upon his subjects.\r\n     Never did the British parliament, till the period above\r\n     mentioned, think of imposing duties in America, _for the purpose\r\n     of raising a revenue_. Mr. Grenville first introduced this\r\n     language, in the preamble to the fourth of George III. chap. 15,\r\n     which has these words--\"and whereas it is just and necessary\r\n     that _a revenue be raised in your majesty's said dominions in\r\n     America, for defraying the expenses of defending, protecting\r\n     and securing the same_: We your majesty's most dutiful and\r\n     loyal subjects, _the commons of Great Britain_, in Parliament\r\n     assembled, being desirous to make some provisions in this\r\n     present session of parliament, _towards raising the said revenue\r\n     in America_, have resolved to _give_ and _grant_ unto your\r\n     majesty the several rates and duties hereinafter mentioned,\"\r\n     etc.\r\n\r\n     'A few months after came the _stamp-act_, which reciting this,\r\n     proceeds in the same strange mode of expression, thus--\"And\r\n     whereas it is just and necessary, that provision be made _for\r\n     raising a further revenue within your majesty's dominions in\r\n     America, towards defraying the said expenses_, we your majesty's\r\n     most dutiful and loyal subjects, the _commons_ of _Great\r\n     Britain, etc., give and grant_,\" etc., as before.\r\n\r\n     'The last act, granting duties upon paper, etc., carefully\r\n     pursues these modern precedents. The preamble is, \"Whereas it is\r\n     expedient, _that a revenue should be raised in your majesty's\r\n     dominions in America for making a more certain and adequate\r\n     provision for defraying the charge of the administration of\r\n     justice, and the support of civil government in such provinces,\r\n     where it shall be found necessary; and towards the further\r\n     defraying of the expences of defending, protecting, and securing\r\n     the said dominions_, we your majesty's most dutiful and loyal\r\n     subjects, the _commons of Great Britain_, etc. give _and\r\n     grant_,\" etc. as before.\r\n\r\n     'Here we may observe an authority expresly claimed and exerted\r\n     to impose duties on these colonies; not for the regulation of\r\n     trade; not for the preservation or promotion of a mutually\r\n     beneficial intercourse between the several constituent parts\r\n     of the empire, heretofore the _sole objects_ of parliamentary\r\n     institutions; _but for the single purpose of levying money upon\r\n     us_.'\r\n\r\n\"Again in another place,\r\n\r\n     'What but the indisputable, the acknowledged exclusive right\r\n     of the colonies to tax themselves, could be the reason, that\r\n     in this long period of more than one hundred and fifty years,\r\n     no statute was ever passed for the sole purpose of raising a\r\n     revenue from the colonies? And how clear, how cogent must that\r\n     reason be, to which every parliament, and every ministry for so\r\n     long a time submitted, without a single attempt to innovate?\r\n\r\n     'England, in part of that course of years, and Great Britain,\r\n     in other parts, was engaged in several fierce and expensive\r\n     wars; troubled with some tumultuous and bold parliaments;\r\n     governed by many daring and wicked ministers; yet none of them\r\n     ever ventured to touch the Palladium of American liberty.\r\n     Ambition, avarice, faction, tyranny, all revered it. Whenever it\r\n     was necessary to raise money on the colonies, the requisitions\r\n     of the crown were made, and dutifully complied with. The\r\n     parliament, from time to time, regulated their trade, and that\r\n     of the rest of the empire, to preserve their dependence and the\r\n     connections of the whole in good order.'\r\n\r\n\"The amount of present duties exacted in an unusual way is no part\r\nof the object in question; for our Pennsylvanian Farmer observes:\r\n\r\n     'Some persons may think this act of no consequence, because\r\n     the duties are so _small_. A fatal error. _That_ is the very\r\n     circumstance most alarming to me. For I am convinced, that the\r\n     authors of this law would never have obtained an act to raise\r\n     so trifling a sum as it must do, had they not intended by it to\r\n     establish a _precedent_ for future use. To console ourselves\r\n     with the _smallness_ of the duties, is to walk deliberately into\r\n     the snare that is set for us, praising the _neatness_ of the\r\n     workmanship. Suppose the duties imposed by the late act could\r\n     be paid by these distressed colonies with the utmost ease, and\r\n     that the purposes to which they are to be applied, were the most\r\n     reasonable and equitable that can be conceived, the contrary of\r\n     which I hope to demonstrate before these letters are concluded;\r\n     yet even in such a supposed case, these colonies ought to regard\r\n     the act with abhorrence. For who are a free people? Not those,\r\n     over whom government is reasonably and equitably exercised, but\r\n     those, who live under a government so _constitutionally checked_\r\n     and controuled, that proper provision is made against its being\r\n     otherwise exercised.\r\n\r\n     'The late act is founded on the destruction of this\r\n     constitutional security. If the parliament have a right to lay\r\n     a duty of four shillings and eight pence on a hundred weight\r\n     of glass, or a ream of paper, they have a right to lay a duty\r\n     of any other sum on either. They may raise the duty, as the\r\n     author before quoted says has been done in some countries,\r\n     till it \"exceeds seventeen or eighteen times the value of the\r\n     commodity.\" In short, if they have a right to levy a tax of\r\n     _one penny_ upon us, they have a right to levy a _million_ upon\r\n     us; for where does their right stop? At any given number of\r\n     pence, shillings or pounds? To attempt to limit their right,\r\n     after granting it to exist at all, is as contrary to reason--as\r\n     granting it to exist at all, is contrary to justice. If they\r\n     have any right to tax us--then, whether our own money shall\r\n     continue in our pockets or not, depends no longer on _us_, but\r\n     on _them_, \"There is nothing which \"we\" can call our own; or,\r\n     to use the words of Mr. Locke--_what property have \"we\" in that\r\n     which another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to himself_?\"\r\n\r\n     'These duties which will inevitably be levied upon us--which are\r\n     now levying upon us--are _expresly laid for the sole purpose of\r\n     taking money_. This is the true definition of \"taxes.\" They are\r\n     therefore _taxes_. This money is to be taken from _us_. We are\r\n     therefore _taxed_. _Those_ who are _taxed_ without their own\r\n     consent, expressed by themselves or their representatives are\r\n     _slaves_. _We are taxed_ without our own consent, expressed by\r\n     ourselves or representatives. _We_ are therefore slaves.'\r\n\r\n\"Further,\r\n\r\n     'Indeed nations in general are more apt to _feel_ than to\r\n     _think_; and therefore nations in general have lost their\r\n     liberty: for as the violation of the rights of the governed are\r\n     commonly not only _specious_, but _small_ at the beginning,\r\n     they spread over the multitude in such a manner, as to touch\r\n     individuals but slightly; thus they are disregarded. The\r\n     power or profit that arises from these violations, _centering\r\n     in a few persons_, is to them considerable. For this reason,\r\n     the _Governors_ having in view their particular purposes,\r\n     successively preserve an uniformity of conduct for attaining\r\n     them: they regularly increase and multiply the first injuries,\r\n     till at length the inattentive people are compelled to perceive\r\n     the heaviness of their burthen. They begin to complain\r\n     and inquire--but too late. They find their oppressions so\r\n     strengthened by success, and themselves so entangled in examples\r\n     of express authority on the part of their rulers, and of tacit\r\n     recognition on their own part, that they are quite confounded:\r\n     for millions entertain no other idea of the _legality_ of power,\r\n     than that it is founded on the exercise of power. They then\r\n     voluntarily fasten their chains by adopting a pusillanimous\r\n     opinion \"that there will be too much danger in attempting a\r\n     remedy\"--or another opinion no less fatal, \"that the government\r\n     has a _right_ to treat them as it does.\" They then seek a\r\n     wretched relief for their minds, by persuading themselves, that\r\n     to yield their _obedience_, is to discharge their _duty_. The\r\n     _deplorable_ poverty of spirit, that prostrates all the dignity\r\n     bestowed by Divine Providence on our nature--of course succeeds.'\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the proper conduct of the colonies on this occasion\r\nhe premises the following questions:\r\n\r\n     'Has not the parliament _expressly avowed_ their _intention_\r\n     of raising money from us for _certain_ purposes? Is not this\r\n     scheme _popular_ in Great Britain? Will the taxes imposed by\r\n     the late act, _answer_ those purposes? If it will, must it\r\n     not take an immense sum from us? If it will not, is it to be\r\n     _expected_, that the parliament will not _fully execute_ their\r\n     _intention_, when it is pleasing at home, _and not opposed_\r\n     here? Must not this be done by imposing _new taxes_? Will not\r\n     every addition thus made to our taxes, be an addition to the\r\n     power of the British legislature, _by increasing the number of\r\n     officers_ employed in the collection? Will not every additional\r\n     tax therefore render it _more difficult_ to abrogate any of\r\n     them? When a branch of revenue is once established, does it not\r\n     appear to many people _invidious_ and undutiful, to attempt to\r\n     abolish it? If taxes sufficient to _accomplish_ the intention of\r\n     the parliament, are imposed by the parliament, what taxes will\r\n     remain to be imposed by our assemblies? If _no material_ taxes\r\n     remain to be imposed by them, what must become of _them_, and\r\n     the people they represent?'\r\n\r\n\"Our Author all along, however, asserts that the real interest of\r\nEnglish America consists in its proper dependence on the mother\r\ncountry, at the same time that he strenuously exhorts his countrymen\r\nto oppose, by all the suitable means in their power, every\r\nincroachment on those constitutions under the sanction of which they\r\nsettled on those remote and uncultivated shores, whereon they have\r\nso industriously established themselves. He remarks with a spirit\r\nwhich no one, it is apprehended, can condemn:\r\n\r\n     'I am no further concerned in anything affecting America, than\r\n     any one of you; and when liberty leaves it, I can quit it much\r\n     more conveniently than most of you: but while divine providence,\r\n     that gave me existence in a land of freedom, permits my head\r\n     to think, my lips to speak, and my hands to move, I shall so\r\n     highly and gratefully value the blessing received, as to take\r\n     care, that my silence and inactivity shall not give my implied\r\n     assent to any act, degrading my brethren and myself from the\r\n     birthright, wherewith heaven itself \"hath made us free.'\r\n\r\n\"The consequence of Great Britain exerting this disagreeable power,\r\nhe shews, in a long train of arguments, to have a tendency very\r\nfatal to the liberty of America, which he illustrates by examining\r\ninto the application of the pensions on the Irish establishment;\r\nand sums up his reasoning with the following positions:\r\n\r\n     'Let these _truths_ be indelibly impressed on our mind--_that\r\n     we cannot be_ happy, _without being_ free--that we cannot be\r\n     free, _without being secure_--in our property--that we cannot\r\n     be secure in our property, if, _without our consent, others\r\n     may, as by right, take it away--that taxes imposed on us by\r\n     parliament_, do thus take it away--that _duties laid for the\r\n     sole purposes of raising money_, are taxes--that attempts to\r\n     lay such duties _should be instantly and firmly opposed_--that\r\n     this opposition can never be effectual, unless it is the united\r\n     effort of those provinces--that therefore _benevolence of temper\r\n     towards each other_, and _unanimity of counsels_, are essential\r\n     to the welfare of the whole--and lastly, that for this reason,\r\n     every man amongst us, who in any manner would encourage either\r\n     dissention, diffidence, or indifference, between these colonies,\r\n     is an enemy to _himself_, and to _his country_.\r\n\r\n     'The belief of these truths, I verily think, my countrymen,\r\n     is indispensably necessary to your happiness. I beseech you,\r\n     therefore, \"teach them diligently unto your children, and talk\r\n     of them when you sit in your houses, and when you walk by the\r\n     way, and when you lie down and when you rise up.\"\r\n\r\n     '_What_ have these colonies to _ask_, while they continue\r\n     free? or what have they to _dread_, but insidious attempts to\r\n     subvert their freedom? _Their prosperity_ does not depend on\r\n     _ministerial favours doled_ out to particular provinces. _They_\r\n     form one political body, of which _each_ colony is a _member_.\r\n     _Their happiness_ is founded on their constitution; and is to\r\n     be promoted by preserving that constitution in unabated vigour,\r\n     _throughout every part_. A spot, a speck of decay, however small\r\n     the limb on which it appears, and however remote it may seem\r\n     from the vitals, should be alarming. We have _all the rights_\r\n     requisite for our prosperity. The _legal authority_ of Great\r\n     Britain may indeed lay hard restrictions upon us; but, like the\r\n     spear of Telephus, it will cure as well as wound. Her unkindness\r\n     will instruct and compel us, after some time to discover, in\r\n     our _industry_ and _frugality_, surprising remedies--_if our\r\n     rights continue_ unviolated: for as long as the _products_ of\r\n     our _labour_, and the _rewards_ of our _care_, can properly\r\n     be called _our own_, so long will it be worth our while to be\r\n     _industrious_ and _frugal_. But if we plow--sow--reap--gather\r\n     and thresh--we find, that we plow--sow--reap--gather and thresh\r\n     _for others_, whose pleasure is to be the SOLE limitation _how\r\n     much_ they shall _take_ and _how much_ they _shall leave_, WHY\r\n     should we repeat the unprofitable toil? Horses and oxen are\r\n     content with _that portion of the fruits of their work_, which\r\n     their _owners_ assign to them, in order to keep them strong\r\n     enough to raise successive crops; but even _these beasts_ will\r\n     not submit to draw for their masters, until they are _subdued_\r\n     with _whips_ and _goads_. Let us take care of our rights, and we\r\n     _therein_ take care of our _property_. \"SLAVERY IS EVER PRECEDED\r\n     BY SLEEP.\" _Individuals_ may be _dependent_ on ministers if\r\n     they please. _States should scorn it_; and if _you_ are not\r\n     wanting to yourselves, you will have a _proper regard_ paid\r\n     _you_ by _those_, to whom if you are not _respectable_, you will\r\n     infallibly be contemptible. But--_if we have already forgot_\r\n     the _reasons_ that urged us, with unexampled unanimity, to\r\n     exert ourselves two years ago--if _our zeal_ for the _public\r\n     good_ is _worn out_ before the _homespun cloaths_ which it\r\n     caused us to have made--if _our_ resolutions are so faint, as\r\n     by our present conduct to _condemn_ our own late _successful_\r\n     example--if _we are not affected_ by any reverence for the\r\n     memory of our ancestors, who transmitted to us that freedom\r\n     in which they had been blest--if _we are not animated_ by any\r\n     regard for posterity, to whom, by the most sacred obligations,\r\n     we are bound to deliver down the invaluable inheritance--THEN,\r\n     indeed, any _minister_, or any _tool_ of a minister, or any\r\n     _creature_ of a tool of a minister--or any _lower instrument_ of\r\n     _administration_, if lower there be, is a _personage_ whom it\r\n     may be dangerous to offend.'\r\n\r\n\"In justification of the Letter-writer's loyalty, and the integrity\r\nof his intentions, he declares in a note:\r\n\r\n     'If any person shall imagine that he discovers in these letters\r\n     the least disaffection towards our most excellent sovereign, and\r\n     the parliament of Great Britain, or the least dislike of the\r\n     dependence of these colonies on that kingdom, I beg that such\r\n     person will not form any judgment on _particular expressions_,\r\n     but will consider the _tenour_ of all the letters taken\r\n     together. In that case, I flatter myself that every unprejudiced\r\n     reader will be _convinced_, that the true interests of Great\r\n     Britain are as dear to me as they ought to be to every good\r\n     subject.\r\n\r\n     'If I am an enthusiast in anything, it is in my zeal for\r\n     the _perpetual dependance_ of these colonies on the mother\r\n     country.--A dependance founded on mutual benefits, the\r\n     continuance of which can be secured only by _mutual affections_.\r\n     Therefore it is, that with extreme apprehension I view the\r\n     smallest seeds of discontent, which are unwarily scattered\r\n     abroad. Fifty or sixty years will make astonishing alterations\r\n     in these colonies; and this consideration should render it\r\n     the business of Great Britain more and more to cultivate our\r\n     good dispositions toward her: but the misfortune is, that\r\n     those _great men_, who are wrestling for power at home, think\r\n     themselves very slightly interested in the prosperity of their\r\n     country _fifty_ or _sixty_ years hence; but are deeply concerned\r\n     in blowing up a popular clamour for supposed _immediate\r\n     advantages_.\r\n\r\n     'For my part, I regard Great Britain as a _bulwark_ happily\r\n     fixed between these colonies and the powerful nations of Europe.\r\n     That kingdom is our advanced post or fortification, _which\r\n     remaining safe_, we under its protection enjoying peace, may\r\n     diffuse the blessings of religion, science, and liberty, through\r\n     remote wildernesses. It is, therefore, incontestably our _duty_\r\n     and our _interest_ to support the strength of Great Britain.\r\n     When, confiding in that strength, she begins to forget from\r\n     whence it arose, it will be an easy thing to shew the source.\r\n     She may readily be reminded of the loud alarm spread among her\r\n     merchants and tradesmen, by the universal association of these\r\n     colonies, at the time of the _stamp-act_, not to import any of\r\n     her MANUFACTURES. In the year 1718, the Russians and Swedes\r\n     entered into an agreement, not to suffer Great Britain to export\r\n     any naval stores from their dominions, but in Russian or Swedish\r\n     ships, and at their own prices. Great Britain was distressed.\r\n     _Pitch_ and _tar_ rose to _three pounds_ a barrel. At length\r\n     she thought of getting these articles from the colonies; and\r\n     the attempt succeeding, they fell down to fifteen shillings. In\r\n     the year 1756, Great Britain was threatened with an invasion:\r\n     An easterly wind blowing for six weeks, she could not MAN\r\n     her fleet; and the whole nation was thrown into the utmost\r\n     consternation. The wind changed. The American ships arrived.\r\n     The fleet sailed in ten or fifteen days. There are some other\r\n     reflections on this subject worthy of the most deliberate\r\n     attention of the British parliament; but they are of such a\r\n     nature that I do not chuse to mention them publicly. I thought\r\n     I discharged my duty to my country, by taking the liberty, in\r\n     the year 1765, while the _stamp-act_ was in suspence, of writing\r\n     my sentiments to a man of the greatest influence at home, who\r\n     afterwards distinguished himself by espousing our cause in the\r\n     debates concerning the repeal of that act.'\r\n\r\n\"When we review a performance well written, and founded upon\r\nlaudable principles, if we do not restrain ourselves to a general\r\napprobation, which may be given in few words, the article will\r\nunavoidably contain more from the author of it, than from ourselves;\r\nthis, if any excuse is needful for enabling our Readers, in some\r\nmeasure, to judge for themselves, is pleaded as an apology for our\r\ncopious extracts from these excellent letters. To conclude; if\r\n_reason_ is to decide between us and our colonies, in the affairs\r\nhere controverted, our Author, whose name the advertisements inform\r\nus is Dickenson,[7] will not perhaps easily meet with a satisfactory\r\nrefutation.\"\r\n\r\n    [7] Of Pennsylvania.

I\r\nreceived a liberal education, and have been engaged in the busy\r\nscenes of life: But am now convinced, that a man may be as happy\r\nwithout bustle, as with it. My farm is small, my servants are few,\r\nand good; I have a little money at interest; I wish for no more: my\r\nemployment in my own affairs is easy; and with a contented grateful\r\nmind, I am compleating the number of days allotted to me by divine\r\ngoodness.\r\n\r\nBeing master of my time, I spend a good deal of it in a library,\r\nwhich I think the most valuable part of my small estate; and being\r\nacquainted with two or three gentlemen of abilities and learning,\r\nwho honour me with their friendship, I believe I have acquired a\r\ngreater share of knowledge in history, and the laws and constitution\r\nof my country, than is generally attained by men of my class, many\r\nof them not being so fortunate as I have been in the opportunities\r\nof getting information.\r\n\r\nFrom infancy I was taught to love humanity and liberty. Inquiry and\r\nexperience have since confirmed my reverence for the lessons then\r\ngiven me, by convincing me more fully of their truth and excellence.\r\nBenevolence towards mankind excites wishes for their welfare, and\r\nsuch wishes endear the means of fulfilling them. Those can be\r\nfound in liberty alone, and therefore her sacred cause ought to\r\nbe espoused by every man, on every occasion, to the utmost of his\r\npower: as a charitable but poor person does not withhold his _mite_,\r\nbecause he cannot relieve _all_ the distresses of the miserable,\r\nso let not any honest man suppress his sentiments concerning\r\nfreedom, however small their influence is likely to be. Perhaps he\r\nmay \"[8]touch some wheel\" that will have an effect greater than he\r\nexpects.\r\n\r\n    [8] POPE.\r\n\r\nThese being my sentiments, I am encouraged to offer to you, my\r\ncountrymen, my thoughts on some late transactions, that in my\r\nopinion are of the utmost importance to you. Conscious of my\r\ndefects, I have waited some time, in expectation of seeing the\r\nsubject treated by persons much better qualified for the task; but\r\nbeing therein disappointed, and apprehensive that longer delays will\r\nbe injurious, I venture at length to request the attention of the\r\npublic, praying only for one thing,--that is that these lines may be\r\n_read_ with the same zeal for the happiness of British America, with\r\nwhich they were _wrote_.\r\n\r\nWith a good deal of surprise I have observed, that little notice has\r\nbeen taken of an act of parliament, as injurious in its principle to\r\nthe liberties of these colonies, as the STAMP-ACT was: I mean the\r\nact for suspending the legislation of New-York.\r\n\r\nThe assembly of that government complied with a former act of\r\nparliament, requiring certain provisions to be made for the troops\r\nin America, in every particular, I think, except the articles of\r\nsalt, pepper, and vinegar. In my opinion they acted imprudently,\r\nconsidering all circumstances, in not complying so far, as would\r\nhave given satisfaction, as several colonies did: but my dislike of\r\ntheir conduct in that instance, has not blinded me so much, that I\r\ncannot plainly perceive, that they have been punished in a manner\r\npernicious to American freedom, and justly alarming to all the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nIf the BRITISH PARLIAMENT has a legal authority to order, that we\r\nshall furnish a single article for the troops here, and to compel\r\nobedience to that order; they have the same right to order us to\r\nsupply those troops with arms, cloaths, and every necessary, and to\r\ncompel obedience to that order also; in short, to lay _any burdens_\r\nthey please upon us. What is this but _taxing_ us at a _certain\r\nsum_, and leaving to us only the _manner_ of raising it? How is this\r\nmode more tolerable than the STAMP ACT? Would that act have appeared\r\nmore pleasing to AMERICANS, if being ordered thereby to raise the\r\nsum total of the taxes, the mighty privilege had been left to them,\r\nof saying how much should be paid for an instrument of writing on\r\npaper, and how much for another on parchment?\r\n\r\nAn act of parliament commanding us to do a certain thing, if it\r\nhas any validity, is a tax upon us for the expence that accrues in\r\ncomplying with it, and for this reason, I believe, every colony\r\non the continent, that chose to give a mark of their respect for\r\nGREAT-BRITAIN, in complying with the act relating to the troops,\r\ncautiously avoided the mention of that act, lest their conduct\r\nshould be attributed to its supposed obligation.\r\n\r\nThe matter being thus stated, the assembly of _New-York_ either\r\nhad, or had not a right to refuse submission to that act. If\r\nthey had, and I imagine no AMERICAN will say, they had not, then\r\nthe parliament had no _right_ to compel them to execute it.--If\r\nthey had not _that right_, they had _no right_ to punish them for\r\nnot executing it; and therefore had _no right_ to suspend their\r\nlegislation, which is a punishment. In fact, if the people of\r\n_New-York_ cannot be legally taxed but by their own representatives,\r\nthey cannot be legally deprived of the privileges of making laws,\r\nonly for insisting on that exclusive privilege of taxation. If\r\nthey may be legally deprived in such a case of the privilege of\r\nmaking laws, why may they not, with equal reason, be deprived of\r\nevery other privilege? Or why may not every colony be treated in\r\nthe same manner, when any of them shall dare to deny their assent\r\nto any impositions that shall be directed? Or what signifies the\r\nrepeal of the STAMP-ACT, if these colonies are to lose their _other_\r\nprivileges, by not tamely surrendering that of _taxation_?\r\n\r\nThere is one consideration arising from this suspicion, which is\r\nnot generally attended to, but shews its importance very clearly.\r\nIt was not _necessary_ that this suspension should be caused by an\r\nact of parliament. The crown might have restrained the governor\r\nof _New-York_, even from calling the assembly together, by its\r\nprerogative in the royal governments. This step, I suppose, would\r\nhave been taken, if the conduct of the assembly of _New-York_,\r\nhad been regarded as an act of disobedience _to the crown alone_:\r\nbut it is regarded as an act of \"disobedience to the authority of\r\nthe BRITISH LEGISLATURE.\" This gives the suspension a consequence\r\nvastly more affecting. It is a parliamentary assertion of the\r\n_supreme authority_ of the _British legislature_ over these colonies\r\nin _the part of taxation_; and is intended to COMPEL _New-York_\r\nunto a submission to that authority. It seems therefore to me as\r\nmuch a violation of the liberty of the people of that province,\r\nand consequently of all these colonies, as if the parliament had\r\nsent a number of regiments to be quartered upon them till they\r\nshould comply. For it is evident, that the suspension is meant as a\r\ncompulsion; and the _method_ of compelling is totally indifferent.\r\nIt is indeed probable, that the sight of red coats, and the beating\r\nof drums would have been most alarming, because people are generally\r\nmore influenced by their eyes and ears than by their reason: But\r\nwhoever seriously considers the matter, must perceive, that a\r\ndreadful stroke is aimed at the liberty of these colonies: For\r\nthe cause of _one_ is the cause of _all_. If the parliament may\r\nlawfully deprive _New-York_ of any of its rights, it may deprive\r\nany, or all the other colonies of their rights; and nothing can\r\npossibly so much encourage such attempts, as a mutual inattention\r\nto the interest of each other. _To divide, and thus to destroy_,\r\nis the first political maxim in attacking those who are powerful by\r\ntheir union. He certainly is not a wise man, who folds his arms and\r\nreposeth himself at home, seeing with unconcern the flames that have\r\ninvaded his neighbour's house, without any endeavours to extinguish\r\nthem. When Mr. _Hampden's_ ship-money cause, for three shillings and\r\nfour-pence, was tried, all the people of _England_, with anxious\r\nexpectation, interested themselves in the important decision; and\r\nwhen the slightest point touching the freedom of a single colony is\r\nagitated, I earnestly wish, that all the rest may with equal ardour\r\nsupport their sister. Very much may be said on this subject, but I\r\nhope, more at present is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWith concern I have observed that two assemblies of this province\r\nhave sat and adjourned, without taking any notice of this act. It\r\nmay perhaps be asked, what would have been proper for them to do? I\r\nam by no means fond of inflammatory measures. I detest them.----I\r\nshould be sorry that any thing should be done which might justly\r\ndisplease our sovereign or our mother-country. But a firm, modest\r\nexertion of a free spirit, should never be wanting on public\r\noccasions. It appears to me, that it would have been sufficient for\r\nthe assembly, to have ordered our agents to represent to the King's\r\nministers, their sense of the suspending act, and to pray for its\r\nrepeal. Thus we should have borne our testimony against it; and\r\nmight therefore reasonably expect that on a like occasion, we might\r\nreceive the same assistance from the other colonies.\r\n\r\n    \"_Concordia res parvæ crescunt._\"\r\n      Small things grow great by concord.--\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Countrymen_,\r\n\r\nThere is another late act of parliament, which seems to me to be as\r\ndestructive to the liberty of these colonies, as that inserted in\r\nmy last letter; that is, the act for granting the duties on paper,\r\nglass, &c. It appears to me to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThe parliament unquestionably possesses a legal authority to\r\n_regulate_ the trade of _Great-Britain_, and all its colonies.\r\nSuch an authority is essential to the relation between a mother\r\ncountry and its colonies; and necessary for the common good of\r\nall. He, who considers these provinces as states distinct from the\r\n_British Empire_, has very slender notions of _justice_ or of _their\r\ninterests_. We are but parts of _a whole_; and therefore there must\r\nexist a power somewhere, to preside, and preserve the connection in\r\ndue order. This power is lodged in the parliament; and we are as\r\nmuch dependant on _Great-Britain_, as a perfectly free people can be\r\non another.\r\n\r\nI have looked over every _statute_ relating to these colonies, from\r\ntheir first settlement to this time; and I find every one of them\r\nfounded on this principle, till the STAMP-ACT administration[9].\r\n_All before_ are calculated to preserve or promote a mutually\r\nbeneficial intercourse between the several constituent parts of the\r\nempire; and though many of them imposed duties on trade, yet those\r\nduties were always imposed _with design_ to restrain the commerce\r\nof one part, that was injurious to another, and thus to promote\r\nthe general welfare. The raising a revenue thereby was never\r\nintended. Thus, the king by his judges in his courts of justice,\r\nimposes fines, which all together amount to a considerable sum,\r\nand contribute to the support of government: but this is merely\r\na consequence arising from restrictions, which only meant to\r\nkeep peace, and prevent confusion; and surely a man would argue\r\nvery loosely, who should conclude from hence, that the King has a\r\nright to levy money in general upon his subjects; Never did the\r\n_British parliament_, till the period abovementioned, think of\r\nimposing duties in America FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING A REVENUE.\r\nMr. _Greenville's_ sagacity first introduced this language, in the\r\npreamble to the 4th of Geo. III. Ch. 15, which has these words--\"And\r\nwhereas it is just and necessary that a REVENUE BE RAISED IN YOUR\r\nMAJESTY'S SAID DOMINIONS IN AMERICA, _for defraying the expences\r\nof defending, protecting and securing the same_: We your Majesty's\r\nmost dutiful and loyal subjects, THE COMMONS OF GREAT BRITAIN, in\r\nparliament assembled, being desirous to make some provision in the\r\npresent session of parliament, towards raising the said revenue\r\nin America, have resolved to give and grant unto your Majesty the\r\nseveral rates and duties herein after mentioned,\" &c.\r\n\r\n    [9] For the satisfaction of the reader, recitals from former\r\n    acts of parliament relating to these colonies are added. By\r\n    comparing these with the modern acts, he will perceive their\r\n    great difference in expression and intention.\r\n\r\n    The 12th Cha.

Chap. 7, made expressly \"for the better\r\n    securing the plantation trade,\" which imposes duties on certain\r\n    commodities exported from one colony to another, mentions this\r\n    last for imposing them: \"Whereas by one act passed in the 12th\r\n    year of your Majesty's reign, intitled, an act for encouragement\r\n    of shipping and navigation, and by several other laws, passed\r\n    since that time, it is permitted to ship, &c. sugars, tobacco,\r\n    &c. of the growth, &c. of any of your Majesty's plantations in\r\n    America &c. from the places of their growth, &c. to any other of\r\n    your Majesty's plantations in those parts, &c. and that without\r\n    paying of custom for the same, either at the lading or unlading\r\n    the said commodities, by means whereof the trade and navigation\r\n    in those commodities from one plantation to another is greatly\r\n    encreased, and the inhabitants of divers of those colonies, not\r\n    contenting themselves with being supplied with those commodities\r\n    for their own use, free from all customs (while the subjects\r\n    of this your kingdom of England have paid great customs and\r\n    impositions for what of them hath been spent here) but, contrary\r\n    to the express letter of the aforesaid laws, have brought into\r\n    diverse parts of Europe great quantities thereof, and do also\r\n    vend great quantities thereof to the shipping of other nations,\r\n    who bring them into divers parts of Europe, to the great hurt\r\n    and diminution of your Majesty's customs, and of the trade and\r\n    navigation of this your kingdom; for the prevention thereof, &c.\"\r\n\r\n    The 7th and 8th Will. III. Chap. 21, intitled, \"An act for\r\n    preventing frauds, and regulating abuses in the plantation\r\n    trade,\" recites that, \"notwithstanding diverse acts, &c. great\r\n    abuses are daily committed, to the prejudice of the English\r\n    navigation, and the loss of a great part of the plantation trade\r\n    to this kingdom, by the artifice and cunning of ill disposed\r\n    persons: for remedy whereof, &c. And whereas in some of his\r\n    Majesty's American plantations, a doubt or misconstruction has\r\n    arisen upon the before mentioned acts, made in the 25th year\r\n    of the reign of Charles II. whereby certain duties are laid\r\n    upon the commodities therein enumerated (which by law may be\r\n    transported from one plantation to another, for the supplying of\r\n    each others wants) as if the same were, by the payment of those\r\n    duties in one plantation, discharged from giving the securities\r\n    intended by the aforesaid acts, made in the 12th, 22d and 23d\r\n    years of the reign of King Charles II. and consequently be at\r\n    liberty to go to any foreign market in Europe,\" &c.\r\n\r\n    The 6th Anne, Chap. 37, reciting the advancement of trade, &c.\r\n    and encouragement of ships of war, &c. grants to the captors the\r\n    property of all prizes carried into America, subject to such\r\n    customs and duties, &c. as if the same had been first imported\r\n    into any part of Great-Britain, and from thence exported, &c.\r\n\r\n    This was a gift to persons acting under commissions from the\r\n    crown, and therefore it was reasonable that the terms prescribed\r\n    should be complied with----more especially as the payment of\r\n    such duties was intended to give a preference to the productions\r\n    of the British colonies, over those of other colonies. However,\r\n    being found inconvenient to the colonies, about four years\r\n    afterwards, this act was, for that reason, so far repealed,\r\n    by another act \"all prize goods, imported into any part of\r\n    Great-Britain, from any of the plantations, were liable to such\r\n    duties only in Great-Britain, as in case they had been of the\r\n    growth and produce of the plantations,\" &c.\r\n\r\n    The 6th Geo. II. Chap. 13, which imposes duties on foreign rum,\r\n    sugar and molasses, imported into the colonies, shews the reason\r\n    thus.--\"Whereas the welfare and prosperity of your Majesty's\r\n    sugar colonies in America, are of the greatest consequence\r\n    and importance to the trade, navigation and strength of this\r\n    kingdom; and whereas the planters of the said sugar colonies,\r\n    have of late years fallen under such great discouragements that\r\n    they are unable to improve or carry on the sugar trade, upon\r\n    an equal footing with the foreign sugar colonies, without some\r\n    advantage and relief be given to them from Great-Britain: For\r\n    remedy whereof, and for the good and welfare of your Majesty's\r\n    subjects,\" &c.\r\n\r\n    The 29th Geo. II. Chap. 26. and the 1st Geo. III. Chap. 9, which\r\n    contains 6th Geo. II. Chap. 13, declare, that the said act hath,\r\n    by experience, been found useful and beneficial, &c. There are\r\n    all the most considerable statutes relating to the commerce of\r\n    the colonies; and it is thought to be utterly unnecessary to add\r\n    any observations to these extracts, to prove that they were all\r\n    intended solely as regulations of trade.\r\n\r\nA few months after came the _Stamp-act_, which reciting this,\r\nproceeds in the same strange mode of expression, thus--\"And whereas\r\nit is just and necessary, that provision be made FOR RAISING A\r\nFURTHER REVENUE WITHIN YOUR MAJESTY'S DOMINIONS IN AMERICA, towards\r\ndefraying the said expences, we your Majesty's most dutiful and\r\nloyal subjects, the COMMONS OF GREAT-BRITAIN, &c. GIVE and GRANT,\"\r\n&c. as before.\r\n\r\nThe last act, granting duties upon paper, &c. carefully pursues\r\nthese modern precedents. The preamble is, \"Whereas it is expedient\r\nthat a revenue should be raised in your Majesty's dominions in\r\nAmerica, for making a more certain and adequate provision for the\r\ndefraying the charge of the administration of justice, and the\r\nsupport of civil government in such provinces, where it shall be\r\nfound necessary; and towards the further defraying the expences\r\nof defending, protecting and securing the said dominions, we\r\nyour Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the COMMONS OF\r\nGREAT-BRITAIN, &c. give and grant,\" &c. as before.\r\n\r\nHere we may observe an authority _expressly_ claimed to impose\r\nduties on these colonies; not for the regulation of trade; not for\r\nthe preservation or promotion of a mutually beneficial intercourse\r\nbetween the several constituent parts of the empire, heretofore the\r\n_sole objects_ of parliamentary institutions; _but for the single\r\npurpose of levying money upon us_.\r\n\r\nThis I call an[10] innovation; and a most dangerous innovation.\r\nIt may perhaps be objected, that _Great-Britain_ has a right to\r\nlay what duties she pleases upon her[11] exports, and it makes no\r\ndifference to us, whether they are paid here or there.\r\n\r\n    [10] It is worthy observation how quickly subsidies, granted\r\n    in forms usual and accustomable (tho' heavy) are borne;\r\n    such a power hath use and custom. On the other side, what\r\n    discontentment and disturbances subsidies formed on new moulds\r\n    do raise (such an inbred hatred novelty doth hatch) is evident\r\n    by examples of former times. Lord Coke's 2d institute, p. 33.\r\n\r\n    [11] Some people, whose minds seem incapable of uniting two\r\n    ideas, think that Great-Britain has the same right to impose\r\n    duties on the exports to these colonies, as on those to Spain\r\n    and Portugal, &c. Such persons attend so much to the idea of\r\n    exportation, that they entirely drop that of the connection\r\n    between the mother country and her colonies. If Great-Britain\r\n    had always claimed, and exercised an authority to compel Spain\r\n    and Portugal to import manufactures from her only, the cases\r\n    would be parallel: But as she never pretended to such a right,\r\n    they are at liberty to get them where they please; and if they\r\n    chuse to take them from her, rather than from other nations,\r\n    they voluntary consent to pay the duties imposed on them.\r\n\r\nTo this I answer. These colonies require many things for their use,\r\nwhich the laws of _Great-Britain_ prohibit them from getting any\r\nwhere but from her. Such are paper and glass.\r\n\r\nThat we may be legally bound to pay any _general_ duties on these\r\ncommodities, relative to the regulation of trade, is granted; but\r\nwe being _obliged by her laws_ to take them from Great Britain, any\r\n_special_ duties imposed on their exportation _to us only, with\r\nintention to raise a revenue from us only_, are as much _taxes_ upon\r\nus, as those imposed by the _Stamp-act_.\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference in _substance_ and _right_, whether the same\r\nsum is raised upon us by the rates mentioned in the Stamp-act, on\r\nthe _use_ of the paper, or by these duties, on the _importation_ of\r\nit. It is nothing but the edition of a former book, with a new title\r\npage.\r\n\r\nSuppose the duties were made payable in _Great-Britain_?\r\n\r\nIt signifies nothing to us, whether they are to be paid here or\r\nthere. Had the _Stamp-act_ directed, that all the paper should\r\nbe landed in _Florida_, and the duties paid there, before it was\r\nbrought to the _British Colonies_, would the act have raised less\r\nmoney upon us, or have been less destructive of our rights? By no\r\nmeans: For as we were under a necessity of using the paper, we\r\nshould have been under the necessity of paying the duties. Thus, in\r\nthe present case, a like _necessity_ will subject us, if this act\r\ncontinues in force, to the payment of the duties now imposed.\r\n\r\nWhy was the _Stamp-act_ then so pernicious to freedom? It did\r\nnot enact, that every man in the colonies _should_ buy a certain\r\nquantity of paper--No: It only directed, that no instrument of\r\nwriting should be valid in law, if not made on stamp paper, &c.\r\n\r\nThe makers of that act knew full well, that the confusions that\r\nwould arise upon the disuse of writings would COMPEL the colonies\r\nto use the stamp paper, and therefore to pay the taxes imposed. For\r\nthis reason the _Stamp-act_ was said to be a law THAT WOULD EXECUTE\r\nITSELF. For the very same reason, the last act of parliament, if it\r\nis granted to have any force here, will execute itself, and will be\r\nattended with the very same consequences to _American Liberty_.\r\n\r\nSome persons perhaps may say, that this act lays us under no\r\nnecessity to pay the duties imposed, because we may ourselves\r\nmanufacture the articles on which they are laid: whereas by the\r\nStamp-act no instrument of writing could be good, unless made on\r\nBritish paper, and that too stampt.\r\n\r\nSuch an objection amounts to no more than this, that the injury\r\nresulting to these colonies, from the total disuse of British\r\npaper and glass, will not be _so afflicting_ as that which would\r\nhave resulted from the total disuse of writing among them; for by\r\nthat means even the stamp-act might have been eluded. Why then\r\nwas it universally detested by them as slavery itself? Because\r\nit presented to these devoted provinces nothing but a choice of\r\ncalamities, imbittered by indignities, each of which it was unworthy\r\nof freemen to bear. But is no injury a violation of right but the\r\n_greatest_ injury? If the eluding the payment of the duties imposed\r\nby the stamp-act, would have subjected us to a more dreadful\r\ninconvenience, than the eluding the payment of those imposed by the\r\nlate act; does it therefore follow, that the last is no violation of\r\nour rights, though it is calculated for the same purpose that the\r\nother was, that is, _to raise money upon us_, WITHOUT OUR CONSENT?\r\n\r\nThis would be making _right_ to consist, not in an exemption from\r\n_injury_, but from a certain _degree of injury_.\r\n\r\nBut the objectors may further say, that we shall sustain no injury\r\nat all by the disuse of British paper and glass. We might not, if\r\nwe could make as much as we want. But can any man, acquainted with\r\nAmerica, believe this possible? I am told there are but two or three\r\n_glass-houses_ on this continent, and but very few _paper-mills_;\r\nand suppose more should be erected, a long course of years must\r\nelapse, before they can be brought to perfection. This continent is\r\na country of planters, farmers, and fishermen; not of manufacturers.\r\nThe difficulty of establishing particular manufactures in such a\r\ncountry, is almost insuperable, for one manufacture is connected\r\nwith others in such a manner, that it may be said to be impossible\r\nto establish one or two, without establishing several others. The\r\nexperience of many nations may convince us of this truth.\r\n\r\nInexpressible therefore must be our distresses in evading the late\r\nacts, by the disuse of British paper and glass. Nor will this be the\r\nextent of our misfortunes, if we admit the legality of that act.\r\n\r\n_Great-Britain_ has prohibited the manufacturing iron and steel\r\nin these colonies, without any objection being made to her right\r\nof doing it. The like right she must have to prohibit any other\r\nmanufacture among us. Thus she is possessed of an undisputed\r\n_precedent_ on that point. This authority, she will say, is founded\r\non the _original intention_ of settling these colonies; that is,\r\nthat she should manufacture for them, and that they should supply\r\nher with materials. The _equity_ of this policy, she will also say,\r\nhas been universally acknowledged by the colonies, who never have\r\nmade the least objection to statutes for that purpose; and will\r\nfurther appear by the _mutual benefits_ flowing from this usage,\r\never since the settlement of these colonies.\r\n\r\nOur great advocate, Mr. PITT, in his speeches on the debate\r\nconcerning the repeal of the _Stamp-act_, acknowledged, that\r\nGreat-Britain could restrain our manufactures. His words are\r\nthese--\"This kingdom, as the supreme governing and legislative\r\npower, has _always_ bound the colonies by her regulations and\r\n_restrictions_ in trade, in navigation, in _manufactures_----in\r\nevery thing, _except that of taking their money out of their\r\npockets_, WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.\" Again he says, \"We may bind\r\ntheir trade, CONFINE THEIR MANUFACTURES, and exercise every power\r\nwhatever, except that of taking money out of their pockets, WITHOUT\r\nTHEIR CONSENT.\"\r\n\r\nHere then, let my countrymen, ROUSE yourselves, and behold the ruin\r\nhanging over their heads. If they ONCE admit, that Great-Britain\r\nmay lay duties upon her exportations to us, _for the purpose of\r\nlevying money on us only_, she then will have nothing to do, but\r\nto lay those duties on the articles which she prohibits us to\r\nmanufacture--and the tragedy of American liberty is finished. We\r\nhave been prohibited from procuring manufactures, in all cases,\r\nany where but from Great-Britain, (excepting linens, which we are\r\npermitted to import directly from Ireland). We have been prohibited,\r\nin some cases, from manufacturing for ourselves; We are therefore\r\nexactly in the situation of a city besieged, which is surrounded by\r\nthe works of the besiegers in every part _but one_. If _that_ is\r\nclosed up, no step can be taken, _but to surrender at discretion_.\r\nIf Great-Britain can order us to come to her for necessaries we\r\nwant, and can order us to pay what taxes she pleases before we take\r\nthem away, or when we have them here, we are as abject slaves,\r\nas France and Poland can shew in wooden shoes, and with uncombed\r\nhair.[12]\r\n\r\n    [12] The peasants of France wear wooden shoes; and the vassals\r\n    of Poland are remarkable for matted hair, which never can be\r\n    combed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the nature of the necessities of the dependant states,\r\ncaused by the policy of a governing one, for her own benefit, may be\r\nelucidated by a fact mentioned in history. When the Carthaginians\r\nwere possessed of the island of Sardinia, they made a decree, that\r\nthe Sardinians should not get corn, any other way than from the\r\nCarthaginians. Then, by imposing any duties they would, they drained\r\nfrom the miserable Sardinians any sums they pleased; and whenever\r\nthat oppressed people made the least movement to assert their\r\nliberty, their tyrants starved them to death or submission. This may\r\nbe called the most perfect kind of political necessity.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, I think this uncontrovertible conclusion\r\nmay be deduced, that when a ruling state obliges a dependant state\r\nto take certain commodities from her alone, it is implied in the\r\nnature of that obligation; and is essentially requisite to give it\r\nthe least degree of justice; and is inseparably united with it, in\r\norder to preserve any share of freedom to the dependant state; that\r\nthose commodities should never be loaded with duties for the sole\r\npurpose of levying money on the dependant state.\r\n\r\nThe place of paying the duties imposed by the late act, appears\r\nto me therefore to be totally immaterial. The single question is,\r\nwhether the parliament can legally impose duties to be paid _by\r\nthe people of these colonies only_ FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF RAISING\r\nA REVENUE, _on commodities which she obliges us to take from her\r\nalone_; or, in other words, whether the parliament can legally take\r\nmoney out of our pockets, without our consent. If they can, our\r\nboasted liberty is but\r\n\r\n    _Vox et præterea nihil._\r\n     A sound, and nothing else.\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Countrymen_,\r\n\r\nI rejoice to find, that my two former letters to you, have been\r\ngenerally received with so much favour by such of you whose\r\nsentiments I have had an opportunity of knowing. Could you look into\r\nmy heart, you would instantly perceive an ardent affection for your\r\npersons, a zealous attachment to your interests, a lively resentment\r\nof every insult and injury offered to your honour or happiness, and\r\nan inflexible resolution to assert your rights, to the utmost of my\r\nweak power, to be the only motives that have engaged me to address\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nI am no further concerned in any thing affecting America, than any\r\none of you, and when liberty leaves it I can quit it much more\r\nconveniently than most of you: but while divine providence, that\r\ngave me existence in a land of freedom, permits my head to think, my\r\nlips to speak, and my hand to move, I shall so highly and gratefully\r\nvalue the blessing received, as to take care that my silence and\r\ninactivity shall not give my implied assent to any act degrading my\r\nbrethren and myself from the birthright wherewith heaven itself\r\n\"_hath made us free_.[13]\"\r\n\r\n    [13] Gal. v. 1.\r\n\r\nSorry I am to learn, that there are some few persons, shake their\r\nheads with solemn motion, and pretend to wonder what can be the\r\nmeaning of these letters. \"Great-Britain, they say, is too powerful\r\nto contend with; she is determined to oppress us; it is in vain\r\nto speak of right on one side, when there is power on the other;\r\nwhen we are strong enough to resist, we shall attempt it; but now\r\nwe are not strong enough, and therefore we had better be quiet; it\r\nsignifies nothing to convince us that our rights are invaded, when\r\nwe cannot defend them, and if we should get into riots and tumults\r\nabout the late act, it will only draw down heavier displeasure upon\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nWhat can such men design? What do their grave observations amount\r\nto, but this--\"that these colonies, totally regardless of their\r\nliberties, should commit them, with humble resignation, to _chance_,\r\n_time_, and the tender mercies of _ministers_.\"\r\n\r\nAre these men ignorant, that usurpations, which might have been\r\nsuccessfully opposed at first, acquire strength by continuance,\r\nand thus become irresistible? Do they condemn the conduct of these\r\ncolonies, concerning the _Stamp-act_? Or have they forgot its\r\nsuccessful issue? Ought the colonies at that time, instead of\r\nacting as they did, to have trusted for relief, to the fortuitous\r\nevents of futurity? If it is needless \"to speak of rights\" now, it\r\nwas as needless then. If the behaviour of the colonies was prudent\r\nand glorious then, and successful too; it will be equally prudent\r\nand glorious to act in the same manner now, if our rights are\r\nequally invaded, and may be as successful. Therefore it becomes\r\nnecessary to enquire, whether \"our rights _are_ invaded.\" To talk of\r\n\"defending\" them, as if they could be no otherwise \"defended\" than\r\nby arms, is as much out of the way, as if a man having a choice of\r\nseveral roads to reach his journey's end, should prefer the worst,\r\nfor no other reason, than because it is the worst.\r\n\r\nAs to \"riots and tumults,\" the gentlemen who are so apprehensive of\r\nthem, are much mistaken, if they think, that grievances cannot be\r\nredressed without such assistance.\r\n\r\nI will now tell the gentlemen, what is \"the meaning of these\r\nletters.\" The meaning of them is, to convince the people of\r\nthese colonies, that they are at this moment exposed to the most\r\nimminent dangers; and to persuade them immediately, vigourously,\r\nand unanimously, to exert themselves, in the most firm, but most\r\npeaceable manner for obtaining relief.\r\n\r\nThe cause of liberty is a cause of too much dignity, to be sullied\r\nby turbulence and tumult. It ought to be maintained in a manner\r\nsuitable to her nature. Those who engage in it, should breathe a\r\nsedate, yet fervent spirit, animating them to actions of prudence,\r\njustice, modesty, bravery, humanity, and magnanimity.\r\n\r\nTo such a wonderful degree were the antient _Spartans_, as brave and\r\nas free a people as ever existed, inspired by this happy temperature\r\nof soul, that rejecting even in their battles the use of trumpets,\r\nand other instruments for exciting heat and rage, they marched up\r\nto scenes of havock and horror, with the sound of flutes, to the\r\ntunes of which their steps kept pace--\"exhibiting, as _Plutarch_\r\nsays, at once a terrible and delightful sight, and proceeding with\r\na deliberate valour, full of hope and good assurance, as if some\r\ndivinity had insensibly assisted them.\"\r\n\r\nI hope, my dear countrymen, that you will in every colony be upon\r\nyour guard against those who may at any time endeavour to stir you\r\nup, under pretences of patriotism, to any measures disrespectful\r\nto our sovereign and our mother country. Hot, rash, disorderly\r\nproceedings, injure the reputation of a people as to wisdom, valour\r\nand virtue, without procuring them the least benefit. I pray God,\r\nthat he may be pleased to inspire you and your posterity to the\r\nlatest ages with that spirit, of which I have an idea, but find a\r\ndifficulty to express: to express in the best manner I can, I mean\r\na spirit that shall so guide you, that it will be impossible to\r\ndetermine, whether an _American_'s character is most distinguishable\r\nfor his loyalty to his sovereign, his duty to his mother country,\r\nhis love of freedom, or his affection for his native soil.\r\n\r\nEvery government, at some time or other, falls into wrong measures;\r\nthese may proceed from mistake or passion.----But every such measure\r\ndoes not dissolve the obligation between the governors and the\r\ngoverned; the mistake may be corrected; the passion may pass over.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the governed, to endeavour to rectify the mistake,\r\nand appease the passion. They have not at first any other right,\r\nthan to represent their grievances, and to pray for redress, unless\r\nan emergency is so pressing, as not to allow time for receiving\r\nan answer to their applications which rarely happens. If their\r\napplications are disregarded, then that kind of opposition becomes\r\njustifiable, which can be made without breaking the laws, or\r\ndisturbing the public peace. This consists in the prevention of the\r\noppressors reaping advantage from their oppressions, and not in\r\ntheir punishment. For experience may teach them what reason did not;\r\nand harsh methods, cannot be proper, till milder ones have failed.\r\n\r\nIf at length it becomes undoubted, that an inveterate resolution is\r\nformed to annihilate the liberties of the governed, the English\r\nhistory affords frequent examples of resistance by force. What\r\nparticular circumstances will in any future case justify such\r\nresistance, can never be ascertained till they happen. Perhaps\r\nit may be allowable to say, generally, that it never can be\r\njustifiable, until the people are FULLY CONVINCED, that any further\r\nsubmission will be destructive to their happiness.\r\n\r\nWhen the appeal is made to the sword, highly probable it is, that\r\nthe punishment will exceed the offence; and the calamities attending\r\non war out weigh those preceding it. These considerations of justice\r\nand prudence, will always have great influence with good and wise\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nTo these reflections on this subject, it remains to be added,\r\nand ought for ever to be remembred; that resistance in the case\r\nof colonies against their mother country, is extremely different\r\nfrom the resistance of a people against their prince. A nation may\r\nchange their King or race of Kings, and retain their antient form\r\nof government, be gainers by changing. Thus Great-Britain, under\r\nthe illustrious house of Brunswick, a house that seems to flourish\r\nfor the happiness of mankind, has found a felicity, unknown in the\r\nreigns of the Stuarts. But if once we are separated from our mother\r\ncountry, what new form of government shall we accept, or when shall\r\nwe find another Britain to supply our loss? Torn from the body\r\nto which we are united by religion, liberty, laws, affections,\r\nrelations, language, and commerce, we must bleed at every vein.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the prosperity of these provinces is founded in their\r\ndependance on Great-Britain; and when she returns to \"her old good\r\nhumour, and old good nature,\" as Lord Clerendon expresses it, I\r\nhope they will always esteem it their duty and interest, as it most\r\ncertainly will be, to promote her welfare by all the means in their\r\npower.\r\n\r\nWe cannot act with too much caution in our disputes. Anger produces\r\nanger; and differences that might be accommodated by kind and\r\nrespectful behaviour, may by imprudence be changed to an incurable\r\nrage.\r\n\r\nIn quarrels between countries, as well as in those between\r\nindividuals, when they have risen to a certain heighth, the first\r\ncause of dissention is no longer remembred, the minds of the parties\r\nbeing wholly engaged in recollecting and resenting the mutual\r\nexpressions of their dislike. When feuds have reached that fatal\r\npoint, all considerations of reason and equity vanish; and a blind\r\nfury governs, or rather confounds all things. A people no longer\r\nregards their interest, but the gratification of their wrath. The\r\nsway of the Cleon's,[14] and Clodius's, the designing and detestable\r\nflatters of the prevailing passion, becomes confirmed.\r\n\r\n    [14] Cleon was a popular firebrand of Athens and Clodius\r\n    of Rome; each of them plunged his country into the deepest\r\n    calamities.\r\n\r\nWise and good men in vain oppose the storm, and may think themselves\r\nfortunate, if, endeavouring to preserve their ungrateful fellow\r\ncitizens, they do not ruin themselves. Their prudence will be called\r\nbaseness; their moderation, guilt; and if their virtue does not\r\nlead them to destruction, as that of many other great and excellent\r\npersons has done, they may survive, to receive from their expiring\r\ncountry, the mournful glory of her acknowledgment, that their\r\ncouncils, if regarded, would have saved her.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional modes of obtaining relief, are those which I\r\nwould wish to see pursued on the present occasion, that is, by\r\npetitioning of our assemblies, or, where they are not permitted to\r\nmeet, of the people to the powers that can afford us relief.\r\n\r\nWe have an excellent prince, in whose good dispositions towards us\r\nwe may confide. We have a generous, sensible, and humane nation, to\r\nwhom we may apply. They may be deceived: they may, by artful men,\r\nbe provoked to anger against us; but I cannot yet believe they will\r\nbe cruel or unjust; or that their anger will be implacable. Let us\r\nbehave like dutiful children, who have received unmerited blows\r\nfrom a beloved parent. Let us complain to our parents; but let our\r\ncomplaints speak at the same time, the language of affliction and\r\nveneration.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it shall happen by an unfortunate course of affairs,\r\nthat our applications to his Majesty and the parliament for the\r\nredress, prove ineffectual, let us then take another step, by\r\nwithholding from Great-Britain, all the advantages she has been used\r\nto receive from us. Then let us try, if our ingenuity, industry,\r\nand frugality, will not give weight to our remonstrances. Let us\r\nall be united with one spirit in one cause. Let us invent; let us\r\nwork; let us save; let us at the same time, keep up our claims, and\r\nunceasingly repeat our complaints; but above all, let us implore the\r\nprotection of that infinite good and gracious Being, \"by whom kings\r\nreign and princes decree justice.\"\r\n\r\n    \"_Nil desperandum._\"\r\n      Nothing is to be despaired of.\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Countrymen_,\r\n\r\nAn objection, I hear, has been made against what I offer in my\r\nsecond letter, which I would willingly clear up before I proceed.\r\n\"There is,\" say these objectors \"a material difference between the\r\nStamp-act and the late act for laying a duty on paper, &c. that\r\njustifies the conduct of those who opposed the former, and yet\r\nare willing to submit to the latter. The duties imposed by the\r\nStamp-act, were internal taxes, but the present are external, which\r\ntherefore the parliament may have a right to impose.\"----To this I\r\nanswer, with a total denial of the power of parliament to lay upon\r\nthese colonies any tax whatever.\r\n\r\nThis point being so important to this and to all succeeding\r\ngenerations, I wish to be clearly understood.\r\n\r\nTo the word \"Tax,\" I annex that meaning which the constitution and\r\nhistory of England require to be annexed to it; that it is, an\r\nimposition on the subject for the sole purpose of levying money.\r\n\r\nIn the early ages of our monarchy, the services rendered to the\r\ncrown, for the general good, were personal;[15] but in progress of\r\ntime, such institutions being found inconvenient, certain gifts\r\nand grants of their own property were made by the people, under\r\nthe several names of aids, tallages, talks, taxes, subsidies, &c.\r\nThese were made as may be collected even from the names for public\r\nservice, \"upon need and necessity,\"[16] all these sums were levied\r\nupon the people by virtue of their voluntary gift.[17] The design of\r\nthem was to support the national honour and interest. Some of those\r\ngrants comprehended duties arising from trade, being imports on\r\nmerchandizes. These Chief Justice Coke classes \"under subsides\"[18]\r\nand \"parliamentary aids.\" They are also called \"customs.\" But\r\nwhatever the name was, they were always considered as gifts of the\r\npeople to the crown, to be employed for public uses.\r\n\r\n    [15] It is very worthy of remark, how watchful our wise\r\n    ancestors were, least these services should be extended beyond\r\n    the limits of the law. No man was bound to go out of the realm\r\n    to serve, and therefore even in the conquering reign of Henry V.\r\n    when the martial spirit of the nation was inflamed by success\r\n    to a great degree, they still carefully guarded against the\r\n    establishment of illegal services. Lord Chief Justice Coke's\r\n    words are these, \"When this point concerning maintainance of\r\n    wars out of England came in question, the Commons did make their\r\n    continual claim of their antient freedom and birth-right, as\r\n    in the first of Henry V. and 7th of Henry V. &c. the Commons\r\n    made protest that they were not bound to the maintainance of\r\n    war in Scotland, Ireland, Calais, France, Normandy, or other\r\n    foreign parts, and caused their protests to be entered into\r\n    the parliament roll, where they yet remain; which, in effect,\r\n    agreeth with that, which upon the like occasion was made in the\r\n    parliament of 25. E. 1.\" 2d Inst. p. 528.\r\n\r\n    [16] 4. Inst. p. 28.\r\n\r\n    [17] _Rege Angliæ nihiltale, nisi convocatis primis ordinibus et\r\n    assentiente populo, suscipiunt. Phil. Comines._\r\n\r\n    These gifts entirely depending on the pleasure of the donors,\r\n    were proportioned to the abilities of the several ranks of\r\n    people, who gave, and were regulated by their opinion of the\r\n    public necessities. Thus Edward I. had in his 11th year a\r\n    thirteenth from the laity, a twentieth from the clergy; in his\r\n    22d year, a tenth from the laity, a sixth from London, and other\r\n    corporate towns, half of their benefices from the clergy; in his\r\n    23d year, an eleventh from the barons and others, a tenth from\r\n    the clergy, and a seventh from the burgesses, &c.\r\n\r\n    Hume's History of England.\r\n\r\n    The same difference in the grants of the several ranks, is\r\n    observable in other reigns. In the famous statute _de tallagio\r\n    non concedendo_, the King enumerates the several classes,\r\n    without whose consent he and his heirs should never set or levy\r\n    any tax. \"_Nullum tallagium vel auxilium, per nos, vel hæredes\r\n    nostros, in regno nostro ponatur seu levetur, sine voluntare\r\n    et assensu archiepiscoporum, episcoporum, comitum, baronum,\r\n    militum, burgensium, et aliorum liberorum de regno nostro._\" 34\r\n    E. I.\r\n\r\n    Lord Chief Justice Coke in his comment on these words, says,\r\n    \"for the quieting of the Commons, and for a perpetual and\r\n    constant law for ever after, both in this and other like cases,\r\n    this act was made.\" \"These words are plain without scruple;\r\n    absolute without any saving.\"\r\n\r\n    2 Coke's Inst. p. 522, 523.\r\n\r\n    Little did the venerable judge imagine, that \"other like cases\"\r\n    would happen, in which the spirit of this law would be despised\r\n    by Englishmen, the posterity of those who made it.\r\n\r\n    [18] 4. Inst. p. 28.\r\n\r\n    Commerce was at a low ebb, and most surprising instances may be\r\n    produced, how little it was attended to, for a succession of\r\n    ages. The terms that have been mentioned, and among the rest\r\n    that of \"tax,\" had obtained a national, parliamentary meaning,\r\n    drawn from the principles of the constitution, long before any\r\n    Englishmen thought of regulations of trade \"by imposing duties.\"\r\n\r\n    Whenever we speak of taxes among Englishmen, let us therefore\r\n    speak of them with reference to the intentions with which, and\r\n    the principles on which they have been established. This will\r\n    give certainty to our expression, and safety to our conduct: but\r\n    if when we have in view the liberty of these colonies, and the\r\n    influence of \"taxes\" laid without our consent, we proceed in any\r\n    other course, we pursue a Juno[19] indeed, but shall only catch\r\n    a cloud.\r\n\r\n    [19] The goddess of empire, in the heathen mythology. According\r\n    to an ancient fable, Ixion pursued her, but she escaped by a\r\n    cloud which she threw in his way.\r\n\r\n    In the national parliamentary sense insisted on, the word\r\n    \"tax\"[20] was certainly understood by the congress at New-York,\r\n    whose resolves may be said to form the American \"bill of\r\n    rights.\" I am satisfied that the congress was of opinion, that\r\n    no impositions could be legally laid on the people of these\r\n    colonies for the purpose of levying money, but by themselves or\r\n    their representatives.\r\n\r\n    [20] In this sense Montesquieu uses the word \"tax\", in his 13th\r\n    book of Spirit of Laws.\r\n\r\nThe third, fourth, fifth, and sixth resolves are thus expressed.\r\n\r\nIII. \"That it is inseparably essential to the freedom of a people\r\nand the undoubted right of Englishmen, that no tax be imposed on\r\nthem, but with their own consent, given personally or by their\r\nrepresentatives.\"\r\n\r\nIV. \"That the people of the colonies are not, and from their local\r\ncircumstances cannot be represented in the House of Commons, in\r\nGreat-Britain.\"\r\n\r\nV. \"That the only representatives of the people of the colonies, are\r\nthe persons chosen therein by themselves; and that no taxes ever\r\nhave been, or can be constitutionally imposed on them, but by their\r\nrespective legislatures.\"\r\n\r\nVI. \"That all supplies to the crown being free gifts of the people,\r\nit is unreasonable and inconsistent with the principles and spirit\r\nof the British constitution, for the people of Great-Britain to\r\ngrant to his Majesty the property of the colonies.\"\r\n\r\nHere is no distinction made, between internal and external taxes.\r\nIt is evident from the short reasoning thrown into these resolves\r\nthat every imposition \"to grant to his Majesty the property of the\r\ncolonies,\" was thought a \"tax;\" and that every such imposition if\r\nlaid any other way \"but with their consent, given personally, or by\r\ntheir representatives;\" was not only \"unreasonable, and inconsistent\r\nwith the principles and spirit of the British constitution,\" but\r\ndestructive \"to the freedom of a people.\"\r\n\r\nThis language is clear and important. A \"tax\" means an imposition\r\nto raise money. Such persons therefore as speak of internal and\r\nexternal \"taxes,\" I pray may pardon me, if I object to that\r\nexpression as applied to the privileges and interests of these\r\ncolonies. There may be external and internal impositions, founded\r\non different principles, and having different tendencies; every\r\n\"tax\" being an imposition, tho' every imposition is not a \"tax.\" But\r\nall \"taxes\" are founded on the same principle, and have the same\r\ntendency.\r\n\r\n\"External impositions for the regulation of our trade, do not grant\r\nto his Majesty the property of the colonies.\" They only prevent the\r\ncolonies acquiring property in things not necessary, and in a manner\r\njudged to be injurious to the welfare of the whole empire. But the\r\nlast statute respecting us, \"grants to his Majesty the property of\r\nthese colonies,\" by laying duties on manufactures of Great-Britain,\r\nwhich they must take, and which he settled them, in order that they\r\nshould take.\r\n\r\nWhat[21] \"tax\" can be more \"internal\" than this? Here is money drawn\r\nwithout their consent from a society, who have constantly enjoyed\r\na constitutional mode of raising all money among themselves. The\r\npayment of this tax they have no possible method of avoiding, as\r\nthey cannot do without the commodities on which it is laid, and\r\nthey cannot manufacture these commodities themselves; besides, if\r\nthis unhappy country should be so lucky as to elude this act, by\r\ngetting parchment enough to use in the place of paper, or reviving\r\nthe antient method of writing on wax and bark, and by inventing\r\nsomething to serve instead of glass, her ingenuity would stand\r\nher in little stead; for then the parliament would have nothing\r\nto do, but to prohibit manufactures, or to lay a tax on hats and\r\nwoollen cloths, which they have already prohibited the colonies\r\nfrom supplying each other with; or on instruments and tools of\r\nsteel and iron, which they have prohibited the provincials from\r\nmanufacturing at all[22] And then what little gold and silver they\r\nhave, must be torn from their hands, or they will not be able in a\r\nshort time, to get an ax[23] for cutting their firewood, nor a plough\r\nfor raising their food.--In what respect therefore, I beg leave to\r\nask, is the late act preferable to the Stamp-act, or more consistent\r\nwith the liberties of the colonies? \"I regard them both with equal\r\napprehension, and think they ought to be in the same manner opposed.\"\r\n\r\n  \"_Habemus quidem senatus consultum--tanquam\r\n        gladium in vagina repositum_\"\r\n  We have a statute like a sword in the scabbard.\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n    [21] It seems to be evident, that Mr. Pitt, in his defence\r\n    of America, during the debate concerning the repeal of the\r\n    Stamp-act, by \"_internal taxes_\" meant any duties \"_for the\r\n    purpose of raising a revenue_;\" and by \"_external taxes_,\" meant\r\n    \"_duties imposed for the regulation of trade_.\" His expressions\r\n    are these.--\"If the gentleman does not understand the difference\r\n    between internal and external taxes, I cannot help it; but there\r\n    is a plain distinction between taxes levied for the purposes\r\n    of raising a revenue, and duties imposed for the regulation\r\n    of trade, for the accommodation of the subject; altho' in the\r\n    consequences, some revenue might incidentally arise from the\r\n    latter.\"\r\n\r\n    These words were in Mr. Pitt's reply to Mr. Grenville, who\r\n    said he could not understand the difference between external\r\n    and internal taxes. But Mr. Pitt in his first speech, had\r\n    made no such distinction; and his meaning, when he mentions\r\n    the distinction, appears to be--that by \"_external taxes_,\"\r\n    he intended impositions, for the purpose of regulating the\r\n    intercourse of the colonies with others; and by \"_internal\r\n    taxes_,\" he intended impositions, for the purpose of taking\r\n    money from them.\r\n\r\n    In every other part of his speeches on that occasion, his words\r\n    confirm this construction of his expressions. The following\r\n    extracts will shew how positive and general were his assertions\r\n    of our right.\r\n\r\n    \"IT IS MY OPINION THAT THIS KINGDOM HAS NO RIGHT TO LAY A TAX\r\n    UPON THE COLONIES.\" \"THE AMERICANS ARE THE SONS NOT THE BASTARDS\r\n    OF ENGLAND. TAXATION IS NO PART OF THE GOVERNING OR LEGISLATIVE\r\n    POWER.\" \"The taxes are a voluntary gift and grant of the Commons\r\n    alone. In legislation the three estates of the realm are alike\r\n    concerned, but the concurrence of the peers and the crown to a\r\n    tax, is only necessary to close with the form of a law. The gift\r\n    and grant is of the Commons alone.\" \"The distinction between\r\n    legislation and taxation is essentially necessary to liberty.\"\r\n    \"_The Commons of America represented in their several assemblies\r\n    have ever been in possession of the exercise of this, their\r\n    constitutional right, of giving and granting their own money.\r\n    They would have been slaves, if they had not enjoyed it._\" \"The\r\n    idea of a virtual representation of America in this house, is\r\n    the most contemptible idea that ever entered into the head of\r\n    man. It does not deserve a serious refutation.\"\r\n\r\n    He afterwards shews the unreasonableness of Great-Britain taxing\r\n    America, thus--\"When I had the honour of serving his Majesty, I\r\n    availed myself of the means of information, which I derived from\r\n    my office: I speak therefore from knowledge. My materials were\r\n    good, I was at pains to collect, to digest, to consider them:\r\n    _and I will be bold to affirm that the profit to Great-Britain\r\n    from the trade of the colonies, thro' all its branches, is two\r\n    millions a year. This is the fund that carried you triumphantly\r\n    thro' the last war._ The estates that were rented at two\r\n    thousand pounds a year, threescore years ago, are at three\r\n    thousand pounds at present. Those estates sold then from fifteen\r\n    to eighteen years purchase; the same may now be sold for thirty.\r\n    YOU OWE THIS TO AMERICA. THIS IS THE PRICE THAT AMERICA PAYS\r\n    YOU FOR HER PROTECTION,\"--\"I dare not say how much higher these\r\n    profits may be augmented.\"--\"Upon the whole, I will beg leave\r\n    to tell the house what is really my opinion: it is, THAT THE\r\n    STAMP-ACT BE REPEALED ABSOLUTELY, TOTALLY, AND IMMEDIATELY. That\r\n    the reason for the repeal be assigned, because it was founded on\r\n    an erroneous principle.\"\r\n\r\n    [22] \"And that pig and bar iron made in his Majesty's colonies\r\n    in America may be further manufactured in this kingdom, be it\r\n    further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that from and after\r\n    the twenty-fourth day of June, 1750, no mill or other engine\r\n    for slitting or rolling of iron, or any plaiting forge to work\r\n    with a tilt hammer, or any furnace for making steel, shall\r\n    be erected, or after such erection continued, in any of his\r\n    Majesty's colonies in America.\"\r\n\r\n    3 Geo. II. chap. 29. sect. 9.\r\n\r\n    [23] Though these particulars are mentioned as being so\r\n    absolutely necessary, yet perhaps they are not more so than\r\n    glass, in our severe winters, to keep out the cold, from\r\n    our houses; or than paper, without which such inexpressible\r\n    confusion must ensue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Countrymen_,\r\n\r\nPerhaps the objection to the late act, imposing duties upon paper,\r\n&c. might have been safely rested on the arguments drawn from the\r\nuniversal conduct of parliaments and ministers, from the first\r\nexistence of these colonies, to the administration of Mr. Grenville.\r\n\r\nWhat but the indisputable, the acknowledged exclusive right of the\r\ncolonies to tax themselves, could be the reason, that in this long\r\nperiod of more than one hundred and fifty years, no statute was ever\r\npassed for the sole purpose of raising a revenue on the colonies?\r\nAnd how clear, how cogent must that reason be, to which every\r\nparliament and every minister, for so long a time submitted, without\r\na single attempt to innovate?\r\n\r\nEngland in part of that course of years, and Great Britain, in other\r\nparts, was engaged in fierce and expensive wars; troubled with some\r\ntumultuous and bold parliaments; governed by many daring and wicked\r\nministers; yet none of them ever ventured to touch the PALLADIUM OF\r\nAMERICAN LIBERTY. Ambition, avarice, faction, tyranny, all revered\r\nit. Whenever it was necessary to raise money on the colonies, the\r\nrequisitions of the crown were made, and dutifully complied with.\r\nThe parliament from time to time regulated their trade, and that\r\nof the rest of the empire, to preserve their dependencies, and the\r\nconnection of the whole in good order.\r\n\r\nThe people of Great-Britain in support of their privileges, boast\r\nmuch of their antiquity. Yet it may well be questioned, if there is\r\na single privilege of a British subject, supported by longer, more\r\nsolemn, or more uninterrupted testimony, than the exclusive right\r\nof taxation in these colonies. The people of Great-Britain consider\r\nthat kingdom as the sovereign of these colonies, and would now annex\r\nto that sovereignty a prerogative never heard of before. How would\r\nthey bear this, was the case their own? What would they think of\r\na new prerogative claimed by the crown? We may guess what their\r\nconduct would be from the transports of passion into which they fell\r\nabout the late embargo, laid to remove the most emergent necessities\r\nof state, admitting of no delay; and for which there were numerous\r\nprecedents. Let our liberties be treated with the same tenderness,\r\nand it is all we desire.\r\n\r\nExplicit as the conduct of parliaments, for so many ages, is, to\r\nprove that no money can be levied on these colonies, by parliament\r\nfor the purpose of raising a revenue; yet it is not the only\r\nevidence in our favour.\r\n\r\nEvery one of the most material arguments against the legality of the\r\nStamp-act operates with equal force against the act now objected to;\r\nbut as they are well known, it seems unnecessary to repeat them here.\r\n\r\nThis general one only shall be considered at present. That tho'\r\nthese colonies are dependant on Great-Britain; and tho' she has a\r\nlegal power to make laws for preserving that dependance; yet it\r\nis not necessary for this purpose, nor essential to the relation\r\nbetween a mother-country and her colonies, as was eagerly contended\r\nby the advocates for the Stamp-act, that she should raise money upon\r\nthem without their consent.\r\n\r\nColonies were formerly planted by warlike nations, to keep\r\ntheir enemies in awe; to relieve their country overburthened\r\nwith inhabitants; or to discharge a number of discontented and\r\ntroublesome citizens. But in more modern ages, the spirit of\r\nviolence being in some measure, if the expression may be allowed,\r\nsheathed in commerce, colonies have been settled by the nations of\r\nEurope for the purposes of trade. These purposes were to be attained\r\nby the colonies raising for their mother country those things which\r\nshe did not produce herself; and by supplying themselves from her\r\nwith things they wanted. These were the national objects in the\r\ncommencement of our colonies, and have been uniformly so in their\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nTo answer these grand purposes, perfect liberty was known to be\r\nnecessary; all history proving, that trade and freedom are nearly\r\nrelated to each other. By a due regard to this wise and just plan,\r\nthe infant colonies exposed in the unknown climates, and unexplored\r\nwildernesses of this new world, lived, grew, and flourished.\r\n\r\nThe parent country with undeviating prudence and virtue, attentive\r\nto the first principles of colonization, drew to herself the\r\nbenefits she might reasonably expect, and preserved to her children\r\nthe blessings, on which those benefits were founded. She made laws\r\nobliging her colonies to carry to her all those products which\r\nshe wanted for her own use; and all those raw materials which she\r\nchose herself to work up. Besides this restriction, she forbade\r\nthem to procure manufactures from any other part of the globe; or\r\neven the products of European countries, which alone could rival\r\nher, without being first brought to her. In short, by a variety of\r\nlaws, she regulated their trade in such a manner, as she thought\r\nmost conducive to their mutual advantage, and her own welfare. A\r\npower was reserved to the crown of repealing any laws that should\r\nbe enacted. The executive authority of government was all lodged in\r\nthe crown and its representatives; and an appeal was secured to the\r\ncrown from all judgments in the administration of justice.\r\n\r\nFor all these powers established by the mother country over the\r\ncolonies; for all these immense emoluments derived by her from them;\r\nfor all their difficulties and distresses in fixing themselves,\r\nwhat was the recompense made them? A communication of her rights\r\nin general, and particularly of that great one, the foundation of\r\nall the rest--that their property, acquired with so much pain and\r\nhazard, should not be disposed of by[24] any one but themselves--or\r\nto use the beautiful and emphatic language of the sacred scriptures,\r\n\"that they should sit every man under his vine, and under his fig\r\ntree, and none should make them afraid.\"[25]\r\n\r\n    [24] The power of taxing themselves, was the privileges of which\r\n    the English were, with reason, particularly jealous.\r\n\r\n    Hume's hist. of England.\r\n\r\n    [25] Mic. iv. 4.\r\n\r\nCan any man of candour and knowledge deny, that these institutions,\r\nform an affinity between Great-Britain and her colonies, that\r\nsufficiently secures their dependance upon her? or that for her to\r\nlevy taxes upon them, is to reverse the nature of things? or that\r\nshe can pursue such a measure, without reducing them to a state of\r\nvassalage?\r\n\r\nIf any person cannot conceive the supremacy of Great Britain to\r\nexist, without the power of laying taxes to levy money upon us,\r\nthe history of the colonies and of Great-Britain since their\r\nsettlement will prove the contrary. He will there find the amazing\r\nadvantages arising to her from them--The constant exercise of her\r\nsupremacy--and their filial submission to it, without a single\r\nrebellion, or even the thought of one, from the first emigration to\r\nthis moment--and all these things have happened, without an instance\r\nof Great-Britain laying taxes to levy money upon them.\r\n\r\nHow many British authors[26] have remonstrated that the present\r\nwealth, power and glory of their country are founded on these\r\ncolonies? As constantly as streams tend to the ocean, have they been\r\npouring the fruits of all their labours into their mother's lap.\r\nGood Heaven! And shall a total oblivion of former tendernesses\r\nand blessings be spread over the minds of a wise people, by the\r\nsordid acts of intriguing men, who covering their selfish projects\r\nunder pretences of public good, first enrage their countrymen into\r\na frenzy of passion, and then advance their own influence and\r\ninterest, by gratifying that passion, which they themselves have\r\nbarely excited?\r\n\r\n    [26] It has been said in the house of commons, when complaints\r\n    have been made of the decay of trade to any part of Europe,\r\n    \"That such things were not worth regard, as Great-Britain was\r\n    possest of colonies that could consume more of her manufactures\r\n    than she was able to supply them with.\"\r\n\r\n    \"As the case now stands, we shall shew that the plantations are\r\n    a spring of wealth to this nation, that they work for us, that\r\n    their treasure centers all here, and that the laws have tied\r\n    them fast enough to us; so that it must be through our own fault\r\n    and mismanagement, if they become independent of England.\"\r\n\r\n                     Davenant on the plantat. trade.\r\n\r\n    \"It is better that the islands should be supplied from the\r\n    Northern Colonies than from England, for this reason; the\r\n    provisions we might send to Barbados, Jamaica, &c. would be\r\n    unimproved product of the earth, as grain of all kinds, or such\r\n    product where there is little got by the improvement, as malt,\r\n    salt, beef and pork; indeed the exportation of salt fish thither\r\n    would be more advantageous, but the goods which we send to the\r\n    northern colonies are such, whose improvement may be justly\r\n    said, one with another to be near four fifths of the value of\r\n    the whole commodity, as apparel, household furniture, and many\r\n    other things.\"\r\n\r\n                                               Idem.\r\n\r\n    \"New-England is the most prejudicial plantation to the kingdom\r\n    of England; and yet, to do right to that most industrious\r\n    English colony, I must confess, that though we lose by their\r\n    unlimited trade with other foreign plantations, yet we are very\r\n    great gainers by their direct trade to and from Old England.\r\n    Our yearly exportations of English manufactures, malt and\r\n    other goods, from hence thither, amounting, in my opinion,\r\n    to ten times the value of what is imported from thence;\r\n    which calculation I do not make at random, but upon mature\r\n    consideration, and peradventure, upon as much experience in this\r\n    very trade, as any other person will pretend to; and therefore,\r\n    whenever reformation of our correspondency in trade with that\r\n    people shall be thought on, it will, in my poor judgment,\r\n    require great tenderness, and very serious circumspection.\"\r\n\r\n              Sir Josiah Child's discourse on trade.\r\n\r\n    \"Our plantations spend mostly our English manufactures, and\r\n    those of all sorts almost imaginable, in egregious quantities,\r\n    and employ near two thirds of all our English shipping; so that\r\n    we have more people in England, by reason of our plantations in\r\n    America.\"\r\n\r\n                                               Idem.\r\n\r\n    Sir Josiah Child says, in another part of his work, \"that not\r\n    more than fifty families are maintained in England by the\r\n    refining of sugar.\" From whence, and from what Davenant says, it\r\n    is plain, that the advantages here said to be derived from the\r\n    plantations by England, must be meant chiefly of the continental\r\n    colonies.\r\n\r\n    \"I shall sum up my whole remarks on our American colonies, with\r\n    this observation, that as they are a certain annual revenue\r\n    of several millions sterling to their mother country, they\r\n    ought carefully to be protected, duly encouraged, and every\r\n    opportunity that presents, improved for their increasment and\r\n    advantage, as every one they can possibly reap, must at least\r\n    return to us with interest.\"\r\n\r\n                             Beawes's Lex merc. red.\r\n\r\n    \"We may safely advance, that our trade and navigation are\r\n    greatly increased by our colonies, and that they really are\r\n    a source of treasure and naval power to this kingdom, since\r\n    they work for us, and their treasure centers here. Before\r\n    their settlement, our manufactures were few, and those but\r\n    indifferent; the number of English merchants very small, and the\r\n    whole shipping of the nation much inferior to what now belongs\r\n    to the northern colonies only.

Upon which score, any innovations in the form of\r\n    government there, should be cautiously examined, for fear of\r\n    entering upon measures, by which the industry of the inhabitants\r\n    may be quite discouraged. 'Tis always unfortunate for a people,\r\n    either by consent or upon compulsion, to depart from their\r\n    primitive institutions, and those fundamental, by which they\r\n    were first united together.\"\r\n\r\n                                               Idem.\r\n\r\n    All wise states will well consider how to preserve the\r\n    advantages arising from colonies, and avoid the evils. And I\r\n    conceive that there can be but two ways in nature to hinder\r\n    them from throwing off their dependence; one to keep it out of\r\n    their power, and the other, out of their will. The first must be\r\n    by force; and the latter by using them well, and keeping them\r\n    employed in such productions, and making such manufactures, as\r\n    will support themselves and families comfortably, and procure\r\n    them wealth too, and at least not prejudice their mother country.\r\n\r\n    Force can never be used effectually to answer the end, without\r\n    destroying the colonies themselves. Liberty and encouragement\r\n    are necessary to carry people thither, and to keep them together\r\n    when they are there; and violence will hinder both. Any body\r\n    of troops considerable enough to awe them, and keep them in\r\n    subjection, under the direction too of a needy governor, often\r\n    sent thither to make his fortune, and at such a distance from\r\n    any application for redress, will soon put an end to all\r\n    planting, and leave the country to the soldiers alone, and if\r\n    it did not, would eat up all the profit of the colony. For this\r\n    reason, arbitrary countries have not been equally successful in\r\n    planting colonies with free ones; and what they have done in\r\n    that kind, has either been by force at a vast expence, or by\r\n    departing from the nature of their government, and giving such\r\n    privileges to planters as were denied to their other subjects.\r\n    And I dare say, that a few prudent laws, and a little prudent\r\n    conduct, would soon give us far the greatest share of the riches\r\n    of all America, perhaps drive many of other nations out of it,\r\n    or into our colonies for shelter.\r\n\r\n    There are so many exigencies in all states, so many foreign\r\n    wars and domestic disturbances, that these colonies can never\r\n    want opportunities, if they watch for them, to do what they\r\n    shall find their interest to do; and therefore we ought to\r\n    take all the precautions in our power, that it shall never be\r\n    their interest to act against that of their native country; an\r\n    evil which can no otherways be averted, than by keeping them\r\n    fully employed in such trades as will increase their own, as\r\n    well as our wealth; for it is much to be feared, if we do not\r\n    find employment for them, they may find it for us. The interest\r\n    of the mother country is always to keep them dependent, and\r\n    so employed; and it requires all her address to do it; and it\r\n    is certainly more easily and effectually done by gentle and\r\n    insensible methods, than by power alone.\r\n\r\n                                     Cato's letters.\r\n\r\nHitherto Great-Britain has been contented with her prosperity.\r\nModeration has been the rule of her conduct. But now a generous and\r\nhumane people that so often has protected the liberty of strangers,\r\nis inflamed into an attempt to tear a privilege from her own\r\nchildren, which, if executed, must in their opinion, sink them into\r\nslaves: And for what? For a pernicious power, not necessary to her,\r\nas her own experience may convince her; but horribly dreadful and\r\ndetestable to them.\r\n\r\nIt seems extremely probable, that when cool, dispassionate posterity\r\nshall consider the affectionate intercourse, the reciprocal\r\nbenefits, and the unsuspecting confidence, that have subsisted\r\nbetween these colonies and their parent country, for such a length\r\nof time, they will execrate with the bitterest curses the infamous\r\nmemory of those men, whose pestilential ambition, unnecessarily,\r\nwantonly, first opened the sources of civil discord, between them;\r\nfirst turned their love into jealousy; and first taught these\r\nprovinces, filled with grief and anxiety, to enquire,\r\n\r\n    \"_Mens ubi materna est?_\"\r\n      Where is maternal affection.\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Countrymen,_\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be objected against the arguments that have been\r\noffered to the public concerning the legal power of the parliament,\r\nthat it has always exercised the power of imposing duties for the\r\npurposes of raising a revenue on the productions of these colonies\r\ncarried to Great-Britain, which may be called a tax on them. To this\r\nI answer; that is no more a violation of the rights of the colonies,\r\nthan their being ordered to carry certain of their productions to\r\nGreat-Britain, which is no violation at all; it being implied in\r\nthe relation between them, that the colonies should not carry such\r\ncommodities to other nations, as should enable them to interfere\r\nwith the mother country. The duties imposed on these commodities\r\nwhen brought to her, are only a consequence of her paternal right;\r\nand if the point is thoroughly examined, will be found to be laid\r\non the people of the mother country, and not at all dangerous to\r\nthe liberties of the colonies. Whatever these duties are, they\r\nmust proportionably raise the price of the goods, and consequently\r\nthe duties must be paid by the consumers. In this light they were\r\nconsidered by the parliament in the 25 Char. II. Chap. 7, sec. 2,\r\nwhich says, that the productions of the plantations were carried\r\nfrom one to another free from all customs \"while the subjects of\r\nthis your kingdom of England have paid great customs and impositions\r\nfor what of them have been spent here, &c.\" Such duties therefore\r\ncan never be injurious to the liberties of the colonies.\r\n\r\nBesides, if Great-Britain exports these commodities again, the\r\nduties will injure her own trade, so that she cannot hurt us without\r\nplainly and immediately hurting herself; and this is our check\r\nagainst her acting arbitrarily in this respect.\r\n\r\nIt[27] may, perhaps, be further objected, \"that it being granted that\r\nstatutes made for regulating trade are binding upon us, it will be\r\ndifficult for any persons but the makers of the laws to determine,\r\nwhich of them are made for the regulating of trade, and which for\r\nraising a revenue; and that from hence may arise confusion.\"\r\n\r\n    [27] 'If any one should observe, that no opposition has been\r\n    made to the legality of the 4th Geo. III. ch. 15, which is\r\n    the first act of parliament that ever imposed duties on the\r\n    importations in America, for the express purpose of raising a\r\n    revenue there, I answer, first, that tho' that act expressly\r\n    mentions the raising a revenue in America, yet it seems that\r\n    it had as much in view, \"the improving and securing the trade\r\n    between the same and Great-Britain,\" which words are part of\r\n    its title, and the preamble says, \"Whereas it is expedient\r\n    that new provisions and regulations should be established for\r\n    improving the revenue of this kingdom, and for extending and\r\n    securing the navigation and commerce between Great-Britain and\r\n    your Majesty's dominions in America, which, by the peace, have\r\n    been so happily extended and enlarged, &c.\" 'Secondly, all\r\n    the duties mentioned in that act, are imposed solely on the\r\n    productions and manufactures of foreign countries, and not a\r\n    single duty laid on any production or manufacture of our mother\r\n    country. Thirdly, the authority of the provincial assemblies\r\n    is not therein so plainly attacked, as by the last act, which\r\n    makes provision for defraying the charges of the administration\r\n    of justice, and the support of civil government, 4thly, That it\r\n    being doubtful whether the intention of the 4th Geo. III. ch.\r\n    15, was not as much to regulate trade as to raise a revenue, the\r\n    minds of the people here were wholly engrossed by the terror of\r\n    the Stamp-act, then impending over them, about the intention of\r\n    which they could be in no doubt.'\r\n\r\n    'These reasons so far distinguish 4th Geo. III. ch. 15, from\r\n    the last act, that it is not to be wondered at, that the first\r\n    should have been submitted to, though the last should excite the\r\n    most universal and spirited opposition. For this will be found\r\n    on the strictest examination to be, in the principle on which\r\n    it is founded, and in the consequences that must attend it, if\r\n    possible, more destructive than the Stamp-act. It is, to speak\r\n    plainly, a prodigy in our laws, not having one British feature.'\r\n\r\nTo this I answer, that the objection is of no force in the present\r\ncase, or such as resemble it, because the act now in question is\r\nformed expressly for the sole purpose of raising a revenue.\r\n\r\nHowever, supposing the design of the parliament had not been\r\nexpressed, the objection seems to me of no weight, with regard to\r\nthe influence, which those who may make it, might expect it ought\r\nto have on the conduct of the colonies.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that impositions for raising a revenue, may be hereafter\r\ncalled regulations of trade, but names will not change the nature\r\nof things. Indeed we ought firmly to believe, what is an undoubted\r\ntruth, confirmed by the unhappy experience of many states heretofore\r\nfree, that unless the most watchful attention be exerted, a new\r\nservitude may be slipped upon us under the sanction of usual and\r\nrespectable terms.\r\n\r\nThus the Cæsars ruined Roman liberty, under the titles of tribunical\r\nand dictatorial authorities,----old and venerable dignities, known\r\nin the most flourishing times of freedom. In imitation of the same\r\npolicy, James II. when he meant to establish popery, talked of\r\nliberty of conscience, the most sacred of all liberties; and had\r\nthereby almost deceived the dissenters into destruction.\r\n\r\nAll artful rulers, who strive to extend their own power beyond its\r\njust limits, endeavour to give to their attempts, as much semblance\r\nof legality as possible. Those who succeed them may venture to go a\r\nlittle farther; for each new encroachment will be strengthened by a\r\nformer, [28]\"That which is now supported by examples, growing old,\r\nwill become an example itself,\" and thus support fresh usurpations.\r\n\r\n    [28] Tacitus.\r\n\r\nA free people, therefore, can never be too quick in observing, nor\r\ntoo firm in opposing the beginnings of alterations, either in form\r\nor reality, respecting institutions formed for their security. The\r\nfirst leads to the last; on the other hand nothing is more certain,\r\nthan that forms of liberty may be retained, when the substance is\r\ngone. In government as well as in religion, \"the letter killeth, but\r\nthe spirit giveth life.\"[29]\r\n\r\n    [29] 2 Cor. iii. 6.\r\n\r\nI will beg leave to enforce this remark by a few instances. The\r\ncrown, by the constitution, has the prerogative of creating peers;\r\nthe existence of that order in due number and dignity, is essential\r\nto the constitution; and if the crown did not exercise that\r\nprerogative, the peerage must have long since decreased so much, as\r\nto have lost its proper influence. Suppose a prince for some unjust\r\npurposes, should from time to time advance many needy profligate\r\nwretches, to that rank, that all the independance of the house of\r\nLords should be destroyed, there would then be a manifest violation\r\nof the constitution, under the appearance of using legal prerogative.\r\n\r\nThe house of Commons claim the privilege of forming all money-bills,\r\nand will not suffer either of the other branches of the legislature\r\nto add to or alter them; contending that their power, simply extends\r\nto an acceptance or rejection of them. This privilege appears to\r\nbe just; but under pretence of this just privilege, the house of\r\nCommons has claimed a licence of tacking to money bills, clauses\r\nrelating to many things of a totally different kind, and have thus\r\nforced them, in a manner, on the crown and lords. This seems to\r\nbe an abuse of that privilege, and it may be vastly more abused.\r\nSuppose a future house; influenced by some displaced discontented\r\ndemagogues, in a time of danger, should tack to a money bill\r\nsomething so injurious to the king and peers, that they would not\r\nassent to it and yet the Commons should obstinately insist on it;\r\nthe whole kingdom would be exposed to ruin, _under the appearance of\r\nmaintaining a valuable privilege_.\r\n\r\nIn these cases it might be difficult for a while to determine,\r\nwhether the King intended to exercise his prerogative in a\r\nconstitutional manner or not; or whether the Commons insisted on the\r\ndemand factitiously, or for the public good: But surely the conduct\r\nof the crown, or of the house, would in time sufficiently explain\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nOught not the people therefore to watch to observe facts? to search\r\ninto causes? to investigate designs? and have they not a right\r\nof judging from the evidence before them, on no slighter points\r\nthan their liberty and happiness? It would be less than trifling,\r\nwherever a British government is established, to make use of any\r\nother arguments to prove such a right. It is sufficient to remind\r\nthe reader of the day on which King William landed at Torbay.[30]\r\n\r\n    [30] November 5, 1688.\r\n\r\nI will now apply what has been said to the present question. The\r\nnature of any impositions laid by parliament on the colonies, must\r\ndetermine the design in laying them. It may not be easy in every\r\ninstance to discover that design. Whenever it is doubtful, I think\r\nsubmission cannot be dangerous; nay, it must be right: for, in my\r\nopinion, there is no privilege the colonies claim, which they ought,\r\nin duty and prudence, more earnestly to maintain and defend, than\r\nthe authority of the British parliament to regulate the trade of all\r\nher dominions. Without this authority, the benefits she enjoys from\r\nour commerce, must be lost to her: The blessings we enjoy from our\r\ndependance upon her, must be lost to us; her strength must decay;\r\nher glory vanish; and she cannot suffer, without our partaking in\r\nher misfortune.----\"Let us therefore cherish her interest as our\r\nown, and give her every thing that it becomes FREEMEN to give or to\r\nreceive.\"\r\n\r\nThe _nature_ of any impositions she may lay upon us, may in general\r\nbe known, considering how far they relate to the preserving, in due\r\norder, the connexion between the several parts of the _British_\r\nempire. One thing we may be assured of, which is this; whenever a\r\nstatute imposes duties on commodities, to be paid only upon their\r\nexportation from Great-Britain to these colonies, it is not a\r\nregulation of trade, but a design to raise a revenue upon us. Other\r\ninstances may happen, which it may not be necessary to dwell on.\r\nI hope these colonies will never, to their latest existence, want\r\nunderstanding sufficient to discover the intentions of those who\r\nrule over them, nor the resolution necessary for asserting their\r\ninterests. They will always have the same right that all free states\r\nhave, of judging when their privileges are invaded, and of using all\r\nprudent measures for preserving them.\r\n\r\n    \"_Quocirca vivite fortes_\"\r\n    \"_Fortiaque adversis opponite pectora rebus_,\"\r\n\r\nWherefore keep up your spirits, and gallantly oppose this adverse\r\ncourse of affairs.\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Countrymen_,\r\n\r\nThis letter is intended more particularly for such of you,\r\nwhose employment in life may have prevented your attending to\r\nthe consideration of some points that are of great and public\r\nimportance. For many such persons there must be even in these\r\ncolonies, where the inhabitants in general are more intelligent than\r\nany other people, as has been remarked by strangers, and it seems\r\nwith reason.\r\n\r\nSome of you perhaps, filled as I know your breasts are with loyalty\r\nto our most excellent prince, and with love to our dear mother\r\ncountry, may feel yourselves inclined by the affections of your\r\nhearts, to approve every action of those whom you so much venerate\r\nand esteem.\r\n\r\nA prejudice thus flowing from goodness of disposition is amiable\r\nindeed. I wish it could be indulged without danger. Did I think this\r\npossible, the error should have been adopted, not opposed by me.\r\nBut in truth, all men are subject to the passions and frailties of\r\nnature; and therefore whatever regard we entertain for the persons\r\nof those who govern us, we should always remember that their\r\nconduct as rulers may be influenced by human infirmities.\r\n\r\nWhen any laws injurious to these colonies are passed, we cannot,\r\nwith the least propriety, suppose that any injury was intended us\r\nby his Majesty or the Lords. For the assent of the crown and peers\r\nto law seems, as far as I am able to judge, to have been vested\r\nin them, more for their own security than for any other purpose.\r\nOn the other hand, it is the particular business of the people to\r\nenquire and discover what regulations are useful for themselves,\r\nand to digest and present them in the form of bills to the other\r\norders, to have them enacted into laws--Where these laws are to\r\nbind themselves, it may be expected that the house of Commons will\r\nvery carefully consider them: But when they are making laws, that\r\nare not designed to bind themselves, we cannot imagine that their\r\ndeliberations will be as cautious and scrupulous as in their own\r\ncase.[31]\r\n\r\n    [31] Many remarkable instances might be produced of the\r\n    extraordinary inattention with which bills of great importance,\r\n    concerning these colonies, have passed in parliament; which is\r\n    owing, as it is supposed, to the bills being brought in by the\r\n    persons who have points to carry, so artfully framed, that it is\r\n    not easy for the members in general, in the haste of business,\r\n    to discover their tendency.\r\n\r\n    The following instances shew the truth of this remark. When\r\n    Mr. Grenville, in the violence of reformation and innovation,\r\n    formed the 4th Geo. III. chap. 15th, for regulating the American\r\n    trade, the word \"Ireland\" was dropt in the clause relating to\r\n    our iron and lumber, so that we could send these articles to\r\n    no other part of Europe, but to Great-Britain. This was so\r\n    unreasonable a restriction, and so contrary to the sentiments of\r\n    the legislature, for many years before, that it is surprising it\r\n    should not have been taken notice of in the house. However the\r\n    bill passed into a law. But when the matter was explained, this\r\n    restriction was taken off in a subsequent act.\r\n\r\n    I cannot postively say, how long after the taking off this\r\n    restriction, as I have not the acts; but I think in less than\r\n    eighteen months, another act of parliament passed, in which the\r\n    word \"Ireland,\" was left out as it had been before. The matter\r\n    being a second time explained, was a second time regulated.\r\n\r\n    Now if it be considered, that the omission mentioned struck\r\n    off, with one word, so very great a part of our trade, it must\r\n    appear remarkable: and equally so is the method by which rice\r\n    became an enumerated commodity, and therefore could be carried\r\n    to Great-Britain only.\r\n\r\n    \"The enumeration was obtained, (says Mr. Gee*) by one Cole,\r\n    a Captain of a ship, employed by a company then trading to\r\n    Carolina; for several ships going from England thither and\r\n    purchasing rice for Portugal, prevented the aforesaid Captain of\r\n    a loading. Upon his coming home, he possessed one Mr. Lowndes,\r\n    a member of parliament (who was very frequently employed to\r\n    prepare bills) with an opinion, that carrying rice directly to\r\n    Portugal was a prejudice to the trade of England, and privately\r\n    got a clause into an act to make it an enumerated commodity; by\r\n    which means he secured a freight to himself. But the consequence\r\n    proved a vast loss to the nation.\"\r\n\r\n        [* Gee on trade, p. 32.]\r\n\r\n    I find that this clause \"privately got into an act,\" for the\r\n    benefit of Capt. Cole, \"to the vast loss of the nation,\"\r\n    is foisted into the 3d Anne, chap. 5, intituled, \"An act\r\n    for granting to her Majesty a further subsidy on wines and\r\n    merchandizes imported,\" with which it has no more connexion,\r\n    than with 34th Edw. I. 34th and 35th of Henry VIII. or the 25th\r\n    of Car. II. which provide that no person shall be taxed but by\r\n    himself or his representative.\r\n\r\nI am told that there is a wonderful address frequently used in\r\ncarrying points in the house of commons, by persons experienced in\r\nthese affairs--that opportunities are watched--and sometimes votes\r\nare past, that if all the members had been present, would have been\r\nrejected by a great majority. Certain it is, that when a powerful\r\nand artful man has determined on any measure against these colonies,\r\nhe has always succeeded in his attempt. Perhaps therefore it will\r\nbe proper for us, whenever any oppressive act affecting us is past,\r\nto attribute it to the inattention of the members of the house of\r\ncommons, and to the malevolence or ambition of some factious great\r\nman, rather than to any other cause.\r\n\r\nNow I do verily believe, that the late act of parliament imposing\r\nduties on paper, &c. was formed by Mr. Grenville and his party,\r\nbecause it is evidently a part of that plan, by which he endeavoured\r\nto render himself popular at home; and I do also believe that not\r\none half of the members of the house of commons, even of those who\r\nheard it read, did perceive how destructive it was to American\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, as it is usual in Great-Britain, to consider the\r\nKing's speech, as the speech of the ministry, it may be right here\r\nto consider this act as the act of a party.--Perhaps I should speak\r\nmore properly if I was to use another term.--\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of laying taxes.--One is by imposing a certain\r\nsum on particular kinds of property, to be paid by the user or\r\nconsumer, or by taxing the person at a certain sum; the other is, by\r\nimposing a certain sum on particular kinds of property to be paid by\r\nthe seller.\r\n\r\nWhen a man pays the first sort of tax, he knows with certainty\r\nthat he pays so much money for a tax. The consideration for which\r\nhe pays it is remote, and it may be does not occur to him. He is\r\nsensible too that he is commanded and obliged to pay it as a tax;\r\nand therefore people are apt to be displeased with this sort of tax.\r\n\r\nThe other sort of tax is submitted to in a very different manner.\r\nThe purchaser of any article very seldom reflects that the seller\r\nraises his price so as to indemnify him for the tax he has paid. He\r\nknows the prices of things are continually fluctuating, and if he\r\nthinks about the tax, he thinks at the same time in all probability,\r\nthat he might have paid as much, if the article he buys had not been\r\ntaxed. He gets something visible and agreeable for his money, and\r\ntax and price are so confounded together, that he cannot separate,\r\nor does not chuse to take the trouble of separating them.\r\n\r\nThis mode of taxation therefore is the mode suited to arbitrary\r\nand oppressive governments. The love of liberty is so natural to\r\nthe human heart, that unfeeling tyrants think themselves obliged\r\nto accommodate their schemes as much as they can to the appearance\r\nof justice and reason, and to deceive those whom they resolve to\r\ndestroy or oppress, by presenting to them a miserable picture of\r\nfreedom, when the inestimable original is lost.\r\n\r\nThis policy did not escape the cruel and rapacious Nero. That\r\nmonster, apprehensive that his crimes might endanger his authority\r\nand life, thought proper to do some popular acts to secure the\r\nobedience of his subjects. Among other things, says [32]Tacitus, \"he\r\nremitted the twenty-fifth part of the price on the sale of slaves,\r\nbut rather in shew than reality; for the seller being ordered to pay\r\nit, it became a part of the price to the buyer.\"\r\n\r\n    [32] Tacitus's An. b. 13. f. 31.\r\n\r\nThis is the reflection of the judicious historian: but the deluded\r\npeople gave their infamous emperor full credit for his false\r\ngenerosity. Other nations have been treated in the same manner the\r\nRomans were. The honest industrious Germans who are settled in\r\ndifferent parts of this continent can inform us, that it was this\r\nsort of tax that drove them from their native land to our woods, at\r\nthat time the seats of perfect and undisturbed freedom.\r\n\r\nTheir princes inflamed by the lust of power and the lust of avarice,\r\ntwo furies, that the more hungry they grow, transgressed the\r\nbounds, they ought in regard to themselves, to have observed. To\r\nkeep up the deception in the minds of subjects \"there must be,\" says\r\na very learned author[33] \"some proportion between the impost and the\r\nvalue of the commodity; wherefore there ought not to be an excessive\r\nduty upon merchandizes of little value. There are countries in\r\nwhich the duty exceeds seventeen or eighteen times the value of\r\nthe commodity. In this case the prince removes the illusion. His\r\nsubjects plainly see they are dealt with in an unreasonable manner,\r\nwhich renders them most exquisitely sensible of their slavish\r\nsituation.\"\r\n\r\n    [33] Montesquieu's spirit of laws, b. 13. chap. 8.\r\n\r\nFrom hence it appears that subjects may be ground down into misery\r\nby this sort of taxation as well as the other. They may be as much\r\nimpoverished if their money is taken from them in this way, as\r\nin the other; and that it will be taken, may be more evident, by\r\nattending to a few more considerations.\r\n\r\nThe merchant, or importer who pays the duty at first, will\r\nnot consent to be so much money out of pocket. He, therefore,\r\nproportionably raises the price of his goods. It may then be said to\r\nbe a contest between him and the person offering to buy, who shall\r\nlose the duty. This must be decided by the nature of the commodities\r\nand the purchasers demand for them. If they are mere luxuries,\r\nhe is at liberty to do as he pleases, and if he buys, he does it\r\nvoluntarily: But if they are absolute necessaries, or conveniences\r\nwhich use and custom have made requisite for the comfort of life,\r\nand which he is not permitted, by the power imposing the duty, to\r\nget elsewhere, there the seller has a plain advantage, and the\r\nbuyer must pay the duty. In fact, the seller is nothing less than\r\nthe collector of the tax for the power that imposed it. If these\r\nduties then are extended to necessaries and conveniences of life in\r\ngeneral, and enormously increased, the people must at length become\r\nindeed \"most exquisitely sensible of their slavish situation.\"\r\n\r\nTheir happiness, therefore, entirely depends on the moderation of\r\nthose who have authority to impose the duties.\r\n\r\nI shall now apply these observations to the late act of parliament.\r\nCertain duties are thereby imposed on paper and glass, &c. imported\r\ninto these colonies. By the laws of _Great-Britain_ we are\r\nprohibited to get these articles from any other part of the world.\r\nWe cannot at present, nor for many years to come, though we should\r\napply ourselves to these manufactures with the utmost industry,\r\nmake enough ourselves for our own use. That paper and glass are not\r\nonly convenient, but absolutely necessary for us, I imagine very\r\nfew will contend. Some, perhaps, who think mankind grew wicked and\r\nluxurious as soon as they found out another way of communicating\r\ntheir sentiments than by speech, and another way of dwelling than\r\nin caves, may advance so whimsical an opinion. But I presume nobody\r\nwill take the unnecessary trouble of refuting them.\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks I think it evident, that we must use paper and\r\nglass, that what we use must be _British_, and that we must pay the\r\nduties imposed unless those who sell these articles are so generous\r\nas to make us presents of the duties they pay, which is not to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nSome persons may think this act of no consequence, because the\r\nduties are so _small_. A fatal error. That is the very circumstance\r\nmost alarming to me. For I am convinced that the authors of this\r\nlaw, would never have obtained an act to raise so trifling a sum, as\r\nit must do, had they not intended by it to establish a _precedent_\r\nfor future use. To console ourselves with the _smallness_ of the\r\nduties, is to walk deliberately into the snare that is set for us,\r\npraising the _neatness_ of the workmanship. Suppose the duties,\r\nimposed by the late act, could be paid by these distressed colonies,\r\nwith the utmost ease, and that the purposes, to which they are\r\nto be applied, were the most reasonable and equitable that could\r\nbe conceived, the contrary of which I hope to demonstrate before\r\nthese letters are concluded, yet even in such a supposed case,\r\nthese colonies ought to regard the act with abhorrence. For who\r\nare a free people? not those over whom government is reasonably\r\nand equitably exercised but those who live under a government, so\r\n_constitutionally checked_ and _controuled_, that proper provision\r\nis made against its being otherwise exercised. The late act is\r\nfounded on the destruction of this constitutional security.\r\n\r\nIf the parliament have a right to lay a duty of four shillings and\r\neight pence on a hundred weight of glass, or a ream of paper, they\r\nhave a right to lay a duty of any other sum on either. They may\r\nraise the duty as the author before quoted says, has been done in\r\nsome countries, till it \"exceeds seventeen or eighteen times the\r\nvalue of the commodity.\" In short, if they have a right to levy a\r\ntax of _one penny_ upon us, they have a right to levy a _million_\r\nupon us. For where does their right stop? At any given number of\r\npence, shillings, or pounds? To attempt to limit their right, after\r\ngranting it to exist at all, is as contrary to reason, as granting\r\nit to exist at all is contrary to justice. If they have any right\r\nto tax us, then, whether our own money shall continue in our own\r\npockets, or not, depends no longer on _us_, but on _them_. \"There\r\nis nothing which we can call our own\", or to use the words of Mr.\r\n_Locke_, \"What property have\" we \"in that, which another may, by\r\nright, take, when he pleases, to himself.\"[34]\r\n\r\n    [34] Speech Lord Cambden lately published.\r\n\r\nThese duties, which will inevitably be levied upon us, and which\r\nare now levying upon us, are expressly laid for the sole purpose\r\nof taking money. This is the true definition of taxes. They are\r\ntherefore taxes. This money is to be taken from us. We are therefore\r\ntaxed. Those who are taxed without their own consent, given by\r\nthemselves, or their representatives, are slaves.[35] We are taxed\r\nwithout our own consent given by ourselves, or our representatives.\r\nWe are therefore----I speak it with grief----I speak it with\r\nindignation----we are slaves.\r\n\r\n    \"_Miserabile vulgus._\"\r\n      A miserable tribe.\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n    [35] This is the opinion of Mr. Pitt, in his speech on the\r\n    Stamp-act.\r\n\r\n    \"It is my opinion, that this kingdom has no right to lay a tax\r\n    upon the colonies. The AMERICANS are the SONS, not the BASTARDS\r\n    of ENGLAND. The distinction between legislation and taxation\r\n    is essentially necessary to liberty. The Commons of America\r\n    represented in their several assemblies, have ever been in\r\n    possession of this their constitutional right of giving and\r\n    granting their own money. They would have been slaves if they\r\n    had not enjoyed it. The idea of a virtual representation of\r\n    America, in this house, is the most contemptible idea that ever\r\n    entered into the head of man. It does not deserve a serious\r\n    refutation.\"\r\n\r\n    That great and excellent man Lord Cambden, maintains the same\r\n    opinion in his speech, in the house of peers, on the declaratory\r\n    bill of the sovereignty of Great-Britain over the colonies.\r\n    The following extracts so perfectly agree with, and confirm\r\n    the sentiments avowed in these letters, that it is hoped the\r\n    inserting them in this note will be excused.\r\n\r\n    \"As the affair is of the utmost importance, and in its\r\n    consequences may involve the fate of kingdoms, I took the\r\n    strictest review of my arguments; I re-examined all my\r\n    authorities; fully determined, if I found myself mistaken,\r\n    publicly to own my mistake, and give up my opinion, but my\r\n    searches have more and more convinced me, that the British\r\n    parliament have no right to tax the Americans. Nor is the\r\n    doctrine new; it is as old as the constitution; it grew up with\r\n    it, indeed it is its support. Taxation and representation are\r\n    inseparably united. God hath joined them; no British parliament\r\n    can separate them; to endeavour to do it is to stab our vitals.\r\n\r\n    \"My position is this--I repeat it--I will maintain it to my\r\n    last hour--Taxation and representation are inseparable. This\r\n    position is founded on the laws of nature; it is more, it\r\n    is itself an eternal law of nature; for whatever is a man's\r\n    own, is absolutely his own; and no man hath a right to take\r\n    it from him without his consent, either expressed by himself\r\n    or representative; whoever attempts to do it, attempts an\r\n    injury; whoever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down\r\n    the distinction between liberty and slavery.\" \"There is not\r\n    a blade of grass, in the most obscure corner of the kingdom,\r\n    which is not, which was not, represented since the constitution\r\n    began: there is not a blade of grass, which when taxed, was not\r\n    taxed by the consent of the proprietor.\" \"The forefathers of\r\n    the Americans did not leave their native country, and subject\r\n    themselves to every danger and distress, to be reduced to the\r\n    state of slavery. They did not give up their rights; they looked\r\n    for protection, and not for chains, from their mother-country.\r\n    By her they expected to be defended in the possession of their\r\n    property; and not to be deprived of it: For should the present\r\n    power continue, there is nothing which they can call their own,\r\n    or, to use the words of Mr. Locke, what property have they in\r\n    that, which another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to him\r\n    self.\"\r\n\r\n    It is impossible to read this speech and Mr. Pitt's, and not be\r\n    charmed with the generous zeal for the rights of mankind, that\r\n    glows in every sentence. These great and good men, animated by\r\n    the subject they speak upon, seem to rise above all the former\r\n    glorious exertions of their abilities. A foreigner might be\r\n    tempted to think they are Americans, asserting with all the\r\n    ardour of patriotism, and all the anxiety of apprehension,\r\n    the cause of their native land, and not Britons striving to\r\n    stop their mistaken countrymen from oppressing others. There\r\n    reasoning is not only just; it is \"vehement,\" as Mr. Hume says\r\n    of the eloquence of Demosthenes, \"'Tis disdain, anger, boldness,\r\n    freedom, involved in a continual stream of argument.\" Hume's\r\n    Essay on Eloquence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Countrymen_,\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, a dangerous example is set in the last act relating\r\nto these colonies. The power of parliament to levy money upon us for\r\nraising a revenue, is therein avowed and exerted. Regarding the act\r\non this single principle, I must again repeat, and I think it my\r\nduty to repeat, that to me it appears to be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nNo man, who considers the conduct of parliament since the repeal\r\nof the Stamp-act, and the disposition of many people at home, can\r\ndoubt, that the chief object of attention there, is, to use Mr.\r\nGrenville's expression, \"providing that the dependance and obedience\r\nof the colonies be asserted and maintained.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this notion, instantly on repealing the\r\nStamp-act, an act passed, declaring the power of parliament to\r\nbind these colonies in all cases whatever. This, however, was only\r\nplanting a barren tree, that cast a shade indeed over the colonies,\r\nbut yielded no fruit. It being determined to enforce the authority\r\non which the Stamp-act was founded, the parliament having never\r\nrenounced the right, as Mr. Pitt advised them to do; and it being\r\nthought proper to disguise that authority in such a manner, as not\r\nagain to alarm the colonies; some little time was required to find\r\na method, by which both these points should be united. At last the\r\ningenuity of Mr. Greenville and his party accomplished the matter,\r\nas it was thought, in \"An act for granting certain duties in the\r\nBritish colonies and plantations in America, for allowing drawbacks,\r\n&c. which is the title of the act laying duties on paper, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThe parliament having several times before imposed duties to be paid\r\nin America, it was expected no doubt, that the repetition of such\r\na measure would be passed over as an usual thing. But to have done\r\nthis, without expressly asserting and maintaining \"the power of\r\nparliament to take our money without our consent,\" and to apply it\r\nas they please, would not have been sufficiently declarative of its\r\nsupremacy, nor sufficiently depressive of American freedom.\r\n\r\nTherefore it is, that in this memorable act we find it expressly\r\n\"provided\" that money shall be levied upon us without our consent,\r\nfor purposes, that render it, if possible, more dreadful than the\r\nStamp-act.\r\n\r\nThat act, alarming as it was, declared, the money thereby to\r\nbe raised, should be applied \"towards defraying the expences\r\nof defending, protecting and securing the British colonies and\r\nplantations in America:\" And it is evident from the whole act,\r\nthat by the word \"British\" were intended colonies and plantations\r\nsettled by British people, and not generally, those subject to the\r\nBritish crown. That act therefore seemed to have something gentle\r\nand kind in its intention, and to aim only at our own welfare: But\r\nthe act now objected to, imposes duties upon the British colonies,\r\n\"to defray the expences of defending, protecting and securing his\r\nMajesty's dominions in America.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a change of words! What an incomputable addition to the\r\nexpences intended by the Stamp-act! \"His Majesty's dominions\"\r\ncomprehended not only the British colonies; but also the conquered\r\nprovinces of Canada and Florida, and the British garrisons of\r\nNova-Scotia; for these do not deserve the name of colonies.\r\n\r\nWhat justice is there in making us pay for \"defending, protecting\r\nand securing\" these places? What benefit can we, or have we ever\r\nderived from them? None of them was conquered for us; nor will \"be\r\ndefended, protected and secured\" for us.\r\n\r\nIn fact, however advantageous the subduing or keeping any of these\r\ncountries may be to Great-Britain, the acquisition is greatly\r\ninjurious to these colonies. Our chief property consists in lands.\r\nThese would have been of a much greater value, if such prodigious\r\nadditions had not been made to the British territories on this\r\ncontinent. The natural increase of our own people, if confined\r\nwithin the colonies, would have raised the value still higher and\r\nhigher, every fifteen or twenty years. Besides, we should have lived\r\nmore compactly together, and have been therefore more able to resist\r\nany enemy.\r\n\r\nBut now the inhabitants will be thinly scattered over an immense\r\nregion, as those who want settlements, will chuse to make new ones,\r\nrather than pay great prices for old ones.\r\n\r\nThese are the consequences to the colonies of the hearty assistance\r\nthey gave to Great-Britain in the late war.----A war, undertaken\r\nsolely for her own benefit. The objects of it were, the securing to\r\nherself the rich tracts of land on the back of these colonies, with\r\nthe Indian trade, and Nova-Scotia with the fishery. These, and much\r\nmore has that kingdom gained; but the inferior animals that hunted\r\nwith the Lion, have been amply rewarded for all the sweat and blood\r\ntheir loyalty cost them, by the honour of having sweated and bled in\r\nsuch company.\r\n\r\nI will not go so far as to say, that Canada and Nova-Scotia are\r\ncurbs on New-England; the chain of forts through the back woods, on\r\nthe middle provinces; and Florida, on the rest: but I will venture\r\nto say, that if the products of Canada, Nova-Scotia and Florida,\r\ndeserve any consideration, the two first of them are only rivals of\r\nour northern colonies and the other of our southern.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, that without the conquest of these countries, the\r\ncolonies could not have been \"protected, defended, and secured;\"\r\nIf that is true, it may with as much propriety be said, that\r\nGreat-Britain could not have been \"defended, protected, and secured\"\r\nwithout that conquest: for the colonies are parts of her empire,\r\nwhich it is as much concerns her as them to keep out of the hands of\r\nany other power.\r\n\r\nBut these colonies when they were much weaker, defended themselves,\r\nbefore this conquest was made; and could again do it, against any\r\nthat might properly be called their enemies. If France and Spain\r\nindeed should attack them, as members of the British empire perhaps\r\nthey might be distressed; but it would be in a British quarrel.\r\n\r\nThe largest account I have seen of the number of people in Canada,\r\ndoes not make them exceed 90,000. Florida can hardly be said to have\r\nany inhabitants----It is computed that there are in our colonies,\r\n3,000,000.--Our force therefore must encrease with a disproportion\r\nto the growth of their strength, that would render us very safe.\r\n\r\nThis being the state of the case, I cannot think it just, that these\r\ncolonies, labouring under so many misfortunes, should be loaded\r\nwith taxes, to maintain countries not only not useful, but hurtful\r\nto them. The support of Canada and Florida cost yearly, it is said,\r\nhalf a million sterling. From hence we may make some guess of the\r\nload that is to be laid upon us; for we are not only to \"defend,\r\nprotect, and secure\" them, but also to make \"an adequate provision\r\nfor defraying the charge of the administration of justice and the\r\nsupport of civil government, in such provinces where it shall be\r\nfound necessary.\"\r\n\r\nNot one of the provinces of Canada, Nova-Scotia, or Florida, has\r\never defrayed these expences within itself: And if the duties\r\nimposed by the last statute are collected, all of them together,\r\naccording to the best information I can get, will not pay\r\none-quarter as much as Pennsylvania alone. So that the British\r\ncolonies are to be drained of the rewards of their labour, to\r\ncherish the scorching sands of Florida, and the icy rocks of Canada\r\nand Nova-Scotia, which never will return to us one farthing that we\r\nsend to them.\r\n\r\nGreat-Britain----I mean the ministry in Great-Britain, has cantoned\r\nCanada and Florida out into five or six governments, and may form\r\nas many more. She now has fourteen or fifteen regiments on this\r\ncontinent; and may send over as many more. To make \"an adequate\r\nprovision\" for all these expences, is, no doubt, to be the\r\ninheritance of the colonies.\r\n\r\nCan any man believe that the duties upon paper, &c. are the last\r\nthat will be laid for these purposes? It is in vain to hope, that\r\nbecause it is imprudent to lay duties on the exportation of\r\nmanufactures from a mother country to colonies, as it may promote\r\nmanufactures among them, that this consideration will prevent them.\r\n\r\nAmbitious, artful men have made the measure popular, and whatever\r\ninjustice or destruction will attend it in the opinion of the\r\ncolonists, at home it will be thought just and salutary.[36]\r\n\r\n    [36] \"So credulous, as well as obstinate, are the people in\r\n    believing every thing, which flatters their prevailing passion.\"\r\n\r\n                              Hume's Hist. of England.\r\n\r\nThe people of Great-Britain will be told, and they have been told,\r\nthat they are sinking under an immense debt--that great part of this\r\ndebt has been contracted in defending the colonies--that these are\r\nso ungrateful and undutiful, that they will not contribute one mite\r\nto its payment--nor even to the support of the army now kept up for\r\ntheir \"protection and security\"--that they are rolling in wealth,\r\nand are of so bold and republican a spirit, that they are aiming at\r\nindependence--that the only way to retain them in \"obedience\" is to\r\nkeep a strict watch over them, and to draw off part of their riches\r\nin taxes--and that every burden laid upon them is taking off so much\r\nfrom Great-Britain--These assertions will be generally believed,\r\nand the people will be persuaded that they cannot be too angry with\r\ntheir colonies, as that anger will be profitable to themselves.\r\n\r\nIn truth, Great-Britain alone receives any benefit from Canada,\r\nNova-Scotia, and Florida; and therefore she alone ought to maintain\r\nthem.--The old maxim of the law is drawn from reason and justice,\r\nand never could be more properly applied, than in this case.\r\n\r\n     \"_Qui sentit, commodum, sentire debet et onus._\"\r\n\r\n     They who feel the benefit, ought to feel the burden.\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Countrymen_,\r\n\r\nI have made some observations on the purposes for which money is to\r\nbe levied upon us by the late act of parliament. I shall now offer\r\nto your consideration some further reflections on that subject; and,\r\nunless I am greatly mistaken, if these purposes are accomplished,\r\naccording to the exprest intention of the act, they will be\r\nfound effectually to supersede that authority in our respective\r\nassemblies, which is most essential to liberty. The question is not\r\nwhether some branches shall be lopt off--The ax is laid to the root\r\nof the tree; and the whole body must infallibly perish, if we remain\r\nidle spectators of the work.\r\n\r\nNo free people ever existed, or ever can exist, without, keeping, to\r\nuse a common but strong expression, \"the purse strings\" in their own\r\nhands. Where this is the case, they have a constitutional check upon\r\nthe administration, which may thereby be brought into order without\r\nviolence: but where such a power is not lodged in the people,\r\noppression proceeds uncontrouled in its career, till the governed,\r\ntransported into rage, seeks redress in the midst of blood and\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nThe elegant and ingenious Mr. Hume, speaking of the Anglo-Norman\r\ngovernment, says \"princes and ministers were too ignorant to be\r\nthemselves sensible of the advantages attending an equitable\r\nadministration; and there was no established council or assembly\r\nwhich could protect the people, and, by withdrawing supplies,\r\nregularly and peaceably admonish the King of his duty, and ensure\r\nthe execution of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nThus this great man, whose political reflections are so much\r\nadmired, makes this power one of the foundations of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe English history abounds with instances, proving that this is the\r\nproper and successful way to obtain redress of grievances. How often\r\nhave Kings and ministers endeavoured to throw off this legal curb\r\nupon them, by attempting to raise money by a variety of inventions,\r\nunder pretence of law, without having recourse to parliament? And\r\nhow often have they been brought to reason, and peaceably obliged to\r\ndo justice, by the exertion of this constitutional authority of the\r\npeople, vested in their representatives?\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of these colonies have on numberless occasions,\r\nreaped the benefits of this authority lodged in their assemblies.\r\n\r\nIt has been for a long time, and now is, a constant instruction to\r\nall governors, to obtain a permanent support for the officers of\r\ngovernment. But as the author of the administration of the colonies\r\nsays, \"this order of the crown is generally, if not universally,\r\nrejected by the legislatures of the colonies.\"\r\n\r\nThey perfectly know how much their grievances would be regarded,\r\nif they had no other method of engaging attention, than by\r\ncomplaining. Those who rule, are extremely apt to think well of\r\nthe constructions made by themselves, in support of their own\r\npower. These are frequently erroneous and pernicious to those they\r\ngovern--Dry remonstrances, to shew that such constructions are\r\nwrong and oppressive, carry very little weight with them, in the\r\nopinion of persons, who gratify their own inclinations in making\r\nthese constructions. They cannot understand the reasoning that\r\nopposes their power and desire: but let it be made their interest to\r\nunderstand such reasoning--and a wonderful light is instantly thrown\r\non the matter; and then rejected remonstrances become as clear as\r\n\"proof of holy writ.\"[37]\r\n\r\n    [37] Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nThe three most important articles, that our assemblies, or any\r\nlegislatures can provide for, are, first the defence of the\r\nsociety: secondly--the administration of justice: and, thirdly, the\r\nsupport of civil government.\r\n\r\nNothing can properly regulate the expence of making provision for\r\nthese occasions, but the necessities of the society; its abilities;\r\nthe conveniency of the modes of levying money among them; the\r\nmanner in which the laws have been executed; and the conduct of the\r\nofficers of government; all which are circumstances that cannot\r\npossibly be properly known, but by the society itself; or, if they\r\nshould be known, will not, probably, be properly considered, but by\r\nthat society.\r\n\r\nIf money may be raised upon us, by others, without our consent, for\r\nour \"defence,\" those who are the judges in levying it, must also\r\nbe the judges in applying it. Of consequence, the money said to\r\nbe taken from us for our defence, may be employed to our injury.\r\nWe may be chained in by a line of fortifications: obliged to pay\r\nfor building and maintaining them; and be told that they are for\r\nour defence. With what face can we dispute the fact, after having\r\ngranted, that those who apply the money, had a right to levy it;\r\nfor, surely, it is much easier for their wisdom to understand how to\r\napply it in the best manner, than how to levy it in the best manner.\r\nBesides, the right of levying is of infinitely more consequence,\r\nthan that of applying it. The people of England, that would burst\r\nout into fury, if the crown should attempt to levy money by its own\r\nauthority, have assigned to the crown the application of money.\r\n\r\nAs to \"the administration of justice\"--the judges ought, in a well\r\nregulated state, to be equally independant of the legislative\r\npowers. Thus, in England, judges hold their commissions from the\r\ncrown \"during good behaviour;\" and have salaries, suitable to their\r\ndignity, settled on them by parliament. The purity of the courts of\r\nlaw, since this establishment, is a proof of the wisdom with which\r\nit was made.\r\n\r\nBut, in these colonies, how fruitless has been every attempt to have\r\nthe judges appointed during good behaviour; yet whoever considers\r\nthe matter will soon perceive, that such commissions are beyond\r\nall comparison more necessary in these colonies, than they are in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe chief danger to the subject there, arose from the arbitrary\r\ndesigns of the crown; but here, the time may come, when we may\r\nhave to contend with the designs of the crown, and of a mighty\r\nkingdom. What then will be our chance, when the laws of life and\r\ndeath, are to be spoken by judges, totally dependant on that crown\r\nand kingdom--sent over, perhaps, from thence--filled with British\r\nprejudice--and backed by a standing army, supported out of our\r\nown pockets, to \"assert and maintain\" our own \"dependance and\r\nobedience.\"\r\n\r\nBut supposing, that through the extreme lenity that will prevail in\r\nthe government, through all future ages, these colonies never will\r\nbehold any thing like the campaign of chief justice Jeffereys, yet\r\nwhat innumerable acts of injustice may be committed, and how fatally\r\nmay the principles of liberty be sapped by a succession of judges\r\nutterly independant of the people? Before such judges, the supple\r\nwretches, who cheerfully join in avowing sentiments inconsistent\r\nwith freedom, will always meet with smiles: while the honest and\r\nbrave men, who disdain to sacrifice their native land to their own\r\nadvantage, but on every occasion, boldly vindicate her cause, will\r\nconstantly be regarded with frowns.\r\n\r\nThere are two other considerations, relating to this head, that\r\ndeserve the most serious attention.\r\n\r\nBy the late act the officers of the customs are impowered \"to enter\r\ninto any house, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place, in the\r\nBritish colonies or plantations in America, to search for, or seize\r\nprohibited or unaccustomed goods,\" &c. on \"writs granted by the\r\ninferior or supreme court of justice, having jurisdiction within\r\nsuch colony or plantation respectively.\"\r\n\r\nIf we only reflect that the judges of these courts are to be _during\r\npleasure_--that they are to have \"_adequate provision_\" made for\r\nthem, which is to continue during their _complisant behaviour_--that\r\nthey may be stranger to these colonies--what an engine of\r\noppression may this authority be in such hands?\r\n\r\nI am well aware that writs of this kind may be granted at home,\r\nunder the seal of the court of exchequer: But I know also that\r\nthe greatest asserters of the rights of Englishmen, have always\r\nstrenuously contended, that such a power was dangerous to freedom,\r\nand expressly contrary to the common law, which ever regarded a\r\nman's house, as his castle, or a place of perfect security.\r\n\r\nIf such a power is in the least degree dangerous there, it must be\r\nutterly destructive to liberty here.--For the people there have two\r\nsecurities against the undue exercise of this power by the crown,\r\nwhich are wanting with us, if the late act takes place. In the first\r\nplace, if any injustice is done there, the person injured may bring\r\nhis action against the offender, and have it tried by independant\r\njudges, who are[38] no parties in committing the injury. Here he must\r\nhave it tried before dependant judges, being the men who granted the\r\nwrit.\r\n\r\n    [38] The writs for searching houses in England are to be granted\r\n    under the seal of the court of exchequer, according to the\r\n    statute--and that seal is kept by the chancellor of the exchequer. 4\r\n    Inst.\r\n\r\nTo say that the cause is to be tried by a jury can never reconcile\r\nmen, who have any idea of freedom to such a power.--For we know,\r\nthat sheriffs in almost every colony on this continent, are totally\r\ndependant on the crown; and packing of juries has been frequently\r\npracticed even in the capital of the British empire. Even if juries\r\nare well inclined, we have too many instances of the influence of\r\noverbearing unjust judges upon them. The brave and wise men who\r\naccomplished the revolution, thought the independency of judges\r\nessential to freedom.\r\n\r\nThe other security which the people have at home, but which we shall\r\nwant here, is this.--If this power is abused there, the parliament,\r\nthe grand resource of the opprest people, is ready to afford relief.\r\nRedress of grievances must precede grants of money. But what regard\r\ncan we expect to have paid to our assemblies, when they will not\r\nhold even the puny privilege of French parliaments----that of\r\nregistering the edicts, that take away our money, before they are\r\nput in execution.\r\n\r\nThe second consideration above hinted at, is this--There is a\r\nconfusion in our laws that is quite unknown in Great-Britain. As\r\nthis cannot be described in a more clear or exact manner, than has\r\nbeen done by the ingenious author of the history of New-York, I\r\nbeg leave to use his words. \"The state of our laws opens a door\r\nto much controversy. The uncertainty which respect them, renders\r\nproperty precarious, and greatly exposes us to the arbitrary\r\ndecision of unjust judges. The common law of England is generally\r\nreceived, together with such statutes, as were enacted before we\r\nhad a legislature of our own; but our courts exercise a sovereign\r\nauthority, in determining what parts of the common and statute law\r\nought to be extended: For it must be admitted, that the difference\r\nof circumstances necessarily requires us, in some cases, to reject\r\nthe determination of both. In many instances they have also extended\r\neven acts of parliament, passed since we had a distinct legislature,\r\nwhich is greatly adding to our confusion. The practice of our courts\r\nis no less uncertain than the law. Some of the English rules are\r\nadopted, others rejected. Two things therefore seem to be absolutely\r\nnecessary for the public security. First the passing an act for\r\nsettling the extent of the English laws. Secondly, that the courts\r\nordain a general set of rules for the regulation of the practice.\"\r\n\r\nHow easy will it be under this \"state of our laws\" for an artful\r\njudge to act in the most arbitrary manner, and yet cover his conduct\r\nunder specious pretences, and how difficult will it be for the\r\ninjured people to obtain redress, may be readily perceived. We may\r\ntake a voyage of three thousand miles to complain; and after the\r\ntrouble and hazard we have undergone, we may be told, that the\r\ncollection of the revenue and maintenance of the prerogative, must\r\nnot be discouraged.----And if the misbehaviour is so gross as to\r\nadmit of no justification, it may be said that it was an error in\r\njudgment only, arising from the confusion of our laws, and the zeal\r\nof the King's servants to do their duty.\r\n\r\nIf the commissions of judges are during the pleasure of the crown,\r\nyet if their salaries are during the pleasure of the people, there\r\nwill be some check upon their conduct. Few men will consent to draw\r\non themselves the hatred and contempt of those among whom we live,\r\nfor the empty honour of being judges. It is the sordid love of gain\r\nthat tempts men to turn their backs on virtue, and pay their homage\r\nwhere they ought not.\r\n\r\nAs to the third particular, the \"support of civil government,\" few\r\nwords will be sufficient. Every man of the least understanding\r\nmust know, that the executive power may be exercised in a manner\r\nso disagreeable and harassing to the people, that it is absolutely\r\nrequisite, they should be enabled by the gentlest method which\r\nhuman policy has yet been ingenious enough to invent, that is by\r\nthe shutting their hands, to \"admonish\" (as Mr. Hume says) certain\r\npersons \"of their duty.\"\r\n\r\nWhat shall we now think, when, upon looking into the late act, we\r\nfind the assemblies of these provinces thereby stript of their\r\nauthority on these several heads? The declared intention of that act\r\nis, \"that a revenue should be raised in his Majesty's dominions\r\nin America, for making a more certain and adequate provision for\r\ndefraying the charge of the administration of justice, and the\r\nsupport of civil government, in such provinces where it shall be\r\nfound necessary; and towards further defraying the expences of\r\ndefending, protecting, and securing the said dominions,\" &c.\r\n\r\nLet the reader pause here one moment, and reflect--whether the\r\ncolony in which he lives, has not made such \"certain and adequate\r\nprovisions\" for these purposes, as is by the colony judged suitable\r\nto its abilities, and all other circumstances. Then let him\r\nreflect--whether, if this act takes place, money is not to be raised\r\non that colony without its consent to make provision for these\r\npurposes, which it does not judge to be suitable to its abilities,\r\nand all other circumstances. Lastly, let him reflect--whether\r\nthe people of that country are not in a state of the most abject\r\nslavery, whose property may be taken from them under the notion\r\nof right, when they have refused to give it. For my part, I think\r\nI have good reason for vindicating the honour of the assemblies\r\non this continent, by publicly asserting, that they have made as\r\n\"certain and adequate provision\" for the purposes above-mentioned,\r\nas they ought to have made; and that it should not be presumed,\r\nthat they will not do it hereafter. Why then should these most\r\nimportant truths be wrested out of their hands? Why should they not\r\nnow be permitted to enjoy that authority, which they have exercised\r\nfrom the first settlement of these colonies? Why should they be\r\nscandalized by this innovation, when their respective provinces\r\nare now, and will be for several years, labouring under loads of\r\ndebts imposed on them for the very purposes now spoken of? Why\r\nshould the inhabitants of all these colonies be with the utmost\r\nindignity treated, as a herd of despicable wretches, so utterly void\r\nof common sense, that they will not even make \"adequate provision\"\r\nfor the \"administration of justice\" and \"the support of civil\r\ngovernment\" among them, for their \"own defence\"--though without\r\nsuch \"provision\" every people must inevitably be overwhelmed with\r\nanarchy and destruction? Is it possible to form an idea of slavery\r\nmore complete, more miserable, more disgraceful, than that of a\r\npeople, where justice is administered, government exercised, and\r\na standing army maintained, at the expence of the people, and yet\r\nwithout the least dependance upon them? If we can find no relief\r\nfrom this infamous situation, let Mr. Grenville set his fertile\r\nfancy again to work, and as by one exertion of it, he has stripped\r\nus of our property and liberty, let him by another deprive us of our\r\nunderstanding too, that unconscious of what we have been or are,\r\nand ungoaded by tormenting reflections, we may tamely bow down our\r\nnecks with all the stupid serenity of servitude, to any drudgery,\r\nwhich our lords and masters may please to command.--\r\n\r\nWhen the \"charges of the administration of justice,\"--\"the support\r\nof civil government;\"--and \"the expences of defending protecting and\r\nsecuring\" us, are provided for, I should be glad to know upon what\r\noccasion the crown will ever call our assemblies together. Some few\r\nof them may meet of their own accord, by virtue of their charters:\r\nBut what will they have to do when they are met? To what shadows\r\nwill they be reduced? The men, whose deliberations heretofore had an\r\ninfluence on every matter relating to the liberty and happiness of\r\nthemselves and their constituents, and whose authority in domestic\r\naffairs, at least, might well be compared to that of Roman senators,\r\nwill now find their deliberations of no more consequence than those\r\nof constables.--They may perhaps be allowed to make laws for yoking\r\nof hogs, or pounding of stray cattle. Their influence will hardly\r\nbe permitted to extend so high as the keeping roads in repair, as\r\nthat business may more properly be executed by those who receive the\r\npublic cash.\r\n\r\nOne most memorable example in history is so applicable to the\r\npoint now insisted on, that it will form a just conclusion of the\r\nobservations that have been made.\r\n\r\nSpain was once free. Their _Cortes_ resembled our parliament. No\r\nmoney could be raised on the subject, without their consent. One\r\nof their Kings having received a grant from them to maintain a war\r\nagainst the Moors, desired, that if the sum which they had given,\r\nshould not be sufficient, he might be allowed for that emergency\r\nonly, to have more money, without assembling the _Cortes_. The\r\nrequest was violently opposed by the best and wisest men in the\r\nassembly. It was however, complied with by the votes of a majority;\r\nand this single concession was a precedent for other concessions\r\nof the like kinds, until, at last, the crown obtained a general\r\npower for raising money in cases of necessity. From that period the\r\n_Cortes_ ceased to be useful, and the people ceased to be free.\r\n\r\n    _Venienti occurrite morbo._\r\n    Oppose a disease at its beginning.--\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Countrymen_,\r\n\r\nThe consequences, mentioned in the last letter, will not be the\r\nutmost limits of our misery and infamy. We feel too sensibly that\r\nany[39] ministerial measures, relating to these colonies, are soon\r\ncarried successfully thro' the parliament. Certain prejudices\r\noperate there so strongly against us, that it might justly be\r\nquestioned, whether all the provinces united, will ever be able\r\neffectually to call to an account, before the parliament, any\r\nminister who shall abuse the power by the late act given to the\r\ncrown in America. He may divide the spoils torn from us, in\r\nwhat manner he pleases; and we shall have no way of making him\r\nresponsible. If he should order, that every Governor, should have a\r\nyearly salary of 5000_l._ sterling, every chief justice of 3000_l._\r\nevery inferior officer in proportion; and should then reward the\r\nmost profligate, ignorant, or needy dependants on himself, or his\r\nfriends with places of the greatest trust because they were of the\r\ngreatest profit, this would be called an arrangement in consequence\r\nof the \"adequate provision for defraying the charge of the\r\nadministration of justice, and the support of the civil government.\"\r\nAnd if the taxes should prove at any time insufficient to answer all\r\nthe expences of the numberless offices, which ministers may please\r\nto create, surely the house of Commons would be too \"modest\" to\r\ncontradict a minister who should tell them, it was become necessary\r\nto lay a new tax upon the colonies, for the laudable purpose of\r\n\"defraying the charges of the administration of justice, and the\r\nsupport of civil government\" among them. Thus in fact we shall be\r\ntaxed by ministers.[40]\r\n\r\n    [39] The gentleman must not wonder he was not contradicted,\r\n    when, as the minister, he asserted the right of parliament to\r\n    tax America. I know not how it is, but there is a modesty in\r\n    this house, which does not chuse to contradict a minister. I\r\n    wish gentlemen would get the better of that modesty. If they\r\n    do not, perhaps the collective body may begin to abate of its\r\n    respect for the representative.\r\n\r\n                                  Mr. Pitt's speech.\r\n\r\n    [40] \"Within this act, (_statute de tallagio non concedendo_)\r\n    are all new offices erected with new fees, or old offices with\r\n    new fees, for that is a tallage put upon the subject, which\r\n    cannot be done without common assent by act of parliament.\"\r\n\r\n                                        2 Inst. 533.\r\n\r\nWe may perceive, from the example of Ireland, how eager ministers\r\nare to seize upon any settled revenue, and apply it in supporting\r\ntheir own power.----Happy are the men, and happy are the people,\r\nwho grow wise by the misfortune of others. Earnestly, my dear\r\ncountrymen, do I beseech the author of all good gifts, that you may\r\ngrow wise in this manner: And, if I may be allowed to take the\r\nliberty, I beg leave to recommend to you in general, as the best\r\nmethod of obtaining wisdom, diligently to study the histories of\r\nother countries. You will there find all the arts, that can possibly\r\nbe practiced by cunning rulers, or false patriots among yourselves,\r\nso fully delineated, that changing names, the account would serve\r\nfor your own times.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty well known on this continent, that Ireland has,\r\nwith a regular consistence of injustice, been cruelly treated by\r\nministers in the article of pensions; but there are some alarming\r\ncircumstances relating to that subject, which I wish to have better\r\nknown among us.\r\n\r\n[41]The revenue of the crown there, arises principally from the\r\nexcise granted \"for pay of the army, and defraying other public\r\ncharges in defence and preservation of the kingdom\"--from the\r\ntonnage and additional poundage granted \"for protecting the trade\r\nof the kingdom at sea, and augmenting the public revenue\" from the\r\nhearth-money granted, as a \"public revenue for public charges and\r\nexpences.\" There are some other branches of the revenue, concerning\r\nwhich there is not any express appropriation of them for public\r\nservice, but which were plainly so intended.\r\n\r\n    [41] An enquiry into the legality of the pensions on the Irish\r\n    establishment, by Alexander M'Auley, Esq; one of the King's\r\n    Council, &c.\r\n\r\nOf these branches of the revenue, the crown is only a trustee for\r\nthe public. They are unalienable; they are inapplicable to any other\r\npurposes, but those for which they were established; and therefore\r\nare not legally chargeable with pensions.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of revenue, which is a private revenue. This\r\nis not limited to any public uses; but the crown has the same\r\nproperty in it, that any person has in his estate. This does not\r\namount at the most to fifteen thousand pounds a year, probably not\r\nto seven; and it is the only revenue that can legally be charged\r\nwith pensions. If ministers were accustomed to regard the rights\r\nor happiness of the people, the pensions in Ireland would not\r\nexceed the sum just mentioned: but long since have they exceeded\r\nthat limit, and in December, 1765, a motion was made in the House\r\nof Commons in that kingdom, to address his Majesty, on the great\r\nincrease of pensions on the Irish establishment, amounting to the\r\nsum of £.158,685 in the last two years.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to gloss over these gross incroachments,\r\nby this specious argument,--\"That expending a competent part of\r\nthe public revenue in pensions, from a principle of charity or\r\ngenerosity, adds to the dignity of the crown, and is, therefore,\r\nuseful to the public.\" To give this argument any weight, it must\r\nappear that the pensions proceed from \"charity or generosity\"\r\nonly--And that it \"adds to the dignity of the crown\" to act directly\r\ncontrary to law.\r\n\r\nFrom this conduct towards Ireland, in open violation of law, we may\r\neasily foresee what we may expect, when a minister will have the\r\nwhole revenue of America, in his own hands, to be disposed of at his\r\nown pleasure. For all the monies raised by the late act are to be\r\n\"applied, by virtue of warrants under the sign manual, countersigned\r\nby the high treasurer, or any three of the commissioners of the\r\ntreasury.\" The \"residue\" indeed, is to be paid \"into the receipt\r\nof the exchequer, and to be disposed of by parliament.\" So that a\r\nminister will have nothing to do but to take care that there shall\r\nbe no \"residue,\" and he is superior to all controul.\r\n\r\nBesides the burden of pensions in Ireland, which have enormously\r\nencreased within these few years, almost all the offices, in that\r\npoor kingdom, have, since the commencement of the present century,\r\nand now are bestowed upon strangers. For though the merit of those\r\nborn there justly raises them to places of high trust, when they go\r\nabroad, as all Europe can witness, yet he is an uncommonly lucky\r\nIrishman, who can get a good post in his native country.\r\n\r\nWhen I consider the [42]manner in which that island has been\r\nuniformly depressed for so many years past, with this pernicious\r\nparticularity of their parliament continuing[43] as long as the\r\ncrown pleases, I am astonished to observe such a love of liberty\r\nstill animating that loyal and generous nation; and nothing can\r\nraise higher my idea of the integrity and public spirit of the\r\npeople[44] who have preserved the sacred fire of freedom from being\r\nextinguished though the altar, on which it burned, has been thrown\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n    [42] In Charles II's time, the House of Commons, influenced\r\n    by some factious demagogues, were resolved to prohibit the\r\n    importation of Irish cattle into England. Among other arguments\r\n    in favour of Ireland, it was insisted \"That by cutting off\r\n    almost entirely the trade between the kingdoms, all the natural\r\n    bands of union were dissolved, and nothing remained to keep the\r\n    Irish in their duty, but force and violence.\r\n\r\n    \"The King (says Mr. Hume in his History of England) was so\r\n    convinced of the justice of these reasons, that he used all\r\n    his interest to oppose the bill, and he openly declared, that\r\n    he could not give his assent to it with a safe conscience. But\r\n    the Commons were resolute in their purpose. And the spirit of\r\n    tyranny, of which nations are as susceptible as individuals,\r\n    had animated the English extremely to exert their superiority\r\n    over their dependant state. No affair could be conducted with\r\n    greater violence that this, by the Commons. They even went so\r\n    far in the preamble of the bill, as to declare the importation\r\n    of Irish cattle to be a nuisance. By this expression they\r\n    gave scope to their passion, and at the same time, barred the\r\n    King's prerogative, by which he might think himself intitled to\r\n    dispense with a law so full of injustice and bad policy. The\r\n    lords expunged the word, but as the King was sensible that no\r\n    supply would be given by the Commons, unless they were gratified\r\n    in all their prejudices, he was obliged both to employ his\r\n    interest with the Peers to make the bill pass, and to give the\r\n    Royal assent to it. He could not however forbear expressing his\r\n    displeasure, at the jealousy entertained against him, and at\r\n    the intention which the Commons discovered of retrenching his\r\n    prerogative.\"\r\n\r\n    This law brought great distress for sometime upon Ireland,\r\n    but it occasioned their applying with great industry to\r\n    manufactures, and has proved, in the issue, beneficial to that\r\n    kingdom.\r\n\r\n    Perhaps the same reason occasioned the \"barring the King's\r\n    prerogative\" in the late act suspending the legislation of\r\n    New-York.\r\n\r\n    This we may be assured of, that we are as dear to his Majesty,\r\n    as the people of Great-Britain are. We are his subjects as well\r\n    as they, and as faithful subjects; and his Majesty has given too\r\n    many, too constant proofs of his piety and virtue, for any man,\r\n    to think it possible, that such a Prince can make any unjust\r\n    distinction between such subjects. It makes no difference to\r\n    his Majesty, whether supplies are raised in Great-Britain, or\r\n    America: but it makes some difference, to the Commons of that\r\n    kingdom.\r\n\r\n    To speak plainly as becomes an honest man on such important\r\n    occasions, all our misfortunes are owing to a lust of power\r\n    in men of abilities and influence. This prompts them to seek\r\n    popularity, by expedients profitable to themselves, though ever\r\n    so destructive to their country.\r\n\r\n    Such is the accursed nature of lawless ambition, and yet--what\r\n    heart but melts at the thought?--Such false detestable patriots\r\n    in every nation have led their blind confiding country, shouting\r\n    their applauses, into the jaws of shame and ruin. May the wisdom\r\n    and goodness of the people of Great-Britain, save them from the\r\n    usual fate of nations.\r\n\r\n    [43] The last Irish parliament continued thirty-three years,\r\n    that is during all the late reign. The present parliament there,\r\n    has continued from the beginning of this reign; and probably\r\n    will continue to the end.\r\n\r\n    [44] I am informed, that within these few years, a petition was\r\n    presented to the House of Commons in Great-Britain, setting\r\n    forth, \"that herrings were imported into Ireland, from some\r\n    foreign parts of the north so cheap, as to discourage the\r\n    British herring fishery, and therefore praying, that some remedy\r\n    might be applied in that behalf by parliament\"--\"That, upon this\r\n    petition, the House resolved to impose a duty of two shillings\r\n    sterling on every barrel of foreign herrings imported into\r\n    Ireland, but afterwards dropt the affair, for fear of engaging\r\n    in a dispute with Ireland about the right of taxing her.\"\r\n\r\n    So much higher was the opinion, which the House entertained of\r\n    the spirit of Ireland, than of that of these colonies.\r\n\r\n    I find in the last English papers, that the resolution and\r\n    firmness with which the people of that kingdom have lately\r\n    asserted their freedom, have been so alarming in Great-Britain,\r\n    that the Lord Lieutenant in his speech on the 20th of last\r\n    October, \"recommended\" to the parliament, \"that such provision\r\n    may be made for securing the judges in the enjoyment of their\r\n    offices and appointments during their good behaviour, as shall\r\n    be thought most expedient.\"\r\n\r\n    What an important concession is thus obtained by making demands\r\n    becoming freemen, with a courage and perseverance becoming\r\n    freemen.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner shall we unquestionably be treated, as soon as\r\nthe late taxes, laid upon us, shall make posts in the \"government,\"\r\nand the \"administration of justice,\" here, worth the attention of\r\npersons of influence in Great Britain. We know enough already to\r\nsatisfy us of this truth. But this will not be the worst part of our\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe principals in all great offices will reside in England, make\r\nsome paltry allowance to deputies for doing the business here. Let\r\nany man consider what an exhausting drain this must be upon us, when\r\nministers are possessed of the power of affixing what salaries\r\nthey please to posts, and he must be convinced how destructive the\r\nlate act must be. The injured kingdom, lately mentioned, can tell\r\nus the mischiefs of absentees; and we may perceive already the same\r\ndisposition taking place with us. The government of New York has\r\nbeen exercised by a deputy. That of Virginia is now held so; and\r\nwe know of a number of secretaryships, collectorships, and other\r\noffices held in the same manner.\r\n\r\nTrue it is, that if the people of Great-Britain were not too much\r\nblinded by the passions, that have been artfully excited in their\r\nbreasts, against their dutiful children, the colonists, these\r\nconsiderations would be nearly as alarming to them as to us. The\r\ninfluence of the crown was thought, by wise men many years ago, too\r\ngreat, by reason of the multitude of pensions and places bestowed by\r\nit; these have vastly increased since[45] and perhaps it would be no\r\ndifficult matter to prove that the people have decreased.\r\n\r\n    [45] One of the reasons urged by that great and honest statesman,\r\n    Sir William Temple, to Charles II. in his famous remonstrance to\r\n    dissuade him from aiming at arbitrary power, was, the \"King had\r\n    few offices to bestow.\"\r\n\r\n                            Hume's Hist. of England.\r\n\r\n    \"Though the wings of prerogative have been clipt, the influence of\r\n    the crown is greater than ever it was in any period of our history.\r\n    For when we consider in how many burroughs the government has\r\n    the voters at command, when we consider the vast body of persons\r\n    employed in the collection of the revenue in every part of the\r\n    kingdom, the inconceivable number of placemen, and candidates for\r\n    places in the customs, in the excise, in the post-office, in the\r\n    dock-yards, in the ordnance, in the salt-office, in the stamps,\r\n    in the navy and victualling offices, and in a variety of other\r\n    departments; when we consider again the extensive influence of the\r\n    money corporations, subscription jobbers, and contractors: the\r\n    endless dependance created by the obligations conferred on the\r\n    bulk of the gentlemen's families throughout the kingdom, who have\r\n    relations preferred in our navy and numerous standing army; when, I\r\n    say, we consider how wide, how binding, a dependance on the crown\r\n    is created by the above enumerated particulars; and the great, the\r\n    enormous weight and influence which the crown derives from this\r\n    extensive dependance upon its favour and power; any lord in waiting,\r\n    any lord of the bedchamber, any man may be appointed minister.\"\r\n\r\n    \"A doctrine to this effect is said to have been the advice of L----\r\n    H----.\"\r\n\r\n                                   Late News papers.\r\n\r\nSurely, therefore, those who wish the welfare of their country,\r\nought seriously to reflect what may be the consequence of such a new\r\ncreation of offices, in the disposal of the crown. The army, the\r\nadministration of justice, and the civil government here, with such\r\nsalaries as the crown shall please to annex, will extend ministerial\r\ninfluence, as much beyond its former bounds, as the late war did the\r\nBritish dominions.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the people of Great-Britain may think on this occasion,\r\nI hope the people of these colonies will unanimously join in\r\nthis sentiment, that the late act of parliament is injurious to\r\ntheir liberty; and that this sentiment will unite them in a firm\r\nopposition to it, in the same manner as the dread of the Stamp-act\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nSome persons may imagine the sums to be raised by it, are but small,\r\nand therefore may be inclined to acquiesce under it. A conduct\r\nmore dangerous to freedom, as before has been observed, can never\r\nbe adopted. Nothing is wanted at home but a precedent, the force\r\nof which shall be established, by the tacit submission of the\r\ncolonies. With what zeal was the statute erecting the post-office,\r\nand another relating to the recovery of debts in America, urged and\r\ntortured, as precedents in the support of the Stamp-act, though\r\nwholly inapplicable. If the parliament succeeds in this attempt,\r\nother statutes will impose other duties. Instead of taxing ourselves\r\nas we have been accustomed to do from the first settlement of these\r\nprovinces; all our useful taxes will be converted into parliamentary\r\ntaxes on our importations; and thus the parliament will levy upon\r\nus such sums of money as they chuse to take, without any other\r\nlimitation than their pleasure.\r\n\r\nWe know how much labour and care have been bestowed by these\r\ncolonies, in laying taxes in such a manner, that they should be\r\nmost easy to the people, by being laid on the proper articles; most\r\nequal, by being proportioned to every man's circumstances; and\r\ncheapest by the method directed for collecting them.\r\n\r\nBut parliamentary taxes will be laid on us without any\r\nconsideration, whether there is any eassier mode. The only point\r\nregarded will be, the certainty of levying the taxes, and not the\r\nconvenience of the people, on whom they are to be levied, and\r\ntherefore all statutes on this head will be such as will be most\r\nlikely, according to the favourite phrase, \"to execute themselves.\"\r\n\r\nTaxes in every free state have been, and ought to be as exactly\r\nproportioned, as is possible, to the abilities of those who are to\r\npay them. They cannot otherwise be just. Even a Hottentot could\r\ncomprehend the unreasonableness, of making a poor man pay as much\r\nfor defending the property of a rich man, as the rich man pays\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nLet any person look into the late act of parliament, and he will\r\nimmediately perceive, that the immense estates of Lord Fairfax, Lord\r\nBaltimore,[46] and our proprietors, which are amongst \"his Majesty's\r\nother dominions\" to be \"defended, protected and secured\" by that act\r\nwill not pay a single farthing of the duties thereby imposed, except\r\nLord Fairfax wants some of his windows glazed. Lord Baltimore, and\r\nour proprietors are quite secure, as they live in England.\r\n\r\n    [46] The people of Maryland and Pennsylvania have been engaged\r\n    in the warmest disputes, in order to obtain an equal and just\r\n    taxation of their proprietors estates; but the late act does\r\n    more for these proprietors than they themselves would venture to\r\n    demand. It totally exempts them from taxation.\r\n\r\nI mention these particular cases as striking instances, how far the\r\nlate act is a deviation from that principle of justice, which has so\r\nconstantly distinguished our own laws on this continent.\r\n\r\nThe third consideration with our continental assemblies in laying\r\ntaxes has been the method of collecting them. This has been done by\r\na few officers under the inspection of the respective assemblies,\r\nwith moderate allowances. No more was raised from the subject, than\r\nwas used for the intended purposes. But by the late act, a minister\r\nmay appoint as many officers as he pleases for collecting the taxes;\r\nmay assign them what salaries he thinks \"adequate\" and they are to\r\nbe subject to no inspection but his own.\r\n\r\nIn short, if the late act of parliament takes effect, these colonies\r\nmust dwindle down into \"common corporations,\" as their enemies in\r\nthe debates concerning the repeal of the Stamp-act, strenuously\r\ninsisted they were: and it is not improbable, that some future\r\nhistorians will thus record our fall.\r\n\r\n\"The eighth year of this reign was distinguished by a very memorable\r\nevent, the American colonies then submitting for the first time, to\r\nbe taxed by the British parliament. An attempt of this kind had been\r\nmade two years before, but was defeated by the vigorous exertions\r\nof the several provinces in defence of their liberties. Their\r\nbehaviour on that occasion rendered their name very celebrated for\r\na short time all over Europe; all states being extremely attentive\r\nto a dispute between Great-Britain and so considerable a part of\r\nher dominions. For as she was thought to be grown too powerful by\r\nthe successful conclusion of the late war she had been engaged\r\nin, it was hoped by many, that as it had happened before to other\r\nkingdoms, civil discords would afford opportunities of revenging\r\nall the injuries supposed to be received from her. However the\r\ncause of dissention was removed by a repeal of the statute, that\r\nhad given offense. This affair rendered the submissive conduct of\r\nthe colonies so soon after, the more extraordinary; there being no\r\ndifference between the modes of taxation which they opposed, and\r\nthat to which they submitted, but this, that by the first, they were\r\nto be continually reminded that they were taxed, by certain marks\r\nstampt on every piece of paper or parchment, they used. The authors\r\nof that statute triumphed greatly on this conduct of the colonies,\r\nand insisted that if the people of Great-Britain, had persisted\r\nin enforcing it, the Americans would have been in a few months so\r\nfatigued with the efforts of patriotism, that they would quickly\r\nhave yielded obedience.\r\n\r\n\"Certain it is, that though they had before their eyes so many\r\nillustrious examples in their mother country, of the constant\r\nsuccess attending firmness and perseverance in opposition to\r\ndangerous encroachments on liberty, yet they quietly gave up a\r\npoint of the last importance. From thence the decline of their\r\nfreedom began, and its decay was extremely rapid; for as money\r\nwas always raised upon them by the parliament, their assemblies\r\ngrew immediately useless and in a short time contemptible; and\r\nin less than one hundred years, the people sunk down into that\r\ntameness and supineness of spirit by which they still continue to be\r\ndistinguished.\"\r\n\r\n     _Et majores vestros et posteros cogitate._\r\n\r\n     Remember your ancestors and your posterity.\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Beloved Countrymen,_\r\n\r\nI have several times, in the course of these letters, mentioned the\r\nlate act of parliament, as being the foundation of future measures\r\ninjurious to these colonies; and the belief of this truth I wish to\r\nprevail, because I think it necessary to our safety.\r\n\r\nA perpetual jealousy respecting liberty, is absolutely requisite\r\nin all free states. The very texture of their constitution, in\r\nmixt governments, demands it. For the cautions with which power is\r\ndistributed among the several orders, imply, that each has that\r\nshare which is proper for the general welfare, and therefore, that\r\nany further imposition mull be pernicious. [47]Machiavel employs\r\na whole chapter in his discourses, to prove that a state, to be\r\nlong lived, must be frequently corrected, and reduced to its first\r\nprinciples. But of all states that have existed, there never was\r\nany, in which this jealousy could be more proper than in these\r\ncolonies. For the government here is not only mixt, but dependant,\r\nwhich circumstance occasions a peculiarity in its form, of a very\r\ndelicate nature.\r\n\r\n    [47] Machiavel's discourses. Book 3, chap. 1.\r\n\r\nTwo reasons induce me to desire, that this spirit of apprehension\r\nmay be always kept up among us, in its utmost vigilance. The first\r\nis this, that as the happiness of these provinces indubitably\r\nconsists in their connection with Great-Britain, any separation\r\nbetween them is less likely to be occasioned by civil discords, if\r\nevery disgusting measure is opposed singly, and while it is new: for\r\nin this manner of proceeding, every such measure is most likely to\r\nbe rectified. On the other hand, oppressions and dissatisfactions\r\nbeing permitted to accumulate--if ever the governed throw off the\r\nload, they will do more. A people does not reform with moderation.\r\nThe rights of the subject therefore cannot be too often considered,\r\nexplained, or asserted: and whoever attempts to do this, shews\r\nhimself, whatever may be the rash and peevish reflections of\r\npretended wisdom, and pretended duty, a friend to those who\r\ninjudiciously exercise their power, as well as to them, over whom it\r\nis so exercised.\r\n\r\nHad all the points of prerogative claimed by Charles I. been\r\nseparately contested and settled in preceding reigns, his fate\r\nwould in all probability have been very different, and the people\r\nwould have been content with that liberty which is compatible with\r\nregal authority. But[48] he thought, it would be as dangerous for\r\nhim to give up the powers which at any time had been by usurpation\r\nexercised by the crown, as those that were legally vested in it.\r\nThis produced an equal excess on the part of the people. For when\r\ntheir passions were excited by multiplied grievances, they thought\r\nit would be as dangerous for them, to allow the powers that were\r\nlegally vested in the crown, as those which at any time had been by\r\nusurpation exercised by it. Acts, that might by themselves have been\r\nupon many considerations excused or extenuated, derived a contagious\r\nmalignancy and odium from other acts, with which they were\r\nconnected. They were not regarded according to the simple force of\r\neach, but as parts of a system of oppression. Every one therefore,\r\nhowever small in itself, being alarming, as an additional evidence\r\nof tyrannical designs. It was in vain for prudent and moderate men\r\nto insist, that there was no necessity to abolish royalty. Nothing\r\nless than the utter destruction of monarchy, could satisfy those\r\nwho had suffered, and thought they had reason to believe, they\r\nalways should suffer under it.\r\n\r\n    [48] The author is sensible that this is putting the gentlest\r\n    construction on Charles' conduct; and that is one reason why he\r\n    chuses it. Allowance ought to be made for the errors of those men,\r\n    who are acknowledged to have been possessed of many virtues. The\r\n    education of that unhappy Prince, and his confidence in men not so\r\n    good and wise as himself, had probably filled him with mistaken\r\n    notions of his own authority, and of the consequences that would\r\n    attend concessions of any kind to a people, who were represented\r\n    to him as aiming at too much power.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of these mutual distrusts are well known: But there\r\nis no other people mentioned in history, that I recollect, who have\r\nbeen so constantly watchful of their liberty, and so successful in\r\ntheir struggles for it, as the English. This consideration leads me\r\nto the second reason, why I \"desire that the spirit of apprehension\r\nmay be always kept up among us in its utmost vigilance.\"\r\n\r\nThe first principles of government are to be looked for in human\r\nnature. Some of the best writers have asserted, and it seems with\r\ngood reason, that \"government is founded on [49]opinion.\"\r\n\r\n    [49] \"Opinion is of two kinds, viz. opinion of interest, and\r\n    opinion of right. By opinion of interest, I chiefly understand,\r\n    the sense of public advantage which is reaped from government;\r\n    together with the persuasion, that the particular government\r\n    which is established, is equally advantageous with any other,\r\n    that could be easily settled.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Right is of two kinds, right to power, and right to property.\r\n    What prevalence opinion of the first kind has over mankind may\r\n    easily be understood, by observing the attachment which all\r\n    nations have to their ancient government, and even to those\r\n    names which have had the sanction of antiquity. Antiquity always\r\n    begets the opinion of right.\" \"It is sufficiently understood,\r\n    that the opinion of right to property, is of the greatest moment\r\n    in all matters of government.\"\r\n\r\n                                      Hume's Essays.\r\n\r\nCustom undoubtedly has a mighty force in producing opinion, and\r\nreigns in nothing more arbitrarily than in public affairs. It\r\ngradually reconciles us to objects even of dread and detestation;\r\nand I cannot but think these lines of Mr. Pope, as applicable to\r\nvice in politics, as to vice in ethics.\r\n\r\n    'Vice is a monster of so horrid mien,\r\n    As to be hated, needs but to be seen;\r\n    Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,\r\n    We first endure, then pity, then embrace.'\r\n\r\nWhen an act injurious to freedom has been once done, and the\r\npeople bear it, the repetition of it is most likely to meet\r\nwith submission. For as the mischief of the one was found to be\r\ntolerable, they will hope that of the second will prove so too;\r\nand they will not regard the infamy of the last, because they are\r\nstained with that of the first.\r\n\r\nIndeed, nations in general, are not apt to think until they feel;\r\nand therefore nations in general have lost their liberty: For as\r\nviolations of the rights of the governed, are commonly not only\r\nspecious,[50] but small at the beginning, they spread over the\r\nmultitude in such a manner, as to touch individuals but slightly.\r\nThus they are disregarded.[51] The power or profit that arises\r\nfrom these violations, centering in few persons, is to them\r\nconsiderable. For this reason the governors having in view their\r\nparticular purposes, successively preserve an uniformity of conduct\r\nfor attaining them. They regularly increase and multiply the first\r\ninjuries, till at length the inattentive people are compelled to\r\nperceive the heaviness of their burdens.--They begin to complain and\r\nenquire--but too late.--They find their oppressors so strengthened\r\nby success, and themselves so entangled in examples of express\r\nauthority on the part of their rulers, and of tacit recognition\r\non their own part, that they are quite confounded: For millions\r\nentertain no other idea of the legality of power, than that it is\r\nfounded on the exercise of power. They voluntarily fatten their\r\nchains, by adopting a pusillanimous opinion, \"that there will be\r\ntoo much danger in attempting a remedy,\" or another opinion no less\r\nfatal, \"that the government has a right to treat them as it does.\"\r\nThey then seek a wretched relief for their minds, by persuading\r\nthemselves, that to yield their obedience is to discharge their\r\nduty. The deplorable poverty of spirit, that prostrates all the\r\ndignity bestowed by divine providence on our nature--of course\r\nsucceeds.\r\n\r\n    [50] _Omnia mala exampla ex bonis initiis orta sunt._\r\n\r\n                          Sallust.

S. 50.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [51] \"The Republic is always attacked with greater vigour than it\r\n    is defended, for the audacious and profligate, prompted by their\r\n    natural enmity to it, are easily impelled to act upon the least\r\n    nod of their leaders; whereas the honest, I know not why, are\r\n    generally slow and unwilling to stir; and neglecting always the\r\n    beginnings of things, are never roused to exert themselves, but\r\n    by the last necessity; so that through irresolution and delay,\r\n    when they would be glad to compound at last for their quiet, at\r\n    the expence even of their honour, they commonly lose them both.\"\r\n\r\n                         Cicero's Orat. for Sextius.\r\n\r\n    Such were the sentiments of this great and excellent man whose vast\r\n    abilities, and the calamities of the time in which he lived, enabled\r\n    him, by mournful experience, to form a just judgement on the conduct\r\n    of the friends and enemies of liberty.\r\n\r\nFrom these reflections I conclude, that every free State should\r\nincessantly watch, and instantly take alarm on any condition being\r\nmade to the power exercised over them, innumerable instances might\r\nbe produced to shew, from what slight beginnings the most extensive\r\nconsequences have flowed: but I shall select two only from the\r\nhistory of England.\r\n\r\nHenry the seventh was the first monarch of that kingdom, who\r\nestablished a standing body of armed men. This was a band of\r\n50 archers, called yeomen of the guard: And this institution,\r\nnotwithstanding the smallness of the number, was, to prevent\r\ndiscontent, [52]\"disguised under the pretence of majesty and\r\ngrandeur.\" In 1684, the standing forces were so much augmented, that\r\nRapin says--\"The King, in order to make his people fully sensible\r\nof their new slavery, affected to muster his troops, which amounted\r\nto 4000 well armed and disciplined men.\" I think our army, at this\r\ntime, consists of more than seventy regiments.\r\n\r\n    [52] Rapin's History of England.\r\n\r\nThe method of taxing by excise was first introduced amidst the\r\nconvulsions of civil wars. Extreme necessity was pretended, and\r\nits short continuance promised. After the restoration, an excise\r\nupon beer, ale and other liquors, was granted to the[53] King, one\r\nhalf in fee, the other for life, as an equivalent for the court of\r\nwards. Upon James the second's accession, the parliament[54] gave\r\nhim the first excise, with an additional duty on wine, tobacco,\r\nand some other things. Since the revolution it has been extended\r\nto salt, candles, leather, hides, hops, soap, paper, paste-board,\r\nmill-boards, scaleboards, vellum, parchment, starch, silks,\r\ncalicoes, linens, stuffs, printed, stained, &c. wire, wrought plate,\r\ncoffee, tea, chocolate, &c.\r\n\r\n    [53] 12 Car. II. Chap. 23, and 24.\r\n\r\n    [54] James II. Chap. 1, and 4.\r\n\r\nThus a standing army and excise have, from the first slender\r\norigins, tho' always hated, always feared, always opposed, at length\r\nswelled up to their vast present bulk.\r\n\r\nThese facts are sufficient to support what I have said. 'Tis true\r\nthat all the mischiefs apprehended by our ancestors from a standing\r\narmy and excise, have not yet happened: but it does not follow\r\nfrom thence, that they will not happen. The inside of a house may\r\ncatch fire, and the most valuable apartments be ruined, before the\r\nflames burst out. The question in these cases is not, what evil has\r\nactually attended particular measures--but what evil, in the nature\r\nof things, is likely to attend them. Certain circumstances may for\r\nsome time delay effects, that were reasonably expected, and that\r\nmust ensue. There was a long period, after the Romans had prorogued\r\nthe command to [55]Q. Publilius Philo, before that example destroyed\r\ntheir liberty. All our kings, from the revolution to the present\r\nreign have been foreigners. Their ministers generally continued but\r\na short time in authority;[56] and they themselves were mild and\r\nvirtuous princes.\r\n\r\n    [55] In the year of the city 428, \"_Duo singularia hæc ei viro\r\n    primum contigere; prorogatio imperii non ame in ullo fucto et acta\r\n    honore triumphus_.\" Liv. B. 8. Chap. 23. 26.\r\n\r\n    \"Had the rest of the Roman citizens imitated the example of L.\r\n    Quintus, who refused to have his consulship continued to him,\r\n    they had never admitted that custom of proroguing magistrates,\r\n    and then the prolongation of their commands, the army had never\r\n    been introduced, which very thing was at length the ruin of that\r\n    commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\n             Machiavel's discourses, B. 3. Chap. 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [56] I don't know but it may be said with a good deal of\r\n    reason, that a quick rotation of ministers is very desirable in\r\n    Great-Britain. A minister there has a vast store of materials\r\n    to work with. Long administrations are rather favourable to the\r\n    reputation of a people abroad, than to their liberty.\r\n\r\nA bold, ambitious Prince, possessed of great abilities, firmly fixed\r\nin the throne by descent, served by ministers like himself, and\r\nrendered either venerable or terrible by the glory of his successes,\r\nmay execute what his predecessors did not dare to attempt. Henry\r\nIV. tottered in his seat during his whole reign. Henry V. drew the\r\nstrength of the kingdom into France, to carry on his wars there,\r\nand left the Commons at home, protesting, \"that the people were not\r\nbound to serve out of the realm.\"\r\n\r\nIt is true, that a strong spirit of liberty subsists at present\r\nin Great-Britain, but what reliance is to be placed in the temper\r\nof a people, when the prince is possessed of an unconstitutional\r\npower, our own history can sufficiently inform us. When Charles II.\r\nhad strengthened himself by the return of the garrison of Tangier,\r\n\"England (says Rapin) saw on a sudden an amazing revolution; saw\r\nherself stripped of all her rights and privileges, excepting\r\nsuch as the King should vouchsafe to grant her; and what is more\r\nastonishing, the English themselves delivered up these very rights\r\nand privileges to Charles II. which they had so passionately, and,\r\nif I may say it, furiously defended against the designs of Charles\r\nI.\" This happened only thirty-six years after this last prince had\r\nbeen beheaded.\r\n\r\nSome persons are of opinion, that liberty is not violated, but by\r\nsuch open acts of force; but they seem to be greatly mistaken. I\r\ncould mention a period within these forty years, when almost as\r\ngreat a change of disposition was produced by the secret measures of\r\na long administration, as by Charles's violence. Liberty, perhaps\r\nis never exposed to so much danger, as when the people believe there\r\nis the least; for it may be subverted, and yet they not think so.\r\n\r\nPublic-disgusting acts are seldom practised by the ambitious,\r\nat the beginning of their designs. Such conduct silences and\r\ndiscourages the weak, and the wicked, who would otherways have been\r\ntheir advocates or accomplices. It is of great consequence, to\r\nallow those, who, upon any account, are inclined to favour them,\r\nsomething specious to say in their defence. The power may be fully\r\nestablished, though it would not be safe for them to do whatever\r\nthey please. For there are things, which, at some times, even slaves\r\nwill not bear. Julius Cæsar and Oliver Cromwell did not dare to\r\nassume the title of King. The grand Seignior dares not lay a new\r\ntax. The King of France dares not be a protestant. Certain popular\r\npoints may be left untouched, and yet freedom be extinguished. The\r\ncommonality of Venice imagine themselves free, because they are\r\npermitted to do, what they ought not. But I quit a subject, that\r\nwould lead me too far from my purpose.\r\n\r\nBy the late act of parliament, taxes are to be levied upon us, for\r\n\"defraying the charge of the administration of justice, the support\r\nof civil government--and the expences of defending his Majesty's\r\ndominions in America.\"\r\n\r\nIf any man doubts what ought to be the conduct of these colonies on\r\nthis occasion, I would ask them these questions.\r\n\r\nHas not the parliament expressly avowed their intention of raising\r\nmoney from us for certain purposes? Is not this scheme popular in\r\nGreat-Britain? Will the taxes, imposed by the late act, answer\r\nthose purposes? If it will, must it not take an immense sum from\r\nus? If it will not, is it to be expected, that the parliament will\r\nnot fully execute their intention, when it is pleasing at home,\r\nand not opposed here? Must not this be done by imposing new taxes?\r\nWill not every addition, thus made to our taxes, be an addition to\r\nthe power of the British legislature, by increasing the number of\r\nofficers employed in the collection? Will not every additional tax\r\ntherefore render it more difficult to abrogate any of them? When\r\na branch of revenue is once established, does it not appear to\r\nmany people invidious and undutiful, to attempt to abolish it? If\r\ntaxes, sufficient to accomplish the intention of the Parliament, are\r\nimposed by the Parliament, what taxes will remain to be imposed by\r\nour assemblies? If no material taxes remain to be imposed by them,\r\nwhat must become of them, and the people they represent?\r\n\r\n[57] \"If any person considers, these things, and yet not thinks our\r\nliberties are in danger, I wonder at that person's security.\"\r\n\r\n    [57] Demosthenes's 2d Philippic.\r\n\r\nOne other argument is to be added, which, by itself, I hope, will be\r\nsufficient to convince the most incredulous man on this continent,\r\nthat the late act of Parliament is only designed to be a precedent,\r\nwhereon the future vassalage of these colonies may be established.\r\n\r\nEvery duty thereby laid on articles of British manufacture, is laid\r\non some commodity upon the exportation of which from Great-Britain,\r\na drawback is payable. Those drawbacks in most of the articles, are\r\nexactly double to the duties given by the late act. The Parliament\r\ntherefore might in half a dozen lines have raised much more money\r\nonly by stopping the drawbacks in the hands of the officers at home,\r\non exportation to these colonies, than by this solemn imposition\r\nof taxes upon us, to be collected here. Probably, the artful\r\ncontrivers of this act formed it in this manner, in order to reserve\r\nto themselves, in case of any objections being made to it, this\r\nspecious pretence--\"That the drawbacks are gifts to the colonies;\r\nand that the act only lessens those gifts.\" But the truth is, that\r\nthe drawbacks are intended for the encouragement and promotion of\r\nBritish manufactures and commerce, and are allowed on exportation\r\nto any foreign parts, as well as on exportation to these provinces.\r\nBesides, care has been taken to slide into the act[58] some articles\r\non which there are no drawbacks. However, the whole duties laid by\r\nthe late act on all the articles therein specified, are so small,\r\nthat they will not amount to as much as the drawbacks which are\r\nallowed on part of them only. If, therefore, the sum to be obtained\r\nby the late act had been the sole object in forming it, there would\r\nnot have been any occasion for the \"Commons of Great-Britain to give\r\nand grant to his Majesty, rates and duties for raising a revenue in\r\nhis Majesty's dominions in America, for making a more certain and\r\nadequate provision for defraying the charge of the administration\r\nof justice, the support of civil government, and the expences of\r\ndefending the said dominions\"----Nor would there have been any\r\noccasion for an [59]expensive board of commissioners, and all the\r\nother new charges to which we are made liable.\r\n\r\n    [58] Though duties by the late act are laid on some articles, on\r\n    which no drawbacks are allowed, yet the duties imposed by the act,\r\n    are so small, in comparison with the drawbacks that are allowed,\r\n    that all the duties together will not amount to so much as the\r\n    drawbacks.\r\n\r\n    [59] The expence of this board, I am informed, is between four\r\n    and five thousand pounds sterling a year. The establishment of\r\n    officers, for collecting the revenue of America, amounted before\r\n    to seven thousand six hundred pounds per annum: and yet, says the\r\n    author of \"The regulation of the colonies,\" the whole remittance\r\n    from all the taxes in the colonies, at an average of thirty years,\r\n    has not amounted to one thousand nine hundred pounds a year, and\r\n    in that time, seven or eight hundred pounds per annum only, have\r\n    been remitted from North-America.\r\n\r\nThe smallness of the revenue arising from the duties in America,\r\ndemonstrated that they were intended only as regulations of trade;\r\nand can any person be so blind to truth, so dull of apprehension in\r\na matter of unspeakable importance to his country, as to imagine,\r\nthat the board of commissioners lately established at such a charge,\r\nis instituted to assist in collecting one thousand nine hundred\r\npounds a year, or the trifling duties imposed by the late act?\r\nSurely every man on this continent must perceive, that they are\r\nestablished for the care of a new system of revenue, which is but\r\nnow begun.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, for my part, I regard the late act as an experiment\r\nmade of our disposition. It is a bird sent over the waters, to\r\ndiscover, whether the waves, that lately agitated this part of the\r\nworld with such violence, are yet subsided. If this adventurer\r\ngets footing here, we shall quickly be convinced, that it is not\r\na phenix; for we shall soon see it followed by others of the same\r\nkind. We shall find it rather to be of the [60]breed described by the\r\npoet--\r\n\r\n     \"_Infelix vates._\"\r\n\r\n     A direful foreteller of future calamities.\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n    [60] \"Dira cælæno,\"             Virgil, Æneid 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beloved Countrymen_,\r\n\r\nSome states have lost their liberty by particular accidents; but\r\nthis calamity is generally owing to the decay of virtue. A people\r\nis travelling fast to destruction, when individuals consider their\r\ninterests as distinct from those of the public. Such notions are\r\nfatal to their country, and to themselves. Yet how many are there so\r\nweak and sordid as to think they perform all the offices of life,\r\nif they earnestly endeavour to increase their own wealth, power,\r\nand credit, without the least regard for the society, under the\r\nprotection of which they live; who, if they can make an immediate\r\nprofit to themselves, by lending their assistance to those, whose\r\nprojects plainly tend to the injury of their country, rejoice in\r\ntheir dexterity, and believe themselves intitled to the character\r\nof able politicians. Miserable men! of whom it is hard to say,\r\nwhether they ought to be most the objects of pity or contempt, but\r\nwhose opinions are certainly as detestable as their practices are\r\ndestructive.\r\n\r\nThough I always reflect with a high pleasure on the integrity and\r\nunderstanding of my countrymen, which, joined with a pure and\r\nhumble devotion to the great and gracious author of every blessing\r\nthey enjoy, will, I hope, ensure to them, and their posterity,\r\nall temporal and eternal happiness; yet when I consider, that in\r\nevery age and country there have been bad men, my heart, at this\r\nthreatening period, is so full of apprehension, as not to permit me\r\nto believe, but that there may be some on this continent, against\r\nwhom you ought to be upon your guard. Men, who either [61]hold\r\nor expect to hold certain advantages by setting examples of\r\nservility to their countrymen--Men who trained to the employment,\r\nor self-taught by a natural versatility of genius, serve as decoys\r\nfor drawing the innocent and unwary into snares. It is not to be\r\ndoubted but that such men will diligently bestir themselves, on this\r\nand every like occasion, to spread the infection of their meanness\r\nas far as they can. On the plans they have adopted, this is their\r\ncourse. This is the method to recommend themselves to their patrons.\r\n\r\n    [61] It is not intended by these words to throw any reflection\r\n    upon gentlemen, because they are possessed of offices; for\r\n    many of them are certainly men of virtue, and lovers of their\r\n    country. But supposed obligations of gratitude and honour may\r\n    induce them to be silent. Whether these obligations ought to\r\n    be regarded or not, is not so much to be considered by others,\r\n    in the judgment they form of these gentlemen, as whether\r\n    they think they ought to be regarded. Perhaps, therefore\r\n    we shall act in the properest manner towards them, if we\r\n    neither reproach nor imitate them. The persons meant in this\r\n    letter, are the base-spirited wretches, who may endeavor to\r\n    distinguish themselves, by their sordid zeal, in defending\r\n    and promoting measures, which they know, beyond all question,\r\n    to be destructive to the just rights and true interests of\r\n    their country. It is scarcely possible, to speak of these men\r\n    with any degree of patience. It is scarcely possible to speak\r\n    of them with any degree of propriety. For no words can truly\r\n    describe their guilt, and meanness. But every honest man, on\r\n    their being mentioned, will feel what cannot be expressed.\r\n    If their wickedness did not blind them, they might perceive,\r\n    along the coast of these colonies, many skeletons of wretched\r\n    ambition; who after distinguishing themselves, in support of the\r\n    Stamp-act, by a couragious contempt of their country, and of\r\n    justice, have been left to linger out their miserable existence,\r\n    without a government, collectorship, secretaryship, or any\r\n    other commission to console them, as well as it could for loss\r\n    of virtue and reputation--while numberless offices have been\r\n    bestowed in these colonies, on people from Great-Britain, and\r\n    new ones are continually invented to be thus bestowed. As a few\r\n    great prizes are put into a lottery to tempt multitudes to lose,\r\n    so here and there an American has been raised to a good post--\r\n\r\n              \"_Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto._\"\r\n\r\n    Mr. Grenville, indeed, in order to recommend the Stamp-act,\r\n    had the unequalled generosity, to pour down a golden shower\r\n    of offices upon Americans; and yet these ungrateful colonies\r\n    did not thank Mr. Grenville for shewing his kindness to their\r\n    countrymen, nor them for accepting it. How must that great\r\n    statesman have been surprised to find, that the unpolished\r\n    colonists could not be reconciled to infamy, by treachery?\r\n    Such a bountiful disposition towards us never appeared in any\r\n    minister before him, and probably never will appear again. For\r\n    it is evident that such a system of policy is to be established\r\n    on this continent, as, in a short time, is to render it utterly\r\n    unnecessary to use the least art in order to conciliate our\r\n    approbation of any measures. Some of our countrymen may be\r\n    employed to fix chains upon us; but they will never be permitted\r\n    to hold them afterwards. So that the utmost that any of them\r\n    can expect, is only a temporary provision, that may expire in\r\n    their own time; but which, they may be assured, will preclude\r\n    their children from having any consideration paid to them. The\r\n    natives of America, will sink into total neglect and contempt,\r\n    the moment that their country loses the constitutional powers\r\n    she now possesses. Most sincerely do I wish and pray, that every\r\n    one of us may be convinced of this great truth, that industry\r\n    and integrity are the \"paths of pleasantness, which lead to\r\n    happiness.\"\r\n\r\nThey act consistently, in a bad cause.\r\n\r\nThey run well in a mean race.\r\n\r\nFrom them we shall learn, how pleasant and profitable a thing it\r\nis, to be, for our submissive behaviour, well spoken of in St.\r\nJames's, or St. Stephen's; at Guildhall, or the Royal Exchange.\r\nSpecious fallacies will be drest up with all the arts of delusion,\r\nto persuade one colony to distinguish herself from another, by\r\nunbecoming condescensions, which will serve the ambitious purpose of\r\ngreat men at home, and therefore will be thought by them, to entitle\r\ntheir assistants in obtaining them, to considerable rewards.\r\n\r\nOur fears will be excited; our hopes will be awakened. It will be\r\ninsinuated to us with a plausible affectation of wisdom and concern,\r\nhow prudent it is to please the powerful--how dangerous to provoke\r\nthem--and then comes in the perpetual incantation, that freezes up\r\nevery generous purpose of the soul, in cold--inactive--expectation\r\n\"that if there is any request to be made, compliance will obtain a\r\nfavourable attention.\"\r\n\r\nOur vigilance and our union are success and safety. Our negligence\r\nand our division are distress and death. They are worse--they are\r\nshame and slavery.\r\n\r\nLet us equally shun the benumbing stillness of overweening sloth,\r\nand the feverish activity of that ill-informed zeal, which buries\r\nitself in maintaining little, mean, and narrow opinions. Let us,\r\nwith a truly wise generosity and charity, banish and discourage\r\nall illiberal distinctions, which may arise from differences in\r\nsituation, forms of government, or modes of religion. Let us\r\nconsider ourselves as men--Freemen--Christian men--separated from\r\nthe rest of the world, and firmly bound together by the same rights,\r\ninterests, and dangers. Let these keep our attention inflexibly\r\nfixed on the great objects, which we must continually regard, in\r\norder to preserve those rights, to promote those interests, and to\r\navert those dangers.\r\n\r\nLet these truths be indelibly impressed on our minds--that we cannot\r\nbe happy without being free--that we cannot be free without being\r\nsecure in our property--that we cannot be secure in our property,\r\nif, without our consent, others may, as by right, take it away--that\r\ntaxes imposed on us by parliament, do thus take it away--that\r\nduties laid for the sole purposes of raising money, are taxes--that\r\nattempts to lay such duties should be instantly and firmly\r\nopposed--that this opposition can never be effectual, unless it is\r\nthe united effort of these provinces--that, therefore, benevolence\r\nof temper toward each other, and unanimity of counsels are essential\r\nto the welfare of the whole--and lastly, that, for this reason,\r\nevery man amongst us, who, in any manner, would encourage either\r\ndissention, diffidence, or indifference between these colonies, is\r\nan enemy to himself and to his country.\r\n\r\nThe belief of these truths, I verily think, my countrymen, is\r\nindispensably necessary to your happiness. I beseech you, therefore,\r\n[62]\"Teach them diligently unto your children, and talk of them when\r\nyou sit in your houses, and when you walk by the way, and when you\r\nlie down, and when you rise up.\"\r\n\r\n    [62] Deut. vi. 7.\r\n\r\nWhat have these colonies to ask, while they continue free? Or\r\nwhat have they to dread, but insidious attempts to subvert their\r\nfreedom? Their prosperity does not depend on ministerial favours\r\ndoled out to particular provinces. They form one political body,\r\nof which each colony is a member. Their happiness is founded on\r\ntheir constitution; and is to be promoted by preserving that\r\nconstitution in unabated vigour throughout every part. A spot, a\r\nspeck of decay, however small the limb on which it appears, and\r\nhowever remote it may seem from the vitals, should be alarming.\r\nWe have all the rights requisite for our prosperity. The legal\r\nauthority of Great-Britain may indeed lay hard restrictions upon\r\nus; but, like the spear of Telephus, it will cure as well as wound.\r\nHer unkindness will instruct and compel us, after some time, to\r\ndiscover, in our industry and frugality, surprising remedies--if\r\nour rights continue inviolated. For as long as the products of\r\nour labours and the rewards of our care, can properly be called\r\nour own, so long will it be worth our while to be industrious\r\nand frugal. But if when we plow--sow--reap--gather--and thresh,\r\nwe find, that we plow--sow--reap--gather--and thresh for others,\r\nwhose pleasure is to be the sole limitation, how much they shall\r\ntake, and how much they shall leave, why should we repeat the\r\nunprofitable toil? Horses and oxen are content with that portion\r\nof the fruits of their work, which their owners assign to them, in\r\norder to keep them strong enough to raise successive crops; but\r\neven these beasts will not submit to draw for their masters, until\r\nthey are subdued with whips and goads. Let us take care of our\r\nrights, and we therein take care of our property. \"Slavery is ever\r\npreceded by sleep.\"[63] Individuals may be dependant on ministers,\r\nif they please. States should scorn it----And, if you are not\r\nwanting to yourselves, you will have a proper regard paid you by\r\nthose, to whom if you are not respectable, you will infallibly be\r\ncontemptible. But if we have already forgot the reasons that urged\r\nus, with unexampled unanimity, to exert ourselves two years ago;\r\nif our zeal for the public good is worn out before the homespun\r\ncloaths which it caused us to have made--if our resolutions are so\r\nfaint, as by our present conduct to condemn our own late successful\r\nexample----if we are not affected by any reverence for the memory of\r\nour ancestors, who transmitted to us that freedom in which they had\r\nbeen blest----if we are not animated by any regard for posterity,\r\nto whom, by the most sacred obligations, we are bound to deliver\r\ndown the invaluable inheritance--Then, indeed, any minister--or any\r\ntool of a minister--or any creature of a tool of a minister--or any\r\nlower [64]instrument of administration, if lower there may be, is a\r\npersonage, whom it may be dangerous to offend.\r\n\r\n    [63] Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws, B. 14. C. 13.\r\n\r\n    [64] \"_Instrumenta regni._\" Tacitus An. b. 12. s. 66.\r\n\r\n    If any person shall imagine that he discovers in these letters\r\n    the least disaffection towards our most excellent Sovereign, and\r\n    the parliament of Great-Britain; or the least dislike to the\r\n    dependance of these colonies on that kingdom, I beg that such\r\n    person will not form any judgment on particular expressions, but\r\n    will consider the tenour of all the letters taken together. In\r\n    that case, I flatter myself that every unprejudiced reader will\r\n    be convinced, that the true interests of Great-Britain are as\r\n    dear to me as they ought to be to every good subject.\r\n\r\n    If I am an Enthusiast in anything, it is in my zeal for\r\n    the perpetual dependance of these colonies on their\r\n    mother-country.--A dependance founded on mutual benefits, the\r\n    continuance of which can be secured only by mutual affections.\r\n    Therefore it is, that with extreme apprehension I view the\r\n    smallest seeds of discontent, which are unwarily scattered\r\n    abroad. Fifty or sixty years will make astonishing alterations\r\n    in these colonies; and this consideration should render it the\r\n    business of Great Britain more and more to cultivate our good\r\n    dispositions towards her: but the misfortune is, that those\r\n    great men, who are wrestling for power at home, think themselves\r\n    very slightly interested in the prosperity of their country\r\n    fifty or sixty years hence; but are deeply concerned in blowing\r\n    up a popular clamour for supposed immediate advantages.\r\n\r\n    For my part, I regard Great-Britain as a bulwark happily fixed\r\n    between these colonies and the powerful nations of Europe.\r\n    That kingdom is our advanced post or fortification, which\r\n    remaining safe, we under its protection enjoying peace, may\r\n    diffuse the blessings of religion, science, and liberty, thro'\r\n    remote wildernesses. It is, therefore, incontestibly our duty\r\n    and our interest, to support the strength of Great Britain.\r\n    When, confiding in that strength, she begins to forget from\r\n    whence it arose, it will be an easy thing to shew the source.\r\n    She may readily be reminded of the loud alarm spread among her\r\n    merchants and tradesmen, by the universal association of these\r\n    colonies, at the time of the Stamp-act, not to import any of\r\n    her manufactures.----In the year 1718, the Russians and Swedes,\r\n    entered into an agreement, not to suffer Great-Britain to export\r\n    any naval stores from their dominions, but in Russian or Swedish\r\n    ships, and at their own prices. Great-Britain was distressed.\r\n    Pitch and tar rose to three pounds a barrel. At length she\r\n    thought of getting these articles from the colonies; and the\r\n    attempt succeeding, they fell down to fifteen shillings. In\r\n    the year 1756, Great Britain was threatened with an invasion.\r\n    An easterly wind blowing for six weeks, she could not man\r\n    her fleet, and the whole nation was thrown into the utmost\r\n    consternation. The wind changed. The American ships arrived.\r\n    The fleet sailed in ten or fifteen days. There are some other\r\n    reflections on this subject worthy of the most deliberate\r\n    attention of the British parliament; but they are of such a\r\n    nature, I do not chuse to mention them publicly. I thought I\r\n    discharged my duty to my country, taking the liberty, in the\r\n    year 1765, while the Stamp-Act was in suspense, of writing my\r\n    sentiments to a man of the greatest influence at home, who\r\n    afterwards distinguished himself by espousing our cause, in the\r\n    debates concerning the repeal of that act.\r\n\r\nI shall be extremely sorry if any man mistakes my meaning in any\r\nthing I have said. Officers employed by the crown, are, while\r\naccording to the laws they conduct themselves, entitled to legal\r\nobedience and sincere respect. These it is a duty to render them,\r\nand these no good or prudent person will withhold. But when these\r\nofficers, thro' rashness or design, endeavour to enlarge their\r\nauthority beyond its due limits, and expect improper concessions\r\nto be made to them, from regard for the employments they bear,\r\ntheir attempts should be considered as equal injuries to the crown\r\nand people, and should be courageously and constantly opposed. To\r\nsuffer our ideas to be confounded by names, on such occasions, would\r\ncertainly be an inexcusable weakness, and probably, an irremediable\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nWe have reason to believe, that several of his Majesty's present\r\nministers are good men, and friends to our country; and it seems\r\nnot unlikely, that by a particular concurrence of events, we have\r\nbeen treated a little more severely than they wished we should\r\nbe. They might not think it prudent to stem a torrent. But what\r\nis the difference to us, whether arbitrary acts take their rise\r\nfrom ministers, or are permitted by them? Ought any point to be\r\nallowed to a good[65] minister, that should be denied to a bad one?\r\nThe mortality of ministers is a very frail mortality. A * * * may\r\nsucceed a Shelburne--a * * * may succeed a Conway.\r\n\r\n    [65] \"Ubi imperium ad ignaros aut minus bonos pervenit; novum\r\n    illud exemplum, ad dignis et idoneis, ad indignos et non idoneos\r\n    transfertur.\"\r\n\r\n                              Sall. Bed. Cat. s. 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find a new kind of minister lately spoken of at home----\"The\r\nminister of the house of Commons.\" The term seems to have particular\r\npropriety when referred to these colonies, with a different meaning\r\nannexed to it, from that in which it is taken there. By the word\r\n\"minister\" we may understand not only a servant of the crown, but a\r\nman of influence among the Commons, who regard themselves as having\r\na share of the sovereignty over us. The minister of the house may,\r\nin a point respecting the colonies, be so strong, that the minister\r\nof the crown in the house, if he is a distinct person, may not\r\nchuse, even where his sentiments are favourable to us, to come to a\r\npitched battle upon our account. For tho' I have the highest opinion\r\nof the deference of the house for the King's minister; yet he may\r\nbe so good natured as not to put it to the test, except it be for\r\nthe mere and immediate profit of his master or himself.\r\n\r\nBut whatever kind of minister he is, that attempts to innovate a\r\nsingle iota in the privileges of these colonies, him I hope you will\r\nundauntedly oppose, and that you will never suffer yourselves to be\r\neither cheated or frightened into any unworthy obsequiousness. On\r\nsuch emergencies you may surely without presumption believe that\r\nALMIGHTY GOD himself will look down upon your righteous contest with\r\ngracious approbation. You will be a \"Band of brother's\" cemented by\r\nthe dearest ties--and strengthened with inconceivable supplies of\r\nforce and constancy, by that sympathetic ardour which animates good\r\nmen, confederated in a good cause. Your honour and welfare will be,\r\nas they now are, most intimately concerned; and besides----you are\r\nassigned by Divine Providence, in the appointed order of things,\r\nthe protectors of unborn ages, whose fate depends upon your virtue.\r\nWhether they shall arise the noble and indisputable heirs of the\r\nrichest patrimonies, or the dastardly and hereditary drudges of\r\nimperious task-masters, you must determine.\r\n\r\nTo discharge this double duty to yourselves and to your\r\nposterity; you have nothing to do, but to call forth into\r\nuse the good sense and spirit, of which you are possessed.\r\nYou have nothing to do, but to conduct your affairspeaceably----\r\nprudently----firmly----jointly. By these means you will support the\r\ncharacter of freemen, without losing that of faithful subjects--a\r\ngood character in any government--one of the best under a British\r\ngovernment. You will prove that Americans have that true magnanimity\r\nof soul, that can resent injuries without falling into rage; and\r\nthat tho' your devotion to Great-Britain is the most affectionate,\r\nyet you can make proper distinctions, and know what you owe to\r\nyourselves as well as to her----you will, at the same time that\r\nyou advance your interests, advance your reputation--you will\r\nconvince the world of the justice of your demands, and the purity\r\nof your intentions--while all mankind must with unceasing applauses\r\nconfess, that you indeed deserve liberty, who so well understand it,\r\nso passionately love it, so temperately enjoy it, and so wisely,\r\nbravely, and virtuously, assert, maintain, and defend it.\r\n\r\n     \"_Certe ego libertatem quæ mihi a parente meo tradita est,\r\n     experiar, verum id frustra, an ob rem faciam, in vestra manu\r\n     situm est, quirites._\"\r\n\r\n     \"For my part, I am resolved strenuously to contend for the\r\n     liberty delivered down to me from my ancestors; but whether\r\n     I shall do this effectually or not, depends on you, my\r\n     countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nHow little soever one is able to write, yet, when the liberties\r\nof one's country are threatened, it is still more difficult to be\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\n                                           A FARMER.\r\n\r\n_Is there not the greatest reason to hope, if the universal sense of\r\nthe colonies is immediately exprest by resolves of the assemblies,\r\nin support of their rights; by instructions to their agents on the\r\nsubject; and by petitions to the crown and parliament for redress;\r\nthat those measures will have the same success now that they had in\r\nthe time of the Stamp-act._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the ingenious Author of certain patriotic Letters, subscribed A\r\nFARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MUCH RESPECTED SIR,\r\n\r\nWhen the rights and liberties of the numerous and loyal inhabitants\r\nof this extensive continent are in imminent danger,--when the\r\ninveterate enemies of these colonies are not more assiduous to forge\r\nfetters for them, than diligent to delude the people, and zealous to\r\npersuade them to an indolent acquiescence: At this alarming period,\r\nwhen to reluct is deemed a revolt, and to oppose such measures as\r\nare injudicious and destructive, is construed as a formal attempt\r\nto subvert order and government; when to reason is to rebel; and a\r\nready submission to the rod of power, is sollicited by the tenders\r\nof place and patronage, or urged by the menace of danger and\r\ndisgrace: 'Tis to YOU, worthy SIR, that AMERICA is obliged, for\r\na most seasonable, sensible, loyal, and vigorous vindication of\r\nher invaded rights and liberties: 'Tis to YOU, the distinguished\r\nhonour is due; that when many of the friends of liberty were ready\r\nto fear its utter subversion: Armed with truth, supported by the\r\nimmutable laws of nature, the common inheritance of man, and leaning\r\non the pillars of the BRITISH constitution; you seasonably brought\r\nyour aid, opposed impending ruin, awakened the most indolent and\r\ninactive, to a sense of danger, re-animated the hopes of those,\r\nwho had before exerted themselves in the cause of freedom, and\r\ninstructed AMERICA in the best means to obtain redress.\r\n\r\nNor is this western world alone indebted to your wisdom, fortitude,\r\nand patriotism: GREAT-BRITAIN also may be confirmed by you, that to\r\nbe truly great and successful, she must be just: That to oppress\r\nAMERICA, is to violate her own honours, defeat her brightest\r\nprospects, and contract her spreading empire.\r\n\r\nTo such eminent worth and virtue, the inhabitants of the town of\r\nBOSTON, the capital of the province of the MASSACHUSETTS-BAY, in\r\nfull town meeting assembled, express their earliest gratitude.\r\nActuated themselves by the same generous principles, which appear\r\nwith so much lustre in your useful labours, they will not fail\r\nwarmly to recommend, and industriously to promote that union among\r\nthe several colonies, which is so indispensably necessary for the\r\nsecurity of the whole.\r\n\r\nTho' such superior merit must assuredly, in the closest recess,\r\nenjoy the divine satisfaction of having served, and possibly\r\nsaved this people; tho' veiled from our view, you modestly shun\r\nthe deserved applause of millions; permit us to intrude upon your\r\nretirement, and salute The FARMER, as the FRIEND OF AMERICANS, and\r\nthe common benefactor of mankind.\r\n\r\n                           _Boston, March 22, 1768._\r\n\r\n     The above letter was read, and unanimously accepted by the town,\r\n     and ordered to be published in the several news-papers.\r\n\r\n               _Attest._ WILLIAM COOPER, Town-Clerk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: logo]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nMinor typographical and punctuation errors have been corrected\r\nwithout note.
